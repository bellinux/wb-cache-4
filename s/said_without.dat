5|$|The new candle was {{designed}} by the Allentown firm Alvin Butz Co., the Allentown firm Barry Isett & Associates, and Bethlehem Steel Corp. Supplies were provided by Dugan & Marcon Inc., Eisenhardt Mills, Ingersoll-Rand Co. and Dectis Painting, and the construction done by the Carpenters Union Local 600, Electricians Union Local 367 and the Northampton County Labor Council. It looked {{almost exactly the same}} as the old previous candle, with eight flood lights installed to illuminate the white shaft. The candle cost $35,000 to build, but Panto <b>said</b> <b>without</b> the help from volunteers, it would have cost around $150,000, not including labor. In order to cover the $15,000 shortfall in funds raised, the city sold Christmas cards, posters, ornaments and $10 Peace Candle ownership shares. The first lighting ceremony for the new candle was held November 23, 1990.|$|E

25|$|Defining a German nation {{based on}} {{internal}} characteristics presented difficulties. Since {{the start of}} the Reformation in the 16th century, the German lands had been divided between Catholics and Lutherans and linguistic diversity was large as well. Today, the Swabian, Bavarian, Saxon and Cologne dialects in their most pure forms are estimated to be 40% mutually intelligible with modern Standard German, meaning that in a conversation between a native speaker of any of these dialects and a person who speaks only standard German, the latter will be able to understand slightly less than half of what is being <b>said</b> <b>without</b> any prior knowledge of the dialect, a situation which is likely to have been similar or greater in the 19th century.|$|E
25|$|Significant changes came in 1910 {{with the}} reform of the Roman Breviary by Pope Pius X. This {{revision}} modified the traditional psalm scheme so that, while all 150 psalms {{were used in the}} course of the week, these were <b>said</b> <b>without</b> repetition. Those assigned to the Sunday office underwent the least revision, although noticeably fewer psalms are recited at Matins, and both Lauds and Compline are slightly shorter due to psalms (or in the case of Compline the first few verses of a psalm) being removed. Pius X was probably influenced by earlier attempts to eliminate repetition in the psalter, most notably the liturgy of the Benedictine congregation of St. Maur. However, since Cardinal Quignonez's attempt to reform the Breviary employed this principle—albeit with no regard to the traditional scheme—such notions had floated around in the western Church, and can particularly be seen in the Paris Breviary.|$|E

It may be <b>said,</b> <b>without</b> exaggeration, that the troops which engaged our advanced guard amounted to twenty-five thousand men. I now perceived the absolute impossibility of making any further resistance {{against such a}} superior force, {{as well as the}} danger that threatened the division, from the advantage which the enemy had gained on the left. I therefore ordered General Soult to fall back with the division to the post before Pfulendorf [...]" ...|$|E

500|$|Due to the {{tensions}} between the filmmaker and the producers during production, Gilliam said in retrospect about the film, [...] "t's not the film they wanted and it's not quite the film I wanted. It's the film that {{is a result of}} [...] two groups of people, who aren’t working well together." [...] With regards to the Weinsteins also producing Martin Scorsese's film Gangs of New York (2002), Gilliam stated: [...] "Marty [...] said almost the exact same quote I <b>said,</b> <b>without</b> us knowing it: 'They took the joy out of filmmaking.'" ...|$|E
500|$|A {{pathologist}} {{examined the}} boy's body, {{but there was}} no full autopsy. It is unclear whether bullets were recovered from the scene or from Jamal and Muhammad. In 2002 Abu Rahma implied to Esther Schapira that he had collected bullets at the scene, adding: [...] "We have some secrets for ourselves. We cannot give anything... everything." [...] According to Jamal al-Durrah, five bullets were recovered from his body by physicians in Gaza and four in Amman. In 2013 he <b>said,</b> <b>without</b> elaborating: [...] "The bullets the Israelis fired are in the possession of the Palestinian Authority." ...|$|E
500|$|Louis Bernacchi, the party's Australian physicist, {{was later}} to write: [...] "In many respects, Borchgrevink {{was not a}} good leader". Borchgrevink was evidently no autocrat but, Bernacchi <b>said,</b> <b>without</b> the {{framework}} of an accepted hierarchy a state of [...] "democratic anarchy" [...] prevailed, with [...] "dirt, disorder and inactivity the order of the day". Furthermore, as winter developed, Borchgrevink's hopes that Cape Adare would escape the worst Antarctic weather proved false; in fact he had chosen a site which was particularly exposed to the freezing winds blown northwards from the inland ice. As time progressed, tempers wore thin; the party became irritable and boredom set in.|$|E

500|$|The {{assertion}} ignited debate. Andrew Farke had in 2006 stressed that, {{apart from}} the frill, no systematic differences could be found between Torosaurus and Triceratops. He nevertheless disputed Scannella's conclusion by arguing in 2011 that the proposed morphological changes required to [...] "age" [...] a Triceratops into a Torosaurus would be without precedent among ceratopsids. Creatures would require the growth of epoccipitals, reversion of bone texture from adult to immature forms back to adult, and growth of frill holes at a later stage than usual. A study by Nicholas Longrich and Daniel Field analyzed 35 specimens of both Triceratops and Torosaurus. The authors concluded that Triceratops individuals {{too old to be}} considered immature forms are represented in the fossil record, as are Torosaurus individuals too young to be considered fully mature adults. The synonymy of Triceratops and Torosaurus cannot be supported, they <b>said,</b> <b>without</b> more convincing intermediate forms than Scannella and Horner initially produced. Scannella's Triceratops specimen with a hole on its frill, they argued, could represent a diseased or malformed individual rather than a transitional stage between an immature Triceratops and mature Torosaurus form.|$|E

Also for The Hindu, Malathi Rangarajan wrote, [...] "Let's celebrate the figment of [...] imagination that has made the housefly appear as invincible as any of our muscle-flexing heroes". Karishma Upadhyay of The Telegraph called the film [...] "a winner from the first frame to the last" [...] and praised Rajamouli's screenplay, writing that it made [...] "the absurd seem real, willing you to accept anything that he throws at you". J. Hurtado of Twitch Film called Eega the [...] "best, most insane, most inventive film of the year", and praised Rajamouli's scripting, the visual effects and Sudeep's performance, calling the latter [...] "legitimately hilarious". V. S. Rajapur, Indo-Asian News Service gave Eega four stars out of five, and praised the performances and music; Rajapur was particularly appreciative of the visual effects, saying the hard work put in by the entire team was [...] "clearly visible onscreen". A reviewer from Sify called Eega an [...] "escapist, comic book-like fantasy" [...] that [...] "throws you into an experience so profound that nothing else really matters".|$|E

2500|$|Hersh {{repeated}} the allegations during {{a press conference}} held in London to publicize his book. No British newspaper would publish the allegations because of Maxwell's famed litigiousness. However, two British MPs raised the matter in the House of Commons, which meant that British newspapers were able to report what had been <b>said</b> <b>without</b> fear of being sued for libel. Maxwell called the claims [...] "ludicrous, a total invention". He fired Davies shortly thereafter.|$|E
2500|$|Film {{historian}} Richard Corliss writes that, [...] "Ben Hecht was the Hollywood screenwriter... {{it can be}} <b>said</b> <b>without</b> {{too much}} exaggeration that Hecht personifies Hollywood itself." [...] Movie columnist Pauline Kael added that, [...] "between them, Hecht and Jules Furthman wrote most of the best American talkies". His movie career can be defined by about twenty credited screenplays he wrote for Hawks, Hitchcock, Hathaway, Lubitsch, Wellman, Sternberg, and himself. He wrote many of those with his two regular collaborators, Charles MacArthur and Charles Lederer.|$|E

2500|$|Perhaps {{the best}} {{endorsement}} made of Cosgrave, {{came from his}} old rival Éamon de Valera, with whom he was reconciled before his death. De Valera, once in 1932 and later close to his own death, made two major comments. To an interviewer, when asked what was his biggest mistake, he <b>said</b> <b>without</b> a pause, [...] "not accepting the Treaty". To his own son, Vivion, weeks after taking power in 1932 and reading the files on the actions of Cosgrave's governments in relation to its work in the Commonwealth, he said of Cosgrave and Cosgrave's ministers [...] "when we got in and saw the files[...] [...] they did a magnificent job, Viv. They did a magnificent job." ...|$|E

I've thrown up a marriage, I've been on bad terms with my parents for a long time, all of which has troubled and exhausted me." [...] He said he had disappointed sponsors, managers and directeurs sportifs, even though they continued to show confidence in him. [...] "I had become schizophrenic," [...] he <b>said.</b> <b>Without</b> psychiatric help, he would [...] "have followed the same path as Pantani", the Italian rider found dead on a hotel floor.
