40|$|The {{implementation}} {{of an environmental}} management system such as the standard ISO 14001 is a common way to manage environmental responsibilities in an organisation. In 2015 ISO 14001 was updated with some major changes like Annex <b>SL,</b> <b>management</b> engagement, strategic engagement, risk-based thinking, life cycle perspective, improved environmental management and interested parties. The purpose of ISO 14001 {{is to improve the}} environmental performance of the organisation, but also to increase the degree of employee involvement and with that sustainable development can be supported through the {{implementation of}} the standard. The involvement of employees in an organisation with an environmental management system was studied at the Swedish University of Agricultural Science (SLU). By law a Swedish university must have an environmental management system. SLU has implemented ISO 14001 as their environmental management system and was chosen for the research. The applied methods were a literature review and case study where interviews and a survey were used. The changes in ISO 14001 : 2015 were investigated {{as a part of the}} literature review. In this method, review studies were investigated to see if any of the changes were discussed before the standard was updated. There was no found research that discussed if drawbacks of version 14001 : 2004 were actually taken into account when the newest version of the standard was produced. This subject therefore makes the study important to perform. Environmental coordinators were interviewed to find out if the changes in 14001 : 2015 supported increased participation in the standard. A survey was conducted with environmental coordinators at SLU to investigate how the changes in ISO 14001 : 2015 were viewed and if the results differed if performed from those obtained from a similar comparison at companies. The reason to study the effects of the changes in the standard at a university and to compare the results with companies is important since it is not optional for the university to adopt an environmental management system as it is for another type of organisation. Most of the discussed shortcomings from ISO 14001 : 2004 did match what was changed in the version from 2015. However, the review studies that were investigated did not discuss the life cycle perspective which was considered to be a major and important change. Therefore, this lack of discussion is viewed as a weakness in the review studies. It was also concluded that, even though employees did become involved to a greater extent in the environmental management system at SLU, it could not be made sure if it was because of the implementations of the changes in ISO 14001 : 2015. It was most likely because of the major work SLU had done the last three years when certifying the whole organisation. Instead, the conclusion was that it is important to work inclusively with the environmental management system and it seems that the more it is discussed in an organisation, the more employees will become involved. Lastly, it was seen in the thesis that a university and the studied companies viewed the environmental work both similarly and differently. Both thought that only small benefits would be the result of the implementation of the changes in ISO 14001 : 2015. What differed between the two groups of organisations was that SLU thought that the changes would not give any major difficulties while the companies on the other hand thought that it would create substantial extra work...|$|E

Only 1 patient had a positive laparotomy.

40|$|Purpose – Given {{previous}} findings that employee satisfaction contributes to firm performance and sustainability, {{this study examined}} the relationships between 23 leadership/management practices on employee satisfaction. It identified specific practices with significant effects on employee satisfaction. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach – Using a theoretical framework and questionnaire derived from Avery and Bergsteiner's Sustainable Leadership Model, data were collected from 1, 152 employees in small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Bangkok, Thailand. Findings – Overall, adopting sustainable leadership (SL) practices was related significantly to employee satisfaction, consistent with Avery and Bergsteiner's model. Twenty of the 23 SL practices were linked to enhanced employee satisfaction, the exceptions being independence from the financial markets, self-management and environmental responsibility. Specific SL practices predicted enhanced employee satisfaction more than others, the strongest predictor being high staff engagement. Other practices associated with employee satisfaction were: valuing employees, ethical behaviour, considered organizational change, a strong and shared vision, an enabling culture, and quality in products and services. Research limitations/implications – Considerable scope exists for future research into the relationships between individual and bundles of SL practices with employee satisfaction in different national, industry and other contexts. Further limitations are discussed in the paper. Practical implications – Managers of SMEs in Thailand and possibly in other contexts should consider adopting the SL practices shown to significantly enhance employee satisfaction and in doing so help sustain their business success. Originality/value – This study pioneered research into a gap in the literature about the <b>SL</b> and <b>management</b> practices that positively predict enhanced employee satisfaction, an area of importance to both leadership practice and research. 14 page(s...|$|R
50|$|City Honors School {{has such}} an {{academic}} intensive program that a test {{is required in}} order to enroll. This test can be taken in the November before the next school year. There are multiple testing days throughout the month. For example, to enter as a 5th grade student, the test must be taken in the student's 4th grade year. City Honors currently offers Advanced Placement and International Baccalaureate courses to its high school students. The IB program was adopted in 1991. IB coursesinclude English A1 HL (Higher Level), Language B SL (French, Spanish or Mandarin) (Standard Level), Economics SL, History of the Americas HL, Biology SL/HL, Physics SL/HL, Business and <b>Management</b> <b>SL,</b> Mathematics SL, Mathematics Studies SL, Film HL, Visual Arts HL, and Theory of Knowledge (ToK). The school was authorized as a Middle Years Program (MYP) school in summer 2008. This brought the IB program to grades 5-10 as well. At a minimum, all juniors and seniors take two years of IB English; this is a requirement to graduate from City Honors School and can bring college credit if a student does well enough in the course.|$|R
40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 30 -November 02, 1989 / Town & Country Hotel & Convention Center, San Diego, CaliforniaThe Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS) is {{developing}} a set of communications protocols for Advanced Orbiting Systems (AOS). The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the European Space Agency (ESA) are cooperating {{in an effort to}} extensively validate these AOS protocols. This paper describes the techniques and facilities being used to perform this validation. Validation of the AOS protocols consists of (1) developing a formal specification of the protocols using a standard formal definition technique (FDT), (2) developing implementations of the protocols, and (3) remote testing of the implementations. From the FDT specifications, each agency {{is developing}} independent implementations which are consistent with the FDT specifications of the AOS protocols. Errors, omissions, or discrepancies detected during the development of the FDT specification and the implementation will be reported to the CCSDS and changes to the main specification will be suggested. The independent implementations will be extensively tested locally by the developing agency and then remotely tested through a cooperative test setup between the agencies. The implementations will interact to communicate between the agencies thus providing proof that the FDT specifications are sufficiently specific to be interpreted by everyone in the same way. Significant variations in the interpretations will result in feedback to the CCSDS and any needed changes to the main specification will be suggested. The AOS protocols are divided into four categories: Path, Space Link ARQ Protocol (SLAP), Space Link (<b>SL),</b> and <b>Management.</b> Each agency has agreed to be either the leader or support agency for each of the categories. NASA has agreed to be leader for the validation of the SLAP and SLS categories while ESA has agreed to lead in the validation of the Path and Management categories. Testbeds at the European Space Research and Technology Centre (ESTEC) in Noordwijk, Holland and at the MITRE Corporation in McLean, Virginia have been constructed for the development of FDT specifications and AOS protocol implementations. Communications facilities are being obtained which will connect these testbeds. This paper describes these testbeds, the AOS FDT specifications, the protocol implementations being developed, and the results expected from the tests performed...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to analyze if the extent of the Progestão really develops the necessary skills to managers of public schools at the Superintendence Regional de Ensino de Sete Lagoas (SRE / <b>SL)</b> for the <b>management</b> of physical structure, equipments and furniture of the schools. Studying this issue is important because the management of the physical structure, equipments and furniture of the schools should be considered as strategic as it is important to create a school environment that will contribute to a better learning process. The methodology is implemented and used as a qualitative research method case study. In the field research, managers, who were participants of the Training Program for Managers School in distance (Progestão), editions of 2004, 2005, 2005, 2006, 2007 / 2008, 2008 / 2009, 2009 / 2010, 2010 / 2011 and 2012, were interviewed by using a questionnaire. To be more accurate this study was based on a document analysis and indirect observation of the author who works at SRE / SL. Furthermore, correlated topics such as: strategic and participative management, the dimensions of school management and the job roles of managers. In addition to this, was considered how the management of physical structure, equipments and furniture of the school may affect school performance. The results obtained in this study show that for managers in the physical structure and school equity there is a need for training that goes beyond available by Progestão and the Action Plan brings a proposal to improve this situation...|$|R
