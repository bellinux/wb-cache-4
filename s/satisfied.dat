When Borgsen hangs up, Black deduces that Vaughan {{is to be the}} next victim. Black, fellow Group member Peter Watts (Terry O'Quinn) and Sheriff Falkner (John Dennis Johnston) track the kidnapped Vaughan to an equine slaughterhouse. Falkner is attacked and incapacitated by Borgsen as Black locates a still-living Vaughan, who has been hung by her jacket from a meat hook. Black is then confronted by Borgsen, who knocks him down with the cattle prod. Borgsen is about to kill Black with a captive bolt pistol, but is trampled to death by several escaped horses.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A mutual {{exclusion}} algorithm is presented that has four desired properties: (1) it <b>satisfies</b> FIFO fairness, (2) it <b>satisfies</b> localspinning, (3) it is adaptive, and (4) it uses finite number of bounded size atomic registers. No previously published algorithm <b>satisfies</b> all these properties. In fact, {{it is the}} first algorithm (using only atomic registers) which <b>satisfies</b> both FIFO and local-spinning, and {{it is the first}} bounded space algorithm which <b>satisfies</b> both FIFO and adaptivity. All the algorithms presented are based on Lamport’s famous Bakery algorithm [27], which <b>satisfies</b> FIFO, but uses unbounded size registers (and does not <b>satisfy</b> local-spinning and is not adaptive). Using only one additional shared bit, we bound the amount of space required by the Bakery algorithm by coloring the tickets taken in the Bakery algorithm. The resulting Black-White Bakery algorithm preserves the simplicity and elegance of the original algorithm, <b>satisfies</b> FIFO and uses finite number of bounded size registers. Then, in a sequence of steps (which preserve simplicity and elegance) we modify the new algorithm so that it is also adaptive to point contention and <b>satisfies</b> local-spinning. ...|$|R
