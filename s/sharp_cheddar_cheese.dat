In 1978, {{it was one of}} the few establishments in Washington, D.C., to serve Guinness Stout on tap. In 1979, Washington Post restaurant reviewer Lon Tuck noted that Old Ebbitt's Omelet Room was one of the most famous locations in the city. Its trademark omelets were the [...] "Old Ebbitt" [...] (made with <b>sharp</b> <b>cheddar</b> <b>cheese</b> and Bermuda onions) and another made with chili and served with a garden salad with Roquefort blue cheese dressing. Washington Post reporter Pamela Kessler observed in 1981 that its signature dishes included chili, blue cheese and Welsh rarebit hamburgers, quiche Lorraine, a Reuben sandwich, and steaks. Its crab cakes were poorly reviewed as too bland and heavy with bread. It was one of the few dining places in the city to stay open until 1:00 A.M.|$|E

5000|$|J.E. Miller {{arrived in}} Lincoln from Pennsylvania in 1879 and in 1880 formed a {{partnership}} with Dr. Bartlett Paine to build a department store at 13th and O streets in downtown Lincoln. The building was built in 1898. The store was named Miller & Paine. In 1916, a new building was constructed on the site at 13th and O streets. [...] The new building was designed by Berlinghof & Davis. In 1935, Miller & Paine became the first air-conditioned department store in Nebraska.Miller & Paine had a lunch counter {{in the basement and}} the Tea Room on the fifth floor in the flagship downtown store. Besides having the tearoom and lunch counter, they also had a bakery that was famous for its cinnamon rolls and crumb cookies and made their own candy to sell in their candy department. Miller & Paine imported cinnamon for its trademark cinnamon rolls, and <b>sharp</b> English <b>cheddar</b> <b>cheese</b> for its macaroni & cheese which was served crusted in its own individual serving bowl. The company also owned a farm near Emerald, Nebraska for its own supply of poultry, vegetables and eggs.|$|R

5000|$|Cougar Gold is an American <b>Cheddar</b> <b>cheese</b> {{produced}} at the Washington State University Creamery in Pullman, Washington. Like other cheeses {{sold at the}} creamery, Cougar Gold is notable for being sold exclusively in 30oz tin cans. Cougar Gold is a white, <b>sharp</b> <b>cheddar</b> that is aged at least one year. It has a nutty flavor somewhat resembling Swiss or Gouda. When properly refrigerated, Cougar Gold is claimed to last indefinitely in the can. An unopened can becomes more flavorful, sharp, dry and crumbly with age. Approximately 250,000 cans of Cougar Cheese are produced annually, with around 80% of it being Cougar Gold.|$|R

40|$|The use of slower acid-producing starter {{bacteria}} for {{the production}} of lower fat <b>Cheddar</b> <b>cheese</b> has lead to milder flavor <b>Cheddar</b> <b>cheeses</b> that lack intense Cheddar notes. The metabolism of methionine leads to the production of methanethiol, {{which is one of the}} desirable <b>Cheddar</b> <b>cheese</b> flavor compounds. The influence of NaCl and reduced pH was determined for aminopeptidase, lipase/ esterase, and methanethiol-producing capability in selected lactic acid bacteria and brevibacteria in simulated cheese-like conditions. The activity of each enzyme decreased with NaCl addition and pH reduction to approximate a <b>Cheddar</b> <b>cheese</b> environment (5 % NaCl and pH 5. 2). The mechanism for methanethiol production by the starter and adjunct bacteria was also investigated. Different enzyme systems were found to be responsible for methanethiol production in starter lactococci, lactobacilli, and brevibacteria. In the lactococci, enzymes that acted primarily on cystathionine were responsible for methanethiol production from methionine. Lactobacilli also contained cystathionine-degrading enzymes, but these enzymes have properties different from the lactococcal enzymes. Brevibacterium linensBL 2 lacked cystathionine-degrading enzymes, but was capable of the direct conversion of methionine to methanethiol. L-Methionine γ-lyase from B. linens BL 2 was purified to homogeneity, and was found to catalyze the α, γ elimination of methionine resulting in the production of methanethiol, α-ketobutyrate, and ammonia. Characterization of the pure enzyme demonstrated that it is pyridoxal phosphate dependent, which is active at salt and pH conditions existing in ripening <b>Cheddar</b> <b>cheese.</b> The addition of either B. linens BL 2 or L-methionine γ-lyase to aseptic cheese curd slurries increased methanethiol and total volatile sulfur compound production. In an attempt to increase methanethiol production and <b>Cheddar</b> <b>cheese</b> flavor in reduced-fat <b>Cheddar</b> <b>cheese,</b> B. linens BL 2 was added as a starter adjunct to 60 % reduced-fat cheese. Sensory evaluation of the cheese indicated that B. linens BL 2 improved the flavor of 60 % reduced-fat <b>Cheddar</b> <b>cheese.</b> This suggests that the addition of B. linens BL 2 is an alternative to the addition of lactic acid bacteria to improve <b>Cheddar</b> <b>cheese</b> flavor via the metabolism of methionine...|$|R
50|$|Seven-layer {{salad is}} an American dish that {{includes}} a colorful combination of seven layers of ingredients: iceberg lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, onions, sweet peas, hard boiled eggs, <b>sharp</b> <b>cheddar</b> <b>cheese,</b> and bacon pieces. The salad is topped with a mayonnaise-based dressing and sometimes sour cream is added. It is served in a glass bowl or large pan so the layers can be observed. The dish {{is often associated with}} potlucks, picnics, and barbecues, where a large gathering of people takes place and many people need to be fed. There are many variants on the seven-layer salad and it can be made with additional (or sometimes fewer) layers, making it (for example) an eight-layer salad instead.|$|E

5000|$|Popular in the 1950s as {{a comfort}} food, the grilled cheese {{sandwich}} {{has made a}} comeback in various incarnations in the 1990s and 2000s. It was estimated in 2001 that Americans consume around 2.2 billion grilled cheese sandwiches yearly, and chefs have experimented with different types of bread and cheese in updates of the classic cheese dream of yore. Pumpernickel, dark brown, and rye breads have been used, topped with Swiss cheese, Gouda, and havarti respectively. Other options include apples with mozzarella, peaches with edam, and pear with gorgonzola or brie; Italian herbs, sun-dried tomatoes and mozzarella; or turkey and ham, with which [...] "a variation on a Monte Cristo" [...] can also be created.

50|$|Inside the train, {{the cars}} were lavishly furnished. Each car was clad in circassian walnut with a gold inlay pattern. The headliners were cream colored. Window shades were made of blue Spanish pantasote. The luggage racks were nickel-plated. Each car had a {{drinking}} fountain by the North Pole Sanitary Drinking Fountain company of Chicago. Collapsible cone-shaped paper cups with the train's logo were available via a dispenser above the fountain. Coaches were fitted out with 64 individual seats which rotated, nickel-plated coat hooks, and umbrella holders mounted {{to the back of}} the seats. Upholstery was Persian Blue, rendered in figured mohair. The seats were triple-cushioned, 48 rattan lounge chairs in silver and blue lined either side of the observation car. These were upholstered in Persian blue Avalon plush, with a gold-tinted floral pattern. The coaches and combines had a men's lavatory and toilet located at one end of the car on opposite sides of the aisle. The coaches and observation car were fitted out with a generous women's lounge with an adjoining toilet. The lounge had a full-length mirror, two wicker arm chairs, a boudoir chair, and a cup and towel vendor. The floor covering was a Persian blue carpet with a gold modern pattern. The combines had 48 blue leather bucket seats. The flooring was a blue-and-cream diagonal checkerboard linoleum tile. This same flooring was utilized in the vestibules and lavatories as well as the observation platform. The dining car could accommodate 36 patrons. Porters in blue uniforms served savory dishes and homemade goodies. The tables were set with the finest embroidered blue tablecloths with the train's logo, special china and flatware, and a silver base lamp with parchment shade. The lampshades had an astral pattern of comets and stars, and tinted lightbulbs were employed to cast a soft blue glow. Apparently the fresh apple pie with a slice of <b>sharp</b> <b>cheddar</b> <b>cheese</b> was a popular offering. Each train consisted of a baggage car, combine-smoker, coaches, and an observation car. The diner accompanied the early morning trip to Atlantic City and the evening return to Jersey City.|$|E

40|$|A {{detailed}} {{investigation was}} undertaken {{to determine the}} effects of four single starter strains, Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis 303, Lc. lactis subsp. cremoris HP, Lc. lactis subsp. cremoris AM 2, and Lactobacillus helveticus DPC 4571 on the proteolytic, lipolytic and sensory characteristics of <b>Cheddar</b> <b>cheese.</b> Cheeses produced using the highly autolytic starters 4571 and AM 2 positively impacted on flavour development, whereas cheeses produced from the poorly autolytic starters 303 and HP developed off-flavours. Starter selection impacted significantly on the proteolytic and sensory characteristics of the resulting <b>Cheddar</b> <b>cheeses.</b> It appeared that the autolytic and/or lipolytic properties of starter strains also influenced lipolysis, however lipolysis appeared to be limited due to a possible lack of availability or access to suitable milk fat substrates over ripening. The impact of lipolysis on the sensory characteristics of <b>Cheddar</b> <b>cheese</b> was unclear, possibly due to minimal differences in the extent of lipolysis between the cheeses at the end of ripening. As anticipated seasonal milk supply influenced both proteolysis and lipolysis in <b>Cheddar</b> <b>cheese.</b> The contribution of non-starter lactic acid bacteria towards proteolysis and lipolysis over the first 8 months of <b>Cheddar</b> <b>cheese</b> ripening was negligible...|$|R
