5|$|The {{game is a}} {{collection}} of five sports simulations, designed to demonstrate the motion-sensing capabilities of the Wii Remote to new players. The five sports included are tennis, baseball, bowling, golf, and boxing. Players use the Wii Remote to mimic actions performed in real-life sports, such as <b>swinging</b> <b>a</b> tennis racket. The rules for each game are simplified to make them more accessible to new players. The game also features training and fitness modes that monitor players' progress in the sports.|$|E
5|$|Combat {{takes place}} in real-time. Located {{at the bottom of}} the screen is a power bar, a gauge that determines the amount of damage done to an enemy when attacking. <b>Swinging</b> <b>a</b> weapon causes the gauge to empty and then quickly recharge, {{allowing}} that character to attack at full strength. The party wields eight different types of weaponry: sword, spear, bow, axe, boomerang, glove, whip, and javelin. All weapons can be upgraded eight times, and repeated use of a weapon increases its skill level to a maximum of eight, unlocking a new special attack with each level. Weapons are upgraded with Weapon Orbs, which are found in dungeons or earned by defeating certain bosses. The player takes each Orb to a blacksmith, located in most towns, who uses it to reforge one weapon.|$|E

5|$|In {{some cases}} of Batesian-Wallacian mimicry, {{the model is}} a sexually {{receptive}} female, which provides a strong attractive effect on males. Some spiders use chemical rather than visual means to ensnare prey. Female bolas spiders of the genus Mastophora lure male moth-flies (Diptera, true flies, but resembling moths) by producing analogues of the moth species' sex pheromones. Each species of spider appears to specialize in a particular species of prey in the family Psychodidae. Juveniles use their front pair of legs to capture prey, such as flies. Older spiders use a different strategy however, <b>swinging</b> <b>a</b> sticky ball known as a bolas suspended by a silk thread at moths. But both old and juvenile are able to lure prey via this olfactory signal; even young spiderlings {{have been shown to}} attract prey species.|$|E
5|$|Since 1963, {{the custom}} in most {{years has been}} to start the tournament with an honorary opening tee shot at the first hole, {{typically}} {{by one or more}} legendary players. The original honorary starters were Jock Hutchison and Fred McLeod; this twosome led off every tournament from 1963 until 1973, when poor health prevented Hutchison from <b>swinging</b> <b>a</b> club. McLeod continued on until his death in 1976. Byron Nelson and Gene Sarazen started in 1981, and were then joined by Sam Snead in 1984. This trio continued until 1999 when Sarazen died, while Nelson stopped in 2001. Snead hit his final opening tee shot in 2002, a little over a month before he died.|$|E
5|$|Giles' dream {{begins with}} Giles <b>swinging</b> <b>a</b> watch {{in front of}} Buffy. They are in Giles' apartment, which has been {{stripped}} of furniture but for a chair and a bed. She laughs, and Giles' dream cuts to a family scene with Buffy and his girlfriend Olivia at a fairground. Quicker than the others to understand that something is wrong, he confronts Spike, who is posing for a photo-shoot in his crypt. In The Bronze, he meets Anya failing as a stand-up comic, and Willow and Xander (with a bloody chest wound), who warn him of their attacker. He breaks into song, giving {{suggestions on how to}} deal with what hunts them, but when the sound system breaks down, he crawls backstage to trace a wiring fault. He begins to realize his pursuer is the First Slayer, just as she scalps him.|$|E

5|$|Mario & Sonic on the Wii and DS is a {{collection}} of twenty-four events based on the Olympic Games. Players can assume the role of a Nintendo or Sega character while competing against the others in these events. Players use the Wii Remote to mimic actions performed in real life sports, such as <b>swinging</b> <b>a</b> paddle. The DS version uses the stylus and button controls. Both games closely follow rules and regulations of the specific sports. Sega adopted the IOC's mission of promoting a sporting spirit and its desire to interest young people in the Olympics by using its characters. Due to this atmosphere of competitive sportsmanship, Sega received approval by Nintendo to include Mario in the game with Sonic. Sonic the Hedgehog is the protagonist of the video game series released by Sega in order to provide the company with a mascot to rival Nintendo's flagship character Mario in the early 1990s.|$|E
5|$|The dragon man was {{believed}} to act similar to the mythological dragon: {{as soon as he}} saw bad weather approaching, which he knew was brought by an ala, he would leave whatever he was doing, and fly up to confront the demon. This he did by falling into a deep sleep, or entering a state similar to death, usually at the very spot where he happened to be at that time. His soul then left his body in the form of a snake or a lizard, and soared skywards. It was claimed that he was not breathing as long as his soul was absent from his body. The battle could last for a whole day, or even for several days, during which time the man lay unconscious, sweating profusely from the exertion of the fight. There was a danger that, during the course of the battle, the ala might approach the man's body and harm him, which could be prevented by someone <b>swinging</b> <b>a</b> blade above him, or by sticking the blade at the lying man's head. He should not be pushed or moved while in this state: if he was not in the same position as when he fell asleep, his soul would not be able to return into his body, and he would die. When he woke up after the battle with the ala, he was very tired. Apart from these characteristics, the dragon man was seen as an ordinary human.|$|E

Typically aggressive slinging (<b>swinging</b> <b>a</b> player by the jumper or throwing the player to the ground) of oppositions players in a tackle is not allowed. Like the men's game, head high contact is strictly not allowed.|$|E
25|$|The {{position}} and motion tracking of the Wii Remote allows the player to mimic actual game actions, such as <b>swinging</b> <b>a</b> sword or aiming a gun, {{instead of simply}} pressing buttons. An early marketing video showed actors miming actions such as fishing, cooking, drumming, conducting a musical ensemble, shooting a gun, sword fighting, and performing dental surgery.|$|E

25|$|A life-size {{statue of}} Wagner <b>swinging</b> <b>a</b> bat, atop a marble {{pedestal}} featuring admiring children, was forged {{by a local}} sculptor named Frank Vittor, and placed outside the left field corner gate at Forbes Field. It was dedicated on April 30, 1955, and the then-frail Wagner was well enough to attend and wave to his many fans. The Pirates have relocated twice since then, and the statue has come along with them. It now stands outside the main gate of PNC Park. The statue roughly faces {{the site of the}} Pirates' original home, Exposition Park, so in a sense Wagner has come full circle.|$|E
25|$|In the 1880s, the University of Pennsylvania {{sponsored}} Muybridge's {{research using}} banks of cameras to photograph {{people in a}} studio, and animals from the Philadelphia Zoo to study their movement. The human models, either entirely nude or very lightly clothed, were photographed against a measured grid background {{in a variety of}} action sequences, including walking up or down stairs, hammering on an anvil, carrying buckets of water, or throwing water over one another. Muybridge produced sequences showing farm, industrial, construction, and household work, military maneuvers, and everyday activities. He also photographed athletic activities such as baseball, cricket, boxing, wrestling, discus throwing, and a ballet dancer performing. Showing a single-minded dedication to scientific accuracy and artistic composition, Muybridge himself posed nude for some of the photographic sequences, such as one showing him <b>swinging</b> <b>a</b> miner's pick.|$|E

25|$|Before the 18th century, {{science courses}} were taught almost {{exclusively}} through formal lectures. The structure of courses {{began to change}} in {{the first decades of the}} 18th century, when physical demonstrations were added to lectures. Pierre Polinière and Jacques Rohault were among the first individuals to provide demonstrations of physical principles in the classroom. Experiments ranged from <b>swinging</b> <b>a</b> bucket of water at the end of a rope, demonstrating that centrifugal force would hold the water in the bucket, to more impressive experiments involving the use of an air-pump. One particularly dramatic air-pump demonstration involved placing an apple inside the glass receiver of the air-pump, and removing air until the resulting vacuum caused the apple to explode. Polinière’s demonstrations were so impressive that he was granted an invitation to present his course to Louis XV in 1722.|$|E
25|$|With {{gunpowder}} being increasingly {{applied to}} mining, rock chunks from a mining face became much larger, and the blast dependent mining itself had become dependent upon an organized group, {{not just an}} individual <b>swinging</b> <b>a</b> pick. Economies of scale gradually infused industrial enterprises, while transport became a key bottleneck as the volume of moved materials continued to increase following demand. This spurred numerous canal projects, inspired laying first wooden, then iron protected rails using draft animals to pull loads in the emerging bulk goods transportation dependent economy. In the coal industry, which grew up hand in hand as the preferred fuel for smelting ores, crushing and preparation (cleaning) was performed for {{over a hundred years}} in coal breakers, massive noisy buildings full of conveyors, belt-powered trip-hammer crushing stages and giant metal grading/sorting grates. Like mine pumps, the internal conveyors and trip-hammers contained within these 711 story buildings.|$|E
25|$|Sting's {{first world}} {{championship}} reign ended January 11, 1991, when Flair defeated {{him in a}} rematch from Starrcade. In the same month, WCW seceded from the National Wrestling Alliance, in the process recognizing a WCW World Heavyweight Championship and a WCW World Tag Team Championship. Sting then took part in what many consider {{to be one of}} the best matches of 1991, teaming with Luger to face The Steiner Brothers at the first SuperBrawl pay-per-view. The Steiners won by pinfall after Koloff, who had been feuding with Luger, interfered in the match by <b>swinging</b> <b>a</b> chain at Luger but hitting Sting instead. Consequently, Sting feuded with Koloff throughout the summer of 1991. In August 1991, Sting defeated Steve Austin to win a tournament for the vacated WCW United States Heavyweight Championship. Sting held the title for 86 days before losing it to Rick Rude at Clash of the Champions XVII.|$|E
