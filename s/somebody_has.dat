5|$|Meanwhile, Dana Scully finds black oil in de la Cruz's skull {{during an}} autopsy—the oil {{is dead and}} {{seems to have been}} irradiated. She concludes that he may have had some {{immunity}} to the black oil because he is a Huecha Indian, or an indigenous Mexican national. Doggett and Mulder find proof of black oil on the platform and quarantine it, but de la Cruz's friend Diego Garza is missing. Ortega threatens to bring back the crew unless the agents can provide proof of an infection. Doggett and Mulder search for Garza who, like de la Cruz, also has Native American heritage. Mulder and Doggett later discover that <b>somebody</b> <b>has</b> set fire to the communications room. As the agents tackle the fire, Garza attacks Doggett and renders him unconscious. When he awakens, Garza, now mentally unstable, cuts his arm to check for the presence of black oil.|$|E

25|$|I {{am proud}} of what I did and would do it again. Jasenovac was a legal {{institution}} based on law, where all those proved to have worked {{for the destruction of}} the Croatian state, and who had been dangerous for public order and safety, were interned. Considering the duration and population of the camp, the death rate was natural and normal. If we shot people, we did it {{on the basis of the}} law. There are no states in the world that don't have prisons and camps, and <b>somebody</b> <b>has</b> to perform this thankless duty. I regret that we hadn't done all that is imputed to us, for, had we done that then, today Croatia would not have had problems. There wouldn't have been people to write these lies.|$|E

500|$|The bleakness of the {{painting}} is informed by the artist's harsh nihilism and existentialist view of life. Bacon was Catholic, but according to his friend and biographer Michael Peppiatt, when he found {{he could no longer}} believe he was [...] "extremely disappointed and furious, and anybody with a scrap of religious belief... he would go for them". [...] Peppiatt makes the observation of Bacon that [...] "if <b>somebody</b> <b>has</b> that intensity, its almost a faith in and of itself".|$|E
500|$|The stress {{fracture}} theory {{was supported by}} the testimony of former crewmen. Former Second Mate Richard Orgel, who served on Fitzgerald in 1972 and 1973, testified that [...] "the ship had a tendency to bend and spring during storms 'like a diving board after <b>somebody</b> <b>has</b> jumped off. Orgel was quoted as saying that the loss of Fitzgerald was caused by hull failure, [...] "pure and simple. I detected undue stress in the side tunnels by examining the white enamel paint, which will crack and splinter when submitted to severe stress." [...] George H. [...] "Red" [...] Burgner, Fitzgeralds steward for ten seasons and winter ship-keeper for seven years, testified in a deposition that a [...] "loose keel" [...] contributed to the vessel's loss. Burgner further testified that [...] "the keel and sister kelsons were only 'tack welded'" [...] and that he had personally observed that many of the welds were broken. Burgner was not asked to testify before the Marine Board of Inquiry.|$|E

500|$|At the 2010 Commonwealth Games, Vijender Singh {{was beaten}} by England's Anthony Ogogo in the semi-finals. Leading 3–0 on points {{going into the}} final round, Singh was twice given a {{two-point}} penalty by Canadian referee Michael Summers, the second for coming just 20 seconds {{before the end of}} the bout, leading Ogogo to win by 4 points to 3. The Indian Boxing Federation (IBF) launched an unsuccessful appeal, leaving Singh with a bronze medal. IBF Secretary General P K Muralidharan Raja said, [...] "The jury reviewed the bout and came to the conclusion that Vijender was holding his opponent and the referee was right in warning him. When the Indian team pointed out that even Ogogo was holding Vijender, the jury felt it was not the case." [...] Singh lashed out saying that the penalties were [...] "harsh and unfair. The warnings were unfair and harsh. If the referee thought I was holding Ogogo then he should have penalised this guy as well. He was also holding me. It's a joke that <b>somebody</b> <b>has</b> won by scoring points just out of warnings." [...] One month later, in November, he won the 2010 Asian Games shutting out Uzbek two time world champion Abbos Atoev 7:0 in the final.|$|E
500|$|Attempts {{are governed}} by the Criminal Attempts Act 1981, which states that [...] "if, with intent to commit an offence to which , a person does an act {{which is more than}} merely preparatory to the {{commission}} of the offence, he is guilty of attempting to commit the offence". A required element is intent, or mens rea. In R v Pearman, the Court of Appeal of England and Wales confirmed that the definition of intent in the 1981 Act {{is the same as the}} definition in the common law. The common law gives intention [...] "its normal meaning: purpose or aim", with judges advised not to, in the majority of cases, attempt to complicate the definition. Conditional intent [...] where <b>somebody</b> <b>has</b> an intent to commit a crime only in certain circumstances [...] has also been deemed acceptable for an indictment for attempting a crime. In Attorney-General's Reference (Nos. 1 and 2 of 1979), the Court of Appeal explained that the intention to steal [...] "anything that was worth stealing could form the basis of an attempt charge if the indictment was drafted carefully". This was a procedural solution to a previous apparent contradiction, but the suggested drafting may not demonstrate sufficient proximity between the defendant's actions and what he was planning to steal. A mens rea requirement is added to the attempt of crimes of strict liability (where there is no intent or merely objective recklessness), although the ruling in Attorney General's Reference (No. 3 of 1992) makes this less certain.|$|E
500|$|In 1930, Birkett was {{involved}} in the so-called Blazing Car murder case. On 6 November 1930, two men returning home in Northampton noticed a bright light in the distance and saw a man come out of a ditch {{at the side of the}} road, glance back toward the light and say [...] "looks like <b>somebody</b> <b>has</b> had a bonfire". The two young men ran toward the light, saw it was a burning car and fetched a policeman. When the fires died away, a body was found inside the boot of a car with a face so charred it was impossible to determine the identity of the man; the numberplate of the car was intact, however, and traced to an Alfred Arthur Rouse. Rouse was arrested and appeared at Northampton Crown Court on 26 January 1931, charged with the murder of an unknown man. He was defended by Donald Finnemore, and the Crown was represented by Birkett and Richard Elwes. Rouse was damned by a series of events. When arrested, he made statements such as [...] "I'm very glad it's over" [...] and [...] "I'm responsible" [...] and that the car engine had been off at the time of the fire, ruling out the possibility of accidental ignition. When he appeared as a witness, the defendant claimed that after giving an unknown man a lift, he had found that he was running out of petrol and had asked the passenger to take the spare can in the car and fill up the fuel tank. While he was doing this, Rouse testified that he went to the side of the road to urinate, and while there heard a large explosion. He said he saw a large flame and became convinced the petrol tank would explode. As such he ran away as fast as possible, at which point he ran into the two young men on the road.|$|E

The act's purpose was to prevent {{firearms}} manufacturers and dealers from being held liable for negligence when crimes have been committed with their products. In 2015, Sanders defended his vote, saying: [...] "If <b>somebody</b> <b>has</b> a gun and it falls {{into the hands of}} a murderer and the murderer kills somebody with a gun, do you hold the gun manufacturer responsible? Not any more than you would hold a hammer company responsible if somebody beats somebody over the head with a hammer." ...|$|E
2500|$|Although the {{application}} process attracted little comment at the time, a controversy broke {{out after the}} ICM's plans were approved. At the commission's next meeting, on June 17, 2010, more than 600 people, some wearing Christian- or patriotic-themed clothes, turned out to protest its approval of the ICM's plans. Many said they had {{become aware of the}} plans only after they had been approved. Opponents were harshly critical both of the ICM and of Islam itself. Karen Harrell, a Murfreesboro resident, said: [...] "Everybody knows they are trying to kill us. People are really concerned about this. <b>Somebody</b> <b>has</b> to stand up and take this country back." ...|$|E

Smiling musicians with flowery clothes, jeans, long hair, beards and sunglasses play deliberate alien music, {{the kind that}} makes you shiver. It fills {{the room to the}} ceiling pushing against the walls. They sing in voices that should have belonged to Druids or Incas, or Gypsies under a night sky, and you see Jesus smiling at them. When you leave you feel <b>somebody</b> <b>has</b> been dissecting your soul and everything is clearer. And that's what an Electric Mass is." ...|$|E

However, it was later revealed that Ryun and Foley had hosted a joint fundraiser on their street on May 18, 2006, called the [...] "D Street Block Party." [...] An invitation to the fundraiser included side-by-side pictures of Ryun and Foley. Ryun's campaign manager later said that Ryun had always known he was Foley's neighbor.|$|E

2500|$|According to Margaret Wertheim, [...] "History abounds with {{religious}} enthusiasts who have read spiritual portent into {{the arrangement of}} the planets, the vacuum of space, electromagnetic waves and the big bang. But no scientific discovery has proved so ripe for spiritual projection as the theories of quantum physics, replete with their quixotic qualities of uncertainty, simultaneity and parallelism." [...] Wertheim continues that the movie [...] "abandons itself entirely to the ecstasies of quantum mysticism, finding in this aleatory description of nature the key to spiritual transformation. As one of the film’s characters gushes early in the proceedings, 'The moment we acknowledge the quantum self, we say that <b>somebody</b> <b>has</b> become enlightened'. [...] A moment in which 'the mathematical formalisms of quantum mechanics [...] are stripped of all empirical content and reduced to a set of syrupy nostrums'." ...|$|E
2500|$|Among the {{influences}} on Monty Python, {{the members of}} the comedy team are described as being [...] "indebted to BBC radio comedy, and particularly to the Goon Show." [...] The future members of Monty Python were fans, and on many occasions they expressed their collective debt to Milligan and The Goons. Scudamore (1985, p.170) cites an interview for example, in which John Cleese stated [...] "the Goon Show influenced us enormously". He reiterates this point in his contribution to Ventham's (2002, p.151) book: [...] "We all loved The Goon Show in the Monty Python Team: it ignited some energy in us. It was more a spirit that was passed on, rather than any particular technique. The point is that once <b>somebody</b> <b>has</b> crossed a barrier and done something that has never been done before, it is terribly easy for everybody else to cross it".|$|E

Bhushan defended Arundhati Roy when she was charged with contempt of court for publicly criticising judges in the dam hearings. In March 2002 she was sentenced to one day in jail.
