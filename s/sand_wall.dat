5|$|Operation Badr was {{preceded by}} {{training}} exercises starting in 1968, operational planning from 1971 onwards and a deception operation. In the opening stages of the attack, known as The Crossing (العبور; al-'obour), combat engineers used water cannons to rapidly clear numerous passages through the <b>sand</b> <b>wall</b> lining the east bank of the canal, laid bridges and operated ferries, allowing armor to cross. Egyptian infantry assaulted the Bar-Lev fortifications and were counterattacked by Israeli armor and infantry.|$|E
5|$|The troops {{tasked with}} {{isolating}} Fort Lahtzanit began crossing the canal in dinghies at 2:15p.m.. Ten minutes later {{they reached the}} east bank and proceeded to climb the <b>sand</b> <b>wall.</b> They succeeded in attracting Israeli fire, thereby facilitating the main assault force in its mission to attack the fort later on. The troops tasked with isolating the fort from the east reached and occupied a firing ramp prepared for tanks, and raised the Egyptian flag over it. This severely demoralized the Israeli soldiers inside Fort Lahtzanit. Soon after the Sa'iqa company (less one platoon) arrived at the firing ramp as well.|$|E
5|$|At 15:30, Egyptian forces {{captured}} Fort Lahtzanit, {{the first}} fortification of the Bar Lev Line to fall, {{and by then}} the infantry had been reinforced with 82mm B-10 and 107mm B-11 rifles. At the same time, engineers began operating their water pumps against the <b>sand</b> <b>wall,</b> opening the first passage {{in less than an}} hour, and the Egyptians moved up their bridging units to the canal. By 16:30 eight waves had brought across the canal ten infantry brigades in all five bridgeheads, totaling 23,500 men (around 4,700 at each bridgehead). Each bridgehead was on average six kilometers (3¾ mi) wide and around two kilometers deep. The Egyptians had high-velocity 85mm and 100mm rifled anti-tank guns in action on the east bank by that time.|$|E
50|$|The Egyptian Army put {{great effort}} into finding {{a quick and}} {{effective}} way of breaching the Israeli defenses. The Israelis had built large 18 metre (59 foot) high <b>sand</b> <b>walls</b> with a 60 degree slope and reinforced with concrete at the water line. Egyptian engineers initially experimented with explosive charges and bulldozers to clear the obstacles, before a junior officer proposed using high pressure water cannons. The idea was tested and {{found to be a}} sound one, and several high pressure water cannons were imported from Britain and East Germany. The water cannons effectively breached the <b>sand</b> <b>walls</b> using water from the canal.|$|R

50|$|The {{palmetto}} {{was added}} in 1861, also {{a reference to}} Moultrie's defense of Sullivan's Island; the fortress he'd constructed had survived largely because the palmettos, laid over <b>sand</b> <b>walls,</b> were able to withstand British cannon.|$|R
5|$|Egyptian troops {{raised their}} {{national}} flag {{on the eastern}} bank of the canal at 14:35. By that time company and battalion-size units of Israeli tanks and infantry began reaching the Bar Lev Line, but were prevented from reaching their positions by Egyptian ambushes. Those tanks that broke through came under fire {{from the west bank}} ramparts. At 14:45, a second wave of infantry landed on the opposite bank. Subsequent waves of infantry arrived at fifteen-minute intervals. However, after the fourth wave, fatigue and technical problems with the boats gradually widened the time intervals. The Egyptians abandoned their schedules, giving priority to anti-tank teams and weaponry that could critically affect the battle. Amphibious vehicles were also used to cross equipment. The wooden carts were ferried to the east bank via boats, where they were initially lifted {{to the top of the}} <b>sand</b> <b>wall</b> with their loads. However, this method proved clumsy, and the carts were first emptied then lifted, after which they were re-loaded and dragged to troops on the front line. The carts greatly facilitated the supply and transportation of matériel on the east bank.|$|E
5|$|With {{the start}} of the fire preparation, tank hunting detachments—groups of ten {{equipped}} with RPG-7 rockets, RPG-43 grenades, and AT-3 Sagger missiles—crossed the canal to deploy one kilometer deep, quickly occupying the tank ramparts, and proceeded to set up ambushes and lay mines. When the first barrage ended, Egyptian artillery began a second, 22 minute-long barrage, against targets at a depth of 1.5–3kilometers. At this time, 14:20, the first wave of assault infantry, 4,000 men, began crossing the canal. Around 2,500 dinghies and wooden boats were used to transport the troops. Smoke canisters were used at the crossing points to provide cover. During the night of October 5, engineers had blocked the underwater pipes on the opposite bank, preventing the Israelis from releasing flammable oil into the canal and igniting it. The first wave was lightly equipped, armed with RPG-7s, Strela 2 AA missiles and rope ladders to deploy on the <b>sand</b> <b>wall.</b> Among the first wave were combat engineers and several units of Sa'iqa (lightning; these were commando forces), who were tasked with setting up ambushes on reinforcement routes. The Sa'iqa attacked command posts and artillery batteries in order to deny the Israelis control over their forces, while the engineers breached the minefields and barbed wire surrounding Israeli defenses. Immediately following them, military engineers transported the water pumps to the opposite bank and began setting them up. At this time Egyptian aircraft involved in the air strike began returning. Five aircraft were lost, although {{by the end of the}} day this rose to ten. The air strike put the Bir Gifgafa and Bir Thamada air bases out of operation for 48 hours, and damaged the Ras Nasrani and Bir Hasanah airbases. Around ten HAWK batteries, at least two 175mm artillery batteries, an electronic jamming center at Umm Khashib, and various radar stations were destroyed. This allowed the Egyptian Air Force to operate for the rest of the war without any ground-based communications interference, as the only other jamming center in the Sinai was located at el-Arish, considerably behind the front. Over a dozen AS-5 Kelt missiles were fired from Tu-16 bombers as well. Several were shot down, but at least five hit their targets, including two missiles fitted with anti-radiation seekers that knocked out Israeli radars. The success of the air strike caused the Egyptians to cancel a planned second air strike. Another account however states that 18 Egyptian aircraft were lost, and these losses prompted the canceling of a second wave of airstrikes.|$|E
25|$|In the Yom Kippur War {{some of the}} strongpoints stopped Egyptian forces, but {{the line}} was under-planned, and too few {{soldiers}} kept to the firing points. Because the <b>sand</b> <b>wall</b> proved to be surprisingly vulnerable to water cannons, the line delayed the assaulting forces for nine to sixteen hours instead of the expected 48 hours, but this delay was sufficient for to Israeli armour to mobilise. The few excavated passages did not allow Egyptian forces to transport sufficient resupply for attacking forces which significantly contributed to their defeat.|$|E

25|$|From {{the mid-1980s}} Morocco largely {{managed to keep}} Polisario troops off by {{building}} a huge berm or <b>sand</b> <b>wall</b> (the Moroccan Wall), staffed by an army, enclosing within it the economically useful parts of Western Sahara (Bou Craa, El-Aaiun, Smara, etc.) This stalemated the war, with no side able to achieve decisive gains, but artillery strikes and sniping attacks by the Polisario continued, and Morocco was economically and politically strained by the war. Today Polisario controls {{the part of the}} Western Sahara on the east of the Moroccan Wall, comprising {{about a third of the}} territory, but this area is economically useless, heavily mined, and almost uninhabited.|$|E
500|$|In any {{crossing}} of the Suez Canal by Egyptian forces, success was highly dependent {{on the performance of}} the Egyptian Corps of Engineers, which had several daunting tasks to accomplish. Israeli engineers had constructed a massive artificial sand barrier spanning [...] of the canal's east bank (except for the Great Bitter Lake, where the width of the canal made a crossing unlikely). To prevent erosion, the sand barrier was supported by concrete, which was one metre (3⅓ ft) above the water at high tide, and three metres (10ft) above water at low tide. The canal was [...] wide and approximately [...] deep. Engineers had to clear seventy passages through this <b>sand</b> <b>wall,</b> each seven metres (23ft) wide. This meant the removal of [...] of sand for each passage. Initially, conventional methods were tested for breaching the <b>sand</b> <b>wall.</b> It was found that, to clear a single passage required 60 men, 1 bulldozer, 600lb of explosives and five to six hours, uninterrupted by enemy fire. Since the crossing sites would likely be congested and under enemy fire, these methods proved to be impractical and too costly.|$|E
500|$|The Israelis had {{constructed}} {{a series of}} fortifications along the canal called the Bar Lev Line, which was considered impregnable. The main obstacle of these defences was a massive artificial <b>sand</b> <b>wall</b> erected by Israeli engineers, [...] high with a 45–60 degree incline, along the entire Suez Canal. The rampart were reinforced by concrete that also prevented any attempt by amphibious vehicles to climb the <b>sand</b> <b>wall.</b> To blast through the sand barrier the Israelis estimated would take at least twenty-four, probably forty-eight hours. Behind this rampart were a series of 22 fortifications comprising 35 strongpoints. On average, the fortifications were [...] apart. A strongpoint was several stories deep into the sand and provided protection from a 1000-pound (~½ ton) bomb. Strongpoints incorporated trenches, barbed wire, minefields 200 meters deep, numerous bunkers and troop shelters, and firing positions for tanks. Each strongpoint had an underground reservoir filled with crude oil. The oil could be pumped into the Suez Canal via a pipe system, and ignited to create temperatures reaching [...] A second defensive line, [...] behind the main line, was concentrated at likely crossing areas, and designed to be occupied by armored forces, incorporating tank firing positions. A third defensive line, [...] behind the sand rampart, had its defences concentrated on the main roads and principal routes of advance for an attacker. Behind the main line on the canal were concentration areas for armor and infantry, supply depots, numerous artillery positions and so forth.|$|E
50|$|In {{the times}} of the Duchy of Courland, the castle was {{destroyed}} and rebuilt many times. In {{the sixteenth and seventeenth}} century <b>sand</b> <b>walls</b> were erected around the castle. They had a bastion {{in each of the four}} corners and a stockade. Later the castle was used as a residence for local German landlords. The castle was destroyed in the eighteenth century.Many famous people have visited the castle, for example: Duke Jacob Kettler of Courland, The King of Sweden, Carl XII and the King of Prussia, Friedrich Wilhelm III.|$|R
5000|$|Contai (also {{known as}} Kanthi) is {{headquarters}} of Contai subdivision in Purba Medinipur district, West Bengal, India. There are three community development blocks in Contai.

Kanthi, that is contai, means [...] "Sand-bound reefs" [...] or <b>sand</b> <b>walls.</b> The name Contai may thus be an English expression of the local jargon meaning [...] "sand heaps".|$|R
50|$|However, {{there were}} suspicions that the {{building}} of the <b>sand</b> <b>walls</b> did not actually occur, because the incident took place in the ninth lunar month (mid autumn) and the weather was not cold enough to cause water to freeze. The historian Pei Songzhi commented that the Wei Shu stated that Cao Cao's army reached Tong Pass in the eighth lunar month and crossed the Wei River to the north bank in the same month. The weather could not possibly be that cold in the eighth month (late summer / early autumn) to cause water to freeze.|$|R
500|$|Fort Orkal, [...] {{south of}} Port Fouad, was also {{isolated}} prior to an attack. The Egyptians approached by land from Port Fouad, {{and across the}} Suez Canal. The attack quickly {{ground to a halt}} as the force approaching from the north failed to breach the minefield, leaving the force attacking across the canal pinned down at the <b>sand</b> <b>wall</b> by enemy fire. Subsequently, an infantry company crossed and renewed the attack from the south, seizing several positions. Reinforcements soon allowed more positions to be captured. On October 7, the remaining defenders made a break-out attempt to join friendly forces, but they were intercepted and either killed or captured.|$|E
500|$|As Sadek {{continued}} to refuse {{the concept of}} a limited war, tensions rose between him and Sadat. Following a heated meeting of senior commanders, the Minister of War was sacked. His replacement, Major General Ahmed Ismail, was in favor of a limited offensive. The High Minarets {{continued to}} be developed as the only viable offensive plan, with the spring of 1973 being a possible launch date. Based on intelligence estimates, the main Israeli counterattacks would take place 6–8 hours after the assault began by three armored divisions, while armored support for the crossing would not be available before at least 12 hours. To deal with this, Egyptian infantry would be supplied with large numbers of anti-tank guided missiles (ATGM) and rocket propelled grenades (RPG). The portable anti-tank weapons were principally the RPG-7 and the less numerous wire-guided AT-3 Sagger, as well as hundreds of recoilless rifles and conventional weapons. The manually guided Sagger missile had a long range and a powerful warhead but suffered from low velocity in flight, allowing the target (such as a tank) time to take evasive maneuver or return fire. Its minimum range of [...] created a significant area of dead ground, which was to be covered by the RPG, along with the B-10 and B-11 recoilless rifles. In addition, there were RPG-43 anti-tank grenades. Assault infantry were equipped with night vision devices, infrared scopes, and welder's goggles to counter a tactic often used by the Israelis; mounting xenon floodlights on tanks and vehicles to blind enemy infantry at night. To allow the infantry to carry an assortment of heavy weaponry—ATGMs, RPGs, flamethrowers, machine guns, and mines—before the bridges were laid, was achieved by two steps. Firstly, five different field kits were created that were lighter, accommodated larger water bottles and could carry 24 hours' food supply. Each field kit was specifically designed {{to meet the needs of}} the various assault teams. The other solution was to use four-wheel wooden carts to transport equipment, weaponry and ammunition. Over 2,200 such carts would be used in the crossing, providing the capacity to transport nearly 330tons (150,000lb) of matériel. Rope ladders with wooden steps would be deployed to lift ammunition and heavy equipment, such as the B-11 recoilless rifle, to the top of the <b>sand</b> <b>wall.</b>|$|E

2500|$|While the {{elliptical}} <b>sand</b> <b>wall</b> was for {{blocking high}} sea winds and blown sand, concrete structures were {{integrated into the}} wall and under the ground to protect equipment and personnel from rocket explosions and enemy bombing (a sand-filled dummy warhead, called [...] "the elephant", was normally used). [...] A large gap in the wall allowed easy entry by vehicles (particularly railcars with propellants), and an open tunnel through the ellipse wall at the narrower southern end also allowed entry. Integrated into the ellipse wall next to the tunnel was a massive observation and measuring blockhouse containing the control center. [...] The control center had a double door with a bulletproof glass window from which an observer maintained telephone communication with the Telemetering Building at a remote location from P-7. [...] A receiver in a lighthouse near Koserow provided telemetry from rockets with the Wolman System for Doppler tracking.
