25|$|Pfizer {{is one of}} {{the single}} largest {{lobbying}} interests in United States politics. For example, in the first 9 months of 2009 Pfizer spent over $16.3million on lobbying US congressional lawmakers, making them the sixth largest lobbying interest in the US (following Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA), which ranked fourth but also represents many of their interests). A spokeswoman for Pfizer said the company “wanted to make <b>sure</b> <b>our</b> voice is heard in this conversation” in regards to the company's expenditure of $25million in 2010 to lobby health care reform.|$|E
500|$|Discussing the {{progression}} from MercyMe's first album Almost There to {{the songs on}} Spoken For, [...] MercyMe's lead singer Bart Millard said in an interview: [...] "Our goal early on was to make <b>sure</b> <b>our</b> songs were 'singable' {{and make sure they}} fit on power point because we wanted to write songs for corporate worship. Spoken For is filled with songs that I pray the church will use." [...] He added that this album leaned more toward rock than Almost There. Millard said [...] of the origin of the album title: [...] "Over the last year I’ve been consumed with the idea that God is so crazy in love with us—just knowing that we are part of something bigger and we worship a God who’s in complete control no matter how good or bad things get. The phrase [...] "spoken for" [...] really stuck with me." ...|$|E
500|$|Hamlin, who led {{the most}} laps, {{described}} his frustration: [...] "The strategy and what-not at the end just didn't work our way. That's all I can ask for, {{is to have the}} better car than those two guys – and we did. But, unfortunately, the strategy bit us. We're {{just going to have to}} go there and do it the old-fashioned way next week and try to beat them on the race track." [...] Afterward, Newman, who finished second, commented, [...] "We were saving fuel the whole time. Made more sense to save fuel. We were two laps short. We just did what I thought we needed to do. If Carl made it, Carl made it." [...] Fifth place finisher Johnson described his happiness by saying: [...] "We're going to go home and we're going to make sure we have the best engines, go through our simulation stuff, make <b>sure</b> <b>our</b> car is as fast as it can be and then race. We were in a good situation and could take the risk, take the chance. It worked out for us.|$|E

2500|$|Initially {{international}} {{opinion was}} skeptical and Suez Canal Company shares did not sell well overseas. Britain, Austria, and Russia did not buy {{a significant number}} of shares. All French shares were quickly sold in France. A contemporary British skeptic claimed [...] "One thing is <b>sure...</b> <b>our</b> local merchant community doesn't pay practical attention at all to this grand work, and it is legitimate to doubt that the canal's receipts... could ever be sufficient to recover its maintenance fee. It will never become a large ship's accessible way in any case." ...|$|E

We also have a chemist with the Drug Enforcement Administration based out of Dallas who has just been hugely helpful to us." [...] Nelson spoke of Gilligan's interest in having the science right: [...] " [...] said it made a difference to him." ...|$|E
2500|$|The league {{found that}} Payton not only {{knew about the}} scheme, but tried {{to cover it up}} during both league investigations. During the 2010 investigation, Payton told Williams and Vitt to [...] "make <b>sure</b> <b>our</b> ducks are in a row" [...] when the league interviewed them. Before the start of the 2011 season, Payton {{received}} an email from Ornstein detailing the broader lines of the scheme. In that same email, Ornstein offered $5,000 to anyone who knocked Rodgers out of the 2011 season opener. Payton initially denied knowing that this email existed, but subsequently admitted that in fact he had read it.|$|E

[...] Katina then stated, [...] "He made {{us out to}} BE lesbians when we were just singing FOR lesbians. We wanted people to understand them and not judge them. That they are as free as anyone else." [...] In one of the final episodes, Volkova mentioned returning to the United States in spring of 2004 to record with new producers. However, she became pregnant soon thereafter, and recording was delayed.|$|E
2500|$|Kossowski's first large ceramic project, a Rosary Way, {{also came}} as an Aylesford commission. When the artist {{suggested}} {{that he may not}} be [...] "the man who should do that", Fr.

[...] Kossowski later commented on this project: Looking at these Mysteries now, and remembering the agonies, the frenzies and delights of this spontaneous work, I think my inexperience and technical near-impudence contributed much to the freshness and simplicity of these works which, I hope, redeem some of the shortcomings.|$|E

After the game, Hinrich was asked about starting the game. He responded, [...] "We're playing in groups right now. I know when I get my time, I just {{try to make the}} best of it, make <b>sure</b> <b>our</b> team is successful. It's one of those deals when you play in groups in spurts like that, it's a little bit tougher.

2500|$|During {{his last}} {{years in the}} House, Hill earned a 70 percent rating from the Human Rights Campaign, a GLBT rights {{advocacy}} group. [...] Hill supported the repeal of don't ask, don't tell, voted for the Employment Non-Discrimination Act in 2010, and opposed a proposed amendment to the U.S. Constitution to ban same-sex marriage. Hill did not campaign for same-sex marriage, however, and did not cosponsor legislation brought by 121 Democrats to repeal the Defense of Marriage Act, which barred federal recognition of same-sex marriage. As public attitudes changed, Hill's position shifted, and in 2015, while running for Senate, Hill said: [...] "Marriage equality is especially close to my own heart. I’m proud of Hoosiers who are fighting to make <b>sure</b> <b>our</b> friends and neighbors are guaranteed equal rights." ...|$|E
2500|$|During {{the race}} for the seat on the SBOE, the nonprofit {{watchdog}} group Texas Freedom Network (TFN), which first brought Bruner's posts to public attention, warned that the SBOE has a history of mixing culture wars with public education and criticized many of Bruner's public statements immediately prior to her primary election. While some of Bruner's posts were later deleted, TFN and journalists of numerous Texas and national publications made screen shots of the posts and began reporting on them, questioning her fitness to hold public office. When asked about her public statements, Bruner defended them, saying [...] "I don't intend to apologize for my opinions because I still believe my statements were accurate." [...] After Bruner's defeat, TPN president Kathy Miller issued a statement saying: [...] "Texas escaped an education train wreck tonight. If Bruner had ultimately won election to the board, she would have instantly become the most embarrassingly uninformed and divisive member on a board that already too often puts politics ahead of making <b>sure</b> <b>our</b> kids get a sound education." ...|$|E
2500|$|In August 2013, the fan {{campaign}} Voices for Yes {{was launched}} {{to get the}} band into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The campaign was headed by two US political operators: John Brabender, senior media strategist for Republican Rick Santorum's 2012 US presidential campaign, and Tad Devine, who worked on Democrat John Kerry's 2004 presidential campaign and Al Gore's 2000 campaign. Also involved were former NBC president Steve Capus and former Director of the White House Office of Political Affairs Sara Taylor. On 16 October 2013, Yes failed to be inducted. In November 2013, Anderson expressed a wish to return to Yes {{in the future for}} a [...] "tour everybody dreams of", and cited Yes's nomination for inclusion into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a motive for a possible reunion. Howe, however, has stated his opinion of Anderson returning, asserting [...] "I'm not <b>sure</b> <b>our</b> mutual desire to achieve the same thing exists any more ... I think {{there has to be some}} element of moving on." ...|$|E
