40|$|Oleic acid (OA) {{injection}} {{into the}} lungs of dogs produces pulmonary edema and decreased cardiac output, {{and the result}} is combined hypoxic and <b>stagnant</b> <b>hypoxia.</b> Prostacyclin (PGI 2) has some effects that may be beneficial in the alleviation of hypoxia. We studied 18 anesthetized dogs that were divided into three groups: (1) Six dogs acted as controls and did not receive OA or PGI 2, (2) six dogs received OA but no PGI 2, and (3) six dogs were first given OA and 1 hour later an infusion of PGI 2 (100 ng/kg/min) was started and continued for 4 hours. All dogs were killed {{at the end of the}} study and their lungs were removed for weighing and preparation for microscopic examination. Compared with controls, OA caused a low cardiac output, high systemic and pulmonary vascular resistance, and increased right-to-left intrapulmonary shunt. The group that received OA and PGI 2 demonstrated a well-maintained cardiac output and a low systemic vascular resistance. Right-to-left intrapulmonary shunt, however, increased in these dogs compared with the dogs not given PGI 2. All animals given OA had similar wet/dry lung weights and histologic appearances. Our results suggest that the only beneficial effect of PGI 2 in OA-induced lung injury is to improve the <b>stagnant</b> <b>hypoxia,</b> but this is associated with an aggravation of the hypoxic hypoxia. The result of these competing effects appears to be a mild overall improvement in oxygen delivery as suggested by the slightly higher mixed venous PO 2 in the group that received PGI 2...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{deals with the}} in vitro and in vivo effects of methyl {{isocyanate}} (MIC) on rat brain mitochondrial function. Addition of MIC to tightly coupled brain mitochondria in vitro resulted in a mild stimulation of state 4 respiration, abolition of respiratory control, decrease in ADP/ 0 ratio, and inhibition of state 3 oxidation. The oxidation of NAD+-linked substrates (glutamate + malate) was more sensitive (fourfold) to the inhibitory action of MIC than succinate while cytochrome oxidase was unaffected. Administration of MIC subcutaneously at a lethal dose affected respiration only with glutamate + malate as the substrate (site I) and caused a 20 % decrease in state 3 oxidation leading to {{a significant decrease in}} respiratory control index while state 4 respiration and ADP/O ratio remained unaffected. As both the malondialdehyde and iron contents of brain mitochondria were not altered, it may be inferred that the observed in vivo inhibition of state 3 oxidation is induced by MIC through systemic <b>stagnant</b> <b>hypoxia</b> leading to ischemia of brain, which further contributes to the cerebral hypoxia...|$|E
40|$|Summary This {{study is}} {{concerned}} with the role of biogenous amines in radiation processes as active compounds released, and as protectors applied against the effects of ionizing radiation. In both instances the compound action of multiple bio-amines received special attention. Stored in granules and vesicles bio-amines are liable to simultaneous release by the random action of irradiation. A number of consequences of this liberation have been considered. In the irradiated hypophysectomized frog it may be the cause of the observed pigment expansion. This reaction has been analysed in isolated pieces of frog skin by building up a mixture of a few of adrenaline, noradrenaline, serotonin and melatonin. In the presence of the energy providing components oxygen, glucose and ATP, a comparable expan- Sion can be obtained. In the frog the X-ray induced release of serotonin has been demonstrated by the enhanced urinary excretion of this amine (chapter 4). The isolated uterus of the rat reacts to X-irradiation by augmented release of serotonin, catecholamines and histamine. Simultaneo~usly, evidence has been presented for participation of these bio-amines in spontaneous contractile activity of the suspended preparation. The mutual relations of the different amines rather than the absolute quantities may be of importante (chapter 5). The toxicity of individual biogenous amines in mice is considerably potentiated by combined injections. The most active combination is formed by 10 mg of histamine, 1 mg of serotonin and 10 pg of adrenaline. Addition of acetylcholine causes a diminution of the toxic action; in this manner a combination is obtained which has strong protective properties against a dose of 1250 r of total body X-irradiation. The toxicity of this combination is lowered again by subsequent irradiation (chapter 6). With regard to the mechanism of bio-amine protection in mice the role of hypoxia has been studied. <b>Stagnant</b> <b>hypoxia</b> of certain organs caused by bio-amine action can not be excluded. On the other hand the radioprctective effect of genera 1 hypoxia is thought to be mediated by the release of bio-amines. For, as shown, hypoxia still exerts a certain protective action if present up til 1 4 hours before exposure to irradiation. Since hypoxic conditions as wel 1 as bio-amine application after irradiation also have a favourable influence on radiative damage it appears likeley to asciibe the protective effect as being exerted on recovery processes (chapter 7). The protective properties of bio-amines, increased by combined activity, could be of significance for the natural resistance of animals. Great variations in radioresistance exist, not only between different species but even between individuals originating from a Same litter of intensively inbred animals. The presence of bio-amines might contribute to these sensitivity differences, particularly since combiiied activity of biogenous amines appears to be a natural situation, especially in reactions with defensive characters (chapter l and 4). Regarding this, in our opinion, the release of biogenous amines must not be considered as specific. It is rather a genera 1 reaction to a variety of stimulants. Possibly, it is related to the genera 1 adaptation syndrome and represents a complex of peripheral reactions whereas the adaptation syndrome is of centra 1 origin. The mechanism of bio-amine interaction, by which a combined effect is much more distinct, is obscure. In the described experiments the action of a combination of biogenous amines is quite distinct from that of the separate components. We, therefore, incline to the opinion of mutual interactions of the free bio-amines causing the organism to maintain a homeostatic state. To this balanced situation some of the amines might contribute in a positive and others, in a negative sense. Smal 1 quantitative alterations in one of the components will easily be corrected by the total system perhaps by means of minute shifts in the mutual relations. Sudden major changes in one of the participants will then bring the system out of balance and may trigger a specific reaction. Although several indications are present for such interaction mechanisms, the manner of interaction is, as mentioned, unclear. It seems not unlikely that the study of ionizing radiation, by its pronounced influence on the amounts of free biogenous amines available, can contribute to tho solution of this problem. ...|$|E
