40|$|ABSTRACT Effects of {{different}} broiler stocks, ambient temperatures (Ta), dietary energy content (AME), and dietary levels of unsaturated fat on plasma thyroid and growth hormone concentrations and energy metabolism were studied. An experiment with a 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 factorial split-plot arrangement of treatments with 96 groups of 12 male broilers each was performed. Blood samples were taken at 3, 4, and 5 wk of age. Energy metabolism parameters were determined over an entire period from 1 to 5 wk of age. Chickens from a line selected for fast growth rate and low {{feed conversion ratio}} but also more <b>sensitive</b> to <b>heart</b> failure <b>syndrome</b> (HFS) and ascites (Line SS) than commercial birds (Line BC) exhibited the greatest responses to experimental factors. Differences in levels of plasma thyroxine (T 4), triio-dothyronine (T 3), reverse triiodothyronine (rT 3), and growth hormone (GH) between stocks at different ages were highly dependent on Ta and dietary fat content. Differences in heat production per metabolic weight, percentage of retained fat energy in retained energy, and efficiency of AME intake fo...|$|R

40|$|ObjectiveThe Norwood procedure, {{the first}} {{surgical}} step of staged palliation for hypoplastic left <b>heart</b> <b>syndrome,</b> is also applied for other complex single-ventricle lesions with systemic outflow tract obstruction or aortic arch hypoplasia. We reviewed our 15 -year institutional {{experience with the}} Norwood procedure for patients with and without hypoplastic left <b>heart</b> <b>syndrome.</b> MethodsA total of 41 patients without hypoplastic left <b>heart</b> <b>syndrome</b> and 212 patients with hypoplastic left <b>heart</b> <b>syndrome</b> who underwent a Norwood procedure between January 1996 and December 2010 were enrolled. Full medical records were reviewed to assess the determinants of outcome. ResultsEarly failure (death or cardiac transplantation) was 7 % in patients without hypoplastic left <b>heart</b> <b>syndrome</b> and 13 % in patients with hypoplastic left <b>heart</b> <b>syndrome</b> (P = . 29). Frequency of postoperative complications, duration of postoperative ventilation, and length of vasoactive drug treatment were not different between groups. Transplant-free survival until the second operative step trended to be higher for patients without hypoplastic left <b>heart</b> <b>syndrome</b> (92 % vs 80 %, P = . 067). Recurrent aortic arch obstruction was more common in patients without hypoplastic left <b>heart</b> <b>syndrome</b> (15 / 39 vs 32 / 171, P = . 008), but there were 4 patients with stenosis of the proximal aortic arch. In subsequent procedures, 31 patients without hypoplastic left <b>heart</b> <b>syndrome</b> underwent superior cavopulmonary anastomosis and 5 biventricular repair. Overall transplant-free survival was not different between groups (P = . 119) but trended to be higher in patients with a systemic or substantial left ventricle remnant contributing to cardiac output (P = . 082). ConclusionsEarly and long-term survivals and postoperative complications were similar between patients with and without hypoplastic left <b>heart</b> <b>syndrome</b> undergoing a Norwood operation.

40|$|BackgroundPulmonary artery size is {{a crucial}} {{determinant}} of hemodynamic energy loss in total cavopulmonary connections. We investigated the effect of aortic arch reconstruction on left pulmonary artery size based on their anatomic proximity. MethodsThirty-two patients undergoing the Fontan operation, 16 with hypoplastic left <b>heart</b> <b>syndrome</b> and 16 with non–hypoplastic left <b>heart</b> <b>syndrome,</b> were selected from the multicenter Fontan magnetic resonance imaging database at the Georgia Institute of Technology. The 16 datasets were consecutive with full anatomic reconstructions of the total cavopulmonary connection and aortic arch with no artifacts. The size of the aorta along the transverse arch and left pulmonary artery size in the region below the aortic arch was quantified by using a previously validated skeletonization technique. ResultsThe transverse aortic and left pulmonary artery measurements (median, maximum, and minimum, respectively) for non–hypoplastic left <b>heart</b> <b>syndrome</b> were 2. 2, 3. 1, and 1. 5 cm/m and 1. 2, 1. 6, and 0. 2 cm/m, respectively, compared with 2. 5, 4. 1, and 2. 0 cm/m and 0. 9, 1. 5, and 0. 4 cm/m for patients with hypoplastic left <b>heart</b> <b>syndrome.</b> Thus the transverse aortic diameter of patients with hypoplastic left <b>heart</b> <b>syndrome</b> was, on average, 24 % greater than that for patients with non–hypoplastic left <b>heart</b> <b>syndrome</b> (P <. 05), whereas the left pulmonary artery diameter of patients with hypoplastic left <b>heart</b> <b>syndrome</b> was smaller than that of patients with non–hypoplastic left <b>heart</b> <b>syndrome</b> (P <. 05). Regression analysis showed a significant negative correlation (P <. 05) between aortic and left pulmonary artery diameters in both the hypoplastic left <b>heart</b> <b>syndrome</b> and non–hypoplastic left <b>heart</b> <b>syndrome</b> groups. However, when the study population was regrouped into reconstructed aorta and nonreconstructed aorta groups, the negative correlation was only significant for patients with reconstructed aortas, regardless of ventricular pathology (P <. 02).

40|$|The {{study was}} {{designed}} to establish the underlying pathology of aortic coarctation in hypoplastic left <b>heart</b> <b>syndrome.</b> Aortic coarctation in patients with hypoplastic left <b>heart</b> <b>syndrome</b> is a significant problem when a Norwood procedure or heart transplantation is performed. Previous reports have claimed that the obstruction was merely a branch-point phenomenon and that ductal tissue was absent. Five heart specimens with hypoplastic left <b>heart</b> <b>syndrome</b> and aortic coarctation were examined histologically. The distal segment of the aortic arch, together with the arterial duct, were dissected and processed en bloc. The blocks were sectioned parallel to the longitudinal axis of the aortic arch. In 4 hearts the coarctation was in the preductal position. Ductal tissue encircled the aortic lumen and extended into the aorta both proximally and distally from the ductal orifice. The fifth case showed medial thickening of the aortic wall in the preductal position, but without ductal tissue. The arterial duct showed histologic characteristics of persistent patency.

40|$|ObjectiveHypoplastic left <b>heart</b> <b>syndrome</b> {{is a major}} {{congenital}} heart defect and {{is associated}} with significant morbidity and mortality. Its etiology remains unknown although genetic studies imply complex inheritance. Anecdotal reports of cluster presentations suggest the possible involvement of an environmental component, although previous epidemiologic studies have been of limited scope. The objective {{of this study was}} to examine seasonal and temporal patterns of hypoplastic left <b>heart</b> <b>syndrome</b> births compared with other left-sided heart defects in the United States. MethodsWe conducted a retrospective analysis of the Pediatric Health Information System inpatient database from pediatric hospitals across the country from 1996 to 2006. Population and index case patterns were analyzed for each diagnostic category. An epidemiologic survey was performed through time–series analyses using Fisher's Kappa test and the Bartlett Kolmogorov–Smirnov test. The existence and strength of seasonality for the left-sided heart defects was quantified by the autoregression R 2. ResultsA seasonal occurrence was found in hypoplastic left <b>heart</b> <b>syndrome</b> but not other left-sided heart diseases. Significant seasonal differences occurred each year, with peaks in summer months and troughs in winter months. The seasonality inversely correlated with the incidence of chromosomal and extracardiac anomalies; such anomalies were highest in interrupted aortic arch, which had a random pattern of presentation. ConclusionsThere is a significant seasonal pattern in the presentation of hypoplastic left <b>heart</b> <b>syndrome,</b> with preponderance in summer months, in contrast to the random pattern in other left-sided heart diseases.

MethodsThis prospective follow-up study evaluated the neurodevelopmental outcome of 23 patients with hypoplastic left <b>heart</b> <b>syndrome,</b> 14 with other forms of univentricular heart, and 46 healthy control subjects at a median age of 12. 2 months. The Griffiths Developmental Scale and Alberta Infant Motor Scale served for developmental evaluation. ResultsThe mean Griffiths developmental quotient of children with hypoplastic left <b>heart</b> <b>syndrome</b> was significantly less (91. 6) than that of control children (106. 8, P <. 001). Patients with univentricular heart scored significantly lower than control subjects only in the gross motor domain (P =. 001) but not in overall development (100. 6). Alberta Infant Motor Scale scores were significantly lower in children with hypoplastic left <b>heart</b> <b>syndrome</b> (37. 5, P <. 001) and univentricular heart (43. 5, P =. 011) than in control subjects (53. 3). In linear regression a diagnosis of hypoplastic left <b>heart</b> <b>syndrome</b> (P =. 016), a clinical history of seizure (P =. 002), and the highest plasma lactate level after the bidirectional Glenn operation (P =. 045) were significantly associated with the developmental quotient.

40|$|ObjectiveWith {{improving}} operative mortality for staged palliation of hypoplastic left <b>heart</b> <b>syndrome,</b> interstage death {{accounts for}} an increasing proportion of hypoplastic left <b>heart</b> <b>syndrome</b> mortality. We investigated {{risk factors for}} death or cardiac transplantation during the interstage period between bidirectional Glenn and Fontan procedures in children with hypoplastic left <b>heart</b> <b>syndrome.</b> MethodsPatients with hypoplastic left <b>heart</b> <b>syndrome</b> who underwent bidirectional Glenn between August 1995 and June 2007 were screened. Standard risk patients, defined by having been discharged after both Norwood and bidirectional Glenn, were included for analysis. Patient demographic, echocardiographic, cardiac catheterization, and operative data were reviewed. Interstage attrition was defined as death or cardiac transplantation more than 30 days after bidirectional Glenn and before the Fontan procedure. Statistical analysis was carried out using the Student t test, Pearson chi-square correlation, and Cox proportional hazard modeling for multivariable analysis. ResultsNinety-two patients with hypoplastic left <b>heart</b> <b>syndrome</b> were alive at 30 days after bidirectional Glenn. Of these patients, 8 died and 3 underwent cardiac transplantation at a median of 391 days (range, 59 – 1175 days) after bidirectional Glenn, yielding an interstage attrition rate of 12 %. Removing the 7 patients who are still awaiting Fontan (but {{all of whom are}} at least 3. 5 years after bidirectional Glenn) adjusts the attrition rate to 13 %. Interstage attrition did not correlate with hemodynamic data obtained at cardiac catheterization, aortic arch obstruction, or right ventricular dysfunction. Multivariable analysis demonstrated that the presence of moderate or severe tricuspid valve regurgitation (hazard ratio, 6. 02; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 56 – 23. 24; P < . 01) and weight z score (hazard ratio, 0. 38; 95 % confidence interval, 0. 16 – 0. 88; P = . 02) were independent preoperative risk factors for interstage attrition. ConclusionsInterstage attrition between bidirectional Glenn and Fontan procedures occurred in 12 % of our study population. Moderate or greater tricuspid valve regurgitation and low weight z score at the time of bidirectional Glenn are important risk factors for interstage attrition between the bidirectional Glenn and Fontan procedures in children with hypoplastic left <b>heart</b> <b>syndrome...</b>|$|R

MethodsThis is a retrospective review of infants having surgical palliation of hypoplastic left <b>heart</b> <b>syndrome</b> from April 2003 to March 2010 at a single institution. ResultsSeventy-five infants had a modified Norwood procedure, 65 with a right ventricle–pulmonary artery conduit, 10 with an aortopulmonary shunt, 2 with atrioventricular valve repair, and 3 with extracorporeal life support. Sixty-eight patients had hypoplastic left <b>heart</b> <b>syndrome</b> or one of its variants, and 7 had other single-ventricle lesions. There were 2 stage I deaths. Stage I survival was 97 % (95 % confidence interval, 88 %– 99 %). Another 5 infants succumbed in the interstage period. Of the 68 stage I and interstage survivors, 61 had bidirectional cavopulmonary anastomoses, 20 without cardiopulmonary bypass. Median age was 6 months (range, 4 – 13 months), and median weight was 6. 1 kg (range, 5. 2 – 9. 0 kg). There were no conversions to cardiopulmonary bypass when off-pump bidirectional cavopulmonary anastomosis was attempted. There were no hospital deaths.
