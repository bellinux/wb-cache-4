40|$|The {{physics of}} {{electron}} heating and current drive with the fast magnetosonic wave {{has been demonstrated}} on DIII-D, in reasonable agreement with theoretical modeling. A recently completed upgrade to the fast wave capability should allow full noninductive current drive in <b>steady</b> <b>state</b> advanced <b>confinement</b> discharges and provide some current density profile control for the Advanced Tokamak Program. DIII-D now has three four-strap fast wave antennas and three transmitters, each with nominally 2 MW of generator power. Extensive experiments have been conducted with the first system, at 60 MHz, while the two newer systems have come into operation within the past year. The newer systems are configured for 60 to 120 MHz. The measured FWCD efficiency is found to increase linearly with electron temperature as {gamma} = 0. 4 {times} 10 {sup 18 } T{sub eo} (keV) [A/m{sup 2 }W], measured up to central electron temperature over 5 keV. A newly developed technique for determining the internal noninductive current density profile gives efficiencies in agreement with this scaling and profiles consistent with theoretical predictions. Full noninductive current drive at 170 kA was achieved in a discharge prepared by rampdown of the Ohmic current. Modulation of microwave reflectometry signals at the fast wave frequency {{is being used to}} investigate fast wave propagation and damping. Additionally, rf pick-up probes on the internal boundary of the vessel provide a comparison with ray tracing codes, with dear evidence for a toroidally directed wave with antenna phasing set for current drive.

40|$|Two high {{resolution}} edge x-ray imaging diagnostics have been {{installed in the}} Alcator C-Mod tokamak. One array measures the radial soft x-ray emissivity profiles {{at the top of}} the plasma with 1. 2 mm radial resolution, mapped along flux surfaces to the midplane, whereas the other measures the radial soft x-ray emissivity profiles at the outboard edge with 1. 5 mm radial resolution mapped to the midplane. The two diagnostics measure the chord brightness profiles, which are then inverted to get soft x-ray emissivity simultaneously with a 12 µs sampling time. This allows us to determine if the soft x-ray emissivity, and therefore the fluorine density, is constant on a flux surface during <b>steady</b> <b>state</b> high <b>confinement</b> mode conditions, as well as during fast transient edge events, such as Edge Localized Modes or transitions from the high confinement mode to the low confinement mode. Measurements are presented showing that the soft x-ray emissivity is not constant on a flux surface, but instead 1 shows a large poloidal variation, contrary to what is assumed in the inversion routine. The effects of the poloidal variation on the inversion accuracy are estimated numerically. It is found that the emissivity is systematically overestimated at the top, and underestimated at the outboard edge, by less than 15 %. The width of the x-ray emissivity pedestal is accurate to within 15 %, and the location of the pedestal is accurate to within 1 mm. Measurements showing a poloidal propagation delay for the onset of the transition from high confinement mode (H-mode) to low confinement mode (L-mode) are also presented. 2 I...|$|R

40|$|In this study, we {{investigated}} the multiple <b>steady</b> <b>state</b> behavior, an important observation in numerical and experimental studies in natural ventilation systems. The-oretical models are developed and their applications in numerical simulations and ventilation controls are presented. In {{a system with}} multiple <b>steady</b> <b>states,</b> how the system reaches different <b>steady</b> <b>states</b> {{is determined by the}} initial values of the systems and the dynamical system characteristics of the system. Mathematical models are developed to model the dynamical system behavior of a series of ventilation systems, ranging from simple single-zone systems to complex systems with thermal mass. More importantly, we found that the system can transform from one <b>steady</b> <b>state</b> to another under sufficient perturbations (disturbances) when multiple <b>steady</b> <b>states</b> exist. A successful transition is determined by both the magnitudes and durations of the perturbations. The transition dynamics are found to be important in theoretical, computational, and control applications. For example, the actual stability of a mathematically (or locally) stable <b>steady</b> <b>state</b> is highly correlated to the minimum perturbation requirements for a state transition. If two indicative parameters-the minimum perturbation time and the minimum perturbation magnitude-are small for the system to transit from one <b>steady</b> <b>state</b> to another, a mathematically stable <b>steady</b> <b>state</b> can be unstable in actual conditions, where stochastic disturbances exist as "strong perturbations". Further, building thermal mass is also found to have significant impacts on the state transitions between the multiple <b>steady</b> <b>states.</b> With thermal mass, the state transition becomes more difficult to occur. The state transition dynamics can also be applied to numerical simulations. (cont.) We have developed a convenient dynamical simulation method to identify the possible <b>steady</b> <b>states</b> in buildings with complex geometries and test the stabilities of the obtained <b>steady</b> <b>states.</b> The method can determine nearly all the possible <b>steady</b> <b>state</b> the system may reach in a feasible range using different search methods; whether the <b>steady</b> <b>states</b> obtained are stable in an actual environment can also be determined by a disturbance test based on the transition dynamics between the multiple <b>steady</b> <b>states.</b> Further, the state transition dynamics can be strategically applied in hybrid ventilation controls. In the past, designers and engineers have viewed the multiple <b>steady</b> <b>states</b> as negative aspect of ventilation design and have been trying to avoid the multiple <b>steady</b> <b>states</b> as much as possible. In this study, we have developed positive applications of multiple <b>steady</b> <b>states</b> based on a dynamic state transition in real-time to enhance the ventilation efficiency of a hybrid ventilation system and to reduce the energy usage in buildings. A coupled multi-zone airflow and thermal program for transient entire building simulations is also developed in parallel with the study. With the understanding on the multiple <b>steady</b> <b>state</b> issues, the developed program has overcome a few non-trivial numerical problems reported in other similar simulation programs and has shown good numerical performance in coupled airflow and thermal analysis. The program is also used as a tool for identifying the multiple <b>steady</b> <b>states</b> in buildings with complex geometries and for testing the actual stabilities of the obtained <b>steady</b> <b>states</b> in real conditions. by Jinchao Yuan.
