5|$|Stace {{was praised}} for his clarity and ambitious aims in Time and Eternity by Abraham Kaplan who {{believed}} {{the book was}} one of the best on the subject for many many years. He pointed out that the book’s distinction between the orders of time and eternity owed much to Kant (which Stace himself acknowledged). Kaplan reflected that it was the book’s emphasis placed on mysticism and a universal religious intuition that would be of particular interest to students of “Oriental and comparative philosophy”. The central idea upon which Stace’s thought stands or falls, for Kaplan, is that religious language is evocative rather than descriptive. In this both religionists and naturalists will find problems. For the former, Stace can only account for the appropriateness of religious language by relying on ‘nearness’ to the divine rather than on resemblance, and this relies on ‘a vague panpsychism’ and levels of being in the manner of Samuel Alexander. While for the naturalist, Stace’s system of religious symbolism is doomed to remain mysterious, because it does not allow religious metaphors to be translated literally and neither can it be <b>said</b> <b>how</b> they evoke the experience to which they refer.|$|E

25|$|During the suspension, Ajax were {{in contact}} with other European clubs {{interested}} in Suárez. On 28 January 2011, they accepted a €26.5million (£22.8million) offer for Suárez from Premier League club Liverpool.

25|$|In November 2014 U.S. President Obama {{expanded}} the original role of U.S. Armed Forces in Afghanistan for 2015. Originally {{they were supposed}} to advise, train and assist the Afghan Forces and to hunt the remnants of Al Qaeda. Under the president’s order U.S. forces can carry out missions against the Taliban and other militant groups threatening American troops or the Afghan government while American jets, bombers and drones can support Afghan troops on combat missions. By the end of 2015, half of the 9,800 American troops would leave Afghanistan. The rest would be consolidated in Kabul and Bagram, and then leave by the end of 2016, allowing Obama to say he ended the Afghan war before leaving office. The United States could still have military advisers in Kabul after 2016 who would work out of an office of security cooperation at the United States Embassy.

500|$|The lack of graphics, poor {{interface}} {{and controls}} {{were seen as}} {{the reasons for the}} game's difficulty. However, the reviewers also noted most of it having a role in gameplay and the argument that the text-based graphics forces players to use their own imagination, making it more engaging. Weiner wrote, [...] " [...] may not look real, but once you're hooked, it feels vast, enveloping, alive. A micro-manager's dream, the game gleefully blurs the distinction between painstaking labor and creative thrill." [...] Quintin Smith from Rock, Paper, Shotgun said, [...] "The interface has a tough job to do, bless it, but getting it {{to do what you want}} is like teaching a beetle to cook." [...] Ars Technica's Casey Johnston highlighted the difficulty in performing basic actions and felt that tinkering or experimenting ended up being unproductive; she compared it to [...] "trying to build a skyscraper by banging two rocks together".

500|$|The EP {{has been}} seen by critics simply as [...] "unapologetic {{hardcore}} punk" [...] and being the most aggressive work Gallows had done so far. A more Americanised influence can be heard throughout the EP as it's been likened to bands like Cancer Bats and Every Time I Die. MacNeil had always stated the EP helped build on what he has always liked about Gallows; he considers it being [...] "Four songs like {{a kick in the}} teeth". In the writing of the new extended play the band focused on less typical song structures and focused on the chaotic sound from live shows. MacNeil believed that [...] "sometimes you don’t need to overcomplicate things. Obviously, we're trying to write music that’s chaotic and is going to be something that comes across vicious-sounding live... you don’t repeat it four times, you do it once, and you don’t have a bridge." [...] Gallows guitarist Laurent Barnard <b>said</b> <b>how</b> the EP would not sound similar to the band's third studio album by saying [...] "If you're going to make a punk rock EP, you might as well make it the most punk rock thing you can really." ...|$|E

500|$|Coppola {{comes from}} a family of film-makers and actors, and she has <b>said</b> <b>how</b> {{childhood}} memories of living in hotels partially inspired her choice of setting. Somewhere presents a detailed portrait of life in that industry and charts its existential and emotional boundaries. While celebrity gossip websites inform us of the shallowness of much of [...] "star life", Coppola's feature differs in its emotional depth. She wanted to depict Marco working, but not on a film set. Instead he is shown giving interviews, being photographed, attending an awards ceremony in Italy, and having special effects make-up applied. When Marco attends the special-effects department his face is covered in latex, the camera then very slowly, hypnotically zooms in. Marco is obliged to use his [...] "star" [...] recognition to help promote his new film, when his publicist calls he becomes passive and mechanically takes the arranged chauffeured car and speaks to the press. In part, the humor derives from Marco's subdued response to these attentions, and Coppola's off-beat observation of people around him. At the Venice film festival, critics highlighted the repetition of characters in a cloistered existence in Coppola's films, to which she responded [...] "I feel like everyone should tell what they know in the world that they know".|$|E
500|$|Bill Janovitz of Allmusic {{describes}} the music as beautiful, with folk guitar chord changes and a somber melody, while the chorus, with its line [...] "and it's all over now, Baby Blue" [...] has a heartbreaking quality to it. Like other Dylan {{songs of the}} period, such as [...] "Chimes of Freedom" [...] and [...] "Mr. Tambourine Man", the lyrics of [...] "It's All Over Now, Baby Blue" [...] bear the strong influence of Symbolist poets such as Arthur Rimbaud. Lines such as [...] "take what you have gathered from coincidence" [...] reflect the I Ching philosophy that coincidence represents more than mere chance. The song was described by Q magazine as, [...] "The most toxic of strummed kiss-offs, with not a snowball's chance in hell of reconciliation." [...] Dylan, later describing the song, said that [...] "I had carried that song around in my head {{for a long time}} and I remember that when I was writing it, I'd remembered a Gene Vincent song. It had always been one of my favorites, Baby Blue... 'When first I met my baby/she <b>said</b> <b>how</b> do you do/she looked into my eyes and said/my name is Baby Blue.' [...] It was one of the songs I used to sing back in high school. Of course, I was singing about a different Baby Blue." ...|$|E
500|$|There {{was also}} {{considerable}} {{mention of the}} evolution of Underwood's relationship with Claire. [...] "heir partnership has morphed into an entirely professional exercise, with a shared lust for power having supplanted more conventional matrimonial bonds," [...] wrote Brian Lowry of Variety. The Atlantics Spencer Kornhaber remarked, however, that the utter ruthlessness displayed by Underwoods in the season finale may have represented a [...] "jump the shark" [...] moment for the series: The Underwoods have murdered a politician and a journalist, and some innocents have also been collateral damage to their activities. Now, though, they've set out to maintain their power at the cost of mass casualties. Netflix hasn't <b>said</b> <b>how</b> many seasons are to come, but it's hard to imagine the show being watchable for all that much longer now that this rubicon of despicability has been crossed.Some compared Underwood's story line in season 4 to the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Brian Moyland of The Guardian wrote: House of Cards has never felt like the real presidency: Frank Underwood is evil incarnate, bumping off junior Congressmen and pushing journalists in front of trains. But now that, in real life, we're in the throes of such a bizarre presidential race, his machinations are starting to look almost viable. There are several parallels between Underwood's re-election campaign and the 2016 campaigns of Donald Trump, Ted Cruz, Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders.|$|E

500|$|Smith never <b>said</b> <b>how</b> he {{produced}} the Book of Mormon, saying {{only that he}} translated {{by the power of}} God and implying that he had transcribed the words. The Book of Mormon itself states only that its text will [...] "come forth by the gift and power of God unto the interpretation thereof". As such, considerable disagreement about the actual method used exists. For {{at least some of the}} earliest dictation, Smith is said to have used the [...] "Urim and Thummim", a pair of seer stones he said were buried with the plates. Later, however, he is said to have used a chocolate-colored stone he had found in 1822 that he had used previously for treasure hunting. Joseph Knight said that Smith saw the words of the translation while he gazed at the stone or stones in the bottom of his hat, excluding all light, a process similar to divining the location of treasure. Sometimes, Smith concealed the process by raising a curtain or dictating from another room, while at other times he dictated in full view of witnesses while the plates lay covered on the table. [...] After completing the translation, Smith gave the brown stone to Cowdery, but continued to receive revelations using another stone until about 1833 when he said he no longer needed it.|$|E
500|$|Wallace {{had once}} briefly met Darwin, {{and was one}} of the correspondents whose {{observations}} Darwin used to support his own theories. Although Wallace's first letter to Darwin has been lost, Wallace carefully kept the letters he received. In the first letter, dated 1 May 1857, Darwin commented that Wallace's letter of 10 October which he had recently received, as well as Wallace's paper [...] "On the Law which has regulated the Introduction of New Species" [...] of 1855, showed that they were both thinking alike and to some extent reaching similar conclusions, and said that he was preparing his own work for publication in about two years time. The second letter, dated 22 December 1857, <b>said</b> <b>how</b> glad he was that Wallace was theorising about distribution, adding that [...] "without speculation there is no good and original observation" [...] while commenting that [...] "I believe I go much further than you". Wallace trusted Darwin's opinion on the matter and sent him his February 1858 essay, [...] "On the Tendency of Varieties to Depart Indefinitely From the Original Type", with the request that Darwin would review it and pass it on to Charles Lyell if he thought it worthwhile. Although Wallace had sent several articles for journal publication during his travels through the Malay archipelago, the Ternate essay was in a private letter. On 18 June 1858, Darwin received the essay from Wallace. While Wallace's essay obviously did not employ Darwin's term [...] "natural selection", it did outline the mechanics of an evolutionary divergence of species from similar ones due to environmental pressures. In this sense, it was very similar to the theory that Darwin had worked on for twenty years, but had yet to publish. Darwin sent the manuscript to Charles Lyell with a letter saying [...] "he could not have made a better short abstract! Even his terms now stand as heads of my chapters... he does not say he wishes me to publish, but I shall, of course, at once write and offer to send to any journal."Darwin, Francis, 1887, The life and letters of Charles Darwin [...] Distraught about the illness of his baby son, Darwin put the problem to Charles Lyell and Joseph Hooker, who decided to publish the essay in a joint presentation together with unpublished writings which highlighted Darwin's priority. Wallace's essay was presented to the Linnean Society of London on 1 July 1858, along with excerpts from an essay which Darwin had disclosed privately to Hooker in 1847 and a letter Darwin had written to Asa Gray in 1857.|$|E
2500|$|Nava {{pointed out}} how he wanted the {{performance}} scenes in the film to be [...] "integrated into the drama and to reflect what the characters were going through emotionally and what Selena was going through emotionally at that particular time." [...] He further explained how he wanted the Astrodome scene to be {{the opening of the}} film to show viewers at her height of her career and then backtrail to show how she got there. The scene was shot at the San Antonio Alamodome on September 15, 1996 and was advertised in newspapers which garnered the attention of 35,000 people. Lopez <b>said</b> <b>how</b> she was nervous for the scene since {{it would be the first}} time she would perform in front of an audience of that size. She further expressed how uneven she was due to the criticism she received and was unsure how fans would receive her. Jackie Guerra voiced on how during the scene she saw Selena's parents sobbing, the cast later <b>said</b> <b>how</b> after the scene was completed they were overwhelmed with emotions. Later that night, fans approached Lopez sobbing that she looked identical to Selena and public perception on Lopez changed after her performance. The death scene was shot once, the cast explained how once they were emotional they continued after the director announced the take. Guerra <b>said</b> <b>how</b> she was physically and emotionally drained after the death scene was shot. She explained how she [...] "could not imagine what's it like to be [...] " [...] and further <b>said</b> <b>how</b> she had to live with the pain for four months but found it unimaginable to the pain the family goes through since the death of Selena.
