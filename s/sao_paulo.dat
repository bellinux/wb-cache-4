5|$|In July 1922, Minas Geraes joined <b>São</b> <b>Paulo</b> {{in helping}} to quash {{the first of the}} Revolução Tenentista (English: Tenente revolts), in which the {{garrison}} of Rio de Janeiro's Fort Copacabana rebelled and began bombarding the city. <b>São</b> <b>Paulo</b> shelled the fort, and the rebels surrendered shortly thereafter; Minas Geraes did not fire its guns.|$|E
5|$|<b>São</b> <b>Paulo</b> {{made two}} trips to Europe in 1920. The first {{conveyed}} King Albert I and Queen Elisabeth of Belgium to Brazil for the centennial celebrations. After <b>São</b> <b>Paulo</b> brought them home, the ship traveled to Portugal {{to take the}} bodies of the formerly-exiled Emperor Pedro II and his wife, Teresa Cristina, back to Brazil. In July 1922, both battleships helped to quash the first of the Tenente revolts (Revolução Tenentista), in which the garrison of Rio de Janeiro's Fort Copacabana rebelled and began bombarding the city. <b>São</b> <b>Paulo</b> shelled the fort, and the rebels surrendered shortly thereafter; Minas Geraes did not fire its guns. In 1924, three lieutenants, including Hercolino Cascardo, took over <b>São</b> <b>Paulo</b> with other crewmen. They were unsuccessful in swaying any other ships to their cause, except for an old torpedo boat, and soon sailed out of the harbor after firing a six-pounder gun at Minas Geraes. Short of food and with condensers in poor condition, the rebels sailed to Montevideo, where they received asylum. Minas Geraes followed <b>São</b> <b>Paulo,</b> arriving on 11 November and taking back possession of the ship.|$|E
40|$|This article aims to {{investigate}} <b>Sao</b> <b>Paulo's</b> post 1985 locational patterns, with {{special attention to}} the development of a wider economic territory, named <b>Sao</b> <b>Paulo's</b> Macrometropolis - constituted by <b>Sao</b> <b>Paulo's</b> Metropolitan Region (SPMR) and its adjoining regions. Its main characteristic is the existence of linkages amongst manufacture and productivity services, in such a pattern that the first tends to become intensive outside SPMR and the second, inside it. A further issue must be noted, however. The manufacture remains highly concentrated in SPMR. In other words, at least in the case of SPMR, the development of productivity services should not be understood as a substitute for manufacture. <b>São</b> <b>Paulo’s</b> Metropolitan Region (SPMR), <b>São</b> <b>Paulo’s</b> Macrometropolis, location, space, productive services...|$|R

5|$|When Brazil {{entered the}} First World War in 1917, Britain's Royal Navy {{declined}} Brazil's offer of Minas Geraes for duty with the Grand Fleet because {{the ship was}} outdated; {{it had not been}} refitted since entering service, so range-finders and a fire-control system had not been added. <b>São</b> <b>Paulo</b> underwent modernization in the United States in 1920; in 1921, Minas Geraes received the same treatment. A year later, Minas Geraes sailed to counter the first of the Tenente revolts. <b>São</b> <b>Paulo</b> shelled the rebels' fort, and they surrendered shortly thereafter; Minas Geraes did not fire its guns. In 1924, mutineers seized <b>São</b> <b>Paulo</b> and attempted to persuade the crews of Minas Geraes and several other ships to join them, but were unsuccessful.|$|E
