6000|$|From the {{foregoing}} facts, namely, {{the presence of}} temperate forms on the highlands across the whole of equatorial Africa, and along the Peninsula of India, to Ceylon and the Malay Archipelago, and in a less well-marked manner across the wide expanse of tropical South America, it appears almost certain that at some former period, no doubt during the most severe part of a Glacial period, the lowlands of these great continents were everywhere tenanted under the equator by {{a considerable number of}} temperate forms. At this period the equatorial climate {{at the level of the}} sea was probably about the same with that now experienced at the height of from five to <b>six</b> thousand <b>feet</b> <b>under</b> the same latitude, or perhaps even rather cooler. During this, the coldest period, the lowlands under the equator must have been clothed with a mingled tropical and temperate vegetation, like that described by Hooker as growing luxuriantly at the height of from four to five thousand feet on the lower slopes of the Himalaya, but with perhaps a still greater preponderance of temperate forms. So again in the mountainous island of Fernando Po, in the Gulf of Guinea, Mr. Mann found temperate European forms beginning to appear at the height of about five thousand feet. On the mountains of Panama, at the height of only two thousand feet, Dr. Seemann found the vegetation like that of Mexico, [...] "with forms of the torrid zone harmoniously blended with those of the temperate." ...|$|R

5000|$|The message [...] "John is <b>six</b> <b>feet</b> tall" [...] is an {{assertion}} involving truth that commits the speaker to its factuality, whereas the reified statement [...] "Mary reports that John is <b>six</b> <b>feet</b> tall" [...] defers such commitment to Mary. In this way, the statements can be incompatible without creating contradictions in reasoning. For example, the statements [...] "John is <b>six</b> <b>feet</b> tall" [...] and [...] "John is five feet tall" [...] are mutually exclusive (and thus incompatible), but the statements [...] "Mary reports that John is <b>six</b> <b>feet</b> tall" [...] and [...] "Paul reports that John is five feet tall" [...] are not incompatible, {{as they are}} both governed by a conclusive rationale that either Mary or Paul is (or both are), in fact, incorrect.|$|R
