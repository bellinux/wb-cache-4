We conducted soil compactions with five pressure loads (35, 98, 118, 196 and 345 kg), and measured soil moistures at different depths and under different compaction times, as well as compared those before the loads was applied. The results indicate that soil moisture was generally lost after compaction by agricultural machinery and its loss was related to pressure load, <b>soil</b> <b>depth</b> and <b>compaction</b> times. Generally, moisture loss increased with the increase of pressure load and mostly occurred at the soil surface (0 to 5 cm) for light loads ( 110 kg). Moreover, the moisture loss decreased gradually with the increases in <b>soil</b> <b>depth</b> for light loads (37 and 98 kg), although it was first increased and then quickly decreased for heavy loads (>= 118 kg).

40|$|Soil {{compaction}} is {{a potential}} problem in many agricultural soils due to the increasing mass of agricultural vehicles and equipment and tendency of farmers to work fields when soil is wet. A review of literature showed that some control measures can be taken such as controlling traffic to reduce compaction or use of tillage to remove the effects of compaction. Many implements have been used to loosen compacted soil, but in their design <b>compaction</b> <b>depth</b> was not considered and also these implements are designed for full width tillage as opposed to tillage only in the zone that has been compacted by traffic.

Laboratory and field experiments were conducted to verify this relationship. In the laboratory experiment soil at varying water contents was compacted with a metal plate made to simulate the tractor tire. Different stresses were used to create different sinkage depths.

Bulk density of the control soil was subtracted from bulk density of the compacted soil and the difference was used to determine the depth at which the stress applied increased bulk density by 0. 05 Mg/m[superscript] 3. In the field experiment, a tractor with different tire inflation pressures and with different axle loads was used to traffic plots to create different sinkage depths.

40|$|The {{factors related}} to shallow slope {{failures}} include <b>soil</b> <b>depth,</b> vertical <b>soil</b> structure, and bedrock topography. In this study, we surveyed spatial variations of <b>soil</b> <b>depth</b> and vertical <b>soil</b> structure by conducting simplified penetration tests, and then estimated bedrock topography in a newly-planted hillslope. We analyze the ability of these three factors to detect potential slope failure locations (PSFL) {{on the basis of}} information from a shallow slope failure which occurred at the study site during the survey period. The results show that <b>soil</b> <b>depth</b> varies spatially on the hillslope. However, there are no obvious correlations between <b>soil</b> <b>depth</b> and any topographic factor. This finding differs from the results suggesting an inverse correlation between <b>soil</b> <b>depth</b> and slope in some previous studies. Comparing the three factors, the area of PSFL determined by <b>soil</b> <b>depth</b> is the smallest. This implies that <b>soil</b> <b>depth</b> {{plays an important role in}} predicting the potential of a shallow slope failure. According to information about vertical soil structure, we presume that vertical rainwater infiltration is impeded by local hard soil layers, rocks, and the soil-bedrock interface, and following increase of pore water pressure might trigger shallow slope failure. This indicates that vertical soil structure has implications for vertical soil water movement and PSFL. Consequently, we suggest that the spatial variations of <b>soil</b> <b>depth</b> and vertical <b>soil</b> structure should be carefully considered when assessing potential locations for shallow slope failures in Taiwan. 判斷淺層崩塌潛勢的因子中，地表下不可視的土壤厚度、土壤垂直結構和基岩面地形等因子各別有不同的促崩機制和影響力。本研究利用簡易貫入試驗調查坡地的土壤垂直結構、土壤厚度及推估基岩面地形，瞭解這些因子的空間變異，並以樣區中發生的小崩塌為基礎探討各個因子對淺層崩塌潛勢區位的判釋能力。結果顯示土壤厚度具有空間變異，說明土壤厚度調查的重要性。在崩塌單一因子的分析中，以土壤厚度評估高崩塌潛勢區域 (PSFL) 所得的分布面積最小，且皆分布於崩塌位置附近，說明土壤厚度在崩塌潛勢的預測中佔有相當重要的角色。由崩塌地的貫入試驗和崩塌剖面觀察所得土壤垂直結構資訊，推測水分垂直移動受硬度較高的土壤層、塊石、基岩面阻擋，使得局部孔隙水壓上升進而引發淺層崩塌。這顯示土壤結構的影響力，也說明了相同的崩塌機制亦可能發生在具有同類土壤垂直結構的區域。根據本研究結果，建議就評估臺灣坡地水文過程及坡地穩定而言，應重視土壤厚度及土壤結構異質性在評估淺層崩塌潛勢區位的影響力...|$|R

The results showed that the highest and lowest values of R 2 of linear relations between meteorological parameters (relative humidity and sunshine hours) and soil temperature were observed in 10 cm <b>soil</b> <b>depth</b> (at 3 AM) and in 100 cm <b>soil</b> <b>depth,</b> respectively. Correlations of soil temperature with air temperature were greater than those with the other two parameters. Moreover, R 2 values of non- linear relation were higher than linear relation...|$|R
40|$|The {{variability}} of <b>soil</b> <b>depth</b> at the catchment scale {{is an essential}} input for environmental modeling. If the model requires high resolution inputs, the inherent {{variability of}} <b>soil</b> <b>depth</b> in granitic and forested regions poses a challenge to capture representative values. To help to address this problem, I propose that, in soil studies, qualitative and quantitative geomorphological information at the catchment scale should be used as inputs of soil-landscape models. Qualitative information {{is presented as a}} geomorphological map, and quantitative data are generated by algorithms applied to the high resolution digital elevation model. In this dissertation, the term <b>soil</b> <b>depth</b> is used to mean the weathered subsurface layers composed of mobile regolith and saprolite. Measurements of <b>soil</b> <b>depths</b> obtained from 204 hand drillings until refusal, and 6, 645 estimations of depths collected using ground penetration radar (GPR) were compared, Alone, the hand drilling data showed lack of autocorrelation, however, a significant correlation was found between GPR and auguring measurements (r= 0. 9, p< 0. 001), validating this method to capture the spatial variability in a continuum. Therefore, GPR resulted to be a valid, inexpensive and quick tool to survey <b>soil</b> <b>depth</b> in this complex environment. Contrasting several geomorphological variables and measurements of <b>soil</b> <b>depths,</b> significant correlation with lineaments, slope and wetness index suggest that geomorphology is a significant factor in the distribution of <b>soil</b> <b>depths</b> at the catchment scale in this environment. This relationship was then assumed for modeling the <b>soil</b> <b>depth</b> in a catchment scale. Because the linear regression model and geostatistical methods are not valid approaches for the available sampling design, the use of a simple soil-landscape model, based in the work of Dahlke et al. (2009), is proposed to map the measurements of <b>soil</b> <b>depths</b> to a catchment scale. Indeed, the main strength of this model lies in its independence of sampling design. The resultant prediction maps at different resolutions showed the importance of selecting an appropriate scale of work and adjust the density of GPR survey in the performance of predictions...|$|R
40|$|<b>Soil</b> <b>depth</b> {{is a major}} soil characteristic, {{which is}} {{commonly}} used in distributed hydrological modelling in order to present watershed subsurface attributes. This study aims at developing a statistical model for predicting the spatial pattern of <b>soil</b> <b>depth</b> over the mountainous watershed from environmental variables derived from a digital elevation model (DEM) and remote sensing data. Among the explanatory variables used in the models, seven are derived from a 10 m resolution DEM, namely specific catchment area, wetness index, aspect, slope, plan curvature, elevation and sediment transport index. Three variables landuse, NDVI and pca 1 are derived from Landsat 8 imagery, and are used for predicting <b>soil</b> <b>depth</b> by the models. Soil attributes, soil moisture, topographic curvature, training samples for each landuse and major vegetation types are considered at 429 profiles within four subwatersheds. Random forests (RF), s upport vector machine (SVM) and artificial neural network (ANN) are used to predict <b>soil</b> <b>depth</b> using the explanatory variables. The models are run using 336 data points in the calibration dataset with all 31 explanatory variables, and <b>soil</b> <b>depth</b> as {{the response of the}} models. Mean decrease permutation accuracy is performed on Variable selection. Testing dataset is done with the model <b>soil</b> <b>depth</b> values at testing locations (93 points) using different efficiency criteria. Prediction error is computed for both the calibration and testing datasets. Results show that the variables landuse, specific surface area, slope, pca 1, NDVI and aspect are the most important explanatory variables in predicting <b>soil</b> <b>depth.</b> RF and SVM models are appropriate for the mountainous watershed areas that have been limited in the <b>depth</b> of the <b>soil</b> and ANN model is more suitable for watershed with the fields of agricultural and deep <b>soil</b> <b>depth...</b>|$|R
40|$|Soil {{thickness}} is {{a fundamental}} variable in many earth science disciplines but difficult to predict. We find a strong inverse linear relationship between <b>soil</b> <b>depth</b> and hillslope curvature (r 2 = 0. 89, RMSE= 0. 17 m) at a field site in Idaho. Similar relationships are present across a diverse data set, although the slopes and y-intercepts vary widely. We show that the slopes of these functions vary with the standard deviations (SD) in catchment curvatures and that the catchment curvature distributions are centered on zero. Our simple empirical model predicts the spatial distribution of <b>soil</b> <b>depth</b> {{in a variety of}} catchments based only on high-resolution elevation data and a few <b>soil</b> <b>depths.</b> Spatially continuous <b>soil</b> <b>depth</b> datasets enable improved models for soil carbon, hydrology, weathering and landscape evolution...|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to advance methods for {{assessment}} of forest road hydrologic response and sediment yield at a catchment scale. This research looked at the effect of <b>soil</b> <b>depth</b> estimation on the Distributive Hydrology Soil Vegetation Model (DHSVM), assessed the uncertainty and accuracy of hydrologic modeling of forest roads by DHSVM, and evaluated the use of road runoff and sediment sampling for catchment scale road sediment estimates. The influence of <b>soil</b> <b>depth</b> estimation on DHSVM varied by spatial scale and hydrologic process modeled. <b>Soil</b> <b>depth</b> measurement improved DHSVM simulated streamflow and road ditchflow for the rising limb of the hydrograph with no improvements during baseflow. For site specific or small scale modeling a deterministic <b>soil</b> <b>depth</b> model fit to field measurements was best. For larger scale simulations of streamflow mean <b>soil</b> <b>depth</b> provided as good or better estimates.
