40|$|The {{drive for}} risk-based food safety management, systems and control has spread world-wide in recent decades. Since {{the term is}} still internationally undefined, its use and {{implementation}} vary, producing different realizations. In this Ph. D. thesis, microbiological risk assessment (MRA) was investigated {{as a basis for}} risk-based food safety management, which was defined as ‘food safety management based on risk assessment in order to achieve an appropriate level of protection (ALOP) ’. Governments are responsible for commissioning MRAs and also for setting food safety targets up to a certain point, but the practical management measures that need to be in place in order to achieve the targets are to be addressed by the operators. On the plant level, food safety is usually managed through regulation, quality assurance systems and a hazard analysis and critical control point (HACCP) programme with its prerequisites. In Finland, food safety management on the food plant level is implemented through an HACCP-like regulated system termed an ownchecking (OC) programme. A quantitative microbiological risk assessment (QMRA) was conducted on salmonella in the beef production chain according to the official standards of the Codex Alimentarius Commission (Codex Alimentarius), and utilized in determining the food safety metrics for beef production. The Finnish Salmonella Control Programme (FSCP) and the main official interventions due to it were examined in the light of risk-based food safety management. The targets set for beef processing plants by the government were converted into quantitative limits, and the results of salmonella monitoring included in the FSCP were examined by the QMRA. The goal of the FSCP was declared in 1994 to ‘maintain the present salmonella situation’, which was considered to refer to the salmonella incidence in humans at that time, and also the de facto ALOP. The requirement for a maximum salmonella prevalence of 1 % at defined stages of the beef production chain was embodied in the FSCP. This statement was considered to convey performance objectives (PO) for the aforementioned stages. According to the QMRA, the de facto ALOP was achieved in the referred year 1999, and even the true prevalence levels in the FSCP were estimated to be clearly under the <b>set</b> <b>PO</b> limits with 95 % credibility. However, the PO limits were set too high for the de facto ALOP to be maintained in practice. If the salmonella prevalence reached the PO limit of 1 % or values near it, the public health risk would increase and overrun the de facto ALOP. The QMRA produced in this work has for the first time provided the possibility to quantitatively asses the relationships between targets set in the FSCP and their impact on public health. At present, imports of beef and beef-derived foods may impose on Finnish consumers a significantly greater exposure than domestic products. If their salmonella prevalence or their share of the foods consumed in Finland increase, the number of human cases could rapidly rise. The models for the QMRA were mainly Bayesian hierarchical models using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques, which was found to be a flexible and appropriate method for this type of complex modelling. The resulting distributions were also regarded as an advantage compared to the results from models developed with the deterministic approach, because the presentation of results included the extent of the uncertainty, and also in this manner better illustrated the actual operational environment. Based on an inquiry, the personnel in food processing plants had a positive attitude towards food safety management systems, but the knowledge, training and involvement of those employees directly operating on the site with these systems were discovered to be deficient. Therefore, a generic semi-quantitative hygiene risk assessment model, Hygram®, was developed for small and medium-sized food enterprises to offer assistance in understanding, training, and, first of all, detecting the critical steps of the processes, and thereby to {{contribute to the development of}} their own-checking systems towards risk-based food safety management. Hygram® was not considered a risk-based tool as such, but whenever the critical limits of the process have been defined as equal to a risk assessment, Hygram® can be used as a risk-based management tool. It can also serve as a tool for systematic hazard analysis and CCP detection when establishing a food safety management system. To conclude, the development of risk-based food safety management is a process in which risk assessment is an essential tool. Scientific, technical, psychological and resource-bound barriers need to be overcome in order to put risk-based management systems into practice. This study showed that QMRA can be valuable in national risk management decision making, although few QMRAs are currently available. Appropriate tools for practical risk management decision making on the industrial level, such as Hygram®, need to be further developed...|$|E

40|$|A {{frequent}} {{problem in}} holomorphic dynamics is to prove local connectivity of Julia sets and of many {{points of the}} Mandelbrot set; local connectivity has many interesting implications. The intention {{of this paper is}} to present a new point of view for this problem: we introduce fibers of these sets (Definition 2. 3), and the goal becomes to show that fibers are "trivial", i. e. they consist of single points. The idea is to show "shrinking of puzzle pieces" without using specific puzzles. This implies local connectivity at these points, but triviality of fibers is a somewhat stronger property than local connectivity. Local connectivity proofs in holomorphic dynamics often actually yield that fibers are trivial, and this extra knowledge is sometimes useful.

Poster Board Number: # 94 International audienceBackground: Blockade of PI 3 K/AKT/mTOR pathway by E combined with T in HER 2 + BC pts shows promising results. It {{has also been}} reported that T acted differently when used in <b>PO</b> <b>setting</b> with a lower implication of signaling blockade and a higher induction of ADCC when used alone in chemotherapy naive pts. Additionally, mTOR blockade has been experimentally reported to activate MAPK pathway through a feed-back loop effect. We present {{the results of a}} biological integrated approach including markers of PI 3 K/AKT/mTOR and MAPK pathways, proliferation and immune environment in HER- 2 + PBC treated with T +/- E in <b>PO</b> <b>setting.</b> Methods: Eligible pts with HER 2 + PBC (IHC 3 + or FISH/SISH+) amenable to surgery were randomized to receive T (loading dose 4 mg/kg, then 2 mg/kg/W), or T+E (10 mg/d) for a 6 W PO treatment. All pts had baseline core needle biopsies, tissue collected at surgery and blood samples for biomarkers and pharmacokinetic analyses. FFPE samples were used for PIK 3 CA mutation status and IHC (pAKT, pS 6 K, eIF 4 E, LKB 1, p 4 EBP 1, Ki 67, caspase 3, PTEN, CD 8, CD 68). Frozen samples were used for multiplex immunoanalyses of phosphorylated PI 3 K/AKT/mTOR and MAPKinase signaling proteins (p-AKT, p-GSK 3, p-P 70 S 6 K, p-MEK 1, p-ERK 1 / 2, p-P 90 RSK). Results: FFPE and frozen tumor samples (n = 80), were obtained from 82 pts randomized from July 2008 to April 2012 (41 per arm). At baseline, only PIK 3 CA mutation status was predictive of clinical response, whatever the arm. No difference in the expression of phosphorylated signaling kinases was induced by exposure to T while T+E induced a significant activation of MAPKinase pathway. Between baseline and surgery we observed a down regulation of pAKT pS 6 K, LKB 1, Ki 67, a lower expression of PTEN and an increase in lymphocytes (CD 8 +) and macrophages (CD 68 +) infiltrates in both arms. Conclusions: These results confirm that in <b>PO</b> <b>setting,</b> T +/- E should mostly act via the activation immune response through tumor-associated lymphocytes and macrophages infiltrates. Rapid decrease in PTEN and LKB 1 may be related to early cellular mechanism of resistance to HER 2 inhibition. Clinical trial information: NCT 0067441...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{demonstrate}} how Performance Objectives (POs) for Salmonella at various points in the broiler supply chain can be estimated, starting from pre-set levels of the PO in finished products. The estimations were performed using an analytical transmission model, based on prevalence data collected throughout the chain in The Netherlands. In the baseline (current) situation, the end <b>PO</b> was <b>set</b> at 2. 5 % of the finished products (at end of processing) being contaminated with Salmonella. Scenario analyses were performed by reducing this baseline end PO to 1. 5 % and 0. 5 %. The results showed the end PO could be reduced by spreading the POs over the various stages of the broiler supply chain. Sensitivity analyses were performed by changing the values of the model parameters. Results indicated that, in general, decreasing Salmonella contamination between points in the chain is more effective in reducing the baseline PO than increasing the reduction of the pathogen, implying contamination should be prevented rather than treated. Application of both approaches at the same time showed to be most effective in reducing the end PO, especially at the abattoir and during processing. The modelling approach of this study proved to be useful to estimate the implications for preceding stages of the chain by <b>setting</b> a <b>PO</b> at the end of the chain as well as to evaluate the effectiveness of potential interventions in reducing the end PO.

40|$|Uncertainty issues {{associated}} with a multisite, multiproduct supply chain planning problem has been analyzed in this paper, using the chance constrained programming (CCP) approach. In the literature, such problems have been addressed using the scenario-based two-stage stochastic programming approach. Although this approach has merits, in terms of decomposition, the computational complexity, even for small-size planning problems, is generally quite large, leading to either huge time consumption in solving the problem or an inability to solve big instances of problems under a standard solver environment. To make the aforementioned lacunea of two-stage stochastic programming more tractable, the problems under uncertainty have been recast in this paper in a CCP framework that uses a more suitable representation of uncertainty. Addressing uncertainty issues in product demands and machine uptime, using the CCP approach, leads to the evaluation of multiobjective tradeoffs that are analyzed here in the Pareto sense, and the e-constraint approach is used to generate those Pareto optimal (PO) points. Different aspects of uncertainty issues are analyzed in detail by taking a few PO points among the total <b>set</b> of <b>PO</b> solutions found for this problem. It is seen that this CCP-based approach is quite generic, relatively simple to use and can be adapted for bigger size planning problems, as the equivalent deterministic problem does not blow up in size with the CCP approach.

40|$|Genetic {{risk for}} {{schizophrenia}} (SCZ) {{is determined by}} many genetic loci whose compound biological effects are difficult to determine. We hypothesized that co-expression pathways of SCZ risk genes are associated with system-level brain function and clinical phenotypes of SCZ. We examined genetic variants related to the dopamine D 2 receptor gene DRD 2 co-expression pathway and associated them with working memory (WM) behavior, the related brain activity and treatment response. Using two independent post-mortem prefrontal messenger RNA (mRNA) data sets (total N = 249), we identified a DRD 2 co-expression pathway enriched for SCZ risk genes. Next, we identified non-coding single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with co-expression of this pathway. These SNPs were associated with regulatory genetic loci in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (Po 0. 05). We summarized their compound effect on co-expression into a Polygenic Co-expression Index (PCI), which predicted DRD 2 pathway co-expression in both mRNA data <b>sets</b> (all <b>Po</b> 0. 05). We associated the PCI with brain activity during WM performance in two independent samples of healthy individuals (total N = 368) and 29 patients with SCZ who performed the n-back task. Greater predicted DRD 2 pathway prefrontal co-expression was associated with greater prefrontal activity and longer WM reaction times (all corrected Po 0. 05), thus indicating inefficient WM processing. Blind prediction of treatment response to antipsychotics in two independent samples of patients with SCZ suggested better clinical course of patientswith greater PCI (total N = 87; Po 0. 05). The findings on this DRD 2 co-expression pathway are a proof of concept that gene co-expression can parse SCZ risk genes into biological pathways associated with intermediate phenotypes {{as well as with}} clinically meaningful information...|$|R

The Palaeogene-Neogene tectonic activity of the Tonale nappe, pertaining to the Giudicarie fault system in the internal Alpine chain, is testified by both ductile (mylonites) and brittle (pseudotachylytes) indicators. The present-day seismotectonic activity of the Giudicarie-Lessini region (Southern Alps) was highlighted by seismicity, focal mechanisms, and directions of principal stress and strain axes.

40|$|The {{distance}} (the A-distance) {{which is}} determined by given orientations is proposed by P. Widmayer, Y. F. Wu and C. K. Wong[10]. In this article, we consider a single facility location problem under the A-distance with respect to minisum criterion, study properties of the optimal solution for the problem, and propose “The Iterative Algorithm ” to find aU optimal solutions. In R^ 2, we consider the problem _X∈ R^ 2 F(x) =∑_i= 1 ^nw_id_A(x,y_i), where d_A is the A-distance. For each demand point and each given orientation, we draw a oriented line which passes the point. Then a plane is divided into regions. We call a point passing some lines an intersectio npo int. It is shown that there exists an optimal solution in the <b>set</b> of intersection <b>po</b> ints. Let P be the smallest convex polygon including ffi demand points, which all boundary lines are given orientated lines. It is shown that any optimaJ solution is in P. We propose “The Iterative Algorithm”, where the solution in each step is an interseciion po int. This algorithm is as follows : We choose any demand point as an initial solution. The solution in {{the next step is}} determined as the adjacent intersection po int in the steepest orientation among orientations according to lines which passes the present solution. We also propose the method to determine the adjacent intersectio n point easily by sorting lines...|$|R

Osredotočili smo se na raziskavo med ocenjevanjem delavcev in samoocenjevanjem vodstva podjetja Tehnika <b>Set,</b> d. d., <b>po</b> modelu EFQM. Raziskava, ki je temelj naloge, vključuje mnenja delavcev o vodenju vodstva podjetja in mnenja vodstva. Na podlagi enakega anketnega vprašalnika smo izvedli primerjalno analizo med delavci in vodstvom. Z njim smo ugotavljali razlike med ocenjevanjem obeh ciljnih skupin. Naloga prikazuje rezultate raziskave vseh devetih načel, kot jih predvideva model EFQM. Na podlagi tega smo poskusili poiskati povezavo med modelom in družbeno odgovornostjo podjetja. Namen naloge je na konkretni raziskavi pokazati princip modela EFQM in morebitno povezavo z družbeno odgovornostjo. Namen naloge je tudi ugotoviti, ali izbrano podjetje deluje v skladu z družbeno odgovornostjo in kje se to najbolj izraža. The paper {{talks about}} the EFQM model and {{corporate}} social responsibility, with {{a greater emphasis on}} their conjunction. We focused on the research during the assessment of workers and self-assessments of the company management Tehnika set d. d., according to the EFQM model. The research, which is the basis of this paper, includes the employees’ opinion on the conduct of the company’s management, and the opinion of the management. We carried out a comparative analysis between workers and the leadership, based on equal questionnaire. According to this, we searched the differences between the assessment of both target groups. This work represents the results of a research of all nine principles, as foreseen by the EFQM model. Therefore, we tried to find a link between a model and a social responsibility of the company. The aim of the work is to demonstrate the principle of EFQM model on a concrete study and possible link with corporate social responsibility. Moreover, the aim is to determine whether the selected company operates in accordance with corporate social responsibility and where this expresses the most...|$|R
40|$|Aseptic Ultra-High-Temperature (UHT) -type {{processed}} food products (e. g. milk or soup) {{are ready to}} eat products which are consumed extensively globally due {{to a combination of}} their comparative high quality and long shelf life, with no cold chain or other preservation requirements. Due to the inherent microbial vulnerability of aseptic-UHT product formulations, the safety and stability-related Performance Objectives (POs) required {{at the end of the}} manufacturing process are the most demanding found in the food industry. The key determinants to achieving sterility, and which also differentiates aseptic-UHT from in-pack sterilised products, are the challenges associated with the processes of aseptic filling and sealing. This is a complex process that has traditionally been run using deterministic or empirical process settings. Quantifying the risk of microbial contamination and recontamination along the aseptic-UHT process, using the scientifically based process Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment (QMRA) offers the possibility to improve on the currently tolerable sterility failure rate (i. e. 1 defect per 10, 000 units). In addition, benefits of applying QMRA are to implement process settings in a transparent and scientific manner; ii) to develop a uniform common structure whatever the production line, leading to a harmonisation of these process settings, and; iii) to bring elements of a cost-benefit analysis of the management measures. The objective of this article is to explore how QMRA techniques and risk management metrics may be applied to aseptic-UHT-type {{processed food}} products. In particular, the aseptic-UHT process should benefit from a number of novel mathematical and statistical concepts that have been developed in the field of QMRA. Probabilistic techniques such as Monte Carlo simulation, Bayesian inference and sensitivity analysis, should help in assessing the compliance with safety and stability-related <b>POs</b> <b>set</b> at the end of the manufacturing process. The understanding of aseptic-UHT process contamination will be extended beyond the current "As-Low-As-Reasonably-Achievable" targets to a risk-based framework, through which current sterility performance and future process designs can be optimised.

30|$|We apply a {{traditional}} cross-correlation approach (e.g., Ando et al. 1983; Fukao 1984) for estimating the splitting parameters (the fast polarization direction and delay time) {{of the marine}} sediment layer and oceanic (igneous) crust and count the cumulative number of both parameters in three regions: two outer-rise regions and a seaward region. Both parameters were obtained at OBSs located in each region and plotted in rose diagrams and histograms, respectively. This allowed us to use splitting information at OBSs where clear Pos waves were observed, {{but the number of}} available records was minimal due to the short observation periods. Time windows of 0.6  s were used from handpicked Pos 1 and Pos 2 arrival times. The delay time search ranges of both layers were within 0.15  s, as determined by typical time delays at each layer and region. For each trace, the fast polarization direction and delay time of the marine sediment layer were estimated using Pos 1 with a t test error estimation (e.g., Kuo et al. 1994; Chang et al. 2009; Giannopoulos et al. 2015). If C (cross-correlation coefficient)[*]>[*] 0.9, ∆t (delay time)[*]≥[*] 0.03  s, and ∆t error[*]<[*] 0.03  s, the anisotropic effect of the sediment layer was removed from Pos 2 (Oda 2011) under the assumption the Pos 1 and Pos 2 emerging in each trace have similar incidence angles of S waves within the marine sediment and suffer similar splitting effects. The anisotropic structure of the oceanic crust was estimated using the corrected Pos 2. When C[*]>[*] 0.9 and ∆t[*]<[*] 0.03  s, the anisotropic structure of the oceanic crust was also estimated using the uncorrected Pos 2. Because signal-to-noise ratios of Pos 2 were small compared with those of Pos 1, the acceptance criterion was lowered to C[*]>[*] 0.8. Additional criteria were <b>set</b> for the <b>Pos</b> amplitude: (1) Pos arrival times can be handpicked, and (2) the S/N of Pos waves is greater than 2, in which S/N is defined as the ratio of the root-mean-square (RMS) amplitudes of Pos waves of 0.6  s over the noise records of −[*] 2 to 0  s in the NCF lag time.|$|R
40|$|Delivery Precision {{is a key}} {{performance}} indicator that measures Nike's ability to deliver product to the customer in full and on time. The objective of the six-month internship was to quantify areas in the supply chain where the most opportunities reside in improving delivery precision. The Nike supply chain starts when a new product is conceived and ends when the consumer buys the product at retail. In between conception and selling, there are six critical process steps. The project has provided a method to evaluate the entire supply chain and determine the area that has the most opportunity for improvement and therefore needs the most focus. The first step in quantifying the areas with the most opportunity was to identify a framework of the supply chain. The framework includes the target dates that must be met in order to supply product to the customer on schedule and the actual dates that were met. By comparing the target dates to the actual dates, {{the area of the}} supply process that caused the delay can be identified. Next a data model was created that automatically compares the target dates to actual dates for a large and specified set of purchase orders. The model uses the framework and compiles all orders to quantify the areas in the supply chain that create the most area for opportunity. The model was piloted on the North America geography, Women's Training category, Apparel product engine, and Spring 2013 season, for orders shipped to the Distribution Center (DC). The pilot showed that the most area for opportunity lies in the upstream process (prior to the product reaching the consolidator). In particular the pilot showed that the area with the most opportunity for the sample <b>set</b> was the <b>PO</b> create process. This conclusion was also confirmed with the Running category. The method developed during the internship provides Nike with a method to measure the entire supply chain. By quantifying the areas in the process, Nike can focus and prioritize their efforts on those areas that need the most improvement. In addition the model created can be scaled for any region, category, or product engine to ultimately improve delivery precision across the entire company. by Tacy J. Napolillo. Thesis: M. B.
