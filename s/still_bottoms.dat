5000|$|From 1970 to 1972, NEPACCO was {{primarily}} {{involved in the}} production of hexachlorophene (3), an antibacterial agent used in soap, toothpaste, and common household disinfectants, from 2,4,5-trichlorophenol (1) and formaldehyde (2).2,4,5-trichlorophenol is synthesized from 1,2,4,5-tetrachlorobenzene by the nucleophilic aromatic substitution reaction with sodium hydroxide (NaOH). Unfortunately, instantaneous dimerization of the resulting phenol produces trace amounts of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, an extremely toxic compound known to have both acute and chronic adverse effects.Beginning the process of production with 2,4,5-trichlorophenol that contained 3-5 parts per million (ppm) of dioxin, NEPACCO was able to reduce the concentration of dioxin in hexachlorophene to 0.1 ppm. The result of this purification process led to the storage and accumulation of heavily concentrated dioxin <b>still</b> <b>bottoms,</b> or thick, oily residues, in a storage tank located near the facility in Verona. When NEPACCO first began operations, the <b>still</b> <b>bottoms</b> were sent to a waste facility in Louisiana for incineration. [...] Although incineration was the best method to destroy dioxins at the time, it was also very expensive. Looking for less costly alternatives, NEPACCO contracted the services of the Independent Petrochemical Corporation (IPC). However, IPC, a chemical supplier company, knew very little about waste disposal, and subcontracted the NEPACCO job to Russell Martin Bliss, the owner of a small and local waste oil business. Charging NEPACCO $3000 per load, IPC paid Bliss $125 per load. Between February and October 1971, Bliss collected six truckloads (nearly 18,500 gallons) of chemical waste heavily contaminated with dioxin. Bliss took most of the <b>still</b> <b>bottoms</b> to his storage facility near Frontenac, Missouri, where the contaminated NEPACCO waste was unloaded and mixed into tanks containing used crankcase oils. Subsequently, some of the contaminated oil was sold to MT Richards, a fuel company in Illinois, and to the Midwest Oil Refining Company in Overland, Missouri.|$|E

NEPACCO had paid James Denney, {{the owner of the}} farm, $150 for the use of his property. Under the investigations of the EPA, a total of ninety drums, all of which were corroded and leaky, were unearthed. Eleven of these drums contained <b>still</b> <b>bottoms</b> with dioxin concentrations as high as 2,000 ppm.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2012 While {{perchloroethylene}} solvent based {{dry cleaners}} occupational exposures and machine wastes {{have been well}} characterized, {{little is known about}} exposures to alternative solvent s and their wastes or the hazardous waste status of the wastes. Additionally, knowledge of detergents and spot treatment products is sparse. Samples of <b>still</b> <b>bottoms</b> and separator water, and cleaning products were taken from ten petroleum based hydrocarbon solvent dry cleaners in King County and one cleaner using a new solvent (Solvon K 4) to the market based on butylal. The samples were analyzed for volatile organic compounds (VOC), semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOC), metals, pH, flash point, and total organic halogens (TOH). This information was used to characterize the waste using Washington State hazardous waste criteria. All samples of hydrocarbon and butylal <b>still</b> <b>bottoms</b> designated as dangerous waste on the basis of TOH. Five of the ten hydrocarbon solvent still bottom samples also had flash points below 140 ˚F as did one of the four butylal still bottom samples. Only one sample of separator water designated as dangerous. This sample was visually different from the others, with a clear layer of solvent on the surface. A wide variety of spot treatment products are used by the dry cleaners sampled. Six of these contained probable or potential carcinogens at concentrations greater than 0. 1 % not listed as such on the MSDS. Additionally, one of the seven detergents sampled contained 0. 11 % methylene chloride. These findings raise concerns for occupation exposure to toxic chemicals that the workers may not be aware of even if they have read the MSDS for the products they work with on a daily basis. The waste characterization indicates that waste from alternative solvent dry cleaners may be considered dangerous waste and should be treated as such with proper disposal and handling procedures...|$|E

40|$|When 55 -gal {{steel drum}} waste {{containers}} fail in service, i. e., leak, corrode or breach, the standard fix {{has been to}} overpack the drum. When a drum fails and is overpacked into an 83 -gal overpack drum, there are several negative consequences. Identifying waste streams that preferentially corrode steel drums {{is essential to the}} pollution prevention philosophy that ``an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. `` It is essential that facilities perform pollution prevention measures at the front end of processes to reduce pollution on the back end. If these waste streams can be identified before they are packaged, the initial drum packaging system could be fortified or increased to eliminate future drum failures, breaches, clean-ups, and the plethora of other consequences. Therefore, a survey was conducted throughout the US Department of Energy complex for information concerning waste streams that have demonstrated preferential corrosion of 55 -gal steel drums.

40|$|Inhibition of the lactose to ethanol {{fermentation}} of K. marxianus Y 113 was investigated. The use {{of initial}} lactose concentrations of 150 g/litre or greater resulted in less biomass accumulation, lower ethanol productivity and incomplete substrate utilisation. Keeping the initial lactose concentration at 100 g/litre but increasing the medium osmolality {{by up to}} 5 times via the addition of non-utilised salt or maltose resulted in substantially reduced biomass accumulation and slightly lower ethanol productivity. This suggested that high medium osmolality inhibits the yeast in a non-specific way by increasing the energy required for cell maintenance {{at the expense of}} biomass production. Keeping the intial lactose concentration at 100 g/litre but adding up to 5 % (by weight) ethanol reduced the amount and rate of biomass accumulation and led to incomplete substrate utilisation, as well as dramatically lowering the amount of ethanol produced by the least itself. The detrimental effects of added ethanol became significant only when more than 2 to 3 % (by weight) was added. A maximum alcohol concentration of 4 to 5 % (by weight) was observed in all cases, irrespective of the concentration of ethanol added initially. These results suggested that the ethanol inhibited the energy metabolism of the cell in some specific way and did not merely increase the requirement for cell maintenance energy. In the concentrations tried supplementation of the medium with yeast extract, magnesium, calcium and chitin all failed to produce any change in the performance of the fermentation. Supplementation with <b>still</b> <b>bottoms</b> was found to be quite strongly inhibitory to the fermentation.
