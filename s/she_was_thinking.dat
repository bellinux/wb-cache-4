5|$|In February 1846 Stone intimated to Abby Kelley Foster that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> of {{becoming}} a public speaker, but not until the following summer did a storm of controversy over Foster’s speaking at Oberlin decide the matter for her. Faculty opposition to Foster ignited impassioned discussion of women’s rights among the students, especially of woman’s right to speak in public, which Stone vigorously defended in a joint meeting of the men’s and women’s literary societies. She followed that campus demonstration by making her first public speech at Oberlin’s August 1 commemoration of Emancipation in the West Indies.|$|E

500|$|Beyoncé Knowles {{began working}} on her second solo album B'Day {{following}} the conclusion of filming for Dreamgirls. She revealed: [...] " [...] I had so many things bottled up, so many emotions, so many ideas". Beyoncé contacted American songwriter-producer Sean Garrett, and booked him at the Sony Music Studios in New York City, where [...] "Get Me Bodies" [...] was recorded. She also called American hip hop producer-rapper Kasseem [...] "Swizz Beatz" [...] Dean, her sister and singer, Solange, her cousin Angela Beyincé, and songwriter Makeba Riddick. Beyoncé took inspiration from Solange, who helped {{in the writing process}} of the song, and former Destiny's Child band-mates Kelly Rowland and Michelle Williams. In [...] "Get Me Bodied", she mentioned [...] "three best friends" [...] because <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> of them while writing. While working on the lyrics, Swizz Beatz and the other producers in the team handled its production.|$|E
500|$|Additionally, {{aside from}} the three men, Carey worked with Carole King, a female singer-songwriter who had been {{predominantly}} popular in the 1970s. However, unlike with C+C Music Factory, King approached Carey, hoping {{to work with her}} after hearing her perform live on The Arsenio Hall Show. During a conversation with Carey, King suggested that she cover [...] "(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman," [...] a song she had written with Gerry Goffin for Aretha Franklin. After giving it some thought, Carey declined the offer, feeling uncomfortable about recording a song she felt one of her musical influences performed so perfectly. Still determined on working with Carey, King flew to New York for one day, to try to create a ballad of some sort. The two ladies sat together by a piano {{over the course of the}} day, and by nightfall, had written and arranged a song titled [...] "If It's Over." [...] After working with Carey, King said in an interview [...] "I love her voice. She's very expressive. She gives a lot of meaning to what she sings." [...] After recording [...] "If It's Over," [...] Carey expressed the musical connection she shared with Afanasieff, as well as the creative format in which she wrote and produced her music when with him, or working with C+C Music Factory. When working with Afanasieff, the duo would sit by a piano, and lead each other vocally and musically, until they would reach the right note and arrangement. During an interview in 1992, Afanasieff described how Carey would stand next to him, and begin singing different notes and tunes <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> of, while he would follow her with the piano. In doing so, he would help lead her to the right note and vice versa. Carey described their working relationship as [...] "very unique," [...] and felt it to be very similar to the form in which she had worked with Margulies. While similar, Carey's creative process with Cole and Clivillés proved different; they would bring her several different tapes and tunes, of which she would choose from. Afterwards, they would work on building the already created melody, and have Carey add and build onto it, as well as writing the lyrics and key.|$|E

In March 1936, Faustina told her superiors that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> of leaving the order to start a new one specifically devoted to Divine Mercy, but she was transferred to Walendów, southwest of Warsaw. She reported that Jesus had said to her: [...] "My Daughter, do whatever is within your power to spread devotion to My Divine Mercy, I will make up for what you lack." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{film was}} shot during {{the span of}} five weeks after {{intensive}} location-scouting by Pawlikowski. The script only contained 35 pages and was incomplete. Many scenes were improvised while shooting. [...] The scene in which Mona draws a portrait of Tamsin {{on the wall of}} her room was entirely improvised—during Pawlikowski's travelling together with Press, he discovered that she used {{to do a lot of}} drawing while <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking,</b> so he decided to integrate it into the movie and made a scene out of it. [...] The whole shoot was done on location in Todmorden during the hottest summer Yorkshire had seen in 50 years.|$|E

2500|$|She {{got started}} in the field when she met an agent while she was working at a cabaret club. She at first refused the offer but then decided to [...] "give it a shot".

She has {{said that she was}} nervous at her debut and had to take [...] "lots of breaks". The actors and director were angry with her, and <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> of giving up and going home. She remembers that first director as being a [...] "really weird man by the name Happy Yamada", a unique person. She would go on to work with Yamada in numerous videos over the next two years.|$|E
2500|$|Conwell {{talked to}} Zap2it about Leslie's romance with Neil, stating [...] "hopefully we'll be working {{together}} more. I {{think they have}} good energy." [...] They have since began to inch closer and {{he gave her a}} job offer for Jabot Cosmetics. Luke Kerr from Daytime Confidential recapped the storyline, [...] "At Jabot, Leslie told Neil she couldn’t accept his job offerbecause <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> about him as a man. She told him it would be inappropriate for them to end up in a relationship if they were working together. Neil finally convinced her that if they had an overwhelming urge to date, he would fire her. Leslie accepted the job." [...] In December 2012, Redaric Williams was introduced to the series as her brother Tyler Michaelson, Leslie's first family member to appear on the soap opera. Williams told Soap Opera Digest that although Tyler is [...] "impatient", he gets along with his sister [...] "really well" [...] and they are [...] "very comfortable with each other".|$|E
2500|$|... "Daddy" [...] is {{the second}} single {{released}} from the album. It was the first song that she and Naughty Boy had worked together on and she {{pointed out that the}} song {{has nothing to do with}} her father. It has the sound of an early 1990s dance hit, and the song has been compared to the music by Seal and Adamski. The track is about her struggle while trying to get into the music industry and how people can get fanatical about money, drugs, fame or religion. [...] "Daddy" [...] also represents how that one thing you can keep returning to, like how drug addiction in the music industry and how easy it is to turn to. However, at the same time as she wrote the song <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> about The Jeremy Kyle Show, and the fact that people laugh at the people on that show, and that they are desperate enough to go on the show and talk about their problems. She also said that the song was written very quickly in two or three hours.|$|E

2500|$|After leaving Morgan, Kiki {{immediately}} {{starts a}} romance with Michael. The pairing would pair Alderson {{back with her}} real-life boyfriend Chad Duell whom she worked with as Starr. Alderson worried about how fans would react to Kiki and Michael's relationship because Starr and Kiki are so different and [...] "it was interesting to see Michael with Kiki" [...] who is a lot less refined than Starr. However, the romance doesn't get much development, and ends a year later when Michael dumps Kiki after discovering she has been keeping quiet about Sonny's part {{in the murder of}} his biological father, A. J. Quartermaine (Sean Kanan). Hayley Erin later said, [...] "When she was with Michael, I don't think <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> about Michael." [...] While she was definitely fully invested in the relationship, Kiki also had feelings for Morgan. [...] "Michael wouldn't be good for her now."

Afterwards, in an ambiguous ending, Séverine is amazed when Pierre suddenly gets out of his wheel chair and pours himself a drink.
