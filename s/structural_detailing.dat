In the period of last two years, on the author’s workplace, in the co-operation with the mounting company, the new type of steel footbridge is being developed. Within this development the attention is, among others, paid to the structural design, in particular to the harmonization of static solution and <b>structural</b> <b>detailing,</b> to achieve the efficient design. In the course of solving this problem, two types of the footbridge are being developed in parallel. Both footbridges are composed as the structures with a lower deck, truss main girders and bracings; the first structure (short footbridge) with a small self weight may have the span up to 18 m; the second structure (long footbridge) with a normal self weight may have the span up to 36 m. The paper {{is focused on the}} brief description of structural composition and parameters of the short footbridge, as well as <b>structural</b> <b>detailing</b> of the joints of main load-carrying parts.

40|$|The {{performance}} {{assessment of}} structures {{is subjected to}} various sources of uncertainties. One {{of the most challenging}} aspects of the seismic assessment of existing buildings is the characterization of structural modeling uncertainties since it measures the incomplete knowledge of the structural properties in as-built conditions. It is possible to distinguish between two different sources of structural modeling uncertainties in the assessment of existing buildings: uncertainty in the mechanical properties of materials used in construction and the uncertainty in construction details that affect the component capacities. It is important {{to take into account the}} uncertainties in the construction details since the variations in <b>structural</b> <b>detailing</b> parameters (a. k. a. structural defects) can be quite significant; to the extent that they may change the eventual structural collapse mechanism. The focus of this work is to provide a basis for the characterization of the uncertainties related to the construction details attributed to the as-built conditions of the structure. This is achieved by interpreting and quantifying the common pool of knowledge created by professional experience into prior probability distributions. These prior probability distributions can be used in a Bayesian framework in order to take into account the uncertainties in the construction details before implementing the data provided by the tests and inspections. An expert-opinion survey addressed to practicing engineers has been conducted. The preliminary results obtained by interviewing a group of practicing structural engineers are presented.

The analyses focus on rotational stiffness (k) of the joints by considering three different sub-structural idealisations according to the required modelling details and the feasibility of model reductions.

40|$|Existing {{reinforced}} concrete (RC) frame structures were often designed for gravitational actions and without adopting the modern seismic design criteria, even in currently recognised seismic area. Therefore, {{they are generally}} vulnerable to seismic events due to the poor <b>structural</b> <b>detailing</b> adopted in beams, columns and joints, which are consequently affected by brittle failure modes and, then, characterised by limited displacement capacity. In fact, during their lifetime these frames {{are likely to be}} subjected to earthquakes which can unveil the aforementioned vulnerability and result in structural collapses even under moderate seismic actions. Besides the lack in the global conceptual design of the RC frames under consideration, structural failures can also be induced by the local response of their single members which is characterised by a significant degradation under cyclic actions. Nevertheless, the capacity models currently available for beams columns and joints disregard the effect of the actual cyclic response of such components. In this regard, the present paper focuses on the cyclic response of beam-to-column joints in RC frames which are widely recognised as critical components in controlling the seismic response of structures. Particularly, it is intended at unveiling the relationships which describe the strength decay of RC joint under cyclic actions. Starting from a series of monotonic and cyclic tests reported in the scientific literature, a low-cycle fatigue approach is proposed for interpreting the strength decay observed in the tested RC joints {{as a function of the}} cyclic displacement history. The proposed elaborations clearly highlight that both strength decay and failure under cyclic actions can actually be described by a low-cycle fatigue relationship which is able to take into account both cycles’ number and amplitudes. Moreover, the fact that the parameters of the resulting low-cycle fatigue curves are clearly influenced by the adopted <b>structural</b> <b>detailing</b> and design criteria is probably the most impacting finding of the proposed research and shed new light on the definition of capacity models and failure criteria for the RC joints under consideration...|$|E

40|$|Conference Earthquake risk {{assessment}} of buildings inventory requires assessing {{the vulnerability of}} building to various levels of hazard. The lateral strength and deformation capacity of buildings with various categories differ due to reasons which include their construction vintage, material of construction, <b>structural</b> <b>detailing</b> and other structural characteristics. One {{of the biggest challenges}} in deriving the physical vulnerability model is to acquire an appropriate database of building inventory. In this paper, the types of building structures in New Zealand are reviewed and a suitable classification scheme is proposed. The historical code developments are discussed to emphasize the inherent building characteristics with respect to the building system and the vintage of the code. Further, to obtain the lateral strength and deformation profiles of the buildings, a rational procedure is developed based on the lines suggested for Initial and Detailed Assessment Procedures recommended by a study group of the New Zealand Society for Earthquake Engineering. In this paper, fragility functions are developed for typical wooden houses, masonry houses and reinforced-concrete moment resisting frames, which predominantly comprise the New Zealand inventory. ...|$|E
