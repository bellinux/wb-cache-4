5|$|The Vishnu sculptures {{found among}} the Elephanta ruins express {{different}} styles. One wears a dhoti and has a looped girdle, while holding a conch at an angle near his thigh. The remnants of his sides suggest that this was likely a four arm iconography. Another statue has elements of Shiva and Vishnu. It was identified to be Shiva by Pramod Chandra, as Kartikeya by Moti Chandra, and as Vishnu by others. It shows a chain link near the thigh, has a gada (mace) on side, and someone <b>standing</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> of a damaged upper portion but with small waist and full breasts suggestive of a devi. This statue too is wearing a dhoti.|$|E
5|$|Bleak then {{returned}} to the patrol and attempted to treat more wounded members, but soon thereafter a Chinese hand grenade bounced off the helmet of the soldier <b>standing</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> and landed nearby. Bleak tackled the soldier over and covered him with his larger frame to protect him from the grenade, but neither was injured in the ensuing blast. The patrol then continued on its mission, and was successful in capturing several Chinese prisoners. However, as it descended Hill 499 to return to UN lines, they were ambushed by another group of Chinese hidden in a trench with an automatic weapon. Three of the other soldiers were wounded in the attack, and as Bleak attempted to run to them, he was hit in the leg. Bleak dressed all four wounds, but one of the men had been hit too critically to move. In spite of continued Chinese fire and his own injury, Bleak picked up the wounded soldier and began to carry him down the hill.|$|E

Due to the extreme cold, Beadles was suffering from frostbite and was found floating unconscious in the water {{at the time of}} the evacuation and was subsequently sent to a military hospital in Malta. After recovering he was sent to re-join his regiment, who were now stationed in Palestine. He took part in all three attempts to capture Gaza and the eventual push to take Jerusalem under the command of Edmund Allenby. During the second battle of Gaza, Beadles witnessed the death of his uncle Richard Pearce who was shot in the head while <b>standing</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>him.</b> Beadles' brother Ewart was awarded the Military Medal and promoted to the rank of Sergeant for his actions during the battle.|$|E

He handed over command of No.3 Squadron later that month, and was transferred to No.1 Mobile Operations Room Unit as forward air controller for the final assault on Monte Cassino. The run of luck that Eaton experienced in his first weeks of air combat in Tunisia continued on the ground in Italy. He survived three months of constant artillery fire, including an occasion when a shell exploded directly above his observation post, striking down a British officer <b>standing</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>him.</b> He also came under machine-gun fire when he took a wrong turn one day and drove into the German lines, but again escaped unhurt.

50|$|Cahuzac never categorically {{denied the}} {{authenticity}} of the recording. He is known to have said that out of all these minutes of conversation, {{there may have been a}} few seconds where it was indeed him speaking. Following the amount of press coverage, proof and criticism stemming from the recording’s leakage, President Hollande had no other choice but <b>to</b> release <b>him</b> from his duties as Minister of Budget on the 19th of March, 2013. Mr. Cahuzac was accused of money laundering and fiscal fraud, two crimes that inevitably go hand-in-hand. He later admitted to having transferred 600,000 euros to a bank account in Singapore. Subsequently, he was condemned to three years in Prison along with a 375,000 euro fine. The judges on the case deemed this sentence necessary because of the “traitorous” nature of his acts and words - “especially when put in contrast with his job responsibilities and requirements” said one of the judges. He can however decide to appeal the decision reached by the Justice officials. Conjointly, his ex-wife Patricia Cahuzac is <b>standing</b> trial <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> for “family fiscal fraud.” Having, in addition to the things previously stated, participated in the creation of various shell companies, she was consequently condemned to two years of prison.|$|R

As Aaron approached the scene he discovered the gun, and, upon seeing that Robert had been shot with Chas <b>standing</b> right <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> presumed she had shot Robert and so took the gun to protect her. Aaron pleads not guilty and Robert tries to goad Aaron into telling the truth. Aaron angrily shouts that he should have done everyone a favour and died.

2500|$|The first {{broadside}} sent splinters {{flying in}} the President's spar deck where Decatur was standing.

Another splinter fatally fractured the skull of a Lieutenant next to him too. Before that point it may well have been believed that Endymion was a standard 18-pounder frigate as she was firing at president with only her brass 18-pounder long bow chaser. It was clear that 24-pounder shot form Endymion's broadside was much more effective than the 18-pounder shot that Decatur had experienced from the HMS Macedonian while he was aboard the United States.
