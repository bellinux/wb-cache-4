40|$|Thesis (M. Ing. (Chemical Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2012. The {{pollution}} of South Africa’s water resources puts {{a strain on}} an already stressed natural resource. One of the main pollution sources is industrial effluents such as acid mine drainage (AMD) and other mining effluents. These effluents usually contain high levels of acidity, heavy metals and sulphate. A popular method to treat these effluents before they are released into the environment is lime neutralisation. Although this method is very effective to raise the pH of the effluent {{as well as to}} precipitate the heavy metals, it can only partially remove the sulphate. Further treatment is required to reduce the sulphate level further to render the water suitable for discharge into the environment. A number of sulphate removal methods are available and used in industry. These methods can be divided into physical (membrane filtration, adsorption/ion exchange), chemical (chemical precipitation) and biological <b>sulphate</b> reduction <b>processes.</b> A literature study was conducted in order to compare these different methods. The ABC (Alkali – Barium – Calcium) Desalination process uses barium carbonate to lower the final sulphate concentration to an acceptable level. Not only can the sulphate removal be controlled due to the low solubility of barium sulphate, but it can also produce potable water and allows valuable by–products such as sulphur to be recovered from the sludge. The toxic barium is recycled within the process and should therefore not cause additional problems. In this study the <b>sulphate</b> removal <b>process,</b> using barium carbonate as reactant, was investigated. Several parameters have been investigated and studied by other authors. These parameters include different barium salts, different barium carbonate types, reaction kinetics, co–precipitation of calcium carbonate, barium–to–sulphate molar ratios, the effect of temperature and pH. The <b>sulphate</b> removal <b>process</b> was tested and verified on three different industrial effluents. The results and conclusions from these publications were used to guide the experimental work. A number of parameters were examined under laboratory conditions in order to find the optimum conditions for the precipitation reaction to take place. This included mixing rotational speed, barium–to–sulphate molar ratio, initial sulphate concentration, the effect of temperature and the influence of different barium carbonate particle structures. It was found that the reaction temperature and the particle structure of barium carbonate influenced the process significantly. The mixing rotational speed, barium–to–sulphate dosing ratios and the initial sulphate concentration influenced the removal process, but not to such a great extent as the two previously mentioned parameters. The results of these experiments were then tested and verified on AMD from a coal mine. The results from the literature analysis were compared to the experiments conducted in the laboratory. It was found that the results reported in the literature and the laboratory results correlated well with each other. Though, in order to optimise this <b>sulphate</b> removal <b>process,</b> one has to understand the sulphate precipitation reaction. Therefore it is recommended that a detailed reaction kinetic study should be conducted to establish the driving force of the kinetics of the precipitation reactions. In order to upgrade this process to pilot–scale and then to a full–scale plant, continuous reactor configurations should also be investigated. The sulphate removal stage in the ABC Desalination Process is the final treatment step. The effluent was measured against the SANS Class II potable water standard and was found that the final water met all the criteria and could be safely discharged into the environment. Master...|$|R

40|$|The world {{pulp and}} paper {{industry}} continues to expand production and increasingly, plants are being built in newly industrialised countries. The dominant process is the kraft or <b>sulphate</b> <b>process.</b> Historically, substantial pollution problems have been associated with pulp manufacturing operations. Following the recognition of large scale environmental contamination by organochlorines due to their formation in bleach plants, the industry implemented a number of process internal changes and continued to develop process external treatment processes. The bleach plant of kraft mills generates a substantial proportion of the total process effluents. The introduction of extended delignification and oxygen delignification can substantially reduce the quantities of lignin entering the bleach plant. Residues from oxygen delignification can be cycled to the recovery process. Overall, this reduces the demand for bleaching agents and hence reduces the generation of organochlorines. Together with substitution of elemental chlorine (Cl 2) with chlorine dioxide, these systems have substantially reduced levels of AOX being discharged from bleach kraft mills. Organochlorines, however, have not been eliminated from discharges, merely reduced. Swedish research has shown detectable levels of toxicologically chlorinated dioxins and dibenzofurans in the effluents from mills that use chlorine dioxide; so-called elemental chlorine free (ECF) mills.

Heartwood reduces the whiteness of pulp when the NSSC-pulping process is used, but not in the <b>sulphate</b> <b>process.</b> Poplar clones grown on mineral rich sites produce high quality pulp compared to those grown on poor sites.

The trees selected in this regard were Gmelina arborea Roxb., consisting of four levels of maturities, i. e. 6, 8, 10 and 12 years. The additives used in the process were polysulfide (PS) and anthraqinone. The anthraquinone (AQ) was added 0. 1 percent, without PS, and in the other cooking PS at 4. 0 percent, without AQ. Meanwhile, this modified <b>sulphate</b> <b>process</b> was also conducted with any additive 4. 0 percent PS and 0. 1 percent AQ. As a control. the sulphate cooking without both was carried out as well. Other cooking conditions were kept constant, i. e. active alkali 16 percent, sulphidity 25 percent, wood to liquor ratio 1 : 4, maximum temperature 170 °C. and total cooking durations 4 hours. The results revealed that the increase in tree maturity up to 10 years produced pulp with the highest yield. However. the pulp yield decreased when the maturity reached 12 years, which was the case when the pulp was obtained from the 6 -years wood material. The use of 0. 1 percent AQ additive did not improve the pulp yield but decreased the kappa number. The highest yield was obtained at 4. 0 percent PS additive, followed by the one using the combination of 4. 0 percent PS and 0. 1 percent AQ. Melina wood from the corresponding 6 year old trees appeared technically suitable as raw material for pulp, since it strength was fairly high to meet the Indonesian National Standard (SNI) for the one from long-fibered softwood. Besides that. the use of additive improved the strength of pulp...|$|E
40|$|Alliinase is {{a crucial}} enzyme in the Allium genus. The {{conversion}} of its substrates, cysteine sulfoxides, into volatile thiosulfinates is an important mechanism in the defence of the plant. It also provides the typical pungent flavour of garlic. As a matter of fact, the thiosulfinates decompose {{in a range of}} organosulfur compounds (OSC) known for their biological activities (antioxidant, anticancer, anti-diabetes properties, etc.). The environment of the decomposition of the thiosulfinates determines the type and amount of products released. A deeper knowledge of the conditions that form each OSC could help us in the preparation of garlic-based nutraceutics in the perspective of healthier food consumption. This study aims to improve the extraction and purification the enzyme alliinase in order to perform the reaction between the enzyme and its substrates and assess the potentialities of garlic preparations. Three methods have been applied to evaluate the efficiency of the extractions and purifications of the enzyme. A first idea of the purity of the enzyme is given by an electrophoresis separation of each sample on a polyacrylamide gel (SDS-PAGE). The protein content is then measured by UV-vis spectrometry with Lowry-Folin reagent for the coloration and BSA as an external standard. Finally, the specific activity is assessed by an indirect measure of the pyruvate (released as a co-product) : the addition of NADH and lactate dehydrogenase turns the pyruvate in lactate, and the disappearance of NADH is measured by UV-vis spectrometry at 340 nm. The extraction of the enzyme from garlic was performed either by PEG 8000 precipitation or by ammonium sulphate precipitation. Two purifications were tested: affinity chromatography (on ConA) and size-exclusion chromatography. The combination of the ammonium <b>sulphate</b> <b>process</b> with the ConA chromatography provided the purest enzyme, with the best activity but a lower yield than the size-exclusion process. Finally the stability of the enzyme has been assessed at 4, - 20 and - 80 °C, showing that the enzyme could be kept at - 80 °C for over 4 months without deterioration, while activity loss was observed at higher temperature.

40|$|One of {{the plant}} species which can be {{cultivated}} and enables the industrial plantation forest to be established for its timber/wood utilization is rubber trees. In dealing with rubber wood for pulp/paper processing, the residual latexes, despite in small amount, can bring about some nuisances, i. e. the troubles during the cooking, washing, and bleaching, {{and the appearance of}} dark pitch­spots {{on the surface of the}} resulting pulp/paper sheet. Inherent wich such, the main aim of this research was to remove or reduce to some effective degrees the residual latexes from rubber wood pulp cooked using kraft (<b>sulphate)</b> <b>process</b> by regulating the sulfidity of the cooking liquor (20, 25, 30 %), and by mixing rubber wood with four other wood species, i. e. sengon (Paraserianthes falcataria), jabon (Anthocephalus cadamba), tusam (Pinus merkusii Jungh et de Vries), and ekaliptus (Eucalyptus sp.) each with their specific gravity of 0. 63, 0. 30, 0. 52, and 0. 78, respectively. Changes in suljidity from 20 to 30 percent brought about significant decrease in the number of pitch­spots, caused by the residual latexes, on the surface of the resulting kraft pulp sheet. Meanwhile, changes in mixture between rubber wood and four other wood species with relative proportion (oven­dry weight) from 100 : 0 to 50 : 50, and finally to 25 : 75 brought about also the decrease in the number of pitch­spots. In the same occasion, changing the suljidity from 20 to 25 percent caused the increase in breaking­length from 3170 m to 3615 m (increasing by 14. 04 percent); tear factor from 97. 776 to 111. 100 (increasing by 13. 63 percent); and burst factor from 42. 913 to 53. 623 (increasing by 24. 96 percent). However, further changes in sulfidity from 25 percent to 30 percent brought about the decrease in breaking length and burst factor to 3232 m (decreasing by 10. 59 percent) and 48. 631 (decreasing by 9. 31 percent), respectively. In another case, changes in relative proportion of mixture between rubber wood and four other wood species from 100 : 0 to 25 : 75 induced the significant increase in burst factor and folding endurance from 44. 163 to 54. 357 (increasing by 23. 08 percent) and from 39. 47 to 83. 93 (increasing by 112. 64 percent) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{focus of}} this study was to {{characterize}} three industrially-prepared (via the <b>sulphate</b> synthesis <b>process)</b> nano-TiO 2 colloidal dispersions with the intention to elucidate their role on the hydrophilicity as well as UV shielding ability when applied onto polyamide fabric. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and UV spec-trophotometry of the selected dispersions proved the presence of TiO 2 nanoparticles of different shapes and sizes, as well as its imposing absorption capability within the UV region. In addition, TiO 2 dispersions in three concen-trations accompanied by selected chemicals and auxiliaries were applied on polyamide fabrics according to standard exhaustion procedure. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was adopted in order to analyse the morphological structure of nano-TiO 2 -upgraded PA fabrics. Furthermore, the UV-protective ability and hydrophilic properties were evaluated. The gained results show excellent blocking properties against UV-rays (UPF 50 +), as well as the (super) hydrophilicity of TiO 2 -modified PA fabrics, regarding the type of employed TiO 2 colloidal dispersion...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} a general nonlinear time-delay {{system in which}} the input signal is piecewise-constant. Such systems arise {{in a wide range of}} industrial applications, including evaporation and purification processes and chromatography. We assume that the time-delays—one involving the state variables and the other involving the input variables—are unknown and need to be estimated using experimental data. We formulate the problem of estimating the unknown delays as a nonlinear optimization problem in which the cost function measures the least-squares error between predicted and measured system output. The main difficulty with this problem is that the delays are decision variables to be optimized, rather than fixed values. Thus, conventional optimization techniques are not directly applicable. We propose a new computational approach based on a novel algorithm for computing the cost function’s gradient. We then apply this approach to estimate the time-delays in two industrial chemical processes: a zinc <b>sulphate</b> purification <b>process</b> and a sodium aluminate evaporation process...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{application}} of molecular techniques {{in recent years}} has advanced our understanding of phosphate and <b>sulphate</b> transport <b>processes</b> in plants. Genes encoding phosphate and sulphate transporters have been isolated from a number of plant species. The transporters encoded by these genes are related to the major facilitator superfamily of proteins. They are predicted to contain 12 membrane-spanning domains and function as H+/H 2 PO− 4 or H+/SO 2 − 4 cotransporters. Both high-affinity and low-affinity types have been identified. Most research has concentrated on genes that encode transporters expressed in roots. The expression of many of these genes is transcriptionally regulated by signals that respond to the nutrient status of the plant. Nutrient demand and the availability of precursors needed in the assimilatory pathways also regulate transcription of some of these genes. Information on the cell types in which phosphate and sulphate transporters are expressed is becoming available. These data, together with functional characterisation of the transporters, are enabling the roles of various transporters in the overall phosphate and sulphate nutrition of plants to be defined...|$|R
