40|$|Some typical {{applications}} where scuffing {{may occur}} are gear teeth, piston rings and cylinder pairs, cams and followers, splines, sleeve bearings, {{and parts of}} <b>swash</b> and wobble <b>plate</b> compressors. Unlike other tribology-related failures, scuffing occurs very fast, without any warning, and usually leads to the complete destruction of the sliding pair. Practical experience with steel has helped to outline safe ranges of operation for some components. Very little, however, is known about aluminum, which {{is the second most}} commonly used engineering metal. The aim {{of this study is to}} obtain a better understanding scuffing and seizure of aluminum/steel contacts. The research includes an experimental study of scuffing of aluminum/steel contacts under dry sliding conditions, a study of the physics of the scuffing process, evaluation of various hypotheses for scuffmg, and modeling of scuffing. The experiments are conducted in a custom-designed tribometer, which provides accurate control of the environmental conditions. Special instrumentation, experimental procedures and software are developed as a part of the experimental program. These provide a reliable reproduction and identification of scuffing under laboratory conditions. The scuffing characteristics of five materials are obtained in air and refrigerant (R 134 a) environments. The effects of load, sliding velocity, mechanical strength, environmental temperature, specimen geometry, time, loading history, and type of environment are evaluated. The mechanisms leading to scuffing are studied by examination of surfaces, subsurfaces and wear debris of specimens in the process of scuffing. Quantitative measurements of subsurface plastic strain are also obtained. The theoretical part of the study includes the development of a finite element model for the contact of runned-in rough surfaces and several other models for subsurface stresses, temperatures, and strains. These models provide information about the local conditions in the subsurface Based on the experimental observations and the scuffing models a new hypothesis for scuffing is proposed. According to this hypothesis, scuffing involves initiation of cracks due to subsurface plastic deformation, propagation of these cracks leading to the removal of the existing protective surface layers, and finally cold welding due to adhesion between bare metal surfaces.

50|$|A {{nutating}} disc engine (also {{sometimes called}} a disc engine) is an {{internal combustion engine}} comprising fundamentally of one moving part and a direct drive onto the crankshaft. Initially patented in 1993, it differs from earlier internal combustion engines {{in a number of}} ways and utilizes a circular rocking or wobbling nutating motion, drawing heavily from similar steam-powered engines developed in the 19th century, and similar to the motion of the non-rotating portion of a <b>swash</b> <b>plate</b> on a <b>swash</b> <b>plate</b> engine.|$|E
50|$|Pressure. In {{a typical}} pressure-compensated pump, the <b>swash</b> <b>plate</b> angle is {{adjusted}} through {{the action of}} a valve which uses pressure feedback so that the instantaneous pump output flow is exactly enough to maintain a designated pressure. If the load flow increases, pressure will momentarily decrease but the pressure-compensation valve will sense the decrease and then increase the <b>swash</b> <b>plate</b> angle to increase pump output flow so that the desired pressure is restored. In reality most systems use pressure as a control {{for this type of}} pump. The operating pressure reaches, say, 200 bar (20 MPa or 2900 psi) and the <b>swash</b> <b>plate</b> is driven towards zero angle (piston stroke nearly zero) and with the inherent leaks in the system allows the pump to stabilise at the delivery volume that maintains the set pressure. As demand increases the <b>swash</b> <b>plate</b> is moved to a greater angle, piston stroke increases and the volume of fluid increases; if the demand slackens the pressure will rise, and the pumped volume diminishes as the pressure rises. At maximum system pressure the output is once again almost zero. If the fluid demand increases beyond the capacity of the pump to deliver, the system pressure will drop to near zero. The <b>swash</b> <b>plate</b> angle will remain at the maximum allowed, and the pistons will operate at full stroke. This continues until system flow-demand eases and the pump's capacity is greater than demand. As the pressure rises the swash-plate angle modulates to try to not exceed the maximum pressure while meeting the flow demand.|$|E
50|$|The <b>swash</b> <b>plate</b> is two {{concentric}} disks or plates. One plate rotates {{with the}} mast, connected by idle links, {{while the other}} does not rotate. The rotating plate is also connected to the individual blades through pitch links and pitch horns. The non-rotating plate is connected to links that are manipulated by pilot controlsâ€”specifically, the collective and cyclic controls. The <b>swash</b> <b>plate</b> can shift vertically and tilt. Through shifting and tilting, the non-rotating plate controls the rotating plate, which in turn controls the individual blade pitch.|$|E

50|$|A {{hydrostatic}} drive {{consists of a}} hydraulic pump and a hydraulic motor. Since positive displacement pumps and motors are used, one revolution of the pump or motor corresponds to a set volume of fluid flow that {{is determined by the}} displacement regardless of speed or torque. Speed is regulated by regulating the fluid flow with a valve or by changing the displacement of the pump or motor. Many different design variations have been used. A <b>swash</b> <b>plate</b> drive employs an axial piston pump and/or motor in which the <b>swash</b> <b>plate</b> angle can be changed to adjust the displacement and thus adjust the speed.|$|E

The models 875 and 1075 included an Eaton-manufactured variable-displacement swash-plate pump and fixed-displacement gear-type hydraulic motor combined into a single compact package, which attached directly to the patented Wheel Horse Unidriveâ„¢ transaxle. Reverse was produced by reversing {{the flow of the}} pump through over-centering of the <b>swash</b> <b>plate.</b> Acceleration was limited and smoothed through use of pressure accumulator and relief valves located between the pump and motor, to prevent the sudden changes in speed possible with a direct hydraulic coupling.

50|$|The {{reciprocating}} action may be produced several ways. A crank or Scotch yoke type drive may be used, a <b>swash</b> <b>plate</b> type drive, a captive cam or eccentric, barrel cam, or other rotary to linear drive. Modern tools are built with variants {{of all of}} these mechanisms. Eccentric cam, crank and scotch yoke drives need balance weights to reduce vibration in the plane of the rotating element, and may still exhibit vibration that is objectionable to a user of a handheld saw and can lead to difficulty in controlling a cut. The <b>swash</b> <b>plate</b> drive has the advantage that there is little rotational out of balance, so the principal vibration is in line with the blade. This is generally controllable by keeping the foot of a handheld tool against the work.|$|E

This drive retained the 4 speed manual transmission as before, but this time used a system of hydraulic pumps and motors to drive the input shaft of the transmission. This system is called a Hydrostatic drive system. The engine turns the hydraulic pump capable of pressures up to [...] This pressure is then directed to the hydraulic motor that {{is connected to the}} input shaft of the transmission. The operator is provided with a lever in the cab that allows for the control of the hydraulic motor's ability to use the energy provided by the pump. By adjusting the <b>swash</b> <b>plate</b> in the motor, the stroke of its pistons are changed. If the <b>swash</b> <b>plate</b> is set to neutral, the pistons do not move in their bores and no rotation is allowed, thus the machine does not move. By moving the lever, the <b>swash</b> <b>plate</b> moves its attached pistons forward, thus allowing them to move within the bore and causing the motor to turn. This provides an infinitely variable speed control from 0 ground speed to what ever the maximum speed is allowed by the gear selection of the transmission. The standard clutch was removed from this drive system as it was no longer needed.|$|E

50|$|Radial {{piston pumps}} are used {{especially}} for high pressure and relatively small flows. Pressures {{of up to}} 650 bar are normal. In fact variable displacement is possible.
