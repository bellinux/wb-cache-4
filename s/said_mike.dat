2500|$|Aggie, {{who never}} remarried, died in 1937 in New Brunswick, New Jersey. After Mike's death, {{she made her}} living by sewing, {{stopping}} when her eyesight failed. [...] Seventeen months before her death, and her health declining, she was interviewed by the New Brunswick Sunday Times. [...] She <b>said</b> <b>Mike</b> to her was [...] "just an overgrown kid" [...] and, in a reporter's paraphrase, [...] "always eager to help a young fellow on the field , never pugnacious despite his marvelous build of 190 pounds and six feet in height , and charitable to the extreme." ...|$|E
2500|$|Moore {{has also}} {{been quoted as saying}} that he didn't think the Hockey Night in Canada show would lose viewers if he lost the theme song. [...] "Hockey's a game, not a song," [...] he <b>said.</b> <b>Mike</b> Myers disagrees with this ambivalence towards the song calling it, [...] "...the second anthem [...] " [...] Canadian jazz fusion band The Shuffle Demons even jokingly {{introduced}} the song as [...] "... national anthem" [...] during performances. In an informal poll on CBC's website which puts forth the question, [...] "Can Canada go on as we know it without the Hockey Night in Canada theme?", [...] (3361) 84% respond no.|$|E

60|$|<b>Mike</b> <b>said</b> nothing; {{there was}} a sinking feeling in his interior.|$|R
6000|$|... "This," [...] he <b>said,</b> when <b>Mike</b> had finished, [...] "confirms my {{frequently}} stated {{opinion that}} Comrade Jellicoe {{is one of}} Nature's blitherers. So that's why he touched us for our hard-earned, was it?" ...|$|R
2500|$|The United Keetoowah Band did {{not sign}} or approve the resolution. [...] The Cherokee Nation {{acknowledges}} {{the existence of}} people of Cherokee descent [...] "...in states such as Arkansas, Kansas, Missouri, and Texas," [...] who are Cherokee by ancestry but who are not considered members of the Cherokee Nation. [...] "There are more than 200 groups that we’ve been able to recognize that call themselves a Cherokee nation, tribe, or band," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Mike</b> Miller, spokesman for the Cherokee Nation. [...] "Only three are federally recognized, but the other groups run the gamut of intent. Some are basically heritage groups – people who have family with Cherokee heritage {{who are interested in}} the language and culture, and we certainly encourage that," [...] said Miller. [...] "But the problem is when you have groups that call themselves ‘nation,’ or ‘band,’ or ‘tribe,’ because that implies governance." ...|$|E
2500|$|Responding to {{criticism}} of Keck's {{involvement in the}} campaign, Brownback spokesman Paul Milburn commented that it was legal to use taxpayer-paid staff to campaign, responding directly [...] to the controversy, saying, [...] "Paul Davis must have {{spent too much time}} in VIP rooms at strip clubs back in law school...", because he [...] "... should know full well that the law allows personal staff of the governor’s office to work on campaign issues." [...] In Kansas, however, getting records about crimes that law enforcement has investigated is typically difficult. The Legislature closed those records to the public over three decades earlier: If members of the public desire incident reports and investigative files, they normally have to sue to obtain them, cases sometimes costing $25,000 or more. Media law experts were amazed after learning Montgomery County's sheriff released non-public investigative files from 1998 with just a records request. “That is unusual,” <b>said</b> <b>Mike</b> Merriam, media lawyer for the Kansas Press Association. “They have denied releasing records routinely {{over and over and over}} again.” Brownback's campaign capitalized on the 16-year-old incident.|$|E
2500|$|Due to the {{conflicting}} personalities of his protagonist couple, Sparks faced difficulty {{in finding a}} vehicle that would draw Will and Ronnie to spend time together. “It had to be during the summer, she [...] had to be new in town, and whatever happened had to start in June and end in August. Because you always want a conclusion,” said Sparks of his requirements. He mentioned summer camp or a summer job as typical vehicles used in books, but dismissed them as unoriginal and boring. “So it’s got to be original, it’s got to be interesting, {{and at the same}} time it’s got to be universal, that you feel like it could happen to anybody.” Sparks eventually chose to have Will and Ronnie bond over a loggerhead sea turtle nest, knowing that Loggerhead eggs often hatch in August. The scene of the hatching nest took place during the first week of August and involved 26 live loggerhead sea turtle hatchlings. Sea turtle hatchlings have an innate sense to head toward the ocean water as soon as they are born, so scenes of the nest hatching had to be taken swiftly. <b>Said</b> <b>Mike</b> Dodd of the Georgia Department of Natural Resources, the biologist who supervised the scene, the hatchlings [...] "did all they know how to do: They crawled down to the water and swam off." [...] Sparks told an interviewer he suspected filmmakers would digitally add more turtles to the scene. At the time of filming, the loggerhead sea turtle was listed as a threatened species. The environmentally friendly theme was an added bonus to Tybee Island, which was then promoting ecotourism.|$|E
60|$|<b>Mike</b> <b>said</b> he saw. Psmith {{thanked him}} with a certain stately old-world courtesy.|$|R
60|$|<b>Mike</b> <b>said</b> {{he thought}} that would be all right. The {{pantomime}} dame exhibited no pleasure.|$|R
6000|$|... 'This,' he <b>said</b> to <b>Mike,</b> 'is {{undoubtedly}} {{something in}} the nature of a set-back. I have drawn blank. The papers bring out posters, [...] "Psmith Baffled." [...] I must try again. Meanwhile, to work. Work, the hobby of the philosopher and the poor man's friend.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh, that's all right,' <b>said</b> <b>Mike</b> thickly. There {{seemed to}} be {{something}} sticking in his throat, preventing him from speaking.|$|E

6000|$|... "There," [...] <b>Mike</b> <b>said,</b> when {{he stopped}} under Desmond's window; [...] "does that look like a dream?" [...] and {{he pointed to a}} patch of blood on the pavement.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes, {{what about}} him?' <b>said</b> <b>Mike.</b> 'You'll {{have a pretty}} tough job turning him into a {{friendly}} native, I should think. How {{do you mean to}} start?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "All right," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Mike,</b> without enthusiasm. The Wyatt {{disaster}} was too recent {{for him to}} {{feel much}} pleasure at playing against Ripton vice his friend, withdrawn.|$|E
6000|$|... "Good idea," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Mike.</b> [...] "We will. A chap at Wrykyn, called Wyatt, used {{to break}} out at night and shoot at cats with an air-pistol." ...|$|E

I'm not a natural comedienne.|$|R
