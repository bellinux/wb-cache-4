40|$|Oral {{and written}} media have their pros and cons. By {{combining}} the two, however, {{you can often}} {{get the best of}} both worlds. For example, in a meeting you could hand out a chart or diagram that helps to bring home a point that you are making. In advance of a telephone call, you could e-mail some text that you need to discuss. In a workshop, you could use a flip chart to write down key points from a presentation, and then tape the sheets to the wall. <b>Slide</b> <b>deck</b> presentations have gained great popularity in recent years. That in itself has pros and cons. If used properly, a <b>slide</b> <b>deck</b> can be an excellent complement to a presentation.

40|$|PowerPoint {{continues}} to permeate the presentation genre {{in general and}} business communication in particular. Whereas PowerPoint’s role in organizational practices has caught increasing research interest, research on PowerPoint in digital innovation is still scarce.

Drawing on primary data consisting of 62 interviews, 41 <b>slide</b> <b>decks,</b> and longitudinal series of observations and workshops, the paper illustrates how deeply entangled PowerPoint is in digital innovation. Our in-depth analysis of PowerPoint use at different innovation process stages suggests that the tool cannot be simply regarded as beneficial or detrimental for innovation.

40|$|Good {{alignment}} and {{repetition of}} objects across presentation slides can facilitate visual processing {{and contribute to}} audience understanding. However, creating and maintaining such consistency during slide design is difficult. In order to solve this problem, we present two complementary tools: (1) StyleSnap, which increases the alignment and repetition of objects by adaptively clustering object edge positions and allowing parallel editing of all objects snapped to the same spatial extent; and (2) FlashFormat, which infers the least-general generalization of editing examples and applies it throughout the selected range. In user studies of repetitive styling task performance, StyleSnap and FlashFormat were 4 - 5 times and 2 - 3 times faster than conventional editing, respectively. Both use a mixed-initiative approach to improve the consistency of <b>slide</b> <b>decks</b> and generalize to any situations involving editing across disjoint visual spaces.
