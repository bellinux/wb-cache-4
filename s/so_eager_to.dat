According to Ignatius, it would be obvious that the CIA would have been <b>so</b> <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> acquire knowledge about the location of Osama bin Laden that it would take every available opportunity to get information. Shoshana Bryen, a U.S. security expert, said that the bombing would make Israel and the U.S. wary in their future dealings with Jordan.|$|E

In November 2010, FilmDistrict acquired North American distribution rights. The owners were <b>so</b> <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> {{get their hands on}} Drive, they started negotiating to buy it before seeing any footage, believing it could appeal to people who enjoy a genre movie, as well as the arthouse crowd. The film had a release date of September 16, 2011, in the United States.|$|E
5|$|At 09:00 Linois {{was still}} only observing the convoy, {{reluctant}} to attack {{until he could}} be sure {{of the nature of}} his opponents. Dance responded to the reprieve by reforming the line of battle into sailing formation to increase his convoy's speed with the intention of reaching the Straits ahead of Linois. With the convoy a less intimidating target, Linois began to slowly approach the British ships. By 13:00 it was clear that Linois's faster ships were in danger of isolating the rear of the convoy, and Dance ordered his lead ships to tack and come about, so that they would cross in front of the French squadron. The British successfully executed the manoeuvre, and at 13:15 Linois opened fire on the lead ship—Royal George—under the command of John Fam Timmins. The Royal George and the next four ships in line, the Indiaman Ganges, Dance's Earl Camden, the Warley and the Alfred, all returned fire, Ganges initially attacking Royal George in error. Captain James Prendergrass in Hope, the next in line, was <b>so</b> <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> join the battle that he misjudged his speed and collided with Warley, the ships falling back as their crews worked to separate their rigging. Shots were then exchanged at long range for 43 minutes, neither side inflicting severe damage.|$|E

Charlie talks and interacts with all the ghosts, relives {{important}} moments from his youth, and comes to grips with his complicated feelings for his adoptive parents. Through Charlie's conversations and interactions with the ghosts in his home, we see both why he loved his parents and why he was <b>so</b> <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> leave them far behind.|$|E

Guðrún responded that her mother should not be <b>so</b> <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> giver her away to the Huns, and she prophesied that Atli would kill Gunnarr and tear out the heart of Högni.

500|$|The Final Cut is an anti-war concept album, whose lyrics {{explore what}} Waters regards as the {{betrayal}} of fallen British servicemen—such as his father—who during the Second World War sacrificed {{their lives in}} the spirit of a post-war dream. [...] This post-war dream was that their victory would usher in a more peaceful world, whose leaders would no longer be <b>so</b> <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> resolve disputes by resorting to war. [...] The album's lyrics are critical of Thatcher, whose policies and decisions Waters regarded as an example of this betrayal. [...] She is referred to as [...] "Maggie" [...] throughout the album.|$|E

Even the lack of an Argentine merchant fleet allowed Britain to manage the maritime trade. Forbes's testimony should be appraised in perspective of the contemporary Anglo-American commercial rivalry, In light of the partial nature of the account and of his [...] "jealousy, even antipathy" [...] towards the English in Rio de la Plata.|$|E

However, the parties who provided the scalpers with the tickets were never identified, and the show ran without interference. The production had a $50,600 weekly gross, and ran for 1,925 performances. The national tour began in 1950 and grossed $3,000,000 in the first year, making $1,500,000 in profit.

[...] Mihdhar, who had spent time in al-Qaeda camps in the 1990s, was known and highly regarded by Bin Laden. [...] Mihdhar was <b>so</b> <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> participate in jihad operations in the United States that he had already obtained a one-year B-1/B-2 (tourist/business) multiple-entry visa from the consulate in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia on April 7, 1999, one day after obtaining a new passport.

500|$|Alt Sounds writer Candice Haridimou {{gave the}} album {{a rating of}} 94% out of 100% and praised the album's lyrical content. She said the {{political}} nature of the album also uses emotional dramatisation to capture the listener, particularly in songs like [...] "Devil's Island". Haridimou states the song [...] "drives remorse into the cold hearts of those involved. It’s a severe and poignant song that will {{stand the test of}} time." [...] Ryan Bird, in an otherwise positive review of Daybreaker, criticised it upon first hearing it; he said it struggled to settle into any distinctive rhythm or groove. However, Bird concluded his review by saying, [...] "but despite its relative (and relatively few) faults. 'Daybreaker' represents a victory for a band who some had once been <b>so</b> <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> write off, suggesting that maybejust maybethey've got what it takes to bring both sides [...] together".|$|E

Lopez first heard Disney Animation's pitch while in Los Angeles working on The Book of Mormon, but Disney was <b>so</b> <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> get both of them on board that the production team traveled to New York City to also pitch the film in person to Anderson-Lopez (who was busy raising the couple's two young daughters). Lopez believes Disney was particularly interested in his wife's strong story talent.

500|$|An {{aviation}} company owner and {{patron of the}} Maharishi's, Kershi Cambata (K. S.

[...] McCartney asked Lennon why he was <b>so</b> <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> {{be the one to}} go with the Maharishi on his helicopter ride, to which Lennon replied, [...] "I thought he'd slip me the answer." [...] On another occasion, an Italian newsreel company filmed the Maharishi and many students, including the Beatles and other musicians, going down to the river while the musicians sang standards such as [...] "When the Saints Go Marching In" [...] and [...] "You Are My Sunshine". One evening, when the moon was full, the Maharishi arranged for everyone to cruise on the Ganges in two barges. The trip started with the chanting of Vedas by two pandits, but soon the musicians brought out their instruments. The Beatles sang Donovan's songs, while Love and Donovan sang Beatles songs, and Horn played flute.|$|E

This was the shuffle that sometimes took him across the pitch against a fast bowler; but, that aside, his footwork was perfection.

500|$|The {{day after}} the Pepsi {{commercial}} premiered, Madonna released the actual music video for [...] "Like a Prayer" [...] on MTV. Religious groups worldwide including the Vatican immediately protested the clip, saying that it contained blasphemous use of Christian imagery. They called for the national boycott of Pepsi and PepsiCo's subsidiaries, including fast food chains Kentucky Fried Chicken, Taco Bell and Pizza Hut. Pepsi initially wanted to continue airing the commercial, although were {{taken aback by the}} protests. They explained the differences between their advertisement and Madonna's artistic opinions in the video. Ultimately Pepsi gave up to the protests and cancelled the campaign. According to Taraborrelli, the company was <b>so</b> <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> extricate themselves from the collaboration that they even allowed Madonna to keep the $5million advance. In the meantime, Pope John Paul II involved himself in the matter and encouraged fans to boycott the singer in Italy. Protests from a small Catholic organization in the country prompted Italian state television network RAI and Madonna's record company WEA to not air the video there. The video was also deemed offensive by the American Family Association (AFA). Madonna stated that [...] "art should be controversial, and that's all there is to it", about the controversy.|$|E
500|$|In Series 3, Cold Feet shot outside England for {{the first}} time for Episode 5. A storyline {{featuring}} Adam's stag weekend was originally scripted to take place first in Blackpool and then in Dublin. James Nesbitt suggested that it should be filmed in Belfast and Portrush, near where he grew up. He, Andy Harries and producer Spencer Campbell scouted the locations in April 2000 before filming went ahead later that year. Local businesspeople were <b>so</b> <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> promote the area that they waived any fees Granada would have given them for allowing filming, meaning the location manager only spent £20, considerably less than the £3,000 a typical shoot of that length would have cost. This location shoot inspired the producers to film even further away from Manchester; in November 2000, Bullen and Harries spoke at the Screen Producers Association of Australia conference, where they decided to base the fourth series finale in Sydney. The episode was written to be a [...] "normal episode" [...] of Cold Feet that just had a different background. The main cast—except for Helen Baxendale who was pregnant—the producers and Ciaran Donnelly shot for 18 days in October 2001 in locations that included Hyde Park, Kirribilli, Double Bay and the northern beaches. Budget problems meant an overseas location could not be secured for Series 5, so scenes in the final episode were shot in Portmeirion, Wales.|$|E
500|$|The British {{entry into}} the {{maritime}} fur trade dates to 1778 and the third voyage of Captain James Cook. While sailing north {{to search for the}} fabled Northwest Passage, Cook discovered the Hawaiian Islands. On the Northwest Coast, he spent a month in Nootka Sound, during which he and his crew traded with the Nuu-chah-nulth from the village of Yuquot. They ended up with over 300 furs, mostly sea otter, but thought them of no great value. Later, after Cook had been killed in Hawaii, the expedition visited Canton and were surprised by how much money the Chinese were willing to pay for the furs. A profit of 1,800% was made. James King, one of the commanders after Cook's death, wrote, [...] "the advantages that might be derived from a voyage to that part of the American coast, undertaken with commercial views, appear to me of a degree of importance sufficient to call for the attention of the public." [...] The crews of the two ships were <b>so</b> <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> return to Nootka Sound and acquire more furs, they were [...] "not far short of mutiny". Nevertheless, they sailed for England, arriving there in October 1780. Accounts of Cook's voyage and the sea otter trade were published in the 1780s, triggering a rush of entrepreneurial voyages to the Northwest Coast.|$|E
