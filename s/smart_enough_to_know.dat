2500|$|A devoted fan {{of heavy}} metal, Cox {{considers}} himself {{more of a}} comedian than a disc jockey. [...] The show itself rapidly covers a range of topics in a comedic format, from major current events to obscure pop culture; regular segments like [...] "Sperm News", [...] "Why Florida Sucks", and [...] "Are You Smarter Than a Dumbass?" [...] typify the show's irreverent style. [...] Cox also frequently takes calls from listeners, and often interviews guests in studio and over the phone. [...] During a June 19, 2012 interview with Aerosmith frontman Steven Tyler, the show broke news of the delayed release for Music from Another Dimension!, the band's first studio album in eight years. [...] On February 9, 2010, the show aired [...] "Parma State of Mind", both a parody of the Jay-Z/Alicia Keys hit [...] "Empire State of Mind" [...] {{and a way of}} continuing the Northeast Ohio tradition of poking fun at the Cleveland suburb. [...] Dean DePiero, then mayor of Parma, criticized the song and its accompanying YouTube video: [...] "It's pretty sick. ... The people who put it together aren't even <b>smart</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> where our city boundaries are." [...] The show also drew national attention after holding a book burning party for Fifty Shades of Grey on July 8, 2012.|$|E

The following week, both of Eagles' centers, Bap Manzini and Vic Lindskog, were injured, so Greasy came back and told Mandarino that he [...] "should be <b>smart</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> learn three sets of plays".|$|R

5000|$|He {{is known}} for his metaphorical figurative paintings, often with a muted color palette. The arts writer John Seed, writing in the Huffington Post in 2013 {{described}} Sumner's work this way: Sumner's"paintings that form a kind of personal Commedia dell'Arte, whose main actor has a tragic, muted air. Sumner is wise <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> how <b>to</b> engage you in his theater and also <b>smart</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> stand back and let you react on your own terms. The paintings are generous, funny and just a bit opaque... Echoes of Bay Area painting, flavors gleaned from Morandi, Guston and Magritte and a hint of Buster Keaton come together in his recent works through the filter of a sly, discerning intelligence." ...|$|R

60|$|All {{the next}} night, as Reddy Fox hunted and hunted for {{something}} to eat, he kept thinking of that dream of fat hens, and he kept wondering how he could get Blacky the Crow to tell him just where that farm with fat hens was. Blacky on his part had spent a whole day wondering how he could induce Reddy Fox to make that long journey over to where Bowser the Hound was a prisoner of kindness. Blacky was <b>smart</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> that if he seemed too anxious for Reddy to make that long journey, Reddy would at once suspect something. He knew well enough that if Reddy had any idea that Bowser the Hound was over there, nothing would tempt {{him to make the}} trip.|$|E
60|$|Reddy {{could not}} {{remember}} {{when he had been}} more hungry than he was now. Lying there behind the fallen tree, watching the fat hens walking about unsuspectingly just a little way from him, {{it seemed to him that}} he simply must rush out and catch one of them. But Reddy was <b>smart</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> that if he did this there would at once be such a screaming and squawking that some one would be sure to rush out from the farmhouse to find out what was going on. If he were discovered, there would be small chance for him to get another fat hen. Reddy is keen enough to make the most of an opportunity. He knew that if he could get one of these hens without frightening the others, he would have a chance to get another. He might have a chance to get several in this way.|$|E

5000|$|It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia has {{received}} critical acclaim. Emily Nussbaum of The New Yorker praised the show, calling it [...] "not merely the best sitcom on television {{but one of}} the most arresting and ambitious current TV series, period". Gillian Flynn of Entertainment Weekly reviewed the first season negatively, commenting [...] "it is smug enough to think it's breaking ground, but not <b>smart</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> it isn't". Brian Lowry of Variety gave the first season a positive review, saying it was [...] "invariably clever and occasionally a laugh-out-loud riot, all while lampooning taboo topics". [...] Later seasons of the show have received favorable ratings on review aggregator Metacritic, receiving 70/100, 78/100 and 85/100 for seasons 4, 5 and 6 respectively. The show has become a cult hit with viewers and is often compared in style to Seinfeld—particularly due to the self-centered nature of its main characters. The Philadelphia Inquirer reviewer Jonathan Storm wrote [...] "It's like Seinfeld on crack," [...] a quote that became widely used to describe the series, to the point that FX attached the tagline, [...] "It's Seinfeld on crack." ...|$|E
