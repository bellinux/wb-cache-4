5|$|The first British pirate {{radio station}} was Radio Caroline, which was {{launched}} by Irish music entrepreneur Ronan O'Rahilly, and started broadcasting from a ship off the Essex coast in 1964. By 1967 ten pirate radio stations were broadcasting {{to an estimated}} daily audience of 10 to 15 million. Influential pirate radio DJs included John Peel, Tony Blackburn, Kenny Everett, Johnnie Walker, Tony Prince, Emperor Rosko and <b>Spangles</b> Muldoon.|$|E

25|$|In addition, paillettes or <b>spangles</b> (sequins of real metal), {{small pieces}} of appliqued rich fabric or kid leather, pearls, and real or {{imitation}} gems are commonly used as accents, and felt or string padding {{may be used to}} create raised areas or texture. Silk thread work in satin stitch or other stitches is often combined with goldwork, and in some periods goldwork was combined with blackwork embroidery as well.|$|E
40|$|This work {{investigated}} <b>spangle</b> on Zn- 0. 05 Al- 0. 2 Sb {{galvanized coating}} with shiny, feathery and dull morphology. The main {{goal was to}} determine the influence of surface characteristics on the anti-corrosion performance of the produced <b>spangle.</b> Experimental results showed that <b>spangle</b> displays an increasing electrochemically active trend from shiny, feathery to dull <b>spangle,</b> which is attributed to the combined factors of surface micro-roughness, surface texture, and surface segregation of <b>spangle.</b> In addition, the Sb 3 Zn 4 particles precipitated on the coating surface {{play an important role in}} the corrosion resistance of <b>spangle.</b> Difference in morphology of <b>spangle</b> leads to difference of surface micro-roughness, surface texture, surface segregation, and finally leads to difference of corrosion resistance of <b>spangle,</b> which is discussed by a proposed <b>spangle</b> growth model...|$|R

25|$|On 29 May 1972, Mi Amigo {{was sold}} at auction for ƒ20,000 to the Hofman Shipping Company, who had bought her {{on behalf of}} Rob Vermaat and Gerard van Dam. Although {{it was assumed that}} Mi Amigo would be scrapped, the Dutch Free Radio Organisation {{announced}} that she was to become a Free Radio Museum. The studios and cabins were restored and Mi Amigo departed Amsterdam on 2 September apparently bound for England. The next day, she anchored off Scheveningen. During October and November, test transmissions were made which consisted only of playing music and no station identification was given. On 9 November, <b>Spangles</b> Muldoon spoke live on air.|$|E
25|$|In 1972, MV Mi Amigo {{was bought}} for scrap at auction by enthusiast Gerard van Dam, who {{intended}} {{to use it as}} a free radio museum. O'Rahilly promised financial backing if van Dam could return the ship to broadcasting condition. The ship anchored off the Dutch coastal resort of Scheveningen and was serviced and operated from the Netherlands. That autumn various tests, consisting of continuous music, were made on 259 mtr. The station restarted just before Christmas as Radio 199 but soon became Radio Caroline with a Top 40 format. DJs Chris Cary, broadcasting as <b>Spangles</b> Muldoon (who was also station manager), Roger 'Twiggy' Day, Andy Archer, Paul Alexander, Steve England, Johnny Jason and Peter Chicago (real name Peter Murtha) manned the station.|$|E
25|$|Staging and {{presentation}} {{were of a}} high standard, {{under the direction of}} Louis P. Verande (assisted by George King), from Covent Garden where he had been responsible for the staging of Thomas Beecham's controversial 1910 Salome. Verande also had extensive Continental and American experience. All the costumes were designed by Dorothy Carleton Smyth from Glasgow, an authority on historical pageant and theatrical costumes, who travelled with the company. Quinlan pointed out that she concentrated on a harmoniously blended colour scheme, eschewing extraneous <b>spangles</b> and similar gewgaws. The sets for all the operas were designed by Oliver Percy Bernard, from the Boston Opera, and set models for the Puccini operas were first passed by the composer; while Humperdinck, Debussy, Cosima Wagner, Ricordi and other authorities lent their assistance with others. Quinlan claimed the largest scenic studio in England and said that a great deal of research had been done on the historical accuracy of stage accessories. The cost of moving the company and all the baggage — 365 tons of scenery, props and costumes — around the world was £100,000.|$|E

500|$|These {{stories were}} {{executed}} in canvaswork or in coloured silks in a uniquely English style called raised work, usually {{known by its}} modern name stumpwork. Raised work arose from the detached buttonhole stitch fillings and braided scrolls of late Elizabethan embroidery. [...] Areas of the embroidery were worked on white or ivory silk grounds {{in a variety of}} stitches and prominent features were padded with horsehair or lambswool, or worked around wooden shapes or wire frames. [...] Ribbons, <b>spangles,</b> beads, small pieces of lace, canvaswork slips, and other objects were added to increase the dimensionality of the finished work.|$|E
500|$|In {{a review}} of her 2002 Radio City Music Hall concert, Stephen Holden of The New York Times {{described}} Peters as [...] "the peaches-and-cream embodiment of an ageless storybook princess... inside a giant soap bubble floating toward heaven. A belief {{in the power of}} the dreams behind Rodgers and Hammerstein's songs, if not in their reality, was possible." [...] Peters made her solo concert debut at Lincoln Center in New York City in 2006. Holden, reviewing this concert, noted, [...] "Even while swiveling across the stage of Avery Fisher Hall like a voluptuous Botticelli Venus in Bob Mackie <b>spangles...</b> she radiated a preternatural innocence.... For the eternal child in all of us, she evokes a surrogate childhood playmate". Peters was the headliner at the 2009 Adelaide Cabaret Festival in Adelaide, Australia. The Sunday Mail wrote that Peters showed [...] "the verve, vigour and voice of someone half her age." ...|$|E

40|$|Hot-dip {{galvanized}} steel sheets with different <b>spangle</b> sizes were deformed {{by means of}} rolling and tension. The change of preferential crystallographic orientation and of superficial characteristics due to the deformation was analyzed by means of both X-rays diffraction and optical and scanning electronic microscopy. A correlation between such changes and the involving deformation modes {{was intended to be}} done and the <b>spangle</b> size influence on these modes was studied. Coating reactivity change due to the deformation was investigated by means of quasi-steady DC electrochemical tests. The results allow to infer that, in great <b>spangle</b> samples, the main deformation mechanism is twinning whereas in small <b>spangle</b> ones, pyramidal slip systems happen as well. The increase of the reactivity with the deformation is greater in tension than in rolling and it is more important in small than in great <b>spangle</b> samples. Facultad de Ingenierí...|$|R
