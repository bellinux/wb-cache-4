40|$|Abandoned {{plantations}} of coffee, tea {{and other}} commercial crops offer opportunities for understanding ecological processes in modified forest ecosystems. Unlike <b>tree</b> <b>plantations</b> tea is maintained as a shrub with a continuous dense short canopy that precludes large-frugivore activity thereby limiting dispersal of forest species to such areas. In {{this study we}} determine how location and density of Grevillea robusta a <b>shade</b> <b>tree</b> in tea <b>plantations</b> and proximity of plantations to forests influences seed arrival from forests into the plantations. We also estimate the importance of dispersal modes in the colonization processes. We laid 10 × 10 -m plots at three distance intervals from the forest edge in three different plantation types with varying <b>shade</b> <b>tree</b> densities. Within the plots we laid four 1 × 1 -m subplots {{at the corners of}} the plot. We estimated species richness, abundance and categorized the seeds into dispersal modes in these plots. Grevillea robusta increased species richness of seeds by three times and abundance of seeds by 3 – 30 times compared with plantations without them. Higher density of G. robusta increased seed input changed species composition and altered species dominance in the plantations. Distance to forests influenced seed arrival in plantations without G. robusta trees and plots 95 m from the forest did not have any seeds in them. No such effect was seen in plantations with G. robusta trees. Seeds dispersed by birds or a combination of birds and mammals contribute 30 % of the seeds reaching the plantations with G. robusta and this was not influenced by distance from the forest. In plantations without G. robusta bird dispersal is restricted to 25 m from the forest edge.

In this case study, we measured throughfall and soil hydrological properties in four land use systems in Cauca, Colombia, that differed in stand structural parameters: shaded coffee, unshaded coffee, secondary forest and pasture. We found that throughfall was rather influenced by stand structural characteristics than by rainfall intensity. Lower throughfall was recorded in the shaded coffee compared to the other systems when rain gauges were placed at a distance of 1. 0 m to the <b>shade</b> <b>tree.</b> The variability of throughfall was high in the shaded coffee, which was due to different canopy characteristics and irregular arrangements of <b>shade</b> <b>tree</b> species. <b>Shaded</b> coffee and secondary forest resembled each other in soil structural parameters, with an increase in saturated hydraulic conductivity and microporosity, whereas bulk density and macroporosity decreased, compared to the unshaded coffee and pasture.

40|$|Agricultural {{intensification}} is implicated {{as a major}} {{driver of}} global biodiversity loss. Local management and landscape scale factors both influence biodiversity in agricultural systems, but there are relatively few studies to date looking at how local and landscape scales influence biodiversity in tropical agroecosystems. Understanding what drives the diversity of groups of organisms such as spiders is important from a pragmatic point of view because of the important biocontrol services they offer to agriculture. Spiders in coffee are somewhat enigmatic because of their positive or lack of response to agricultural intensification. In this study, we provide the first analysis, to our knowledge, of the arboreal spiders in the <b>shade</b> <b>trees</b> of coffee <b>plantations.</b> In the Soconusco region of Chiapas, Mexico we sampled across 38 sites on 9 coffee <b>plantations.</b> <b>Tree</b> and canopy connectedness were found to positively influence overall arboreal spider richness and abundance.

These agroforestry systems vary from a simple system following selective cutting of forest trees, to a more sophisticated planting design. The cacao was planted under remaining forest covers (CF 1), under planted trees (CF 2), and between <b>shade</b> <b>trees</b> Gliricidia sepium (CP). The objectives of this study were to quantify nitrogen use efficiency (N NUE) and nitrogen resorption in cacao agroforestry systems. The N NUE at the ecosystem scale (N NUEES) for the cacao agroforestry systems were compared with the natural forest. The results showed that CP produced the highest litterfall and cacao foliar nitrogen. CP and CF 1 produced litterfall and the nitrogen resorption that not were significantly different. In contrast, CF 2 produced the lowest litterfall, hence required lower nitrogen supply. The nitrogen resorption of CF 2 was less than that of CF 1 and CP. However, N NUE in cacao plant (N NUEC) of CF 2 was higher than that of the CP. The N NUEES of either CF 1 or CF 2 were {{similar to that of the}} natural forest, but higher than that of the CP.

The rice cropping system has a large food, social and economical importance in the world; however, it is a net GHG-emitting productive system. The objective {{of this study was}} estimating the carbon footprint of the rice production in Campoalegre, Huila, Colombia. A total of 21 rice productive units, located at less than 15 kmfrom the center of the municipality and with gravity irrigation, was selected. Through semi-structured interviews, all activities that emit GHGs, from land preparation to harvest grain, were investigated. It was consulted to producers and managers about the use of nitrogen fertilizers and fossil fuels and the yield of rice grain in each production unit. Factor of emission and warming-equivalence among GHG recommended by Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change were employed. Carbon fixation rates estimated in Tolima were used to found alternative systems for mitigation of these emissions. It was found a total emission of 998. 1 ± 365. 3 kg CO 2 e/ha/cycle (163. 3 ± 55. 8 kg CO 2 e/t), having nitrogen fertilization being the greatest contribution (65 %).

Research to investigate the physiological race of R. similis Cobb. had been conducted in the screen house at Indonesian Coffee and Cocoa Research Institute, Jember. The experiment was arranged in randomized complete design with three replications, while cross inoculation tests were used as race identification method, by using three isolates from banana, citrus and Arabica coffee as the control. Tested host plants were banana Cavendish, ‘Ambon Kuning’ and ‘Raja’ varieties, rootstock of citrus Siam from Kintamani and Arabica coffee Kartika 1 variety. The expression of virulence of three nematode isolates against banana, citrus or arabica coffee tested to be considered as favorable host, while the most virulent isolate attacked coffee could be decided as physiological race of coffee. Results showed that banana isolate penetrated and attacked the roos of arabica coffee. The isolate of R. similis from citrus could not attack both coffee and banana varieties. Therefore, the physiological race of coffee was considered similar with the banana race.

40|$|Amate is an {{indigenous}} hand made paper manufactured in Mexico since pre-Hispanic times and distributed as handicraft {{since the end}} of the 1960 s. Otomi artisans living in the mountainous region of the Sierra Norte of the State of Puebla manufacture it while numerous traders commercialize it at national and international level. Right from early days of commercialization, there has been a persistent market demand that have implied distinct changes, like constant diversification of paper product types and of trading options, involvement of new and more social actors occupied in bark harvest, paper manufacture, paper decoration, or paper trading, and the constant adaptation to new forms of work organization. As the market demand rises there are increasing pressures on tree resources to augment the bark supply. Three main processes have occurred in the Sierra Norte de Puebla region, in order to satisfy the demand for bark raw material: a) incorporation of an increasing number of harvesters b) constant search for, and adoption of, new tree species to supply bark c) the gradual spatial expansion of the harvest area.

The prevalence of individual EbA practices varied across smallholder farms. Common EbA practices included live fences, home gardens, <b>shade</b> <b>trees</b> in coffee <b>plantations,</b> and dispersed <b>trees</b> in maize fields.

Factors associated with the presence or characteristics of individual EbA practices included the size of coffee plantations, farmer experience, farmer education, land tenure, landscape and farm type. Our analysis suggests that many smallholder farmers in Central America are already using certain EbA practices, but there is still scope for greater implementation. Policy makers, donors and technicians can encourage the broader use of EbA by smallholder farmers by facilitating farmer-to-farmer exchanges to share knowledge on EbA implementation, assessing the effectiveness of EbA practices in delivering adaptation benefits, and tailoring EbA policies and programs for smallholder farmers in different socioeconomic and biophysical contexts.
