40|$|The <b>{{subscriber}}</b> <b>loop</b> {{forms the}} final link between the. subscriber {{and the actual}} telephone network. The pair of twisted copper wires which form the loop must be well maintained to avoid poor quality service to subscriber or customer. By conducting periodic testing of the <b>subscriber</b> <b>loop,</b> the telephone company can ensure the high standards of service that they desire. The purpose of this research project is to design a new loop tester based on a digital signal processing (DSP) chip, replacing the old analog-based testers. The DSP chip uses an analog-digital converter (ADC) to take sample measurements of various signals on the <b>subscriber</b> <b>loop</b> and a digital-analog converter (DAC) to output control signals. Various algorithms are first analyzed and tested to verify their results for the tests required. Next, these algorithms {{are added to the}} software running on the DSP chip. The algorithms are then tested versus known input values to qualify the testing procedure and analysis for use on an actual <b>subscriber</b> <b>loop.</b> Finally, the software is used to provide test results of various fault conditions on a pair of twisted copper wires. The results from these tests show that the DSP-based loop tester can measure varying line resistance and capacitance due to faults present on the <b>subscriber</b> <b>loop,</b> which can lead to accurate fault analysis...|$|R

50|$|With {{the advent}} of {{sophisticated}} electronics {{in the early part}} of the 1990s, telephone service providers developed methods to share a single copper line to transmit multiple telephone calls simultaneously. Various pair gain methods using time-division multiplexing and frequency-division multiplexing prevented interference between simultaneous calls. A distant suburb may have a <b>subscriber</b> <b>loop</b> carrier or digital loop carrier system in which a remote concentrator is located near the subscribers to connect multiple local <b>subscriber</b> <b>loops</b> to one common line to a central office exchange.

40|$|The {{telecommunications}} industry {{has worked for}} over a decade to develop digital subscriber line (DSL) technologies to revitalize the embedded copper plant. Now the industry is on the threshold of reaping the benefits of this effort, bringing megabit-per-second connectivity to offices and homes. However, network providers must properly manage the introduction and application of these systems to the local network. Accurate engineering is critical to avoid incompatibilities and failed provisioning that would otherwise create customer disappointment, delay and higher costs. An understanding of <b>subscriber</b> <b>loop</b> make-ups, including length, wire gauge and location of bridged taps, is key to the proper engineering of DSL systems. While some loop records exist, they may be inaccurate or out of date. Knowing the types of systems that are transmitting in a given cable is also critical, because of the resultant crosstalk and the potential need for spectrum management.

The effect of derived timing jitter on the echo cancellation accuracy is completely eliminated for a loop timed transceiver (as in a digital <b>subscriber</b> <b>loop</b> network termination transceiver), and is easily reduced to negligible levels for a nonloop timed transceiver (as in a digital <b>subscriber</b> <b>loop</b> line card transceiver or a voiceband data modem).

40|$|A {{signal line}} driving circuit with power control for {{selectively}} reducing internal power dissipation when driving an external load. While driving the external load with a constant current the output voltage generated across such load is monitored.

Such a signal line driving circuit is particularly advantageous as a subscriber line interface circuit (SLIC). As the subscriber goes from an on-hook condition to an off-hook condition and if the <b>subscriber</b> <b>loop</b> is sufficiently short (or low in impedance), a lower power supply voltage is used to minimize the power dissipation of the SLIC while still maintaining the required <b>subscriber</b> <b>loop</b> current...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to propose an approach for single-ended loop characterization by which the insertion loss (IL) over a <b>subscriber</b> <b>loop</b> can be estimated to within ± 1 dB accuracy based on some measurements from the central office (CO) only. The estimation of transmission loss at 1 kHz is an essential requirement for both basic plain old telephone services (POTS) and special services provided by telephone companies (telcos). The loss at 1 kHz is used as an indication {{of the quality of the}} connection. To maintain the quality (loss) of the <b>subscriber</b> <b>loops</b> at a certain level, skilled technicians are conventionally needed to perform two-ended loss measurements at both the customer end and the central office. The latest methods used in the industry require large but unreliable data base. These result in substantial expenses to telephone companies. Our objective is to replace these by an automatic procedure. Estimation of the loop loss based on measurements from the Central Office only is complicated by the fact that the customer's terminal set may be one of a wide variety of terminations and will not, in general, be known to the operating companies. The approach proposed in this thesis is intended for voice band special services for Carrier Serving Area (CSA) loops in digital loop carrier (DLC) systems. The problem is formulated as that of modelling a two port network using single port measurements. The parameters of the model representing the <b>subscriber</b> <b>loop</b> are determined so as to minimize the input impedance error at several frequencies for arbitrary customer's termination. It is shown that using this model for insertion loss estimation results in errors within the required 1 dB at 1 kHz. Next, a simple algorithm is proposed to use the same parameters in the model to determine insertion loss at higher voice frequencies. Finally, effect of error in input impedance measurement on loss estimation is studied...|$|R
