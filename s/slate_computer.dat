40|$|Empirical {{research}} has demonstrated that simple design modifications in the electronic medical record (EMR) can improve user acceptance. Changes, such as pagination, the use of wireless pen slate computers and the use of digital ink (the graphic representation of the pen across the computer screen), can make dramatic differences in user performance, reduce uncertainty and increase acceptability. No survey has asked primary care physicians (PCPs) their preference of computer type for use during a consultation. Neither has any investigation determined whether or not physicians believed they could benefit from the use of handwriting (in the entry form of digital ink) as a supplement to the EMR. A survey was prepared to see if a group of PCPs in private practice was receptive to the use of digital ink, and what type of computer - desktop or wireless pen slate - would be preferred for use during a consultation. A wireless pen <b>slate</b> <b>computer</b> was described as having a screen large enough to display the same image seen on a desktop computer. Screen captures were used to demonstrate digital ink for handwriting and drawing. One-hundred-and-fifty-six of the 411 physicians responded (37. 95 %). Five physicians (3. 2 %) used a computer during a consultation. Ninety-nine (63. 46 %) would be willing to use a computer during a consultation. One-hundred-and-twenty-one (77. 56 %) indicated that digital ink would be useful as a supplement to the EMR. Of those who would use a computer during a consultation, 91 / 99 (91. 09 %) preferred a wireless pen <b>slate</b> <b>computer</b> to a desktop computer. Subgroup analysis indicated that those physicians who had been in practice more than 25 years or those who had low volume practices were less likely to desire a computer for use during a consultation. No subgroup showed less than 73 % support for the use of handwriting in the EMR. Lack of standards (47. 68 %) and costs (40. 40 %) were chosen as the major reasons for not purchasing an EMR. Sixty-one PCPs (36. 42 %) indicated that a lack of typing skills was an issue and 39 (25. 83 %) said they had no time to learn. The use of handwriting in the EMR was broadly supported by this group of PCPs in private practice. Likewise, wireless pen computers were the overwhelming choice of computer for use during a consultation. In this group, older and lower volume physicians were less likely to desire a computer for use during a consultation. User acceptance of the EMR may be related to how closely it resembles the processes that are being automated. More surveys are required to determine the needs and expectations of physicians. The data also support other research studies that demonstrate the preference for handwriting and wireless computers, and the need for a limited, standardised and controlled vocabulary...|$|E

For text input, users rely on handwriting recognition via an active digitizer, touching an on-screen keyboard using fingertips or a stylus, or using an external keyboard that {{can usually be}} attached via a wireless or USB connection.|$|R

40|$|We explore {{techniques}} for a slender and untethered stylus prototype enhanced {{with a full}} suite of inertial sensors (three-axis accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer). We present a taxonomy of enhanced stylus input techniques and consider a number of novel possibilities that combine motion sensors with pen stroke and touchscreen inputs on a pen + touch slate. These inertial sensors enable motion-gesture inputs, as well sensing the context of how the user is holding or using the stylus, even when the pen is not {{in contact with the}} tablet screen. Our initial results suggest that sensor-enhanced stylus input offers a potentially rich modality to augment interaction with <b>slate</b> <b>computers...</b>|$|R

5000|$|The EXOPC is a Tablet PC, in slate form, {{that uses}} Windows 7 Home Premium as its {{operating}} system, {{and is designed}} by {{the company of the}} same name, based in Quebec, Canada. The EXOPC Slate is manufactured by Pegatron. The first EXOPC slate was launched in October 2010 directly from EXOPC Corp. on their website, and in Canada through the company Hypertechnologie Ciara. [...] Hypertechnologie Ciara markets the slate under the name Ciara Vibe. Probitas markets the EXOPC as Mobi-One in Southern Europe and North Africa. RM Education markets the EXOPC in the UK as the RM <b>Slate.</b> Leader <b>Computers</b> markets the EXOPC in Australia. The EXOPC Slate is also currently available in the United States via the Microsoft Store, both online and in stores. Mustek markets it as the Mecer Lucid Slate in South Africa.|$|R

The review contains {{outline of the}} evolutionary development of elementary analysis, since Gay-Lussac, Dumas and Liebig era until a present <b>slate</b> analysis, with <b>computer</b> controlled, fully automated analyzers. Physical principles of high temperature and low temperature combustions are discussed. Technical foundations on conjunctions of the high temperature combustion with chromatographic separations of the ultimate combustion products of organic samples, is delineated. Commercially available elemental analyzers are compared and their construction and operating principles are described. The basic methods of determination of environmental carbon and nitrogen are discussed. The representative analyzers for environmental carbon and nitrogen analysis are presented and their operating principles are described. Zadanie pt.
