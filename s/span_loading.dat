40|$|The {{question}} {{of the effect of}} distribution and magnitude of spanwise circulation and shed vorticity from an airplane wing on the distribution pattern of agricultural products distributed from an airplane was studied. The first step in an analysis of this question is the determination of the actual distribution of lift along an airplane wing, from which the pattern of shed vorticity can be determined. A procedure is developed to calculate the <b>span</b> <b>loading</b> for flapped and unflapped wings of arbitrary aspect ratio and taper ratio. The procedure was programmed on a small programmable calculator, the Hewlett Packard HP- 97, and also was programmed in BASIC language. They could be used to explore the variations in <b>span</b> <b>loading</b> that can be secured by variable flap deflections or the effect of flying at varying air speeds at different airplane gross weights. Either an absolute evaluation of <b>span</b> <b>loading</b> can be secured or comparative <b>span</b> <b>loading</b> can be evaluated to determine their effect on swath width and swath distribution pattern. The programs are intended to assist the user in evaluating the effect of a given spanload distribution...|$|E
40|$|Flight tests {{evaluating}} {{the effects of}} altered <b>span</b> <b>loading,</b> turbulence ingestion, combinations of mass and turbulence ingestion, and combinations of altered <b>span</b> <b>loading</b> turbulance ingestion on trailed wake vortex attenuation were conducted. Span loadings were altered in flight by varying the deflections of the inboard and outboard flaps on a B- 747 aircraft. Turbulence ingestion was achieved in flight by mounting splines on a C- 54 G aircraft. Mass and turbulence ingestion was achieved in flight by varying the thrust on the B- 747 aircraft. Combinations of altered <b>span</b> <b>loading</b> and turbulence ingestion were achieved in flight by installing a spoiler on a CV- 990 aircraft and by deflecting the existing spoilers on a B- 747 aircraft. The characteristics of the attenuated and unattenuated vortexes were determined by probing them with smaller aircraft. Acceptable separation distances for encounters with the attenuated and unattenuated vortexes are presented...|$|E
40|$|Tangential and axial {{velocity}} profiles were {{measured in the}} far field wake vortices of several different airfoils. The results are summarized and discussed. A scanning laser velocimeter was used to obtain data up to 1000 chord lengths behind airfoils with rectangular, diamond-shaped, and swept wing planforms at several different angles of attack. The results show general agreement with wind tunnel measurements made in the near field. The results identify two separate flow regions for the dependence of vortex maximum tangential velocity on downstream distance; an inviscid region where the velocity remains constant after rollup to downstream distances of 200 chord lengths, and then a decay or viscous region that persisted to the limit of the test distance. The decay rates appear {{to be sensitive to}} both angle of attack and <b>span</b> <b>loading.</b> The maximum tangential velocity for downstream distances to 40 span lengths was reduced by a factor of 2 by changing from an elliptic (swept wing) or rectangular <b>span</b> <b>loading</b> to a triangular-like <b>span</b> <b>loading</b> (diamond-shaped planform wing). Measured {{axial velocity}} defects are shown to agree with those predicted by laminar theory...|$|E
40|$|Vortex wake {{alleviation}} {{studies were}} conducted in a wind tunnel and a water towing tank using a multisegmented wing model which provided controlled and measured variations in <b>span</b> <b>load.</b> Fourteen model configurations are tested at a Reynolds number of one million and a lift coefficient of 0. 6 in the Langley 4 - by 7 -Meter Tunnel and the Hydronautics Ship Model Basin water tank at Hydronautics, Inc., Laurel, Md. Detailed measurements of <b>span</b> <b>load</b> and wake velocities at one semispan downstream correlate well with each other, with inviscid predictions of <b>span</b> <b>load</b> and wake roll up, and with peak trailing-wing rolling moments measured in the far wake. Average trailing-wing rolling moments {{are found to be}} an unreliable indicator of vortex wake intensity because vortex meander does not scale between test facilities and free-air conditions. A tapered-span-load configuration, which exhibits little or no drag penalty, is shown to offer significant downstream wake alleviation to a small trailing wing. The greater downstream wake alleviation achieved with the addition of spoilers to a flapped-wing configuration is shown to result directly from the high incremental drag and turbulence associated with the spoilers and not from the <b>span</b> <b>load</b> alteration they cause...|$|R
40|$|A {{method of}} {{computing}} <b>span</b> <b>loads</b> {{and the resulting}} rolling moments for sideslipping wings of arbitrary plan form in incompressible flow is derived. The method requires that the <b>span</b> <b>load</b> at zero sideslip be known for the wing under consideration. Because this information is available {{for a variety of}} wings, this requirement should not seriously restrict the application of the present method. The basic method derived herein requires a mechanical differentiation and integration to obtain the rolling moment for the general wing in sideslip. For wings having straight leading and trailing edges over each semispan, the rolling moment due to sideslip is given by a simple equation in terms of plan-form parameters and the lateral center of pressure of the lift due to angle of attack. Calculated <b>span</b> <b>loads</b> and rolling-moment parameters are compared with experimental values. The comparison indicates good agreement between calculations and available experimental data...|$|R
40|$|A {{theoretical}} {{method was}} developed for determining the optimum <b>span</b> <b>load</b> distribution for minimum induced drag for subsonic nonplanar configurations. The undistorted wing wake is assumed to have piecewise linear variation of shed vortex sheet strength, resulting in a quadratic variation of bound circulation and <b>span</b> <b>load.</b> The optimum loading is obtained either through a direct technique, whereby derivatives of the drag expression are calculated analytically {{in terms of the}} unknown wake vortex sheet strengths. Both techniques agree well {{with each other and with}} available exact solutions for minimum induced drag...|$|R
40|$|A {{simplified}} lifting-surface {{theory is}} applied to the problem of evaluating <b>span</b> <b>loading</b> due to flap deflection for arbitrary wing plan forms. With the resulting procedure, the effects of flap deflection on the <b>span</b> <b>loading</b> and associated aerodynamic characteristics can be easily computed for any wing which is symmetrical about the root chord and which has a straight quarter-chord line over the wing semispan. The effects of compressibility and spanwise variation of section lift-curve slope are taken into account by the procedure. The method presented {{can also be used to}} calculate the downwash in the vertical center of the wake of a wing which has arbitrary spanwise loading...|$|E
40|$|The plateau {{region in}} which {{trailing}} vortices initially exhibit slow decay of maximum tangential speed is demonstrated {{with the aid}} of constant and variable eddy viscosity models. The existence of the plateau is explained by the presence of the viscous core and by the necessity for transition of the initial, nearly inviscid profile to similarity far downstream. <b>Span</b> <b>loading</b> is shown to affect the initial maximum tangential speed as well as the duration of the plateau region. Triangular <b>span</b> <b>loading</b> is shown to present less hazard to trailing aircraft, at least in the near field, than elliptic loading because the inviscid profile for triangular loading exhibits a finite tangential speed at the vortex centerline and a large inviscid core...|$|E
40|$|The Weissinger {{method for}} {{determining}} additional <b>span</b> <b>loading</b> {{has been used}} to find the lift-curve slope, spanwise center of pressure, aerodynamic center location, and <b>span</b> <b>loading</b> coefficients of untwisted and uncambered wings having a wide range of plan forms characterized by various combinations of sweep, aspect ratio, and taper ratio. The results are presented as variations of the aerodynamic characteristics with sweep angle for various values of aspect ratio and taper ratio. Methods are also included for determining induced drag and the approximate effects of compressibility. Despite the limitations of a lifting line method such as Weissinger's, the good agreement found between experimentally and theoretically determined characteristics warrants confidence in the method. In particular, it is believed that trends observed in results of the Weissinger method should be reliable. One of the most significant results showed that for each angle of sweep there is a taper ratio for which aspect ratio has little effect on the <b>span</b> <b>loading</b> and for which the loading is practically elliptical. This elliptic loading is approached at a taper ratio of 1. 39 for 30 degree of sweepforward, 0. 45 for zero degree of sweepback. (author) ...|$|E

40|$|This {{presentation}} discusses open or unlimited {{class aircraft}} performance limitations and design solutions. Limitations {{in this class}} of aircraft include slow climbing flight which requires low wing loading, high cruise speed which requires high wing loading, gains in induced or viscous drag alone which result in only half the gain overall and other structural problems (yaw inertia and spins, flutter and static loads integrity).

40|$|Measurements {{were made}} in the NASA-Ames 40 - by 80 -foot wind tunnel of the rolling moment induced on a {{following}} model in the wake 13. 6 spans behind a subsonic transport model for a variety of trailing edge flap settings of the generator. It was found that the rolling moment on the following model was reduced substantially, compared to the conventional landing configuration, by reshaping the <b>span</b> <b>loading</b> on the generating model to approximate a <b>span</b> <b>loading,</b> found in earlier studies, which resulted in reduced wake velocities. This was accomplished by retracting the outboard trailing edge flaps. It was concluded, based on flow visualization conducted in the wind tunnel as well as in a water tow facility, that this flap arrangement redistributes the vorticity shed by the wing along the span to form three vortex pairs that interact to disperse the wake...|$|E
40|$|A flow {{visualization}} {{technique was}} developed {{which allows the}} nature of lift-generated wakes behind aircraft models to be investigated. The technique was applied to models being towed underwater in a ship model basin. Seven different configurations of a small-scale model of a 747 transport aircraft were used to allow observation of typical vortex interactions and merging in multiple vortex wakes. It was established that {{the motion of the}} wake vortices is often sensitive to small changes in either wing <b>span</b> <b>loading</b> or model attitude. Landing gear deployement was found to cause a far-field reformation of vorticity behind a model configuration which dissipated concentrated vorticity in the near-field wake. Alleviation of wake vorticity is achievable by configuring the wing <b>span</b> <b>loading</b> to cause the wake vortices to move in paths that result in their interactions and merging.

Tests were run at angles of attack from - 3 to + 5 deg over the Mach number range 0. 6 to 0. 85 at a Reynolds number of about 9, 000, 000. Results of these tests indicate that the nacelle interference drag can be quite large relative to an uninstalled nacelle. However, the losses due to the nacelle were reduced to acceptable levels by changes to the wing leading edge and nacelle intersection.
