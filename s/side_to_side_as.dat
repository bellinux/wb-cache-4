5|$|While seated {{upon the}} bare rocks I have often {{observed}} these little animals watching me, apparently {{with as much}} curiosity as I watched them, turning their heads from <b>side</b> <b>to</b> <b>side</b> <b>as</b> if {{in an effort to}} be wise. If I kept quiet for a few minutes they would creep up to me and finally upon me; if I moved, they ran down the faces of the rocks, and turning, stuck their heads above the edges to watch me.|$|E
5|$|Even when staying {{relatively}} motionless, a rider can {{balance a}} bike {{by the same}} principle. While performing a track stand, the rider can keep {{the line between the}} two contact patches under the combined center of mass by steering the front wheel to {{one side or the other}} and then moving forward and backward slightly to move the front contact patch from <b>side</b> <b>to</b> <b>side</b> <b>as</b> necessary. Forward motion can be generated simply by pedaling. Backwards motion can be generated the same way on a fixed-gear bicycle. Otherwise, the rider can take advantage of an opportune slope of the pavement or lurch the upper body backwards while the brakes are momentarily engaged.|$|E
5|$|Charlton took {{advice from}} Celtic manager Jock Stein, who {{allowed him to}} sign right-sided midfielder Bobby Murdoch on a free transfer. Besides Murdoch the club already had ten players who Charlton moulded into a {{championship}} winning side: Jim Platt (goalkeeper), John Craggs (right-back), Stuart Boam and Willie Maddren (centre-backs), Frank Spraggon (left-back), David Armstrong (left midfield), Graeme Souness (central midfield), Alan Foggon (attacking midfield), John Hickton and David Mills (forwards). Some of these players were already settled at the club and in their positions, whilst Charlton {{had to work with}} some of the other players. He moved Souness from left midfield to central midfield to compensate for his lack of pace and coached him to play the ball forward rather than <b>side</b> <b>to</b> <b>side</b> <b>as</b> was his instinct. Foggon was played in a new role which Charlton created to break the offside trap set by opposition defenders, an extremely fast player he was instructed to run behind defenders and latch on to the long ball to find himself one-on-one with the goalkeeper.|$|E

25|$|USS England {{was placed}} {{farthest}} from the blast center and thus experienced the least damage, {{the most serious}} of which was only a dent where a boulder had hit the ship.

5|$|In frogs, the {{hind legs}} {{are larger than}} the fore legs, {{especially}} so in those species that principally move by jumping or swimming. In the walkers and runners the hind limbs are not so large, and the burrowers mostly have short limbs and broad bodies. The feet have adaptations for the way of life, with webbing between the toes for swimming, broad adhesive toe pads for climbing, and keratinised tubercles on the hind feet for digging (frogs usually dig backwards into the soil). In most salamanders, the limbs are short and {{more or less the}} same length and project at right angles from the body. Locomotion on land is by walking and the tail often swings from side to side or is used as a prop, particularly when climbing. In their normal gait, only one leg is advanced at a time in the manner adopted by their ancestors, the lobe-finned fish. Some salamanders in the genus Aneides and certain plethodontids climb trees and have long limbs, large toepads and prehensile tails. In aquatic salamanders and in frog tadpoles, the tail has dorsal and ventral fins and is moved from <b>side</b> <b>to</b> <b>side</b> <b>as</b> a means of propulsion. Adult frogs do not have tails and caecilians have only very short ones.|$|E
500|$|For 15 minutes, {{beginning}} at 13:15, 46 {{minutes after the}} scheduled time, Greeneville performed a series of drastic maneuvers, including high-speed, full-rudder, 35-degree turns <b>side</b> <b>to</b> <b>side,</b> <b>as</b> well as rapid up-and-down movements. [...] Waddle personally directed the maneuvers. [...] According to Waddle, the DVs [...] "were loving it." [...] Waddle adds, [...] "I could barely suppress a smile as I watched the expressions of joy and amazement {{on the faces of}} our distinguished visitors." [...] During the maneuvers, several civilians in the sonar room conversed with the sonar technicians, who were at the same time trying to keep track of any sonar contacts in the vicinity.|$|E

2500|$|Several {{developers}} at {{the time}} were also experimenting with pseudo-3D and stereoscopic 3D using 2D sprites on raster displays. In 1979, Nintendo's Radar Scope introduced a three-dimensional third-person perspective to the shoot 'em up genre, later imitated by shooters such as Konami's Juno First and Activision's Beamrider in 1983. In 1981, Sega's Turbo was the first racing game to feature a third-person rear view format, and use sprite scaling with full-colour graphics. Namco's Pole Position featured an improved rear-view racer format in 1982 that would remain the standard for the genre; the game provided a perspective view of the track, with its vanishing point swaying <b>side</b> <b>to</b> <b>side</b> <b>as</b> the player approaches corners, accurately simulating forward movement into the distance. That same year, Sega released Zaxxon, which introduced the use of isometric graphics and shadows; and SubRoc-3D, which introduced the use of stereoscopic 3D through a special eyepiece; ...|$|E

50|$|Other {{variants}} of the Foucault test include the Gaviola or Caustic test which can measure mirrors of fast f/ratio more accurately than the Foucault test which {{is limited to}} about (λ/8) wavelength accuracy on small and medium sized mirrors. The Caustic test is capable of measuring larger mirrors and achieving a (λ/20) wave peak to valley accuracy by using a testing stage which is adjusted from <b>side</b> <b>to</b> <b>side</b> so <b>as</b> <b>to</b> measure each zone of {{each side of the}} mirror from the center of its curvature.|$|R
50|$|During the 1960s, Dvorak {{designed}} the left- and right-handed Dvorak patterns for touch-typing {{with only one}} hand. He tried to minimize the need to move the hand from <b>side</b> <b>to</b> <b>side</b> (lateral travel), <b>as</b> well as to minimize finger movement.

5000|$|Single-wheel: {{a single}} {{rear-mounted}} wheel. Though of limited towing capacity, this design {{tends to be}} more stable (when moving) than trailers with two or more wheels. The single wheel can tilt from <b>side</b> <b>to</b> <b>side</b> when cornering (<b>as</b> the bicycle itself does,) allowing for coordinated turns at relatively high speed. The connection to the bicycle is simpler than a two-wheeled trailer since only two degrees of freedom are required- the trailer tilts with the towing bicycle.|$|R

The shock wave reportedly caused the ship <b>to</b> move <b>side</b> <b>to</b> <b>side</b> by <b>as</b> much as 4 feet. On USS Cochrane, power was lost for 5 minutes after the ship was hit by the blast overpressure. She was able to restore power and return to Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard for a hull and systems inspection and to assess {{the effects of the}} blast. The yard was impressed with how well the blast was resisted. After some minor repairs (Both the 3-Dimensional AN/SPS-39 & 2-Dimensional AN/SPS-40 Air Search Radar Antennas had to be replaced) Cochrane was cleared for her first deployment.|$|R

5|$|During group interactions, Galapagos {{sharks are}} {{dominant}} to blacktip sharks (C. limbatus) but deferent to silvertip sharks (C. albimarginatus) of equal size. When confronted or cornered, the Galapagos shark may perform a threat display {{similar to that}} of the grey reef shark, in which the shark performs an exaggerated, rolling swimming motion while arching its back, lowering its pectoral fins, puffing out its gills, and gaping its jaw. The shark may also swing its head from <b>side</b> <b>to</b> <b>side,</b> so <b>as</b> <b>to</b> keep the perceived threat within its field of vision. A known parasite of the Galapagos shark is the flatworm Dermophthirius carcharhini, which attaches to the shark's skin. In one account, a bluefin trevally (Caranax melampygus) was seen rubbing against the rough skin of a Galapagos shark to rid itself of parasites.|$|R

They interchanged their ideas rapidly, speaking in whispers into each other's faces, very close now, Dain suggesting, Lakamba contradicting, Babalatchi conciliating and anxious in his vivid apprehension of coming difficulties. He spoke most, whispering earnestly, turning his head slowly from <b>side</b> <b>to</b> <b>side</b> so <b>as</b> <b>to</b> bring his solitary eye to bear upon each of his interlocutors in turn. Why should there be strife? said he. Let Tuan Dain, whom he loved only less than his master, go trustfully into hiding. There were many places for that. Bulangi's house away in the clearing was best.|$|R
