5|$|Today, {{the closest}} living {{relatives}} of cetaceans are the hippopotamuses; these share a <b>semi-aquatic</b> ancestor that branched off from other artiodactyls some 60 mya. Around 40 mya, a common ancestor {{between the two}} branched off into cetacea and anthracotheres; nearly all anthracotheres became extinct {{at the end of}} the Pleistocene 2.5 mya, eventually leaving only one surviving lineage– the hippopotamus.|$|E
5|$|Although not well-studied, {{there is}} growing {{acceptance}} of three species of Malagasy hippopotamus. It is not known when or exactly how these hippos arrived {{on the island of}} Madagascar. As hippos are <b>semi-aquatic,</b> it is possible that they survived the 400km (248mi) trek across the channel, although presumably when the water was shallower and there were perhaps small islands along the way. It is possible that the three species of hippopotamus represent three distinct and successful colonizations of the island. Hippos are the only endemic ungulates ever to have lived on Madagascar.|$|E
5|$|Ford and Martin (2010) {{proposed}} that Psittacosaurus was <b>semi-aquatic,</b> swimming with its tail like a crocodile, and paddling and kicking. They based their interpretation on evidence including: the lacustrine (lake) depositional setting of many specimens; {{the position of}} the nostrils and eyes; interpretations of the motions of the arms and legs; tails with long chevrons (and with the bristles on the tail interpreted as possibly skin-covered, forming a fin), providing a propulsive surface; and the presence of gastroliths, interpreted as ballast. They further suggested that some species of Psittacosaurus were more terrestrial than others.|$|E
5|$|The two living non-archosaurian reptile taxa, {{testudines}} (turtles) and lepidosaurians (lizards and tuataras), {{along with}} choristoderes (<b>semi-aquatic</b> archosauromorphs that would die {{out in the}} early Miocene), survived across the K–Pg boundary. More than 80% of Cretaceous turtle species passed through the K–Pg boundary. Additionally, all six turtle families in existence {{at the end of}} the Cretaceous survived into the Paleogene and are represented by living species. Living lepidosaurs include the tuataras (the only living rhynchocephalians) and the squamates. The rhynchocephalians were a widespread and relatively successful group of lepidosaurians during the early Mesozoic, but began to decline by the mid-Cretaceous, although they were very successful in the Late Cretaceous of South America. They are represented today by a single genus, located exclusively in New Zealand.|$|E
5|$|In 2016, the {{estimated}} number of dinosaur species {{that existed in}} the Mesozoic era was estimated to be 1,543–2,468. Some are herbivorous, others carnivorous, including seed-eaters, fish-eaters, insectivores, and omnivores. While dinosaurs were ancestrally bipedal (as are all modern birds), some prehistoric species were quadrupeds, and others, such as Ammosaurus and Iguanodon, could walk just as easily on two or four legs. Cranial modifications like horns and crests are common dinosaurian traits, and some extinct species had bony armor. Although known for large size, many Mesozoic dinosaurs were human-sized or smaller, and modern birds are generally small in size. Dinosaurs today inhabit every continent, and fossils show that they had achieved global distribution by at least the early Jurassic period. Modern birds inhabit most available habitats, from terrestrial to marine, and there is evidence that some non-avian dinosaurs (such as Microraptor) could fly or at least glide, and others, such as spinosaurids, had <b>semi-aquatic</b> habits.|$|E
5|$|The forest cobra (Naja melanoleuca), also {{commonly}} called the black cobra {{and the black}} and white-lipped cobra, is a species of venomous snake in the family Elapidae. The species is native to Africa, mostly the central and western parts of the continent. It is the largest true cobra species with a total length (including tail) of up to 3.1 meters (10 feet). Although it prefers lowland forest and moist savanna habitats, this cobra is highly adaptable {{and can be found}} in drier climates within its geographical range. It is a very capable swimmer and is often considered to be <b>semi-aquatic.</b> The forest cobra is a generalist in its feeding habits, having a highly varied diet: anything from large insects to small mammals and other reptiles. This species is alert, nervous and {{is considered to be a}} very dangerous snake. When cornered or molested, it will assume the typical cobra warning posture by raising its fore body off the ground, spreading a narrow hood, and hissing loudly. Bites to humans are less common than from other African cobras due to various factors, though a bite from this species is a life-threatening emergency.|$|E
5|$|In stream {{communities}}, few animal groups became extinct {{because such}} communities rely less directly on food from living plants {{and more on}} detritus that washes in from the land, buffering them from extinction. Similar, but more complex patterns {{have been found in}} the oceans. Extinction was more severe among animals living in the water column than among animals living on or in the sea floor. Animals in the water column are almost entirely dependent on primary production from living phytoplankton, while animals living on or in the ocean floor feed on detritus or can switch to detritus feeding. Coccolithophorids and mollusks (including ammonites, rudists, freshwater snails, and mussels), and those organisms whose food chain included these shell builders, became extinct or suffered heavy losses. For example, it is thought that ammonites were the principal food of mosasaurs, a group of giant marine reptiles that became extinct at the boundary. The largest air-breathing survivors of the event, crocodyliforms and champsosaurs, were <b>semi-aquatic</b> and had access to detritus. Modern crocodilians can live as scavengers, can survive for months without food, and their young are small, grow slowly, and feed largely on invertebrates and dead organisms or fragments of organisms for their first few years. These characteristics have been linked to crocodilian survival {{at the end of the}} Cretaceous.|$|E
25|$|A new fossil of Spinosaurus {{confirms}} it as {{the first}} known swimming dinosaur and the only known <b>semi-aquatic</b> dinosaur.|$|E
25|$|Most aquatic and <b>semi-aquatic</b> {{amphibians}} have a membranous skin {{which allows}} them to absorb water directly through it. Some <b>semi-aquatic</b> animals also have similarly permeable bladder membrane. As as result, {{they tend to have}} high rates of urine production to offset this high water intake, and have urine which is low in dissolved salts. The urinary bladder assists such animals to retain salts. Some aquatic amphibian such as Xenopus do not reabsorb water, to prevent excessive water influx. For land-dwelling amphibians, dehydration results in reduced urine output.|$|E
25|$|Adventure Aquarium – Originally {{opened in}} 1992, it re-opened {{in its current}} form in May 2005 {{featuring}} about 8,000 animals living in varied forms of <b>semi-aquatic,</b> freshwater, and marine habitats.|$|E
25|$|Numerous {{species of}} land mammals {{are found in}} the Yangtze valley, but most of these are not {{directly}} associated with the river. Three exceptions are the <b>semi-aquatic</b> Eurasian otter, water deer and Père David's deer.|$|E
25|$|The {{suggestion}} that Lystrosaurus was helped {{to survive and}} dominate by being <b>semi-aquatic</b> has a similar weakness: although temnospondyls become more abundant in the Karoo's Triassic sediments, they were much less numerous than L. murrayi and L. declivis.|$|E
25|$|It had aquatic adaptations {{including}} flattened tail {{bones and}} remnants of soft tissue between {{the toes of}} the back feet, suggesting that they were webbed. Previously the earliest known <b>semi-aquatic</b> mammaliaforms were from the Eocene, about 110M years later.|$|E
25|$|Grasping and/or {{grappling}} mating situations {{have also}} been documented in Calopteryx haemorrhoidalis haemorrhoidalis (Odonata), fallow deer (Dama dama), wild orangutans (Smuts 1993), wild chimpanzees, water voles (<b>semi-aquatic</b> rats) Arvicola amphibius, feral fowl, mallard (Anas platyrhynchos), hamadryas baboons and many other primates, coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch), and others.|$|E
25|$|Teinolophos, from Australia, is the {{earliest}} known monotreme. A 2007 study (published 2008) suggests {{that it was not}} a basal (primitive, ancestral) monotreme but a full-fledged platypus, and therefore that the platypus and echidna lineages diverged considerably earlier. A more recent study (2009), however, has suggested that, while Teinolophos was a type of platypus, it was also a basal monotreme and predated the radiation of modern monotremes. The <b>semi-aquatic</b> lifestyle of platypuses prevented them from being outcompeted by the marsupials that migrated to Australia millions of years ago, since joeys need to remain attached to their mothers and would drown if their mothers ventured into water (though there are exceptions like the water opossum and the lutrine opossum; however, they both live in South America and thus don't come into contact with monotremes). Genetic evidence has determined that echidnas diverged from the platypus lineage as recently as 19-48M, when they made their transition from <b>semi-aquatic</b> to terrestrial lifestyle.|$|E
25|$|Today, {{the closest}} living {{relatives}} of cetaceans are the hippopotamuses; these share a <b>semi-aquatic</b> ancestor that branched off from other artiodactyls some 60 million years ago.

25|$|Galicia's many {{hydroelectric}} dams {{take advantage}} of the steep, deep, narrow rivers and their canyons. Due to their steep course, few of Galicia's rivers are navigable, other than the lower portion of the Miño and the portions of various rivers that have been dammed into reservoirs. Some rivers are navigable by small boats in their lower reaches: this is taken great advantage of in a number of <b>semi-aquatic</b> festivals and pilgrimages.|$|E
25|$|The seepage {{salamander}} {{does not}} experience much {{competition from other}} species of salamanders due to its habitat. Because it is a terrestrial salamander, it is not disturbed by the <b>semi-aquatic</b> and aquatic salamanders. Almost all other Desmognathus species are found at closer distances to streams. The lack of competition also {{may be due to}} the fact that it is very secretive. It is seldom seen on the surface, which may be an anti-predatory response.|$|E
25|$|Labyrinthodonts were {{generally}} amphibian-like in build. They were short-legged and mostly large headed, with moderately short to long tails. Many groups, {{and all the}} early forms, were large animals. Primitive members of all labyrinthodont groups were probably true water predators, and various degrees of amphibious, <b>semi-aquatic</b> and semi terrestrial modes of living arose independently in different groups. Some lineages remained waterbound or became secondarily fully aquatic with reduced limbs and elongated, eel-like bodies.|$|E
25|$|According to the phylogenetic tree, the seepage {{salamander}} branched {{deep within}} the tree of the Desmognathus species. D. aeneus is a sister group to all species of Desmognathus except D. wrighti, which is an outgroup. D. aeneus and D. wrighti have distinct character differences {{from the rest of}} the Desmognathus species. They are the smallest species, direct-developers, and the most terrestrial, with all other species being <b>semi-aquatic</b> or aquatic. Since these two species branch the earliest, evolution has moved toward larger body size, lengthened larval periods, and more aquatic habitats within Desmognathus.|$|E
25|$|Osborne {{studied a}} huge {{diversity}} of plant species, from the aquatic liverwort to the commercially important African oil palm. Other topics of research within plant science included auxin herbicides; dormancy in potato tubers; growth regulation in aquatic and <b>semi-aquatic</b> plants; linking plant ultrastructure with physiology and biochemistry; and protein and RNA synthesis in plants. She {{was active in}} the field of space biology, designing a project for Spacelab studying the role of gravity on development in grass, and serving on the Royal Society British National Committee on Space Research for a decade.|$|E
25|$|In the 17th century, {{based on}} a {{question}} raised by the Bishop of Quebec, the Roman Catholic Church ruled that the beaver was a fish (beaver flesh {{was a part of}} the indigenous peoples' diet, prior to the Europeans' arrival) for purposes of dietary law. Therefore, the general prohibition on the consumption of meat on Fridays did not apply to beaver meat. The legal basis for the decision probably rests with the Summa Theologica of Thomas Aquinas, which bases animal classification as much on habit as anatomy. This is similar to the Church's classification of other <b>semi-aquatic</b> rodents, such as the capybara and muskrat.|$|E
25|$|The {{close of}} the Cretaceous period saw {{the demise of the}} Mesozoic era reptilian megafauna (see the Cretaceous–Paleogene {{extinction}} event). Of the large marine reptiles, only sea turtles were left; and of the non-marine large reptiles, only the <b>semi-aquatic</b> crocodiles and broadly similar choristoderes survived the extinction, with the latter becoming extinct in the Miocene. Of the great host of dinosaurs dominating the Mesozoic, only the small beaked birds survived. This dramatic extinction pattern {{at the end of the}} Mesozoic led into the Cenozoic. Mammals and birds filled the empty niches left behind by the reptilian megafauna and, while reptile diversification slowed, bird and mammal diversification took an exponential turn. However, reptiles were still important components of the megafauna, particularly in the form of giant tortoises.|$|E
25|$|Although {{all living}} opossums are {{essentially}} opportunistic omnivores, different species vary {{in the amount}} of meat and vegetation they include in their diet. Members of the Caluromyinae are essentially frugivorous; whereas the lutrine opossum and Patagonian opossum primarily feed on other animals. The yapok (Chironectes minimus) is particularly unusual, as it is the only living <b>semi-aquatic</b> marsupial, using its webbed hindlimbs to dive in search of freshwater mollusks and crayfish. The extinct Thylophorops, the largest known opossum at 4-7 kilos, was a macropredator. Most opossums are scansorial, well-adapted to life in the trees or on the ground, but members of the Caluromyinae and Glironiinae are primarily arboreal, whereas species of Metachirus, Monodelphis, and to a lesser degree Didelphis show adaptations for life on the ground.|$|E
25|$|The main {{sections}} of the Ganges River are home to the gharial (Gavialis gangeticus) and mugger crocodile (Crocodylus palustris), and the delta {{is home to the}} saltwater crocodile (C. porosus). Among the numerous aquatic and <b>semi-aquatic</b> turtles in the Ganges basin are the northern river terrapin (Batagur baska; only in the lowermost section of the basin), three-striped roofed turtle (B. dhongoka), red-crowned roofed turtle (B. kachuga), black pond turtle (Geoclemys hamiltonii), Brahminy river turtle (Hardella thurjii), Indian black turtle (Melanochelys trijuga), Indian eyed turtle (Morenia petersi), brown roofed turtle (Pangshura smithii), Indian roofed turtle (Pangshura tecta), Indian tent turtle (Pangshura tentoria), Indian flapshell turtle (Lissemys punctata), Indian narrow-headed softshell turtle (Chitra indica), Indian softshell turtle (Nilssonia gangetica), Indian peacock softshell turtle (N. hurum) and Cantor's giant softshell turtle (Pelochelys cantorii; only in the lowermost section of Ganges basin). Most of these are seriously threatened.|$|E
25|$|While most labyrinthodonts {{remained}} aquatic or <b>semi-aquatic,</b> {{some of the}} reptile-like amphibians {{adapted to}} explore the terrestrial ecological niches as small or medium-sized predators. They evolved increasingly terrestrial adaptions during the Carboniferous, including stronger vertebrae and slender limbs, and a deeper skull with laterally placed eyes. They probably had watertight skin, possibly covered with a horny epidermis overlaying small bony nodules, forming scutes, {{similar to those found}} in modern caecilians. To the modern eye, these animals would appear like heavyset, lizards betraying their amphibious nature only by their lack of claws and by spawning aquatic eggs. In the middle or late Carboniferous, smaller forms gave rise to the first reptiles. In the late Carboniferous, a global rainforest collapse favoured the more terrestrially adapted reptiles, while the many of their amphibian relatives failed to reestablish. Some reptile-like amphibians did flourish in the new seasonal environment. The reptilomorph family Diadectidae evolved herbivory, becoming the largest terrestrial animals of the day with barrel-shaped, heavy bodies. There were also a family of correspondingly large carnivores, the Limnoscelidae, that flourished briefly in the late Carboniferous.|$|E
25|$|Archaeoceti is a parvorder {{comprising}} ancient whales. These ancient {{whales are}} the predecessors of modern whales, stretching {{back to their}} first ancestor that spent their lives near (rarely in) the water. Likewise, the archaeocetes can be anywhere from near fully terrestrial, to <b>semi-aquatic</b> to fully aquatic, but what defines an archaeocete {{is the presence of}} visible legs or asymmetrical teeth. Their features became adapted for living in the marine environment. Major anatomical changes include the hearing set-up that channeled vibrations from the jaw to the earbone which occurred with Ambulocetus 49 million years ago, a streamlining of the body and the growth of flukes on the tail which occurred around 43 million years ago with Protocetus, the migration of the nasal openings toward the top of the cranium and the modification of the forelimbs into flippers which occurred with Basilosaurus 35 million years ago, and the shrinking and eventual disappearance of the hind limbs which took place with the first odontocetes and mysticetes 34 million years ago. The modern dolphin skeleton has two small, rod-shaped pelvic bones thought to be vestigial hind limbs. In October 2006, an unusual bottlenose dolphin was captured in Japan; it had small fins on each side of its genital slit, which scientists believe to be an unusually pronounced development of these vestigial hind limbs.|$|E

500|$|<b>Semi-aquatic</b> mammals, like pinnipeds, {{have two}} pairs of {{flippers}} {{on the front and}} back, the fore-flippers and hind-flippers. The elbows and ankles are enclosed within the body. Pinnipeds have several adaptions for reducing drag. In addition to their streamlined bodies, they have smooth networks of muscle bundles in their skin that may increase laminar flow and make it easier for them to slip through water. They also lack arrector pili, so their fur can be streamlined as they swim. They rely on their fore-flippers for locomotion in a wing-like manner similar to penguins and sea turtles. Fore-flipper movement is not continuous, and the animal glides between each stroke. Compared to terrestrial carnivorans, the fore-limbs are reduced in length, which gives the locomotor muscles at the shoulder and elbow joints greater mechanical advantage; the hind-flippers serve as stabilizers. Other <b>semi-aquatic</b> mammals include beavers, hippopotamuses, otters and platypuses. Hippos are very large <b>semi-aquatic</b> mammals, and their barrel-shaped bodies have [...] skeletal structures, adapted to carrying their enormous weight, and their specific gravity allows them to sink and move along the bottom of a river.|$|E
500|$|Many {{species of}} the second major avialan lineage to diversify, the Euornithes (meaning [...] "true birds", because they include the {{ancestors}} of modern birds), were <b>semi-aquatic</b> and specialised in eating fish and other small aquatic organisms. Unlike the enantiornithes, which dominated land-based and arboreal habitats, most early euornithes lacked perching adaptations and seem to have included shorebird-like species, waders, and swimming and diving species.|$|E
500|$|Members of the Marsileaceae are aquatic or <b>semi-aquatic.</b> [...] Plants often grow {{in dense}} clumps in mud along {{the shores of}} ponds or streams, or they may grow {{submerged}} in shallow water {{with some of the}} leaves extending to float on the water surface. They grow in seasonally wet habitats, but survive the winter or dry season by losing their leaves and producing hard, desiccation-resistant reproductive structures.|$|E
500|$|The Marsileaceae [...] are a {{small family}} of heterosporous aquatic and <b>semi-aquatic</b> ferns, though at first sight they do not {{physically}} resemble other ferns. [...] The group {{is commonly known as}} the [...] "pepperwort family" [...] or as the [...] "water-clover family" [...] because the leaves of the genus Marsilea superficially resemble the leaves of a four-leaf clover (a flowering plant). [...] Leaves of this fern have sometimes been used to substitute for clover leaves on Saint Patrick's Day. [...] In all, the family contains 3 genera and 50 to 80 species with most of those belonging to Marsilea.|$|E
500|$|The common {{hippopotamus}} (Hippopotamus amphibius), or hippo, is a large, mostly herbivorous, <b>semi-aquatic</b> mammal native to sub-Saharan Africa, {{and one of}} only two extant species in the family Hippopotamidae, the other being the pygmy hippopotamus (Choeropsis liberiensis or Hexaprotodon liberiensis).

500|$|The use of {{the common}} names [...] "frog" [...] and [...] "toad" [...] has no taxonomic justification.

The {{use of the}} term [...] "frog" [...] in common names usually refers to species that are aquatic or <b>semi-aquatic</b> and have smooth, moist skins; the term [...] "toad" [...] generally refers to species that are terrestrial with dry, warty skins. There are numerous exceptions to this rule. The European fire-bellied toad (Bombina bombina) has a slightly warty skin and prefers a watery habitat whereas the Panamanian golden frog (Atelopus zeteki) is in the toad family Bufonidae and has a smooth skin.|$|E
500|$|Perry has a {{theme song}} {{tentatively}} entitled [...] "Perry," [...] performed by Randy Crenshaw and Laura Dickinson, and written by Povenmire and Marsh, who write {{the majority of}} songs in the series.

They were nervous doing so, because, as Povenmire explained, [...] "Disney has a big history of music -- what if they hate it?" [...] Their reaction, however, was considerably positive and the pair was asked to write a song for each episode, which they vehemently agreed to.
