40|$|Abstract In ad-hoc {{networks}} and other highly distributed and decentralized environments, authorization certificates {{can be used}} to control access. Moreover, it is possible to delegate rights listed in the certificate to another users. Several such subsequent delegations build a chain <b>of</b> <b>certificates.</b> Chains <b>of</b> delegation <b>certificates</b> can improve the capability and manageability of systems. Distributed group membership management, i. e. managing groups of users in a distributed environment, utilizes the efficiency <b>of</b> <b>certificate</b> chains. Adding, removing as well as authentication of users is managed by chains <b>of</b> delegation <b>certificates.</b> On the other hand, the size <b>of</b> <b>certificate</b> chains could be too long to be usable. In this paper {{we take a look at}} distributed group membership management based on delegation certificates. Then we present a new kind <b>of</b> <b>certificate,</b> the implanted chain certificate, and its characteristics. With this new kind <b>of</b> <b>certificate</b> the verification time <b>of</b> a <b>certificate</b> chain can be decreased without losing delegation information. Finally, we compare our verification method to reduce the time of verification...|$|R
