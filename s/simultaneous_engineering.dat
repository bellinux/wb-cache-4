40|$|We {{understand}} {{a great deal}} about the organization and management of new product development in the manufacturing sector, but we know relatively little about how applicable this research and practice is to the service sector. In this paper we introduce and test a framework for managing new product development in services. This framework is derived and tested by analyzing 108 service firms in a combined US and UK dataset, and then each national sub-sample separately. Our results generally support the predictive capability of the framework, and suggest that the development strategy, processes, organization and tools derived from manufacturing, specially those of concurrent engineering, are applicable to services.

Up to now, only little focus has been given to methods and tools for rapid prototyping VR software and modeling virtual objects. Most VR applications are developed by modeling the needed objects on conventional CAD systems first, then by programming their functions and behavior using low-level graphics libraries or high level simulation packages.

50|$|Concurrent {{engineering}} (British English: <b>simultaneous</b> <b>engineering)</b> is a workflow that, {{instead of}} working sequentially through stages, carries {{out a number of}} tasks in parallel. For example: starting tool design as soon as the detailed design has started, and before the detailed designs of the product are finished; or starting on detail design solid models before the concept design surfaces models are complete. Although this does not necessarily reduce the amount of manpower required for a project, as more changes are required due to the incomplete and changing information, it does drastically reduce lead times and thus time to market.|$|E
5000|$|Design of {{the chassis}} {{began in the}} late 1980s, after Chrysler had bought American Motors Corporation (AMC) in 1987. During this time, Chrysler began {{designing}} the replacement for the then-new Dodge Dynasty, which was a mid-size car. Initial proposals bore resemblance to the Dynasty, but this design approach was scrapped entirely in 1988 by François Castaing, the former AMC Vice President of product engineering and development. As AMC was purchased by Chrysler, Castaing became new Vice President for Vehicle Engineering for the new company. The acquiring automaker was in desperate need to replicate the AMC and Renault corporate culture where work was conducted in an atmosphere [...] "of constant change". Castaing organized Chrysler's departments into AMC-style cross-function teams, as well as incorporated the use of <b>simultaneous</b> <b>engineering.</b> Moreover, the new vehicle's design, under Castaing's leadership, began with the Eagle Premier platform.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Hexose and pentose {{cofermentation}} {{is regarded}} as one of the chief obstacles impeding economical conversion of lignocellulosic biomass to biofuels. Over time, successful application of traditional metabolic engineering strategy has produced yeast strains capable of utilizing the pentose sugars (especially xylose and arabinose) as sole carbon sources, yet major difficulties still remain for <b>engineering</b> <b>simultaneous,</b> exogenous sugar metabolism. Beyond catabolic pathways, the focus must shift towards non-traditional aspects of cellular engineering such as host molecular transport capability, catabolite sensing and stress response mechanisms. This review highlights the need for an approach termed 'panmetabolic engineering', a new paradigm for integrating new carbon sources into host metabolic pathways. This approach will concurrently optimize the interdependent processes of transport and metabolism using novel combinatorial techniques and global cellular engineering. As a result, panmetabolic engineering is a whole pathway approach emphasizing better pathways, reduced glucose-induced repression and increased product tolerance. In this paper, recent publications are reviewed in light of this approach and their potential to expand metabolic engineering tools. Collectively, traditional approaches and panmetabolic engineering enable the reprogramming of extant biological complexity and incorporation of exogenous carbon catabolism. </p...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn {{the design}} process of {{intelligent}} technical systems, <b>simultaneous</b> and concurrent <b>engineering</b> is generally encouraged on the one hand, while {{on the other hand}} cooperation and coordination of the involved disciplines is required. In multidisciplinary system development, 1) a common understanding of the objective is of vital importance for the system's success and 2) the combined artifacts of the different disciplines need to be analyzed before the system is built. In this paper, we address these issues and present an approach for an integrated model-based design process, which facilitates the use of solution and system knowledge and reduces the huge effort for building and maintaining the required simulation models. To illustrate this, we use the application example of two cooperating delta robots. The system knowledge constitutes the basis for concurrent design in the involved disciplines, all of which provide and expand certain aspects. To analyze the domain-specific dynamic behavior of the subsystems and their components, multiple dynamic behavior models are developed in different levels of detail and domains. However, in order to analyze the complex interactions and dependencies between them, integrated models of the whole system are needed, which fit the varying modeling objectives and analysis goals. Certainly, the manual process of building up such models and maintaining consistency between all the artifacts entails great effort. To improve this, we present the concept of a Multifunctional Model Client (MMC) ...|$|R

We investigated the ability of human BMSCs to differentiate toward both SMCs and urothelium with cocultured or conditioned media and analyzed growth factors from a coculture system. After being cocultured with urothelium or cultured using urothelium-derived conditioned medium, human BMSCs expressed urothelium-specific genes and proteins: uroplakin-Ia, cytokeratin- 7, and cytokeratin- 13. When cocultured with SMCs or cultured in SMC-conditioned medium, human BMSCs expressed SMC-specific genes and proteins: desmin and myosin. Several growth factors (hepatocyte growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor-homodimer polypeptide of B chain (BB), transforming growth factor-? 1, and vascular endothelial growth factor) were detected in the SMC cocultured media and in the urothelium cocultured media (epidermal growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor-BB, transforming growth factor-? 1, and vascular endothelial growth factor). BMSC?scaffold constructs significantly improved cell contractility after myogenic differentiation. In vivo-grafted cells displayed significant matrix infiltration and expressed SMC-specific markers in the nanofibrous poly-l-lactic acid scaffolds. In conclusion, smooth muscle- and urothelium-like cells derived from human BMSCs provide an alternative cell source for potential use in bladder tissue engineering...|$|R

5000|$|Design for lean {{manufacturing}} {{is based on}} the premise that product and process design is an ongoing activity and not a one-time activity; therefore design for {{lean manufacturing}} should be viewed as a long term strategy for an organization. [...] Design for lean manufacturing must be sustainable and holistic unlike other lean manufacturing or Six Sigma approaches that either tackle only a part of the problem or tackle the problem for a short period of time. Design for lean manufacturing also relates to system thinking as it considers all aspects (or the full circle) and takes the system conditions into consideration when designing products and services, delivering them according to customer needs. ® (Munro & Associates) drives prevention of waste by adopting a systematic process to improve the design phase during development. An organizational focus is required for the implementation of Lean Design ® principles, which includes efficient and sustainable design team. Initial studies of the Japanese approach to design for lean manufacturing noted four principles; leadership of projects by a shusa (or project boss), tightly knit teams, communication on all of the difficult design trade-offs, and <b>simultaneous</b> development between <b>engineering</b> and manufacturing. Further study showed additional depth to the principles, citing 13 principles specific to the Toyota design for lean manufacturing methods in product and process development in the areas of process, skilled people, and tools and technology.

The methods of <b>Simultaneous</b> and Concurrent <b>Engineering</b> tried to integrate the downstream production planning into the trend-Setting development process. To support this integration, approaches of Process Modeling and Business Process Reengineering are applied for analyzing and evaluating existing business processes in an enterprise. In order to secure a reliable and well synchronized business process flow, the following definition and optimization of business processes has to be implemented by experts having acquired experiences in development and production. Many Business Process Reengineering Projects have failed, because the usually applied top-down approach {{did not succeed in}} defining practicable process models and therefore was not accepted by the operative people. At Fraunhofer-Institute for Industrial Engineering (IAO) a top-down / bottom-up methodology has been developed for the definition of company and project specific business processes, which is supported by a module based expert system.

40|$|To {{increase}} {{transient expression}} of recombinant proteins in Chinese hamster ovary cells, we have engineered their protein synthetic capacity by directed manipulation of mRNA translation initiation. To control this process we constructed a nonphosphorylatable Ser 51 Ala site-directed mutant of eIF 2, a subunit of the trimeric eIF 2 complex that is implicated in {{regulation of the}} global rate of mRNA translation initiation in eukaryotic cells. Phosphorylation of eIF 2 by protein kinases inhibits eIF 2 activity and is known to increase as cells perceive a range of stress conditions. Using single-and dual-gene plasmids introduced into CHO cells by electroporation, we found that transient expression of the eIF 2 Ser 51 Ala mutant with firefly luciferase resulted in a 3 -fold increase in reporter activity, relative to cells transfected with reporter only. This effect was maintained in transfected cells for at least 48 h after transfection. Expression of the wild-type eIF 2 protein had no such effect. Elevated luciferase activity {{was associated with a}} reduction in the level of eIF 2 phosphorylation in cells transfected with the mutant eIF 2 construct. Transfection of CHO cells with the luciferase-only construct resulted in a marked decrease in the global rate of protein synthesis in the whole cell population 6 h post-transfection. However, expression of the mutant Ser 51 Ala or wild-type eIF 2 proteins restored the rate of protein synthesis in transfected cells to a level equivalent to or exceeding that of control cells. Associated with this, entry of plasmid DNA into cells during electroporation was visualized by confocal microscopy using a rhodamine-labeled plasmid construct expressing green fluorescent protein. Six hours after transfection, plasmid DNA was present in all cells, albeit to a variable extent. These data suggest that entry of naked DNA into the cell itself functions to inhibit protein synthesis by signaling mechanisms affecting control of mRNA translation by eIF 2. This work therefore forms the basis of a rational strategy to generically up-regulate transient expression of recombinant proteins by <b>simultaneous</b> host cell <b>engineering...</b>|$|R
