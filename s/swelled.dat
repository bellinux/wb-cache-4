5|$|New arrivals {{consisting}} of Jordanians {{from the north}} and south of the country and immigrants from Palestine had increased the city's population from 30,000 in 1930 to 60,000 in 1947. About 10,000 Palestinians, mostly from Safad, Haifa and Acre, migrated to the city for economic opportunities before the 1948 war. Many of the immigrants from al-Salt from that time were originally from Nablus. The 1948 war caused an exodus of urban Muslim and Christian Palestinian refugees, mostly from Jaffa, Ramla and Lydda, to Amman, whose population <b>swelled</b> to 110,000. With Jordan's capture of the West Bank during the war, many Palestinians from that area steadily migrated to Amman between 1950 and 1966, before another mass wave of Palestinian refugees from the West Bank moved to the city during the 1967 War. By 1970, the population had <b>swelled</b> to an estimated 550,000. A further 200,000 Palestinians arrived after their expulsion from Kuwait during the 1991 Gulf War. Several large Palestinian refugee camps exist around the centre of Amman.|$|E

40|$|Over the ocean, the {{atmospheric}} turbulence can be significantly affected by <b>swell</b> waves. Change in {{the atmospheric}} turbulence affects the wind stress and atmospheric mixing over <b>swell</b> waves. In this study, {{the influence of}} <b>swell</b> on atmospheric mixing and wind stress is introduced into an atmosphere-wave-coupled regional climate model, separately and combined. The <b>swell</b> influence on atmospheric mixing is introduced into the atmospheric mixing length formula by adding a swell-induced contribution to the mixing. The <b>swell</b> influence on the wind stress under wind-following <b>swell,</b> moderate-range wind, and near-neutral and unstable stratification conditions is introduced by changing the roughness length. Five year simulation results indicate that adding the <b>swell</b> influence on atmospheric mixing has limited influence, only slightly increasing the near-surface wind speed; in contrast, adding the <b>swell</b> influence on wind stress reduces the near-surface wind speed. Introducing the wave influence roughness length has a larger influence than does adding the <b>swell</b> influence on mixing. Compared with measurements, adding the <b>swell</b> influence on both atmospheric mixing and wind stress gives the best model performance for the wind speed. The influence varies with wave characteristics for different sea basins. <b>Swell</b> occurs infrequently in the studied area, and one could expect more influence in high-swell-frequency areas (i. e., low-latitude ocean). We conclude that the influence of <b>swell</b> on atmospheric mixing and wind stress should be considered when developing climate models...|$|R
5|$|Avery Brundage, as {{president}} of the IOC from 1952 to 1972, rejected all attempts to link the Olympics with commercial interests as he felt that the Olympic movement should be completely separate from financial influence. The 1960 Winter Olympics marked the beginning of corporate sponsorship of the Games. Despite Brundage's strenuous resistance the commercialisation of the Games continued during the 1960s, and revenue generated by corporate sponsorship <b>swelled</b> the IOC's coffers. By the Grenoble Games, Brundage had become so concerned about the direction of the Winter Olympic Games towards commercialisation that, if it could not be corrected, he felt the Winter Olympics should be abolished. Brundage's resistance to this revenue stream meant that the IOC was unable to gain a share of the financial windfall that was coming to host cities, and had no control over the structuring of sponsorship deals. When Brundage retired the IOC had $2million in assets; eight years later its accounts had <b>swelled</b> to $45million. This was due to a shift in ideology among IOC members, towards expansion of the Games through corporate sponsorship and the sale of television rights.|$|E

(Ocean Dyn 64 : 1447 - 1456, 2014), this article presents significant waveheights of <b>swell</b> inverted from a 13 month dataset of two high-frequency (HF) phased array radars. As an important intermediate variable in the calculation of significant waveheights, relative <b>swell</b> directions obtained by two different methods from a single radar station are also presented. The impact of the inaccuracy of relative <b>swell</b> direction on the calculation of waveheight is investigated and an alternative way of using constant <b>swell</b> direction is proposed. Radar-inverted <b>swell</b> significant waveheights using different ranges of relative <b>swell</b> directions are investigated. Results are assessed by WAVEWATCH III model hind casts. Analysis of the complete database shows that radar-inverted <b>swell</b> significant waveheights agree reasonably well with model estimates with large scatter. Standard deviation {{of the difference between}} the two estimations increases with waveheight, whereas the relative standard deviation, normalized by waveheight, keeps nearly constant. The constant direction scheme of waveheight inversion gives good estimations except for energetic <b>swell</b> exceeding the small perturbation assumption. Statistical analysis suggests that radar measurement uncertainty explains a considerable part of the difference between radar and model estimates. <b>Swell</b> estimates from both radar stations are consistent. This enables combined use of both radar spectra at common radar cells. Use of double spectra solves the ambiguity of relative <b>swell</b> direction, i. e., absolute <b>swell</b> direction is obtained, and effectively improves the accuracy of <b>swell</b> direction by the least-squares method...|$|R
