[...] SHMC operates the sears.com and kmart.com retail websites for Sears Holdings Corporation. As part <b>of</b> a marketing <b>effort,</b> <b>some</b> <b>users</b> <b>of</b> sears.com and kmart.com were invited to download an application developed for SHMC that ran in the background on users’ computers collecting information on nearly all internet activity. The tracking aspects of the program were only disclosed in legalese in the middle <b>of</b> the End <b>User</b> License Agreement. The FTC found this was insufficient disclosure given consumers expectations and the detailed information being collected. On September 9, 2009 the FTC approved a consent decree with SHMC requiring full disclosure of its activities and destruction of previously obtained information.|$|R

We review the main issues of current CCBR models and their specific solutions. We describe afterwards how these solutions may be integrated in a common methodology to be reused in other similar CCBR systems. We particularly focus on the authoring issues to represent the knowledge. ...|$|R

50|$|Technology {{appropriation}} can {{be perceived}} as a type of social hacking in that it involves social manipulation of a technology.

Adaptation of a technology can incorporate reinterpretation of its function and meaning, to the effect that the technology itself can take on a new role. Appropriation accentuates that the user adjusts the technology for his own best practice, while adaptation advises that the use sometimes changes in general.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — As {{electronic}} home appliances become smart, {{there have been}} many attempts to connect these appliances with a network. Accordingly, a concept of home networks has been emerged. Since most home network users do not have experiences or knowledge of network management, home networks have to be easily managed with minimal <b>efforts</b> <b>of</b> <b>users.</b> This paper presents a novel system for topology discovery and management in home networks. This system is fully distributed and automatically discovers topology information with minimal user configuration. It considers heterogeneous network media such as Ethernet, WLAN, and IEEE 1394. It also provides QoS information by measuring available bandwidth. We have implemented this system on Linux and present experiment results to show the effectiveness of the system 1. 1...|$|R
