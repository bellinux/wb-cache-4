40|$|AbstractTo {{satisfy the}} {{increasing}} demand for parts in optical quality {{it is necessary to}} reduce the processing time, e. g. by ultra precision high performance cutting (UP-HPC). One aspect of UP-HPC is the increase of the spindle speed. High speed spindles require a well balanced spindle rotor to enable the machining of optical surfaces. With conventional speed spindles the unbalance is detected by measuring vibrations at the <b>spindle</b> <b>housing.</b> Thus, the unbalance excited vibrations propagate from the rotor through the air bearings to the <b>spindle</b> <b>housing.</b> In order to calculate the angular position and the magnitude of the unbalance from these measurements the dynamic properties of the air bearings and the housing as well must be known. In this paper the dynamic properties of an ultra precision spindle at different speeds are investigated by means of experimental impact tests. It is shown that the tested air bearing provides a good transfer behavior only in the higher frequency range above 200 Hz and that the <b>spindle</b> <b>housing</b> is not the preferable location to measure the rotor unbalance...|$|E

This study also discusses {{the effect of}} the sensor installations, selected features, and the bandwidth size of the features on the classification rate. To collect the vibration signals necessary for training the system model and verifying the system, an experiment was implemented on a micro-milling research platform along with a 700 μm diameter micro-end mill and a SK 2 workpiece. A three-axis accelerometer was installed on a sensor plate attached to the <b>spindle</b> <b>housing</b> to collect vibration signals in three directions during cutting. The frequency domain features representing changes in tool wear were selected based on the class mean scatter criteria after transforming signals from the time domain to the frequency domain by fast Fourier transform.

Results show that proper feature extraction for classification provides a better solution than applying all spectral features into the classifier. Selecting five features for classification provides a better classification rate than the case with four and three features along with the 30 Hz bandwidth size of the spectral feature. Moreover, combining the signals for tool condition from both direction signals provides a better classification rate than determining the tool condition using a one-direction single sensor...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe magnetoresistive (MR) sensing {{principle}} {{was first}} applied industrially in the read-heads of hard disc drives. However, {{in the past}} decade the MR effect has also been used successfully for sensors to measure position, current and magnetic fields. MR sensors offer a number of benefits compared to other technologies used for condition monitoring of machine spindles. They are more compact and offer a higher bandwidth than inductive or capacitive sensors. They are more robust than optical encoders, being largely insusceptible to oil, water and other contaminants [1]. MR sensors can be applied over a wider temperature range and with less demanding assembly tolerances. This makes them particularly well suited to applications with limited available space and demanding operating conditions, {{as is often the case}} in machine tool sensing applications. This paper explains the basics of magnetoresistive sensor technology and outlines the advantages compared to other sensor principles. Furthermore the results of a joint R&D project between Sensitec GmbH and the PTW Institute of the Technical University Darmstadt, funded by the Arbeitsgemeinschaft industrieller Forschungsvereinigungen “Otto von Guericke e. V. (AiF), to investigate the application of MR sensors to the condition monitoring of high-frequency air spindles will be described [2]. Position sensors based on the giant magnetoresistive (GMR) effect have been specially adapted to measure directly the radial and axial displacement of the spindle shaft. Importantly only minor modifications have been made to the spindle shaft to enable this measurement and the sensors are completely integrated within the <b>spindle</b> <b>housing.</b> Tests demonstrate that this solution can resolve axial and radial displacements of less than 0. 5 μm with high repeatability under typical operating conditions...|$|E

40|$|Magnetically levitated {{spindles}} {{have been}} considered for high-speed high-precision machining. These systems eliminate contact between the <b>spindle</b> and <b>housing</b> by replacing traditional bearings with rings of electromagnets which levitate the spindle in their center. Levitated spindles may be spun much faster than conventional ones; and with greater precision and longer median time to failure. Furthermore, the close coupling between the spindle dynamics and the cutting process allows for monitoring of cutting force {{which can be used}} to infer tool wear and part quality. Magnetic levitation systems are inherently unstable and require some form of feedback control. Challenges for the control system include robust stability, precise positioning of the spindle, and rejection of disturbances caused by rotor imbalance and the cutting process.

40|$|Proper {{configurations}} of controls, sensors, and metrology technologies have enabled precision turning machines to achieve nanometer positioning. However, {{at this level}} of positioning resolution, vibration sources can become a limiting factor. One of the largest sources of vibration in a turning machine may be an unbalanced rotating spindle. In this paper, a system is implemented to actively cancel spindle unbalance forces. Specifically, to attenuate the <b>spindle</b> <b>housing</b> vibration using an active vibration control system to prevent the unbalance force from disturbing {{the rest of the}} machine systems e. g., the slide servo system or the machine metrology frame. The system controls three degrees of motion. An unbalanced spindle creates a rotating force vector with a once per revolution period. The cause and size of this force {{is a function of the}} spindle, the part, the part fixturing, the part setup and the spindle speed. In addition, certain spindle speeds coupled with the size of the unbalance force may contain other harmonics that can excite machine structural resonances. The magnitude of the unbalance force increases as the square of the spindle speed. The control algorithm of this system is fully implemented on a commercially available machine tool controller and is sensitive only to unbalance induced motion. The paper describes in detail the control algorithm and how it is implemented. The system has demonstrated the ability to adapt in real time to remove the fundamental component of the unbalance force to nanometer levels. However, higher-order structural resonance components of the test bed have been observed when the system is active. The control system is stable and the voice coil (VC) excitation is harmonically clean but the high Q of the mechanical test system is apparently excited by energy leakage. Our results indicate the need to carefully examine the dynamics of any spindle system that would take advantage of this active system...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1999 Monitoring, {{diagnosis}} and prediction of failures play key roles in automatic supervision of machine tools. They have received much attention {{because of the}} potential for reduced maintenance expenses, down time, and an increase in the equipment utilization level. At present, signal analysis techniques are predominantly used. But methods involving system analysis are capable of providing more reliable information, especially for predictive applications of supervision. System analysis involves comprehensive analytical models combined with techniques developed in control theory, and experimental modal analysis. The primary objective of this research is to develop a methodology to monitor critical physical parameters of mechanical systems, which are difficult to measure directly. These parameters are inherent features of constitutive rigid body models. A method for computer aided model generation developed in this thesis leads to a gray box model structure by which physical parameters can be estimated from experimental data. Lagrange's energy formalism, linear algebra and homogenous transformations are used to promote parsimonious three-dimensional model building. A software environment allowing symbolic and arbitrary precision computations facilitates efficient mapping of physical properties of the actual system into specific quantities of the analytical model. Six different methods are postulated and analyzed in this thesis to estimate physical parameters such as masses, stiffnesses and damping coefficients. Implementation of this methodology is a prerequisite for the design of an on-line monitoring and diagnosis system, which can detect and predict process faults. Two mechanical systems are used to validate the proposed methods: (1) A simple multi degree-of-freedom (MDOF) system and (2) a machine tool spindle assembly. A practical application of physical parameter estimation is proposed for preload monitoring in high-speed spindles. Preload variations in the bearing can lead to thermal instability and bearing seizure. The feasibility of using accelerometers located on the <b>spindle</b> <b>housing</b> to estimate bearing preload is evaluated. The optimal environment for continuation of this research is collaboration with machine tool companies to incorporate the proposed methodology (or parts of it) into current design practices...|$|E
40|$|Smart adaptronic Elements for Active Vibration ControlThe induced {{vibrations}} of the high-precision machine {{limit the}} achievable required accuracy, such that constrain the performance {{improvement of the}} machine specifications. The main goal {{in the design of}} high precision machines is to enhance the accuracy while increasing productivity. These two design parameters are negatively coupled, as increasing the machine dynamics leads to more induced vibrations, especially with light structure machines. The induced vibrations will limit both the productivity and the accuracy of the machine. Within the scope of this thesis the main motivated question was Could we improve the performance parameters like: precision, accuracy, productivity, and process stability; by design and produce smart adaptronic modules that will be integrated in a modular way within the high precision machines?, This main question has been split to three main tasks (motivated questions to be answered) during the different research activities: 1. When to use active vibration compensation adaptronic modules? 2. How to design the active vibration compensation adaptronic modules? And, 3. How to use the active adaptronic modules? The development of such adaptronic elements is not an easy task, as it requires an extensive knowledge for a number of different scientific fields, which will be discussed at the beginning, followed by a suggested design methodology to develop the adaptronic element. This design methodology is a series of integrated mechatronic concurrent design processes, which will be applied through the different chapters of this thesis. This design approach consists of three main concurrent design phases:· Identification of the adaptronic design problem. · Integrated design of the adaptronic elements within the mechatronic system. · Adaptronic concept validation. As a real practical applications for the different research activities in this thesis, two prototypes of developed adaptronic modules for active vibration compensation will be presented, namely the active 3 DOF stiffness element A 3 DSE (patent no. WO 2011 / 041858 A 2), and the adaptronic smart platform (European project HARCO (FP 7 - 2010 -NMP-ICT-FoF). The first prototype A 3 DSE module is ideally suited for implementing active vibration compensation in the mechanical structure of machine elements, especially struts, that are subjected to axial or/and bending disturbances. According to the used controller strategy, the A 3 DSE is an adaptronic device for active disturbance-rejection and active vibration-damping applications. The design idea of the A 3 DSE is based on the incorporation of three piezoelectric displacement actuators, each equipped with a collocated piezoelectric force sensor, which are assembled in an axisymmetrical configuration within a mechanical holding structure, using suitable mechanical and electronic interfaces. The second module is the adaptronic platform, which has been designed as an adaptronic modular interface between the <b>spindle</b> <b>housing</b> and the machine frame of high-precision milling machine FIDIA DL 155, to compensate the vibrations of the cutting tool, to improve the workpiece final surface quality and to reduce the lead time. The working principle is similar to the A 3 DSE, and is based on the incorporation of three powerful high voltage piezoelectric displacement actuators, each equipped with a collocated, piezoelectric force sensor in preloaded units, which are distributed in axisymmetrical configuration to connect the movable and the fixed flanges of milling machines spindle. The two developed prototypes will be experimentally tested, using suitable developed test benches, besides testing the first prototype of the adaptronic smart platform on the real high precision milling machine FIDIA DL 155. Active feedback control technique will be implemented in simple straightforward way to present it as an industrial product in the future work. For the A 3 DSE; the results proved the capability of compensating the axial and bending vibration of the active struts where the A 3 DSE module is integrated in. The dimension and maximum stroke of the used piezoelectric actuators represent the most important factors which determine the range of the compensated vibrations. The adaptronic smart platform module has been tested within developed test bench; the used control strategy depends on two different types of possible feedback measured signal. Firstly, using the collocated force feedback signals from the piezoelectric force sensors integrated in the actuating unit with the three piezoelectric actuators. Secondly, using the acceleration feedback signals from three accelerometers collocated with the three actuating units. The experimental results revealed that the two tilting modes could be successfully damped, and the stiffness at the low frequency range has been improved. The first prototype of the adaptronic smart platform has been mounted on the real FIDIA DL 155 high precision milling machine at the workshop of FIDIA s. p. a., San Mauro Torinese, Italy. The preliminary test results succeeded to compensate the tool-tip vibrations over a wide range of rotating speeds, up to 60 % tool tip vibration suppression. For future work, this research {{is considered to be a}} road map covers the full path from identification to controller synthesis and validation, where provided an integrated mechatronic design approach for adaptronic modules. This integrated approach includes: the identification of the adaptronic design problem, the integration of the adaptronic modules within the mechatronic system, and the adaptronic concept validation. It is general methodology which is suitable to apply for different adaptronic modules depend on the case study. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Our {{knowledge}} of cell cycle regulatory mechanisms in apicomplexan parasites is very limited. In this study, we describe a novel Toxoplasma gondii factor {{that has a}} vital role in chromosome replication and the regulation of cytoplasmic and nuclear mitotic structures, and we named this factor ECR 1 for essential for chromosome replication 1. ECR 1 was discovered by complementation of a temperature-sensitive (ts) mutant that suffers lethal, uncontrolled chromosome replication at 40 °C similar to a ts mutant carrying a defect in topoisomerase. ECR 1 is a 52 -kDa protein containing divergent RING and TRAF-Sina-like zinc binding domains that are dynamically expressed in the tachyzoite cell cycle. ECR 1 first appears in the unique spindle compartment of the Apicomplexa (centrocone) of the nuclear envelope in early S phase and then in the nucleus in late S phase where it reaches maximum expression. Following nuclear division, but before daughter parasites separate from the mother parasite, ECR 1 is downregulated and is absent in new daughter parasites. The proteomics of ECR 1 identified interactions with the ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation machinery and the minichromosome maintenance complex, and the loss of ECR 1 led to increased stability of a key member of this complex, MCM 2. ECR 1 also forms a stable complex with the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) -related kinase, T. gondii Crk 5 (TgCrk 5), which displays a similar cell cycle expression and localization during tachyzoite replication. Importantly, the localization of ECR 1 /TgCrk 5 in the centrocone indicates that this Apicomplexa-specific <b>spindle</b> compartment <b>houses</b> important regulatory factors that control the parasite cell cycle...|$|R

50|$|The factory {{was opened}} in June 1840 {{and this was}} marked by a great Temperance Tea for the firm's 2,600 workers. Six months later {{machinery}} had been installed and the mill began production. The adjoining office building was completed a few years later. The new buildings did not extend as planned to Sweet Street. It was only half the size James Marshall had forecast and had only half the <b>spindles</b> it could <b>house.</b> All the extra yarn produced was turned into thread, and no cloth was ever woven, as had been planned. The {{reason for this is}} the slump in the demand for and the price of finished products in the 1840s. Everybody in the flax spinning industry expected boom to follow slump, but it never did. Leeds flax spinners lost their competitive edge due to the free trade in machinery and could not compete with those in Ireland, France and Belgium. The demand for linen was drastically reduced due to substitution with cotton. Furthermore, a creeping managerial paralysis set in within the Marshall family, virtually all of whom moved away from Leeds. It has been said that the third generation of Marshalls actually despised the business, whereas their fathers had merely neglected it. The day to day control of Temple Mill passed to the manager John Richardson who had been with the firm since the 1820s.

40|$|Advances in {{high-speed}} machining create {{the need to}} model spindle-bearing performance at high rates of rotation and under operating conditions. Spindle analysis, design, and control requires a complex representation {{of the dynamics of}} stepped shafts rotating at high speeds and supported by flexible nonlinear bearings. Previous spindle-bearing models simplify either the spindle or bearing dynamics to the extent of prohibiting a detailed analysis of a spindle operating at high speeds. A complete model should include a dynamic analysis of rotating bearings coupled to a comprehensive spindle model, including thermal growth in both the spindle and bearing. Thermal expansion can degrade spindle-bearing performance and life, while centrifugal loading in the bearing can cause stiffness softening. This work presents a coupled system of spindle and bearing dynamic models including a comprehensive thermal model. The angular contact ball bearing model is coupled to a spindle model based on the influence-coefficient method using lumped masses with Timoshenko beam theory. Full coupling of the loads, deflections, and thermal parameters occur between the bearing and spindle. This approach overcomes limitations on bearing reactions or spindle geometry of previous models. The thermal model is a quasi-three dimensional model for thermal equilibrium between the <b>spindle,</b> bearing, and <b>housing</b> including, heat generated in the bearings, the motor, and at the cutting surface. The spindle-bearings model also allows applied static loads to be superimposed on the dynamic excitation, showing the influence of the cutting load on non-linear bearings. Based on this model, a modular computer program has been developed which allows easy modeling of a spindle system with different cutters, loading, and other operational parameters. The computer model is both rapid and robust, and shows good agreement with experimental analysis. This model can be used to aid in spindle design, machining process design, and selection of optimal operating conditions. ...|$|R
