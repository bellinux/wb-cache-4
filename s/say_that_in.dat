25|$|Some {{archaeologists and}} historians, most notably, {{until his death}} in 1986, Finley, {{maintain}} that none of the events in Homer's works are historical.

25|$|Even in curved space, Minkowski {{space is}} still a good {{description}} in an infinitesimal region surrounding any point (barring gravitational singularities).

Thus, the structure of Minkowski space is still essential {{in the description of}} general relativity.|$|E

However, nearly 62% of investors say {{illegal immigration is}} hurting the investment climate. 68% of investors say that illegal immigrants cost taxpayers too much because they use government services like public education and medical services, while 25% <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> the long run, illegal immigrants become productive citizens who come to make up paying {{their fair share of}} taxes. About 80% thought that the government should do more to curb illegal immigration.|$|E
25|$|With {{the goal}} of {{developing}} amateur art within {{the ranks of the}} army and to encourage soldiers' interest in good music, the ensemble grew to 300 performers by 1933, comprising three different forces of a male choir, an orchestra, and an ensemble of dancers. Some sources <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> 1933 there were 19 members; in 1935 there were 135 and in August 1937 in Paris and Prague they were 150. The Red Army Choir became known as a propagator of Soviet songs, performing original compositions by composers such as Vasily Solovyov-Sedoy, Anatoli Novikov, Matvey Blanter and Boris Mokrousov.|$|E
25|$|Other {{scholars}} say that Vrhbosna {{was a major}} town located in the wider area of modern-day Sarajevo. Papal documents <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> 1238, a cathedral dedicated to Saint Paul {{was built in the}} area. Disciples of the notable saints Cyril and Methodius stopped in the region, founding a church near Vrelo Bosna. Whether or not the town was located somewhere in the area of modern-day Sarajevo, the documents attest to its and the region's importance. There was also a citadel Hodidjed north-east to Old City, dating from around 1263 until it was occupied by the Ottoman Empire in 1429.|$|E

25|$|Many Jews were {{deported}} to Transnistria from Bessarabia and Bukovina. During the period 19411944, 200,000 Romani people and Jews became {{victims of the}} Romanian occupation of Transnistria. Not being Romanian territory, Transnistria {{was used as a}} killing field for the extermination of Jews. Survivors <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> comparison with the Holocaust of Nazi Germany, where deportations were carefully planned, the Romanian government did not prepare to house thousands of people in Transnistria, where the deportees stayed. The people were instead placed in crude barracks without running water, electricity or latrines. Those who could not walk were simply left to die.|$|E
25|$|It is {{difficult}} to estimate comparative exchange rates with modern currency because the range of products produced by economies of centuries gone by were different from today, which makes purchasing power parity (PPP) calculations very difficult; however, some historians and economists have estimated that in the 5th century BC a drachma had a rough value of 25 U.S. dollars (in the year 1990 – equivalent to 46.50 USD in 2015), whereas classical historians regularly <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> the heyday of ancient Greece (the fifth and fourth centuries) the daily wage for a skilled worker or a hoplite was one drachma, and for a heliast (juror) half a drachma since 425BC.|$|E
25|$|May we not <b>say</b> <b>that,</b> <b>in</b> the fortuitous {{combination}} of the productions of Nature, since only those creatures could survive in whose organizations {{a certain degree of}} adaptation was present, there is nothing extraordinary in the fact that such adaptation is actually found in all these species which now exist? Chance, one might say, turned out a vast number of individuals; a small proportion of these were organized in such a manner that the animals' organs could satisfy their needs. A much greater number showed neither adaptation nor order; these last have all perished.... Thus the species which we see today are but a small part of all those that a blind destiny has produced.|$|E

25|$|It is {{difficult}} to give even rough comparative values for money from before the 20th century, as the range of products and services available for purchase was different. Classical historians often <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> the late Roman Republic and early Roman Empire (~27BC) the daily wage for an unskilled laborer and common soldier was 1 denarius (with no tax deductions) or about US$2.8 in bread. During the republic (509–27 BC), legionary pay was 112.5 denarii per year (0.3/day), later doubled by Julius Caesar to 225 denarii (0.6/day), with soldiers having {{to pay for their}} own food and arms. Centurions received considerably higher pay; under Augustus, the lowest rank of centurion was paid 3,750 denarii and the highest rank, 15,000 denarii.|$|E
25|$|According to the temple's own records, Sugimoto-dera {{was founded}} in 734 by priest Gyōki on orders by Emperor Shōmu, and is {{therefore}} the oldest of Kamakura's temples, predating the shogunate by half a millennium. The records <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> the 8th century priest Gyōki was crossing the Kantō region on foot when he saw Kamakura from Mount Taizō (the Taizōzan in the temple's name) and decided to leave there a statue of goddess Kannon. He then carved and enshrined it himself. Later in 734, Emperor Shōmu {{was told by the}} goddess herself to build here a temple (the Hon-dō). Later, the temple was restored by Ennin (794–864), and Eshin Sōzu Genshin (942–1017) enshrined in it a statue of Eleven-faced Kannon, an event that made the temple surge to Number one of the Sanjusankasho pilgrimage circuit.|$|E
