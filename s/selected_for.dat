He played against France and Canada, losing both games. He only played four fifteen-aside games for Fiji in 1992 and 1993 – with Fiji losing all four. These results led to Fiji failing {{to qualify for the}} 1995 Rugby World Cup in South Africa. In 1996 Serevi was <b>selected</b> <b>for</b> his first Fiji game since 1993. The match was against Northland in Whangarei, and resulted in a 49–18 win; Serevi's first win with the national team since 1991.

5|$|At {{the start}} of the 195455 season, along with Neil, Ray was called into an Australian XI for a Test trial against Len Hutton’s touring English team, the closest that two Harveys came to playing in a Test for Australia together. Ray did not make an impact in the match, scoring only seven in his solitary innings, and was not <b>selected</b> <b>for</b> Australian duty. He came in at No. 4 after the {{dismissal}} of his brother. Ray was <b>selected</b> <b>for</b> all six of Victoria’s matches and played in all of these matches alongside Neil, as the domestic season was shortened and there were no scheduling clashes between the Tests and the domestic matches.
