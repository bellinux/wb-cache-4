In each sampling, plot presence, number, height, diameter at breast height (for trees) or root collar (for shrubs) and crown diameters were measured and recorded. Also, we recorded vegetation type according to the portion of species in the plot. Correlation analysis was conducted according to the <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> <b>variables</b> using Pierson, Spearman, Phi and Cramer and Eta coefficients. Results found that elevation {{is the most important}} factor affecting presence and density and also type in the study area. Altogether, Atlas Pistach (P. atlantica F. & M) and Wild Almond (A. scoparia Spach.) in low elevations and Maple (A. cinerascens L.), Marsh-arrow-grass (A. lycioedes Spach.) and mountain almond (A. elaefnifolia Spach.) in higher elevations had better conditions. Slope had a negative correlation with presence of Wild Almond and Send Cherry (Ephedra spp), and positive correlation with the presence of other species. Also, Wild Pistach trees present in southern aspects showed more basal area and volume in these aspects. Results of this research can be used in the detection of suitable points for development of plant species. Regression analysis showed that frequency of almond and Send Cherry and average height of almond and wild Pistach were predictable according to elevation and slope.

OBJECTIVES: The {{aim of this}} study was to establish reference intervals for echocardiographic indices of LA size and function in Warmblood horses and to provide proof of concept for allometric <b>scaling</b> <b>of</b> <b>variables</b> and for the clinical use of area-based indices. ANIMALS: Thirty-one healthy Warmblood horses and 91 Warmblood horses with a primary diagnosis of mitral regurgitation (MR) or aortic regurgitation (AR). METHODS: Retrospective study. Echocardiographic indices of LA size and function were measured and scaled to body weight (BWT). Reference intervals were calculated, the influence of BWT, age, and valvular regurgitation on LA size and function was investigated and agreement between different measurements of LA size was assessed. RESULTS: Allometric <b>scaling</b> <b>of</b> <b>variables</b> <b>of</b> LA size allowed for correction of differences in BWT. Indices of LA size documented LA enlargement with moderate and severe MR and AR, whereas most indices of LA mechanical function were not significantly altered by valvular regurgitation. Different indices of LA size were in fair to good agreement but still lead to discordant conclusions with regard to {{assessment of}} LA enlargement in individual horses. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Allometric <b>scaling</b> <b>of</b> echocardiographic <b>variables</b> <b>of</b> LA size is advised to correct for differences in BWT among Warmblood horses. Assessment of LA dimensions should be based on an integrative approach combining subjective evaluation and assessment of multiple measurements, including area-based variables.

In view of global institutions, macro-concepts of investment in health, is more surveillant on direct contribution of governments in providing people health. Health share of gross domestic product determines people health’s importance in politician’s mind of every country. Methods: This study is of descriptive-analytical type. Using data of 22 countries from Eastern Mediterranean region; due to years of 2000 to 2013, in SPSS software environment, version 23, regarding measurement’s <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> <b>variables</b> and their distribution modes by Pearson statistical correlation and Spearman and multivariate regression analysis; relations between health care expenditure share of gross domestic product and indexes such as women’s healthy life expectancy, ration of pregnant women’s death to total women’s death in child-bearing age and female’s death below five years old; has been investigated. Results: In this study, results approved strong correlation between total health care expenditure per capita with women’s healthy life expectancy, ration of pregnant women’s death to total women’s death in child-bearing age and female’s death below five years old. There wasn’t any meaningful correlation between health care expenditure share of gross domestic products with above mentioned variables. In regression analysis, there were relations between health care expenditure share of gross domestic products with mentioned variables. Conclusion: Huge expenditure and more investments in health always is not mean effectiveness and to find fraction that have most influence in improvement of limited government expenditure, is one of the requirement of developing countries. Financial health expenditure, at least in average global extents, with motion toward increase in providing costs via public budgets and getting politician’s opinion and government in health system of counties, more specific; toward conjunction points in society (women & kids) is essential.

40|$|Abstract: Scaling models {{predict how}} {{functional}} variables change as animals grow or increase in size evolutionarily. However, few experimental {{studies have found}} support for the predictions of these models. Here, we use a force plate to investigate the <b>scaling</b> <b>of</b> functional <b>variables</b> associated with jumping within (for three species) and across adults of 12 species of Anolis lizards. Both ontogenetically (with the exception of Anolis carolinensis) and across the 12 species examined, limb dimensions increased geometrically, making Anolis lizards an ideal study system to test the predictions <b>of</b> geometric <b>scaling</b> models. However, both the ontogenetic and interspecific <b>scaling</b> <b>of</b> functional <b>variables</b> deviated in several aspects from model predictions. Unexpectedly, the <b>scaling</b> <b>of</b> functional <b>variables</b> such as acceleration differed for different species. Whereas acceleration capacity increases with hindlimb length for A. carolinensis, no relationship was detected for the other two species. Interspecifically, the inclusion of two large species in our analysis appears to drive {{the absence of a}} correlation between acceleration capacity and hindlimb length across species. These data suggest that selection for enhanced jumping performance is relaxed in larger anoles and support the notion that no scaling model seems to be able to comprehensively predict changes in function with size across species; rather, natural selection seems to drive changes in the <b>scaling</b> relationships <b>of</b> some key <b>variables</b> such as force output or acceleration capacity...|$|R

Different measurement scales are studied in details and statistical comparison, modeling, and data mining methods are studied based upon using several medical examples.
