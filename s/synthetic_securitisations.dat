The expansion of asset types and cash The market may be under some pressure but it is responding extremely well flows being securitised and {{the increasing use of}} credit derivatives in <b>synthetic</b> <b>securitisations,</b> are strong indicators of a vibrant and innovative Australian market. In this issue we discuss a number of the challenges and suggest some solutions to those issues. The BDW Capital Markets and Securitisation team are involved in the Australian Securitisation Forum tax and regulatory committees looking at these issues and working with clients in the expanding CDO market (for example, by acting for UBS on its SPARC rated notes) and in securitising new asset types (through our role in acting for Macquarie on the Fosters ALE commercial mortgaged back securitisation).

40|$|This article explores whether {{proposed}} {{changes to the}} regulation of <b>synthetic</b> <b>securitisation</b> in Australia are sufficient {{in light of the}} Global Financial Crisis. <b>Synthetic</b> <b>securitisation</b> is specifically chosen as an object of study, given the relative ease with which it can be over-used. The article examines several theoretical problems with securitisation, which entice corporations into excessively risky behaviour. Contrary to popular belief, it is established that agency issues are not a serious problem with securitisation. Instead, managerial behavioural biases are shown to be most problematic. The article recommends stricter capital adequacy relief requirements, which would provide a disincentive for excessive risk-taking by potentially over-confident managers...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to critically analyse <b>synthetic</b> <b>securitisation</b> schemes in South African law as synthetic collateralised debt obligations using primarily credit default swaps (CDSs). This transpires {{from the perspective of}} primarily company law, and secondarily securities law and the law of contract. It includes a contextualised study of these schemes with regards to their origins, their significance regarding the recent financial crisis, and their rationales micro-economic influence and Basel capital requirements. Not only are the participants, such as parties acting in a primary role and secondary role and special-purpose institutions, studied, but also the obligations between these parties, such as the CDS contract, and the meaning of commercial paper, the legal nature of credit-linked notes, the business of a bank, and the influence of recent case law. It also includes a consideration of <b>synthetic</b> <b>securitisation</b> schemes in terms of the Collective Investment Schemes Control Act 45 of 2002. Furthermore, the role of systemic risk and moral hazard is explained, as well as the interaction between <b>synthetic</b> <b>securitisation</b> schemes, credit rating agencies and the function of risk management. The CDS is compared with insurance contracts, and a discussion of the 2014 International Swaps and Derivatives Association Credit Derivative Definitions is incorporated. For legal comparison, the South African model is compared with Canadian law and its unfunded credit derivatives in the light of recent regulation, and compared to German law and its prevalence of funded credit derivatives. Finally, suggestions are made as to the future of <b>synthetic</b> <b>securitisation</b> schemes. Thesis (LLD) [...] University of Pretoria, 2016. Mercantile LawLLDUnrestricte...|$|R
40|$|Alternative {{financing}} {{of small and}} medium-sized enterprises This thesis analyses whether the legal framework, both present and envisaged, regulating securitisation and crowdfunding is likely to improve the access of {{small and medium-sized enterprises}} to financing. The first chapter focuses on securitisation, with a particular focus on securitisation of SME loans. In doing so it evaluates the costs and benefits associated with securitisation, as well as securitised assets and the products of securitisation. The following part describes the mechanism of both a true sale and a <b>synthetic</b> <b>securitisation.</b> The key part of the chapter, however, deals with the legal framework regulating securitisation as well as each individual step of a securitisation transaction, and analyses several issues that may arise under Czech law in relation to securitisation. Next, the proposal for the securitisation regulation, which proposes criteria for qualified securitisations, is introduced. This chapter concludes with an evaluation of the said proposal and presents a level of scepticism as to its intended positive impact on SME financing. The second chapter deals with crowdfunding. After a general introduction into crowdfunding and its various business models, the rest of the chapter focuses on financial crowdfunding, i. e [...] . ...|$|R
40|$|The trust {{figure in}} South Africa has {{undergone}} an interesting process of evolution {{during the last}} century – from a mere gratuity or private tax evasion tool to a proper family protection, business entity, investment, and structured finance vehicle. Its flexibility and multi-functionality positioned the trust as an ideal legal institution for many innovative ideas {{in the search for}} holistic business structures, economic empowerment transactions, general estate planning and risk protection initiatives, and ultimately, its application as financial instrument and structured finance entity. The development of both traditional and <b>synthetic</b> <b>securitisation</b> schemes in South Africa has been investigated, with some emphasis on the application of the special purpose institution, which may be in trust form. It is submitted that the application of the trust figure has developed without any significant contribution from the local legislator. A sound legal and regulatory framework is crucial {{for the creation of a}} strong future environment for legal and financial vehicles. The question is, however, whether the current South African legal framework for the application of the business trust, and also as a vehicle for financial instruments, is adequately sound and robust in light of the standards set in the international business and financial environment. It is submitted that the hybrid nature of the South African legal landscape is conducive for the development of sound legal systems in an ever-changing legal and economic reality. It is further submitted that in the development of proper legal frameworks, South Africa should position itself particularly in its context as a Southern African developing democracy. The South African trust development is compared with that of some foreign jurisdictions as well as with international conventions and treaties of relevance. Some recommendations for necessary changes are made and it is submitted that such future development of the trust figure should not take place haphazardly, but within the context of a structured regulatory model...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{equity and}} debt securitisation in Germany {{and its implications}} for the property industry. Based on the current market environment the key drivers of change that will lead to an increase in equity and debt securitisation {{within the next five years}} are discussed. Furthermore, the crucial legal requirements and restrictions that will determine the future success of German real estate securitisation are identified. In terms of real estate investment, Germany is the biggest market in Europe. Nevertheless, the total securitised real estate equity has only been € 7 billion as of August 2005. It is broadly anticipated that the introduction of REITs in Germany will promote a fast expansion of the listed property sector. Particularly by eliminating the current tax disadvantages and by providing corporates and private equity investors with an attractive exit vehicle for their property portfolios. On the debt side, 70 % of all German real estate is funded through the use of traditional bank loans. Apart from <b>synthetic</b> debt <b>securitisation</b> structures and the German Pfandbrief market, which exceeds a volume of over € 1 trillion, international capital market instruments have not yet been established. However, recent changes in the German legal landscape have opened the door for true-sale securitisation deals. The advantages of true-sale transactions, such as higher LTVs, will determine the significant expected growth in the German real estate debt securitisation market. – 1...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{provides}} {{empirical evidence}} on the pricing of <b>synthetic</b> credit risk <b>securitisation.</b> Securitisation is advantageous both for originating banks, who incur savings on bank capital costs and for investors, who acquire a stake in leveraged credit portfolio risk, an exposure type rarely accessible otherwise. Securitisation is cost-efficiently implemented by structured credit derivatives, issued securities are therefore referred to as synthetic collateralised debt obligations (CDOs). We perform arbitrage-free pricing of synthetic CDOs referring to investment grade European corporate debt, such that a comparison with observed transactions can be drawn. CDO payout rules are formalised, taking both direct risk transfer structures and synthetic transactions using SPVs for excess spread trapping into account. Underlying losses are captured by a reduced-form affine multi-factor model, exploiting the strong observed comovement of corporate spreads for systematic factor estimation. Estimation is performed by Kalman filter-based QML, applied to implied spread structures of recent European corporate bond issues to which originating banks are exposed. Valuation results are obtained {{for a variety of}} structural variants. A comparison with transactions accommodating our modelling approach with regard to payout rules and reference debt quality supports the hypothesis that investors have a strong preference for CDO investments: Observed note issuance spreads provide no adequate compensation for the leveraged portfolio risk exposure.
