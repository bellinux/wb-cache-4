50|$|The {{memorial}} {{was constructed}} in 1902 by Owen Stroud and some African artisans who travelled from Fort Jameson (now Chipata) to do the job. The site was still marked by the clearing made by Codrington. Stroud built an obelisk around 6 m high from burnt brick plastered with <b>smooth</b> <b>cement,</b> and attached two brass plaques sent from London. (These were replaced around 1935 by spare copies, and in the 1950s by bronze replicas). Four brick and wooden posts with iron and wooden rails were set up around the base, replaced in the early 1950s by iron chains. When {{the top of the}} obelisk was damaged, after repairs a bronze cross was placed on top.|$|R
50|$|The facade which {{links the}} {{buildings}} is rendered in {{a combination of}} cream-coloured stucco and <b>smooth</b> <b>cement,</b> with vertical elements picked out in rose. It is designed to carefully articulate the hierarchy of and entrances to the three components of the civic centre. The Council Chambers is the primary feature of the facade, with a generous entrance recess with stepped surrounds surmounted by an elegantly proportioned clock tower which {{can be seen from}} most locations on Marshall Street. This links to the simple parapet of the adjacent shops, from which a metal awning is suspended. The shopfronts are decorated with mosaic tiles. The entrance to the auditorium is similar to but more modest than that of the Council chambers, and is located between the two eastern most shops.|$|R

40|$|The shear {{swirling}} flow vibration cementing (SSFVC) technique rotates the downhole eccentric cascade by circulating cementing fluid. It {{makes the}} casing eccentrically revolve {{at high speed}} around the borehole axis. It produces strong agitation action to the annulus fluid, makes it {{in the state of}} shear turbulent flow, and results in the formation of pulse pressure which affects the surrounding rock stress. This study was focused on 1) the calculation of the pulse pressure in an annular turbulent flow field based on the finite volume method, and 2) the analysis of the effect of pulse pressure on borehole stability. On the upside, the pulse pressure is conducive to enhancing the liquidity of the annulus fluid, reducing the fluid gel strength, and preventing the formation of fluid from channeling. But greater pulse pressure may cause lost circulation and even formation fracturing. Therefore, in order to ensure <b>smooth</b> <b>cementing</b> during SSFVC, the effect of pulse pressure should be considered when cementing design...|$|R

50|$|The Main Wing {{consists}} of a central bank of offices, meeting and consultation rooms with long corridors formed by enclosed verandahs running {{along the length of}} the eastern and western sides. The enclosed verandahs have early fabric visible including v-jointed boards and belt-rails to internal walls and ceilings, and pairs of panelled timber French-light doors with glazed fanlights above. The inside face of the external walls are finished with <b>smooth</b> <b>cement</b> render similar to the outside and the Maltese cross motif is also visible. On the eastern verandah early floorboards that have been painted are visible. On the western verandah the floor has been lined with a recent resilient floor finish. Generally, most internal walls within the office and consultation areas appear to be early and formed from v-jointed boards though many have been lined up to two metres from the floor with resilient finishes. Ceilings are early v-jointed boards. Door and window hardware and light fittings appear to be recent. Some glazing to the French-light doors has been painted.|$|R
40|$|The wall slip {{behaviour}} {{of a solid}} granular soap {{was investigated}} {{in the context of}} ram extrusion, with particular focus on determining the sensitivity of the wall shear stress to the pressure within the soap, as well as the slip velocity. Two novel slip measurement devices were used to infer the shear stress: a two stage extrusion die with inbuilt pressure gradient measurement; and a combined compression-translation assembly to measure the frictional force between the soap and the wall. Both devices provided differing measurements of the pressure sensitivity, and gave shear stress estimates in agreement with a Benbow and Bridgwater (1993) analysis of the extrusion behaviour, which cannot gauge pressure dependence. The influence of the wall material on the slip and extrusion behaviour was also investigated, using three geometrically identical extruders constructed from polycarbonate, stainless steel and tungsten carbide. There was found to be a non-negligible relationship between wall material, wall surface roughness, and the Benbow-Bridgwater extrusion parameters, in which the wall shear stress was greatest against the <b>smoothest,</b> <b>cemented</b> tungsten carbide wall in contrast to a rougher stainless steel and rougher-still polycarbonate wall.

40|$|Omnidirectional robots {{can move}} in all {{directions}} without steering their wheels and it can rotate clockwise and counterclockwise with reference to their axis. In this paper, we focused only on front and back movement, to analyse the square- and triangle-structured omnidirectional robot movements. An omnidirectional mobile robot shows different performances with the different number of wheels and the omnidirectional mobile robot’s chassis design. Research {{is going on in}} this field to improve the accurate movement capability of omnidirectional mobile robots. This paper presents a design of a unique device of Angle Variable Chassis (AVC) for linear movement analysis of a three-wheeled omnidirectional mobile robot (TWOMR), at various angles (θ) between the wheels. Basic mobility algorithm is developed by varying the angles between the two selected omnidirectional wheels in TWOMR. The experiment is carried out by varying the angles (θ = 30 °, 45 °, 60 °, 90 °, and 120 °) between the two selected omniwheels and analysing the movement of TWOMR in forward direction and reverse direction on a <b>smooth</b> <b>cement</b> surface. Respectively, it is compared to itself for various angles (θ), to get its advantages and weaknesses. The conclusion of the paper provides effective movement of TWOMR at a particular angle (θ) and also the application of TWOMR in different situations...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the {{investigations}} of impure silicagel AlF 3 ⋅ 3. 5 H 2 O, obtained as a by-product of phosphatic fertilizers production, in hardened cement paste. It was determined that silicagel is a suitable additive in hardened cement paste only when thermally activated for 1 hour at 800 °C. An amorphous SiO 2 of this additive reacts with Ca(OH) 2 that was formed during cement hydration and composes hydrosilicates of (1. 5 – 2. 0) CaO·SiO 2 ·nH 2 O type that add additional strength to the samples. With the optimal amount of additive of 10 % the compressive strength of hardened cement paste samples increases by (5 – 7) MPa compared to the samples without additive. By forming hardened cement paste samples with thermally activated SiO 2 it is observed, that it form agglomerate structures. The plasticizer additive is used to destroy the agglomerates. It was established that the optimal amount of plasticizer is 1. 2 % in examine conditions, because it obtained the increase in strength of samples and <b>smooth</b> hardened <b>cement</b> paste structure form...|$|R
40|$|Primary bovine osteoclasts were {{obtained}} by an outgrowth method from bovine periosteum and cultured for 7 days on an ionomeric cement for biomaterial testing. Osteoclasts cultured on slices of bovine bone and on glass microscope cover-slides served as a control. The cells were characterised as osteoclasts {{by a number of}} tests. Osteoclasts showed positive staining for tartrate resistant acid phosphatase and reactivity with the antibodies 13 C 2 and 23 C 6, which react with the alphachain of the vitronectin receptor. Addition of salmon calcitonin to the culture medium led to sudden cessation of lamellipodial activity. The cells resorbed bone by making pits. In mixed cultures with osteoblasts, the morphology of the osteoclasts on the <b>smooth</b> ionomeric <b>cement</b> surface was comparable to the one on glass cover-slides, revealing broad cytoplasmatic extensions on the material. Acridine orange staining demonstrated viability of cells {{until the end of the}} culture period and increased acidification after parathyroid hormone (PTH) stimulation. Scanning electron microscopy did not reveal erosion of the material by osteoclasts. No signs of aluminium toxicity on osteoclasts could be detected during the 7 day culture period, although an increased uptake of aluminium into the cell was demonstrated...|$|R

50|$|A rock-section {{should be}} about one-thousandth of an inch (30 micrometres) in thickness, and is {{relatively}} easy to make. A thin splinter of the rock, about 1 centimetre may be taken; it should be as fresh as possible and free from obvious cracks. By grinding it on a plate of planed steel or cast iron with a little fine carborundum it is soon rendered flat on one side and is then transferred to a sheet of plate glass and smoothed with the very finest emery till all minute pits and roughnesses are removed and the surface is a uniform plane. The rock-chip is then washed, and placed on a copper or iron plate which is heated by a spirit or gas lamp. A microscopic glass slip is also warmed on this plate with a drop of viscous natural Canada balsam on its surface. The more volatile ingredients of the balsam are dispelled by the heat, and when that is accomplished the smooth, dry, warm rock is pressed firmly into contact with the glass plate so that the film of balsam intervening may be as thin as possible and free from air-bubbles. The preparation is allowed to cool and then the rock chip is again ground down as before, first with carborundum and, when it becomes transparent, with fine emery till the desired thickness is obtained. It is then cleaned, again heated with a little more balsam, and covered with a cover glass. The labor of grinding the first surface may be avoided by cutting off a smooth slice with an iron disk armed with crushed diamond powder. A second application of the slitter after the first face is <b>smoothed</b> and <b>cemented</b> to the glass will in expert hands leave a rock-section so thin as to be already transparent. In this way the preparation of a section may require only twenty minutes.|$|R
