40|$|First, this Article reviews policymakers 2 ̆ 7 and {{commentators}} 2 ̆ 7 categorization {{of participants in}} Operation Enduring Freedom, the armed conflict in Afghanistan against al Qaeda and Taliban fighters. This Article concentrate specifically {{on the status of}} participants operating at the fringes of the categories of persons protected by the Geneva Conventions. It shows, for example, how al Qaeda and the Taliban fighters tested the bounds of the Conventions by employing methods of “warfare” which rendered them non-distinct and therefore made a determination of their status unclear. This Article demonstrates how policymakers and ultimately the U. S. President created a class of persons [...] so-called extra-conventional persons [...] who participated in hostilities yet failed to qualify for protection under any of the applicable Geneva Conventions. Second, this Article presents the training and education available to the judge advocates who faced these legal issues. it further presents perspectives on the law of war as it appeared from the resources, education, and training commonly available to deployed judge advocates. This Article ultimately concludes that international law and U. S. military doctrine classify many who participate in hostilities as “protected persons” under the Fourth Geneva Convention [...] a concept ultimately at odds with the determination made by U. S. policymakers. Third, and in concert with the two issues identified above, this Article describes the enormous challenges these issues created for U. S. military persons participating in Operation Iraqi Freedom. Specifically, it illustrates operational and legal challenges faced by military attorneys and the commanders they advised. It then explores legal issues that arose during the detention and occupation operations with respect to fighters associated with <b>Saddam</b> <b>Fedayeen.</b> Observing apparent similarities between <b>Saddam</b> <b>Fedayeen</b> and Taliban fighters earlier categorized as extra-conventional, this Article describes how, despite similarities in applicable law and attributes, judge advocates determined that these irregular fighters were protected persons under the Fourth Geneva Convention. It concludes that judge advocates dealt with these challenges responsibly, providing sound legal advice that balanced commanders 2 ̆ 7 mission requirements with the humanitarian spirit of the law of war...|$|E
50|$|This is {{the order}} of battle for Invasion of Iraq in the Iraq War between {{coalition}} forces and Iraqi regular forces supported by <b>Fedayeen</b> <b>Saddam</b> irregulars and others between March 19 and May 1, 2003.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Fedayeen</b> <b>Saddam</b> (Arabic: فدائيي صدام) was a {{paramilitary}} organization {{loyal to}} the Baathist government of Saddam Hussein. The name was chosen to mean [...] "Saddams Men of Sacrifice". At its height, the group had 30,000-40,000 members.|$|R
25|$|<b>Fedayeen</b> <b>Saddam</b> militia, Republican Guard and Iraqi {{security}} forces {{were reported to}} have executed Iraqi soldiers who tried to surrender on multiple occasions, as well as threatening the families of those who refused to fight.

50|$|Uday Hussein (1964-2003), {{son of the}} president, had {{a private}} torture chamber, and was {{responsible}} for the rapes and killings of many women. He was partially paralyzed after a 1996 attempt on his life, and was leader of the paramilitary group <b>Fedayeen</b> <b>Saddam</b> and of the Iraqi media.|$|R
50|$|The fall of Baghdad {{effectively}} {{ended the}} existence of the <b>Fedayeen</b> <b>Saddam</b> as an organized paramilitary. Several of its members died during the war. A large number survived, however, and were willing to carry on the fight even after the fall of Saddam Hussein from power. Many former members joined guerrilla organizations that began to form to resist the U.S-led coalition in Iraq. By June, an insurgency was underway in central and northern Iraq, especially in an area known as the Sunni Triangle. Some units of the Fedayeen also continued to operate independently of other insurgent organizations in the Sunni areas of Iraq. On 30 November 2003, a U.S. convoy traveling through the town of Samarra in the Sunni Triangle was ambushed by over 100 Iraqi guerillas, reportedly wearing trademark <b>Fedayeen</b> <b>Saddam</b> uniforms.|$|R

50|$|By 27 March, most Iraqi {{resistance}} in the city had been subdued and {{the focus of the}} battle shifted from full combat to cordon-and-search operations. Small groups of <b>Fedayeen</b> <b>Saddam</b> militia were hiding throughout the city and launched attacks on Marine patrols with small arms and RPGs. These attacks were uncoordinated and the resulting firefights were lop-sided, with large numbers of militiamen killed.|$|R
50|$|The Republican Guard {{were the}} elite {{troops of the}} Iraqi army {{directly}} reporting to Saddam Hussein, unlike the paramilitary force <b>Fedayeen</b> <b>Saddam,</b> and the ordinary Iraqi Army. Guard members were mainly, but not exclusively, Sunni Arabs rather than Shi'a Arabs, or Sunni Kurds. They were better trained, disciplined, equipped, and paid than ordinary Iraqi soldiers, receiving bonuses, new cars, and subsidized housing.|$|R
50|$|In 1995, Saddam Hussein {{created a}} new {{military}} unit called, <b>Fedayeen</b> <b>Saddam</b> ("Saddam's Men of Sacrifice") to punish Iraqis whose behavior or life-style was deemed to be in violation traditional Islamic mores.

50|$|The book {{chronicles the}} making of Charlie Company, {{following}} it from its home base at Fort Stewart, Georgia, to training in the deserts of California and Kuwait. It provides details of fighting {{on the road to}} Baghdad, including a key battle at the holy city of Najaf, where militias and <b>Fedayeen</b> <b>Saddam</b> used suicide tactics in a fruitless effort to stop the 70-ton M1A1 Abrams tanks.|$|R
5000|$|Uday Hussein {{formed the}} <b>Fedayeen</b> <b>Saddam</b> in 1995 with {{ten to fifteen}} {{thousand}} recruits, typically young Sunni men living in central Iraq, the regions most loyal to the Ba'ath Party.

Command of the militia was handed to Qusay Hussein in 1996 when it was uncovered that Uday was diverting weapons to the militia from the Iraqi Republican Guard.|$|R
50|$|TFT {{crossed into}} Iraq on March 21, 2003 with the {{missions}} of securing Jalibah Airfield and then securing the 3 bridges over the Euphrates River at An Nasiriyah {{to allow the}} 1st Marine Division to continue its attack north. From March 23 to March 29, 2003, Task Force Tarawa was engaged in heavy fighting {{in and around the}} city of An Nasiriyah as they came in contact with <b>Saddam</b> Hussein’s <b>Fedayeen</b> and members of the Iraqi 11th Infantry Division. TFT lost 18 Marines in the fighting and were involved in a friendly fire incident in which two A-10 Warthog aircraft killed a number of Marines when they strafed their Amphibious Assault Vehicles with 30mm depleted uranium rounds and Maverick missiles. The A-10 pilots were not prosecuted.|$|R
50|$|Fallujah was {{occupied}} by virtually every insurgent group in Iraq: al-Qaeda in Iraq (AQI), Islamic Army of Iraq (IAI), Ansar al-Sunna, Army of Mohammed (AOM), the Army of the Mujahedeen and the Secret Islamic Army of Iraq.

50|$|The zoo was {{destroyed}} during the 2003 invasion of Iraq. For their own safety, zoo workers suspended feeding {{the animals in}} early April 2003, when <b>Fedayeen</b> <b>Saddam</b> troops took up defensive positions around the zoo as U.S. forces began the battle of Baghdad. Out of the original 650 to 700 animals in the Baghdad Zoo only 35 had survived to the eighth day of the invasion, and these tended to {{be some of the}} larger animals.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>Fedayeen</b> <b>Saddam</b> was {{not part}} of Iraq's regular armed forces but rather {{operated}} as a paramilitary unit of irregular forces. As a result of this, the Fedayeen reported directly to the Presidential Palace, rather than through the military chain of command. Whilst paramilitary the Fedayeen were not an elite military force, often receiving just basic training and operating without heavy weapons. In this they were somewhat similar to the Basij of Iran or Shabbiha militia of Syria.|$|R
5000|$|... 2003: Saddam, {{along with}} Uday, Qusay and Aziz, watch {{television}} {{reports of the}} unfolding Second Gulf War. Qusay seizes Saddam's money from the Central Bank of Iraq on his father's orders. Meanwhile, Saddam orders his troops, particularly those from the Special Republican Guard, to fiercely resist the U.S.-led coalition forces. During a meeting with his sons in a Baghdad restaurant, Saddam advises Qusay {{to take care of}} Uday, who is commanding the <b>Fedayeen</b> <b>Saddam</b> paramilitary force.|$|R
25|$|Three {{weeks into}} the invasion, U.S.-led Coalition forces moved into Baghdad. Units of the Iraqi Special Republican Guard led the defence of the city. The rest of the {{defenders}} were a mixture of Republican Guard units, regular army units, <b>Fedayeen</b> <b>Saddam,</b> and non-Iraqi Arab volunteers. Initial plans were for Coalition units to surround the city and gradually move in, forcing Iraqi armor and ground units to cluster into a central pocket in the city, and then attack with air and artillery forces.|$|R
