25|$|In 2008's race, foreigners {{dominated}} the Belmopan to Cayo {{section of the}} race as Guatemalans and Americans combined to lead breaks into Roaring Creek, where U.S. National under-23 rider Ryan Baumann left the field in a dominant <b>solo</b> <b>run</b> to the City. Notable is that due to construction projects at the MJSC which started this year and would continue {{for the next few}} years, this year's race finished on the Marine Parade Boulevard near Memorial Park. The course record was lowered to 5 hours, 40 minutes, 12 seconds.|$|E
25|$|Note: The {{source of}} these assists stats {{does not explain}} what system was used to {{determine}} the award of an assist. The total no. of assists recorded is 270 but 727 goals were scored. The discrepancy of the source not recording an assist for every goal scored may be due to a system in use such as FIFAs assists system - (regardless of who made the final pass to the scorer, no assist is awarded when the scorer ultimately lays the goal on for him/herself via a dribble, <b>solo</b> <b>run</b> etc, scores after intercepting an opponent's pass etc.). However since the system in use is not explained, note that assists may simply of gone undocumented.|$|E
25|$|Zenden {{made his}} debut for the Netherlands {{national}} {{team in a}} 1998 FIFA World Cup qualification match against San Marino on 30 April 1997. He {{was included in the}} starting formation and played the entire match as the Netherlands won 6–0. He was called up to represent the Netherlands at the 1998 World Cup finals in France, where Zenden started the tournament as a substitute. Coming on twice as a substitute, he was selected to start in the semi-final loss to Brazil. He was once more selected to play in the third-place playoff against Croatia, where he scored a goal after a <b>solo</b> <b>run</b> and a powerful long-range shot. After scoring, he attempted to celebrate with an acrobatic somersault, but failed, throwing himself head first to the ground.|$|E
50|$|After the restart Cork {{really took}} control of the game. Joe Kelly, the Irish sprint champion, gave some {{dazzling}} displays with exceptional <b>solo</b> <b>runs.</b> He opened Cork’s scoring account after the interval with a quick goal that was shortly followed by a point. Dublin staged a brief rally that resulted in a goal by Charlie Downes. ‘The Dubs’ didn’t give up, however, their many further attempts on the Cork goal were saved by Tom Mulcahy. These saves gave Cork a lift and the Dublin comeback was aborted. At {{the other end of the}} field Joe Kelly was still producing some dazzling <b>solo</b> <b>runs</b> while also capturing Cork’s second goal of the game. Johnny Quirke and Jim Morrisson tacked on a few more points for Cork, however, by this stage the game was far beyond Dublin’s reach. At the final whistle Cork were declared the winners by 2-13 to 1-2.|$|R

Barcelona fielded a changed team, {{featuring}} a number of young players, Barcelona had the better of the first half, taking the lead through forward Bojan. Tottenham improved {{in the second half}} and earned a draw with a late header through youngster Jake Livermore. In the final game of the tournament, Spurs faced Scottish club Celtic. Tottenham suffered their first friendly loss in five years by losing 2–0. An early header from Chris Killen put Celtic 1–0 up before Celtic got their second through Georgios Samaras, a <b>solo</b> <b>run</b> earned the two goal cushion and eventually the win to claim the Wembley Cup. Egyptian champions Al Ahly were also a part of the tournament but were not an opponent of Spurs and finished bottom of the final group standings.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} game of the 2010–11 season, McCourt scored the only goal of the game against newly {{promoted}} Inverness Caledonian Thistle with a now-typical <b>solo</b> <b>run</b> and shot, beating three defenders and then netting from the edge of the box. He scored his second goal of the season, his first at Celtic Park in Celtic's 3–0 victory over Hearts on 11 September 2010, beating three players before chipping the goalkeeper. On 6 November 2010, McCourt netted the final goal of Celtic's 9–0 demolition of Aberdeen.

25|$|On 23 November, Ménez {{scored a}} {{beautiful}} goal as he calmy converted El Shaarawy's cross {{in the far}} net in the Derby della Madonnina against Inter. He then scored two goals and was named man of the match in the next game against Udinese. Ménez also continued his impressive form and scored a beautiful goal as he dribbled past 3 defenders {{and put it in}} the net as he helped Milan beat Napoli 2–0. Ménez scored two goals and created an assist in the 3–1 defeat of Parma on 1 February. He followed this with a penalty in a 2–2 draw with Hellas Verona on 7 March and a brace in a 3–1 defeat of Cagliari on 21 March, hitting a career high in goals for a single club (15, surpassing his previous best of 14 for PSG). On 4 March 2015, Ménez scored the winning goal after a long <b>solo</b> <b>run</b> against Palermo in a 2–1 victory, Milan's first away win of 2015. Ménez's season, however, ended poorly; on 29 April 2015, he was sent off for a second bookable offensive during the 3–1 defeat against Genoa and was handed a four-match ban for an insulting gesture, also missing the team's last match against Atalanta due to an injury. Ménez ended his first season at Milan as the club's top scorer, with 34 appearances and 16 goals in all competitions.|$|E

500|$|Townsend's <b>solo</b> <b>run</b> {{lasted until}} 2002. After a five-year break from recording, Strapping Young Lad reunited {{to record a}} new album. Townsend credits the album, Strapping Young Lad, as an {{emotional}} response to the attacks of September 11, 2001, in the United States. [...] "If the world's about to blow up," [...] said Townsend, [...] "let's write the soundtrack for it." [...] The album's lyrics were based more around fear and insecurity than the [...] "hostile" [...] lyrics of City. Musically, Strapping Young Lad was less industrial than City, and more reminiscent of death metal, with a [...] "larger-than-life" [...] rock production style. Townsend cited Front Line Assembly, Grotus, and Samael's Passage as influences. The self-titled album was released in February 2003. It received lukewarm reviews, with critics finding it inferior to City, {{but it was the}} band's first charting album, entering at 97th place on Billboard's Top Heatseekers chart.|$|E

2500|$|Two {{matches in}} the 1974 World Cup stood out for West Germany. The first group stage saw a {{politically}} charged match as West Germany {{played a game}} against East Germany. Both teams already were qualified for advance to the next round, and the East Germans won 1–0. The West Germans adjusted their line up after the loss and advanced to the final which was the other outstanding match, against the Johan Cruijff-led Dutch team and their brand of [...] "Total Football". Cruijff was brought down early in the German penalty area following a <b>solo</b> <b>run</b> before any of the German players had even touched the ball, and the Dutch took the lead from the ensuing penalty with just a minute gone on the clock. However, West Germany managed to come back, tying the match on a penalty scored by Paul Breitner, and winning it with Gerd Müller's goal just before half-time. A second goal by Müller was ruled offside.|$|E
