30|$|Dense-medium {{cyclones}} {{have been}} used for beneficiation of fine particles of coal. In this study, the usability of cyclones in the beneficiation of tailings of a coal preparation plant was investigated.

In order to evaluate the efficiency of cyclones, sink and float experiments using a <b>specific</b> <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> 1.3, 1.5, 1.7 and 1.9  g/cm 3, were conducted on a pilot scale. Based on the obtained results, the recovery of floated materials in cyclones with the <b>specific</b> <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> 1.40, 1.47 and 1.55  g/cm 3 are 17.75 %, 33.80 %, and 50 %, respectively.

Several tests were made previously for testing the behavior of the composites with resin reinforced with glass fiber to determine the physical and mechanical properties.

The results obtained for those composites were compared with the results obtained for resin Nestrapol 96 without reinforcement.

The modeling and optimization of these composites are based on the results obtained previously from the bending test and cyclical bending test...|$|R
30|$|As noted above, {{the slope}} of the curve is a {{parameter}} to measure the degree of separation and indicate the separation accuracy. The slope of the distribution curve of Fig.  14 is approximately linear in the distance between the distribution coefficients of 25 % and 75 %, so this slope can be used to represent the efficiency. Also, the slope in the density of 1.40  g/cm 3 relative to other densities indicates a better performance of the device in this particular weight. The linear distribution of the distribution curve (the distance between the distribution coefficients of 25 % and 75 %) is closer to the straight line, the Ep value is smaller and the separation efficiency is greater. In an ideal separation, this line is straight and the Ep value is zero. In this study, the calculated value of Ep for a heavy media cyclone with a density of 1.40  g/cm 3 equals to 0.080 and at the <b>specific</b> <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> 1.47, this value is 0.085. Also, this value is 0.030 for a <b>specific</b> <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> 1.55  g/cm 3. According to the Eq. (5), the coefficient of variations are also calculated for the Tromp curve at the <b>specific</b> <b>weights</b> <b>of</b> 1.40, 1.47 and 1.55  g/cm 3 as 0.20, 0.12 and 0.03, respectively.|$|R

Hematological diseases were diagnosed in 1, 667 persons who were directly exposed to radiation, including their second and third generations. General morbidity of hematological diseases in this period gradually increased from 19. 8 to 23. 8 per 100, 000 population. To observe dynamics of structure of hematological morbidity for the 10 -year period we compared the proportion of each disease in 1994, 1999, 2003, i. e., at the beginning, the middle {{and the end of the}} observation period.
