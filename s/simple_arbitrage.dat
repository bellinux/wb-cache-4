40|$|Several {{studies have}} {{emphasized}} a slow price adjustment to reported insider trades for Germany. The results {{presented in this}} paper, though, show that this is mainly caused by a subset of high arbitrage risk stocks. In fact, the abnormal return difference between the quintiles of stocks with highest and lowest idiosyncratic risk is {{in the range of}} 2. 99 - 4. 90 % over a 20 -day interval. These results are robust even {{in the context of a}} joint generalized least squares approach. By developing a <b>simple</b> zero-investment <b>arbitrage</b> trading strategy mimicking insider trades, it turns out that such a trading strategy, in most cases, generates significant positive returns as long as transaction costs are neglected. However, the outperformance disappears in all risk quintiles, if bid/ask spreads are taken into account. We conclude that the market's under-reaction to reported insider trades can mainly be explained by the cost of risky arbitrage and is therefore not exploitable. Copyright 2009 The Authors.

We consider markets that were liquid pre-crisis, and use pairs of sovereign bonds that have been issued in two foreign currencies, i. e. usd and euro.

We construct an empirical proxy of limits to arbitrage and run a comprehensive investigation about its economic and behavioral drivers. We find that limits to arbitrage are time-varying and state-dependent. Given that the 2008 Crisis went through two distinct phases (i. e. liquidity crunch and credit crisis), our findings suggest that while sentiment risk and subjective uncertainty affect the first phase, it is funding risk that plays a central role.

40|$|In one of {{the early}} {{attempts}} to model stochastic volatility, Clark [1973] conjectured that the size of asset price movements is tied to the rate at which transactions occur. To formally analyze the econometric implications, he distinguished between transaction time and calendar time. The present paper exploits Clark's strategy for a different purpose, namely, asset pricing. It studies arbitrage-based pricing in economies where: (i) trade takes place in transaction time, (ii) there is a single state variable whose transaction time price path is binomial, (iii) there are risk-free bonds with calendar-time maturities, and (iv) the relation between transaction time and calendar time is stochastic. The state variable could be interpreted in various ways. E. g., it could be the price of a share of stock, as in Black and Scholes [1973], or a factor that summarizes changes in the investment opportunity set, as in Cox, Ingersoll and Ross [1985] or one that drives changes in the term structure of interest rates (Ho and Lee [1986], Heath, Jarrow and Morton [1992]).

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Electrical Engineering and Computer ScienceThere {{are several}} {{specific}} applications that offer potential {{ways in which}} energy storage {{may be able to}} produce revenue and/or provide savings for system operators. The most obvious is <b>simple</b> energy <b>arbitrage</b> where low-cost energy is purchase during low-price hours and released back to the grid during high-priced times. For the purposes of avoiding upgrading transmission and distribution equipment, {{it can be used to}} decrease load. For variable renewable generation, it can store the energy from peak periods of production and discharge during period of low production, providing a smoother generator output. For this work, the economics of using a sodium-sulfur battery for energy arbitrage and capacity upgrade deferral were explored. A reduced 240 -bus model of the electrical grid in the western United States (WECC) was used to run a combination market/power-flow simulation where all generators and loads participate in an energy market auction. Into this simulation, a small sodium-sulfur battery was inserted and allowed to participate. Several parameters regarding the characteristics and usage of the energy storage device were explored: storage efficiency, location in the electrical grid, bidding algorithm, and number of years of operation. The results from the simulation allow for the calculation of revenue from energy arbitrage while more general off-line calculations were used to estimate the savings from deferring capacity upgrades in the electrical grid, examining the effects of deferral time, storage and upgrade cost, and upgrade equipment lifetime. The results show that this dual-use of a single storage device created a positive net present value (including capital costs), indicating this application of energy storage is financially beneficial. Most of the value generated by the storage device was through the upgrade deferral savings; the energy arbitrage added very little value and often lost money. The results from the market/power-flow simulation show that there is a strong interactive effect between the network location and the bidding strategy, both significantly effecting the revenue. The greatest savings through upgrade deferral come from deferring upgrades of more expensive equipment for longer periods of time...|$|R

40|$|The {{presence}} of purchasing power parity is often {{attributed to the}} exploitation of arbitrage opportunities in goods markets. We examine this presumption for a 1960 - 1996 monthly panel of bilateral exchange rates and trade for the G 7 countries. The data exhibit strong mean reversion. However, despite allowing for substantial latitude in specification, we find very limited support for a <b>simple</b> <b>arbitrage</b> view. The deviations of real exchange rates and trade from trend are virtually uncorrelated. Large trade deviations neither trigger nor accelerate mean reversion. Large real exchange rate deviations do not lead to systematic changes in trade. Constricting the sample to eighteen-month episodes of notable mean reversion - large persistent depreciations starting from overvalued levels - does not reveal any systematic relation either. The timing of these episodes does point, however, to an alternative explanation of mean reversion: the majority of episodes occur during periods of nominal exchange rate regime instability, pointing towards exchange rate policy or speculation as the immediate cause of mean reversion. Both may, of course, reflect expectations of trade responses, opening an indirect role for incipient arbitrage in explaining mean reversion. ...|$|E

There {{appears to be a}} host of local factors that {{must be taken into account}} in order to anticipate the likely level of regional food prices. This article assesses the degree of market integration and the speed of price adjustment to spatial price differentials between the SAFEX maize price in South Africa and maize grain and maize meal prices in Maputo, Mozambique. The findings of this study indicate that under certain trading regimes, there is no evidence of a long-run relationship between Mozambican and South African maize grain prices. This implies that any large deviations, within these regimes, which exceed transaction costs, could continue to grow with no tendency towards equilibrium. However, the trade volume data indicates maize grain exports from South Africa into Mozambique in every month except for three within the sample set. Hence, the empirical findings of this paper are unexpected given a <b>simple</b> <b>arbitrage</b> argument. Possible reasons for these findings are highlighted in the article. It is interesting to note that when the same empirical analysis is undertaken for the SAFEX maize prices and maize meal prices in Maputo then there is in fact evidence of a long-run relationship between these prices in a high import regime. These findings are not surprising and are what we would expect since two of the largest milling companies, located in Maputo are responsible for the majority of the volume of maize grain imported into the country from South Africa. price transmission, market integration, cointegration, trade regimes, Crop Production/Industries,...|$|E

40|$|Maize is {{the staple}} food crop of Zimbabwe and {{therefore}} {{plays an important}} role in achieving national food security goals. In the past 30 years, the country has experienced both a decline and unstable production in maize. Efforts by government to stabilize maize production seem not to have worked very well as this problem persists. The poor understanding of the maize supply response factors may partly explains this failure as efforts maybe directed at inappropriate/ ineffective factors. This study aims to develop and quantify econometrically a maize supply response model for Zimbabwe. The study evaluated the responsiveness of maize supply to its price and non price determinants. A more recent and appropriate error correction model (ECM) was applied on time series data covering a period 1980 - 2007 to avoid unrealistic assumptions of the traditional partial adjustment models. To deal with the expected problems associated with time series data the study adopted several diagnostic tests. In addition, Grangerâ€™s Wald test was used to assess the direction of causality between variables. After making all necessary transformation on the variables, a supply response function was then estimated using the ECM which offers a means of obtaining consistent yet distinct estimates for both short run and long run elasticities. The results show that the elasticity for the price of maize was not significant although positively related to maize output. This finding is exceptional in that most results from previous studies show own prices to significantly affect output. Therefore, the finding implies that pricing policy alone is a blunt instrument for increasing maize supply in Zimbabwe. Credit allocation, fertilizer use, rainfall, consumption and area under maize were found to significantly affect the responsiveness of maize supply. The elasticity for credit estimated at - 0. 06, was significantly inelastic and unexpectedly negative. A possible reason for this is that these were merely reported allocations and the actual expenditure might not have taken place. For consumptionâ€”not included in previous studiesâ€”the study found it to have a significant effect on output in the short run with a very elastic coefficient estimated at 9. 6. The results also show that there were instances were prices continued to go up above the transaction costs even when imports continued to increase. This finding is unexpected given a <b>simple</b> <b>arbitrage</b> argument. Given the findings, the study recommends policies that focus more on non price factors as a means of doing away with the conventional strong emphasis on price factors as a means of stabilising maize production. The study also recommends that trade policies should be completely liberalised to allow physical arbitrage to bring prices to their pareto efficient levels...|$|E
