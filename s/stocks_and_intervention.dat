40|$|Global {{population}} ageing {{is creating}} immense pressures on hospitals and other healthcare services, compromising {{their abilities to}} meet the growing demand from elderly patients. Current demand–supply gaps result in prolonged waiting times in emergency departments (EDs), and several {{studies have focused on}} improving ED performance. However, the overcrowding in EDs generally stems from delayed patient flows to inpatient wards – which are congested with inpatients waiting for beds in post-acute facilities. This problem of bed blocking in acute hospitals causes substantial cost burdens on hospitals. This study presents a system dynamics methodology to model the dynamic flow of elderly patients in the Irish healthcare system aimed at gaining {{a better understanding of the}} dynamic complexity caused by the system 2 ̆ 7 s various parameters. The model evaluates the <b>stock</b> <b>and</b> flow <b>interventions</b> that Irish healthcare executives have proposed to address the problem of delayed discharges, and ultimately reduce costs.

40|$|Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst) - one of {{the most}} {{important}} forest species in both Europe (about 34 million ha) and Romania (about 1. 4 million ha) - has been highly expanded in monocultures outside of its natural range since mid- 19 th century. Unfortunately, despite their many advantages (easy establishment, quick growth, high production, multiple uses of timber etc.), Norway spruce pure stands are facing many problems being especially subjected to wind and snow damages. Taking into account these facts, the article outlines the most important factors influencing Norway spruce stand stability such as initial spacing (<b>stocking)</b> <b>and</b> early silvicultural <b>interventions.</b> It seems obvious that two solutions for a better stability to snow damages at early ages exists: low stocking (wide spacing) at planting (maximum 2, 000 - 2, 500 plants per ha) <b>and</b> high <b>stocking</b> (narrow spacing) at planting (4, 000 - 5, 000 plants per ha) but followed by high intensity cleaningrespacing started no later than end of saplingbeginning of thicket stage. Under present Romanian conditions, facing many economic constraints (e. g., high cost of planting and tending; lack of labour force), the solution of low stocking (wide spacing) at planting as already stated at the beginning of 1980 ’s but never applied on a large scale seems more feasible and realisti...|$|R

To evaluate any production system holistically, it is necessary to identify a set of indicators accounting for economic, social and environmental dimensions. While the existing indicator selection frameworks help in identification of indicators, they lack a logically structured and transparent process. In this work, we develop a <b>stock</b> <b>and</b> flow based framework for a systematic selection of indicators for evaluating crop production systems. <b>Stock</b> <b>and</b> flow diagrams are used for conceptualization of the system and are sorted with respect to material, energy, and financial flows associated with the system. Various causal flows and their linkages are traced for each of the input-output component, and one representative indicator is selected for each causal flow. The indicators associated with desirable outcomes are taken in terms of input-output efficiency while undesirable outcomes are considered in terms of their absolute values. Using this process, a set of thirteen indicators have been identified for assessing the viability of agricultural practices with respect to socioeconomic and ecological sustainability...|$|R

40|$|Food {{safety and}} {{shelf-life}} are both important microbial concerns {{in relation to}} broiler meat production. Focus is mainly placed on the absence or control of potentially pathogenic microbes such as Salmonella and Campylobacter but, from commercial point of view, other spoilage bacteria also play a role. Regarding food safety, the primary target should be the production of pathogen-free live animals, thereby allowing slaughter plants to keep the processing line free of those micro-organisms. Pathogen-free feed is fundamental in obtaining such conditions, as is the Good Hygienic Practice in farming, including grand parent stock (GPS), parent <b>stock</b> (PS) <b>and</b> hatcheries. <b>Interventions</b> in the slaughter plant cannot always completely remove pathogens. However there are some measures of control available, including separation of flocks, carcass decontamination and implementing a balanced and operational HACCP system. Shelf-life is closely linked to food safety during processing. The developments towards in-line processing, including chilling, portioning and deboning, allows optimal control. It minimizes processing time and product to product contact, and thus increases shelf-life and limits cross contamination. Refrigeration conditions are very important and an interruption of the refrigeration chain can accelerate microbial growth. Modified atmosphere packaging (MAP) may contribute in controlling the undesired growth of spoilage organisms, and {{can play a role}} in food safety as well. The consumer needs to be educated in how to deal with food of animal origin that cannot be produced in an entirely sterile environment, in order to ensure shelf-life and correct preparation and use...|$|R
