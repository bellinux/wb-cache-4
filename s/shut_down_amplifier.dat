40|$|Monolithic class-D audio {{amplifiers}} typically feature built-in {{over current protection}} circuitry that <b>shuts</b> <b>down</b> the <b>amplifier</b> {{in case of a}} short circuit on the output speaker terminals. To minimize cost, the threshold at which the device <b>shuts</b> <b>down</b> must be set just above the maximum current that can flow in the loudspeaker during normal operation. The current required is determined by the complex loudspeaker impedance and properties of the music signals played. This work presents a statistical analysis of peak output currents when playing music on typical loudspeakers for home entertainment...|$|R

30|$|Table 8 {{also shows}} that for AT&T, the {{percentage}} of <b>shut</b> <b>down</b> links for the best online approach, Online-MO, is around 97.7 % {{of the percentage of}} <b>shut</b> <b>down</b> links observed for Offline-R. Online-MO selects paths that require the fewest number of new links, which decreases the overall percentage of active links. On the other hand, Online-R-LSP randomly selects paths without considering energy consumption. This results in Online-R-LSP exhibiting the smallest percentage of <b>shut</b> <b>down</b> links among the studied approaches, with only 12.2 % of the recorded percentage of Offline-R. For Abilene, Table 9 indicates that Online-R and Online-R-LSP exhibit the best and worst performance, respectively. Specifically, Online-R is able to <b>shut</b> <b>down</b> 24.9 % of the links <b>shut</b> <b>down</b> by Offline-R, whereas, Online-R-LSP only <b>shuts</b> <b>down</b> 1.4 % of the links <b>shut</b> <b>down</b> by Offline-R.|$|R
