50|$|Lombard {{credit is}} the {{granting}} of credit to banks against pledged items, mostly {{in the form of}} securities or life insurance policies. The pledged items must be readily marketable. Lending is via central banks, in particular the securities 'eligible for collateral' which are registered on lists; as a general rule, the Lombard rate (interest rate) is more or less one per cent above discount rate. The pledging of <b>securities</b> <b>means</b> that the credit institutions have the opportunity of acquiring money in the short term from central banks.|$|E
5000|$|In {{portfolio}} theory, {{risks of}} price changes {{due to the}} unique circumstances of a specific security, {{as opposed to the}} overall market, are called [...] "idiosyncratic risks". This specific risk, also called unsystematic, can be nulled out of a portfolio through diversification. Pooling multiple <b>securities</b> <b>means</b> the specific risks cancel out. In complete markets, there is no compensation for idiosyncratic risk—that is, a security's idiosyncratic risk does not matter for its price. For instance, in a complete market in which the capital asset pricing model holds, the price of a security is determined by the amount of systematic risk in its returns. Net income received, or losses suffered, by a landlord from renting of one or two properties is subject to idiosyncratic risk due to the numerous things that can happen to real property and variable behavior of tenants.|$|E

40|$|As a fast-evolving new area, RFID {{security}} and privacy has quickly {{grown from a}} hungry infant to an energetic teenager during recent years. Much of the exciting development {{in this area is}} summarized in this book with rigorous analyses and insightful comments. In particular, a systematic overview on RFID {{security and}} privacy is provided at both the physical and network level. At the physical level, RFID <b>security</b> <b>means</b> that RFID devices should be identified with assurance in the presence of attacks, while RFID privacy requires that RFID devices should be identified without disclosure of any valuable information about the devices. At the network level, RFID <b>security</b> <b>means</b> that RFID information should be shared with authorized parties only, while RFID privacy further requires that RFID information should be shared without disclosure of valuable RFID information to any honest-but-curious server which coordinates information sharing. Not only does this book summarize the past, but it also provides new research results, especially at the network level. Several future directions are envisioned to be promising for advancing the research in this area...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{internet}} {{plays an}} important role in all areas of society from the economy to the government. <b>Security</b> <b>means</b> permitting things you do want, while preventing things you don’t want from performing. Computer <b>security</b> <b>means</b> storing the information on a computer in a secure manner. Nowadays Computer Security is pretentious by malicious data. Malware represents a serious threat to the security of computer systems. Traditional malware detection techniques like signature-based, heuristic-based, Specification-based detection are used to detect the known malware. These techniques detect the known malware accurately, but unable to detect the new, unknown malware. This paper presents a malware detection system based on the data mining and machine learning technique. The proposed method consists of disassemble process, feature extraction process and feature selection process. Three classification algorithms are employed on dataset to generate and train the classifiers named as Ripper, C 4. 5, IBk. The ensemble method i. e. Voting method is used to improve the accuracy of results. Here majority voting and veto voting are implemented the expected output is decided on the basis of majority and veto voting. The decision strategy of veto is improved by introducing the trust-based veto voting. This paper efficiently compared the results of majority voting, veto voting and trust-based veto voting...|$|R

In this paper, we {{identify}} some {{issues in the}} interplay between practice and theory in cryptography, issues that have repeatedly appeared in different incarnations over the years. These issues are related to fundamental concepts in the field, e. g., to what extent we can prove that a system is secure and what theoretic results on <b>security</b> <b>mean</b> for practical applications. We argue that several such issues are often overlooked or misunderstood, and {{that it may be}} very productive if both theoreticians and practitioners think more consciously about these issues and act accordingly. ...|$|R
