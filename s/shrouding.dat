50|$|Not all <b>shrouded</b> {{turbines}} are {{the same}} - {{the performance of a}} <b>shrouded</b> turbine varies with the design of the <b>shroud.</b> Not all <b>shrouded</b> turbines have undergone independent scrutiny of claimed performances, as companies closely guard their respective technologies, so quoted performance figures need to be closely scrutinised. Lunar Energy reports a 15%-25% improvement over the same turbine without the <b>shroud.</b> <b>Shrouded</b> turbines do not operate at maximum efficiency when the <b>shroud</b> does not intercept the current flow at the correct angle, which can occur as currents eddy and swirl, resulting in reduced operational efficiency. At lower turbine efficiencies the extra cost of the <b>shroud</b> must be justified, while at higher efficiencies the extra cost of the <b>shroud</b> has less impact on commercial returns. Similarly the added cost of the supporting structure for the <b>shroud</b> has to be balanced against the performance gained. Yawing (pivoting) the <b>shroud</b> and turbine at the correct angle, so it always faces upstream like a wind sock, can increase turbine performance but may need expensive active devices to turn the <b>shroud</b> into the flow. Passive designs can be incorporated, such as floating the <b>shrouded</b> turbine under a pontoon on a swing mooring, or flying the turbine like a kite under water. One design by Tidal Energy Pty Ltd passively yaws the <b>shrouded</b> turbine using a turntable with a peer reviewed claim of 3.84 (384%) increase in efficiency over the same turbine minus the <b>shroud</b> - See Kirke..|$|R

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{study has been}} conducted to investigate the aerothermal performance of a <b>shrouded</b> high pressure turbine blade {{in a large scale}} rotating rig. The rotor blade and the associated <b>shroud</b> and casing geometry have been modelled in a large scale low speed turbine rig that was designed to investigate a novel passive <b>shroud</b> cooling methodology. The objective of the present paper is to describe the aerothermal performance of a passive <b>shroud</b> cooling strategy using measured heat transfer and adiabatic cooling effectiveness data. Improved physical understanding of the <b>shroud</b> aerodynamics as reported in the companion paper Lehmann et al. [1] will be used here to support the analysis. Highly resolved experimental heat transfer data was acquired on the <b>shroud,</b> the fins and on the <b>shroud</b> underside with the thin heater film method. The distribution of the adiabatic cooling effectiveness on the rotor <b>shroud</b> was measured with a combination of the Ammonia-Diazo and a foreign gas sampling technique. The measurements are complemented by steady numerical computations of the turbine stage. Due to the impact of vortical flow structures in the over <b>shroud</b> cavities, the Nusselt numbers on the <b>shroud</b> top surfaces were found to be of the same order as on the <b>shroud</b> underside. The passive <b>shroud</b> cooling concept was found to provide quite efficient and uniform cooling to the over-shroud surfaces while the distribution of coolant on the <b>shroud</b> underside was significantly affected by the rotor secondary flow...|$|R

2500|$|Ghostface {{is often}} shown to taunt his targets, {{initially}} representing himself as charming and even flirtatious when speaking. His conversations turn confrontational and intimidating, using {{his knowledge of}} other characters or graphically describing his intentions before appearing to the target physically. Craven considers Jackson's voice performance as Ghostface to have [...] "evil sophistication". When confronting his intended victim, Ghostface is portrayed in varying ways, sometimes quick and efficient and other times clumsy, falling, or colliding with objects that hinder his pursuit, a characteristic that varies based upon who is wearing the costume. All of the characters that use the Ghostface disguise share the trait of taunting their victims and prolonging a kill when {{they appear to have}} an advantage. The Billy/Stu Ghostface would gut their victims after killing them; this was not performed on Tatum Riley (Rose McGowan) who was killed in a mechanical garage door. This Ghostface in particular would ask their victim questions about horror films and employ the tropes of the genre in their attacks, displaying a detachment from their reality and aligned with the same self-awareness of the film itself which toys with the expectations of the horror genre. The second Ghostface, created by Mickey and Mrs. Loomis, would simply stab their victim to death but often in a public place or with witnesses. The third Ghostface, created by Roman, used theatricality and movie props to attack his victims, using a voice changer that allowed him to sound like many other people, casting suspicion and doubt on other characters. In addition, he would use images and the synthesized voice of Maureen to specifically taunt Sidney, even <b>shrouding</b> himself in a bloodied, crime scene cover, alluding to the murder of Maureen, to fool Sidney into believing that she was losing her sanity. The fourth Ghostface, created by Jill and Charlie, filmed each murder on web cameras hidden around the environment and spy cameras in their masks. They mostly stabbed their victims to death but would go further and gut them if they wanted. They also made some of the murders public to gain the attention of the world press.|$|E

A detailed <b>shroud</b> flow model is derived and used to elucidate the causes and consequences of the flow pattern observed.
