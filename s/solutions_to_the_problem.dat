He further suggests for the social status of scientists to be raised to at least as strong a motivating factor as money can.|$|E
5|$|In 1874 and 1875, Alexander was {{assigned}} to a board examining the problem of keeping the Mississippi River Delta from silting up and becoming an impediment to ship traffic. During {{the course of his}} tenure on the board, he traveled to Europe in order to examine European <b>solutions</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem.</b> At the end of 1875, Alexander was asked by the state government of California to examine a proposed irrigation project in the San Joaquin Valley. Busy with other projects, Alexander appointed an associate, William Hammond Hall, to head the project.|$|E
5|$|The {{model of}} {{diplomatic}} {{spheres of influence}} resulting from the Congress of Vienna in 1814–15 after the Napoleonic Wars endorsed Austrian dominance in Central Europe. The negotiators at Vienna took no account of Prussia's growing strength within and among the German states and so failed to foresee that Prussia would rise to challenge Austria for leadership of the German peoples. This German dualism presented two <b>solutions</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> of unification: Kleindeutsche Lösung, the small Germany solution (Germany without Austria), or Großdeutsche Lösung, the greater Germany solution (Germany with Austria).|$|E

5|$|As Syzygy and Nutting {{prepared}} for the MOA show, Bushnell learned that another pair of engineers were also creating an arcade version of Spacewar. In August 1971 Bushnell called Bill Pitts and Hugh Tuck, operating as Mini-Computer Applications, {{so that they could}} meet and discuss their <b>solutions</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> of running Spacewar on an inexpensive computer. Pitts and Tuck were developing a prototype machine of Galaxy Game when they met with Bushnell; the game, however, while a faithful recreation of Spacewar, ran on an externally-connected DEC PDP-11 with a Hewlett-Packard 1300A Electrostatic Display, and the total cost of the prototype unit was US$20,000. The Syzygy duo were relieved, though also somewhat disappointed, to find that Galaxy Game was not using an innovative solution Syzygy had missed to build an economically-competitive arcade game. Pitts and Tuck, conversely, felt that Computer Space was a pale imitation of Spacewar, while Galaxy Game was a superior adaptation of the game. They eventually produced two game prototypes, both displayed in the Stanford student union building, but never produced the game commercially due to the high cost of the cabinet.|$|E
5|$|On 17 August 1563, Charles IX was {{declared}} of {{age at the}} Parlement of Rouen, {{but he was never}} able to rule on his own and showed little interest in government. Catherine decided to launch a drive to enforce the Edict of Amboise and revive loyalty to the crown. To this end, she set out with Charles and the court on a progress around France that lasted from January 1564 until May 1565. Catherine held talks with Jeanne d'Albret, the Protestant queen regnant of Navarre (and the wife of Antoine de Bourbon) at Mâcon and Nérac. She also met her daughter Elisabeth at Bayonne near the Spanish border, amidst lavish court festivities. Philip II excused himself from the occasion. He sent the Duke of Alba to tell Catherine to scrap the Edict of Amboise and to find punitive <b>solutions</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> of heresy.|$|E
5|$|A {{high level}} of {{insulation}} was used to keep the building warm during the winter months. This approach, however, brings with it the potential problem of overheating during the summer due to solar heat gains through the glazing, body heat {{and the use of}} computers and electric lighting. Standard <b>solutions</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> usually involve using energy intensive HVAC systems. The Scottish Parliament Building, however, reduces the requirements for such systems to only 20% of the accommodation by a variety of strategies. Natural ventilation is used wherever possible. A computerised management system senses the temperature {{in different parts of the}} Parliament and automatically opens windows to keep the building cool. During summer months, the building opens the windows during the night time when it is unoccupied and permits the heavy concrete floors and structure to cool and rid themselves of heat absorbed during the day. This then helps to keep the building temperature down during the day by absorbing the excess heat from the glazing, occupants and electrical equipment. Some of the concrete floors are further cooled by water from 25metres (80ft) deep bore holes beneath the parliamentary campus which also provide water for the toilet facilities. The building achieves the highest rating in the Building Research Establishment's Environmental Assessment Method (BREEAM).|$|E

25|$|In his {{philosophical}} work, Grayling connected <b>solutions</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> of scepticism in epistemology {{with the}} questions about assertibility {{and the problem of}} meaning in the philosophy of language and logic. A principal theme in his work is that considerations of metaphysics, which relate to what exists, has to be kept separate from the two connected questions of the relation of thought to its objects in the variety of domains over which thought ranges, and the mastery of discourses about those domains, where a justificationist approach is required.|$|E

After the Al Askari shrine bombing, in February 2006, he warned that spreading sectarian violence might lead to civil war – and possibly even a broader conflict involving neighboring countries. Khalilzad sought political <b>solutions</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> of sectarianism, in particular working to integrate the balance of power between Iraq's three main ethnic groups in order to head off growing Sunni violence.|$|E

25|$|Several <b>solutions</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> were studied, {{and in the}} end Heatherington {{decided the}} only {{practical}} one was to have the modem operate in two modes. In one, data mode, all data forwarded from the computer were modulated and sent over the connected telephone line as it was with any other modem. In the other, command mode, data forwarded from the computer were instead interpreted as commands. In this way, the modem could be instructed by the computer to perform various operations, such as hang up the phone or dial a number. The modem would normally start up in command mode.|$|E
25|$|The {{arthropod}} head {{problem is}} a long-standing zoological dispute concerning the segmental composition of {{the heads of the}} various arthropod groups, and how they are evolutionarily related to each other. While the dispute has historically centered on the exact make-up of the insect head, it has been widened to include other living arthropods such as the crustaceans and chelicerates; and fossil forms, such as the many arthropods known from exceptionally preserved Cambrian faunas. While the topic has classically been based on insect embryology, in recent years a great deal of developmental molecular data has become available. Dozens of more or less distinct <b>solutions</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem,</b> dating back to at least 1897, have been published, including several in the 2000s.|$|E
25|$|The {{project has}} held {{conferences}} in 2004, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2011 and 2012. The 2012 conference ranked bundled micronutrient interventions the highest priority, and the 2008 report identified supplementing vitamins for undernourished children as the world’s best investment. The 2009 conference, dealing specifically with global warming, proposed research into marine cloud whitening (ships spraying seawater into clouds {{to make them}} reflect more sunlight and thereby reduce temperature) as the top climate change priority, though climate change itself is ranked well below other world problems. In 2011 the Copenhagen Consensus Center carried out the Rethink HIV project together with the RUSH Foundation, to find smart <b>solutions</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> of HIV/AIDS.

25|$|Nicholson {{approached}} {{the problem by}} constructing a development of the intrados of the arch from the plan and elevation drawings, effectively unrolling and flattening the surface, then drawing the courses perpendicular to the faces, adding the header joints perpendicular to the courses, then finally rolling up the development diagram by projecting the detail of the intrados back onto the plan and elevation drawings, a technique also used by others who would later offer alternative <b>solutions</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem.</b> This method resulted in the courses of stone voussoirs making up {{the barrel of the}} skew arch following parallel helical paths between the abutments, giving the view along the barrel an attractive rifled appearance. Although these courses meet the arch faces at right angles at the crown of the arch, the nearer they are to the springing line the greater their deviation from perpendicularity. Thus Nicholson's method is not the perfect solution, but it is a workable one that has one great advantage over more purist alternatives, namely that since the helical courses run parallel to each other, all the voussoir stones can be cut to the same pattern, the only exceptions being the ring stones, or quoins, where the barrel meets the faces of the arch, each of which is unique but has an identical copy in the other face.|$|E
