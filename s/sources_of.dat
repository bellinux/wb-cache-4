Specifically, a mixed research design was utilized to determine the frequency and characteristics of APA errors committed in the reference lists of these manuscripts. Findings revealed that authors committed more than 12 reference list errors per manuscript, on average (M = 12. 83, SD = 7. 25). Further, a total of 466 unique reference list errors were identified, which yielded the following 14 reference list error themes: general errors, reference heading, names of authors, publication year/date, title of work, publisher information, <b>source</b> <b>of</b> journal/periodical, <b>source</b> <b>of</b> authored book, <b>source</b> <b>of</b> edited book, <b>source</b> <b>of</b> website, <b>source</b> <b>of</b> paper presentation, <b>source</b> <b>of</b> dissertation/thesis, <b>source</b> <b>of</b> newspaper article, and <b>source</b> <b>of</b> government document.
