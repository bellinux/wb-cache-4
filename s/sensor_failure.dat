5|$|At {{the start}} of the race, Rosberg got off the line well and overtook {{teammate}} Hamilton for the lead going into turn one. Coming out of the following turn, Kimi Räikkönen was caught out by heavy wheelspin on his harder tyre compound going side by side and swept to the outside of the track, crashing into Fernando Alonso's McLaren, who was lifted on top of the Ferrari. Both drivers were able to walk away unharmed from the incident. The collision brought out the safety car. At the end of the lap, Daniil Kvyat made a pit stop to replace a damaged front wing, while Will Stevens retired from the race with an oil leak. When the safety car came back into the pit lane on the end of lap six, Rosberg was able to defend his lead against Hamilton and quickly built a gap, leading him by 2.3 seconds by lap eleven. Lap twelve saw the second McLaren of Jenson Button retiring with an intake system <b>sensor</b> <b>failure.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{top three}} drivers {{appeared}} on the podium to collect their trophies and in the subsequent press conference. Michael Schumacher revealed that his early pit stop was down to a possible <b>sensor</b> <b>failure</b> which caused his team to receive misinformation. He also added that the wet-weather conditions forced him to change the entire brake balance towards {{the front of his}} car. Barrichello said that he informed Ferrari technical director Ross Brawn that it would be quicker to make an extra pit stop had it rained for ten more laps. Nevertheless, he stated that he trusted his team in their judgement and revealed his car developed an clutch issue during the Grand Prix. Fisichella stated that he was driving a conservative race as he was on a one-stop strategy. Additionally, he praised the team for their achieving a continued run of consistent podium position finishes at the circuit.|$|E
5|$|The weather {{remained}} hot and dry for the Saturday morning practice sessions. Wurz was {{the fastest}} {{driver in the}} third practice session {{with a time of}} 1:38.318, three-thousands of a second quicker than Häkkinen. Coulthard set the third fastest time. The two Ferraris ran slower than the previous session; Michael Schumacher was fourth with Barrichello sixth. They were separated by Irvine. Zonta, Villeneuve and Ralf Schumacher followed in the top ten. An electronic engine <b>sensor</b> <b>failure</b> prevented Frentzen from setting a lap time. In the final practice session, Coulthard was the quickest driver, setting a time of 1:38.109 despite going into the gravel traps in the session. Häkkinen finished with the fourth fastest time. Michael Schumacher and Wurz ended the session with the second and third fastest times respectively. Barrichello was fifth quickest, ahead of Jaguar drivers Herbert and Irvine. Button was seventh after having changed his car's engine. Villeneuve and Trulli completed the top ten ahead of qualifying.|$|E

5|$|After the Hungarian Grand Prix on 13 August, {{five teams}} {{conducted}} mid-season testing at the Silverstone Circuit on 15–17 August. McLaren test driver Olivier Panis was fastest {{on the first}} day, ahead of Frentzen. Williams test driver Bruno Junqueira's car had a water leak, resulting in repairs which limited his team's testing time. Panis remained the fastest on the second day. Jos Verstappen's Arrows car had a <b>sensor</b> <b>failure,</b> limiting his team's testing time; the car's floor {{had to be removed}} to install a new sensor. Panis was again fastest {{on the final day of}} testing. Ferrari opted to test the suspension and tyres of Michael Schumacher's car at the Fiorano Circuit. Schumacher later moved to the Mugello Circuit, with Barrichello conducting engine and setup tests, and Ferrari test driver Luca Badoer remained at Fiorano for development work on new car components. Prost opted to test at the Autodromo Nazionale Monza on 17–18 August with driver Jean Alesi. Benetton conducted a five-day, one-car test at the Danielson Circuit, with test driver Mark Webber on aerodynamic development for the first four days and Alexander Wurz concentrating on practice starts the last day.|$|E
5|$|As {{the race}} {{approached}} its halfway point, Lotterer gained on the No. 9 Audi {{and moved into}} second place, becoming Audi's lead challenger to Porsche. After leaving the pit lane, Pierre Ragues's No. 43 Morand car billowed smoke because of an oil pressure <b>sensor</b> <b>failure</b> and his vehicle caught fire, causing him to retire at Arnage corner. Several LMGTE cars {{took the opportunity to}} change brake discs {{at this point in the}} morning, including Fernando Rees in the No. 99 Aston Martin. Returning to the track Rees' car failed to stop in time for the first Mulsanne Straight chicane and hit the rear of the TDS Racing Oreca-Nissan. The Oreca, which had held second place in the LMP2 category, was abandoned in the gravel at the chicane while Rees limped the damaged Aston Martin back to the garage for repairs to its front-left corner. The No. 26 G-Drive Ligier took over second place in LMP2, although still a lap behind the leading KCMG Oreca while the lead in LMGTE Pro was now left to Jordan Taylor's No. 64 Corvette and the No. 51 AF Corse Ferrari of Bruni on the same lap. In the early morning the No. 7 Audi's hold on second place was relinquished when the right-rear bodywork of the car came apart on the circuit and littered debris at the Porsche Curves, requiring a seven-minute stop for repairs and dropping the car down the race order.|$|E
25|$|Russia's aim of {{finishing}} the constellation in 2010 suffered a setback when a December 2010 launch of three GLONASS-M satellites failed. The Proton-M itself performed flawlessly, but the upper stage Blok DM3 (a new version {{which was to}} make its maiden flight) was loaded with too much fuel due to a <b>sensor</b> <b>failure.</b> As a result, the upper stage and the three satellites crashed into the Pacific Ocean.

It is shown by computer simulation that the estimator part and the configuration detection part of the MPAC can readily adapt to actuator and <b>sensor</b> <b>failures</b> and that the failure detection filter technique cannot detect actuator or <b>sensor</b> <b>failures</b> accurately for this type of system because of the plant modeling errors.

CART set the mandatory pit stop window to a maximum of 47 laps which required all drivers to make at least four pit stops. Grace commanded the drivers to start their engines. The race started at 1:36p.m. local time. Bräck maintained his pole position advantage heading into the first turn. Tagliani drove alongside his teammate Carpentier and overtook him for ninth place. Serviá moved from 14th to tenth by the end of the first lap, but dropped to eleventh when he was passed by another car. He moved back into tenth place shortly afterwards. Junqueira was passed by Tagliani to move into seventh position on lap three. After starting from 12th, Fittipaldi dropped to the rear of the field and drove slower than the leading drivers. Tracy slowed without warning on lap 13 in the second turn with a power steering issue, and the first caution of the race was displayed two laps later when he stopped under the white line on the back straight with a gearbox problem requiring course officials to remove his car from the track. His engine's telemetry stopped working indicating a crank <b>sensor</b> <b>failure,</b> possibly caused by his gearbox problem.|$|E
