Spectral indices have been estimated in the rest frame energy bands 0. 5 - 1 keV (soft), 1 - 4 keV(mid) and 4 - 20 keV(hard). Our spectral analysis indicate a flattening of the spectral index in the hard band for 2 radio-loud quasars in the GL quasar sample for which the data have moderate signalto-noise ratio. These results are consistent with the reported spectral properties of non-lensed radio-loud quasars, however, there are no indications of <b>spectral</b> <b>hardenning</b> towards fainter X-ray fluxes. We have identified a large fraction of Broad Absorption Line (BAL) quasars amongst the GL quasar population. We find that approximately 35 % of radio-quiet GL quasars contain BAL features which is significantly larger than the 10 % fraction of BAL quasars presently found in optically selected flux limited quasar samples. We present a simple model that estimates the effects of attenuation and lens magnification on the luminosity function of quasars and that explains the observed fraction of GL BAL quasars. These observations suggest that a large fraction of BAL quasars are missed from flux limited optical surveys. Modeling of several X-ray observations of the GL BAL quasar PG 1115 + 080 suggests that the observed large X-ray variability may be caused in part by a variable intrinsic absorber consistent with previously observed variability of the BAL troughs in the UV band. The observed large X-ray flux variations in PG 1115 + 080 offer the prospect of considerably reducing errors in determining the time delay with future X-ray monitoring of this system and hence constraining the Hubble constant H 0.

We present a maximum-likelihood method of determining the intrinsic spectral index distribution (ISID) of a population of gamma-ray emitters which accounts for error in measurement of individual spectral indices, and we apply it to EGRET blazars. We find that the most likely Gaussian ISID for EGRET blazars has a mean of 2. 27 and a standard deviation of 0. 20. We additionally find some indication that FSRQs and BL Lacs may have different ISIDs (with BL Lacs being harder). We also test for <b>spectral</b> index <b>hardening</b> associated with blazar variability for which we find no evidence. Finally, we produce simulated GLAST spectral index datasets and perform the same analyses. With improved statistics due to the much larger number of resolvable blazars, GLAST data will help us determine the ISIDs with much improved accuracy. Should any difference exist between the ISIDs of BL Lacs and FSRQs or between the ISIDs of blazars in the quiescent and flaring states, GLAST data will be adequate to separate these ISIDs at a significance better than 3 sigma.

Localized stochastic particle acceleration, spatial diffusion, and synchrotron {{as well as}} synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) emission are considered in a leptonic model. To account for inhomogeneity, we use a 2 D axisymmetric cylindrical geometry for both relativistic electrons and magnetic field. In this first phase of our work, we focus on steady-state spectra that develop from a time-dependent model. We demonstrate that small isolated acceleration region in a much larger emission volume are sufficient to accelerate particles to high energy. Diffusive escape from these small regions provides a natural explanation for the spectral form of the jet emission. The location of the acceleration regions within the jet is found to affect the cooling break of the spectrum in this diffusive model. Diffusion-caused energy-dependent inhomogeneity in the jets predicts that the SSC spectrum is harder than the synchrotron spectrum.

We employ the X-ray emission in Solar flares observed by Reuven Ramaty Higly Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI) in order to estimate flare plasma parameters. Further, we employ the observations from Geo-stationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES) and Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO), for SEPs and CMEs parameter estimation respectively. We report a good association of soft-hard-harder (SHH) spectral behavior of Flares with occurrence of Solar Proton Events for 16 Events (observed by RHESSI associated with protons).

40|$|Below an {{accretion}} rate of approximately a few per {{cent of the}} Eddington {{accretion rate}}, X-ray binary systems are not usually found in the soft spectral state. However, at accretion rates a factor of a few lower still, in the hard state, there is another spectral transition which is well observed but not well understood. Below ~ 0. 5 - 1 per cent of the Eddington accretion rate (m_crit), the <b>spectral</b> index <b>hardens</b> with increasing accretion rate, but above m_crit, although still in the hard state, the spectral index softens with increasing accretion rate.

In Cygnus X- 1 we find separate hard and soft continuum components, and show using root-mean-square (rms) spectra that the soft component dominates the variability. The spectral transition at m_crit is clearly present in the hard-state hardness-intensity diagrams of Cygnus X- 1. Above m_crit, GX 339 - 4 shows similar softer-when-brighter behaviour at both long and short time-scales. Similarly, XTE J 1118 + 480, which remains well below m_crit, is harder-when-brighter behaviour on all time-scales. We interpret these results in terms of two continuum components: a hard power-law which dominates the spectra when the accretion rate is low, probably arising from Comptonisation of cyclo-synchrotron photons from the corona, and a soft power-law which dominates at higher accretion rates, arising from Comptonisation of seed photons from the accretion disc.

We found that in the L[subscript X] versus photon index Γ[subscript PL] and L[subscript X] versus disk temperature kT[subscript MCD] plots, most of our sources fall on a narrow track in which the <b>spectral</b> shape <b>hardens</b> with increasing luminosity below L[subscript X] ~ 7 X 10 [superscript 37] erg s[superscript − 1], but is relatively constant (Γ[subscript PL] ~ 1. 5 or kT[subscript MCD] ~ 1. 5 keV) above this luminosity, which is similar to the spectral evolution of Galactic neutron star (NS) LMXBs in the soft state in the Chandra bandpass. Therefore, we identified the track as the NS LMXB soft-state track and suggested sources with L[subscript X] [over ~] 7 X 10 [superscript 37] erg s[superscript − 1] as Z sources. Ten other sources (five are transients) displayed significantly softer spectra and are probably black hole X-ray binaries in the thermal state. One of them (persistent) is in a metal-poor GC...|$|R
40|$|RHESSI {{observations}} {{are used to}} quantitatively study the hard X-ray evolution in 5 large solar flares selected for <b>spectral</b> <b>hardening</b> {{in the course of}} the event. The X-ray bremsstrahlung emission from non-thermal electrons is characterized by two spectroscopically distinct phases: impulsive and gradual. The impulsive phase usually consists of several emission spikes following a soft-hard-soft spectral pattern, whereas the gradual stage manifests itself as <b>spectral</b> <b>hardening</b> while the flux slowly decreases. Both the soft-hard-soft (impulsive) phase and the hardening (gradual) phase are well described by piecewise linear dependence of the photon spectral index on the logarithm of the hard X-ray flux. The different linear parts of this relation correspond to different rise and decay phases of emission spikes. The temporal evolution of the spectra is compared with the configuration and motion of the hard X-ray sources in RHESSI images. These observations reveal that the two stages of electron acceleration causing these two different behaviors are closely related in space and time. The transition between the impulsive and gradual phase is found to be smooth and progressive rather than abrupt. This suggests that they arise because of a slow change in a common accelerator rather than being caused by two independent and distinct acceleration processes. We propose that the hardening during the decay phase is caused by continuing particle acceleration with longer trapping in the accelerator before escape. Comment: accepted by Ap...|$|E

40|$|PKS 1510 - 089 (z= 0. 361) {{is one of}} only {{a handful}} of flat {{spectrum}} radio quasars that have been detected at very high energy (VHE, E> 100 GeV) gamma rays. It is a very active source across the entire electromagnetic spectrum. VHE observations in May 2016 with H. E. S. S. and MAGIC revealed an exceptionally strong flare, which lasted for less than two nights, and exhibited a peak flux of about 0. 8 times the flux of the Crab Nebula above 200 GeV. The flare provides the first evidence of intranight variability at VHE in this source. While optical observations with ATOM reveal a counterpart at optical frequencies, Fermi-LAT observations reveal only low flux variability at high energy (HE, E> 100 MeV) gamma rays. Interestingly, the HE <b>spectral</b> index significantly <b>hardens</b> during the peak of the VHE flare, indicating a strong shift of the peak frequency of the high energy component. Given the expected strong absorption due to the broad-line region, the VHE emission region cannot be located deep within that region.

40|$|We present X-ray {{observations}} of the BL Lacertae (BL Lac) object Markarian 501 (Mrk 501), taken with the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer in 1998 May {{as part of a}} multi-wavelength campaign. The X-ray light curve shows a very rapid flare in which the 2 - 10 keV flux increased by ~ 60 % in < 200 seconds. This rapid rise is followed by a drop-off in the 2 - 10 keV flux of ~ 40 % in < 600 seconds. The 10 - 15 keV variation in this flare is roughly a factor of two on similar time-scales. During the rise of the flare, the 3 - 15 keV <b>spectral</b> index <b>hardened</b> from 2. 02 +/- 0. 03 to 1. 87 +/- 0. 04, where it remained during the decay of the flare. This is the fastest variation ever seen in X-rays from Mrk 501 and among the fastest seen at any wavelength for this object. The shift in the energy at which the spectral power peaks (from 30 keV during the flare) is also among the most rapid shifts seen from this object. This flare occurs during an emission state (2 - 10 keV flux approximately 1. 2 e- 10 erg cm^- 2 s^- 1) that is approximately 25 % of the peak flux observed in 1997 April from this object but which is still high compared to its historical average X-ray flux. The variations in the hardness ratio are consistent with the low energy variations leading those at high energies during the development and decay of the flare. This pattern is rare among high frequency peaked BL Lac objects like Mrk 501, but has been seen recently in two other TeV emitting BL Lacs, Mrk 421 and PKS 2155 - 304. The hard lag is consistent with a flare dominated by the acceleration time-scale for a simple relativistic shock model of flaring. Comment: 11 pages, 3 figures, accepted for publication in Astrophys.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a detailed X-ray spectral analysis of a sample of 123 X-ray sources (46 being type- 1 AGN and 28 type- 2 AGN) detected with XMM-Newton in the Lockman Hole field. Using a single power law model our sources' average <b>spectral</b> slope <b>hardens</b> at faint 0. 5 - 2 keV fluxes but not at faint 2 - 10 keV fluxes. We explain the effect in terms of an increase in X-ray absorption at faint fluxes. The average spectral slope of our sources is ~ 1. 9 with an intrinsic dispersion of ~ 0. 28. We detected X-ray absorption in 37 % of the sources, ~ 10 % in type- 1 AGN and ~ 77 % in type- 2 AGN. Using X-ray fluxes corrected for absorption, the fraction of absorbed objects and the absorbing column density distribution did not vary with X-ray flux. Our type- 1 and type- 2 AGN do not appear to have different continuum shapes, but the distribution of intrinsic absorption is different among both classes. A significant fraction of our type- 2 AGN (5 out of 28) were found to display no substantial absorption. We discuss possible interpretations to this in terms of Compton-thick AGN and intrinsic Broad Line Region properties. An emission line compatible with Fe Kalpha was detected in 8 sources with rest frame equivalent widths 120 - 1000 eV. The AGN continuum or intrinsic absorption did not depend on X-ray luminosity and/or redshift. Soft excess emission was detected in 18 objects, but only in 9 could we fit this spectral component with a black body model. The 0. 5 - 2 keV luminosities of the fitted black body were not significantly different in type- 1 and type- 2 AGN, although the temperatures were slightly higher in type- 2 AGN than in type- 1 AGN. For 9 sources (including 1 type- 1 AGN and 3 type- 2 AGN) a scattering model provided a better fit of the soft excess emission. Comment: 27 pages, 39 figures. Accepted for publication in A&...|$|R
