500|$|Tim Heidecker and Eric Wareheim, {{the stars}} and creators of the American sketch comedy {{television}} series Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job!, guest starred in the episode as foodies Amus Bruse and Fois Garth, respectively. These two characters are among the foodies that Marge, Bart, and Lisa meet at the Ethiopian restaurant. In the episode, they rhyme a hip hop song that according to Selman is [...] "all bragging about how awesome and cool you are as a foodie." [...] It was co-written by the duo, and {{was inspired by the}} song [...] "Empire State of Mind". [...] Selman has commented that [...] "In animated TV shows, whenever you're trying to show people having fun doing their new thing , it just kind of becomes a boring montage. And we've done so many montages on The Simpsons over 25 years, it's like, oh, God, no more montages. [...] So we were like, 'Why not do a silly rap song?' Rapping is sort of inherently boastful, and there's <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>being</b> a foodie that's inherently boastful. It's like the boastfulness links those things. So Tim and Eric perform a food rap song in the show—an extremely silly rap song, and the name is intentionally silly: 'Blogging a Food Blog.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Two-Lane Blacktop {{originated}} with producer Michael Laughlin {{who had a}} two-picture deal with CBS Cinema Center Films. He convinced the production company to pay Will Corry $100,000 for his original story, about two men, one black and one white, who drive across the country followed by a young girl, which was inspired by his own cross-country journey in 1968. Returning from Italy after a film project had fallen through, Hellman was introduced to Laughlin who presented Hellman with two projects, {{one of which was}} Two-Lane Blacktop. He asked Hellman to direct, who found Corry's story [...] "interesting, but not fully realized". Hellman agreed to make the film only if another screenwriter was hired to rewrite the script and Laughlin agreed. A friend of Hellman's recommended underground writer Rudolph Wurlitzer. Hellman read his novel Nog and was impressed enough to hire Wurlitzer, who began reading Corry's story, but gave up after five pages. Hellman and Wurlitzer agreed to keep the basic idea of the cross-country race as well as the characters of the Driver, the Mechanic and the Girl. Wurlitzer invented the GTO character {{and the rest of the}} supporting cast. To prepare for writing the script, he stayed in a Los Angeles motel and read car magazines, as well as hanging out with several obsessive mechanics and [...] "stoner car freaks" [...] in the San Fernando Valley. Wurlitzer said that he did not know much about cars, but did [...] "know <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>being</b> lost on the road". He wrote a new script in four weeks.|$|E
