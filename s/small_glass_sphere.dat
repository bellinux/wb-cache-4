50|$|Extensive {{microscopic}} {{study was}} done by Anton van Leeuwenhoek, a draper who took the interest in microscopes after seeing one while on an apprenticeship in Amsterdam in 1648. At some {{point in his life}} before 1668, he was able to learn how to grind lenses. This eventually led to Leeuwenhoek making his own unique microscope. His were a single lens simple microscope, rather than a compound microscope. This was because he was able to use a single lens that was a <b>small</b> <b>glass</b> <b>sphere</b> but allowed for a magnification of 270x. This was a large progression since the magnification before was only a maximum of 50x. After Leeuwenhoek, there was not much progress for the microscopes until the 1850s, two hundred years later. Carl Zeiss, a German engineer who manufactured microscopes, began to make changes to the lenses used. But the optical quality did not improve until the 1880s when he hired Otto Schott and eventually Ernst Abbe.|$|E
50|$|Arnold's {{research}} has focused on label-free detection of bio-nanoparticles from the perturbation of the resonant frequency of a microcavity, after estimating the extreme sensitivity of such an approach for DNA sensing in a 2001 American Scientist article. In 2003, he and his co-workers identified the mechanism for the detection of individual protein and viruses. The recipe for the detection and sizing of single HIV viruses following this mechanism was proposed early in 2008 at a Faraday Discussion of the Royal Society of Chemistry. Later that year, this recipe was applied to the detection and sizing of comparably sized single Influenza virus particles. This research is funded by the National Science Foundation. Researchers led by Arnold demonstrated the detection and sizing of the smallest individual RNA virus. They developed the Whispering Gallery-Mode Biosensor, an ultra-sensitive biosensor based on their original proposal and patent application. An additional discovery by co-researcher S.I. Shopova that gold nano-receptors on the microcavity lead to a further frequency shift enhancement led to another patent issued in 2013, from a filing in 2011. This hybrid sensor uses gold nano-antennas on a <b>small</b> <b>glass</b> <b>sphere</b> to detect single ultra-small virus particles as well as individual proteins. Arnold and his team have detected single thyroglobulin molecules, a human cancer marker protein, and single serum albumin molecules, a bovine plasma protein.|$|E

40|$|Five {{methods for}} surface {{roughening}} (Coarse emery papers, Pasting <b>small</b> <b>glass</b> <b>spheres,</b> Pasting sand, Chemical corrosion and CNC machining) were studied experimentally {{to choose the}} best method to produce three different grades of surface roughness for solid (Carbon steel) spherical particles of five diameters (10, 14, 18, 22 and 25) mm accelerated with rotation in Newtonian and non-Newtonian liquids. The results showed that coarse emery papers method gives irregular surface roughness and to measure the surface roughness it must be made of a plane sample so the devices of surface roughness measurement can predict the value of surface roughness and this is impossible to be produced with coarse emery papers (for the sphere and the plane sample with the same grade of surface roughness). Both pasting <b>small</b> <b>glass</b> <b>spheres</b> and sand gives regular and measurable surface roughness but they are irrelevant for the rotation of solid spherical particles because of the broking of roughened surface after a small period of time because of the liquid's resistance to the accelerated spheres motion. The chemical method gave one grade of surface roughness only and it is relevant and the surface roughness is measurable. The CNC machining method was the best method, it gave three different grades of surface roughness which were (74, 176 and 243) µm...|$|R

The device {{was used as}} a clinical thermometer, tied to the wrist or the arm of the patient {{with the head of the}} frog facing upward. The variations in body temperature were registered by the movement of the spheres. The rise in temperature causes an increase in the volume of the alcohol, reflected in the movement of the small spheres (first the less dense, then the more dense). Because of the spheres' sluggish motion, this thermometer was also called infingardo slow. The invention of this model is attributed to Ferdinand II de' Medici.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} a numerical model {{to determine the}} trajectory of sphere particles when submitted to ultrasonic progressive waves. This model assumes that the following forces act on the particle: gravity, buoyancy, viscous forces and acoustic radiation force due to progressive wave. In order not to restrict the model to a small particle size range, the viscous forces that act on the sphere are modeled by an empirical relationship of drag coefficient that is valid {{for a wide range}} of Reynolds numbers. The numerical model requires the pressure field radiated by the ultrasonic transducer. The pressure field is obtained experimentally by using a calibrated needle hydrophone. The numerical model validation is done by dropping <b>small</b> <b>glass</b> <b>spheres</b> (on the order of 500  μm diameter) in front of a 1 -MHz 30 -mm diameter ultrasonic transducer. When the particles cross the transducer face, the radiation force produced by the transducer pushes the particles away. The glass particles trajectory is obtained by a CCD camera. The experimental trajectory shows good agreement with that predicted by the numerical model...|$|R

40|$|A simple, {{physical}} approximation {{is developed}} for the effect of viscosity for stable interfacial waves and for the unstable interfacial waves which correspond to Rayleigh‐Taylor instability. The approximate picture is rigorously justified for the interface between a heavy fluid (e. g., water) and a light fluid (e. g., air) with negligible dynamic effect. The approximate picture may also be rigorously justified for the case of two fluids for which the differences in density and viscosity are small. The treatment of the interfacial waves may easily be extended to the case {{where one of the}} fluids has a small thickness; that is, the case in which one of the fluids is bounded by a free surface or by a rigid wall. The theory is used to give an explanation of the bioconvective patterns which have been observed with cultures of microorganisms which have negative geotaxis. Since such organisms tend to collect at the surface of a culture and since they are heavier than water, the conditions for Rayleigh‐Taylor instability are met. It is shown that the observed patterns are quite accurately explained by the theory. Similar observations with a viscous liquid loaded with <b>small</b> <b>glass</b> <b>spheres</b> are described. A behavior similar to the bioconvective patterns with microorganisms is found and the results are also explained quantitatively by Rayleigh‐Taylor instability theory for a continuous medium with viscosity...|$|R

So far most studies {{relate to the}} mechanical deformation and to the change of nano-scale electrical properties. We present an attempt to utilize multi wall carbon nanotubes for developing a new flexible composite for macro-scale pressure sensors. Two simultaneously existing effects – mechanical strain sensing and organic solvent vapour sensing – were found and investigated in polyisoprene – multi wall carbon nanotube composites. Elastomer composites containing dispersed nano-size particles, for example, polyisoprene – multi wall carbon nanotube composites were prepared by treatment of the composite matrix with chloroform providing an increase of mobility and better dispersion of the nano-particles within the matrix. Multi wall carbon nanotubes {{with a small amount}} of solvent were carefully grinded in a china pestle before adding the polyisoprene matrix. Both the polyisoprene matrix solution and concentrated multi wall carbon nanotube solution in chloroform were blended at room temperature for certain time in a mixer which contained <b>small</b> <b>glass</b> <b>spheres.</b> The product was dried and vulcanized under Pa pressure at 160 ºC for 20 min. Polyisoprene – multi wall carbon nanotube composites show attractive pressure sensing and gas sensing properties. The maximum sensitivity has been achieved in the region slightly above percolation threshold of the composite. The mechanism of sensing effect is based on changes in tunneling currents due to the strain caused by mechanical forces as well as swelling of composite matrix...|$|R
40|$|Optical {{analysis}} of thin slides of cave fromations {{carried out by}} a number of researchers showed a fine structure consisting of a succession of double layers (thichness less than a fe tens of micron). In each two layer unit, one is thicker, transparent and composed of an assembly of calcite needle shaped crystals oriented perpendicularly to the layer: the other layer is opaque, cryptocrystalline or amorphous. According to some C- 14 datings of archaeological remains covered by the formations each couple of layers would correspond to one year. In order to check this hypothesis an experiment was set up in the Novella Cave (near Bologna) under controlled conditions. Cave pearls were chosen for investigation owing to the possibility of studying one of them without introducing any perturbation on the formation of the calcite sinter on the others. The growth of cave pearls was studied in a glass cell composed of three sections and described in the paper. In the first one, some holes of different size and depth were made in order to ascertain the influence of these geometrical parameters in function of the distance from the water drips. <b>Small</b> <b>glass</b> <b>spheres</b> (diameter around 1 mm) were placed in the holes as deposition nuclei. A cover was placed over this section to collect the water splash only when the water flow was measured, in order to avoid any change in the natural evaporation rate. The connection with the second section was obtained by a glass tube designed in order to guarantee a suitable mixing of the water. Both temperature and pH were measured. The third section consisted of a graduated container used to measure the flow rate which varied from 0. 4 - 0. 5 - to 500 - 700 drops/min (a range of about three orders of magnitude). Air temperature was also measured during the experiment. The chemical composition of both natural and artificial cave pearls was determined. All the data are reported. No difference (with the exception of Fe concentration) was detected between the natural and the artificial conditions. Therefore after some years of experimentation the growth rate will be determined under controlled conditions...|$|R
5000|$|Dutch draper and {{pioneering}} microbiologist Antonie van Leeuwenhoek (1632-1723), {{a contemporary}} of artist Vermeer (and an executor for Vermeer {{when he died}} in 1675) in Delft was known to have exceptional lens making skills, having created single small lenses capable of 200x magnification, far exceeding those of more complex compound microscopes of the period. Indeed, his feats of lens making were not matched for a considerable time as he kept aspects of their construction secret; in the 1950s, C.L. Stong used thin glass thread fusing instead of polishing to recreate Leeuwenhoek design microscopes.

40|$|The {{mineralogy}} and petrology of the Apollo 11 {{rocks are}} consistent with impact melting of ilmenite and pyroxene crystals plus liquid derived from fractional crystallization of basaltic magama. The complementary plagioclase accumulate should exist in the highlands. The ferrobasaltic magma is derived from a differentiated hot moon of modified chondritic composition. The one-sided distribution of large irregular seas is explained by tidal attraction of the last fraction of liquid to the near {{side of the moon}} and release of liquid by meteorite impact. The vesicular ferrobasalt lavas contain ilmenite, clinopyroxene and plagioclase and have textures similar to some terrestrial basalts. Delayed appearance of plagioclase indicates an unusual source of the magma. The iron-enrichment of the coarser microgabbros is extreme at the end of crystallization resulting in a new iron metasilicate, pyroxferroite. The oxygen fugacity at 1050 °C of these rocks indicated by the composition of opaque oxides and troilite-iron intergrowths is 10 ^(- 14) - 10 ^(- 16) compared to 10 ^(- 11) for terrestrial basalts and about 10 ^(16) for ordinary chondrites. Absence of hydrous minerals indicates loss of volatiles at some stage in the moon's history. The breccias and soil have the same mineralogy modified by shock. Plagioclase vitrophyres are probably melted cumulates and may derive from the highlands. Lithification of the breccia results principally from welding of debris discharged from a hot gas cloud created by meteorite impact. <b>Small</b> <b>glass</b> <b>spheres</b> have surface features consistent with a fiery rain of boiling silicate liquid rounded by surface tension and later impacted by high-velocity micrometeorites. Melting experiments of synthetic material of mean Apollo 11 rock composition revealed low liquidus temperature, delayed appearance of plagioclase and narrow crystal-liquid interval. These support the concept of advanced fractional crystallization of a basaltic liquid under reducing conditions leading to high iron enrichment. Flotation of plagioclase and sin king of ilmenite and pyroxene should occur in the liquid basalt. We propose that meteorite impact blasted away a plagioclase-rich crust, melting a mixture of fractionated basalt liquid and ilmenite plus pyroxene crystals. The new liquid formed the Sea of Tranquillity and yielded the near-surface lava flows represented by the ferrobasalts and microgabbros. This new liquid could yield plagioclase only after the extra ilmenite and pyroxene had crystallized. We propose that the original basalt liquid was derived by fractional crystallization of a molten moon of modified chondritic composition yielding a metallic core surrounded by pressure-stable Mg-rich o li vine and pyroxene. The fractionated liquid became Fe-rich resulting in an inverse density stratification. Primitive ultra basic crust should occur in the highlands, along with dominant plagio clase- rich cumulates. The temperature-time relations of the model are discussed qualitatively. Key factors are early removal of radioactive material from the center by fractional crystallization and possible enhancement of radiative heat transfer in volatile-free silicates. The moon rocks should be more refractory and rigid because of the low volatile content...|$|R

Using atomic force microscopy, we measure the electrostatic force f(s, V) between the sphere and substrate {{as a function of}} the surface separation s and applied voltage V.

Further force measurements for the "wet" porous <b>glass</b> <b>spheres</b> filled with an aqueous solution of urea and the dried porous <b>glass</b> <b>spheres</b> filled with (dry) air suggest that there is a water layer of a few nanometers in thickness adsorbed on the hydrophilic glass surface under ambient conditions. This adsorbed water layer is more conductive than the dielectric core of the <b>glass</b> <b>sphere,</b> making the sphere surface to be at a potential close to that of the cantilever electrode. As a result, the electric field is strongly concentrated in the gap region between the <b>glass</b> <b>sphere</b> and gold-plate substrate and thus their electrostatic attraction is enhanced. This surface conductivity effect is further supported by the thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) and force response measurements to a time-dependent electric field.

Some authors have described microscopic distributions by investigating explanted liver tissue [25, 31] or using simulations [26, 43]. Extensive cluster lodgings in larger arterioles and smaller arteries may challenge the previous hypothesis of a rather uniform microscopic microsphere distribution throughout the liver parenchyma for resin spheres [8, 10, 26, 44, 45], as the tendency of larger clusters to contain a major proportion of the total activity seems to increase exponentially with mean absorbed dose. As the resin <b>spheres</b> and <b>glass</b> <b>spheres</b> are similar in size, the clustering tendency should be the same for 120 Gy regions with <b>glass</b> <b>spheres</b> and 2.4 Gy regions with resin spheres (the same concentration of spheres given a 50 -times higher specific activity for <b>glass</b> <b>spheres).</b> A microsphere concentration causing an absorbed dose level that low is rare for resin spheres and was not investigated in our samples.|$|R
