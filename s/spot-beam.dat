40|$|Current SATCOM systems employ {{multiple}} reflectors with a one-feed-per-beam configuration {{to synthesize}} narrow <b>spot-beams.</b> However, these systems are very complex and offer very limited reconfigurability. Active antenna arrays are attractive solutions [1], although are often expensive {{due to the}} large number of elements and electronic components involved. Aperiodic array antennas can substantially reduce the number of elements and costs with respect to regular arrays but their design is challenging [2]. Several synthesis methods have been proposed, yet aperiodic array design techniques are not as mature as those in use for their regular array counterparts. These methods are often either: (i) accurate but computationally expensive (e. g. Genetic Algorithms [3]), or; (ii) efficient but simplified (e. g. Density Tapered method [4]). Compressive Sensing (CS) has been recently applied to the synthesis of sparse antenna arrays. The method can optimize large maximally sparse antenna array problems in a fast, deterministic and flexible way [5]. In previous research publications, the authors have (i) extended the original formulation to the multi-beam scenario; (ii) exploited array layout symmetry and modular design; and (iii) hybridized the original iterative optimization procedure with a full-wave EM analysis, so as to include the effects of mutual coupling into the design process and studied for arrays of strongly coupled antennas elements, such as dipoles, as well as large planar arrays of pipe horns [6, 7]. Additionally the authors have addressed multi element type design [8] and, more recently, are investigating reconfigurable arrays (i. e. arrays designed to provide a set of arbitrary-shaped beams) and isophoric arrays (i. e. arrays with a single excitation amplitude).

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} a {{new market}} for satellite communication serving small fixed-station business systems. This market requires transmission between {{a large number of}} smaller and cheaper earth terminals. The traffic requirements for satellite business services in Europe by the year 2000 have been reviewed. An advanced regenerative on-board processing business satellite with 13 <b>spot-beams</b> for the European coverage was then proposed to meet the expected traffic growth. This satellite system is designed {{to meet the needs of}} the user rather than, as traditionally, the user fitting in with the satellite. SCPC/FDMA and R-TDMA (reservation-TDMA) multiple access schemes were found to be most suitable for the proposed system serving many small users whose traffic was mixed voice, data and video. The architecture of the satellite payload has been studied and two main functional blocks, transmultiplexer and baseband switch were identified. The use of the transmultiplexer is to transform the EDM channels into TDM and the baseband switch is to provide full connectivity between all the stations so that the revolutionary idea of having a "switchboard in the sky" can be realised. The development work for the baseband switch is reported in detail in this thesis together with a comparison of different architectures for the baseband switch. A proof-of-concept model for the baseband switch was designed, built and tested. From the test results, the feasibility of implementing the baseband switch using the chosen architecture was proved. Another main area studied in this thesis was device technology. The present and future capability of bipolar, CMOS and GaAs technology has been investigated concentrating mainly on digital devices and semi-custom technology. Since the satellite is operating in an hostile environment, it has been necessary to study the effects of radiation on semiconductor devices. The outcome of these studies indicate that it is very promising to launch such advanced satellite payloads in the late 1990 's...|$|R
40|$|The {{undergoing}} {{spread of}} broadband Internet shows that high-speed services are now {{perceived as a}} commodity worldwide. Several research programmes have proposed low-cost mobility enhancements to the DVB-RCS standard to intercept the market segment represented by {{the increasing number of}} airlines, land-mobile, and maritime passengers. This thesis investigates link and network-layer mobility issues related to a multi-beam network topology with a particular emphasis on backward-compatible protocol modifications minimising the impact over the signalling mechanisms of the original DVB-RCS normative. The availability of GPS equipment onboard collective vehicles and their pattern predictability suggest using position and route information as driving parameters for mobility protocols. Estimations of the terminal residence time within <b>spot-beams</b> are used to prioritise ongoing communications over fresh traffic. Their superiority over distance- based schemes is demonstrated in congested airborne-railroad scenarios, whilst specific solutions are proposed to counteract the sensitivity of the signalling exchange to error modelling. Admission control in wireless networks determines the trade-off between QoS guarantee and resource utilisation. A novel scheme for inbound and outbound traffic estimation is proposed and compared with several existing static and probabilistic approaches. This is proved effective at reducing blocking probabilities without sacrificing much bandwidth in resource reservation. The mathematical characterisation of a threshold-based queuing mechanism for handover traffic is also presented and its accuracy confirmed via simulation results in airborne-railway scenarios. The integration with terrestrial cellular systems is investigated to ensure connectivity in urban centres. A hybrid satellite-terrestrial architecture is envisaged where gap-fillers provide service continuity when intra-satellite mobility cannot be guaranteed. It is proven that the temporary terrestrial diversion of active connections contributes to decrease blocking probabilities and to increase the network utilisation. Because such an approach incurs in roaming costs, an optimisation tool is developed that identifies the conditions under which vertical handover is preferable...|$|R

40|$|A {{rapid growth}} of new {{satellite}} systems utilizing the Ka-band (27 – 40 Ghz) and even higher frequencies is expected in the coming years. The services offered will include broadband communication, interactive broadcasting, multimedia applications, interconnection of local area networks and Internet connectivity. Many of the new systems will use technologies as multiple <b>spot-beams,</b> onboard processing, and switching of packets between beams and inter satellite links. Because of congestion in the lower bands such ad C (4 – 8 Ghz) and Ku-band (12 – 18 Ghz), numerous of these services will use Ka-band. One additional advantage to the spectrum availability at Ka-band is the potential of smaller terminals compared to those used in lower frequency bands. Several mobile satellite systems have recently started operation and more are planned or scheduled for implementation {{within a few years}} to provide personal and data communication at L-band (1 – 2 Ghz) and S-band (2 – 4 Ghz) frequencies. The systems will utilize different orbit types, for example low, medium or geostationary earth orbits, to provide voice and data services to mobile users. Understanding of the propagation aspects is important for successful design of a satellite system obtaining the targeted service quality and availability. For systems operating above about 10 Ghz, attenuation caused by hydrometeor effects is the dominant propagation impairment on line-of-sight (LOS) links. For mobile communications systems operating at lower frequencies, the impairments resulting from multipath propagation, shadowing and blockage from obstacles on the ground severely affect the radio signals. Estimation of dynamic propagation is essential for the design of reliable and spectrum efficient communication systems. The system can adapt the transmission methodology that maximizes the throughput of information and optimizes the delivery time. The design of such mitigation techniques will depend on the dynamics and how often the events occur. The research conducted in this study on mobile propagation effects of terrain at L-band has led to an improved three-state channel model for land mobile satellite systems. The time spent in each of the states is quite realistic, facilitating better simulation of the performance of communication systems. A new methodology was developed to perform large area coverage estimation by calculating satellite visibility for low earth orbit and geostationary constellations based on digital terrain maps. The procedure takes into account large terrain obstacles and procedures a gross overview of the potential area covered with one or several satellites. A photogrammetric technique to assess performance of non-geostationary orbit (NGSO) systems in mid- and high latitude urban areas was used to estimate channel fading and diversity improvement. Some measurements of the maximum obtainable call duration for the Iridium system are included as well. The studies on atmospheric propagation effects between 20 and 60 Ghz included analyses of fade and inter-fade duration statistics, which are important when evaluating fade mitigation techniques and estimating system outages. Fade duration measurements were analyzed and an effort made to find a common statistical fade duration model. Based on this work, a new prediction method for fade durations on satellite-earth paths was developed. This ability to forecast rain attenuation was investigated with the aid of statistical prediction methods and terrestrial measurements on a 60 Ghz link. Finally, beacon measurements at 50 Ghz from Italsat F 1 were used to test and compare available scintillation prediction models. The work has improved the ability to estimate and simulate propagation effects on mobile and fixed satellite system performance. dr. ing. dr. ing...|$|R

40|$|We propose an {{approach}} to optimize resource sharing and in a multi-beam broadband satellite system that supports both unicast and multicast flows. We show that in this architecture, the load on every <b>spot-beam</b> queue could be different, {{depending on the type}} of the flows and the distribution of the receivers across <b>spot-beam</b> coverage areas. This load unbalance may significantly under-utilize the system resources and decrease the system throughput when both unicast and multicast flows are active in the system. In this paper, we formulate an optimization problem for intra- and inter-beam resource sharing such that the variance of the session rates experienced by users of a flow located in different beam coverage areas is minimized. The result of our resource allocation also determines the maximum sustainable rate of each flow. We calculate the beam utilization and maximum sustainable sessions rates with and without optimization and compare the results.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel Connection Admission Control (CAC) strategy for vehicular DVB-RCS satellite networks. Using estimations of arriving and departing traffic in each <b>spot-beam</b> our proposal aims to maximize user satisfaction and minimize {{at the same}} time resource reservation. Via GPS measurements, terminals periodically estimate their time to handoff and encapsulate mobility information within signaling bursts. Upon reception of a mobility update, the NCC (Network Control Centre) is able to estimate the amount of traffic roaming around the spot-beams as well as the probabilities that active terminals will eventually handoff. As a consequence, the NCC reserves only the necessary amount of resources for handover purposes in each <b>spot-beam</b> in order to minimize the percentage of connections forced to termination. No overhead is introduced for the implementation of our CAC solution as it makes use of the existing DVB-RCS signaling for providing the NCC with the extra mobility parameters driving the admission control module. Through an accurate ns- 2 modeling of existing DVB-RCS signaling mechanisms, we demonstrate that our lightweight CAC scheme outperforms static channel reservation schemes in terms of handover failure rate as well as traffic prediction strategies using mobility information in terms of channel utilization...|$|E

40|$|Abstract In {{this paper}} a new {{technique}} for radio resource management applicable to dynamic satellite networks for multimedia applications is presented. It uses a dynamic channel reservation policy to map the application specific requirements for accepting and maintaining a call. A new service classification scheme is proposed for the future wireless multimedia systems. According to this, the definition of each service class {{is based on a}} range of different performance criteria for the call blocking and call dropping rates. This approach can be used for future multi-beam dynamic satellite constellation networks. It {{is based on the assumption}} that the user terminal inter <b>spot-beam</b> handoff times can be accurately predicted by the network during the call set-up phase.

40|$|Receiver {{synchronisation}} {{can be a}} {{major problem}} in a mobile radio environment where the communication channel is subject to rapid changes. Communication in spread spectrum systems is impossible unless the received spreading waveform and receiver-generated replica of the spreading waveform are initially synchronised in both phase and frequency. Phase and frequency synchronisation is usually accomplished by performing a two-dimensional search in the time/frequency ambiguity area. Generally, this process must be accomplished at very low SNRs, as quickly as possible, using the minimum amount of hardware. This thesis looks into techniques for improving spread spectrum receiver synchronisation in terms of the mean acquisition time. In particular, the thesis is focused on receiver structures that provide and/or use a priori information in order to minimise the mean acquisition time. The first part of this work is applicable to synchronisation scenarios involving LEO satellites. In this case, the receiver faces large Doppler shifts and must be able to search a large Doppler ambiguity area in order to locate the correct cell. A method to calculate the Doppler shift probability density function within a satellite <b>spot-beam</b> is proposed. It is shown that depending on the satellite’s velocity and position as well as the position of the centre of the <b>spot-beam,</b> not all Doppler shifts are equally probable to occur. Under well defined conditions, the Doppler pdf within the <b>spot-beam</b> can be approximated by a parabola-shaped function. Several searching strategies, suitable for the given prior information, are analysed. The effects on the mean frequency searching time are evaluated. In {{the second part of the}} thesis a novel acquisition technique, based on a fast preliminary search of the ambiguity area, is described. Every cell of the ambiguity area is examined two times. The first search is a fast straight line serial search, the duration of which is a crucial parameter of the system that must be optimised. The output of the first search is then used as a priori information which determines the search strategy of the second and final search. The system is compared with well known active acquisition systems and results in a large improvement in the mean acquisition time. Its performance is evaluated in Gaussian and fading Rayleigh channels...|$|E

Excellent performance for the feed and antenna in both bands has been achieved. Other applications ofthe feed with appropriate modifications for dielectric-lens antennas, ADE (displaced-axis elliptical) antennas, and compact eleetronic-Iobing antennas are also d 4 cussed.

I N THE MODERN WORLD, we have all encountered many communications and radar terminals (1, 2] and have therefore glimpsed profiles of big and small antenna dishes. But we rarely have the chance to see any details ofthe feeds ofthe antennas. In theory, we can design an antenna feed simply by applying the wellknown Maxwell equations with the appropriate boundary conditions. In practice, however, only the simplest antenna reeds operating in a single frequency band can be analyzed this way. Indeed, the development of compact, high-pelformance, dual-band antenna feeds presents a number of challenges: boundary conditions involving both dielectric and conductingmaterials, multi-frequencyband operation, and the inclusion ofswitching diodes in the feed aperture all might need to be considered. Furthermore, the design ofsuch feeds is, at best, an inexact science that requires experience and expertise in electronic circuits, electromagnetics, and antennas.
