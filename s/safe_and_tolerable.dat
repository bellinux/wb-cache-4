No clinically significant changes in vital signs or worsening of extrapyramidal symptoms were reported in association with LY-2140023 use during an initial phase II clinical trial. However, a second, multicenter study reported four patients experiencing convulsions, suggesting a potential for increased risk of seizures during treatment. A long-term study found that there was no statistically significant difference in the time to discontinuation of use due to lack of tolerability between patients using LY-2140023 and other antipsychotic medications.|$|E

50|$|Due to its {{selectivity}} for ERβ, WAY-200070 is inactive {{in various}} assays of classic estrogen action, such as uterotrophic and osteopenia.

In fact, ERβ activation may actually suppress breast growth, and in accordance with this, WAY-200070 was shown to augment the efficacy of tamoxifen in in vitro models of breast cancer.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Multi-site {{repetitive}} {{transcranial magnetic stimulation}} (rTMS) {{has been}} applied experimentally {{in the treatment of}} obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). NEW METHOD: This study was conducted to systematically evaluate the safety, tolerability and neurocognitive effects of rTMS applied to three cortical regions over a period of three months. NEW METHOD: Twenty healthy participants aged 22 - 33 years were randomly allocated to receive one session of active or sham stimulation of low and high frequency rTMS applied sequentially to the pre-supplementary motor area, right-dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and left-orbitofrontal cortex totalling 9 min. Tolerability and safety was evaluated using a standardised safety questionnaire. Neurocognitive functioning was examined using the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery and measures of verbal fluency from the Delis-Kaplan Executive Functioning Test™ at five time points over three months. RESULTS: The protocol was <b>safe</b> <b>and</b> <b>tolerable.</b> Frequencies of minor adverse effects were higher in active (17 endorsements) than sham (1 endorsement) conditions. No between group differences in neurocognitive functioning were identified over three months. COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHOD: This study is the first to evaluate the feasibility of low and high frequency parameters applied sequentially in a single session to the three selected cortical regions whilst providing neurocognitive data. CONCLUSIONS: rTMS applied sequentially over three cortical regions was found to be <b>safe</b> <b>and</b> <b>tolerable</b> in healthy individuals with no major neurocognitive effects over three months.

25|$|Flutamide, another {{frequently}} used antiandrogen which is nonsteroidal and a pure androgen blocker, though much less potent by weight and binding affinity than either spironolactone or cyproterone acetate, {{has been found}} to be more effective than either of them as an antiandrogen when it is used at the typical treatment doses.
