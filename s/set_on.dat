40|$|We {{report on}} the {{fabrication}} and electrical characterization of etched graphene single electron transistors (SETs) of various sizes on hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) in high magnetic fields. The electronic transport measurements show a slight improvement compared to graphene <b>SETs</b> <b>on</b> SiO 2. In particular, <b>SETs</b> <b>on</b> hBN are more stable {{under the influence of}} perpendicular magnetic fields up to 9 [*]T in contrast to measurements reported <b>on</b> <b>SETs</b> <b>on</b> SiO 2. This result indicates a reduced surface disorder potential in <b>SETs</b> <b>on</b> hBN, which might be an important step toward clean and more controllable graphene quantum dots (QDs) ...|$|R

The interrelationship mining enable us to extract characteristics based on comparison between values of different attributes.

40|$|Anti-convex fuzzy <b>set</b> based <b>on</b> invex <b>set</b> and its related {{properties}} were researched, and anti-convex {{fuzzy set}} and some {{results in the}} related references were generalized. By applying thought of invex set to anti-convex fuzzy set, a new generalized anti-convex fuzzy set called anti-convex fuzzy <b>set</b> based <b>on</b> invex <b>set</b> was proposed. Let A∈F(Rn), andA is called Anti-convex fuzzy <b>set</b> based <b>on</b> invex <b>set,</b> whereη:Rn×Rn→Rn, and A(y+αη(x,y)) ≤A(x) ∨A(y),x,y∈Rn,α∈［ 0, 1 ］. Then, the relation between anti-convex fuzzy set and anti-convex fuzzy <b>set</b> based <b>on</b> invex <b>set</b> was discussed. If η(x,y) =x－y, then anti-convex fuzzy <b>set</b> based <b>on</b> invex <b>set</b> was degenerated into anti-convex fuzzy set, and obviously, anti-convex fuzzy set was made particular case of anti-convex fuzzy <b>set</b> based <b>on</b> invex <b>set.</b> Anti-convex fuzzy <b>set</b> based <b>on</b> invex <b>set</b> was not anti-convex fuzzy set by building an example, and anti-convex fuzzy <b>set</b> based <b>on</b> invex <b>set</b> was a true generalization of anti-convex fuzzy <b>set.</b> Thirdly, based <b>on</b> the definition of anti-convex fuzzy <b>set</b> based <b>on</b> invex <b>set,</b> the properties about the union and denseness of anti-convex fuzzy <b>set</b> based <b>on</b> invex <b>set</b> and the condition for fuzzy sets to be anti-convex fuzzy <b>set</b> based <b>on</b> invex <b>set</b> were studied. Lastly, similarly to ant-convex fuzzy <b>set</b> based <b>on</b> invex <b>set,</b> the conditions for fuzzy set to be strongly anti-convex fuzzy <b>set</b> based <b>on</b> invex <b>set</b> and strictly anti-convex fuzzy <b>set</b> based <b>on</b> invex <b>set</b> fuzzy sets were respectively studied...|$|R
