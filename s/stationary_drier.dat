The height of layer for drying was one meter in all silos. After drying the grains were stored in bulk in their own silos, where they were drying out. Subsequently, at intervals of 3 months were carried out following physical chemical analysis: 1000 grain weight, volumetric weight, moisture, crude protein, ether extract, ash and carbohydrates. The drying of the grains was conducted with air flow of 2. 52 m 3. s- 1, the average air temperature during drying with natural air was 17 °C, during drying with air natural heated with LPG was 22 °C. The average air drying naturally was 48 hours, while for drying with warm air naturally with LPG was 34 hours. Grains of corn were harvested with moisture content of 31. 88 % and then dried with natural air to reach 15. 70 % moisture and air heated with natural LPG up 13. 39 % moisture. Based on the results we can conclude that: 1. The drying with natural air heated with LPG was faster than air drying in natural conditions of the study; 2. In conditions of high humidity and low temperature drying with natural air should be performed with care due to the equilibrium moisture content; 3. The two drying methods are feasible in terms of quality, but the losses of crude protein, lipid and carbohydrates were higher during the first six months of storage in dry grains with natural air; 4. The natural air drying can be an excellent alternative and low cost to small farmers to dry grain.

Para tanto, além das determinações das temperaturas e dos teores de água da massa, foi avaliado o desempenho fisiológico das sementes no início e ao final de seis meses de armazenamento. Apesar das vantagens físicas operacionais resultantes da combinação entre o fluxo e a temperatura intermediários (28, 4 m³/minuto/t e 46 ºC), a qualidade fisiológica foi menos prejudicada nas combinações dos menores fluxos (26, 9 e 28, 4 m³/minuto/t) com a maior temperatura (50 ºC) e do maior fluxo (33, 2 m³/minuto/t) com as menores temperaturas (42 e 46 ºC); entre estas, levando em conta os aspectos físico-operacionais, a associação de 28, 4 m³/minuto/t com 50 ºC foi a mais eficiente na retirada de água das sementes. Assim, admitindo os intervalos de fluxo (26, 9 a 33, 2 m³/minuto/t) e de temperatura (42 a 50 ºC) estudados, conclui-se que a elevação na temperatura demanda redução no fluxo e, inversamente, o aumento no fluxo demanda redução na temperatura.

Besides temperature and moisture content of seed mass, physiological seed quality was evaluated at the beginning and after a period of six months storage. Although the combination of the intermediates air flow and temperature (28. 4 m³/minute/ton and 46 ºC) had been physically advantageous, the seed quality was less impaired by the combinations of the smaller air flows (26. 9 and 28. 4 m³/minute/ton) with the highest temperature (50 ºC) and the highest air flow (33. 2 m³/minute/ton) with the smaller temperatures (42 and 46 ºC). Among those, the association of 28. 4 m³/min/ton with 50 ºC was the most efficient in the watertaking of seeds. Thus, admitting the air flow intervals between 26. 9 and 33. 2 m³/minute/ton and temperature from 42 to 50 ºC, it is possible to conclude that increasing of air flow requests decreasing of temperature, and increasing of temperature requests decreasing of the air flow...|$|R

40|$|The {{influence}} of substrate, light intensity, temperature and growth phase {{on the dry}} weight per unit biovolume of both living Phormidium autumnale trichomes and living single cells was investigated microinterferometrically. With a Mach-Zehnder Interference Microscope, both the interference-stripe-field method and the phase-shift method were {{used to measure the}} optical path differences (OPD) of cells and trichomes. To calculate the cellular dry weight of trichomes, the trichome diameters have to be measured. Widths between 4 and 7 µm were determined. Thick trichomes are characteristic for growth on agar-solidified medium, whereas this was observed in single cases only from trichomes growing on soil surfaces. A reliable prediction of trichome width from growth conditions is not possible. The dry weights per unit biovolume (fg µm- 3) are independent of the studied parameters during the exponential growth phase (296 ± 22 fg µm- 3) with exception of the agar-based cultures growing at low light intensity (259 ± 16 fg µm- 3). During the <b>stationary</b> phase, <b>dry</b> weights per unit biovolume increase independently of growth conditions (353 ± 39 fg µm- 3). Two separate factors of 0. 14 and 0. 17 for converting biovolume (mm 3) of cells to milligrams carbon could be determined by comparing the growth phase and stationary phase-dependent average values of dry weights per unit biovolume, respectively. These conversion factors could be used as species-specific factors for Phormidium growing on soil surfaces. Irrespective of the method, both the stripe-field and phase-shift method gave similar results. However, the phase-shift method measured lower variances of values. Additionally, detailed quantifying investigations of structures within cells are possible. Thus, the phase-shift method could be a powerful analytical tool in, e. g., ecotoxicological monitoring analyses...|$|R

This reduced it to lime from which could be mixed with ashes, straw or gravel and made into a white or grey lime plaster. The plaster was initially so soft {{that it could be}} moulded, before hardening through air drying into a rigid cement. The plaster was formed into vessels by coiling to serve some of the functions of later clay pottery. White Ware vessels tended to be rather large and coarse, often found in the dwelling rooms where they were made indicating their use for <b>stationary</b> storage of <b>dry</b> goods. Designs included a range of large and heavy rectangular tubs, circular vessels and smaller bowls, cups and jars. Imprints of basketry on the exterior of some vessels suggest that some were shaped into large basket shapes. It is likely these larger vessels were mainly used for dry goods storage. Some of the White Ware vessels found were decorated with incisions and thick stripes of red ochre. Other uses of this material included plastering of skulls and as a floor or wall covering. Some lime plaster floors were also painted red, and a few were found with designs imprinted on them.|$|R
40|$|Perillyl {{derivatives}} {{are increasingly}} important {{due to their}} flavouring and antimicrobial properties {{as well as their}} potential as anticancer agents. These terpenoid species, which are present in limited amounts in plants, may be obtained via bioconversion of selected monoterpene hydrocarbons. In this study, seventeen yeast strains were screened for their ability to oxidize the exocyclic methyl group in the p-menthene moiety of limonene into perillic acid. Of the yeast tested, the highest efficiency was observed for Yarrowia lipolytica ATCC 18942. The conversion of R (+) -limonene by Y. lipolytica was evaluated by varying the pH (3 to 8) and the temperature (25 to 30 ºC) in a reaction medium containing 0. 5 % v/v limonene and 10 gµL of <b>stationary</b> phase cells (<b>dry</b> weight). The best results, corresponding to 564 mgµL of perillic acid, were obtained in buffered medium at pH 7. 1 that was incubated at 25 ºC for 48 h. The stepwise addition of limonene increased the perillic acid concentration by over 50 %, reaching 855 mgµL, whereas the addition of glucose or surfactant to the reaction medium did not improve the bioconversion process. The use of Y. lipolytica showed promise for ease of further downstream processing, as perillic acid was the sole oxidised product of the bioconversion reaction. Moreover, bioprocesses using safe and easy to cultivate yeast cells have been favoured in industry...|$|R
40|$|Effects {{of speed}} and the {{duration}} of grain filling and the accumulation of the assimilates of the stem in developing the durum wheat yield (Triticum durum Desf.) in the culture conditions of the high plains of eastern Algeria. The present study was led on the experimental site of station ITGC in Setif. The objective {{is to determine the}} differences of duration and speed of filling and the contribution of the assimilates of the stems to the yield of 5 durum wheat genotypes (Triticum durum Desf.). The year effect is significant, what explains the fluctuation of the conditions of one growth year to another. The grain yield is associated to the great quantity of assimilates stored and transferred from the stems to the grain filling. The Mbb genotype which has an important stem height transfers more assimilates. The genotypes ADS 497 and Deraa present large standard leaves. The beginning of the active phase of the grain filling corresponds {{to the beginning of the}} foliar senescence. Mbb presents a slower foliar drying rate, the speed of <b>drying</b> <b>stationary</b> recorded by ADS 497 is of - 0. 5957 cm 2 per day. The speed of grain filling is negatively related to the duration of filling. The participation of the assimilates coming from the stem decreases when the environment allows the expression of a better grain yield...|$|R
40|$|Large {{cyclonic}} eddies on {{the northern}} edge of the Florida Current are the dominant mesoscale features within the southern Straits of Florida. The most prominent of these features is a quasi-stationary eddy that forms near the Dry Tortugas. Our observations, compiled from 3 years of advanced very high resolution radiometer measurements in the Straits of Florida and Gulf of Mexico, demonstrate a strong relationship between the generation of anticyclonic rings from the Gulf of Mexico Loop Current and the evolution of Tortugas eddies within the southern Straits of Florida. In six cases, Tortugas eddies evolve from cyclonic frontal eddies which form along the boundary of the Loop Current. The eddies remain <b>stationary</b> near the <b>Dry</b> Tortugas until they are impacted by an approaching Loop Current frontal eddy. The length of time an eddy spends near the Dry Tortugas is increased when the Loop Current sheds an anticyclonic ring. The involvement of a Loop Current frontal eddy in the ring-shedding process results in a delay in its, and hence the Tortugas eddy 2 ̆ 7 s, downstream propagation. Results suggest that the lifetime of a Tortugas eddy can be as long as 140 days when a ring-shedding event occurs, or as short as 50 days {{in the absence of any}} ring-shedding events. Upon entering the Straits of Florida, the Tortugas eddies are deformed by the narrowing topography and shrink to approximately 55...|$|R

Animal Feed Science and Technology, 123 - 124, 225 - 241 A {{study was conducted}} to estimate variation among laboratories and between manual and automated techniques of measuring pressure on the resulting gas production profiles (GPP). Eight feeds (molassed sugarbeet feed, grass silage, maize silage, soyabean hulls, maize gluten feed, whole crop wheat silage, wheat, glucose) were milled to pass a 1 mm screen and sent to three laboratories (ADAS Nutritional Sciences Research Unit, UK; Institute of Grassland and Environmental Research (IGER), UK; Wageningen University, The Netherlands). Each laboratory measured GPP over 144 h using standardised procedures with manual pressure transducers (MPT) and automated pressure systems (APS). The APS at ADAS used a pressure transducer and bottles in a shaking water bath, while the APS at Wageningen and IGER used a pressure sensor and bottles held in a <b>stationary</b> rack.

40|$|We {{find that}} Mycobacterium smegmatis survives spray drying and retains cell {{viability}} in accelerated temperature stress (40 °C) conditions with a success rate that increases with increasing thermal, osmotic, and nutrient-restriction stresses {{applied to the}} mycobacterium prior to spray drying. M. smegmatis that are spray dried during log growth phase, where they suffer little or no nutrient-reduction stress, survive for less than 7 days in the dry powder state at accelerated temperature stress conditions, whereas M. smegmatis that are spray <b>dried</b> during <b>stationary</b> phase, where cells do suffer nutrient reduction, survive for up to 14 days. M. smegmatis that are spray <b>dried</b> from <b>stationary</b> phase, subjected to accelerated temperature stress conditions, regrown to <b>stationary</b> phase, spray <b>dried</b> again, and resubmitted to this same process four consecutive times, display, on the fourth spray drying iteration, an approximate ten-fold increase in stability during accelerated temperature stress testing, surviving up to 105 days. Microarray tests revealed significant differences in genetic expression of M. smegmatis between log phase and stationary phase conditions, between naïve (non spray-dried) and multiply cycled dried M. smegmatis (in log and stationary phase), and between M. smegmatis in the dry powder state following a single spray drying operation and after four consecutive spray drying operations. These differences, and other phenotypical differences, point to the carotenoid biosynthetic pathway as a probable pathway contributing to bacteria survival in the spray-dried state and suggests strategies for spray drying {{that may lead to}} significantly greater room-temperature stability of mycobacteria, including mycobacterium bovis bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG), the current TB vaccine...|$|R
40|$|The {{characterisation}} of foaming {{in plant}} cell cultures was investigated using Monnda citnfoha, {{as a test}} organism Suspensions were cultivated in 250 ml shake flasks, {{over the course of}} 21 day batch growth cycles, and were characterised in terms of biomass concentration, conductivity, morphology, pH and metabolite production (extracellular proteins and extracellular polysaccharides (ECP)). The Theological and surface tension profiles of the cell-free broths were assessed, with a view to understanding the influence o f these characteristics on foaming behaviour. A bubble column, to investigate the foaming potential of cell-free broths, was designed and validated. A preliminary study was performed, to monitor the ability of a silicone antifoam to suppress foaming and to investigate its influence on culture growth and productivity. Image analysis-based morphological studies showed that the distributions of chains and cells m these suspensions are log-normal. A linear relationship was identified between conductivity and biomass concentration, expressed in terms of fresh weight and cell number, however, this relationship was only apparent up to the <b>stationary</b> phase, for <b>dry</b> weight measurements Metabolite production was strongly growth-associated. The viscosity of the broth was found to increase with culture age and was successfully correlated with ECP production Surface tension was observed to reach a minimum during {{the early stages of the}} growth cycle and to remain relatively stable for the remainder of the growth cycle. These variations were attributed to extracellular proteins. Foammess characterisation studies in both cell-free broths and in model systems (using BSA and xanthan gum) revealed that foammess was greatly influenced by proteins, polysaccharides and nature of the suspending fluid. Foammess in medium-based solutions was significantly greater than in comparable aqueous-based solutions. The antifoam employed was compatible with this suspension culture, when cultivated in shake flasks and was effective in suppressing foam formation during foaming experiments in the bubble column...|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Most probiotic products are dairy-based and require refrigeration, but there are currently no spray dried probiotic powders sold commercially today. The aim {{of this research is}} to develop instant cereal beverage using an oat-based formulation containing the probiotic organism Lactobacillus acidophilus. Escherichia coli K 12 was initially used as a reference Gram negative microorganism to compare with the Gram positive L. acidophilus. The work started with the examination of growth to determine the timings required to harvest cells in the mid-log phase and the early-stationary phase of both bacteria. Spray only experiments were then performed which showed that atomisation itself did not cause any significant effect on cell survival of either cultures, either in the mid-log or early-stationary phases. The spray drying experiments found that cells harvested in the early-stationary phase had a greater heat resistance than those cultured in their mid-log phase at the same outlet temperature. It was also found that the higher the drying outlet temperature, the lower was the cell survival rate. The best survival rates were found when spray drying at drying outlet temperatures lower than 80 °C. E coli K 12 was found to have a lower level of survival than L. acidophilus especially when spray dried with maltodextrin without culture broth components present. This {{can be attributed to the}} much thinner cell wall of the Gram negative E coli K 12 bacterium. The optimal growth phase (early <b>stationary)</b> and spray <b>drying</b> outlet temperature (80 °C) were then taken forward in to the next study for L. acidophilus when various combinations and ratios of proteins (either whey protein, isolated soy protein or skim milk) and sugars (either maltose, lactose or fructose), and maltodextrin were tested. Cell survival rates after spray drying were tested after rehydrating in phosphate buffer solution (PBS), simulated gastric juice (SGI) or 2...|$|R

GPP were fitted to a modified Michaelis-Menten model assuming a single phase of gas production, and GPP were described in terms of the asymptotic volume of gas produced (A), the time to half A (B), the time of maximum gas production rate (t(RM) (gas)) and maximum gas production rate (R-M (gas)). There were effects (P< 0. 001) of substrate on all parameters. However, MPT produced more (P< 0. 001) gas, but with longer (P< 0. 001) B and t(RM gas) (P< 0. 05) and lower (P< 0. 001) R-M gas compared to APS. There was no difference between apparatus in ADDM estimates. Interactions occurred between substrate and apparatus, substrate and laboratory, and laboratory and apparatus. However, when mean values for MPT were regressed from the individual laboratories, relationships were good (i. e., adjusted R- 2 = 0. 827 or higher). Good relationships were also observed with APS, although they were weaker than for MPT (i. e., adjusted R- 2 = 0. 723 or higher). The relationships between mean MPT and mean APS data were also good (i. e., adjusted R 2 = 0. 844 or higher). Data suggest that, although laboratory and method of measuring pressure are sources of variation in GPP estimation, it should be possible using appropriate mathematical models to standardise data among laboratories so that data from one laboratory could be extrapolated to others. This would allow development of a database of GPP data from many diverse feeds. (c) 2005 Published by Elsevier B. V...|$|R
40|$|The {{need for}} snow-free {{surfaces}} at squares, bus stops, platforms, car parks and sports facilities increases {{and at the}} same time energy price rise and the environment is becoming a hotter issue. The construction of the ground heating systems often lack thermal insulation under the heating pipes, which means that the heat from the pipes not only warm up the soil surface but also heats the surrounding soil. The insulation also has more features, by insulating the risk of frost damage is minimized. The goal of this report is to demonstrate the large heat loss and energy costs in the absence of insulation under the heating system. The report begins with a scientific way to study and treating the soil heating system uses, and the theory involved. Furthermore it also deals with different routing principles of heat pipes depending on the facility. All calculations are made with so called finite element method (FEM), in COMSOL Multiphysics 3, 5 a, where models are created with different conditions. These models are then compared to the models but with insulation. The difference is noted and further analysis is done on the results. The conditions, on which the calculations are based on, are 100 mm insulation. The surface is estimated to be 8000 square meters which corresponds to the size of a football field and the time the heating systems is assumed to be started is 3240 and 1296 hours depending on the model calculated. - The models are divided into a <b>stationary</b> model, a <b>dry</b> dynamic model, a partially dry dynamic model and then a wet dynamic model. The differences between these are partly the time they are running, but also the certain conditions and properties of the materials and how the control of heat flow in the pipes is made. The findings in the report show that it is economically viable to isolate sports facilities based on today's energy prices, and the investment cost insulation entails. The results also show the relatively large differences in energy consumption in each case depending on whether the construction has or lacks insulation. Despite the large investment costs estimated payback period for the investment based on a 8000 m 2 surface with an operating time of 3240 and 1296 hours/year to be in 25 years, while the heat pipes is expected to last for about 50 years...|$|R
