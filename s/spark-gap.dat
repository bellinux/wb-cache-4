25|$|In a dual {{resonant}} solid-state Tesla coil (DRSSTC), {{the electronic}} switching of the solid-state Tesla coil {{is combined with}} the resonant primary circuit of a <b>spark-gap</b> Tesla coil. The resonant primary circuit is formed by connecting a capacitor in series with the primary winding of the coil, so that the combination forms a series tank circuit with a resonant frequency near that of the secondary circuit. Because of the additional resonant circuit, one manual and one adaptive tuning adjustment are necessary. Also, an interrupter is usually used to reduce the duty cycle of the switching bridge, to improve peak power capabilities; similarly, IGBTs are more popular in this application than bipolar transistors or MOSFETs, due to their superior power handling characteristics. A current-limiting circuit is usually used to limit maximum primary tank current (which must be switched by the IGBT's) to a safe level. Performance of a DRSSTC can be comparable to a medium-power <b>spark-gap</b> Tesla coil, and efficiency (as measured by spark length versus input power) can be significantly greater than a <b>spark-gap</b> Tesla coil operating at the same input power.|$|E
25|$|High {{frequency}} (HF) {{services were}} introduced in 1927, allowing messages to penetrate globally. The most important use was reaching fishing vessels in the Antarctic and increased the use of private telegrams by seamen. Implementation was slow: by 1935 HF transmitters had been installed on about 100 Norwegian ships, and 450 ships by 1940. Wireless telephony was introduced at Bergen Radio in 1931 and by 1939 the service covered the entire coast. In 1940 there were 70 communities which had their telephone network connected to the national network by wireless transmission. From 1927 new <b>spark-gap</b> transmitters over 300watts were not permitted and all such transmitters had to be phased out by 1940. Implementation of vacuum tube transmitters was slow: by 1937, 600 of 1000 Norwegian ships with a ship radio still had <b>spark-gap</b> transmitters. The coast stations all received vacuum tube transmitters by 1935.|$|E
25|$|Crystal {{radio was}} invented by a long, partly obscure chain of discoveries in the late 19th century that {{gradually}} evolved into more and more practical radio receivers in the early 20th century. The earliest practical use of crystal radio was to receive Morse code radio signals transmitted, from <b>spark-gap</b> transmitters, by early amateur radio experimenters. As electronics evolved, the ability to send voice signals by radio caused a technological explosion in the years around 1920 that evolved into today's radio broadcasting industry.|$|E
40|$|Purpose of work - to {{find out}} the {{presence}} of cross-correlation intercommunications between the indexes of general physical preparedness and dependence of their structure from the level of sporting qualification of sportsmen. 66 sportsmen took part in research. From them 35 are sportsmen of I-II of digits, 31 are highly skilled sportsmen. Sportsmen executed 14 tests which characterize the level of general physical preparedness. For the sportsmen of <b>spark-gaps</b> found out 15 reliable cross-correlation intercommunications of direct (10) and reverse (5) character. For skilled sportsmen - 18 : (9) direct and (9) reverse character. For the sportsmen of <b>spark-gaps</b> the most of reliable intercommunications is set between spray force (6) and explosive force of feet (5). At skilled - between figure (7) and spray (6) force and other indexes. The presence of direct cross-correlation intercommunications between physical qualities testifies about expedience of their complex development in one training employment. Reverse - about the necessity of the differentiated development of such physical qualities...|$|R
40|$|In 1967 the {{capacitor}} bank {{was extended to}} an energy of 1, 2 MJoules and a crowbar system has been installed. A survey of the bank characteristics and of the safety principles which were followed is presented. The probability of breakdowns in a system where currents of some 10 MA are flowing was decreased by dividing the bank and the collector, which is of the multi-plate type, in elements. The danger resulting from prefiring and misfiring of start-gaps has been eliminated by charging rapidly the master-trigger generator at theend of the charging cycle and by increasing the corresponding capacity. Initially, a rather complicated electronic current monitoring system was installed. The reliable operation of the start-gaps allowed one to simplify later the set-up: the potential differences between units are followed, indicating directly {{the location of the}} eventually defective start-gap. Each crowbar-gap was provided with a fast acting current-detector. When a prefire occurs, all the remaining crowbar-gaps are triggered almost instantaneously. By keeping the transit times as short as possible, the delay has been reduced to 1 μsec. Defects in the electronic master control system could lead to a misfire of the whole crowbar system and eventually to the destruction of the discharge tube. A second slightly slower trigger path, using delay lines and <b>spark-gaps</b> exclusively, was built in. The charging voltages of <b>spark-gaps</b> and thyratrons in the crowbar trigger system are monitored: if they are missing, a blocking signal is transmitted into the master control system...|$|R
40|$|Necessity to {{preserve}} the continuity of service and electric supply demands special attention towards protection of transmission lines and power apparatus from over voltages. Lightning arresters are devices used at sub-stations and at line terminations to discharge these over voltages, more particularly lightning surges and switching surges. The arresters installed today are almost all metal- oxide (MO) arresters without gaps. The distinctive feature of MO resistors is its extremely non-linear voltage characteristics, rendering unnecessary the disconnection of the resistors from the line through serial <b>spark–gaps</b> earlier used with Sic resistors. “Ref.

25|$|In {{addition}} to its use in <b>spark-gap</b> radio transmitters and electrotherapy described above, the Tesla coil circuit was also used in the early 20th century in x-ray machines, ozone generators for water purification, and induction heating equipment. However, in the 1920s vacuum tube oscillators replaced it in all these applications. The triode vacuum tube was a much better radio frequency current generator than the noisy, hot, ozone-producing spark, and could produce continuous waves. After this, industrial use of the Tesla coil was mainly limited to a few specialized applications which were suited to its unique characteristics, such as high voltage insulation testing.|$|E
25|$|As {{early as}} 1886, German {{physicist}} Heinrich Hertz showed that radio waves could be reflected from solid objects. In 1895, Alexander Popov, a physics {{instructor at the}} Imperial Russian Navy school in Kronstadt, developed an apparatus using a coherer tube for detecting distant lightning strikes. The next year, he added a <b>spark-gap</b> transmitter. In 1897, while testing this equipment for communicating between two ships in the Baltic Sea, he took note of an interference beat caused by {{the passage of a}} third vessel. In his report, Popov wrote that this phenomenon might be used for detecting objects, but he did nothing more with this observation.|$|E
25|$|Plans for {{a direct}} {{connection}} between Scandinavia and the United States was launched in 1910. Prices on transatlantic telegrams were high because of transit fares and made Norway dependent on foreign cable companies. A sea cable was estimated to cost between 30 and 40 million Norwegian krone (NOK), while a wireless connection proposed in 1912 was estimated to cost 2 million. Early estimates showed that the project would not be profitable. The plans were passed in Parliament, but because of a slight delay, construction was placed on hold during World War I (1914–1918), and Stavanger Radio did not open until 1919. The <b>spark-gap</b> transmitter created interference with other American radio stations and was soon out of date. A new NOK1.5-million vacuum tube transmitter was installed in 1922 and the receiver station, originally at Nærbø, was moved to Fornebu in 1925. Jeløy Radio was created a few year later and Stavanger Radio was closed.|$|E

40|$|As pulsed-power systems used {{to drive}} EM {{launchers}} evolve from laboratory to operational environments, high-power solid-state devices are emerging as the leading switch technology for these systems. These devices, specifically high-power thyristors and diodes, offer the advantages of improved energy efficiency, reduced volume, and reduced auxiliaries over <b>spark-gaps</b> and ignitrons. Proper application of these devices requires understanding of their behavior both during forward conduction and during reverse recovery. The semiconductor device models available in most circuit simulation software packages do not accurately characterize large power thyristors and diodes for thermal management and snubber design. A semiconductor-device model is presented that captures device reverse-recovery and on-state conduction behavior utilizing a time-varying resistance {{that depends on the}} solid-state device properties and operating circuit parameters. The information needed to construct this model can be extracted from the device datasheet or obtained from the manufacturer. This circuit model is used to analyze pulsed-power circuits typically {{used to drive}} railguns. Of key interest in these simulations are the voltage transients and energy losses in the solid-state devices during the reverse-recovery process. This behavior is analyzed for different circuit element values and device parameters such as peak reverse current, and reverse recovery charge...|$|R

He traced its inspiration to 1900, when, experimenting with a <b>spark-gap</b> transmitter, he briefly thought that the flickering of a nearby gas flame might be in response to electromagnetic pulses. With further tests he soon determined that the cause of the flame fluctuations actually was due to air pressure changes produced by the loud sound of the spark.

2500|$|The German {{inventor}} Christian Hülsmeyer was {{the first}} to use radio waves to detect [...] "the presence of distant metallic objects". [...] In 1904, he demonstrated the feasibility of detecting a ship in dense fog, but not its distance from the transmitter. He obtained a patent for his detection device in April 1904 and later a patent for a related amendment for estimating the distance to the ship. He also got a British patent on September 23, 1904 for a full radar system, that he called a telemobiloscope. It operated on a 50cm wavelength and the pulsed radar signal was created via a <b>spark-gap.</b> [...] His system already used the classic antenna setup of horn antenna with parabolic reflector and was presented to German military officials in practical tests in Cologne and Rotterdam harbour but was rejected.|$|E
2500|$|German {{physicist}} Heinrich Hertz {{constructed the}} world's first parabolic reflector antenna in 1888.

[...] Its aperture was 2 meters high by 1.2 meters wide, with a focal length of 0.12 meters, and was used at an operating frequency of about 450MHz. [...] With two such antennas, one used for transmitting {{and the other for}} receiving, Hertz demonstrated the existence of radio waves which had been predicted by James Clerk Maxwell some 22 years earlier. [...] However, the early development of radio [...] was limited to lower frequencies at which parabolic antennas were unsuitable, and they were not widely used until after World War 2, when microwave frequencies began to be exploited.|$|E
2500|$|As {{early as}} 1839, the German {{mathematician}} and physicist Carl Friedrich Gauss postulated that an electrically conducting {{region of the}} atmosphere could account for observed variations of Earth's magnetic field. Sixty years later, Guglielmo Marconi received the first trans-Atlantic radio signal on December 12, 1901, in St. John's, Newfoundland (now in Canada) using a [...] kite-supported antenna for reception. The transmitting station in Poldhu, Cornwall, used a <b>spark-gap</b> transmitter to produce a signal with a frequency of approximately 500kHz and a power of 100 times more than any radio signal previously produced. The message received was three dits, the Morse code for the letter S. To reach Newfoundland the signal would have to bounce off the ionosphere twice. Dr. Jack Belrose has contested this, however, based on theoretical and experimental work. However, Marconi did achieve transatlantic wireless communications in Glace Bay, Nova Scotia, one year later.|$|E
