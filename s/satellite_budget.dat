50|$|The {{cellular}} {{look down}} antenna has 48 spot beams arranged as 16 beams in three sectors. The four inter-satellite cross links on each satellite operate at 10 Mbit/s. Optical links could have supported {{a much greater}} bandwidth and a more aggressive growth path, but microwave cross links were chosen because their bandwidth was more than sufficient for the desired system. Nevertheless, a parallel optical cross link option was carried through a critical design review, and ended when the microwave cross links were shown to support the size, weight and power requirements allocated within the individual <b>satellite's</b> <b>budget.</b> Iridium <b>Satellite</b> LLC has stated that their second generation satellites would also use microwave, not optical, inter-satellite communications links. Such cross-links are unique in the satellite telephone industry, as other providers do not relay data between satellites; Globalstar and Inmarsat both use a bent-pipe architecture without cross-links.|$|R
40|$|Successive radiometers {{have been}} flown on {{spacecraft}} for {{measurement of the}} radiation bud-get of the Earth and to date have provided data sets which overlap in time over a 25 -year period.

25|$|The {{terrestrial}} carrier is an OFDM QPSK signal, {{cousin to}} WiMax and LTE, with {{the particular feature}} {{that more than one}} transmitter operates on the same frequency, forming a single frequency network. A number of transmitters can be placed around a city to create coverage that is less subject to fading than if a single transmitter were used. The satellite signal is QPSK. Both satellite and terrestrial signals have hierarchical modulation superposed on the original signal, a measure created to add bandwidth at a small expense in the <b>satellite</b> link <b>budget</b> for decoding the core audio content.|$|R
40|$|A time {{variable}} model of Earth's albedo {{was prepared for}} use in climate studies and {{as an aid to}} the interpretation of <b>satellite</b> Earth radiation <b>budget</b> data.

Percent cloud cover is specified for 29 different climatological cloud type regions at 8 times of the day for 12 months of the year. Cloud albedos were specified for each of the cloud climatological types. Diurnal and monthly variations of this model are described and results are compared with a model which is based on satellite measurements. A computer program was also written for use in studying the sampling effects in <b>satellite</b> radiation <b>budget</b> measurements.
