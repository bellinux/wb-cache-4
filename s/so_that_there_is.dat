5|$|On January 4, 2017, {{the office}} of New York Governor Andrew Cuomo {{announced}} a plan to renovate the entire airport {{at a cost of}} $7–10 billion. As part of the project, the AirTrain JFK would either see lengthened trainsets or a direct track connection to the rest of New York City's transportation system. There would also be a rebuilding the Jamaica station <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a direct connection to the Long Island Rail Road and New York City Subway. There is no proposed start date for the overhaul. Shortly after Cuomo's announcement, the Regional Plan Association published a study in which it studied a possible direct rail link from Manhattan. In July 2017, Cuomo's office began accepting proposals for master plans to renovate the airport.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} with the rich ornamentation of the main building, the galleries in the Sainsbury Wing are pared-down and intimate, to suit the smaller scale {{of many of the}} paintings. The main inspirations for these rooms are Sir John Soane's toplit galleries for the Dulwich Picture Gallery and the church interiors of Filippo Brunelleschi (the stone dressing is in pietra serena, the grey stone local to Florence). The northernmost galleries align with Barry's central axis, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a single vista down the whole length of the Gallery. This axis is exaggerated by the use of false perspective, as the columns flanking each opening gradually diminish in size until the visitor reaches the focal point (as of 2009), an altarpiece by Cima of The Incredulity of St Thomas. Venturi's postmodernist approach to architecture is in full evidence at the Sainsbury Wing, with its stylistic quotations from buildings as disparate as the clubhouses on Pall Mall, the Scala Regia in the Vatican, Victorian warehouses and Ancient Egyptian temples.|$|E

5|$|North of the station, tracks 7 and 6 {{merge into}} one track (with a switch from track 7 to track 8), tracks 5 through 2 merge into another track, and tracks 1 and 8 stay separate, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a four-tracked {{structure}} when the BMT West End Line and BMT Sea Beach Line cross the Coney Island Creek. Before the structure crosses the creek, all four tracks have switches that connect the tracks to each other, before the West End and Sea Beach Lines split. Tracks from these lines then lead into Coney Island Yard. South of the station, tracks 4, 5, and 6 stay {{separate from the}} other tracks (with a pair of switches between tracks 5 and 6) and tracks 1, 2, and 3 merge and have a diamond crossover with track 4. Tracks 3 and 4 (the Brighton Line tracks) are above tracks 5 and 6 (the Culver Line tracks) at this point.|$|E
5|$|The P90 was {{designed}} to have a length no greater than a man's shoulder width, {{to allow it to}} be easily carried and maneuvered in tight spaces, such as the inside of an armored vehicle. To achieve this, the weapon's design uses the unconventional bullpup configuration, in which the action and magazine are located behind the trigger and alongside the shooter's face <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> no wasted space in the stock. The P90's dimensions are minimized by its unique horizontally mounted feeding system, wherein the box magazine sits parallel to the barrel on top of the weapon's frame. The weapon overall has an extremely compact profile—it is the most compact fixed-stock submachine gun to be made. The standard version of the weapon has an overall length of 500mm (19.7in), a height of 210mm (8.3in), and a width of 55mm (2.2in).|$|E
5|$|The cookiecutter shark has an elongated, cigar-shaped {{body with}} a short, bulbously rounded snout. The {{nostrils}} have a very short flap of skin in front. The large, oval, green eyes are placed forward on the head, though not <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> extensive binocular vision. Behind the eyes are large spiracles, positioned on the upper surface of the head. The mouth is short, forming a nearly transverse line, and is surrounded by enlarged, fleshy, suctorial lips. There are 3037 tooth rows in the upper jaw and 2531 tooth rows in the lower jaw, increasing with body size. The upper and lower teeth are extremely different: the upper teeth are small, narrow, and upright, tapering to a single, smooth-edged cusp. The lower teeth are also smooth-edged, but much larger, broader, and knife-like, with their bases interlocking to form a single saw-like cutting edge. The five pairs of gill slits are small.|$|E

25|$|Venezuela is {{situated}} in an inter-tropical zone, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> very little temperature variance {{over the course of}} a year.

25|$|A pivot door, {{instead of}} hinges, is {{supported}} on a bearing {{some distance away}} from the edge, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> more or less of a gap on the pivot side {{as well as the}} opening side. In some cases the pivot is central, creating two equal openings.|$|E
25|$|For {{a market}} to be competitive, {{there must be}} more than a single buyer or seller. It has been {{suggested}} that two people may trade, but it takes at least three persons to have a market, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> competition in at least one of its two sides.|$|E

25|$|Track {{circuits}} {{can detect}} some {{but not all}} broken rails. Broken rails in switches may be in parallel paths, which cannot be detected. Breaks that are not clean breaks {{from top to bottom}} of the rail also cannot be detected. Wiring at the start and finish of track circuits are connected a short distance {{from the end of the}} rails, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a blind spot within which broken rails are not detected.|$|E
25|$|The cell {{suspension}} is entrained {{in the center}} of a narrow, rapidly flowing stream of liquid. The flow is arranged <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a large separation between cells relative to their diameter. A vibrating mechanism causes the stream of cells to break into individual droplets. The system is adjusted <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a low probability of more than one cell per droplet. Just before the stream breaks into droplets, the flow passes through a fluorescence measuring station where the fluorescent character of each cell of interest is measured. An electrical charging ring is placed just at the point where the stream breaks into droplets. A charge is placed on the ring based immediately prior to fluorescence intensity being measured, and the opposite charge is trapped on the droplet as it breaks from the stream. The charged droplets then fall through an electrostatic deflection system that diverts droplets into containers based upon their charge. In some systems, the charge is applied directly to the stream, and the droplet breaking off retains charge of the same sign as the stream. The stream is then returned to neutral after the droplet breaks off.|$|E
25|$|The {{competition}} {{winner was}} the Philadelphia-based architectural firm of Mitchell/Giurgola, with the on-site work {{directed by the}} Italian-born architect Romaldo Giurgola, with a design which involved burying most of the building under Capital Hill, and capping the edifice with an enormous spire topped by a large Australian flag. The façades, however, included deliberate imitation {{of some of the}} patterns of the Old Parliament House, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a slight resemblance despite the massive difference of scale.|$|E
