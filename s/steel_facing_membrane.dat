25|$|The {{magnetic}} feather {{board was}} developed in 1990. The patented Grip-Tite is held to a cast iron table top or steel sub fence by high strength permanent magnets. The advantage of a magnetic feather board is the fast setup time on any cast iron tool deck or <b>steel</b> <b>faced</b> fence. When {{used in conjunction with}} a <b>steel</b> <b>faced</b> rip fence, they are used to hold down ripped wood on any saw deck and prevent kickback. Feed wheels added to the Grip-Tite base pull ripped wood to the fence, allowing the operator to rip wood on any table saw with no hands near the blade.|$|R

50|$|In the 1960s, the {{building}} was refaced {{to give it a}} more modern look, covering the ornamented terracotta architectural details with a <b>steel</b> <b>facing.</b> This renovation was widely met with scorn from both local and national architectural critics.|$|R
40|$|The {{junctional}} <b>face</b> <b>membrane</b> plays a {{key role}} in excitation-contraction coupling in skeletal muscle. A protein of 350 kDa, tentatively identified as a component of the junctional feet, connects transverse tubules to terminal cisternae of sarcoplasmic reticulum [Kawamoto, Brunschwig, Kim & Caswell (1986) J. Cell Biol. 103, 1405 - 1414]. The membrane topology and protein composition of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca 2 +-release channels of rabbit skeletal muscle were investigated using an immunological approach, with anti-(junctional <b>face</b> <b>membrane)</b> and anti-(350 kDa protein) polyclonal antibodies. Upon preincubation of the terminal cisternae with anti-(junctional <b>face</b> <b>membrane)</b> antibodies, Ca 2 +-ATPase and Ca 2 +-loading activities were not affected, whereas anti-(350 kDa protein) antibodies stimulated Ca 2 +-ATPase activity by 25 % and inhibited Ca 2 +-loading activity by 50 % (at an antibody/terminal cisternae protein ratio of 1 : 1). Specific photolabelling of terminal cisternae proteins with [14 C]doxorubicin was prevented by both anti-(junctional <b>face</b> <b>membrane)</b> and anti-(350 kDa protein) antibodies. Stimulation of Ca 2 + release by doxorubicin was prevented by both anti-(junctional <b>face</b> <b>membrane)</b> and anti-(350 kDa protein) antibodies. Half-maximal inhibition was obtained at an antibody/terminal cisternae protein ratio of 1 : 1. Kinetic measurements of Ca 2 + release indicated that anti-(350 kDa protein) antibodies prevented Ca 2 +-induced Ca 2 + release, whereas the ATP-stimulation and the inhibition by Mg 2 + were not affected. These results suggest that: (i) Ca 2 +- and doxorubicin-induced Ca 2 + release is mediated by Ca 2 + channels which are selectively localized in the junctional face membrane; (ii) the 350 kDa protein is a component of the Ca 2 +-release channel in native terminal cisternae vesicles; and (iii) the Ca 2 +-activating site of the channel is separate from other allosteric site...|$|R
50|$|The {{wrought iron}} <b>steel</b> <b>faced</b> anvil was {{produced}} {{up until the}} early 20th century. Through the 19th and very early 20th centuries, this method of construction evolved to produce extremely high quality anvils. The basic process involved forge-welding billets of wrought iron together to produce the desired shape. The sequence and location of the forge-welds varied between different anvil makers {{and the kind of}} anvil being made. At the same time cast iron anvils with <b>steel</b> <b>faces</b> were being made in the United States. At the dawn of the 20th century solid cast steel anvils began to be produced, as well as two piece forged anvils made from closed die forgings. Modern anvils are generally made entirely from steel.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to provide and verify a new design method for the in-plane compressive strength of steel sandwich panels comprised of <b>steel</b> <b>face</b> sheets and foamed steel cores. Foamed steel, literally steel with internal voids, provides enhanced bending rigidity, exceptional energy dissipation, and the potential to mitigate local instability. In this work, Winterâ€™s effective width expression is generalized to the case of steel foam sandwich panels. The generalization requires modification of the elastic buckling expressions to account for panel non-composite bending rigidity and shear deformations. In addition, an equivalent yield stress is introduced to provide a single parameter description of the yielding behavior of the <b>steel</b> <b>face</b> sheets and <b>steel</b> foam core. The provided analytical expressions are verified with finite element simulations employing three-dimensional continuum elements and calibrated constitutive models specific to metallic foams. The developed closed-form design expressions are employed to conduct parametric studies of steel foam sandwich panels, which (a) demonstrate the significant strength improvements possible when compared with solid steel, and (b) provide insights on the optimal balance between <b>steel</b> <b>face</b> sheet thickness and density of the foamed steel core. This work is part of a larger effort to help develop steel foam as a material with relevance to civil engineering applications...|$|R
50|$|The common blacksmith's anvil is made {{of either}} forged or cast steel, forged wrought iron with a hard <b>steel</b> <b>face</b> or cast iron with a hard <b>steel</b> <b>face.</b> Cast iron anvils are not used for forging as they are {{incapable}} of {{standing up to the}} impact and will crack and dent. Also, cast iron anvils without a hard <b>steel</b> <b>face</b> do not have the rebound that a harder anvil would and will tire out the smith. Historically, some anvils have been made with a smooth top working <b>face</b> of hardened <b>steel</b> welded to a cast iron or wrought iron body, though this manufacturing method is no longer in use. At one end, the common smith's anvil has a projecting conical bick (beak, horn) used for hammering curved work pieces. The other end is typically called the heel. Occasionally, the other end is also provided with a bick, partly rectangular in section. Most anvils made since the late 18th century also have a hardy hole and a pritchel hole where various tools, such as the anvil-cutter or hot chisel, can be inserted and held by the anvil. Some anvils have several hardy and pritchel holes, to accommodate a wider variety of hardy tools and pritchels. An anvil may also have a softer pad for chisel work.|$|R
50|$|There {{had been}} several {{attempts}} {{to improve on}} iron {{with the addition of}} harder <b>steels</b> on the <b>face,</b> but these all failed for the same reason as the earlier laminate experiments; the ability for the armour to spread sideways into its softer backing allowed it to be penetrated more easily. In the case of <b>steel</b> <b>facing,</b> the problem was that the steel would not adhere well to the underlying iron, allowing it to shift or separate entirely.|$|R

40|$|The current {{trend in}} the machine tools market is to produce {{machines}} capable of faster cutting speeds. The level of vibration in a machine tool has always influenced the accuracy, both dimensional and geometrical, of the product machined. Increasing structural stiffness could help in avoiding these problems. Alternate materials which could increase the structural stiffness while enhancing other characteristics including damping simultaneously {{should be used for}} machine tool structures. On the other hand, epoxy composite has exceptional damping characteristics. In this work, the bed of the Vertical Machining Center was considered for modifications to enhance both its stiffness and damping characteristics. Finite element analysis (FEA) was also carried out for standard dimensions of hybrid samples of different <b>steel</b> <b>face</b> thicknesses. Static and modal analysis were carried out for the hybrid samples. From the results of the analysis the optimum thickness of the <b>steel</b> <b>face</b> for the bed is determined as 1. 5 mm. The bed of Vertical Machining Center (VMC) was modeled using Pro/E and the finite element analysis of the bed was carried out. Static and modal analyses of the bed were carried out using ANSYS. The hybrid samples containing epoxy concrete core and <b>steel</b> <b>face</b> were fabricated. From the experimental results the damping factor of hybrid samples is calculated as 0. 45 which is higher than the damping factor of cast iron (damping factor = 0. 2) ...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} a design method for the {{compressive}} capacity of sandwich panels comprised of <b>steel</b> <b>face</b> sheets and foamed steel cores is derived and verified. Foamed steel, literally steel with internal voids, provides {{the potential to}} mitigate many local stability issues through increasing the effective width-to-thickness of the component {{for the same amount}} of material. Winter's classical effective width expression was generalized to the case of steel foam sandwich panels. The provided analytical expressions are verified with finite element simulations employing brick elements that explicitly model the <b>steel</b> <b>face</b> sheets and <b>steel</b> foam cores. The closed-form design expressions are employed to conduct parametric studies of steel foam sandwich panels with various <b>face</b> sheet and <b>steel</b> foamed core configurations. The studies show the significant strength improvements possible with steel foam sandwich panels when compared with plain steel sheet/plate...|$|R
40|$|We have {{developed}} a procedure to isolate, from skeletal muscle, enriched terminal cisternae of sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), which retain morphologically intact junctional "feet" structures similar to those observed in situ. The fraction is largely devoid of transverse tubule, plasma membrane, mitochondria, triads (transverse tubules junctionally associated with terminal cisternae), and longitudinal cisternae, as shown by thin-section electron microscopy of representative samples. The terminal cisternae vesicles have distinctive morphological characteristics that differ from the isolated longitudinal cisternae (light SR) obtained from the same gradient. The terminal cisternae consist of two distinct types of membranes, i. e., the junctional <b>face</b> <b>membrane</b> and the Ca 2 + pump protein-containing membrane, whereas the longitudinal cisternae contain only the Ca 2 + pump protein-containing <b>membrane.</b> The junctional <b>face</b> <b>membrane</b> of the terminal cisternae contains feet structures that extend approximately 12 nm from the membrane surface and can be clearly visualized in thin section through using tannic acid enhancement, by negative staining and by freeze-fracture electron microscopy. Sections of the terminal cisternae, cut tangential to and intersecting {{the plane of the}} junctional face, reveal a checkerboardlike lattice of alternating, square-shaped feet structures and spaces each 20 nm square. Structures characteristic of the Ca 2 + pump protein are not observed between the feet at the junctional <b>face</b> <b>membrane,</b> either in thin section or by negative staining, even though the Ca 2 + pump protein is observed in the nonjunctional membrane on the remainder of the same vesicle. Likewise, freeze-fracture replicas reveal regions of the P face containing ropelike strands instead of the high density of the 7 - 8 -nm particles referable to the Ca 2 + pump protein. The intravesicular content of the terminal cisternae, mostly Ca 2 +-binding protein (calsequestrin), is organized in the form of strands, sometimes appearing paracrystalline, and attached to the inner <b>face</b> of the <b>membrane</b> {{in the vicinity of the}} junctional feet. The terminal cisternae preparation is distinct from previously described heavy SR fractions in that it contains the highest percentage of junctional <b>face</b> <b>membrane</b> with morphologically well- preserved junctional feet structures...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: This article {{deals with}} the overall {{structural}} stability of sandwich panels used as ceilings and fire walls when exposed to fire on one side. Only panels with flat <b>steel</b> <b>faces</b> are considered. Simple mechanisms of instability are described, load actions are quantified, and practical design guidance is given to ensure stability i. e., resistance to overall collapse. The analysis for ceilings assumes that, after delamination of the fire exposed <b>steel</b> <b>face</b> due to softening of the adhesive, the panel faces act as catenaries, and calculations are made of mid-span deflection and the catenary force needed to resist collapse. This method is being considered {{in the work of}} European committee CEN TC 127 with regard to the development of rules for extended applications for construction products. The analysis for internal fire walls takes account of wind pressure. The importance of achieving adequate panel-end restraint is demonstrated.

50|$|Seven bronze panels at {{the main}} {{entrance}} depict scenes {{from the life of}} President Abraham Lincoln. The building is constructed of 1 774 tons of structural <b>steel,</b> <b>faced</b> with 21 250 cubic feet of cut Indiana limestone and granite with gold highlights.

5000|$|The step is {{that area}} of the anvil between the [...] "horn" [...] and the [...] "face". It is soft and is used for cutting; its purpose is to prevent {{damaging}} the <b>steel</b> <b>face</b> of the anvil by conducting such operations there and {{so as not to}} damage the cutting edge of the chisel, though many smiths shun this practice as it will damage the anvil over time.|$|R

50|$|According to Blair (1997), British <b>Steel</b> <b>faced</b> serious {{problems}} {{at the time of}} its formation, including obsolescent plants; plants operating under capacity and thus at low efficiency; outdated technology; price controls that reduced marketing flexibility; soaring coal and oil costs; lack of capital investment funds; and increasing competition on the world market. By the 1970s, the government adopted a policy of keeping employment artificially high in the declining industry. This especially impacted BSC since it was a major employer in a number of depressed regions.|$|R

40|$|AbstractCell {{division}} {{requires an}} increase in surface area to volume ratio. During early development, surface area can increase, volume can decrease, or surface topography can be optimized to allow for division. While exocytosis {{is thought to be}} essential for division [Mol. Biol. Cell 10 (1999), 2735; Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 99 (2002), 3633], exocytosis doesnâ€™t always yield {{an increase in}} surface area [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 79 (1982), 6712]. We used multiphoton laser scanning microscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy, and electron microscopy to monitor membrane trafficking, surface area, volume, and surface topography during early sea urchin development. Despite extensive membrane trafficking monitored by FM 1 - 43 fluorescence, we find that the net surface area of the embryo does not change prior to the eight-cell stage. During this period, embryo volume decreases by 15 %, and microvilli disappear from interior <b>facing</b> <b>membrane</b> segments. Thus, the first three cell divisions utilize residual membrane liberated by decreasing cytoplasmic volume, and reducing microvilli density on interior <b>facing</b> <b>membranes.</b> Only after the eight-cell stage was a net increase in FM 1 - 43 fluorescence from the embryo surface detected. Our data suggest that compensatory endocytosis is downregulated after this developmental stage to yield an increase in surface area for cell division...|$|R
