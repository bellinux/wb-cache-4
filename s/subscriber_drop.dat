50|$|Starting in 2012, cable {{companies}} {{have seen the}} amount of <b>subscribers</b> <b>drop</b> drastically. Companies such as CBS as well as HBO have been offering streaming services on their respective websites. The main reason for companies to take measures like {{this is due to}} the availability of streaming online. Large brands have taken notice that their all-in-one cable packaging aren't keeping customers like in previous years. With online streaming, {{cable companies}} have to fight to keep up with these other services.|$|R

In the United States over five million homes connect to the Internet using DOCSIS 1 cable modems. In this article we describe an evolution path to enhance the HFC plant to provide, initially, Gigabit Ethernet (and eventually multi-Gigabit Ethernet) on the trunk and feeder portions, and 100 Mb/s Ethernet on the <b>subscriber</b> <b>drops.</b> This next-generation HFC net-work will enable cable service providers to address the vast and underserved small and medium-sized business market, as well as offer emerging applica-tions and services to the residential market...|$|R
50|$|Warlords of Draenor {{sold over}} 3.3 million copies {{within the first}} 24 hours, and {{subscription}} numbers increased from 7.4 million to over 10.5 million in November 2014. However, {{by the end of}} the first quarter of 2015, the number of subscribers had fallen to 7.1 million; 300,000 subscribers fewer than before the release of Warlords of Draenor. By the end of the second quarter, the number of <b>subscribers</b> <b>dropped</b> to 5.6 million, the lowest number of subscribers ever seen in the game since 2005. By the third quarter, subscribers held at 5.5 million. In November 2015, Blizzard said it will no longer report on the number of World of Warcraft subscribers.|$|R
25|$|Biometric reverification of SIMs in 2015 had {{an adverse}} {{impact on the}} {{cellular}} subscriber base when <b>subscribers</b> count <b>dropped</b> from 139.9 million to 114.6 million. However, the industry has survived through the tough period and continues to regain subscribers at a fast pace.|$|R
50|$|As private companies—foreign and national—have {{taken over}} water-supply {{services}} in various Colombian cities, charges have increased, {{and the financial}} deficit {{in the provision of}} drinking water has been reduced from 45 to 10 percent. As prices have increased, consumption has decreased by at least 13 cubic meters a month per household to 16.9 cubic meters a month per household in 2004. This reduced consumption in response to higher prices has generated efficiency gains by lowering expansion requirements and variable costs. Increased efficiency also has brought about a smaller workforce and reduced the number of employees for every 1,000 subscribers in major cities. For example, between 1995 and 2000, the number of employees per 1,000 <b>subscribers</b> <b>dropped</b> from 6.8 to 3.7 in Barranquilla, and from 3.2 to 2.3 in Bogotá.|$|R
5000|$|After the {{deadline}} passed all Viacom channels were pulled from Suddenlink's lineup on October 1, 2014. Viacom claimed that Suddenlink rejected {{one of its}} own proposals and informed them they would drop the channels. Suddenlink maintained that Viacom rejected every proposal the company made to continue carrying Viacom's channels. Suddenlink reorganized their channel lineups to replace the Viacom channels some of the replacements were already available to Suddenlink while some were not previously available. Suddenlink replaced Viacom's channels with twenty other channels including FXX, Hallmark Movies & Mysteries, Investigation Discovery, OWN, Sprout, TheBlaze, Pivot and Up. Due to Suddenlink's size the company received positive reception in the media saying the decision could inspire other mid-small size operators. Six months after dropping Viacom's channels Suddenlink's then CEO Jerry Kent stated 2%-2.5% of its video <b>subscribers</b> <b>dropped</b> their service. He also noted the some of the replacement channels were viewed more than some of the dropped channels. Despite losing some video subscribers Kent also stated [...] "meeting the programmer’s demands would have been more costly. When Pivot ceased operations, Suddenlink started carried i24 News." ...|$|R
60|$|Mrs Varden having cut in, {{looked at}} a box upon the mantelshelf, painted in {{imitation}} of a very red-brick dwelling-house, with a yellow roof; having at top a real chimney, down which voluntary <b>subscribers</b> <b>dropped</b> their silver, gold, or pence, into the parlour; and on the door the counterfeit presentment of a brass plate, whereon was legibly inscribed 'Protestant Association:'--and looking at it, said, that it was to her a source of poignant misery to think that Varden never had, of all his substance, dropped anything into that temple, save once in secret--as she afterwards discovered--two fragments of tobacco-pipe, which she hoped would not be put down to his last account. That Dolly, she was grieved to say, was no less backward in her contributions, better loving, as it seemed, to purchase ribbons and such gauds, than to encourage the great cause, then in such heavy tribulation; and that she did entreat her (her father she much feared could not be moved) not to despise, but imitate, the bright example of Miss Miggs, who flung her wages, as it were, into the very countenance of the Pope, and bruised his features with her quarter's money.|$|R
50|$|World of Warcraft is a {{dominant}} MMOG with 8-9 million monthly subscribers worldwide. The <b>subscriber</b> base <b>dropped</b> by 1 million after the expansion Wrath of the Lich King, {{bringing it to}} 9 million subscribers in 2010, though it remained the most popular Western title among MMOGs. In 2008, Western consumer spending on World of Warcraft represented a 58% share of the subscription MMOG market in 2009. The title has generated over $2.2 billion in cumulative consumer spending on subscriptions from 2005 through 2009.|$|R
50|$|Since December 2002, <b>subscriber</b> {{numbers have}} <b>dropped</b> {{considerably}} to {{almost half of}} the 241,000 reported. Since that time, Optus has repositioned its television service to being a major component of bundled services, rather than a service by itself. By August 2010 only 96,000 subscribers remained.|$|R
50|$|Most {{cable systems}} divide their channel lineups ("tiers") into {{three or four}} basic channel packages. A must-carry rule {{requires}} all cable television systems to carry all full-power local commercial broadcast stations in the designated television market on their lineups, unless those stations opt to invoke retransmission consent and demand compensation, {{in which case the}} cable provider can decline to carry the channel (especially if the provider feels that the rate of carrying an existing service would result in an increase of the average price of a tier to levels to which it could result in a <b>subscriber</b> possibly <b>dropping</b> the service).|$|R
50|$|A Nielsen report {{showed that}} during {{the fourth quarter of}} 2011, the number of people paying for {{television}} had dropped by 15 million people (a rate of 1.5 percent), and the number of cable <b>subscribers</b> <b>dropped</b> by 2.9 million. A 2012 Deloitte report said 9% of television households dropped cable service during 2011 and an additional 11% planned to cancel their service. Sanford Bernstein estimates 400,000 dropped pay video services during the second quarter of 2012, up from 340,000 in 2011. One reason for the drop was college students' returning home for the summer, while the companies made up for the loss in other quarters. However, the number of new homes paying for television service is less than the total number of new homes. Another possible reason is services, such as time shifting and live recording capabilities, that were once exclusive to pay television services, are now being offered to cord cutters. Although the number of subscribers usually increases in the third quarter, in 2012 only 30,000 people added pay television service, {{according to a study by}} the International Strategy & Investment Group. Cable lost 340,000 subscribers (with Time Warner Cable accounting for 140,000 of that number) and satellite gained only 50,000; telephone companies added 320 subscribers. Throughout 2012, pay television added only 46,000 new subscribers, out of 974,000 new households overall, according to SNL Kagan. 84.7 percent of households subscribed, compared to 87.3 percent in early 2010.|$|R
50|$|The Church {{is unique}} among American {{denominations}} in several ways. It is highly centralized, {{with all the}} local churches merely branches of the mother church in Boston. There are no ministers, but there are practitioners who are integral to the movement. The practitioners operate local businesses that help members heal their illnesses {{by the power of}} the mind. They depend for their clientele on the approval of the Church. Starting in the late 19th century the Church has rapidly lost membership, although it does not publish statistics. Its flagship newspaper Christian Science Monitor lost most of its <b>subscribers</b> and <b>dropped</b> its paper version to become an online source.|$|R
5000|$|The {{name was}} derived from taking the first letters of [...] "Smith" [...] and [...] "Mosier" [...] and {{replacing}} the [...] "P" [...] in podcast. The podcast was originally distributed through Smith's entertainment website Quick Stop Entertainment. New episodes were made available for download each Sunday night or Monday morning, and are then released through the RSS feed the following Friday in order to ease bandwidth strains on the Quickstop Entertainment. On January 1, 2010, the host site was sold, the SModcasts were removed and a dedicated site was started. In addition, the one-week delay for iTunes <b>subscribers</b> was <b>dropped</b> starting with SModcast 101.|$|R
5000|$|Another {{category}} of cord-cutters was labeled by Nielsen in March 2013 as [...] "Zero TV". In 2007, two million households had neither subscribed to a pay television service or received television programming via antenna. By 2013, this number had increased to five million. Most {{people in this}} category were younger {{and did not have}} children in the household. People could still view shows via online streaming through services such as Netflix. At the 2013 National Association of Broadcasters Show, the solution for broadcasters was stated to be mobile television. A 2013 Leichtman survey showed that the 13 largest MVPD companies, covering 94 percent of the country, experienced their first year-to-year subscriber losses. 80,000 <b>subscribers</b> <b>dropped</b> their service in the year ending March 31, 2013. 1.5 million cable customers dropped their service, with Time Warner Cable losing 553,000 and Comcast losing 359,000 subscribers. AT&T and Verizon added 1.32 million subscribers; DirecTV and Dish added 160,000 subscribers, compared to 439,000 the previous year. Before 2013, only quarter-to-quarter losses had been recorded industrywide. Internet video and switching to receiving television programming by antenna were reasons. Bruce Leichtman described the subscription television industry as [...] "saturated". A TDG study showed nearly 101 million U.S. households subscribed to television at the industry's peak in 2011, but the number would fall below 95 million in 2017. In 2013, the number of total subscribers to pay TV services fell by a quarter of a million. This was the first decline from one year to the next.|$|R
500|$|In early 1995, Sega CEO Hayao Nakayama {{decided to}} end {{development}} on the Sega Genesis and its add-ons, the Sega CD and Sega 32X.

[...] This placed the release of the Sega Channel right {{at the height of the}} Genesis' decline from the market. [...] At its peak, Sega Channel had over 250,000 subscribers, but by 1997, the number of <b>subscribers</b> had <b>dropped</b> to 230,000, two years after Nakayama made the decision to shift focus from the Genesis to the Saturn.

50|$|Even {{with the}} success of Cataclysm, World of Warcraft saw a gradual decline in {{subscribers}} through 2011. Following the release of Cataclysm, subscription levels reached a peak of 12 million <b>subscribers</b> but soon <b>dropped</b> to pre-Cataclysm levels of 11.4 million by the end of March 2011. In early November 2011, subscriptions declined even further to 10.3 million users. In 2012, the subscription numbers stabilized at around 10.2 million users, holding steady for two consecutive quarters. On August 2, 2012 it was revealed that subscription numbers had continued to decline, landing at an approximate 9.1 million subscribers.|$|R
5000|$|The {{network is}} {{available}} on Time Warner Cable and Comcast, among other providers. Charter Communications previously carried the channel until November 15, 2011, when the channel was dropped from Charter's lineups; this decision was made before the re-brand of ALN, as the channel received carriage under that provider's [...] "faith and values"/religious tier of networks and no longer carried religious or family-appropriate programming {{for a majority of}} the broadcast day. At the launch of Youtoo, the network offered up to $200 in bill credits to viewers who switched to a provider that offered the network. As per an email sent to its <b>subscribers,</b> Verizon FiOS <b>dropped</b> the channel on December 31, 2012 along with MAVTV, and Blue Highways TV.|$|R
50|$|As {{with all}} negotiations, {{carriage}} disputes involve tradeoffs for both parties. Distributors must weigh {{the effect of}} the carriage fees they pay on both their revenues and the fees they pass on to subscribers. Distributors also risk antagonizing their <b>subscribers</b> if they <b>drop</b> one or more channels from their lineup. For their part, broadcasters risk losing viewers, which in turn can reduce revenues from commercials and per-subscriber carriage fees. Financial consequences can ensue. Dish Network lost 156,000 customers {{in the fourth quarter of}} 2011 after a carriage dispute with Fox resulted in a loss of Fox Sports programming in October. AMC Networks' stock dropped by nearly five percent after the network's programming was dropped by Dish at the end of June 2012.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. Using data published. by "Editor & Publisher, " annual reports, and {{confidential}} material made available by publishers, this paper examines budgets for papers of varying sizes from 1947 to 1974.

Earnings of 15 % after taxes Are not uncommon, though large °metropolitan papers and papers {{with fewer than}} 25, 000 circulation are such less profitable. The chief change in revenue over the past 27 years has been in advertising.

5000|$|On November 10, 2006, Comcast {{announced}} it would add NFL Network on its digital tier {{in time for the}} debut of the network's eight-game Thursday- and Saturday-night package. On August 6, 2007, Comcast moved NFL Network from the digital tiers to the Sports Entertainment Package. This led to a court battle between NFL Network and Comcast, with the ruling in favor of Comcast; the NFL Network later appealed the ruling. Comcast sent NFL Network a cease-and-desist letter to stop encouraging <b>subscribers</b> to <b>drop</b> their Comcast service. Comcast's carriage agreement with the NFL Network ended in mid-2009. On February 26, 2008, a New York appellate court reversed course on a May 2007 judgment that allowed Comcast to move the network from its second-most distributed tier to the company's sports tier. At that time, a court date had not been set. Four judges at the New York State Supreme Court, Appellate Division, First Department, ruled the language [...] "concerning additional programming package was ambiguous and that neither party has established that its interpretation of the relevant contracts is a matter of law." [...] Comcast's deal with the NFL Network was set to expire on April 30, 2009. According to messages sent out to Comcast, Midco, and some Cable Systems customers with or without set-top boxes, NFL Network might be removed from some customers' channel lineups. The message said: [...] "In spite of our efforts to continue carrying NFL Network/NFL Network HD, the NFL may terminate our rights. As a result these networks may be removed from lineups as soon as 5/1." [...] On April 10, 2009, it was confirmed that Comcast would remove the channel on that date due to failing to reach a carriage agreement. However, on April 30, 2009, NFL Network announced that it would continue to be carried on Comcast in the interim while both sides tried to reach an agreemenet on a new contract. On July 30, 2009, NFL Network was made available to lower-tiered Comcast digital cable subscribers.|$|R
5000|$|On November 28, 2011, {{a report}} by Credit Suisse media analyst Stefan Anninger said that young people who grew up {{accustomed}} to watching shows online {{would be less likely}} to subscribe to pay television services, terming these people as [...] "cord-nevers". Anninger predicted that by the end of 2012, the industry's <b>subscriber</b> count would <b>drop</b> by 200,000 to 100.5 million; Anninger's report also stated that consumers were not likely to return to paying for television. In the case of land-line telephones, people had believed younger people would eventually get them, but now numerous subscribers only have mobile phones. Anninger predicted that the same would hold true for pay television, and that providers would need to offer lower-priced packages with fewer channels in order to reverse the trend. Also using the term [...] "cord-nevers" [...] was Richard Schneider, whose company Antennas Direct was selling antennas through the Internet. After a decade in business, the company was selling 600,000 antennas a year. However, Schneider said some people only knew of the Internet and services such as Netflix and were not even aware broadcast television even existed. In a speech on November 16, 2012, Time Warner CEO Jeff Bewkes said [...] "cord nevers" [...] did not see anything worth paying for.|$|R
