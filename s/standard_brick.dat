Another plant was located farther down the Colorado River at the site of the Zachary Scott Theatre. In 1912 the firm acquired the Austin Brick Company, and in 1965 it acquired its chief competitor, Elgin <b>Standard</b> <b>Brick</b> Company. The Elgin Butler company supplied bricks for the Texas State Capitol, 80 percent of the brick structures at the University of Texas at Austin, face brick and fire brick for fireplaces in many Austin residences, and many other brick buildings in Austin.

All bricks were tested for their physical and mechanical properties including compressive strength, initial rate of absorption and density. Higher heating rates decrease compressive strength value but slightly increase the initial rate of absorption and density properties respectively. In conclusion, higher heating rates are able to produce adequate physical and mechanical properties especially for CB Brick...|$|R

40|$|Higher {{education}} institutions, {{such as the}} University of Colorado Boulder (CU-Boulder), have as a core {{mission to}} advance their students’ academic performance. On the frontier of education technologies that hold the promise to address our educational mission are Massively Open Online Courses (MOOCs) which are new enough to not be fully understood or well-researched. MOOCs, in theory, have vast potential for being cost-effective and for reaching diverse audiences across the world. This thesis examines the implementation of one MOOC, Physics 1 for Physical Science Majors, implemented in the augural round of institutionally sanctioned MOOCs in Fall 2013. While comparatively inexpensive to a brick-and-mortar course and while it initially enrolled audience of nearly 16, 000 students, this MOOC {{was found to be}} time-consuming to implement, and only roughly 1. 5 % of those who enrolled completed the course [...] approximately 1 / 4 of those who completed the <b>standard</b> <b>brick</b> and mortar course that the MOOC was designed around. An established education technology, residential communities, contrast the MOOCs by being high-touch and highly humanized, but by being expensive and locally-based. The Andrews Hall Residential College (AHRC) on the CU campus fosters academic success and retention by engaging and networking students outside of the <b>standard</b> <b>brick</b> and mortar courses and enculturating students into an environment with vertical integration through the different classes: freshman, sophomore, junior, etc. The physics MOOC and the AHRC were studied to determine how the environments were made and what lessons were learned in the process. Also, student performance was compared for the physics MOOC, a subset of the AHRC students enrolled in a special physics course, and the standard CU Physics 1 brick and mortar course. All yielded similar learning gains for physics 1 performance, for those who completed the courses. These environments are presented together to compare and contrast their strengths and weaknesses so that the best pieces can be synthesized for future innovation to better encourage academic success in higher education...|$|E
40|$|The work {{presented}} in this article concerns polluted marine sediments. The article is divided into three parts. The first part discusses existing industrial procedures of treatment. The second part introduces the Novosol® process, which was used for the treatment of polluted marine sediments. This process is based on the stabilization of heavy metals in the solid matrix by phosphatation and the destruction of organic matter by calcination. Finally, after a comparison had been made between environmental results obtained on both polluted marine sediments and inert ones, treated sediments were introduced in the production of clay bricks. The results obtained show that the Novosol process leads to the immobilization of most heavy metals and can be considered as an efficient tool for the stabilisation of polluted marine sediment. Thus, the results of physical and mechanical tests as compressive strength and water absorption indicate that performances obtained were comparable to <b>standard</b> <b>brick</b> values. These results confirm that, once treated, polluted sediments can be recycled...|$|E

However, in many cases, especially in bending dominated problems, <b>standard</b> <b>brick</b> elements show severe stiffening effects known as locking problems [1, 2]. Several methods have been proposed over years in order to overcome these locking phenomena. For example, the enhanced assumed strain (EAS) have been used in geometrically nonlinear version [3 – 5] where the strain field can be enriched in order to improve the element’s performance under certain conditions. 3 D solid elements with rotational degrees of freedom are also proposed with different discrete approximations like the method of the mixed interpolations of tensorial components [6] for the brick element of Wils on and Ibrahimbegovic [2]. The Space Fiber Rotation concept (SFR) [7] and the shift of the mid-side displacement DOFs of the classical 20 -node hexahedral element into corner nodal translations and rotations are proposed by Yunu and al.
