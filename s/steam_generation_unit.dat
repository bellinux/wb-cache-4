The condenser, decanter, <b>steam</b> <b>generation</b> <b>unit,</b> stripping chamber, control valves and the cooling water system were sized and selected {{in such a way that}} the plant will perform to specification. The <b>steam</b> <b>generation</b> <b>unit</b> was designed to contain 25 litres of water with dimension 0. 35 m diameter by 0. 26 m high. The condenser has 24 tubes (i. e. 12 tubes per pass), its size is 1 m long by 0. 215 m shell diameter. The stripping chamber was designed to process a maximum of 10 kg of the raw material per batch run and its size is 0. 35 m diameter by 0. 45 m high while the cooling water system was specified as 200 litres capacity with O.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Biomass co‐products {{from the}} dry‐grind ethanol {{production}} process and/or corn stover are potential {{sources for the}} energy needed to operate the plant. The ethanol plant co‐products alone contain sufficient energy to meet the electrical and thermal needs of the plant {{as well as to}} produce excess power that can be sold. Fuel characteristics of co‐products of the ethanol dry‐grind process [distillers wet grains (DWG), concentrated distillers solubles (referred to as “syrup”), and distillers dried grains with solubles (DDGS) ], and corn stover are evaluated. Analyses include proximate, ultimate, selected metals, ash fusion temperatures, minerals in the ash, and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Higher heating values for the co‐products are greater than for corn stover and for most other biomass materials. The ethanol co‐products contain large amounts of nitrogen, sulfur, and chlorine, which will require major control technologies for combustion or gasification systems to meet emissions limits. The alkali metal content (potassium and sodium oxides) of the ash is high (22 % to 34 %) for co‐products and corn stover, which will require careful design to avoid to ash fouling in combustion and <b>steam</b> <b>generation</b> <b>units.</b> Corn stover has more favorable combustion characteristics than the ethanol co‐products based on higher ash fusion temperatures and the TGA results (higher combustion reactivity and lower burnout temperature) ...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. In {{the process}} control industry, {{majority}} of control loops {{are based on}} Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controllers. The basic structure of the PID controllers {{makes it easy to}} regulate the process output. Design methods leading to an optimal and effective operation of the PID controllers are economically vital for process industries. Robust control has been a recent addition to the field of control engineering that primarily deals with obtaining system robustness in presences of uncertainties. In this thesis, a graphical design method for obtaining the entire range of PID controller gains that robustly stabilize a system in the presence of time delays and additive uncertainty is introduced. This design method primarily depends on the frequency response of the system, which can serve to reduce the complexities involved in plant modeling. The fact that time-delays and parametric uncertainties are almost always present in real time processes makes our controller design method very vital for process control. We have applied our design method to a DC motor model with a communication delay and a single area non-reheat <b>steam</b> <b>generation</b> <b>unit.</b> The results were satisfactory and robust stability was achieved for the perturbed plants...|$|E

This study investigated the effect of variations of overall conductance of the super heater {{on the performance of}} an existing steam power plant located in Derna, Libya. The performance of the power plant was estimated by a mathematical modelling which considers the off-design operating conditions of each component. A fully interactive computer program based on the mass, energy and exergy balance equations has been developed. The maximum exergy destruction has been found in the <b>steam</b> <b>generation</b> <b>unit.</b> A 50 % reduction in the design value of overall conductance of the super heater has been achieved, which accordingly decreases the amount of the net electrical power that would be generated by at least 13 MW, as well as the overall plant exergy efficiency by at least 6. 4 %, {{and at the same time}} that would cause an increase of the total exergy destruction by at least 14 MW. The achieved results showed that the super heater design and operating conditions play an important role on the thermodynamics performance and the fuel utilization of the power plant. Moreover, these considerations are very useful in the process of the decision that should be taken at the occasions of deciding whether to replace or renovate the super heater of the power plant...|$|E

Alkaline electrolysers are an attractive technology to produce carbon-free Hydrogen from renewable generated electricity.

40|$|Over the {{previous}} decades, {{industry has been}} one of the major drivers of global economic growth and the issue of energy efficiency has become a matter of concern in different industries. Improving energy efficiency in industry, particularly in manufacturing plays a key role in reducing production costs and the environmental impact. Manufacturers also are driven to practise more energy efficient measures because of governmental regulations and policies. In this regard, a holistic view of the entire system is needed in which the dynamic behaviour of the production processes, supporting services, other energy consumers and their interrelationships must be considered. Predominantly, the underlying system is too complex so it is vital to utilise simulation to model the system. Furthermore, a simulation model can be used to design a system with an optimal performance where the performance relies on the value of some input parameters and the point is how to determine the values of these parameters (possibly subjected to some constraints) which contribute to an optimal performance. To address both above-mentioned issues, an integrated simulation-based optimisation framework was proposed in which a simulation model represented the production system in a hierarchical structure and simulated the energy consumed in the system using a bottom to up approach. Six basic modules were embedded, including four modules for main energy consuming equipment (one for machine tools and process chains, and three for TBSs including <b>steam</b> <b>generation</b> <b>unit,</b> compressed air system and HVAC systems). Careful observations of a wide range of diverse equipment were carried out for the first four modules, and then the basic components of a generic state-based energy consumption model were identified for each. Regarding the optimisation part of the framework, a population-based optimisation algorithm called the Cross Entropy method was utilised which treated the simulation model as a black box model to evaluate the system under different settings. A weighted sum method was used to combine different objectives in case of multi objectives.

40|$|Sustainability {{has become}} a {{challenge}} for manufacturers. They need to maintain their process performance while also considering environmental (e. g. carbon footprint of products) and social obligations. Since the environmental impact of manufacturing activities is strongly dependent on the energy demand, improving energy efficiency has received substantial attention from industries all around the world. To take up the need of manufacturers in their decision making process tackling both economic and environmental challenges, a holistic view of the entire system is necessary. The holistic view incorporates the dynamic behavior of all the production processes (including supporting services) involved in making different products. Due to versatility of material flows within production systems (e. g. batch production, one piece flow or job shop), a generic model that can model large spectrum of production systems is highly desired from application point of view. Furthermore a system with an optimal performance is yet another necessity from manufacturer’s point of view. To address all above-mentioned issues, an integrated simulation-based optimization framework was proposed in which a simulation model represented the multi-product production system in a hierarchical structure and simulated multiple process chains. Six basic modules were embedded including two modules for Multi Product Routing and Production Planning and Control that act as heart of the developed framework. The complex product routing and various production systems were carefully conceptualized within these two modules. Two other basic modules were developed for the main energy consuming equipment (one for machine tools and process chains, and four sub-modules for technical building services including <b>steam</b> <b>generation</b> <b>unit,</b> compressed air system,dust collectors and HVAC systems). Careful observations {{of a wide range of}} diverse equipment were carried out for the modules, and the basic components of a generic state-based energy consumption model were identified for each.

Operating conditions and current state-of-the-art design are considered in order to set a base-case for the identification of the exergy destruction.
