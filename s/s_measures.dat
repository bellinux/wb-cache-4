It is known to be a continuous function on polynomials with complex coefficients, however when restricted to polynomials with integer coefficients it is expected to have 2 ̆ 2 gaps 2 ̆ 2 in its values. This has been conjectured by D. H. Lehmer in 1933, and is to this day one of the famous open problems in Number Theory. Mahler 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>measure</b> and Lehmer 2 ̆ 7 s conjecture have fundamental connections and applications within Number Theory as well as in other areas of mathematics, for instance ergodic theory.

40|$|An {{efficient}} {{measure of}} signal temporal predictability is proposed, which {{is referred to}} as difference measure. We can prove that the difference measure of any signal mixture is between the maximal and minimal difference measure of the source signals. Previous blind source separation (BSS) problem is changed to a generalized eigenproblem by using Stone 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>measure.</b> However, by using difference measure, the BSS problem is furthermore simplified to a standard symmetric eigenproblem. And the separation matrix is the eigenvector matrix, which can be solved by using principal component analysis (PCA) method. Based on difference measure, a few efficient algorithms have been proposed, which are either in batch mode or in on-line mode. Simulations show that difference measure is competitive with Stone 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>measure.</b> Especially, the on-line algorithms derived from difference measure have better performance than those defived from Stone 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>measure...</b>|$|R
