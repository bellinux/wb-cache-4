500|$|In 2002, {{the band}} co-headlined the Pop Disaster Tour with Green Day. The tour was {{conceived}} by Blink-182 to echo the famous Monsters of Rock tours; {{the idea was}} to have, effectively, a Monsters of Punk tour. The tour, from the band's point of view, had been put together as a show of unity in the face of consistent accusations of rivalry between the two bands, especially in Europe. Instead, Green Day's Tré Cool acknowledged in a Kerrang! interview that they committed to the tour as an opportunity to regain their reputation as a great live band, as they felt their spotlight had faded over the years. [...] "We set out to reclaim our throne as the most incredible live punk band from you know who," [...] said Cool. Cool contended that [...] "we heard they were going to quit the tour because they were getting smoked so badly... We didn't want them to quit the tour. They're good for filling up the seats up front." [...] Several reviewers were unimpressed with Blink-182's headlining set following Green Day. [...] "Sometimes playing last at a rock show is more a curse than a privilege... Pity the headliner, for instance, that gets blown off the stage by the band before it. Blink-182 endured that indignity <b>Saturday</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Shoreline Amphitheatre," [...] a reporter for the San Francisco Chronicle wrote in 2002.|$|E
