50|$|At 20:00 that night, at {{the hour}} of the ultimatum, elite IDF commandos from the Sayeret Matkal special forces unit carried out an {{operation}} to free Wachsman. It was thought that Wachsman was being held behind an iron door, {{but in fact it}} was a solid steel door, and the first explosion only dented the iron door. The commandos immediately lost the element of surprise, giving Wachsman's captors inside time to shoot him dead and position themselves for the impending firefight. A second explosive charge was prepared and the door was finally blasted open after more than a minute, and after a heavy exchange of fire with gunmen waiting on the stairwell, the commandos reached a second iron door, and had to wait another four minutes for <b>the</b> charges <b>to</b> be set. During this time, <b>the</b> commandos <b>shouted</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> gunmen <b>inside</b> <b>to</b> surrender, while <b>the</b> gunmen replied that Waschsman was already dead and that they preferred <b>to</b> die. After <b>the</b> team broke through the door, another exchange of fire took place before the room was secured. In total, three gunmen were killed and two taken prisoner, while the leader of the commando team, Captain Nir Poraz was killed and nine commandos were wounded. Wachsman was found dead in the room. His body was slumped in a chair, wearing a kafiyeh and civilian clothes. He {{had been shot in the}} throat and chest at close range. The Wachsman family was informed of his death personally by General Yoram Yair.|$|R
