40|$|This paper aims {{to clarify}} the effect of private high-school subsidy on the {{decision}} of <b>school</b> <b>fee</b> of the private high-school in Tokyo. The formula of private high-school subsidy includes the price of <b>school</b> <b>fee.</b> If the <b>school</b> <b>fee</b> is too high, the amount of subsidy automatically goes down. This system tries to make the <b>school</b> <b>fee</b> keep low, but does it really works ? To answer this question, this paper examines the effect of subsidy by regression. The result of the regression shows that there are effects of the subsidy in the <b>school</b> <b>fee,</b> but {{the difficulty of the}} entrance exams and whether establishing other schools or not, effects more on deciding the price of the <b>school</b> <b>fee.</b> // This result leads tconclusion that not all high-schools are under the effect of subsidy formula. It depneds on the high-schools position in the private-high-school market. Schools with junior-high or universities can take a better position in the market. They can make the fee higher, and still, students come...|$|R

5|$|Initially {{tuition at}} the school was free, funded by various endowments and rents {{obtained}} from lands the most significant arising from the Abolition of the Chantries Acts, and the re-appropriation of funds to the school. In 1944 under the Education Act education remained free, however the common entrance exam at eleven was introduced and the school became a selective grammar school. <b>School</b> <b>fees</b> were introduced in 1977 when the school withdrew from the maintained system and became independent. For the year 2013/2014 they are £14,670 (approximately €17,900 or US$24,500 as of March 2014) per year excluding lunches. All those wishing to be admitted now take the schools own internal 11+ entrance examination which tests English, mathematics and verbal reasoning and attend an interview with two members of staff. If a place is awarded, entry can de deferred for two years so that boys who are at prep school may enter at thirteen. Those entering at thirteen must take the 13+ Common Entrance or the scholarship examination to confirm their place.|$|E
5|$|Carre's Grammar School is a {{selective}} secondary school for boys in Sleaford, a market town in Lincolnshire, England. Founded on 1 September 1604 by an indenture of Robert Carre, {{the school was}} funded by rents from farmland and run {{by a group of}} trustees. The indenture restricted the endowment to £20 without accounting for inflation, causing the school to decline during the 18th century and effectively close in 1816. Revived by a decree from the Court of Chancery in 1830, new buildings were constructed at its present site and the school re-opened in 1835. Faced with competition from cheaper commercial schools and declining rolls, Carre's eventually added technical and artistic instruction to its Classical curriculum by affiliating with Kesteven County Council in 1895. Following the Education Act 1944, <b>school</b> <b>fees</b> were abolished and Carre's became Voluntary Aided. New buildings were completed in 1966 to house the rising number of students. After plans for comprehensive education in Sleaford came to nothing in the 1970s and 1980s, Carre's converted to grant-maintained status in 1990. Foundation status followed and the school became an Academy in 2011; a multi-Academy trust with Kesteven and Sleaford High School was formed in 2015.|$|E
5|$|Field {{research}} {{carried out}} by ethnologists such as Stefan Ehrentraut shows that {{only a minority of}} Vietnamese children attend public schools, with figures varying across different provinces. In Kampong Chhnang and Siem Reap where the Vietnamese live along the river banks, enrolment into public schools fare below 10%, whereas in other provinces such as Kampot and Kratie the proportion are higher. As the majority of Vietnamese do not carry citizenship papers, they were unable to enrol their children into public schools. For those who send their children to schools, most of them only attend school for a few years and seldom complete Grade 12 as Vietnamese parents were unable to afford <b>school</b> <b>fees.</b> Vietnamese students also faced difficulties in academic work, as classes are taught exclusively in the Khmer language, and Vietnamese children that grew up speaking Vietnamese at home have limited competency in Khmer. In some Vietnamese communities based in the Tonle Sap and Mekong rivers, there are private schools that are run by Vietnamese community associations and Christian organisations. The private schools cater the teaching of the Vietnamese language, and are mostly attended by children of impoverished families.|$|E

5|$|Women were {{encouraged}} to leave the workforce {{and the creation of}} large families by racially suitable women was promoted through a propaganda campaign. Women received a bronze award—known as the Ehrenkreuz der Deutschen Mutter (Cross of Honour of the German Mother)—for giving birth to four children, silver for six and gold for eight or more. Large families received subsidies to help with their utilities, <b>school</b> <b>fees</b> and household expenses. Though the measures led to increases in the birth rate, the number of families having four or more children declined by five percent between 1935 and 1940. Removing women from the workforce did not have the intended effect of freeing up jobs for men as women were for the most part employed as domestic servants, weavers or in the food and drink industries—jobs that were not of interest to men. Nazi philosophy prevented large numbers of women from being hired to work in munitions factories in the build-up to the war, so foreign labourers were brought in. After the war started, slave labourers were extensively used. In January 1943, Hitler signed a decree requiring all women under the age of fifty to report for work assignments to help the war effort. Thereafter women were funnelled into agricultural and industrial jobs and by September 1944 14.9 million women were working in munitions production.|$|E
