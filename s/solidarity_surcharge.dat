50|$|On top {{of income}} tax, the {{so-called}} <b>solidarity</b> <b>surcharge</b> (Solidaritätszuschlag) is levied {{at a rate}} of 5.5% of the income tax for higher incomes. Up to €972 (€1,944 for married couples) annual income tax, no <b>solidarity</b> <b>surcharge</b> is levied. Above this threshold, the <b>solidarity</b> <b>surcharge</b> rate increases continuously until it reaches 5.5% when the annual income tax is €1,340.69 (€2,681.38 for married couples).|$|E

50|$|A {{study on}} the {{macroeconomic}} effects of the German government’s building rehabilitation programs has been conducted {{to assess the impact}} from the investment projects on the public revenue, the housing industry and the climate policy. The analysis focused on short-term effects (the effects taking place in the corresponding year). For the years 2008, 2009 and 2010, the analysis took into account the program cost (the opportunity cost of providing funds for the KfW promotional programs instead of using them elsewhere), and calculated the revenues from the value added tax paid by investors, net taxes on products, net taxes on production, payroll tax and SSC (Social Security Contributions) including <b>solidarity</b> <b>surcharge,</b> corporate income tax, and other income taxes including <b>solidarity</b> <b>surcharge.</b> Because {{it is not clear whether}} the additional demand for labour is met through overtime work or through additional jobs, the analysis provides two scenarios; one named “overtime”, where the demand impulse does not create additional jobs, and the second named “jobs”, where the opposite is true. In the latter, the avoided cost of unemployment is added as a revenue.|$|E
50|$|The {{flat rate}} tax rate of 25% is {{significantly}} lower than the highest income tax rate. Advantages on apply for investors whose marginal tax rate on the remaining income is equal or higher than the flat tax rate. There might be a breach of the principle of taxation based upon the competitiveness of the taxpayers. Before 2009 gains from capital income were taxed with 45% and from 2009 on are taxed with 25% plus 5.5% <b>solidarity</b> <b>surcharge</b> and church tax. That is the same for taxpayers with a personal income tax rate of 27%.|$|E

Peer Steinbrück is quoted as saying in a 2011 interview, [...] "Over a period of 20 years, German reunification has cost 2 trillion euros, or an average of 100 billion euros a year. So, we have to ask ourselves 'Aren't we willing to pay a tenth of that over several years for Europe's unity?'" ...|$|E
50|$|Real estate {{continues}} to be exempt from capital gains tax if it has been held {{for more than ten}} years.The German capital gains tax is 25% plus <b>Solidarity</b> <b>surcharge</b> (add-on tax initially introduced to finance the 5 eastern states of Germany - Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and Brandenburg - and the cost of the reunification, but later kept in order to finance all kinds of public funded projects in all Germany), plus Kirchensteuer (church tax, voluntarily), resulting in an effective tax rate of about 28-29%.Deductions of expenses such as custodian fees, travel to annual shareholder meetings, legal and tax advice, interest paid on loans to buy shares, etc., are no longer permitted starting in 2009.|$|E

The already taxed capital gains {{are no longer}} recorded in the annual income [...]Instead of taxing with the personal tax rate of taxpayers, their income regardless of their height is taxed with the flat tax rate of 25%. The legal basis for this was amended in the Unternehmensteuerreformgesetz of 2008 in Art. 32 d of the German Income Tax Act.The withholding tax rate according to Art. 43 a Para. 1 German Income Tax Act is 25% plus <b>solidarity</b> <b>surcharge</b> of 5.5% on the final withholding tax and possible church tax (8 or 9% of the flat tax). This makes a total of Abgeltungsteuer of 26.375% church tax excluded.The surplus income from capital assets cannot be shortened by the overall deductions through lump sum or actual expenses. In their place, the saver's allowance {{in the amount of}} 801 € will be used as deduction (Art. 20 Para. 9 German Income Tax Act). However actually there are several decisions in court to rule on that restricted deduction possibility.|$|E
40|$|The {{tax burden}} of typical wage income earners in Germany is analyzed. It {{turns out that}} the overall tax rate (wage income tax, <b>solidarity</b> <b>surcharge,</b> {{contributions}} to social security) for selected singles will go up in the period 2013 - 2017 if the tax rules will not be changed. The main reason is the progressivity of the income tax rate structure. In order to avoid stronger disincentives to work, the income tax rate structure should be indexed according {{to the development of the}} average wage income...|$|E
40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} legal {{regulations}} of income taxation of business {{companies in the}} Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany. The main objective of the thesis is to analyze relevant Czech and German legal provisions and to compare the law through {{the structure of the}} thesis and a brief summary. The thesis is divided into an introduction, a conclusion and six chapters. The first chapter is concerned with an income tax in the Czech Republic, the second one with an international double taxation and the next three chapters with an income taxation of business companies in Germany. The last one summarizes some {{of the differences between the}} legal regulations and offers a tax calculation according to German law. The systems of income taxation of business companies in the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany show both differences and similarities. The most significant differences rest in greater tax burden of business companies in Germany and the existence of so called <b>solidarity</b> <b>surcharge</b> (Solidaritätszuschlag) and the business tax (Gewerbesteuer).

40|$|The paper {{addresses}} {{the question whether}} the preferential treatment of retained earnings according to section 34 a EStG is suitable to achieve a comparable tax burden of partnerships and corporations. To calculate the tax burden on retained earnings requires {{the combination of the}} progressive personal income tax, the trade tax, which varies widely depending on the community and partnerships payments for interest, rent, leasing, and royalties, as well as the preferential tax rate. The resulting tax has to match the business tax rate of corporations, in order to tax retentions irrespective of the legal form. It turns out that, due to the specifics of the German local tax, the reduced tax rate has to be calculated individually. It can be shown {{that it is impossible to}} determine a reference value for all domestic companies. By introducing a "virtual principle of separation" (virtuelles Trennungsprinzip) we allow entrepreneurs to separate between the level of the firm and the ow ner of the firm, when retained earnings are to be taxed. The retained profit is taxed at the corporate income tax rate of 15 %, the <b>solidarity</b> <b>surcharge</b> of 5. 5 % and the trade tax rate; once the profit is distributed, it is taxed at the progressive personal income tax rate of the partner. business taxation; preferential treatment of retained earnings; principle of separation; trade tax...|$|E
