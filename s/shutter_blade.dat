40|$|An {{array of}} {{individually}} addressable micro-shutters is being designed for spectroscopic applications. Details {{of the design}} are presented in a companion paper. The mechanical design of a single shutter element has been completed.

40|$|A microshutter array (MSA) {{has been}} {{developed}} for use as an aperture array for multi-object selections in James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) technology. Light shields, molybdenum nitride (MoN) coating on shutters, and aluminum/aluminum oxide coatings on interior walls are put on each shutter for light leak prevention, and to enhance optical contrast. Individual shutters are patterned with a torsion flexure that permits shutters to open 90 deg. with a minimized mechanical stress concentration. The shutters are actuated magnetically, latched, and addressed electrostatically. Also, micromechanical features are tailored onto individual shutters to prevent stiction. An individual shutter consists of a torsion hinge, a <b>shutter</b> <b>blade,</b> a front electrode that is coated on the <b>shutter</b> <b>blade,</b> a backside electrode that is coated on the interior walls, and a magnetic cobalt-iron coating. The magnetic coating is patterned into stripes on microshutters so that shutters can respond to an external magnetic field for the magnetic actuation. A set of column electrodes is placed on top of shutters, {{and a set of}} row electrodes on sidewalls is underneath the shutters {{so that they can be}} electrostatically latched open. A linear permanent magnet is aligned with the shutter rows and is positioned above a flipped upside-down array, and sweeps across the array in a direction parallel to shutter columns. As the magnet sweeps across the array, sequential rows of shutters are rotated from their natural horizontal orientation to a vertical open position, where they approach vertical electrodes on the sidewalls. When the electrodes are biased with a sufficient electrostatic force to overcome the mechanical restoring force of torsion bars, shutters remain latched to vertical electrodes in their open state. When the bias is removed, or is insufficient, the shutters return to their horizontal, closed positions. To release a shutter, both the electrode on the shutter and the one on the back wall where the shutter sits are grounded. The shutters with one or both ungrounded electrodes are held open. Sub-micron bumps underneath light shields and silicon ribs on back walls are the two features to prevent stiction. These features ensure that the microshutter array functions properly in mechanical motions. The MSA technology can be used primarily in multi-object imaging and spectroscopy, photomask generation, light switches, and in the stepper equipment used to make integrated circuits and MEMS (microelectromechanical systems) devices...|$|E
40|$|The figure shows {{parts of}} a shutter {{mechanism}} designed to satisfy a number of requirements specific to its original intended application {{as a component of}} an atomic clock to be flown in outer space. The mechanism may also be suitable for use in laboratory and industrial vacuum systems on Earth for which there are similar requirements. The requirements include the following: a) To alternately close, then open, a 1. 5 -cm-diameter optical aperture twice per second, with a stroke time of no more than 15 ms, during a total operational lifetime of at least a year; b) To attenuate light by a factor of at least 1012 when in the closed position; c) To generate little or no magnetic field; d) To be capable of withstanding bakeout at a temperature of 200 C to minimize outgassing during subsequent operation in an ultrahigh vacuum; and e) To fit within a diameter of 12 in. (= 305 mm) a size limit dictated by the size of an associated magnetic shield. The light-attenuation requirement is satisfied by use of overlapping shutter blades. The closure of the aperture involves, among other things, insertion of a single <b>shutter</b> <b>blade</b> between a pair of shutter blades. The requirement to minimize the magnetic field is satisfied by use of piezoelectric actuators. Because piezoelectric actuators cannot withstand bakeout, they must be mounted outside the vacuum chamber, and, hence, motion must be transmitted from the actuators to the shutter levers via a vacuum-chamber-wall diaphragm...|$|E

40|$|This report {{summarizes}} {{the results obtained}} from the SMOV UVIS bowtie program, designed to monitor for detector hysteresis {{as well as to}} apply a QE ‘pinning ’ exposure. Twice a day during SMOV, a triplet of internal flatfields was obtained: a short exposure before and after a deliberately saturated exposure. While no characteristic ‘bowtie ’ features were found in the on-orbit data, a low level of hysteresis (~ 4 %) does appear to be present immediately after the CCDs are cooled to operating temperature; in all cases, the saturated exposure successfully quenched the hysteresis. Any future UVIS detector cooldown should be followed immediately by at least one bowtie visit; the required frequency of bowtie visits between cooldowns is still to be determined though lab tests on a spare device indicate that once a week or less may be more than sufficient. Additional results, unrelated to the hysteresis issue, are: the tungsten lamp has a slightly longer warm up time than allotted by the commanding, the lamp output has declined by ~ 0. 5 % over the ~ 60 days in SMOV, the <b>shutter</b> <b>blade</b> B exhibits slight differences in its acceleration, manifested as striping at the ~ 0. 5 % peak to peak level in image ratios, and the F 475 X wheel exhibits a 1 -step, or 0. 5 degree, offset in positioning approximately 3 % of the time.

40|$|A complex MEMS microshutter {{array system}} has been {{developed}} at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) {{for use as a}} multi-object aperture array for a Near-Infrared Spectrometer (NIRSpec). The NIRSpec is one of the four major instruments carried by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), the next generation of space telescope after the Hubble Space Telescope retires. The microshutter arrays (MSAs) are designed for the selective transmission of light with high efficiency and high contrast. It is demonstrated in Figure 1 how a MSA is used as a multiple object selector in deep space. The MSAs empower the NIRSpec instrument simultaneously collect spectra from more than 100 targets therefore increases the instrument efficiency 100 times or more. The MSA assembly is one of three major innovations on JWST and the first major MEMS devices serving observation missions in space. The MSA system developed at NASA GSFC is assembled with four quadrant fully addressable 365 x 171 shutter arrays that are actuated magnetically, latched and addressed electrostatically. As shown in Figure 2, each MSA is fabricated out of a 4 ' silicon-on-insulator (SOI) wafer using MEMS bulk-micromachining technology. Individual shutters are close-packed silicon nitride membranes with a pixel size close to 100 x 200 pm (Figure 3). Shutters are patterned with a torsion flexure permitting shutters to open 90 degrees with a minimized mechanical stress concentration. In order to prevent light leak, light shields are made on to the surrounding frame of each shutter to cover the gaps between the shutters and the Game (Figure 4). Micro-ribs and sub-micron bumps are tailored on hack walls and light shields, respectively, to prevent sticktion, shown in Figures 4 and 5. JWST instruments are required to operate at cryogenic temperatures as low as 35 K, though they are to be subjected to various levels of ground tests at room temperature. The shutters should therefore maintain nearly flat in the entire temperature range between 35 K and 300 K. Through intensive numerical simulations and experimental studies, an optically opaque and electrically conductive metal-nitride thin film was selected as a coating material deposited on the shutters with the best thermal-expansion match to silicon nitride - the <b>shutter</b> <b>blade</b> thin film material. A shutter image shown in Figure 6 was taken at room temperature, presenting shutters slightly bowing down as expected. Shutters become flat when the temperature decreases to 35 K. The MSAs are then bonded to silicon substrates that are fabricated out of 6 " single-silicon wafers in the thickness of 2 mm. The bonding is conducted using a novel single-sided indium flip-chip bonding technology. Indium bumps fabricated on a substrate are shown in Figure 7. There are 180, 000 indium bumps for bonding a flight format MSA array to its substrate. Besides a MSA, each substrate houses five customer-designed ASIC (Application Specific Integrated Circuit) multiplexer/address chips for 2 -dimensional addressing, twenty capacitors, two temperature sensors, numbers of resistors and all necessary interconnects, as shown in Figure 8. Complete MSA quadrant assemblies have been successfully manufactured and fully functionally tested. The assemblies have passed a series of critical reviews required by JWST in satisfying all the design specifications. The qualification tests cover programmable 2 -D addressing, life tests, optical contrast tests, and environmental tests including radiation, vibration, and acoustic tests. A 2 -D addressing pattern with 'ESA' letters programmed in a MSA is shown in Figure 9. The MSAs passed 1 million cycle life tests and achieved high optical contrast over 10, 000. MSA teams are now making progress in final fabrication, testing and assembly (Figure 10). The delivery of flight-format MSA system is scheduled at the end of 2008 for being integrated to the focal plane of the NIRSpec detectors...|$|E
