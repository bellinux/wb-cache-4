30|$|More {{important}} {{for the development of}} standard contracts was the restructuring of collective bargaining and company-level strategies. First, beginning in the 1990 s, <b>sectoral</b> <b>negotiations</b> linking wages, working time and job stability were mostly characteristic of the core manufacturing sector in Germany. This led to increased flexibility within collective agreements regarding pay and working time adjustment. In the medium and long run, these steps of restructuring contributed to regaining competitiveness in the export-oriented sector and the relative stabilization of standard employment contracts for the core labour force, albeit at conditions which are less ‘rigid’ and more flexible than in the past. At the same time, however, manufacturing employers also promoted outsourcing and offshoring, thereby redrawing the borders of the core workforce more narrowly. One has to note further that major employment gains in standard employment contracts occurred in the private service sector, most notably in highly skilled occupations, which offset the stagnating and rather shrinking employment capacity of the manufacturing sector. However, collective bargaining coverage is much lower in many of the most dynamic private services, which also contributes to the increase in wage dispersion and low pay (Dustmann et al. 2009; Dustmann et al. 2014).|$|R

30|$|Above {{individual}} firm level, collective bargaining {{may be involved}} in explicit flexibility/security trade-offs, but only where bargaining takes a co-ordinated form, with unions and employers associations being so structured that they cannot easily avoid taking responsibility for macro-economic consequences of their actions, including a significant role for unions and associations representing the exposed sector of the economy (Traxler 2003; Traxler et al. 2001; Traxler et al. 2008). This takes us back to something similar to the politics of the counter-inflation strategy in the 1970 s. Different forms of coordination will have different implications for different patterns of flexibility and security: for example, the difference between vertical and horizontal coordination and the role of <b>sectoral</b> or company-level <b>negotiations.</b> Some forms are more consistent than others with the maintenance of security traditionally associated with multi-employer, sector (or inter-sector) bargaining.|$|R

40|$|Comme dans de nombreux autres pays industrialisés, l'on assiste en Allemagne, depuis une dizaine d'années, à une {{nouvelle}} donne des relations professionnelles sous l'influence notamment des politiques de flexibilité du travail. La réunification entamée en 1989 a également contribué, pour sa part, à modifier les relations collectives de travail. Centré sur les mutations en cours, cet article met en évidence les limites du transfert institutionnel du système de relations professionnelles de l'Ouest vers l'Allemagne oriental et montre, qu'en dépit de telles difficultés, la réunification a contribué à accentuer le processus de décentralisation des négociations collectives qui était déjà perceptible en R. F. A. avant 1989. The aim of {{this article}} is to study the impact of reunification in a specifie area of German society, namely industrial relations. The following two hypotheses are tested: firstly, in spite of the active role of the main union confederation of workers (the DGB), reunification has not yet given rise to a complete homogenization of industrial relations Systems; and, secondly, in the former regions QLander), reunification has intensified the already perceptible trend towards decentralization of collective bargaining. To test these hypotheses, we draw upon a series of interviews with union and management representatives of the former and new Lander, as well as German industrial relations researchers. Moreover, a review of union and management literature published on the subject since reunification was carried out. The German industrial relations System is based essentially on regional and <b>sectoral</b> <b>negotiations,</b> in tandem with the principle of non-conflictual action and negotiation at the level of the firm. Among numerous indicators, two significant laws (the 1952 law on works councils and the 1972 law that reformed the councils) justify the thesis that for more than thirty years, a "neo-corporatist" architecture has framed the social relations of work in Germany. However, since the 1980 s, the imperatives of work time flexibility, the emergence of new forms of work rationalization and strategies to externalize certain productive activities have undermined the principle of branch bargaining and justified the existence of decentralized bargaining. Reunification of the two Germanys has also had a significant impact on the industrial relations System. Although the unification process has varied considerably from one federation to another, the DGB was quick to push for the dissolution of the former East German confederation and to seek to transfer the West German model of industrial relations to the new Lander. However, the transfer of institutions encountered many obstacles. Besides the difficulties in harmonizing bargaining demands (e. g., was it necessary to equalize salary levels between the East and West?), the honeymoon between West German trade unionists and workers in the East quickly came to an end. In the face of massive layoffs, many works council members in the new Lander soon felt that the union offered little help in fighting massive unemployment or in promoting modemization of enterprises. This resulted in a loss of support for the D. G. B. (which had benefited from a large wave of memberships in the East following on the heels of reunification) and a strong preference for enterprise-level negotiations. More generally, economie differences between the West and East within the same industry made it difficult to apply the same collective agreement from one region to another. Bearing in mind, as well, new management strategies aimed at denouncing certain social agreements and the explosion of agreements on models of work organization, reunification will therefore have contributed to accentuating the decentralization of industrial relations, and perhaps more fundamentally modifying the rules of the game of the bargaining System which emerged in Germany during the past decades...|$|R

30|$|In other words, the semi-elasticity {{of wages}} to {{unemployment}} {{when the economy}} is in recession is low, and it is not found to vary with the unemployment level. When the economy moves out of the recession, real wages are found to show a greater link to business cycle conditions, although lower than in other countries. In these expansionary periods, a low level of unemployment rate is associated with additional wage pressures, while {{this is not the case}} in recessionary periods. These results indicate the existence of significant asymmetries in wage formation in Spain, possibly reflecting the impact of the prevailing labor market institutions, such as the interaction between the very high duality between permanent and temporary workers and the prevalence of <b>sectoral</b> levels of <b>negotiations.</b> Overall, this collective bargaining system could be characterized as providing a high level of protection to working conditions of the incumbents or insiders in the labor market, while concerns over the access to a job for those in unemployment are set aside in the bargaining process. As a result, both high levels of unemployment and wage growth can coexist during the first stages of economic recovery, therefore delaying the necessary reduction in unemployment.|$|R
40|$|In Belgium, {{as in most}} {{countries}} in Western Europe, the most important conditions of employment {{for the vast majority}} of employees in the private sector are regulated by collective agreements. Nevertheless, the content of these collective agreements and the collective bargaining process in Belgium has not yet been the subject of much systematic research on the basis of an explicit scientific frame of reference. The study described here constitutes a first attempt at making the phenomenon of collective bargaining a subject of academic research. Starting with 37 JCs in the private sector, we analysed the content of the collective agreements that were negotiated and measured their relevant institutional, organisational and socio-economic characteristics. This makes it possible to answer questions such as: to what extent does the dominant level of <b>negotiation</b> (<b>sectoral</b> or company level) influence the content of the collective agreement? What effect does the level of organisation of trade union federations and employer federations have on the collective agreements negotiated by them? To what extent do socio-economic characteristics of the sector for which bargaining is taking place - such as the level of competition, sensitivity to exports or the structure of the sector - determine the results of the negotiations? This paper makes a start on coming up with answers to all these questions...|$|R
40|$|In recent United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) <b>negotiations,</b> <b>sectoral</b> {{mechanisms}} were {{proposed as}} a way to encourage early action and spur investment in low carbon technologies in developing countries, particularly in the electricity sector. Sectoral trading, which is one such proposition, involves including a sector from one or more nations in an international cap-and-trade system. In order to assess potential impacts from such a mechanism, we analyze trade in carbon permits between the Chinese electricity sector and a U. S. economy-wide cap-and-trade program using the MIT Emissions Prediction and Policy Analysis (EPPA) model. We find that this sectoral policy induces significant financial transfers between the two countries. In 2030, the U. S. purchases permits valued at $ 42 billion from China, which represents more than 46 % of its capped emissions. Despite these transfers, there is only a small change in Chinese welfare. In the U. S., the availability of relatively cheap emissions permits significantly reduces the cost of climate policy. In China, sectoral trading increases the price of electricity and reduces the amount of electricity generated, particularly from coal, while opposite effects are observed in the U. S. Despite increases in the price of electricity in China, only small increases in electricity generation from nuclear and renewables are projected in the timeframe of our analysis (2010 - 2030). Because the price of coal decree ses, we also find that sectoral trading leads to emissions increases in non-electricity sectors in China, a form of internal carbon leakage.

40|$|Many of {{the most}} {{persistent}} and emerging public issues involve multiple, contested and intersecting problem threads. Finding solutions to such complex problems is increasingly understood to come {{as a result of}} the amalgamation of expertise, knowledge and commitment held in diverse groups of actors. However, since each of these actors or stakeholders comes from different social worlds and bring particular views, expectations, skills and resources to the problem, when their paths intersect integrating mechanisms are needed that are able to reconcile different perspectives and synthesise their different, but relevant sets of information, create common understandings and generate new shared knowledge. The notion of a boundary object, or set of artefacts that provide the processes or places to link diverse interests, has been shown to play an important role in cross disciplinary knowledge sharing and creation (Kimble, 2010). Despite the growing theoretical attention directed to the boundary object, it remains a mostly abstract or conceptual tool, with little research done in practice or real world to flesh out if and how it can facilitate the emergence of common knowledge and knowledge creation across organisational or <b>sectoral</b> boundaries. <b>Negotiation</b> is one context in which the boundary object concept has been applied as a tool for mediating multi-party conflicts (e. g. Koskinen and Mäkinen, 2009). In this paper, however, we explore the idea that negotiation is itself a form of boundary object. Negotiation is defined as a process whereby two or more parties with some apparent conflict seek to do better jointly than each could achieve alone (Lax and Sebenius, 1986). Negotiation is largely intuitively understood yet rarely clearly articulated in practice. In this largely conceptual paper we explore the specific role of negotiation, primarily integrative negotiation, as a boundary object for sharing, synthesizing and creating knowledge, practice and improved understanding across disciplinary boundaries involved in public administration. In so doing, we draw on (a) literature and (b) an analysis of secondary data to determine first if negotiation itself can be considered a boundary-object, or if it is the negotiation artefacts such as plans, agendas, offers and space that play a role in addressing complex, transdisciplinary issues and the generation of knowledge and new/transformative solutions. In addressing this objective, the paper explores the complex question of whether negotiation, as a process, can be a boundary object or whether it is the negotiation artefacts that are the objects. We envisage the findings will contribute practical knowledge of the skills and processes needed in negotiating the sharing of complex knowledge across multiple disciplinary boundaries. From the findings we will craft an emergent theoretical model for a boundary object approach to negotiation to better explain how the use of boundary objects may facilitate participation by individuals involved in resolution of interdisciplinary issues and the design of new ways forward. Thus the paper contributes to the earlier goals of Star and Griesemer (1989) in their introduction of boundary objects as helping to “translate, negotiate, debate, triangulate and simplify in order to work together”...|$|R
40|$|Summary for Economic Policy: The {{starting}} {{date of the}} European Monetary Union (EMU) is coming close. After several years of intense efforts, eleven European Union (EU) countries are prepared to go ahead. Belgium {{is one of those}} countries. This is a step of great importance. Gradually, the attention is shifting from the preparation of EMU to the question whether EMU will work. In Belgium much of this discussion focuses on the performance of the labour market. Belgium is a country with relatively high structural unemployment. The country is also confronted with a substantial regional gap in economic growth and unemployment. This diverging economic performance gives rise to politically sensitive interregional transfers between the North and the South. There is a widespread concern that the Belgian labour market will fail to cope efficiently with the need to adjust to changing economic conditions. While a macroeconomic wage restraint with respect to the major trading partners is ingrained in the so-called ‘law to safeguard the Belgian competitive position’, the country has been repeatedly urged by institutions such as the IMF and the OECD to promote wage and labour market flexibility, as well as to increase labour mobility. The prime minister, Jean-Luc Dehaene, pleaded recently for less government intervention in the wage formation process and for a greater wage differentiation that takes into account the diverging conditions that exist in various sectors of the economy. This position is shared by Karel Vinck, the head of the Flemish Employer Organisation (VEV), who views an increased role for <b>sectoral</b> <b>negotiations</b> between unions and employers as a means to achieving wage differentiation in the Belgian economy. And also Karel Boone, the president of the Belgian Employer Federation (VBO), emphasises the responsability of the sectoral level in the Belgian wage negotiations. Is this concern about insufficient labour market adjustment warranted ? The answer to this question requires a detailed understanding of the structural features in the Belgian economy. Subsequently, one must assess whether wages adjust to those economic shocks. Both issues are the focus of this study. After a theoretical discussion of the statistical framework (which can be skipped by the technically less inclined reader), the second part of this paper offers a detailed picture of changes in production that occurred in the Belgian economy during the period 1985 - 1995. Those production shocks were strong and, to an important degree, can be statistically decomposed in developments at the national, regional and sectoral level. Sectoral shocks are changes that are observed within the same industry in Flanders, Brussels and Wallonia but that are not shared by other sectors. Those sectoral changes are the dominant driving force in the Belgian economy. In our statistical exercise, the sectoral component explains an average of 47 % of total output variation and 76 % of the output changes explained by our statistical model. Even higher numbers are obtained when changes in employment and labour productivity are considered. The message is clear : the main source of differentiation in the Belgian economy is found at the sectoral level. These average figures mask a lot of interesting variation in individual industrial and service sectors. We distinguish between a small group of sectors that experience a structurally better growth performance than a group of poor performers. In between those two groups, a large number of primarily manufacturing industries are situated with a comparable growth performance. Looking at the cyclical pattern of individual sectors, there is not much evidence for very different nor for very similar sector-specific business cycles. One interesting exception is the countercyclical role of the government. Apparently, the government increases spending on public services in times of an economic slowdown. In this paper, regional shocks are defined as output developments that occur in all sectors of a specific region. We find evidence of such shocks but they are of secondary importance when compared to sectoral changes. Apparently, many of the observed regional trends are caused by developments in specific sectors that are primarily located in one region. Having said this, the well-known regional division of the Belgian economy emerges clearly from the statistical model. Flanders is characterised by a better medium-term growth performance, a different cyclical pattern and a greater similarity in regional output changes than either Brussels or Wallonia. By definition, national shocks are found in all sectors and in all regions. From 1985 to 1995 they accounted for 9 % of the total output variation and for 14 % of the production changes explained by our model. National factors matter mostly for a limited group of sectors including Metal Products, Construction, Other Market Services and Other Manufacturing. In an efficient labour market, we expect wage growth to reflect the dominating role of developments at the sectoral level. In the third part of the study, we found this not to be the case in the Belgian economy. While wage levels to some degree reflect long term sectoral productivity differentials, wage growth displays little differentiation across sectors. This lack of sectoral wage flexibility amplifies the impact of the production shocks on employment. Weaker sectors are faced with wage increases which they can ill afford. As a result, the employment performance gap between stronger and weaker sectors widens. In the end, the Belgian economy is faced with a substantial and widespread need for employment reallocation, for which the rigid labour market with limited labour mobility is ill prepared. A greater sectoral wage flexibility would avoid many of those problems. What about regional differentiation in wage setting ? There is no sign that Belgian wage increases are taking into account regional differences. This comes mostly {{at the expense of the}} weakest region, Wallonia, which suffers from higher unemployment than would be obtained if regional wage moderation were feasible. Quite likely, greater sectoral wage differentiation would contribute a lot to regional wage flexibility. Wherever necessary, this sectoral approach could be supplemented by greater attention to the regional dimension in wage setting. Such complementary approach would reduce the need for politically sensitive long-term interregional transfers and in this way enhance political cohesion in the country. ...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. Env. Dev.) -University of Natal, Pietermaritzburg, 2002. In the Twenty-first Century, {{sustainable}} {{water management}} {{is likely to}} be humanity's greatest challenge in a world of ever-increasing demand. Legal instruments both international and national regulate and provide a general framework for the use and management of international waters. Future basin management agreements can be informed by examining the degree of success, in terms of sustainability and equity, achieved by such agreements. That success can be influenced by the degree to which such agreements support the human right to water implicitly stated in international customary law, through a collaborative management approach. Since 1988, attempts by communities on the Pongolo floodplain to be involved in Pongolopoort Dam releases, have met with little success. Recently, the Department of Water Affairs and Forestry has begun to support those efforts, but the approach remains a sectoral one, and is primarily concerned with water issues. The South African National Water Act 36 of 1998 provides for environmental management and public participation, as well as providing explicitly for the rights of individual water users, but its implementation is hampered by an overwhelming emphasis on technical considerations and a lack of political will to embrace collaborative management systems. Little effort is expended on collaborative management methods, though the level of transparency in water management is improving, despite remaining highly centralised. The level and extent of incentives for local community participation is low, and systematic monitoring is in its early development. International river basin agreements generally take a top-down or state-driven approach, though there are some examples where local cross-border communities have participated successfully in the implementation of international agreements and management of transboundary basins. South Africa, Swaziland and M 09 ambique signed the Interim Incomaputo Agreement, which includes the Maputo basin, in August 2002. Once again, the approach to this agreement has been highly <b>sectoral</b> in that <b>negotiations</b> were handled entirely by water officials in the relevant countries. A lack of transparency has prevailed in the negotiation stages, though through the basin studies, which will inform implementation plans, the level of participation should improve. There is overwhelming consensus that integrated management is the key to sustainable international river basin management. Formal and systematic methods for inter-departmental communication, both nationally and internationally are currently not being implemented, which has significant negative impacts on integrated management. Research in this area represents an opportunity to explore collaborative management of an international river basin in an area that is, as yet, unstressed in terms of population and water supply...|$|R
