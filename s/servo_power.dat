40|$|ABSTRACT- Forward {{converter}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} studied topologies due to its lower ripple, lower parts count and hence high reliability. Owing to the need of miniaturization of Inertial Navigation System, a mini power module had to be developed for which forward converter topology was selected. A configuration of grouping the outputs into HMCS was attempted. The converter for DTG <b>servo</b> <b>power</b> amplifier had to supply the current demanded by the sensor electronics which is dynamic. Interleaved forward converter provides a better solution to satisfy the increased power and dynamic load conditions. As an added advantage, though one portion gets faulty, the other portion can provide half the maximum load, giving continuous power. The paper discusses the benefits of interleaving in the converter supplying the <b>servo</b> <b>power</b> amplifier experiencing dynamic load conditions and simulations for both single and interleaved converter design validation...|$|E

40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 29 -November 02, 1990 / Riviera Hotel and Convention Center, Las Vegas, NevadaThe seven WSMR Transportable Telemetry Acquisition Systems (TTAS), {{have served}} WSMR well as primary {{telemetry}} tracking systems since their acquisition {{over twenty years}} ago. Increasing maintenance demands for the original analog position control system (the antenna feed, <b>servo</b> <b>power</b> amplifiers, and position compensation) coupled {{with the potential for}} substantial tracking system performance improvement and self-diagnostic capability offered by current technology led to the establishment of a new instrumentation development task at WSMR whose objective was {{the development of a new}}, almost totally digital prototype tracking system to replace the aging analog control system in one of the TTAS’s. A modern conical scan feed has replaced the original monopulse feed, pulse-width-modulated power amplifiers have replaced the originals using SCR’s, and a VMEbus-based computer using a real-time operating system has replaced the analog compensation and overall control of the system. In this paper, following an overview of the prototype tracking system, the results of the development of a new position control algorithm for the prototype tracking system are described using root loci, computer simulation, and from the actual tracking system using servo test software developed for the computer controller. The results of the study of the old analog control system using computer simulation are presented for comparison. Problems encountered with the TTAS directly affecting position control are also presented. The new position control algorithm was designed to accommodate all of the critical tracking system nonlinearities (power amplifier saturation, current limiting, dead band, and control output saturation), all tracking modes (autotrack, manual, and using external pointing data), different operating bandwidths, and all possible drive inputs to the system.

40|$|This {{project was}} {{selected}} by the U. S. Department of Energy under a DOE solicitation “Low Wind Speed Technology for Small Turbine Development. ” The objective of this project has been to design a new small wind turbine with improved cost, reliability and performance in grid-connected residential and small business applications, {{in order to achieve}} the overall DOE goal of cost effectiveness in Class 3 wind resources that can now be achieved in Class 5 resources. The scope of work for this project has been to complete the preliminary design of an improved small wind turbine, including preliminary loads and strength analyses; analysis and design of all major components; systems integration and structural dynamic analysis; estimation of life-cycle cost of energy; and design documentation and review. The project did not entail hardware fabrication or testing. The WEI 6 K Turbine resulting from this project is an upwind horizontal-axis wind turbine rated at 6 kW. It features a 3 -blade 7 -m diameter rotor. The generator is a direct-drive permanent magnet synchronous machine generating 3 -phase power at 240 VAC. The turbine is maintained oriented in to the wind via active yaw control using electromechanical <b>servos.</b> <b>Power</b> is regulated with active blade pitch control. The turbine is presently designed to be placed on a 100 -foot (30 m) tower. The turbine is predicted to generate electricity at a levelized cost of energy (COE) between 7. 3 and 8. 9 ¢/kWh at an IEC Class II site, with an average wind speed of 8. 5 m/s at hub height, depending upon whether the customer uses a guyed truss tower (the lower figure) or a monopole tower. For the NREL Reference Site, with a mean wind speed of 5. 35 m/s at 10 m height, the turbine would generate at a levelized cost of energy of between 9. 7 and 11. 9 ¢/kWh. The lowest of these numbers is presently competitive with retail electricity rates in most of the country. The 8. 9 ¢/kWh is still competitive with retail rates in many regions of the country with high electricity costs. The study further concludes that several design changes could shave 10 - 14 % from the cost of energy determined in the preliminary design. These changes include a new tower design that offers tilt-up capability without guy wires and takes better advantage of the lowered loads produced by pitch control; design a family of airfoils more appropriate for pitch regulation on a turbine of this size; tune the pitch controller properly to minimize shedding of power during turbulent operation in the transition from Region 2 to 3; value engineer the pitch system to shave costs, including consideration of a collective pitch system; and refine the design of the hub and main frame castings to minimize weight and cost. We are generally encouraged by the results. These preliminary numbers show that we can produce a turbine that is competitive with retail electric rates at relatively windy IEC Class II sites. With further improvements in the design, we believe the turbine could be competitive at sites with lesser wind resource...|$|R
40|$|A {{programmable}} hybrid mechanism (PHM) is {{a combination}} of a servomechanism with a conventionally driven mechanism and has the potential to combine the advantages of both. A PHM can generate the output movement that is possible in a conventional mechanism and also permit these movements to be modulated using the servo-actuator.

A PHM can provide better tuning of motion characteristics than those obtainable from servomechanisms alone. It has also been claimed that due to the sharing of power between the main drive and the <b>servo</b> drive, the <b>power</b> rating necessary for the servo actuator can be lowered, thus offering a cost advantage compared to the system using only the servo-drive.
