40|$|ABSTRACT South Africa’s ‘housing {{programme}} ’ transfers a fully-funded <b>serviced</b> <b>site</b> {{and house}} to qualifying beneficiaries with aims of progressively addressing poverty through homeownership. Despite delivering close to 3 million houses since 1994, informal housing persists, featuring even {{in some of}} these new neighbourhoods. This paper focuses on the intersection between a particular mode of informal housing, backyard dwellings, and state-subsidised low-income housing projects. Backyard dwellings arguably contradict state housing objectives by symbolising informality and disorder; a symptom of inadequacy that the housing programme strives to overcome. We consider first the views and experiences of landlords (owners of state-subsided houses) and tenants (occupiers of privately-provided backyard dwellings) in a section of Alexandra, Johannesburg. We then reflect on the potential of backyard accommodation within post-apartheid housing delivery, arguing that despite challenges, the phenomenon of planned, state-led infrastructure generating secondary accommodation represents an opportunity rather than an example of failed modernity. South Africa’s backyard dwellings resonate with similar forms of self-funded and managed rental stock across the global South. As a quick, flexible and regenerative housing asset, cumulative acceptance of such rental markets is necessary – along with viewing the driving actors as astute innovators in shelter and livelihood provision...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The MaxBRNN problem finds {{a region}} such that {{setting up a}} new <b>service</b> <b>site</b> within this region would {{guarantee}} {{the maximum number of}} customers by proximity. This problem assumes that each customer only uses the service provided by his/her nearest <b>service</b> <b>site.</b> However, in reality, a customer tends to go to his/her k nearest <b>service</b> <b>sites.</b> To handle this, MaxBRNN can be extended to the MaxBRkNN problem which finds an optimal region such that setting up a <b>service</b> <b>site</b> in this region guarantees the maximum number of customers who would consider the site as one of their k nearest service locations. We further generalize the MaxBRkNN problem to reflect the real world scenario where customers may have different preferences for different <b>service</b> <b>sites,</b> and at the same time, <b>service</b> <b>sites</b> may have preferred targeted customers. In this paper, we present an efficient solution called MaxFirst to solve this generalized MaxBRkNN problem. The algorithm works by partitioning the space into quadrants and searches only in those quadrants that potentially contain an optimal region. During the space partitioning, we compute the upper and lower bounds of the size of a quadrant’s BRkNN, and use these bounds to prune the unpromising quadrants. Experiment results show that MaxFirst can be two to three orders of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art algorithm. I...|$|R

40|$|The Data Committee of the Great Plains Genetics Service Network (GPGSN) {{coordinates}} {{the collection}} of data relating to delivery of genetic services in eight states. These states are Iowa, Missouri, Arkansas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Nebraska, South Dakota and North Dakota. The funds allocated to this project by the GPGSN are limited. The distance between genetics <b>service</b> <b>sites</b> is great and the population density in the regions being served is low. The local resources available to the genetics <b>services</b> <b>sites</b> participating in data collection vary from robust to "bare-bones". The approach to solving the problem involved the following. First the committee the data items to be collected were identified and defined. Second, a standard format for transmitting the data to the GPGSN regional coordinating center in Iowa City was developed. Third, the <b>services</b> <b>sites</b> and their resources for collecting data were identified. Fourth, resources were allocated to different sites {{in a manner that}} seemed most able to help that center to contribute data to the regional center. Fifth, data were aggregated at the regional center and aggregated data reports were returned to collecting sites. Finally, items were modified in response to the feedback received from the genetics <b>services</b> <b>sites.</b> Although the philosophy is that data collection should be a by-product of providing quality genetic services, the region recognizes that <b>service</b> <b>sites</b> will need help to conform with regional standards. Therefore the region encourages each <b>service</b> <b>site</b> to develop its own method to collect data, and provides assistance to it in getting the data into the regional transmission format.

40|$|Thesis (D. Ed.) [...] University of Melbourne, Dept. of Education, 2001 Program {{development}} through program clarification is an emerging field for evaluators committed to developing responsive and clear program designs. In this study, {{the use of}} program clarification approaches, designed to assist implementation of a major policy change, was explored at a policy and service level of an organisation. A new service delivery program (SDP) {{was the focus of}} program clarification, which was conducted in two phases. In Phase I (policy level), the main aim was to make the essential features of the SDP explicit to those responsible for system level change. This was achieved through evaluability assessment, during which document analyses, 12 semi-structured interviews with senior managers, and a group interview with <b>service</b> <b>site</b> managers were conducted. This resulted {{in the development of a}} clear, policy level, program logic model. Phase I revealed a need for the policy level program to be translated at the <b>service</b> <b>sites.</b> Phase II (<b>service</b> level) was conducted to assist managers at one <b>service</b> <b>site</b> in the development of a SDP implementation and monitoring plan, through the use of program logic and participatory approaches. Reflective practice and a small-scale study conducted by the researcher revealed that the program clarification approaches were useful, especially at the <b>service</b> <b>site</b> level where a high degree of stakeholder participation was achieved. This study focused on one organisation and one <b>service</b> <b>site,</b> thus, its findings cannot be generalised. Nonetheless, this study is one of very few which has attempted to apply program clarification techniques at both system and delivery levels, and to link the findings at these levels.
