2500|$|Stalin {{also tried}} to {{maximise}} Soviet influence on the world stage, unsuccessfully pushing for Libya—recently liberated from Italian occupation—to become a Soviet protectorate. He sent Molotov as his representative to San Francisco {{to take part in}} negotiations to form the United Nations, insisting that the <b>Soviets</b> <b>have</b> a place on the Security Council. In April 1949, the Western powers established the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO), an international military alliance of capitalist countries. Within Western countries, Stalin was increasingly portrayed as the [...] "most evil dictator alive" [...] and compared to Hitler.|$|E
2500|$|T-72M1 (Ob'yekt 172M-E5): this export {{version of}} the T-72A was also built under licence in Poland since 1983. The most obvious {{external}} difference relative to Soviet analogs is the reduced number of KMT mounting points on the lower hull glacis plate. This is the 1st version to feature ceramic sand bars [...] "kwartz" [...] rods in the turret cavity and [...] High Hardness Steel appliqué armor on upper glacis. The reason for introduction of T-72M1 with improved glacis and ceramic turret armor so soon after T-72M was put into production {{was the fact that}} the <b>Soviets</b> <b>have</b> learned in 1982 from the captured Israeli tank, that under certain condition the newest M111 [...] "Hetz" [...] 105mm APFSDS Ammunition could penetrate Soviet standard T-72A upper glacis armor but not the turret.|$|E
2500|$|Bougainville and her grandson, Lee Tong, {{have entered}} into an audacious plan with the Soviet Union to {{engineer}} {{the kidnapping of}} the President of the United States, the Vice President, the Speaker of the House and the President pro tempore of the Senate, the next three men {{in the line of}} succession to the presidency, as part of a project code-named Huckleberry Finn. [...] It is revealed that the Soviet economy is in ruins, a famine is spreading amongst the Eastern Bloc nations and the whole Eastern Bloc may {{be on the verge of}} collapse. [...] The <b>Soviets</b> <b>have</b> devised a plan that calls for the President to undergo a top-secret Soviet mind control procedure, termed [...] "mind intervention", which uses a combination of an implanted microchip and injected memories from a brainwashed Soviet dissident to allow the Soviet government to control the President's thoughts without his knowledge. [...] The other three men are kept in reserve as the procedure only has about a 60% success rate. [...] In return for carrying out the abduction, the Bougainvilles are to receive one billion dollars in gold, which the Soviets intend to cheat them out of while unaware that the Bougainvilles intend to double-cross them as well.|$|E

In response to later Soviet orders, Germany did deliver eight 38.1cm guns and six 40cm guns for which the <b>Soviets</b> <b>had</b> requested drawings.

Pakistan nevertheless requested military aid from the USSR, which was predictably rebuffed as the <b>Soviet</b> Union <b>had</b> previously oriented itself to India. The government's overtures to the Soviet Union were not favorably regarded by Pakistan's conservative middle classes, who regarded the USSR as an atheist and socialist ally of India.|$|R
