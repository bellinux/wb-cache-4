30|$|The {{records of}} all <b>shunts</b> placed between 1973 and 2003 for IIH at one {{institution}} were reviewed by McGirt et al. {{in a series}} of 42 patients treated with 36 VP/VA <b>shunts</b> and 79 LP <b>shunts.</b> All the clinical manifestations of IIH especially the headache were significantly improved after the placement of the <b>shunt</b> in 95 % of the cases. The recurrence of a severe headache occurred in 19 % and 48 % after 12 and 36 [*]months, respectively, post <b>shunt</b> insertion despite a well-functioning <b>shunt.</b> The LP <b>shunts</b> had a threefold increase in <b>shunt</b> obstruction in comparison to VP and VA <b>shunts.</b> However, the risk of distal migration, over drainage and <b>shunt</b> infection was the same in both the LP <b>shunt</b> and the VP/VA <b>shunt</b> groups. In conclusion, <b>shunts</b> are extremely beneficial in the acute treatment of IIH-associated intractable headache, and the majority of patients had a long-term relief. Treatment of IIH with VP/VA <b>shunts</b> was associated with a decreased incidence of <b>shunt</b> obstruction as compared to LP <b>shunts</b> [23].|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{describe}} the morphology of porto-azygos <b>shunts</b> {{in a large}} series of dogs using computed tomography (CT) angiography. Study Design: Retrospective study. Animals: Dogs (n= 36) with porto-azygos <b>shunts.</b> Methods: CT angiography was performed in dogs subsequently proven to have a porto-azygos <b>shunt.</b> The origin and insertion of the <b>shunts</b> were assessed on native images. The diameter of the porto-azygos <b>shunt</b> and the portal vein, cranial and caudal to the <b>shunt</b> origin, were measured. The porto-azygos <b>shunt</b> anatomy was studied on three-dimensional images. Results: All porto-azygos <b>shunts</b> originated either in the left gastric vein (33 left gastro-azygos <b>shunts)</b> or the right gastric vein (3 right gastro-azygos <b>shunts).</b> Two left gastro-azygos <b>shunts</b> had concurrent caval-azygos continuation and 2 right gastro-azygos <b>shunts</b> had a caudal splenic loop. All <b>shunts</b> crossed the diaphragm through the esophageal hiatus. The majority of porto-azygos <b>shunts</b> (32) followed a straight pathway after traversing the diaphragm, although 4 <b>shunts</b> followed a tortuous route. All <b>shunts</b> terminated in the thoracic part of the azygos vein, perpendicular to the aorta. The <b>shunt</b> diameter at insertion was only 3 mm on average. The insertion site was consistently the narrowest part of the <b>shunt.</b> Conclusion: CT angiography was well suited to provide anatomic details of porto-azygos <b>shunts</b> and comprehensively documented that all porto-azygos <b>shunts</b> had a thoracic terminus, after crossing the diaphragm through the esophageal hiatus. Different <b>shunt</b> types existed with minor variations...|$|R
50|$|Because the <b>shunt</b> {{systems are}} too {{expensive}} for most people in developing countries, such people often die without getting a <b>shunt.</b> Worse, the rate of revision in <b>shunt</b> systems adds {{to the cost of}} <b>shunting</b> many times.

40|$|BACKGROUND [...] <b>Shunt</b> vessels were imaged and <b>shunt</b> flow was {{analysed}} by {{cross sectional}} and Doppler echocardiography in 12 {{patients who had}} had 14 <b>shunt</b> procedures (nine left Blalock-Taussig <b>shunts,</b> three right Blalock-Taussig <b>shunts,</b> one modified Waterston <b>shunt,</b> and one central <b>shunt).</b> METHODS [...] The <b>shunt</b> vessels were classified by echocardiography as uniformly patent, segmentally stenosed, and uniformly stenosed. These findings were {{compared with those of}} angiography. Also the peak flow velocities at the aortic and the pulmonary ends of the <b>shunt</b> vessels were measured by Doppler echocardiography and the ratio of these values was calculated for each <b>shunt.</b> RESULTS [...] Twelve (85. 7 %) of 14 <b>shunt</b> vessels were imaged along their entire length by cross sectional echocardiography. The two remaining <b>shunt</b> vessels were only partially imaged. In 10 patients who also had angiography the echocardiographic and angiographic images of the <b>shunt</b> vessels were identical. The ratio of the peak flow velocity measured at the aortic and the pulmonary ends of the <b>shunt</b> vessel was significantly larger in the segmentally stenosed <b>shunt</b> vessels than in the uniformly patent <b>shunt</b> vessels (p < 0. 001). The ratio in the two <b>shunt</b> vessels only partially imaged by cross sectional echocardiography indicated that they were segmentally stenosed. CONCLUSION [...] The combination of cross sectional and Doppler echocardiography may be useful for determining either the patency or the morphology of an aortopulmonary <b>shunt...</b>|$|R
40|$|BackgroundThe use of <b>shunting</b> during carotid endarterectomy (CEA) is controversial. While some {{surgeons}} advocate routine <b>shunting,</b> others prefer selective <b>shunting</b> or no <b>shunting.</b> Several large series {{have documented}} excellent results of CEA with routine <b>shunting</b> or without <b>shunts.</b> Others reported similar results with selective <b>shunting</b> using transcranial Doppler (TCD), electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring, carotid stump pressure (SP), cervical block anesthesia (CBA), and {{somatosensory evoked potential}} (SSEP). In this study, we review the available evidence supporting <b>shunting,</b> nonshunting, and selective <b>shunting</b> during CEA. MethodsAn electronic PubMed/MEDLINE search was conducted to identify all published CEA studies between January 1990 and December 2010, that analyzed the perioperative outcome of routine <b>shunting,</b> routine nonshunting, routine versus selective <b>shunting,</b> selecting <b>shunting</b> versus avoiding a <b>shunt,</b> and selective <b>shunting</b> based on EEG, TCD, SP, CBA, and SSEP. ResultsThe mean reported perioperative stroke rate for CEAs with routine <b>shunting</b> was 1. 4 % and for routine nonshunt was 2 %. Meanwhile, the mean perioperative stroke rates for selecting <b>shunting</b> were 1. 6 % using EEG, 4. 8 % using TCD, 1. 6 % using SP, 1. 8 % using SSEP, and 1. 1 % for CBA. Similar results were noted for perioperative stroke and death rates. ConclusionsThe use of routine <b>shunting</b> and selective <b>shunting</b> {{was associated with a}} low stroke rate. Both methods are acceptable, and the individual surgeon should select the method with which they are more comfortable...|$|R

25|$|In a {{minority}} of people with advanced cirrhosis that have recurrent ascites, <b>shunts</b> may be used. Typical <b>shunts</b> used are portacaval <b>shunt,</b> peritoneovenous <b>shunt,</b> and the transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic <b>shunt</b> (TIPS). However, none of these <b>shunts</b> {{has been shown to}} extend life expectancy, and are considered to be bridges to liver transplantation.|$|R
50|$|The {{revision}} of a <b>shunt</b> means to replace or make adjustments to {{all or part}} of the <b>shunt,</b> this also means that the location of the <b>shunt</b> may be changed therefore changing the category or type of <b>shunt</b> a patient has. For some patients with <b>shunts,</b> a revision or multiple revisions to the <b>shunt</b> may be required. This can be something minor, such as adjusting the setting on a valve to change the flow level through the valve to replacing a substantial length of the <b>shunt,</b> or even replacing the entire <b>shunt</b> or relocating the <b>shunt</b> route to a different part of the body. For example, it may be required for a patient with a lumbar-peritoneal <b>shunt,</b> if multiple revisions are required or overdrainage is occurring, to have it replaced with a ventriculo-peritoneal <b>shunt</b> (VP <b>shunt).</b>|$|R
40|$|From 1971 to 1975, 55 {{patients}} with variceal bleeding secondary to cirrhosis {{were entered into}} a prospective randomized trial comparing distal splenorenal (selective) and H-graft interposition (nonselective) <b>shunt.</b> This 10 -year follow-up documents that selective <b>shunt</b> is better (p less than 0. 05) {{in four of the}} five variables monitored. Control of bleeding: selective <b>shunt</b> prevented variceal bleeding better than interposition <b>shunt</b> due to the higher (0. 05 less than p less than 0. 1) occlusion rate (30 %) of interposition <b>shunt.</b> Selective <b>shunt</b> maintained postoperative portal perfusion better (p less than 0. 01) than patent interposition <b>shunt.</b> Seventy-five per cent of selective <b>shunt</b> survivors have portal perfusion at 10 years: no patient with a patent nonselective <b>shunt</b> perfuses the liver. Quantitative liver function was better preserved (p less than 0. 01) 10 years after selective <b>shunt</b> than nonselective <b>shunt.</b> Postoperative encephalopathy occurred in fewer (p less than 0. 01) selective (27 %) than nonselective (75 %) <b>shunt</b> patients over the 10 years. Survival: in the randomized population, the improved survival in the selective <b>shunt</b> subgroup did not reach statistical significance. However, improved survival was confirmed in nonalcoholics. Five of eight nonalcoholics operated with selective <b>shunt</b> are alive at 10 years with patent <b>shunts.</b> No nonalcoholic, of seven total, operated with nonselective <b>shunt</b> survived 10 years with a patent <b>shunt.</b> These data show that selective <b>shunt</b> was superior to nonselective <b>shunt.</b> There was less rebleeding and encephalopathy after distal splenorenal shunt; postoperative portal perfusion and hepatic function were maintained...|$|R
5|$|In {{cases of}} {{paracetamol}} overdose, the sulfate and glucuronide pathways become saturated, and more paracetamol is <b>shunted</b> to the cytochrome P450 system to produce NAPQI. As a result, hepatocellular supplies of glutathione become depleted, as {{the demand for}} glutathione is higher than its regeneration. NAPQI therefore remains in its toxic form in the liver and reacts with cellular membrane molecules, resulting in widespread hepatocyte damage and death, leading to acute liver necrosis. In animal studies, the liver's stores of glutathione must be depleted to less than 70% of normal levels before liver toxicity occurs.|$|E

5|$|The main {{transport}} {{route to the}} power station for fuel (originally coal) is train via a -long freight-only section of the former Hull and Barnsley Railway, from the Pontefract Line at Hensall Junction. A balloon loop rail layout is used so that wagons of coal {{do not need to}} be <b>shunted</b> after being unloaded. Merry-go-round trains are used, so that wagons can be unloaded without the train stopping as it passes through an unloading house. On average, there are 35 deliveries a day, 6 days a week.|$|E

5000|$|A <b>shunting</b> sign (入換標識, irekae hyōshiki or—more briefly—入標, irehyō) {{is not a}} signal; therefore, its {{diagonal}} indicator is not [...] "go" [...] but [...] "open" [...] (開通, kaitsū). A <b>shunting</b> sign {{does not}} have a protected section. A <b>shunting</b> signal is absolute, but a <b>shunting</b> sign is a permissive.

5|$|The July 1924 {{timetable}} showed eight {{passenger trains}} each way between Amlwch and Gaerwen, with the Red Wharf Bay railmotor operating to Llangefni {{three times a}} day. The extra Thursday service to Llangefni for the market was still included. By the summer of 1929, there were eight trains from Gaerwen to Amlwch, and seven in the other direction. One train to and from Amlwch no longer ran Thursdays, replaced with a second two return trip to Llangefni, operated by the railmotor. The loop at Llangwyllog now saw three pairs of passenger trains passing on weekdays, while the daily freight train would be <b>shunted</b> into sidings at Llangefni and Llanerchymedd to make way. Motor train services were back up to 24 single trips a day, including the Red Wharf Bay services.|$|E
50|$|Treatment of a CSF <b>shunt</b> {{infection}} generally includes {{removal of}} the <b>shunt</b> and placement of a temporary ventricular reservoir until the infection is resolved.

The last method is best with over 95% success rate.|$|R
40|$|OBJECT: As many as 40 % of <b>shunts</b> fail in {{the first}} year, mainly due to {{proximal}} obstruction. The role of catheter position on failure rates has not been clearly demonstrated. The authors conducted a prospective cohort study of navigated <b>shunt</b> placement compared with standard blind <b>shunt</b> placement at 3 European centers to assess the effect on <b>shunt</b> failure rates. METHODS: All adult and pediatric patients undergoing de novo ventriculoperitoneal <b>shunt</b> placement were included (patients with slit ventricles were excluded). The first cohort underwent standard <b>shunt</b> placement using anatomical landmarks. All centers subsequently adopted electromagnetic (EM) navigation for routine <b>shunt</b> placements, forming the second cohort. Catheter position was graded on postoperative CT in both groups using a 3 -point scale developed for this study: (1) optimal position free-floating in CSF; (2) touching choroid or ventricular wall; or (3) intraparenchymal. Episodes and type of <b>shunt</b> revision were recorded. Early <b>shunt</b> failure was defined as that occurring within 30 days of surgery. Patients with <b>shunts</b> were followed-up for 12 months in the standard group, for a median of 6 months in the EM-navigated group, or until <b>shunt</b> failure. RESULTS: A total of 75 patients {{were included in the}} study, 41 with standard <b>shunts</b> and 34 with EM-navigated <b>shunts.</b> Seventy-four percent of navigated <b>shunts</b> were Grade 1 compared with 37 % of the standard <b>shunts</b> (p= 0. 001, chi-square test). There were no Grade 3 placements in the navigated group, but 8 in the standard group, and 75 % of these failed. Early <b>shunt</b> failure occurred in 9 patients in the standard group and in 2 in the navigated group, reducing the early revision rate from 22 to 5. 9 % (p= 0. 048, Fisher exact test). Early <b>shunt</b> failures were due to proximal obstruction in 78 % of standard <b>shunts</b> (7 of 9) and in 50 % of EM-navigated <b>shunts</b> (1 of 2). CONCLUSIONS: Noninvasive EM image guidance in <b>shunt</b> surgery reduces poor <b>shunt</b> placement, resulting in a significant decrease in the early <b>shunt</b> revision rate...|$|R
