25|$|There {{are many}} unique marine {{crustaceans}} in Australian waters. The best-known class, {{to which all}} the edible species of crustacean belong, is Malacostraca. The warm waters of northern Australia are home to many species of decapod crustaceans, including crabs, false crabs, hermit crabs, lobsters, <b>shrimps,</b> <b>and</b> <b>prawns.</b> The peracarids, including the amphipods and isopods, are more diverse in the colder waters of southern Australia. Less-well-known marine groups include the classes Remipedia, Cephalocarida, Branchiopoda, Maxillopoda (which includes the barnacles, copepods and fish lice), and the Ostracoda. Notable species include the Tasmanian giant crab, the second largest crab species in the world, found in deep water, and weighing up to 13kg, and the Australian spiny lobsters, such as the western rock lobster, which are distinct from other lobster species as {{they do not have}} claws.|$|E
