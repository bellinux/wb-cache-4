6000|$|... 'Lots {{of people}} are coming to <b>stay</b> <b>with</b> <b>us</b> <b>for</b> Christmas,' added Marilda, and you must all of you come and have all the fun with us.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{will recover}} fast now," [...] the countess said; [...] "but he has {{worried about you}} night and day, Ronald. I {{hope that you will}} <b>stay</b> <b>with</b> <b>us</b> <b>for</b> a time. We have seen so little of you yet." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This," [...] she said, [...] "is Mr. Burton, {{a friend}} of father's, who is <b>staying</b> <b>with</b> <b>us</b> <b>for</b> a few days. He is writing a book. Perhaps, if you are very polite to him, he will let you publish it. Mr. Bomford--Mr. Burton." ...|$|R
6000|$|One girl, a dear, {{wholesome}} creature named Janet, <b>stayed</b> <b>with</b> <b>us</b> <b>for</b> {{months and}} might have stayed years, but for her addiction to strong language. The only and well-beloved child of {{the captain of the}} barge [...] "Nancy Jane," [...] trading between Purfleet and Ponder's End, her conversation was at once my terror and delight.|$|R
6000|$|... "Uh, Mr., uh--Daggett, was it?--I {{wonder if}} you won't stay {{a little closer to}} us hereafter? I was getting rather a good change out of the trip, but I'm afraid that now---- If it wouldn't be an insult, I'd beg you to {{consider}} <b>staying</b> <b>with</b> <b>us</b> <b>for</b> a consideration, uh, you know, remuneration, and you could----" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{are safe}} now," [...] she whispered. [...] "We care that {{much for a}} United States warrant," [...] and she snapped her slim fingers. [...] "You shall <b>stay</b> <b>with</b> <b>us</b> <b>for</b> a time. We {{will take care of}} you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We didn't {{expect to}} take anybody," [...] said the doctor's son slowly. [...] "But you might <b>stay</b> <b>with</b> <b>us</b> <b>for</b> {{a day or}} two, anyway---and we can talk it over. We ought to be better acquainted before we make a bargain." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mrs. Wilcox, this is Miss Curtis, {{who will}} <b>stay</b> <b>with</b> <b>us</b> <b>for</b> a few days." [...] As they greeted each other he added: [...] "There {{is a story}} to tell, but we are late, and it can wait. Where is Elsie?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Amenda <b>stayed</b> <b>with</b> <b>us</b> <b>for</b> {{nearly five}} years--until the milkman, having saved up {{sufficient}} {{to buy a}} [...] "walk" [...] of his own, had become practicable--but her attitude towards us never changed. Even {{when we came to}} be really important married people, the proprietors of a [...] "family," [...] it was evident that she merely considered we had gone a step further in the game, and were playing now at being fathers and mothers.|$|R
50|$|Kinneging {{earned his}} PhD {{with the highest}} honors on October 1, 1994 with an English {{dissertation}} entitled Aristocracy, Antiquity and History - Classicism in Political Thought, later published by Transaction Publishers. The book criticizes the standard literature on Modernity, {{by pointing out that}} remnants of classical wisdom - e.g. the ethics of honor - <b>stayed</b> <b>with</b> <b>us</b> <b>for</b> much longer than commonly thought. The book emphasizes Romans over Greeks. Following the trail of Herbert Butterfield (The Whig Interpretation of History), Kinneging rejects the teleological study of the past.|$|R
6000|$|... "Dear Clifford," [...] said Hepzibah, in {{the tone}} with which one soothes a wayward infant, [...] "this is our cousin Phoebe,--little Phoebe Pyncheon,--Arthur's only child, you know. She {{has come from the}} country to <b>stay</b> <b>with</b> <b>us</b> awhile; <b>for</b> our old house has grown to be very lonely now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I--I wasn't calling {{anywhere}} this afternoon," [...] Lois said timidly. [...] "Captain Vandermere {{has come}} down to <b>stay</b> <b>with</b> <b>us</b> <b>for</b> a few days, and I was showing him the country. This is Mr. Saton--Captain Vandermere. I don't know whether you remember him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Most welcome, sire!" [...] he cried. [...] "Indeed it is {{good for}} us that so gallant a knight should <b>stay</b> <b>with</b> <b>us</b> <b>for</b> some short time, since the chance of war has so ordered it. Wine there! Bring wine for the King!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My daughter, Mrs. Craig," [...] said Reynolds gently. [...] "Daughter, {{this young}} man is Mr. Mose Harding, who comes from my old friend Delmar. He is going to <b>stay</b> <b>with</b> <b>us</b> <b>for</b> a time. Sit down, Mose, and make {{yourself}} at home." ...|$|E
60|$|Sophy <b>stayed</b> <b>with</b> <b>us</b> <b>for</b> a week, {{and then}} took rooms near us. She was still pale and weak, and did not gain {{strength}} as she should have done. She never spoke of the past, except upon one occasion before we came up to town, when she related to me the whole circumstances of her finding the will; except on that occasion she never mentioned the past, and the slightest allusion to it excited a nervous horror in her, and greatly retarded her recovery. The medical men said that her brain had not recovered from the terrible strain upon it, and that a perfect change was necessary, and a total absence of anything which might, by recalling the past, tend to excite her.|$|R
60|$|I shall pass {{very briefly}} over the {{remaining}} ten days that Percy and Ada <b>stayed</b> <b>with</b> <b>us,</b> <b>for</b> indeed that happy time {{is more than}} even now I can write about calmly. Papa's and mamma's consent was warmly given, {{and they were very}} much pleased with Percy. The only drawback to papa's satisfaction at the match, was the fact of Percy being in the army, and the thought of my going abroad. Percy, indeed, offered to leave the service, but this I would not hear of. I knew how much he was attached to his profession, and I had no objection to the thought of going abroad; and my money, with his pay and allowance from his mother, would enable us to live in luxury in any part of the world.|$|R
5000|$|Many {{people also}} {{wondered}} whether Kerala food would be palatable to foreign taste buds. The result, though, {{has been extremely}} satisfactory. [...] "Other than making the food less spicy, we do not deviate from traditional cuisine," [...] says Lilly Lawrence, who supervises cooking in the Retreat. [...] "There is a huge demand for fish and seafood, such as prawn and shrimp. Everything is available locally," [...] she says. Lawrence recalls, [...] "Initially, we were worried about whether guests would like the village and its rustic ambience. But we realized {{that this is a}} novel experience for them. We have had tourists who <b>stayed</b> <b>with</b> <b>us</b> <b>for</b> weeks, reading books, fishing or simply watching the backwaters." [...] Tourists also find that there is no huge communication gap, because at least one member in a family, if not all, can converse in English.|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{has lost}} what I {{am sure you}} will never lose, her own self-esteem. But, Hermy, you should be good to her. We must all be good to her. Will it not be better that you should <b>stay</b> <b>with</b> <b>us</b> <b>for</b> a while--both of you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, isn't that strange?" [...] Mrs. Van Reinberg exclaimed. [...] "The Plaskett Whites are our nearest neighbors. If {{you really}} are coming that way, you must <b>stay</b> <b>with</b> <b>us</b> <b>for</b> a week, or {{as long as you}} can manage it. We are going {{straight}} to Lenox." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You will <b>stay</b> <b>with</b> <b>us</b> <b>for</b> {{a day or}} two at the Wells," [...] Madame Bernstein continued. [...] "You {{will see}} us put into our lodgings. Then you can return to Castlewood and the partridge-shooting, and all the fine things which you and my lord are to study together." ...|$|E
6000|$|The tree yet sparkles, I say. I {{am writing}} {{on the day before}} Twelfth Day, if you must know; but already ever so many of the fruits have been pulled, and the Christmas lights have gone out. Bobby Miseltow, who has been <b>staying</b> <b>with</b> <b>us</b> <b>for</b> a week (and who has been {{sleeping}} mysteriously in the bath-room), comes to say he is going away {{to spend the rest of}} the holidays with his grandmother -- and I brush away the manly tear of regret as I part with the dear child. [...] "Well, Bob, good-bye, since you will go. Compliments to grandmamma. Thank her for the turkey. Here's ----" [...] (A slight pecuniary transaction takes place at this juncture, and Bob nods and winks, and puts his hand in his waistcoat pocket.) [...] "You have had a pleasant week?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{can imagine}} from what I {{say that my}} poor sister Julia and I had no great {{pleasure}} in our lives. No servant would <b>stay</b> <b>with</b> <b>us,</b> and <b>for</b> a long time we did all {{the work of the}} house. She was but thirty {{at the time of her}} death, and yet her hair had already begun to whiten, even as mine has." ...|$|R
5000|$|On December 11, 2004, King {{participated in}} a march against {{same-sex}} marriage in Atlanta. This action was {{in contrast to the}} advocacy of her mother, Coretta Scott King and her older sister Yolanda Denise King, both longtime, outspoken supporters of gay rights. She was joined by senior pastor at New Birth Missionary Baptist Church Eddie Long, who said in a written statement that the march was not [...] "to protest same-sex marriage, but to present a unified version of righteousness and justice." [...] At the time of the march, King said she had become a [...] "spiritual daughter" [...] of Eddie Long and the issue of same-sex marriage legalization had left many divided. [...] "The question is, how do you overcome that pain?" [...] she said. [...] "It may be the wedge that <b>stays</b> <b>with</b> <b>us</b> <b>for</b> a long time. We have to get to a place where it does not become the most defining issue of our time." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, now you {{are about}} to begin work. I've got {{everything}} all arranged. You are to <b>stay</b> <b>with</b> <b>us</b> <b>for</b> the present at least. My niece is with us and you will get along famously I know. How do you like my horse?" [...] he asked, in his effort to get her to speak.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Not Lady Le Breton's son!' cried Mrs. Greatrex, forgetting her {{dignity in}} her surprise. 'Well, that {{certainly}} is very lucky. Now, if we could only get her {{to come down and}} <b>stay</b> <b>with</b> <b>us</b> <b>for</b> a week sometimes, after he's been here a little while, what a splendid advertisement it would be for the place, to be sure, Joseph!' ...|$|E
60|$|Captain C---- only {{raised his}} eyebrows at him, and got up from his chair. We {{dispersed}} to our duties, but Almayer, half dressed {{as he was in}} his cretonne pajamas and the thin cotton singlet, remained on board, lingering near the gangway, as though he could not make up his mind whether to go home or <b>stay</b> <b>with</b> <b>us</b> <b>for</b> good.|$|E
6000|$|It was {{no small}} plunge from the calm of St. Barnabas. 'We agree,' said Lady Martin, {{in a note}} within his envelope, 'that we cannot attempt to write letters just now. We are in a whirl, mental and bodily; one bit of blue sky has just shown itself, viz. that Coley may {{possibly}} <b>stay</b> on <b>with</b> <b>us</b> <b>for</b> {{a week or two}} after the Selwyns have left us. This really is proeter spem, and I mean to think that it will come to pass.' ...|$|R
5000|$|... "We {{just fell}} in love with it," [...] Madonna explains. [...] "In the summertime it's the most {{beautiful}} place in the world." [...] The memory of their day at Ashcombe [...] "just <b>stayed</b> <b>with</b> <b>us,</b> haunted <b>us</b> <b>for</b> a really long time," [...] she remembers. Eventually they could resist its lure no longer, and Ashcombe was theirs.|$|R
40|$|Several {{people have}} been {{instrumental}} for the construction, development and conclusion of this project. I {{would like to thank}} them for their important and gracious support. These people include not only the academics and colleagues, but also friends and family who have assisted me in different ways during this last year. First of all, I would like to thank my supervisor, Prof. Rui Rocha, for his invaluable guidance, with whom, I have discussed this thesis in detail ever since the planning phase of the study. Due to his methods in monitoring, organization and support, I can honestly say that I never felt adrift during the development of the project. I would also like to remark the great motivation he has given to me when things did not go as well as expected. It was a great pleasure to work with him and I hopefully expect that we have the opportunity to work again in the near future. Special thanks to my closest family: My parents, my sister Sara, who moved to Australia recently, and whom is already missed a lot, also my grandmother from Iran, who has been <b>staying</b> <b>with</b> <b>us</b> <b>for</b> the last three months; and also my beautiful girlfriend Vanessa. These are the people, whom by their merely existence, allow me to go on, because of thei...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, yes. There are {{the death}} duties, of course, but half my father's money {{goes with the}} place, and Lawrence will <b>stay</b> <b>with</b> <b>us</b> <b>for</b> the present, so there is his share as well. We shall be pinched at first, of course, because, as I once told you, I am {{in a bit of}} a hole financially myself. Still, the Johnnies will wait now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] said Lady Holmhurst; [...] "I am sorry, {{for some}} things. Mr. Tombey {{is such a}} very nice young man, and so very gentlemanlike. I thought that perhaps it might suit your views, {{and it would have}} {{simplified}} your future arrangements. But as to that, of course, while you are in New Zealand, I shall be able to see to that. By-the-way, it is understood that you come to <b>stay</b> <b>with</b> <b>us</b> <b>for</b> a few months at Government House, before you hunt up your cousin." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You, sir, as {{my brother}} {{has learned from}} your brave {{follower}} here, are an English gentleman. To you I owe far heavier obligation than to these soldiers, {{for you and your}} man incurred a terrible risk, and well-nigh sacrificed your lives for ours. I pray you come with us, and <b>stay</b> <b>with</b> <b>us</b> <b>for</b> a time. I shall then hear your plans, and your object in visiting this country, and if I can in any way further them, you may be sure I will do so to the utmost; for the present, I can promise you at least excellent hunting, and the heartiest welcome." ...|$|E
60|$|Caddy {{was not at}} all {{deficient}} in natural affection for her mother, but mentioned this with tears as an undeniable fact, which I am afraid it was. We were sorry for the poor dear girl and found so much to admire in the good disposition which had survived under such discouragement that we both at once (I mean Ada and I) proposed a little scheme that made her perfectly joyful. This was her <b>staying</b> <b>with</b> <b>us</b> <b>for</b> three weeks, my <b>staying</b> <b>with</b> her for one, and our all three contriving and cutting out, and repairing, and sewing, and saving, and doing the very best we could think of {{to make the most of}} her stock. My guardian being as pleased with the idea as Caddy was, we took her home next day to arrange the matter and brought her out again in triumph with her boxes and all the purchases that could be squeezed out of a ten-pound note, which Mr. Jellyby had found in the docks I suppose, but which he at all events gave her. What my guardian would not have given her if we had encouraged him, it would be difficult to say, but we thought it right to compound for no more than her wedding-dress and bonnet. He agreed to this compromise, and if Caddy had ever been happy in her life, she was happy when we sat down to work.|$|R
5000|$|Chapter six {{is about}} Brazil. Shange {{talks about the}} {{different}} colors of the populations of different sections of Brazil, saying that the south is industrialized and [...] "mythologically white", while it's thought that the [...] "Africans" [...] live in the north. She talks about how {{when she was at}} a university in Bahia she asked each student to bring in the beginning of a performance piece or something based either off their lives or the world as they knew it. Each student talked about a myth, which she found disturbing and says that [...] "My students were validating themselves as the 'other' where they were not the other." [...] Shange says that [...] "We are not folklore." [...] In terms of Brazil, she says that [...] "the epitome and apex of Brazilian life may be the continually multiplying mulatta, but we must all eat whatever our hue, or the hue and cry over who we are." [...] She then goes about looking at what makes up the primary dishes, focusing on Brazilian rice. Shange makes the point that Brazil has the highest percentage of people of African descent who live outside continent and that [...] "We eat what they eat, just differently. These recipes have <b>stayed</b> <b>with</b> <b>us</b> <b>for</b> centuries, being improvised here and there, where we found somethin' we were accustomed to in, say, Guinea was not available {{at the mouth of the}} Amazon." ...|$|R
