40|$|Presentation slides {{from the}} 2012 Charleston Conference. <b>Audio</b> and video <b>content</b> {{have had a}} history of {{isolation}} from mainstream discovery and delivery in large part due to the complexities of the lending systems that have developed around them. These systems have dictated a concentration on the carrier over the content and resulted in multiple barriers to use. Streaming media offer a chance to remove these barriers by eliminating the systems involved and allowing the content to shine through the carrier. Given the advent of YouTube and everything it entails, users are clearly ready for this shift, but are multimedia content providers, library service providers, and librarians? Over the past several years, there has been an increasing demand for <b>audio</b> and video <b>streaming</b> collections in libraries. The overhead required for an academic institution to provide <b>streaming</b> <b>audio</b> and video services to users has been prohibitive, and collection budgets in general have shifted heavily toward electronic resources. As a result, eyes have turned to online, virtual solutions, but have minds turned, too? Books and journals seem to continue to rule many {{of the ways in which}} the library world considers and treats its content, from catalog records and online delivery to standards development and coverage in library systems. Are streaming videos included in A-Z title lists? Do link resolvers deliver <b>streaming</b> <b>audio</b> <b>content?</b> Do discovery systems cover the elements users need to find <b>streaming</b> video and <b>audio?</b> Does fulltext have meaning in video or audio?

40|$|MHealth: A Real-Time Graphical Multicast Monitoring Tool by David B. Makofske The {{exponential}} {{growth of the}} Internet combined with the increasing popularity of <b>streaming</b> <b>audio</b> and video <b>content</b> are pushing Internet bandwidth constraints to their limits. Methods of managing and more efficiently utilizing the existing bandwidth are becoming increasingly vital. Multicasting Internet <b>content,</b> especially <b>streaming</b> <b>audio</b> and video, can provide enormous bandwidth savings. A decade of efforts at deploying multicast combined with the rising need for better traffic management for bandwidth-hungry audio and video applications has led to significant momentum for multicast implementation. One of the remaining barriers to widespread adoption of multicast in the Internet {{is the lack of}} multicast monitoring and debugging tools. To address this need this thesis introduces MHealth, a graphical, near real-time multicast monitoring tool. MHealth utilizes existing tools to collect comprehensi [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Wireless {{multicast}} is {{an important}} service primitive for emerging applications such as live video, <b>streaming</b> <b>audio</b> and <b>content</b> telecasts. Transmission rate in such a link layer multicast is bottlenecked by {{the rate of the}} weakest client, leading to channel under-utilization. Attempts to increase the data rate results in lower reliability (due to higher bit error rate) and higher unfairness. This poster utilizes smart beamforming antennas to improve multicast performance in wireless LANs. The main idea is to satisfy majority of the (strong) clients with a high-rate omnidirectional transmission, followed by high-rate directional transmission(s) to cover the weaker ones. By selecting an optimal transmission strategy, we show that the multicast throughput can be maximized while achieving a desired delivery ratio at all the clients. We use testbed measurements to verify our main assumptions. We simulate our protocol in Qualnet, and observe consistent performance improvements over a wide range of client topologies and time-varying channel conditions...|$|R

These networks have enabled hugely successful services like the World Wide Web, and they are even attracting traditional services such as telephony.

40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) This {{research}} {{presents a}} case study of the Super Radio Network, the largest regional radio network in New South Wales (NSW), Australia. Since the 1920 s when radio, as a broadcast medium, was introduced to Australia the industry was highly regulated. This regulation extended to licensing, ownership limits, foreign investment and content. However, in 1992 the Keating Labor government further deregulated the radio industry through the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 giving licensees more freedom by removing ownership limits. Deregulation was meant to create a more diverse and localised radio industry. However, from 1992 onward, there has been {{an increase in the number}} of radio stations networking their programmes to regional Australia resulting in a perceived loss of local content and locally hosted programmes. This research examines the development of networking and the provision of local content and diversity in those networked environments. It examines, through interviews with radio practitioners, in particular programme-makers and managers within the Super Radio Network, how the role of radio practitioners as choice making agents work within the structures of legislation and radio formats to develop programme content for a local audience within a radio station’s licence area. Underlying this research is the focal theory of structuration developed by Anthony Giddens. The features of social systems and social production can be explained, according to Giddens, through the theory of structuration, specifically the notion of the duality of structure, which proposes that social systems, such as radio networks, exist through structural properties that consist of rules and resources that are both allocative (available material such as technology) and authoritative (non-material or human) and expressing the ‘mutual dependence’ of structure and agency. Interviews with radio practitioners show how these agents work within the structures in which the radio industry operates and the analysis shows how programme content is compiled and whether it relates to the local licence area. This analysis considers whether regulating local content and having locally hosted programmes adds to the localness of regional radio. Finally, as the thesis will demonstrate there is some confusion over the term ‘local’ and this confusion occurs not only in its use by programme-makers but also in its lack of definitional precision in broadcasting legislation and government policy statements. This results in problems for both the network operators and the communities they service. This research directly interrogates the question of what constitutes the local and localism by putting forward a definition of these terms to reflect the nature of regional radio as it competes with a burgeoning and fluid set of industry structures that <b>streams</b> <b>audio</b> <b>content</b> over the Internet...|$|R
40|$|International audienceTo {{those of}} a certain age the concept of the mix-tape holds fond memories, and {{generally}} not of the musical content they contained, but rather the emotional and physical connection they represented with either its creator or recipient.
