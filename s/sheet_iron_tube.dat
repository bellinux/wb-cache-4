50|$|The Youngstown <b>Iron</b> <b>Sheet</b> and <b>Tube</b> Company, {{based in}} Youngstown, Ohio, was an American steel manufacturer. Officially, {{the company was}} created on November 23, 1900, when Articles of Incorporation of the Youngstown <b>Iron</b> <b>Sheet</b> and <b>Tube</b> Company were filed with the Ohio Secretary of State at Columbus. It {{acquired}} the Mark Manufacturing Company in 1923. Youngstown Sheet and Tube remained in business until 1977. It reopened in 2014 as a small business promoting economic redevelopment of Youngstown.|$|R

5000|$|A system {{developed}} in Germany called [...] "Kuhlo wire" [...] used one, two, or three rubber-insulated wires in a brass or lead-coated <b>iron</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>tube,</b> with a crimped seam. The enclosure {{could also be}} used as a return conductor. Kuhlo wire could be run exposed on surfaces and painted, or embedded in plaster. Special outlet and junction boxes were made for lamps and switches, made either of porcelain or sheet steel. The crimped seam was not considered as watertight as the Stannos wire used in England, which had a soldered sheath.|$|R
5000|$|During the {{previous}} year, however, Wick and Campbell combined resources with other local investors {{who wanted to}} maintain significant levels of local ownership within the city's manufacturing sector. The group established the Youngstown <b>Iron</b> <b>Sheet</b> and <b>Tube</b> Company with $600,000 in capital. Wick, who emerged as the steel company's first president in 1900, appointed Campbell as secretary. [...] The word 'Iron' was dropped from the company's name in 1905. Although the company's focus began with sheet and tube, it eventually {{became one of the}} nation's most important steel producers with a varied product line.|$|R

5000|$|Employer hostility was not {{the only}} obstacle: The fact that some {{branches}} of the trade were falling while others were rising also complicated the early union’s plans. In the late 19th century assortment work - tinware that included household goods, cutlery, and cans, for instance - moved from shop to factory, and machine operators replaced apprentice-trained journeymen on the job. At the same time, though, the increasing use of galvanized <b>sheet</b> <b>iron</b> was creating opportunities for journeymen employed in furnace or architectural shops - demand for metal roofs, cornices, skylights, and ceilings, along with warm air furnaces and ventilation pipe, was on the rise by the late 19th century. In their case, labor-saving machinery, including <b>sheet</b> <b>iron</b> folders, or brakes, and cutting, rolling, and seaming machines, did not replace skill. But it did give rise to a new class of workmen that the Tin, <b>Sheet</b> <b>Iron</b> and Cornice Workers could not ignore: Semi-skilled specialists who produced materials for the trade. Although many local unions feared that admitting lower-waged members would undercut journeymen’s wages, a referendum vote in 1896 moved the organization forward. “The constitution of the tinners has been changed so as to admit all who work at sheet metal work into their unions,” the IA reported.” Henceforth, the Tin, <b>Sheet</b> <b>Iron,</b> and Cornice Workers’ International Association will be known as the Amalgamated Sheet Metal Workers’ International Association.” ...|$|R
