500|$|Humber debuted {{with the}} White Sox in their third game in relief. He made two pitches, {{both of which}} {{resulted}} in hits and base runners that came around to score. With Jake Peavy injured {{at the start of}} the 2011 season, the White Sox gave Humber the opportunity to pitch in their starting rotation. On April 9, 2011, Humber won his first start with the White Sox, pitching [...] innings and only allowing one run. Humber surprised the White Sox with his strong performance. On April 25, in the sixth start of his career, he took a no-hitter into the seventh inning against the New York Yankees at Yankee Stadium, but with one out Alex Rodriguez singled up the middle. He finished with seven scoreless innings. He took a no-hitter into the sixth inning against the Washington Nationals on June 26, but ended up earning a 2–1 loss when he surrendered a seventh inning home run to Danny Espinosa. In early July, when he led the major leagues with [...] innings pitched and held an 8–4 record with a 2.69 ERA, he seemed like a probable selection for the 2011 Major League Baseball All-Star Game. In mid-July, the White Sox switched to a six-man rotation. By early August, Humber was in a slump. Humber denies the extra rest affected his pitch command. He spent time on the disabled list with a facial bruise after Kosuke Fukudome lined a baseball into his face above the right eye on August 18. After he was hit, he was very concerned for his wife: [...] "I thought, 'I've got to get up because she's in the stands,'" [...] Humber said. [...] "As soon as I went in , I asked one of the guys to call her to make sure <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> OK.", adding [...] "My main concern was cheering up my wife." [...] He appeared in one rehabilitation start for the Charlotte Knights of the Class-AAA International League. Humber pitched seven scoreless innings in his major league return. Humber completed his first full season as an MLB starting pitcher with a 9–9 win–loss record with a 3.75 ERA in 163 innings.|$|E
2500|$|Bond's {{reporting}} style {{suggested that}} she was very close personally to members of the Royal Family. She commented that she had become close to Diana and that her death came as a great shock. She actually instigated her first meeting with Diana. She sent a note, suggesting that if she was to report on Diana properly then she should at least know what her character was actually like, not basing her thoughts on stories that had appeared in newspapers. She commented on that meeting at Kensington Palace, stating: [...] "Princess Diana was charming, articulate, fresh, interesting, but manipulative. <b>She</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a journalist. This was no girlie-girlie meeting." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, sir," [...] said he, on {{recovering}} his composure; [...] "arter I saw Blazes-- Frank, I mean, that's my brother, sir--I {{goes right}} away home to bed. I stops with my mother, sir, an' {{she saw me}} come off here this mornin', sir. <b>She</b> <b>knows</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> comin' here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think you}} had better go and see my mother presently. Of course she won't be {{worrying}} about me, for <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> {{able to take care}} of myself; but at the same time it will give her some satisfaction to <b>know</b> what <b>I</b> <b>am</b> doing. You could find my mother?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, Charley, when <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> ill, <b>she</b> {{will try}} to make her way into the room. Keep her out, Charley, if you love me truly, to the last! Charley, if you let her in but once, only to look upon me for one moment as I lie here, I shall die." ...|$|R
60|$|Brightened up when <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> near! That was glorious! That brightened up creation.|$|E
60|$|Again {{our eyes}} met, and I fancied {{that this time}} she was looking a little frightened. At any rate <b>she</b> <b>knew.</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> sure of that.|$|E
6000|$|... "And <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{coming over}} to Hope {{just as soon as}} the roads made it safe and {{pleasant}} for automobiling," [...] he murmured to himself.|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{she was not}} dead: she {{was alive}} and working as bravely as you. Ah, how little I thought, when I loved Rachel, and she loved me, that we should ever meet so happily as we soon shall. Tell me how you found her? Does <b>she</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> the woman <b>she</b> once saved? Tell me all about her; and tell it fast," [...] prayed Christie, getting excited, as she more fully grasped the happy fact that Rachel and Letty were one.|$|R
6000|$|... "What the dickens does Mademoiselle Idiale {{want with}} me?" [...] Laverick demanded. [...] "Does <b>she</b> <b>know</b> that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> a poor stockbroker, {{struggling}} against hard times?" ...|$|R
60|$|When I {{put on my}} bonnet, however, <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{going to}} Thrums, and she rose {{and walked to the}} door, looking behind to see that I followed.|$|R
6000|$|... "She was not {{to leave}} this place until <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> safe within our lines. I have some friends who are {{faithful}} to me." [...] After a pause she added, [...] "She has been here already." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You couldn’t do it, Bill," [...] {{said the}} skipper decidedly. [...] "Not while <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> above ground." [...] "Well, I can try," [...] {{returned}} the mate shortly. [...] "I’ve took rather a fancy to the girl. Is it a bargain?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, she doesn't," [...] {{spoke up}} the Story Girl undauntedly. [...] "She was all dressed {{and ready to}} come before <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> going to dress the same way. So she kept her bargain faithfully, Mr. Campbell, and I think you were cruel to make her do it." ...|$|E
60|$|This regret of Sally's, this faltering {{distress}} at {{giving me}} pain, was such sweet assurance {{that she did}} love me, better than <b>she</b> <b>knew,</b> that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> divided between extremes of emotion.|$|R
6000|$|... 'No. We {{understand}} each other, {{and it is}} better for all parties that <b>she</b> should <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> not to be interfered with. Positively I think she has been fonder of me since we measured our strength.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This accursed {{woman at}} the Grange <b>is</b> in it, <b>I</b> know," [...] Ray remarked, slowly filling his pipe. [...] "I wonder if <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> about? That would give her a zest for the job." ...|$|R
6000|$|The doctor {{presently}} {{enters to}} write a prescription, followed by Clive's mother-in-law, who had cast Rosa's fine Cashmere shawl over her shoulders, to hide her disarray. [...] "You here still, Mr. Pendennis!" [...] she exclaims. <b>She</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> there. Had not she changed her dress {{in order to receive}} me? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There was a French {{lady said}} {{to me at the}} table-d'hote this evening that <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> an American, because the Americans always strike the key of personality." [...] He practised these economies of {{material}} in conversation quite recklessly, and often made the same incident or suggestion do duty round a whole company.|$|E
60|$|At her chair, as usual, was Rosa Dartle. From {{the first}} moment of her dark eyes resting on me, I saw <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> the bearer of evil tidings. The scar sprung into view that instant. She withdrew herself a step behind the chair, to keep her own face out of Mrs. Steerforth's observation; and {{scrutinized}} me with a piercing gaze that never faltered, never shrunk.|$|E
60|$|There {{was not a}} quiver of {{expression}} in her cold acknowledgment of my declaration. Nevertheless, at that moment I received an inspiration. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> perfectly sure that <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> who <b>I</b> <b>was</b> and what <b>I</b> had come for.|$|R
5000|$|Yoshikawa never {{received}} official {{recognition of his}} services during the war. In 1955, he opened a candy business but it failed as word spread of {{his role in the}} war. The locals blamed Yoshikawa for the war. [...] "They even blamed me for the atomic bomb," [...] he declared in one interview. Penniless and jobless, he was supported by his wife {{for the rest of his}} life via her position selling insurance. [...] "My wife alone shows me great respect," [...] said the old spy. [...] "Every day she bows to me. <b>She</b> <b>knows</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> a man of history." [...] He died in a nursing home.|$|R
60|$|Every {{morning he}} has reappeared {{on the same}} spot. He {{seems to be a}} solitary individual, given to prowling by himself. I wonder what Aunt would say if <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> what <b>I</b> <b>am</b> so earnestly {{watching}} through my glass at times.|$|R
6000|$|... "I did though. It {{was the day}} I saw you at Lincoln," [...] he continued. [...] "I {{had meant}} {{to ask her to}} marry me, and then I looked out of the window and saw you. After that I didn't want to ask any one to marry me. But I did it; and <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> lying, and refused me. I thought then, and still think, that she cares for me. I behaved very badly. I don't defend myself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, she had it, old skin-flint, though I didn't know or {{care about}} it then. What a jolly row she'd make if <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> tellin' the ladder part of the story! She always does when I get to it, and makes believe cry, with her head in my breast-pocket, or any such handy place, till I take it out and swear I'll never do so ag'in. Poor little Kit, I wonder what she's doin' now. Thinkin' of me, I'll bet." ...|$|E
60|$|We {{discussed}} {{all sorts}} of things, from the Christian and other religions and European policy down, for her thirst for knowledge seemed to be insatiable. But what really interested her was the state of affairs in Zululand, with which <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> well acquainted, {{as a person who}} had played a part in its history and who was received and trusted at the Great House, and as a white man who understood the designs and plans of the Boers and of the Governor of Natal.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes; she was uneasy,' he said; {{and then}} was {{compelled}} by conscience to make a clean breast of it. 'I <b>know</b> <b>she</b> was uneasy, because my father said so. But I did not see her myself. The truth <b>is,</b> <b>she</b> doesn't <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> come.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And then I {{would have}} her all to myself away from her people--all to myself--under my own influence--to fashion--to mould--to adore--to soften--to [...] . Oh! Delight! And then--then go away to some distant place where, far from all <b>she</b> <b>knew,</b> <b>I</b> would <b>be</b> {{all the world to}} her! All the world to her!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{could not}} write, because <b>she</b> doesn't <b>know</b> who <b>I</b> <b>am,</b> and <b>I</b> don't <b>know</b> her. We {{talked for a}} minute or two, that's all." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{suppose it}} was,' replied Oliver, 'because heaven {{is a long}} way off; and they are too happy there, to come down to the bedside of a poor boy. But if <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> ill, she must have pitied me, even there; for she was very ill herself before she died. She can't know {{anything}} about me though,' added Oliver after a moment's silence. 'If she had seen me hurt, it would have made her sorrowful; and her face has always looked sweet and happy, when I have dreamed of her.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A snug little {{property}} wouldn't a ben bad, I reckon. Well she had it, old skin-flint, though I didn't know or {{care about}} it then. What a jolly row she'd make if <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> tellin' the ladder part of the story! She always does when I get to it, and makes believe cry, with her head in my breast-pocket, or any such handy place, till I take it out and swear I'll never do so ag'in. Poor little Kit, I wonder what she's doin' now. Thinkin' of me, I'll bet." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'So {{much the}} better--and telling her, too, {{that he is}} about to fulfil his long-standing promise to marry his cousin. If you think it worth while, you may say Cytherea was not indisposed to think of me before <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> married. I have at home a note she wrote me the first evening I saw her, which looks rather warm, and which I could show you. Trust me, he will give her up. When he is married to Adelaide Hinton, Cytherea will be induced to marry me--perhaps before; a woman's pride is soon wounded.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I shouldn't {{be afraid}} of her," [...] said Sylvia to herself, as she turned into the Spencer lane. [...] "But I don't expect I'll ever become acquainted with her. If <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> who <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>I</b> suppose she would dislike me. I suppose she never {{suspects}} that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> Leslie Gray's daughter." ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{consequence}} of this remark was another 'Pshaw!' But Mrs. Peck went on--'When you've lived opposite to people {{like that for a}} long time you feel as if you were acquainted. But she didn't take it up to-day; she didn't speak to me. <b>She</b> <b>knows</b> who <b>I</b> <b>am</b> as well as <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> her own mother.' ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{understood}} my way {{of putting}} the argument. <b>She</b> <b>knew</b> that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> veiling my own eagerness under my mother's need, and after a little reflection she said, [...] "I am going out to my father's home in Kansas. You may come for me there on the twenty-third of November. That is--if you still want me at that time." ...|$|R
