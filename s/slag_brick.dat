40|$|Abstract. Steel slag {{waste is}} a {{by-product}} of steel mining industry. Effort to utilize the steel slag in concrete production has been failed due to its high contents of MgO which causes volumetric instability of the hardened concrete. Researchers also have failed to utilize the steel slag in the sub-base of road construction due to its low compaction ratio. Geopolymer concrete is a new sustainable material made of mainly two materials which are alkali liquid and source material. The source material usually has to be pozzolanic. However, the chemical composition of the steel slag {{has shown that the}} steel slag is not considered as a pozzolanic in accordance to the requirement of the ASTM. Therefore, a special modification has been carried on and a geopolymer steel <b>slag</b> <b>brick</b> has been developed. The new developed geopolymer steel <b>slag</b> <b>brick</b> has compressive strength of about 10 MPa which is made the brick suitable for construction of a load bearing walls...|$|E

40|$|Beachrocks are coastal {{sedimentary}} formations {{resulting from}} a relative rapid cementation of beach sediments by the precipitation of carbonate cements. These lithified structures are not usually observed at temperate settings. The present work {{is focused on the}} occurrence of a significant intertidal cementation in sand-gravel beaches formed among 43 °N latitude coastline, close to the Nerbioi-Ibaizabal estuary (Bilbao, Bay of Biscay, North of Spain). Raman micro-spectroscopy combined with SEM-EDX analyses and petrographic descriptions have been applied for the determination of the cement generations and the cemented materials compositions of the beachrock outcrops. In general terms, the cements described were: Cement Generation 1 (CG 1, aragonite, high-magnesium calcite and silicate mixtures), Cement Generation 2 (CG 2, aragonite) and Cement Generation 3 (CG 3, mixtures of CaCO 3 polymorphs and iron oxides). The rest of the interstitial porosity of the rocks appeared either empty or filled with heterogeneous cemented mixtures of previously reworked compounds. The mineralogy, the regular distribution and the isopachous character of the carbonate cements together with the accurate cementation at advanced seaward bands propose a possible marine-phreatic context for the beachrock formation. However, the impure cements and the materials covering the interstitial porosity seem {{to be the result of}} both, the weathering actions consequences and the surface alterations of specific grains. Moreover, the presence of modern cemented materials (e. g. <b>slag,</b> <b>bricks</b> and pebbles) suggest a recent formation of the phenomenon...|$|R

50|$|The {{damage done}} by the fire was minimal. Approximately half a mile of track had to be replaced, as did all the {{electrical}} services and signalling. The biggest surprise was how well the brick lining had {{stood up to the}} fire. Although some bricks in the tunnel and in the blast relief shafts had become so hot, they vitrified and ran like molten glass, most of the brickwork lining of the tunnel was scorched but still serviceable. One of the photographs taken in the aftermath shows a rail tanker directly beneath shaft 9: it is crowned with a mass of vitrified <b>slag</b> from <b>bricks</b> in the shaft that had melted and dripped down.|$|R
40|$|Chemical {{degradation}} of a refractory lining is most commonly {{considered as a}} dissolution process whereby the refractory components dissolve into the liquid slag. Hence, the lining thickness is steadily reduced. The dissolution process is not merely limited to the slag-refractory contact surface, but due to capillary forces, also occurs inside the porous refractory brick. This paper describes how the interaction between <b>slag</b> and <b>brick</b> during infiltration, changes the slag composition {{as a function of}} infiltration depth. Knowledge about the selective filtering of certain slag components by a refractory brick is indispensible in predicting the chemical degradation, especially when significant changes in slag composition are present. In this case, often seen with non-ferrous slags, the situation in the interior of the brick cannot be adequately predicted based on the global <b>slag</b> and <b>brick</b> composition. To study this “filter effect”, a magnesia-chrome finger in contact with a PbO-SiO 2 -ZnO-Al 2 O 3 -CaO liquid slag at constant temperature is tested. Using SEM-EDS analyses the slag composition as a function of infiltration depth is measured. Based on the microstructure at different positions, the interactions leading to modified slag compositions are determined. They can be classified into two categories: (1) slag components that diffuse into the brick phases and (2) reaction between slag components and dissolved brick components forming new solid phases. Slow diffusion prevents the slag from reaching its equilibrium concentration before it infiltrates further in the <b>brick.</b> The <b>slag</b> composition, therefore, not merely depends on the occurring reactions but also on the relative diffusion rate in the refractory phases (compared to the slag infiltration rate). status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{reported}} on an experimental program {{to research the}} effect of using blasted copper slag from shipyard repair and maintenance as replacement of fine aggregates in the sand-cement brick. 20 cubes of cement sand brick mixtures were produced with different blasted copper slag ratio ranging from 0 % (for the control mixture) to 60 %. All the sand-cement brick mixtures were tested for their compressive strength, density and water absorption at day 28 of air curing. There was a 16. 28 % improvement in the compressive strength of brick with 20 % replacement of copper slag as fine aggregates in comparison with control mixture. However, the addition of higher percentage of blasted copper slag as fine aggregates resulted in reduction of compressive strength but the density was increased. Also, the results of water absorption decreased as copper <b>slag</b> ratios in <b>brick</b> increases. The water absorption for 60 % of copper <b>slag</b> ratio in <b>brick</b> was the lowest absorption compared to 20 % of copper slag to sand ratio in brick. Hence, {{it is recommended that}} 0 % to 20 % of blasted copper slag may be used as a replacement of fine aggregates in order to obtain a good strength and low density of sand-cement brick.

40|$|AbstractThis {{experimental}} study investigates {{the possibility to}} make a mortar with a ternary sand (natural and artificial fine aggregates). This method is utilized to correct the particle size distribution of various sands used in mortar. For this investigation, three sands have been used: a dune sand (DS), a slag sand (SS), and brick sand (BS) at different proportions in mortar. After crushing, the artificial fine aggregate (blast furnace <b>slag</b> and waste <b>brick</b> fine aggregate) was sifted {{in order to use}} it as fine aggregate. The effect of the quality and grain size distribution of natural fine aggregate (i. e., DS) and artificial fine aggregates (i. e., SS and BS) on the physical properties of ternary sand confected (density, porosity, fineness modulus, equivalent sand, particle size distribution, water absorption) and properties of fresh and hardened mortar were analysed. In the same way for this study, the physical properties and chemical compositions of DS, SS, BS and cement were investigated. The results obtained show that the mechanical strength on mortar depends of the nature and particle size distribution of sand studied. The reuse of this recycled material (slag blast furnace and waste brick) in the industry would contribute to the protection of the environment. This study shows the potential of this method to make mortar with ternary sand (natural and artificial fine aggreagates) in order to improve the physical properties of sand. Utilising natural and artificial fine aggregates to produce quality mortar should yield significant environmental benefits...|$|R
40|$|Understanding the {{correlation}} between the mix proportions, micro structural characteristics, and macro-scale properties of concrete (i. e. the process-structure-properties relationship) is fundamental to achieving a more advanced understanding of how to apply and optimise this abundant engineering material. Although, concrete has been traditionally evaluated by its physico-mechanical and functional properties; development of advanced and effective inspection techniques during the last decade has demonstrated that fundamental macro-level properties of concrete depend, to a great extent, on its properties at the micro- and nano levels. This research was intended to make a quantitative assessment of impact load-induced micro-structural damage in concrete and, more particularly, to investigate the influence of ITZ micro-and nano local properties (as influenced by aggregate characteristics) on the impact load-induced cracking behaviour of concrete. Five different types of concrete mixtures were designed with the same total water cement ratio either by using natural aggregates as reference or by totally replacing the natural coarse aggregate with unconventional aggregates (such as copper <b>slag,</b> blue <b>brick,</b> sintered fly ash and tyre rubber) having significant differences in strength, shape and surface texture, porosity and roughness, and elasticity. A range of advanced techniques including X-ray diffraction, mercury porosimetry, 3 D X-ray computed tomography coupled with digital image analysis, laser surface profilometry, 3 D nanotech vertical scanning interferometry and scanning electron microscopy fitted with energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer were used to characterize the aggregates and the concrete micro-structures. Based on the results obtained a possible mechanism for the micro-structural damage in concrete was proposed. Poorer aggregate characteristics alone could be responsible for a greater ITZ deterioration after loading but the results demonstrated that in fact, the aggregate causes a change in the ITZ conditions and it is these altered ITZ conditions that have a major effect on overall mix behaviour and govern the damaging process of concrete under impact loading. It was also concluded that the presence of a weak and porous ITZ has two opposite effects on the failure process. First, the chemical and porosity heterogeneities within the ITZ can cause fluctuations/disordering in the cracking (fracture) path, resulting in an increase in the tortuosity and corresponding fracture energy dissipation. Second, a weak and porous ITZ transfers less stress from the matrix to the aggregate particles. This leads to a lower compressive strength but increased toughness due to micro crack path lengthening and energy dissipation. Finally, the effect of the aggregate on the surface area roughness of the ITZ was established {{for the first time in}} the concrete literature. The roughness number of the area near the ITZ was found to positively correlate with dissipated surface fracture energy. An increase in the roughness number is associated with an increase in the dissipated fracture energy. The significance of this correlation however, lies in the fact that the rougher near – ITZ fraction of the bulk paste is more resistant to cracking at the macro level. Findings from this study will lead to a better understanding of the impact load-induced micro-structural damage phenomena. In addition, the micro-structural data from SEM and X-ray CT obtained during impact and mechanical testing of the concrete mixtures could be used to develop a multi-scale finite element model to simulate and predict the behaviour and fracture damage of concrete subjected to dynamic loading.

40|$|For the {{fabrication}} of {{iron ore pellets}} at LKAB (Luossavaara-Kiirunavaara AB), one of the methods used is to sinter the pellets in a rotary kiln. This Kiln has a drift temperature of 1250 °C in average. During this process a coating, causing the wear of the refractories materials, is formed, inducing expensive maintenance periods. The aim of this work {{is to find the}} reaction that takes place between the <b>Slag</b> and the <b>bricks,</b> in order to find the parameters that have to be changed to improve the bricks lifetime in the kiln. The use of bricks with higher alumina content is one of the solutions, but it is expensive. The influence of Alkalis and especially Na 2 O has been studied before in inert atmosphere. In this work it will be studied in air as well as the influence of the alumina content of the brick. Experiments were performed in air atmosphere, using powder samples that have been compressed into pellets. The devices used to characterize the reaction and the product of the reaction were: Kanthal furnace, X-ray diffraction (XRD), dilatometer, differential scanning calorimetry and thermogravimetry (DSC/TG) in-situ mass spectrometer, Scanning electron microscope (SEM) and Energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS). The XRD experiments permitted to show the presence of a glassy phase after a heat treatment of the samples containing alkalis at 1350 °C. Dilatometer experiments gave more information about the influence of alkalis: it catalyzed the sintering reaction. The DSC/TG/spectrometer permitted to show three main reactions. One at 1175 °C for the samples containing a low content of alkalis and a low content of Alumina. For the samples with addition of 10 wt% of Na 2 CO 3, and 20 wt% and more of alumina to the brick, a reaction is observed at 1235 °C and one with a maximum at 1300 °C. The SEM pictures and EDS show the formation of different phases. Unfortunately it was only possible to identify with certitude the Hematite, the Corundum and a glassy phase. The reliability off the EDS measurements is low, due to the oxides used and a special correction of the data had to be done. The conclusions of the study are: - For the samples {{with a small amount of}} alkalis, hematite dissolves mullite at 1175 °C and forms Fe 2 O 3 Al 2 O 3 and a phase with a nepheline composition (Na 2 O. Al 2 O 3. 2 SiO 2) that melts at 1235 °C. - For the samples with high content of alkalis, all the mullite is dissolved. Silica coming form the decomposition of mullite enters completely the melt and needles crystallize in the melt around 1300 °C. - Brick with high alumina content start to react with the slag at 1235 °C to form needles around 1300 °C. In a future work, WDS or TEM will give a higher reliability than EDS, according detection of the phases. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|R
40|$|Bricks {{production}} requires important inputs {{of resources}} and energy and causes several environmental impacts, such as carbon emissions [1]. Studies [2 - 4] have indicated {{that most of the}} energy consumption and emissions can be directly attributed to the firing stage of the production process. The environmental impacts of brick production have induced research for environmentally viable alternatives to the firing stage. Amongst them, carbonation and alkali activation are very promising options [5, 6]. Carbonation is a process wherein materials rich in alkali oxides react with CO 2 to form stable carbonate minerals under natural or accelerating environment. Alkali-activated materials are alternative building materials prepared by means of reaction between an alkali with materials rich in CaO. A possible source of minerals available for carbonation and alkali activation are stainless steel slags, thanks to their high calcium oxide content rendering a high alkalinity [7, 8]. According to [9], during the production of stainless steel, 2 to 4 tons of waste (sludge and slags) are generated per ton of steel produced, resulting in an estimated global production ranging from 220 to 420 Mt of slags per year [7]. Today slags are usually recycled as filling material in construction (down cycling) or directly landfilled. However, interest in using steel making slags in more added-value carbonation and alkali- activation based products has risen since the slags are cheap and readily available secondary raw material. Additionally, the recycling of the slags as a secondary source can reduce the amount of harmful substances contained in the slags and released to the environment, as they will be trapped {{in the structure of the}} new inert materials [10]. The study investigates the environmental benefits of production of innovative bricks made from stainless steel making <b>slags.</b> Three different <b>brick</b> types (called SSSBricks) were developed using slags from stainless steel making processes. One type (perforated) has been made through carbonation, while two other brick types (solid and aerated) have been produced through alkali-activation. The alkali-activated bricks were produced by mixing two types of slag, Argon Oxygen Decarburization (AOD) slags and Continuous Casting (CtCs) slags, with river sand at 1 : 3 wt ratio and a mixture of Na/K hydroxides and Na/K silicates. They were cured in a steam curing chamber. For solid bricks the steam curing temperature was kept at 90 °C and atmospheric pressure, whereas the aerated bricks were cured at 150 °C and 4 bar pressure. The carbonation was carried out on perforated bricks in a carbonation chamber with 10 % volume of CO 2 at atmospheric pressure and also in a carbonation reactor at 80 °C and partial pressure of 8 bars in a 100 % CO 2 environment. In order to identify the key environmental gains related to the use of SSSBricks, an environmental assessment including energy consumption, resource use and waste management is required [11]. A Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) has been conducted in order to assess the environmental impacts associated with the production phase of the SSSBricks. Impacts from production of a SSSBrick have been compared with impacts from production of traditional bricks with similar properties (substitutes) that are already available in European markets. In particular, traditional clay-bricks are compared with solid and perforated SSSBicks, while autoclaved concrete bricks are compared with aerated SSSBricks. The LCA results show that solid and perforated SSSBricks have lower overall impacts compared with clay bricks, while aerated SSSBricks carry the higher impacts compared with autoclaved bricks. The results proved that the avoided use of fossil fuels and energy, due to the omission of a firing stage in carbonation and alkali activition processes, lowers significantly the environmental burdens. Furthermore, the avoided impacts of slag stabilization (required in order to dispose the slag in landfills or to recycle them as filling material) and the CO 2 uptake (in carbonation) contribute to the positive environmental profile of SSSBricks. However the electricity consumption, the necessity of a pure CO 2 gas stream in carbonation and the production of alkali-activators represent the main drawback of the processes. Optimization procedures and research on alternative sources of alkali activators and CO 2 are therefore required in order to further improve the environmental performance of SSSBrick technology. status: publishe...|$|R
