50|$|When a {{traditional}} deposit bank provide loans such as business lending, mortgage, overdraft or credit card, they are {{stuck with the}} borrowers for years or even decades. Therefore, they have incentive to assess the borrowers' credit risk and further monitor the borrowers finance through their branch managers. In securitised loan, those who originate the loan can immediately sell off the loan to SIVs and other institutional investors and these buyers of <b>securitised</b> <b>loans</b> {{are the ones who}} are stuck with credit risk. Therefore, in SIV intermediation, there is the same incentive to assess credit risk of borrowers, as they expect to hold the asset to maturity. However, the loan originators', typically a Bank's, reward is structured so that as more loans are made and sold wholesale, more commission will be earned. So there is little need for bank originators to monitor their borrowers' credit risk. The monitoring was the responsibility of the end investor in the securitised tranches and, theoretically, the rating agencies. While most SIVs were able to make good credit decisions for their portfolios and did not experience any credit losses from securitisations, some invested in Sub prime US RMBS.|$|E

40|$|The {{thesis is}} an {{investigation}} into the pricing of credit risk under the intensity framework with a copula generating default dependence between obligors. The challenge of quantifying credit risk and the derivatives that are associated with the asset class has seen an explosion of mathematical research into the topic. As credit markets developed the modelling of credit risk on a portfolio level, under the intensity framework, was unsatisfactory in that either: 1. The state variables of the intensities were driven by diffusion processes and so could not generate the observed level of default correlation (see Schönbucher (2003 a)) or, 2. When a jump component was added to the state variables, it solved the problem of low default correlation, but the model became intractable with a high number of parameters to calibrate to (see Chapovsky and Tevaras (2006)) or, 3. Use was made of the conditional independence framework (see Duffie and Garleanu (2001)). Here, conditional on a common factor, obligors’ intensities are independent. However the framework does not produce the observed level of default correlation, especially for portfolios with obligors that are dispersed in terms of credit quality. Practitioners seeking to have interpretable parameters, tractability and to reproduce observed default correlations shifted away from generating default dependence with intensities and applied copula technology to credit portfolio pricing. The one factor Gaussian copula and some natural extensions, all falling under the factor framework, became standard approaches. The factor framework is an efficient means of generating dependence between obligors. The problem with the factor framework {{is that it does not}} give a representation to the dynamics of credit risk, which arise because credit spreads evolve with time. A comprehensive framework which seeks to address these issues is developed in the thesis. The framework has four stages: 1. Choose an intensity model and calibrate the initial term structure. 2. Calibrate the variance parameter of the chosen state variable of the intensity model. 3. When extended to a portfolio of obligors choose a copula and calibrate to standard market portfolio products. 4. Combine the two modelling frameworks, copula and intensity, to produce a dynamic model that generates dependence amongst obligors. The thesis contributes to the literature in the following way: • It finds explicit analytical formula for the pricing of credit default swaptions with an intensity process that is driven by the extended Vasicek model. From this an efficient calibration routine is developed. Many works (Jamshidian (2002), Morini and Brigo (2007) and Schönbucher (2003 b)) have focused on modelling credit swap spreads directly with modified versions of the Black and Scholes option formula. The drawback of using a modified Black and Scholes approach is that pricing of more exotic structures whose value depend on the term structure of credit spreads is not feasible. In addition, directly modelling credit spreads, which is required under these approaches, offers no explicit way of simulating default times. In contrast, with intensity models, there is a direct mechanism to simulate default times and a representation of the term structure of credit spreads is given. Brigo and Alfonsi (2005) and Bielecki et al. (2008) also consider intensity modelling for the purposes of pricing credit default swaptions. In their works the dynamics of the intensity process is driven by the Cox Ingersoll and Ross (CIR) model. Both works are constrained because the parameters of the CIR model they consider are constant. This means that when there is more than one tradeable credit default swaption exact calibration of the model is usually not possible. This restriction is not in place in our methodology. • The thesis develops a new method, called the loss algorithm, in order to construct the loss distribution of a portfolio of obligors. The current standard approach developed by Turc et al. (2004) requires differentiation of an interpolated curve (see Hagan and West (2006) for the difficulties of such an approach) and assumes the existence of a base correlation curve. The loss algorithm does not require the existence of a base correlation curve or differentiation of an interpolated curve to imply the portfolio loss distribution. • Schubert and Schönbucher (2001) show theoretically how to combine copula models and stochastic intensity models. In the thesis the Schubert and Schönbucher (2001) framework is implemented by combining the extended Vasicek model and the Gaussian copula model. An analysis of the impact of the parameters of the combined models and how they interact is given. This is as follows: – The analysis is performed by considering two products, <b>securitised</b> <b>loans</b> with embedded triggers and leverage credit linked notes with recourse. The two products both have dependence on two obligors, a counterparty and a reference obligor. – Default correlation is shown to impact significantly on pricing. – We establish that having large volatilities in the spread dynamics of the reference obligor or counterparty creates a de-correlating impact: the higher the volatility the lower the impact of default correlation. – The analysis is new because, classically, spread dynamics are not considered when modelling dependence between obligors. • The thesis introduces a notion called the stochastic liquidity threshold which illustrates a new way to induce intensity dynamics into the factor framework. • Finally the thesis shows that the valuation results for single obligor credit default swaptions can be extended to portfolio index swaptions after assuming losses on the portfolio occur on a discretised set and independently to the index spread level.

40|$|M. Comm. The {{securitisation}} industry {{started in}} the early 1970 s in the United States when securities, backed by pools of home loans, were issued for the first time. During the 1980 s, securities supported by other types of financial assets such as auto loans and credit card receivables were issued. Since then, securitisation has expanded rapidly into many countries, including South Africa. The first securitisation transaction in South Africa was a securitisation of home loans in 1989, but very few securitisations came to the market after that. In December 2001 the South African Reserve Bank amended the securitisation regulations, which had been in existence since 1992. This created greater certainty for arrangers and investors, and from 2002, the South African securitisation market has grown quickly, driven by frequent securitisation issues by banks. Securitisation is attractive for banks, {{because it is an}} additional funding source and allows for the matching of the maturity of a bank’s assets and liabilities. Another reason for the attractiveness of securitisation for banks {{is that it is a}} mechanism for managing the regulatory capital that a bank is required to hold. In a securitisation transaction, a loan originator such as a bank sells loans on its balance sheet to an independent company, which issues asset-backed securities to fund the acquisition of loans. Provided the transaction complies with the securitisation regulations, the transaction will result in the bank having to hold less regulatory capital compared to a situation where it had not <b>securitised</b> the <b>loans.</b> This “regulatory capital arbitrage” has been a major factor in banks’ <b>securitising</b> <b>loans.</b> Regulatory capital arbitrage is possible because of the relatively simplistic manner in which the Basel I capital adequacy guidelines calculate the regulatory capital a bank is required to hold. Given the worldwide growth of the securitisation industry, regulators have become increasingly concerned that banks may not be holding adequate capital as a buffer for the economic risks to which banks are exposed. The Bank for International Settlements, through its Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, has therefore devised a new set of capital adequacy guidelines to replace the Basel I guidelines. The aim of the new Basel II framework is to achieve a greater alignment of regulatory capital with economic risks and to improve risk management practices in banks. Although the Basel Committee cannot enforce its recommendations, it is expected that most regulators throughout the world will adopt the Basel II framework. It is generally expected that the implementation of Basel II will have a substantial impact on banks’ securitisation activities, especially to the extent that securitisation has been used for regulatory capital arbitrage purposes...|$|R

40|$|Bond {{markets have}} {{expanded}} rapidly in emerging East Asian economies in recent years. Asian policymakers {{have played a}} pivotal role in this development. This process presents an interesting challenge to the developmental state literature associated with bank-based financial systems. We argue that it is best to understand {{the role of the state}} as an entrepreneurial state in the construction of these markets, focusing on institutional innovation in three mechanisms of state-led market infrastructure: national or local credit rating agencies, mortgage corporations and bond pricing agencies. National credit rating agencies rate the creditworthiness of debt in local currency. Mortgage corporations create markets in <b>securitised</b> housing <b>loans.</b> Bond pricing agencies put a value on illiquid debt instruments to enable mark-to-market portfolio management. Together, these three mechanisms constitute the core determinants of the market (demand for creditworthy products, supply of tradeable assets, and the fixing of a price to those assets). In so doing they influence the nature of market operations, producing outcomes very different from the free market ideal type. We also consider cross-country commonalities and variations in this general pattern...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the power of}} different contractual mechanisms to influence an originator’s choice of costly effort to screen borrowers when the originator plans to <b>securitise</b> its <b>loans.</b> The analysis focuses on three potential mechanisms: the originator holds a “vertical slice”, or share of the portfolio; the originator holds the equity tranche of a structured finance transaction; the originator holds the mezzanine tranche, rather than the equity tranche. These mechanisms will result in differing levels of screening, and the differences arise from varying sensitivities to a systematic risk factor. Equity tranche retention {{is not always the}} most effective mechanism, and the equity tranche can be dominated by either a vertical slice or a mezzanine tranche if the probability of a downturn is likely and if the equity tranche is likely to be depleted in a downturn. If the choice of how much and what form to retain is left up to the originator, the retention mechanism may lead to low screening effort, suggesting a potential rationale for government intervention. retention requirements, screening incentives, securitisation, tranching...|$|R
40|$|Focusing on {{shareholder}} value (SHV) maximising banks vs. stakeholder value (STV) maximising banks, we ask: Why do they coexist? What does the recent crisis suggest for their respective sustainability? On the first, we conclude STVs – often cooperatives, catering also for parties other than shareholders – may superiorly manage {{the conflict of}} interests between depositors and bank owners and also strengthen borrowers' screening/monitoring. Accordingly, STVs should specialise in traditional intermediation, SHV in financial innovations. Next, we notice that the past financial innovation transformed the banking model from 'originate to hold' (OTH) to 'originate to distribute' (OTD). Knowing ex ante, they would immediately <b>securitise</b> originated <b>loans</b> on financial markets, OTD banks lowered their credit standards. Thus, the OTD model proved unsustainable. Since STV (SHV) stuck prevalently to OTH (moved to OTD), the crisis suggests STV are more sustainable. This contrasts with the prejudice against STV banks, often described before the crisis as outdated and inefficient. banks; banking; sustainable lending; {{shareholder value}}; stakeholder value; financial crises; relationship lending; loans; maximisation; cooperatives; conflict of interests; depositors; bankers; borrowers; screening; monitoring; borrowing; intermediation; innovation; originate to hold; originate to distribute; distribution; loan securitisation; financial markets; credit standards; inefficiency; sustainability; sustainable development; sustainable economy. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the optimal design of retention in securitisation, {{in order to}} maximize welfare of screening per unit of retention, assuming that screening is costly and that the bank intends to <b>securitise</b> its <b>loans.</b> In contrast to the focus of previous literature on tranche retention, we deviate from the constitutional mechanisms of tranche retention to present a pareto-optimal method of tranche retention. Unlike the current ad-hoc-regulations, we derive the optimal design of retention from a utility maximization problem. We show that the level of retention per tranche should be dependent on the rate of credit default, i. e. the higher the rate of default, the higher the optimal rate of retention required to provide an incentive to screen carefully. From this approach, it follows that the rate of retention per tranche should be higher, the higher the position within the ranking order of subordination. Accordingly, the efficiency of tranche retention can be enhanced, reducing the level of retention required to maintain a given level of screening-effort. This retention design entails a recovery of the bank’s equity capital, thereby increasing liquidity and lending capacities...|$|R

40|$|The European {{market for}} asset-backed {{securities}} (ABS) {{has all but}} closed for business {{since the start of}} the economic and financial crisis. ABS (see Box 1) were in fact the first financial assets hit at the onset of the crisis in 2008. The subprime mortgage meltdown caused a deterioration in the quality of collateral in the ABS market in the United States, which in turn dried up overall liquidity because ABS AAA notes were popular collateral for inter-bank lending. The lack of demand for these products, together with the Great Recession in 2009, had a considerable negative impact on the European ABS market. The post-crisis regulatory environment has further undermined the market. The practice of slicing and dicing of loans into ABS packages was blamed for starting and spreading the crisis through the global financial system. Regulation in the post-crisis context has thus been relatively unfavourable to these types of instruments, with heightened capital requirements now necessary for the issuance of new ABS products. And yet policymakers have recently underlined the need to revitalise the ABS market as a tool to improve credit market conditions in the euro area and to enhance transmission of monetary policy. In particular, the European Central Bank and the Bank of England have jointly emphasised that: “a market for prudently designed ABS has the potential to improve the efficiency of resource allocation in the economy and to allow for better risk sharing [...] . by transforming relatively illiquid assets into more liquid securities. These can then be sold to investors thereby allowing originators to obtain funding and, potentially, transfer part of the underlying risk, while investors in such securities can diversify their portfolios [...] .. This can lead to lower costs of capital, higher economic growth and a broader distribution of risk” (ECB and Bank of England, 2014 a). In addition, consideration has started to be given to the extent to which ABS products could become the target of explicit monetary policy operations, a line of action proposed by Claeys et al (2014). The ECB has officially announced the start of preparatory work related to possible outright purchases of selected ABS 1. In this paper we discuss how a revamped market for corporate <b>loans</b> <b>securitised</b> via ABS products, and how use of ABS as a monetary policy instrument, can indeed play a role in revitalising Europe’s credit market. However, before using this instrument a number of issues should be addressed: First, the European ABS market has significantly contracted since the crisis. Hence it needs to be revamped through appropriate regulation if securitisation is to play a role in improving the efficiency of resource allocation in the economy. Second, even assuming that this market can expand again, the European ABS market is heterogeneous: lending criteria are different in different countries and banking institutions and the rating methodologies to assess the quality of the borrowers have to take these differences into account. One further element of differentiation is default law, which is specific to national jurisdictions in the euro area. Therefore, the pool of loans will not only be different in terms of the macro risks related to each country of origination (which is a ‘positive’ idiosyncratic risk, because it enables a portfolio manager to differentiate), but also in terms of the normative side, in case of default. The latter introduces uncertainties and inefficiencies in the ABS market that could create arbitrage opportunities. It is also unclear to what extent a direct purchase of these securities by the ECB might have an impact on the credit market. This will depend on, for example, the type of securities targeted in terms of the underlying assets that would be considered as eligible for inclusion (such as loans to small and medium-sized companies, car loans, leases, residential and commercial mortgages). The timing of a possible move by the ECB is also an issue; immediate action would take place in the context of relatively limited market volumes, while if the ECB waits, it might have access to a larger market, provided steps are taken in the next few months to revamp the market. We start by discussing the first of these issues – the size of the EU ABS market. We estimate how much this market could be worth if some specific measures are implemented. We then discuss the different options available to the ECB should they decide to intervene in the EU ABS market. We include a preliminary list of regulatory steps that could be taken to homogenise asset-backed securities in the euro area. We conclude with our recommended course of action...|$|R
