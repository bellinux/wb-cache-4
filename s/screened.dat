40|$|Abstract Background Repeated {{participation}} {{is important in}} faecal immunochemical testing (FIT) <b>screening</b> for colorectal cancer (CRC). However, {{a large number of}} <b>screening</b> invitations over time may lead to <b>screening</b> fatigue and consequently, decreased participation rates. We evaluated the impact of <b>screening</b> fatigue on overall <b>screening</b> programme effectiveness. Methods Using the ASCCA model, we simulated the Dutch CRC <b>screening</b> programme consisting of biennial FIT <b>screening</b> in individuals aged 55 – 75. We studied the resilience of the programme against heterogeneity in <b>screening</b> attendance and decrease in participation rate due to <b>screening</b> fatigue. Outcomes were reductions in CRC incidence and mortality compared to no <b>screening.</b> Results Assuming a homogenous 63  % participation, i. e., each round each individual was equally likely to attend <b>screening,</b> 30  years of <b>screening</b> reduced CRC incidence and mortality by 39 and 53  %, respectively, compared to no <b>screening.</b> When assuming clustered participation, i. e., three subgroups of individuals with a high (95  %), moderate (65  %) and low (5  %) participation rate, <b>screening</b> was less effective; reductions were 33  % for CRC incidence and 43  % for CRC mortality. <b>Screening</b> fatigue considerably reduced <b>screening</b> effectiveness; if individuals refrained from <b>screening</b> after three negative <b>screens,</b> model-predicted incidence reductions decreased to 25 and 18  % under homogenous and clustered participation, respectively. Figures were 34 and 25  % for mortality reduction. Conclusions <b>Screening</b> will substantially decrease CRC incidence and mortality. However, <b>screening</b> effectiveness can be seriously compromised if <b>screening</b> fatigue occurs.

40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{assess the}} {{cost-effectiveness}} of <b>screening</b> 50 - to 70 -year-old adults for hearing loss in The Netherlands. We compared no <b>screening,</b> telephone <b>screening,</b> Internet <b>screening,</b> <b>screening</b> with a handheld <b>screening</b> device, and audiometric <b>screening</b> for various starting ages and a varying number of repeated screenings. MethodsThe costs per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) for no <b>screening</b> and for 76 <b>screening</b> strategies {{were analyzed using}} a Markov model with cohort simulation for the year 2011. <b>Screening</b> was deemed to be cost-effective if the costs were less than € 20, 000 /QALY. ResultsScreening with a handheld <b>screening</b> device and audiometric <b>screening</b> were generally more costly but less effective than telephone and Internet <b>screening.</b> Internet <b>screening</b> strategies were slightly better than telephone <b>screening</b> strategies. Internet <b>screening</b> at age 50 years, repeated at ages 55, 60, 65, and 70 years, was the most cost-effective strategy, costing € 3699 /QALY. At a threshold of € 20, 000 /QALY, this strategy was with 100 % certainty cost-effective compared with current practice and with 69 % certainty the most cost-effective strategy among all strategies. ConclusionsThis study suggests that Internet <b>screening</b> at age 50 years, repeated at ages 55, 60, 65, and 70 years, is the optimal strategy to <b>screen</b> for hearing loss and might be considered for nationwide implementation...|$|R
