40|$|Safe {{drinking}} water without toxic chemicals {{is crucial for}} people's health. A recently developed sensor {{for the detection of}} toxic components in water is the microbial fuel cell (MFC) -based biosensor. In this biosensor, substrate consumption rate and metabolic activity of bacteria are directly related to the electric current. A reduction in current under otherwise similar conditions is an indication of toxic inhibition. Under steady state conditions, current can be described by the Butler–Volmer–Monod (BVM) model. Knowing which parameters of this model change under toxic contamination can give an indication on the type of toxicity. The model requires that the substrate concentration is known. It is shown in this paper that is not possible to estimate both the substrate concentration as well as the BVM parameters on-line from current data at constant overpotential. However, it appears that substrate concentration and substrate consumption rate can be estimated on-line, and that after a linear reparametrization the BVM parameters can be estimated by ordinary least-squares techniques from a polarization curve that is generated as soon as a suspect change in current occurs. Analysis shows that a weighted least-squares method is necessary to <b>secure</b> a good <b>fit</b> at the overpotentials where current is most sensitive to changes in kinetic parameters.

50|$|More than 125,000 years ago, early Archaic Homo sapiens such as Homo heidelbergensis {{developed}} the {{extensive use of}} hafted stone tools. Over time, hafting evolved and tools became deadlier with more control. Evolution has brought hafts with small shafts and dull stone tools to longer stronger shafts with sharper, narrower tools that were better suited for piercing and cutting. In much more recent times, hafted axes and weapons have benefited from tapering. By offsetting the diameters of a tool with a cylindrical base, and {{a hole in the}} shaft, a much more <b>secure</b> <b>fit</b> can be made, assuring the ax head stays in place. Hafting stone points in particular was an important advancement in the weapons of early humans. These hafted stone points increased the force and effectiveness of these tools therefore allowing people to hunt and kill animals more efficiently. The increased efficiency of hunting and killing animals is believed to have allowed for people of this time to have regular access to meat and other high quality foods. The increase in the consumption of meat around this time could be directly linked to increases in brain size that is reported in the archaeology record of this time. The invention of hafting by people more than hundreds of thousands of years ago has directly contributed to the health and lives of people in the past and also people in the future.|$|E

5000|$|The {{composition}} of the team for the khedda system to trap elephants comprised drum beaters, mahouts, security men, assistants and trained elephants known as kumkis. After locating a herd of wild elephants to be captured it was encircled by the team of the hunters sealing all routes of escape. A fenced circuit of 6 - 8 sq mi area was created and cordoned around the herd; this was stocked with adequate supply of feeds and water and well camouflaged.To prevent elephants from going astray, big fires were lit, shouting done, drums beaten and gun shots fired to scare the elephants and keep them confined. Following this activity of keeping the elephants within the confined space, building of the enclosure was carried out. This enclosure, located in a camouflaged area along {{one of the main}} paths of the elephant, was built to dimensions of about 20 - 50 yard m diameter raised to a height of 12 ft. The enclosure was fortified with slanting buttresses and ties. A highly <b>secure</b> entrance gate <b>fitted</b> with spikes was built.

2500|$|Balmoral Place {{was about}} two hundred metres from the Police Station in Harrison Road. The police office was quite large. At ground floor level there was the main {{reception}} behind double entrance doors. Further in were various rooms used for storage. At this level were the cells for the prisoners just arrested and for those prisoners attending the magistrates' court in the building. There was no basement in the building and this was why the court was on the first floor. Access from the cells to the court was up a short flight of stairs which had a double doored cage around them and a door at the stairs' base. This was for security and allowed the magistrates or judge to 'send the prisoner down'. There were twelve cells in total and these were for short duration use only. The prisoners travelled to and from Leeds prison. There was a large courtyard between the court building and the police station which was used for police parades. The parade ground was also used for exercising the horses and housed four stables. From reception, going {{up the steps to}} the first floor the first item encountered was the police enquiry desk. Behind the desk were three corridors. One corridor to the left housed the typists' room, a small room for the senior typist and a store room. There was also a sergeants anteroom and the sergeants main room. There was another corridor to the right which housed the chief typist, an inspector, a chief inspector and a superintendent. At the far end was the chief constable's office which had a constable seated at its entrance day and night. The Criminal Investigation Department was in another corridor. There was one more set of stairs at the rear of the police station.

40|$|This thesis {{seeks to}} explore and {{understand}} the appointment process of first-time FTSE 100 NEDs. It has been widely acknowledged for over three decades that the appointment process of NEDs is an opaque process involving a homogeneous {{group of people in}} an ‘old boys’ network. Corporate governance reforms recommend a formal and transparent appointment process which taps into a wider pool of talent. Companies comply with these recommendations yet there has been scant change in the composition of corporate boards. The pilot study consisted of nine interviews with the main stakeholders in the appointment process of a NED, namely Chairman, Executive Search Firms and NEDs. Analysis of the interview transcripts revealed that reputational capital was the basis on which a first-time NED appointment was made after the Chairman had carried out an extensive vetting process to establish the fit of the individual. The main study, based on 15 first-time FTSE 100 NED interviews, sought to understand reputational capital, its constituent parts and how individuals developed it. Further, it sought to explore how an individual’s fit for a NED was established. The analysis revealed that the reputational capital of an appointed NED was a blend of sufficient levels of human, social and cultural capital which had been communicated to the Chairman {{and other members of the}} corporate elite. A first-time NED, in gaining a foothold on a corporate board was also entitled to membership of the corporate elite. As reputational capital drives success of directors in the corporate elite, new individuals needed to fit with the norms and values appropriate for membership and carry no reputational risk for existing members particularly the Chairman. This research offers three main contributions to the literature. Firstly, at a theoretical level it extends the concept of board capital to include cultural capital in addition to human and social capital. Secondly, it proposes a conceptual framework which demonstrates how an individual builds reputational capital over the course of a career to <b>secure</b> <b>fit</b> for a first- time NED, as a position in the corporate elite. The framework clarifies our understanding of reputational capital as a combination of human, social and cultural capital in a unique blend of board capital. This board capital is communicated through reputation building activities to members of the corporate elite. Thirdly, at an empirical level it provides an understanding of the FTSE 100 NED appointment process...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2012 INTRODUCTION: Over {{1 million}} Americans {{currently}} {{live with a}} lower limb amputation. Lower limb prostheses {{have been designed to}} produce a <b>secure</b> and comfortable <b>fit</b> between residual limb and prosthesis throughout the day. However, significant fluid volume fluctuations in the residual limb deteriorate socket fit and may cause decreased mobility due to discomfort or soft tissue injury from increased pressures and shear stresses. Extracellular fluid is thought to be the primary source of limb volume fluctuation and commonly decreases {{over the course of the}} day. Technologies designed to address limb fluid volume loss are ineffective and cumbersome. Methods to assess limb fluid volume change are also poor, lacking the capability to quantify fluid volume loss at high temporal resolution and while the prosthesis is donned. METHODS: Bioimpedance analysis provides tools to rapidly estimate extracellular fluid volume while a subject performs regular activity with the prosthesis donned. Using a custom bioimpedance analyzer, we tested 16 subjects each on three separate occasions in a repeated measures study. Each test session consisted of an activity sequence followed by a 30 minute period of calm sitting (dubbed the recovery sit). During the recovery sit, subjects sat with their prosthesis donned (ON), prosthesis doffed (OFF), or liner donned (LINER). An identical activity sequence followed the 30 minute sit. RESULTS: Volume changes during the OFF 30 minute recovery sit were significantly higher than during ON (p < 0. 001). We observed that after the limb gained fluid volume during the OFF protocol, subsequent volume loss was negligible in 12 of 16 subjects during the following activity sequence. Conversely, volume lost during the 30 minute recovery period during ON was not recovered during three cycles of activity. During the LINER protocol, volume gains during the 30 minute sit were similar to those during OFF, but returned to baseline levels during subsequent activity. Gains in LINER during subsequent activity still remained elevated as compared to ON (p < 0. 01). CONCLUSIONS: Decreasing applied pressure to the residual limb may function to recover limb fluid volume, allowing socket users to maintain a comfortable fit between limb and prosthesis. There exists a potential for development of socket technology that leverages pressure release to recover limb fluid volume...|$|R
40|$|Two things tend to {{be claimed}} about the modernist novel, as {{exemplified}} at its height by Virginia Woolf’s The Waves (1931) — first, that it abandons the stability owed to conventional characterization, and second, that the narrow narration of intelligence alone survives the sacrifice. For The Waves, the most common way of putting {{this is to say}} that the novel contains “not characters, but characteristics,” “not characters[,] but voices,” but that the voices that remain capture “highly conscious intelligence” at work. Character fractures, but intelligence is enshrined. “Artless: Ignorance in the Novel and the Making of Modern Character” argues that both of these presumptions are misplaced, and that the early moments of British modernism instead consolidated characterization around a form of ignorance, or what I call “artlessness” — a condition through which characters come to unlearn the educations that have constituted them, and so are able to escape the modes of knowledge imposed by the prevailing educational establishment. Whether for Aristotle or Hegel, Freud or Foucault, education has long been understood as the means by which subjects are formed; with social circumstances put in place before us, any idea of independent character is only a polite fiction. In fiction itself, this process is built into the form of the Bildungsroman, where the narrative ends only when socialization is <b>secured,</b> with <b>fit</b> elements absorbed into the social structure, and unfit elements expunged. With the passage of the Elementary Education Act of 1870, the British government was for the first time able to assert this influence explicitly, establishing secular state control of education and creating an enormous class of newly literate readers. Modernism’s signature style — its baroque locutions, its obscure references — has most often been read as the attempt of educated elites to alienate these inexperienced readers by making literature intelligible only to the eminently intelligent. But when facing the state’s newly acknowledged role in socializing subjects, novelists as otherwise antagonistic to one another’s work as Henry James, Thomas Hardy, D. H. Lawrence, and the aesthetes of the Bloomsbury group, from Lytton Strachey and John Maynard Keynes to Virginia Woolf, all commonly responded, I contend, by resisting education’s role in forming character in the first place. The figures who would go on to shape the modernist movement used their narratives to escape this pedagogical construct, imagining an alternative to the Bildungsroman model capable of chronicling an incremental divestment from social authority. This reversal of modernism’s priorities offers to reorganize not only our understanding of the period, but of the function of character in structuring a reader’s experience. Critics seldom imagine “modernist character” as a category deserving further definition. Gerard Genette famously suggested that there are no characters in Proust, because all are subject to the author’s totalizing style. Recent inquiries, like Philip Weinstein’s, Gregory Castle’s, or Jed Esty’s, entertain the very notion of modernist character only to suggest that it was sacrificed in favor of form. As this project uncovers, however, many of modernism’s signature formal gestures — from stream of consciousness narration in James to minimalist depictions of the Great War in Lawrence — were first tested and contested as strategies for abetting artlessness in characterization. At root, “Artless” makes a case for the almost perfect convergence between a work’s unraveling and its reader’s reception; the works it considers aspire towards complete readerly accessibility, ultimately effacing any interference from intermediate authorities, even their authors. My first chapter, “The Educations of Isabel Archer,” makes character’s precedence over form explicit through comparison of a single scene in the two versions of Henry James’s The Portrait of a Lady, the original 1881 edition alongside the New York Edition of 1906. Isabel, James’s heroine, has long been read as the prototypical Bildungsroman protagonist, one whose intelligence is so penetrating that her education is achieved instantaneously when a mere glance arrests the history of her husband’s onetime affair with her close friend. In the original 1881 edition, Isabel observes that “Madame Merle sat there in her bonnet,” and when mere sentences later we find her “standing on the rug,” the reader’s shock can only be commensurate to Isabel’s own. With the original sequence, James had in fact produced stream of consciousness narration, well before its recognized first appearance in Edouard Dujardin’s 1887 Les Lauriers sont coupés. Yet with a single change to the New York Edition, James cancels a formal effect that had captured Isabel’s intelligence at its most potent and immediate. What readers witness in the New York Edition is not Isabel’s awakening knowledge, but her sudden ability to exorcise all that she has thus far been taught. When forced to choose between his character’s independence from social constraint and the formal innovation of “sat,” James chooses character. Isabel’s passage from intelligence to ignorance between 1881 and 1906 thus signifies a reevaluation of the role of education in fiction across the period itself. Subsequent chapters track the role of formal and narrative structures in allowing readers to recognize — and ultimately embrace — artlessness. In the case of Thomas Hardy’s Jude the Obscure (1895), as described in my second chapter, “Educational Epidemiology,” the story of the “Fawley curse” provides a model for narrative’s pedagogical potential: to have learned the story is to share in its misfortune. This model multiplies relentlessly, almost epidemiologically, so that the party at greatest risk becomes Hardy’s own reader. By extending the pedagogical production of narrative beyond its own pages, Jude the Obscure frames the ease with which education entangles individuals in a social fabric, even against their will. We ourselves face a choice: between sympathy to Sue and Jude’s characters, or obedience to the narrative form that has infected us. As the following chapter, “Knowing War in Women in Love,” suggests, the curiously repetitive characterizations and tautological phrases that riddle D. H. Lawrence’s 1920 novel capture how thoroughgoing artless representations must be to escape the pedagogical system entirely. In response to then contemporaneous changes to libel law and to philosophical disputes over the definition of personhood, Lawrence essentially removed the entire field of referential definition from the novel between drafts, excising the very connection between words and reference that allows a set of phrases to single out a person in particular. Lawrence’s characters remain uncompromised by convention because their circumstances can never be named. Women in Love carries artlessness to a new extreme, marking the moment when the stakes of character became compelling enough to organize all else around it. Lawrence’s characters operate in a world so thoroughly desocialized that they — with Lawrence’s original readers — are able to overlook that even the most mobilizing social event of their lifetimes, the First World War, is unfolding on the novel’s every page without ever being referenced. Artlessness’s elaboration thus gives us a different way of accounting for the interests that informed the modernist moment: character in fact predominated over form, ignorance over intelligence. But in the high style of the Bloomsbury group, by which modernism is best known, these values appear obviously inverted. My final chapter, “Time Passes: How Bloomsbury Civilized Ignorance,” concludes by alternating between early and late moments in Bloomsbury’s collective career to uncover what became of modernist character. Early expressions of artlessness, such as Strachey’s portrait of the headmaster of Rugby, Dr. Thomas Arnold, in the briefest, most withering, and most personal sketch of Eminent Victorians (1918), have simply grown to exaggerated proportions by the time of Queen Victoria (1921). So total there is Strachey’s tone that all of Queen Victoria becomes an encounter with ignorance, refusing to allow intelligence to penetrate for even a moment. Alternatively, the assertions of old age cast prior achievements in a new light. Through John Maynard Keynes’s 1938 essay “My Early Beliefs,” where he regrets his Cambridge contemporaries’ blithe indifference towards time, Keynes’s efforts in The Economic Consequences of the Peace (1919) can be freshly read not as a send-up of the stupidity that had marred the Paris Peace Conference, but as an attempt instead to force an alternative treatment of time. The graying heads of state have read Europe’s recent past with the complacent quiescence owed to a completed Bildungsroman, and by animating the temporality of what he repeatedly calls “the character of the Peace,” Keynes endeavors to unlearn that assumption. This chapter concludes by considering Virginia Woolf’s To the Lighthouse (1927), a novel that in its pivotal section, “Time Passes,” seems to fragment character in favor of style just as much as contemporary critical accounts of modernism have alleged. Yet I argue that the central figure of “Time Passes” is not Lily Briscoe or Mrs. Ramsay, but Mrs. Bast, the unschooled and ostensibly unimportant housekeeper, whose sole attestation is that she “never knew the family. ” Mrs. Bast, I suggest, is in fact Jacky Bast, the wife of E. M. Forster’s Leonard in Howards End, the clerk whose fatal flirtation with education forms the basis of many charges of modernism’s intellectual elitism. Yet by amending Forster’s story, a coherent concept of character, rooted in ignorance, survives even “Time Passes,” and better still, is responsible for putting it into order. If modernism maintains no interest in alienating the masses, this dissertation ultimately allows us to consider who is meant to read modernist texts, and for what purpose. As critics, I contend, we have potentially long been engaged in overreading modernism. The widespread puzzlement of Women in Love’s every critic is proof alone that it is not intended to reward the intellectual efforts of professional scholars. “Artless” then not only names a particular historical phenomenon, a teleology by which modernism was made, but also supplies a theory of reading practice. For all the intelligence ascribed to Henry James or to the Bloomsbury set, what we witness in James’s revision of “sat,” or in Keynes’s willingness to undermine the certainty of even his own economic forecasts, is an essential effacement of authorial authority. Artlessness finally amounts to a conviction that characters are capable of spelling their own terms, free from even the interference of their authors. The process is obvious, even automatic. Any reader then is capable of seeing artlessness unfold, and of watching the hold of any prior determinant, be it the missteps of one’s own education, or officially sanctioned history, or the novel as a genre, gradually lose its influence. By encountering artless texts, it is the reader of the early modernist novel, irrespective of class or background, who comes to unlearn...|$|R
