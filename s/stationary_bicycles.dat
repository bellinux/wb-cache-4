Usually the amount of useful electrical energy generated or collected is low because neither generators nor batteries are very efficient, and initially power is lost in converting reciprocating muscular power to rotatory force. These problems are surmountable, there are designs to produce up to 120W electrical output for extended time.|$|E

[Purpose] A <b>stationary</b> <b>bicycle</b> {{exercise}} and a treadmill exercise {{were conducted in}} order to determine the effect of these exercises on the balance and walking ability of elderly women. [Subjects and Methods] Twenty-four elderly women aged 65 or older were equally assigned to a <b>stationary</b> <b>bicycle</b> exercise group and a treadmill exercise group, and they performed exercise three times per week for 8 weeks for 20 minutes each time. In order to examine gait, step length and time were measured as parameters of walking ability, and in order to examine dynamic balance, subjects were evaluated with the Berg balance scale (BBS). [Results] After the intervention, step time and step length and BBS significantly increased significantly decreased, in both groups. A comparison of BBS after the intervention between the two groups revealed that the <b>stationary</b> <b>bicycle</b> group showed larger increases than the treadmill group. [Conclusion] The <b>stationary</b> <b>bicycle</b> exercise group and treadmill exercise group showed significant improvements in gait and balance. <b>Stationary</b> <b>bicycle</b> exercise can help to prevent falls by improving the balance of elderly persons...|$|R

50|$|Trainers make it {{possible}} to build bicycle skills and power very efficiently in a highly controlled environment, without the unavoidable interruptions of outdoor riding. For instance, in hill training, instead of being limited to whatever hills are around one's home, one can simulate any size and steepness. Trainers provide better preparation for racing than <b>stationary</b> <b>bicycles.</b> Trainers require better technique than <b>stationary</b> <b>bicycles,</b> and they provide a more realistic-feeling ride. The geometry and resulting body position of a stationary bicycle may be significantly different from a racing bike; of course, if one uses the racing bike itself in an indoor trainer, the body position is nearly identical.|$|E
