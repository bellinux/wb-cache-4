40|$|Abstract. Forest burning, which emits {{large amounts}} of trace gases and {{particulate}} matter into the atmosphere, produces great impacts on air quality and climate change. In this study, the MODIS (Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer) burned area product (MCD 45 A 1) and GlobCover land-cover product were integrated to estimate the forest burned areas in mainland China from 2001 to 2011. The results were compared with the official data from China Forestry Yearbooks and China Forestry <b>Statistical</b> <b>Yearbooks.</b> On the national scale, theMCD 45 A 1 data were comparable with the official data. However, great gaps exist between the MCD 45 A 1 -derived provincial and regional forest burned areas and the corresponding values from the Forestry <b>Statistical</b> <b>Yearbooks.</b> In particular, the MCD 45 A 1 -derived areas were higher than the Forestry <b>Statistical</b> <b>Yearbooks</b> in north-east China and significantly lower in south-west China. Moreover, it was indicated that the MCD 45 A 1 algorithm was unsuitable for retrieving the burned areas of small forest fires. Nevertheless, the MCD 45 A 1 exhibited excellent performance in retrieving seasonal patterns of forest fire, with high fire occurrence in spring and autumn. On balance, more studies are required to assess and improve the MCD 45 A 1 product and more precise data on forest burned areas in China are urgently needed...|$|R
