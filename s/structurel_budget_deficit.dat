The result showed a significant causal relationship from <b>budget</b> <b>deficit</b> to inflation while the causal relationship from inflation to <b>budget</b> <b>deficit</b> was insignificant.

For example, studies by Shabbir and Ahmed (1994) reveal {{a positive and}} significant relationship between <b>budget</b> <b>deficits</b> and inflation, and an indirect relationship between <b>budget</b> <b>deficits</b> and money supply. They further argue that inflation is not only linked to <b>budget</b> <b>deficits,</b> but that the deficit is primarily funded through bank borrowing and ultimately seigniorage. However, findings by Mukhtar and Zakaria (2010) reveal a different picture for Pakistan; they do not find significant long-run connection between inflation and <b>budget</b> <b>deficits.</b> Instead, inflation {{is related to the}} money supply, yet no causal relationship is found between <b>budget</b> <b>deficits</b> and money supply. In Tanzania, Ndanshau (2012) find no causal effect from <b>budget</b> <b>deficits</b> upon inflation; instead, Granger causality is observed running from inflation to <b>budget</b> <b>deficits.</b> On the other hand, in Nigeria, Oladipo and Akimbobola (2011) find a unidirectional causation running from <b>budget</b> <b>deficits</b> to inflation.|$|R
