[...] "Treated to refusal" [...] means that the manufacturer forces preservatives into the wood, until it refuses to accept more, but performance is not guaranteed.Some of these were still in service after 80 years. The building of pole lines was resisted in some urban areas in the late 19th century, and political pressure for undergrounding remains powerful in many countries.|$|E

40|$|The {{harvesting}} of Mozambique tropical hardwood {{species is}} considerable {{higher than the}} natural regrowth in the forest and the stock is decreasing drastically. Therefore, {{it is important to}} improve the material recovery when the wood is refined (i. e., in sawing and further refinement to products such as joineries, furniture etc.) to reduce the waste and to re-utilize efficiently the by-products to increase the added value. The wood processing industry is an important means to boost the industries in the rural areas and also to generate incomes for the local communities by creating jobs and business opportunities. The majority of the logging {{that can be used for}} sawmilling in Mozambique is exported as roundwood due to the inability of companies to meet the product standards set for export and to generate profit. The lack of capabilities of the local sawmills to generate profit, also foments the illegal logging because of the higher price of roundwood for export which contributes to increase the number of unlicensed individuals in harvesting. This threatens the law enforcement and thus the degradation of the local wood industry. An alternative to increase the profit and empower the local community could be to export more refined wood products such as sawn timber, parquet, and veneer instead of the roundwood. The objective of the work was to investigate alternative sawing strategies of tropical hardwood species that could increase the profitability of the Mozambique wood industry in general and at sawmill in particular. The subject was approached using a database of virtual logs and together with a sawing simulator. The thesis has two main focus areas: (1) creating the log database with the corresponding algorithms for sawing simulation, and (2) investigations of alternative sawing strategies. The first focus was to build the database of surface-scanned logs and develop the algorithm for the saw simulation. The results are a database of 15 logs models describing the logs outer shape in which 10 jambirre (Millettia stuhlmannii Taub.) and 5 umbila (Pterocarpus angolensis DC.), and the algorithm for the sawing simulation. The algorithm use “brute force” i. e., determines all volume yields of sawn timber from the combination of all settings of log-positioning parameters (offset, skew and rotation) and selects the maximum value of volume yield. From simulation, using three sawing patterns (cant-sawing, through-and-through sawing and <b>square-sawing)</b> combined with two positioning parameters (offset and rotation) it was found that the sawing pattern has great impact on volume yield and that the <b>square-sawing</b> gave higher yield followed by through-and-through sawing pattern. The second focus was on alternative sawing strategies; having in mind that the optimal volume yield is achieved by aid of computerized production systems and that these resources are not yet in use in Mozambique. Hence, the objective was to find the positioning parameters that can be set manually and improve the volume yield. The result have shown that the rotation is the most affecting parameter followed by offset and skew, and that the volume yield can decrease by between 7. 7 % and 12. 5 % from the optimal positioning when the logs are manually positioned with the knowledge about the optimal log position. In another study, using crook-up or horns-down positioning as alternative to the optimal positioning, the volume yield decreases by between 10 % and 13 % from the optimal positioning. By using bucked logs, the optimal volume yield increased by between 8 % and 13 % in relation to full lengths logs, and the volume yield of bucked logs when using crook up positioning decreases 2 % in relation to optimal positioning of full length logs. It is concluded that there is an unexploited value potential in the wood chain which can be reached using alternative positioning and modern measurement techniques and that the grading of wood will facilitate and improve the sawing process...|$|R
30|$|Information on the {{strength}} distribution of timbers and other wood products seems to have become more important for users and producers after revision of the Japan architectural standard in 1998, which emphasizes the performance requirements of structures. Because {{there is no way}} other than expensive destructive tests to collect strength data, many researchers have proposed many inspecting methods for predicting strength by nondestructive evaluation. The most popular method for structural timber is the mechanical grading method based on the relation between Young's modulus (E) and strength (σ) with some linear regression models. On the other hand, {{it is well known that}} the proof loading test is superior for obtaining information on the lower tail ofσ distribution. If the E distribution of the objective timbers is known approximately, selecting timbers nearest to the projected E values saves timbers for destructive tests. We examined the alternative sampling method using the reported e-σ data sets of Japanese larch <b>square-sawn</b> timber. The simulated results showed that the estimated lower tail of the bending strength distribution by the alternative method was a better approximation of the experimental distribution than that derived from the conventional linear regression model.|$|E
40|$|This work {{describes}} a simulation of {{the removal of}} knots from <b>square-sawn</b> wood and from wood sawn with the star-sawing pattern. The efficiency of the two methods is compared {{according to the length}} of the received boards and the volume exchange. The production of wood free from knots is important since the market demands wood without knots for reasons of both appearance and material properties. The simulation is done with data for trees and logs taken from The Swedish Stem Bank. The data is then used to simulate the sawmill process in a computer program called the Virtual Sawmill. Data related to the received boards are then used in a MATLAB model simulating the cross cutting of knots. The simulation gave a mean knot-free board length of 263 ± 100 mm and a spillage of 15. 9 % when logs with a top diameter of 100 - 370 mm are square sawn. Star sawing simulated for logs with a top diameter exceeding 230 mm gave a mean knot-free board length of 417 ± 321 mm, while the mean length of knot-free boards was 298 ± 122 mm for square sawing when simulating sawing of the same logs. Under these conditions the volume losses for cross cutting is 9 % for star sawing and 13 % for square sawing. This shows that star sawing has a potential for the production of knot-free wood...|$|E
