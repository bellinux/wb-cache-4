40|$|The Savannah River Site F-Tank Farm Closure {{project has}} {{successfully}} performed Mechanical <b>Sludge</b> <b>Removal</b> (MSR) using the Waste on Wheels (WOW) {{system for the}} first time within one of its storage tanks. The WOW system is designed to be relatively mobile with the ability for many components to be redeployed to multiple waste tanks. It is primarily comprised of Submersible Mixer Pumps (SMPs), Submersible Transfer Pumps (STPs), and a mobile control room with a control panel and variable speed drives. In addition, the project is currently preparing another waste tank for MSR utilizing lessons learned from this previous operational activity. These tanks, designated as Tank 6 and Tank 5 respectively, are Type I waste tanks located in F-Tank Farm (FTF) with a capacity of 2, 840 cubic meters (750, 000 gallons) each. The construction of these tanks was completed in 1953, and they were placed into waste storage service in 1959. The tank's primary shell is 23 meters (75 feet) in diameter, and 7. 5 meters (24. 5 feet) in height. Type I tanks have 34 vertically oriented cooling coils and two horizontal cooling coil circuits along the tank floor. Both Tank 5 and Tank 6 received and stored F-PUREX waste during their operating <b>service</b> time before <b>sludge</b> <b>removal</b> was performed. DOE intends to remove from service and operationally close (fill with grout) Tank 5 and Tank 6 and other HLW tanks that do not meet current containment standards. Mechanical <b>Sludge</b> <b>Removal,</b> {{the first step in the}} tank closure process, will be followed by chemical cleaning. After obtaining regulatory approval, the tanks will be isolated and filled with grout for long-term stabilization. Mechanical <b>Sludge</b> <b>Removal</b> operations within Tank 6 removed approximately 75 % of the original 95, 000 liters (25, 000 gallons). This sludge material was transferred in batches to an interim storage tank to prepare for vitrification. This operation consisted of eleven (11) Submersible Mixer Pump(s) mixing campaigns and multiple intraarea transfers utilizing STPs from July 2006 to August 2007. This operation and successful <b>removal</b> of <b>sludge</b> material meets requirement of approximately 19, 000 to 28, 000 liters (5, 000 to 7, 500 gallons) remaining prior to the Chemical Cleaning process. Removal of the last 35 % of sludge was exponentially more difficult, as less and less sludge was available to mobilize and the lighter sludge particles were likely removed during the early mixing campaigns. The removal of the 72, 000 liters (19, 000 gallons) of sludge was challenging due to a number factors. One primary factor was the complex internal cooling coil array within Tank 6 that obstructed mixer discharge jets and impacted the Effective Cleaning Radius (ECR) of the Submersible Mixer Pumps. Minimal access locations into the tank through tank openings (risers) presented a challenge because the available options for equipment locations were very limited. Mechanical <b>Sludge</b> <b>Removal</b> activities using SMPs caused the sludge to migrate to areas of the tank that were outside of the SMP ECR. Various SMP operational strategies were used to address the challenge of moving sludge from remote areas of the tank to the transfer pump. This paper describes in detail the Mechanical <b>Sludge</b> <b>Removal</b> activities and mitigative solutions to cooling coil obstructions and other challenges. The performance of the WOW system and SMP operational strategies were evaluated and the resulting lessons learned are described for application to future Mechanical <b>Sludge</b> <b>Removal</b> operations...|$|R

The models and calculations were based on prototypic tank geometry and expected normal operating conditions as defined by Tank Closure Project (TCP) Engineering. Computational {{fluid dynamics}} models of Tank 11 with different operating conditions were developed using the FLUENT(tm) code. The modeling results were used to assess the efficiency of <b>sludge</b> suspension and <b>removal</b> operations in the 75 -ft tank. The models employed a three-dimensional approach, a two-equation turbulence model, and an approximate representation of flow obstructions. The calculated local velocity was used as a measure of <b>sludge</b> <b>removal</b> and mixing capability. For the simulations, a series of the modeling calculations was performed with indexed pump orientations until an efficient flow pattern near the potential location of the sludge mound was established for <b>sludge</b> <b>removal.</b> The calculated results demonstrated that the existing slurry pumps running at 1600 rpm could remove the sludge mound from the tank with a 103 in. liquid level, based on a minimum sludge suspension velocity of 2. 27 ft/sec.

40|$|Computational fluid {{dynamics}} {{methods have been}} used to develop and provide slurry pump operational guidance for <b>sludge</b> heel <b>removal</b> in Tank 5. Flow patterns calculated by the model were used to evaluate the performance of various combinations of operating pumps and their orientation under steady-state indexed and transient oscillation modes. A model used for previous analyses has been updated to add the valve housing distribution piping and pipe clusters of the cooling coil supply system near pump no. 8 to the previous tank Type-I model. In addition, the updated model included twelve concrete support columns. This model would provide a more accurate assessment of <b>sludge</b> <b>removal</b> capabilities. The model focused on <b>removal</b> of the <b>sludge</b> heel located near the wall of Tank 5 using the two new slurry pumps. The models and calculations were based on prototypic tank geometry and expected normal operating conditions as defined by Tank Closure Project Engineering. Computational {{fluid dynamics}} models of Tank 5 with different operating conditions were developed using the FLUENT (trademark) code. The modeling results were used to assess the efficiency of <b>sludge</b> suspension and <b>removal</b> operations in the 75 -ft tank. The models employed a three-dimensional approach, a two-equation turbulence model, and an approximate representation of flow obstructions. The calculated local velocity was used as a measure of <b>sludge</b> <b>removal</b> and mixing capability. For the simulations, modeling calculations were performed with indexed pump orientations until an optimum flow pattern near the potential location of the sludge heel was established for <b>sludge</b> <b>removal.</b> The calculated results demonstrated that the existing slurry pumps running at 3801 gpm flowrate per nozzle could remove the sludge from the tank with a 101 in liquid level, based on a historical minimum sludge suspension velocity of 2. 27 ft/sec. The only exception is the region within maximum 4. 5 ft distance from the tank wall boundary at the we st corner of the tank. Further results showed that the capabilities of <b>sludge</b> <b>removal</b> were affected by the presence of twelve concrete support columns, the indexed pump orientation, the number of operating pumps, and the pump flowrate. The major impact of the results for the presence of the 2 -ft support columns is that the sludge cleaning distance is reduced by about 1. 5 ft, compared to the model with no support columns. However, the impact of the cleaning distance for the presence of 2 -in cooling coil pipe clusters near the pump nozzle is found to be negligible. Sensitivity results showed that for a given tank level and pump location, a higher pump flowrate would result in better performance in suspending and removing the sludge.

40|$|A {{mathematical}} model {{is used to}} investigate the role of sedimentation and remineralization in the sediment on nitrogen (N) dynamics in intensive shrimp culture ponds. The model describes the key processes involved in N cycling that underpin the dynamics of total ammoniacal N (TAN), nitrate/nitrite (NOX) and chlorophyll a (CHL) concentrations and the sediment N pool. These parameters may, in high concentrations, impact negatively on the shrimp or the adjacent aquatic environment when water is discharged from ponds. The model was calibrated for an Australian commercial shrimp (Penaeus monodon) pond. Most N enters the pond system as TAN from shrimp excretion of dietary N and decomposition of wasted feed, and is subsequently taken up by phytoplankton, which, on senescence, is sedimented and remineralized. Sediment remineralization is the dominant source of TAN {{in the water column}} for all but the beginning of the production cycle. The remineralization rate of sedimented N was estimated at 6 % day- 1. Nonetheless, sediment acts as a net sink of N throughout the production cycle. The effect of management strategies, including increased stocking densities, water exchange and <b>sludge</b> (=sedimented material) <b>removal,</b> on water quality was examined. Model outputs show that using current shrimp farming techniques, with water exchange rates of 7 % day- 1, an increase in stocking densities above 60 animals m- 2 would result in unacceptably high TAN concentrations. Both <b>sludge</b> <b>removal</b> and water exchange provide effective ways of reducing TAN and NOX concentrations and may allow substantially higher stocking densities. However, <b>sludge</b> <b>removal</b> may be the more acceptable option, given the need to meet strict regulatory requirements for discharge loads in some countries and the desire to reduce water intake to improve biosecurity.

A previously developed direct hollow fiber liquid phase microextraction method was applied to water as well as sludge samples collected from the primary, secondary and tertiary treatment respectively and the final analysis was performed by liquid chromatography quadropole time of flight tandem mass spectrometry. Enrichment factors ranged from 1400 to 3900 times depending on analyte and matrix. Method detection limits ranged from 0. 3 to 14 ng/L for the different analytes and matrices. The overall <b>sludge</b> <b>removal</b> was 9 %, 3 %, 13 % and 1 % for ketoprofen, naproxen, diclofenac and ibuprofen respectively, thus indicating that of the studied compounds, ketoprofen and diclofenac to the largest extent partition into the sludge.

For naproxen and ibuprofen, the largest fraction were {{on the other hand}} detected in primary and tertiary sludge respectively, indicating that the affinity to the different sludge types might vary among the four drugs. The overall low <b>sludge</b> <b>removal</b> confirms existing theories that partitioning into sludge is only a minor removal mechanism for the investigated compounds. Nevertheless, naproxen and ibuprofen are still efficiently removed from the water during treatment (100 % and 97 % total removal respectively) suggesting that these compounds are highly susceptible to biodegradation while ketoprofen and diclofenac (66 % and 67 % total removal respectively) appear more persistent. </p...|$|R

In Tank 6 F, SRR estimated a sludge heel of 5, 984 gallons remained after mechanical <b>sludge</b> <b>removal.</b> To remove this sludge heel, SRR performed chemical cleaning. The chemical cleaning included two oxalic acid strikes, a spray wash, and a water wash. SRR conducted the first oxalic acid strike as follows. Personnel added 110, 830 gallons of 8 wt % oxalic acid to Tank 6 F and mixed the contents of Tank 6 F with two submersible mixer pumps (SMPs) for approximately four days. Following the mixing, they transferred 115, 903 gallons of Tank 6 F material to Tank 7 F. The SMPs were operating when the transfer started and were shut down approximately five hours after the transfer started. SRR collected a sample of the liquid from Tank 6 F and submitted it to SRNL for analysis. Mapping of the tank following the transfer indicated that 2, 400 gallons of solids remained in the tank. SRR conducted the second oxalic acid strike as follows. Personnel added 28, 881 gallons of 8 wt % oxalic acid to Tank 6 F. Following the acid addition, they visually inspected the tank and transferred 32, 247 gallons of Tank 6 F material to Tank 7 F. SRR collected a sample of the liquid from Tank 6 F and submitted it to SRNL for analysis. Mapping of the tank following the transfer indicated that 3, 248 gallons of solids remained in the tank. Following the oxalic acid strikes, SRR performed Spray Washing with oxalic acid to remove waste collected on internal structures, cooling coils, tank top internals, and tank walls. The Acid Spray Wash was followed by a Water Spray Wash to remove oxalic acid from the tank internals. SRR conducted the Spray Wash as follows. Personnel added 4, 802 gallons of 8 wt % oxalic acid to Tank 6 F through the spray mast installed in Riser 2, added 4, 875 gallons of oxalic acid through Riser 7, added 5, 000 gallons of deionized water into the tank via Riser 2, and 5, 000 gallons of deionized water into the tank via Riser 7.
