40|$|The {{effects of}} wheat starch {{components}} on the filtration characteristics of wheat <b>starch</b> <b>hydrolysates</b> were investigated with a model-based approach. The filtration rate was {{not affected by}} {{the removal of the}} pentosans or by altering the conformation of the protein. On the other hand, the filtration rate increased when a hydrolysate was defatted with chloroform or butanol. Some commercially available enzymes also increased the filtration rate. The filtration rate of potato <b>starch</b> <b>hydrolysates</b> decreased when gluten, pentosans, solubles, or propanol extract from defatted wheat starch were added. The latter had by far the largest effect. The composition of this extract was 65 % lipid and 11 % protein. The main lipid in wheat starch is lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC). This single-chain lipid forms micelles above a concentration of 0. 025 g/kg. The filtration rate decreased when LPC was added to potato <b>starch</b> <b>hydrolysates</b> or glucose solutions at concentrations above the critical micelle concentration. This effect of LPC on glucose solutions proves that the filtration characteristics are not related to the formation of amylose-lipid complexes. Therefore, micelle formation must be responsible for the effect of LPC on the filtration rate. The critical micelle concentration is only 2. 5 % of the amount of lysophospholipids in wheat <b>starch</b> <b>hydrolysates.</b> Thus, almost all of these lipids have to be removed from wheat <b>starch</b> <b>hydrolysates</b> to increase the filtration rate...|$|R

50|$|Utilization of {{wastewater}} as {{a potential}} substrate for biohydrogen production has been drawing considerable interest in recent years especially in the dark fermentation process. Industrial wastewater as a fermentative substrate for H2 production addresses most of the criteria required for substrate selection viz., availability, cost and biodegradability (Angenent, et al., 2004; Kapdan and Kargi, 2006). Chemical wastewater (Venkata Mohan, et al., 2007a,b), cattle wastewater (Tang, et al., 2008), dairy process wastewater (Venkata Mohan, et al. 2007c, Rai et al. 2012), <b>starch</b> <b>hydrolysate</b> wastewater (Chen, et al., 2008) and designed synthetic wastewater (Venkata Mohan, et al., 2007a, 2008b) {{have been reported to}} produce biohydrogen apart from wastewater treatment from dark fermentation processes using selectively enriched mixed cultures under acidophilic conditions. Various wastewaters viz., paper mill wastewater (Idania, et al., 2005), starch effluent (Zhang, et al., 2003), food processing wastewater (Shin et al., 2004, van Ginkel, et al., 2005), domestic wastewater (Shin, et al., 2004, 2008e), rice winery wastewater (Yu et al., 2002), distillery and molasses based wastewater (Ren, et al., 2007, Venkata Mohan, et al., 2008a), wheat straw wastes (Fan, et al., 2006) and palm oil mill wastewater (Vijayaraghavan and Ahmed, 2006) have been studied as fermentable substrates for H2 production along with wastewater treatment. Using wastewater as a fermentable substrate facilitates both wastewater treatment apart from H2 production. The efficiency of the dark fermentative H2 production process was found to depend on pre-treatment of the mixed consortia used as a biocatalyst, operating pH, and organic loading rate apart from wastewater characteristics (Venkata Mohan, et al., 2007d, 2008c, d, Vijaya Bhaskar, et al., 2008d).|$|E

The {{purpose of this study}} was to adopt a novel mixed-sugar strategy for maximizing pullulan production, mainly using potato <b>starch</b> <b>hydrolysate</b> as a low-cost substrate for liquid-state fermentation by Aureobasidium pullulans. Based on fermentation kinetics evaluation of pullulan production by A. pullulans 201253, the pullulan production rate of A. pullulans with mixtures of potato <b>starch</b> <b>hydrolysate</b> and sucrose (potato starch hydrolysate:sucrose = 80 : 20) was 0. 212 h− 1, which was significantly higher than those of potato <b>starch</b> <b>hydrolysate</b> alone (0. 146 h− 1) and mixtures of potato <b>starch</b> <b>hydrolysate,</b> glucose, and fructose (potato starch hydrolysate:glucose:fructose = 80 : 10 : 10, 0. 166 h− 1) with 100 g L− 1 total carbon source. The results suggest that mixtures of potato <b>starch</b> <b>hydrolysate</b> and sucrose could promote pullulan synthesis and possibly that a small amount of sucrose stimulated the enzyme responsible for pullulan synthesis and promoted effective potato <b>starch</b> <b>hydrolysate</b> conversion effectively. Thus, mixed sugars in potato <b>starch</b> <b>hydrolysate</b> and sucrose fermentation might be a promising alternative for the economical production of pullulan...|$|E

40|$|The {{faba bean}} (Vicia faba L.) is an {{economical}} protein source used {{in food and}} feed worldwide. It has high protein content and well-balanced amino acid composition. Since the starch fraction of faba beans causes problems in protein gelation, it hinders the use of whole faba beans for tofu production. Due to economical, ecological and nutritional reasons, it is worthwhile {{to develop a new}} way for producing whole faba bean tofu without discarding any part of faba beans. The aim of this thesis work was to produce whole faba bean glucono- -lactone (GDL) tofu by the starch amylolysis treatment and to study the impact of <b>starch</b> <b>hydrolysate</b> on faba bean tofu properties. This research investigated the changes in faba bean emulsion and emulsion gel properties with or without the <b>starch</b> <b>hydrolysate.</b> The pH and soluble protein content of faba bean suspensions with different GDL concentrations were measured. The microstructure, particle size distribution and viscosity of faba bean emulsions were studied. Moreover, the rheological and textural properties, microstructure, water holding capacity and total solid content of faba bean emulsion gels (GDL tofu) were also investigated. In addition, the contribution of different protein-protein interactive forces to the maintenance of faba bean emulsion gels was evaluated by comparing the protein resolubilization extent of the gels immersed in different reagents. Whole faba bean GDL tofu was prepared by the starch amylolysis treatment, emulsification and gelation processes. The <b>starch</b> <b>hydrolysate</b> containing faba bean emulsion gel was less elastic and more viscous than the starch-free gel. The presence of the <b>starch</b> <b>hydrolysate</b> increased the pH and viscosity of faba bean emulsions, which resulted in weakened protein-protein interactions. The <b>starch</b> <b>hydrolysate</b> significantly reduced the contribution of disulfide bonds to the maintenance of faba bean gel networks, but it increased the contribution of non-covalent interactions. In addition, the microstructure of the <b>starch</b> <b>hydrolysate</b> containing faba bean emulsion gel was not as fine and uniform as that of the starch-free gel. The presence of the <b>starch</b> <b>hydrolysate</b> lowered the water holding capacity and decreased the gel strength of faba bean tofu. All in all, the quality of the whole faba bean GDL tofu containing the <b>starch</b> <b>hydrolysate</b> was not comparable to that of the starch-free faba bean tofu, and further improvements are still required to improve its quality...|$|E

Mutants resistant to s- 2 -aminoethyle L-cystein (AEC) and showing auxotrophy for L-homoserine were screened for lysine production qualitatively and quantitatively. A mutant showing highest production of lysine (8. 2 mg/mL) was selected for optimization of physical and nutritional parameters for maximum production of lysine in shake flask. An initial pH 7. 6, 30 ˚C temperature, 300 rpm and 60 h incubation time were the optimized values of physical requirements. Cane molasses and corn <b>starch</b> <b>hydrolysate</b> were required at 15 % (w/v) in the fermentation media which provided around 9 % total sugars to produce maximum lysine (17 to 18 mg/mL).
