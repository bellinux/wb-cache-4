40|$|Nest {{predation}} is {{the primary}} factor influencing grassland songbird reproductive success. Understanding factors driving spatial and temporal variation in nest survival requires that we identify the primary nest predators and factors influencing predator abundance and behavior. Predation events are rarely witnessed, and the identification of nest predators is inferred, often incorrectly, from nest remains or observations of potential predators. We used video photography to identify predators of Sprague 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Pipit</b> (Anthus spragueii) nests in Saskatchewan and Montana. We monitored 60 nests in Saskatchewan and 11 nests in Montana and documented at least ten different species preying upon eggs and nestlings. Northern Harrier (Circus cyaneus) and thirteen-lined ground squirrel (Ictidomys tridecemlineatus) were the most common nest predators documented on videotape, along with mouse (Peromyscus spp.), vole (Microtus spp.), deer (Odocoileus spp.), striped skunk (Mephitis mephitis), coyote (Canis latrans), Black-billed Magpie (Pica hudsonia), Western Meadowlark (Sturnella neglecta), and gartersnake (Thamnophis spp.). Most predation events occurred during the nestling stage and primarily during the day, potentially due to the increased activity of adults feeding young and of the nestlings begging for food. The diverse predator communities documented destroying grassland songbird nests presents many challenges for land managers attempting to increase reproductive success of Sprague 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Pipits</b> and other priority grassland birds...|$|R

40|$|There are no published, {{long-term}} {{accounts of}} responses of grassland passerine birds to {{the restoration of}} northern mixed-grass prairie through combined use of fire and grazing. During 1979 - 2001, we assessed abundance of passerine birds (9 grassland species and 1 shrub-associate species) on 2 brush-invaded, mixed-grass prairie tracts at Lostwood National Wildlife Refuge in northwestern North Dakota. Each tract encompassed 90 ha (220 ac) that were being restored through 4 prescribed fires then 3 consecutive years of grazing by cattle. Fires were separated by 2 - 4 years of rest (i. e., nondisturbance) and grazing was initiated 2 years after the last fire. Among 3 initially common species of passerines, abundance of Savannah sparrow (Passerculus sandwichensis) changed little {{from the beginning to}} end of the burn-graze sequence, but numbers of common yellowthroat (Geothlypis trichas) and clay-colored sparrow (Spizella pallida) declined. Six species of passerines, including the endemic Sprague 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>pipit</b> (Anthus spragueii) and Baird 2 ̆ 7 s sparrow (Ammodramus bairdii), were absent or rare before restoration began but increased after burning occurred. Increases in abundance were most evident during rest years after the third and fourth burns, particularly for grasshopper sparrow (A. savannarum) and Baird 2 ̆ 7 s sparrow. Almost no increases occurred after the first burn. Changed abundances coincided with a shift from shrub-dominated to grass-dominated vegetation along with a decrease in vegetation structure; grass cover increased from 45...|$|R
40|$|In January of 1986 my brother, Ed M.

Our efforts had yielded such birds as Bean Goose, Green-tailed Towhee, Black-necked Stilt, Red Phalarope, Lewis 2 ̆ 7 Woodpecker, Sprague 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Pipit,</b> Cassin 2 ̆ 7 s Finch, Cassin 2 ̆ 7 s Kingbird, and King Eider. When 1985 ended, my Nebraska life list stood at 290 and I had seen 237 species in the state for the year, without any real attempt to see migrant songbirds.... In summary, I found all of the 197 birds I had given a Code 1, and 53 of the 54 Code 2 species (missed Hermit Thrush). Of the 40 birds I had given a Code 3 I had found 26. Included in my total were 12 Code 4 birds and 3 Code 5 species. Each species counted in the total had at least one witness or was documented with a photograph.... All in all, 1986 was a great year for birding and I had a fun time playing the game. One always thinks about the species he missed, but I know I 2 ̆ 7 ll remember for life some that I found. It was a year I learned {{a great deal about the}} birds of Nebraska, and about Nebraska as a whole.

40|$|Purpose ߭chitin hydrogel/nZnO {{composite}} bandage was fabricated {{and evaluated}} in detail {{as an alternative}} to existing bandages. Methods ߭chitin hydrogel was synthesized by dissolving ߭chitin powder in Methanol/CaCl 2 solvent, followed by the addition of distilled water. ZnO nanoparticles were added to the ߭chitin hydrogel and stirred for homogenized distribution. The resultant slurry was frozen at 0 àfor 12 h. The frozen samples were lyophilized for 24 h to obtain porous composite bandages. Results The bandages showed controlled swelling and degradation. The composite bandages showed blood clotting ability as well as platelet activation, which was higher when compared to the control. The antibacterial activity of the bandages were proven against Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and Escherichia coli (E. coli). Cytocompatibility of the composite bandages were assessed using human dermal fibroblast cells (HDF) and these cells on the composite bandages were viable similar to the Kaltostat control bandages and bare ߭chitin hydrogel based bandages. The viability was reduced to 50 - 60 % in bandages with higher concentration of zinc oxide nanoparticles (nZnO) and showed 80 - 90 % viability with lower concentration of nZnO.

40|$|Background: Novel {{preclinical}} {{models for}} prediction of osteoarthritis-like pain {{are necessary for}} the elucidation of osteoarthritis (OA) pathology and for assessment of novel analgesics. A widely used behavioral test in rat models of tibiofemoral OA is hind limb weight bearing (WB). However, this method evaluates WB in an unnaturally restricted manner. The {{aim of this study}} was therefore to characterize the Tekscan Pressure Measurement System as a means to assess OA-like tibiofemoral pain in rats by determination of plantar pressure distribution in a more natural and unrestricted position, defined as unrestricted WB. Methods: Intra-articular injections of 1 mg monosodium iodoacetate (MIA) or saline were administrated in the left hind knee of 84 male <b>Sprague</b> Dawley rat <b>s.</b> Changes in unrestricted WB between ipsilateral and contralateral hindlimbs were determined. Morphine (5 mg/kg administered subcutaneously) and naproxen (60 mg/kg per-oral) were examined for their ability to reverse WB changes. Results: Changes in hind limb unrestricted WB were observed 14 (P P P Conclusion: This study indicated that unrestricted WB assessed by the Tekscan system can be utilized as a clinically relevant method to assess aberrations in WB induced by intra-articular MIA injections in rodents. Therefore, this system may be useful for understanding the mechanisms of OA pain in humans and may also assist in the discovery of novel pharmacological agents. </span...|$|R
40|$|As UAV {{capabilities}} {{continue to}} improve the technology will spill {{out of the military}} sector and into commercial and civil applications. Already, UAVs have demonstrated commercial marketability in such diverse areas as scientific and environmental research, cross-seas shipping, communications relays, emergency management, border monitoring, agriculture, and aerial photography. Small-scale tactical UAVs in particular have an enormous potential to fulfill a number of roles within urban centers, transforming the way civil safety institutions carry out their jobs. A lack of established flight regulations is currently the greatest barrier to the standardized use of these vehicles. While the United States is currently the world's leader in UAV manufacturing, this position is tenuous given strong competitive threats from a variety of foreign countries who are already ahead in establishing a standardized regulatory environment for UAVs. As part of a larger research effort focused on the design, implementation, and demonstration of highly maneuverable rotorcraft UAVs, the primary objective of this work is to examine how UAVs might gain access to and function safely in civil and commercial markets. Despite the wide variety of existing UAVs in terms of size, targeted flight altitude, and capability, this work focuses primarily on small-scale tactical vehicles with the intended purpose of operating in and around urban centers. Operational requirements and risk mitigation strategies can be devised and effectively implemented to allow such UAVs to be operated at an acceptable level of risk. By combining GIS data manipulation with modem approaches to path-planning, UAVs can be operated such that the risk to the general public and urban infrastructure isminimized. Instead of focusing on vehicle reliability requirements which severely limit present-day experimentation and development of UAVs, efforts which focus on operational strategies allow for applications of the technology to be explored while the systems continue to grow more reliable. Public-private coalitions should expand their efforts beyond high altitude, long endurance UAVs to establish operating regulations for all of the vehicle classifications. The diversity of UAVs should be treated with an equally diverse set of regulations tuned to the particular requirements and risk management issues each classification represents. Finally, local and national government should recognize civil UAVs not only as a new commercial industry of great potential, but also as a latent threat to domestic security for which regulations should be established sooner rather than later. by Kara Lynn <b>Sprague.</b> Thesis (<b>S.</b> M.)
