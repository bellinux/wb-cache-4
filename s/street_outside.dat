5|$|The Foundation Stone of the Monument to the Early Founders of Singapore, {{usually called}} the Early Founders Memorial Stone is a {{national}} memorial that {{is dedicated to the}} early founders ("Unknown Immigrants") of Singapore. The original idea was raised by a graduates' association and an open design competition was held for the memorial project. The foundation stone was initially erected along Collyer Quay <b>Street</b> <b>outside</b> the Fullerton Hotel in 1970. After a series of setbacks and delays, the project was finally scrapped after no worthy design was accepted, which resulted the foundation stone becoming the memorial afterwards. In 2000, the memorial was relocated to the National Archives of Singapore at Canning Rise before moving back to the grounds of The Fullerton Hotel in 2010.|$|E

At about 9:40am, Granada Studios on Quay Street received a telephone call claiming that there was a bomb at the corner of Corporation Street and Cannon Street and that it would explode in one hour.

5|$|The {{bombing was}} planned and {{performed}} by two Vietcong agents who escaped uninjured and were never captured. Nguyen Thanh Xuan recollected his involvement to historian Stanley Karnow {{after the war}} had ended. In late-November, Xuan and his comrade received orders from a Vietcong intermediary to bomb the Brinks Hotel. The building housed United States Army officers, including lieutenant colonels and majors, and attracted off-duty personnel with its highly regarded food and drink, rooftop seating areas and movie screenings. It was a six-story building and had 193bedrooms. The Vietcong duo observed their target over the next month, mixing with the crowds in the busy <b>street</b> <b>outside.</b> Noting that South Vietnamese officers mingled freely with Americans, they obtained ARVN uniforms from Saigon's black market, enabling them to get closer. Xuan disguised himself as a military chauffeur, while his partner dressed as a South Vietnamese major. They mingled with the real officers {{so that they could}} copy their mannerisms, speaking style and even their way of smoking. The Vietcong pair then procured the two cars and explosives needed for the operation.|$|E
5|$|The {{town council}} (a parish council {{with the status}} of a town) has {{responsibility}} for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council's operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny.

The highway starts as an eight-lane freeway at an interchange on I-75 in Bloomfield Township. The freeway continues past an interchange with Opdyke Road to end at Square Lake Road, dropping to six lanes. BL I-75 continues to M-1 at Woodward Avenue. Square Lake Road continues to the west as Bus. US24, BL I-75 turns northwesterly along the eight-lane divided Woodward Avenue, running concurrently with Bus. US24 into downtown Pontiac. At {{the south side of}} downtown, Woodward drops to six lanes the two directions of Woodward Avenue split and form a four-lane loop. The Woodward Avenue Loop encircles downtown Pontiac, and it is crossed by the eastbound direction of M-59 running on Huron Street. One block north, the westbound direction of M-59 runs along University Drive and turns to follow BL I-75/Bus. US24 (Woodward Avenue Loop). The loop intersects Perry Street another block further north, and BL I-75 turns northeasterly onto the two-way Perry Street. BL I-75 passes through residential areas and a minor business area along the four-lane Perry <b>Street.</b> <b>Outside</b> of the downtown area, Perry Street widens to include a center turn lane.

Lapeer Road continues as a six-lane, divided roadway to the ramps of a double trumpet interchange, where the BL I-75 designation ends. The roadway however, continues as M-24 providing access to the Palace of Auburn Hills. On average each day in 2013, 9,829vehicles use the business loop between the two M-59 junctions, and 73,795vehicles do so on the freeway stub east of Opdyke Road, the lowest and highest traffic counts.|$|E
