40|$|This paper {{describes}} an inexpensive force-plate that can measure ground reaction forces in two planes {{and can be}} built to a size or sensitivity suitable for nearly any biological application. An ideal force-plate should: (1) be able to resolve the vertical, forward and lateral components of the force; (2) have low 'crosstalk ' between the measured components of the force; (3) have sufficient sensitivity and resolution for the subject of interest; (4) have a linear response; (5) have a response independent of where on the plate surface the force is exerted; (6) have a high natural frequency of oscillation; (7) have sufficient safety margin to protect both the plate and the subject from damage due to failure; and (8) be simple and inexpensive. Many plates have been described in the literature (e. g. Calow & Alexander (1973), Cavagna (1975), and Gola (1980)), but all are lacking in {{two or more of}} the above criteria. The suggested design is lacking only in criterion 1 : it is sensitive only to the vertical and forward-aft horizontal components of the force. The suggested design (Fig. 1 A) is simply a rigid plate surface suspended at each corner by a transducer element. The transducer element (Fig. iB) is composed of two strain-gauge instrumented spring blades orientated at 90 Â° to each other; the horizontal blade is sensitive to the vertical force, and the vertical blade is sensitive to the horizontal force. The four blades supporting each end of the plate surface are cut out of one solid bar. Each <b>spring</b> <b>blade</b> is modelled as if it were two identical cantilevered beams joined at their distal ends (Fig. iC). The standard formula for beam flexure is: S = Me /I, where S is the stress on any fibre (Nm~ 2), c is the distance from the fibre to the neutral axis (m), M is the bending moment (Nm), and / is the moment of inertia with respect to the neutral axis (m 4). For a cantilever with the load concentrated at the distal end / = bh 3 / 12, where b is the width and h is the height of the beam(m); c = h/z; and M = PI, where P is the load (N) and / is the length of the beam (m).

5000|$|Several {{stories about}} the {{circumstances}} of her death at age 67 in 1796 probably originated soon after. A common story claims that she {{died as a result}} of her voracious sexual appetite while attempting sexual intercourse with a stallionâthe story holds that the harness holding the horse above her broke, and she was crushed. This story took root after her servants reported her visits to the stalls of Arabian stallions for long hours without supervision. Another story claiming that she died on the toilet when her seat broke under her is true only in small part: she did collapse in a bathroom from a stroke, but after that she died while being cared for in her bed. This tale was widely circulated and even jokingly referred to by Aleksandr Pushkin in one of his untitled poems.

40|$|The LIGO (Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory) {{project is}} {{designed}} to detect gravitational waves using precision interferometry. The detection from astrophysical sources {{has the potential to}} test Einstein's Theory of General Relativity, and additionally open a new window into the universe and its origin. The Initial LIGO detectors are currently operating at a strain sensitivity of 10 - 21 Hz, or equivalently 1018 m/ [square root of] Hz, at 100 Hz. In order to attain improved sensitivity required for guaranteed detection of astrophysical sources, e. g. coalescing neutron star binaries and black holes, pulsars, and supernovae collapses, improvements of the strain sensitivity must be achieved. Next generation detectors such as Advanced LIGO are under development, which aims to improve the sensitivity by more than a factor of 10 at all frequencies, compared to initial LIGO. This improvement in sensitivity will be achieved in part by improved seismic isolation one component of which is an active vibration isolation platform. Currently, research and development is being conducted at MIT on a prototype of this vibration isolation system. The work described in this thesis focuses on the Internal Seismic Isolation (ISI) system under development for Advanced LIGO. (cont.) This system consists of a three-stage in-vacuum seismic isolation system which is supported by an external hydraulic actuation stage known as the Hydraulic External Pre-Isolation (HEPI) stages of the active vibration control system. HEPI uses forces generated by hydraulic pressure to cancel low frequency seismic noise, primarily due to forces from ground vibration. The ISI is an actively controlled platform, in which each stage is supported by three maraging steel <b>blade</b> <b>springs.</b> The vibration is sensed in six degrees of freedom and reduced by applying forces through a control feedback loop. In order for the feedback loop to function properly, {{it is important to know}} and be able to predict the position of the ISI stages to within a few thousandths of an inch. Since the load being applied to the <b>spring</b> <b>blades</b> is known, the compliance of each spring along with various shim thicknesses will determine the final position of the stages. Although compliance is a material and geometric property, and should remain constant from spring to spring, due to imperfections of the fabrication process and variation in the material properties, small variations in the long and short spring compliance value were detected using a Spring Tester. (cont.) The blades were designed based on their resonant frequencies and the load which they would be supporting - more specifically, their geometry (length, width, and thickness) were defined such that the load each supported brought them to a 1 / 3 of their failure stress. For my undergraduate thesis, I determined the compliance of multiple long and short springs was determined using a specially designed apparatus - the "Spring Tester. " Ideally, three <b>blade</b> <b>springs</b> of identical compliance should be used to eliminate system imbalance, but to variation during fabrication may be difficult to achieve Using the Spring Tester the mean values for each set of long and short spring linear compliance data were found to be 0. 729 +. 008 mils/lb and 0. 670 Â±. 027 mils/lb, respectively, while the means for the long and short angular compliance data were 0. 078 +. 001 mrad/lb and 0. 089 Â±. 003 mrad/lb, respectively. by Alexander G.

40|$|Further {{improvements}} in the low frequency sensitivity of gravitational wave detectors are important for increasing the observable population of astrophysical sources, such as intermediate mass compact black hole binary systems. Improvements in the lower stage mirror and suspension systems will set challenging targets for the required thermal noise performance of the cantilever <b>blade</b> <b>springs,</b> which provide vertical softness and, thus, isolation to the mirror suspension stack. This is required due to the coupling between the vertical and horizontal axes due to the curvature of the Earth. This can be achieved through use of high mechanical Q materials, which are compatible with cryogenic cooling, such as crystalline silicon. However, such materials are brittle, posing further challenges for assembly/jointing and, more generally, for long-term robustness. Here, we report on experimental studies of the breaking strength of silicon at room temperature, via both tensile and 4 -point flexural testing; and {{on the effects of}} various surface treatments and coatings on durability and strength. Single- and multi-layer DLC (diamond-like carbon) coatings, together with magnetron-sputtered silica and thermally-grown silica, are investigated, as are the effects of substrate preparation and argon plasma pre-treatment. Application of single- or multi-layer DLC coatings can significantly improve the failure stress of silicon flexures, in addition to improved robustness for handling (assessed through abrasion tests). Improvements of up to 80 % in tensile strength, a twofold increase in flexural strength, in addition to a 6. 4 times reduction in the vertical thermal noise contribution of the suspension stack at 10 Hz are reported (compared to current Advanced LIGO design). The use of silicon <b>blade</b> <b>springs</b> would also significantly reduce potential 'crackling noise' associated with the underlying discrete events associated with plastic deformation in loaded flexures...|$|R
