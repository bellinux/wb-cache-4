2500|$|On September 1, 2017, a {{complaint}} was filed by eight {{current and former}} faculty members of the University of Rochester with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). The complaint includes allegations of sexual misconduct/harassment perpetrated by a current University of Rochester faculty member, and reprisals by the administration of University president Joel Seligman against the complainants. The university responded publicly that the allegations were [...] "thoroughly investigated {{and could not be}} substantiated." [...] The public disclosure of the EEOC filing, and the responses to it from the University administration, resulted in a contentious on-campus Town Hall meeting, an on-campus rally protesting against the responses of the University and Seligman to the allegations of sexual harassment and reprisals made in the EEOC-filed complaint, a student hunger strike, and the University announcing a new investigation into the matter. One <b>senior</b> <b>faculty</b> <b>member</b> of the department, who had served as dean and worked at the University for over 30 years, resigned in protest over the university's handling of the investigation and subsequent retaliation against the complainants.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Given the {{predicted}} shortages of dental {{faculty in the}} United States, {{it is important to}} retain <b>faculty</b> <b>members.</b> Mentor-ing could {{play a crucial role in}} this context. The objectives of this case study were to explore how a six-year mentoring program in the Department of Periodontics and Oral Medicine at the University of Michigan School of Dentistry changed faculty members’ perceptions of support from colleagues and their mentoring expectations. In addition, we sought to determine how junior versus <b>senior</b> <b>faculty</b> <b>members</b> and mentors versus mentees differed in their perceptions of faculty roles, their self-perceived competence, and their awareness of departmental expectations at the end of the program. Data were collected with self-administered surveys from twenty-five of the thirty-six <b>faculty</b> <b>members</b> in this department in 2002 (response rate: 69 percent) and from thirty-seven of the fifty-four <b>faculty</b> <b>members</b> in 2008 (response rate: 69 percent). The results showed that the perceptions of support from colleagues improved significantly over the six-year period. During the same time period, mentoring expectations increased. In 2008, junior <b>faculty</b> <b>members</b> as compared to <b>senior</b> <b>faculty</b> <b>members</b> remained less positive about their role as <b>faculty</b> <b>members,</b> felt less well prepared for their professional life, and were less aware of departmental expectations. In conclusion, a departmental mentoring program resulted in improved support from colleagues and increased expectations concerning mentoring experiences. However, future targeted interventions are needed to address the identified differences between junior and <b>senior</b> <b>faculty</b> mem...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to present {{findings}} of a focus group study used to design a survey instrument for applications in future studies to determine factors of influence that inspire <b>senior</b> <b>faculty</b> <b>members</b> to participate in course delivery through online learning environments (OLE). Much of the general research that is available, identifies concerns such as monetary compensation, and concerns for technological savvy, however these concerns are not true for all <b>faculty</b> <b>members.</b> The differing motivational factors (as they have emerged in the literature) have shown to be related to faculty appointment levels and years of service, which seem to play an important role in identifying how administrators can encourage these seasoned instructors to participate in the online learning environments. The article concludes with discussion points to encourage academic administrators to consider the merits of <b>senior</b> level <b>faculty</b> <b>member</b> inclusion into online learning environment delivery formats...|$|R
