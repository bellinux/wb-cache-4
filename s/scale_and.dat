40|$|Background: Evaluate the {{adjunctive}} use {{of locally}} delivered green tea catechin with <b>scaling</b> <b>and</b> root planing, {{as compared to}} <b>scaling</b> <b>and</b> root planing alone {{in the management of}} chronic periodontitis. Materials and Methods: Fourteen patients with two sites in the contralateral quadrants with probing pocket depth of 5 − 8 mm were selected. Each of the sites was assessed for the plaque index, gingival index, and probing pocket depth at baseline and 21 days and for microbiological analysis at baseline, 1 week and 21 days. Test sites received <b>scaling</b> <b>and</b> root planing along with green tea catechin strips and control sites received <b>scaling</b> <b>and</b> root planning alone. Results: The result showed intercomparison of the plaque index and gingival index for test and control groups at 21 days was not significant with P> 0. 05, whereas the probing depth at 21 days was significant with P< 0. 001. Intercomparison between microbial results demonstrated a considerable reduction of occurrence of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Prevotella intermedia, Fusobacterium species and Capnocytophaga in test.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundLocally {{delivered}} doxycycline {{is found}} to be effective in managing periodontitis as an adjunct to <b>scaling</b> <b>and</b> root planing. AimTo evaluate the effect of locally delivered doxycycline (10 %) with <b>scaling</b> <b>and</b> root planing in the periodontal treatment of smokers and to compare it with <b>scaling</b> <b>and</b> root planing alone. MethodsTwelve smokers with chronic periodontitis and a pocket depth (⩾ 5 mm) on posterior teeth that bleed on probing were selected. Patients were randomly assigned to <b>scaling</b> <b>and</b> root planing (SRP) or <b>scaling</b> <b>and</b> root planing followed by local application of doxycycline (SRP-D). Plaque, bleeding on probing, gingival recession, clinical attachment level (CAL), and probing depth (PD) were recorded at the baseline, 6 and 12 weeks. ResultsBoth groups showed a significant reduction in Plaque, Bleeding on Probing and pocket depth at 6 th and 12 th week from the baseline. A statistically significant gain of attachment was observed in both groups after treatment. Even though the doxycycline group showed slightly higher attachment gain it was not statistically significant compared to the control group. ConclusionThe observations of the study reveal that the additional benefit of topical application of doxycycline as an adjunct to <b>scaling</b> <b>and</b> root planing in smokers is not convincing. However, further clinical studies may be necessary to substantiate the present observations...|$|R
