40|$|The {{integration}} of biomedical sensors with wireless net-work technology may have great potentials in medical ap-plications. In this paper, we investigate {{the use of}} the IEEE 802. 15. 4 standard in an ECG monitoring sensor network and study the effects of CSMA/CA mechanism, number of network devices, sampling rates and transmitting cycles. The performance of the network is analyzed in terms of transmission delay, <b>end</b> <b>to</b> <b>end</b> latency, and packet delivery rate. Both biomedical signal sampling time and transmis-sion delay contribute <b>to</b> the <b>end</b> <b>to</b> <b>end</b> latency, but the <b>end</b> <b>to</b> <b>end</b> latency is mainly introduced by signal sam-pling time, especially for low data rate biomedical sensors. The packet delivery rate increases when the number of pay-load data becomes large due to high channel efficiency and packet coding efficiency, but large size packet suffers high <b>end</b> <b>to</b> <b>end</b> latency. In our case study, for a full size MAC packet with maximum payload size (114 bytes), the aver-age <b>end</b> <b>to</b> <b>end</b> latency introduced by sampling and trans-mitting is about 90 ms. For time-critical applications, a payload size between 40 and 60 bytes can be a good choice, due <b>to</b> lower <b>end</b> <b>to</b> <b>end</b> latency and acceptable packet de-livery rate. In the design and deployment of biomedical sensor networks in time-critical medical care applications, trade-off between <b>end</b> <b>to</b> <b>end</b> latency and packet delivery rate must be considered...|$|R
