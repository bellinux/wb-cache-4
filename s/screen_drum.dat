40|$|The {{rotating}} screen drums are largely used in most powder handling and processing industries. They {{are commonly used}} for size separation of granular materials. Objectives of the present work are to better understand both roles, screening efficiency and shaping effects and to investigate and model which process parameters are relevant when using an inclined rotating <b>screen</b> <b>drum</b> for processing wet couscous agglomerates. Durum wheat semolina was used as raw material to produce the wet agglomerates. The pilot rotating <b>screen</b> <b>drum</b> equipment was composed of two sieves to separate three fractions: fine, medium, and large agglomerates. The shaping effects of the rotating <b>screen</b> <b>drum</b> were evaluated from the measurements of the physico-chemical characteristics (size distribution, water content, compactness, and circularity) on wet soft agglomerates. To describe the screening efficiency parameters of a rotary <b>screen</b> <b>drum,</b> a specific method was developed by using a matrix analysis of the different measured weights of the collected products. The impacts of rotating <b>screen</b> <b>drum</b> parameters (angle of inclination, rotating speed, and product flow rate) on the sieving efficiency and on the shaping effects were investigated. The present results demonstrate high apparent screening efficiency of the rotating <b>screen</b> <b>drum</b> when used with wet agglomerates of durum wheat, ranging between 89 and 96 % depending on the process conditions Finally, using dimensional analysis, two correlations were proposed on the circularity and the apparent screening efficiency whatever the operating conditions used (drum speed, angle of inclination and feed rate) ...|$|E

40|$|Due to {{increasing}} shortage of raw materials, traditionally used for {{production of wood}} based panels and other composite materials, {{there is a growing}} call for the use of raw materials from agricultural production. Hemp shive, a by-product of hemp straw processing, is in eager demand due to its wood-like material properties. In order to be suitable for industrial use, respective agricultural raw material must be competitive in price, as well as be available in respective quantity and quality. ATB has developed a new processing technology for the cleaning of shive-fibre mixes for better accommodation such requirements. Ultimate goal is the generation of dust and fibre free shives as well as the recovering of high quality short fibres from shive fractionation. This is facilitated by a new type of axial fractionators, which utilizes a multi-stage paddle screw and a <b>screen</b> <b>drum,</b> corresponding with the screw. This allows classification and cleaning of the shives as well as recovering of the short fibres in only one processing step. Finished products are widely dust and fibre-free, high value shives; and shive-free short fibres. The shives can be used for the production of particle boards without further preparation. The recovered short fibres are mainly suitable for the use as reinforcing fibres in composite materials due to their short fibre length (< 50 mm).

40|$|The Pacific Northwest National Laboratory {{evaluated}} 19 Phase II screen {{sites in}} the Yakima River Basin {{at least three times}} each between April 30 and August 22, 1997. The sites were examined to determine if they were being effectively operated and maintained to provide fish a safe, efficient return to the river. Data were collected to determine if velocities in front of the screens and in the bypass met current NMFS criteria and promoted timely fish bypass, if fish were protected from injury due to impingement, entrainment, and predation, and whether bypass outfall conditions allowed fish to safely return to the river. A bi-directional flow meter and underwater video system were essential in completing the investigation. In general, water velocity conditions at the screen sites were acceptable by NMFS standards. High approach velocities and slow bypass flow were the most common problems noted. Although velocities often fluctuated from one sampling location to the next, average sweep and approach velocities were very good. In general, fish should not be impinged or experience delays in returning to the river under normal operating conditions. Most screens were properly sealed to prevent fish entrainment and injury, although potential problems were identified at several screen sites. Three sites had gap openings from the forebay to the aftbay, allowing fish to be entrained. Other sites had spaces larger than 3 / 32 inch where small fish could become trapped. Some <b>drum</b> <b>screens</b> had flat spots but these were not been confirmed as underwater gaps, primarily because of siltation. On rare occasions, seals were intact, but cracked or turned under. Submergence levels at the <b>drum</b> <b>screen</b> sites exceeded 85 % for one third of our evaluations. Eight of 12 <b>drum</b> <b>screen</b> sites experienced high water levels during at least one evaluation. Only one operating site's submergence was measured at less than 65 % submergence. Two flat plate screen sites were completely overtopped with water during one evaluation each. Although 1997 was an extreme high-water year, these overtopping events point out that some screens do not completely protect fish under the full range of potential operating conditions. Water depths at the outfall pipe were acceptable at all but four sites. Generally, water depths were low {{near the end of the}} irrigation season due to low river flows. Rock removal around the outfall pipe or pipe extension would improve the situation. We gauged the potential for predation by qualitatively measuring the types and amount of cover provided for predators in front of the screens and by recording random observations of fish large enough to be considered predators in the forebay. Predation was more likely to occur at <b>drum</b> <b>screen</b> sites than at flat plate <b>screen</b> sites. <b>Drum</b> sites provide more predator hiding places because greater amounts of woody debris accumulate under the drums and against the concrete walls that divide one screen bay from the next. Four sites had both woody debris and large fish present. These four sites were considered most likely to experience juvenile salmonid loss to predation. Periodic removal of woody debris from underneath the curvature of <b>drum</b> <b>screens</b> would decrease the likelihood of predation at these sites. Screens were generally well maintained. Automated cleaning brushes functioned properly, chains and other moving parts were well greased, and inoperative and algae-covered <b>drum</b> <b>screens</b> were eventually repaired and cleaned. However, removal of sediment build-up and accumulated woody debris are areas where improvement should be considered. Maintenance checks should include observation of bypass outfalls on a regular basis, as conditions at the end of the bypass pipe are likely to change seasonally, especially in streams with high gradients or unstable gravel. Post-season evaluations were conducted at 11 sites in November to try and confirm seal and <b>drum</b> <b>screen</b> defects, and locations of excessive sedimentation. This proved effective in several cases, but the winterization process eliminated some of the evidence. Several forebay areas had already been cleared of silt. It was difficult to evaluate screens and seals when the screens were in the storage position because the screens could not be rotated. Also, two sites remained in full operation while others were submerged, precluding detailed examination of parts still under water. Periodic, regular screen evaluations will increase the effectiveness of screen operation and maintenance practices by confirming the effectiveness (or ineffectiveness) of screen operating procedures at individual sites. Where procedures are being followed and problems still occur, evaluation results will suggest means to improve the procedures to better protect fish at screening facilities...|$|R

40|$|Outdated {{juvenile}} {{and adult}} fish passage facilities were recently reconstructed at the five major irrigation dams {{on the lower}} Umatilla River, Oregon to meet National marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) design standards. Changes in design at juvenile fish bypass facilities included reduced mesh size on the rotating <b>drum</b> <b>screens,</b> larger screening area, a more oblique orientation of the <b>drum</b> <b>screens</b> to canal flow, improved screen seals, replacement of bypass portals with vertical slot bypass channels, and increased bypass pipe diameters. Weir-and-pool adult fish ladders and jump pools were replaced with vertical-slot ladders. From 1991 [...] 1995, they investigated injury and travel rate of juvenile fish moving through the facilities, and efficiency of screens in preventing fish entry into the canals. Water velocities in front of canal screens, at bypass channel entrances, and at ladder diffusers were measured to assess adherence to NMFS criteria and identify hydraulic patterns. Biological evaluations were conducted by releasing and recapturing marked yearling summer steelhead (Oncorhynchus mykiss), yearling spring chinook salmon (O. tshawytscha), and subyearling fall chinook salmon (O. tshawytscha) in varying locations within the fish passage facilities...|$|R

40|$|The Glenn-Colusa Irrigation District (GCID) diverts up to 3, 000 {{cubic feet}} per second (cfs) from the Sacramento River near Hamilton City, California. A new fish screen at the canal intake was {{constructed}} in 1972. About the same time, changes to the channel of the river resulted in the river degrading more than 3 feet near the intake to the pumping plant. The reduced water depth {{on the face of}} the screen structure causes through screen velocities to increase dramatically. At the present design pumping flow of 2, 800 cfs, the velocity component perpendicular to the screens has doubled the current criteria of 0. 33 feet per second (fps). This and other problems on the existing screens result in the impingement and entrainment of winter-run chinook smolts, which are a listed endangered specie. A range of solutions were considered by GCID and the resource agencies including building a gradient restoration project, changing pumping amounts and schedules, to a new state-of-the-art screen.
