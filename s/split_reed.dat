60|$|There was {{something}} in this sudden gleam of beauty that wonderfully struck {{the imagination of the}} student. It was like a brilliant, flashing from its dark casket. He sauntered about, regarding the gloomy pile with increasing interest. A few simple, wild notes, from among some rocks and trees at a little distance, attracted his attention. He found there a group of Gitanas, a vagabond gipsy race, which at that time abounded in Spain, and lived in hovels and caves of the hills about the neighbourhood of Granada. Some were busy about a fire, and others were listening to the uncouth music which one of their companions, seated on a ledge of the rock, was making with a <b>split</b> <b>reed.</b>|$|E
6000|$|Some of {{the chiefs}} had copper rings of home manufacture, with neatly cut raised figures. The king {{held in his}} right hand an article which at first puzzled us--a foot's length of <b>split</b> <b>reed,</b> with the bulbous root attached. He may not, like his vassals, point with the finger, and without {{pointing}} an African can hardly give an order. Moreover, the Sangálávú or Malaguetta pepper (Amomum granum Paradisi), fresh or old, is not only a toothstick, but a fetish of superior power when carried on journeys. Professor Smith writes [...] "Sangala woo," [...] and tells us that it was always kept fresh in the house, to be rolled in the hands when invoking the Fetish during war-time; moreover, it was chewed to be spat at the enemy. Possibly he confuses it with the use as a tooth-stick, the article which Asia and Africa prefer to the unclean hog's- bristle brush of Europe.|$|E
6000|$|I was let briefly {{into his}} history by Frank Bracebridge. He {{was an old}} {{bachelor}} of a small independent income, which by careful management was sufficient for all his wants. He revolved through the family system like a vagrant comet in its orbit; sometimes visiting one branch, and sometimes another quite remote; {{as is often the}} case with gentlemen of extensive connections and small fortunes in England. He had a chirping, buoyant disposition, always enjoying the present moment; and his frequent change of scene and company prevented his acquiring those rusty unaccommodating habits with which old bachelors are so uncharitably charged. He was a complete family chronicle, being versed in the genealogy, history, and intermarriages of the whole house of Bracebridge, which made him a great favourite with the old folks; he was a beau of all the elder ladies and superannuated spinsters, among whom he was habitually considered rather a young fellow, and he was a master of the revels among the children; so that there was not a more popular being in the sphere in which he moved than Mr. Simon Bracebridge. Of late years he had resided almost entirely with the Squire, to whom he had become a factotum, and whom he particularly delighted by jumping with his humour in respect to old times, and by having a scrap of an old song to suit every occasion. We had presently a specimen of his last mentioned talent; for no sooner was supper removed, and spiced wines and other beverages peculiar to the season introduced, than Master Simon was called on for a good old Christmas song. He bethought himself for a moment, and then, with a sparkle of the eye, and a voice that was by no means bad, excepting that it ran occasionally into a falsetto, like the notes of a <b>split</b> <b>reed,</b> he quavered forth a quaint old ditty: ...|$|E
60|$|Then he {{set to work}} {{to doctor}} my wounds. Well it proved for me that the sleeve of my garment was so thick, for even through it the flesh of my forearm was torn to ribbons, {{moreover}} a bone seemed to be broken. Leo collected a double handful of some soft wet moss and, having washed the arm, wrapped it round with a handkerchief, over which he laid the moss. Then with a second handkerchief and some strips of linen torn from our undergarments he fastened a couple of <b>split</b> <b>reeds</b> to serve as rough splints to the wounded limb. While {{he was doing this}} I suppose that I slept or swooned. At any rate, I remember no more.|$|R

6000|$|... "High-class Somali Arabs," [...] thought I to myself, {{noting the}} while {{that as they}} {{arranged}} the robes they were taking {{in every one of}} us with their quick eyes. One of them shut the door, leaving Savage on this side of it as though they meant him to be present. Then they walked towards us, each of them carrying an ornamental basket made apparently of <b>split</b> <b>reeds,</b> that contained doubtless their conjuring outfit and probably the snake which Savage had found in his pocket. To my surprise they came straight to me, and, having set down the baskets, lifted their hands above their heads, as a person about to dive might do, and bowed till the points of their fingers touched the floor. Next they spoke, not in Arabic as I had expected that they would, but in Bantu, which of course I understood perfectly well.|$|R
50|$|The {{term has}} been erroneously {{supposed}} by some writers {{to be the}} same with the sistrum. These mistakes are refuted at length by Friedrich Adolph Lampe (1683-1729) in De cymbalis veterum. From the Suda and the Scholiast on Aristophanes (Nubes, 260), it {{appears to have been a}} <b>split</b> <b>reed</b> or cane, which clattered when shaken with the hand. According to Eustathius (Il. XI.160), it was made of shell and brass, as well as wood. Clement of Alexandria attributes the instruments invention to the Sicilians, and forbids the use thereof to the Christians, because of the motions and gestures accompanying the practice.|$|E
50|$|Once the {{materials}} are cut, he and the family prepare it though a process of selection and cleaning, generally <b>splitting</b> the <b>reeds</b> and bamboo in two or more lengths. Then they are soaked for over twelve hours and left covered to maintain moisture. Standing at his worktable, he pulls the needed pieces. Thicker ones are used for support, sometimes with cross pieces for larger works. He usually leaves the finished product unpainted but sometimes adds brown blotches by lightly burning certain areas.|$|R
6000|$|One of {{his first}} deeds was to visit a village which was beautifully {{situated}} {{on the banks of}} a small but deep river. In order to avoid alarming the inhabitants, he approached it with only about thirty of his men, twenty of whom were armed. Arrived at the outskirts, he halted his armed men, and advanced with the other ten, calling out cheerfully, [...] "We have things for sale! have you anything to sell?" [...] The chief and his warriors, armed with their bows and arrows and shields, met him, and forbade him to pass within the hedge that encircled the village, but told him to sit down under a tree outside. A mat of <b>split</b> <b>reeds</b> was placed for Marizano to sit on; and when he had explained to the chief that the object of his visit was to trade with him for ivory--in proof of which he pointed to the bales which his men carried,--he was well received, and a great clapping of hands ensued. Presents were then exchanged, and more clapping of hands took place, for this was considered the appropriate ceremony. The chief and his warriors, on sitting down before Marizano and his men, clapped their hands together, and continued slapping on their thighs while handing their presents, or when receiving those of their visitors. It was the African [...] "thank you." [...] To have omitted it would have been considered very bad manners.|$|R
50|$|The {{majority}} {{formed a}} National Left Wing Council {{and attempted to}} arrange a take over of the socialist party's convention. However, by late August the majority decided to forgo this plan and joined with the NOC {{to create a new}} party at a convention in Chicago. A minority, led by Ben Gitlow and John <b>Reed</b> <b>split</b> with the majority and attempted to infiltrate the Socialist Party convention alone.|$|R
50|$|After {{breaking}} {{his arm in}} the 1976-77 season, Thompson missed {{one third of the}} season but still managed 21 goals. The offensively talented winger began to see less ice time under defense-oriented coach Roger Neilson and was eventually traded with various draft picks to the Detroit Red Wings for Dan Maloney and a future 2nd round draft pick on March 13, 1978. With Detroit, Thompson continued to produce, scoring 23 goals his first full season and 34 goals the following season. In 1980, he was named co-captain of the Wings <b>splitting</b> time with <b>Reed</b> Larson. After scoring 26 points in the 1980-81 season he was traded to the Pittsburgh Penguins for Gary McAdam on January 8 and played his final 34 games in Pittsburgh.|$|R
50|$|The {{ceremony}} takes various forms. A {{common practice}} is to stir {{a large pot}} of rice gruel (粥 (kayu)) with a split wooden stick, and to observe the number and organisation of the grains that adhere to the stick when it is removed. In another variation, known as tsutsugayu shinji, multiple hollow cylinders made of <b>split</b> bamboo or <b>reeds</b> are placed in the gruel, each cylinder corresponding to a specific month. Shinto prayers are chanted and the rice porridge is then left overnight. The following morning, the cylinders are cut open and the contents examined - the more rice that has stuck {{to the inside of the}} tube, the more propitious the harvest. If multiple tubes are used, these usually correspond to specific months of the year, and the results are recorded on a month-by-month basis. The tsutsugayu shinji variation is practiced at the Suwa Grand Shrine.|$|R
6000|$|... "Less wretched if less fair." [...] Perhaps a truth [...] Is so far plain in this, that Italy, [...] Long trammelled {{with the}} purple {{of her youth}} [...] Against her age's ripe activity, [...] Sits still upon her tombs, without death's ruth [...] But also without life's brave energy. [...] "Now tell us what is Italy?" [...] men ask: [...] And others answer, [...] "Virgil, Cicero, [...] Catullus, Cæsar." [...] What beside? to task [...] The memory closer--"Why, Boccaccio, [...] Dante, Petrarca,"--and if still the flask [...] Appears to yield its wine by drops too slow,-- [...] "Angelo, Raffael, Pergolese,"--all [...] Whose strong hearts beat through stone, or charged again [...] The paints with fire of souls electrical, [...] Or broke up heaven for music. What more then? [...] Why, then, no more. The chaplet's last beads fall [...] In naming the last saintship within ken, [...] And, after that, none prayeth in the land. [...] Alas, this Italy has too long swept [...] Heroic ashes up for {{hour-glass}} sand; [...] Of her own past, impassioned nympholept! [...] Consenting to be nailed here by the hand [...] To the very bay-tree under which she stept [...] A queen of old, and plucked a leafy branch; [...] And, licensing the world too long indeed [...] To use her broad phylacteries to staunch [...] And stop her bloody lips, she takes no heed [...] How one clear word would draw an avalanche [...] Of living sons around her, to succeed [...] The vanished generations. Can she count [...] These oil-eaters with large live mobile mouths [...] Agape for macaroni, in the amount [...] Of consecrated heroes of her south's [...] Bright rosary? The pitcher at the fount, [...] The gift of gods, being broken, she much loathes [...] To let the ground-leaves of the place confer [...] A natural bowl. So henceforth she would seem [...] No nation, but the poet's pensioner, [...] With alms from every land of song and dream, [...] While aye her pipers sadly pipe of her [...] Until their proper breaths, in that extreme [...] Of sighing, <b>split</b> the <b>reed</b> on which they played: [...] Of which, no more. But never say [...] "no more" [...] To Italy's life! Her memories undismayed [...] Still argue [...] "evermore;" [...] her graves implore [...] Her future {{to be strong and}} not afraid; [...] Her very statues send their looks before.|$|R
