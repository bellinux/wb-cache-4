60|$|LORD GORING. Don’t say that, Robert! It was {{for your}} sake <b>she</b> <b>came</b> <b>here.</b> It was to try and save you <b>she</b> <b>came</b> <b>here.</b> She loves you and no one else.|$|E
60|$|D'you think I haven't got eyes in my head? I saw it {{that day}} <b>she</b> <b>came</b> <b>here.</b> D'you suppose {{she came to}} see me? She despises me.

6000|$|... "Then {{she must}} lump it. I'm {{not going to}} bother myself about her. I've pretty nearly as much money in it as she has, and we're in a boat together. If <b>she</b> <b>comes</b> <b>here</b> bothering, you'd better tell her so." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh! yes--the handsomest {{young lady}} that ever was seen; and so accomplished!--She plays and sings all day long. In {{the next room}} is a new {{instrument}} just come down for her--a present from my master; <b>she</b> <b>comes</b> <b>here</b> to-morrow with him." ...|$|R
