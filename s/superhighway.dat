A number of local London Buses routes run along Whitechapel Road, including 25, 205 and 254.|$|E
5|$|The only {{significant}} alteration {{to the structure}} of the bridge itself since the addition of the sculptures in 1907 came in 1973, when the Greater London Council (GLC) decided to add an extra traffic lane by reducing the width of the pavements. To counter the increased load of extra traffic, the council announced the replacement of the cast-iron balustrades with low box-girder structures. Despite formal objections from both Lambeth and Westminster Councils, the GLC ignored the objections. In 2015, the extra lane of motor traffic was removed in favour of a kerb-protected two-way cycle track, on the north-east side of the bridge. This forms part of Cycle <b>Superhighway</b> 5.|$|E
50|$|The county road {{commission}} led in calling, {{during the}} 1930s, for <b>superhighways</b> {{in the state}} to relieve congestion; it worked to build <b>superhighways</b> in conjunction with the state plan that emerged, and which the county road commission endorsed.|$|R

5000|$|At {{the time}} of writing, the [...] "flight to the suburbs" [...] had not yet {{taken place in the}} USA. <b>Superhighways</b> were known from the example of German autobahns but had not taken hold. Heinlein {{predicted}} that <b>superhighways</b> would cause what is now called urban sprawl along their routes, and the Road City took the concept further by having the transportation become the core of the urban development.|$|R
5|$|The {{outbreak}} of World War II in September1939 temporarily halted McQuesten's ambitions, as funding was quickly {{shifted to the}} war effort. As a result, construction on the new <b>superhighway</b> was put on hold south of Niagara Falls. McQuesten officially opened the QEW on August23, 1940; the pavement ended south of Lundy's Lane. Despite the war, work began on {{a link between the}} highway and the Rainbow Bridge through the centre of Niagara Falls. This link would not be completed in time for the opening of the new bridge.|$|E
5|$|The Blue Water Bridge links Sarnia and its {{neighbouring}} {{village of}} Point Edward {{to the city}} of Port Huron in the United States. It spans the St. Clair River, which connects Lake Huron to Lake St. Clair. The bridge's original three-lane span, opened in 1938, was twinned on 22 July 1997, making the bridge the fourth busiest border crossing in Ontario. The Blue Water Bridge border crossing makes use of both the NEXUS (frequent traveler program) and the Free and Secure Trade (FAST) program. Linking Highway 402 with the American Interstate 94 (I-94) and I-69, the bridge forms part of the NAFTA <b>Superhighway,</b> {{and is one of the}} most important gateways on the north–south truck routes.|$|E
5|$|Sheridan Drive was {{constructed}} during the early1920s as {{a town of}} Tonawanda project to help alleviate the anticipated growth of the village of Kenmore. Despite its construction, the new road was not without controversy. During construction, new traffic lights were put in with concrete supports were opposed heavily by the town of Tonawanda and its residents, resulting in the traffic lights not having been built for many years. The town also felt that {{the construction of a}} <b>superhighway</b> {{in the middle of the}} country in Tonawanda was unjustified with the average traffic in that area. After construction of Sheridan Drive was completed in 1925, a monument with a statue of General Phillip Sheridan {{was constructed}} to commemorate the new road. However, the taxpayers feeling enough money had already been spent on the road, the statue of Sheridan was never constructed and only the monument to the road's construction was completed. In order to give the road a new look, the road had large trees planted throughout what was considered a desolate area at the time.|$|E

5|$|In 1934, {{the entire}} length of US 13 between Dover and Wilmington was widened into a divided highway, which at the time was the best <b>superhighway</b> and the longest stretch of divided highway in the world. During the course of the 1930s, several other state roads were {{constructed}} while others were widened into divided highways. In 1935, the DSHD took over maintenance of all remaining county roads, tripling the mileage of the state highway system, and took over several city streets in Wilmington in 1936. Progress on improving the state highway system slowed during World War II; the only major project completed during that time was the construction of the high-level St. Georges Bridge to replace a lift bridge destroyed by a ship in 1939. Following the war, several highway improvement projects took place including widening more roads to divided highways. On August 16, 1951, the Delaware Memorial Bridge and its approach road opened to traffic, providing a fixed road link for US 40 across the Delaware River to New Jersey and replacing ferry service that previously existed. Following the completion of the bridge, traffic along US 13 and US 40 increased, with plans made for a new freeway to handle the increased traffic. In 1957, US 13 was widened into a divided highway between Greenwood and Harrington, providing a divided highway running the north-south length of the state.|$|E

25|$|In September 2006, U.S. Representative Virgil Goode {{proposed}} {{with six}} co-sponsors non-binding House Concurrent Resolution 487, which specifically outlined {{opposition to a}} North American Union or a NAFTA <b>Superhighway</b> {{as a threat to}} U.S. sovereignty. The bill never left committee. The same resolution was reintroduced by Goode in January 2007 for the 110th Congress as House Concurrent Resolution 40, this time with forty-three cosponsors, including 2008 Republican presidential candidates Duncan Hunter, Ron Paul and Tom Tancredo, who have all expressed opposition to a North American Union during their campaigns.|$|E

25|$|Development was resumed in {{all areas}} of the country, {{including}} the hitherto neglected and largely undeveloped semi-arid or arid north. Many sectors of the economy recovered from total collapse pre-2003. Numerous state corporations that had collapsed during the Moi years were revived and have begun performing profitably. The telecommunications sector boomed. Rebuilding, modernisation and expansion of infrastructure began in earnest, with several ambitious infrastructural and other projects, such as the Thika <b>Superhighway,</b> which would have been seen as unattainable pipe dreams during the bland and largely stagnant Moi years, completed. The country's cities and towns also began being positively renewed and transformed.|$|E
25|$|A toll <b>superhighway</b> {{connecting}} {{the major cities}} {{of the state of}} New York that would become part of a larger nationwide highway network was proposed as early as 1949. The following year, the New York State Legislature passed the Thruway Authority Act creating the New York State Thruway Authority (NYSTA), an independent public corporation, which would build and manage the turnpike. The project was to be financed through toll revenue bonds and self-liquidating by receipt of tolls, rents, concessions, and other income. The act also stipulated NYSTA adopt a hybrid system of tolls, with barrier tolls collected in urban areas, and long-distance tickets issued in rural areas.|$|E
25|$|Narrow Street forms {{a part of}} {{the north}} bank of the Thames Path and Cycle <b>Superhighway</b> CS3, the walk and cycle lane is between tall former {{warehouses}} and modern flats. Many were built with planning covenants granting river access, but these are now often barred to the public. Vehicular access is limited, as the area is cut off by the entrance to the Limehouse tunnel and parking is strictly controlled, however this makes the area reasonably quiet for cyclists. Public access to the foreshore is prohibited, apparently part of the security arrangements for former Foreign Secretary, David Owen. The National Cycle Route 1 also runs in Limehouse north and south.|$|E

25|$|Two years earlier, {{the state}} {{legislature}} had appropriated funds to study the feasibility of building a <b>superhighway</b> comparable to similar projects being planned and constructed in other states. Early proposals showed a highway stretching from Parkersburg to Princeton, while another map diagrammed a route from Wheeling to Princeton. Both of these plans, however, were shelved in a 1951 study, citing the extreme costs of building a modern highway through very unforgiving terrain as the primary reason. The study recommended that the northern terminus be moved to Fairplain just outside Ripley and that the southern terminus remain in Princeton. The study also suggested that the highway be constructed as a two-lane facility rather than a four-lane highway, with provisions for future widening when funding became available.|$|E
25|$|Geography {{contributed to}} {{important}} geopolitical differences. For {{most of their}} histories, China, India, and the Middle East were each unified under a single dominant power that expanded until it reached the surrounding mountains and deserts. In 1600 the Ottoman Empire controlled almost all the Middle East, the Ming dynasty ruled China, and the Mughal Empire held sway over India. By contrast, Europe was almost always divided {{into a number of}} warring states. Pan-European empires, with the notable exception of the Roman Empire, tended to collapse soon after they arose. Another doubtless important geographic factor in the rise of Europe was the Mediterranean Sea, which, for millennia, had functioned as a maritime <b>superhighway</b> fostering the exchange of goods, people, ideas and inventions.|$|E
25|$|In 1988, Kleinrock chaired a {{group which}} {{produced}} the report Toward a National Research Network. This report {{was presented to}} Congress and was so influential on then-Senator Al Gore that {{it proved to be}} the foundation for what would be passed as the High Performance Computing and Communication Act of 1991, written and developed by Gore. Indeed, funding for the development of Mosaic in 1993, the World Wide Web browser which is often credited as leading to the Internet boom during the mid-1990s, came from the High-Performance Computing and Communications Initiative, a program created by the High Performance Computing Act of 1991., On January 11, 1994, as Vice-President, Gore gave the opening speech for The <b>Superhighway</b> Summit held at UCLA's Royce Hall. In 2001, Gore joined the faculty of UCLA as a visiting professor in the School of Public Policy and Social Research, Department of Policy Studies, family-centered community building.|$|E
