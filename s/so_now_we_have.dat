2500|$|Because {{of their}} {{identical}} names, {{there has been}} some confusion between tin-glazed majolica/maiolica and the lead-glazed majolica made in England and America in the 19th century, but they are different in origin, technique, style and history. In the late 18th century, old Italian maiolica became popular among [...] the British, who referred to it by the anglicized pronunciation majolica. The Minton pottery copied it and applied the term majolica ware to their product. At the Great Exhibition of 1851, Minton launched the colorful lead-glazed earthenware which they called Palissy ware soon also to become known as majolica. <b>So</b> <b>now</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> two distinct products with the same name. [...] "In the 1870s, the curators of the South Kensington Museum returned to the original Italian 'maiolica' with an 'i' to describe all Italian tin-glazed earthenware, doubtless to stress the Italian pronunciation and to avoid confusion with contemporary majolica." ...|$|E
2500|$|In November, IGN held {{a second}} online chat with Zeschuk, Falkner, {{programmer}} Marc Audy, lead tester Karl Schreiner, and tester Derrick Collins. Zeschuk stated Sony had recently {{looked at the}} game and been very impressed; [...] "They felt the gameplay improvements we've made (overall better balancing and reworking parts of every level), combined with the difficulty levels and slick controls really make MDK2: Armageddon for PS2 the definitive version of the game." [...] Speaking of his earlier problems with video memory, Faulkner said [...] "the video memory situation has improved dramatically since last time. The problem {{was that there was}} too little video memory to fit all our textures, and the machine can't use a texture unless it's specifically in video memory. What we've found since then is that the PS2 has enough bus bandwidth to transfer each texture from main memory to video memory as it's needed. That's on the order of hundreds of MB per second. We hadn't anticipated that the PS2 had that kind of brute horsepower on its bus. We had to reorient our thinking after that. <b>So</b> <b>now</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> almost more texture memory than we know what to do with." ...|$|E

[The {{blasting}} of rocks] {{affected the}} spawning grounds of fish, {{not only by}} the blasting but also because of when the blasting was done, they had to clean out all the broken bottom soil and then deposit it somewhere. And of course the easiest place to do it were the inlets and the bays where there were spawning areas and so for a long time fish couldn’t make a living out there and so a lot of their work was not done. The fish as you know, have sort of a cleaning action there in swimming – absorbing the water and taking in contaminants, deposit it down {{in the bottom of the}} river, so getting it out of the way. And <b>so</b> <b>now</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> to do without the fish for years.|$|R

The {{whole story}} told by Barker is a lie. But Barker's story is corroborated by Mrs. Douglas. Therefore she is lying also. They are both lying, and in a conspiracy. <b>So</b> <b>now</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> the clear problem. Why are they lying, {{and what is the}} truth which they are trying so hard to conceal?

6000|$|They {{were both}} at the mark in an instant, Jim as full of sprightly {{confidence}} as ever, and Berks with a fixed grin upon his bull-dog face and a most vicious gleam in the only eye which was of use to him. His half-minute had not enabled him to recover his breath, and his huge, hairy chest was rising and falling with a quick, loud panting like a spent hound. [...] "Go in, boy! Bustle him!" [...] roared Harrison and Belcher. [...] "Get your wind, Joe; get your wind!" [...] cried the Jews. <b>So</b> <b>now</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> a reversal of tactics, for it was Jim who went in to hit with all the vigour of his young strength and unimpaired energy, while it was the savage Berks who was paying his debt to Nature for the many injuries which he had done her. He gasped, he gurgled, his face grew purple in his attempts to get his breath, while with his long left arm extended and his right thrown across, he tried to screen himself from the attack of his wiry antagonist.

60|$|<b>So</b> <b>now</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> {{our three}} little figures drawn {{as clearly as}} a clumsy pen can follow such subtle elusive creatures of mood and fancy. We will suppose {{now that it is}} a summer evening, that Daddy is seated smoking in his chair, that the Lady is {{listening}} somewhere near, and that the three are in a tumbled heap upon the bear-skin before the empty fireplace trying to puzzle out the little problems of their tiny lives. When three children play with a new thought it is like three kittens with a ball, one giving it a pat and another a pat, as they chase it from point to point. Daddy would interfere as little as possible, save when he was called upon to explain or to deny. It was usually wiser for him to pretend to be doing something else. Then their talk was the more natural. On this occasion, however, he was directly appealed to.|$|E
6000|$|... "Eh, my boy, {{what is a}} beggar? A beggar {{is a man who}} is forced, by fate, {{to remind}} us of Christ; he is Christ's brother; he is the bell of the Lord, and rings in life for the purpose of {{awakening}} our conscience, of stirring up the satiety of man's flesh. He stands under the window and sings, 'For Christ's sa-ake!' and by that chant he reminds us of Christ, of His holy command to help our neighbour. But men have so ordered their lives that it is utterly impossible for them to act in accordance with Christ's teaching, and Jesus Christ has become entirely superfluous to us. Not once, but, in all probability, a thousand times, we have given Him over to be crucified, but still we cannot banish Him from our lives so long as His poor brethren sing His name in the streets and remind us of Him. And <b>so</b> <b>now</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> hit upon the idea of shutting up the beggars in such special buildings, so that they may not roam about the streets and stir up our consciences." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{place one}} here (at A), {{and the other}} there (at B), and I have little shelves with holes which I can put upon each pole, and so arrange them that {{whatever}} escapes from the two ends of the battery will appear as separate gases; for you saw that the water did not become vaporous, but gaseous. The wires are now in perfect and proper connection with the vessel containing the water; {{and you see the}} bubbles rising: let us collect these bubbles and see what they are. Here is a glass cylinder (O); I fill it with water and put it over one end (A) of the pile; and I will take another (H) and put it over the other end (B) of the pile. And <b>so</b> <b>now</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> a double apparatus, with both places delivering gas. Both these jars will fill with gas. There they go, that to the right (H) filling very rapidly; the one to the left (O) filling not so rapidly; and though I have allowed some bubbles to escape, yet still the action is going on pretty regularly; and were it not that one is rather smaller than the other, you would see that I should have twice as much in this (H) as I have in that (O). Both these gases are colourless; they stand over the water without condensing; they are alike in all things--I mean in all apparent things; and we have here an opportunity of examining these bodies and ascertaining what they are. Their bulk is large, and we can easily apply experiments to them. I will take this jar (H) first, and will ask you to be prepared to recognise hydrogen.|$|E
