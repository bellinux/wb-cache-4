5|$|The last {{portion of}} the report dealt with {{eliminating}} the debt by utilizing a <b>sinking</b> <b>fund</b> that would retire {{five percent of the}} debt annually until it was paid off.

The bonds, which were linked {{to the price of}} gold, were certificates held under a trust mortgage with the Chatham Phenix National Bank and Trust Company. Prospective purchasers of the bonds were told that Horch and an associate guaranteed payment of principal and interest personally and that the income from rentals was expected far to exceed expenses, including both interest costs and amounts to be committed to the <b>sinking</b> <b>fund.</b>|$|E
5|$|Powell {{implemented}} {{the use of}} the state's <b>sinking</b> <b>fund</b> to pay interest on school bonds, a measure which had passed over Governor Helm's veto, but Helm refused to carry out. In 1855, Kentucky's voters passed by landslide a measure to raise the school tax from two cents per hundred dollars of taxable property to five cents per hundred dollars. The measure enjoyed the support of both Governor Powell and superintendent of public schools Robert Jefferson Breckinridge. Under the leadership of Powell and Breckinridge, Kentucky's school system became among the strongest in the antebellum South.|$|E

5|$|The {{legislature}} heeded some of Clark's message.

They created a state board of education and the office of state superintendent. They also created county school commissioners in every county. In response to his remarks on slave property, the legislature enacted laws that raised the reward for apprehending a fugitive slave and made it illegal for stagecoach owners to allow fugitive slaves to use their coaches to escape.|$|E
5|$|Crittenden {{ordered the}} {{refurbishing}} {{of the state}} penitentiary, which had been damaged by a fire, and called for an extensive state geological survey. He also advised {{the creation of a}} <b>sinking</b> <b>fund</b> to retire the state's debt. The state adopted a new constitution during Crittenden's term, though Crittenden was not a delegate to the constitutional convention and apparently had little influence on the drafting of the document. Most Whigs opposed the calling of a constitutional convention because it would necessarily involve reapportionment of the state's legislative districts and threaten Whig dominance in the General Assembly; nevertheless, Crittenden belatedly supported the call for a convention during his 1848 gubernatorial campaign.|$|E
5|$|Governor Crittenden {{resigned}} on July 31, 1850 {{to accept}} President Millard Fillmore's appointment as attorney general, and Helm ascended to the governorship. As governor, Helm vetoed a legislative plan to cover deficits {{in the public}} school fund by drawing money from the state's <b>sinking</b> <b>fund,</b> but the General Assembly overrode the veto. He urged the legislature to fund a survey of the state's mineral reserves and a census of the state's agricultural and manufacturing resources. He called for spending on internal improvements and for raising judges' salaries to attract more qualified jurists to the bench. He also sought a ban on the carrying of concealed deadly weapons. The legislature did not act on any of these proposed reforms. The only part of Helm's agenda that did progress through the General Assembly was election reform.|$|E

5|$|The Wall Street Crash of 1929 {{occurred}} {{only weeks}} after the building was completed. At that time more than 80% of the apartments were rented and some 300 students had signed up to take classes at the Institute. However, both rentals and student fees were soon depleted, and the nonprofit corporation that ran the building was unable to meet its payments. On April 6, 1932, this organization was sued for nonpayment of taxes and <b>sinking</b> <b>fund</b> payments due on the mortgage bonds. At {{that time it was}} alleged that the building was being mismanaged, the principal evidence offered being the provision of free living quarters to the Roeriches and their followers. Horch successfully contested the suit partly on a technicality and partly by explaining that the 20 rooms occupied rent-free were used by management as partial compensation to employees of the corporation. Representatives of the bond holders had argued that the parts of the building that did not produce rental income—that is the museum, institute, and other cultural spaces—should be converted to apartments but Horch successfully countered that the museum et al. were an asset that generated a substantial tax exemption and that, in normal times, they led to higher rental rates from the existing apartments than would comparable apartments. He also pointed out that the demanded conversion would be expensive (about $100,000). In June 1932, the foreclosure case ended with Horch being named one of two receivers tasked with clearing the building's debts.|$|E
25|$|At the Republican state {{convention}} in Lexington, held May 23, 1883, Morrow {{was chosen as}} the Republican nominee for governor of Kentucky. His opponent was popular six-term congressman J. Proctor Knott. Morrow charged that the Democrats had, {{since the end of the}} Civil War, squandered the state's money and accomplished little. He cited as evidence that in 1865, the state's debt was $6 million and the state <b>sinking</b> <b>fund</b> contained $9 million in resources, but by 1883, the <b>sinking</b> <b>fund</b> was exhausted with the state debt still standing at $400,000. He also attacked outgoing Democratic governor Luke P. Blackburn for his liberal use of executive clemency. Morrow was no match for Knott's oratory nor the scathing press of Louisville Courier-Journal editor Henry Watterson. Knott won the election by a vote of 133,615 to 89,181.|$|E

40|$|The {{article focuses}} on the historiography of {{defining}} amortization {{as the source of}} further reproduction and creation due to the amortization of <b>sinking</b> <b>funds,</b> used by economic entities for future capital investments. Acting as the source of capital investments, <b>sinking</b> <b>funds</b> were established during the socialist era, {{as well as in the}} post-Soviet period, that is before the beginning of the 21 st century. However, starting from 2010, economic entities no longer have been creating <b>sinking</b> <b>funds</b> on the balance sheet and outside it, that corresponds to the international practice, in particular the rules and principles of International Financial Reporting Standards. The author proves that the amortization, recoverable in the price of goods (works, services), is the reimbursement of the past, not future expenditures. Accordingly, the <b>sinking</b> <b>funds,</b> as the source of future investments, cannot be made at the expenses of amortization charges. At the same time, the author analyzes the possible consequences of the legal right of enterprises to unchanged amortization installments in the reporting period with the extension of the life of depreciable fixed assets for the period when no amortization charges were calculated...|$|R
40|$|The {{purposes}} of this study are to analyze the allocation of fund proceeding from the bond issuance, to analyze the provision of <b>sinking</b> <b>funds</b> for the redemption of the bond, and to analyze the financial performances of BPD Jatim. The primary data was collected by interviewing with the financial analyst of PT. Trimegah Securities Tbk., and the secondary data was obtained from the company's historical data and other printed materials. This study finds that the bond issuance fund was allocated entirely for the employees consumption loan purpose. The provision of the <b>sinking</b> <b>funds</b> for the redemption of the bond at the maturity date is projected to be sufficient. It is found that through the bond issuance, BPD Jatims financial performance would be better off.

25|$|After Hamilton {{left office}} in 1795, the new Secretary of the Treasury Oliver Wolcott, Jr. {{informed}} Congress that, {{due to the}} existing state of government finances, more money was needed.

25|$|For {{most of the}} 20th century, {{the ferry}} was famed as the biggest bargain in New York City, as it charged the same one-nickel fare as the New York City Subway. In 1882, riders protested against a {{proposed}} fare increase to 10 cents per ride, but were unsuccessful in obtaining a fare reduction. The fare-reduction movement resurfaced in 1894, with multiple petitions being submitted to the New-York <b>Sinking</b> <b>Fund</b> Commissioners. However, these petitions were all denied.

25|$|Shortly after, the {{government}} of New York City {{made a series of}} decisions announcing its intent to acquire ownership of the ferry. The <b>Sinking</b> <b>Fund</b> Commission decided in 1903 that the city could acquire the Staten Island ferry route in 1903. The city would pay $3.2 million to take over operations of the ferry, including $2 million for five new screw-propelled ships. From 1902 to 1903, there were debates on where to put the new Whitehall terminal; the location at Whitehall Street was decided as the best location. The locations of the Staten Island terminal were also debated, with the terminal proposed to be built in West Brighton, Tompkinsville, Stapleton, and Port Richmond. In 1904, after the Staten Island Railway Company refused the city's offer of $500,000 for the two terminals, the city started a process to condemn the land around the terminals. The B's access to the Whitehall Street terminal was revoked on October 25, 1905. The city's Department of Docks and Ferries assumed ownership of the ferry and terminals. A new St. George Terminal was then built by the city for $2,318,720. The city acquired five boats from the B operation. The five new ships, one named for each of the new boroughs, were commissioned and entered service in 1905.|$|E

40|$|Since the Housing Act 1988, UK housing {{associations}} (HAs) have been responsible, with {{the removal of}} government grants, for funding all maintenance necessary for the upkeep of new stock over its lifespan. <b>Sinking</b> <b>funds</b> (SFs) have to be created, out of rental income, that are adequate to finance the long term projected maintenance demand. This paper reviews the use of SFs for building asset management with particular reference to the requirements being made of HAs. Current assumptions of what constitutes an adequate level of SF investment by their funding agencies are questioned with an analysis of case study data. Using linear-programming, the benefits of modelling an SF over merely calculating it are demonstrated. The technique is used to formulate SF strategies, some of which admit the possibility of going into deficit in the future, and these are compared with results from conventional SF projections. Finally, the effect that varying element and component lifespans can have on SF projections are investigated by using Monte Carlo methods to simulate profiles of long term maintenance expenditure, and observing how well funds projected with the original SF strategy match them. The results show the importance of reviewing regularly the SF policy in order that it remains relevant {{to the needs of}} the stock.
