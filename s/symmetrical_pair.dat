500|$|Bach {{composed}} the cantata {{in his first}} year as Thomaskantor in Leipzig, where he had begun a first cantata cycle for the occasions of the liturgical year on the first Sunday after Trinity with [...] The cantata text, written by Johann Oswald Knauer, is focused on the prescribed reading for the Sunday, the parable of the Good Samaritan [...] containing the Great Commandment, which is used as the text of the first movement. A pair of recitative and aria deals with the love of God, while a <b>symmetrical</b> <b>pair</b> deals with the love of the neighbour. Bach did not write the text of the closing chorale in the score, but probably his son Johann Christoph Friedrich Bach.|$|E
500|$|The theatre was {{designed}} as a <b>symmetrical</b> <b>pair</b> with the Carlton Hotel and restaurant on the adjacent site, now occupied by New Zealand House. The frontage formed three parts, each of nine bays. The hotel occupied two parts, the theatre one, and the two buildings were unified by a cornice above the ground floor. The buildings rose to four storeys, with attic floors above, surmounted by large squared domes in a style inspired by the French Renaissance. The theatre has a Corinthian colonnade at the first floor, rising to the second, forming a loggia in front of the circle foyer. This is above a canopy over the main ground floor entrances. The theatre lies on an east–west axis. The stage at the western end was [...] deep and [...] wide, and reputedly the first to be flat, rather than raked. The interior {{was designed}} by the consulting architect, W. H. Romaine-Walker (1854–1940), after the Opera at Versailles by Gabriel. Stalls and the pit were entered at ground level, with two partly cantilevered tiers above accommodating dress and family circles on the first level, and upper circle, amphitheatre and gallery on the tier above. In all, there were 1,319seats. Contemporary opinion was critical of the project. Edwin Sachs wrote in his 1897 guide to theatres, [...] "The treatment is considered to be in the French Renaissance style and stone has been used throughout. The detail cannot, however, be termed satisfactory, nor does the exterior architecturally express the purpose of the building." ...|$|E

Externally it bears the curved sting, the hypodermic aculeus or venom-injecting barb. It is equipped with various sensory hairs, as the sting cannot be guided visually. Each of the venom glands has its own duct to convey its secretion internally along the aculeus from the bulb of the gland to immediately subterminal of {{the point of the}} aculeus, where each of the paired ducts has its own venom pore.|$|E

50|$|Labia {{piercing}}s are {{one type}} of female genital piercing. This piercing can be placed either through the labia minora or the labia majora. They {{are one of the}} simpler and more common genital piercings performed on women, and are often pierced in <b>symmetrical</b> <b>pairs.</b> Like all genital piercings, depending on jewellery and placement, they may provide additional stimulation to one or both partners during sexual intercourse.|$|R
50|$|They are {{medium-sized}} {{to large}} trees growing to 30 - 50 m tall, with trunk diameters {{of up to}} 1.5 m. The leaves are alternate, divided into a <b>symmetrical</b> <b>pair</b> of large leaflets 5 - 10 cm long and 2 - 4 cm broad. The flowers are small, with five white petals, produced in panicles. The fruit is a pod containing a single seed.|$|E
50|$|The {{careers of}} Galtier and of Arthur McGregor are evidently {{intended}} {{as a kind of}} <b>symmetrical</b> <b>pair.</b> Both start off in very similar circumstances, as hard-working Canadian farmers who both resent the American occupation but (to start with) neither opposing it head-on. However, the circumstance of Galtier's daughter falling in love with an American and marrying him, while MacGregor's son was unjustly executed by the Americans, draws the two in diametrically opposite directions.|$|E
5000|$|The {{leaves are}} bilobed, each having a <b>symmetrical</b> <b>pair</b> of rounded lobes joined symmetrically about a midrib, with a small, soft mucronule in the notch at the tip. The {{resulting}} shape {{gave rise to}} the Afrikaans popular name [...] "kameelpoot", meaning [...] "camel's foot". The mucronule is fragile and frequently is missing as a result of minor damage. The flowers in the wild generally are a handsome brick red, but some cultivars have pink or orange-red flowers.|$|E
50|$|Antlers are {{extensions}} of the skull grown {{by members of the}} deer family. They are not true bone structures but they usually grow in <b>symmetrical</b> <b>pairs.</b> With the exception of caribou, antlers only grow on males. Antlers function primarily as objects of sexual attraction and as weapons in fights for control of harems. In many temperate zone species, antlers are shed and regrow each year; horns, in contrast, are permanent.|$|R

50|$|Alfa Romeo {{were the}} first to react to the {{engineering}} problems of the straight-eight: in their racing car engines for the P2 and P3 and in their Alfa Romeo 8C 2300/2600/2900 sports cars of Mille Miglia and Le Mans fame the camshaft drive had been moved to the engine centre, between cylinders four and five, thus reducing the aforementioned limitations. The straight-eight was actually built as a <b>symmetrical</b> <b>pair</b> of straight-four engines joined in the middle at common gear trains for the camshafts and superchargers. It had two overhead camshafts, but only two valves per cylinder.|$|E
50|$|Originally, {{the mosque}} was {{intended}} to include a <b>symmetrical</b> <b>pair</b> of domed mausoleums flanking a prayer hall; this ambition was curbed when {{the dome of the}} second mausoleum was not completed. On either side of the prayer hall are funerary chambers, housing the Sultan and his son in one and female members of the Sultan's family in the other. The Sultan's chamber has a domed ceiling, as originally planned, while the women's chamber has a plain flat ceiling. This dome is a reduced copy of Faraj's twin domes; because of the large size of the mosque, the dome appears disproportionately small in its setting.|$|E
50|$|In praying mantises, {{ultrasound}} avoidance {{behaviors are}} non-directional turns or power dives {{that are very}} effective in preventing capture by bats. The mantis ear, located in the midline between the metathoracic (third) legs, comprises two tympana within an auditory chamber that enhances sensitivity. A bilaterally <b>symmetrical</b> <b>pair</b> of auditory interneurons, 501-T3, accurately track the ultrasonic calls {{during the early stages}} of a bat attack. Because 501-T3 stops firing just before the evasive response starts, it may be involved in triggering the behavior. The praying mantis ear first appeared ca. 120 million years ago, predating the appearance of echolocating bats by ca. 50 million years, so its original function must be different from its current one.|$|E
50|$|The {{spinal cord}} is {{continuous}} with the caudal {{portion of the}} medulla, running {{from the base of}} the skull to the body of the first lumbar vertebra. It does not run the full length of the vertebral column in adults. It is made of 31 segments from which branch one pair of sensory nerve roots and one pair of motor nerve roots. The nerve roots then merge into bilaterally <b>symmetrical</b> <b>pairs</b> of spinal nerves. The peripheral nervous system is made up of these spinal roots, nerves, and ganglia.|$|R
50|$|In biology, {{the notion}} of {{symmetry}} is mostly used explicitly to describe body shapes. Bilateral animals, including humans, {{are more or less}} symmetric with respect to the sagittal plane which divides the body into left and right halves. Animals that move in one direction necessarily have upper and lower sides, head and tail ends, and therefore a left and a right. The head becomes specialized with a mouth and sense organs, and the body becomes bilaterally symmetric for the purpose of movement, with <b>symmetrical</b> <b>pairs</b> of muscles and skeletal elements, though internal organs often remain asymmetric.|$|R

50|$|Planes minutus {{is a small}} crab, {{reaching}} a maximum carapace length of 17.5 mm, and typically less than 10 mm. It has conspicuous eyes in wide orbits {{at the corners of}} the wide front edge of the carapace. The first pair of pereiopods (walking legs) bear a <b>symmetrical</b> <b>pair</b> of chelae with cutting teeth; the other four pairs are adorned with spines on the last two segments of each leg. It differs from the larger P. major in that males have a broadly triangular abdomen, rather than one which narrows abruptly after the third segment, and from P. marinus in having flattened legs with a fringe of setae that aid in swimming.|$|E
5000|$|A {{hyperbola}} {{can be seen}} as {{a closed}} curve which intersects the line at infinity in two different points. These two points are specified by the slopes of the two asymptotes of the hyperbola. Likewise, a parabola {{can be seen as}} a closed curve which intersects the line at infinity in a single point. This point is specified by the slope of the axis of the parabola. If the parabola is cut by its vertex into a <b>symmetrical</b> <b>pair</b> of [...] "horns", then these two horns become more parallel to each other further away from the vertex, and are actually parallel to the axis and to each other at infinity, so that they intersect at the line at infinity.|$|E

40|$|Proctolin (H-Arg-Tyr-Leu-Pro-Thr-OH) is a pentapeptide first {{extracted}} from cockroaches. It {{is known to}} have many neurohormonal effects and has been associated with specific, identified cockroach neurons. We have produced proctolin antisera and report here on their application in detecting proctolin-like immunoreactivity (PLI) in the cockroach central nervous system. Radioimmunoassay, capable of detectable 50 fmol of proctolin, was used to quantify the distribution of PLI. Highest concentrations were detected in the genital ganglia and lowest in the cerebral ganglia. Immunohistochemistry on the cockroach central nervous system demonstrated that PLI is localized to neurons. Neurons stained by using immunohistochemistry were widespread in the ganglia.
