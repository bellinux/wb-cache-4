40|$|The {{management}} of cancer pain represents a difficult diagnostic and therapeutic {{problem for the}} clinician. In a multidisciplinary approach to the {{management of}} cancer pain, neurosurgical methods are {{an essential part of}} the therapy. Frequently, patients with advanced cancer suffer from an increasing pain, requesting ever higher dosage of narcotics, and finally seeming to respond only to high dosage of intravenous narcotics. Gradually, the opioids produce less satisfactory analgetics effects an more serious side manifestations. These patients can be considered for surgical management of pain. Historically, surgery for cancer pain began with destructive procedures (neurectomy, rhizotomy, sympathectomy), often referred to as ablative. In past two decades, with the help of the current knowledge of cancer pain mechanisms and some of the technological developments, such as microsurgical and stereotactic techniques, computerized tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, the majority of ablative procedures have been replaced by new methods. Among them a few are selectively and minimally ablative (microsurgical <b>spinothalamic</b> <b>cordotomy,</b> dorsal root entry zone operation, limited midline myelotomy) and the others ones are neuroaugumentative operations (deep brain structures and spinal cord stimulation, drugdelivery systems) ...|$|E
40|$|Introduction. Surgical {{treatment}} of chronic pain includes destructive procedures (neurectomy, rhizotomy, sympathectomy), {{often referred to}} as ablative, and accompanied by high morbidity and mortality rates. Surgical {{treatment of}} pain. During the past three decades, thanks to current knowledge on chronic pain mechanisms and technological developments, such as improved microsurgical and stereotactic techniques, guided by computerized tomography, magnetic resonance imaging and neural tissue impedance monitoring, the majority of ablative procedures have been replaced by new methods. Among them, a few can be considered as selectively and minimally ablative (microsurgical <b>spinothalamic</b> <b>cordotomy,</b> dorsal root entry zone lesions, limited midline myelotomy) and others as neuroaugumentative procedures for neuromodulatory processes (deep brain structures and spinal cord stimulation, drug-delivery systems). Neurosurgical procedures. Cordotomy is very effective in pain treatment and it may produce complete abolishment of pain, especially in patients suffering from neoplastic invasion of the brachial plexus (Pancoast¢s syndrome) or lumbosacral plexus. Dorsal root entry zone operation is generally the only treatment option for pain due to root avulsion and segmental pain in spinal cord injury. Spinal cord stimulation is useful in management of pain following peripheral nerve injury. Deep brain stimulation is a promising treatment of central pain. Conclusion. The purpose of this review is to draw attention to neurosurgical approaches to treatment of chronic and opioid-resistant pain. ...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{surgical}} procedures devised for intractable pain are the excision of painful {{area of the}} skin, peripheral neurotomy, intraspinal or intracranial posterior rhizotomies, anterolateral spinal <b>cordotomy,</b> <b>spinothalamic</b> tractotomy at medulla and mesencephalon for the pain of organic origin, and the prefrontal lobotomy for psychogenic pain. Unfortunately, these procedures are followed either by disturbance of physiologic sensory function or by changes of affect and personality. Partial gasserian gangliolysis successfully alleviated the trigeminal neuralgia without significant sensory disturbance of the face. Recent advances in stereotaxic technique has enabled us to attack the thalamus and other deep subcortical centers. This new method, together with recent neuroanatomico-physiological progress in regard to 2 ̆ 2 pain tract 2 ̆ 2 through intralaminar nuclear complex, resulted in discovery of thalamotomy destroying the nucleus centrum medianum with or without adjacent intralaminar nuclei, which eliminates the organic pain without any detectable sensory deficit. Anterior cingulectomy or cingulumotomy has developed to alleviate the psychogenic pain without psychological changes. These are the ideal pain-relieving procedures. A new method of percutaneous cervical cordotomy can be safely used for the debilitated patients with terminal malignant diseases...|$|R
