5|$|Americium is an {{artificial}} element of recent origin, and thus {{does not have}} a biological requirement. It is harmful to life. It has been proposed to use bacteria for removal of americium and other heavy metals from rivers and streams. Thus, Enterobacteriaceae of the genus Citrobacter precipitate americium ions from aqueous solutions, binding them into a metal-phosphate complex at their cell walls. Several <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> reported on the biosorption and bioaccumulation of americium by bacteria and fungi.|$|E
5|$|Butterflies and moths {{are able}} to see ultra-violet (UV) light, and wing colours and {{patterns}} are principally observed by Lepidoptera in this region. The patterns seen on their wing under UV light differ considerably from those seen in normal light. The UV patterns act as visual cues which help differentiate between species {{for the purpose of}} mating. <b>Studies</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> carried out on Lepidoptera (mostly butterflies) wing patterns illuminated by UV light.|$|E

5|$|<b>Studies</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{conducted}} {{in several countries}} with different health care system models to assess the cost-effectiveness of linezolid compared to glycopeptides such as vancomycin or teicoplanin. In most countries, linezolid was more cost-effective than comparable antibiotics {{for the treatment of}} hospital-acquired pneumonia and complicated skin and skin structure infections, either due to higher cure and survival rates or lower overall treatment costs.|$|E
5|$|<b>Studies</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> done on Mayawati {{and books}} have been published, {{including}} her autobiographies. One of the first works was journalist Mohammad Jamil Akhter's book, Iron Lady Kumari Mayawati.

Behenji : A Political Biography of Mayawati is a biography by veteran journalist Ajoy Bose.|$|E

5|$|Studies on {{raccoons}} in the Southeast {{have yielded}} infection rates ranging from 47% to {{as low as}} 15.5%. Armadillo prevalence <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> described in Louisiana, and range {{from a low of}} 1.1% to 28.8%. Additionally, small rodents, including squirrels, mice, and rats, are important in the sylvatic transmission cycle because of their importance as bloodmeal sources for the insect vectors. A Texas study revealed 17.3% percent T. cruzi prevalence in 75 specimens representing four separate small rodent species.|$|E
5|$|The borders {{between the}} four {{subspecies}} are not sharp, because the subspecies interbreed. Many <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{performed in the}} border regions to assess the intermediate turtles, usually by comparing the anatomical features of hybrids that result from intergradation of the classical subspecies. Despite the imprecision, the subspecies are assigned nominal ranges.|$|E
5|$|There {{have not}} been any {{controlled}} studies on meth mouth, and several of its aspects are unclear. Although the condition has been popularized by media coverage and case reports, no systematic <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> conducted to conclusively tie methamphetamine use to symptoms that are commonly described as meth mouth. There are few ties between dental scholars and those who study drug use, {{and it can be}} difficult for dental researchers to find methamphetamine users to study.|$|E

5|$|A {{position}} paper {{published by the}} American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists in 2007 warns {{that there is no}} valid medical reason to perform the procedure, which is not considered routine or accepted by the College; and it has not been proven to be safe or effective. The potential risks include sexual dysfunction, infection, altered sensation, dyspareunia, adhesions and scarring. The College position is that it is untenable to recommend the procedure. The procedure is also not approved by the Food and Drug Administration or the American Medical Association, and no peer-reviewed <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> accepted to account for either safety or effectiveness of this treatment.|$|E
5|$|Antioxidants, such as {{vitamins}} C and E, {{have been}} proposed {{to protect against the}} disease, but results of <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> contradictory and no positive effect has been proven. The results regarding fat and fatty acids have been contradictory, with various studies reporting protective effects, risk-increasing effects or no effects. There have been preliminary indications that the use of anti-inflammatory drugs and calcium channel blockers may be protective. A 2010 meta-analysis found that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (apart from aspirin), have been associated with at least a 15 percent (higher in long-term and regular users) reduction of incidence of the development of Parkinson's disease.|$|E
5|$|Between 1950 and 1960, {{research}} and writings by international critics like George R. Collins, Nikolaus Pevsner and Roberto Pane spread a renewed awareness of Gaudí's work, while in his homeland it was admired and promoted by Alexandre Cirici, Juan Eduardo Cirlot and Oriol Bohigas. Gaudí's work has since gained widespread international appreciation, {{such as in}} Japan where notable <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> published by Kenji Imai and Tokutoshi Torii. International recognition of Gaudí's contributions {{to the field of}} architecture and design culminated in the 1984 listing of Gaudí's key works as UNESCO World Heritage Sites. Gaudí's style have subsequently influenced contemporary architects such as Santiago Calatrava and Norman Foster.|$|E

5|$|Drosophila melanogaster, a fruit fly, {{has long}} {{been used as a}} model {{organism}} in research because of the ease with which it can be bred and reared in the laboratory, its small genome, and {{the fact that many of}} its genes have counterparts in higher eukaryotes. A large number of genetic <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> undertaken based on this species; these have had a profound impact on the study of gene expression, gene regulatory mechanisms and mutation. Other studies have investigated physiology, microbial pathogenesis and development among other research topics. The studies on dipteran relationships by Willi Hennig helped in the development of cladistics, techniques that he applied to morphological characters but now adapted for use with molecular sequences in phylogenetics.|$|E
5|$|In 1960, the Canadian {{government}} {{protected the}} horses by law in their feral state. From the 1980s on, long-term, noninvasive herd <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> performed, and in 2007 a genetic {{analysis was conducted}} that concluded the herd was genetically unique enough to interest conservationists. In 2008, the horses were declared the official horse of Nova Scotia, and in 2011, the island was declared the Sable Island National Park Reserve. The herd is unmanaged, and legally protected from interference by humans. The horses live only at Sable Island and at the Shubenacadie Wildlife Park on the mainland of Nova Scotia, with the latter herd descended from horses removed from Sable Island in the 1950s.|$|E
5|$|Many {{risk factors}} and {{protective}} factors have been proposed, sometimes in relation to theories concerning possible mechanisms of the disease, however, none have been conclusively related to PD by empirical evidence. When epidemiological <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> carried out {{in order to test}} the relationship between a given factor and PD, they have often been flawed and their results have in some cases been contradictory. The most frequently replicated relationships are an increased risk of PD in those exposed to pesticides, and a reduced risk in smokers.|$|E
