2500|$|The {{index of}} {{refraction}} (or refractive index) {{is a way of}} measuring the speed of light in a material. Light travels fastest in a vacuum, such as in outer space. The speed of light in a vacuum is about 300,000 kilometers (186,000 miles) per second. The refractive index of a medium is calculated by dividing the speed of light in a vacuum by the speed of light in that medium. The refractive index of a vacuum is therefore 1, by definition. A typical <b>singlemode</b> <b>fiber</b> used for telecommunications has a cladding made of pure silica, with an index of 1.444 at 1,500nm, and a core of doped silica with an index around 1.4475. The larger the {{index of refraction}}, the slower light travels in that medium. From this information, a simple rule of thumb is that a signal using optical fiber for communication will travel at around 200,000 kilometers per second. To put it another way, the signal will take 5 milliseconds to travel 1,000 kilometers in fiber. Thus a phone call carried by fiber between Sydney and New York, a 16,000-kilometer distance, means that there is a minimum delay of 80 milliseconds (about [...] of a second) between when one caller speaks and the other hears. (The fiber in this case will probably travel a longer route, and there will be additional delays due to communication equipment switching and the process of encoding and decoding the voice onto the fiber).|$|E

30|$|An {{interferometer}} {{based on}} a D-shape chaotic optical fiber for measurement of multiparameters was proposed. The sensing structure relied on a D-shape fiber section spliced in between two <b>singlemode</b> <b>fibers</b> and interrogated in transmission. The optical spectrum was composed by multiple interference loss peaks, which were sensitive to the refractive index, temperature and strain — maximum sensitivities of 95.2 nm/RIU, 10.5 pm/°C and − 3.51 pm/μɛ, respectively, could be achieved.|$|R
50|$|For comparison, plastic {{optical fibers}} (POF) have low bandwidths and {{transmission}} rates (typically 100 MBit/s). They {{also have a}} high attenuation and therefore, the maximum distance is around 100 meters. Glass fibers {{on the other hand}} have very high bandwidths and transmission rates of up to GBit/s. The attenuation in glass fibres is much lower, glass fibers can cover distances of more than 10 km. Regarding bandwidth and distances, HCS fibers are situated between POF and multimode or <b>singlemode</b> <b>fibers.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Polarization-maintaining {{optical fibers}} {{are used in}} special applications, such as in fiber optic sensing, {{interferometry}} and quantum key distribution. They are also commonly used in telecommunications for the connection between a source laser and a modulator, since the modulator requires polarized light as input.

50|$|Field-mountable {{optical fiber}} {{connectors}} {{are used to}} join optical fiber jumper cables that contain one <b>singlemode</b> <b>fiber.</b> These assemblies can be separated into two major categories: single-jointed connector assemblies and multiple-jointed connector assemblies. According to Telcordia GR-1081, a single-jointed connector assembly is a connector assembly where {{there is only one}} spot where two different fibers are joined together. This is the situation generally found when connector assemblies are made from factory-assembled optical fiber connector plugs. A multiple-jointed connector assembly is a connector assembly where {{there is more than one}} closely spaced connection joining different fibers together. An example of a multiple-jointed connector assembly is a connector assembly that uses the stub-fiber type of connector plug.|$|E
5000|$|A {{class of}} {{laboratory}} power meters has an extended sensitivity, {{of the order}} of -110 dBm. This is achieved by using a very small detector and lens combination, and also a mechanical light chopper at typically 270 Hz, so the meter actually measures AC light. This eliminates unavoidable dc electrical drift effects. If the light chopping is synchronized with an appropriate synchronous (or [...] "lock-in") amplifier, further sensitivity gains are achieved. In practice, such instruments usually achieve lower absolute accuracy due to the small detector diode, and for the same reason, may only be accurate when coupled with <b>singlemode</b> <b>fiber.</b> Occasionally such an instrument may have a cooled detector, though with the modern abandonment of Germanium sensors, and the introduction of InGaAs sensors, this is now increasingly uncommon.|$|E

40|$|An all-fiber {{refractive}} index (RI) sensor {{with a simple}} configuration of periodical tapers is proposed and investigated experimentally. The proposed fiber RI sensor consists of a small core fiber sandwiched between two standard <b>singlemode</b> <b>fibers,</b> with tapers periodically fabricated along the small core fiber using a focused CO 2 laser beam.

An average sensitivity of 226. 6 nm/RIU (RI Unit) has been experimentally achieved in the RI range from 1. 33 to 1. 38. The refractometer is sensitive to temperature and an experimental investigation of this sensitivity is presented. It is found that the peak shift response has a linear variation with temperature; therefore, temperature dependence can be mitigated by a suitable RI correction process.

40|$|We use {{multimode}} interference (MMI) as {{an alternative}} optical technique to estimate lithium bromide (LiBr) concentration, of the work pair LiBr-H 2 O, in absorption heat pumps (AHP). The sensing element is a singlemode-multimode-singlemode (SMS) fiber optic structure.

The input field profile entering the sensing element, which is the naked (no cladding) MMF section of the SMS fiber structure, produced different transmitted intensity responses for each of these concentrations. Thus the optical characterization of the mixture was used to establish a mathematical relation to estimate the LiBr concentration. A linear fit for solutions with concentrations ranging from 43. 30 % to 50. 87 % and refractive indices between 1. 421 and 1. 439 is demonstrated...|$|R
