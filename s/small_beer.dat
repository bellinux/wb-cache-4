5|$|Beer {{was such}} an {{important}} consumable to Americans that they would closely watch the stocks of barley held by farmers to ensure quality beer production. In John Adams' correspondence with his wife Abigail, he asked {{about the quality of}} barley crops to ensure adequate supply for the production of beer for himself and their friends. However, hops, essential to production of beer, did not grow well in the colonies. It only grew wild in the New World, and needed to be imported from England and elsewhere. In addition to these alcohol-based products produced in America, merchants imported wine and brandy. Beer was not only consumed for its flavor and alcohol content, but because it was safer to drink than water, which often harbored disease-causing microorganisms. Even children drank <b>small</b> <b>beer.</b>|$|E
25|$|At {{times and}} places of poor public {{sanitation}} (such as Medieval Europe), the consumption of alcoholic drinks {{was a way of}} avoiding water-borne diseases such as cholera. <b>Small</b> <b>beer</b> and faux wine, in particular, were used for this purpose. Although alcohol kills bacteria, its low concentration in these beverages would have had only a limited effect. More important was that the boiling of water (required for the brewing of beer) and the growth of yeast (required for fermentation of beer and wine) would kill dangerous microorganisms. The alcohol content of these beverages allowed them to be stored for months or years in simple wood or clay containers without spoiling. For this reason, they were commonly kept aboard sailing vessels as an important (or even the sole) source of hydration for the crew, especially during the long voyages of the early modern period.|$|E

500|$|Domery {{remained}} hungry, and {{was recorded}} as having eaten the prison cat {{and at least}} 20 rats which had strayed into his cell. Domery also ate the medicines of those prisoners in the camp's infirmary who refused to take them, suffering no apparent adverse effects as a result. It was also recorded that he would regularly eat the prison's candles, and that if his ration of beer was exhausted, he would resort to drinking water to wash down his food. (To {{reduce the risk of}} water-borne disease, troops were issued rations of mildly alcoholic beverages such as <b>small</b> <b>beer</b> and diluted rum, and drinks such as tea and coffee which involved boiling water before drinking.) ...|$|E
500|$|In the Early Middle Ages beer was {{primarily}} brewed in monasteries, {{and on a}} smaller scale in individual households. By the High Middle Ages breweries in the fledgling medieval towns of northern Germany began to take over production. Though most of the breweries were small family businesses that employed at most eight to ten people, regular production allowed for investment in better equipment and increased experimentation with new recipes and brewing techniques. These operations later spread to the Netherlands in the 14th century, then to Flanders and Brabant, and reached England by the 15th century. Hopped beer became very popular in the last decades of the Late Middle Ages. In England and the Low Countries, the per capita annual consumption was around , and it was consumed with practically every meal: low alcohol-content beers for breakfast, and stronger ones later in the day. When perfected as an ingredient, hops could make beer keep for six months or more, and facilitated extensive exports. In Late Medieval England, the word beer came to mean a hopped beverage, whereas ale had to be unhopped. In turn, ale or beer was classified into [...] "strong" [...] and [...] "small", the latter less intoxicating, regarded as a drink of temperate people, and suitable for consumption by children. As late as 1693, John Locke stated that the only drink he considered suitable for children of all ages was <b>small</b> <b>beer,</b> while criticizing the apparently common practice among Englishmen of the time to give their children wine and strong alcohol.|$|E
500|$|The MCC tour {{took place}} against a {{background}} of social disturbance in Australia. There were concerns within Australian society over the growing influence of communism and, according to the historian Andrew Moore, some commentators hoped that the tour would help to ease tension. It was expected that Gilligan's influence and popularity would further assist this process. However, during the tour, the Australian secret service were informed by the London authorities that Gilligan and the MCC tour manager Frederick Toone were members of the British Fascists. Although the organisation never achieved the same level of influence in Britain as the British Union of Fascists, which formed in 1932, the British Fascists were popular for a short time during the mid-1920s. The primary focus of the organisation was to oppose communism, but MI5 considered its threat serious enough to warrant placing leading members under surveillance. In addition, the British Foreign Office were aware that the British Fascists had established some links overseas. Moore suggests that it is possible that Gilligan and Toone used the tour as an opportunity to establish links in Australia. The team visited many parts of Australia and attended many social events which presented an opportunity to discuss politics. Shortly after the tour's conclusion, the Commonwealth Investigative Branch uncovered evidence that the British Fascists had established chapters in several Australian cities, although they did not know how this had happened. Moore believes that [...] "it may be totally coincidental that the Australian chapter of the British Fascists was established so soon after the MCC tour", but is more likely that Gilligan and Toone brought Fascist literature to Australia for distribution. However, Moore writes that [...] "the British Fascists' Australian operations were <b>small</b> <b>beer</b> indeed" [...] and of little consequence.|$|E

2500|$|In 1844, a law {{was passed}} which set brewing license fees and {{appointed}} county commissioners to approve each license. [...] In 1846, a provision {{was passed by the}} legislature to allow a [...] "local option" [...] to whether grant or deny these licenses. This meant the citizens of the towns could vote on whether to allow or disallow these establishments. In 1850, town selectmen became authorized to approve business license to sell <b>small</b> <b>beer</b> or cider, but not strong beer. In 1852, several more laws were passed which started Vermont's prohibition era.

2500|$|Under {{a banner}} of [...] "reducing public drunkenness" [...] the Beer Act of 1830 {{introduced}} a new lower tier of premises permitted to sell alcohol, the beer houses. At the time beer was viewed as harmless, nutritious and even healthy. Young children were often given what was described as <b>small</b> <b>beer,</b> which was brewed to have a low alcohol content, as the local water was often unsafe. Even the evangelical church and temperance movements of the day viewed the drinking of beer very much as a secondary evil and a normal accompaniment to a meal. The freely available beer was thus intended to wean the drinkers off the evils of gin, or so the thinking went.|$|E
2500|$|A common {{recipe for}} feeding the troops was beef broth and potatoes– a hearty, warm and filling meal that could {{normally}} feed {{up to eight}} men. Stews and meat pies were regularly cooked and small beer– for which a man received around [...] per diem– and rum were watered down in order to last and deter the men from drunken behaviour. <b>Small</b> <b>beer</b> was often brewed to kill any germs that was present in the water, and was {{one way in which}} to reduce the spread and rates of disease. Drinking was used as a method to relax {{at the end of the}} day and was a leisurely activity that allowed the men to unwind. It was believed that this would boost morale and enhance the sense of camaraderie between the soldiers.|$|E
