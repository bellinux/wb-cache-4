2500|$|The {{life of an}} IGU varies {{depending}} {{on the quality of}} materials used, size of gap between inner and outer pane, temperature differences, workmanship and location of installation both in terms of facing direction and geographic location, as well as the treatment the unit receives. [...] IG units typically last from 10 to 25 years, with windows facing the equator often lasting less than 12 years. IGUs typically carry a warranty for 10 to 20 years depending upon the manufacturer. [...] If IGUs are altered (such as installation of a <b>solar</b> <b>control</b> film) the warranty may be voided by the manufacturer.|$|E

40|$|One of the {{greatest}} problems encountered in greenhouses and buildings with large glazing is control of the internal atmosphere. The inherent characteristic of these buildings to act as solar collectors {{is to be used}} effectively for collecting and storing the excess solar energy. A new type of glazed roof, a <b>Solar</b> Climate <b>Control</b> roof system, was designed as a means to cool the interior environment of the greenhouses during the daytime and to heat during the nighttime or on overcast days. A heat exchanger-storage system, using water as a thermal mass is included {{in the design of the}} <b>Solar</b> Climate <b>Control</b> system. A film of water flows on the inner surface of the roof and absorbs the direct solar heat radiation, acting then as a cooling agent. The energy absorbed may be reused for nighttime heating. An efficient water dispersion pipe for the <b>Solar</b> Climate <b>Control</b> system was developed. The use of a soap solution rather than water alone for the <b>Solar</b> Climate <b>Control</b> water film system permitted a significant reduction in pumping rate and improved uniformity of the film. A computer simulation model was run to determine the energy loads for both a conventional (double glazed roof) greenhouse and one equipped with the <b>Solar</b> Climate <b>Control</b> system. The <b>Solar</b> Climate <b>Control</b> system shows low operating cost and very good efficiency in heat removal...|$|R
40|$|Tailoring {{the solar}} {{absorptivity}} (alpha(sub s)) and thermal emissivity (epsilon(sub T)) of materials constitutes an innovative approach to <b>solar</b> energy <b>control</b> and energy conversion. Numerous ceramic and metallic materials are currently available for <b>solar</b> absorbance/thermal emittance <b>control.</b> However, conventional metal oxides and dielectric/metal/dielectric multi-coatings have limited utility due to residual shear stresses {{resulting from the}} different {{coefficient of thermal expansion}} of the layered materials. This research presents an alternate approach based on nanoparticle-filled polymers to afford mechanically durable solar-absorptive and thermally-emissive polymer nanocomposites. The alpha(sub s) and epsilon(sub T) were measured with various nano inclusions, such as carbon nanophase particles (CNPs), at different concentrations. Research has shown that adding only 5 wt% CNPs increased the alpha(sub s) and epsilon(sub T) by a factor of about 47 and 2, respectively, compared to the pristine polymer. The effect of <b>solar</b> irradiation <b>control</b> of the nanocomposite on solar energy conversion was studied. The <b>solar</b> irradiation <b>control</b> coatings increased the power generation of solar thermoelectric cells by more than 380 % compared to that of a control power cell without <b>solar</b> irradiation <b>control</b> coatings...|$|R
