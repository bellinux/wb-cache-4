5|$|Due {{to varying}} {{circumstances}} throughout the season, several players were rotated {{in and out}} of starting positions throughout Alabama's depth chart. Below is a listing of at what times during the season players were substituted as <b>starter</b> or saw increased playing time. On the offensive side of the ball, freshman Grant Hill split time with <b>starter</b> Austin Shepherd at right tackle against Kentucky. Kellen Williams was listed on the depth chart as a backup at left tackle and guard; however, coach Saban mentioned Williams as being the sixth <b>starter</b> who can fill in at all the offensive line positions. After the Ole Miss, Williams was listed as the back-up center to Chad Lindsay after an injury to <b>starter</b> Ryan Kelly.|$|E
5|$|In {{individual}} Olympic competition, Heath won {{a silver}} medal in the 200-meter freestyle (1:49.10) behind Gross's world record-setting performance (1:47.44). He also placed fourth in the 100-meter freestyle event final (50.41); the outcome was controversial, however, because of a premature <b>starter</b> gun and a quick start by Gaines, the winner. Gaines' coach, Richard Quick, knew of <b>starter</b> Frank Silvestri's propensity to fire the <b>starter</b> gun almost immediately when the swimmers mounted the blocks. Gaines gained about a meter's head start on the competition; video of the event later confirmed that {{one or more of}} the swimmers had not been set when the <b>starter</b> gun fired.|$|E

5|$|As a freshman, Manning {{began the}} season as the third-string quarterback. In the season opener against UCLA, Manning {{was one of three}} quarterbacks to come off the bench after <b>starter</b> Jerry Colquitt {{suffered}} a season-ending injury on the seventh play of the game. However, Manning was not able to generate any offense and was pulled from the game. During the season's fourth game, against Mississippi State, <b>starter</b> Todd Helton got injured and Manning took over. The Vols lost 24–21, but Manning was named the team's <b>starter</b> and remained so {{for the rest of his}} college career. In his first start, the following week against Washington State, the Vols won 10–9. They won all but one of their remaining games, finishing the season 8–4 with a 45–23 victory over Virginia Tech in the 1994 Gator Bowl.|$|E

40|$|Strong <b>starters</b> and skew <b>starters</b> {{have been}} widely used in various {{combinatorial}} designs such as Room squares and Howell designs. Mullin and Nemeth, also Chong and Chan, gave a construction of skew <b>starters</b> for every odd prime power n. Skew balanced <b>starters</b> and symmetric skew balanced <b>starters</b> are two special types of skew <b>starters</b> crucially used in the construction of completely balanced Howell rotations for bridge tournaments (which is different from Howell designs and whose construction remains an open problem). Represent an odd prime power n as ek + 1 where e = 2 m and k is odd. Recently, Du and Hwang gave a construction for symmetric skew balanced <b>starters</b> for general m ⩾ 2 but could prove its validity only for k ⩾ O(e 3). Yu and Hwang improved this result to k ⩾ O(e) and conjectured that the construction is valid for all m ⩾ 2 and k − 1. In this paper we prove the conjecture except for the two cases k = 3, 9...|$|R
