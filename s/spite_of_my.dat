500|$|Of {{literary}} figures {{after the}} Lake Poets among those most {{closely associated with}} Keswick was the novelist Hugh Walpole. In 1924 he moved into Brackenburn, a house between Keswick and Grange {{at the opposite end}} of Derwentwater. Like the Lake Poets in the previous century, he wrote enthusiastically about the Lake District, and its scenery and atmosphere often found their way into his fiction. He wrote in 1939, [...] "That I love Cumberland with all my heart and soul is another reason for my pleasure in writing these Herries books. That I wasn't born a Cumbrian isn't my fault: that Cumbrians, in <b>spite</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> 'foreignness', have been so kind to me, is my good fortune." ...|$|E
500|$|Monet {{submitted}} The Magpie and Fishing Boats at Sea (W 126) to the Salon of 1869. Both {{paintings were}} rejected in April. Critic Paul Richard {{said that the}} jurors rejected the painting as [...] "too common and too coarse". Monet's experimental use of color and radical departure from the descriptive, academic style surprised the public and probably contributed to its dismissal by the jury. Monet told French novelist Arsène Houssaye (18151896), [...] "This rejection has taken the bread from my mouth, and in <b>spite</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> low prices, collectors and dealers turn their backs on me." [...] A century later, The Magpie was acquired by the Musée d'Orsay in 1984. It {{became one of the}} most popular paintings in their permanent collection.|$|E
500|$|In {{order to}} {{encourage}} the captains of the merchant ships of all countries which carry the lifeblood of the U.K., I {{made it a point}} to attend the briefing conference of all captains and chief engineers before their departure. During the winter of '42–'43, when sinkings were at their worst, I could see when I told them of the measures by escort and air cover that were being taken for their protection and safety; I could see that they knew very well and that they knew I knew in <b>spite</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> brave words, that anything up to 25 per cent of them would probably not arrive in the U.K. in their own ships, and that probably half of that number would not arrive in the U.K. at all. But there was never a waver in their resolve – Admiral Murray.|$|E

500|$|The England {{selectors}} {{made several}} {{changes to the}} team for the second Test. Colin Blythe, a crucial bowler to the team, withdrew before the game. Other players were left out whom most commentators believed should have played, and the bowling attack was packed with medium-paced bowlers of a similar style. The report in Wisden suggested: [...] "Never {{in the history of}} Test Matches in England has there been such blundering in the selection of an England eleven". The selectors later implied the controversial choices were at the behest of MacLaren, although other evidence suggests that MacLaren did not get the team he requested. England lost the game; MacLaren's reputation suffered and commentators began to blame him for the defeat. He offered his resignation, but the selectors retained him as captain and restored some of the players omitted from the second Test. When England lost the third Test after the batsmen failed, not helped by MacLaren's poor form, critics questioned his place in the team. MacLaren tried to excuse his position, suggesting in the press that he knew the team would struggle and played [...] "in <b>spite</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> personal wishes". He also implied that the team's selection was out of his hands. When the fourth Test was rained off, England could not win the series and so Australia retained the Ashes.|$|E

[...] Considering that Josephine reported in later life at having first arrived with the Markham Troupe on December 1, 1879, and that Josephine joined Behan in Tombstone that same year, her reference to [...] "my bad experience of a few years ago" [...] means she must have been in Arizona for some time before 1879.|$|E

2500|$|In his 2013 memoirs, Joseph Pearce, a British {{former white}} {{supremacist}} and {{senior member of}} the National Front who later converted to Catholicism and is a writer and academician at Aquinas College (Nashville, Tennessee, USA), revealed what he knew about collusion between the NF, the British Army, and loyalist death squads. According to Pearce, [...] "In <b>spite</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> own unwillingness to become too directly involved in the terrorist operations in Northern Ireland, I was very aware, as were the leaders of the UVF and UDA, that National Front members serving with the Army in Northern Ireland were smuggling intelligence information on suspected IRA members to the Loyalist paramilitaries. This information included photographs of suspected IRA members, the type of car they drove and its registration number, and other useful facts. I have little doubt that this information was used by the UVF and UDA to target and assassinate their enemies." ...|$|E

2500|$|Nel Noddings {{draws an}} {{important}} distinction between natural caring and ethical caring (1984, 81-83). Noddings distinguishes between acting because [...] "I want" [...] and acting because [...] "I must". When I care for someone because [...] "I want" [...] to care, say I hug a friend who needs hugging {{in an act of}} love, Noddings claims that I am engaged in natural caring. When I care for someone because [...] "I must" [...] care, say I hug an acquaintance who needs hugging in <b>spite</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> desire to escape that person's pain, according to Noddings, I am engaged in ethical caring. Ethical caring occurs when a person acts caringly out of a belief that caring is the appropriate way of relating to people. When someone acts in a caring way because that person naturally cares for another, the caring is not ethical caring (1984, 79-80). Noddings' claims that ethical caring is based on, and so dependent on, natural caring (1984, 83, 206 fn 4). It is through experiencing others caring for them and naturally caring for others that people build what is called an [...] "ethical ideal", an image of the kind of person they want to be.|$|E
