However, the bearing surfaces of knee implants are usually freeform surfaces which are difficult to be designed, fabricated and measured with sub-micrometer form accuracy and surface finish in the nanometer range. This paper presents an integrated approach for supporting design, ultra-precision polishing and measurement of <b>superfinished</b> orthopaedic implants for bio-medical applications. The platform mainly consists of five key modules which include CAD model design module, data exchange module, model-based simulation system, tool path generator, as well as freeform measurement and characterisation module, respectively.

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} {{reliability}} when testing gear efficiency and on how gear mesh efficiency {{can be increased}} without {{detrimental effects on the}} gears. Test equipment commonly used in gear research was analysed to identify important parameters for gear efficiency testing. The effect of the bearing model's load-dependent losses on gear mesh efficiency was also investigated. Two different surface finishes of gears, ground and <b>superfinished,</b> were investigated to determine how two different load levels during running-in affect gear mesh efficiency and changes in surface roughness. Efficiency and gear temperature were also measured for ground and <b>superfinished</b> gears with dip lubrication, as well as two different forms of spray lubrication (before and after gear mesh contact). Tests on a gear test rig, showed that different assemblies of the same test setup can yield different measurements of torque loss. The applied bearing model had a significant effect on the estimated gear mesh efficiency. The mesh efficiency of ground gears is affected by the running-in procedure, with a higher running-in load resulting in a higher mesh efficiency than a lower load. This effect was not seen for <b>superfinished</b> gears, which show the same gear mesh efficiency for both running-in loads. Gearbox efficiency increased with spray lubrication rather than dip lubrication. The gear mesh efficiency increased, and thus gear temperatures were reduced, when <b>superfinished</b> gears were used rather than ground gears. A lower gear temperature was measured when gears were spray lubricated at the mesh inlet rather than the mesh outlet. QC 20170314 </p...|$|E

40|$|Gear working {{surfaces}} {{are subjected to}} repeated rolling and sliding contacts, and often designs require loads sufficient to cause eventual fatigue of the surface. This research provides experimental data and analytical tools to further {{the understanding of the}} causal relationship of gear surface roughness to surface fatigue. The research included evaluations and developments of statistical tools for gear fatigue data, experimental evaluation of the surface fatigue lives of <b>superfinished</b> gears with a near-mirror quality, and evaluations of the experiments by analytical methods and surface inspections. Alternative statistical methods were evaluated using Monte Carlo studies leading to a final recommendation to describe gear fatigue data using a Weibull distribution, maximum likelihood estimates of shape and scale parameters, and a presumed zero-valued location parameter. A new method was developed for comparing two datasets by extending the current methods of likelihood-ratio based statistics. The surface fatigue lives of <b>superfinished</b> gears were evaluated by carefully controlled experiments, and it is shown conclusively that superfinishing of gears can provide for significantly greater lives relative to ground gears. The measured life improvement was approximately a factor of five. To assist with application of this finding to products, the experimental condition was evaluated. The fatigue life results were expressed in terms of specific film thickness and shown to be consistent with bearing data. Elastohydrodynamic and stress analyses were completed to relate the stress condition to fatigue. Smooth-surface models do not adequately explain the improved fatigue lives. Based on analyses using a rough surface model, it is concluded that the improved fatigue lives of <b>superfinished</b> gears is due to a reduced rate of near-surface micropitting fatigue processes, not due to any reduced rate of spalling (sub-surface) fatigue processes. To complete the evaluations, surface inspection were completed. The surface topographies of the ground gears changed substantially due to running, but the topographies of the <b>superfinished</b> gears were essentially unchanged with running...|$|E

40|$|With ever shorter {{development}} {{times and}} market demands on overall system performance such as efficiency, reliability and low maintenance, accurate predictive tools are necessary and gear drives {{prove to be}} no exception. All these characteristics {{have an impact on}} a process which has remained a riddle: running-in. Even though no consensus on a definition of this phenomena is readily available, this thesis examines efficiency, surface roughness and simulation through the optics of running-in. Geared transmissions are known for their formidable efficiency and their extreme reliability. However, with an ever increasing power density, the ability to accurately predict mesh losses becomes of utmost importance. The accurate quantification of bearing losses as well as efficiency of ground and <b>superfinished</b> gears under dip lubrication are examined with respect to running-in. Results show a considerable influence on the calculation of gear mesh losses originating from which bearing loss model is chosen. Furthermore, when a larger running-in load is used on ground gears, an increase in efficiency can be observed during working operation, while for <b>superfinished</b> no significant changes are found. These efficiency/frictional changes are also shown to occur in the initial cycles of the running-in phase. From a surface transformation point of view running-in is shown to be a reduction of asperity tips in case hardened ground gears, while in <b>superfinished</b> gears no changes were seen. These gear surface changes were measured with a novel method with a surface profilometer in-situ before, after running-in and after efficiency testing. Results also show that such changes in ground gear roughness profile occur during the very initial cycles. In order to predict running-in, a simulation method was developed. Such method utilizes a 2 D surface integral method to simulate contact between rough surfaces, but requires the use of surface hardness and an accurate lower cutoff wavelength. This cutoff wavelength proved to play a pivotal role in determining an accurate contact pressure at the proper level of granularity, hence a well defined real contact area. The predicted and measured run-in surfaces are compared and are found to be in accordance with each other. QC 20170928 </p...|$|E

With no consen-sus on a definition or observation of running-in of gear drives, measurementsof both efficiency and surface transformation during the predefined running-inis explored. A verified methodology on how to separate form, waviness androughness is presented. Two finishing methods, namely generation groundand <b>superfinished,</b> are analyzed in terms of efficiency and surface characteris-tics as manufactured, after running-in and after efficiency testing in order todetermine the effects of load level during running-in. Results show that separation of form can be achieved with a carefullychosen polynomial, while waviness is more subject to how the user definesa cut-off wavelength for the surface roughness. Ground gears show distinctsmoothening in terms of surface roughness at high running-in load, and nogeneral trend for low load. This behavior is also reflected in the efficiencysince higher loads gave overall lower efficiency after running-in when com-pared to lower loads. <b>Superfinished</b> gears in contrast show no running-in ef-fects in terms of efficiency. Additionally, ground gears exhibit general changein friction and surface roughness during the first cycles of running-in whenanalyzing high load. Overall gains in efficiency can be obtained from running-in; however, at most speeds improvements from polishing a surface, in thiscase superfinishing, proved to lead to higher efficiency.

40|$|A plasma {{enhanced}} chemical {{vapour deposition}} (PECVD) amorphous carbon coating was deposited onto 100 Cr 6 steel substrates having varying degrees of surface roughness. The samples were subsequently evaluated to determine the correlation between substrate roughness and coating performance. The steel substrates were prepared before coating deposition to attain five different levels of roughness: (a) ground; (b) <b>superfinished</b> (SF); (c) polished to 1000 grit; (d) polished to 220 grit and (e) polished to a 1 μm diamond finish. The aim of the investigation {{was to determine the}} degree of finish required for good tribological performance and coating adhesion. The mechanical and tribological properties of the samples were assessed by nanoindentation, ramped load scratch testing, and pin on disk wear testing. Nanoindentation testing was used to determine the hardness of the samples and the relative contributions to the system hardness from the substrate and coating were separated using the model of Korsunsky et al. Nanoindentation testing showed that the coating hardness (when separated from the system hardness) was lower for the samples with the SF substrate than the others: the reasons for this are discussed in the light of Raman measurements on the fractions of diamond-like and graphite-like bonding in the coatings. Ramped load scratch testing was used to determine coating adhesion and the scratch test failure mode. With the exception of the samples with the ground substrate finish, studies of the friction coefficient plots during scratch testing showed little variation between the samples, and SEM imaging revealed a common failure mode of severe spallation at the scratch track border. The samples with the ground substrate showed differences in response between scratches parallel and perpendicular to the grinding direction, with scratches parallel to the grinding direction showing more severe spallation. The average critical load to failure, as determined by the point of first failure in the scanning electron microscope, was lower for the coatings on the SF substrate than the coatings on the 220 grit, 1000 grit and 1 micron finished substrates. The critical load to failure for the samples with ground substrates was lower than the other substrate surface finishes. Pin on disk wear testing of the samples against a steel ball revealed that the major effect of the varying substrate roughness was on the wear of the counterface, with rougher substrate finishes generally resulting in higher wear rates of the counterface, although the smoothest substrate finish, the micrometre finish, also resulted in higher wear. The sample whose substrate was <b>superfinished</b> gave least wear of the counterface and this was therefore the optimum finish for the samples when considering their performance in a tribological couple...|$|E
