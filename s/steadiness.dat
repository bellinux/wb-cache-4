5|$|I {{remember}} {{most of the}} video you had shot with the crane, some Steadicam, plus some panning. So you have about five different cameras shooting a performance, and after they edit like crazy. It gives {{you a lot of}} freedom, but I feel very frustrated because I like to see somebody dancing. I hate when there's too much editing. I like the <b>steadiness</b> of the performance because then you can really enjoy the movement of the body. You see the skill.|$|E
5|$|Cleansing asanas {{are those}} that when practiced for {{short periods of time}} help the body prevent or correct {{internal}} imbalances and tone inner organs; while meditative asanas are those postures, either sitting or standing, that one can maintain steadily and comfortably for extended periods of time. In both, a proper posture is achieved when one can combine relaxed <b>steadiness</b> with deep breathing exercises. Such comfortable and stable asanas are necessary for cleansing of the Nadi (blood vessels) through the Pranayama stage of yoga. This view is shared by other yoga texts, such as in verse 5.2 of Gheranda Samhita. The Padmasana (lotus position) is esteemed for both cleansing and meditative contemplation.|$|E
5|$|Early in the 1889–90 Australian season, Trumble {{endured a}} period where {{he was not able}} to take wickets consistently. With {{selection}} of the Australian team to tour England in 1890 due at this time, Trumble was anxious about this poor run of form. Noting his anxiety while playing, a friend offered him a beer during the lunch break to revive his spirits. Previously a teetotaler, Trumble enjoyed his first taste and ordered another before re-entering the field of play. Feeling relaxed, although wondering about his <b>steadiness</b> of step, Trumble took a succession of wickets to ensure his selection in the Australian team. Trumble finished the season with 27wickets at an average of 14.20 per wicket.|$|E
5|$|The {{first two}} rounds were played Thursday and the final two rounds on Friday. Strong's fine results in the {{first two rounds}} put him on 149, tied for second place with Ray, two strokes behind the second round leader, Vardon, who stood at 147. Strong's play was {{remarkable}} for its <b>steadiness,</b> rather than any particular brilliancy, as he methodically hit fairways and greens and seldom found himself in trouble. Strong beat or tied eventual winner Francis Ouimet in rounds 1, 2 and 4. A disappointing third round 82, however, ruined any chance he had to win the tournament and he would eventually finish on 310, +18 to par, for a ninth-place finish. He won $40 as his share of the purse.|$|E
5|$|The Ottoman attackers dug {{themselves}} in {{on a line}} through Balin and Berkusie while the line {{taken up by the}} Australian Mounted Division began with the 3rd Light Horse Brigade facing east on a line running due north from about half way between Iraq el Menshiye and Summil. The line then turned westward so the 5th Mounted Brigade faced northwards in front of Summil with the 4th Light Horse Brigade to their left in front of Ipseir and connecting with the right of the infantry division; the 75th Division at Suafir esh Sharqiye. A critical situation created by the strong Ottoman attacking forces had been controlled by the coolness and <b>steadiness</b> of the troops, especially the machine-gun squadrons of the 5th Mounted and the 4th Light Horse Brigades. The Australian Mounted Division suffered about 50 casualties mainly from the 5th Mounted Brigade.|$|E
25|$|Steady flows {{are often}} more {{tractable}} than otherwise similar unsteady flows. The governing equations of a steady problem have one dimension fewer (time) than the governing equations of the same problem without {{taking advantage of the}} <b>steadiness</b> of the flow field.|$|E
25|$|During these cavalry attacks, the Prussian infantry, already exhausted, {{and broken}} up into {{separate}} divisions by the desperate contest in the valley, had collected {{together at the}} outlets of the villages. Some of the regiments presented a remarkable degree of <b>steadiness</b> and good order.|$|E
25|$|Zopiclone, {{similar to}} other benzodiazepines and nonbenzodiazepine {{hypnotic}} drugs, causes impairments in body balance and standing <b>steadiness</b> in individuals who wake up at night or the next morning. Falls and hip fractures are frequently reported. The combination with alcohol consumption increases these impairments. Partial, but incomplete tolerance develops to these impairments.|$|E
25|$|Jesup's {{action and}} the <b>steadiness</b> of Scott's brigade {{nevertheless}} persuaded Drummond to withdraw his centre to maintain alignment with his left flank, and also pull back the Glengarry Light Infantry, who had been harassing Scott's own left flank. The withdrawal of Drummond's centre left the artillery exposed {{in front of the}} infantry.|$|E
25|$|Triazolam, {{similar to}} other benzodiazepines and nonbenzodiazepines, causes {{impairments}} in body balance and standing <b>steadiness</b> in individuals who wake up at night or the next morning.

There can be daytime withdrawal effects.|$|E
25|$|During the 17th and 18th centuries the Swiss Guards {{maintained}} {{a reputation for}} discipline and <b>steadiness</b> in both peacetime service and foreign campaigning. Their officers were all Swiss and their rate of pay substantially {{higher than that of}} the regular French soldiers. Internal discipline was {{maintained a}}ccording to Swiss codes which were significantly harsher than those of the regular French Army.|$|E
25|$|Tyrone {{then went}} on to win the Ulster Championship, beating Down in a replay, but with a massive margin of victory. After leaking four goals in the drawn match, Harte put Cormac McAnallen into the Full Back {{position}}, from his normal position in midfield. It turned out to be a wry move, Tyrone's ruthlessness in shooting at the posts, was now consolidated with a <b>steadiness</b> in defence.|$|E
25|$|Coupled {{with the}} {{brilliant}} coloration, is an excellence in the painted details. This is particularly {{apparent in the}} features of the figures which show a mastery over the handling of a difficult medium that, in their earlier works, few of their contemporaries could equal, each fine line of paint being applied with the <b>steadiness</b> of hand and elegance of form of a master calligrapher.|$|E
25|$|The 5th Brigade (Tippelskirch's) {{was in full}} retreat upon Marbais {{when the}} 1st and 2nd Battalions of the 22nd Regiment still {{continued}} posted on the high road, {{not far from the}} Trois Burettes. The good order and perfect <b>steadiness</b> of these Battalions, which were commanded by Major Sack, completely checked the further advance of the French cavalry, and greatly facilitated the retreat of the Prussian troops.|$|E
25|$|According to Vishnu Purana and Padma Purana, Daksha and {{his wife}} Prasuti had 24 daughters. The names of these 24 daughters are Sraddha (Faith), Srilakshmi (Prosperity), Dhriti (<b>Steadiness),</b> Thushti (Resignation), Pushti (Thriving), Medha (Intelligence), Kriya (Action, Devotion), Buddhika (Intellect), Lajja (Modesty), Vapu (Body), Santi (Expiation), Siddhika (Perfection), Kirtti (Fame), Khyati (Celebrity), Sati (Truth), Sambhuti (Fitness), Smriti (Memory), Priti (Affection), Kshama (Forgiveness), Sannati (Humility), Anasuya (lit. without jealousy), Urjja (Energy), Swaha (Offering), and Swadha (Oblation).|$|E
25|$|In 1951, he bowled {{with great}} <b>steadiness</b> against the South Africans, taking 3 for 176 {{in the first}} innings on a featherbed pitch at Headingley during the fourth Test Match. He toured India the {{following}} winter, but was criticised in Wisden as lacking the ability to exploit the Indian type of pitch. Despite this, at Kanpur in the Fourth Test he took nine wickets in the match, and led England to victory, alongside his off-spinning Lancastrian colleague Roy Tattersall.|$|E
25|$|Usually {{the walls}} of Incan {{buildings}} were slightly inclined inside and the corners were rounded. This, in combination with masonry thoroughness, led Incan buildings to have a peerless seismic resistance thanks to high static and dynamic <b>steadiness,</b> absence of resonant frequencies and stress concentration points. During an earthquake with a small or moderate magnitude, masonry was stable, and during a strong earthquake stone blocks were “ dancing ” near their normal positions and lay down exactly in right order after an earthquake.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{his return}} to Paris, Sargent quickly {{received}} several portrait commissions. His career was launched. He immediately demonstrated the concentration and stamina that enabled him to paint with workman-like <b>steadiness</b> for the next twenty-five years. He filled in the gaps between commissions with many non-commissioned portraits of friends and colleagues. His fine manners, perfect French, and great skill made him a standout among the newer portraitists, and his fame quickly spread. He confidently set high prices and turned down unsatisfactory sitters. He mentored his friend Emil Fuchs who was learning to paint portraits in oils.|$|E
25|$|Temazepam, {{similar to}} other benzodiazepines and nonbenzodiazepine {{hypnotic}} drugs, causes impairments in body balance and standing <b>steadiness</b> in individuals who wake up at night or the next morning. Falls and hip fractures are frequently reported. The combination with alcohol increases these impairments. Partial but incomplete tolerance develops to these impairments. The smallest possible effective dose {{should be used in}} elderly or very ill patients, as a risk of apnea and/or cardiac arrest exists. This risk is increased when temazepam is given concomitantly with other drugs that depress the central nervous system (CNS).|$|E
25|$|However, {{he moved}} to England in 1903 to join the Lord's ground staff and played a number of matches for the MCC while {{qualifying}} for Middlesex. In these, he showed himself developing into a left-arm spinner of above average pace but with nothing beyond <b>steadiness</b> when pitches did not help him. In 1904, he showed development as a solid right-handed batsman, and in 1905, when fully qualified, he was a valuable aid to Middlesex. his superb batting on a difficult pitch to draw the game with Essex at Leyton showed he was a player of exceptional resolution during the most difficult crisis.|$|E
25|$|Britain had {{occupied}} Egypt and controlled the Egyptian government after invading {{the country during}} the 19th century. At {{the beginning of the}} war, Britain set up the Protectorate of Egypt and imposed Martial Law, giving a solemn pledge to defend Egypt and not call on the Egyptian people to aid them in the conflict. However, the British quickly came to realise they desperately needed the support of Egyptian labour, camel drivers and their camels in a land that was so inhospitable to Europeans. The great value of this service was also acknowledged by General Allenby in his Despatch of 16 December 1917 where he mentions their <b>steadiness</b> under fire and devotion to duty.|$|E
25|$|During the Orange Revolution in Ukraine, Rotaru, {{together}} with her family, sent food packages to {{people who came to}} the Maidan Nezalezhnosti, regardless of their political affiliation. In 2006 Rotaru took active part in parliamentary elections in Ukraine, balloting for the deputy chair as a second number in the list of Volodymyr Lytvyn's political formation Lytvyn Bloc; however, the bloc could not gather enough votes to enter Parliament, one of the major surprises of the elections. She held an all-Ukrainian charitable campaign tour the same year. Rotaru cited her personal trust of Lytvyn and his <b>steadiness,</b> as well as her own interest in lobbying for arts issues in Ukraine. As a Crimean resident, she refused Russian citizenship following Russia's annexation of the peninsula.|$|E
25|$|It is {{interesting}} to note the similarities and differences in the experiences of the Whiteoak family and de la Roche's. While the lives and successes of the Whiteoaks rise and fall, there remained for them the <b>steadiness</b> of the family manor, known as Jalna. De la Roche's family endured the illness of her mother, the perpetual job searches of her father, and the adoption of her orphaned cousin while being moved 17 times. Several critics believe that Finch Whiteoak who majors in Finch's Fortune (1932) is a reflection of de la Roche herself. He was a somewhat tortured concert pianist with overtones of gayness. The names of many of the characters were taken from gravestones in a Newmarket, Ontario cemetery.|$|E
25|$|Ögedei {{was also}} {{known to be}} a humble man, who did not believe himself to be a genius, and who was willing to listen to and use the great generals that his father left him, as well as those he himself found to be most capable. He was the Emperor (Khagan) but not a dictator. Like all Mongols at his time, he was raised and educated as a warrior from childhood, and as the son of Genghis Khan, he was a part of his father's plan to {{establish}} a world empire. His military experience was notable for his willingness to listen to his generals and adapt to circumstances. He was an extremely pragmatic person, much like his father, and looked at the end rather than the means. His <b>steadiness</b> of character and dependability were the traits that his father most valued, and that gained him the role of successor to his father, despite his two older brothers.|$|E
25|$|With the {{relieving}} force dispensed with, {{the capture}} of the fort resumed. On 3 April the 3rd Bombay European Regiment moved into position to attack the city wall {{on either side of}} the Orcha Gate. Two attacking formations of one hundred men each, the left column led by Captain Robison, 3rd Bombay European Regiment, the right by Lieutenant-Colonel Liddell, advanced with great <b>steadiness</b> through a very heavy fire of musketry and wall pieces towards the ladders, on reaching which they were assailed with rockets, earthen pots filled with powder and various projectiles. But a serious miscalculation had occurred – the ladders used by the 3rd Europeans were found in some instances too short, in others too weak, breaking under the men. The regiment came under heavy fire, who despite some minor success in scaling the walls with many acts of gallantry and being reinforced by another 100 men of the 3rd Bombay European Regiment, was eventually forced to retire. A parallel attack on the left flank of the fort by the 86th Regiment succeeded in breaching the wall and a party from the 3rd Bombay European Regiment led by Captain Robison followed the 86th through the breach. Lt. Col. Liddell, on finding his ladders of no use, ordered Lt. Goodfellow, Bombay Engineers, to try a bag of powder at a postern but no entry could be effected. By the time, Captain Robison had made good his lodgment, and was followed by the right column. Pushing on for the Palace, the 3rd Bombay European Regiment were engaged in difficult street fighting until the Palace was reached and jointly captured by the 3rd Bombay European Regiment and 86th Regiment, though both regiments suffered casualties when the enemy ignited a powder room causing an explosion.|$|E
25|$|The drug {{causes a}} delay in the onset, and {{decrease}} in the duration of REM sleep. Following discontinuation of the drug, REM sleep rebound {{has been reported in}} some studies. Nitrazepam is reported to significantly affect stages of sleep - a decrease in stage 1, 3, and 4 sleep and an increase in stage 2. In young volunteers, the pharmacological properties of nitrazepam were found to produce sedation and impaired psychomotor performance and standing <b>steadiness.</b> EEG tests showed decreased alpha activity and increased the beta activity, according to blood plasma levels of nitrazepam. Performance was significantly impaired 13 hours after dosing with nitrazepam, as were decision-making skills. EEG tests show more drowsiness and light sleep 18 hours after nitrazepam intake, more so than amylobarbitone. Fast activity was recorded via EEG 18 hours after nitrazepam dosing. An animal study demonstrated that nitrazepam induces a drowsy pattern of spontaneous EEG including high-voltage slow waves and spindle bursts increase in the cortex and amygdala, while the hippocampal theta rhythm is desynchronized. Also low-voltage fast waves occur particularly in the cortical EEG. The EEG arousal response to auditory stimulation and to electric stimulation of the mesencephalic reticular formation, posterior hypothalamus and centromedian thalamus is significantly suppressed. The photic driving response elicited by a flash light in the visual cortex is also suppressed by nitrazepam. Estazolam was found to be more potent however. Nitrazepam increases the slow wave light sleep (SWLS) in a dose-dependent manner whilst suppressing deep sleep stages. Less time is spent in stages 3 and 4 which are the deep sleep stages, when benzodiazepines such as nitrazepam are used. Benzodiazepines are therefore not good hypnotics in the treatment of insomnia. The suppression of deep sleep stages by benzodiazepines may be especially problematic to the elderly as they naturally spend less time in the deep sleep stage.|$|E
25|$|Nitrazepam, {{similar to}} other benzodiazepines and nonbenzodiazepines, causes {{impairments}} in body balance and standing <b>steadiness</b> in individuals who wake up at night or the next morning. Falls and hip fractures are frequently reported. Combination with alcohol increases these impairments. Partial but incomplete tolerance develops to these impairments. Nitrazepam {{has been found to}} be dangerous in elderly patients due to a significantly increased risk of falls. This increased risk is probably due to the drug effects of nitrazepam persisting well into the next day. Nitrazepam is a particularly unsuitable hypnotic for the elderly as it induces a disability characterised by general mental deterioration, inability to walk, incontinence, dysarthric, confusion, stumbling, falls, and disoriention which can occur from doses as low as 5mg. The nitrazepam-induced symptomatology can lead to a misdiagnosis of brain disease in the elderly, for example dementia, and can also lead to the symptoms of postural hypotension which may also be misdiagnosed. A geriatric unit reportedly was seeing as many as seven patients a month with nitrazepam-induced disabilities and health problems. The drug was recommended to join the barbiturates in not being prescribed to the elderly. Only nitrazepam and lorazepam were found to increase the risk of falls and fractures in the elderly. CNS depression occurs much more frequently in the elderly and is especially common in doses above 5mg of nitrazepam. Both young and old patients report sleeping better after three nights' use of nitrazepam, but they also reported feeling less awake and were slower on psychomotor testing up to 36 hours after intake of nitrazepam. The elderly showed cognitive deficits, making significantly more mistakes in psychomotor testing than younger patients despite similar plasma levels of the drug, suggesting the elderly are more sensitive to nitrazepam due to increased sensitivity of the aging brain to it. Confusion and disorientation can result from chronic nitrazepam administration to elderly subjects. Also, the effects of a single dose of nitrazepam may last up to 60 hours after administration.|$|E
