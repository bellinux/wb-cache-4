5000|$|On 23 November, Mayor of Nagoya Takashi Kawamura, {{former state}} {{minister}} Shizuka Kamei and former farm minister Masahiko Yamada joined forces together to launch Tax Cuts Japan - Oppose TPP - Zero Nuclear Party as another [...] "third pole" [...] national political party. On 28 November, the Governor of Shiga Yukiko Kada in Ōtsu announced {{the establishment of}} an anti-nuclear and equal gender party known as the Tomorrow Party of Japan becoming the second national party based outside of Tokyo. Concurrent the DPJ <b>splitter</b> <b>group,</b> People's Life First president Ichirō Ozawa dissolved the party and merged into the Tomorrow Party. Tax Cuts Japan - Oppose TPP - Zero Nuclear Party and Japan Future Party are negotiating to merge parties to further counter the major parties and the pro-nuclear parties. On 27 November Tax Cuts Japan - Oppose TPP - Zero Nuclear Party officially announced they would merge with Tomorrow, with party co-leader Mashahiko Yamada saying [...] "We would also like to raise our hands in joining because our ways of thinking are the same." ...|$|E
40|$|We {{found an}} {{interesting}} relation between convex optimization and sorting problem. We present a parallel algorithm to compute multiple order statistics {{of the data}} by minimizing a number of related convex functions. The computed order statistics serve as <b>splitters</b> that <b>group</b> the data into buckets suitable for parallel bitonic sorting. This led us to a parallel bucket sort algorithm, which we implemented for many-core architecture of graphics processing units (GPUs). The proposed sorting method is competitive to the state-of-the-art GPU sorting algorithms and is superior to most of them for long sorting keys...|$|R
40|$|Thirty {{animals were}} divided into three <b>splitter</b> <b>groups</b> of ten and were placed upon a half-hour feeding rhythm, then brought {{together}} and studied. The conclusions that were made from this experiment may be stated as follows: 1. Rats run without food {{at the end of}} maze, when a reward was presented, and did not show significantly large decreases in time and error scores. 2. The hypothesis that frequency is a factor {{in the development of a}} cognitive map in a maze situation seems to receive no support from this investigation. 3. The introduction of reward after a period of non-reward did not appear to alter the difficulty of the blinds as significantly as hypothesized by Tolman-Honzik. (a) The non-goal-pointing blinds did not appear to become relatively less difficult during the reward period of the non-reward group. Group II increased the percentage of total errors from 56 percent in the non-reward situation to 64 percent in the reward situation. (b) The goal-pointing blinds decreased slightly in difficulty with the introduction of reward for the non-reward group. Group II decreased the percentage of total errors from 44 percent in the non-reward situation to 37 percent in the reward situation. (c) A hypothesis that the animals anticipated the next to the last correct turn of the maze was suggested by the increases in the total errors in right-turn blind alleys. Group II increased the percentage of total errors in right-turn blinds from 38 percent in the non-reward situation to 65 perent in the reward situation. 4. In the comparison of the methods of recorded errors which were used by Tolman-Honzik and by Reynolds, there was no significant difference in the final result. All the ratio computed upon the present decrease in error did not give a result significant to the five percent level. Advisor: William J. Arnol...|$|R
40|$|Philip Hall raised around 1965 the {{following}} question which is stated in the Kourovka Notebook [11, p. 88]: Is there a non-trivial group which is isomorphic with every proper extension of itself by itself? We will decompose the problem into two parts: We want to find non-commutative <b>splitters,</b> that are <b>groups</b> G ̸ = 1 with Ext (G, G) = 1. The class of splitters fortunately is quite large so that extra properties {{can be added to}} G. We can consider groups G with {{the following}} properties: There is a complete group L with cartesian product L ω ∼ = G, Hom (L ω, Sω) = 0 (Sω the infinite symmetric group acting on ω) and End (L, L) = Inn L ∪ { 0 }. We will show that these properties ensure that G is a splitter and hence obviously a Hall-group in the above sense. Then we will apply a recent result from our joint paper [8] which also shows that such groups exist, in fact there is a class of Hall-groups which is not a set. ...|$|R
