5|$|The abdomen has no {{appendages}} {{except those}} that have been modified to form one to four (usually three) pairs of short, movable spinnerets, which emit silk. Each <b>spinneret</b> has many spigots, each of which is connected to one silk gland. There are at least six types of silk gland, each producing a different type of silk.|$|E
5|$|Some spiders have a cribellum, a {{modified}} <b>spinneret</b> {{with up to}} 40,000 spigots, each of which produces a single very fine fiber. The fibers are pulled out by the calamistrum, a comb-like set of bristles on the jointed tip of the cribellum, and combined into a composite woolly thread that is very effective in snagging the bristles of insects. The earliest spiders had cribella, which produced the first silk capable of capturing insects, before spiders developed silk coated with sticky droplets. However, most modern groups of spiders have lost the cribellum.|$|E
5|$|Caterpillars have short {{antennae}} {{and several}} simple eyes. The mouthparts are adapted for chewing with powerful mandibles {{and a pair}} maxillae, each with a segmented palp. Adjoining these is the labium-hypopharynx which houses a tubular <b>spinneret</b> which is able to extrude silk. Butterfly caterpillars have three pairs of true legs on the thoracic segments and up to six pairs of prolegs arising from the abdominal segments. These prolegs have rings of tiny hooks called crochets that are engaged hydrostatically and help the caterpillar grip the substrate. The epidermis bears tufts of setae, the position and number of which help in identifying the species. There is also decoration {{in the form of}} hairs, wart-like protuberances, horn-like protuberances and spines. Internally, most of the body cavity is taken up by the gut, but there may also be large silk glands, and special glands which secrete distasteful or toxic substances. The developing wings are present in later stage instars and the gonads start development in the egg stage.|$|E

25|$|As {{an example}} of a complex {{spinning}} field, the <b>spinneret</b> apparatus of an adult Araneus diadematus (garden cross spider) consists of the glands shown below. Similar multiple gland architecture exists in the black widow spider.|$|E
25|$|The gland's visible, or external, part is {{termed the}} <b>spinneret.</b> Depending on the {{complexity}} of the species, spiders will have two to eight spinnerets, usually in pairs. There exist highly different specialised glands in different spiders, ranging from simply a sac with an opening at one end, to the complex, multiple-section major ampullate glands of the golden silk orb-weavers.|$|E
25|$|Spiders produce silk {{from their}} <b>spinneret</b> glands {{located at the}} tip of their abdomen. Each gland {{produces}} a thread for a special purpose – for example a trailed safety line, sticky silk for trapping prey or fine silk for wrapping it. Spiders use different gland types to produce different silks, and some spiders are capable of producing up to eight different silks during their lifetime.|$|E

25|$|One {{approach}} {{that does not}} involve farming spiders is to extract the spider silk gene and use other organisms to produce the spider silk. Working under the trademark BioSteel, in 2000 Canadian biotechnology company Nexia successfully produced spider silk protein in transgenic goats that carried the gene for it; the milk produced by the goats contained significant quantities of the protein, 1–2grams of silk proteins per litre of milk. Attempts to spin the protein into a fibre similar to natural spider silk resulted in fibres with tenacities of 2–3grams per denier. Nexia used wet spinning and squeezed the silk protein solution through small extrusion holes in order to simulate {{the behavior of the}} <b>spinneret,</b> but this procedure has so far not been sufficient to replicate the properties of native spider silk.|$|E
25|$|Electrospinning is {{a highly}} {{versatile}} technique {{that can be used}} to produce continuous fibers from submicrometer to nanometer diameters. In a typical electrospinning set-up, a solution is fed through a <b>spinneret</b> and a high voltage is applied to the tip. The buildup of electrostatic repulsion within the charged solution, causes it to eject a thin fibrous stream. A mounted collector plate or rod with an opposite or grounded charge draws in the continuous fibers, which arrive to form a highly porous network. The primary advantages of this technique are its simplicity and ease of variation. At a laboratory level, a typical electrospinning set-up only requires a high voltage power supply (up to 30 kV), a syringe, a flat tip needle and a conducting collector. For these reasons, electrospinning has become a common method of scaffold manufacture in many labs. By modifying variables such as the distance to collector, magnitude of applied voltage, or solution flow rate—researchers can dramatically change the overall scaffold architecture.|$|E
500|$|When the larva attains {{its maximum}} size, it pupates and {{undergoes}} metamorphosis. It makes a globular cocoon of sand or other local substrate stuck together with fine silk spun from a slender <b>spinneret</b> {{at the rear}} end of the body. [...] The cocoon may be buried several centimetres deep in sand. After completing its transformation into an adult insect {{over the course of}} about one month, it emerges from the case, leaving the pupal integument behind, and works its way to the surface. After about twenty minutes, the adult's wings are fully opened and it flies off in search of a mate. The adult is considerably larger than the larva as antlions exhibit the greatest disparity in size between larva and adult of any type of holometabolous insect. This is by virtue {{of the fact that the}} exoskeleton of the adult is extremely thin and flimsy, with an exceptionally low mass per unit of volume. [...] The adult typically lives for about 25 days, but some insects survive for as long as 45 days.|$|E

2500|$|The {{solution}} was [...] "cloudy, opalescent upon being stirred, and of low viscosity" [...] and usually was thrown away. However, Kwolek persuaded the technician, Charles Smullen, {{who ran the}} <b>spinneret,</b> to test her solution, and was amazed {{to find that the}} fiber did not break, unlike nylon. Her supervisor and her laboratory director understood the significance of her accidental discovery and a new field of polymer chemistry quickly arose. By 1971, modern Kevlar was introduced. However, Kwolek was not very involved in developing the applications of Kevlar.|$|E
2500|$|Plastic {{drawing is}} {{primarily}} used in manufacturing plastic fibers. The process {{was discovered by}} Julian W. Hill (1904–1996) in 1930 while trying to make fibers from an early polyester. It is performed after the material has been [...] "spun" [...] into filaments; by extruding the polymer melt through pores of a <b>spinneret.</b> During this process, the individual polymer chains tend to somewhat align because of viscous flow. These filaments still have an amorphous structure, so they are drawn to align the fibers further, thus increasing crystallinity, tensile strength and stiffness. This is done on a draw twister machine.|$|E

5000|$|Common to each {{of these}} methods is the use of a <b>spinneret,</b> a device {{containing}} a needle through which solvent is extruded and an annulus through which a polymer solution is extruded. As the polymer is extruded through the annulus of the <b>spinneret,</b> it retains a hollow cylindrical shape. As the polymer exits the <b>spinneret,</b> it solidifies into a membrane through a process known as phase inversion. The properties of the membrane -such as average pore diameter and membrane thickness- can be finely tuned by changing the dimensions of the <b>spinneret,</b> temperature and composition of [...] "dope" [...] (polymer) and [...] "bore" [...] (solvent) solutions, length of air gap (for dry-jet wet spinning), temperature and composition of the coagulant, as well as the speed at which produced fiber is collected by a motorized spool. Extrusion of the polymer and solvent through the <b>spinneret</b> can be accomplished either through the use of gas-extrusion or a metered pump. Some of the polymers most commonly used for fabricating HFMs include cellulose acetate, polysulfone, polyethersulfone, and polyvinylidene fluoride.|$|E
