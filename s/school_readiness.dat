5|$|In 1995 a {{longitudinal}} study was conducted at the University of Kansas, the first large-scale evaluation of Sesame Street's cognitive effects in over twenty years. Its findings supported those of previous studies: early viewing of educational children's television appeared to contribute to children's <b>school</b> <b>readiness.</b> Children from disadvantaged backgrounds learned as much as advantaged children per hour of viewing, {{but they did not}} watch enough to gain the program's maximum benefit. In comparing the effects of watching Sesame Street with other programs, commercial entertainment and cartoons had a negative effect; watching Sesame Street daily did not increase children's viewing of other categories of television, nor make them less likely to participate in other educational activities.|$|E

Children attending a kindergarten were less likely to have impaired speech or impaired motor development. Only 50% of children whose parents did not graduate from school are ready for school at age six. If such children were enrolled in a high-quality three-year Kindergarten programme, 87% were ready for school at age six. Thus Kindergarten helps to overcome unequal opportunities.|$|E

The National, for example, stated, [...] " [...] At a time when Arab children are increasingly deviating from their language and culture because of programming from nations like the United States and India, initiatives like this will help to reverse the trend". Abdulla Al Sharhan, the new show's creative director, agreed: [...] "We are losing our language, and so through Iftah Ya Simsim, we can revive the language {{in such a way}} that a child learns proper Arabic in a fun way". As with the original, outreach was an important part of the new show. Even before the show aired, four characters from the original toured the region, educating young children and their families about road and car safety. The cast and crew took a break from filming for a few months for [...] "constant live events" [...] to interact with their young viewers. Books, DVDs, CDs, online material and outreach programs for children, parents, and teachers were produced.|$|E

Questions were all in multiple-choice format. Each subtest was given a single score, and the total score was derived from the sum of the scores from the subtests. The total score ranged from 200–800. The individual scores helped medical school admission committees to differentiate the individual abilities among their candidates. Admission committees, however, did not consider the [...] "understanding modern society" [...] section to be of great importance, even though it was created to reward those with broad liberal arts skills, which included knowledge of history, government, economics, and sociology. Committees placed greater emphasis on scores on the scientific achievement section as it was a better predictor of performance in medical school.|$|E

The research covers four fundamental problems in technology ownership that add costs to schools and create problems for educators: (1) lack of technical expertise; (2) lack of sustained funding; (3) lack of incentive to manage technology efficiently; and (4) difficulties in managing technology programs. Three State policies are recommended to help schools and school districts identify, plan, and manage TCO for technology. The first requires schools to have separate budget accounts for technology in the school budget. The second divides State funding into four phases with each contingent on a <b>school's</b> <b>readiness</b> to proceed to the next phase. The third creates incentives for school districts to provide technology support more efficiently. Appendices provide the best practices for each phase of the life cycle of owning and managing technology, and descriptions and overviews of each of the study's schools and the school district.

Multiple grade retention means that a student has been retained in grade or “left back” more than once. These students are referred to within this study as “Multiple Holdovers” (MHO).

What is the relationship between the importance of ICT use for 21 st Century Skill Development and obstructions hindering ICT goals in the light of currently available Human Resources in South African schools? A Spearman’s rho correlation was calculated, using SITES 2006 data obtained from the Principal Questionnaire (Brese & Carstens, 2009). It was found that all of the influencing factors, pertaining to both Infrastructure and Human Resources, showed a weak, to very weak negative correlation with the ICT goals under question. This means that, though the relationship is not strong, the influencing factors are hindering schools from reaching ICT goals for 21 st Century Skills Development.
