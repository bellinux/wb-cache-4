Vagus nerve stimulation is sometimes called vagal nerve stimulation. With vagus nerve stimulation, a device called a pulse generator is surgically implanted in the chest.

5000|$|The amorphosynthesis {{of sensory}} stimuli is {{associated}} with different perceptual and conceptual effects relative to the severity of damage to the parietal lobe. The degree of sensory suppression has been explored with bilateral and ipsilateral double <b>stimulation</b> <b>methods</b> in patients with either extensive or superficial parietal lesions. Complete extinction is commonly observed in which patients with extensive right parietal damage show complete and constant inattention to tactile stimuli on the contralesional side of the body. Incomplete extinction is frequently associated with lesions that are less extensive or superficial in nature. This phenomenon is supported by studies showing that if two stimuli are simultaneously applied to {{both sides of the}} body, the patient their eyes closed will ignore the stimulus that is applied to the affected side and report a tactile sensation from the unaffected side alone. If each side of the body is separately stimulated, then each stimulus is correctly reported without delay. Incomplete sensory suppression has also been observed using ipsilateral double stimulation {{to one side of the}} body. Results indicate that stimulation to a proximal and distal segment example, the face and hand on one side of the body will result in a distal hand stimulus suppression, to which the patient will report feeling only the proximal face stimulation. Further evidence suggests that the parietal lobe gives rise to the processing of attention and awareness that is necessary for sensory perception. In studies of double stimulation in which the patient has their eyes open, incomplete extinction is eliminated when attention is directed to the application of stimulus on the affected side. This phenomenon is not observed in patients with complete extinction in which there is extensive damage to the parietal lobe, suggesting that the subsequent sensory suppression is not affected by expectant attention ...|$|E

The chronaxietimes of grey matter were reported asbeing 380 +/- 191 ms and 200±700 ms. Interpretations ofchronaxie times are further confounded by additional factors. Thechronaxie times reported for soma and dendrites have been establishedusing intracellular pulses that cannot be readily extrapolated to extra-cellular stimuli. Datareported in the literature use either motor response as the physiologicalthreshold in humans or action potential generation in animals. Theseare largely based on stimulation through a macro-electrode, which inthe case of humans is a 1.5 Â 1.2-mm DBS electrode. Data derived from micro-electrodestimulation and physiological mapping of sensory thalamus are scarce.The two <b>stimulation</b> <b>methods</b> may result in significantly differentresults. Few studies have attempted to correlatechronaxie times with sensory perception, although understandingthe neural elements that are involved in a subjective percept, suchas tingling, has important physiological implications.The measurements were taken with different types of electrodes and with stimulators having unknown output impedances. The chronaxie values for human arm sensory nerves rangefrom 0.35 to 1.17 ms, a ratio of 3.3. The values were obtained with insufficient information to establishthe cause of variability. The chronaxie values for human denervated skeletal muscle ranges from 9.5 to 30 ms at body temperature, representing aratio of 3.16. A reduction in chronaxie occurs during reinnervation. The published values for chronaxie have a wide range. If chronaxie is the best descriptor of tissueexcitability in a homogeneous tissue specimen, at a known temperature, it should be determined with a constant-current stimulator providing a rectangular cathodal stimulus waveform.Chronaxie is derived from the strength-duration curve for current and it shows that if the stimulus duration is shorter than chronaxie, more current is required to stimulate,with any type or location of electrodes with a stimulator of any known or unknown output impedance.In addition, the chronaxie value, however determined, identifies the pulse duration for minimum energy. In addition,the charge delivered at chronaxie, however determined, is 2, twice the minimum charge. Therefore, if minimum charge delivery is sought to prolong the life of a battery in an implantedstimulator, a pulse duration of less than the measured chronaxie should be selected; a duration of one-tenth chronaxie providesa charge that is only 10% above the minimum charge.|$|E

40|$|A {{plethora of}} {{antimicrobial}} strategies {{are being developed}} to address prosthetic infection. The currently available methods for implant infection treatment {{include the use of}} antibiotics and revision surgery. Among the bacterial strains, Staphylococcus species pose significant challenges particularly, with regard to hospital acquired infections. In order to combat such life threatening infectious diseases, researchers have developed implantable biomaterials incorporating nanoparticles, antimicrobial reinforcements, surface coatings, slippery/non-adhesive and contact killing surfaces. This review discusses a few of the biomaterial and biophysical antimicrobial strategies, which are in the developmental stage and actively being pursued by several research groups. The clinical efficacy of biophysical <b>stimulation</b> <b>methods</b> such as ultrasound, electric and magnetic field treatments against prosthetic infection depends critically on the stimulation protocol and parameters of the treatment modality. A common thread among the three biophysical <b>stimulation</b> <b>methods</b> is the mechanism of bactericidal action, which is centered on biophysical rupture of bacterial membranes, the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and bacterial membrane depolarization evoked by the interference of essential ion-transport. Although the extent of antimicrobial effect, normally achieved through biophysical stimulation protocol is insufficient to warrant therapeutic application, a combination of antibiotic/ROS inducing agents and biophysical <b>stimulation</b> <b>methods</b> can elicit a clinically relevant reduction in viable bacterial numbers. In this review, we present a detailed account of both the biomaterial and biophysical approaches for achieving maximum bacterial inactivation.

In addition, there are no results of statistical research of inter-regional correlations of <b>stimulation</b> <b>methods</b> and analysis of dynamics of this process.

Classification of investments’ <b>stimulation</b> <b>methods</b> is developed. The way of preparing and coding data for research is offered. The approach and system of coefficients for the analysis of inter-regional interrelations of legislative systems of investments’ stimulation is offered. A proximity coefficient of regional legislation, a factor of structure similarity and a dynamic coincidence index are proposed. The space-time base of investment <b>stimulation</b> <b>methods</b> on Russian Federation regions for 12 years is collected and statistically processed for research. There are only 758 documents. A source of texts is a site of the Ministry of Justice of the Russian Federation. Research of documents has allowed revealing a number of laws in formation of regional investment stimulation systems. The regions that are the most similar in terms of structure of <b>stimulation</b> <b>methods</b> are identified. We have found the group of regions for which it is observed the increase in similarity of the legislation and the group with the reduction of similarity. Therefore, {{it is obvious that the}} general trend to reduction of similarity in the legislation takes place between Krasnoyarsk territory and the other regions of the Russian Federation. Calculations have revealed concurrence of dynamics to use some <b>stimulation</b> <b>methods</b> in Krasnoyarsk region and in the other regions of the Russian Federation for 2005 - 2016. Among them, there are some measures of subsidizing, concessionary terms of using the ground and granting of the ground areas, concession agreements on property and creation of industrial parks, state-private partnership and others. We have found the groups of regions in which there are the trends on harmonization or on a divergence to use the separate kinds of stimulation. Thus, the offered approach and a set of measuring instruments enable to carry out the research of inter-regional similarity of legal documents. It allows receiving the answer to a question on a degree of similarity of systems of investment activity stimulation, accepted in regions; to estimate joint dynamics of stimulation systems’ changes; to define a degree of concurrence on separate measures of support; to analyze similarity of a current condition and processes on the change of the legislation. The approach permits to investigate directions of harmonization or a divergence of regional approaches to investment activity stimulation. The received results can form a base for the further economic-statistical and econometric researches of efficiency of methods for the investment activity stimulation. It will allow to structure objects of research, to allocate more homogeneous group of regions on <b>stimulation</b> <b>methods.</b> The proximity coefficient matrix will be especially useful in spatial econometric models.
