5|$|Beyond {{these initial}} prosecutions, the ecclesia {{attacked}} Pericles himself by {{asking him to}} justify his ostensible profligacy with, and maladministration of, public money. According to Plutarch, Pericles was <b>so</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> the oncoming trial {{that he did not}} let the Athenians yield to the Lacedaemonians. Beloch also believes that Pericles deliberately brought on the war to protect his political position at home. Thus, {{at the start of the}} Peloponnesian War, Athens found itself in the awkward position of entrusting its future to a leader whose pre-eminence had just been seriously shaken for the first time in over a decade.|$|E
25|$|In 1975 Maggie is {{operated}} on by Bill Horton (Mickey's brother), {{but she still}} cannot walk. Laura Horton (Bill's wife and Mickey's ex-wife) explains to her that her paralysis is no longer physical, but mental. Maggie is <b>so</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> losing Mickey that she is causing the paralysis in her mind. After Mickey officially divorces Laura, Mickey and Maggie are married on Jan 25, 1975.|$|E
25|$|On August 12, 1996 22-year-old Cindy Nannay was {{fatally shot}} outside Bozorth Hall by her estranged boyfriend, who then killed himself. Nannay was <b>so</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> Scott Lonabaugh, 27, {{that when he}} arrived on the campus to see her, she asked friends to {{accompany}} her to the parking lot, the Gloucester County Prosecutor's office said. As her friends looked on, Mr. Lonabaugh shot Ms. Nannay twice with a shotgun and then {{shot himself in the}} head, prosecutors said. Both died at the scene.|$|E

25|$|In 1380, Hồ Quý Ly had a minor {{victory over}} the troop of Chế Bồng Nga in Thanh Hóa, as a result, Đỗ Tử Bình {{had to give up}} his control of Đại Việt army to Hồ Quý Ly. However, in June 1383, Chế Bồng Nga opened a major {{campaign}} against Đại Việt, this time Trần Nghệ Tông was <b>so</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> the ennemy that he escaped from Thăng Long ignoring advice from the royal court. This coward decision of Nghệ Tông was heavily criticized by the historian Ngô Sĩ Liên in his work Đại Việt sử kí toàn thư. In the northern border, the Ming Dynasty also began to expose their ambition of invading southern kingdoms like Đại Việt and Champa.|$|E
25|$|Late in August, New York {{prosecutor}} Joseph Stone {{convened a}} grand jury to investigate the allegations of the fixing of quiz shows. At {{the time of the}} empaneling, neither being a party to a fixed game show nor fixing a game show in the first place were crimes in their own right. Some witnesses in the grand jury acknowledged their role in a fixed show, while others denied it, directly contradicting one another. Many of the coached contestants, who had become celebrities due to their quiz show success, were <b>so</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> the social repercussions of admitting the fraud that they were unwilling to confess to having been coached, {{even to the point of}} perjuring themselves to avoid backlash. Show producers, who had legally rigged the games to increase ratings but did not want to implicate themselves, the show sponsors, or the networks they worked for in doing so, categorically denied the allegations. After the nine-month grand jury, no indictments were handed down, and the judge sealed the grand jury report in Summer 1959.|$|E
500|$|The two superpowers had by {{this point}} {{abandoned}} their strategy of détente {{and in response to}} the Soviet deployment of SS-20s, Reagan moved to deploy cruise and Pershing II missiles to Europe. The Soviet Union's involvement in a war in Afghanistan was in its third year, a matter which was also contributing to international tension. In this atmosphere, on November 22, 1982, Time magazine published an issue with Andropov on the cover. When Smith viewed the edition, she asked her mother, [...] "If people are <b>so</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> him, why doesn't someone write a letter asking whether he wants to have a war or not?". Her mother replied, [...] "Why don't you?" ...|$|E

500|$|SFScope {{contributor}} Sarah Stegall {{thought the}} episode {{was similar to}} Flowers for Algernon, but was skeptical of the premise that Milo could predict every event before they happened. She criticized the decision to make Milo [...] "coldly calculating", writing [...] "This is but another version of the tired cliché of the stoic intellectual, the intelligent person who has no heart or emotions. Why are we <b>so</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> smart people?... It always annoys me when science fiction writers, of all people, diss their own audience {{with the idea that}} intellectuals are dangerous." [...] Stegall was pleased to have the first [...] "standalone" [...] episode of the season, explaining that it was the first where she could [...] "relax and enjoy... the tying together of a standalone with a mythology theme was absolutely brilliant." [...] Fearnet contributor Alyse Wax enjoyed the episode, but also thought [...] "the idea that [...] could turn someone into a cartoonish evil genius is pretty farfetched." ...|$|E
500|$|On 8 January 1945 Nikolai Krylov {{formally}} allowed Shanina {{to participate}} in front-line combat, albeit with great reluctance: previously Shanina was denied that permission by {{the commander of the}} 184th Rifle Division and the military council of the 5th Army as well. Five days later, the Soviets launched the East Prussian Offensive, which prompted heavy fighting in East Prussia. By 15 January, travelling with divisional logistics, Shanina reached the East Prussian town of Eydtkuhnen (now Chernyshevskoye), where she used white military camouflage. Several days later, she experienced friendly fire from a Katyusha rocket launcher and wrote in her diary, [...] "Now I understand why the Germans are <b>so</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> Katyushas. What a fire!" [...] At the border of East Prussia, Shanina killed 26 enemy soldiers. The last unit she served in was the 144th Rifle Division. According to the online Book of Memory of Arkhangelsk Oblast, Shanina served in the 205th Special Motorized Rifle Battalion of that division. Shanina had hoped to go to university after the war, or if that was not possible, to raise orphans.|$|E

2500|$|After the 2016 {{election}} of Donald Trump {{as president of}} the United States, Morrison wrote an essay [...] "Mourning For Whiteness," [...] published in the November 21, 2016, issue of the New Yorker. In it she argues that white Americans are <b>so</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> losing privileges afforded them by their race, white voters elected Trump, a candidate supported by the white supremacist group the Ku Klux Klan, {{in order to keep the}} idea of white supremacy alive.|$|E
2500|$|The Athenian {{victory at}} Naupactus {{put an end}} to Sparta's attempt to {{challenge}} Athens in the Corinthian gulf and the Northwest, and secured Athens' dominance at sea. [...] At Naupactus, the Athenians' backs had been against the wall; a defeat there would have lost Athens its foothold in the Corinthian gulf and encouraged the Peloponnesians to attempt further aggressive operations at sea. [...] In 428 BC, the Spartans would be so cowed by the memory of their defeats at Phormio's hands that they sent no aid to Athens' rebellious subject Mytilene in that year. In 427, when they finally did send a fleet, the commander was <b>so</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> being caught at sea by the Athenians that he fled home without accomplishing anything.|$|E
2500|$|Between 1969 and 1971, Pride {{had eight}} singles that {{simultaneously}} reached {{number one on}} the US Country Hit Parade and also charted on the Billboard Hot 100: [...] "All I Have to Offer You (Is Me)", [...] "(I'm <b>So)</b> <b>Afraid</b> <b>of</b> Losing You Again", [...] "I Can't Believe That You've Stopped Loving Me", [...] "I'd Rather Love You", [...] "Is Anybody Goin' to San Antone", [...] "Wonder Could I Live There Anymore", [...] "I'm Just Me", and [...] "Kiss an Angel Good Mornin'". The pop success of these songs reflected the country/pop crossover sound that was reaching country music in the 1960s and early 1970s, known as [...] "Countrypolitan". In 1969, his compilation album, The Best of Charley Pride, sold over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc. Ultimately, Elvis Presley was the only artist who sold more records than Pride for the RCA label.|$|E

2500|$|In 1897–98, she {{rejoined the}} D'Oyly Carte at the Savoy, playing {{the title role}} in The Grand Duchess of Gerolstein. Though she {{received}} generally good notices, St. John bridled at the famously strict direction at the Savoy and later complained {{that she had not}} been allowed to [...] "do any business of my own." [...] The Times review supports her judgment: [...] "The English stage has no artist so well fitted as Miss Florence St. John to do full justice to Offenbach... her artistic singing would more than carry this off if she could recover the abandon of some of her former efforts. ...she looks the part to perfection, but she seems <b>so</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> overdoing the suggestion and roguery which are essential that she makes the impersonation seem sadly tame. It is as if she were overwhelmed with the atmosphere of the theatre in which she finds herself, or were affected more than all the rest by the prudish spirit in which the work has been approached." ...|$|E
2500|$|The largely unenthusiastic press {{reaction}} to the album caused the individual members of the band to lose faith {{in the concept of}} an ongoing, periodic series of band reunions and ultimately, all five members returned to their own careers following the album's release. [...] In the following years, the band themselves would echo many of the sentiments expressed by the music press, with the general consensus being that the recording of the album was rushed and ill-thought out. [...] Gene Clark offered his thoughts on the album during a 1977 interview: [...] "I am disappointed in that album. Some of the harsh criticism is unjust, because, if you listen to it carefully, the album isn't that bad, but it just hasn't got the punch that it could have had if we'd taken the time." [...] Chris Hillman concurred with Clark, telling The Byrds' biographer Johnny Rogan [...] "In all honesty, we didn't have enough time on the album. They gave us one-and-a-half months to do that album, expecting guys to regroup after a five to six year absence." [...] Hillman also cited the band's eagerness to avoid conflict as a contributing factor to the album's artistic failure: [...] "everybody was <b>so</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> stepping on the other person's feet because of the tension that had gone down six years prior to that, that it became a bland album. Everybody was being too nice to each other." [...] McGuinn blamed the reunion album's lack of success, at least partly, on the hedonism exhibited by members of the band during the recording process: [...] "David had this incredibly strong pot. Half a joint and you couldn't do anything. We were stoned out of our minds the whole time. I don't remember much recording." ...|$|E
