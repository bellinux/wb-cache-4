40|$|I {{present a}} fully-rational symmetric-information model of an IPO, {{as well as}} a dy-namic imperfectly {{competitive}} model of the aftermarket trading that follows. The model helps explain why IPO <b>share</b> <b>allocations</b> favor large institutional investors. It also helps to explain IPO underpricing, and underperformance, and the large fees charged by underwriters. The critical assumption in the model is that underwriters need to sell a fixed number of shares at the IPO or soon thereafter in the aftermarket, but they want to avoid selling in the aftermarket because there are some aftermarket investors who have market power and can affect the prices received by the underwriter. To maximize revenue and avoid unnecessary aftermarket sales, the underwriter distorts <b>share</b> <b>allocations</b> toward those those investors who have market power, and he sets the offer price at the IPO below the aftermarket price that will prevail shortly after the IPO. In the aftermarket model, I show that there are <b>share</b> <b>allocations</b> that can gener-ate arbitrarily high levels of return underperformance for very long periods of time. In some simulations, the distorted <b>share</b> <b>allocations</b> at the IPO generate return underper-formance that persists for more than one year.

The quota became controversial when it was found that 11 of the licences, primarily multi generational local family fishing companies, were allocated only 1% of the quota each, which would fail to cover their overheads; conversely, 10 licences supplying European markets were allocated up to 15% of the quota each. Two groups were formed to lobby Parliament to protect their interests: the Goolwa Cockle Working Group, to represent the 10 large quota holders, and the Southern Fisherman’s Association representing the small quotas. A politician supporting the small quota holders, Mitch Williams, claimed the government was deliberately trying to cut {{the number of people in}} the industry to possibly just five or six. The South Australian Legislative Council overturned the quotas on 23 June 2008, citing that [...] "they tip the balance in favour of some fishers to the detriment of others". The Fisheries Minister, Rory McEwen threatened to re-promulgate the quotas and the Legislative Council has still to decide whether to disallow the regulation a second time if it is re-introduced.

We find that poor performance and financing constraints, reflected by a low profitability and high leverage, mainly drive public <b>share</b> <b>allocation.</b> Also, the government widens ownership to a larger extent in firms that receive substantial subsidies. By contrast, stock market returns pre-SIP and variables capturing the firmâ??s growth opportunities do not positively affect public <b>share</b> <b>allocation.</b> Yet, in firms with a low market-to-book ratio, the government is more likely to relinquish its majority stake at SIP-time.

40|$|The {{production}} line of modern multi-product manufacturing with erratic demand profiles {{shows that the}} selection and implementation of appropriate production control strategy are an important challenge. Organisations that adopt pull-type production control strategies, such as Kanban control strategy, for multi-product {{production line}}s find {{that is necessary to}} plan high Kanban card allocations in order to maintain volume flexibility to manage demand variability. This can result in line congestion, long lead times and low throughput rate. A recently proposed <b>shared</b> Kanban <b>allocation</b> policy has the benefit of minimising inventories in the line by allocating Kanbans accordingly and therefore maintains volume flexibility. However, many pull production control strategies that {{have been shown to be}} successful in single product manufacturing environments, for instance Kanban, CONWIP and Basestock cannot operate the <b>shared</b> Kanban <b>allocation</b> policy naturally. This Thesis presents a practically applicable modification approach to enable pull production control strategies that are naturally unable to operate in a <b>shared</b> Kanban <b>allocation</b> policy mode to operate it. Furthermore, the approach enables the development of a new pull production control strategy referred to as Basestock Kanban CONWIP control strategy that has the capability to operate the <b>shared</b> Kanban <b>allocation</b> policy, minimising inventory and backlog while maintaining volume flexibility. To investigate the performance of the pull production control strategies and policies, discrete event simulation and evolutionary multi-objective optimisation approach were adopted to develop sets of non-dominated optimal solutions for the experiments. Nelson’s screening and selection procedure were used to select the best pull control strategy and Kanban allocation policy when robustness are not considered. Additionally, Latin hypercube sampling technique and stochastic dominance test were employed for selection of a superior policy and strategy under environmental and system variability. Under non-robust conditions (anticipated environmental and system variability), pull control strategies combined with the <b>shared</b> Kanban <b>allocation</b> policy outperforms pull control strategies combined with dedicated Kanban allocation policy. Conversely, pull control strategies combined with the dedicated Kanban allocation policy outperforms pull control strategies combined with <b>shared</b> Kanban <b>allocation</b> policy when the system is prone to environmental and system variabilities. Furthermore Basestock Kanban CONWIP control strategy outperforms the alternatives in both robust and non-robust conditions. ...|$|R
