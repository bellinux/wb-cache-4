50|$|For a plane, the two angles {{are called}} its <b>strike</b> (<b>angle)</b> and its dip (angle). A strike {{line is the}} {{intersection}} of a horizontal plane with the observed planar feature (and therefore a horizontal line), and the <b>strike</b> <b>angle</b> is the bearing of this line (that is, relative to geographic north or from magnetic north). The dip is the angle between a horizontal plane and the observed planar feature as observed in a third vertical plane perpendicular to the strike line.|$|E
50|$|Another way of {{representing}} strike and dip is by dip and dip direction. The dip direction is the azimuth {{of the direction}} the dip as projected to the horizontal (like the trend of a linear feature in trend and plunge measurements), which is 90° off the <b>strike</b> <b>angle.</b> For example, a bed dipping 30° to the South, would have an East-West strike (and would be written 090°/30° S using strike and dip), but would be written as 30/180 using the dip and dip direction method.|$|E
50|$|Strike and dip {{refer to}} the {{orientation}} or attitude of a geologic feature. The strike line of a bed, fault, or other planar feature, is a line representing the intersection of that feature with a horizontal plane. On a geologic map, this is represented with a short straight line segment oriented parallel to the strike line. Strike (or <b>strike</b> <b>angle)</b> can be given as either a quadrant compass bearing of the strike line (N25°E for example) or in terms of east or west of true north or south, a single three digit number representing the azimuth, where the lower number is usually given (where the example of N25°E would simply be 025), or the azimuth number followed by the degree sign (example of N25°E would be 025°).|$|E

40|$|Yield line {{analysis}} {{is a useful}} method for design of reinforced concrete slabs, but has been limited to slabs of simple geometry, because up to now {{there has been no}} generally applicable and fully automatic computational procedure for complex-shaped slabs. Herein, a new yield line method that can be applied to any convex polygonal-shaped slab is developed. In this method, the deflections of the slab regions divided by yield lines are measured in terms of the dip and <b>strike</b> <b>angles</b> of the slab surfaces, which can define the geometry of all kinematically admissible collapse mechanisms or yield line patterns. The external work done and the internal energy dissipation at yield lines are evaluated as functions of the dip and <b>strike</b> <b>angles,</b> and the principle of virtual work is used to determine the corresponding load factor. The final solution is obtained by minimising the load factor with respect to the dip and <b>strike</b> <b>angles.</b> A computer program based on this method has been produced. Its correctness is verified by checking against results obtained by others for simple cases, and its versatility is demonstrated by applying it to complicated slabs subjected to point, line, patch and uniformly distributed loads. published_or_final_versio...|$|R

That is, the discrepancies may have been caused by the number of fault planes as well as the dense observation data of InSAR. Because {{a large part of the}} displacement at site 1071 is explained by the rupture along the northern part of the Hinagu fault segment, both the horizontal and vertical displacements at site 1071 were poorly explained (Fig.  4, Additional file 1 : Figure S 1).

Dimensionality {{analysis}} and three-dimensional inversion of both datasets revealed the conductivity structure and yielded the results {{given in the}} conceptual model (Fig.  8). Performing 3 D analysis allowed us to detect highly varying lateral conductance values along the GF. The GF consists of several subsidiary fracture zones surrounding the main fault, which were identified by individual FCZs. The damage zone of the GF extends widely along these FZCs, forming an asymmetric damage zone concentrated in the south, where the younger formations act as reservoir for meteoric water. These spatial characteristics demonstrate a distributed conduit behavior of fluid flow {{in the vicinity of}} the GF. The GF is a strike-slip fault, almost lacking a dipping component. The geoelectric <b>strike</b> <b>angles</b> are in agreement with the geological <b>strike</b> <b>angles</b> and follow a N 70 °E trend.

In the future, when {{the depth of the}} smaller aftershocks can be better constrained from depth phases (Langston, 1987), a cross section of the aftershock pattern should provide clues to variable dip angle versus depth for the rupturing fault plane. Therefore, much more work has to be done on aftershocks to better understand the rupture process and seismotectonic setting of the Wenchuan Earthquake.|$|R

30|$|Next, {{with the}} {{knowledge}} obtained from the uniform slip model, I constructed {{a model for the}} foreshocks to map the detailed slip distribution. The slip distribution model is inferred by a least squares method, following the general procedure of Kobayashi et al. (2012). In the inversion, only the dip-slip and strike-slip components are estimated for each patch. The increase of model parameters gives rise to instability of the solution. To stabilize the solution, I here impose a spatial smoothness constraint on the slip distribution using a Laplacian operator. The relative weight of the constraints is determined by Akaike’s Bayesian information criterion (Akaike 1980). For the Hinagu fault, the fault plane was set to a rectangle 20  km long and 20  km wide. The <b>strike</b> <b>angle</b> was set at 205 °, so as to be parallel to the Hinagu fault zone. The northern edge of the fault plane is set to be around the junction of the Hinagu fault and the Futagawa fault.

40|$|Objectives: To {{investigate}} {{differences in}} toe clearance between people with PD and age-matched healthy elderly (HE) during comfortable walking and {{to study the}} effects of dual-tasking and the use of an attentional strategy emphasizing heel strike on toe clearance. Design: Observational cross-sectional study. Setting: Camera-based 3 D gait laboratory. Participants: Ten persons with PD (Hoehn and Yahr I − III) having mild gait disturbances and 10 HE. Interventions: Participants walked for two minutes under 3 conditions at comfortable pace: single-task walking, attending to heel strike during single-task walking, and dual-task walking. Main outcome measures: minimal and maximal toe clearance; foot <b>strike</b> <b>angle</b> with the ground. Results: People with PD had less maximal toe clearance in the end of the swing phase and a smaller foot <b>strike</b> <b>angle</b> than HE during all three walking conditions. Impairments significantly diminished during heel strike focused walking improving performance to equal the HE. Heel strike focused walking resulted in an increased minimal toe clearance and a longer duration of end swing phase when compared to walking with and without a dual-task. The attentional strategy to focus on heel strike improved the stride length when compared to dual-task walking. Surprisingly, minimal toe clearance did not differ between PD and HE in any of the conditions and there were no dual-task effects on toe clearance. Conclusion: These findings provide evidence favoring the potential incorporation of an attentional strategy focusing on the heel strike in PD gait rehabilitation. status: accepte...|$|E

30|$|Regarding the {{localized}} westward signals between F 1 and F 3, it {{is possible}} to attribute to the left-lateral slip on F 3. However, the inferred left-lateral strike-slip on F 3 turned out to be insignificant as mentioned before; this may be because we used pixel-offset data for the inversion. Some reports of field-based surface rupture observations indicated left-lateral offsets near the southern end of F 3; the <b>strike</b> <b>angles</b> were ~N 70 W (e.g., [URL] in Japanese). Given these reports and the modeling results, if the westward signals have their origin in faults, they may suggest the left-lateral faults in between F 1 and F 3 which strike ~N 70 W in a conjugate fashion. Although, to our knowledge, there are no reports of such seismic focal mechanisms, they might have occurred at very shallow depth without generating seismic waves. Another possible interpretation would be a co-seismic landslide; the local slop orientation seems to be consistent with this scenario.|$|R

Termed as single event upset (SEU), in the past this phenomenon mostly affected the high altitude systems or avionics. The small geometries of today’s nanodevices and their use in high-density and high-complexity designs make electronic systems sensitive even to the ground-level radiation.

The method of Yabuki and Matsu’ura (1992) represents the slip distribution and fault configuration as a superposition of B-spline functions. Slip vectors were estimated by using boxcar functions with a smoothness constraint for regularization. Smoothness values that minimized Akaike’s Bayesian information criterion (ABIC, Akaike 1980) were considered. Slip vectors were calculated for a 16  ×  13 grid of point sources {{on the plate}} interface and the plate interface configuration of Hirose et al. (2008).
