In accordance with this purpose, the inventory of metacognitive awareness was applied to 263 candidate teachers (157 female, 106 male), studying at Uludag University. At the end of the study, it was understood that the majority of the primary teacher trainees had high level of metacognitive awareness. Furthermore, there appeared no <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> <b>among</b> the scores of candidate teachers’ metacognitive awareness according to gender, but there appeared <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> <b>among</b> the scores of candidate teachers’ metacognitive awareness according to class levels...|$|R
