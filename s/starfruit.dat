5|$|There are {{currently}} about 230 tropical botanical gardens with a concentration in southern and south-eastern Asia. The first botanical garden {{founded in the}} tropics was the Pamplemousses Botanical Garden in Mauritius, established in 1735 to provide food for ships using the port, but later trialling and distributing many plants of economic importance. This {{was followed by the}} West Indies (Botanic Gardens St. Vincent, 1764) and in 1786 by the Acharya Jagadish Chandra Bose Botanical Garden in Calcutta, India founded during a period of prosperity when the city was a trading centre for the Dutch East India Company. Other gardens were constructed in Brazil (Rio de Janeiro Botanical Garden, 1808), Sri Lanka (Botanical Garden of Peradeniya, 1821 and on a site dating back to 1371), Indonesia (Bogor Botanical Gardens, 1817 and Kebun Raya Cibodas, 1852), and Singapore (Singapore Botanical Gardens, 1822). These {{had a profound effect on}} the economy of the countries, especially in relation to the foods and medicines introduced. The importation of rubber trees to the Singapore Botanic Garden initiated the important rubber industry of the Malay Peninsula. At this time also, teak and tea were introduced to India and breadfruit, pepper and <b>starfruit</b> to the Caribbean.|$|E
5|$|The {{shopping}} center {{is expected to}} include Bebe, Coach and J.Crew. Lettuce Entertain You who also operates the food court at Water Tower Place will operate a cafe, food court and market. The top floor was to be occupied by Muvico Theaters, however they pulled out in 2009. The David Barton Gym, the first and largest tenant of the Block 37 project, has {{pulled out of the}} project favoring, instead, the Roosevelt Collection in the south loop. The reason the gym opted out was the delayed opening of the mall, which is scheduled for fall 2009 opening rather than fall 2008 as scheduled. In March 2009, Apple Inc. also withdrew from its leasing agreement, and less than a month later it signed an agreement to develop a new storefront in the Clybourn Corridor on property bounded by North Avenue, Halsted Street and Clybourn Avenue. After Apple backed out of its lease, Lululemon backed out of its lease to be located next to Apple. Other March 2009 tenant signings included Chicago's haberdashery Bigsby & Kruthers, Sunglass Hut, crystal jewelers Swarovski, <b>Starfruit</b> Cafe, and Fast-casual eatery Tahini. Also, in the face of declining advertising revenue, CBS sought to sublease part of its studio. A Loews Hotel will be built in forthcoming years.|$|E
25|$|When Fruit Ninja {{celebrated its}} second anniversary, Halfbrick {{released}} an update {{with a new}} feature called Gutsu's Cart, which comprises two characters, a pig named Truffles and a human named Gutsu. In the various modes of the game, you can earn <b>starfruit</b> to purchase items in Gutsu's Cart. There are three purchasable items at the cart which {{are used in the}} game; Berry Blast causes sliced strawberries to explode and gives the player five extra points. Another item is Peachy Times: slicing a peach in Zen or Arcade mode gives the player two extra seconds. The third item is Bomb Deflects which enables the player to deflect Bombs upon accidentally slicing them. <b>Starfruit</b> can be obtained after each game, proportional to the score, or by slicing the semi-rare <b>starfruit.</b>|$|E

50|$|Ripe sweet type {{carambolas}} are sweet {{without being}} overwhelming as they rarely {{have more than}} 4% sugar content. They have a tart, sour undertone, and an oxalic acid odor. The taste is difficult to compare, {{but it has been}} compared to a mix of apple, pear, grape, and citrus family fruits. Unripe <b>starfruits</b> are firmer and sour, and taste like green apples.|$|R
25|$|At {{relatively}} high concentrations, <b>starfruit</b> juice {{has also been}} shown to inhibit CYP2A6 and other CYPs. Watercress is also a known inhibitor of the cytochrome P450 CYP2E1, which may result in altered drug metabolism for individuals on certain medications (e.g., chlorzoxazone).|$|E
25|$|Flavored rums are {{infused with}} flavors of fruits, such as banana, mango, orange, pineapple, coconut, <b>starfruit</b> or lime. These are {{generally}} less than 40% ABV (80 proof). They mostly serve to flavor similarly-themed tropical drinks {{but are also}} often drunk neat or with ice. This infusion of flavors occurs after fermentation and distillation. Various chemicals {{are added to the}} alcohol to simulate the tastes of food.|$|E
25|$|As {{distribution}} of Gatorade expanded {{outside of the}} U.S., localized flavors were introduced to conform to regional tastes and cultural preferences, among other factors. For example, Blueberry is available in Colombia, and in Brazil, a Pineapple flavor of Gatorade is sold. In Australia, flavors include Antarctic Freeze and Wild Water Rush. Some flavors that have been discontinued in the U.S., such as Alpine Snow and <b>Starfruit,</b> have since been made available in other countries.|$|E
40|$|Hyperspectral imaging {{technology}} is {{a powerful tool for}} non-destructive quality assessment of fruits. The objective of this research was to develop novel calibration model based on hyperspectral imaging to estimate soluble solid content (SSC) of <b>starfruits.</b> A hyperspectral imaging system, which consists of a near infrared camera, a spectrograph V 10, a halogen lighting and a conveyor belt system, was used in this study to acquire hyperspectral images of the samples in visible and near infrared (500 - 1000 nm) regions. Partial least square (PLS) was used to build the model and to find the optimal wavelength. Two different masks were applied for obtaining the spectral data. The optimal wavelengths were evaluated using multi linear regression (MLR). The coefficient of determination (R 2) for validation using the model with first mask (M 1) and second mask (M 2) were 0. 82 and 0. 80, respectively...|$|R
2500|$|In {{the fifth}} anniversary update to Fruit Ninja, Gutsu's Cart was removed and instead {{replaced}} with a power-up menu that used <b>starfruit</b> to buy the three power-ups in the game. Berry Blast power-ups were priced at 120 <b>starfruit,</b> Peachy Times power-ups were priced at 100 <b>starfruit,</b> and Bomb Deflect power-ups were priced at 80 <b>starfruit.</b> In addition, certain dojos and blades now had different effects that took place within the Classic, Arcade, and Zen game modes. For example, if a player owned the Cherry Blossom dojo, the power-up costs were 50% off. A new festival mode was added in as well, where players could compete against the game's artificial intelligence by paying Gold Apples to challenge an AI player. There were also mini-games added to challenge the skills of newcomers and experts alike.|$|E
