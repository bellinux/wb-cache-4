40|$|A {{procedure}} {{for the construction}} of an indicator in the presence of structured missing data is proposed. In particular, we face the problem of creating a ‘measure’ of the damage degree of valuable historical-architectonical buildings {{on the basis of the}} observation of several ordinal variables. Our proposal is the jointly use of Nonlinear PCA and an imputation method for missing data treatment. The adopted procedure can be generally applied when an indicator is needed on the basis of the observation of ordinal, but also nominal or numerical, variables, which are deeply interrelated and are affected by systematic missing data. It has the nice feature of treating missing data according to the relevance of variables affected by missing observations and, at the same time, it preserves all the properties of Nonlinear PCA without missing data. Furthermore, the method provides category quantifications and variable loadings that could be used for future inventory of buildings (in general of ‘units’) not included in the initial survey. nonlinear MVA, quantification of ordinal variables, optimal <b>scaling,</b> <b>measurement.,...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{performance}} of a wireless network protocol is inseparably linked to the physical layer algorithms on which it is built, the hardware used to implement the radio, and the wireless environment in which it operates. This paper identifies three features of wireless networking protocols impacted by these lower-level characteristics that are often overlooked or misunderstood by many researchers developing wireless protocols or using testbed-based evaluation methods. These features are temporal <b>scaling,</b> <b>measurement</b> reciprocity, and cross-layer adaptation. Temporal scaling refers to the time resolution with which events, such as broadcast or feedback, occur in the wireless network. This feature is tightly coupled with processing time at the physical layer and time selectivity in the wireless channel. Measurement reciprocity is an assumption used to estimate parameters of the forward link of a bidirectional communication channel, based on observations from the reverse link. This assumption directly depends on the interference properties and hardware symmetry of nodes in a wireless network. System adaptation, based on reciprocity or feedback, inevitably requires careful scrutiny of power and rate control applied to physical wireless devices. This paper also provides recommendations to guide researchers in setting up interesting and useful wireless experiments. Three concerns for wireless experimentation are addressed, namely: ambient interference, RF hardware profiling, and fading properties of the wireless channel. The motivation for this paper stems from experience prototyping and experimenting with Hydra, a wireless cross-layer testbe...|$|E

40|$|Based on {{the theory}} of concept combination, this study {{develops}} a <b>scale</b> <b>measurement</b> called “Imagination Test of Concept Combination, ITCC”. The tested items are consisted of two unrelated concepts such as “cell phone-justice”, the respondent is required to think up a word to connect these two concepts such as “police”, and then explain the association process and reasons. <b>Scale</b> <b>measurement</b> items are collected from nouns in nature, artifact, and abstract, {{as well as from}} the list of contemporary Chinese in the corpus which developed by the research teams from institutes of linguistics of Taiwan Academia Sinica. Through randomly combining these nouns (noun-noun pairing) and after pretesting, the <b>scale</b> <b>measurement</b> is made up of 18 items, the respondent can answer the questionnaire in free-writing way. The purpose of this <b>scale</b> <b>measurement</b> is to test level of imagination of students, and provide references for university in designing curriculum and activity. Data are collected from 602 undergraduate and graduate students. Based on statistical data, items with more than 5 % respondents with the same answers are given 0 point, 1 point for between 2 %- 4 %, and 2 points for under 2 %, in order to establish the test's score handbook. 	The statistical result showed that each item and total score is significantly correlated, representing the discrimination of the <b>scale</b> <b>measurement.</b> The reliability of the <b>scale</b> <b>measurement</b> is acceptable (Cronbach's α=. 465), the reliability is retested after a week later (Cronbach's α=. 878) represents the stability of the scale measurement; the rater reliability is. 854. Besides, in terms of validity, as compared to Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking linear and circle tests, this <b>scale</b> <b>measurement</b> indicated that fluency and flexibility are not significantly correlated; at the same time, as compared to “Something About Myself” <b>scale</b> <b>measurement</b> and “What Kind of Person Are You” <b>scale</b> <b>measurement</b> of the creative perception <b>scale</b> <b>measurement,</b> this <b>scale</b> <b>measurement</b> is not significantly related to these <b>scale</b> <b>measurements,</b> this indicates that the imagination test developed in this study is distinguished from creation tests. Furthermore, this study also adapts the originality scoring method of Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking, due to both belong to the same measurement construct, hence the result showed that they are significantly low correlated. In summary, the results indicated that the <b>scale</b> <b>measurement</b> test of this study has fairly good reliability and validity. 本研究依據概念結合理論發展一份「概念結合想像力測驗（Imagination Test of Concept Combination, ITCC）」，測驗題目使用兩個完全不相關的概念組合而成，如「手機―正義」，要求受測者想出兩者之間的關聯詞句，如「警察」，並說明其聯想過程或理由。本研究搜尋自然類、人造類、抽象類的名詞作為量表題材，並使用中央研究院語言學研究所之研究團隊蒐集的語料庫，所統計出現代漢語詞頻查詢，經由隨機組合名詞―名詞配對，透過預試後形成 18 題的想像力測驗，採開放性文字填答方式，本測驗主要用來衡量學生的想像力程度，並作為學校課程或活動設計之參考。本研究以 602 位大學生與研究生為研究對象，並將施測所得資料進行統計，每題超過 5 %受試者有相同反應的給予 0 分；介於 2 %至 4. 99 %之間者給予 1 分；低於 2 %者則給予 2 分，並以此基準建立本測驗之評分手冊。 研究結果，經由項目分析後顯示各題項與總分之間達顯著相關，表示本測驗試題具有鑑別度。信度方面，Cronbach’s α係數為. 465 ，尚在可接受的範圍內；隔週之重測信度為. 878 ，表示本量表具有良好的穩定性；評分者信度為. 852 。而在效度方面，與托倫斯創造思考之直線及圓圈測驗，測得之流暢力與應變力呈現無顯著相關；與創造性知覺量表之我自己量表及你是那一種人量表，亦呈現無顯著相關，表示本研究發展之想像力測驗與創造力之間具有區別能力；另本測驗採托倫斯創造思考測驗之獨創力計分方式，由於兩者屬於相同的衡量構面，因此結果顯示兩者呈現低度顯著相關。綜合上述研究結果顯示本測驗具有良好的信度與效度。第一章 緒論	 1 第二章 文獻探討	 4 第一節 創造力	 4 一、創造力定義	 5 二、創造力衡量工具	 6 三、創造力訓練	 9 四、小結	 13 第二節 想像力	 14 一、想像力定義	 14 二、自由聯想	 17 三、連結理論	 19 四、小結	 23 第三節 概念結合	 24 一、概念結合的詮釋理論	 25 二、概念詮釋方式	 26 三、小結	 28 第三章 研究方法	 29 第一節 研究樣本	 29 一、搜尋題材樣本	 29 二、預試樣本	 29 三、建立評分手冊之樣本	 29 四、信度與效度研究樣本	 29 第二節 想像力量表之編製	 30 一、量表編製過程	 30 二、施測方式	 36 第三節 資料分析工具	 38 一、樣本敘述性統計與差異性檢定	 38 二、項目分析	 38 三、信度分析	 38 四、效度分析	 38 第四章 研究結果	 40 第一節 建立概念結合想像力測驗之評分手冊	 40 一、反應項目篩選原則	 40 二、反應項目歸類	 41 三、簡化評分手冊	 41 四、計分方式	 42 第二節 概念結合想像力測驗之項目分析	 43 一、各題與總分之相關分析	 43 二、極端組差異比較	 43 第三節 概念結合想像力測驗之信度分析	 46 一、內部一致性	 46 二、重測信度	 46 三、評分者信度	 46 第四節 概念結合想像力測驗之效度分析	 47 一、區別效度 1 ：托倫斯創造思考測驗（TTCT）	 47 二、區別效度 2 ：創造性知覺量表	 48 第五節 概念結合想像力測驗之敘述性與差異性分析	 51 一、概念結合想像力測驗之敘述性統計	 51 二、性別差異考驗	 55 第五章 結論與建議	 56 第一節 結論	 56 一、概念結合想像力測驗編製	 56 二、量表評分與修訂	 57 三、研究結果	 57 四、本測驗與其他量表之比較	 58 第二節 建議	 60 一、使用此工具的建議	 60 二、運用範圍之建議	 60 第三節 研究限制	 61 第四節 未來研究方向	 62 第五節 結語	 63 參考文獻	 64 附錄一：概念結合想像力測驗	 72 附錄二：評分手冊	 7...|$|R

This study investigated how chelae dimorphism may correlate with specialization in function in the land crab Cardisoma carnifx (Herbst 1791). This was achieved by comparing field observations of preferential claw usage during diurnal activities to a mechanical model drived from anatomical claw measurements, claw closing effort of captured specimens, and calculations of expected closing force. Behavior, mechanical scaling, and effort were also compared between males and females. Foraging, eating, and lead claw entering burrow showed significant differences in claw use frequency. It was also found that the major and minor claws scaled differently with respect to carapace length, with the major claw displaying positively allometric scaling and the minor claw displaying near-isometric <b>scaling.</b> <b>Measurement</b> of claw closing effort with respect to claw length showed high correlation in male minor and female major claws. In males, expected force measurements showed a greater rate of growth in the minor claw than in the major claw with respect to claw lengh, but in females, expected force in the major claw exhibited a greater rate of growth. A possible explanation for the differences in design between sexes may be that there are functional differences between male nd female chelae, such as the primary use of male minor claw and female major claw in gripping objects when stressed...|$|E
40|$|A {{photogrammetry}} tool {{dedicated to}} the monitoring of red coral populations in situ has been developed by LSIS in Marseille (France). This tool is used to collect in an efficient and precise manner key data {{for the study of}} the population dynamics of red coral. In selected red coral populations, scuba-divers obtain a series of photographs from the permanent plots (about 2 m 2) on an annual basis. To facilitate the photographic sampling and measurements, the scuba-divers use a 20 x 20 cm quadrat to cover the permanent plots. The analysis of the photographs provides reliable measurements on colony sizes (basal diameter and maximum height), occurrence of breakage of colonies and the occurrence of necrosis. To minimize the divers ’ tasks during the acquisition phase, we opted for stereoscopic acquisition using a single device to easily adapt the measurement procedure to the scene configuration. The material is quite light, one camera and two electronic strobes and a simple procedure with two photographs taken for each site. To facilitate the measurement phase of colony sizes; the exploitation of photographs consists of four key steps: orientation, <b>scaling,</b> <b>measurement</b> of the characteristic points of coral colonies and result validation (checking measurement consistency to detect possible errors in measurement or interpretation). Since the context of the shooting can vary widely, dominant colors, contrast, etc. may often change.

Because the wide spectral line width of the scattered 3 He A-like signals, the longitudinal response can not be identified from the background noise in the current experimental setup. The Fermi liquid to 3 He A-like phase transition temperature Tc,aero have been inferred from the transverse NMR data only. Different from the previous 3 He in aerogel experiments, which have mainly focused on the high field transverse NMR studies of the order parameter, the current low field NMR study gives a better physical picture of the impurity scattering effect on the superfluid order parameter. The field <b>scaling</b> <b>measurement</b> of the A-like phase frequency shift is carried out for the static H 0 field at 10. 31, 20. 44 and 40. 12 Gauss with the superfluid pressurized at 27. 58 bar. For magnetic fields at 20. 44 and 40. 12 Gauss, the aerogel signal shifting away from the Larmor frequency is easily identified from the data analysis. But for magnetic field at 10. 31 Gauss, the signal is much less visible in the FFT spectrum. Several DSP algorithms, including Morlet wavelet, Welch periodogram and Wiener analysis, {{have been carried}} out to further investigate the time-frequency response of the signal.; The 3 He superfluid magnetic response is taken with 3 monolayers of 4 He coated on the nominal 99. 7 % porosity aerogel strands. The purpose of the 4 He preplating is to eliminate the fast exchange interactions between the superfluid and localized magnetic moments due to the 3 He atoms deposited on the surface. The results from the bulk A phase transition are used to determine the absolute temperature scales for the experiment. A least square fit to the real time data is used to extract the normal fluid magnetic responses. Afterwards, the 3 He superfluid A-like signal due to the presence of aerogel impurities is analyzed to determine the Tc,aero at 27. 58 bar.

First of all, in this part, we elaborated a basic overview of the organisational structure of the emergency medical services of the Ústecký kraj region, and of its subdivisions. Next, we outlined the educational system of the paramedical staff of the emergency medical services of the Ústecký kraj region, focused on the area of crisis management. The crisis management competence of paramedical staff involved in emergency medical services {{was the subject of}} a separate sub-chapter. We linked these chapters with the issue of the formation of the department of disaster medicine. Here, we defined the tasks and aims of disaster medicine. To create a better understanding of the issue, a part of the chapter consists of the basic terminology used in disaster medicine. The main aim of the diploma work is the analysis of the knowledge of the paramedical staff of the emergency medical services of the Ústecký kraj region in terms of preparedness for emergencies. The sub-objectives of the thesis are the analysis of the knowledge of the medical rescue workers of the emergency medical services of the Ústecký kraj region in terms of preparedness for emergencies, and the analysis of general nurses' knowledge of, and qualifications in, the specialist anaesthesiological-resuscitative care of the emergency medical services of the Ústecký kraj region in terms of preparedness for emergencies. The methodology of the work lay in the quantitative analysis of statistical data that we gathered from questionnaires that were filled in by randomly selected respondents among the paramedical staff of the emergency medical services of the Ústecký kraj region. We prepared the content of the questionnaire in the context of the issues studied. The respondents chose from a number of pre-defined answers to a total of 20 questions.

40|$|Mass {{accidents}} and catastrophes {{do not occur}} on a daily scale, they occur irregularly and unpredictably and always have devastating consequences that negatively affect the society or nature. They are usually accompanied by {{a large number of}} casualties or damage whose removal cannot be managed using usual local means. To cope with such events, it is necessary to have a professionally trained staff in the Integrated Rescue System and an appropriate coordination of rescue and liquidation. In recent years, there has been an increase of such incidents which have resulted in a mass disability of people. The events of recent days have brought a series of terrorist acts, for example in Paris or Brusselles, of suicide bombings that claimed 130 dead and numerous wounded. These acts, which are associated with the current migration crisis on the European continent, cause considerable tension in the society and evoke questions like whether the readiness of IRS to eliminate the consequences of such events is sufficient. Due to these facts, the thesis tries to find out what knowledge the members of the emergency medical service in South Bohemia have on the issue of disaster medicine and mass accidents. The theoretical part of the thesis titled Knowledge of the Members of the Emergency Medical Service in SB on Disaster Medicine and Mass Accidents defines disaster medicine and all tasks and subjects it deals with. It also mentions the Integrated Rescue System including its basic and other components, its powers and organizational structure resulting from the legislation. Furthermore, it describes the security system and planning, specifically crisis and emergency planning, up to the individual partial plans related to this issue. Finally, the thesis deals with the organization of emergencies with a mass disability of people and a detailed procedure of medical emergency regarding the sorting and evacuation of the wounded. The aim of this thesis is to map the knowledge {{of the members of the}} emergency medical service in SB, which concern the issue of disaster medicine and mass accidents, where the level of knowledge is later analyzed to confirm or disprove the hypothesis that the knowledge of the SB IRS members corresponds with a normal distribution frequency. The practical part uses a quantitative method based on questionnaires completed anonymously, where 50 questionnaires were selected randomly as a statistical set. The survey focuses on a group of emergency workers in South Bohemia. The meetings with them were organized during previous practical studies. The results of the survey were analyzed using statistical investigation. The statistical investigation used the methods of <b>scaling,</b> <b>measurement</b> of the absolute, relative and cumulative frequency. Later on, the empirical parametres used for non-parametric testing were counted. The results of this pilot study indicate the current state of the knowledge of the SB IRS members on disaster medicine and mass accidents.

A large scale map of delays would aid in solving this problem. Existing methods, which deploy devices to every region of the Internet or use of a single vantage point have yet to create such a map. While services such as PlanetLab o?er a distributed network for measurements, they only cover 0. 3 % of the Internet. The focus of our research {{is to increase the}} speed of the single vantage point approach so that it becomes a feasible solution.

The data {{is consistent with the}} dissipative range of 2 D turbulence. Alternatively, the results can be fitted to a functional form that can not be explained by turbulence theory. The large <b>scale</b> <b>measurements</b> were part of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey galaxy redshift examination. We found that the equations describing fusion plasmas also hold for the galaxy data. The comparable dependency of density fluctuation power on wavenumber in fusion plasmas and galaxies might indicate a common origin of these fluctuations.

40|$|In {{the social}} sciences, factor {{analytical}} methods {{are commonly used}} in the <b>scale</b> <b>measurement</b> in examining the structure of scales. This paper provides an alternative way of examining the structure of <b>scale</b> <b>measurement</b> using variable cluster analysis. Three analytical methods are illustrated in this paper, namely exploratory factor analysis, confirmatory factor analysis and variable clustering analysis. As variable cluster analysis is rarely used and not widely discussed in the literature, the advantages, benefits and limitations of using this method are discussed. Comparison of variable clustering to the factor analytical approach is illustrated using the personal strength scale. PROC VARCLUS, PROC FACTOR, and PROC CALIS are the three SAS procedures for these three analytical methods. The syntaxes of the three procedures are given {{and the results are}} interpreted and compared...|$|R
40|$|The SSTH- 70 “Ocean Arrow ” {{designed}} {{under the}} concept of the SSTH (Super Slender Twin Hull), which IHI developed with the University of Tokyo, has been in operation for about three years. The speed of SSTH- 70 is almost twice compared with the conventional ship. During the half year after delivery, the ship motion and wave impact load for the hull structure were measured. This paper describes the design method of hull structure for SSTH as a fast ferry and the full <b>scale</b> <b>measurement</b> on an actual ship to evaluate the estimated ship motion and wave loads. This paper also introduces the future design of the 110 m length SSTH Car Ferry {{based on the results of}} full <b>scale</b> <b>measurement</b> which will have good sea-keeping performance and feature less wake wash...|$|R
