40|$|The use of {{conventional}} service handbooks is still common among service technicians during on-site support. If problems occur during the service process, service technicians have {{to analyze the}} situation and react accordingly. Problem analysis is subject to uncertainty in time, because the optimal course of action strongly depends on the current situation. Therefore, intelligent situation adapted support is needed to replace static guidance. The present article describes a concept for the generation of interactive and situation adapted <b>service</b> <b>instructions</b> that are dynamically derived from a service process model. The concept includes an Information and Communication Technology (ICT) based approach for human-machine interaction to support on-site service activities...|$|E

40|$|This thesis studies “svenner” – armed servants, bailiffs {{and administrators}} – and service ideals in late medieval Sweden {{by using a}} variety of sources {{including}} payrolls, correspondence, charters and <b>service</b> <b>instructions.</b> The study argues that in order to reach an understanding of the relationship between lord and servant, and the complexity of service ideals, questions must be asked about for whom service was open, if there was competition, and what in that case was characteristic of the people and requirements that constituted the service. The conclusion is that service was not open to all; loyalty and strong social bonds were cru-cial, while other capitals such as military competence and ancestry could increase the material and immaterial benefits of service. The social field was closely connected to the political field why those who intended to compete in the field had limited opportunities to influence the terms of service. Although serving the aristocracy could be beneficial in many ways, legisla-tion and a deeply rooted service ideal held the feudal power relations firmly intact...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe use of {{conventional}} service manuals is still common among service technicians during on-site support. If problems occur during the service process, service technicians have {{to analyze the}} situation and react accordingly. Problem analysis is subject to uncertainty in time, because the optimal course of action strongly depends on the current situation. Therefore, intelligent situation adapted support is needed to replace static guidance. This article describes a concept for the generation of interactive and situation adapted <b>service</b> <b>instructions</b> that are dynamically derived from a service process model. After a brief introduction to on-site service support, the article describes in detail how service processes can be modelled by using the method of Integrated Enterprise Modeling (IEM). Subsequently, it shows how and in which phases automated test routines {{can be used to}} support the service process, followed by a critical discussion of possible information and communication technology (ICT) architectures to implement human-machine-interaction. The concept includes an ICT-based approach for human-machine-interaction to trigger test routines on the machine to receive information about the condition of the machine. For Industrial Product-Service Systems (IPS 2), the presented approach offers several benefits compared to existing approaches. These include the ability of tracking and influencing service processes as well as the simple adaption of new IPS 2 modules in case of changing business models or customer requirements. The article concludes giving a specific scenario and an outlook on future research to be done...|$|E
