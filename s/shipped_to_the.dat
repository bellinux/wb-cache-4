5|$|Supplies {{could be}} flown into Wau if fighter cover was available. On 5 September, 12 planeloads of {{supplies}} were dropped at Kudjeru.

5|$|The {{nearby town}} of Wentworth was an {{important}} river port from which wool was <b>shipped</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> coast, and as such there was a variety of traffic in the area. In the 1890s, irrigated farming greatly expanded in Sunraysia region which {{is known for its}} fruit production, and traffic volumes increased further. It was decided to install a punt at this location (then known as Abbot's Ford).|$|E
5|$|The {{resulting}} {{combination of}} the M54 mount with the M3A1 Halftrack chassis was designated the M15A1 CGMC. A total of 1,052 were produced in 1943, and a further 600 in 1944. 100 M15s were <b>shipped</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Soviet Union for use under the Lend-Lease policy. Both the M42 mount and M15 CGMC were classified as obsolete in August 1946.|$|E
5|$|These {{innovations}} helped Sheffield to gain {{a worldwide}} recognition {{for the production of}} cutlery; utensils such as the bowie knife were mass-produced and <b>shipped</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> United States. The population of the town increased rapidly. In 1736 Sheffield and its surrounding hamlets held about 7000 people, in 1801 there were 60,000, and by 1901, the population had grown to 451,195.|$|E

5|$|A {{significant}} benefit of Operation Dragoon {{was the use}} of the port facilities in Southern France, especially the large ports at Marseille and Toulon. After Operation Cobra and Operation Dragoon, the Allied advance slowed almost to a halt in September due to a critical lack of supplies. The ports were quickly brought back into service, together with the railroad system in Southern France. Thereafter, large quantities of supplies could be moved north to ease the supply situation. In October, 524,894 tons of supplies were unloaded, which was more than one third of the Allied cargo <b>shipped</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Western front.|$|E
5|$|All of the inert {{versions}} {{went from}} the manufacturers directly to Wendover Army Air Field, Utah, by rail, where they were used by the 216th Base Unit in flight testing of the bomb. Some test drop missions were flown by the 509th Composite Group's 393d Bombardment Squadron as training exercises. The bombs intended as live ordnance were <b>shipped</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Naval Ammunition Depot, McAlester, Oklahoma, for filling with explosives. The Composition B was poured as a slurry, solidified in a drying facility for 36 hours, sealed, and shipped by railroad to the Port Chicago Naval Magazine, California, for shipment by sea to Tinian.|$|E
5|$|Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) {{plays an}} {{important}} role in phospholipid and cholesterol homeostasis. After binding ApoER2, ApoE is taken up into the cell and may remain in the intracellular space, be <b>shipped</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> cell surface, or be degraded. ApoE binding leads to the cleavage of ApoER2 into secreted proteins by the actions of the plasma membrane protein gamma secretase. ApoE may be the signalling ligand responsible for ApoER2's role in modulating the JNK signalling pathway.|$|E

5|$|Between 1942 and 1944 {{large numbers}} of Allied service {{personnel}} were buried in the military section of Brookwood cemetery. On the authority of Thomas B. Larkin, Quartermaster General of the United States Army, 3,600 bodies of US servicemen were exhumed in January–May 1948 and <b>shipped</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> United States for reburial. The railway service had been suspended in 1941, and North station (renamed North Bar after the ending of rail services) {{was used as a}} temporary mortuary to hold these bodies while awaiting shipment to the USA.|$|E
5|$|Construction of the {{original}} spacecraft was completed in August 2004. Following testing, the spacecraft was <b>shipped</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Plesetsk Cosmodrome in Russia during August 2005 and arrived on 1 September. The launch occurred from Site 133/3 on 8 October, however due to a missing command in the rocket's flight control system, the second stage engine did not shut {{down at the end}} of its planned burn, and instead the stage burned to depletion. This prevented the second stage and Briz-KM from separating, and as a result the rocket failed to achieve orbit. The spacecraft was lost when it reentered over the Arctic Ocean, north of Greenland.|$|E
5|$|In 1940 Julian {{was able}} to produce 100lb of mixed soy sterols daily, which had a value of $10,000 ($ today) as sex hormones. Julian was soon ozonizing 100 pounds daily of mixed sterol dibromides. The soy {{stigmasterol}} was easily converted into commercial quantities of the female hormone progesterone, and the first pound of progesterone he made, valued at $63,500 ($ today), was <b>shipped</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> buyer, Upjohn, in an armored car. Production of other sex hormones soon followed.|$|E
