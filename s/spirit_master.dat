6000|$|Whilst we {{were all}} {{attention}} to the parson's stories, our ears were suddenly assailed by a burst of heterogeneous sounds from the hall, in which was mingled something like the clang of rude minstrelsy, with the uproar of many small voices and girlish laughter. The door suddenly flew open, and a train came trooping into the room, that might almost have been mistaken for the breaking up of the court of Fairy. That indefatigable <b>spirit,</b> <b>Master</b> Simon, in the faithful discharge of his duties as Lord of Misrule, had conceived {{the idea of a}} Christmas mummery, or masking; and having called in to his assistance the Oxonian and the young officer, who were equally ripe for anything that should occasion romping and merriment, they had carried it into instant effect. The old housekeeper had been consulted; the antique clothes-presses and wardrobes rummaged and made to yield up the relics of finery that had not seen the light for several generations; the younger part of the company had been privately convened from the parlour and hall, and the whole had been bedizened out, into a burlesque imitation of an antique masque.* ...|$|E

50|$|Another ethnographic {{example of}} {{religious}} beliefs facilitating resource management {{comes from the}} Tyva people, a pastoralist population in southern Siberia. They associate ritual structures called cairns with local <b>spirit</b> <b>masters</b> (cher eezi). These structures demarcate local territories in which <b>spirit</b> <b>masters</b> reside, and the expectation to stop and give prayer offerings out of respect to cher eezi is embedded in peoples' beliefs about them. The cher eezi {{are believed to be}} amoral and care mostly about activity within their sacred territories, such as hunting and overexploiting resources that belong to them. More recently, Tyva people have begun facing new challenges associated with urbanization (e.g., pollution, alcohol abuse), and the cher eezi have been more frequently believed to be concerned about these same problems.|$|R

50|$|The film {{opens with}} Ugr Pratap, the <b>spirit</b> <b>master,</b> {{hot on the}} trail of an evil spirit {{possessing}} the body of a young village girl. He tracks down the spirit but is not able to subdue it and the girl (under the spirit) plunges to her death and curses Ugr Pratap with the annihilation of his family. This horrible curse results in the brutal death of Ugr Pratap's innocent family and Ugr Pratap is accused of murdering them. The well meaning psychiatrist Dr Bharadwaj gets the court to send Ugr Pratap to a quiet psychiatric facility rather than the gallows. Dr Bharadwaj explains that he, too, often encounters paranormal patients who need spiritual rather than psychiatric help and Ugr Pratap is the only person who can help them.|$|E

40|$|Reinforcement and overleaming as {{teaching}} techniques have readily been acknowledged as necessary for learning-disabled children. These techniques—along with individualization of material—are the {{challenges faced by}} resource room teachers, classroom teachers, and teachers of self-contained classes, as well. One of the most readily available resources for teaching is the basal reader, which lends itself to a multitude of opportunities for individualization, reinforcement, and overleaming of vocabu-lary, phonetic skills, language structure, and comprehension. Excellent opportunities for individualizing instruction (without {{the use of the}} burdensome <b>spirit</b> <b>master</b> machine) are possible with selective and creative use of the basal reader. The "Strategy Sheet, " a specific list of activities, can be developed for use with the entire class. Each person retains a master copy, and as lessons are developed, the strategies listed can be organ-ized to meet a specific group or individual need. For example, a group working with parts of speech could be assigned items 1, 2, and 3 (listing proper nouns, predicate nouns, and predicate adjectives) as indicated later in this article. Students working with comprehension could be assigned items 28, 29, and 30 (summarizing main idea and time elements). Thus, students not Elinore M.

5000|$|The Evenki, {{like most}} nomadic, pastoral, and {{subsistence}} agrarian peoples, {{spend most of}} their lives in very close contact with nature. Because of this, they develop what A. A. Sirina calls an [...] "ecological ethic". By this she means [...] "a system of responsibility of people to nature and her <b>spirit</b> <b>masters,</b> and of nature to people"(9). Sirina interviewed many Evenks who until very recently spent much of their time as reindeer herders in the taiga, just like their ancestors. The Evenki people also spoke along the same lines: their respect for nature and their belief that nature is a living being.|$|R
40|$|In Mongolia, {{among the}} nomadic herders of sheep, goats and horses, the wolf {{is the main}} enemy of the herds and a prestigious prey. It is feared because it can hurt many herd animals without eating them {{and it is also}} admired for its intelligence. The wolf is the dog of the <b>spirit</b> <b>master</b> of the land, which owns and protects the wild animals living in it. Killing a wolf is never random, it isn’t killed but “given” by its supernatural master. According to a fragmentary Gelukpa Buddhist ideology, only a virtuous hunter can be granted such a prey and {{incorporate}} its vital potential (hiimor’). After the kill, the successful hunter attaches one of the wolf’s ankle bones (taken from a back leg) to his belt. The hunter’s wife cannot wear a wolf’s ankle bone because it would affect negatively the vital force of her husband. Only elder men can wear a coat made of wolf’s furs and drink its raw blood. The furs and the blood are too “hot” and too “strong” for women and children. The fur can be attached to the northern wall of the yurt – the most respected one – or fixed on a jeep’s boot. The question I want to address is why a dead wolf’s parts have to be seen. What point of view do they create {{in the eye of the}} viewer? What is their “agency” (Gell 1998) ? What do they reveal about men, women, elders and shamans’ bodies...|$|E

40|$|The autor re-propose in this monography the Sor texts {{collected}} by N. P. Dyrenkova between 1925 and 1932, {{and published by}} the same scholar in 1940.

The brief texts which are translated and annotated deal with the concept of the <b>spirit</b> <b>masters</b> of the mountains and rivers; they are etiological representations; they reflect the material culture such as hunting and fishing; tales relating to the history of the Sor people. They are also shamanic prayers, invocations and exorcisms. ...|$|R

50|$|The special aniline dyes {{for making}} the master image {{came in the form}} of ink or in pens, pencils, carbon paper and even {{typewriter}} ribbon. Hectograph pencils and pens are sometimes still available. Various other inks have been found usable to varying degrees in the process; <b>master</b> sheets for <b>spirit</b> duplicators have also been pressed into service. Unlike a <b>spirit</b> duplicator <b>master,</b> a hectograph master is not a mirror image. Thus, when using a <b>spirit</b> duplicator <b>master</b> with a hectograph, one writes on the back of the purple sheet, using it like carbon paper to produce an image on the white sheet, rather than writing on the front of the white sheet to produce a mirror image on its back.|$|R
