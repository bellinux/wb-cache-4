5|$|American's service {{peaked in}} 1992 with 265 daily departures, after which flights were {{gradually}} <b>scaled</b> back until the hub eventually closed in 1995. American cited {{the aftermath of}} the early 1990s recession and the lack of local passengers as reasons for the closure. As American <b>scaled</b> down its operations, it subleased its gates to other carriers, largely in order to cover the debt used to construct the hub facilities, which American had guaranteed. Southwest Airlines quickly filled the void by seizing 54% of the Nashville market and making it a focus city, with American remaining as the second-largest carrier at Nashville, followed by Delta Air Lines.|$|E
