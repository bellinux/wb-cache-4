A power plane is the counterpart to a ground plane and behaves as an AC <b>signal</b> <b>ground</b> while providing DC power to the circuits mounted on the PCB. Signal interconnections are traced on signal planes. Signal planes {{can be on the}} outer as well as inner layers. For optimal EMI performance high frequency signals are routed in internal layers between power or ground planes.|$|E

A {{single sided}} supply op-amp {{is one where}} the input and output {{voltages}} can be as low as the negative power supply voltage instead of needing {{to be at least}} two volts above it. [...] The result is that it can operate in many applications with the negative supply pin on the op-amp being connected to the <b>signal</b> <b>ground,</b> thus eliminating the need for a separate negative power supply.|$|E
2500|$|Voltage is {{measured}} on an interval scale, {{which means that}} only differences can be measured. To measure the voltage of a single point, a reference point must be selected to measure against. This common reference point is called [...] "ground" [...] and considered to have zero voltage. This <b>signal</b> <b>ground</b> {{may or may not}} be connected to a power ground. A system where the system ground is not connected to another circuit or to earth (though there may still be AC coupling) is often referred to as a floating ground or double-insulated.|$|E

25|$|<b>Signal</b> <b>grounds</b> {{serve as}} return paths for signals and power (at extra low voltages, less than about 50 V) within equipment, {{and on the}} signal {{interconnections}} between equipment. Many electronic designs feature a single return {{that acts as a}} reference for all signals. Power and <b>signal</b> <b>grounds</b> often get connected, usually through the metal case of the equipment. Designers of printed circuit boards must take care in the layout of electronic systems so that high-power or rapidly switching currents in one part of a system do not inject noise into low-level sensitive parts of a system due to some common impedance in the grounding traces of the layout.|$|R

2500|$|An {{electrical}} connection to earth {{can be used}} as a reference potential for radio frequency signals for certain kinds of antennas. The part directly in contact with the earth - the [...] "earth electrode" [...] - can be as simple as a metal rod or stake driven into the earth, or a connection to buried metal water piping (the pipe must be conductive). Because high frequency signals can flow to earth due to capacitative effects, capacitance to ground is an important factor in effectiveness of signal grounds. Because of this, a complex system of buried rods and wires can be effective. An ideal <b>signal</b> <b>ground</b> maintains a fixed potential (zero) regardless of how much electric current flows into ground or out of ground. Low impedance at the signal frequency of the electrode-to-earth connection determines its quality, and that quality is improved by increasing the surface area of the electrode in contact with the earth, increasing the depth to which it is driven, using several connected ground rods, increasing the moisture content of the soil, improving the conductive mineral content of the soil, and increasing the land area covered by the ground system.|$|E
2500|$|In {{television}} stations, recording studios, {{and other}} installations where signal quality is critical, a special <b>signal</b> <b>ground</b> {{known as a}} [...] "technical ground" [...] (or [...] "technical earth", [...] "special earth", and [...] "audio earth") is often installed, to prevent ground loops. This is basically {{the same thing as}} an AC power ground, but no general appliance ground wires are allowed any connection to it, as they may carry electrical interference. For example, only audio equipment is connected to the technical ground in a recording studio. In most cases, the studio's metal equipment racks are all joined together with heavy copper cables (or flattened copper tubing or busbars) and similar connections are made to the technical ground. Great care is taken that no general chassis grounded appliances are placed on the racks, as a single AC ground connection to the technical ground will destroy its effectiveness. For particularly demanding applications, the main technical ground may consist of a heavy copper pipe, if necessary fitted by drilling through several concrete floors, such that all technical grounds may be connected by the shortest possible path to a grounding rod in the basement.|$|E

5000|$|Types II to IV are {{variants}} which {{attempt to}} overcome the main limitation of Type I, which is the reference to Earth {{at each end of}} the circuit. Types II-IV use the Signal Battery (SB) and <b>Signal</b> <b>Ground</b> (SG) lead in conjunction with the E&M wires. This improves noise immunity as the <b>Signal</b> <b>Ground</b> does not carry the same heavy currents as normal Ground connections and provides a low resistance return path for signaling. However, if the main Ground connection fails all Earth current may flow via the interface, causing signaling failure, hum and in extreme cases destruction of equipment.|$|E
5000|$|A common {{communications}} link {{used by many}} people is the asynchronous start-stop, or just [...] "asynchronous", serial link. If you have an external modem attached to your home or office computer, the chances are that the connection is over an asynchronous serial connection. Its advantage {{is that it is}} simple [...] - [...] it can be implemented using only three wires: Send, Receive and <b>Signal</b> <b>Ground</b> (or Signal Common). In an RS232 interface, an idle connection has a continuous negative voltage applied. A 'zero' bit is represented as a positive voltage difference with respect to the <b>Signal</b> <b>Ground</b> and a 'one' bit is a negative voltage with respect to <b>signal</b> <b>ground,</b> thus indistinguishable from the idle state. This means you need to know when a 'one' bit starts to distinguish it from idle. This is done by agreeing in advance how fast data will be transmitted over a link, then using a start bit to signal the start of a byte [...] - [...] this start bit will be a 'zero' bit. Stop bits are 'one' bits i.e. negative voltage.|$|E

2500|$|In December 1942, the War Department {{directed}} the Signal Corps General Development Laboratories and the Camp Evans Signal Lab to combine into the <b>Signal</b> Corps <b>Ground</b> Service (SCGS) with headquarters at Bradley Beach, New Jersey (Hotel Grossman). The Department also {{directed the}} <b>Signal</b> Corps <b>Ground</b> Service to cut total {{military and civilian}} personnel from 14,518 military and civilian personnel to 8,879 by August 1943. In June 1944, [...] "Signees", former Italian prisoners of war, arrived at Fort Monmouth to perform housekeeping duties. A lieutenant colonel and 500 enlisted men became hospital, mess, and repair shop attendants, relieving American soldiers from these duties.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "hot" [...] {{signal wire}} and <b>signal</b> <b>ground</b> {{provided}} by an RCA connection implement an unbalanced connection. A true balanced connection is generally preferred in certain applications, particularly professional settings, {{because it allows}} {{for the use of}} long cables while reducing susceptibility to external noise.|$|E
50|$|Initially these {{networks}} {{were made of}} metallic conductive media, however {{the vulnerability of the}} 56-64 kbit/s channels to electromagnetic interference, <b>signal</b> <b>ground</b> loops, and ground potential rise made them too unreliable for the power industry. Strong electromagnetic fields caused by the high voltages and currents in power lines occur regularly in electric substations.|$|E
50|$|In {{practice}} this case usually {{does not happen}} because the pickup cartridge, an inductive voltage source, need have no connection to the turntable metalwork, and so the <b>signal</b> <b>ground</b> is isolated from the chassis or protective ground at that end of the link. Therefore there is no current loop, and no hum problem due directly to the grounding arrangements.|$|E
50|$|Applications {{range from}} the {{transmission}} of mobile radio signals (3G, 4G, 5G and WiFi) and the transmission of cable television signals (CATV) to the transmission of RF L-Band <b>signals</b> in <b>ground</b> stations for satellite communications.|$|R

50|$|Another {{system which}} {{is vital to}} a {{spacecraft}} is the command and telemetry system, so much in fact, {{that it is the}} first system to be redundant. The communication from the ground to the spacecraft {{is the responsibility of the}} command system. The telemetry system handles communications from the spacecraft to the <b>ground.</b> <b>Signals</b> from <b>ground</b> stations are sent to command the spacecraft what to do, while telemetry reports back on the status of those commands including spacecraft vitals and mission specific data.|$|R
5000|$|One such {{source of}} ground noise is the {{isolated}} ground loop. The isolated ground loop {{differs from the}} ground loop in {{that there is no}} secondary connection to power supply ground or other non-signal ground. Instead two <b>signal</b> <b>ground</b> conductors (such as the outer conductor of stereo coaxial audio wire) are common at the amplifier input (by an internal connection in the multi-channel amplifier), they travel some distance whereupon they experience different induction currents and then are made common at some other secondary location (typically a multi-channel signal source device), as in stereo patch cords. The induction currents being different for each of the two outer coaxial conductors set up a current between the two which results in a difference in potential appearing at the negative input terminals at the amplifier, with respect to the positive input terminals. The problem is made worse by the increasing the length of the cables, and their proximity to devices radiating magnetic noise. One solution to this problem incorporates the use of a single ground conductor as a shield (see coax) and the use of multiple other separated internal conductors as positive signal wires inside a single shield conductor, allowing for several separate and distinct positive signals to all arrive at the amplifier input referenced to a single ground shield conductor. This method also insures that all the signal conductors and the single ground shield conductor (like coax) all experience similar induction of unwanted signals. Another solution is the incorporation of [...] "star topology" [...] signal grounding technique wherein no <b>signal</b> <b>ground</b> ever connects to any other <b>signal</b> <b>ground,</b> except at a single centralized location.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>signal</b> <b>ground</b> is {{a common}} return for the other connections; it appears on two pins in the Yost {{standard}} but is the same signal.
