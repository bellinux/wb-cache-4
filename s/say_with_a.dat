In the case of the Taylor series the error is very small in a neighbourhood of the point where it is computed, while it may be very large at a distant point.

500|$|Anderson {{sought to}} capture the nostalgic feel of the 1950s. In this effort, he used several themes {{associated}} with the time period, including alien invasion movies, nuclear threats, Cold War paranoia, and optimism in the future. About the time period, Anderson said [...] "it seemed like {{this was a time}} when you could <b>say</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> straight face, 'I'm fighting for truth, justice and the American way.'" [...] For the characters Anderson was picturing George Reeves's Superman and Noel Neill's Lois Lane as portrayed in the 1950s television series Adventures of Superman. One reviewer noted that Anderson's portrayal of Lex Luthor is that of the post-Crisis on Infinite Earths amoral businessman and Batman was more reminiscent of a 1930s-style or a [...] ""-style Batman where he is actively pursued by the police.|$|E

2500|$|Stokowski {{appeared}} as {{himself in the}} motion picture The Big Broadcast of 1937, conducting two of his Bach transcriptions. That same year he also conducted and acted in One Hundred Men and a Girl, with Deanna Durbin and Adolphe Menjou. In 1939, Stokowski collaborated with Walt Disney to create the motion picture {{for which he is}} best known: Fantasia. He conducted all the music (with the exception of a [...] "jam session" [...] {{in the middle of the}} film) and included his own orchestrations for the Toccata and Fugue in D minor and Night on Bald Mountain/Ave Maria segments. Stokowski even got to talk to (and shake hands with) Mickey Mouse on screen, although he would later <b>say</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> smile that Mickey Mouse got to shake hands with him. This footage of Stokowski was incorporated into Fantasia 2000.|$|E

2500|$|Following {{the release}} of the single, Ian Cohen dubbed the song [...] "Best New Music" [...] on Pitchfork commenting, [...] "on her {{stirring}} debut single, New York singer-songwriter Lizzy Grant transforms into the more bombastically named Lana Del Rey and absolutely wallows in it." [...] Digital Spy writer Robert Copsey noted Del Rey [...] "combines a near-identical [...] vocal with her own fascination for the tragically glamorous— or 'Hollywood sadcore' as she succinctly labels it." [...] Lewis Corner, also of Digital Spy, said, [...] "New York-born, London-based Lana Del Rey is currently working on her debut album, but if this newly released preview track/video is anything to go by, it's going to be avant-garde pop at its very best." [...] Alexis Petridis of The Guardian considered [...] "Video Games" [...] the best song of 2011 and added, [...] "it's tempting to <b>say</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> song that good it doesn't matter who sings it, but that's not strictly true. As pop divas who collaborate with Eg White go, Lana Del Rey sounds hugely understated." ...|$|E
2500|$|There {{is clearly}} some {{justification}} for ranking Tours-Poitiers {{among the most}} significant events in Frankish history when one considers {{the result of the}} battle in light of the remarkable record of the successful establishment by Muslims of Islamic political and cultural dominance along the entire eastern and southern rim of the former Christian, Roman world. The rapid Muslim conquest of Palestine, Syria, Egypt and the North African coast all the way to Morocco in the seventh century resulted in the permanent imposition by force of Islamic culture onto a previously Christian and largely non-Arab base. The Visigothic kingdom fell to Muslim conquerors in a single battle on the Rio Barbate in 711, and the Hispanic Christian population took seven long centuries to regain control of the Iberian Peninsula. The Reconquista, of course, was completed in 1492, only months before Columbus received official backing for his fateful voyage across the Atlantic Ocean. Had Charles Martel suffered at Tours-Poitiers the fate of King Roderic at the Rio Barbate, it is doubtful that a [...] "do-nothing" [...] sovereign of the Merovingian realm could have later succeeded where his talented major domus had failed. Indeed, as Charles was the progenitor of the Carolingian line of Frankish rulers and grandfather of Charlemagne, one can even <b>say</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> degree of certainty that the subsequent history of the West would have proceeded along vastly different currents had 'Abd ar-Rahman been victorious at Tours-Poitiers in 732.|$|E
2500|$|Sting in the Tail {{generally}} received positive reviews. Thom Jurek from AllMusic {{stated that}} [...] "as a farewell, Sting in the Tail is an album the Scorpions and their fans {{can be proud}} of". Scott Alisoglu from Blabbermouth.net said that the album is a [...] "very good representation of what makes the Scorpions a truly classic heavy metal band". Kevin Wierzbicki from antiMusic.com rated this album with {{three and a half}} stars commenting that [...] "Sting in the Tail is pretty much a typical Scorpions effort filled with well-performed but ultimately forgettable rockers". Two reviewers gave the album almost full score. Tony Antunovich from Metaleater.com gave the album A- stating that [...] "is a solid effort and focuses primarily on slightly toned-down Rock anthems performed in SCORPIONS style", while Aniruddh [...] "Andrew" [...] Bansal of Metal Assault nine and a half out of ten by saying that [...] "If this really is the last album they would ever record, I would <b>say</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> heavy heart that it's the perfect way to say goodbye to the fans" [...] Ruben Mosqueda from Sleaze Roxx gave a positive review to the album by saying that [...] "Sting in the Tail is a near perfect album and one hell of a way to wind up a career". Former drummer Herman Rarebell said [...] "I like the new album very much. I think that is the way people hear the Scorpions." ...|$|E
