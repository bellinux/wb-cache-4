5|$|A belief {{from the}} Leskovac region states the ala is a monster with an {{enormous}} mouth who holds in her hand a big wooden spoon, with which she grabs and devours everything that gets in her way. One story has it that a man kept such an ala in his barn; <b>she</b> <b>drank</b> thirty liters of milk every day. Another warns that ale {{in the form of}} twelve ravens used to take the crops from vineyards.|$|E
5|$|David's {{private life}} was less felicitous. In April 1963 her affair with Higgins {{came to an}} end when he remarried. For a period <b>she</b> <b>drank</b> too much brandy and resorted too often to {{sleeping}} pills. Probably {{as a result of these}} factors and overwork, in 1963, when she was 49, David suffered a cerebral haemorrhage. She kept the news of the event within her close circle of friends—none of the editors of the publications she worked for were aware of the collapse—as she did not want her reputation as a hard worker to be damaged. She recovered, but her confidence was badly shaken and her sense of taste was temporarily affected; for a period she could not taste salt, or the effect salt had on what she was cooking, but her sense of smell of frying onions was so enhanced as to be unpleasant for her.|$|E
5|$|At the palace, Charming {{struggles with}} his {{feelings}} for Snow. The King (Alan Dale) commands him to forget her because the marriage to Abigail is worth great wealth to the kingdom. Charming sends a letter by carrier pigeon to Snow begging {{her to come}} and see him so they can be together. The letter reaches her just before she can take the potion. Snow makes it to the palace but she is seized by the guards and thrown into the dungeon. There she meets a dwarf named Grumpy (Lee Arenberg), who was falsely imprisoned for stealing a diamond that he wanted to give to his girlfriend. Another dwarf, Stealthy (Geoff Gustafson), shows up to rescue Grumpy, who asks Stealthy to free Snow as well. The guards kill Stealthy as they try to escape and try to recapture Grumpy. Snow threatens to burn down the palace unless they let Grumpy go and take her in his place. The King tells Snow he will not let her interfere with the wedding. She must tell Charming she does not love him, or the King will kill him. Snow obeys because she loves Charming too much to let him die, but both are left heartbroken. Snow leaves and is soon joined by Grumpy and six other dwarfs, who offer her a place to stay. She considers the potion but Grumpy warns her that those feelings however painful, are part of her. Charming calls off the wedding to look for Snow and the dwarves hear about it from Red Riding Hood. Grumpy joyfully tells Snow the good news, but she has forgotten about Charming. The pain was too great to bear and <b>she</b> <b>drank</b> the potion.|$|E

25|$|During the Babylonian captivity, Daniel and {{his fellow}} Jews abstained from the meat and wine given {{to them by the}} king because they saw it as defiling in some way, though {{precisely}} how these would have defiled the Jews is not apparent in the text.

25|$|One story {{associated}} with the siege, which is related by Nigel Tranter, is that the great cannon Mons Meg was built in Kirkcudbright by a smith named Mollance.

25|$|In a {{televised}} interview with Piers Morgan in July 2009, Price claimed that their break-up was {{partly due to}} Andre's jealousy of her relationship with dressage trainer Andrew Gould, which she claimed was entirely platonic, but it finally ended when she was photographed in a Bristol nightclub after she and Andre had agreed {{that they would not}} go out without each other. Andre didn't trust Katie when <b>she</b> <b>drank</b> alcohol hence they had made the pact.

500|$|As a child, Zelda Sayre was {{extremely}} active. She danced, took ballet lessons {{and enjoyed the}} outdoors. In 1914, Sayre began attending Sidney Lanier High School. She was bright, but uninterested in her lessons. Her work in ballet continued into high school, where she had an active social life. <b>She</b> <b>drank,</b> smoked and {{spent much of her}} time with boys, and she remained a leader in the local youth social scene. A newspaper article about one of her dance performances quoted her as saying that she cared only about [...] "boys and swimming." [...] She developed an appetite for attention, actively seeking to flout convention—whether by dancing the Charleston, or by wearing a tight, flesh-colored bathing suit to fuel rumors that she swam nude. Her father's reputation was something of a safety net, preventing her social ruin, but Southern women of the time were expected to be delicate, docile and accommodating. Consequently, Sayre's antics were shocking to many of those around her, and she became—along with her childhood friend and future Hollywood starlet Tallulah Bankhead—a mainstay of Montgomery gossip. Her ethos was encapsulated beneath her high-school graduation photo: ...|$|E
500|$|For {{her work}} as Sue Ellen, Gray was {{nominated}} for a Primetime Emmy Award in the category [...] "Best Actress in a Drama Series" [...] in 1981 (Barbara Bel Geddes who played Miss Ellie Ewing was also nominated in that category for Dallas that year). Gray was also nominated for a Golden Globe Award in both 1980 and 1981 in the category of [...] "Best Performance by an Actress in a Television Series - Drama" [...] respectively. The character of Sue Ellen was well received by television critics. The Biography Channel said, [...] "Who could ever forget Dallas with the gin-swilling Sue Ellen Ewing, replete with shoulder pads long before Dynasty, staggering around Southfork Ranch with a permanently tearful expression as she suffered the brunt of J.R. Ewing's evil ways?" [...] The Boulevard Magazine said, It may be 2009 and seventeen years since the primetime drama Dallas went off the air, but memories of the Ewing family still linger. Corruption and betrayal, lies, greed, affairs and scandal – all were just part of another day at the Southfork Ranch. At the center of it all was one of our favorite Ewings, the person we couldn't help but root for each week as <b>she</b> <b>drank</b> and slept her way through one ordeal after another. This, of course, was the tortured and (sometimes) villainous Sue Ellen Shepard Ewing, former Texas beauty queen and trophy wife of the womanizing rogue J.R.

500|$|Grossmith {{took to the}} {{professional}} stage in 1870 with a sketch called Human Oddities, written by his father, and a song called [...] "The Gay Photographer" [...] (that is, the [...] "carefree" [...] photographer). The song, with words by Grossmith's father and music by young Grossmith, concerns a photographer who broke {{the heart of a}} young lady named Miss Jenkins; so <b>she</b> <b>drank</b> his chemicals and died.

[...] An 1871 Grossmith sketch was called He was a Careful Man. Biographer Tony Joseph notes that, except for a few early pieces, nearly all of Grossmith's material was written and composed by Grossmith himself. [...] Joseph describes the sketches as [...] "a light-hearted sending up of various aspects of contemporary life and manners. ...he was the complete performer... as a pianist (he performed for the most part sitting at a piano)... as a raconteur... as a mimic, facial expression, timing—he had it all. [...] A short, dapper figure, he turned his lack of inches to positive advantage, and audiences took to him everywhere." ...|$|E
500|$|Air safety {{investigators}} attributed Vulović's survival to {{her being}} trapped by a food cart in the DC-9's fuselage as it {{broke away from}} the rest of the aircraft and plummeted towards the ground. When the cabin depressurized, the passengers and other flight crew were sucked out of the aircraft and fell to their deaths. Investigators believed that the fuselage, with Vulović pinned inside, landed at an angle in a heavily wooded and snow-covered mountainside, which cushioned the impact. Vulović disputed the assertion that she was discovered in the aircraft's fuselage on the basis of her conversations with Honke. [...] "The man who found me... told me that I was in the middle part of the plane," [...] she said. [...] "I was found with my head down and my colleague on top of me. One part of my body with my leg was in the plane and my head was out of the plane. A catering trolley was pinned against my spine and kept me in the plane." [...] Vulović's physicians concluded that her history of low blood pressure caused her to pass out quickly after the cabin depressurized and kept her heart from bursting on impact. Vulović said that she was aware of her low blood pressure before applying to become a flight attendant and knew that it would result in her failing her medical examination, but <b>she</b> <b>drank</b> an exorbitant amount of coffee beforehand and was accepted.|$|E
500|$|In 2002, Susan {{developed}} retrograde amnesia. The storyline saw Susan slip on some spilt {{milk and}} sustain a minor head injury.

[...] Woodburne revealed [...] "Susan keeps asking when she's going to be allowed home to see her parents, and eventually Karl breaks the news - her parents are long dead and she's actually 45, not 16 as she believes. And on top of that, Karl is her husband!" [...] Susan turns to her daughter Libby – who she believes is her sister Carmel (Kirsty Child) – for comfort. But when Libby confirms what Karl has told her, Susan leaves the hospital. Susan spots some students in Seventies clothes and she follows them to a Seventies themed party at Erinsborough High. However, the students recognise Susan as their principal, which distresses her. Susan ends up in the bathroom and she sees herself in the mirror {{for the first time since}} the accident, and is shocked to see a middle-aged woman staring back at her.|$|E
