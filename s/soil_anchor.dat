We first created a soil model in the laboratory and then performed a nondestructive experiment on the <b>soil</b> <b>anchor</b> using the stress wave reflection method. Our study displays variable characteristics of the acceleration response curve of a <b>soil</b> <b>anchor</b> under transient excitation. The fixed end reflection signal was very strong, while the reflected signal from the embedded end was weak. This is mainly caused by attenuation of both the fixed reflection signal and the stress wave.

Many {{studies on the}} anchor plates, both theoretical and experimental, have been conducted, although the existing works were mainly performed on regular and symmetrical anchor plates. A new anchor system is an irregular and non-symmetry shape anchor. This is an innovative system due to the special shape and the penetration into soils. Two sizes of irregular-shaped anchors, 159 and 297 mm, were used. The non-symmetry anchor employed in the system contributes to its good performance and high pullout load capacity. The maximum resistance increased based on the embedment ratio and {{the density of the}} sand. An important innovation of this system is the installation method, where it does not require excavation and grouting. The main objective of this research is to validate the break-out factors and the ultimate uplift capacity load of the irregular-shaped anchor with the existing researches related to anchor plates. The experimental research was performed on the models in a chamber box. For the 159 mm-width irregular-shaped anchor, an embedment ratio L/D between 1 and 7 and for the 297 mm-width embedment ratio L/D between 1 and 4 were employed. The irregular-shaped anchors were used in dry, loose and dense sand. The new irregular-shaped anchors are compatible with the symmetrical anchor plates as determined by existing researchers...|$|E

The numerical modelling of actual pullout response is achieved by axisymmetric and horizontal loading condition. The effect of varying number of helical plates, helical plate spacing and helical plate diameter is studied to understand the pullout capacity behaviour. The failure surfaces for various helical soil nail configurations and their pullout mechanisms are also analysed and discussed. The pullout capacity is found to increase with increase in number of helical plates.

This assumption provides numerical advantages and the problem can solved in two dimensions. In contrast to recent numerical studies, this paper applies three dimensional numerical limit analysis and axi-symetrical displacement finite element analysis to evaluate the effect of anchor shape on the pullout capacity of horizontal anchors in sand.

Fiber-optic sensors have been established as a new and innovative measurement technology in very different fields, such as material science, civil engineering, light-weight structures, geotechnical areas as well as chemical and high-voltage substations. Very often, mechanical quantities such as deformation, strain or vibration are requested. However, measurement of chemical quantities in materials and structure components, such as pH value in steel reinforced concrete members also provides information about the integrity of concrete structures. A special fiber-optic chemical sensor for monitoring the alkaline state (pH value) of the cementitious matrix in steel-reinforced concrete structures {{with the purpose of}} early detection of corrosion-initiating factors is described. The paper presents the use of several fiber-optic sensor technologies in engineering. One example concerns the use of highly resolving concrete-embeddable fiber Fabry-Perot acoustic emission (AE) sensors for the assessment of the bearing behaviour of large concrete piles in existing foundations or during and after its installation. Another example concerns fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors attached to anchor steels (micro piles) to measure the strain distribution in loaded <b>soil</b> <b>anchors.</b> Polymer optical fibers (POF) can be — because of their high elasticity and high ultimate strain — well integrated into textiles to monitor their deformation behaviour.

The third configuration is a three-bladed rotor with a rigid hub and fixed pitch blades. In all configurations the diameter of the rotor is 38 meters and the axis of rotation is 30. 4 meters above grade, and the power output is 200 kW and 400 kW.

These functions {{are carried out}} by a system of rhizoids in early diverging groups of land plants, such as mosses, liverworts and hornworts. Physcomitrella patens RHD SIX-LIKE 1 (PpRSL 1) and PpRSL 2 transcription factors are necessary for rhizoid development in mosses. Similar proteins, AtRHD 6 and AtRSL 1, control the development of root hairs in Arabidopsis thaliana. Auxin positively regulates root hair development independently of AtRHD 6 and AtRSL 1 in A. thaliana but the regulatory interactions between auxin and PpRSL 1 and PpRSL 2 are unknown. We show here that co-expression of PpRSL 1 and PpRSL 2 is sufficient {{for the development of}} the rhizoid system in the moss P. patens; constitutive expression of PpRSL 1 and PpRSL 2 converts developing leafy shoot axes (gametophores) into rhizoids. During wild-type development, PpRSL 1 and PpRSL 2 are expressed in the specialized cells that develop rhizoids, indicating that cell-specific expression of PpRSL 1 and PpRSL 2 is sufficient to promote rhizoid differentiation during wild-type P. patens development. In contrast to A. thaliana, auxin promotes rhizoid development by positively regulating PpRSL 1 and PpRSL 2 activity in P. patens. This indicates that even though the same genes control the development of root hairs and rhizoids, the regulation of this transcriptional network by auxin is different in these two species.

40|$|The {{graduation}} thesis {{focuses on}} providing insight in {{the consequences of}} subsiding ground on <b>soil</b> <b>anchors.</b> With the years, the bars of an anchored sheet pile walls for example, can be unfavourably loaded due to subsiding soil. As {{a result of these}} lateral loads, the bar will deform and elongate, causing the stresses to increase. The applicability of the current design method of CUR 166 is limited. Hereby referring to using it for determining the deformation of anchors in common situations, such as inclined anchors crossing multiple layers of soil. Because of the ambiguities and limitations of this method, the report will verify and modify the design method of CUR 166. While looking at the issues regarding subsiding soil, distinction will be made between the soil behaviour around the anchor {{and the way in which}} the anchor bar deforms due to the soil load. As a way of gaining insight in the consequences of subsiding <b>soil</b> on <b>anchors,</b> Deltares has conducted model tests on small sized bars and measured the resulting loads. By simulating these tests with Plaxis 2 D has the way subsiding soil loads the bars been defined. In contrast to the current method of CUR 166, the value of the shear strength should depend on the drained or undrained behavior of the soil. The result is an almost constant value for the factor to determine the load with, this in contrast to the currently used variable / unclear factor. The subsidence process loads the anchor laterally and causes it to deform. A new design method (vernieuwde rekenmethode) has been created in order to approximate the deformation and stress–strain curve of the anchor with along the free anchor length. This method is applicable for a wide range of situations, including the loading of inclined anchors crossing multiple layers of soil. The current method uses an elastic calculation to verify the stresses with the regulations. The possibilities of using a plastic calculation have been researched. Due to the displacement controlled nature of subsiding soil loading the bar, can the bending moments be absorbed by the yielding of the bar. As long as the curve of the yielding anchor bar is not obstructed by supports, the rotational capacity of the anchor will be sufficiently large to allow for yielding of the steel. In Plaxis 2 D and 3 D has the applicability of an embedded pile as an anchorage been researched in order to verify it with the vernieuwde rekenmethode. When comparing the different methods, it can be concluded that the resulting increase in axial anchor force due to subsiding soil, defined with the CUR 166, is conservative compared to the Plaxis simulation and the vernieuwde rekenmethode.

The main problems to be studied in this project are the results obtained from field pullout test are different from the calculated theoretical values and there is a non-zero intercept at relationship of pullout force against overburden pressure.
