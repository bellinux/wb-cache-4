5|$|The BC Express ran until November 1920 {{and then}} it joined the BX on the {{riverbank}} at Fort George, where their hulls were abandoned. In a <b>sense,</b> <b>they</b> lived on, as their engines and equipment were shipped to Northern Alberta {{to work on the}} Mackenzie River for the Alberta and Arctic Transportation Company.|$|E
5|$|Electrical {{generators}} and alternators are frequently used as portable welding power supplies, {{but because of}} lower efficiency and greater costs, they are less frequently used in industry. Maintenance also {{tends to be more}} difficult, because of the complexities of using a combustion engine as a power source. However, in one <b>sense</b> <b>they</b> are simpler: the use of a separate rectifier is unnecessary because they can provide either AC or DC. However, the engine driven units are most practical in field work where the welding often must be done out of doors and in locations where transformer type welders are not usable because there is no power source available to be transformed.|$|E
5|$|The Hubble {{classification}} system rates elliptical galaxies {{on the basis}} of their ellipticity, ranging from E0, being nearly spherical, up to E7, which is highly elongated. These galaxies have an ellipsoidal profile, giving them an elliptical appearance regardless of the viewing angle. Their appearance shows little structure and they typically have relatively little interstellar matter. Consequently, these galaxies also have a low portion of open clusters and a reduced rate of new star formation. Instead they are dominated by generally older, more evolved stars that are orbiting the common center of gravity in random directions. The stars contain low abundances of heavy elements because star formation ceases after the initial burst. In this <b>sense</b> <b>they</b> have some similarity to the much smaller globular clusters.|$|E

5|$|The rivers Mersey and Irwell {{were first}} made navigable {{in the early}} 18th century. Goods were also transported on the Runcorn {{extension}} of the Bridgewater Canal (from 1776) and the Liverpool and Manchester Railway (from 1830), but by the late 19th century the Mersey and Irwell Navigation had fallen into disrepair and was often unusable. In addition, Manchester's business community viewed the charges imposed by Liverpool's docks and the railway companies as excessive. A ship canal was therefore proposed {{as a way of}} giving ocean-going vessels direct access to Manchester. The region was suffering from the effects of the Long Depression, and for the canal's proponents, who argued that the scheme would boost competition and create jobs, the idea of a ship canal made sound economic <b>sense.</b> <b>They</b> initiated a public campaign to enlist support for the scheme, which was first presented to Parliament as a bill in 1882. Faced with stiff opposition from Liverpool, the canal's supporters were unable to gain the necessary Act of Parliament to allow the scheme to go ahead until 1885.|$|E

25|$|Earliest {{mentioned}} Bosnian bans are Borić (1154–1163) and Kulin (1163–1204), {{when the}} medieval Bosnia {{had a similar}} suzerain status that Croatia had towards the king of Hungary. Nevertheless, the Bosnian bans weren't viceroys in the <b>sense</b> <b>they</b> were appointed by the king. Sometimes their title is translated as duke.|$|E
25|$|A long {{standing}} assumption about Nietzsche {{is that he}} preferred master over slave morality. However, the Nietzsche scholar Walter Kaufmann rejected this interpretation, writing that Nietzsche's analyses of {{these two types of}} morality were only used in a descriptive and historic <b>sense,</b> <b>they</b> were not meant for any kind of acceptance or glorifications.|$|E

Twins are not a random sample of the population, and they differ in their developmental environment. In this <b>sense</b> <b>they</b> are not representative.|$|E
25|$|Free ISPs are Internet service {{providers}} that provide service free of charge. Many free ISPs display advertisements while the user is connected; like commercial television, in a <b>sense</b> <b>they</b> are selling the user's {{attention to the}} advertiser. Other free ISPs, sometimes called freenets, are run on a nonprofit basis, usually with volunteer staff.|$|E
25|$|Early {{organised}} {{political movements}} in Malaysia were organised along regional {{and ethnic groups}} and were not political parties in the modern <b>sense.</b> <b>They</b> generally were loose alliances of interest groups and individuals primarily concerned with social welfare, social progress and religious reform among the Muslim Malay communities similar to interest groups and civil society organisations of today.|$|E
25|$|A posteriori {{concepts}} have <b>sense</b> when <b>they</b> {{are derived}} from a mental image {{that is based on}} experienced sense impressions. Kant's a priori concepts, on the other hand, are alleged to have <b>sense</b> when <b>they</b> {{are derived from}} a nonexperienced mental schema, trace, outline, sketch, monogram, or minimal image. This is similar to a Euclidean geometrical diagram.|$|R

50|$|The term tegmen {{refers to}} a {{miscellaneous}} and arbitrary group of organs in various orders of insects; they certainly are homologous in the <b>sense</b> that <b>they</b> all are derived from insect forewings, but in other <b>senses</b> <b>they</b> are analogous; for example, the evolutionary development of the short elytra of the Dermaptera shared none {{of the history of}} the development of tegmina in the Orthoptera, say. Also, in some other insects fore- and hindwings differ both in texture and their role in flight, but are not universally regarded as tegmina. For example, the hemelytra of some Hemiptera have been called tegmina by some authorities, but not by most modern authors.|$|R
25|$|The {{settlements}} {{were established}} without official sanction of the English Crown; each was an independent political entity. They naturally were presumptively English but, {{in a legal}} <b>sense,</b> <b>they</b> were only secessionist outposts of Massachusetts Bay or expansions from Plymouth Colony. In 1662, Winthrop traveled to England and obtained a charter from Charles II which united the settlements of Connecticut.|$|E
25|$|The Janamsākhīs (literally birth stories), are {{writings}} which {{profess to}} be biographies of Nanak. Although not scripture in the strictest <b>sense,</b> <b>they</b> provide a hagiographic look at Nanak's {{life and the}} early start of Sikhism. There are several—often contradictory and sometimes unreliable—Janamsākhīs {{and they are not}} held in the same regard as other sources of scriptural knowledge.|$|E
25|$|Great-grandson Archibald Cox {{served as}} a U.S. Solicitor General and special {{prosecutor}} during President Richard Nixon's Watergate scandal, whereas Evarts defended a U.S. President (Andrew Johnson) in his impeachment trial. In a <b>sense,</b> <b>they</b> both successfully argued their cases, which represent {{two of the three}} U.S. Presidential impeachment efforts. An impeachment trial was not held in Nixon's case: Nixon resigned before the House of Representatives acted on the House Judiciary Committee's recommendation that Nixon be impeached.|$|E

25|$|Annuities {{provide a}} stream of {{payments}} and are generally classified as insurance because they are issued by insurance companies, are regulated as insurance, and require {{the same kinds of}} actuarial and investment management expertise that life insurance requires. Annuities and pensions that pay a benefit for life are sometimes regarded as insurance against the possibility that a retiree will outlive his or her financial resources. In that <b>sense,</b> <b>they</b> are the complement of life insurance and, from an underwriting perspective, are the mirror image of life insurance.|$|E
25|$|Segregation affects {{people from}} all social classes. For example, a survey {{conducted}} in 2000 found that middle-income, suburban Blacks live in neighborhoods with many more whites than do poor, inner-city blacks. But their neighborhoods {{are not the same}} as those of whites having the same socioeconomic characteristics; and, in particular, middle-class blacks tend to live with white neighbors who are less affluent than they are. While, in a significant <b>sense,</b> <b>they</b> are less segregated than poor blacks, race still powerfully shapes their residential options.|$|E
25|$|Increased {{temperatures}} {{also appear}} to affect EcM communities, though the results cover a range of responses. Some {{studies have shown that}} respiration is reduced in certain species in response to warming, whereas others demonstrated increased total colonization of host plants. Similarly, it appears that only some EcM species are affected by drought, as there are studies yielding results across the spectrum. However, many species provide protection against root desiccation and improve water uptake ability of the roots. In this <b>sense,</b> <b>they</b> provide a general benefit to plants during times of drought (though they may themselves may be affected over time).|$|E
