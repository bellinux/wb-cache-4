An input {{instance of the}} periodic CSP is a finite set of &quot;generating &quot; constraints over a <b>structured</b> <b>variable</b> set that implicitly specifies a larger, possibly infinite set of constraints; the problem is {{to decide whether or}} not the larger set of constraints has a satisfying assignment. This model is natural for studying constraint networks consisting of constraints obeying a high degree of regularity or symmetry. Our main contribution is the identification of two broad polynomial-time tractable subclasses of the periodic CSP. 1 Introduction The constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) is a general framework in which manycombinatorial search problems can be expressed. An instance of a CSP consists of a network of constraints over a set of variables; the problem is to decide whetheror not there is an assignment to the variable set satisfying all of the constraints. Periodic constraint satisfaction problems. This paper investigates a strict gen-eralization of the CSP, the periodic constraint satisfaction problem. In this generalization, the full constraint network- of which satisfiability is to be decided- is specified implicitly.

40|$|We {{studied the}} {{controls}} on functional surface cover types in four catchments along a semi-arid to arid precipitation gradient {{in the northern}} Negev Desert of Israel. First, we selected four functional types, based on their unique water use and redistribution functionality: shrubs, Asphodelus ramosus, other herbaceous plants and surface crusts. We estimated percentage of surface covered by these functional types and by bedrock outcrops and loose surface stones. Additionally data was collected on soil depth, relative elevation, insolation, slope, curvature, and overlain with surface cover maps. Relations between functional types and landscape <b>structure</b> <b>variables</b> were analyzed with descriptive statistics. The landscape <b>structure</b> <b>variables</b> bedrock, relative elevation, soil depth and surface stones explained most of the cover variance in the catchments. In catchments with many bedrock outcrops, functional types were best explained by the landscape <b>structure</b> <b>variables.</b> In catchments with homogeneous soils reaching beyond the root zone, the biological interactions between functional types were more important. Along the precipitation gradient the explanatory power of the biological variables decreased with decreasing precipitation, while the explanatory power of landscape <b>structure</b> <b>variables</b> appeared unrelated.

40|$|We {{describe}} a knowledge representation and inference formalism, {{based on an}} intensional propositional semantic network, in which variables are structured terms consisting of quanti-er, type, and other information. This has three important consequences for natural language processing. First, this leads to an extended, more " formalism whose use and rep-resentations {{are consistent with the}} use of variables in natural language in two ways: the structure of representations mirrors the structure of the language and allows re-use phenom-ena such as pronouns and ellipsis. Second, the formalism allows the specication of description subsumption as a partial ordering on related concepts (variable nodes in a semantic network) that relates more general concepts to more specic instances of that concept, as is done in language. Finally, this <b>structured</b> <b>variable</b> representation simplies the resolution of some rep-resentational diculties with certain classes of natural language sentences, namely, donkey sentences and sentences involving branching quantiers. The implementation of this formal-ism is called ANALOG (A NAtural Logic) and its utility for natural language processing tasks is illustrated. ...|$|E

40|$|A Bayesian {{approach}} to variable selection {{which is based}} on the expected Kullback-Leibler divergence between the full model and its projection onto a submodel has recently been suggested in the literature. For generalized linear models an extension of this idea is proposed by considering projections onto subspaces defined via some form of L 1 constraint on the parameter in the full model. This leads to Bayesian model selection approaches related to the lasso. In the posterior distribution of the projection there is positive probability that some components are exactly zero and the posterior distribution on the model space induced by the projection allows exploration of model uncertainty. Use of the approach in <b>structured</b> <b>variable</b> selection problems such as ANOVA models is also considered, where it is desired to incorporate main effects in the presence of interactions. Projections related to the non-negative garotte are able to respect the hierarchical constraints. A consistency result is given concerning the posterior distribution on the model induced by the projection, showing that for some projections related to the adaptive lasso and non-negative garotte the posterior distribution concentrates on the true model asymptotically.

However, the abnormal turnover of employee will not only waste the human capital investment of enterprise, but also make against {{the implementation of the}} enterprise strategy and the construction of the culture. Based on the Price-Mueller (2000) model, this article adopts the definitions of the control variable, the <b>structured</b> <b>variable,</b> and the environment variable about employee turnover tendency, and creatively introduces the “employee psychological empowerment” as the Moderating variable to design and survey the questionnaire, and uses SPSS to regress in a stepwise way. The test result of the structure model by the empirical research shows that the fair allocation, the promotion opportunity, the monotonous work, the social internal support, and the exterior work chance are main factors to influence the employee turnover tendency, and the employee psychological empowerment could adjust enterprise employees’ turnover tendency. Finally, this article suggests that enterprises should harmonize the relationship between the leader’s authorization behavior and the employee’s psychological empowerment to create healthy enterprise culture and promote effective talent encouragement. </p...|$|E

A significant determinant of new food product introductions is the concentration ratio which affects the number of innovations in a nonlinear form. The fixed-effects estimates reveal a U-type effect of concentration on innovations. Furthermore, the number of firms, the degree of existing product differentiation and the size of a market show a positive influence on the number of innovations. From a methodological point of view, plain OLS models yield biased results on the concentration-innovation linkage and on the relationship between the size of a market and innovations.
