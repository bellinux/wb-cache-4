25|$|Before {{the five}} {{required}} daily prayers, a muezzin calls the worshippers to prayer from the minaret. In many countries like Singapore where Muslims {{are not the}} majority, mosques are prohibited from loudly broadcasting the call to prayer (adhan), although {{it is supposed to}} be <b>said</b> <b>loudly</b> to the surrounding community. The adhan is required before every prayer. However, nearly every mosque assigns a muezzin for each prayer to say the adhan as it is a recommended practice or sunnah of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. At mosques that do not have minarets, the adhan is called instead from inside the mosque or somewhere else on the ground. The iqama, which is similar to the adhan and said immediately before the start of prayer, is usually not said from the minaret even if a mosque has one.|$|E
500|$|For much of {{his final}} two decades, Romney {{had been out of}} the {{political}} eye, but he re-emerged to the general public when he campaigned for his son, Mitt Romney, during the younger Romney's bid to unseat Senator Edward M. Kennedy in the 1994 U.S. Senate election in Massachusetts. [...] Romney had urged Mitt to enter the race and moved into his son's house for its duration, serving as an unofficial advisor. [...] Romney was a vigorous surrogate for his son in public appearances and at fundraising events. [...] When Kennedy's campaign sought to bring up the LDS Church's past policy on blacks, Romney interrupted Mitt's press conference and <b>said</b> <b>loudly,</b> [...] "I think it is absolutely wrong to keep hammering on the religious issues. And what Ted is trying to do is bring it into the picture." [...] The father counseled the son to be relaxed in appearance and to pay less attention to his political consultants and more to his own instincts, a change that the younger Romney made late in the ultimately unsuccessful campaign.|$|E
2500|$|I began again, but I had {{not played}} {{more than a}} few {{measures}} when Rubinstein <b>said</b> <b>loudly,</b> [...] "Have you begun?" [...] "Yes, Master, I certainly have." [...] "Oh," [...] said Rubinstein vaguely, [...] "I didn't notice." [...] Rubinstein did not so much instruct me. [...] Merely he let me learn from him ... If a student, by his own study and mental force, reached the desired point which the musician's wizardry had made him see, he gained reliance in his own strength, knowing he would always find that point again even though he should lose his way once or twice, as everyone with an honest aspiration is liable to do.|$|E
6000|$|... "Sluther up now," [...] <b>said</b> Brangwen <b>loudly</b> {{after this}} silence had {{resolved}} itself out; and Tilly disappeared through the inner door.|$|R

6000|$|... "No," [...] <b>said</b> Roger <b>loudly</b> and explosively. [...] "Don't talk {{any more}} about that damned ghost. Nobody ever saw it. The whole story is balderdash." ...|$|R
6000|$|By {{this time}} Mr. Hillman {{had arrived at}} the scene of the {{threatened}} trouble, and he <b>said,</b> <b>loudly,</b> so that all might hear him: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Caswall," [...] she <b>said</b> <b>loudly,</b> {{so as to}} {{make sure}} of being heard through the blustering of the wind and the {{perpetual}} cracking of the electricity.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes. I do," [...] {{the doctor}} <b>said,</b> <b>loudly,</b> without hesitation. [...] "He must come forward now. He must," [...] he {{added in a}} mutter, which Nostromo did not catch.|$|E
6000|$|... "This visitor," [...] he <b>said</b> {{speaking}} <b>loudly</b> and clearly, [...] "who {{called the}} night before last at the Veterans' Club and had {{an interview with the}} deceased, you saw him well, of course?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I {{go in for}} {{squaring}} up {{with old}} Haskers," [...] he <b>said,</b> rather <b>loudly.</b> [...] "He's about as mean----" [...] And then he stopped short, as {{the door swung open}} and the second assistant appeared.|$|R
60|$|Yes, {{her lips}} <b>said</b> more <b>loudly,</b> Mr Dollard. He sang that song lovely, murmured Mina. Mr Dollard. And The last rose of summer {{was a lovely}} song. Mina loved that song. Tankard loved the song that Mina.|$|R
6000|$|... "Tell old Paulding he {{may go to}} the devil," [...] he <b>said,</b> <b>loudly</b> and clearly, {{and turned}} {{and walked out of}} the office with a firm and lively step.|$|E
6000|$|... "I suppose," [...] he <b>said</b> <b>loudly,</b> after {{watching}} the boy for some time, [...] "I s’pose the men threw theirs overboard becos they hadn’t been used to such good food?" ...|$|E
6000|$|It {{was as if}} an {{insulting}} blow {{had brought}} back the spirit of resistance into Adam. The blood rushed to his face, and he <b>said,</b> <b>loudly</b> and sharply, [...] "For what?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, then, every {{fellow who}} will {{promise not to}} take part in the necktie rush Monday will be allowed to go free," [...] <b>said</b> Dick <b>loudly.</b> [...] "The others must take their ducking in the water--and mud." ...|$|R

5000|$|... "That was our {{standing}} joke," [...] Tarver <b>said,</b> laughing <b>loudly.</b> [...] "I {{told him that}} my family {{had been in the}} business for 105 years, and we ain't buried a white man yet. We'd joke about that all the time." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There is {{news that}} the French and Indians intend to attack this post," [...] he <b>said</b> <b>loudly.</b> [...] "Will you help me to save what is my own, or must I surrender?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Twelve {{pounds in}} this lot," [...] he <b>said</b> <b>loudly,</b> then {{lowering}} his voice: [...] "Those fellows outside haven't gone and I don't {{want them to}} hear. You haven't found your horses yet?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mynheer!" [...] he <b>said</b> <b>loudly,</b> [...] "you {{have lost}} your {{daughter}}. Here am I to do you service, and by God I swear that I will bring your daughter safely back to you." ...|$|E
6000|$|His voice {{stopped for}} {{ten or twelve}} breaths, and then he began mumbling a prayer of some kind in Greek. The native woman cried very bitterly. Lastly, he rose in bed and <b>said,</b> as <b>loudly</b> as slowly--"Not guilty, my Lord!" ...|$|R
6000|$|Caspar Goodwood frowned a little, but he {{expressed}} no embarrassment at {{the sense of}} not looking eager. His face {{was that of a}} much older man than our earlier friend. [...] "I'm sure it's something I shan't like," [...] he <b>said</b> rather <b>loudly.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... 'It's of no importance--really, I assure you--it doesn't {{matter in}} the least,' <b>said</b> Gudrun <b>loudly,</b> with emphasis, her face flushed scarlet. And {{she held out her}} hand impatiently for the wet book, to have done with the scene. Gerald gave it to her. He was not quite himself.|$|R
6000|$|... 'And how're {{you going}} on, lad?' he <b>said</b> <b>loudly.</b> Berry {{noticed that his}} uncle was {{slightly}} uneasy of him. It made him also uncomfortable. The elder man had evidently something pressing on his soul.|$|E
6000|$|... "This is {{an error}} on Monsieur le Chambellan's part," [...] she <b>said</b> <b>loudly,</b> so that {{everyone}} in the vast audience-chamber might hear. [...] "There is no one here to present this lady to Her Majesty!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Will {{you come}} out and speak to me?" [...] he <b>said,</b> <b>loudly.</b> [...] "Not you. The lady," [...] he added in an {{authoritative}} tone as d'Alcacer rose hastily from the stool. [...] "I want Mrs. Travers." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Here, stop that," [...] said Jaffers, {{suddenly}} realising {{what was}} happening. He gripped at the waistcoat; it struggled, and the shirt {{slipped out of}} it and left it limp and empty in his hand. [...] "Hold him!" [...] <b>said</b> Jaffers, <b>loudly.</b> [...] "Once he gets the things off--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Aunt Emma, [...] "I am {{sure she}} will always {{remember}} {{that she is a}} Winslow, and must carry on the family traditions, but sometimes I am afraid she gets under bad influences, because of her good nature." [...] She <b>said</b> it <b>loudly.</b> She looked Carl in the eye.|$|R
6000|$|... "Of {{course they}} are a timid crowd," [...] <b>said</b> Nick Jasniff, <b>loudly.</b> [...] "If they had any sand they wouldn't say {{anything}} about it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Will {{you please}} let me pass?" [...] she <b>said</b> <b>loudly,</b> as a dishevelled Amazon stood before her with arms akimbo, glancing sarcastically at the lace petticoat, which just peeped beneath the young girl's simple grey frock.|$|E
6000|$|... "One o' {{the worst}} chaps about here, my dear," [...] he <b>said,</b> <b>loudly.</b> [...] "Mate o' one o' the fishing-boats, and as impudent {{as they make}} 'em. Many's the time I've clouted his head for 'im." ...|$|E

60|$|He came {{round to}} the opening, stooped, and looked in. 'It {{is obvious that}} you cannot,' he said, taking in her compass at a glance; and adding to himself; 'Charming! {{who would have thought}} that clothes could do so much!--Wait a minute, my little maid: I have it!' he <b>said</b> more <b>loudly.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't care," [...] <b>said</b> Lionel <b>loudly</b> and vehemently; [...] "I {{know that}} you all {{ought to be ashamed}} of yourselves, every one of you. Why, if you were boys you would never hold up your heads again; but girls can do anything, and that is the reason they have no shame." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The Bakery's closed, y'reince!" [...] the Chancellor <b>said,</b> more <b>loudly</b> {{and clearly}} {{than he had}} spoken yet. He was emboldened by the {{consciousness}} that here, at least, he had evidence to produce: and he placed in the Warden's hands a few printed notices, that were lying ready, with some open ledgers, on a side-table.|$|R
