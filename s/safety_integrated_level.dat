40|$|International audienceThe rail {{transportation}} industry is highly dynamic and {{driven by the}} need to meet with mandatory safety criteria. Modern railway transportation systems are ever more sophisticated and rely heavily on embedded systems and communication networks. Train builders and their suppliers have to develop and deliver these increasingly sophisticated embedded systems while meeting increasingly stringent quality, safety and certification constraints. Driven by the EN- 50128 standard 'Software For Railway Control And Protection Systems' [3], which proposes needed methods to be used in order to provide software for control systems, train builders have applied processes and adopted tools that help to develop and validate software in compliance with safety constraints. This paper will illustrate how model based system engineering approaches and frameworks provide full business process support to: - Validate the functional requirements of the systems (requirement management); - Design control and safety functions at the train, vehicle and equipment levels (functional design and software architecture); - Design and develop the software applications of electronic controllers;- Integrate, validate and qualify electronic systems in a progressive integration process;- Manage all changes during the lifecycle of the product (change management but also option and variant management); - Demonstrate the compliance with the required <b>safety</b> <b>integrated</b> <b>level,</b> - Train and educate drivers, rail network operators and maintenance technicians. Train Control Engineers are facing increased certification constraints since the new 2011 version of the EN 50128 standard. The demonstration of the compliance of the software with the related safety rules and criteria (development process, coding rules, defensive code, unitary tests …) costs more and more. This paper will illustrate a model based system engineering approach for the design and the validation of the Control & Monitoring Systems (successfully used on today’s most advanced train OEMs) and propose a new way for the delivery of certified software that comply with the SSIL 2 (Software <b>Safety</b> <b>Integrated</b> <b>Level)</b> defined by the EN- 50128 standard...|$|E

The method used {{was to make a}} correspondence between the SA 8000 standard requirements and the BSCI Code of conduct requirements because the requirements of the BSCI Code of conduct are more detailed in some areas than the requirements of SA 8000 standard which establish the social requirements of the quality-social accountability-health and <b>safety</b> <b>integrated</b> management system. It was established on this way the detailed suplimentary requirements from the BSCI code of conduct which have {{to be added to the}} requirements of SA 8000 standard to reach the full compliance with the social requirements of the BSCI Code of conduct.

40|$|In {{the article}} the {{analysis}} of the frequency, traumatism and mortality of road accidents has been carried out at the regional level for the countries of Central and Eastern Europe and has made it possible to draw conclusions regarding certain spatial features of the distribution of these indicators and on the nonrandom nature of the location of their values on maps of the CEE regions featured in the study. On the basis of methods of spatial statistics and econometrics we have demonstrated the existence of a spatial structure in the distribution of the risks and consequences of road accidents in the various regions. Cluster analysis has enabled us to distinguish uniform clusters of regions categorised by the risks, traumatism and mortality rates of road accidents. Based on an analysis of these indicators we have introduced the evaluation of an <b>integrated</b> <b>safety</b> <b>level</b> for regions of the countries of Central and Eastern Europe. This allows us to estimate the complex influence of the risks and their consequences road accidents on the level of safety for certain regions or groups of regions. The results of the research which has been conducted can be used for the improvement of national and regional programs of road and transport safety, and for the development of strategies and actions aimed at reducing the risks and consequences of road accidents in certain regions...|$|R
40|$|International audienceSafety {{analysis}} in guided transportation systems {{is essential to}} avoid rare but potentially catastrophic accidents. This article presents a quantitative probabilistic model that <b>integrates</b> <b>Safety</b> Integrity <b>Levels</b> (SIL) for evaluating the safety of such systems. The standardized SIL indicator allows the safety requirements of each safety subsystem, function and/or piece of equipment to be specified, making SILs pivotal parameters in safety evaluation. However, different interpretations of SIL exist, and faced with the complexity of guided transportation systems, the current SIL allocation methods are inadequate for the task of safety assessment. To remedy these problems, the model developed in this paper seeks to verify, during the design phase of guided transportation system, {{whether or not the}} safety specifications established by the transport authorities allow the overall safety target to be attained (i. e., if the SIL allocated to the different safety functions are sufficient to ensure the required level of safety). To meet this objective, the model is based both on the operating situation concept and on Monte Carlo simulation. The former allows safety systems to be formalized and their dynamics to be analyzed in order to show the evolution of the system in time and space, and the latter make it possible to perform probabilistic calculations based on the scenario structure obtained...|$|R

The method used was tosupplement the social requirement of SA 8000 : 2008 standard with the additional requirements of BSCI and SEDEX. The results are based on a correspondence between the requirements of SA 8000 : 2008 standard and therequirements of BSCI and SEDEX codes of conducts, because some of BSCI and SEDEX requirements are moredetailed than SA 8000 : 2008 standard requirements which are the base for the implementation of socialrequirements of the quality-social accountability-health and <b>safety</b> <b>integrated</b> management system. A check list waselaborated with the integrated social requirements of SA 8000 : 2008, BSCI and SEDEX.

25|$|Levels of {{estradiol}} in premenopausal {{women are}} highly variable throughout the menstrual cycle and reference ranges widely vary from source to source. Estradiol levels are minimal {{and according to}} most laboratories range from 20 to 80pg/mL during the early to mid follicular phase (or {{the first week of}} the menstrual cycle, also known as menses). Levels of estradiol gradually increase during this time and through the mid to late follicular phase (or the second week of the menstrual cycle) until the pre-ovulatory phase. At the time of pre-ovulation (a period of about 24 to 48hours), estradiol levels briefly surge and reach their highest concentrations of any other time during the menstrual cycle. Circulating levels are typically between 130 and 200pg/mL at this time, but in some women may be as high as 300 to 400pg/mL, and the upper limit of the reference range of some laboratories are even greater (for instance, 750pg/mL). Following ovulation (or mid-cycle) and during the latter half of the menstrual cycle or the luteal phase, estradiol levels plateau and fluctuate between around 100 and 150pg/mL during the early and mid luteal phase, and at the time of the late luteal phase, or a few days before menstruation, reach a low of around 40pg/mL. The mean <b>integrated</b> <b>levels</b> of estradiol during a full menstrual cycle have variously been reported by different sources as 80, 120, and 150pg/mL. Although contradictory reports exist, one study found mean <b>integrated</b> estradiol <b>levels</b> of 150pg/mL in younger women whereas mean <b>integrated</b> <b>levels</b> ranged from 50 to 120pg/mL in older women.|$|R
