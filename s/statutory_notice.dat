2500|$|Upon {{issuance}} of the <b>statutory</b> <b>notice</b> of deficiency (after IRS {{determination of the}} tax amount, but before the formal IRS assessment of the tax), the taxpayer generally has 90 days to file a Tax Court petition for [...] "redetermination of the deficiency". If no petition is timely filed, the IRS may then statutorily [...] "assess" [...] the tax. To [...] "assess" [...] the tax in this sense means to administratively and formally record the tax on the books of the United States Department of the Treasury. This formal statutory assessment is a critical act, as the statutory tax lien that later arises is effective retroactively to {{the date of the}} assessment, and encumbers all property and rights to property of the taxpayer.|$|E
2500|$|Special {{provisions}} {{are made in}} some states for determining the priority between a mechanic's lien and the lien of a mortgage that is financing the construction on the land. [...] For instance, in the State of New York, the appearance of specified language in the mortgage {{to the effect that}} it is a construction loan preserves its priority over mechanic's liens arising out of the construction, as long as subsequently filed lien claims that are legitimate are not ignored. [...] In other states, such as Florida, it is an all or nothing proposition. [...] There, the recording of the construction mortgage before the filing of a <b>statutory</b> <b>notice</b> of commencement of construction provides the mortgage with absolute priority over mechanic's liens arising out of the construction. [...] Still other states, such as California, provide priority for a construction loan mortgage recorded before the visible commencement of construction where the lender is obligated to disburse the funds. [...] In the State of Illinois, there is a statutory funds disbursing scheme that, if followed, provides construction loan mortgage priority. [...] In other states, there are still other arrangements and some states, such as Colorado, provide almost no practical means for a construction loan mortgage to obtain priority at all.|$|E
2500|$|First, if a Directive's {{deadline}} for implementation is not met, the member state cannot enforce conflicting laws, and a citizen may {{rely on the}} Directive in such an action (so called [...] "vertical" [...] direct effect). So, in Pubblico Ministero v Ratti because the Italian government had failed to implement a Directive 73/173/EEC on packaging and labelling solvents by the deadline, it was estopped from enforcing a conflicting national law from 1963 against Mr Ratti's solvent and varnish business. A member state could [...] "not rely, as against individuals, on its own failure to perform the obligations which the Directive entails". Second, a citizen or company can also invoke a Directive as a defence in a dispute with another citizen or company (not just a public authority) which is attempting to enforce a national law that conflicts with a Directive. So, in CIA Security v Signalson and Securitel the Court of Justice held that a business called CIA Security could defend itself from allegations by competitors {{that it had not}} complied with a Belgian decree from 1991 about alarm systems, on the basis that it had not been notified to the Commission as a Directive required. Third, if a Directive gives expression to a [...] "general principle" [...] of EU law, it can be invoked between private non-state parties before its {{deadline for}} implementation. This follows from Kücükdeveci v Swedex GmbH & Co KG where the German Civil Code §622 stated that the years people worked under the age of 25 would not count towards the increasing <b>statutory</b> <b>notice</b> before dismissal. Ms Kücükdeveci worked for 10 years, from age 18 to 28, for Swedex GmbH & Co KG before her dismissal. She claimed that the law not counting her years under age 25 was unlawful age discrimination under the Employment Equality Framework Directive. The Court of Justice held that the Directive could be relied on by her because equality was also a general principle of EU law. Fourth, if the defendant is an emanation of the state, even if not central government, it can still be bound by Directives. In Foster v British Gas plc the Court of Justice held that Mrs Foster was entitled to bring a sex discrimination claim against her employer, British Gas plc, which made women retire at age 60 and men at 65, if (1) pursuant to a state measure, (2) it provided a public service, and (3) had special powers. This could also be true if the enterprise is privatised, as it was held with a water company that was responsible for basic water provision.|$|E

50|$|There {{were two}} primary schools in Bayston Hill both with {{excellent}} reputations and good teaching standards. They were Longmeadow and Oakland Primary Schools.

40|$|Suretyship {{is one of}} the {{performance}} risk management measures used in modern construction contracts. Construction contracts, such as the FIDIC, JBCC Series 2000 and GCC 2004, offer pro forma deeds of suretyship and guarantee forms, but consultants sometimes use in-house contract documentation, which may lead to poor interpretation and application. Suretyship requirements are often the cause of time delays on Rapid Delivery Public Sector Construction Projects (RDPSCP), whether pro forma or in-house deeds or forms are used. Project start dates are generally set within weeks after the contract has been awarded, which time period may be inadequate for some contractors (more specifically emerging contractors) to provide a surety to the approval of the client. In the event of non-performance by the original contractor another contractor must be appointed to complete the works. This process results in loss of time attributable to time frames required for issuing contractual / <b>statutory</b> <b>notices</b> to the original contractor, and delay in appointing a second contractor. Most general conditions of contract have been designed from a commercial and legal perspective, which ignore the negative practical implications of construction suretyship on progress on site. Consultants, therefore, are compelled by necessity to draft special conditions to suit RDPSCP, otherwise delays and disputes are inevitable. It is recommended hereafter that, instead of sureties, guarantees be used as securities, which should be {{in the form of a}} 'demand guarantee'. No construction time will be lost in calling up this type of construction guarantee (Forsyth & Pretorius 2002 : 26) as the guarantor unconditionally and irrevocably undertakes to pay the amount of guarantee on demand and without proof of any breach of contract by the contractor...|$|R

On 1 June 2002 an explosion occurred at the plant and 20,000 liters of pollutant escaped into local waterways. The government's Environment Agency said: [...] "On 3 June an Agency officer visited the site and saw that the outfall from Sonae's premises was gushing a milky white liquid. Kirkby Brook was discolored white for about two kilometers downstream, and still affected for at least a further two kilometers. Samples taken by the Agency revealed that the water in the brook was polluted to almost three times the strength of raw sewage. An ecology survey taken two days later showed that for at least 200 meters downstream, all life in the brook had been completely wiped out, and even as far as two and a half kilometers away the brook was classified as 'grossly polluted.'" [...] In 2003 the Environment Agency prosecuted the firm over five pollution incidents affecting local waterways resulting in fines totaling £37,500. The HSE closed the plant on eight occasions between 2001 and 2003. Residents living near the plant have [...] "repeatedly called for its closure following a series of chemical leaks and fires."
