5|$|According {{to another}} legend, two Parmars from Malwa, named Govinddas and Madhavdas, took up their haunt among the rush grass {{that covered the}} {{neighbourhood}} of the Rudra Mahalaya, and lived by plunder.

5|$|Several {{observers}} (including Plait and Tyson) <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{scene in}} which Kowalski unclips his tether and floats away to his death to save Stone from being {{pulled away from the}} ISS, Stone would simply need to tug the tether gently to pull Kowalski toward her. According to the film's science adviser Kevin Grazier and NASA engineer Robert Frost, however, the pair are still decelerating with Stone's leg caught in the parachute cords from the Soyuz. The cords stretch as they absorb her kinetic energy. Kowalski thinks that the cords are not strong enough to absorb his kinetic energy as well as hers, and that he must release the tether to give Stone a chance of stopping before the cords fail and doom both of them.|$|E

25|$|Shostakovich {{returned}} to the traditional four-movement form and a normal-sized orchestra. More tellingly, he organized each movement along clear lines, having concluded that a symphony cannot be a viable work without firm architecture. The harmonic idiom in the Fifth is less astringent, more tonal than previously, and the thematic material is more accessible. Nevertheless, every bar bears its composer's personal imprint. It has been <b>said</b> <b>that,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Fifth Symphony, the best qualities of Shostakovich's music, such as meditation, humor and grandeur, blend in perfect balance and self-fulfillment.|$|E
25|$|As {{governor}} of Massachusetts {{and as a}} candidate for president, Romney has called for tying raises <b>in</b> <b>the</b> national minimum wage to indicators of growth <b>in</b> <b>the</b> economy, such as increases <b>in</b> <b>the</b> inflation rate.

Commenting in March 2012 on a proposal put forward by some Democratic legislators to raise the minimum wage from $7.25 to $10 per hour, Romney <b>said</b> <b>that</b> an increase <b>in</b> <b>the</b> minimum wage was probably not necessary at that time.|$|R
25|$|A Midrash {{taught that}} if people repent, it is {{accounted}} {{as if they had}} gone up to Jerusalem, built the Temple and the altars, and offered all <b>the</b> sacrifices ordained <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Torah.

25|$|Henin {{announced}} her immediate retirement from professional tennis on 14 May 2008, and requested the WTA {{to remove her}} name from the rankings immediately. Her announcement was a surprise because Henin was still ranked world No. 1 and was considered the favorite for the French Open, where {{she would have been}} the three-time defending champion. She said she felt no sadness about her retirement because she believed it was a release from a game she had focused on for twenty years.

25|$|Professor of {{anthropology}} at Trent University Ontario, Canada, Joseph K. So (1980) cited a study by J. T. Steegman (1965) that the so-called cold-adapted Mongoloid face {{has been shown in}} an experiment, using Japanese and European subjects, to not offer greater protection to frostbite. In explaining Mongoloid cold-adaptiveness, So cites the work of W. L. Hylander (1977) where Hylander <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Eskimo (Inuit), for example, the reduction of the brow ridge and flatness of the face is due to internal structural configurations that are cold adapted {{in the sense that they}} produce a large vertical bite force necessary to chew frozen seal meat.|$|E
25|$|In {{his book}} Reinventing Fire (2011), Amory B. Lovins puts forward {{a vision of}} {{networked}} island-able microgrids where energy is generated locally from solar power, wind power, and other resources, and used by super-efficient buildings. When each building, or neighborhood, is generating its own power, with links to other “islands” of power, {{the security of the}} entire network is greatly enhanced. Lovins has <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> face of hundreds of blackouts in 2005, Cuba reorganized its electricity transmission system into networked microgrids and cut the occurrence of blackouts to zero within two years, limiting damage even after two hurricanes. Denmark has performed tests of islanding a region ("cell") to maintain robustness with smaller local assets rather than large centralized ones.|$|E

25|$|At the Committee of Imperial Defence meeting {{after the}} Agadir Crisis the First Sea Lord Admiral Arthur Wilson <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> event of war the Navy planned {{to land the}} Army on the Baltic Coast. Nicholson asked Wilson whether the Admiralty had maps of German {{strategic}} railways (to show how the Germans could rush reinforcements to invasion spots), and when Wilson {{said it was not}} the Admiralty’s business to have such maps, Nicholson openly rebuked him and said that if the Navy “meddled” in military matters they needed not just to have such maps but to have studied them. Prime Minister H.H. Asquith ordered the Navy to fall in with the Army’s plans to deploy an Expeditionary Force to France.|$|E
25|$|Around the {{new year}} 919, Wang, then {{under the command of}} He Gui, participated in a major {{confrontation}} between Later Liang and Jin forces at Huliu Slope (胡柳陂, in modern Heze, Shandong). It was said that it was Wang's initial suffering of some losses that led to a chain reaction that caused massive losses (two thirds) for both armies—when Wang was retreating, part of the Jin army misread Wang's movement as a retreat by their own army, and collapsed, although a subsequent Jin counterattack also inflicted great losses on the Later Liang army. It was <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> aftermaths of the battle, fleeing soldiers from both Wang's army and the Jin army found their way to the Later Liang capital Daliang, causing much panic in the city that the Jin army was approaching, although the panic soon subsided.|$|E
25|$|The {{controversy}} raged {{within the}} navy and in public for about {{a decade after the}} war. Criticism focused on Jellicoe's decision at 19:15. Scheer had ordered his cruisers and destroyers forward in a torpedo attack to cover the turning away of his battleships. Jellicoe chose to turn to the south-east, and so keep out of range of the torpedoes. Supporters of Jellicoe, including the historian Cyril Falls, pointed to the folly of risking defeat in battle when one already has command of the sea. Jellicoe himself, {{in a letter to the}} Admiralty seventeen months before the battle, said that he intended to turn his fleet away from any mass torpedo attack (that being the universally accepted proper tactical response to such attacks, practised by all the major navies of the world). He <b>said</b> <b>that,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> event of a fleet engagement in which the enemy turned away, he would assume they intended to draw him over mines or submarines, and he would decline to be so drawn. The Admiralty approved this plan and expressed full confidence in Jellicoe at the time (October 1914).|$|E
