40|$|The {{focus of}} {{the paper is the}} stone {{fragment}} of a Byzantine architectural element discovered in Belgrade several decades ago. It has served as a basis for reconstructing the original appearance of the element which has been identified as the plinth of a chancel <b>screen</b> <b>column.</b> The plinth, which flanked {{the north side of the}} central templon door, is decorated in low relief on three sides, and has been dated by style to the 11 th century. It presumably formed part of the templon of Belgrade’s cathedral church, of which no remains have survived. Based on analogies, the church might have been a three-aisled basilica, probably located in the urban zone of 11 th- and 12 th-century Byzantine Belgrade. Archaeological excavations indicate that this urban zone was situated within the walls of the former Roman castrum...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} is meant first {{to describe the}} lexicogrammatical system, cohesion, and genre applied in both texts, second is to describe mode analysis covering channel and medium, whether the language of both texts tend to be written or spoken, then medium discusses {{the appropriateness of the}} language being used in the medium of the texts, third to describes whether both texts are different or similar based on the analysis of lexicogrammar, cohesion, genre, and mode analysis in both types of film review text. This thesis uses the descriptive qualitative method and comparative method. The source of data are the text film review in the Jakarta Post entitled ‘Wallace and Gromit’ in the Now Showing and Flick Fact Column published on the 11 th and 18 th of December 2005. The technique of sampling used in this {{research is}} purposive sampling that is taken purposively for having been known the characteristics of the sample. In choosing the sample, this research uses total sampling, which means that all of the data provided from both text are taken to be the sample of this research. The result of this research is the employment of lexicogrammar system in both texts. The lexicogrammar system in the Flick Fact column text has characteristics such as a large number of simplex clause, more indicative, declarative clause functioning as proposition, dominantly employ Topical Unmarked, more simplex nominal and verbal group and more technicality and nominalization. In the term of cohesion system text I employs more repetition, dominant implicit conjunction, and uses new item genre. Meanwhile, the employment of lexicogrammar system in Now Showing column has characteristic such as large number of simplex clauses, more indicative declarative clause functioning as proposition, dominantly employ topical unmarked theme, more simplex nominal and verbal group, more technicality and nominalization in the term of cohesion system text employs the presence external conjunction, and use of review genre. The description of lexicogrammar, cohesion, and genre above gives the result that in constructing a message, the Text I tend to be more written language as their channel. Meanwhile, text II tend be more spoken. In the term of medium, both text are written in the same medium i. e. newspaper. The use of newspaper medium is very effective since the target readers are well-educated people and have good English, considering that the newspaper is written in English. The position of both columns as a part of <b>Screen</b> <b>column</b> in the Jakarta Sunday Edition that is consider as a relax column, the liquid language in this text functions to xv make the text not monotonous, and the use of each genre in both texts and the choice of channel each texts are also support the appropriateness. Furthermore, both text analyses have some similarities and differences. They are similar in many things such as: the use of simplex clause, the employment of simplex nominal and verbal group, the measurement of lexical density, the technicality and nominalization, and the medium. On the other hand, both texts also have some differences like: the type of clause and interdependency, in the cohesion system, the text structure and genre, and the channel. ...|$|E

40|$|Procedures are {{described}} {{for evaluation of}} the thin-layer and gas chromatographic properties of new raw material drug substances over {{a broad spectrum of}} conditions. Chromato-graphic profiles are established for each drug, and these are used as starting points for analytical procedures for the drug, its synthetic precursors, and its degradation products. Thin-layer chromatography is performed initially by use of three adsorbents and a series of six solvents. Gas chromatography is performed initially by temperature programming on a series of six different columns, followed by isothermal experiments. Evaluation of resulting chromatograms from both techniques determines whether more experiments are necessary or whether an analytical method can be developed based directly on one {{of the results of the}} initial screening. qualitative and quantitative analysis is, when properly applied, excellent. With the explosive advances lately in GC applica-tions, a formidable array of stationary phase-solid support combinations has appeared. Very recently however, attempts have been made to limit the variety of stationary phases in popular use to a small workable number (14, 15). Gas chroma-tographic stationary phases may be evaluated by means of their McReynolds constants (16, 17), and for rapid initial screening of a drug it is desirable to cover a wide "polarity" range by use of a small variety. Limitation of the variety of <b>screening</b> <b>column</b> types to a realistic minimum can have the added advantage of the same limitation in subsequent assay method development...|$|R

5000|$|Designed by Robert Adam, it {{has been}} {{described}} as his best classical house in Scotland, the grand manner in miniature. This great neoclassical mansion was demolished in two stages in 1954 and in 1975.The seat of the Marjoribanks family, since 1624 when John Marjoribanks bought the estate, the house was constructed {{at the end of the}} 18th century by Alexander Marjoribanks and situated within a park of 100 acre. [...] One of Adam's final designs, the plans are signed and dated 1792 shortly before his death on 3 March 1792. The house is typical of his neoclassical style, with a central corps de logis, flanking wings and end pavilions. [...] The corps de logis had similarities with another of Adam's great houses, Kedleston Hall, except that at Balbardie Adam used a single small pediment at the centre rather than fully suggesting the Arch of Constantine as he did at Kedleston. Another common Adam feature which is highly defined but in an unusual setting at Balbardie are the recessed apses behind <b>screening</b> <b>columns</b> in the low wings connecting the three bayed pavilions to the corps de logis. This was a feature Adam often used internally but seldom externally. That Adam was not present during the final stages of drawing and completion of the house is evident by the prominence of the chimneys at Kedleston and elsewhere so carefully disguised; the pitch of the roofs suggests a northern Baroque such as the Nymphenburg (where the chimneys are equally visible). However, these features are part of the character of the house and should not be seen as detracting from its architectural importance. The house faced South West over gardens which included an ornamental lake, plantations and a belvedere (a summer house with a fine view).|$|R
