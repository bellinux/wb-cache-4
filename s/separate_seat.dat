25|$|Major gold discoveries at Coolgardie and Kalgoorlie, {{coupled with}} a major {{international}} economic depression, caused immigration from the eastern colonies to accelerate. These migrants included {{a large number of}} footballers including some celebrated players, and the Goldfields competition (later known as the Goldfields Football League) was comparable in status and standard to the Perth competition for many years. (This was shown {{by the fact that it}} had a <b>separate</b> <b>seat</b> on the Australian National Football Council until 1919.) The higher standard of play that naturally followed, helped to increase the game's popularity and increased the professionalism of the WAFA.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of its {{contribution}} to Allied victory in the First World War, Canada became more assertive and less deferential to British authority. Convinced that Canada had proven itself on the battlefields of Europe, Prime Minister Sir Robert Borden demanded that it have a <b>separate</b> <b>seat</b> at the Paris Peace Conference in 1919. This was initially opposed not only by Britain but also by the United States, which saw such a delegation as an extra British vote. Borden responded by pointing out that since Canada had lost nearly 60,000 men, a far larger proportion of its men, its right to equal status as a nation had been consecrated on the battlefield. British Prime Minister David Lloyd George eventually relented, and convinced the reluctant Americans to accept the presence of delegations from Canada, India, Australia, Newfoundland, New Zealand, and South Africa. These also received their own seats in the League of Nations. Canada asked for neither reparations nor mandates. It played only a modest role at Paris, but just having a seat was a matter of pride. It was cautiously optimistic about the new League of Nations, in which it played an active and independent role.|$|E

Arguing that Canada {{had become a}} true nation on the battlefields of Europe, Borden demanded and received a <b>separate</b> <b>seat</b> for Canada at the Paris Peace Conference of 1919. Canada's military and civilian participation in the First World War strengthened a sense of British-Canadian nationhood among the Anglophones (English speakers). The Francophones (French speakers) supported the war at first, but pulled back and stood aloof after 1915 because of language disputes at home. Heroic memories centered around the [...] "Canada's Hundred Days" [...] battles of 1917, especially the Battle of Vimy Ridge where 3,600 died.|$|E

50|$|In the 1953 election, the Minorities {{seat was}} {{allocated}} to the Beirut V - Minet El Hosn electoral district.

50|$|The {{most common}} {{variation}} of the classic farm tractor is the hoe, also called a hoe-loader. As the name implies, it has a loader assembly {{on the front and}} a backhoe on the back. Backhoes attach to a three-point hitch on farm or industrial tractors. Industrial tractors are often heavier in construction, particularly with regards to the use of steel grill for protection from rocks and the use of construction tires. When the backhoe is permanently attached, the machine usually has a seat that can swivel to the rear to face the hoe controls. Removable backhoe attachments almost always have a <b>separate</b> <b>seat</b> on the attachment.|$|E
50|$|The 1953 {{election}} {{was the first}} parliamentary election in Lebanon with a new electoral system which allowed candidates to win with a plurality of votes, rather than requiring a second round. Female universal suffrage was introduced whilst voting was made compulsory for men, as per the November 1952 Election Law. Moreover the number of seats in the parliament was reduced from 77 to 44. Most of the electoral districts now elected only a single parliamentarian, rather than the usual system in Lebanon where several parliamentarians are elected from a larger district. The November 1952 Election Law had also abolished the <b>separate</b> <b>seat</b> for Armenian Catholics.|$|E

50|$|Men {{and women}} are {{generally}} not separated in most Conservative synagogues, although it is a permissible option within Conservative Judaism and some Conservative synagogues, particularly in Canada, have one or have <b>separate</b> <b>seating</b> {{for men and women}} without a physical partition. Conservative Judaism takes the position that the Mechitza referred to in Talmud Tractate Sukkah applied only to the festival of Sukkah in the Temple and that its use to separate men and women for synagogue worship and other occasions represents a custom rather than a requirement of core Jewish law, and is subject to contemporary Rabbinic re-examination. Some Conservative synagogues (e.g. in Europe and Israel) also have a meḥitza or <b>separate</b> <b>seating</b> sections for men and women without a physical partition. At one point the synagogue in the Jewish Theological Seminary did so.|$|R
