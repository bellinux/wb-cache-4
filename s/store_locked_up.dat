50|$|The film follows {{director}} Jeremy Seifert and {{his friends}} as they dumpster dive behind several grocery stores in the Los Angeles area to demonstrate the massive amount of food that is wasted each year in America. After showing {{that much of the}} food found in dumpsters is perfectly edible, Seifert confronts the managers of the stores to question why they don't donate more of it to local food banks, {{especially in light of the}} 1996 Federal Bill Emerson Good Samaritan Food Donation Act, which protects them from liability for such donations. The legality and ethics of dumpster diving are discussed when the <b>stores</b> begin <b>locking</b> <b>up</b> their dumpsters. Finally, Seifert considers the waste created by individual consumers when they throw out food that is only partly bad or just past its expiration date.|$|R

30|$|The main concurrency-control schemes can be {{categorized}} as pessimistic or optimistic. Pessimistic concurrency control, or pessimistic locking, assumes that two or more concurrent users will try to update the same record or object at the same time. To prevent this situation, a lock is placed onto the accessed entity so that exclusive access is guaranteed to a single operation; other clients trying to access the same data must wait until the first one finishes its work. The entity that is locked depends on the underlying data model. For example, key-value <b>stores</b> <b>lock</b> records consisting of key-value pairs, column-family <b>stores</b> <b>lock</b> rows, and document <b>stores</b> enforce <b>locking</b> at document level. In graph databases, specifically in Neo 4 J, locks are acquired on nodes and their relationships. BerkeleyDB and MongoDB implement readers-writer locks which allow either multiple readers to access data or a single writer to modify them. Pessimistic locking techniques can lead to performance degradation, especially in write-intensive scenarios.|$|R
