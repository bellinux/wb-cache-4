50|$|A {{slider-crank}} linkage is a four-bar linkage {{with three}} revolute joints and one prismatic, or sliding, joint. The {{rotation of the}} crank drives the linear movement the slider, or the expansion of gases against a <b>sliding</b> <b>piston</b> in a cylinder can drive {{the rotation of the}} crank.|$|E
50|$|A {{gas spring}} {{is a type}} of spring that, unlike a typical {{mechanical}} spring that relies on elastic deformation, uses compressed gas contained within an enclosed cylinder sealed by a <b>sliding</b> <b>piston</b> to pneumatically store potential energy and withstand external force applied parallel to the direction of the piston shaft.|$|E
50|$|While air based, {{the split}} air vs water {{pressure}} chamber has a sliding plunger {{that separates the}} compressed air from the water. This technology has so far only been seen on the Water Warriors Aqua Master PreCharger Series. A button is used to toggle whether the pump is priming/pre-pressurizing the pressure chamber with air or whether the pump is moving water into the pressure chamber. Akin to pre-pressurizing the Separate Pressure Chamber water guns, the split air / water pressure chamber takes this one step further by preventing the accidental, undesired release of the pre-pressurized air by keeping it separated from the water by a <b>sliding</b> <b>piston</b> divider. After all the water is expelled from the pressure chamber, the <b>sliding</b> <b>piston</b> prevents loss of the pressurized air, thus {{reducing the number of}} times the water gun must be pumped in order to achieve optimal firing pressure.|$|E
50|$|The {{oil pump}} in an {{internal}} combustion engine circulates engine oil under pressure to the rotating bearings, the <b>sliding</b> <b>pistons</b> and the camshaft of the engine.

50|$|A seal must be {{made between}} the <b>sliding</b> <b>piston</b> and {{the walls of the}} {{cylinder}} so that the high pressure gas above the piston does not leak past it and reduce the efficiency of the engine. This seal is usually provided by one or more piston rings. These are rings made of a hard metal, and are sprung into a circular groove in the piston head. The rings fit tightly in the groove and press against the cylinder wall to form a seal.|$|E
50|$|Most small petrol {{two-stroke}} engines {{cannot be}} lubricated by oil contained in their crankcase and sump, since the crankcase {{is being used}} to pump fuel-air mixture into the cylinder. Over a short period of time, the constant stream of fuel-air mixture would carry away the lubricating oil into the combustion chamber while thinning the remainder with condensing petrol. Traditionally, the moving parts (both rotating crankshaft and <b>sliding</b> <b>piston)</b> were instead lubricated by a premixed fuel-oil mixture (at a ratio between 16:1 and 100:1). As late as the 1970s, petrol stations would often have a separate pump to deliver such a premix fuel to motorcycles. Even then, in many cases, the rider would carry a bottle of their own two-stroke oil.|$|E
50|$|The {{key to the}} Grip Pod is {{the button}} {{near the top of}} the grip. This button connects to a {{spring-loaded}} <b>sliding</b> <b>piston</b> in the grip, that sits atop the bi-pod legs. When the button is pressed, the spring is released and decompressed, which pushes the piston down. This action expands the two housed legs out of the grip and into their locked and spread position. The legs are connected to each other by a joint that is fastened by a pin with threading on one end, called a pivot pin. A torsion spring, similar to those used in mousetraps, allows the legs the tension to expand outward, assuming their locked position. A rubber O-ring is in place at the bottom of the grip to catch a ledge at the top of the bi-pod leg mechanism. This prevents the legs from over-extending or leaving the grip completely. The grips are mainly made from reinforced polymer, while the legs are stainless steel covered by polymer. Each Grip Pod is 5.75 inches long with the legs concealed, and 7.25 inches long with the legs deployed. The Grip Pod mounts to a weapon using the Picatinny Rail system.|$|E

5000|$|Horst Leitner {{began working}} {{on the problem of}} chain torque and its effect on {{suspension}} in the mid-1970s with motorcycles. In 1985 Leitner built a prototype mountain bike incorporating what became known later as the [...] "Horst link". The Horst Link is a type of four-bar suspension. Leitner formed a mountain bike and research company, AMP research, that began building full-suspension mountain bikes. In 1990, AMP introduced the Horst link as a feature of a [...] "fully independent linkage" [...] rear suspension for mountain bikes. The AMP B-3 and B-4 XC full-suspension bikes featured optional disc brakes and Horst link rear suspension very similar to the Macpherson strut. Note that the <b>sliding</b> <b>piston</b> in the shock absorber represents the fourth [...] "bar" [...] in this case. A later model, the B-5, was equipped with a revolutionary four-bar front suspension fork, as well as the Horst link in the rear. It featured up to 125 mm (5 inches) of travel on a bicycle weighing around 10.5 kg (23 pounds). For 10 years AMP Research manufactured their full-suspension bikes in small quantities in Laguna Beach, California, including the manufacture of their own hubs, rear shocks, front suspension forks and cable-actuated-hydraulic disc brakes which they pioneered.|$|E
5000|$|The Do 217 usually {{carried a}} crew of four. Included were a pilot, an observer/bomb aimer/forward gunner, dorsal gunner/radio {{operator}} and a flight engineer/ventral gunner. As with the Dornier Do 17, the crew were positioned in the cockpit cabin forward of the engines and leading edge. The pilot sat on the port side, with a spectacle-type control column mounted on a swinging arm centered in the instrument panel. The entire arm could be swung 180deg to starboard, placing the yoke {{in front of the}} bombardier, in case of emergencies. In the later Do 217K with stepless windscreen, the center pivot was mounted on a rocking control arm or pedestal, rather than a <b>sliding</b> <b>piston,</b> since the instrument panel itself was eliminated (replaced with smaller panels holding the gauges, hung {{from the edge of the}} fueslage wall and from the glazing frames above the yoke, respectively.) The bomb aimer sat on his immediate right, slightly below and behind. In combat he could move forward into the nose and operate the bomb release gear or aim the forward machine gun (or 20 mm cannon). On the right side of the nose, the bomb aimer's window penetrates the cockpit and is visible as a bulge on the exterior. Back-to-back with the bombardiers seat, the flight engineer/ventral gunner sat on the port side, his seat facing to the rear. The seat of the ventral gunner/flight engineer was next to the radio operator facing forward, behind the bomb aimer. During operations the ventral gunner/engineer would lie on his stomach facing aft, his post as a gunner taking immediate and first priority.The radio-operator/dorsal gunner sat in a pivoting seat in the extreme rear, above the ventral gun position. His head was inside the B-Stand gun position, and the instruments mounted in a semi-circle around his torso level. The pilot had a curved shield of Armour plating, 8.5 mm thick, placed behind his seat. His seat had a further 5mm ( [...] in) of armour and another 5mm ( [...] in) plate above his head, installed in the top of the cockpit roof. The dorsal gunner was also protected by armour plating.The Funkgerät or FuG radio communication device compartments were located in the extreme rear of the cockpit, near the leading edge. The automatic pilot panel was located next the FuG boxes. In the right-rear of the cockpit the piping that was also attached to the de-icing ducts in wings also entered the cockpit, as part of a single heating system to emit warm air to heat the cabin if needed.The FuG X, 16, navigational direction finder PeilG V direction finder (PeilG - Peilgerät) and the FuG 25 IFF and FuBI 2 blind landing devices were used in the E-2.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{reports on}} the design and {{performance}} of a large diameter diaphragmless shock tube that has been recently developed in order to experimentally study various basic characteristics of the gas-dynamic laser (GDL). The main engineering element of the shock tube is a diaphragm-like <b>sliding</b> <b>piston</b> (in place of a rupturing diaphragm) by which normal shock waves are formed. The role of such a structure in generating repeatable shock waves is discussed. The shock tube performs in good accordance with the simple shock tube theory, as has been verified so far by experiments with some conventional lasing gases (gaseous mixtures of CO 2 and N 2 and those diluted with an excess of He) at shock wave Mach numbers ranging from 1 to 5. Recent results of the stagnation conditions achieved in the shock tube with application to GDL experiments are included as well...|$|E
40|$|International audienceMajor {{challenges}} of micro thermal machines are the thermal insulation and mechanical tolerance {{in the case}} of <b>sliding</b> <b>piston.</b> Replacing piston by membrane in microengines can alleviate the latter and lead to planar architectures. However, the thermal isolation would call for very thick structures which are associated to too high resonant frequencies which are detrimental to the engine performances. A thermal and mechanical compromise is to be made. On the contrary, based on fluid structure interaction, using an incompressible fluid contained in a cavity sealed by deformable diaphragm {{it would be possible to}} design a thick, low frequency insulating diaphragm. The design involves a simple planar geometry that is easy to manufacture with standard microelectronics methods. An analytical fluid-structure model is proposed and theoretically validated. Experimental structures are realized and tested. The model is in agreement with the experimental results. A dimensionless model is proposed to design hybrid fluid structures for micromachines...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{densification}} and microstructure {{changes of}} 2 mol% yttria-stabilized zirconia nanopowder {{have been investigated}} during direct and hybrid microwave sintering.

Constant heating rate runs (25 degrees C/min) were controlled by adjusting {{the position of a}} <b>sliding</b> <b>piston</b> at constant forward microwave power. The temperature on the upper surface of the specimen was measured with an infrared camera. The final densities and the microstructures observed by SEM were compared to those of conventionally sintered materials. Homogeneous microstructures have been obtained by hybrid heating whereas direct microwave heating led to rather heterogeneous microstructures due to thermal gradients. Nevertheless, microwave-sintered materials always exhibited higher final densities for a given sintering temperature. This significant enhancement of the densification process was particularly observed in the intermediate sintering stage (1200 - 1350 degrees C range). Besides, grain growth was found to be mainly influenced by the sintering temperature rather than by the heating mode...|$|E

40|$|Due to the {{increasing}} concern with the acoustic environment within automotive vehicles, there is an interest in measuring the acoustical properties of automotive door seals. These systems {{play an important role}} in blocking external noise sources, such as aerodynamic noise and tire noise, from entering the passenger compartment. Thus, it is important to be able to conveniently measure their acoustic performance. Previous methods of measuring the ability of seals to block sound required the use of either a reverberation chamber, or a wind tunnel with a special purpose chamber attached to it. That is, these methods required the use of large and expensive facilities. A simpler and more economical desktop procedure is thus needed to allow easy and fast acoustic measurement of automotive door seals. In the present work, a desktop, four-microphone, square cross-section standing wave tube was modified by the addition of a new sample holder to make it possible to measure the transmission loss of door seals under various states of compression. In this new procedure, the sample is clamped between a <b>sliding</b> <b>piston</b> and one wall of the standing wave tube. Since the clamp partially blocks the channel, thus impacting the measured transmission loss, a correction is necessary to determine the transmission loss of the seal by itself. Therefore, an initial set of measurements was performed to identify the correction factor required to adjust the measured transmission loss of the clamp plus seal to eliminate the contribution of the clamp itself. Once the accuracy of the correction procedure was verified, a number of typical door seals were tested at various degrees of compression. The transmission losses of the seals were generally in excess of 30 dB, and the transmission loss was found to increase significantly as the seals were compressed. The latter point, in particular, indicates that careful design of the seal mounting arrangements in the vehicle is crucial to ensuring their optimal performance...|$|E
