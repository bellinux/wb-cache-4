40|$|AbstractSupplementary feeding is a common, but controversial, tool in {{wildlife}} management, {{because it}} can benefit both humans and wildlife (e. g., increased wildlife densities), but has certain downsides (e. g., increased disease transmission). For species that are often involved in human-wildlife conflicts, two opposing paradigms with respect to <b>supplementary</b> <b>feeding</b> exist, i. e., (i) that <b>supplementary</b> <b>feeding</b> is efficient to lure animals away from undesired places (i. e., diversionary feeding; hypothesis 1), and (ii) that <b>supplementary</b> <b>feeding</b> stimulates ‘nuisance’ behavior (i. e., increased tolerance for humans and selection for human facilities; hypothesis 2). We formulated an alternative hypothesis (hypothesis 3); i. e., that behavioral variation among individuals dilutes population-wide, general patterns with respect to <b>supplementary</b> <b>feeding.</b> Based on GPS relocation data and resource selection functions, we show that neither of the two opposing management paradigms (hypothesis 1 and 2) hold in a particularly ‘conflict rich’ species, the brown bear (Ursus arctos), because individual variation in selection behavior with respect to <b>supplementary</b> <b>feeding</b> diluted population-wide patterns (hypothesis 3), even under very different environmental contexts (Sweden vs. Slovenia; i. e., different human and bear population density, history and intensity of <b>supplementary</b> <b>feeding,</b> topography, etc.).

CARE and PLAN International in Zimbabwe were the two NGOs used as case studies and their operations in the Lower Gweru district of the Midlands Province Zimbabwe provided the empirical data for this study. This study was principally qualitative in nature as it sought to provide an in-depth analysis of the main challenges that NGOs face when carrying out <b>supplementary</b> <b>feeding</b> programmes {{in the rural areas}} of Zimbabwe. For the purpose of collecting data the study relied on Focus Group Discussions, in-depth interviews with key informants and document study. The key informants included Country Directors, Programme and Field officers at both CARE and PLAN International who had intimate knowledge of some of the challenges that their <b>supplementary</b> <b>feeding</b> programmes faced. Challenges that faced CARE and Plan International’s <b>supplementary</b> <b>feeding</b> programmes were categorized into two themes, internal and external organizational challenges. Internally the study revealed that the NGOs were unable to retain critical personnel such as nutritionists and programme officers. It also emerged from the study that field officers were involved in the thefts of food meant for the <b>supplementary</b> <b>feeding</b> programmes. The management of the <b>supplementary</b> <b>feeding</b> programmes was made difficult by lack of adequate information about the target beneficiaries. Further the study noted that there were contestations {{when it came to the}} selection of the beneficiaries of the programme. It was also found that during the rainy season it was difficult to 8 avail food timeously to the beneficiaries of the <b>supplementary</b> <b>feeding</b> programmes. It emerged from the study that <b>supplementary</b> <b>feeding</b> programmes were victims of political interference as the government and war veterans were suspicious that the programmes were being used to influence the voting behavior of the recipients. The global financial crisis also limited the capacity of the donors to continue availing substantial amounts of money for food procurement.

5000|$|The White Park is a medium-large, long-bodied bovine. A {{program of}} linear assessment, {{including}} 200 bulls and 300 cows, {{has been carried}} out in the UK since 1994 to define its size and conformation. The weight of a mature bull varies from 800 to 1000 kg, depending on the quality of grazing, while adult cows are typically 500 to 700 kg. Their coloration is a distinctive porcelain white with coloured (black or red) points. The horns of the cows can vary in shape, but the majority grow forwards and upwards in a graceful curve. The horns of the bulls are thicker and shorter. In their native environment in Britain, White Park cattle are known for their distinctive appearance and their grazing preference for coarse terrain. White Park cattle are well-suited to non-intensive production. Some herds are kept outside throughout the year on rough upland grazing without shelter or <b>supplementary</b> <b>feed.</b> They are docile, easy-calving, and have a long productive life. Some traits may vary depending on their location.Until recently, White Park cattle were a triple-purpose breed used for meat, milk and draught. The 3rd Lord Dynevor (1765-1852) kept a team of draught oxen, and the practice continued up to 1914. They were used as dairy cattle even more recently. Some cows were being milked in the Dynevor herd in 1951, but yields were moderate. Beef became the main product during the twentieth century, and gained a reputation as a textured meat, with excellent flavor and marbling, which commanded a significant premium in specialty markets. [...] The white park, a breed I’ve never eaten before and had always assumed was purely ornamental, was really excellent: softly chewy, with that strong, distinctive, almost corrupt flavour of proper beef A.A. Gill Several blood typing and DNA studies have revealed the genetic distinctness of White Park cattle. The colour-pointed coat pattern also appears in other cattle breeds such as the Irish Moiled, the , the Berrenda, the Nguni and the Texas Longhorn. The breeds most closely related seem to be the Highland cattle and Galloway cattle of Scotland, but the White Park [...] "is genetically far distant from all British breeds".|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine the effect of two different levels of <b>supplementary</b> <b>feed</b> and two different stocking rates on the production of grazing ostriches. One hundred and seventy ostriches were randomly allocated to four groups and kept on irrigated lucerne pasture with or without <b>supplementary</b> <b>feed</b> from approximately 58 kg to a target weight of 95 kg. The ostriches rotationally grazed lucerne pasture at one of two stocking rates, i. e. 15 birds/ha or 10 birds/ha and were fed one of two levels of supplement i. e. 0 g or 800 g feed/d formulated according to the nutrient requirements of the relevant group of birds. Data were analyzed by ANOVA. There was no interaction between the <b>supplementary</b> <b>feed</b> and stocking rate regarding mean live weight at 54 weeks of age and feed conversion ration (FCR). Data were provided as the two main effects of level of supplementation and stocking rate. Significant differences in mean live weight at 54 weeks of age and FCR of the birds were observed between the different levels of <b>supplementary</b> <b>feed.</b> The parameters measured for the two different stocking rates used in this study (10 birds/ha vs. 15 birds/ha) did not differ from each other and did not influence either mean live weight at 54 weeks of age, average daily gain (ADG) or FCR. The two groups which received 800 g supplementary feed/d reached slaughter weight (95 kg) within the set of 54 weeks of grazing for the trial, while the two groups which received no <b>supplementary</b> <b>feed</b> did not achieve slaughter weight by 54 weeks on the pasture. Ostriches receiving supplementation of 800 g/bird/day had significantly better FCR's than birds receiving no supplementation. There was a significant interaction between level of <b>supplementary</b> <b>feed</b> and stocking rate regarding ADG of the birds. As stocking rate increased, average daily gains of birds receiving no <b>supplementary</b> <b>feed</b> declined.

A long-term management goal of the L. krefftii recovery program has been to determine preferred feed of wombats and to gain acceptance of <b>supplementary</b> <b>feed</b> and water by L. krefftii in order to mitigate the effects of drought and wildfire and potentially increase fecundity and survivorship rates in the population. Prior to this study, there had been several unsuccessful attempts to induce L. krefftii to take <b>supplementary</b> <b>feed</b> and water, but the current study, which was of a longer duration, has shown that L. krefftii will readily take <b>supplementary</b> <b>feed</b> and water. In addition, L. krefftii prefers certain feed types (Complete-O (primarily steam-flaked barley with molasses and lucerne and oaten chaff), and Town and Country pellet mix (primarily wheat, barley and sorghum, with canola and soybean meal)) and will visit sources of feed and water on a nightly basis. Visits by L. krefftii to <b>supplementary</b> <b>feed</b> and water sites were related to the occurrence of rainfall, with visits declining after rain...|$|E
40|$|<b>Supplementary</b> <b>feed</b> {{accounts}} for nearly 40 - 60 per {{cent of the}} total operational cost in intensive farming operations and formulation of balanced feeds with low-cost protein ingredients can bring down the cost of <b>supplementary</b> <b>feed</b> to a great extent.

The marketing, preparation, and cooking are done by the mothers of the children for the <b>supplementary</b> <b>feeding</b> sessions.|$|R
40|$|<b>Supplementary</b> <b>feeding</b> is a {{widespread}} game management practice in several red deer (Cervus elaphus) populations, with important potential consequences on the biology of this species. InMediterranean ecosystems food supplementation occurs in the rutting period, when it may change mating system characteristics. We studied the role of food supplementation relative to natural resources in the spatial distribution, aggregation, and mean harem size of females in Iberian red deer (Cervus elaphus hispanicus) during the rut. We studied 30 red deer populations of southwestern Spain, 63 % of which experienced <b>supplementary</b> <b>feeding.</b> Using multivariate spatial analyses we found that food supplementation affected distribution of females in 95 % of the populations in which it occurred. Green meadows present during the mating season acted as an important natural resource influencing female distribution. Additionally, the level of female aggregation and mean harem size were significantly higher in those populations in which food supplementation determined female distribution than in populations in which female distribution did not depend on <b>supplementary</b> <b>feeding.</b> Because female aggregation and mean harem size are key elements in sexual selection, <b>supplementary</b> <b>feeding</b> may constitute an important anthropogenic element with potential evolutionary implications for populations of Iberian red deer...|$|R
