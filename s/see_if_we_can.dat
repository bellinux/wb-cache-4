25|$|Our propositional {{calculus}} has ten inference rules. These rules {{allow us to}} derive other true formulas given a set of formulas that {{are assumed to be}} true. The first nine simply state that we can infer certain well-formed formulas from other well-formed formulas. The last rule however uses hypothetical reasoning in the sense that in the premise of the rule we temporarily assume an (unproven) hypothesis {{to be part of the}} set of inferred formulas to <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> infer a certain other formula. Since the first nine rules don't do this they are usually described as non-hypothetical rules, and the last one as a hypothetical rule.|$|E

Bon had mentioned that he had been in England once touring with a band and he had mentioned that Brian had been in a band called Geordie and Bon had said 'Brian Johnson, he was a great rock and roll singer in the style of Little Richard.' And that was Bon's big idol, Little Richard. I think when he saw Brian at that time, to Bon it was 'Well he's a guy that knows what rock and roll is all about.' He mentioned that to us in Australia. I suppose when we decided to continue, Brian was the first name that Malcolm and myself came up with, so we said we should <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> find him." ...|$|E

Harry Knowles reported on the teaser, calling it a [...] "DVD Extra" [...] and noting that it had been filmed before Thanksgiving (i.e. before November 2010).

40|$|Summary: We {{report a}} case of 60 -year old male who had {{difficulty}} in breathing {{as well as in}} swallowing. On examination, he was found to be having proliferative growth of epiglottis and right aryepiglottic fold mimicking neoplasm. So emergency tracheostomy was performed and biopsy taken. He was found to be having asymptomatic miliary mottling on routine x-ray chest PA view. Further on HRCT, {{it turned out to be}} lesion suggesting tubercular etiology. Histopathology (epiglottic biopsy) report confirmed the whole process as tubercular. The patient recovered promptly in due course with anti-tubercular treatment.

40|$|The {{churn rate}} of a {{peer-to-peer}} system places direct {{limitations on the}} rate at which messages can be effectively communicated to a group of peers. These limitations are independent of the topology and message transmission latency. In this paper we consider a peer-to-peer network, based on the Engset model, where peers arrive and depart independently at random. We show how the arrival and departure rates directly limit the capacity for message streams to be broadcast to all other peers, by deriving mean field models that accurately describe the system behavior. Our models cover the unit and more general k buffer cases, i. e. where a peer can buffer at most k messages at any one time, and we give results for both single and multi-source message streams. We define coverage rate as peer-messages per unit time, i. e. {{the rate at which}} a number of peers receive messages, and show that the coverage rate is limited by the churn rate and buffer size. Our theory introduces an Instantaneous Message Exchange (IME) model and provides a template for further analysis of more complicated systems. Using the IME model, and assuming random processes, we have obtained very accurate equations of the system dynamics in a variety of interesting cases, that allow us to tune a peer-to-peer system. It remains to be <b>seen</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> maintain this accuracy for general processes and when applying a non-instantaneous model. ...|$|R

2500|$|Discontent with Diệm and Nhu {{exploded}} into mass protest during mid-1963 when nine Buddhists {{died at the}} hand of Diệm's army and police on Vesak, the birthday of Gautama Buddha.

[...] The response by Ambassador Nolting was, [...] "We should take it slow and easy and <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> live with the Diem government." [...] As a result of this potential inability to support the Diem/Nhu government, the United States government discussed a proposed coup. In a telegram to the American Embassy in Saigon, Mr. Hilsman expresses that at some point should we need [...] "political liquidation" [...] we should also [...] "urgently examine all possible alternative leadership and make detailed plans as to how we might bring about Diem's replacement if this should become necessary." [...] In May 1963, a law against the flying of religious flags was selectively enforced; the Buddhist flag was banned from display on Vesak while the Vatican flag was displayed to celebrate the anniversary of the consecration of Archbishop Pierre Martin Ngô Đình Thục, Diệm's brother. Many Buddhists defied the ban and a protest was ended when government forces opened fire. With Diệm remaining intransigent in the face of escalating Buddhist demands for religious equality, sections of society began calling for his removal from power.|$|E
2500|$|Here’s an example: Suppose we {{see before}} us {{a parking lot}} full of {{hundreds}} of cars. We decide {{to go around the}} entire lot looking for: “Cars with flat (bad) tires”.

He explained that: [...] "That is what I liked about [...] the job, because the guy doesn’t really exist that much, so you can just create whatever you want. Then, when I found out there was another book from Edward’s perspective, [...] we had the same perspective!" [...] In preparation for the role, Pattinson wrote journal entries as Edward and distanced from his friends and family, explaining that he [...] "wanted to feel his isolation". Physically, he revealed that; [...] "I was supposed to get a six-pack. But it didn't really work out." [...] One scene in the story sees Edward, a gifted pianist, compose a lullaby for Bella. Pattinson was given the opportunity to submit a composition for consideration for this scene, with Hardwicke stating; [...] "I told him he should write one, and let’s <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> make it work, because that would be really cool if it was Rob’s song. He’s a beautiful musician, a very creative soul, very similar to Edward.

[...] Meyer approved; [...] "If Robert could write a lullaby, that would definitely add to some of the mystique of the movie, wouldn’t it?"
