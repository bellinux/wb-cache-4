40|$|Abstract—This paper {{focuses on}} an {{analytical}} {{description of the}} field and associated iron losses in the <b>stator</b> <b>yoke</b> of a simplified two pole permanent magnet machine. By using the time separation of the flux density derivative components a simpified analytical expression for the total loss in the yoke is derived. 1 Index Terms—iron loss, <b>stator</b> <b>yoke,</b> Fourier series I. FIELD CHARACTERISTICS The <b>stator</b> <b>yoke</b> iron of an inner rotor electrical machine experiences both radial and tangential flux components during a revolution. The changes in radial and tangential flux densities often occur in separate time intervals. The flux density vector thus describes a rectangle during a rotor revolution. Some analytical iron loss models only take into account the fundamental wave thus approximating the rectangular curve with an ellipse and leaving higher harmonics to numerical analysis. The flux density in the yoke under sinusoidal flux density boundary conditions are described in [1] on page 551 onwards where it is also noted that field from other waveform boundary conditions can be expressed as a Fourier series sum. For odd waveforms on the inner radius the flux density is: Br = − n= 1 bn(Cnrn− 1 −Dnr−n− 1) ·sin(n(θ + ωt)) Bt = n= 1 bn(Cnrn− 1 +Dnr−n− 1) ·cos(n(θ + ωt)) (1) where bn are the odd Fourier coefficients of the waveform and Cn and Dn are geometric constants...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a comprehensive analytical model for dual rotor radial flux wind generators {{based on the}} equivalent magnetic circuit method. This model is developed to predict the flux densities of {{the inner and outer}} air gaps, flux densities of the rotor and <b>stator</b> <b>yokes,</b> back electromotive force (EMF), electromagnetic torque, cogging torque, and some other characteristics important for generator design. The 2 D finite element method (FEM) is employed to verify the presented analytical model, fine-tune it, and validate the prediction precision. The results show that the errors between the proposed analytical model and the FEM results are less than 5 % and even less than 1 % for certain parameters, that is, the results obtained from the proposed analytical model match well the ones obtained from FEM analysis. Meanwhile, the working points at different temperatures are confirmed to exceed the knee point of the BH curve, which means that irreversible demagnetization does not occur. Finally, the optimization by FEM with the objective of fully using the inner space of the generator, decreasing the cogging torque, and reducing the total harmonic distortion (THD) of back EMF is performed...|$|R
40|$|Axial-flux {{machines}} {{tend to have}} cooling difficulties {{since it}} is difficult to arrange continuous heat path between the stator stack and the frame. One important {{reason for this is that}} no shrink fitting of the stator is possible in an axial-flux machine. Using of liquid-cooled end shields does not alone solve this issue. Cooling of the rotor and the end windings may also be difficult at least in case of two-stator-single-rotor construction where air circulation in the rotor and in the end-winding areas may be difficult to arrange. If the rotor has significant losses air circulation via the rotor and behind the <b>stator</b> <b>yokes</b> should be arranged which, again, weakens the stator cooling. In this paper we study a novel way of using copper bars as extra heat transfer paths between the stator teeth and liquid cooling pools in the end shields. After this the end windings still suffer of low thermal conductivity and means for improving this by high-heat-conductance material was also studied. The design principle of each cooling system is presented in details. Thermal models based on Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) are used to analyse the temperature distribution in the machine. Measurement results are provided from different versions of the machine. The results show that significant improvements in the cooling can be gained by these steps. Post-print / final draf...|$|R

40|$|The {{distortion}} due to {{the mechanical}} stresses from manufacturing issues and the operation of electrical machines {{are known to have}} adverse effect on the magnetic properties of electrical iron core and {{due to the}} stress dependency of iron core losses, it is therefore imperative that we account for the stresses from the different conditions causing mechanical stresses in a rotating electrical machine. This work presents a 2 -D FE-analysis of the mechanical stresses due to shrink fitting, centrifugal forces and the magnetic forces in a 4 -pole, 3 -phase synchronous reluctance machine at rated frequency of 50 Hz. The stresses due to shrink fitting and centrifugal forces were computed by solid mechanics method, while the stresses due to magnetic forces were computed using both magnetic field method and solid mechanics method. The total mechanical stress distributions from all stress sources were obtained using a weakly coupled approach. It was found that shrink fitting causes a very large tensile stress at the rotor core and compressive stress in most part of the <b>stator</b> <b>yoke,</b> but have almost no effect at the stator teeth. The centrifugal forces also contribute to the total tensile stress of the rotor core. The magnetic forces have the least effect on the total stress distribution of the machine. The combined stresses obtained are mostly tensile at the rotor core and compressive at most part of the <b>stator</b> <b>yoke,</b> while the stator teeth were under low tensile stress due to the magnetic forces. The presence of flux barriers between flux paths at the rotor core causes large stresses to distribute at the bridge between flux barriers near the fit interface.

In this paper, the influence of cross-saturation on a resonance-based position estimation method is studied. The method extracts position information from electrical resonances triggered in an idle motor phase. A cross-saturation mitigation scheme is presented {{in order to reduce the}} commutation position error. The scheme uses only one additional parameter per phase which can be measured automatically during commissioning of the drive.

40|$|Lately, {{there has}} been {{increased}} interest in hybrid excitation electrical machines. Hybrid excitation is a construction that combines permanent magnet excitation with wound field excitation.

40|$|High-efficiency permanent-magnet {{synchronous}} machine (PMSM) drive systems need not only optimally designed motors but also efficiency-oriented control strategies. However, the existing control strategies only focus on partial loss optimization. This paper proposes a novel analytic loss model of PMSM in either sine-wave pulse-width modulation (SPWM) or space vector {{pulse width modulation}} (SVPWM) which can take into account both the fundamental loss and harmonic loss. The fundamental loss is divided into fundamental copper loss and fundamental iron loss which is estimated by the average flux density in the <b>stator</b> tooth and <b>yoke.</b> In addition, the harmonic loss is obtained from the Bertotti iron loss formula by the harmonic voltages of the three-phase inverter in either SPWM or SVPWM which are calculated by double Fourier integral analysis. Based on the analytic loss model, this paper proposes a maximum efficiency per torque (MEPT) control strategy which can minimize the electromagnetic loss of PMSM in the whole operation range. As the loss model of PMSM is too complicated to obtain the analytical solution of optimal loss, a golden section method is applied to achieve the optimal operation point accurately, which can make PMSM work at maximum efficiency. The optimized results between SPWM and SVPWM show that the MEPT in SVPWM has a better effect on the optimization performance.

40|$|The UE {{investments}} for the renewable source development, {{in order to}} achieve the set goals (Kyoto protocol and “ 20 - 20 - 20 ” targets), push to investigate in new technologies and to develop the existing. In this context, the cogeneration (CHP) plays a fundamental role, and in particular, the micro-CHP has wide development margins. Among the different cogeneration process, the systems driven by a free-piston Stirling engine {{are one of the most}} significant challenges in the research area. In such systems, the thermal energy, coming from primary energy source (for example renewable energy), is converted into mechanical energy through a Stirling engine, and then a linear generator converts the mechanical energy into electrical energy, finally, the generator is connected to the electric grid or to the load by means of an electric converter. The use of the linear generator, instead of the traditional systems of linear to alternating motion conversion (rod-crank system), allows achieving several advantages, including: improving the system reliability, noise and cost reduction. Finally, this kind of system, if well-designed, allows improving the system efficiency. In this thesis a linear generator, directly coupled to a free-piston Stirling engine in a CHP system, was developed and analysed. It was found, after a first phase of the study and literature review, that the most convenient choice, from the technical and economic point of view, is a single-phase tubular permanent magnet linear generator. In particular, the magnets are made of plasto-neodymium, while, for the realization of the stator magnetic circuit, due to the geometrical complexity, soft magnetic composites (SMC) materials have been considered. In order to determine the generator performance, an analysis method based on FEAs was developed. This simplified method (HFEA) allows the study and the comparison of different magnetization patterns and current supply strategies. The proposed methodology exploits the representation of the magnetization spatial harmonics through an analytical processing that allows taking into account different magnetization profile of the permanent magnets. Thus, it was possible to reconstruct the most important quantities, such as the flux density and the flux linkage, superposing the effect of each harmonic obtained through the Fourier analysis. Furthermore, a procedure, able to reproduce the effects of magnetic saturation of the mover, generally not negligible in such kind of machines, was developed. For this purpose, an appropriate surface current distribution on the yoke of the mover was introduced, in order to reproduce the demagnetizing effect due to the saturation. By means of the air gap flux density, the force provided by linear generator was calculated, while, by means of the flux density sampled on suitable points on the <b>stator</b> and mover <b>yokes,</b> the iron losses were estimated and then the machine efficiency. By means of the flux linkage the emf provided by linear generator was determined. The results show a very good agreement with corresponding FEAs. The proposed analysis method allows carrying out a parametric analysis with a lower computational effort. Thanks to this feature, different magnetization patterns, supply strategies and SMC materials can be compared in order to optimize the machine design. A prototype based on the design guidelines was built; then, a procedure based on experimental measurement was developed to characterize the electromagnetic parameters. To determine the magnetization profile of the magnets, the flux density on the mover surface was carried out by means of a Gaussmeter. As regards the SMC materials that compose the stator core, a calculation method was developed from suitable experimental elaborations, in order to determine the most important magnetic properties, such as the BH curve and core loss coefficients. From experimental results, it can be noted that the actual characteristics are poorer than those provided by the manufactured datasheets, likely due to the manufacturing processes and spurious air gaps between the SMC modules. The update electromagnetic parameters are used to determine the actual performance of the machine, particularly to estimate the efficiency, the emf and the force. Finally, a simplified model of the cogeneration system was developed in order to predict the dynamic behaviour and particularly, the actual values of the speed, output power and efficiency. This model allows developing the control strategy of the linear generator acting on the electric converter...|$|R

40|$|Large {{low speed}} hydro-generators (fig. 1) {{have a very}} small {{specific}} air-gap to stator bore diameter ratio making it virtually impossible to have a perfect centering of the rotor within the stator during the assembly process. Therefore the machines are operated with an eccentricity that, though small, is not negligible, and {{is the cause of}} undesirable effects: considerable unbalanced magnetic pulls, vibrations, additional losses. It is therefore important to assess the eccentricity and even more to check its trend in case of any stator or rotor deformations in order to guarantee a safe operation and to prevent any serious damage at an early stage. This paper describes a novel and patented [1] air-gap monitoring system for large low speed synchronous hydro-generators. This new system is based on inductive sensors made of simple coils dis-Fig. 1 : Large low speed hydro-generator. tributed {{on the periphery of the}} stator, each one between two ventilation ducts. These coils may be put in place by the manufacturer; for generators already in operation, the coils are put in place from the back of the <b>stator</b> <b>yoke</b> using a simple method. It does not require an access to the rotor; of course the coils are easy to remove...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this report is to study a medium voltage {{brushless}} DC (BLDC) motor for the Cascaded Cell Commutated (CCC) drive topology for high power applications. Presently AC motors and drives are dominant industrial solutions in both low and medium voltage drives. They have advanced machine design and control technology. However, the DC machines still have better speed control, higher starting torque and more power density. The main aim of this project to develop the CCC drive in order to compete better with DC motors allowing replace the brushes by electronically commutator. Firstly, {{the performance of a}} 3 -phase square wave machine is compared with a conventional 3 -phase sine wave machine. Then the back EMFs of 3 -phase, 6 -phase and 18 -phase machine are observed. The phase voltages, flux densities in <b>stator</b> <b>yoke</b> and stator teeth, average torques and torque ripples are also analyzed when the machines were fed by sine and square wave current. Iron losses in stator lamination and eddy current losses in the surface mounted magnets are also investigated in this report. The relationship between the derivative of phase current and the eddy current is also analyzed. Finally, the multiphase square wave machine is co-simulated with the CCC drive using the simulation model based on Simulink, Simplorer and Maxwell 2 D in order to obtain {{a better understanding of the}} CCC drive...|$|E
40|$|Permanent magnet (PM) {{machines}} offer {{several advantages}} in traction {{applications such as}} high efficiencyand high torque per volume ratio. The iron losses in these machines are estimated mostly with empiricallaws taken from other types of machines or with finite element simulations (FEM). In {{the first part of}} thisthesis the objective is to define an accurate analytical model for the <b>stator</b> <b>yoke,</b> teeth and rotor of a PMmotor which should work well enough for all operating point (different loads and frequency). This analytical model is found using an iterative process. After building a loss matrix and flux matrix basedon FEM simulations, it is possible to curve fit each of the lines or the rows of the matrix in order to achievethe best fitting for every operating point. This is a very new approach; it was shown that it gives thepossibility, even with a very limited number of FEM simulations, to achieve an accurate estimation of thelosses. The second part of this report focuses on optimizing this analytical method, comparing it with otherpossibilities, analyzing limits and advantages. Special attention is also given to the effects of the losses onthe temperatures {{in different parts of the}} machine. In the last part of the thesis, the analytical model isused to test a new control strategy. Its goal is to reduce the total losses of the motor and optimize the ratiobetween torque and total losses for a given driving cycle...|$|E
40|$|International audienceWe {{present a}} new concept for a two-pole superconducting {{synchronous}} machine. This electrical motor is composed of a classical <b>stator</b> <b>yoke,</b> and an original superconducting inductor. The inductor is composed of two coaxial circular superconducting coils separated by superconductors bulk. Both solenoids are fed by a direct current {{and each of them}} produces a magnetic field in the same direction. An inclined superconducting bulk is placed between the tow solenoids. It is used as superconducting magnetic barrier. The diamagnetic behavior of a superconducting bulk cooled under zero-field is used to obtain a variation of the magnetic flux density in the air-gap. The inductor contains a low-temperature superconducting NbTi wires for the coils, and a high-temperature superconducting YBCO bulk, cooled down to 4. 2 K using liquid helium. The armature is wound with copper wires as a classical one. To facilitate the cooling operation, the motor has a stationary superconducting inductor and a rotating armature, the cryostat is placed vertically in the air-gap of the machine. For this motor prototype, we can obtain a flux density variation of around ΔB= ± 2. 4 T, in an air-gap of 2 cm. This value was calculated by the 3 D simulation for a superconducting coils fed by a current density of 650 A/mm 2. Compared to a classical synchronous machine, the studied superconducting motor could leads to a more important value for the flux density in the air-gap, so an increase for the torque density. This could open a new generation of superconducting machines...|$|E
