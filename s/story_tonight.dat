50|$|An up-and-coming young duellist named Keefer spots {{a sniper}} {{waiting for him}} {{on the side of the}} R4 motorway. Fortunately, he has {{disengaged}} his runner from traffic control for the thrill of driving it himself, and he is thus able to catch the assassin off guard and run him down. Upset by the unprofessionalism of the undeclared challenge, Keefer nevertheless contacts his agent, Jerro Fanson, to find out if they can get coverage of the kill. Fanson promises to do what he can, but warns Keefer that the main <b>story</b> <b>tonight</b> is the death of a prime duellist, Starvil, who just lost to an anonymous spot challenge. While Keefer waits to hear back, Fanson contacts Michaelson, the sports editor of Zone Three, only to learn that Michaelson has already received word that Keefer accepted the challenge and was killed on the roadway. Before they can find out what’s going on, Michaelson turns up dead and Fanson is charged with his murder. Fanson chooses to face a computer interrogation, confident that it will prove his innocence, but is unaware that the computer is registering his claims of innocence as outright lies...|$|E

5000|$|Alasdair Wilkins of The A.V. Club {{ranked the}} episode as an A, calling the it a triumph {{as it was}} able to keep finding new ways to wring jokes and pathos alike from {{well-established}} relationships. <b>Tonight’s</b> <b>story</b> isn’t quite as obvious a season finale as last year’s epic two-parter, but it does feel like a conscious effort to expand {{what we know about the}} characters and, with it, the storytelling possibilities of the show’s universe." [...] Amber Dowling of IGN gave the episode an 8.0 out of 10, saying, [...] "The fifth season wrapped with an episode that was one part Hunger Games, one part Community paintball and all parts parody. It served to bring all of the supporting characters together in a cohesive storyline while still placing strong emphasis on the central Belcher family, but wrapped with a nice little win for Bob and Linda to hold everyone over until Season 6 returns this fall." ...|$|R
