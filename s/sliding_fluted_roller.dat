50|$|Arkwright {{applied for}} at least 5 patents {{relating}} to spinning. They related to a feeder, a filleted cylinder, a roving can, the crank and comb and roller spinning. These patents were taken out in 1775 but were challenged in the courts on four counts : That the patent was prejudicial to His Majesties subject, they were not a new invention, they were not invented by arkwright, {{and they were not}} sufficiently described. The July 1781 and February 1785 cases were based on intelligibility, not being sufficiently described but in June 1785 the argument of not being original was judged. Highs was a witness at the February 1785 trial, and in his evidence claimed he had made <b>fluted</b> <b>rollers.</b> No mention was made by him of the spinning jenny, but it was mentioned as a statement of fact in Arkwrights submission, that Hargreaves had invented it.|$|R

40|$|A new {{methodology}} {{to estimate}} the mass of grain seeds, which flow {{in the shape of}} clumps, was suggested in this paper. The methodology used an off-the-shelf digital fibre sensor to detect the behaviour of the clumps and multiple linear regression modelling {{to estimate the}} mass by the parameters detected by the sensor which were the length and the density of the clumps. An indoor apparatus was used for modelling which resembled the sowing process using the grain drill. A <b>fluted</b> <b>roller</b> was installed in the apparatus to regulate the flow of seeds. It was rotated by a motor at 2, 4 and 6 rpm to cover all the possible mass flow rates which might occur during actual sowing. Modelling was based on several assumptions, such as the linearity between the sensor parameters and the mass. Although errors were observed while estimating each clump independently, the methodology was able to estimate the mass of a continuous flow of seed clumps. The average difference in estimation at 4 rpm was 0. 9 %, while there was overestimation at 2 rpm and underestimation at 6 rpm resulting in an overall estimation error of 5. 3 %. These results showed that the digital fibre sensor could be used for estimating mass flow of seeds at variable sowing rates within the speed limits of the grain drill. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|The {{cropping}} {{intensity of}} Bangladesh is increasing {{year after year}} because most small holders start growing three or more crops in a year. Over a 5 -year cycle due to changing profitability of crops, farmers cultivate 4 - 6 crops with diverse seed sizes, seed rate, row spacing, fertilizer rates, and seed depth. Hence a planter for such diverse cropping systems needs to have multi-functional capabilities. Service providers {{also need to be}} able to hire out their planter for business all year round to justify the investment cost. There are a number of other criteria and challenges that would need to be satisfied by potential purchasers of a planter. The VMP (Versatile Multi-crop Planter) is such a unique machine for two-wheel tractor which can meet the above criteria and successfully establish a diverse range of crops since 2008 (Haque et al., 2011). It has designed with capability for seeding and fertilizing with <b>fluted</b> <b>roller</b> or vertical plate meters in lines for single-pass shallow-tillage, strip planting, zero tillage and bed planting. The service providers remove seeding unit from VMP and convert only for high speed rotary tiller (HSRT). Most of the grain seeds like wheat, paddy, maize, jute, pulses, oilseeds etc. can be sown in line using VMP. It owners are using this device for their own land cultivation and earning cash income through custom hiring to other farmers and could improve their livelihood through this machine. Therefore, an attempt was made to assess the profitability of VMP operations at farm level and the impacts of its operations on service providers’ livelihood...|$|R
40|$|Smallholders in Asia and Africa require {{low-cost}} {{seed drill}}s for minimal soil disturbance while establishing various crops. A seed drill {{that can be}} drawn by the widely-available two-wheel tractor (2 WT) is an attractive option for mechanization of no-till in small-sized fields. The Versatile Strip Seed Drill (VSSD) was designed with the capacity to make up to 40 mm wide and 60 mm deep strips in untilled land along with seed and basal fertilizer application in a single-pass operation, while powered by the 8. 95 to 11. 93 kW 2 WT. An important innovation of the VSSD was to fit the seed box with both fluted roller-type seed meters for delivery of sufficient small-size seeds to achieve adequate plant density per unit row length; and vertical disk-type seed meters for precision and spaced row planting of larger seeds. Both incessant seed dropping by <b>fluted</b> <b>roller</b> seed meters and spaced planting by vertical disk type seed meters provided optimum plant populations that were generally higher than in conventional, full-tillage plots with the same rate of hand broadcasted seed and fertilizers. Time required for crop establishment by VSSD ranged from 0. 13 to 0. 18 ha·h− 1. When the VSSD {{was attached to the}} 2 WT for crop establishment, the diesel fuel consumption varied from 4. 4 to 6. 1 L·ha− 1, which was lower than for most 2 WT-based planters previously used in Bangladesh. In on-farm multi-locations trials, wheat crops established with the VSSD had statistically similar grain yield compared to conventional tillage; however, significantly higher grain yield was obtained from mustard and lentil, by 14 % and 19 %, respectively. The VSSD is a unique, minimum-soil-disturbance multi-crop planter, and can be a platform on which to build conservation agriculture systems for small farms in Asia and Africa...|$|R
25|$|This {{was used}} when {{the best results}} were wanted from long fibred wools and hairs such as mohair, alpaca, long English and {{crossbred}} wools. In the Lister comb, the slivers of wool or hair are fed into the machine over the back plate, through the <b>fluted</b> feed <b>rollers,</b> under the spreader roller and onto the pins of the fallers which disentangle and transport the fibres to the nip jaw. The nip jaw, with its swinging motion, closes in upon the fringe of fibres, grasping them and pulling them out from the faller pins; thus partially combing the fibres which are then received by the carrier comb and conveyed to the pins of the large combing circle into which they are pressed by the dabbing brush. As the large circle rotates, the unique feature of the machine, the side circle comb gives the fibres a secondary combing, removing not the short fibres, but any excessively long ones. The large comb circle carries the remaining fibres to the drawing-off rollers which give the fibres their final combing by removing the long fibres from the circle pins, with the short ones being left behind. The long fibres or top pass through a revolving funnel to the crimping box and into a can directly underneath. The short fibres or noils are removed from the pins of the large comb circle by lifting knives, and deposited into a can ready for removal.|$|R
5000|$|The Winchester Model 1906 was {{designed}} as a more inexpensive companion to the popular Model 1890, the main differences being the 1906's flat shotgun-style butt plate and rounded barrel, as opposed to the 1890s crescent butt plate and octagon barrel. When the Model 1906 first became available, it was chambered exclusively for the [...]22 Short cartridge, however this was modified after serial number 113,000 (in the second year of production, 1908) when it was made to cycle [...]22 Long and [...]22 Long Rifle interchangeably in order to ensure the rifle's continued popularity. There were three different variants produced by Winchester; the [...]22 Short Model, the Standard Model, and the Expert Model. The [...]22 Short Model was made until 1908, when the caliber modification came about. It was distinguishable by its flat, plain slide grip. The Standard Model was introduced after the 1908 change, and featured a grooved slide grip, while the Expert Model, the deluxe version produced from 1918 to 1924, had a plain <b>fluted</b> <b>slide</b> grip and a pistol gripped stock. The Expert Model was a favorite of Theodore Roosevelt's children and cousins. Although production ended officially in 1932, a small number of Model 1906 rifles were built out of spare parts left in the factory until 1936. The last known serial number is 847,997, which does not match the number of rifles sold. This is attributed to the fact that large blocks of serial numbers were skipped during production.|$|R
40|$|Flutes are low-relief, {{elongate}} landforms {{that form}} subglacially and {{parallel to the}} glacier flow direction. They usually consist of till and have boulders at their heads. Flutes can be pervasive in the forefields of glaciers and contain information {{about the role of}} bed deformation in basal slip. There are two leading hypotheses for their formation that involve cavity formation {{in the presence of a}} deformable bed: the freeze-on hypothesis, in which till that flowed into a cavity downstream from a boulder is frozen into the glacier sole, transported downstream in ice, and then redeposited at the downstream end of the flute, and the cavity–propagation hypothesis, in which till flows into a cavity that begins in the lee of a boulder but propagates downstream in the lee of the flute as it builds downstream with time. Five flutes were studied at two temperate, surge-type outlet glaciers in Iceland, Múlajökull and Breiðamerkurjökull, by measuring fabrics based on anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility (AMS) and till matrix densities to infer past strain patterns. To increase the robustness of AMS measurements, a new method for characterizing AMS ellipsoids, calibrated to laboratory ring-shear fabrics, was used, and the magnetic mineralogy of the till was determined with a series of geomagnetic tests, many of which have not before been applied to tills. Flute pebble fabrics from the literature were also re-analyzed. The magnetic susceptibility of the Múlajökull and Breiðamerkurjökull tills is dominated by pseudo-single-domain titanomaghemite and magnetite, respectively, allowing for a straight-forward interpretation of AMS fabrics. When referenced to a single flute orientation, both AMS fabrics from this study and pebbles fabrics from the literature show that convergent fabrics dominate flutes. Locally, however, AMS fabric orientations are highly variable and had shapes that indicate low-to-moderate shear strains (less than, or not much in excess of, 7). More importantly, till matrix densities, which are a proxy for past maximum effective stress, are significantly higher in the middle of flutes than at their sides. The difference in densities across the width of flutes was much larger in a parallel-sided flute than in a tapered one. Together, these data indicate that flutes form by cavity propagation (e. g., Benn (1994 b)) that requires unsteady, subglacial water pressures and <b>sliding</b> speeds for <b>fluted</b> till to strengthen sufficiently to propagate a cavity downstream. Flutes are initiated and grow through flow of weak till into cavities during periods of high subglacial water pressure and sliding speed. Newly accreted till at a flute 2 ̆ 7 s end is then compacted and hence strengthened during a subsequent period of lower subglacial water pressure and sliding speed when water pressure in the leeward cavity falls and the stress that ice exerts downward on the till increases. This effect accounts for high till density near the middle of flutes where cavities were longest and stress increases largest when water pressure fell, and also accounts, through strengthening of till, for the preservation of transverse fabric components in an environment dominated by flow-parallel shear. The strengthened till provides the rigid take-off point for a cavity during subsequent glacier acceleration and thereby allows the flute to grow downstream. Long, parallel-sided flutes and short, tapered flutes are likely end-members of a continuum and represent a high and low degree of till strengthening, respectively, during periods of low water pressure. Flute formation and growth may be influenced by the hydraulic diffusivity of till, and therefore by its texture, which controls the rate and magnitude of effective stress increases during decreases in basal water pressure...|$|R
