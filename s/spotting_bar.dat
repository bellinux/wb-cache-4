R 2 2 Although {{there is}} no retinal input within the blind spot, {{it is filled with}} the same visual {{attributes}} as its surround. Earlier studies showed that neural responses are evoked at the retinotopic representation of the blind spot in the primary visual cortex (V 1) when perceptual filling-in of a surface or completion of a bar occurs. To determine whether these neural responses correlate with perception, we recorded from V 1 neurons whose receptive fields overlapped the blind <b>spot.</b> <b>Bar</b> stimuli of various length were presented at the blind spots of monkeys while they performed a fixation task. One end of the bar was fixed at a position outside the blind spot, and the position of the other end was varied. Perceived bar length was measured using a similar set of bar stimuli in human subjects. As long as one end of the bar was inside the blind <b>spot,</b> the perceived <b>bar</b> length remained constant, and when the bar exceeded the blind spot, perceptual completion occurred, and the perceived bar length increase...|$|R
