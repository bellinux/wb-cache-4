30|$|In this paper, an {{interference}} channel with {{a cognitive}} relay (IFC-CR) {{is considered to}} achieve spectrum sharing between a licensed primary user and an unlicensed secondary user. The CR assists both users in relaying their messages to the respective receivers, under the constraint that {{the performance of the}} legacy primary user is not degraded. Without requiring any non-causal knowledge, the CR uses a successive interference cancellation to first decode the primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>messages</b> after a transmission phase. A power allocation is then performed to forward a linear weighted combination of the processed signals in the relaying phase. Closed-form expressions of the end-to-end outage probability are derived for both primary and secondary users under the proposed approach. Furthermore, by exploiting the decoded primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>messages</b> in the first phase, we propose the use of dirty paper coding (DPC) at CR to pre-cancel the interference seen at the secondary (or primary) receiver in the second phase, which results in a performance upper bound for the secondary (or primary) user without affecting the other user.

A special linear precoding scheme is proposed to enable the SU {{to take advantage of}} the primary eigenmodes. The used eigenmodes are subject to an interference constraint fixed beforehand by the primary transmitter. Due to the absence of a direct link, both users exploit an amplify-and-forward relay to accomplish their transmissions to a common receiver. After decoding the PU signal, the receiver employs a successive interference cancellation (SIC) to estimate the <b>secondary</b> <b>message.</b> We derive the optimal power allocation that maximizes the achievable rate of the SU respecting interference, peak and relay power constraints. Furthermore, we analyze the SIC detection accuracy on the PU throughput. Numerical results highlight the cognitive rate gain achieved by our proposed scheme without harming the primary rate.

40|$|Creativity {{with words}} or {{pictures}} {{is not simply}} a matter of communicating a message, but of communicating it well, in a way that is effective, original and which defies convention. Effectiveness here pertains to the pragmatic goals of the communicator, and the extent to which these are achieved, while originality pertains to the manner in which the message is framed. Language, for instance, provides a wealth of conventions for framing a message; indeed, the vast part of language is a solidified body of culturally received conventions, which fix the meaning of words and phrases and determine the contextual appropriateness of specific terms, topics and conversational strategies. To frame a message in a novel manner that stretches or even subverts these conventions, a communicator must imbue the elements of communication–whether words, gestures or pictorial elements–with additional meanings. This duality of meaning is not arbitrary, however, or communication cannot succeed. Rather, a creative communicator must draw out secondary meanings that are already implicit in the stock elements of communication, in a way that the audience can understand, appreciate and replicate. Duality thus lies at the heart of creative communication, allowing a communicator to say one thing and simultaneously convey another, <b>secondary</b> <b>message</b> that may augment or subvert the overt content of the communication. This mechanism, which draws out and gives prominence to that which is normally unseen or implicit, is Figure-Ground Reversal...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: To {{examine the}} impact of hearing {{impairment}} on a listener’s ability to process simultaneous spoken messages. Design: Nine young listeners with bilateral sensorineural hearing loss and nine young listeners with normal hearing participated in this study. Two messages of equal level were presented separately to the two ears. The messages were systematically degraded by adding speech-shaped noise. Listeners performed a single task in which report of one message was required and a dual task in which report of both messages was required. Results: As the level of the added noise was increased, performance on both single and dual tasks declined. In the dual task, performance on the message reported second was poorer and more sensitive to the noise level than performance on the message reported first. When compared to listeners with normal hearing, listeners with hearing loss showed a larger deficit in recall of the second message than the first. This difference disappeared when performance of the hearing loss group was compared to that of the normal-hearing group at a poorer signal to noise ratio. Conclusions: A listener’s ability to process a <b>secondary</b> <b>message</b> is more sensitive to noise and hearing impairment than the ability to process a primary message. Tasks involving the processing of simultaneous messages may be useful for assessing hearing handicap and the benefits of rehabilitation in realistic listening scenarios.

The precise coordination of these processes argues for crosstalk between the different SAM domains. The products of YABBY (YAB) genes are limited to the organ primordium domains, which are situated at the periphery of all SAMs and which are separated {{by a margin of}} three to seven cells from the central meristem zone marked by WUSCHEL and CLAVATA 3 expression. Mutations in the two related YAB 1 genes, FILAMENTOUS FLOWER and YABBY 3 (YAB 3), cause an array of defects, including aberrant phyllotaxis. We show that peripheral YAB 1 activity nonautonomously and sequentially affects the phyllotaxis and growth of subsequent primordia and coordinates the expression of SAM central zone markers. These effects support a role for YAB 1 genes in short-range signaling. However, no evidence was found that YAB 1 gene products are themselves mobile. A screen for suppression of a floral YAB 1 overexpression phenotype revealed that the YAB 1 -born signals are mediated in part by the activity of LATERAL SUPPRESSOR. This GRAS protein is expressed at the boundary of organ primordia and the SAM central zone, distinct from the YAB 1 expression domain.

40|$|A {{new problem}} {{formulation}} is presented for the Gaussian interference channels (GIFC) with {{two pairs of}} users, which are distinguished as primary users and secondary users, respectively. The primary users employ a pair of encoder and decoder that were originally designed to satisfy a given error performance requirement {{under the assumption that}} no interference exists from other users. In the scenario when the secondary users attempt to access the same medium, we are interested in the maximum transmission rate (defined as accessible capacity) at which secondary users can communicate reliably without affecting the error performance requirement by the primary users under the constraint that the primary encoder (not the decoder) is kept unchanged. By modeling the primary encoder as a generalized trellis code (GTC), we are then able to treat the secondary link and the cross link from the secondary transmitter to the primary receiver as finite state channels (FSCs). Based on this, upper and lower bounds on the accessible capacity are derived. The impact of the error performance requirement by the primary users on the accessible capacity is analyzed by using the concept of interference margin. In the case of non-trivial interference margin, the <b>secondary</b> <b>message</b> is split into common and private parts and then encoded by superposition coding, which delivers a lower bound on the accessible capacity. For some special cases, these bounds can be computed numerically by using the BCJR algorithm. Numerical results are also provided to gain insight into the impacts of the GTC and the error performance requirement on the accessible capacity.

40|$|Abstract. Coordination is a {{syntactic}} construction with a varying semantics. I {{argue that}} besides additive, disjunctive and more specialized kinds of coordination, {{there is another}} main type, namely {{one that can be}} characterized as specification. Grammatical configurations involving specifying coordination can be found at diverse levels of sentence structure. This provides an new perspective on a range of syntactic phenomena, such as apposition, parenthesis, left- and right-dislocation, and extraposition. Certainly, all these constructions are different, and they have been studied before in isolation – but they also have properties in common. I propose a basic typology in terms of four independent factors: restrictiveness, anchoring, backgrounding, and place of attachment. A common problem for the analysis of non-restrictive material {{is that it is a}} priori unclear how to incorporate such phrases and clauses in the host structure, since the syntactic relationship between the two cannot be expressed in terms of regular subordination, which is an automatic result of syntactic merger according to the standard view. Furthermore, several types of phrases or clauses can show up either in a dislocated position or as an intervening parenthesis, which is also unexpected from a traditional perspective. These problems can be solved by means of the particular mode of construal discussed in this chapter, specifying coordination, which is then divided into two kinds: i) restrictive specifying coordination, which can be used to explain extraposition, ii) non-restrictive (parenthetical) specifying coordination, which triggers a <b>secondary</b> <b>message</b> (a proposition if the parenthesis is anchored). Thus, it is shown that superficially very different syntactic constructions make use of the same abstract mechanisms. 1...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Food safety {{education}} {{is most effective}} when messages are targeted toward changing behaviors most {{likely to result in}} foodborne illness. The five major control factors for pathogens are personal hygiene, adequate cooking, avoiding cross-contamination, keeping food at safe temperatures, and avoiding foods from unsafe sources. Pathogens associated with poor personal hygiene have the highest incidence and costs. Inadequate cooking and cross-contamination have lower incidence. Keeping food at safe temperatures and unsafe food sources have the lowest incidence, although costs per case are sometimes very high. We recommend that consumer food safety educators primarily focus on hand washing, adequate cooking, and avoiding cross-contam-ination. <b>Secondary</b> <b>messages</b> should focus on keeping food at safe temperatures and avoiding food from an unsafe source. Evaluation tools are needed to evaluate self-reported behavior changes.

40|$|Three enzymes {{have been}} {{described}} in malaria merozoites: a serine-protease and two phospholipases. The parasite serine-protease is necessary for parasite entry into the red blood cell. This enzyme is synthesized by intraerythrocytic schizonts as a glycolipid-anchored membrane precursor, harbouring a preformed serine-protease active site but no detectable proteolytic activity. Detection of the enzymatic activity correlates with the solubilisation of the enzyme by a parasite glycolipid-specific phospholipase C in merozoites. A third enzyme has been detected with glycolipid-degrading activity, presumably a lipase A. These activities participate in a biochemical cascade originating with the attachment of the merozoite to the red blood cell, including the translocation of the phospholipase C to the membrane-bound protease, the solubilisation/activation of the protease and its secretion at the erythrocyte/parasite junction and ending with the entry of the parasite into the host cell.

30|$|The {{wireless}} sensor networks {{require a}} mechanism to detect the presence of jamming and secure the nodes from jamming since the sensor nodes are employed in dynamic environment. In [16], the jamming attacks and securing sensor networks from jamming are reviewed. The multimodal method was proposed to detect the presence of jamming. Two avoidance approaches were presented. The first entails the sensor networks tuning its operating frequencies, and the second approach is appropriate for mobile sensor networks and nodes are relocated themselves. The competition approach employs power control and code throttling {{to compete with the}} interferer by adjusting resources. In [17], the vulnerabilities of the wireless sensor network, various types of jamming attacks, and countermeasures against jamming were discussed. It is also classified into proactive, reactive, and mobile-agent-based countermeasures. In [18], a minimax robust detection framework is proposed to monitor the node’s misbehavior in the MAC layer. It is discussed how an invader masks the event by jamming part of the nodes in the network [19]. In order to prevent the sensor nodes from the attacker, a suitable model is proposed, and it uses probabilistic wormholes that depend on wires, frequency hopping, and uncoordinated channel hopping. The monitor nodes are employed in the sensor network that detects the presence of jammer [20]. If the monitor node identifies the jammer node, then it sends a warning message beyond the jamming region. The proposed approach in [21] admits a receiver to detect the jamming, if it receives primary message excluding <b>secondary</b> <b>message.</b> The code tree approach offers input to the physical layer in order to evade the jammers. From the simulation results, it is observed that the jamming is effectively mitigated in the broadcast wireless system. And the monitors are deployed in {{wireless sensor networks}} and they employ an optimal sequence hypothesis test to detect the jamming condition [22]. A method is proposed to calculate the optimal strategies for jamming attacks and for securing network. Additionally pareto-dominated and risk-dominated strategies are proposed and numerical experiment is achieved.|$|E
40|$|Aim: This {{study is}} part of a digital {{activation}} plan that was done for Sony Ericsson’s GreenHeart™ team in the fall of 2009. The investigation presents and discusses what Sony Ericsson and its 4 main competitors (Nokia, LG, Samsung and Motorola) have done within green digital marketing and how the subject was communicated on their webpages. The aim of this study is to: • To present and analyze consumer insights on ecologically-driven technology • To present and analyze the eco-marketing digital practices and strategies used by 4 competitive mobile phone brands • To propose a digital green marketing strategy for GreenHeart™ Method: This study consists of interviews with Sony Ericsson personnel, literature and web analysis that focus on the green initiatives of mobile phone manufacturers in the digital channel. Result & Conclusions: A main issue with green products is that consumers tend to find them not as good as non-green products. Consumer insight studies suggest that {{that the best way to}} communicate and promote green products is to focus on their direct benefits to consumers in comparison to non-green products, and communicate the green benefits only as a <b>secondary</b> <b>message.</b> This was also supported by theories such as Levit’s concept of “marketing myopia”, which describes a marketer’s tendency to focus on product features rather than consumer benefits. When analyzing the webpages of Sony Ericsson’s top 4 competitors, it was 3 evident that all 4 mobile phone manufacturers employed green digital marketing in quite a homogenous way. One striking similarity was that all brands have separated their green initiatives from the core of the website. It is a possibility that marketers have done this intentionally since consumers tend to associate green with lesser quality. In order for Sony Ericsson GreenHeart™ to stand out from the competitors, it was therefore suggested that green information should be integrated into the website and to communicate GreenHeart™ as a value-added product feature rather than a product in itself. Suggestions for future research: It is recommended to continue this research and to compare the findings from the mobile phone industry with other industries, such as the Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG), where Green and Organic branding at a glance seem to have been developed strongly. It would be interesting to gain a perspective on the similarities and differences in the green marketing practices of different industries, but also to gain knowledge and inspiration on how green consumer electronics could be marketed in a more effective and integrated fashion. In this perspective, analyzing any variations between on- and off-line marketing initiatives would be interesting to see if the green message changes in a typical marketing mix. Moreover, it would be good to counter analyze the psychological mechanisms why, for certain industries such as food, green products are regarded as high quality whilst in another industry like electronics, green products are regarded as having lesser quality and business value. Contribution of the thesis: The most important finding of this study is that all the analyzed mobile phone manufacturers have many green initiatives. However, they are communicated separately from all other marketing and communication initiatives in the main digital channel. They tend to be set aside that consumers need to search for them, thus the messages are not delivered seamlessly. This makes it appear that green initiatives are being regarded as something obligatory rather than something that has true business value. Using Theoretical arguments on communication strategy from Levit and ClearWorks show how this, in reality, can be changed and be integrated with product marketing where it can generate a more significant business valu...|$|E
40|$|The {{issue of}} {{connectivity}} in roaded landscapes is a controversial one. Conservationists argue for significant expenditures on wildlife-friendly highway designs, while opponents fight against such spending. A recent study evaluating wildlife use of underpasses in the Adirondack region of New York ran headlong into this controversy, inadvertently fueling {{a debate about}} the general efficacy of wildlife underpasses through misleading coverage of research results in the popular press. This poster will detail the road traveled by this project: from conception through implementation, to the publicizing of results and the subsequent media fallout, and will conclude with the steps taken to clarify the study conclusions and lessons learned about publicizing science that is of public and political interest. Because the proposed construction of the “Rooftop Highway” between Interstates 81 and 87 could effectively complete {{the isolation of the}} 24, 000 km 2 Adirondack Park, measures to mitigate negative impacts on wildlife are a priority in the region. The Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) and the New York State Museum (NYSM) recently partnered on a small research project investigating the extent to which underpasses and culverts constructed under a nearby Adirondack highway (I- 87) were utilized by wildlife. Although these structures were not explicitly designed for wildlife, they might still function as animal passageways. Interviews with NY DOT and other agency personnel strongly encouraged implementation of a study of this nature to help inform the design of new wildlife crossings. During a six-week period in spring 2002, we monitored 19 culverts and underpasses of various types along a 141 -km stretch of I- 87 using camera traps and supplemental footprint tracking. The results of this study, published in spring 2003 in the Adirondack Journal of Environmental Studies, made it clear that culverts along I- 87 benefited humans, but were rarely utilized by wildlife, pointing to the low conservation value of unplanned culverts for large Adirondack wildlife. A <b>secondary</b> <b>message</b> was that wildlife passages under future roads and highways should be designed to curb human use of such passages. A draft press release by the authors accurately summarizing the study results was unintentionally distorted in institutional press releases from WCS and NYSM media offices. Local newspapers that picked up the story generally interviewed the authors and offered accurate coverage that focused on {{the costs and benefits of}} the proposed “Rooftop Highway. ” This perspective was lost, however, in small pieces printed in the Washington Post and the New York Times. These stories distorted the study’s findings that almost no animals used the small I- 87 culverts, by incorrectly claiming that wildlife underpasses universally do not work for wildlife. The lack of interviews for these national stories further deprived the authors of an opportunity to clarify this point. While the full impact of the Washington Post article is difficult to judge, it has apparently been cited by some officials and decision-makers as evidence against the effectiveness of wildlife underpasses. This misrepresentation of our results was a blow to all those working to improve connectivity in roaded landscapes, including the authors. We describe the steps taken by the scientists and institutions involved in this study to move constructively forward from this point. We also draw attention to the political climate surrounding this particular issue and a large volume of email exchanges, both of which served to greatly magnify the impact of this relatively minor study...|$|E

However, a substantial reduction of γ-crystallin proteins, but not α- and β-crystallins, was detected.

This is reasonable as in the proposed approach, CR is able to help forward the received messages more frequently, which is more beneficial compared to a retransmission by PT and ST simultaneously that will cause severe interference to one another.|$|R

While many examples have been documented, a comprehensive list of RNase targets is not available. To address this knowledge gap, we compared levels of RNA sequencing coverage of Escherichia coli and a corresponding RNase III mutant to expand the list of known RNase III targets. RNase III is a widespread endoribonuclease that binds and cleaves double-stranded RNA in many critical transcripts. RNase III cleavage at novel sites found in aceEF, proP, tnaC, dctA, pheM, sdhC, yhhQ, glpT, aceK, and gluQ accelerated RNA decay, consistent with previously described targets wherein RNase III cleavage initiates rapid degradation of <b>secondary</b> <b>messages</b> by other RNases. In contrast, cleavage at three novel sites in the ahpF, pflB, and yajQ transcripts led to stabilized secondary transcripts. Two other novel sites in hisL and pheM overlapped with transcriptional attenuators that likely serve to ensure turnover of these highly structured RNAs. Many of the new RNase III target sites are located on transcripts encoding metabolic enzymes. For instance, two novel RNase III sites are located within transcripts encoding enzymes near a key metabolic node connecting glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. Pyruvate dehydrogenase activity was increased in an rnc deletion mutant compared to the wild-type (WT) strain in early stationary phase, confirming the novel link between RNA turnover and regulation of pathway activity.
