5|$|The {{range of}} the Eurasian {{treecreeper}} overlaps with that of several other treecreepers, which can present local identification problems. In Europe, the Eurasian treecreeper shares much of its range with the <b>short-toed</b> <b>treecreeper.</b> Compared to that species, it is whiter below, warmer and more spotted above, and has a whiter supercilium and slightly shorter bill. Visual identification, even in the hand, may be impossible for poorly marked birds. A singing treecreeper is usually identifiable, since <b>short-toed</b> <b>treecreeper</b> has a distinctive series of evenly spaced notes sounding {{quite different from the}} song of Eurasian treecreeper; however, both species have been known to sing the other's song.|$|E
5|$|The Eurasian {{treecreeper}} {{belongs to}} the northern group, along with the North American brown creeper, C. americana, the <b>short-toed</b> <b>treecreeper,</b> C. brachydactyla, of western Eurasia, and, if it is considered a separate species, Hodgson's treecreeper, C. hodgsoni, from the southern rim of the Himalayas.|$|E
5|$|The {{brown creeper}} has {{sometimes}} been {{considered to be a}} subspecies of Eurasian treecreeper, but has closer affinities to <b>short-toed</b> <b>treecreeper,</b> and is normally now treated as a full species. Hodgson's treecreeper is a more recent proposed split following studies of its cytochrome b mtDNA sequence and song structure that indicate that it may well be a distinct species from C. familiaris.|$|E
25|$|A Spanish study {{suggests}} that forest fragmentation adversely affects the numbers of <b>short-toed</b> <b>treecreepers</b> present, as {{is also the case}} with the common treecreeper. Species that depend on relatively scarce resources, such as tree trunks, only occupy the larger forests, whereas those such as tits and common firecrests that exploit abundant, ubiquitous resources are distributed uniformly through woodlands of all sizes.|$|R
5|$|The Eurasian {{treecreeper}} is {{the most}} widespread member of its genus, breeding in temperate woodlands across Eurasia from Ireland to Japan. It prefers mature trees, and in most of Europe, where it shares its range with <b>short-toed</b> <b>treecreeper,</b> {{it tends to be}} found mainly in coniferous forest, especially spruce and fir. However, where it is the only treecreeper, as in European Russia, or the British Isles, it frequents broadleaved or mixed woodland in preference to conifers.|$|E
5|$|The Eurasian {{treecreeper}} or common treecreeper (Certhia familiaris) {{is a small}} passerine bird {{also known}} in the British Isles, where {{it is the only}} living member of its genus, simply as treecreeper. It is similar to other treecreepers, and has a curved bill, patterned brown upperparts, whitish underparts, and long stiff tail feathers which help it creep up tree trunks. It can be most easily distinguished from the similar <b>short-toed</b> <b>treecreeper,</b> which shares much of its European range, by its different song.|$|E
5|$|The Eurasian {{treecreeper}} {{has nine}} or more subspecies which breed {{in different parts}} of its range in temperate Eurasia. This species is found in woodlands of all kinds, but where it overlaps with the <b>short-toed</b> <b>treecreeper</b> in western Europe it {{is more likely to be}} found in coniferous forests or at higher altitudes. It nests in tree crevices or behind bark flakes, and favours introduced giant sequoia as nest sites where they are available. The female typically lays five or six pink-speckled white eggs in the lined nest, but eggs and chicks are vulnerable to attack by woodpeckers and mammals, including squirrels.|$|E
25|$|The <b>short-toed</b> <b>treecreeper</b> (Certhia brachydactyla) {{is a small}} {{passerine}} bird {{found in}} woodlands {{through much of the}} warmer regions of Europe and into north Africa. It has a generally more southerly distribution than the other European treecreeper species, the common treecreeper, with which it is easily confused where they both occur. The <b>short-toed</b> <b>treecreeper</b> tends to prefer deciduous trees and lower altitudes than its relative in these overlap areas. Although mainly sedentary, vagrants have occurred outside the breeding range.|$|E
25|$|The brown {{treecreeper}} {{has never}} been recorded in Europe, but {{would be difficult to}} separate from the <b>short-toed</b> <b>treecreeper,</b> which it much resembles in appearance. Its call is more like the common treecreeper's, but a vagrant brown treecreeper might still not be possible to identify with certainty given the similarities between the three species.|$|E
25|$|The <b>short-toed</b> <b>treecreeper</b> breeds in {{temperate}} woodlands across Europe from Portugal to Turkey and Greece, and {{in north}} west Africa. It prefers well-grown trees, especially oak and avoids pure stands of conifers. Where it shares its European range with common treecreeper, the latter species {{tends to be}} found mainly in coniferous forest and at higher altitudes.|$|E
25|$|This {{species has}} an {{extensive}} range of between 110million square kilometres (0.43.8million square mi). It {{has a large}} population, estimated at between 4.114 million individuals. Population trends have not been quantified, but the species is not believed to approach the thresholds for the population decline criterion of the IUCN Red List (declining more than 30% in ten years or three generations). For these reasons, the <b>short-toed</b> <b>treecreeper</b> is evaluated as Least Concern.|$|E
25|$|The <b>short-toed</b> <b>treecreeper</b> {{typically}} seeks invertebrate food on tree trunks, starting {{near the}} tree base and spiralling {{its way up}} using its stiff tail feathers for support. Unlike a nuthatch, it does not come down trees head first, but flies {{to the base of}} another nearby tree. It uses its long thin bill to extract insects and spiders from crevices in the bark. Although normally found on trees, it will occasionally feed on walls or bare ground, or amongst fallen pine needles. It may add some seeds to its diet in the colder months.|$|E
25|$|The <b>short-toed</b> <b>treecreeper</b> {{is one of}} a {{group of}} four very similar Holarctic treecreepers, {{including}} the closely related North American brown creepers, and has five subspecies differing in appearance and song. Like other treecreepers, the short-toed is inconspicuously plumaged brown above and whitish below, and has a curved bill and stiff tail feathers. It is a resident in woodlands throughout its range, and nests in tree crevices or behind bark flakes, laying about six eggs. This common, unwary, but inconspicuous species feeds mainly on insects which are picked from the tree trunk as the treecreeper ascends with short hops.|$|E
25|$|As a small {{woodland}} {{bird with}} cryptic plumage and a quiet call, the <b>short-toed</b> <b>treecreeper</b> is easily overlooked as it hops mouse-like up a vertical trunk, progressing in short hops, using its stiff tail and widely splayed feet as support.. Nevertheless, {{it is not}} wary, and is largely indifferent {{to the presence of}} humans. It has a distinctive erratic and undulating flight, alternating fluttering butterfly-like wing beats with side-slips and tumbles. It is solitary in winter, but in cold weather up to twenty or more birds will roost together in a suitable sheltered crevice, or in a star formation under eaves of buildings.|$|E
500|$|The {{first three}} field records of Blyth's pipit, {{including}} an atypical pale individual on the Isles of Scilly, proved difficult, but following {{the occurrence of}} trapped individuals, on Fair Isle in 1993 and Suffolk in 1994, these were accepted. Some records of citrine wagtail and <b>short-toed</b> <b>treecreeper</b> were accepted only after prolonged consideration. Prior to the publication in 1984 of Jonsson and Grant's stint identification paper, a number of stints (Calidris) proved difficult to assess; a paper covering four such cases was published in 1986. It included accounts of a bird on Fair Isle, originally thought Britain's first red-necked stint {{that turned out to}} be a sanderling; and a bird in Suffolk, The [...] "Felixstowe stint", which most observers at the time believed was a western sandpiper, but was in fact a semipalmated sandpiper. A previous paper details four early claims of red-necked stint, none of which were acceptable.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>short-toed</b> <b>treecreeper</b> is [...] {{long and}} weighs [...] It has dull grey-brown upperparts {{intricately}} patterned with black, buff and white, a weak off-white supercilium and dingy underparts contrasting {{with the white}} throat. The sexes are similar, but juveniles have whitish underparts, sometimes with a buff belly.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are five}} {{subspecies}} of <b>short-toed</b> <b>treecreeper,</b> {{which are all}} very similar and often intergrade in areas where their ranges overlap. There is a general cline in appearance from west to east across Europe, with upperparts becoming a darker and colder brown. The currently recognised subspecies are as follows: ...|$|E
2500|$|The <b>short-toed</b> <b>treecreeper</b> {{was first}} {{described}} by Christian Ludwig Brehm in 1820. The binomial name {{is derived from}} Greek; kerthios is a small tree-dwelling bird described by Aristotle and others, and brachydactyla comes from brakhus, [...] "short" [...] and dactulos [...] "finger", which refers, like the English name, {{to the fact that}} this species has shorter toes than the common treecreeper.|$|E
2500|$|This {{species is}} {{one of a group of}} very similar {{treecreeper}} species, all placed in the single genus Certhia. Eight species are currently recognised, in two evolutionary lineages, a [...] Holarctic radiation, and a Sino-Himalayan group south and east of the Himalayas. The former group has a more warbling song, always (except in C. familiaris from China) starting or ending with a shrill sreeh. The Himalayan species, in contrast, have a faster-paced trill without the sreeh sound. The <b>short-toed</b> <b>treecreeper</b> belongs to the northern group, along with the North American brown creeper, C. americana, the common treecreeper, C. familaris, of temperate Eurasia, and Hodgson's treecreeper, C. hodgsoni, from the southern rim of the Himalayas.|$|E
