30|$|While IEEE 802.11 ac {{incorporates}} MU-MIMO {{and provides}} the basic framework for channel estimation with the null data packet in the standard (called channel sounding), it has noticeable signaling time overheads. We adopt and modify the channel sounding of IEEE 802.11 ac {{with a view to}} reduce a signaling time overhead and better utilization of the precious airtime of the APs. Keeping in mind that the channel <b>sounding</b> <b>process</b> should be as standard-compliant as possible for being amenable to commercial adaptation, we reused some data frames from the standard in our design. Additionally, IEEE 802.11 ac leaves the determination of the MU-MIMO precoding scheme open and implementation-dependent. We take ZF beamforming as the principal transmission strategy and design the <b>sounding</b> <b>process</b> accordingly.|$|E

The PHY design {{is supported by a}} MAC protocol based on DoF, provided by the use of an excess service antennas both at APs and clients in MU-MIMO WLANs. Additionally, we present a modified channel <b>sounding</b> <b>process</b> with less signaling time overhead than IEEE 802.11 ac.

40|$|The IEEE 802. 11 ac {{wireless}} {{local area}} network (WLAN) standard has adopted beamforming (BF) schemes to improve spectral efficiency and throughput with multiple antennas. To design the transmit beam, a channel <b>sounding</b> <b>process</b> to feedback channel state information (CSI) is required. Due to sounding overhead, throughput increases with the amount of transmit data under static channels. Under practical channel conditions with mobility, however, the mismatch between the transmit beam and the channel at transmission time causes performance loss when transmission duration after channel sounding is too long. When the fading rate, payload size, and operating signal-to-noise ratio are given, the optimal transmission duration (i. e., packet length) can be determined to maximize throughput. The relationship between packet length and throughput is also investigated for single-user and multiuser BF modes...|$|E
40|$|This {{report is}} the second {{in a series of}} {{companion}} papers describing the effects of atmospheric light scattering in observations of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO 2) by the Greenhouse gases Observing SATellite (GOSAT), in orbit since 23 January 2009. Here we summarize the retrievals from six previously published algorithms; retrieving column-averaged dry air mole fractions of CO 2 (XCO 2) during 22 [*]months of operation of GOSAT from June 2009. First, we compare data products from each algorithm with ground-based remote sensing observations by Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON). Our GOSAT-TCCON coincidence criteria select satellite observations within a 5 ° radius of 11 TCCON sites. We have compared the GOSAT-TCCON XCO 2 regression slope, standard deviation, correlation and determination coefficients, and global and station-to-station biases. The best agreements with TCCON measurements were detected for NIES 02. xx and RemoTeC. Next, the impact of atmospheric light scattering on XCO 2 retrievals was estimated for each data product using scan by scan retrievals of light path modification with the photon path length probability density function (PPDF) method. After a cloud pre-filtering test, approximately 25 % of GOSAT <b>soundings</b> <b>processed</b> by NIES 02. xx, ACOS B 2. 9, and UoL-FP:[*] 3 G and 35 % processed by RemoTeC were found to be contaminated by atmospheric light scattering. This study suggests that NIES 02. xx and ACOS B 2. 9 algorithms tend to overestimate aerosol amounts over bright surfaces, resulting in an underestimation of XCO 2 for GOSAT observations. Cross-comparison between algorithms shows that ACOS B 2. 9 agrees best with NIES 02. xx and UoL-FP:[*] 3 G while RemoTeC XCO 2 retrievals are in a best agreement with NIES PPDF-D...|$|R

A type of active sonar, echo sounding is the transmission of an acoustic pulse directly downwards to the seabed, measuring the time between transmission and echo return, after having hit the bottom and bouncing back to its ship of origin.

However, to address the implementation-specific requirements of MU-MIMO WLANs, such as fairness in client access and throughput of the network, we propose a fairness and a throughput-aware ZF precoding in our design at the physical layer (PHY). This precoding scheme not only solves the HT problem but also meets the fairness and the throughput requirements of MU-MIMO WLANs. Besides, we design a MAC layer protocol, supportive to PHY, which decides transmission opportunities (TXOPs) among access points (APs) based on the available degrees of freedom (DoF). We make a mandatory provision in our design that APs should have a sufficient DoF. This can ensure collision-free transmission whenever APs/transmitters transmit in the HT scenario. Additionally, we design an improved channel <b>sounding</b> <b>process</b> for MU-MIMO WLANs with a less signaling overhead than IEEE 802.11 ac.|$|E
30|$|The {{authors have}} also {{published}} a MAC design {{to solve the}} HT problem based on ZF beamforming in [15]. There were two major focuses. First, it illustrates that ZF beamforming is feasible for solving the HT problem in MU-MIMO WLANs. Second, it shows an outline of a MAC design which specifically introduced and discussed DoF-based TXOPs for APs, active and silent mode for APs and concurrent algorithm for clients’ selection. However, in this paper, we have worked out the finer details of our proposed solution for the HT problem {{and came up with}} interesting concepts both at PHY and medium access control (MAC) layer. Specifically, at the PHY, fairness in clients access along with the throughput of the network is given utmost importance. Thus, we proposed a fairness and throughput-aware ZF precoding to solve the HT problem. At the MAC, specifically, we refined the channel <b>sounding</b> <b>process</b> and clearly indicated the way to distinguish between the desired and the undesired clients in the network. Additionally, medium access of APs and clients in both the downlink and the uplink, and the transition of our extended PCF to standard distributed coordinated function (DCF) and vice versa, are distilled on an event by event basis. DoF-based TXOPs and the concurrent algorithm are illustrated in detail.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the Medium Access Control (MAC) layer design for an {{inevitable}} Hidden Terminal problem in Multi User Multiple Input Multiple Output (MU-MIMO) Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs). Specifically, our MAC design {{is supported by the}} precoding vectors obtained by Zeroforcing technique which are used to address the Hidden Terminals. An efficient channel <b>sounding</b> <b>process</b> is used by our MAC protocol to obtain the Channel State Information (CSI) from the desired and undesired clients which are used to calculate the precoding vectors at the transmitters (Access Points). Our MAC design then uses these precoding vectors in order to null interferences among the undesired clients to avoid collision of signals and to maintain the concurrent transmissions among the desired clients. The the parameters such as network capacity, signaling overheads and fairness are considered in the design. Our MAC layer design shows a slightly higher signaling overhead compared to RTS/CTS scheme. However, due to the concurrent transmissions after the handshaking process, the cost of singling overheads are compensated. The simulation study of our MAC layer design shows a remarkable constant network capacity gain of 4 - 5 times in comparison to traditional RTS/CTS. Moreover, the gain is irrespective to the available air-time. 6 page(s...|$|E

40|$|Some factors lead to {{spurious}} {{signals in}} the multi-beam <b>sounding</b> <b>process,</b> including complex {{changes of the}} sea, the vessel motion attitede, the unreasonable setting of equipment parameters and so on. Although these factors were filtered strictly and the system errors were compensated in the post processing, residual errors still exist in multi-beam swath joins. Such errors produce uplift and abnormal phenomena in the measured terrain between swaths. Therefore, a new method of terrain spectrum analysis was established to improve the efficiency of massive data processing and to accurately reflect the submarine topography. This method {{was based on the}} blend of extraction technology of short-wave signals and fitting model of long-wave signals, among which wavelet analysis was used to extract the terrain highfrequency signals (short-wave) and multi-surface function was applied to fit the long-wave signals. Then, the two types of signals were fused to reconstruct the actual seabed topography. Finally, the indexes of depth discrepancy were used to estimate the effect of residual errors. Experimental results show that the proposed method could effectively eliminate the uplift phenomenon of the seabed Digital Elevation Model (DEM), and correctly reflect the detailed topographical variation. This work could further improve the sounding accuracy and the efficiency of swath joins, and beneficial to the fusion of multi-beam digital signals and the image information of side scan sonar...|$|E
40|$|We {{exploit the}} Degrees of Freedom (DoF) {{resulting}} from the deployment of multiple antennas, both at the Access Points (APs) and the clients, to address the Hidden Terminal problem in Multi User (MU) Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs). This approach permits concurrent transmissions {{and is able to}} maintain a constant gain in network throughput in a Hidden Terminal scenario. We treat concurrent transmissions {{as an integral part of}} our design, so we adopt and extend the traditional Point Coordination Function (PCF) to manage them. Specifically, contention free period of the traditional PCF is used in uplink and downlink. In addition, based on DoF at APs, our MAC decides the Transmission Opportunity (TXOP) of APs/Transmitters in contrast to many traditional approaches. Besides, our MAC runs a concurrent algorithm at APs which forms an important part for the calculation of precoding vectors (based on the Zeroforcing) in the Physical Layer (PHY). Additionally, a seamless channel <b>sounding</b> <b>process</b> is designed to support the ZF precoding at the PHY which has 98. 67 μs signaling overhead, lower than IEEE 802. 11 ac.

30|$|The {{vertical}} {{electron density}} profile is the most representative feature of the ionospheric plasma, and its reconstruction is essential for studies concerning ionospheric physics and for space weather purposes. Ground-based ionosondes can measure only the bottomside of this profile, up to {{the height of the}} F 2 -layer peak, that is the absolute maximum of the ionospheric electron density. With regard to the topside, from the F 2 -peak height to higher altitudes, ground-based ionosondes can provide only an estimation, based on bottomside measurements (Reinisch and Huang 2001; Huang and Reinisch 2001). Measuring the topside ionosphere requires an ionosonde onboard a satellite sounding from above the F 2 -peak. Only few missions from the sixties to the eighties, such as Alouette- 1 and Alouette- 2, ISIS- 1 and ISIS- 2, and Intercosmos 19, have provided sets of topside ionospheric data, but with a limited spatial coverage; moreover, {{only a small percentage of}} the total <b>soundings</b> were <b>processed</b> into {{electron density profile}}s (Huang et al. 2002). This lack of experimental topside ionospheric data (Benson et al. 1998) limits significantly the efforts to study and model this ionospheric region as a function of altitude and geographical location as well as diurnal, seasonal, and solar activity variations. Hence, even though, early in 2014, the International Reference Ionosphere (IRI) model was officially recognized as the international standard for the specification of the ionosphere by the International Standardization Organization (ISO) (Bilitza and Reinisch 2015), its topside profile often does not represent properly the real features of the ionosphere. A thorough description of these shortcomings and the corresponding efforts done to improve the model were published by Bilitza et al. (2006) and briefly summarized later in the section devoted to the IRI topside options illustration.|$|R

Underlying a resistive cover (150 - 2000 Om), a conductive layer at shallow depth (18 - 140 Om, 250 - 1100 m b. g. l.) which is characterized by a “wavy-like” structure, often parallel to the topography, appears in all profiles. This paper points out the ubiquitous existence in Tenerife of such a conductive layer, which is the consequence of two different processes: a) according to geological data, the enhanced conductivity of the flanks is interpreted as a plastic breccia within a clayish matrix generated during huge lateral collapse; and b) along main tectonic structures and inside calderas, this layer is formed by hidrotermal alteration processes. In both areas, the conductive layer is thought to be related to major structural volcanic events (flank or caldera collapse) and {{can be seen as a}} temporal marker of the island evolution. Moreover, its slope suggests possible headwall locations of the giant landslides that affected the flanks of Tenerife...|$|R
40|$|This work aims {{to present}} some {{preliminary}} {{results on the}} evaluation of clear sky <b>sounding</b> retrievals operationally <b>processed</b> at DSA-CPTEC/INPE. Radiances are from AIRS, GOES 10, MODIS and HIRS sounder sensors. The inverse solution is solved using five different processing packets (i. e. IMAPP, IAPP, GOES, MODIS, NASA-AIRS). The vertical sounding profiles are evaluated through the comparison with radiosonde from the MiniBarca campaign over the Amazon region. The statistical analyses of the temperature profiles are based on bias, {{root mean square error}} and correlation coefficient. Biases and RMSE changes are function of the retrieval scheme and sensor spectral resolution. NASA and IMAPP algorithms applied to AIRS sensors tend to represent the temperature inversion observed close to surface, while other retrieval seems to neglect it. AIRS and GOES 10 and MODIS (AQUA and TERRA) present high temperature correlation (i. e. R > 0. 8) with radiosonde data at lower levels (below 900 mbar) while HIRS present lowest correlation of 0. 6. The statistical analyses of the humidity for GOES 10 and NOAA 18 - the only sensors used at present moment to infer moisture at DSA-CPTEC/INPE - shows that the mean error is lower than 10. 5 g/kg for GOES 10 and is almost twice as bigger for HIRS-NOAA 18. Overall, the retrieved temperature and moisture profiles are in reasonable good agreement with radiosondes. However, the results indicate stronger moisture biases than temperature biases. Further analyses must be carried out on the sources errors, such as initial conditions, radiances biases and cloud mask. Pages: 1647 - 165...|$|R
40|$|Increasingly, {{electromagnetic}} induction methods (EMI) {{are being used}} within the area of archaeological prospecting for mapping soil structures or for studying paleo-landscapes. Recent hardware developments have made fast data acquisition, combined with precise positioning, possible, thus providing interesting possibilities for archaeological prospecting. However, it is commonly assumed that the instrument operates in what {{is referred to as}} Low Induction Number, or LIN. Here, we detail the problems of the approximations while discussing a best practice for EMI measurements, data processing, and inversion for understanding a paleo-landscape at an Iron Age human bone depositional site (Alken Enge) in Denmark. On synthetic as well as field data we show that soil mapping based on EMI instruments can be improved by applying data processing methodologies from adjacent scientific fields. Data from a 10 hectare study site was collected with a line spacing of 1 – 4 m, resulting in roughly 13, 000 <b>processed</b> <b>soundings,</b> which were inverted with a full non-linear algorithm. The models had higher dynamic range in the retrieved resistivity values, as well as sharper contrasts between structural elements than we could obtain by looking at data alone. We show that the pre-excavation EMI mapping facilitated an archaeological prospecting where traditional trenching could be replaced by a few test pits at selected sites, hereby increasing the chance of finding human bones. In a general context we show that (1) dedicated processing of EMI data is necessary to remove coupling from anthropogenic structures (fences, phone cables, paved roads, etc.), and (2) that carrying out a dedicated full non-linear inversion with spatial coherency constraints improves the accuracy of resistivities and structures over using the data as they are or using the Low Induction Number (LIN) approximation...|$|R
40|$|This study models {{the human}} process of music {{cognition}} on the digital computer. The definition of music cognition {{is derived from}} the work in music cognition done by the researchers Carol Krumhansl and Edward Kessler, and by Mari Jones, {{as well as from the}} music theories of Heinrich Schenker. The computer implementation functions in three stages. First, it translates a musical "performance" in the form of MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) messages into LISP structures. Second, the various parameters of the performance are examined separately a la Jones's joint accent structure, quantified according to psychological findings, and adjusted to a common scale. The findings of Krumhansl and Kessler are used to evaluate the consonance of each note with respect to the key of the piece and with respect to the immediately <b>sounding</b> harmony. This <b>process</b> yields a multidimensional set of points, each of which is a cognitive evaluation of a single musical event within the context of the piece of music within which it occurred. This set of points forms a metric space in multi-dimensional Euclidean space. The third phase of the analysis maps the set of points into a topology-preserving data structure for a Schenkerian-like middleground structural analysis. This process yields a hierarchical stratification of all the musical events (notes) in a piece of music. It has been applied to several pieces of music with surprising results. In each case, the analysis obtained very closely resembles a structural analysis which would be supplied by a human theorist. The results obtained invite us to take another look at the representation of knowledge and perception from another perspective, that of a set of points in a topological space, and to ask if such a representation might not be useful in other domains. It also leads us to ask if such a representation might not be useful in combination with the more traditional rule-based representations by helping to eliminate unwanted levels of detail in a cognitive-perceptual system...|$|R
