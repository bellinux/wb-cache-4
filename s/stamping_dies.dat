Various artificial intelligence (AI) techniques {{are being used}} by worldwide researchers for <b>stamping</b> <b>die</b> design to reduce complexity, dependence on human expertise and time taken in design process {{as well as to}} improve design efficiency. In this paper a comprehensive review of applications of AI techniques in manufacturability evaluation of sheet metal parts, die design and process planning of metal <b>stamping</b> <b>die</b> is presented. Further the salient features of major research work published in the area of metal stamping are presented in tabular form and scope of future research work is identified...|$|R

According to the size, material and mass production requirements of needle, the blanking technological property of parts are analyzed, and its general principles, methods and steps of die design are introduced. The structure of <b>stamping</b> <b>die</b> is gap-frame press, and JB 23 - 25 is selected to do the work. The dimensions of cutting edge and dimensional tolerance are calculated. Finally designing components, checking stamping equipment and drawing assembly diagram are finished.

In order to retrieve cases similar to the case being studied in the library, the Nearest-Neighbors-based similarity measurement method is used. Thirdly, the paper gives an approach for reducing attributes and calculating weights to raise the accuracy and efficiency of case retrieval.

40|$|Advanced high {{strength}} steels (AHSS) are increasingly used in {{sheet metal stamping}} in the automotive industry. In comparison with conventional steels, advanced {{high strength}} steel (AHSS) stampings produce higher contact pressures at the interface between draw die and sheet metal blank, resulting in more severe wear conditions, particularly at the draw die radius. The prediction of tool wear patterns for sheet metal <b>stamping</b> <b>die</b> is a highly challenging task as there are many control parameters involved in the production. This paper presents a numerical simulation methodology to analyse the influences of various control parameters on tool wear patterns of a sheet metal <b>stamping</b> <b>die</b> with different die radius arc profiles.

The custom <b>stamping</b> <b>dies</b> and assemblies needed for this work were expensive and uneconomical in small quantities. Hansen preferred to use standard steel shapes that were already widely available from the steel mills at economical cost.

5000|$|Still, a {{large number}} of Kadetts has been {{captured}} as trophies by the Red Army and available for study and reverse-engineering. This project was conducted by design bureaus formed as Soviet-German joint ventures under the Soviet Military Administration in Germany. There were totally 11 of them, one in Berlin (it reverse-engineered the engine and transmission), the other in Schwarzenberg (steel body) and Chemnitz (wooden bodied station wagon). The vast majority of the personnel of these design bureaus consisted of German specialists and craftsmen hired by the Military Administration. These design bureaus not only prepared the necessary blueprints and documentation, but also provided the wooden master model for the body. They even developed the new trim pieces which distinguished the Moskvitch from its Opel prototype, including hood emblems and hubcaps with a large [...] "M" [...] (for [...] "Moskvitch").

5000|$|Planers and shapers are now , {{because other}} machine tools (such as milling machines, {{broaching}} machines, and grinding machines) have mostly eclipsed them as the tools of choice for doing such work. However, {{they have not yet}} disappeared from the metalworking world. Planers are used by smaller tool and die shops within larger production facilities to maintain and repair large <b>stamping</b> <b>dies</b> and plastic injection molds. Additional uses include any other task where an abnormally large (usually in the range of 4'×8' or more) block of metal must be squared when a (quite massive) horizontal grinder or floor mill is unavailable, too expensive, or otherwise impractical in a given situation. As usual in the selection of machine tools, an old machine that is in hand, still works, and is long since paid-for has substantial cost advantage over a newer machine that would need to be purchased. This principle easily explains why [...] "old-fashioned" [...] techniques often have a long period of gradual obsolescence in industrial contexts, rather than a sharp drop-off of prevalence such as is seen in mass-consumer technology fashions.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Current {{tube plate}} <b>stamping</b> <b>die</b> usually have some common problems, which include low {{standard}}ization, low standard penetration and long mold design cycle. By analyzing <b>stamping</b> <b>die</b> {{used in the}} refrigeration industry, the cold-drawing dies blanking needs to be designed and optimized. Compared with the previous design methods, the method, that the Pro/E plug-PDX was used to design cold-drawing dies blanking with refrigeration equipment, {{has a lot of}} advantages. First, cycle was shortened to one-third of the original; second, the compound pressing method is able to reduce the pressing step and increase stripping device, in order to improve the reasonable structure and production efficiency. The new method proposed in this paper is able to increase design efficiency, shorten design cycles, reduce workload and improve the accuracy of the mold design, and reduce the cost of mold design...|$|R

50|$|Another method {{produces}} a deep engraving with sloped shoulders. In this method, the metal (usually zinc or magnesium) is held face {{down and a}} mixture of nitric acid and a soap-like oil is splashed onto it. As the acid etches the surface, the oil adheres {{to the edges of}} the exposed area. This progressively reduces the area being etched, resulting in a sloped edge; a single dot will end up as a cone-shaped mound protruding from the etched area. This method is used for printing plates (the shoulder supports the printing surface), foil <b>stamping</b> <b>dies</b> and embossing dies. Decorative engravings made by this method may go through a second process to produce a decorative background. The raised parts and their shoulders are painted with an etchant-resistant material and a pattern of etchant-resistant material is applied to the deep parts of the engraving. The resist for the background may be another photoengraving or may be randomly splashed on. The engraving is etched again for a short time to produce a raised pattern in the background. Decorative engravings of this type may also be spray-painted and sanded as in the previous method.|$|E
5000|$|Mass {{production}} of Pitkin watches began in 1836. Pitkin {{with his brother}} designed the first American pocket watches containing the first American machine made parts. The Pitkin Watch Company {{was the first to}} mass-produce pocket watches in America. Pitkin's pocket watches had an excellent reputation for being accurate and durable. The plates for the Pitkins pocket watches were punched out with <b>stamping</b> <b>dies</b> but many times had to be finished to close tolerances by hand. The movements were three-quarter plate, slow train, and about the diameter of the modern 16-size pocket watch. The watch cases they made themselves from gold and silver. They imported from Europe many of the dials, hands, hair springs and balance jewels needed for their watches, even though they tried to avoid using foreign made parts. Pitkin named the first fifty movements after himself, however after that the name H & J. F. Pitkin was used. They did not engrave the place of their production shop on their watches, however the words Detached Lever were put on the balance bridge. [...] Pitkin and his brother made about 800 watches between 1836 and 1841.|$|E
50|$|When GM {{discontinued}} {{the straight}} six in its full-sized Chevrolet models for 1980, Checker purchased a small V6 {{that was also}} used in the big Chevys. However, the large and tall grill and hood made for poor aerodynamics, which contributed to the car's poor gas mileage. A number of the V6s were converted to use propane as fuel. Many of the body <b>stamping</b> <b>dies</b> were worn out after 20 years of use, and that required manual body adjustments by body-and-fender mechanics to make the parts fit. The fenders and doors were the most problematic, as taxis are involved in numerous minor accidents due to their heavy usage.
