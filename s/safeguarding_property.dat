Within the context of Albanian-Turkish bilateral relations, both countries signed the Citizenship Agreement (1923) that contained provisions for <b>safeguarding</b> <b>property</b> and citizenship rights of Turkish citizens in Albania and of Albanian nationals in Turkey while due to the Lausanne Treaty Ankara did not uphold those protocols in relation to Christian Albanians. In 1923 the Treaty of Lausanne formalised a Greco-Turkish population exchange which was done according to religious affiliation and not based on linguistic or other differences. High ranking Turkish officials such as Rıza Nur, a close associate of Mustafa Kemal Atatürk had negative views of Albanians and pressed for their exclusion from the population exchange to Turkey of which Greece agreed. Greek representatives noted that Albanians were confined only to Chameria and had promised Turkish officials that only Turkish speakers from Epirus and other regions from Greece would be sent. Thousands of Albanians from Chameria arrived to Turkey alongside others from Preveza, Ioannina and Florina that resettled around Bursa and the wider South Marmara region and were part of the Turkish effort to rebuild settlements destroyed during the war. Albania tried and failed to convince Ankara to omit Orthodox Albanians who were regarded as Greeks from the population exchange with Greece and to safeguard their property and assets in Turkey. Turkey claimed that conventions in the Lausanne treaty defined automatically all Orthodox people as Greeks and could not be undone for individual groups or cases.|$|E

Tirana was also concerned about the forced removal of Muslim Albanians during the population exchange with Greece who had arrived to Turkey and were living in difficult economic circumstances to be permitted migration to Albania if they so wished. Granted that right for Albanians from Chameria, the arrangement also covered Albanians arriving to Turkey from Yugoslavia to migrate to Albania. From 1925 onward Yugoslavia sought an agreement with Turkey to allow for the migration of Muslims while Albania was concerned that it entailed the removal of Albanians from the Balkans to be resettled in depopulated parts of Turkey. Turkey reiterated its disinterest in Albanians from Yugoslavia coming to Anatolia and that the matter mainly related to ethnic Turks of Vardar Macedonia. With large numbers of Albanian refugees present in Turkey by the mid 1920s an understanding had arisen with Albania to cooperate and stem Albanian migration from Yugoslavia which decreased substantially during the remainder of the 1920s.|$|E
5000|$|The seventh commandment forbids {{unjustly}} taking or {{keeping the}} goods of one's neighbor and wronging {{him in any}} way with respect to his goods. It commands justice and charity {{in the care of}} earthly goods and the fruits of men's labor. For the sake of the common good, it requires respect for the universal destination of goodsand respect for the right to private property. Catechism of the Catholic Church Catholic teaching states that in economic matters, respect for human dignity requires practicing temperance, a virtue that moderates attachment to worldly goods; justice, a virtue that preserves our neighbors rights and renders what is due; and solidarity, in accordance with the golden rule. [...] Even if it does not contradict explicit provisions of civil law, any form of unjustly taking and keeping the property of others is against the seventh commandment: thus, deliberate retention of goods lent or of objects lost; business fraud; paying unjust wages; forcing up prices by taking advantage of the ignorance or hardship of another. The following are also considered morally illicit: speculation in which one contrives to manipulate the price of goods artificially in order to gain an advantage to the detriment of others; corruption in which one influences the judgment of those who must make decisions according to law; appropriation and use for private purposes of the common goods of an enterprise; work poorly done; tax evasion; forgery of checks and invoices; excessive expenses and waste. Willfully damaging private or public property is contrary to the moral law and requires reparation.In addition, Catholic teaching demands that contracts and promises be strictly observed. Injustices require restitution to the owner. Promises must be kept and contracts strictly observed {{to the extent that the}} commitments made in them are morally just. A significant part of economic and social life depends on the honoring of contracts between physical or moral persons - commercial contracts of purchase or sale, rental or labor contracts. All contracts must be agreed to and executed in good faith. Contracts are subject to commutative justice which regulates exchanges between persons and between institutions in accordance with a strict respect for their rights. Commutative justice obliges strictly; it requires <b>safeguarding</b> <b>property</b> rights, paying debts, and fulfilling obligations freely contracted. Without commutative justice, no other form of justice is possible. Catechism of the Catholic Church Catholic teaching reminds that Jesus enjoins his disciples to prefer him to everything and everyone, and bids them [...] "renounce all that have" [...] for his sake and that of the Gospel. Jesus gave his disciples the example of the poor widow of Jerusalem who gave out of her poverty all that she had to live on. [...] Detachment from riches is portrayed as obligatory for entrance into the Kingdom of heaven. [...] "Blessed are the poor in spirit" [...] represents the expectation that those who do not receive all their physical longings are more inclined to seek fulfillment of their spiritual longings through Jesus Christ. “The Lord grieves over the rich, because they find their consolation in the abundance of goods.”"I want to see God" [...] expresses the true desire of man. The water of eternal life quenches the thirst for God. [...] Attachment to the goods of this world are a bondage. The Scriptural remedy is the desire for true happiness that is found in seeking and finding God. Holy people must struggle, with grace from on high, to obtain the good things God promises. Faithful Christians put to death their cravings and, with the grace of God, prevail over the seductions of pleasure and power. [...] For what does it profit a man to gain the whole world, yet lose his own soul? ...|$|E

40|$|In {{an article}} {{published}} in 1955, Murray Kemp analyzed the case for interference with the competitive allocation of resources when external economies of production are present. In the specific model we are interested in—where the costs of any one producer 2 ̆ 7 s operations are affected by the total output of all producers of the same product—Kemp attempted to show that where entry into the industry is closed (although the industry is otherwise perfectly competitive), 2 ̆ 2 there can always be found a subsidy, either on the product or on a particular factor, which will be a sufficient incentive to firms to produce an optimal output or to use an optimal quantity of each factor. 2 ̆ 2 However Kemp argues that where there is open entry, 2 ̆ 2 subsidies are rarely a sufficient remedy for the misallocation of resources resulting from external economies; in many cases found in reality, fiscal controls are impotent to restore an optimal allocation of resources. In the absence of far-reaching changes in the laws <b>safeguarding</b> <b>property</b> rights, the only possible solution [emphasis added] in those cases involves recourse to direct controls. 2 ̆ 2 We disagree with this conclusion and intend to show that for the kind of external economy discussed by Kemp, even in the case of open entry a simple Pigovian subsidy is sufficient to restore the economy to a Pareto-optimal position.

40|$|Porter and Ketels' (2003) {{study of}} British {{competitiveness}} emphasised {{the importance of}} business networking for innovativeness. Until recently insights into the dynamics of this relationship have been fragmented. This paper presents a systematic review of research linking the networking behaviour of firms with their innovative capacity. We find that the principal benefits of networking as identified in the literature include, risk sharing; obtaining access to new markets and technologies; speeding products to market; pooling complementary skills; <b>safeguarding</b> <b>property</b> rights when complete or contingent contracts are not possible; and acting as a key vehicle for obtaining access to external knowledge. The evidence also illustrates that those firms which do not cooperate and which do not formally or informally exchange knowledge limit their knowledge base on a long-term basis and ultimately reduce their ability to enter into exchange relationships. At an institutional level, national systems of innovation {{play an important role}} in the diffusion of innovations in terms of the way in which they shape networking activity. The paper provides evidence suggesting that network relationships with suppliers, customers, and intermediaries such as professional and trade associations are important factors affecting innovation performance and productivity. Where networks fail it is due to inter-firm conflict, displacement, lack of scale, external disruption and lack of infrastructure. The review identifies several gaps in the literature that need to be filled. For instance, there is a need for further exploration of the relationship between networking and different forms of innovation, such as, process and organisational innovation. Similarly, we need better understanding of network dynamics and network configurations, as well as the role of third parties such as professional and trade associations.
