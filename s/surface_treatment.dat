40|$|Acquiring {{detailed}} {{knowledge of}} <b>surface</b> <b>treatments</b> effectiveness {{is required to}} improve performance-based decisions for allocating resources to preserve and maintain pavements on any road network. Measurement of treatment effectiveness is a complex task that requires historical records of treatments with observations of before and after performance trends. Lack of data is often an obstacle that impedes development and incorporation of <b>surface</b> maintenance <b>treatments</b> into pavement management. This paper analyzes the effect of <b>surface</b> <b>treatments</b> on asphalt paved arterial roads for several control sections of New Brunswick. The method uses a Transition Probability Matrix to capture main effects by mapping mean trends of surface improvement and pavement structure decay. It was found that <b>surface</b> <b>treatments</b> have an immediate effect reducing the rate of loss of structural capacity. Pavements with international roughness index (IRI) smaller than 1. 4 m/km {{did not seem to}} benefit from <b>surface</b> <b>treatments.</b> Those with IRI higher than 1. 66 m/km gained from 6 to 8 years of additional life. Reset value for <b>surface</b> <b>treatments</b> fall between 1. 18 and 1. 29 m/km. This paper aims to serve to practitioners seeking to capture and incorporate effectiveness of <b>surface</b> <b>treatments</b> (i. e., crack-sealing) into Pavement Management...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Interfacial {{properties}} of four kinds of natural fibers (et. ramie, jute, sisal and kenaf) reinforced phenolic resin were studied by single fiber pull-out test and short beam shear test. Effect of fiber <b>surface</b> <b>treatments</b> on the interfacial properties was evaluated.

Concerns about the poor moisture resistance of natural fibers, effects of fiber <b>surface</b> <b>treatments</b> on the moisture absorption behavior of natural fibers were also investigated by gravimetric methods. The results showed that neither fiber <b>surface</b> <b>treatments</b> nor the environmental temperature has effect on the moisture absorption behavior of natural fibers. 1...|$|R

40|$|A high {{pressure}} water blast with rotating spray bar treatment for removing paint and rubber deposits from airport runways is studied. The results of the evaluation suggest that the treatment is very effective in removing above surface paint and rubber deposits {{to the point that}} pavement skid resistance is restored to trafficked but uncontaminated runway surface skid resistance levels. Aircraft operating problems created by runway slipperiness are reviewed along with an assessment of the contributions that pavement <b>surface</b> <b>treatments,</b> <b>surface</b> weathering, traffic polishing, and rubber deposits make in creating or alleviating runway slipperiness. The results suggest that conventional <b>surface</b> <b>treatments</b> for both portland cement and asphaltic concrete runways are extremely vulnerable to rubber deposit accretions which can produce runway slipperiness conditions for aircraft operations as or more slippery than many snow and ice-covered runway conditions.

25|$|Chemical etching {{involves}} {{soaking the}} material surface in an etchant such as hydrofluoric acid (HF) or sodium hydroxide (NaOH) until {{the surface is}} etched away to a desired roughness as created by pits and protrusions on the nanometer scale. Longer etch times lead to rougher surfaces (i.e., smaller surface pits and protrusions). Structures with specific geometry or organization cannot be created by this rudimentary method because at best it {{can be considered a}} <b>surface</b> <b>treatment</b> for changing the surface roughness.

25|$|When {{currently}} available implants are used, cemented stems {{tend to have}} a better longevity than uncemented stems. No significant difference is observed in the clinical performance of the various methods of <b>surface</b> <b>treatment</b> of uncemented devices. Uncemented stems are selected for patients with good quality bone that can resist the forces needed to drive the stem in tightly. Cemented devices are typically selected for patients with poor quality bone who are at risk of fracture during stem insertion. Cemented stems are less expensive due to lower manufacturing cost, but require good surgical technique to place them correctly. Uncemented stems can cause pain with activity in up to 20% of patients during the first year after placement as the bone adapts to the device. This is rarely seen with cemented stems.|$|E
25|$|A {{heat sink}} is {{designed}} to maximize its surface area {{in contact with the}} cooling medium surrounding it, such as the air. Air velocity, choice of material, protrusion design and <b>surface</b> <b>treatment</b> are factors that affect the performance of a heat sink. Heat sink attachment methods and thermal interface materials also affect the die temperature of the integrated circuit. Thermal adhesive or thermal grease improve the heat sink's performance by filling air gaps between the heat sink and the heat spreader on the device. A heat sink is usually made out of copper and/or aluminium. Copper is used because it has many desirable properties for thermally efficient and durable heat exchangers. First and foremost, copper is an excellent conductor of heat. This means that copper's high thermal conductivity allows heat to pass through it quickly. Aluminium is used in applications where weight is a big concern.|$|E
25|$|Early implant designs had the {{potential}} to loosen from their attachment to the bones, typically becoming painful ten to twelve years after placement. In addition, erosion of the bone around the implant was seen on x-rays. Initially, surgeons believed this was caused by an abnormal reaction to the cement holding the implant in place. That belief prompted a search for an alternative method to attach the implants. The Austin Moore device had a small hole in the stem into which bone graft was placed before implanting the stem. It was hoped bone would then grow through the window over time and hold the stem in position. Success was unpredictable and the fixation not very robust. In the early 1980s, surgeons in the United States applied a coating of small beads to the Austin Moore device and implanted it without cement. The beads were constructed so that gaps between beads matched the size of the pores in native bone. Over time, bone cells from the patient would grow into these spaces and fix the stem in position. The stem was modified slightly to fit more tightly into the femoral canal, resulting in the Anatomic Medullary Locking (AML) stem design. With time, other forms of stem <b>surface</b> <b>treatment</b> and stem geometry have been developed and improved.|$|E

500|$|The Doni Tondo is {{believed}} to be the only existing panel picture Michelangelo painted without the aid of assistants; and, unlike his Manchester Madonna and Entombment (both National Gallery, London), the attribution to him has never been questioned.

The folds of the drapery are sharply modeled, and the skin of the figures is so smooth, it looks as if the medium is marble. The <b>surface</b> <b>treatment</b> of the massive figures resembles a sculpture more than a painting. [...] The nude figures in the background have softer modeling and look to be precursors to the ignudi, the male nude figures in the Sistine Ceiling frescoes. Michelangelo’s technique includes shading from the most intense colors first to the lighter shades on top, using the darker colors as shadows, a technique called cangiante. By applying the pigment in a certain way, Michelangelo created an [...] "unfocused" [...] effect in the background and focused detail in the foreground. [...] The most vibrant color is located within the Virgin’s garments, signifying her importance within the image. [...] X-rays of the painting show that Michelangelo incorporated every known pigment used at the time.
