5|$|Passing {{south of}} Bangladesh, the 1999 Odisha cyclone's {{northern}} fringes <b>swept</b> <b>across</b> the country, killing two people and initially causing 200 fishermen to go missing. Substantial damage to housing was reported, causing injuries to 30 people in Midnapore.|$|E
5|$|A strong squall <b>swept</b> <b>across</b> Matagorda Bay {{in southeastern}} Texas on June 27. High winds ripped a ship from its anchor and drove it aground, {{and at least}} one other vessel {{suffered}} structural damage. Although it is included in the Weather Prediction Center's publication, Texas Hurricane History, {{little is known about the}} nature of the storm.|$|E
5|$|Emperor Nero then {{appointed}} Vespasian to {{put down}} the rebellion, who landed in Judaea with fifth and tenth legions in 67. He was later joined by his son Titus at Ptolemais, who brought with him the fifteenth legion. With a strength of 60,000 professional soldiers, the Romans quickly <b>swept</b> <b>across</b> Galilee and by 69 marched on Jerusalem.|$|E

50|$|The Missoula Floods that <b>swept</b> {{periodically}} <b>across</b> eastern Washington {{and across}} the Columbia River Plateau during the Pleistocene epoch carved out the Palouse River Canyon, which is 1000 ft deep in places.|$|R
5|$|In 750 a revolt, led by Majza'a ibn al-Kawthar and Umayyad pretender Abu Muhammad al-Sufyani, {{against the}} new Abbasid Caliphate <b>swept</b> <b>across</b> Syria; the tribes in Palmyra {{supported}} the rebels. After his defeat Abu Muhammad took refuge in the city, which withstood an Abbasid assault long enough {{to allow him to}} escape.|$|E
5|$|The strongest {{winds and}} {{heaviest}} rains were {{south and east}} of Bilis' center, and its outer rainbands <b>swept</b> <b>across</b> Luzon in the Philippines, causing heavy rains, wind gusts to tropical storm force, flash flooding, and landslides. Bilis was responsible for 45million pesos in damage and at least 14 deaths, including three in Baguio City, and six more in the Manila area.|$|E
5|$|As the Classic Maya {{collapse}} <b>swept</b> <b>across</b> the Maya region, {{city after}} city ceased to erect stelae recording its dynastic achievements. At the important city of Calakmul, two stelae {{were raised in}} 800 and three more in 810, but these were the last and the city fell into silence. At Oxkintok the last stela was raised in 859. Stela11, dated to 869, was the last monument to ever be erected at the once great city of Tikal. The last known Maya stelae bearing a Long Count calendrical date are Toniná Monument101, which was erected in 909 to mark the k'atun ending that year, and Stela6 from Itzimté, dated to 910.|$|E
5|$|On August 27, 1893, the Sea Islands Hurricane made {{landfall}} near Savannah, with a {{storm surge}} of , and <b>swept</b> north <b>across</b> South Carolina, killing {{over a thousand}} and leaving tens of thousands homeless.|$|R
50|$|The riots that <b>swept</b> cities <b>across</b> {{the country}} from 1965 to 1968 damaged or {{destroyed}} additional areas of major cities, for instance Detroit's 12th Street, and the U and H street corridors in Washington, DC.|$|R
60|$|And at that {{question}} {{it seemed that}} a great hand <b>swept</b> carelessly <b>across</b> the blackness of the farther sky, and smeared it with stars and suns and shining nebulas as a brush might smear dry paint across a canvas.|$|R
5|$|In 405 AD, the Ostrogoths invaded Italy itself, {{but were}} defeated. However, in 406 AD an {{unprecedented}} number of tribes {{took advantage of}} the freezing of the Rhine to cross en masse: Vandals, Suevi, Alans and Burgundians <b>swept</b> <b>across</b> the river and met little resistance in the Sack of Moguntiacum and the Sack of Treviri, completely overrunning Gaul. Despite this grave danger, or perhaps because of it, the Roman army continued to be wracked by usurpation, in one of which Stilicho, Rome's foremost defender of the period, was put to death.|$|E
5|$|In February, the Soviets entered Silesia and Pomerania, while Western Allies entered western Germany {{and closed}} to the Rhine river. By March, the Western Allies crossed the Rhine {{north and south of}} the Ruhr, {{encircling}} the German Army Group B, while the Soviets advanced to Vienna. In early April, the Western Allies finally pushed forward in Italy and <b>swept</b> <b>across</b> western Germany capturing Hamburg and Nuremberg, while Soviet and Polish forces stormed Berlin in late April. American and Soviet forces met at the Elbe river on 25 April. On 30 April 1945, the Reichstag was captured, signalling the military defeat of Nazi Germany.|$|E
5|$|It was mid-September before {{news of the}} {{declaration}} of independence spread to the outer islands, and many Indonesians far from the capital Jakarta did not believe it. As the news spread, most Indonesians came to regard themselves as pro-Republican, and a mood of revolution <b>swept</b> <b>across</b> the country. External power had shifted; it would be weeks before Allied Forces entered Indonesia, and the Dutch were too weakened by World War II. The Japanese, on the other hand, were required by the terms of the surrender to both lay down their arms and maintain order; a contradiction that some resolved by handing weapons to Japanese-trained Indonesians.|$|E
60|$|Then {{the blazing}} eye <b>swept</b> onward <b>across</b> the {{burnished}} domes and graceful minarets, down into court and park and garden to pause at last upon the ersite bench {{and the girl}} standing there beside it, her face upturned full toward the flier.|$|R

5|$|Much of {{the local}} {{woodland}} was devastated by the Great Storm of 1987, which in October <b>swept</b> <b>across</b> south-east England with hurricane-force winds. A {{significant part of the}} exposed woodland to the north-east of Wormshill was felled and, after replanting, has only recently shown signs of maturing. An ancient yew tree believed to have stood for several hundred years in the grounds of the house at Norwood Farm was destroyed along with other long-standing trees. However, some 25years later, the village displays few obvious signs of the damage.|$|E
5|$|On September 30, gales {{from the}} former {{hurricane}} <b>swept</b> <b>across</b> the Great Lakes. Hundreds of spectators lined the shores of Lake Michigan at Chicago, Illinois, to watch the enormous waves. A schooner was torn from its moorings at Chicago, and crashed into nearly a dozen smaller vessels while being blown about. The schooner Belle from Racine, Wisconsin, went missing amid the storm, while the barge Sumatra broke up and capsized near Milwaukee, taking the lives of four crew members; the captain, first mate, and cook were safely rescued. The storm damaged around $75,000 worth of property on the Great Lakes.|$|E
5|$|As Jupiter {{migrated}} inward {{following its}} formation (see Planetary migration below), resonances would have <b>swept</b> <b>across</b> the asteroid belt, dynamically exciting the region's population and increasing their velocities relative to each other. The cumulative {{action of the}} resonances and the embryos either scattered the planetesimals away from the asteroid belt or excited their orbital inclinations and eccentricities. Some of those massive embryos too were ejected by Jupiter, while others may have migrated to the inner Solar System and {{played a role in}} the final accretion of the terrestrial planets. During this primary depletion period, the effects of the giant planets and planetary embryos left the asteroid belt with a total mass equivalent to less than 1% that of the Earth, composed mainly of small planetesimals.|$|E
50|$|Although Walter Cope and John Stewardson {{were major}} exponents of the Collegiate Gothic style which <b>swept</b> campuses <b>across</b> {{the country in}} the latter part of the nineteenth century, they were equally adept at other styles. Their first {{important}} commission was the main YMCA for Richmond, Virginia (1885-87), designed in a Richardsonian Romanesque style.|$|R
50|$|The canyon at {{the falls}} is 115 m deep, exposing a large {{cross-section}} of the Columbia River Basalt Group. These falls and the canyon downstream {{are an important}} feature of the channeled scablands created by the great Missoula Floods that <b>swept</b> periodically <b>across</b> eastern Washington and across the Columbia River Plateau during the Pleistocene epoch.|$|R
60|$|As we came still nearer, {{distinctly}} beholding their faces, we loudly hailed them, {{inviting them}} to furl their sails, and allow us to board them. But no answer was returned; their confusion increasing. And now, within less than two ships'-lengths, they <b>swept</b> right <b>across</b> our bow, gazing at us with blended curiosity and fear.|$|R
5|$|By the 1830s the British Agricultural Revolution had {{disturbed}} traditional {{society and}} created a class of labourers who struggled to support their families in rural areas. This led to an unrest known as the Swing riots which <b>swept</b> <b>across</b> southern England, consequently reaching Selborne and Liphook in September 1830. The Parliamentary Enclosure Acts of 1856 established a new land pattern for nearby Steep Marsh and Stroud, which still exists today. There was also extensive land drainage between 1860 and 1880; conduits and sluices were constructed to take water from Ashford Stream for the artificial flooding of hay meadows. In Steep, hops were grown for use in local breweries, watercress produced for commercial use, and a condensed milk factory was in operation in Steep Marsh.|$|E
5|$|In 66, the Jews of the Judaea Province revolted {{against the}} Roman Empire. Cestius Gallus, the legate of Syria, {{was forced to}} retreat from Jerusalem and {{defeated}} {{at the battle of}} Beth-Horon. The pro-Roman king Agrippa II and his sister Berenice fled the city to the Galilee where they later gave themselves up to the Romans. Nero appointed Vespasian to put down the rebellion, who was dispatched to the region at once with the fifth and tenth legions. He was later joined by Titus at Ptolemais, bringing with him the fifteenth legion. With a strength of 60,000 professional soldiers, the Romans quickly <b>swept</b> <b>across</b> the Galilee, and by 68 marched on Jerusalem.|$|E
5|$|Planetesimals {{within the}} region which would become the {{asteroid}} belt were too strongly perturbed by Jupiter's gravity to form a planet. Instead they continued to orbit the Sun as before, occasionally colliding. In regions where the average velocity of the collisions was too high, the shattering of planetesimals tended to dominate over accretion, preventing the formation of planet-sized bodies. Orbital resonances occurred where the orbital period of an object in the belt formed an integer fraction of the orbital period of Jupiter, perturbing the object into a different orbit; the region lying between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter contains many such orbital resonances. As Jupiter migrated inward following its formation, these resonances would have <b>swept</b> <b>across</b> the asteroid belt, dynamically exciting the region's population and increasing their velocities relative to each other.|$|E
60|$|Turning {{his head}} slowly and with a gesture of ineffable contempt, Good <b>swept</b> his hand <b>across</b> his mouth. Then he grinned again, and lo, there were two rows of lovely teeth.|$|R
40|$|Using the vernier scan or Van der Meer scan technique, {{where one}} beam is <b>swept</b> {{stepwise}} <b>across</b> the other while measuring the collision rate {{as a function}} of beam displacement, the transverse beam profiles, the luminosity and the effective cross section of the detector in question can be measured. This report briefly recalls the vernier scan method and presents results from the 100 GeV 2008 RHIC polarized proton (pp) run...|$|R
50|$|The real {{opportunity}} to prove its {{value to the}} people of Wyoming came with the paralyzing blizzard in the month of February, 1949. Challenger pilots flew thousands of passengers who had been immobilized by roof-high snow drifts which blocked highways and railroads over much of the state. Tons of fresh meat, bread, produce and Red Cross supplies filled practically every scheduled and shuttle flight to its gross weight capacity as Challenger’s “Sunliners” roared off snow <b>swept</b> airports <b>across</b> Wyoming.|$|R
5|$|Upon its release, Red Dead Redemption was {{acclaimed}} by many reviewers, with praise {{directed at}} the game's visuals, dynamically-generated music, voice acting, gameplay, and story. The game has shipped over 15 million copies and won year-end accolades, including Game of the Year awards from several gaming publications. It is widely {{considered one of the}} greatest video games of all time. After the game's release, several downloadable content additions were released; , later released as a standalone game, added a new single-player experience in which Marston searches for a cure for an infectious zombie plague that has <b>swept</b> <b>across</b> the Old West. A Game of the Year Edition containing all additional content was released in October 2011. A prequel, Red Dead Redemption 2, was announced in October 2016, and is scheduled to be released in Q2 2018.|$|E
5|$|As B Company moved forward, {{their left}} flank was engaged by a machine-gun {{from a small}} party of Viet Cong to their front, while sniper fire intensified. The Australians {{continued}} to advance with co-ordinated fire and movement, but were now receiving fire from three directions. Ten minutes after stepping off, B Company crossed the front of A Company, forcing them to cease their covering fire. Without support, the Australians were now assaulting a well dug-in and largely unseen Viet Cong force that was disposed in a wide arc. Penetrating the position, the Australian flanks were increasingly exposed to fire, while the dense undergrowth obscured the Viet Cong pits and reduced visibility {{to just a few}} metres. Both the lead Australian platoons were soon enveloped, as fire <b>swept</b> <b>across</b> the front of B Company from the Viet Cong engaging them with heavy machine-guns, claymore mines and light mortars. Meanwhile, Viet Cong snipers continued to engage the Australians from the rear, who unsuccessfully attempted to regain the initiative with small arms fire and grenades. The assault soon faltered with steadily increasing casualties.|$|E
5|$|Social reforms {{aimed at}} {{removing}} {{practices such as}} sati and social discrimination based upon untouchability, as well as demands for the emancipation of the lower classes, <b>swept</b> <b>across</b> India and influenced Mysore territory. In 1894, the kingdom passed laws to abolish the marriage of girls below the age of eight. Remarriage of widowed women and marriage of destitute women was encouraged, and in 1923, some women were granted the permission to exercise their franchise in elections. There were, however, uprisings against British authority in the Mysore territory, notably the Kodagu uprising in 1835 (after the British dethroned the local ruler Chikkaviraraja) and the Kanara uprising of 1837. The era of printing heralded by Christian missionaries, notably Hermann Mögling, resulted in the founding of printing presses across the kingdom. The publication of ancient and contemporary Kannada books (such as the Pampa Bharata and the Jaimini Bharata), a Kannada-language Bible, a bilingual dictionary and a Kannada newspaper called Kannada Samachara {{began in the early}} 19th century. Aluru Venkata Rao published a consolidated Kannada history glorifying the achievements of Kannadigas in his book Karnataka Gatha Vaibhava.|$|E
50|$|When North Korean forces <b>swept</b> southward <b>across</b> the 38th {{parallel}} on 25 June 1950, the United States {{soon came}} {{to the aid of}} the embattled South Koreans. Called out of reserve service on 14 June 1951, Trathen was recommissioned on 1 August. As flagship of Destroyer Squadron (DesRon) 28, the ship was transferred to the Atlantic Fleet on 5 October, based at Norfolk, Virginia, and operated off the east coast and in the Caribbean through the end of 1952.|$|R
60|$|For {{some weeks}} Malchus {{attempted}} {{to carry out}} Hannibal's instructions; he and his lieutenants, accompanied by small parties of horse, rode through the country and visited all the chiefs of Cisalpine Gaul, but {{the spirit of the}} people was broken. The successes they had gained had never been more than partial, the Roman garrison towns had always defied all their efforts, and sooner or later the Roman legions <b>swept</b> down <b>across</b> the Apennines and carried all before them.|$|R
60|$|Godfrey {{lay with}} his gun pointed upwards; a minute later he heard the {{rustling}} of wings, which rose to {{a sound like a}} mighty wind, and then some forty yards overhead a dark cloud of birds <b>swept</b> along <b>across</b> the sky. Godfrey fired one barrel, waited a moment and then fired again. With a loud cry of surprise and alarm the flock divided in two, and almost instantly there were several heavy thuds on the ground close by.|$|R
