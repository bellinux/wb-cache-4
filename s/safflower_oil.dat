40|$|Embryonic neural {{stem cells}} (eNSCs) could {{differentiate}} into neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. This study was aimed {{to determine the}} effect of <b>safflower</b> seed <b>oil,</b> which contains linoleic acid (LA), oleic acid (OA), and palmitic acid (PA), on cultured eNSC proliferation and differentiation, in comparison to linoleic acid alone. Results showed that <b>safflower</b> seed <b>oil,</b> but not LA, increased significantly the viability and proliferation of eNSCs. Moreover, treatment of NSCs by <b>safflower</b> seed <b>oil,</b> but not LA, resulted in a significant increase in mRNA levels of notch 1, hes 1, and Ki- 67, and protein levels of notch intracellular domain (NICD), in comparison to controls, indicating an enhancement of stemness. Finally, <b>safflower</b> seed <b>oil,</b> but not LA, caused {{an increase in the number}} of oligodendrocytes (MBP+), astrocytes (GFAP+) and neurons (β-III tubulin+) of which only the increase in β-III tubulin positive cells was statistically significant. In summary, OA and PA, present in <b>safflower</b> seed <b>oil</b> may prove beneficial for the enhancement of eNSCs and their neuronal differentiation...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. <b>Safflower</b> seed <b>oil</b> {{is known}} {{to be one of the}} richest natural sources of {{linoleic}} acid (LA), with values of up to 69. 5 % of the total fatty acids. Linoleic acid {{is known to}} has important biological activity and its absence in a normal diet has been described as responsible for the development of a wide variety of diseases. This work reported purified LA from <b>safflower</b> seed <b>oil</b> could lower blood liquids level of rats with hyperlipidemia. It showed that purified LA from <b>safflower</b> seed <b>oil</b> could decrease the serum total cholesterol and triglyceride concentration significantly, as well as increase the serum high density lipoprotein cholesterol. The serum atherosclerosis index (AI) was decreased remarkably. It demonstrated purified LA from <b>safflower</b> seed <b>oil</b> could improve metabolism of serum lipids and it could play active role of preventing atherosclerosis...|$|R
2500|$|On food packaging, {{the term}} [...] "vegetable oil" [...] {{is often used}} in {{ingredients}} lists instead of specifying the exact plant being used, especially when the oil used is less desirable to the consumer or if a mix is used, such as palm, canola, soybean, and <b>safflower</b> <b>oils,</b> (whereas coconut oil and olive oil {{may be perceived as}} more desirable).|$|R
25|$|Palm oil {{contains}} more saturated fats than canola oil, corn oil, linseed oil, soybean oil, <b>safflower</b> <b>oil,</b> and sunflower oil. Therefore, palm oil can withstand deep frying at higher temperatures and is resistant to oxidation compared to high-polyunsaturated vegetable oils. Since about 1900, palm oil has been increasingly incorporated into food {{by the global}} commercial food industry because it remains stable in deep frying, or in baking at very high temperatures, and for its high levels of natural antioxidants.|$|E
25|$|Lecithin is a {{naturally}} occurring lipid. It {{can be found}} in egg yolks and oil-producing plants. it is an emulsifier and thus is used in many foods. Corn, soy and <b>safflower</b> <b>oil</b> are sources of lecithin, though the majority of lecithin commercially available is derived from soy. Sufficiently processed lecithin is often undetectable with standard testing practices. According to the FDA, no evidence shows or suggests hazard to the public when lecithin is used at common levels. Lecithin added to foods amounts to only 2 to 10 percent of the 1 to 5 g of phosphoglycerides consumed daily on average. Nonetheless, consumer concerns about GM food extend to such products. This concern led to policy and regulatory changes in Europe in 2000, when Regulation (EC) 50/2000 was passed which required labelling of food containing additives derived from GMOs, including lecithin. Because of the difficulty of detecting the origin of derivatives like lecithin with current testing practices, European regulations require those who wish to sell lecithin in Europe to employ a comprehensive system of Identity preservation (IP).|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to compare novel (linseed, {{safflower}} and sesame) and traditional oilseed crops (rapeseed and sunflower) for virgin oil production and quality. On-farm field trials were carried out in the inland hilly and lowland area of Pisa Province (Tuscany, Central Italy), comparing the five species for seed yield, oil and protein content, fatty acid composition, colour, lipophilic/hydrophilic antioxidant compounds, and antioxidant activity. The novel species, comparing for the first time in this area, showed good adaptability, with lower seed and oil yield than traditional crops, but interesting oil content and composition. High levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids, tocopherols and polyphenols were observed in linseed and <b>safflower.</b> Rapeseed <b>oil</b> exhibited the highest polyphenols and antioxidant capacity, followed by sesame and <b>safflower</b> <b>oils.</b> All these characteristics make these virgin oils viable sources of polyunsaturated fatty acids and antioxidant compounds, suitable for emerging functional foods and healthy product...|$|R

50|$|Vitamin E {{refers to}} a group of {{compounds}} that include both tocopherols and tocotrienols. Of the many different forms of vitamin E, γ-tocopherol is the most common form found in the North American diet. γ-Tocopherol can be found in corn oil, soybean oil, margarine, and dressings. α-tocopherol, the most biologically active form of vitamin E, is the second-most common form of vitamin E in the diet. This variant can be found most abundantly in wheat germ <b>oil,</b> sunflower, and <b>safflower</b> <b>oils.</b> As a fat-soluble antioxidant, it interrupts the propagation of reactive oxygen species that spread through biological membranes or through a fat when its lipid content undergoes oxidation by reacting with more-reactive lipid radicals to form more stable products. Regular consumption of more than 1,000 mg (1,500 IU) of tocopherols per day may be expected to cause hypervitaminosis E, with an associated risk of vitamin K deficiency and consequently of bleeding problems.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the {{performance}} of a DNA-barcode assay with fatty acid profile analysis to authenticate the botanical origin of olive oil. To achieve this aim, we performed a PCR-capillary electrophoresis (PCR-CE) approach on olive oil: seed oil blends using the plastid. trnL (UAA) intron barcode. In parallel to genomic analysis, we subjected the samples to gas chromatography analysis of fatty acid composition. While the PCR-CE assay proved equally efficient as gas chromatography analysis in detecting adulteration with soybean, palm, rapeseed, sunflower, sesame, cottonseed and peanut oils, it was superior to the widely utilized analytical chemistry approach in revealing the adulterant species and detecting small quantities of corn and <b>safflower</b> <b>oils</b> in olive oil. Moreover, the DNA-based test correctly identified all tested olive oil: hazelnut oil blends whereas it was not feasible to detect hazelnut oil adulteration through fatty acid profile analysis. Thus, the present research has shown the feasibility of a PCR-CE barcode assay to detect adulteration in olive oil.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to verify the {{hypothesis}} implying that n- 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids inhibit the development of mild chronic inflammation. The experiment was conducted on rats with different diets (control, {{with the addition of}} <b>safflower</b> <b>oils,</b> fish oils and oils from algae Schizochytrium). For processing the results of the collected tissues was used determination of expression of selected genes by qRT-PCR, detection of proteins and in the cytosol and nuclear fractions by Western blot and the quantification of cytokines by ELISA. Feeding oil from algae Schizochytrium has led to lowering the final weight and blood glucose, further to enhance expression of PPAR-gama and increasing the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines IL- 10 and TGF-beta 1. In kontrast, no difference was observed in the expression of GPR 120 and adiponectin receptors or proteins in an amount of NF-kappaB and PPAR-gama between diets. Elevated plasma levels of adiponectin were found.

40|$|Biodiesel {{has become}} a subject which {{increasingly}} attracts worldwide attention because of its environmental benefits, biodegradability and renewability. Biodiesel production typically involves the transesterification of a triglyceride feedstock with methanol or other short-chain alcohols. This paper presents a study of transesterification of various vegetable <b>oils,</b> sunflower, <b>safflower,</b> canola, soybean, olive, corn, hazelnut and waste sunflower oils, with the acidic catalyst. Under laboratory conditions, fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) were prepared by using methanol {{in the presence of}} 1. 85 % hydrochloric acid at 100 °C for 1 h and 25 °C for 3 h. The analyses of biodiesel were carried out by gas chroma¬tography and thin layer chromatography. Also, biodiesel productivities (%) were determined on basis of the ratio of ester to oil content (w/w). The biodiesel productivities for all oils were found to be about 80 % and about 90 % at 25 and 100 °C, respectively. Also, the results showed that the yield of biodiesel depended on temperature for some oils, including canola, sunflower, <b>safflower</b> <b>oils,</b> but it was not found significant differences among all of the oil types on biodiesel productivities...|$|R

40|$|A {{study was}} carried out to {{determine}} the effect of higher shear rates (64. 5 to 4835 [*]s− 1) on the absolute viscosities of different vegetable oils at different temperatures (26 to 90 °C). The absolute viscosities of the different vegetable oils were determined using a Lamy Viscometer RM 100, a rotating viscometer with coaxial cylinder. The torque of each sample at different temperatures was recorded at different shear rates. Based on the rheograms (plot of mean shear stress against shear rate), all of the vegetable oils studied were found to be Newtonian fluids. Rice bran oil was the most viscous (0. 0398 [*]Pa·s at 38 °C) while walnut oil was the least viscous (0. 0296 [*]Pa·s at 38 °C) among the oils studied. The higher shear range used did not significantly affect the absolute viscosities of the vegetable oils at the different temperatures. The absolute viscosities of the vegetable oils decreased with increasing temperature and can be fitted with an Arrhenius type relationship. The activation energies for the different vegetable oils ranged from 21 to 30 [*]kJ/mole. The peanut and <b>safflower</b> <b>oils</b> had the highest and lowest activation energies, respectively.

The primary goal {{of this study is}} to understand the effect of calcination temperature and calcium oxide (CaO) loading on the conversion activity of calcium oxide on alumina in the transesterification of canola and <b>safflower</b> vegetable <b>oils.</b> The mixed oxide catalyst was prepared by a modified single step sol-gel method. Calcium oxide was chosen because of its well known basic property. This study shows that calcium oxide on alumina catalysts having high CaO dispersion, calcined at high temperature, gave high biodiesel yields even under the reaction conditions, such as low reaction temperature, 50 Â°C, 9 of methanol/Oil molar ratio, 6 wt. % of catalyst/oil, and also short biodiesel reaction time, such as 4 â€“ 10 minutes in the transesterification of <b>safflower</b> and canola <b>oils.</b> Also, it was observed that 70 % CaO/Al 2 O 3 catalyst when calcined at 700 Â°C was the most active catalyst among all the catalysts prepared in this study. Moreover, the reusability of CaO/Al 2 O 3 demonstrated that ~ 20 â€“ 250 ppm of Ca was lost during the reaction and the amount of Ca cation leaching depended on the reaction time, CaO loading and the calcination temperature. Also, it was found that Ca cation loss occurred during the reaction did not hinder the activity of the catalysts, which was found by the reusing the catalysts for couple times.
