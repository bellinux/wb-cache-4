40|$|The {{enhancement}} of existing plant breeding techniques, such as cisgenesis, allows plant breeders to enhance an existing cultivar quicker and {{with little to}} no genetic drag. Cisgenesis is the genetic modification of a recipient plant with natural gene(s) from a <b>sexually</b> <b>compatible</b> <b>plant.</b> Unlike transgenesis, which is the genetic modification of a recipient plant with gene(s) from any non‐plant organism, or from a donor plant that is sexually incompatible with the recipient plant, the results of cisgenesis could occur naturally over time. Currently, both cisgenic and transgenic products are classified as genetically modified organisms (GMOs) and are labeled as such in countries which require mandatory GMO labeling. Critics claim that cisgenic products should be exempt from the GMO legislation and therefore no mandatory labeling should apply for cisgenic products. This study analyzes European consumers 2 ̆ 7 attitudes towards a cisgenic product, rice, and estimates consumers 2 ̆ 7 willingness-to-pay (WTP) for rice labeled as GM, as cisgenic, as with environmental benefits or as any combination of these attributes. The {{data were collected from}} 3, 002 respondents through an online survey administrated in Belgium, France, the Netherlands, Spain and the United Kingdom in 2013. Censored regression models were used to estimate consumers 2 ̆ 7 WTP in each country. The results highlight significant differences across countries in terms of attitudes towards and between cisgenic and transgenic rice, WTP and demographics affecting the WTP. In all the five studied countries, consumers are willing-to-pay a premium to avoid consuming rice labeled as GM. In all the studied countries except Spain, consumers have a significantly different and lower WTP to avoid to consume rice labeled as cisgenic compared to rice labeled as GM. In addition, consumers in Spain and in France are willing-to-pay a premium for rice labeled as having environmental benefits compared to conventional rice. Finally, the results suggest that consumers differentiate cisgenic and transgenic products and that they tend to have a more positive attitude towards cisgenic rice than transgenic rice. This seems to indicate that not all GMOs are the same in consumers 2 ̆ 7 eyes and thus, can have important policy implications in terms of labeling and importation of cisgenic products...|$|E

The expression of this construct allows normal plant and seed development but inhibits seed germination. Plants containing the SL construct were crossed with plants containing the tet R gene to derive plant lines where {{the expression of the}} SL construct is repressed.

5000|$|The EPA regulates {{substances}} with pesticide characteristics, {{looking at}} potential threats {{to human health}} or the environment. They claim not to regulate the genetically modified plants, but the pesticides produced by the plants or properties that change the usage of applied pesticides [...] This includes; plants engineered to produce resistance to herbicides (e.g. Roundup Ready), plants that produce their own pesticides (e.g. BT) and virus resistant plants. Authority to regulate the pesticide properties in genetically modified organisms was granted in the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) and the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA). The EPA published regulations in 1994 and begun acting on them in 1995. In 1994 they proposed the exemption of three categories of genetically modified plants under their regulation. These were plants where the genetic material originated in <b>sexually</b> <b>compatible</b> <b>plants</b> (cisgenic), plants that used physical barriers to prevent the target pest from attaching itself, and plants expressing viral coat proteins to protect against virus infection. In 2001, rules regarding exemption of cisgenic plants had been finalised. The other two proposed exemptions were still under review in 2010.|$|R
30|$|Intensive high-input {{farming is}} {{known as one of}} the main drivers of the {{continuous}} biodiversity loss in agricultural landscapes. Diversity and abundance of the weed flora provide relevant indicators for farmland biodiversity. While HR cropping facilitates weed control for farmers and makes chemical weed management more flexible, it is accompanied by increased herbicide use and less crop rotation. Toxic effects of the complimentary herbicides on non-target organisms, e.g. soil and aquatic organisms have been shown. Due to the widespread use of glyphosate, at least 34 glyphosate-resistant weed species have evolved worldwide. To counter resistance evolution in weeds, integrated weed management is recommended. But continuous and widespread HR cropping is still very common. The commercial trend is to develop new GM crops with stacked HR traits and GM varieties with increased glyphosate resistance. However, this approach will not reduce the overall herbicide amounts used in agriculture. Control problems can also arise due to HR volunteers or feral plants, e.g. HR oilseed rape. In centres of crop origin and regions where <b>sexually</b> <b>compatible</b> <b>plants</b> occur, transfer of HR genes to wild relatives can be expected. Biodiversity will be affected by HR cropping systems by the very efficient removal of weed plants which in turn leads to a further reduction of flora and fauna diversity and abundance. A prominent example in this respect may be the decline of monarch butterfly populations in the US which has been linked to the massive loss of their food plants upon widespread adoption of HR crops. Since it has been shown that HR systems are not compatible with measures to stop the loss of biodiversity on farmland, a more sustainable model of agriculture is needed, which, according to the present experience, cannot reasonably integrate approaches like HR cropping.|$|R
40|$|Mexico, {{the center}} of origin of maize (Zea mays L.), has taken actions to {{preserve}} the identity and diversity of maize landraces and wild relatives. Historically, spatial isolation {{has been used in}} seed production to maintain seed purity. Spatial isolation can also be a key component for a strategy to minimize pollen-mediated gene flow in Mexico between transgenic maize and <b>sexually</b> <b>compatible</b> <b>plants</b> of maize conventional hybrids, landraces, and wild relatives. The objective of this research was to generate field maize-to-maize outcrossing data to help guide coexistence discussions in Mexico. In this study, outcrossing rates were determined and modeled from eight locations in six northern states, which represent the most economically important areas for the cultivation of hybrid maize in Mexico. At each site, pollen source plots were planted with a yellow-kernel maize hybrid and surrounded by plots with a white-kernel conventional maize hybrid (pollen recipient) of the same maturity. Outcrossing rates were then quantified by assessing the number of yellow kernels harvested from white-kernel hybrid plots. The highest outcrossing values were observed near the pollen source (12. 9 % at 1 m distance). The outcrossing levels declined sharply to 4. 6, 2. 7, 1. 4, 1. 0, 0. 9, 0. 5, and 0. 5 % as the distance from the pollen source increased to 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 25 m, respectively. At distances beyond 20 m outcrossing values at all locations were below 1 %. These trends are consistent with studies conducted in other world regions. The results suggest that coexistence measures that have been implemented in other geographies, such as spatial isolation, would be successful in Mexico to minimize transgenic maize pollen flow to conventional maize hybrids, landraces and wild relatives...|$|R
40|$|Both {{cisgenesis}} and transgenesis are {{plant breeding}} techniques {{that can be}} used to introduce new genes into plant genomes. However, transgenesis uses gene(s) from a non-plant organism or from a donor plant that is sexually incompatible with the recipient plant while cisgenesis involves the introduction of gene(s) from a crossable [...] <b>sexually</b> <b>compatible</b> [...] <b>plant.</b> Traditional breeding techniques could possibly achieve the same results as those from cisgenesis, but would require a much larger timeframe. Cisgenesis allows plant breeders to enhance an existing cultivar more quickly and with little to no genetic drag. The current regulation in the European Union (EU) on genetically modified organisms (GMOs) treats cisgenic plants the same as transgenic plants and both are mandatorily labeled as GMOs. This study estimates European consumers' willingness-to-pay (WTP) for rice labeled as GM, cisgenic, with environmental benefits (which cisgenesis could provide), or any combination of these three attributes. Data were collected from 3, 002 participants through an online survey administered in Belgium, France, the Netherlands, Spain and the United Kingdom in 2013. Censored regression models were used to model consumers' WTP in each country. Model estimates highlight significant differences in WTP across countries. In all five countries, consumers are willing-to-pay a premium to avoid purchasing rice labeled as GM. In all countries except Spain, consumers have a significantly higher WTP to avoid consuming rice labeled as GM compared to rice labeled as cisgenic, suggesting that inserting genes from the plant's own gene pool is more acceptable to consumers. Additionally, French consumers are willing-to-pay a premium for rice labeled as having environmental benefits compared to conventional rice. These findings suggest that not all GMOs are the same in consumers' eyes and thus, from a consumer preference perspective, the differences between transgenic and cisgenic products are recommended to be reflected in GMO labeling and trade policies...|$|R

40|$|Background: A {{problem has}} {{remained}} unresolved regarding the {{exceptions to the}} unilateral inheritance of chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) from MT+/female in Chlamydomonas and other volvocaleans demonstrated by the previous genetic analyses. For identification of the parental types of cpDNA, these studies used parents that have differences in restriction fragment length polymorphisms and exhibit partial sexual incompatibility. Methodology/Principal Findings: In the present study, we used <b>sexually</b> <b>compatible</b> parents of the isogamous colonial volvocalean Gonium maiaprilis that seemed an ideal species to identify the pattern of cpDNA inheritance based on the length difference in the putative group I intron interrupted in the Rubisco large subunit gene and objective identification of mating types by {{the presence or absence}} of the minus-dominance (MID) gene. We examined patterns of inheritance of cpDNA and presence/absence of a MID ortholog (GmMID) in 107 F 1 progeny of G. maiaprilis that were obtained by inducing germination of separated single zygotes. The results demonstrated no exception of the uniparental inheritance of cpDNA from the MT+ parent (lacking GmMID) in <b>sexually</b> <b>compatible</b> or genetically less divergent strains of G. maiaprilis.

Two different wild species of all the presented <b>sexually</b> <b>compatible</b> relatives of B. napus were found in Slovenia, B. rapa and Sinapis arvensis. The reference genotypes included varieties and wild forms from internal collections as marketable seeds or from gene banks. Reference genotypes were represented by the following species and subspecies: B. napus ssp. napobrassica, B. napus ssp. napus, B. nigra, B. oleracea, B. rapa ssp. oleifera, Diplotaxis muralis; D. tenuifolia, Raphanus raphanistrum, R. sativus, R. sativus var. oleiformis, Rapistrum rugosum, S. alba and S. arvensis. Estimation of gene flow described by average number of migrants was 0. 72 followed by 0. 20 migrants. Due to the observed gene migrations, genetic drift and selection, Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was not met. The mean number of alleles over all loci was 16. 9, the average polymorphic information content was 0. 43. We found four highly divergent and polymorphic loci (Na 12 -C 08, Na 10 -A 08, Ni 3 -G 04 b and BRMS- 050) at statistically significant level (p< 0. 05) of gene flow detected.

30|$|A further {{source of}} {{concern is the}} {{potential}} for hybridisation with related species. In fact, many of the <b>sexually</b> <b>compatible</b> species cited in [27] can be found in ruderal habitats in Switzerland [40]. In particular, several of them were detected on the railroads of Ticino (e.g. Brassica oleracea L., Brassica rapa L., Diplotaxis muralis (L.) DC., Diplotaxis tenuifolia (L.) DC., Erucastrum gallicum (Willd.) O.E. Schulz, Raphanus raphanistrum L., Rapistrum rugosum (L.) All.), and often grow sympatrically with oilseed rape [29, 30]. For most of these species, hybridisation frequencies with oilseed rape are very low, but introgression can occur significantly with B. rapa (reviewed in [41]). However, under strong selection pressure such as regular herbicide application on railway infrastructure, a rare hybridisation event may have significant biological consequences. For instance, a previous study on the prickly (wild) lettuce (Lactuca serriola L.), an almost completely autogamous species with low hybridisation rates with its cultivated counterpart Lactuca sativa L. (tens of times lower than between oilseed rape and B. rapa), showed that even rare hybridization events could have important consequences on the introgression of conventional and/or GE-traits even in absence of continued hybridization [42]. Railway habitat may act as a catalyst of gene flow from GMHT oilseed rape to its wild relatives. Moreover, B. rapa may act as a bridge for gene flow towards species with low hybridization frequencies with oilseed rape, but that are <b>sexually</b> <b>compatible</b> with B. rapa.|$|R

40|$|Aspergillus flavus colonizes {{agricultural}} commodities {{worldwide and}} contaminates them with carcinogenic aflatoxins. The high genetic diversity of A. flavus populations is {{largely due to}} sexual reproduction characterized by the formation of ascospore-bearing ascocarps embedded within sclerotia. A. flavus is heterothallic and laboratory crosses between strains of the opposite mating type produce progeny showing genetic recombination. Sclerotia formed in crops are dispersed onto the soil surface at harvest and are predominantly produced by single strains of one mating type. Less commonly, sclerotia may be fertilized during co-infection of crops with <b>sexually</b> <b>compatible</b> strains. In this study, laboratory and field experiments were performed to examine sexual reproduction in single-strain and fertilized sclerotia following exposure of sclerotia to natural fungal populations in soil. Female and male roles and mitochondrial inheritance in A. flavus were also examined through reciprocal crosses between sclerotia and conidia. Single-strain sclerotia produced ascospores on soil and progeny showed biparental inheritance that included novel alleles originating from fertilization by native soil strains. Sclerotia fertilized in the laboratory and applied to soil before ascocarp formation also produced ascospores with evidence of recombination in progeny, but only known parental alleles were detected. In reciprocal crosses, sclerotia and conidia from both strains functioned as female and male, respectively, indicating A. flavus is hermaphroditic, although the degree of fertility depended upon the parental sources of sclerotia and conidia.

40|$|Background and Aims Despite {{differences}} in morphology, the genera representing "true citrus fruit trees" are <b>sexually</b> <b>compatible,</b> and their phylogenetic relationships remain unclear. Most {{of the important}} commercial 'species' of Citrus {{are believed to be}} of interspecific origin. By studying polymorphisms of 27 nuclear genes, the average molecular differentiation between species was estimated and some phylogenetic relationships between 'true citrus fruit trees' were clarified. -Methods Sanger sequencing of PCR-amplified fragments from 18 genes involved in metabolite biosynthesis pathways and nine putative genes for salt tolerance was performed for 45 genotypes of Citrus and relatives of Citrus to mine single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and indel polymorphisms. Fifty nuclear simple sequence repeats (SSRs) were also analysed. -Key Results A total of 16 238 kb of DNA was sequenced for each genotype, and 1097 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 50 indels were identified. These polymorphisms were more valuable than SSRs for intertaxon differentiation. Nuclear phylogenetic analysis revealed that Citrus reticulata and Fortunella form a cluster that is differentiated from the clade that includes three other basic taxa of cultivated citrus (C. maxima, C. medica and C. micrantha). These results confirm the taxonomic subdivision between the subgenera Metacitrus and Archicitrus. A few genes displayed positive selection patterns within or between species, but most of them displayed neutral patterns. The phylogenetic inheritance patterns of the analysed genes were inferred for commercial Citrus spp. -Conclusions Numerous molecular polymorphisms (SNPs and indels), which are potentially useful for the analysis of interspecific genetic structures, have been identified. The nuclear phylogenetic network for Citrus and its <b>sexually</b> <b>compatible</b> relatives was consistent with the geographical origins of these genera. The positive selection observed for a few genes will help further works to analyse the molecular basis of the variability of the associated traits.

These fruit bodies produce peridioles containing the basidia upon which new basidiospores are made. Young basidia contain a pair of haploid <b>sexually</b> <b>compatible</b> nuclei which fuse, and the resulting diploid fusion nucleus undergoes meiosis to produce haploid basidiospores.|$|R

To date {{there have been few}} documented reports of escape leading some researchers to question the environmental risks of biotech products. In this study we conducted a systematic roadside survey of canola (Brassica napus) populations growing outside of cultivation in North Dakota, USA, the dominant canola growing region in the U. S. We document the presence of two escaped, transgenic genotypes, as well as non-GE canola, and provide evidence of novel combinations of transgenic forms in the wild. Our results demonstrate that feral populations are large and widespread. Moreover, flowering times of escaped populations, as well as the fertile condition of the majority of collections suggest that these populations are established and persistent outside of cultivation...|$|R
