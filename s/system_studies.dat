5|$|The 2006 Riga summit {{was held}} in Riga, Latvia, and {{highlighted}} the issue of energy security. It was the first NATO summit {{to be held in}} a country that {{had been part of the}} Soviet Union. At the April 2008 summit in Bucharest, Romania, NATO agreed to the accession of Croatia and Albania and both countries joined NATO in April 2009. Ukraine and Georgia were also told that they could eventually become members. The issue of Georgian and Ukrainian membership in NATO prompted harsh criticism from Russia, as did NATO plans for a missile defence <b>system.</b> <b>Studies</b> for this system began in 2002, with negotiations centered on anti-ballistic missiles being stationed in Poland and the Czech Republic. Though NATO leaders gave assurances that the system was not targeting Russia, both presidents Vladimir Putin and Dmitry Medvedev criticized it as a threat.|$|E
25|$|In 1995 Lockheed Martin {{produced}} an Advanced Transportation <b>System</b> <b>Studies</b> (ATSS) {{report for the}} Marshall Space Flight Center. A section of the ATSS report describes several possible vehicles much like the Ares I design, with liquid rocket second stages stacked above segmented solid rocket booster (SRB) first stages. The variants that were considered included both the J-2S engines and Space Shuttle Main Engines (SSMEs) for the second stage. The variants also assumed use of the Advanced Solid Rocket Motor (ASRM) as a first stage, but the ASRM was cancelled in 1993 due to significant cost overruns.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to controlling {{the efficacy of}} GABAergic synapses through chloride homeostasis, KCC2 {{play a critical role}} in the morphogenesis and function of glutamatergic synapses within the central nervous <b>system.</b> <b>Studies</b> on hippocampal tissue in KCC2 knockout animals showed that neurons lacking KCC2 have stunted dendritic growth and malformed dendritic spines. Recent studies demonstrate that KCC2 plays a critical role in the structure and function of dendritic spines which host most excitatory synapses in cortical neurons. Through an interaction with actin cytoskeleton, KCC2 forms a molecular barrier to the diffusion of transmembrane proteins within dendritic spines, thereby regulating the local confinment of AMPA receptors and synaptic potency.|$|E

500|$|Proposals for amateur {{time were}} stringently {{reviewed}} {{by a committee}} of amateur astronomers, and time was awarded only to proposals that were deemed to have genuine scientific merit, did not duplicate proposals made by professionals, and required the unique capabilities of the space telescope. Thirteen amateur astronomers were awarded time on the telescope, with observations being carried out between 1990 and 1997. One such study was [...] "Transition Comets—UV Search for OH". The very first proposal, [...] "A Hubble Space Telescope Study of Posteclipse Brightening and Albedo Changes on Io", was published in Icarus, a journal devoted to solar <b>system</b> <b>studies.</b> [...] A second study from another group of amateurs was also published in Icarus. After that time, however, budget reductions at STScI made the support of work by amateur astronomers untenable, and no additional amateur programs have been carried out.|$|E
500|$|The oldest {{inclusions}} {{found in}} meteorites, thought {{to trace the}} first solid material to form in the pre-solar nebula, are 4568.2 million years old, which is one definition {{of the age of}} the Solar <b>System.</b> <b>Studies</b> of ancient meteorites reveal traces of stable daughter nuclei of short-lived isotopes, such as iron-60, that only form in exploding, short-lived stars. This indicates that one or more supernovae occurred near the Sun while it was forming. A shock wave from a supernova may have triggered the formation of the Sun by creating relatively dense regions within the cloud, causing these regions to collapse. Because only massive, short-lived stars produce supernovae, the Sun must have formed in a large star-forming region that produced massive stars, possibly similar to the Orion Nebula.Fe into the Protoplanetary Disk|author1=Martin Bizzarro |author2=David Ulfbeck |author3=Anne Trinquier |author4=Kristine Thrane |author5=James N.

2500|$|On April 14, 2009, Griffin {{accepted}} {{a position as}} eminent scholar {{and a professor of}} mechanical and aerospace engineering at the University of Alabama in Huntsville. [...] The university established the eminent scholar position in 1986. Griffin has established the Center for <b>System</b> <b>Studies</b> at the university, which will address the need for [...] "systems thinking" [...] in industry and the government. <b>System</b> <b>studies</b> involve research to understand the many complex ways that technology, nature, people, and society interact so that the workings of an engineered solution are more predictable and more desirable. UA Huntsville is a Space Grant university, and has a history of cooperation with both NASA at the nearby Marshall Space Flight Center, and the U.S. Army Aviation and Missile Command at Redstone Arsenal.

2500|$|In the wild, Arctic wolves' {{primarily}} prey on muskoxen and Arctic hares. They {{have also}} been found to prey on lemmings (Dicrostonyx groenlandicus), Arctic foxes (Vulpes lagopus), birds and beetles. It has been also found that Arctic wolves scavenge through garbage. This sort of food source will not always {{be found in the}} Arctic wolves diet because of regional and seasonal availability. Sometimes there is debate whether the muskox or the Arctic hare is the primary prey for the hare-wolf-muskox predator-prey <b>system.</b> <b>Studies</b> provide evidence that the muskoxen are indeed their primary prey because wolf presence and reproduction seems to be higher when muskox is more available than higher hare availability. More supporting evidence suggests that muskoxen provide long-term viability and other ungulates do not appear in wolves diet. Evidence suggesting that Arctic wolves depend more on hares claims that the mature wolf population paralleled the increase of hares rather than muskoxen availability. The study {{goes on to say that}} degree of reliance between the two sources of food is uncertain and that the amount of consumption between the two species depends on the season and year. Debate continues when seasonal and diet of young wolves is discussed. According to one study, muskox calves serve as a primary food source because the needs of pups are greater but another study suggests that [...] "when hares were much more plentiful (Mech, 2000), wolves commonly fed them to their pups during summer." [...] These differences may be attributed to location as well.|$|E
