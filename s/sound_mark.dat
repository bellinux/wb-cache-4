500|$|Stylistically, music {{journalist}} J. D. Considine {{credits the}} band for anticipating and driving the late 1990s revival of vintage analog instruments among indie rock bands. Indie rock band Pavement (who also toured with Stereolab) acknowledged the group's sound on their song [...] "Half A Canyon." [...] Stereolab alumni have also founded bands of their own. Guitarist Sean O'Hagan {{went on to}} form The High Llamas, while keyboardist Katharine Gifford created Snowpony with former My Bloody Valentine bassist Debbie Googe. Sadier herself has released three albums with her four-piece side-project Monade, whose <b>sound</b> <b>Mark</b> Jenkins called a [...] "little more Parisian" [...] than Stereolab's. Australian band Turnstyle sampled [...] "OLV 26" [...] from Emperor Tomato Ketchup on their debut album and going as far as using Andy Ramsay to mix and master their reunion album [...] "Time equals Function".|$|E

The three-track EP appeared in the top50 on the Australian Kent Music Report Singles Chart and reached No.25 on the New Zealand Singles Chart.|$|E
60|$|The dingui slided {{away from}} the ship with a very easy movement. There was just about as much wind as so small a craft needed, and Bob soon began to <b>sound,</b> <b>Mark</b> preferring to steer. It was, however, by no means easy to sound in so low a boat, while in such swift motion; and Bob was {{compelled}} to give it up. As they should be obliged to return with the oars, Mark observed that then he would feel {{his way back to}} the ship. Nevertheless, the few casts of the lead that did succeed, satisfied our mariners that there was much more than water enough for the Rancocus, between the reefs. On them, doubtless it would turn out to be different.|$|E
