25|$|OsO4 is {{a widely}} used {{staining}} agent used in transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to provide contrast to the image. As a lipid stain, it is also useful in scanning electron microscopy (SEM) {{as an alternative to}} <b>sputter</b> <b>coating.</b> It embeds a heavy metal directly into cell membranes, creating a high electron scattering rate without the need for coating the membrane with a layer of metal, which can obscure details of the cell membrane. In the staining of the plasma membrane, osmium(VIII) oxide binds phospholipid head regions, thus creating contrast with the neighbouring protoplasm (cytoplasm). Additionally, osmium(VIII) oxide is also used for fixing biological samples in conjunction with HgCl2. Its rapid killing abilities are used to quickly kill live specimens such as protozoa. OsO4 stabilizes many proteins by transforming them into gels without destroying structural features. Tissue proteins that are stabilized by OsO4 are not coagulated by alcohols during dehydration. Osmium(VIII) oxide is also used as a stain for lipids in optical microscopy. OsO4 also stains the human cornea (see safety considerations).|$|E

The mode of failure and bond interface were evaluated by SEM / EDS. RESULTS: The mean bond strength values of groups 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12 were 2. 31 MPa (± 0. 2), 24. 3 MPa (± 0. 78), 46. 94 MPa (± 1. 29), 6. 18 MPa (± 0. 98), 9. 46 MPa (± 1. 08), 15. 14 MPa (± 0. 74), 24. 84 MPa (± 1. 73), 36. 24 MPa (± 1. 43), 41. 49 MPa (± 2. 13), 49. 45 MPa (± 0. 96), 69. 36 MPa (± 0. 96), 94. 45 MPa (± 1. 51), respectively. Two-way ANOVA with Tukey multiple comparisons test was performed to determine the groups that are statistically different. All tested groups (1 - 12) showed statistically significant difference except groups 2, and 7, P< 0. 05. CONCLUSIONS: Within the limitations of this study, the following conclusions can be drawn: 1 - Surface finish significantly affects the bond strength of low fusing porcelain to Ti grade V. 2 - Larger Al 2 O 3 particle size corresponded to higher bond strengths. 3 - Sandblasting in combination with Au or TiN coatings produced the highest bond strength values. 4 - Groups 1, 4, 5, & 6 showed Adhesive failure at the ceramic – metal interface; for groups 3, 10, 11, & 12 were found to be Cohesive failure within the porcelain layers; and for groups 2, 7, 8, & 9 were found to be mixed Adhesive / Cohesive failure. 2018 - 09 - 28 T 00 : 00 : 00...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to demonstrate the ability to generate and characterize a nanometer sized aerosol using solutions, suspensions, and a bulk nanopowder, and to research the viability of using an acoustic dry aerosol generator/elutriator (ADAGE) to aerosolize a bulk nanopowder into a nanometer sized aerosol. The research compares the results from a portable scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS) to the more traditional method of counting and sizing particles on a filter sample using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Sodium chloride aerosol was used for the comparisons. The <b>sputter</b> <b>coating</b> thickness, a conductive coating necessary for SEM, was measured on different sizes of polystyrene latex spheres (PSLS). Aluminum oxide powder was aerosolized using an ADAGE and several different support membranes and sound frequency combinations were explored. A portable SMPS was used to determine the size distributions of the generated aerosols. Polycarbonate membrane (PCM) filter samples were collected for subsequent SEM analysis. The particle size distributions were determined from photographs of the membrane filters. SMPS data and membrane samples were collected simultaneously. The <b>sputter</b> <b>coating</b> thicknesses on four different sizes of PSLS, range 57 nanometers (nm) to 220 nm, were measured using transmission electron microscopy and the results from the SEM and SMPS were compared after accounting for the <b>sputter</b> <b>coating</b> thickness. Aluminum oxide nanopowder (20 nm) was aerosolized using a modified ADAGE technique. Four different support membranes and four different sound frequencies were tested with the ADAGE. The aerosol was collected onto PCM filters and the samples were examined using SEM. The results indicate that the SMPS and SEM distributions were log-normally distributed with a median diameter of approximately 42 nm and 55 nm, respectively, and geometric standard deviations (GSD) of approximately 1. 6 and 1. 7, respectively. The two methods yielded similar distributional trends with a difference in median diameters of approximately 11 - 15 nm. The <b>sputter</b> <b>coating</b> thickness on the different sizes of PSLSs ranged from 15. 4 - 17. 4 nm. The aerosols generated, using the modified ADAGE, were low in concentration. The particles remained as agglomerates and varied widely in size. An aluminum foil support membrane coupled with a high sound frequency generated the smallest agglomerates. A well characterized sodium chloride aerosol was generated and was reproducible. The distributions determined using SEM were slightly larger than those obtained from SMPS, however, the distributions had relatively the same shape as reflected in their GSDs. This suggests that a portable SMPS is a suitable method for characterizing a nanoaerosol. The sizing techniques could be compared after correcting for the effects of the <b>sputter</b> <b>coating</b> necessary for SEM examination. It was determined that the <b>sputter</b> <b>coating</b> thickness on nano-sized particles and particles up to approximately 220 nm can be expected to be the same and that the <b>sputter</b> <b>coating</b> can add considerably {{to the size of a}} nanoparticle. This has important implications for worker health where nanoaerosol exposure is a concern. The <b>sputter</b> <b>coating</b> must be considered when SEM is used to describe a nanoaerosol exposure. The performance of the modified ADAGE was less than expected. The low aerosol output from the ADAGE prevented a more detailed analysis and was limited to only a qualitative comparison. Some combinations of support membranes and sound frequencies performed better than others, particularly conductive support membranes and high sound frequencies. In conclusion, a portable SMPS yielded results similar to those obtained by SEM. The <b>sputter</b> <b>coating</b> was the same thickness on the PSLSs studied. The <b>sputter</b> <b>coating</b> thickness must be considered when characterizing nanoparticles using SEM. Finally, a conductive support membrane and higher frequencies appeared to generate the smallest agglomerates using the ADAGE technique...|$|E
