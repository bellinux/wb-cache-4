5|$|Following {{rumors of}} cast members from Beverly Hills, 90210 {{appearing}} on the spin-off, The CW confirmed that Shannen Doherty, Jennie Garth, Tori Spelling and Joe E. Tata would be returning in recurring roles as their original characters. <b>Sachs</b> was familiar with Garth, and talked to her about a possible role in the series. Garth agreed to star on the series without reading a script after brainstorming ideas with <b>Sachs.</b> The producers offered Garth a role as a series regular, but she opted to sign on as a recurring character. Doherty decided to appear after talking with <b>Sachs,</b> but her appearance {{was moved to the}} second episode. <b>Sachs</b> described Tata's casting as an accident; a friend told <b>Sachs</b> that he had seen Tata in a store, which led to the offer of a recurring role in the series. <b>Sachs</b> said that Tata was ecstatic about the idea and agreed. After reading the script, Spelling expressed interest in returning, and the writers decided to give her character her own fashion line. Spelling was scheduled to appear in the premiere, but due to personal reasons and the birth of her daughter, she opted to appear later in the season. On August 11, it was reported that Spelling had pulled out of the series after discovering that she was receiving less pay than Garth and Doherty. Spelling asked for her salary of $20,000 per episode to be increased to match their salaries—$40,000 to $50,000 per episode—but when denied she left the show altogether.|$|E

Another friend of Szilárd's, the Austrian economist Gustav Stolper, suggested approaching Alexander <b>Sachs,</b> who had access to President Franklin D.

He told Szilárd that he would deliver the letter, but suggested that it come from someone more prestigious. For Szilárd, Einstein was again the obvious choice. <b>Sachs</b> and Szilárd drafted a letter riddled with spelling errors and mailed it to Einstein.|$|E
