2500|$|Project {{management}} is {{the discipline of}} initiating, planning, executing, controlling, and closing {{the work of a}} team to achieve specific goals and meet specific <b>success</b> <b>criteria</b> at the specified time. A project is a temporary endeavor designed to produce a unique product, service or result with a defined beginning and end (usually time-constrained, and often constrained by funding or deliverable) undertaken to meet unique goals and objectives, typically to bring about beneficial change or added value. [...] The temporary nature of projects stands in contrast with business as usual (or operations), which are repetitive, permanent, or semi-permanent functional activities to produce products or services. In practice, the management of such distinct production approaches requires the development of distinct technical skills and management strategies.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: The {{definition}} of defibrillation shock "success" {{endorsed by the}} International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation {{since the publication of}} Guidelines 2000 for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Emergency Cardiac Care has been removal of ventricular fibrillation at 5 secs after shock delivery. Although this <b>success</b> <b>criterion</b> provides a direct assessment of the primary task of a shock, {{it may not be the}} only clinically useful measure of shock outcome. We evaluated a different defibrillation <b>success</b> <b>criterion</b> to determine whether it could provide additional insight into the relative performance of different defibrillation shocks. DESIGN: A randomized study comparing monophasic and biphasic waveform shocks is reported with return of organized rhythm as the primary outcome measure of defibrillation success. PATIENTS: A total of 120 patients with out-of-hospital ventricular fibrillation as the first recorded rhythm were treated with defibrillation with automated external defibrillators. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Return of organized rhythm (two QRS complexes, < 5 secs apart, < 60 secs after defibrillation) was achieved in 31 monophasic shock (45 %) and 35 biphasic shock (69 %) patients (relative risk, 1. 53, 95 % confidence interval, 1. 11 - 2. 10). Logistic regression analysis revealed that shock waveform was the strongest independent predictor of return of organized rhythm (odds ratio, 4. 0; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 67 - 10. 0). Defibrillation success with the conventional International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation criterion was very high (91 % and 98 %, respectively) and not significantly different between groups. CONCLUSIONS: Return of organized rhythm proved to be a more sensitive measure of relative defibrillation shock performance than the conventional shock <b>success</b> <b>criterion.</b> Inclusion of return of organized rhythm as an end point in future clinical research could help discern more subtle defibrillation shock effects and contribute to further optimization of defibrillation technolog...|$|R
30|$|The trial <b>success</b> <b>criterion</b> was > 30  % {{reduction}} in mean target fibroid perfused volume at 3  months {{in at least}} 50  % of patients. This <b>success</b> <b>criterion</b> stems from the MR-guided focused ultrasound data of Stewart and colleagues, which found that sustained relief of fibroid symptoms up to 24  months is associated with nonperfused volume ratios > 20  % after hyperthermic ablation [15]. Initially, it was not known if total fibroid volume would be significantly reduced at that early time point, which was the rationale for using {{reduction in}} perfused fibroid volume (measured via contrast-enhanced MRI) as the primary endpoint as opposed to reduction in total fibroid volume. In the FAST-EU Trial, contrast-enhanced MRI demonstrated significant mean reductions at 3  months in both the volume of perfused fibroid tissue {{as well as in}} total fibroid volume at 3  months (68.1 and 54.7  %, respectively). At 12  months, patients demonstrated significant reductions (67.4 and 66.6  %, respectively) in mean perfused and total fibroid volumes. It has been previously demonstrated that hyperthermic ablation of > 20  % of a fibroid may provide sustained relief from fibroid symptoms [15].|$|R

DCH is considered resolved if the conditional containment failure probability (CCFP) is less than 0. 1. Loads versus strength evaluations of the CCFP were performed for each plant using plant-specific information. The DCH issue is considered resolved for a plant if a screening phase results in a CCFP less than 0. 01, which is more stringent than the overall <b>success</b> <b>criterion.</b> If the screening phase CCFP for a plant is greater than 0. 01, then refined containment loads evaluations must be performed and/or the probability of high pressure at vessel breach must be analyzed.
