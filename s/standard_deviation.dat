5|$|The current fifth {{edition of}} the Stanford–Binet scales (SB5) was {{developed}} by Gale H. Roid and published in 2003 by Riverside Publishing. Unlike scoring on previous versions of the Stanford–Binet test, SB5 IQ scoring is deviation scoring in which each <b>standard</b> <b>deviation</b> up or down from the norming sample median score is 15 points from the median score, IQ 100, just like the standard scoring on the Wechsler tests.|$|E
5|$|The fourth {{revision}} of the Stanford–Binet scales (S-B IV) was developed by Thorndike, Hagen, and Sattler and published by Riverside Publishing in 1986. It retained the deviation scoring of the third revision with each <b>standard</b> <b>deviation</b> from the median being defined as a 16 IQ point difference. The S-B IV adopted new classification terminology. After this test was published, psychologist Nathan Brody lamented that IQ tests had still not caught up with advances in research on human intelligence during the twentieth century.|$|E
5|$|The Differential Ability Scales Second Edition (DAS–II) was {{developed}} by Colin D. Elliott and published in 2007 by Psychological Corporation. The DAS-II is a test battery given individually to children, normed for children from ages two years and six months through seventeen years and eleven months. It was normed on 3,480 noninstitutionalized, English-speaking children in that age range. The DAS-II yields a General Conceptual Ability (GCA) score scaled like an IQ score with the median standard score set at 100 and 15 standard score points for each <b>standard</b> <b>deviation</b> up or down from the median. The lowest possible GCA score on DAS–II is 44, and the highest is 175.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{scattering of}} the GPS site coor dinates and baseline length changes using daily GEONET solutions. We first calculated baseline length changes {{from the daily}} coordinates, and then calculated their <b>standard</b> <b>deviations</b> every tendays. The <b>standard</b> <b>deviations,</b> which are small in winter and large in summer, clearly show seasonal variations. Another characteristics is that the <b>standard</b> <b>deviations</b> are dependent on the baseline length. These facts suggested that uncorrected water vapor effects affected on {{the accuracy of the}} GEONET solutions. The <b>standard</b> <b>deviations</b> of both baseline length and ellipsoidal height show some dependency on the GEONET station IDs, which are related to the year of establishment and the region of the sites. The <b>standard</b> <b>deviations</b> before 1996 are larger than those after 1996. Theyare small near Tsukuba, and are generally large in western Japan compared with eastern Japan. Spatial pattern of the <b>standard</b> <b>deviations</b> at the sites of Trimble receivers seems to have a relation with the regional administration boundaries. This may suggest that environments of observation points or differences of the installation methods affect on the accuracy...|$|R
50|$|When N = 100, Samuelson's {{inequality}} {{states that}} {{all members of}} the sample lie within approximately 9.9499 <b>standard</b> <b>deviations</b> of the mean: Chebyshev's states that 99% of the sample lies within 10 <b>standard</b> <b>deviations</b> of the mean.|$|R
25|$|Use of {{the sample}} <b>standard</b> <b>deviation</b> implies that these 14 fulmars are a sample from a larger {{population}} of fulmars. If these 14 fulmars comprised the entire population (perhaps the last 14 surviving fulmars), then instead {{of the sample}} <b>standard</b> <b>deviation,</b> the calculation would use the population <b>standard</b> <b>deviation.</b> In the population <b>standard</b> <b>deviation</b> formula, the denominator is N instead of N-1. It is rare that measurements can be taken for an entire population, so, by default, statistical software packages calculate the sample <b>standard</b> <b>deviation.</b> Similarly, journal articles report the sample <b>standard</b> <b>deviation</b> unless otherwise specified.|$|E
25|$|When only {{a sample}} of data from a {{population}} is available, the term <b>standard</b> <b>deviation</b> of the sample or sample <b>standard</b> <b>deviation</b> can refer to either the above-mentioned quantity as applied to those data or to a modified quantity that is an unbiased estimate of the population <b>standard</b> <b>deviation</b> (the <b>standard</b> <b>deviation</b> of the entire population).|$|E

30|$|These sample <b>standard</b> <b>deviations</b> are {{downward}} biased {{unless the}} stock of immigrants from all countries in each grouped observation is the same; the underestimation of the true <b>standard</b> <b>deviations</b> will be larger the larger the (unobserved) dispersion within each grouped observation.|$|R
25|$|A large <b>standard</b> <b>deviation</b> {{indicates}} that the data points can spread far from the mean and a small <b>standard</b> <b>deviation</b> {{indicates that}} they are clustered closely around the mean.|$|E

25|$|In statistics, the <b>standard</b> <b>deviation</b> (SD, also {{represented}} by the Greek letter sigma σ or the Latin letter s) is a measure {{that is used to}} quantify the amount of variation or dispersion of a set of data values. A low <b>standard</b> <b>deviation</b> indicates that the data points tend to be close to the mean (also called the expected value) of the set, while a high <b>standard</b> <b>deviation</b> indicates that the data points are spread out over a wider range of values.|$|E
50|$|To {{use as a}} {{test for}} {{outliers}} or a normality test, one computes the size of deviations in terms of <b>standard</b> <b>deviations,</b> and compares this to expected frequency. Given a sample set, one can compute the studentized residuals and compare these to the expected frequency: points that fall more than 3 <b>standard</b> <b>deviations</b> from the norm are likely outliers (unless the sample size is significantly large, by which point one expects a sample this extreme), {{and if there are}} many points more than 3 <b>standard</b> <b>deviations</b> from the norm, one likely has reason to question the assumed normality of the distribution. This holds ever more strongly for moves of 4 or more <b>standard</b> <b>deviations.</b>|$|R
25|$|In {{practical}} usage, {{in contrast}} to the 68–95–99.7 rule, which applies to normal distributions, Chebyshev's inequality is weaker, stating that a minimum of just 75% of values must lie within two <b>standard</b> <b>deviations</b> of the mean and 89% within three <b>standard</b> <b>deviations.</b>|$|R
50|$|The results using {{statistical}} {{controls to}} control for demographic and baseline state test scores found a positive effect among charter schools similar to a year spent in one of Boston's selective exam schools, with math scores, for instance, showing positive effects of 0.18 and 0.22 <b>standard</b> <b>deviations</b> for charter {{middle and high schools}} respectively compared to an effect of 0.20 and 0.16 <b>standard</b> <b>deviations</b> for exam schools. For pilot schools, the report found that in the middle school grades pilot school students modestly underperform relative to similar students attending traditional BPS schools (-0.05 <b>standard</b> <b>deviations</b> in ELA and -0.07 in math) while showing slightly positive results in the high school grades for pilot schools (0.15 <b>standard</b> <b>deviations</b> for writing and 0.06 for math).|$|R
25|$|A useful {{property}} of the <b>standard</b> <b>deviation</b> is that, unlike the variance, it is expressed in the same units as the data. There are also other measures of deviation from the norm, including average absolute deviation, which provide different mathematical properties from <b>standard</b> <b>deviation.</b>|$|E
25|$|The use of {{the term}} n−1 is called Bessel's correction, and it is also used in sample {{covariance}} and the sample <b>standard</b> <b>deviation</b> (the square root of variance). The square root is a concave function and thus introduces negative bias (by Jensen's inequality), which depends on the distribution, and thus the corrected sample <b>standard</b> <b>deviation</b> (using Bessel's correction) is biased. The unbiased estimation of <b>standard</b> <b>deviation</b> is a technically involved problem, though for the normal distribution using the term n−1.5 yields an almost unbiased estimator.|$|E

25|$|In {{the case}} of {{normally}} distributed data, the three sigma rule means that roughly 1 in 22 observations will differ by twice the <b>standard</b> <b>deviation</b> or more from the mean, and 1 in 370 will deviate by three times the <b>standard</b> <b>deviation.</b> In a sample of 1000 observations, the presence of up to five observations deviating from the mean by {{more than three times}} the <b>standard</b> <b>deviation</b> is within the range of what can be expected, being less than twice the expected number and hence within 1 <b>standard</b> <b>deviation</b> of the expected number – see Poisson distribution – and not indicate an anomaly.
