40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to study and model the performance of <b>superfinish</b> hard turned surfaces in rolling contact fatigue. The rolling contact fatigue is first modeled by taking into account the residual stresses generated by the hard turning process. Then, micro-hardness along with residual stresses produced were used for modeling. ^ Results show that changing the cutting conditions will change the residual stresses and the micro-hardness produced and consequently change the fatigue life. Within the range of this study, it is shown that changing the cutting parameters will change the fatigue life by a factor of 40 times. It was also shown that high speeds and/or large flank wear will result in structural changes known as white layer, the presence of which was shown to drastically decrease the fatigue life. Moreover, it is shown that the rolling contact fatigue life of <b>superfinish</b> hard turned surfaces has a highly consistent repeatability as compared with ground surfaces. Finally, it is shown that hard turning results in softening the surface layers to varying degrees depending on the cutting conditions. ^ In modeling the rolling contact fatigue life of the <b>superfinish</b> hard turned surfaces, first, the residual stresses were superimposed on the service stresses due to the loading, and then the fatigue life was modeled using the maximum equivalent stress (Von-Mises). It is shown that including the residual stress in the fatigue life model gives better prediction than that obtained by the maximum Hertzian stress which does not account for the residual stresses. Moreover, the inclusion of the maximum equivalent stress, its location and the volume-at-risk gives better results than using the maximum equivalent stress alone. The fact that the above models could not accurately predict the rolling contact fatigue life, prompted the author to include the micro-hardness distributions along with the residual stress distributions. The author used Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics to develop a model that includes loading, residual stresses, and micro-hardness. The predicted lives using this model were found to correlate very well with the experimental data. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{introduction}} of high performance grinding machines {{in combination with}} the latest superabrasive technology has the potential to impact significantly on existing process chains. The aim of the research was to look at both the high and low rate removal grinding processes and their effects on the surface integrity, as a means to exploit the above technologies. A major objective was to determine the feasibility of High Efficiency Deep Grinding (HEDG) in cylindrical plunge grinding. HEDG is a high speed removal process which differs from conventional forms of grinding in that it uses large depths of cut together with high feedrates. Together, these changes affect the thermal energy partitioning within the work zone. Through this work an understanding of the process conditions enabled the development of this process, such that prevention of thermal damage to the finished workpiece surface is achievable. At the opposite extreme to the high material removal rates of HEDG, kvdrk was carried out in the high precision finish grinding regime. Developments *ere undertaken to look at the implementation of a modified path into the normal cylindrical plunge grinding action, in a process referred to as <b>Superfinish</b> Grinding. The aim of this process being to demonstrate an improvement to the surface texture primarily through a reduction in grinding directionality. Surface integrity is an important consideration in the development of any grinding process. Damage as a result of grinding is predominately of a thermal nature and results in changes to the material properties in the near surface region. One such change is the residual stress, which was measured using Barkhausen Noise intensity instrumentation, which provided a reliable early indication to a build up in thermal energy. Developments in thermal modelling supported by temperature measurements provided {{a better understanding of the}} HEDG regime. The model employed new energy partitioning theories together with circular arc modelling of conditions along the contact length. A model was derived to predict the surface finish produced with the <b>Superfinish</b> Grinding approach, this again provided an increased understanding of the grinding process. Industrial trials have shown how HEDG can be implemented on standard production machine tools for the cylindrical plunge grinding of crankshaft components. The process demonstrated the potential for improved surface integrity, whilst maintaining surface finish and form accuracy. The same grinding machine was also used to generate high quality surfaces using a <b>Superfinish</b> Grinding process. Roughness values of the order of 0. 11 um RQ were routinely obtained exhibiting reduced levels of grinding directionality. Thus, using a single machine tool and a single set-up, exceptionally high stock removal rates are achievable in a roughing cycle followed by superfinishing to generate the required surface characteristics and profile.

40|$|The {{interaction}} of three bio-lubricant base oil candidates with seventeen combinations of surface treatment was studied, comparing wear scar volumes and {{coefficient of friction}} results. Substrates were initially ground, then a combination of superfinished, Dymon-iC™ DLC, an impact technique of ultra-fine shot blasting method doped with Tin and Molybdenum Disulfide, a calcium based chemical dip containing calcium sulfate and nano fullerene, were used. DLC is well reported to reduce friction. Some reports suggest wear in coated contacts is independent {{of the type of}} lubricant used, whilst others report that bio-lubricants offer reduced friction and wear in combination with DLC. Shot blasting can also reduce wear and friction, due to the surface dimples acting as lubricant reservoirs, making hydrodynamic lubrication more likely. Previous work has also explored the performance of surface texturing in combination with coatings, some reporting higher friction when surface texturing and DLC is used. As a surface coating, fullerene has been shown to have significantly lower wear and friction than DLC coatings. The calcium based chemical treatment used has no published data. A ball on flat reciprocating wear tester was used with bio-lubricant base oil candidates, jojoba and soybean oil, with a mineral base oil used for comparison. Wear scars were analysed using a scanning electron microscope. Coefficient of friction results from testing with bio-lubricant base oil candidates’ soybean and jojoba oil were lower than tests with mineral base oil. A hybridized coating combination of <b>superfinish,</b> diamond like carbon and chemical dip gave the highest wear protection for tests with the mineral base oil and bio-lubricant base oil candidate soybean oil.

40|$|AbstractSuperfinishing {{is one of}} the {{techniques}} ensuring a very low value of surface roughness of the most common external assets. The roughness of the obtained surfaces depends on the proper selection of the abrasive material and processing parameters. Yield in <b>superfinish</b> machining with oscillating tool depends largely on the kinematics of the oscillating movement trajectory. The paper presents the superfinishing control system based on frequency control strategy of the oscillating motion. System was developed to study the process of the controlled oscillation frequency of a grinding tool. Frequency control was enabled by the use of an inverter which provided input to the motor that drives the oscillating head. A system for automatic frequency control of the oscillating motion using computer was developed. The inverter was connected via an analog to digital interface to a PC. Dedicated control software in Visual Basic was made for this purpose. Therefore, a single system for controlling a two-stage superfinishing process has been created. This ensured quality implementation of the optimal well-known method for processing. The presented control system provides wide possibilities for control of the surface grinding, and creates opportunities for further research in determining optimal grinding conditions...|$|E
