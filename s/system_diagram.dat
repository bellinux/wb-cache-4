Some of the earliest systems of this type were used by Ferrari in F1. Another well-known application {{of this type of}} anti-lag system was in the WRC version of the 1995 Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution III and Toyota Celica GT-Four (ST205). Brass tubes fed air from the turbocharger's Compressor Bypass Valve (CBV) to each of the exhaust manifold tracts, in order to provide the necessary air for the combustion of the fuel. The system was controlled by two pressure valves, operated by the ECU. Besides the racing version, the hardware of the anti-lag system was also installed in the 2500 [...] "Group A homologation base WRC method car" [...] street legal Celica GT-Fours. However, in these cars the system was disabled and inactive. The tubes and valves were only present for homologation reasons.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} an emergy analysis in biomass cogeneration. Emergy analysis {{have been made}} for the power plant which is located in Latvia. The aim of emergy analysis is to evaluate the amount of solar emergy used in energy production. Emergy is the availability of energy (exergy) that is consumed in direct and indirect transformations required to make a product or service. The unit of emergy is solar emjoule (seJ). To calculate emergy, transformity is used to express energy units in to solar emjoules. To express other units into emergy, specific emergy, emergy per unit money, emergy per unit labor is used. Empower is defined as flow of emergy. A part of emergy analysis is the <b>system</b> <b>diagram.</b> The <b>system</b> <b>diagram</b> helps to show main inputs, outputs, components and flows between them. The <b>system</b> <b>diagram</b> of cogeneration plant is shown in figure. Several inputs as renewable, non-renewable, labour and economical have been taken in account in emergy analysis. <b>System</b> <b>diagram</b> shows main flows between inputs and components of the system. All inputs and outputs are converted in emjoules. Finally, emergy indicators such as renewable fraction, emergy yield ratio, emergy sustainability index, etc. are calculated...|$|E
