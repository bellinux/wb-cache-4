For embryos treated in utero 24 hr prior to dissection, DNA, RNA, and protein levels were significantly lower at the beginning of cultivation and after 24 hr in culture.

40|$|It has {{recently}} been demonstrated that arsenic induces overexpression of keratinocyte-derived growth factors, which {{are likely to have}} a significant role in arsenic-induced skin hyperkeratoses and cancer.

The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the early intracellular events that follow in[*]vitro treatment with <b>sodium</b> <b>arsenate</b> in a murine keratinocyte cell line (HEL 30), which leads to cytokine overproduction. First, we observed that <b>sodium</b> <b>arsenate</b> induced a concentration-dependent production of interleukin- 1 α and a significant increase in cell proliferation, that could be suppressed by the addition of a neutralizing antibody against murine interleukin- 1 α, confirming the ability of arsenic to induce keratinocyte growth-promoting cytokines. Electron microscopic analysis revealed that arsenate induced a dramatic alteration in keratinocyte mitochondria. This effect could be prevented by rotenone pretreatment, which suggests the possible involvement of mitochondria-derived reactive oxygen species. Arsenic induced a concentration- and time-dependent increase in cellular oxidative activity, which was followed by activation of redox-sensitive transcription factors such as nuclear factor-κB and activator protein- 1, that are essential for interleukin- 1 α synthesis. Prior treatment with rotenone or prolonged treatment with ethidium bromide, an inhibitor of mitochondrial DNA and RNA synthesis, to deplete cells of functional mitochondria, completely prevented sodium arsenate-induced interleukin- 1 α production, this indicates the pivotal role of these organelles in sodium arsenate-induced keratinocyte growth factors...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} various {{metabolic}} inhibitors on the motility of Spirochaeta aurantia were investigated. After 15 min in <b>sodium</b> <b>arsenate</b> buffer, 90 % of cells remained motile even though adenosine triphosphate levels dropped from 5. 6 to 0. 1 nmol/mg (dry weight) of cells. After 70 min in <b>sodium</b> <b>arsenate,</b> 5 % of cells were motile. Addition of phenazine methosulfate plus ascorbate {{at this time}} resulted in motility of 95 % of cells, but adenosine triphosphate levels remained at 0. 1 nmol/mg of cell dry weight. Carbonyl cyanide-m-chlorophenyl hydrazone rapidly (within 1 min) and completely inhibited motility of metabolizing cells in potassium phosphate buffer. However, after 15 min {{in the presence of}} carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone the cellular adenosine triphosphate level was 3. 4 nmol/mg (dry weight) of cells, and the rate of oxygen uptake was 44 % of the rate measured in the absence of carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone. Cells remained motile under conditions where either the electrical potential or the pH gradient across the membrane of S. aurantia was dissipated. However, if both gradients were simultaneously dissipated, motility was rapidly inhibited. This study indicates that a proton motive force, in the form of either a transmembrane electrical potential or a transmembrane pH gradient, is required for motility in S. aurantia. Adenosine triphosphate does not appear to directly activate the motility system in this spirochete...|$|E
