40|$|Few of the {{empirical}} studies on school restructuring adequately describe {{the role of}} <b>site</b> <b>teams</b> in school reform. This paper addresses this gap, an analysis of what <b>site</b> <b>teams</b> do, how they are configured, and how they operate. This paper presents empirical measures of variables relating to the decision-making and communication practices engaged in by site-based teams and uses these variables in a model to predict significant outcomes of site-based decision making. The paper reports {{the results of a}} study that used path analysis to test the relationship among resources provided to site councils and analyze communication and decision-making practices and perceived outcomes. The study's sample includes data from site-based council members in 50 schools in New York State. The results, with respect to the support factors that are identified in the study, suggest that the devolution of power from traditional authorities to site-based teams, which is intended with school-site management, may result in the enhanced influence of these <b>teams.</b> What <b>site</b> <b>teams</b> do with this influence, whether it results in better decision-making or improvement in teaching and learning, depends on what happens at the school site and on how the site-based teams practice site-based decision-making.

5000|$|On {{the basis}} of the college's {{self-study}} report, the <b>site</b> <b>team's</b> visit, the <b>site</b> <b>team's</b> report, documents from previous evaluations, and evidence of student learning and achievement, the nineteen-member Commission determines the accreditation status of the college. It announces this status to the college in an action letter and to the public through ACCJC announcements. This action letter also lists the Commission's [...] "official" [...] recommendations. For a college seeking reaffirmation, there are in general two possibilities. The ACCJC can reaffirm the college's accreditation, or it can sanction the college. The sanctions are of three kinds: Warning, Probation, and Show Cause. If sanctioned, the college maintains its accreditation, but the ACCJC withholds reaffirmation until the college addresses the matters that led to sanction. The ACCJC will also require the sanctioned college to provide one or more follow-up reports to confirm that it is in fact fulfilling the Commission's recommendations. Often the ACCJC will also require follow-up site visits. Very rarely does the ACCJC terminate a college's accreditation.|$|R

Comprised of district-level and school-level leaders, the purpose of the teams was to work together to improve student achievement. Using a quasi-experimental design, two elementary schools, two middle schools, and three high schools served as experimental schools whose improvements in achievements were measured using the English/Language Arts portion of the California Standards Test for grades 2 - 11. Improvement rates at each school were compared to improvements at control schools. The duration of the intervention at experimental schools ranged from 2 to 5 years. Qualitative data taken from surveys of teachers at two schools and interviews of 10 <b>Site</b> Support <b>Team</b> members were used to help interpret the quantitative portion of this study. <b>Site</b> Support <b>Teams</b> were found to be a successful tool in assisting schools to improve student achievement when several features were present: sustained focus, teacher involvement, classroom visitations, and mutual accountability...|$|R

40|$|Education Reform has legislated school {{governance}} councils to promote site-based decision making. School {{teams have been}} suggested in special education as a pre-referral resource and assistance to teachers working with special needs students. Cross-constituent groups must be brought together to restructure schools and provide instructional support. The site-based teams require evaluation. Several performance activities, variables, and levels of training and support have been suggested in studies from states where there have been attempts to implement site-based decision making. Few of these reports have attempted to quantify the activities and variables suggested for team functioning. Through a thorough literature review of the subject and an extensive survey of <b>site</b> <b>teams</b> {{in the public schools}} in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, a set of team activities and variables was identified and quantified by the author. The collected data was utilized to develop an evaluation instrument. The resulting questionnaire was administrated to evaluators and team members of school <b>site</b> <b>teams.</b> A statistical analysis was performed to assess the significance of these performance descriptors in estimating the overall functioning of school <b>site</b> <b>teams.</b> The results of the statistical analysis and literature review provide the immediate supervisor with a set of variables to gain insight in the assessment of team functioning. These results {{can also be used to}} develop a self-assessment instrument to enhance team functioning. The model developed by the author can be generalized to management settings other than education. Customization of the evaluation tool is suggested as a means for future application of this study. The results of the research focus on the importance of team process and group dynamics, as well as specific product variables germane to the organization in the development of an evaluation instrument that can be used to assess overall team functioning. ...|$|R
