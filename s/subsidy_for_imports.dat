40|$|Today the {{broadest}} possible {{interpretation of the}} concept of "subsidy," counting any state intervention that leads to a reduction in prices compared to the level that would exist under free market conditions as a subsidy, is commonly accepted. Proceeding from this concept, the amounts of tax concessions for energy producers, state investments, customs duties on exported (or <b>subsidies</b> <b>for</b> <b>imported)</b> energy, the nontariff regulation of foreign trade (by setting quotas for the export or import of fuel and energy), and favorable rates for the transportation of energy resources, along with the direct regulation of prices, can then all be considered subsidies to the energy sector. Many countries artificially maintain low prices for energy through direct <b>subsidies</b> <b>for</b> producers. The amount of energy subsidies around the world in 1987 was estimated to be approximately $ 230 billion (20 - 25 percent {{of the value of the}} fuel resources consumed at world market prices). The elimination of all subsidies would be a condition of declines in the production of energy, and would lead to a 9 percent reduction in the emission of carbon into the atmosphere, provided world price levels for energy remained unchanged. >sup> 1 >/sup> The most significant energy subsidies existed in the USSR. Thus, in 1987, according to the calculations of B. Larsen and A. Shah, it had 75 percent of all energy subsidies and 18. 4 percent of world carbon emissions (second in the world after the United States). ...|$|R
5000|$|During the 1960s and 70s many {{countries}} in Africa provided subsidized fertilizer to their farmers though state owned enterprises, or [...] "parastatals," [...] which generally enjoyed a monopoly on fertilizer distribution and import within the country. The fertilizer distributed by these enterprises sold at a universally reduced price, between 20 and 60 percent of the full market cost. Currency over-valuation also created an additional [...] "implicit" [...] <b>subsidy</b> <b>for</b> <b>imported</b> fertilizer. These policies were seen {{as a way to}} counteract the effects of soil erosion and depletion, and increase crop yields by bringing fertilizer within the reach of subsistence farmers. [...] This followed the dominant ‘modernization’ model of the period, which aimed to develop production systems in the sector through the promotion of new technologies like fertilizer and improved hybrid seeds. [...] The subsidy programs often suffered from multiple problems. Inefficient bureaucracies contributed to delays in fertilizer delivery. Overstaffing and lack of efficiency incentives increased overall program costs. In cases of inadequate budgets, fertilizer was rationed, barring farmers from accessing sufficient amounts to apply to their crops. Finally, below market-level pricing disincentivized and displaced private distributors of fertilizer who no longer found it economically feasible to compete with subsidized fertilizer. This seriously jeopardized the financial sustainability of the programs.|$|R
40|$|Abstract:- Fossil fuels {{have the}} {{greatest}} share in energy supply of the world demand. Regarding to their limited resources, fuel consumption management and energy planning in the end-user sectors is a great matter of importance. Among the fossil fuels, gasoline is the main fuel for light duty vehicles. In Iran, fuel consumption, especially gasoline, has increased sharply (growth rate of 10. 2 % for the year 2006 in comparison with year 2005) {{and has become a}} big crisis in the recent years. On the other hand, enormous <b>subsidies</b> <b>for</b> <b>importing</b> 40 % of domestic demand that have reached to more than 10 billion US $ are not tolerable for the government. In this study, we have assessed the gasoline consumption, production, imports and prices; reviewed main causes of tremendous growth rate of consumption, current conservation policies and their advantages or disadvantages (SWOT analysis) and proposed short to long term solutions and strategies for efficient gasoline consumption management. Finally, current and proposed solutions and strategies have been analyzed and evaluated. The conclusions suggest strongly not only that the low price of motor gasoline, but also mass production of vehicles with conventional technology likewise affect motor gasoline demand. A second conclusion is that gasoline crisis in Iran has no popular solution and fundamental strategies and policies are needed to solve the problem...|$|R

Regarding the limited natural resources, fuel consumption management and energy planning in the end-user sectors are two great matters of importance. Among the fossil fuels, gasoline is the principal fuel for light-duty vehicles. In Iran, fuel consumption, especially that of gasoline, has increased sharply with {{the growth rate of}} 10. 2 % for the year 2006 in comparison with that in 2005, turning into a big crisis in the recent years. On the other hand, enormous <b>subsidies</b> <b>for</b> <b>importing</b> 40 % of domestic demands, which have reached more than 10 billion US$, are too much to be supplied. In this study, we have assessed the gasoline consumption, production, import and prices; reviewed main causes of the tremendous growth rate of consumption, current conservation policies and their advantages or disadvantages (SWOT analysis); proposed short- to long-term solutions and strategies for efficient gasoline consumption management; and finally, current strategies and proposed solutions are analyzed and evaluated. A foregone conclusion strongly suggests that not only the low price of motor gasoline but also mass production of vehicles with the conventional technology, likewise, affects motor gasoline demand. A second conclusion is that gasoline crisis in Iran has no straight solution, and that fundamental strategies and policies are needed to solve the problem. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to analyze and determine the main important factors affecting production in feed processing mills in the Kingdom. 	The research was based on cross section data for thirty five feed processing factories operating in the year 1413 H. Both descriptive and quantitative methods were utilized. Estimation of the production function parameters relied mainly on multiple regression analysis with double-logarithmic form. 	Results showed that: (1) The most important factors affecting the production of processed feed were as follows; the maximum production capacity for the feed mill, labor, and the government <b>subsidy</b> <b>for</b> the <b>imported</b> raw materials, namely, corn and soybean. (2) Elasticity of production was estimated at 0. 503, 0. 204, and 0. 436 for the maximum capacity, labor and government subsidy, respectively. The value of marginal products was calculated at SR 435, 625, and 508 respectively for the above-identified factors of production. (3) Results indicated that there was an increasing return to scale in feed processing industry, which imply the potentiality of increasing efficiency of production in the processed feed industry...|$|R
5000|$|The {{outbreak}} of World War II put {{the economy of}} British Guiana {{into a state of}} decline, due to a decrease in trading activities, which initially led to a rise in unemployment. The war also resulted in a shortage of imported goods from Britain and North America, since many merchant ships were now being utilised for military transport. The effects of the shortage of imported goods were felt throughout the country. For example, there were no new bicycle tires or inner tubes, so owners of bicycles had to improvise by using discarded pieces of rubber to patch holes in existing tires. There was also a severe scarcity of flour and petrol for vehicles, and kerosene for domestic use was rationed. The government controlled the prices of goods, especially food items, and provided <b>subsidies</b> <b>for</b> necessary <b>imports.</b> However, the people quickly readjusted to the situation and there was no serious lack of food since Guianese farmers produced large quantities of food crops, including rice, cassava, plantains, sweet potatoes and eddoes, as well as vegetables.|$|R
40|$|This article {{assesses the}} main welfare {{implications}} of US policies to support biofuels, {{with an emphasis}} on corn-based ethanol. The analysis relies on an open economy, multimarket equilibrium model that links world and domestic energy and agricultural markets and explicitly accounts for the externalities of carbon emissions. The first-best policy in our context entails a carbon tax (implemented with a tax on fuel and a <b>subsidy</b> <b>for</b> ethanol), an <b>import</b> tariff on oil, and an export tax on corn. Although this policy is likely not feasible, we show that a second- best policy with an optimally chosen fuel tax and ethanol subsidy can approximate fairly closely the welfare gains associated with the first-best policy. The largest welfare gains to the US economy from first- and second-best policies arise from their impact on the terms of trade, particularly in the oil market...|$|R
