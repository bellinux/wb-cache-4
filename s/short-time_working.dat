40|$|Abstract. The role of {{expectation}} in listening and composing music has drawn much attention in music cognition since {{about half a}} century ago. In this paper, we provide a first attempt to model some aspects of musi-cal expectation specifically pertained to <b>short-time</b> and <b>working</b> memo-ries, in an anticipatory framework. In our proposition Anticipation is the mental realization of possible predicted actions and their effect on {{the perception of the}} world at an instant in time. We demonstrate the model in applications to automatic improvisation and style imitation. The pro-posed model, based on cognitive foundations of musical expectation, is an active model using reinforcement learning techniques with multiple agents that learn competitively and in collaboration. We show that com-pared to similar models, this anticipatory framework needs little training data and demonstrate complex musical behavior such as long-term plan-ning and formal shapes {{as a result of the}} anticipatory architecture. We provide sample results and discuss further research. ...|$|R

50|$|When {{an economy}} is strong, most {{business}} leaders focus on revenue growth. During periods of weakness, when demand {{for good and}} services is curbed, the focus shifts to cost-cutting. In-keeping with this tendency, recessions initially provoke aggressive (and somes panic-ridden) actions such as deep discounting, fire sales of excess inventory, wage freezes, <b>short-time</b> <b>working,</b> and abandonment of former supplier relationships in favor of less costly supplies. Although such actions may be necessary and prudent, their impact may be short-lived. Lean IT can expect to garner support during economic downturns as business leaders seek initiatives that deliver more enduring value than is achievable through reactive and generalized cost-cutting.|$|E

40|$|With the {{introduction}} of the Employment Promotion Act (GDR) on 01. 07. 1990, <b>short-time</b> <b>working</b> benefit was put to use as an employment and training measure in eastern Germany, too.

40|$|The study {{provides}} an empirical {{analysis of the}} effects of cyclical fluctuations - including those of the current economic crisis - on revenues and expenditures of the German public pay-as-you-go pension system on the one hand. On the other hand the pension reforms of the most recent decade are scrutinised in terms of their repercussions on the business cycle. Special emphasis is placed on the gradual reduction of the public pension level and the subsidisation of private fully funded so-called "Riester" pension schemes. For the analysis the authors develop an econometric model of the public pension system and integrate it into the IMK's existing macro model of the German economy. The analysis shows several weaknesses of the current public pension formula. Firstly, it should not include the effects of <b>short-time</b> <b>working</b> on the aggregate of gross wages and salaries per employee. Otherwise the current extensive use of <b>short-time</b> <b>working</b> to avoid unemployment will first reduce pensions and then raise them again. Secondly, the time lag between cyclical changes and their repercussions on the expenditures of the pension system could be further increased to improve the stabilising effects of the pension system on the business cycle. And thirdly, the pension system's provisions for revenue fluctuations should be raised in order to avoid increasing contributions in a severe and protracted crisis. A separate section of the study deals with the cyclical effects of private households' increased savings for old age. To a significant extent the increase of the savings ratio since the beginning of this decade is due to the "Riester" reforms and has retarded growth and employment. ...|$|E

30|$|Hijzen and Venn (2011) {{provide a}} {{cross-country}} {{study of the}} change in employment and average hours in relation to the take-up of short-time work during the recent recession. Of the 19 countries examined over 2003 Q 1 - 2009 Q 3, some had short-time work arrangements before the crisis, some adopted them and others did not. After controlling for the intensity of the recession, they estimate that countries with a <b>short-time</b> <b>working</b> scheme experienced a significantly more muted reduction in permanent employment. There is also evidence that average hours worked by permanent employees fell more in countries with short-time work arrangements. Hijzen and Venn (2011) show that the availability of short-time work arrangements cannot explain the different response of employment and average hours worked for temporary employees. However, the reduction in employment was considerably larger for temporary employees than for permanent employees in both sets of countries.|$|E
30|$|More {{implicit}} policies {{take the}} form of widespread understandings that certain principles will be followed in cases of redundancy or <b>short-time</b> <b>working,</b> such as tacit understandings that women, or immigrants, or very old workers will have the weakest claims to tenure. Anti-discrimination and equal opportunities legislation has often restricted the scope for such explicit practices. Nevertheless, demographic distinctions might produce implicit distinctions. For example, workers of different ages, ethnicities, genders might be typically found working for sub-contractors rather than in leading firms themselves. Use can also be made of illegal workers (usually illegal immigrants) in order to concentrate insecurity in particular groups and provide reassurance to others. All such cases of distinction between secure and insecure workers enable core workers to remain confident consumers while labour markets become flexible, but at the expense of potentially low confidence among the outsiders. The sustainability of these practices may depend on support from other CLCs to which insecure categories of workers might belong. This topic will therefore appear again below.|$|E

However, the increased pressure for the flexibilisation of working time, wage-setting and employment conditions may give rise to a trend towards ‘disorganised’ decentralisation of collective bargaining. Thus, it is vital that trade unions ensure that deviations from collective agreements are applied only temporarily in companies encountering economic difficulties. Furthermore, increased efforts by trade unions to coordinate their bargaining policies across borders are of particular importance in order to counter downward pressures on wages and working standards. Lastly, the role of the state is decisive in providing the preconditions for inclusive and effective collective bargaining and encompassing tripartite structures to involve social partners in public policy-making...|$|E

40|$|This article {{discusses}} crisis-related {{developments in}} collective bargaining {{in the private}} sector across the EU since the onset of the crisis during 2008. It analyses developments in the incidence, procedures and content of collective bargaining during the crisis and is cross-nationally and cross-sectorally comparative.

The article shows that collective bargaining responses to the crisis have been much more frequent in multi-employer bargaining systems than in single-employer bargaining systems, both at sectoral and company level. Major differences also exist between manufacturing and services, with bargaining being more prevalent in the former. In procedural terms, with some exceptions, the crisis has accelerated the longer-term trend towards organized decentralization. Substantively, restoring competitiveness and maintaining employment are central to the agenda of crisis-response agreements.

30|$|As expected, higher {{unemployment}} {{is associated with}} a reform stance leaning towards an increased generosity of unemployment benefits and extensions of ALMPs. The reform stance in Labour Taxation is instead strongly negatively related to the unemployment rate. Quite intuitively, deep crises are linked to reforms towards less regulated Wage Setting systems and more generous Active Labour Market Policies. Episodes of large and negative output gaps are associated with an increased need to improve the responsiveness of wage setting to the labour market slack and to re-train and re-qualify the long-term unemployed and re-integrate into the labour force those that have dropped out of the labour force. Deep crises are also associated to less generous Other Welfare Benefits. Episodes of output gaps below minus 4 % are often associated with situations of protractedly high unemployment. In those conditions, benefit generosity (particularly <b>Short-Time</b> <b>Working</b> Schemes) is often brought back to its previous level to prevent benefit dependency after having been increased during the years where unemployment has been building up.|$|E

40|$|Some 20 {{years after}} German reunification, living {{conditions}} and the economic base in East Germany are approaching that of West Germany in many areas. In view of this anniversary and {{against the backdrop of}} the global financial crisis that intensified in autumn 2008, this research report uses the data from the IAB-Betriebspanel (IAB-Establishment Panel) to analyse the German labour market from a perspective of firms/establishments in an east-west comparison. How can the status of the intra-German harmonisation process be evaluated? How has the global financial crisis affected the German economy? The IAB-Betriebspanel (IAB Establishment Panel) shows that there are structural differences between East and West Germany which adversely impact East German productivity (e. g. relatively smaller industrial sector, fewer large establishments, less knowledge-intensive business services, lower export orientation, fewer employees in high-production operations). Employment increased in East Germany from 2005 onwards for the first time since German reunification. During the crisis year of 2009, the level of total employment increased (remaining constant in West Germany) and employment subject to social insurance contributions stayed constant (falling in West Germany). East Germany's fewer links to export markets and its sector and establishment size class structures that have until now been rated unfavourably have clearly proven a competitive advantage in the economic slump of 2009. Atypical employment such as part-time work, marginal employment or employment on fixed-term contracts and temporary agency work gained in importance in recent years. The increase in significance of employment on fixed-term contracts in particular is remarkable. The ratio of short-term employment contracts to the total number of employed has almost doubled since 1996. Establishments are justifying their use of this form of employment citing mainly short-term requirements and flexibility arguments such as extended probationary periods or uncertain economic development. In the crisis year of 2009, there was much more <b>short-time</b> <b>working</b> than in the economically comparable year of 2003. This group included in particular large establishments and companies in the manufacturing industry. In 2009, pro rat four times as many employees were affected by <b>short-time</b> <b>working</b> than six years earlier. Short-time workers were rarely given training. There are fewer establishments entitled to offer vocational training and actual training operations in East Germany than there are in the West. The training ratio (number of trainees in proportion to the number of employees), however, is almost identical in Germany's two regions, though in East Germany a considerable number is handled by off-site facilities. As a result, the chance of newly qualified trainees being offered employment is lower in East Germany than it is in the West. Conversely, East Germany has a higher advanced training ratio.
