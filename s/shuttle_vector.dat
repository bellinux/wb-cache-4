50|$|One of {{the most}} common types of shuttle vectors is the yeast <b>shuttle</b> <b>vector</b> http://dbb.urmc.rochester.edu/labs/Sherman_f/yeast/9.html. Almost all {{commonly}} used S. cerevisiae vectors are shuttle vectors. Yeast shuttle vectors have components that allow for replication and selection in both E. coli cells and yeast cells. The E. coli component of a yeast <b>shuttle</b> <b>vector</b> includes an origin of replication and a selectable marker, e.g. antibiotic resistance, beta lactamase, beta glastosidase. The yeast component of a yeast <b>shuttle</b> <b>vector</b> includes an autonomously replicating sequence (ARS), a yeast centromere (CEN), and a yeast selectable marker (e.g. URA3, a gene that encodes an enzyme for uracil synthesis, Lodish et al. 2007).|$|E

Three {{of these}} replication origins, originating from plasmids of 43, 44, and 60 MDa, {{were used to}} construct a set of compatible <b>shuttle</b> <b>vectors</b> that exhibit structural and segregational stability in the Cry- strain B. thuringiensis HD 73 - 26. These <b>shuttle</b> <b>vectors,</b> pEG 597, pEG 853, and pEG 854, were designed with rare restriction sites that permit various adaptations, including the construction of small recombinant plasmids lacking antibiotic resistance genes. The cryIA(c) and cryIIA insecticidal crystal protein genes were inserted into these vectors to demonstrate crystal protein production in B. thuringiensis. Introduction of a cloned cryIA(c) gene from strain HD 263 into a B. thuringiensis subsp. aizawai strain exhibiting good insecticidal activity against Spodoptera exigua resulted in a recombinant strain with an improved spectrum of insecticidal activity. <b>Shuttle</b> <b>vectors</b> of this sort should be valuable in future genetic studies of B. thuringiensis {{as well as in}} the development of B. thuringiensis strains for use as microbial pesticides...|$|R

Methylation by the phi 3 T I methyltransferase encoded by Bacillus subtilis phage phi 3 T was shown to protect plasmid DNA from restriction by Cac 824 I. Expression in Escherichia coli of the phi 3 tI gene (which encodes the phi 3 T I methyltransferase) from pAN 1, which replicates via the p 15 A origin of replication, was sufficient to completely methylate coresident E. coli-C. acetobutylicum <b>shuttle</b> <b>vectors</b> with ColE 1 origins of replication. Three <b>shuttle</b> <b>vectors</b> (pIMP 1, pSYL 2, and pSYL 7) methylated in this manner were used to efficiently electrotransform strain ATCC 824. These vectors could not be introduced into strain ATCC 824 when unmethylated because the E. coli portions of the plasmids contain a large number of Cac 824 I sites.

5000|$|Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 is {{considered}} a model organism, yet there exist few synthetic parts {{that can be used}} for genetic engineering. As cyanobacteria in general have slow doubling times, it is more efficient to perform as much DNA cloning as possible in a fast growing host, such as Escherichia coli. In order to create plasmids—stable, replicating circular pieces of DNA—that will function successfully in multiple species, a broad-host-range <b>shuttle</b> <b>vector</b> (see Replicative Plasmids below) is needed. Gene promoters, which control gene expression, need to also predictably work in multiple hosts (see Promoters below).|$|E

40|$|Wild-type {{cyanobacteria}} of {{the genus}} Anabaena are capable of oxygenic photosynthesis, differentiation of cells called heterocysts at semiregular intervals along the cyanobacterial filaments, and aerobic nitrogen fixation by the heterocysts.

Highly efficient conjugative transfer of these vectors from E. coli to Anabaena is dependent upon the presence of broad host-range plasmid RP- 4 and of helper plasmids. The <b>shuttle</b> <b>vectors</b> contain portions of plasmid pBR 322 required for replication and mobilization, with sites for Anabaena restriction enzymes deleted; cyanobacterial replicon pDU 1, which lacks such sites; and determinants for resistance to chloramphenicol, streptomycin, neomycin, and erythromycin...|$|R

Antibiotic resistance is often used as marker, an example being the beta-lactamase gene, which confers resistance to the penicillin group of beta-lactam antibiotics like ampicillin. Some vectors contain two {{selectable marker}}s, for example the plasmid pACYC177 has both ampicillin and kanamycin resistance gene. <b>Shuttle</b> <b>vector</b> {{which is designed to}} be maintained in two different organisms may also require two selectable markers, although some selectable markers such as resistance to zeocin and hygromycin B are effective in different cell types.

50|$|Genome-wide {{association}} {{studies are}} general applications to find specific gene targets and polymorphisms within the human race.

Scientists {{from all of the}} participating nations are cataloging these attributes with data from populations of African, Asian, and European ancestry. Such genome-wide assessments may lead to further diagnostic and drug therapies while also helping future teams focus on orchestrating therapeutics with genetic features in mind. These concepts are already being exploited in genetic engineering. For example, a research team has actually constructed a PAC <b>shuttle</b> <b>vector</b> that creates a library representing two-fold coverage of the human genome. This could serve as an incredible resource to identify genes, or sets of genes, causing disease. Moreover, these studies can serve as a powerful way to investigate transcriptional regulation as it has been seen in the study of baculoviruses. Overall, advances in genome library construction and DNA sequencing has allowed for efficient discovery of different molecular targets. Assimilation of these features through such efficient methods can hasten the employment of novel drug candidates.|$|E
50|$|Rodents {{are usually}} used in animal test. The {{chemicals}} undertest are usually administered {{in the food}} and in the drinking water, but sometimes by dermal application, by gavage, or by inhalation, and carried out over the {{major part of the}} life span for rodents. In tests that check for carcinogens, maximum tolerated dosage is first determined, then a range of doses are given to around 50 animals throughout the notional lifespan of the animal of two years. After death the animals are examined for sign of tumours. Differences in metabolism between rat and human however means that human may not respond {{in exactly the same way}} to mutagen, and dosages that produce tumours on the animal test may also be unreasonably high for a human, i.e. the equivalent amount required to produce tumours in human may far exceed what a person might encounter in real life. Mice with recessive mutations for a visible phenotype may also be used to check for mutagens. Females with recessive mutation crossed with wild-type males would yield the same phenotype as the wild-type, and any observable change to the phenotype would indicate that a mutation induced by the mutagen has occurred. Mice may also be used for dominant lethal assays where early embryonic deaths are monitored. Male mice are treated with chemicals under test, mated with females, and the females are then sacrificed before parturition and early fetal deaths are counted in the uterine horns. Transgenic Mouse Assay using a mouse strain infected with a viral <b>shuttle</b> <b>vector</b> is another method for testing mutagens. Animals are first treated with suspected mutagen, the mouse DNA is then isolated and the phage segment recovered and used to infect E. coli. Using similar method as the blue-white screen, the plaque formed with DNA containing mutation are white, while those without are blue.|$|E

ResultsThree <b>shuttle</b> <b>vectors</b> (pSUZM 1, pSUZM 2 and pSUZM 3) were first constructed with the origins of replication from the chromosome and two native plasmids (pZZM 401 and pZZM 402) of Z. mobilis ZM 4, respectively. The three <b>shuttle</b> <b>vectors</b> were stable in Z. mobilis ZM 4 and have 3, 32 and 27 copies, respectively. The promoter Ppdc (a), from the pyruvate decarboxylase gene, was cloned into the <b>shuttle</b> <b>vectors,</b> generating the expression vectors pSUZM 1 (2, 3) a. The codon-optimized glucoamylase gene from Aspergillus awamori combined with the signal peptide sequence from the alkaline phosphatase gene of Z. mobilis was cloned into pSUZM 1 (2, 3) a, resulting in the plasmids pSUZM 1 a-GA, pSUZM 2 a-GA and pSUZM 3 a-GA, respectively. After transforming these plasmids into Z. mobilis ZM 4, the host was endowed with glucoamylase activity for starch hydrolysis. Both pSUZM 2 a-GA and pSUZM 3 a-GA were more efficient at producing glucoamylase than pSUZM 1 a-GA. ConclusionsThese results indicated that these expression vectors are useful tools for gene expression in Z. mobilis and this could provide a solid foundation for further studies of heterologous gene expression in Z. mobilis...|$|R
