2500|$|Holtville {{may have}} been {{reactivated}} as a military airfield at some point between 1951 and 1955, as it was depicted once again as a Navy airfield on the 1955 San Diego Sectional Aeronautical Chart. Holtville was evidently relinquished by the military (again) at some point between 1955–66, as [...] "Holtville" [...] was depicted as a civil airport on the 1966 San Diego <b>Sectional</b> <b>Chart.</b>|$|E
50|$|This general {{aviation}} airport opened in 1946. However, {{it was not}} depicted on the February 1947 Los Angeles <b>Sectional</b> <b>Chart.</b> The earliest depiction of Quartz Hill Airport was on the February 1949 LA <b>Sectional</b> <b>Chart.</b> It showed the field as having a 2700 ft unpaved runway.|$|E

50|$|Like the VFR <b>sectional</b> <b>charts</b> {{that they}} complement, {{terminal}} area charts depict topographic features {{and other information}} of interest to aviators flying visually, including major landmarks, terrain elevations, visual navigation routes, ground-based navigation aids, airports, rivers, cities, and airspace boundaries. TACs are more detailed than <b>sectional</b> <b>charts,</b> and are scaled at 1:250,000 (as opposed to 1:500,000 for <b>sectional</b> <b>charts)</b> to permit inclusion of more detail. TACs contain information on approach, departure, and transition rules and procedures for the congested Class B areas around major airports.|$|R
50|$|<b>Sectional</b> <b>charts</b> are in 1:500,000 {{scale and}} are {{named for a}} city on the map. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the United States publishes over 50 charts {{covering}} the continental United States, Alaska, and Hawaii. <b>Sectional</b> <b>charts</b> are published by the National Aeronautical Navigation Services Group of the FAA. A number of commercial enterprises, notably Jeppesen, produce compatible, certified sectionals.|$|R

50|$|Built at {{some point}} between May and December 1967, it {{operated}} as a small, unpaved municipal airport called Governor Dodge Quinn Airport. The exact date is unknown as it doesn't appear on the Milwaukee <b>Sectional</b> <b>Chart</b> until December 1967. It was later renamed Dodgeville {{at some point}} within the next 3 years according to the May 1970 Milwaukee <b>Sectional</b> <b>Chart.</b>|$|E

50|$|The Willett {{airfield}} evidently lasted no {{more than}} 3 years, as no airfield was depicted at the site on the June 1966 Mt. Whitney <b>Sectional</b> <b>Chart</b> or the 1967 Mt. Whitney <b>Sectional</b> <b>Chart.</b> In the early 1970s the western portion of the former airfield site was leased by McCarthy Land Company which used the facility for the manufacture of farming supplies and utilized some of the former airfield structures for an agricultural chemical laboratory.|$|E
50|$|<b>Sectional</b> <b>charts</b> {{typically}} cover a {{total area}} of about 340x340 miles, printed {{on both sides}} of the map. The scale is 1:500,000.|$|R
5000|$|The Dodgeville Airport closed (for reasons unknown) at {{some point}} between 1989-90, as it wasn't {{depicted}} on the May 1990 or April 1994 Chicago <b>Sectional</b> <b>Charts.</b>|$|R

50|$|Rice was {{depicted}} {{as an active}} public-use airfield on the March 1952 San Diego <b>Sectional</b> <b>Chart.</b> The chart depicted Rice as having a 5,000' paved runway. The status of the Rice airfield evidently changed to a private airfield at some point between 1952-55, as that is how it was depicted on the September 1955 San Diego <b>Sectional</b> <b>Chart.</b> The Rice Airport was evidently abandoned (for reasons unknown) at some point between 1955-58.|$|E
5000|$|The Malabar {{airfield}} {{was evidently}} constructed {{at some point}} during 1943, as it was not yet depicted at all on the January 1943 Miami <b>Sectional</b> <b>Chart</b> (according to Chris Kennedy). Early depictions of the field include USDA aerial photos from 2/24/43, which appear to show four unfinished airfield runways, and about two months later on 4/22/43, which depicted Malabar as having the four asphalt runways completed. [...] The earliest chart depiction which has been located of the Malabar airfield was on the July 1943 Orlando <b>Sectional</b> <b>Chart</b> (courtesy of Chris Kennedy), It depicted “Malabar (Navy)” as an auxiliary airfield. It was depicted as an active military airfield, labeled [...] "Malabar (Navy)", on the 1949 Orlando <b>Sectional</b> <b>Chart</b> (according to Chris Kennedy), and described as having a 4,000' hard-surface runway.|$|E

50|$|Pilots use {{aeronautical}} charts {{based on}} LCC because {{a straight line}} drawn on a Lambert conformal conic projection approximates a great-circle route between endpoints for typical flight distances. The US systems of VFR (visual flight rules) <b>sectional</b> <b>charts</b> and terminal area charts are drafted on the LCC with standard parallels at 33°N and 45°N.|$|R
5000|$|This article {{describes}} the graphic conventions used in <b>Sectional</b> <b>charts</b> and Terminal area charts published for aeronautical navigation under Visual Flight Rules in the United States of America. The charts are published [...] "in accordance with Interagency Air Cartographic Committee specifications and agreements, approved by the Department of Defense and the Federal Aviation Administration".|$|R
50|$|UNICOM and a CTAF may be {{mutually}} exclusive, {{but this}} is not always the case. In the United States, many non-towered airports use the same frequency for both Unicom and CTAF purposes. Pilots are advised to check their <b>sectional</b> <b>charts</b> and/or Chart Supplement (formerly Airport/Facilities Directory) guides to determine the appropriate frequency for CTAF prior to operating at any given airport.|$|R
5000|$|The {{airfield}} {{apparently was}} closed sometime in 1954. It {{was listed as}} an active airfield on the August 1954 Orlando <b>Sectional</b> <b>Chart,</b> but the Aerodromes table on the chart listed its status as [...] "Closed, leased for grazing".|$|E

50|$|No airfields at Kahuku were {{depicted}} on the October 1954 Hawaiian Islands <b>Sectional</b> <b>Chart.</b> In the early 1960s {{prior to the}} opening of the Campbell Race Course, the Kahuku airfield runways were used for both drag racing and the first Hawaii Grand Prix sports car race.|$|E
5000|$|These charts {{are similar}} to <b>sectional</b> <b>charts,</b> and the symbols are the same. However, there is less detail at the smaller scale, so it is seldom used for visual flight rules flight at slower speeds or for local flights. WACs show {{topographic}} information, airports and radio navigational aids. They are useful for strategic flight planning, where {{a view of the}} entire flight area is useful.|$|R
