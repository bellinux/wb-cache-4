Unknown to the Dutch, the Spanish or Portuguese explorer Luis Váez de Torres, working for the Spanish Crown, sailed through the <b>strait</b> only four months later. However, Torres did not report seeing the coast of a major land mass to his south and is therefore presumed not to have seen Australia. Because the two separate observations of Janzoon and Torres were not matched, Dutch maps {{did not include the}} <b>strait</b> until after James Cook's 1770 passage through the Torres <b>Strait,</b> while early Spanish maps showed the coast of New Guinea correctly, but omitted Australia.|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe Soviet Navy has {{developed into a}} major naval power. As such, it operates under certain geographical and legal constraints. This thesis concerns itself with those constraints {{as they relate to}} <b>straits.</b> Four set of international <b>straits</b> are examined: the Sea of Japan <b>straits,</b> the Danish <b>straits,</b> the Turkish <b>straits,</b> and the Indonesian <b>straits.</b> The analysis describes them physically, explains their legal regimes, discusses Soviet transit of the <b>straits,</b> relates the transits to Soviet naval missions, explores possible alternative routes to using the <b>straits,</b> postulates new legal regimes for the <b>straits,</b> and, finally, reaches conclusions concerning the Soviet reaction to the possible legal changes. From the investigation of the four sets of international <b>straits,</b> general conclusions are drawn which parallel each section of the analysis. Additional conclusions are then formulated as to the extent that international <b>straits</b> affect Soviet naval operations {{and to the extent that}} their influence on naval operations has shaped the Soviet legal position on the law of the sea.

5|$|A {{preponderance}} of historians favour {{the story that}} though the Victorious had sailed through the Lombok <b>Strait</b> rather than the Sunda, Britain had come off easily the best through {{a show of force}} during the Sunda Straits Crisis. Numerous accounts, including Gregory Fremont-Barnes' History of Counterinsurgency, are content with a simplified version that Indonesia closed the <b>Strait</b> for one reason or another, and that the arrival of the task force assembled around the aging carrier had intimidated Sukarno into reopening it. A common argument is that the passage was an effective and daring show of force, and often ignores the Sunda <b>Strait</b> issue altogether. This was a sentiment shown by the crew of the Victorious herself, who during their passage through the Lombok <b>Strait</b> went to action stations at the sight of an Indonesian submarine and prepared to fire on it if there was any sign of hostility, and believed that the Indonesians thought it wiser to hold back in fear of their power. This was not a view that the British official reports sought to dissuade, depicting the result as a compromise concession by the Indonesians, who had in brinksmanship terms, 'blinked first' after British refusal to back down. The Foreign Office even went to the extremity of claiming that the Lombok <b>Strait</b> was just as convenient for passage as the Sunda <b>Strait,</b> despite its far greater distance from Singapore and Australia. At the very least, the subsequent Indonesian United Nations defeat and Abdul Rahman's agreement to avoid retaliation was a very positive result for Britain to take from the incident.|$|E

5000|$|There was a {{controversy}} about {{the east end}} of the <b>Straits</b> of Magellan.

The Argentine view was that the <b>Straits</b> continued eastward of the border and that {{the east end of}} the <b>Straits</b> of Magellan belonged to Argentina.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} unlimitedThe Turkish <b>Straits</b> include the CÌ§anakkale (Dardanelles) and Istanbul (Bosporus) <b>Straits</b> and the Marmara (Marmora) Sea between them. The Turkish <b>Straits</b> {{are the only}} waterways connecting the Black Sea to the Aegean and Mediterranean Seas and to the oceans through the Suez Canal and the <b>Straits</b> of Gibraltar. Regulation of passage through the Turkish <b>Straits</b> has caused many problems throughout history. Since 1936, passage through the Turkish <b>Straits</b> has been governed by the Montreux Convention. Following the South Ossetia War in August 2008, the Turkish <b>Straits</b> again became problematic when Turkey denied passage to U.

Should the Montreux Convention be revised?

5|$|Along the San Francisco peninsula, {{gaps in the}} Santa Cruz Mountains, one {{south of}} San Bruno Mountain and another in Crystal Springs, allow oceanic weather into the {{interior}} and causing a cooling effect for cities along the Peninsula and even {{as far south as}} San Jose. This weather pattern is also the source for delays at San Francisco International Airport. In Marin county north of the Golden Gate <b>strait,</b> two gaps north of Muir Woods bring cold air across the Marin Headlands, with the cooling affect reaching as far north as Santa Rosa. Further inland, the East Bay receives oceanic weather that travels through the Golden Gate <b>strait,</b> and further diffuses that air through the Berkeley Hills, Niles Canyon and the Hayward Pass into the Livermore Valley and Altamont Pass. Here, the resulting breeze is so strong that it is home to one of the world's largest array of wind turbines. Further north, the Carquinez <b>Strait</b> funnels the ocean weather into the San Joaquin River Delta, causing a cooling effect in Stockton and Sacramento, so that these cities are also cooler than their Central Valley counterparts in the south.|$|E
