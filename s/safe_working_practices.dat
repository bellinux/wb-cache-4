25|$|An {{ironworker}} is the US {{term for}} a tradesman (man or woman) {{who works in the}} ironworking industry. A structural/ ornamental Ironworker, erects (or even dismantles) the structural steel framework of pre-engineered metal buildings, single and multi-story buildings, stadiums, arenas, hospitals, towers, wind turbines, and bridges. Ironworkers assemble the structural framework in accordance with engineered drawings. Ironworkers also unload, place and tie reinforcing steel bars (rebar) as well as install post-tensioning systems, both of which give strength to the concrete used in piers, footings, slabs, buildings and bridges. Ironworkers load, unload, place and set machinery and equipment and operate power hoists, forklifts, and aerial lifts. They unload, place and fasten metal decking, safety netting and edge rails to facilitate <b>safe</b> <b>working</b> <b>practices.</b> Ironworkers finish buildings by erecting curtain wall and window wall systems, pre-cast concrete and stone, stairs and handrails, metal doors, sheeting and elevator fronts.

30|$|Motocross is {{a popular}} sport both in the UK and worldwide, {{with the number of}} tournaments and racers {{doubling}} in the past 5  years [2, 3]. Children as young as 3 years old have participated in this activity. The recognised protective equipment includes kidney belts, neck braces, helmets, goggles, knee and elbow supports; however, despite these, there are still a high number of severe injuries as shown by our data. The injuries sustained in the paediatric population ranged from minor contusions and lacerations to severe life-threatening injuries. Motocross competitions can cause a significant burden on small local hospitals following large, competitive events despite safety measures taken at the venue.

40|$|Deviations from {{anticipated}} {{courses of}} events are {{often associated with}} accidents, while the effects of deviations that decrease productivity but do not obviously lead to human injury are less clear. A systemic approach to production and safety is introduced, and it is proposed that production deviations have effects {{that may lead to}} safety violations and personal injury. In addition, the relationship between observed and perceived production deviations from 12 senior (60 - 79 years old) males’ routine work using three firewood processing machines is analysed. For simple machine work, perceived deviations were positively related to observed deviations per work cycle and inversely correlated to the perception of work efficiency. For more complex machine work it was more difficult to match observers’ and operators’ perceptions of deviations. Despite challenges in the production deviation concept, this approach offers a holistic understanding of the performance of human-machine-environment systems and complements assessments of deviations from <b>safe</b> <b>working</b> <b>practice...</b>|$|R

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} benzene exposure {{in the working}} environment of workers at gasoline stations. Ambient air (n= 20) and inhaled air samples (n= 101) of benzene were collected {{in the city of}} Khon Kaen, Thailand and analyzed with gas chromatography (GC-FID). Data records were also kept of the amounts of various petroleum products sold. The results of inhaled air benzene indicated the range concentration from 0. 03 ppb to 65. 71 ppb and showed significant differences between concentrations of each zone (p< 0. 05). The highest mean concentration was found in suburban stations (35. 55 ppb), followed by urban stations (18. 19 ppb), and rural stations (2. 52 ppb). The highest mean concentration of ambient air was found in urban stations (45. 55 ppb). Regarding different job functions, the benzene concentration of fueling workers in the inhalation zone (27. 29 ppb) was significantly higher than that of cashiers (0. 56 ppb). The amounts of petroleum products with high benzene content sold were relatively consistent with inhaled benzene concentration, indicated by the significant differences between suburban and rural zones (p< 0. 05). In conclusion, this study found the inhaled air benzene concentration ranged 0. 03 to 65. 71 ppb depending on locations and job functions of workers. Therefore, workers should be protected of adversely affected health from long-term exposure by training on <b>safe</b> <b>working</b> <b>practice</b> and awareness of the different risks associated with their job functions, locations of stations and daily amounts of petroleum products sold...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: To {{monitor the}} impact of health and safety {{provisions}} and inform future preventive strategies, we investigated trends in mortality from established occupational hazards in England and Wales. Methods: We analysed data from death certificates on underlying cause of death and last full-time occupation for 3 ? 688 ? 916 deaths among men aged 20 – 74 ?years in England and Wales during 1979 – 2010 (excluding 1981 when records were incomplete). Proportional mortality ratios (PMRs), standardised for age and social class, were calculated for occupations at risk of specified hazards. Observed and expected numbers of deaths for each hazard were summed across occupations, and the differences summarised as average annual excesses. Results: Excess mortality declined substantially for most hazards. For example, the annual excess of deaths from chronic bronchitis and emphysema fell from 170. 7 during 1979 – 1990 to 36. 0 in 2001 – 2010, and that for deaths from injury and poisoning from 237. 0 to 87. 5. In many cases, the improvements were associated with falling PMRs (suggesting <b>safer</b> <b>working</b> <b>practices),</b> but they also reflected reductions {{in the numbers of}} men employed in more hazardous jobs, and declining mortality from some diseases across the whole population. Notable exceptions to the general improvement were diseases caused by asbestos, especially in some construction trades and sinonasal cancer in woodworkers. Conclusions: The highest priority for future prevention of work-related fatalities is the minority of occupational disorders for which excess mortality remains static or is increasing, in particular asbestos-related disease among certain occupations in the construction industry and sinonasal cancer in woodworkers. <br/...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – Construction {{plant and}} {{equipment}} harbour significant health and safety hazards. One particular item, the mini-excavator, presents a hazard from its inherent instability and tendency to overturn during use. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to investigate turnover incidents to observe prominent factors and contribute to development of best practice guidance for improving health and safety relating to mini-excavator use. Design/methodology/approach – Comprehensive documentary data from eight case study incidents, along with anecdotal data from a further three, were qualitatively analysed in terms of: machine weight, machine activity, ground type/topography, operator competence, type of overturn, damage to property, and injury to person(s). Results were presented to experts in the field for comment and conclusions/recommendations accordingly developed. Findings – Observed prominent casual factors include: inadequate assessment of risk and non-adherence to <b>safe</b> <b>working</b> <b>practice,</b> <b>working</b> on poor ground, and working on inclined surfaces. The use of sealed operator cabs and proprietary seat restraint mechanisms seem to mitigate risk of personal injury to operators during overturn incidents. A need for cyclic training to reiterate good operator and banksman practice is emphasised, while construction managers should also be aware of the risks, and help implement risk controls. Research limitations/implications – Findings will inform construction plant management research generally, and the subject of mechanised workplace transport stability specifically. Practical implications – Best practice protocol will inform health and safety management of mini-excavators at the workplace. Originality/value – Academic research into mini-excavator stability is embryonic; this paper furthers evolving knowledge in the field...|$|R

40|$|Background: Agriculture is {{the most}} {{hazardous}} occupational industry for young adults. Young adults are engaging in agricultural work and interacting with common hazards, however, it is unknown how young adults are engaging with such hazards and whether administrative controls including workplace organizational factors and social influences in the workplace are associated with <b>safe</b> <b>working</b> <b>practice.</b> Methods: Workplace practices were examined among young adult agricultural workers (18 - 24). Workers responded to statements regarding their participation in six agricultural work areas, specific behaviors within each work area, risk-taking behaviors of parents, peers, and supervisors, and items about workplace organizational characteristics. A second study, conducted among swine facility workers in the Midwest, tested the effectiveness of an intervention that coupled behavioral theory with technology to increase the use of hearing protection in swine facilities. Results: Results from the cross-sectional, online survey indicated supervisor influence was more strongly associated with reported workplace behaviors than co-worker/peer or parent influence. Furthermore, organizational factors including number of hours worked each week {{and the presence of}} safety and health policies was associated with workplace behaviors Results from the intervention study suggest behavioral tracking is effective at increasing the use of hearing protection among young adult swine facility workers in the short term, however, changes in behavior are not maintained over time. Supplying hearing protection is a more effective tool in facilitating sustainable behavioral change. Conclusions: Results suggest interventions that address social and organizational factors of work to improve workplace behaviors among young adult agricultural workers should be tested...|$|R
40|$|Instructing {{personnel}} in the issues of labor protection and industrial safety at hazardous facilities {{is one of the}} main tasks that face the employer; the quality with which this procedure is organized and carried out defines not only company’s indicators, but the mere possibility of its normal functioning. The paper contains a detailed overview of the typical content of standard documentation, which is currently used when conducting operations in the oil mines of Yarega high-viscosity oil deposit. Distinct features and unique nature of this oil field require special measures to guarantee safety of personnel and all facilities in general. The author proposes and reviews an additional type of operating guidelines – instructional map of <b>safe</b> <b>working</b> methods and <b>practices.</b> It is more illustrative than existing documentation (charts of inclined shaft development, labor protection regulations), which allows to upgrade the process of instructing {{personnel in}} the oil mines, to improve the quality of instructions and to reduce the risk of emergencies, accidents, industrial injuries.
