5|$|In 2012, a {{contract}} {{for the construction of}} a mesophilic anaerobic digestion facility was awarded, including the construction of buildings and various other pieces of equipment required for the treatment of <b>sludge.</b> Mesophilic anaerobic digestion enables the breaking down of biodegradable materials using micro-organisms under moderate temperatures. The new <b>sludge</b> treatment facility enables the recycled <b>sludge</b> to be used on neighbouring farmlands as manure, and also enables Yorkshire Water to generate 1.9MW of renewable energy using combined heat and power units.|$|E

50|$|Within {{industrial}} plants many substances with {{high proportion of}} solids - such as mechanically dewatered sewage <b>sludges,</b> filter cakes, bituminous coal <b>sludges,</b> waste and process <b>sludges</b> - have to be transported over relatively great distances to landfills or incineration plants.|$|R
40|$|Enteroviruses {{survived for}} up to 38 days without {{diminishing}} in numbers in extended-aeration <b>sludges</b> maintained at 5 degrees C. In oxidation ditch <b>sludges</b> similarly maintained, enteroviruses survived {{for up to}} 17 days without diminishing in numbers. The pHs of the <b>sludges</b> {{in this study were}} well inside the pH 6 to 8 corridor in which destruction of enteroviruses by the detergents and ammonia present in <b>sludges</b> reportedly does not occur. Unexplained, however, was the survival of large numbers of enteroviruses in <b>sludges</b> at pH 3. 5, a pH at which some anionic detergents commonly present in sewage are rapidly virucidal. The long survival of enteroviruses in these <b>sludges</b> at 5 degrees C indicates that such <b>sludges</b> can probably be stored under refrigeration in the laboratory for extended periods while awaiting processing without suffering significant losses in enterovirus numbers...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe article {{presents}} the basic characteristics of composition and formation of combined <b>sludges</b> of steel mills, machine and metalworking factories. The principal issues {{of use of}} flocculants in dewatering of combined <b>sludges</b> of industrial wastewaters are stated. The article dwells upon the issues of a flocculant selection for treatment of industrial wastewaters of machine factories, and creation of optimal conditions for flocculation <b>sludges</b> processing. The problems of handling and disposal of <b>sludges</b> produced by industrial wastewaters treatment facilities are considered. The main purpose {{of this research is}} assessment of the possibility of advanced flocculation technique application for the treatment of combined <b>sludges...</b>|$|R

5|$|Ash-laden sewage {{entering}} a treatment plant {{is likely to}} cause failure of mechanical prescreening equipment such as step screens or rotating screens. Ash that penetrates further into the system will settle and reduce the capacity of biological reactors as well as increasing the volume of <b>sludge</b> and changing its composition.|$|E
5|$|Black Sabbath were a {{heavy metal}} band, whose music {{has also been}} {{described}} as psychedelic rock, and acid rock. The band have also been cited as a key influence on genres including stoner rock, grunge, doom metal, and <b>sludge</b> metal.|$|E
40|$|Twelve {{contemporary}} U. K. sewage <b>sludges</b> were analysed by a Soxhlet extraction, column clean-up and capillary {{gas chromatography}} method. All the chlorobenzenes were {{detected in the}} <b>sludges,</b> although their content varied widely between different sewage works. Generally, chlorobenzene concentrations decreased with increasing level of compound chlorination. Sewage <b>sludges</b> from industrial areas generally had higher chlorobenzene concentrations than those from urban areas. Chlorobenzene concentrations in <b>sludges</b> from the same waste water treatment works over time were quite consistent...|$|R
40|$|In raw <b>sludges</b> and in mesophilically and thermophilically digested {{anaerobic}} <b>sludges,</b> large {{variations in}} numbers of viruses occurred over narrow ranges of numbers of fecal coliforms, total coliforms, and fecal streptococci, demonstrating that the bacteria were poor quantitative reflectors {{of the numbers}} of the viruses detected. Mesophilic and thermophilic digestion of anaerobic <b>sludges</b> destroyed all three indicator bacteria more rapidly than such digestion destroyed the viruses. The relative rates {{for the destruction of}} viruses, fecal coliforms, and fecal streptococci in the digested <b>sludges</b> were consistent over the 17 -month study. Fecal coliforms were 7 to 8 times more sensitive than the viruses to mesophilic digestion and 9 to 10 times more sensitive to thermophilic digestion. Total coliforms were even more sensitive. The rates at which fecal streptococci were destroyed by mesophilic and thermophilic digestion of anaerobic <b>sludges</b> approached those at which the viruses were destroyed by those processes; this suggested that the rates at which fecal streptococci in <b>sludges</b> are destroyed by those processes may serve as useful indicators for the rates at which viruses in <b>sludges</b> are destroyed by those processes...|$|R
40|$|DOE complex {{contains}} many tank <b>sludges</b> contaminated with mercury. The high pH of these tank <b>sludges</b> typically fails {{to stabilize the}} mercury, resulting in these radioactive wastes also being characteristically hazardous or mixed waste. The traditional treatment for soluble inorganic mercury species is precipitation as insoluble mercuric sulfide. Sulfide treatment and a commercial mercury-stabilizing product were tested on surrogate <b>sludges</b> at various alkaline pH values. Neither the sulfide nor the commercial product stabilized the mercury sufficiently at the high pH of the tank <b>sludges</b> to pass the Toxicity Characteristic Leach Procedure (TCLP) treatment standards of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). The commercial product also failed to stabilize the mercury in samples of the actual tank <b>sludges...</b>|$|R
5|$|Oxidative sewage {{treatment}} processes rely on microorganisms to oxidise organic constituents. Anaerobic microorganisms reduce <b>sludge</b> solids producing methane gas and a sterile mineralised residue. In potable water treatment, one method, the slow sand filter, employs a complex gelatinous layer {{composed of a}} wide range of microorganisms to remove both dissolved and particulate material from raw water.|$|E
5|$|Soils {{contaminated}} with zinc from mining, refining, or fertilizing with zinc-bearing <b>sludge</b> can contain several grams of zinc per kilogram of dry soil. Levels of zinc {{in excess of}} 500ppm in soil interfere with the ability of plants to absorb other essential metals, such as iron and manganese. Zinc levels of 2000ppm to 180,000ppm (18%) have been recorded in some soil samples.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, {{the problem}} of ammonia levels in the final {{effluent}} was addressed by {{the construction of a}} system using anoxic zones and diffuse air activated <b>sludge</b> treatment. This dramatically reduced ammonia levels, and was the most significant factor in the re-establishment of fish stocks in the lower River Don. In 1990, the outdated filter presshouse and incineration plant were replaced by a new sludge-dewatering plant and a fluidized-bed incinerator. The new plant made the old <b>sludge</b> beds, situated to the east of the River Don and on the island formed by the Don and the Holmes Cut, redundant, and these have now become a nature reserve. Further improvements to the process were completed by 2005. These included an upgrade to the wet scrubbing system, in order to remove heavy metals and acid gases such as sulphur dioxide, hydrogen chloride and hydrogen fluoride from the flue gases produced by the incinerator, and the addition of a tertiary adsorption filter, which removes mercury and dioxins. The improvements were designed to ensure that the plant met the standards set out in the Waste Incineration Directive.|$|E
40|$|Revised versionInternational audienceWe studied {{polycyclic}} {{aromatic hydrocarbons}} (PAHs) in crop soils amended with 1000 tonnes dry weight of sewage <b>sludges</b> per 10, 000 m 2 from 1974 to 1992, then after <b>sludges</b> addition from 1993 to 1999. The absence of variations of total PAHs levels of control soils, averaging at 123 µg/Kg, shows the absence of horizontal contamination. During <b>sludges</b> addition, the total PAHs levels in amended soils increased from 232 to 402 µg/Kg. Seven years after <b>sludges</b> addition, it decreased to 275 µg/Kg, which is still {{more than twice the}} levels of control soils. This ﬁnding shows that <b>sludges</b> PAHs are preserved in crop soils for long periods of time, on a human scale...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: CO 2 {{production}} of soil from variously treated municipal sewage <b>sludges</b> from three big cities in Hungary was studied in pot experiment.

40|$|Sediments {{and sewage}} <b>sludges</b> {{are part of}} the environment. Sewage <b>sludges</b> are formed in {{wastewater}} treatment plants as solid residues after water purification, therefore they have antropogenic origine. Although the sediment are formed by natural processes, humans also contribute to their formation. Sediments and sewage <b>sludges</b> can be a reservoir of a number of contaminants, due to their properties. Utilisation of sediments and sewage <b>sludges</b> as material for recultivation or a natural fertilizer is currently supported. But after application to the land, contaminants can be released to the environment. The consideration of ecotoxicological effects of sediments and sewage <b>sludges</b> is very important. Sediments and sewage <b>sludges</b> were ecotoxicologicaly evaluated by bioassays with water leacheate and by whole sediment bioassays. Daphnia magna, Thamnocephalus platyurus, Sinapis alba and Lemna minor were used to perform tests with water leacheate. Heterocypris incongruens, Lactuca sativa and Eisenia fetida were used to perform whole sediment tests...|$|R

Consumption of {{the mushroom}} {{could lead to}} a number of physiological effects, including: salivation, lacrimation, urination, defecation, gastrointestinal problems and emesis (vomiting); this array of symptoms is also known by the acronym <b>SLUDGE.</b> Other potential effects include a drop in blood pressure, sweating and death due to respiratory failure.|$|E
25|$|The {{amount of}} sewage <b>sludge</b> {{produced}} from the activated <b>sludge</b> process is {{directly proportional to}} the amount of wastewater treated. The total <b>sludge</b> production consists of the sum of primary <b>sludge</b> from the primary sedimentation tanks as well as waste activated <b>sludge</b> from the bioreactors. The activated <b>sludge</b> process produces about 70–100kg/ML of waste activated <b>sludge</b> (that is kg of dry solids produced per ML of wastewater treated; one mega litre (ML) is 103 m3). A value of 80kg/ML is regarded as being typical. In addition, about 110–170kg/ML of primary <b>sludge</b> is produced in the primary sedimentation tanks which most - but not all - of the activated <b>sludge</b> process configurations use.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{considers}} {{a way of}} minimizing the pollution due to ceramic <b>sludges,</b> by rationalizing the addition of waste waters and <b>sludges</b> in tile production processes. The analytical and rheological results, obtained on the body slips used for white gres tile production in waste or purified waters, demonstrate that the addition of dried <b>sludges</b> up to 5 % wt (in place of the < 2 % wt amount till now used) makes the slip completely compatible with industrial requirements. This paper evidences the possibility of direct use of waste waters, containing <b>sludges,</b> in the wet grinding process, making purification treatments of waters unnecessary and greatly reducing the economical engagement...|$|R

25|$|The 1987 WQA {{created a}} program for {{management}} of biosolids (<b>sludge)</b> generated by POTWs. The Act instructed EPA to develop guidelines for usage and disposal of sewage <b>sludge</b> or biosolids. The EPA regulations: (1) Identify uses for sewage <b>sludge,</b> including disposal; (2) Specify factors {{to be taken into}} account in determining the measures and practices applicable to each such use or disposal (including publication of information on costs); and (3) Identify concentrations of pollutants which interfere with each such use or disposal. EPA created an Intra-Agency <b>Sludge</b> Task Force to aid in developing comprehensive <b>sludge</b> regulations that are designed to do the following: (1) Conduct a multimedia examination of sewage <b>sludge</b> management, focusing on sewage <b>sludge</b> generated by POTWs; and (2) develop a cohesive Agency policy on sewage <b>sludge</b> management, designed to guide the Agency in implementing sewage <b>sludge</b> regulatory and management programs.|$|E
25|$|Where Q0 = {{mass flow}} rate (kg/s), m0 = mass loading (kg/m2), sb = belt speed (m/s) and Lsludge0 = initial width of <b>sludge</b> across the belt (m). Thus to {{maintain}} industrial scale economic throughput at lower belt speed, the mass loading and width of <b>sludge</b> across the belt must be increased. It {{has been found that}} increasing the solids loading slightly decreases the dry solids concentration of the cake while significantly increasing the potential for <b>sludge</b> to overflow the belt. Lateral migration of <b>sludge</b> on the belt is a measure of how the <b>sludge</b> spreads across the width of the belt. Increased lateral <b>sludge</b> migration means that <b>sludge</b> is escaping the edge of the belt and overflowing into the filtrate. Therefore, increased lateral <b>sludge</b> migration negatively impacts filtrate quality and dry solids recovery.|$|E
25|$|The {{applications}} of a belt filter are only {{limited to the}} sludges, slurry or mashed fruit that it can process. The sludges from municipal use include raw, anaerobically digested and aerobically digested sludges, alum <b>sludge,</b> lime softening <b>sludge</b> and river water silt. In industry, any <b>sludge</b> or slurry is sourced from food processing wastes, pulp and paper wastes, chemical sludges, pharmaceutical wastes, industrial waste processing sludges, and petrochemical wastes. These wastes can include mixed <b>sludge,</b> mineral slurry, dust sediment, selected coal washing mud, biological <b>sludge,</b> primary <b>sludge,</b> and straw, wood or waste paper pulp.|$|E
40|$|The {{sorption}} {{capacities of}} sewage <b>sludges</b> were tested {{with a set}} of organic substances. The influence of test conditions on the results was investigated. It could be shown that the sorption capacity as related to the organic carbon content of <b>sludges</b> (Koc-values) is comparable to those of agricultural top soils.

25|$|Standards are set {{for sewage}} <b>sludge</b> {{generated}} or treated by publicly owned and privately owned treatment works that treat domestic sewage and municipal wastewater. Materials flushed in household drains through sinks, toilets and tubs {{are referred to}} as domestic wastewater and include components of soaps, shampoos, human excrement, tissues, food particles, pesticides, hazardous waste, oil and grease. These domestic wastewaters are treated at the source in septic tanks, cesspools, portable toilets, or in publicly/privately owned wastewater treatment works. Alternately, municipal wastewater treatments consist of more levels of treatment that provide greater wastewater cleanup with larger amounts of sewage <b>sludge.</b> Primary municipal treatment remove solids that settle at the bottom, generating more than 3,000 liters of <b>sludge</b> per million liters of wastewater that is treated. Primary <b>sludge</b> water content is easily reduced by thickening or removing water and contains up to 7% solids. Secondary municipal treatment process produces sewage <b>sludge</b> that is generated by biological treatment processes that include activated <b>sludge</b> systems, trickling filters, and other attached growth systems. Microbes are used to break down and convert organic substances in wastewater to microbial residue in biological treatment processes. This process removes up to 90% of organic matter and produces <b>sludge</b> that contains up to 2% solids and has increased generated volumes of <b>sludge.</b> Methods of use and disposal of sewage <b>sludge</b> include the following: Application of <b>sludge</b> to agricultural and non-agricultural lands; sale or give-away of <b>sludge</b> for use in home gardens; disposal of <b>sludge</b> in municipal landfills, sludge-only landfills, surface disposal sites and incineration of <b>sludge.</b> Managing quality of sewage <b>sludge</b> not only involves wastewater reduction and separation of contaminated waste from non-contaminants but also pretreatment of non-domestic wastewater. Pretreatment does not thoroughly reduce pollutants level and therefore communities have to dispose rather than use <b>sludge.</b>|$|E
25|$|The term biosolids {{is used to}} {{differentiate}} treated sewage <b>sludge</b> that can be beneficially recycled. Environmental advantages of sewage <b>sludge</b> consist of, application of <b>sludge</b> to land due to its soil condition properties and nutrient content. Advantages also extend to reduction in adverse health effects of incineration, decreased chemical fertilizer dependency, diminishing greenhouse gas emissions deriving from incineration and reduction in incineration fuel and energy costs. Beneficial reuse of sewage <b>sludge</b> is supported in EPA policies: the 1984 Beneficial Reuse Policy and the 1991 Inter-agency Policy on Beneficial Use of Sewage <b>Sludge,</b> with an objective to reduce volumes of waste generated. Sewage <b>sludge</b> contains nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus but also contains significant numbers of pathogens such as bacteria, viruses, protozoa and eggs of parasitic worms. <b>Sludge</b> also contains more than trace amounts of organic and inorganic chemicals. Benefits of reusing sewage <b>sludge</b> from use of organic and nutrient content in biosolids is valuable source in improving marginal lands and serving as supplements to fertilizers and soil conditioners. Extension of benefits of <b>sludge</b> on agriculture commodities include increase forest productivity, accelerated tree growth, re-vegetation of forest land previously devastated by natural disasters or construction activities. Also, sewage <b>sludge</b> use to aid growth of final vegetative cap for municipal solid waste landfills is enormously beneficial. Opposing benefits of <b>sludge</b> water result from high levels of pathogenic organisms that can possibly contaminate soil, water, crops, livestock, and fish. Pathogens, metals, organic chemical content and odors are cause of major health, environmental and aesthetic factors. <b>Sludge</b> treatment processes reduce the level of pathogens which becomes important when applying <b>sludge</b> to land as well as distributing and marketing it. Pollutants of sewage <b>sludge</b> come from domestic wastewater, discharge of industrial wastewater, municipal sewers and also from runoffs from parking lots, lawns and fields that were applied fertilizers, pesticides and insecticides.|$|E

Such shafts may be up to 100 metres deep and are filled with sewage liquor. As the sewage rises the oxygen forced into solution by the pressure {{at the base of the}} shaft breaks out as molecular oxygen providing a highly efficient source of oxygen for the activated <b>sludge</b> biota. The rising oxygen and injected return <b>sludge</b> provide the physical mechanism for mixing of the sewage and <b>sludge.</b> Mixed <b>sludge</b> and sewage is decanted at the surface and separated into supernatant and <b>sludge</b> components.
