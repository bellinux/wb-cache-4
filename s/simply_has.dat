5|$|He {{also said}} that the {{situation}} had been looked at in the wrong way by police, members of parliament and the security services; rather than asking if Profumo had committed adultery they should have asked if his conduct had led ordinary people to believe he committed adultery. His analogy was with divorce law; a man does not need to have committed adultery for his wife to have grounds to divorce him, but rather she <b>simply</b> <b>has</b> to believe that he has committed adultery. This is because such a belief would destroy the trust and confidence within the relationship. This brought criticism from several government ministers including Sir John Hobson, the Attorney-General for England and Wales, saying that it would mean condemning a man on the basis of suspicion rather than evidence.|$|E

DSM-5 planning committees are currently seeking to establish a research basis for a hybrid dimensional classification of personality disorders. However, the problem with entirely dimensional classifications is {{they are said to}} be of limited practical value in clinical practice where yes/no decisions often need to be made, for example whether a person requires treatment, and moreover the rest of medicine is firmly committed to categories, which are assumed to reflect discrete disease entities. While the Psychodynamic Diagnostic Manual has an emphasis on dimensionality and the context of mental problems, it has been structured largely as an adjunct to the categories of the DSM.|$|E

25|$|A forced {{marriage}} is a marriage where one or both participants are married without their freely given consent. In {{many parts of the}} world, {{it is often difficult to}} draw a line between 'forced' and 'consensual' marriage: in many cultures (especially in South Asia, the Middle East and parts of Africa), marriages are prearranged, often as soon a girl is born; the idea of a girl going against the wishes of her family and choosing herself her own future husband is not socially accepted – there is no need to use threats or violence to force the marriage, the future bride will submit because she <b>simply</b> <b>has</b> no other choice. As in the case of child marriage, the customs of dowry and bride price contribute to this phenomenon. A child {{marriage is a}} marriage where one or both parties are younger than 18.|$|E

In the book It's a Dark World, Roger Boehm argued that due to its psychic-status and the symbols on its body of the latter, Kadabra represented the occult, further arguing that the etymology of its name tied directly to them.|$|E
500|$|Without {{the use of}} ordered rules, Uruguayan Spanish {{could be}} {{interpreted}} as having two additional phonemes and morphophonemic vowel alternation with its plural marker. [...] Attempting to construct a diasystem that encodes such a variety would thus represent all Spanish varieties as having seven vowel phonemes (with contrasts only in final position). [...] Due to both varieties having closed allophones of mid vowels in open syllables and open allophones in closed syllables, using ordered rules minimizes the differences so that the underlying form for both varieties is the same and Uruguayan Spanish <b>simply</b> <b>has</b> a subsequent rule that deletes [...] {{at the end of a}} syllable; constructing a diaphonemic system thus becomes a relatively straightforward process. [...] suggests that the rules needed to account for dialectal differences, even if not psychologically real, may be historically accurate.|$|E

500|$|Yearn Hong Choi assess that [...] "Han is not {{a typical}} North Korean writer" [...] but an {{extremely}} political one in his attempt at pleasing Kim Il-sung. B. R. Myers contrasts Han's legacy with that of North Korean poet Cho Ki-chon. While in Han's works Kim Il-sung embodies traditional Korean virtues of innocence and naivety having [...] "mastered Marxism–Leninism with his heart, not his brain", in Cho's he exemplifies particular traits of the rather early cult of personality built upon Soviet Marxism–Leninism and bloc conformity. The style of Han based on Korean ethnic nationalism ultimately established itself as the standard of propaganda over Cho's. According to Myers, Han {{is not a}} writer of fiction in the official literary doctrine of socialist realism at all, but [...] "his own man, not a socialist realist". Yearn Hong Choi disagrees, and points to Han's one-time praise of the Soviets and Kim Il-sung {{as well as his}} employment of propaganda in praise of a [...] "utopian" [...] North Korea as proof of him being a socialist realist. According to Yearn, Myers <b>simply</b> <b>has</b> a different idea of what socialist realism is from North Korean writers.|$|E

IGN awarded the film {{eight out of}} ten and said, [...] "Dredd is a character study, primarily, one fuelled by violence and action, and we can't {{think of a better}} way to re-introduce this character to cinema audiences." [...] Indiewire said, [...] "As Dredd, Urban either has a better character to play than [...] did, or <b>simply</b> <b>has</b> a better grasp on what makes him tick, but the actor continues to distinguish himself as a versatile performer who turns mimicry into emotional meaning." [...] Empires Chris Hewitt scored the film three out of five stars, and said it gets the lead character [...] "absolutely, incontrovertibly right" [...] and that Urban's Dredd is [...] "a deadpan delight—he doesn't grow as a person and he doesn't crack wise...the movie generates its few laughs from his sheer intractability". Hewitt also called Thirlby's Anderson engaging and wrote that the film is [...] "a solid, occasionally excellent take on , with Urban's chin particularly impressive." [...] Varietys Geoff Berkshire said the film is [...] "Grim, gritty and ultra-violent", called Dredd a [...] "badass of few words", and wrote that Urban [...] "does a fine job embodying the more mythic qualities of Dredd as an upright law enforcer no lowlife would want to confront." [...] He also praised Thirlby for carrying the film's emotional story and said, [...] "one of the film's true thrills comes in watching Thirlby effortlessly balance the conflict between a Judge's merciless duties and a psychic's compassionate understanding." ...|$|E
