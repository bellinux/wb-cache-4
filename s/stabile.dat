5|$|Bert Patenaude was {{the first}} player to score a hat-trick in a World Cup match, on 17 July 1930 against Paraguay. However, until 10 November 2006 the first hat-trick that FIFA {{acknowledged}} had been scored by Guillermo <b>Stábile</b> of Argentina, two days after Patenaude. In 2006 FIFA announced that Patenaude's claim to being the first hat-trick scorer was valid, as teammate Tom Florie's goal in the match against Paraguay was reattributed to him.|$|E
5|$|The hosts {{scored the}} opening goal through Pablo Dorado, a low shot from a {{position}} on the right. Argentina, displaying superior passing ability, responded strongly. Within eight minutes they were back on level terms; Carlos Peucelle received a Ferreira through-ball, beat his marker and equalised. Shortly before half-time leading tournament goalscorer Guillermo <b>Stábile</b> gave Argentina a 2–1 lead. Uruguay captain Nasazzi protested, maintaining that <b>Stábile</b> was offside, but to no avail. In the second half Uruguay gradually became ascendant. Shortly after Monti missed a chance to make the score 3–1, Uruguay attacked in numbers, and Pedro Cea scored an equaliser. Ten minutes later a goal by Santos Iriarte gave Uruguay the lead, and just before full-time Castro made it 4–2 to seal the win. Langenus ended the match a minute later, and Uruguay thus added the title World Cup winners to their mantle of Olympic champions. Jules Rimet presented the World Cup Trophy, which was later named for him, {{to the head of the}} Uruguayan Football Association, Raúl Jude. The following day was declared a national holiday in Uruguay; in the Argentinian capital, Buenos Aires, a mob threw stones at the Uruguayan consulate. Francisco Varallo (who played as a forward for Argentina) was the last player of the final to die, on 30 August 2010.|$|E

5|$|France's final match, against Chile, {{featured}} the first penalty kick {{of the tournament}} and World Cup history. The first goalkeeper to save a penalty was Alex Thépot of France on 19 July 1930, saving from Chile's Carlos Vidal in the 30th minute of the match. In Argentina's second match, against Mexico, three penalty kicks were awarded. During the same match on 19 July 1930 Mexico's Oscar Bonfiglio Martínez saved another penalty at the 23rd minute of the match against Argentina's Fernando Paternoster. Guillermo <b>Stábile</b> scored a hat-trick in his international debut as Argentina won 6–3, {{despite the absence of}} their captain Manuel Ferreira, who had returned to Buenos Aires to take a law exam. Qualification was decided by the group's final match, contested by Argentina and Chile, who had beaten France and Mexico, respectively. The game was marred by a brawl sparked by a foul on Arturo Torres by Monti. Argentina won 3–1 against their neighbours and advanced to the semi-finals.|$|E

50|$|He made {{most of his}} monumental <b>stabiles</b> and mobiles after 1962 at Etablissements Biémont in Tours, France. Calder {{would create}} a model of his work, the {{engineering}} department would scale it up to final size under Calder's direction, and then technicians would complete the actual metalwork — all under Calder's watchful eye. <b>Stabiles</b> were made in steel plate, then painted in black or in colors.

25|$|Wallace {{made his}} operatic début at the Cambridge Theatre in 1946, as Colline in La bohème.

His other roles with the company were the Sacristan (Tosca), Bartolo (The Barber of Seville), Ceprano (Rigoletto) and Masetto (Don Giovanni). The critic of The Times thought Wallace overplayed the buffo element, both as the Sacristan and Bartolo, but praised his singing.|$|E
25|$|Beginning in late 1949, a {{group of}} parents from the Anacostia {{neighborhood}} of Washington, D.C., calling themselves the Consolidated Parents Group, petitioned the Board of Education of the District of Columbia to open the nearly completed John Phillip Sousa Junior High as an integrated school. The school board denied the petition and the school opened, admitting only whites. On September 11, 1950, Gardner Bishop, Nicholas <b>Stabile</b> and the Consolidated Parents Group attempted to get eleven African-American students (including the case's plaintiff, Spottswood Bolling) admitted to the school, but were refused entry by the school's principal.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Stabile's</b> {{style was}} similar to that of Palestrina, {{especially}} in his vocal music; although he normally wrote music somewhat less contrapuntally complex than that of his teacher, he occasionally indulged in canon, especially in his motets. [...] His secular music, mainly madrigals, were often light in character, an unusual feature for a member of the Roman School, whose music was most often noted for its reverence, if not severity.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Stabile’s</b> {{thoughts}} on capabilities make direct reference to Amartya Sen's {{work on the}} same subject. [...] The tie-in with a living wage {{is the idea that}} income is an important, though not exclusive, means for capabilities. The enhancement of people’s capabilities allows them to better function both in society and as workers. These capabilities are further passed down from parents to children.

Dole. Mrs. Virginia Williams accepted the medal on her son's behalf. Other participants in the ceremony included the recipient's father, Arland, his children, Arland III and Leslie Ann, and his sister, Jean Fullmer.

He was {{the prime}} mover {{in establishing the}} Guild of Singers and Players Chamber Orchestra in 1924, and in 1926 {{he was invited to}} conduct a new ensemble at the Chenil Gallery in Chelsea, initially called the [...] "Chenil Chamber Orchestra" [...] but later renamed [...] "John Barbirolli's Chamber Orchestra". Barbirolli's concerts impressed Frederic Austin, director of the British National Opera Company (BNOC), who in the same year invited him to conduct some performances with the company. Barbirolli had never conducted a chorus or a large orchestra, but had the confidence to accept. He made his operatic debut directing Gounod's Roméo et Juliette at Newcastle, followed within days by performances of Aida and Madama Butterfly. He conducted the BNOC frequently over the next two years, and made his debut at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, with Madama Butterfly in 1928. The following year he was invited to conduct the opening work in Covent Garden's international season, Don Giovanni, with a cast that included Mariano <b>Stabile,</b> Elisabeth Schumann and Heddle Nash.|$|E
5000|$|Alexander Calder ( [...] ; July 22, 1898 - November 11, 1976) was an American {{sculptor}} {{known as}} the originator of the mobile, a type of moving sculpture made with delicately balanced or suspended shapes that move in response to touch or air currents.

50|$|A {{prolific}} {{artist who}} worked in painting, sculpture, printmaking and film, Graves first made her presence felt on the New York art scene in the late 1960s and 70's, with life-size sculptures of camels that seemed as accurate as a natural history display. Like-minded artists included Eva Hesse, Close, Bruce Nauman, Keith Sonnier, and Serra, to whom Graves was married from 1965 to 1970. Her work has strong ties to the Alexander Calder's <b>stabiles</b> and to the sculptures of David Smith, with their welded parts and found objects; she collected works by both artists.|$|R
