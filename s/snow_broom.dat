2500|$|... 106 was {{originally}} an open-topped tram with reversed stairs. There were 22 seats downstairs and a further 34 upstairs. The body is of a timber construction with steel strengthening. By 1906, the reversed stairs had been altered to direct ones, and in 1911 it was rebuilt with a fully enclosed top deck. It used the conduit style of pickup, with the skate underneath {{the centre of}} the truck, in its original state, before being converted to trolley pole when it became a <b>snow</b> <b>broom.</b>|$|E
50|$|Unimogs can be {{equipped}} with front and rear tool mounting brackets and hydraulic connections to allow bucket loaders and hydraulic arms to be used. Most units have a power takeoff (PTO) connection to operate rotary equipment such as <b>snow</b> <b>brooms,</b> <b>snow</b> blowers, brush mowers, loaders or stationary conveyor belts.|$|R
50|$|In {{places with}} light <b>snow,</b> <b>brooms</b> or other light {{instruments}} {{can be used}} to brush off snow from walks and other surfaces. In regions with more precipitation, snow is commonly removed with snow shovels, a large lightweight shovel used to push snow and lift it, and snow scoops or sleigh shovels, a large and deep hopper-like implement fitted with a wide handle and designed to scoop up a load of snow and slide it on any slippery surface to another location without lifting. Other tools include snow pushers and shovels with one or more wheels.|$|R
5000|$|After the Charmings are {{reunited with}} Regina, they {{tell her that}} the only way to stop Zelena is to re-enact the dark curse. Regina {{explains}} that to do that, she would have to destroy the heart of what she loves the most. That means Henry, and is not an option; for apart from the fact that she won't sacrifice him, he is with Emma in our world. But Charming figures out that Snow can cast the curse and offers his heart, realizing the risk that he is taking to protect their unborn child. Before enacting the curse, Snow lovingly tells her husband: [...] "I've loved you since the first moment I saw you," [...] and Charming responds, [...] "And I'll love you until my last." [...] After they kiss goodbye, Regina proceeds to take Charming's heart and gives it to Snow, who then crushes it into the potion, while looking at Charming. Charming collapses to the ground and Snow holds his lifeless body. Zelena then appears, adding a forgetting potion to the curse so they won't remember how to defeat her, and she also adds that Snow will be too worried wondering where her husband is to worry about the witch. Then, Zelena tells Regina to pay close attention since that is [...] "how you ruin a happy ending," [...] before flying off on her <b>broom.</b> <b>Snow</b> realizes that when Charming said they were of one heart it could be meant literally, and so she asks Regina to split her heart in two and give half of it to Charming. At first Regina hesitates, as there is no guarantee that Snow will survive, but Snow convinces her to believe. Regina does as Snow asked, and seconds before the new curse consumes them, Charming is brought back to life.|$|R
