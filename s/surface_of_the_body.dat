5|$|Superficial or surface anatomy is {{important}} as the study of anatomical landmarks that can be readily seen from the exterior contours of the body. It enables physicians or veterinary surgeons to gauge the position and anatomy of the associated deeper structures. Superficial is a directional term that indicates that structures are located relatively close to the <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body.</b>|$|E
5|$|Nemerteans lack {{specialized}} gills, and respiration occurs {{over the}} <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body,</b> which {{is long and}} sometimes flattened. Like other animals with thick body walls, they use fluid circulation rather than diffusion to move substances through their bodies. The circulatory system consists of the rhynchocoel and peripheral vessels, while blood of other invertebrates is contained in the main body cavity. The fluid in the rhynchocoel moves substances {{to and from the}} proboscis, and functions as a fluid skeleton in everting the proboscis and in burrowing. The vessels circulate fluid round the whole body and the rhynchocoel provides its own local circulation. The circulatory vessels are a system of coeloms.|$|E

5000|$|Carcinoma, <b>the</b> {{majority}} <b>of</b> {{cancer cells}} are epithelial in origin, {{beginning in the}} membranous tissues that line <b>the</b> <b>surfaces</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body.</b>|$|R
5|$|The lack of circulatory and {{respiratory}} organs limits platyhelminths to {{sizes and shapes}} that enable oxygen to reach and carbon dioxide to leave {{all parts of the}}ir bodies by simple diffusion. Hence, many are microscopic and the large species have flat ribbon-like or leaf-like shapes. The guts of large species have many branches, allowing nutrients to diffuse to all parts of the body. Respiration through the whole <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> makes them vulnerable to fluid loss, and restricts them to environments where dehydration is unlikely: sea and freshwater, moist terrestrial environments such as leaf litter or between grains of soil, and as parasites within other animals.|$|E
5|$|Epithelial {{tissue is}} {{composed}} of closely packed cells, bound to each other by cell adhesion molecules, with little intercellular space. Epithelial cells can be squamous (flat), cuboidal or columnar and rest on a basal lamina, the upper layer of the basement membrane, the lower layer is the reticular lamina lying next to the connective tissue in the extracellular matrix secreted by the epithelial cells. There are {{many different types of}} epithelium, modified to suit a particular function. In the respiratory tract there is a type of ciliated epithelial lining; in the small intestine there are microvilli on the epithelial lining and in the large intestine there are intestinal villi. Skin consists of an outer layer of keratinized stratified squamous epithelium that covers the exterior of the vertebrate body. Keratinocytes make up to 95% of the cells in the skin. The epithelial cells on the external <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> typically secrete an extracellular matrix {{in the form of a}} cuticle. In simple animals this may just be a coat of glycoproteins. In more advanced animals, many glands are formed of epithelial cells.|$|E
5|$|The winter fur is dense, soft, silky and {{relatively}} long. For the northern foxes, the fur is very long, dense and fluffy, but is shorter, sparser and coarser in southern forms. Among northern foxes, the North American varieties generally have the silkiest guard hairs, while most Eurasian red foxes have coarser fur. There are three main colour morphs; red, silver/black and cross (see Mutations). In the typical red morph, their coats are generally bright reddish-rusty with yellowish tints. A stripe of weak, diffuse patterns of many brown-reddish-chestnut hairs occurs along the spine. Two additional stripes pass down the shoulder blades, which, {{together with the}} spinal stripe, form a cross. The lower back is often a mottled silvery colour. The flanks are lighter coloured than the back, while the chin, lower lips, throat and front of the chest are white. The remaining lower <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> is dark, brown or reddish. During lactation, the belly fur of vixens may turn brick red. The upper parts of the limbs are rusty reddish, while the paws are black. The frontal part of the face and upper neck is bright brownish-rusty red, while the upper lips are white. The backs of the ears are black or brownish-reddish, while the inner surface is whitish. The top of the tail is brownish-reddish, but lighter in colour than the back and flanks. The underside of the tail is pale grey with a straw-coloured tint. A black spot, {{the location of the}} supracaudal gland, is usually present {{at the base of the}} tail. The tip of the tail is white.|$|E

25|$|Some {{species of}} crab use a {{respiratory}} organ called a branchiostegal lung. Its gill-like structure increases {{the surface area}} for gas exchange which is more suited to taking oxygen from the air than from water.

50|$|Carcinoma {{is a type}} {{of cancer}} that {{develops}} from epithelial cells. Specifically, a carcinoma is a cancer that begins in a tissue that lines the inner or outer <b>surfaces</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body,</b> and that generally arises from cells originating in the endodermal or ectodermal germ layer during embryogenesis.|$|R
25|$|For a {{streamlined}} body {{to achieve a}} low drag coefficient, the boundary layer around the body must remain attached to the <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> {{for as long as}} possible, causing the wake to be narrow. A high form drag results in a broad wake. The boundary layer will transition from laminar to turbulent if Reynolds number of the flow around the body is sufficiently great. Larger velocities, larger objects, and lower viscosities contribute to larger Reynolds numbers.|$|E
25|$|Another paradox due to {{mathematical}} idealization is D'Alembert's {{paradox of}} fluid mechanics. When the forces associated with two-dimensional, incompressible, irrotational, inviscid steady flow across a body are calculated, {{there is no}} drag. This is in contradiction with observations of such flows, but {{as it turns out}} a fluid that rigorously satisfies all the conditions is a physical impossibility. The mathematical model breaks down at the <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body,</b> and new solutions involving boundary layers have to be considered to correctly model the drag effects.|$|E
25|$|Thyreophora {{are defined}} as {{representing}} all taxa {{more closely related to}} Ankylosaurus than to Triceratops and are characterized by extensive dorsal body armor scutes. The group spanned about 100 million years, beginning in the early Jurassic though the late Cretaceous. During their time on earth, they gave rise to over 50 different species. They contain the groups Ankylosauria and Stegosauria, as well as, a number of basal forms such as Scelidosaurus, Emausaurus, and Scutellosaurus. Fossils of Thyreophora have been primarily found in the northern hemisphere. Thyreophora can be distinguished from Neornithischia based on: transversely broad process of the jugal and parallel rows of keeled scutes on the dorsal <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body.</b>|$|E

25|$|As {{explained}} by Planck, a radiating body has an interior consisting of matter, and an interface with its contiguous neighbouring material medium, {{which is usually}} the medium from within which the radiation from the <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> is observed. The interface is not composed of physical matter but is a theoretical conception, a mathematical two-dimensional surface, a joint property of the two contiguous media, strictly speaking belonging to neither separately. Such an interface can neither absorb nor emit, {{because it is not}} composed of physical matter; but it is the site of reflection and transmission of radiation, because it is a surface of discontinuity of optical properties. The reflection and transmission of radiation at the interface obey the Stokes–Helmholtz reciprocity principle.|$|E
25|$|Position of {{the body}} can have a {{considerable}} influence in protection from blast effects. Lying prone on the ground will often materially lessen direct blast effects because of the protective defilade effects of irregularities in the ground surface. Ground also tends to deflect some of the blast forces upward. Standing close to a wall, even on the side from which the blast is coming, also lessens some of the effect. Orientation {{of the body}} also affects severity {{of the effect of}} blast. Anterior exposure of the body may result in lung injury, lateral position may result in more damage to one ear than the other, while minimal effects are to be anticipated with the posterior <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> (feet) toward the source of the blast.|$|E
25|$|Insect {{blood or}} haemolymph's main {{function}} {{is that of}} transport and it bathes the insect's body organs. Making up usually less than 25% of an insect's body weight, it transports hormones, nutrients and wastes and has a role in, osmoregulation, temperature control, immunity, storage (water, carbohydrates and fats) and skeletal function. It also plays an essential part in the moulting process. An additional role of the haemolymph in some orders, can be that of predatory defence. It can contain unpalatable and malodourous chemicals that will act {{as a deterrent to}} predators. Haemolymph contains molecules, ions and cells; regulating chemical exchanges between tissues, haemolymph is encased in the insect body cavity or haemocoel. It is transported around the body by combined heart (posterior) and aorta (anterior) pulsations, which are located dorsally just under the <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body.</b> It differs from vertebrate blood in that it doesn't contain any red blood cells and therefore is without high oxygen carrying capacity, and is more similar to lymph found in vertebrates.|$|E

25|$|Corydoras panda has an off-white to pinkish-orange ground colour, {{and when}} {{observed}} under certain lighting conditions, a faint greenish iridescence is present upon the flanks and the operculum. The fins {{of the fish}} match the body in ground colour, upon close inspection being seen to be hyaline or translucent with coloured fin rays, with the dorsal fin being marked by a conspicuous black blotch that covers almost the entire fin area. The caudal peduncle is marked with a black band, this black band encircling the caudal peduncle from dorsal to ventral surface. The adipose fin, supported by a small fin spine, sometimes contains black pigmentation. The head is the same ground colour as the body, with a black mask surrounding the eyes, descending vertically from the fontanel, over each eye, and ending in a triangular wedge immediately before the ventral surface of the head. The pectoral fins are positioned immediately behind the operculum, and are usually oriented horizontally when the fish is at rest, extended {{in a manner similar}} to the wings of an aeroplane. The pelvic fins are positioned upon the ventral surface of the fish, located some way behind the pectoral fins. The first ray of the dorsal fin emanates from the body at approximately its point of greatest elevation, and a vertical line drawn downwards from this point meets the attachment point of the pelvic fins. The anal fin is located far to the rear of the ventral <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body,</b> the attachment point of the first fin ray being somewhat forward of the black caudal peduncle marking described above.|$|E
500|$|Whittington {{interpreted}} as gills some markings {{on the upper}} surfaces of all lobes except the first on each side, and thought that these gills were flat underneath, had overlapping layers on top, and attached to the bases of the lobes.

The upper <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> and tail are roughened by tiny dermal denticles, which become larger towards the midline of the back and tail. In addition, one or two irregular rows of thorns are present along the dorsal midline from the head to the sting. The mangrove whipray is dark brown to gray above with many white dots and flecks, which become denser with increasing size. The dark coloration is due to a layer of mucus, without which the body is light orange-gray. The underside is white with small dark spots towards the disc margin. The tail abruptly becomes white past the sting. This species grows to [...] across and over [...] long.|$|E
