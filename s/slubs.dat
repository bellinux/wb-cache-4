5000|$|A {{characteristic}} {{often associated}} with linen yarn {{is the presence of}} [...] "slubs", or small knots which occur randomly along its length. In the past, <b>slubs</b> were traditionally considered to be defects, and were associated with low quality linen. However, in the case of many present-day linen fabrics, particularly in the decorative furnishing industry, <b>slubs</b> are considered as part of the aesthetic appeal of an expensive natural product. In addition, <b>slubs</b> do not compromise the integrity of the fabric, and therefore they are not viewed as a defect. However, the very finest linen has very consistent diameter threads, with no <b>slubs</b> at all.|$|E
5000|$|The {{occurrence}} of many <b>slubs</b> in the yarn {{was well known}} to the weavers in the Hollins factory in Glasgow for they knew that much labor had to be spent after the weaving on “burling and mending” of the fabric in order to remove as many faults as possible. But in the spinning mill at Pleasley Vale yarn clearing was regarded as an undesirable and costly process. [...] The yarn production people in Pleasley believed that their slub catchers were effective - {{it was obvious to}} them that a slub up to an eighth in diameter could not pass through a slot only 10 thousandths of an inch wide. They never saw the evidence of their erroneous belief since they did not see the woven fabric with the many <b>slubs</b> that had passed through their yarn cleaners.|$|E
50|$|Novelty yarns {{include a}} wide variety of yarns made with unusual features, {{structure}} or fiber composition such as <b>slubs,</b> inclusions, metallic or synthetic fibers, laddering and varying thickness introduced during production. Some linens, wools to be woven into tweed, and the uneven filaments of some types of silk are allowed to retain their normal irregularities, producing the characteristic uneven surface of the finished fabric. Man-made fibres, which can be modified during production, are especially adaptable for special effects such as crimping and texturizing.|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} aims {{to build}} a computer-based system for measuring <b>slub</b> yarn characteristics and evaluating the results using statistical methods. The measuring system {{was based on the}} electrical condenser of the Uster evenness tester as a measuring sensor. A digital storage oscilloscope was used to convert the analogue output signals into digital data to be recorded on a computer. A designed computer program was constructed using MatLab language for signal analysis based on a proposed method. Final results from this system contained graphical plots for the three measured <b>slub</b> yarn geometrical parameters <b>slub</b> length, <b>slub</b> distance, and <b>slub</b> thickness and a final report for all the measured <b>slub</b> yarn characteristics. The results of tested <b>slub</b> yarn samples showed that actual <b>slub</b> geometrical parameters differ from nominal values and the difference had two level: prevailing difference and outlier values. Outliers which are considered <b>slub</b> yarn defects were detected and counted in a final report using the box plot statistical method which could be an effective industrial tool for evaluation of both yarn quality and machine performance. The prevailing difference was assessed using histogram comparison which could help in adjusting the setting of <b>slub</b> yarn device to obtain the required appearance...|$|R
40|$|Strength and {{elongation}} have a {{great effect}} on <b>slub</b> yarn performance in production and usage. The main {{aim of this study}} is to determine the statistically significant descriptive parameters that have an effect on the breaking force and elongation of <b>slub</b> yarn using the full factorial design method. In addition, the effects of the significant parameters on the breaking force and elongation were investigated. <b>Slub</b> yarn samples were produced by using a ring spinning frame on which an original <b>slub</b> attachment was designed and mounted. After the samples were produced, dimensional measurements and image analysis were made. Then quality tests were applied to all samples and the results analysed. As a re-sult, the parameters that have an effect on the breaking force of the <b>slub</b> yarn samples were obtained as the <b>slub</b> length, <b>slub</b> distance and base yarn count. The parameters affecting the breaking elongation of the <b>slub</b> yarn samples were obtained as the <b>slub</b> multiplier, base yarn count and twist coefficient. The relationship between the breaking force and elonga-tion and the parameters selected have been explained by statistically significant regression equations. It is concluded that <b>slub</b> pattern parameters should also be considered for slu...|$|R

The cotton is hand-dyed after being spun into yarn, woven and finished in some 200 small villages in the Madras area.|$|E
5000|$|Yarn {{clearing}} {{is usually}} {{part of the}} yarn winding step. The yarn {{from a number of}} spinning bobbins, called 'cops', is wound on to larger packages called 'cones' for subsequent processing into fabric. During the winding the yarn was traditionally passed through the narrow slit in a steel plate of a yarn clearer or slub-catcher. The object was to catch thick places, or <b>slubs,</b> which occurred when the spinning process suffered an aberration, and to prevent them being woven into the fabric to present unsightly faults.|$|E
5000|$|Antique satin was {{developed}} in the 1950s by combining acetate (warp threads) and rayon (weft threads) mainly as a decorative fabric used primarily for draperies. Unlike wedding satin with the shiny weave visible, antique satin is made of small <b>slubs</b> or textures on the face. The yarn most popular was known as 19/2 ply, meaning 19 threads to the inch woven as a two ply thread to create an attractive silk-like appearance. The popular, quality style is 48" [...] wide and first appeared in limited colors. In the late 1950s a company named Penco Fabrics, owned by Jack Penzer, and based at the drapery building, 261 Fifth Avenue, NY, NY, introduced antique satin in 101 colors, virtually revolutionizing the industry. The fabric was copied by others including Fame Fabrics and Richloom, a major supplier today, and by 1963 achieved major distribution throughout the United States. Selling at the mill level for $.59 to $.79 a yard, whether in the natural off-white, undyed, fabric to black and colored warp yards with an iridescent effect at the higher price points, the fabric in its basic form remains somewhat popular today.|$|E

We present two methods of designing Gabor filters for extracting slub in both the time domain and the frequency domain. The first method selects a better filter in the time domain according to a designed cost function. The second method obtains the proper parameters for the filter in the frequency domain according to the frequency characteristic of <b>slubs.</b> The experimental results with real woven fabric images confirm {{the usefulness of the}} two approaches proposed in this paper. The latter is found to be better than the former. Further, both methods are superior to the existing algorithm. Institute of Textiles and Clothin...|$|E

40|$|Yarn {{quality is}} an {{essential}} concept defined by customer which requests the satisfaction of several properties simultaneously. The objective {{of this study is}} to optimize <b>Slub</b> yarn quality and then predict it. The approach used to characterize <b>Slub</b> yarn quality is the desirability functions. The present method allowed us to qualify yarn quality by an index belonging to the interval [0, 1] which includes the major physical properties of cotton <b>Slub</b> yarn. Each yarn response is to be maximized, minimized or targeted. These goals have contributed to get a better yarn quality representation. The second step of this study involves the prediction of the overall yarn quality with the consideration of the construction parameters by using artificial neural networks. The artificial neural network is trained to foresee only one response which is the <b>Slub</b> yarn quality index that includes all yarn responses. The definition of the yarn quality can be modified according to customer demands. The model elaborated has presented a good performance and flexibility...|$|R
