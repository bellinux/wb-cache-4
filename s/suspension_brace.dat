25|$|The base upgrade package uses 20-inch wheels, {{shod with}} BFG G-Force Comp2 tires and a Panhard {{suspension}} bar to stiffen up the chassis. Apart from this, the standard upgrade {{does not offer}} much in terms of performance or improved handling. Of course, better tires do provide improved grip while the <b>suspension</b> <b>brace</b> results in better cornering.|$|E
25|$|The Insight was facelifted in 2010 in the United Kingdom and in 2011 for the 2012 {{model year}} in the United States, with updates to the suspension, styling and interior. There are {{revisions}} to the recoil rate of the springs, change of the rear camber angles and alterations to the rear <b>suspension</b> <b>brace</b> and adjusting mounts. As a result, Honda promised better ride, handling and stability. Interior changes include revisions to the dashboard, seat fabric, and some plastics. The air vents received a chrome surround and a silver garnish now adorns the door sills.|$|E

5000|$|Cobras were {{available}} with either automatic or manual transmission. Standard equipment included four-wheel disc brakes, limited slip differential, 15-inch Bathurst Globe wheels, front & rear spoilers and dual exhaust. The interiors were uniformly black, with Cobra specific cloth seat inserts in black with blue stripes that match {{those on the}} outside body. Cars numbered from 002 to 0031 were known as Option 97 specification, the so-called [...] "Bathurst Cobras", fitted with parts to allow homologation for racing, including twin radiator fans switchable from the dash, a gearbox oil cooler, <b>suspension</b> <b>bracing</b> and reworked rear wheel body housings. They were most easily identified from the other 370 Option 96 Cobras via their large (and functional) rear-opening bonnet bulge. Allan Moffat's [...] "Moffat Ford Dealers" [...] race cars of late 1978 shared the same body paint decoration as the road cars.|$|R
50|$|The main {{modification}} {{that separated}} the R3 from the GTi was its double stitch welded chassis, which meant the car was welded twice for increased structural rigidity, aided by the inclusion of front and rear <b>suspension</b> strut <b>braces.</b> The R3 was also stripped of its sound-deadening material and driver's airbag, which helped bring the weight down to just 995 kg. Suspension improvements included uprated springs and dampers, thicker anti-roll bars and lower ride height.|$|R
50|$|The {{frame was}} of box section and {{cruciform}} <b>braced.</b> <b>Suspension</b> was independent in front using laminated torsion bars with a torsional stabilising bar. At the rear there were half-elliptic springs. Girling hydraulic shock absorbers and Girling hydro-mechanical brakes were fitted.|$|R

5000|$|In a 1998 interview, Tani {{recalled}} that one scene in Fairy in a Cage was more physically demanding {{than some of}} the more notorious ones in Lady Black Rose (1978), which were simple tricks. [...] "The worst scenes," [...] she said, [...] "are the ones where I'm hung up-side-down and tortured with my legs spread, like in Fairy in a Cage... If you try to fake it by using a <b>suspension</b> <b>brace,</b> the thigh muscles won't show tension. On the other hand, if my legs are tied too loosely, I'll fall. These scenes always demand full-shots, so no trick is ever used. When they tie my torso, the rope technicians-- professional people-- are on the set. These guys put extra effort into tying beautifully and painlessly for me." ...|$|E

Wilwood brakes — six-pot front and four-piston rear — for added braking performance.The 20-inch rims on the GT/SC are painted black and are lined with Michelin Pilot Supersport rubber. Eibach provides stiffer coil-over springs as well as a sway bar kit that should considerably improve the Mustang’s handling credentials standard.|$|E
500|$|Modifications to {{the bomb}} bays were {{extensive}} and time-consuming. Its four [...] bomb bay doors and the fuselage section between the bays were removed {{and a single}} [...] bomb bay configured. The length of the gun-type shape was approximately [...] New bomb <b>suspensions</b> and <b>bracing</b> were attached for both shape types, with the gun-type suspension anchored in the aft bomb bay (although its length protruded into the forward bay) and the implosion type mounted in the forward bay. Separate twin-release mechanisms were mounted in each bay, using modified glider tow-cable attach-and-release mechanisms.|$|R
50|$|TRD offers bolt-on headers, sport mufflers, and cat-back {{exhausts}} {{that are}} 50 state emission legal. Cold air intakes are also sold {{but not always}} emission legal. Suspension equipment includes coilovers, springs, dampers and struts, <b>suspension</b> tower <b>braces,</b> sway bars, and wheel upgrades as well. Braking hardware includes full brake kits including calipers, rotors and stainless steel braided brake lines. Separate performance brake pads are also sold. Oil and air filters are offered. Engine head gaskets and camshafts are sold as well. A number of cosmetic modifications are available among other performance equipment.|$|R
500|$|Silverplate {{involved}} extensive {{modifications to}} the B-29 to carry nuclear weapons. The bomb bay doors and the fuselage section between the bomb bays were removed to create a single [...] bomb bay. British <b>suspensions</b> and <b>bracing</b> were attached for both shape types, with the gun-type suspension anchored in the aft bomb bay and the implosion type mounted in the forward bay. Weight reduction was also accomplished by removal of gun turrets and armor plating. These B-29s also had an improved engine, the R-3350-41. The Silverplate aircraft represented {{a significant increase in}} performance over the standard variants.|$|R
50|$|The BA-64 {{consisted}} of the chassis of a GAZ-64 or GAZ-67 jeep modified to accept an armoured hull. The jeep chassis required some alterations to accept the hull; for example, the cooling, fuel, and electrical systems had to be relocated while the rear <b>suspension</b> was <b>braced</b> to accommodate the additional weight. Suspension consists of semi-elliptical springs front and rear, and steering is restricted to the front wheels. A BA-64's gearbox initially had one reverse and three forward gears on a two-speed transfer case, although a few models appear to have one reverse and four forward gears and no transfer case.|$|R
50|$|The Interceptor had a 998 cc 113 BHP 16 valve V-4 engine {{with double}} over head chain driven cams. The bike {{featured}} adjustable Pro-Link rear <b>suspension</b> with adjustable <b>braced</b> front forks, black and silver cast aluminum mag rims (16 inch front, 18 inch rear), and an aerodynamic half fairing and lower cowl with single rectangular headlight. Three dual-piston disc brakes comprised {{the braking system}} with dual discs at the front and a single disc at the rear.|$|R
25|$|In Europe, only 1152 {{examples}} of this model were sold through the official Mazda network. Only one spec was available and it included twin oil-coolers, electric sunroof, cruise control and the rear storage bins {{in place of the}} back seats. It also has the stiffer <b>suspension</b> and strut <b>braces</b> from the R models. Germany top the sales with 446 cars, while UK is second at 210 and Greece third with 168. The European models also received the 1994 interior facelift, with a passenger air bag.|$|R
50|$|MX-5 1.8i Miyako and 2.0i Miyako {{are limited}} (500 units each) {{versions}} of the MX-5 soft-top convertible with MZR 1.8L engine, and the powered retractable hardtop with MZR 2.0L engine respectively for UK market, commemorating 20 years of MX-5. The Miyako package included Medici premium perforated black leather trim with a red underlay and stitching, special badging, floor mats and climate control air-conditioning. The exterior includes front fog lamps, larger 17-inch alloy wheels, a front <b>suspension</b> strut <b>brace,</b> and free metallic paint with Aluminium Silver Metallic option (and Velocity Red Mica on 1.8i Miyako).

5000|$|A special SS trim was {{available}} on the Malibu and Malibu Maxx with the 3.9 L LZ9 V6 from 2006 to 2007, developing [...] and 240 lbft Nm and channeled through a 4T65-E four-speed automatic with Tap-Up/Tap-Down shifting, sport <b>suspension</b> with tower-to-tower <b>brace,</b> 18" [...] alloy wheels, universal home remote transmitter, rear spoiler and hydraulic power steering. Changes to differentiate the SS from the lower trims include three-spoke, leather wrapped steering wheel with SS badge, chrome-trimmed instruments, sport cloth and leather seats, side skirts, chrome tip exhausts, more aggressive front and rear clips and fog lights.|$|R
5000|$|The Honda Rafaga series CE4 and CE5 was {{a compact}} 4-door sedan sold only in Japan by Honda, {{introduced}} in January 1993, {{and used the}} same 5-cylinder engine {{that was used in}} the Honda Inspire and the Honda Vigor and shared a platform with the second generation CE series Honda Ascot. [...] "Rafaga" [...] is Spanish for [...] "gust" [...] or [...] "blustery". The engine is installed longitudinally, the same configuration used in the Vigor and Inspire. The Rafaga was third in Hondas hierarchy of sedans, and a sister car to the Ascot, which was sold at the Honda Primo dealership network. The Rafaga was sold in Japan at Honda Verno dealerships, and was one level up from the Honda Integra. As with other Honda products, the Rafaga used double wishbone suspension at the front and rear wheels. The [...] "2.5 S" [...] trim level came with a front <b>suspension</b> upper strut <b>brace</b> in the engine compartment. In Japan, the smaller G20A engine used regular grade fuel, while the larger G25A engine used premium grade fuel.|$|R
2500|$|The Skyline GT-R Nismo, {{identified}} by the model code suffix [...] "RA", was introduced on 22 February 1990 and attracted a premium of [...] over the standard car. It existed to homologate a number of changes related to performance, aerodynamics, weight-saving and reliability for Group A racing. Those rules required a production run of 500 units, under the [...] "Evolution" [...] special regulations, but an additional 60 were produced and held by Nissan to turn into race cars, giving a total production of 560 units. Aerodynamic changes include: two additional ducts in the front bumper and removal of the protective honeycomb mesh to improve airflow to the intercooler, a bonnet lip spoiler to direct more air into the engine bay, deeper rear spats, and an additional boot lip spoiler to provide more downforce. The Nismo specification deletes ABS, which are not legal in Group A, and the rear wiper to save weight. The bonnet and front bumpers are aluminium rather than the standard steel, again to save weight. Overall the GT-R Nismo weighs 1400kg compared to 1430kg for the standard GT-R. Tyres are Bridgestone RE71 in 225/55R16 fitted to 16" [...] alloys. Mechanically the GT-R Nismo uses the RB26 engine of the 'standard' GT-R but replaces the stock Garrett T03 turbos with larger T04B models, sacrificing the faster spin up of ceramic turbo wheels for the enhanced reliability of steel wheels. The GT-R Nismo was only available in colour code KH2 [...] "Gun Grey Metallic". Other minor, but noticeable, changes include a circular [...] "Nismo" [...] logo on the right-rear of the boot lip, lack of radio tuning controls on the dashboard console (since a radio was optional), and cross-drilled brake rotors. Nismo-branded options available included a 260km/h speedo, 3" [...] cat-back exhaust system, front <b>suspension</b> tower <b>brace,</b> sports shock absorbers, 17" [...] alloy wheels, and a rear spoiler with built-in tail light.|$|R
