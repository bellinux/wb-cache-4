25|$|It is {{the form}} that allows a writer the {{greatest}} opportunity to explore human experience....For that reason, reading a novel is potentially a significant act. Because {{there are so many}} varieties of human experience, so many kinds of interaction between humans, and <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>ways</b> of creating patterns in the novel that can’t be created in a short story, a play, a poem or a movie. The novel, simply, offers more opportunities for a reader to understand the world better, including the world of artistic creation. That sounds pretty grand, but I think it’s true.|$|E

[...] On the decade's wait before production, she said, [...] "The fact that I had spent so much time with the idea ... allowed it to marinate a little before we shot." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{voice for}} Satan, {{provided}} by Parker, {{was inspired by}} the voice of the Pinhead character at the ending of the 1988 horror film, , when Pinhead emotionally recalls his old life, when he was a good person. The animators went through several sketch drafts for Satan because, in Parker's words, [...] "There's <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>ways</b> to go with him and we couldn't figure out the right one for a long time". The large and muscular look of the character stemmed {{from the fact that the}} script called for Satan to massively outweigh Jesus, and that look has persisted for the character throughout the rest of the series.|$|E

500|$|Chinese {{immigrants}} to the United States were met with considerable distrust, resentment, and discrimination almost {{from the time of}} their first arrival. [...] Many politicians argued that the Chinese were so different in <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>ways</b> that they not only would never (or even could) assimilate into American culture, but that they represented a threat to the country's principles and institutions. [...] In this climate of popular anti-Chinese sentiment, Congress in 1882 enacted the Chinese Exclusion Act, which placed limits on Chinese immigration to the United States. [...] (The original Chinese Exclusion Act was amended several times—such as by the 1888 Scott Act and the 1892 Geary Act—and as a result it is sometimes referred to in the plural as the [...] "Chinese Exclusion Acts".) [...] Chinese already in the U.S. were allowed to stay, but they were ineligible for naturalization and, if they left the U.S. and later wished to return, they needed to apply anew and obtain approval again. Chinese laborers and miners were specifically barred from coming (or returning) to the United States {{under the terms of the}} law.|$|E

[...] Because of the remoteness of the work camp, she was at a reduced risk from the local population who Frank feared would eat her. Frank credited Judy with saving his life during his time spent there, [...] "She saved my life in <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>ways.</b> The greatest way of all was giving me a reason to live. All I had to do was look at her and into those weary, bloodshot eyes and I would ask myself: What would happen to her if I died? I had to keep going. Even if it meant waiting for a miracle." [...] A radarman named Tom Scott later wrote that Frank and Judy shared an unusual bond, with Frank able to send the dog into the jungle with a click and recall her with a whistle. On one occasion, Frank found Judy attempting to bury an elephant's leg bone.|$|E
500|$|... "Pilot" [...] {{was filmed}} {{over the course}} of a month, which was an unheard-of length of time for a single {{television}} episode. The episode was shot in Vancouver, British Columbia in early spring to give it a [...] "gray" [...] and [...] "bleak" [...] look. The decision to film in Vancouver was to give the show the same dark feel as its sister show The X-Files, which had also been created by Carter. The strip club, Ruby Tip, was inspired by a club in Seattle named the Lusty Lady, which is located on that city's main street. Director David Nutter had been a long-time staff member of The X-Files crew. Carter said the episode was [...] "directed beautifully by David Nutter who added to the project in <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>ways,</b> even as it came on, things that he saw visually that were able to actually change and make the script more concise".
