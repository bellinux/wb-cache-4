In 1928, he co-authored with Mary Jobe Akeley the final report and plan for the park’s administration to King Albert I of Belgium. She repeatedly refers to the expedition as the Akeley-Derscheid expedition in her book, although the financial backers of the expedition are named in the title. The Parc national Albert was ceremonially opened on October 19, 1930.

It was chaired by Sir George Thomson and its original membership included Chadwick, along with Mark Oliphant, John Cockcroft and Philip Moon. While other teams investigated uranium enrichment techniques, Chadwick's team at Liverpool concentrated on determining the nuclear cross section of uranium-235. By April 1941, it had been experimentally confirmed that the critical mass of uranium-235 might be [...] or less. His research into such matters was complicated by all-but-incessant Luftwaffe bombings of the environs of his Liverpool lab; the windows were blown out so often that they were replaced by cardboard.|$|E

500|$|At the University of Birmingham in March 1940, Otto Frisch and Rudolf Peierls {{examined}} the theoretical {{issues involved in}} developing, producing and using atomic bombs in a paper that {{became known as the}} Frisch–Peierls memorandum.

As a result, a special subcommittee of the CSSAW known as the MAUD Committee was created to investigate the matter further. It was chaired by Sir George Thomson, and its original membership included Oliphant, Chadwick, Cockcroft and Moon.

40|$|Most {{data used}} to assess the {{distribution}} and abundance of whales are derived from <b>scientific</b> <b>surveys</b> that are designed carefully to minimize sources of variation and reduce the potential for bias. Gathering data in this fashion tends to be both time consuming and costly. Similar data, however, can be collected from platforms of opportunity, including commercial vessels, ecotourism operations and whale watch vessels. The goal of the current project was to make recommendations for data collection procedures aboard whale watch vessels so that such observations are as comparable as possible to data collected from <b>scientific</b> <b>surveys.</b> To accomplish this goal, a sightings data set was obtained from three whale watch companies on Stellwagen Bank, Massachusetts during summer 2007. Vessel and sightings data were obtained via GPS for the duration of whale watches out of Gloucester and Boston, Massachusetts. Whale sightings data were combined with vessel trackline data to calculate species-specific sightings-per-unit-effort (SPUE). These SPUE values were then compared to similar data derived from <b>scientific</b> <b>surveys</b> conducted in the same area. Additionally, sightings data from whale watches from 1994 - 2006 were analyzed for long-term trends in abundance and distribution. Whale watc...|$|R

500|$|Marojejy National Park {{is located}} in the {{northeast}} of Madagascar between the towns of Andapa and Sambava and extends approximately [...] from east to west and [...] from north to south. [...] It is centered on the chain of mountains known as Marojejy Massif. [...] Despite a <b>scientific</b> <b>survey</b> of some of the other mountains in the region by the 1929 Mission Zoologique Franco-Anglo-Américaine, Marojejy was not surveyed until 1937 when L.-J. Arragon of the Service Géographique de Madagascar ascended Marojejy Est. Arragon did not conduct any field research during his visit. [...] The massif was not geologically described until after the French botanist Henri Jean Humbert from the National Museum of Natural History in Paris explored the mountains in 1948. [...] Humbert had previously explored numerous mountain ranges in continental Africa before going to Marojejy. Between November 1948 and November 1950, he spent five months collecting 4,039dried plant (herbarium) specimens for study. [...] After several expeditions, he published the book [...] "A Marvel of Nature" [...] in 1955, in which he claimed the massif was the most impressive range in all of Madagascar because of its size, floral diversity, and pristine natural state.|$|E
500|$|The MAUD Committee {{was founded}} in June 1940. The Committee was {{originally}} {{a part of the}} Committee for the <b>Scientific</b> <b>Survey</b> of Air Defence, but later gained independence with the Ministry of Aircraft Production. The committee was initially named after its chairman, Thomson, but quickly exchanged this for a more unassuming name, the MAUD Committee. The name MAUD came to be in an unusual way. Shortly after Germany invaded Denmark, Bohr had sent a telegram to Frisch. The telegram ended with a strange line: [...] "Tell Cockcroft and Maud Ray Kent". At first it was thought to be code regarding radium or other vital atomic-weapons-related information, hidden in an anagram. One suggestion was to replace the y with an i, producing 'radium taken'. When Bohr returned to England in 1943, it was discovered that the message was addressed to Bohr's housekeeper Maud Ray and Cockcroft. Maud Ray was from Kent. Thus the committee was named The MAUD Committee, the capitalisation representing a codename and not an acronym. Meetings were normally held in the offices of the Royal Society in London. In addition to Thomson, its original members were Chadwick, Cockcroft, Oliphant and Philip Moon. Patrick Blackett, Charles Ellis and William Haworth.|$|E
