5|$|There {{are several}} {{interpretations of the}} {{symbolism}} behind the commonly represented image of Kaali standing on Shiva's <b>supine</b> form. A common one is that Shiva symbolizes purusha, the universal unchanging aspect of reality, or pure consciousness. Kaali represents Prakriti, nature or matter, sometimes seen as having a feminine quality. The merging of these two qualities represent ultimate reality.|$|E
5|$|A further, albeit rare, {{complication}} of CSF leak is transient quadriplegia {{due to a}} sudden and significant loss of CSF. This loss results in hindbrain herniation and causes major compression of the upper cervical spinal cord. The quadriplegia dissipates once the patient lies <b>supine.</b> An extremely rare {{complication of}} SCSFLS is third nerve palsy, where {{the ability to move}} one's eyes becomes difficult and interrupted due to compression of the third cranial nerve.|$|E
5|$|Brian McCoy was {{the first}} to die, having been hit in the back by nine rounds from a 9mm Luger pistol in the initial volley of gunfire. Fran O'Toole {{attempted}} to run away, but was quickly chased down by the gunmen who had immediately jumped down into the field in pursuit. He was then machine-gunned 22 times, mostly in the face, as he lay <b>supine</b> on the ground.|$|E
5|$|Car/SUV – Used {{either as}} a fly-car for rapid {{response}} or for patients who can sit, these are standard car models adapted {{to the requirements of}} the service using them. Some cars are capable of taking a stretcher with a recumbent patient, but this often requires the removal of the front passenger seat, or the use of a particularly long car. This was often the case with early ambulances, which were converted (or even serving) hearses, as {{these were some of the}} few vehicles able to accept a human body in a <b>supine</b> position.|$|E
5|$|Doubt {{was cast}} on this by Robert Dickson in 1878, when {{he pointed out}} that, while {{relatively}} high-status goods were found {{in some of the}} graves disinterred during early building work in Carnoustie, {{there was a lack of}} weapons. He also talked of the apparent presence of female skeletons. Subsequent finds pointed to the area being a domestic Pictish Long-Cist cemetery, including the remains of a female aged between 40 and 50 with osteoarthritis, who apparently died of tuberculosis. In contrast with Holinshed's account, the burials there are Christian, found in a <b>supine,</b> east-west orientation.|$|E
5|$|It is {{beneficial}} to give fluids, as this helps reduce dehydration. It {{is no longer}} recommended to administer aspirin, unless advised {{to do so by}} medical personnel, as analgesics may mask symptoms. People should be made comfortable and placed in the <b>supine</b> position (horizontal), or the recovery position if vomiting occurs. In the past, both the Trendelenburg position and the left lateral decubitus position (Durant's maneuver) have been suggested as beneficial where air emboli are suspected, but are no longer recommended for extended periods, owing to concerns regarding cerebral edema.|$|E
5|$|Magnetic {{resonance}} imaging is less effective than CT at directly imaging sites of CSF leak. MRI studies may show pachymeningeal enhancement (when the dura mater looks thick and inflamed), sagging of the brain, pituitary enlargement, subdural hygromas, engorgement of cerebral venous sinuses, and other abnormalities. For 20% of patients, MRIs present as completely normal. There is disagreement over whether MRI {{should be the}} study of choice. MRIs performed with the patient seated upright (vs. laying <b>supine)</b> are not better for diagnosing CSF leaks, but are {{more than twice as}} effective at diagnosing cerebellar tonsillar ectopia, also known as Chiari malformation. Cerebellar tonsillar ectopia shares many of the same symptoms as CSF leak, but originates either congenitally or from trauma, including whiplash strain to the dura.|$|E
5|$|Ruffed lemurs, on average, spend 28% {{of the day}} feeding, 53% resting, and 19% traveling, {{although}} {{differences in}} resting and feeding durations have been observed between males and females, with females resting less and feeding more. They are diurnal; although peak activity occurs during the early morning and late afternoon or evening, resting usually occurs around midday. When resting, ruffed lemurs often sit hunched or upright. They are also frequently seen lying prone over a branch or sunbathing in a <b>supine</b> position with the limbs outstretched. When feeding, they will often hang upside-down by their hind feet, a type of suspensory behavior, which allows them to reach fruits and flowers.|$|E
5|$|A soccer kick, {{also known}} as a soccer ball kick in puroresu and shoot fighting, is a {{reference}} to a kick that is similar to kicks used in association football. It is the colloquial term for a kick performed against a prone, kneeling, rising or <b>supine</b> opponent by a fighter who is in a standing or semi-standing position, to any part of a downed opponent. The soccer kick was used in the first match of the Ultimate Fighting Championship at UFC 1 in 1993. Gerard Gordeau defeated Teila Tuli with a soccer kick, which also knocked out one of Tuli's teeth. The technique is banned under the Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts however other rulesets, including the ones used by Pride Fighting Championships do permit them. Soccer kicks have been regularly discussed as to potential damage. There has been a regular debate on the usage of them within MMA. Some MMA fans and fighters support them while a fight doctor and politicians have opposed them.|$|E
5|$|Excavators {{found the}} body of the Haraldskær Woman in a <b>supine</b> {{position}} in an excellent state of preservation. She was naked and her clothes, consisting of a leather cape and three woolen garments, had been placed on top of her. Hurdles of branches and wooden poles pinned the body down. The complete skin envelope and the internal organs were both intact. The body had a lancing wound to the knee joint area, where some object (possibly one of the sharp poles) penetrated to some depth. Her skin was deeply bronzed with a robust skin tone due to tannins in the peat, and all the body joints were preserved with overlying skin in a state as if she had died only recently. Doctors determined she had been about 50 years old when she died and in good health without signs of degenerative diseases (such as arthritis) which are typically found in human remains of that age.|$|E
5|$|The Magic Wand {{has found}} great {{commercial}} {{success as a}} vibrator, a masturbation aid for women. Its popularity for this purpose {{is associated with the}} American artist and sex educator Betty Dodson, who used it in demonstrations and instructional classes to instruct women regarding self-pleasure techniques. Dodson became active in the sex-positive movement in the late 1960s. She recommended women put a small towel over their sex organs in order to dull the sensation of the vibrator and prolong the pleasurable experience. Her technique became known as the Betty Dodson Method. Her sessions were known as Bodysex workshops and featured 15 naked women in <b>supine</b> position, each using a Magic Wand simultaneously to aid in masturbation. She provided a Magic Wand to each woman for these two-hour masturbation sessions. Dodson taught thousands of women to achieve orgasm using this technique.|$|E
25|$|Displaced {{fractures}} of the trochanter or femoral neck will typically cause external {{rotation and}} shortening {{of the leg}} when the patient is laying <b>supine.</b>|$|E
25|$|Sleeping in the <b>supine</b> {{position}} {{is believed to}} make the sleeper more vulnerable to episodes of sleep paralysis because in this sleeping position {{it is possible for}} the soft palate to collapse and obstruct the airway. This is a possibility regardless of whether the individual has been diagnosed with sleep apnea or not. There may also be a greater rate of microarousals while sleeping in the <b>supine</b> position because there is a greater amount of pressure being exerted on the lungs by gravity.|$|E
25|$|Radiological {{signs of}} bowel {{obstruction}} include bowel distension {{and the presence}} of multiple (more than six) gas-fluid levels on <b>supine</b> and erect abdominal radiographs.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} cemeteries {{dating from the}} seventh and eighth centuries which contain a {{majority}} of unfurnished burials. The bodies within these inhumations are often laid out <b>supine</b> in a roughly east to west alignment.|$|E
25|$|Relatively easy {{dissection}} of the flap. Bilateral flap {{harvest is}} possible with patient in <b>supine</b> position. The scar is well {{hidden in the}} groin crease. Another benefit of the surgery is the ‘inner thigh lift’ the patients receive.|$|E
25|$|The {{standard}} abdominal X-ray protocol {{is usually}} a single anteroposterior projection in <b>supine</b> position. A Kidneys, Ureters, and Bladder projection (KUB) is an anteroposterior abdominal projection that covers the levels of the urinary system, but does not necessarily include the diaphragm.|$|E
25|$|The acute form of SMA {{syndrome}} develops rapidly after traumatic {{incidents that}} forcibly hyper-extend the SMA across the duodenum, inducing the obstruction, or sudden weight loss for any reason. Causes include prolonged <b>supine</b> bed rest, scoliosis surgery, left nephrectomy, ileo-anal pouch surgery.|$|E
25|$|Various postures {{are taken}} up in some {{meditation}} techniques. Sitting, <b>supine,</b> and standing postures are used. Popular in Buddhism, Jainism and Hinduism are the full-lotus, half-lotus, Burmese, Seiza, and kneeling positions. Meditation is sometimes done while walking, known as kinhin, or while doing a simple task mindfully, known as samu.|$|E
25|$|The {{critical}} {{procedural step}} in forming the new breast is the collecting and the joining {{of the three}} folds of breast tissue (the medial pillar and the two lateral pillars) of the lower pole of the breast, where it meets the chest. The suturing is critical to supporting and shaping the flaccid breast tissues into a hemispheric breast-mound that well projects from the chest wall—a lifted breast. The <b>supine</b> patient then is elevated {{to a sitting position}} so that the breasts drape naturally, and the surgeon then delineates upon them the incision plan for the resection (cutting and removing) of the excess folds of skin from the lower sides (inferolateral) and the lower midline (inferomedial) of the new breast. Afterwards, the patient is laid <b>supine,</b> and the excess breast skin is cut; to avoid a scar at the inframammary fold, a purse-string closure gathers the excess folds of skin at the lower pole of the breast; in due course, the three joined pillars of skin will integrate to the inframammary fold. Again, the <b>supine</b> patient is elevated to a sitting position so that the surgeon can ascertain the size, shape, and symmetry, or asymmetry, of the corrected breasts. If the degree of breast-lift is satisfactory, the patient is re-laid to the operating table, and the plastic surgeon sutures the incision wounds.|$|E
25|$|When {{performing}} the Dix–Hallpike test, patients are lowered quickly to a <b>supine</b> position, with the neck extended by the clinician {{performing the}} maneuver. For some patients, this maneuver {{may not be}} indicated, and a modification may be needed that also targets the posterior semicircular canal. Such patients include those who are too anxious about eliciting the uncomfortable symptoms of vertigo, and those {{who may not have}} the range of motion necessary to comfortably be in a <b>supine</b> position. The modification involves the patient moving from a seated position to side-lying without their head extending off the examination table, such as with Dix–Hallpike. The head is rotated 45 degrees away from the side being tested, and the eyes are examined for nystagmus. A positive test is indicated by patient report of a reproduction of vertigo and clinician observation of nystagmus. Both the Dix–Hallpike and the side-lying testing position have yielded similar results, and as such the side-lying position can be used if the Dix–Hallpike cannot be performed easily.|$|E
25|$|Patient {{transfer}} devices generally allow {{patients with}} impaired mobility {{to be moved}} by caregivers between beds, wheelchairs, commodes, toilets, chairs, stretchers, shower benches, automobiles, swimming pools, and other patient support systems (i.e., radiology, surgical, or examining tables). The most common devices are Patient lifts (for vertical transfer), Transfer benches, stretcher or convertible chairs (for lateral, <b>supine</b> transfer), sit-to-stand lifts (for moving patients from one seated position to another i.e., from wheelchairs to commodes), air bearing inflatable mattresses (for <b>supine</b> transfer i.e., transfer from a gurney to an operating room table), and sliding boards (usually used for transfer from a bed to a wheelchair). Highly dependent patients who cannot assist their caregiver in moving them often require a Patient lift (a floor or ceiling-suspended sling lift) which though invented in 1955 and in common use since the early 1960s is still considered the state-of-the-art transfer device by OSHA and the American Nursing Association.|$|E
25|$|In addition, Geake {{noted that}} the bodies are {{generally}} <b>supine,</b> being either extended or slightly flexed, while the arms are typically {{at the sides of}} the body or folded across it. There is nevertheless variation in the use of structures within and around the graves, which include beds or chambers inside the grave, as well as mounds, postholes or boat parts outside of it.|$|E
25|$|Several {{circumstances}} {{have been}} identified {{that are associated with}} an increased risk of sleep paralysis. These include insomnia, sleep deprivation, an erratic sleep schedule, stress, and physical fatigue. It is also believed {{that there may be a}} genetic component in the development of RISP, because there is a high concurrent incidence of sleep paralysis in monozygotic twins. Sleeping in the <b>supine</b> position has been found an especially prominent instigator of sleep paralysis.|$|E
25|$|Little or no {{preparations}} {{are required}} {{for the study of}} the larynx, pharynx, and esophagus when studied alone. A thick barium mixture is swallowed in <b>supine</b> position and fluoroscopic images of the swallowing process are made. Then several swallows of a thin barium mixture are taken and the passage is recorded by fluoroscopy and standard radiographs. The procedure is repeated several times with the examination table tilted at various angles. A total of 350-450mL of barium is swallowed during the process.|$|E
25|$|The {{measures}} of the bust — A liposuction mammoplasty procedure does not feature a surgical-incision plan delineated upon the woman's breasts, chest, and torso. Yet the {{measures of}} the bust are established {{in order to determine}} the required degree(s) of correction; thus, with the patient sitting erect, for each breast, the surgeon records the jugular-notch-to-nipple distances, the nipple-to-inframammary-fold distances, and any asymmetries. Afterwards, the anaesthetized patient is laid <b>supine</b> upon the operating table, with her arms laterally extended (abducted) in order to fully expose the breasts.|$|E
25|$|The psoas major {{joins the}} upper body and the lower body, the axial to the appendicular skeleton, the inside to the outside, and the back to the front. As part of the iliopsoas, psoas major {{contributes}} to flexion in the hip joint. On the lumbar spine, unilateral contraction bends the trunk laterally, while bilateral contraction raises the trunk from its <b>supine</b> position. In addition, attachment to the lesser trochanter, located on the postero-medial aspect of the femur, causes lateral rotation and weak adduction of the hip.|$|E
25|$|Latin, {{the mother}} tongue of the Romance languages, was highly inflected; nouns and {{adjectives}} had different forms according to seven grammatical cases (including five major ones) with five major patterns of declension, and three genders {{instead of the}} two found in most Romance tongues. There were four patterns of conjugation in six tenses, three moods (indicative, subjunctive, imperative, plus the infinitive, participle, gerund, gerundive, and <b>supine)</b> and two voices (passive and active), all overtly expressed by affixes (passive voice forms were periphrastic in three tenses).|$|E
25|$|The Lady Chapel also {{contains}} some notable memorials, including the marble tomb of John Sayer, inscribed {{with the date}} 1682. Next to the old chancel (now the wooden steps into the vestry) lies a stone tomb which {{is thought to be}} that of Henry of Berkhamsted and his wife; the tomb has lost its inscription and the identity of the persons interred within has been in dispute for many years. The tomb has two stone <b>supine</b> effigies on top with hands together in prayer, Henry wearing medieval armour. Henry was Constable to the Black Prince at Berkhamsted Castle in the mid-14th Century.|$|E
25|$|Guns {{from the}} World War II era {{can be seen}} at Fort Siloso, from a mini-sized to a 16 pound (7kg) gun. Moreover, the island has built the Tiger Sky Tower, which allows {{visitors}} to view the whole of Sentosa, as well as the Sentosa Luge, a small one- or two-person sled on which one sleighs <b>supine</b> and feet-first. Steering is done by shifting the weight or pulling straps attached to the sled's runners. Among the latest tourists attractions built in Singapore includes the two integrated resorts which houses casinos, namely Marina Bay Sands and Resorts World Sentosa, a Universal Studios theme park and Gardens by the Bay.|$|E
25|$|For barium meal or barium follow-through examinations, a 6-hour {{period of}} fasting is {{observed}} {{prior to the}} studies. Barium is administered orally, sometimes mixed with diatrizoic acid to reduce transit time in the bowel. Metoclopramide is sometimes also added to the mixture to enhance gastric emptying. X-ray images are then taken in a <b>supine</b> position at intervals of 20–30 minutes. Real-time fluoroscopy is used to assess bowel motility. The radiologist may press or palpate the abdomen during images to separate intestinal loops. The total time necessary for the test depends on the speed of bowel motility or transit time and may vary between 1 and 3 hours.|$|E
25|$|Chest muscles. The breasts lie {{upon the}} pectoralis major muscle, the pectoralis minor muscle, and the {{intercostal}} muscles (between the ribs), and can extend to and cover {{a portion of}} the (front) anterior serratus muscle (attached to the ribs, the rib muscles, and the shoulder blade), and to the rectus abdominis muscle (a long, ﬂat muscle extending up the torso, from pubic bone to rib cage). The body posture of the woman exerts physical stresses upon the pectoralis major muscles and the pectoralis minor muscles, which cause the weight of the breasts to induce static and dynamic shear forces (when standing and when walking), compression forces (when lying <b>supine),</b> and tension forces (when kneeling on four limbs).|$|E
25|$|The first {{percutaneous}} supraclavicular {{block was}} performed in 1911 by German surgeon Diedrich Kulenkampff (18801967). Just as his older colleague August Bier (18611949) had done with spinal anesthesia in 1898, Kulenkampff subjected himself to the supraclavicular block. Later that year, Georg Hirschel (18751963) described a percutaneous approach to the brachial plexus from the axilla. In 1928, Kulenkampff and Persky published their experiences with a thousand blocks without apparent major complications. They described their technique with the patient in the sitting position or in the <b>supine</b> position with a pillow between the shoulders. The needle was inserted above {{the midpoint of the}} clavicle where the pulse of the subclavian artery could be felt and it was directed medially toward the second or third thoracic spinous process.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} to contemporary Egyptian and Mesopotamian civilisations, Indus Valley lacks any monumental palaces, even though excavated cities {{indicate that the}} society possessed the requisite engineering knowledge. This may suggest that religious ceremonies, if any, may have been largely confined to individual homes, small temples, or the open air. Several sites have been proposed by Marshall and later scholars as possibly devoted to religious purpose, but at present only the Great Bath at Mohenjo-daro is widely {{thought to have been}} so used, as a place for ritual purification. The funerary practices of the Harappan civilisation are marked by their diversity, with evidence of <b>supine</b> burial, fractional burial (in which the body is reduced to skeletal remains by exposure to the elements before final interment), and even cremation.|$|E
25|$|Alongside the West wall {{set into}} the floor is {{the cover of a}} table tomb, dating from the 15th Century. It is carved with <b>supine</b> male and female figures, a figure of a bird (an eagle or falcon) and a seated figure with one hand raised in benediction. There is an {{inscription}} that appears to read here lyeth the body and was buried the 2nd of July An. Do. 1638, suggesting that the tomb has been reused. The original occupants of the tomb must have been significant persons at least locally, but who they were remains a mystery. In the absence of identification for them they became known as The True Lovers, and the nearby riverside path became known as True Lovers' Walk.|$|E
25|$|At {{some point}} in this period, Nemțeanu also went into {{business}} as a clothing retailer, but ended up overspending. Sued by his creditors, Fischer-Galați claims {{that he was only}} spared bankruptcy by a sympathetic judge, who enjoyed his poetry. By then, Nemțeanu's disease was interfering with his lifestyle, causing him to write in the <b>supine</b> position, on couches, as the only way in which he could prevent exhaustion. His friends and readers pooled their money and sent him to a sanitarium in Lausanne, where he arrived in November 1913. For a couple of months afterward, he wrote at home to his female friend, Emilia Weissbluth, keeping her informed of his health. This correspondence ended abruptly, possibly because her parents rejected his marriage proposal.|$|E
