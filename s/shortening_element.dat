40|$|Adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) such as AAV 5 that transduce airway epithelia {{from the}} apical surface are {{attractive}} vectors for gene transfer in cystic fibrosis (CF). However, their utility in CF {{has been limited}} because packaging of the insert becomes inefficient when its length exceeds ≈ 4, 900 – 5, 000 bp. To partially circumvent this size constraint, we previously developed a CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) transgene that deleted {{a portion of the}} R domain (CFTRΔR). In this study, we focused on <b>shortening</b> the other <b>elements</b> in the AAV expression cassette. We found that portions of the CMV immediate/early (CMVie) enhancer/promoter could be deleted without abolishing activity. We also tested various intervening sequences, poly(A) signals, and an intron to develop an expression cassette that meets the size restrictions imposed by AAV. We then packaged these <b>shortened</b> <b>elements</b> with the CFTRΔR transgene into AAV 5 and applied them to the apical surface of differentiated CF airway epithelia. Two to 4 weeks later, the AAV 5 vectors partially corrected the CF Cl– transport defect. These results demonstrate that a single AAV vector can complement the CF defect in differentiated airway epithelia and thereby further the development of effective CF gene transfer...|$|R

40|$|Long term axial {{shortening}} {{in a tall}} concrete structure is a second-order effect that is of some impediment to the serviceability, and in some cases, structural integrity of the building. The research here involves analysis of axial <b>shortening</b> <b>elements</b> that interact through framing action. In many tall concrete buildings framing is inherent as columns, beams and floors are quite often connected with rigid connections. The mechanics of differential {{axial shortening}} and framing action due to rigid connections causes load sharing between vertical elements that fundamentally affects the degree of both absolute and differential axial shortening. Evaluation of axial shortening by analysis of a structural system consisting of discrete elements over-predicts the level of axial shortening when framing is present. A methodology to calculate axial shortening, accounting for load sharing of axial loads for tall concrete buildings, is developed. The application of this methodology {{to the construction of}} a tall concrete building allowing for the building cycle is presented. A program is written that incorporates both the methodology and its application to a tall building, using the ACT concrete creep and shrinkage models. Correlation of the program is made against an existing previously tested program that does not allow for framing action. A comparison is made between the two sets of data for an actual 85 storey building. From this it is concluded that; i) Framing action reduces the differential axial <b>shortening</b> between two <b>elements</b> ii) The core generally experiences less change to axial shortening than columns iii) The effect of framing cannot be estimated by a relative percentage adjustment applied uniformly to each storey...|$|R

Additionally, osteoclast and endothelial cell invasion are delayed in the Lbh-overexpressing bones. Finally, we find a dramatic suppression of Runx 2 and VEGF mRNAs in chondrocytes and osteoblasts that overexpress Lbh. Strikingly, this abnormal bone development in infected limbs can be rescued by concurrent overexpression of Runx 2.

40|$|AbstractLimb {{growth in}} higher {{vertebrate}} embryos is initially {{due to the}} outgrowth of limb buds and later continues {{as a result of}} elongation of the skeletal elements. The distal limb mesenchyme is crucial for limb bud outgrowth. Members of the Hairy/Enhancer of Split family of DNA binding transcriptional repressors can be effectors of Notch signaling and often act to maintain cell populations in an undifferentiated, proliferating state, properties predicted for the distal limb mesenchyme. We find that a member of this family, c-hairy 1, is expressed in this region and that two alternatively spliced isoforms, c-hairy 1 A and c-hairy 1 B, of this gene are produced, predicting proteins that differ in their basic, DNA binding, domains. Viral misexpression of c-hairy 1 A causes a reduction in size of the limb and <b>shortened</b> skeletal <b>elements,</b> without affecting the chondrocyte differentiation program. Misexpression of c-hairy 1 B leads to a significantly lesser shortening of the bones, implying functional differences between the two isoforms.

The exact mechanism of Pol protein incorporation into the viral capsid is poorly understood. Previously, we showed that Pol encapsidation critically depends on the packaging of (pre-) genomic RNA and identified two distinct signals within the cis-acting sequences (CASI and CASII), Pol encapsidation sequences (PESI and PESII), which are required for Pol capsid incorporation. Here, we investigated whether the presence of PESI and PESII in an FV vector is sufficient for Pol encapsidation and whether the rather extended CASII <b>element</b> can be <b>shortened</b> without loss of functionality. Our results indicate that (i) the presence of PESI and II are not sufficient for Pol encapsidation, (ii) prototype FV vectors with a <b>shortened</b> CASII <b>element</b> retain Pol incorporation and full functionality, in particular upon transducing fibroblasts and primary human mesenchymal stem cells, (iii) {{the presence of the}} central poly purine tract significantly increased the transduction rates of FV vectors and (iv) Pol encapsidation and RNA packaging can be clearly separated.

30|$|Several {{studies have}} {{described}} the systemic influence of the gene defect. Stieber et al. [9] concluded that chondrocytes lacking functional HS influence physeal signalling in general, rather than stealing growth potential focally. Koziel et al. [11] described a genetic mouse line expressing a truncated form of EXT 1 that displayed <b>shortened</b> skeletal <b>elements</b> and fused vertebrae. EXT genes belong to a family of glycosyltransferases necessary for the synthesis of the HS. HS regulates signalling of several growth factors. Reduced HS synthesis results in an elevation of Indian hedgehog (Ihh), a protein involved in chondrocyte differentiation. Misexpression of Ihh causes, amongst others, changes in the expression of pro-chondrogenic bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) which alter the differentiation of cells in the growth plate {{as well as the}} bordering perichondrium [12]. Members of both the BMP and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) families are expressed in growth plate and/or perichondrium and are a part of interactive loops regulating Ihh and parathyroid hormone-related protein expression and the overall growth plate activities [12, 13]. HS is needed to restrain pro-chondrogenic signalling proteins and restricts chondrogenesis. If the HS levels are low this process is disturbed and could lead to increased chondrogenic activity including the activity of cartilage cells in the growth plate, which might lead to wider growth plates. Because HS also influences Ihh activity and Ihh appears to orchestrate chondrocyte proliferation, this might be a second cause for the wider growth plates in preadolescent MO children and thus the relatively young skeletal age [16, 17].|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{process of}} endochondral {{ossification}} {{in which the}} bones of the limb are formed after generation of cartilage models is dependent on a precisely regulated program of chondrocyte maturation. Here, we show that the homeobox-containing gene Dlx 5 is expressed at the onset of chondrocyte maturation during the conversion of immature proliferating chondrocytes into postmitotic hypertrophying chondrocytes, a critical step in the maturation process. Moreover, retroviral misexpression of Dlx 5 during differentiation of the skeletal elements of the chick limb in vivo results in the formation of severely <b>shortened</b> skeletal <b>elements</b> that contain excessive numbers of hypertrophying chondrocytes which extend into ectopic regions, including sites normally occupied by immature chondrocytes. The expansion in the extent of hypertrophic maturation detectable histologically is accompanied by expanded and upregulated domains of expression of molecular markers of chondrocyte maturation, particularly type X collagen and osteopontin, and by expansion of mineralized cartilage matrix, which is characteristic of terminal hypertrophic differentiation. Furthermore, Dlx 5 misexpression markedly reduces chondrocyte proliferation concomitant with promoting hypertrophic maturation. Taken together, these results indicate that Dlx 5 is a positive regulator of chondrocyte maturation and suggest that it regulates the process at least in part by promoting conversion of immature proliferating chondrocytes into hypertrophying chondrocytes. Retroviral misexpression of Dlx 5 also enhances formation of periosteal bone, which is derived from the Dlx 5 -expressing perichondrium that surrounds the diaphyses of the cartilage models. This suggests that Dlx 5 may be involved in regulating osteoblast differentiation, as well as chondrocyte maturation, during endochondral ossification...|$|R

Recent {{studies have}} implicated the VEGF and FGF pathways in providing guidance and differentiation cues to primary mesenchyme cells (PMCs) during sea urchin gastrulation, although the relative contributions of these pathways and the cell behaviors they regulate {{are not fully}} understood. Here, we show that FGF and VEGF ligands are expressed in distinct domains in the embryonic ectoderm of Lytechinus variegatus. We find that PMC guidance is specifically disrupted in Lv-vegf 3 morphants and these embryos fail to form skeletal elements. By contrast, PMC migration is unaffected in Lv-fgfa morphants, and well-patterned but <b>shortened</b> skeletal <b>elements</b> form. We use a VEGFR inhibitor, axitinib, to show that VEGF signaling is essential {{not only for the}} initial phase of PMC migration (subequatorial ring formation), but also for the second phase (migration towards the animal pole). VEGF signaling is not required, however, for PMC fusion. Inhibition of VEGF signaling after the completion of PMC migration causes significant defects in skeletogenesis, selectively blocking the elongation of skeletal rods that support the larval arms, but not rods that form in the dorsal region of the embryo.

40|$|As {{buildings}} inevitably {{increase in}} height, vertical support elements (e. g. columns and shear walls) in tall buildings {{are required to}} carry vertical load increments {{from a number of}} floors. Therefore, axial <b>shortening</b> of vertical <b>elements</b> due to long term creep and shrinkage effects is inevitable in reinforced concrete buildings. However, the calculation of reliable values for axial shortening is not a straight forward task. All parameters may be uncertain or may not be available at the design stage. Recently, engineers have also become concerned with differential shortening of adjacent vertical elements, particularly in the lower and basement levels of super high rise structures. Largely varied values and rates for axial shortening of adjacent support elements is not only a concern for vertical deformation, but can critically impact on the performance of horizontal structural elements such as beams and slabs.

40|$|The {{motility}} of {{some kinds}} of bacteria depends on their spiral form, as does the virulence of certain pathogenic species. We propose a novel mechanism {{for the development of}} spiral shape in bacteria and the supercoiling of chains (‘filaments’) of many cells. Recently discovered actin-like proteins lying just under the cell wall form fibers that play a role in maintaining cell shape. Some species have a single actin-like fiber helically wrapped around the cell, while others have two fibers wrapped in the same direction. Here, we show that if these fibers elongate more slowly than growth lengthens the cell, the cell both twists and bends, taking on a spiral shape. We tested this mechanism using a mathematical model of expanding fiber-wound structures and via experiments that measure the shape changes of elongating physical models. Comparison of the model with in vivo experiments on stationary phase Caulobacter crescentus filaments provide the first evidence that mechanical stretching of cytoskeletal fibers influences cell morphology. Any hydraulic cylinder can spiral by this mechanism if it is reinforced by stretch-resistant fibers wrapped helically in the same direction, or <b>shortened</b> by contractile <b>elements.</b> This might be useful in the design of man-made actuators. 1...|$|R

Left ventricular contractility was estimated from maximal rate of left ventricular pressure rise (max dP/dt), peak measured velocity of contractile <b>element</b> <b>shortening</b> (Vpm) and mean circumferential fiber shortening velocity. Left ventricular relaxation was assessed in 12 patients {{from the time}} constant (T) {{of the decline in}} left ventricular pressure; this constant was calculated from a nonlinear regression analysis of pressure and time (method 1) and a linear regression analysis of pressure and negative dP/dt (method 2). Left ventricular diastolic function was evaluated in nine patients from simultaneous diastolic pressure-volume relations during the strong and weak beats. During pulsus alternans, heart rate and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure remained unchanged, whereas peak systolic pressure (220 versus 204 mm Hg, p < 0. 01) and end-systolic pressure (101 versus 95 mm Hg, p < 0. 01) were significantly higher during the strong beat than during the weak beat. Max dP/dt was alternating 2, 162 versus 1, 964 mm Hg, p < 0. 05), whereas the peak velocity of contractile <b>element</b> <b>shortening</b> remained unchanged (1. 21 versus 1. 18 ML/s). Systolic shortening of the left ventricular minor axis was significantly (p < 0. 02) greater during the strong (24 %) than during the weak (19 %) beat, but that of the left ventricular major axis remained essentially unchanged (8 versus 7 %). The time constant (T) demonstrated only slight alternation during the strong beat (method 1 : 54 ms, method 2 : 58 ms) and during the weak beat (method 1 : 57 ms, method 2 : 67 ms, p = NS). Diastolic pressure-volume relations showed no changes during pulsus alternans. Left ventricular end-diastolic volume was 148 ml/m 2 during the strong and 146 ml/m 2 during the weak beat; systolic ejection fraction was significantly higher during the strong than during the weak beat (48 versus 43 %, p < 0. 02). It is concluded that pulsus alternans is a systolic phenomenon with alternation in left ventricular contractility, but nonsignificant changes in left ventricular relaxation and diastolic function. Although contractility was enhanced, the time constant (T) of the decline in left ventricular pressure did not change significantly during the strong beat, because the increase in peak systolic pressure offset almost completely the decrease in T associated with the increase in contractile state. The alternation of systolic shortening is the result of changes in contractility and not of a Frank-Starling mechanism since preload remained unchanged...|$|R

While {{progress has been made}} in deciphering the molecular mechanism that underlies this process, the involvement of mechanical load exerted by muscle contraction in its regulation has not been studied. Using the zebrafish as a model system, we found abnormal pharyngeal cartilage morphology in both chemically and genetically paralyzed embryos, demonstrating the importance of muscle contraction for zebrafish skeletal development. The <b>shortening</b> of skeletal <b>elements</b> was accompanied by prominent changes in cell morphology and organization. While in control the cells were elongated, chondrocytes in paralyzed zebrafish were smaller and exhibited a more rounded shape, confirmed by a reduction in their length-to-width ratio. The typical columnar organization of cells was affected too, as chondrocytes in various skeletal elements exhibited abnormal stacking patterns, indicating aberrant intercalation. Finally, we demonstrate impaired chondrocyte intercalation in growth plates of muscle-less Spd mouse embryos, implying the evolutionary conservation of muscle force regulation of this essential morphogenetic process. Our findings provide a new perspective on the regulatory interaction between muscle contraction and skeletal morphogenesis by uncovering the role of muscle-induced mechanical loads in regulating chondrocyte intercalation in two different vertebrate models...|$|R

The rate of deformities based on ten elements of bone from preflexion to juvenile stages were as follows: vertebral (42. 6 %— 9. 0 %), dorsal proximal radials (4. 8 %— 25. 2 %), neural spine (0 %— 8. 4 %), haemal spine (0 %— 6. 8 %), hypural (1. 3 %— 5. 4 %), anal proximal radials (0 %— 5. 4 %), epural (1. 3 %— 4. 9 %), arypural (2. 0 %— 4. 5 %), lower jaw (1. 3 %— 2. 5 %), and upper jaw (0 %).

It was also found that the LEE 1 P 1 promoter is overlapped by a cryptic promoter, designated P 1 A. A single base substitution in the P 1 consensus - 35 element unmasks P 1 A promoter activity. In contrast, P 1 A activity is much less when P 1 is inactivated by a mutation in its - 10 hexamer element. Hence, even when P 1 is inactive, the consensus - 35 element sequesters RNA polymerase and prevents its access to the P 1 A promoter.

40|$|Tall {{concrete}} buildings experience time-dependent {{axial shortening}} {{which may be}} interpreted as either absolute or differential, the former being {{with respect to a}} single column or core element, the latter being with respect to adjacent elements. The types of analyses undertaken to determine axial shortening would normally be deterministic, the rigour being commensurate with the degree of shortening likely to be experienced. Mathematical rigour, however, {{may or may not be}} justified in the context of the natural variability of constituent parameters and thus a closer examination of the probabilistic uncertainties associated with axial shortening, particularly for tall buildings, is warranted. Shortening is influenced by, amongst other things, the complex load history of a building during its construction cycle. In this context the properties of concrete are investigated to determine those that are critical to any axial shortening analysis. The work here describes three probabilistic techniques, namely, Monte Carlo simulation, and first- and secondorder moment analyses. Each incorporates random constitutive information in addition to a rigorous procedure for obtaining the representative <b>shortening</b> values. <b>Element</b> behaviour is modelled by the composite models of either Faber, Trost and Bazant, Dischinger or improved Dischinger, combined with the recommendations of the ACI, CEB-FIP, AS- 3600 and other sources for describing creep and shrinkage. These models are coupled with the detailed load history of each successive element, based on the construction sequence of the building, and the usual environmental effects, resulting in a procedure capable of analysing fully the axial shortening effects to a high level of detail and with a measured degree of certainty. A software program has been developed to do this analysis. The probabilistic distributions of axial shortening results are subsequently determined using standard goodness of fit tests. With numerous predictive methods available for column behaviour, the author sets out to examine their differences in the context of axial shortening behaviour. An assessment of the sensitivity of each input parameter, in addition to comparisons with other predictive procedures is made. Conclusions follow from these studies.

40|$|It {{is shown}} that a {{frequently}} used relation between the interband momentum and dipole matrix <b>elements</b> (<b>shortened</b> to the “p-r relation”) in semiconductors acquires an additional correction term if applied to finite-volume crystals treated with periodic boundary conditions. The correction term, which is a generalization of the one obtained by Yafet [Phys. Rev. 106, 679 (1957) ] for infinite crystals, does not vanish {{in the limit of}} infinite volume. We illustrate this with numerical examples for bulk GaAs and GaAs superlattices. The persistence of the correction term is traced to the subtle nature of the dipole matrix element with spatially extended wave functions. In contrast, a straightforward application of the findings by Blount [Solid State Phys. 13, 305 (1962) ] and Haug [Theoretical Solid State Physics (Pergamon, Oxford, 1972) ] yields the usual p-r relation in the distribution sense, without any corrections, when Bloch wave functions normalized to delta functions in crystal momentum space are used. Our findings therefore show that, for the interband dipole matrix element, using Bloch wave functions under periodic boundary conditions is not the proper way to approach the infinite-volume limit. From our numerical evaluations, we find that the correction term is large in the case of interband transitions in bulk GaAs, and that it can be chosen to be small in the case of intersubband transitions in superlattices, which are important in the context of terahertz (THz) radiation. We also show that one can interpret the infinite-volume p-r relation in terms of a limiting procedure using progressively broadened wave packet states that approach delta-normalized Bloc...|$|R
40|$|Non linear {{deformation}} of concrete has an adverse impact on high-rise buildings with complex geometries due to differential axial shortening. These adverse effects {{are caused by}} time dependent behaviour resulting in volume change known as “shrinkage”, “creep” and “elastic” deformation. These three phenomena govern the behaviour and performance of all concrete elements during and after construction. Reinforcement content, variable concrete modulus, volume to surface area ratio of elements, environmental conditions and construction quality influence the performance of concrete elements and differential axial shortening will occur in all structural systems. Their detrimental effects escalate with increasing height and non vertical load paths resulting from geometric complexity. The magnitude of these effects {{have a significant impact}} on building envelopes, building services, secondary systems and the life time serviceability and performance Analytical and test procedures available to quantify the magnitude of these effects are limited to a very few parameters and are not adequately rigorous to capture the complexity of true time dependent material response.

40|$|Due to {{the length}} of the mill, {{accurate}} modelling of stationary solution of continuous cold roll forming by the finite element method using the classical Lagrangian formulation usually requires a very large mesh leading to huge CPU times. In order to model industrial forming lines including many tools in a reasonable time, the sheet has to be <b>shortened</b> or the <b>element</b> size has to be increased leading to inaccurate results. On top of this, applying loads and boundary conditions on this smaller sheet is usually more difficult than in the continuous case. Moreover, transient dynamic vibrations, which are unnecessarily computed, may appear when the sheet hits each tool, decreasing the convergence rate of the numerical simulation. Beside this classical Lagrangian approach, an alternative method is given by the Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian (ALE) formalism which consists in decoupling the motion of the material and the mesh. Starting from an initial guess of the sheet geometry between the rolls, the numerical simulation is performed until the stationary state is reached with a mesh, the nodes of which are fixed in the rolling direction but are free to move on perpendicular plane, following the geometrical boundary of the sheet. The whole forming line can then be modelled using a limited number of brick and contact elements because the mesh is only refined near the tools where bending and contact occur.

40|$|Abstract Background Over {{recent years}} {{there has been}} an {{increasing}} prevalence of verbal and physical violence in Israel, including in the work place. Physicians are exposed to violence in hospitals and in the community. The objective was to characterize acts of verbal and physical violence towards hospital- and community-based physicians. Methods A convenience sample of physicians working in the hospital and community completed an anonymous questionnaire about their experience with violence. Data collection took place between November 2001 and July 2002. One hundred seventy seven physicians participated in the study, 95 from the hospital and 82 from community clinics. The community sample included general physicians, pediatricians, specialists and residents. Results Ninety-nine physicians (56 %) reported at least one act of verbal violence and 16 physicians (9 %) reported exposure to at least one act of physical violence during the previous year. Fifty-one hospital physicians (53. 7 %) were exposed to verbal violence and 9 (9. 5 %) to physical violence. Forty-eight community physicians (58. 5 %) were exposed to verbal violence and 7 (8. 5 %) to physical violence. Seventeen community physicians (36. 2 %) compared to eleven hospital physicians (17. 2 %) said that the violence had a negative impact on their family and on their quality of life (p Conclusion Verbal and/or physical violence against physicians is common in both the hospital and in community clinics. The impatience that accompanies waiting times may have a cultural <b>element.</b> <b>Shortening</b> waiting times and providing more information to patients and families could reduce the rate of violence, but a cultural change may also be required. </p...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe Wnt {{antagonist}} Frzb- 1 {{is expressed}} during limb skeletogenesis, but its roles in this complex multistep process {{are not fully}} understood. To address this issue, we determined Frzb- 1 gene expression patterns during chick long bone development and carried out gain- and loss-of-function studies by misexpression of Frzb- 1, Wnt- 8 (a known Frzb- 1 target), or different forms of the intracellular Wnt mediator LEF- 1 in developing limbs and cultured chondrocytes. Frzb- 1 expression was quite strong in mesenchymal prechondrogenic condensations and then characterized epiphyseal articular chondrocytes and prehypertrophic chondrocytes in growth plates. Virally driven Frzb- 1 misexpression caused <b>shortening</b> of skeletal <b>elements,</b> joint fusion, and delayed chondrocyte maturation, with consequent inhibition of matrix mineralization, metalloprotease expression, and marrow/bone formation. In good agreement, misexpression of Frzb- 1 or a dominant-negative form of LEF- 1 in cultured chondrocytes maintained the cells at an immature stage. Instead, misexpression of Wnt- 8 or a constitutively active LEF- 1 strongly promoted chondrocyte maturation, hypertrophy, and calcification. Immunostaining revealed that the distribution of endogenous Wnt mediator β-catenin changes dramatically in vivo and in vitro, from largely cytoplasmic in immature proliferating and prehypertrophic chondrocytes to nuclear in hypertrophic mineralizing chondrocytes. Misexpression of Frzb- 1 prevented β-catenin nuclear relocalization in chondrocytes in vivo or in vitro. The data demonstrate that Frzb- 1 exerts a strong influence on limb skeletogenesis and is a powerful and direct modulator of chondrocyte maturation, phenotype, and function. Phases of skeletogenesis, such as terminal chondrocyte maturation and joint formation, appear to be particularly dependent on Wnt signaling and thus very sensitive to Frzb- 1 antagonistic action...|$|R
40|$|AbstractRunx 2 /Cbfa 1 plays {{a central}} role in {{skeletal}} development as demonstrated by the absence of osteoblasts/bone in mice with inactivated Runx 2 /Cbfa 1 alleles. To further investigate the role of Runx 2 in cartilage differentiation and to assess the potential of Runx 2 to induce bone formation, we cloned chicken Runx 2 and overexpressed it in chick embryos using a retroviral system. Infected chick wings showed multiple phenotypes consisting of (1) joint fusions, (2) expansion of carpal <b>elements,</b> and (3) <b>shortening</b> of skeletal <b>elements.</b> In contrast, bone formation was not affected. To investigate the function of Runx 2 /Cbfa 1 during cartilage development, we have generated transgenic mice that express a dominant negative form of Runx 2 in cartilage. The selective inactivation of Runx 2 in chondrocytes results in a severe shortening of the limbs due to a disturbance in chondrocyte differentiation, vascular invasion, osteoclast differentiation, and periosteal bone formation. Analysis of the growth plates in transgenic mice and in chick limbs shows that Runx 2 is a positive regulator of chondrocyte differentiation and vascular invasion. The results further indicate that Runx 2 promotes chondrogenesis either by maintaining or by initiating early chondrocyte differentiation. Furthermore, Runx 2 is essential but not sufficient to induce osteoblast differentiation. To analyze the role of runx genes in skeletal development, we performed in situ hybridization with Runx 2 - and Runx 3 -specific probes. Both genes were coexpressed in cartilaginous condensations, indicating a cooperative role in the regulation of early chondrocyte differentiation and thus explaining the expansion/maintenance of cartilage in the carpus and joints of infected chick limbs...|$|R
