40|$|The {{particular}} study case in {{this thesis}} is the shock test performed on the LISA Pathfinder satellite conducted in a laboratory environment on a dedicated test bed: Vega <b>Shock</b> <b>Test</b> <b>Apparatus</b> (VESTA). This test is considered fully representative to study shock levels produced by fairing jettisoning event at Vega Launcher Vehicle, which induces high shock loads towards the satellite. In the frame of this thesis, some transient response analyses have been conducted in MSC Nastran, and a shock simulation tool for the VESTA test configuration has been developed. The simulation tool is based on Nastran Direct Transient Response Analysis solver (SOL 109), and {{is representative of the}} upper composite of Vega with the LISA Pathfinder coupled to it. Post-processing routines of transient response signals were conducted in Dynaworks which served to calculate Shock Response Spectra (SRS). The simulation tool is a model of forcing function parameters for transient analysis which adequately correlates with the shock real test data, in order to understand how the effect of shock generated by the launcher is seen in the satellite and its sub-systems. Since available computation resources are limited the parameters for analysis were optimised for computation time, file size, memory capacity,  and model complexity. The forcing function represents a release of the HSS clamp band which is responsible for fairing jettisoning, thus the parameters which were studied are mostly concerning the modelling of this event. Among many investigated, those which visibly improved SRS correlation are radial forcing function shape, implementation of axial impulse, clamp band loading geometry and refined loading scheme. Integration time step duration and analysis duration were also studied and found to improve correlation.   From each analysis, the qualifying shock environment was then derived by linear scaling in proportion of the applied preload, and considering a qualification margin of 3 dB. Consecutive tracking of structural responses along shock propagation path exposed gradual changes in responses pattern and revealed an important property that a breathing mode (n = 0) {{at the base of a}} conical Adapter translates into an axial input to the spacecraft. The parametrisation itself was based on responses registered at interfaces located in near-field (where the clamp band is located and forcing function is applied) and medium-field with respect to the shock event location. Following shock propagation path, the final step was the analysis of shock responses inside the satellite located in a far-field region, which still revealed a very good correlation of results. Thus, it can be said that parametrisation process was adequate, and the developed shock simulation tool can be qualified. However, due to the nature of shock, the tool cannot fully replace VESTA laboratory test, but can support shock assessment process and preparation to such test. In the last part of the thesis, the implementation of some finite element model improvements is investigated. Majority of the panels in spacecraft interior exhibited shock over-prediction due to finite element model limitation. Equipment units modelled as lump masses rigidly attached with RBE 2 elements to the panel surface are a source of such local over-predictions. Thus, some of the units were remodelled and transient responses were reinvestigated. It was found that remodelling with either solid elements, or lump mass connected to RBE 3 element and reinforced by RBE 2 element, can significantly improve local transient responses. This conclusion is in line with conclusions found in ECSS Shock Handbook...|$|E

A brief history on the research of <b>shock</b> <b>testing</b> of naval shipboard equipment as well as major means in evaluating anti-shock performance of warship equipment is introduced first in this paper. Three prevailing <b>shock</b> <b>test</b> methods: UNDEX <b>testing,</b> virtual <b>shock</b> trial and land-based <b>test</b> with <b>shock</b> <b>test</b> machines are presented with the focus on the advances in <b>shock</b> <b>test</b> machines in US and Europe. Comparison of current <b>shock</b> <b>testing</b> facilities is also given. Moreover, some new concepts of <b>shock</b> <b>test</b> machines are reviewed as well, and three major directions of the development of <b>shock</b> <b>test</b> machines are concluded. The first trend is that <b>shock</b> <b>testing</b> machines are required to generate positive and negative shock pulse to simulate real UNDEX environment made up of shock wave followed by bubble pulse and structural whipping. The second is that <b>shock</b> <b>test</b> machines can test heavy equipments, and the last is that shock pulses can be controlled and customized conveniently. ...|$|R
50|$|<b>Shock</b> <b>testing</b> {{typically}} {{falls into}} two categories, classical <b>shock</b> <b>testing</b> and pyroshock or ballistic <b>shock</b> <b>testing.</b> Classical <b>shock</b> <b>testing</b> {{consists of the}} following shock impulses: half sine, haversine, sawtooth wave, and trapezoid. Pyroshock and ballistic <b>shock</b> <b>tests</b> are specialized and are not considered classical shocks. Classical shocks can be performed on Electro Dynamic (ED) Shakers, Free Fall Drop Tower or Pneumatic Shock Machines. A classical shock impulse is created when the shock machine table changes direction abruptly. This abrupt change in direction causes a rapid velocity change which creates the shock impulse.|$|R

40|$|Components used {{in space}} {{are subject to}} high {{frequency}} and high amplitude mechanical shocks that occur during the launch and separation phases of the space vehicles. <b>Shock</b> <b>testing</b> is done to ensure that components can withstand the shock events. A shock can be described by an acceleration and time history, but in <b>shock</b> <b>testing</b> {{it is difficult to}} manage and quantify shocks by only looking at the acceleration and time history of a shock. Instead, a shock response spectrum is used, which plots the peak accelerations of multiple single degree of freedom systems with their own unique frequencies over a range of frequencies, usually from 100 Hz to 10 000 Hz. The shocks that occur in space can reach up to acceleration levels of 10 000 g’s. The main objective of this work was to develop a software application for the mechanical <b>shock</b> <b>testing</b> system at Tartu Observatory.

Finally, this <b>test</b> <b>apparatus</b> was used to conduct a biaxial tensile test under different pre-bending loading and a tensile test at different rates; the image of the fracture of the test-piece was acquired by a scanning electron microscope and analyzed.

Bending speed could exert a positive and beneficial influence on tensile strength but weaken fracture elongation.
