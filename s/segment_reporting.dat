This note contributes to the debate by examining disclosure practices in the UK where a well-established regulatory framework nevertheless upholds the right of corporate managers to exercise discretion. A specific template is developed to examine simultaneously the content of the <b>segment</b> <b>report</b> and the operating and financial review (OFR) to detect disclosure patterns.

40|$|In this paper, the {{unilateral}} and reciprocal {{impact of}} transfer relations between controlling and reporting according to IFRS is analysed, using {{the example of}} internal and external <b>segment</b> <b>reporting.</b> In contrast to the pragmatic treatment of this problem by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), the transfer relations are examined in this paper on a theoretically substantiated basis. For this purpose, transfer hypotheses are formulated as general statements on the determinants and effects of reporting. They form {{the elements of a}} reporting theory. The analysis focuses on the full management approach, which has a number of effects for the transfer relation between internal and external <b>segment</b> <b>reporting.</b> In detail, on the basis of transfer hypotheses, the effects for controlling, for the structure of <b>segment</b> <b>reporting,</b> and for the auditing of <b>segment</b> <b>reporting</b> are presented and analysed. As the IFRS do not constitute a settled system of rules, open questions as to such a body of rules are also discussed. In doing so – also on the basis of transfer hypotheses – alternatives of the improvement of <b>segment</b> <b>reporting</b> are analysed. This is done with the aid of reliability hypotheses, valuation hypotheses, simplification hypotheses, steering hypotheses and addressees hypotheses. In this way, the theoretical substantiation of the transfer relations between controlling and reporting according to IFRS is scientifically established, both for the present structure of accounting and for future design alternatives...|$|E

40|$|This study {{analyzes}} {{the existence of}} the diversification discount in the German stock market. Recent examples show that the degree of diversification is an important managerial decision variable and highlight the importance of the topic for practitioners. The diversification discount was extensively studied and documented in the U. S., but there is still a huge debate in the literature over the reasons for the discount. Up to now, there is only little and contradicting evidence for Germany. One potential reason is that existing studies at least in part use <b>segment</b> <b>reports</b> from years before the year 2000, i. e. before the legal basis for <b>segment</b> <b>reports</b> was introduced. In our study, we document a significant discount between 5 % and 10 % for diversified firms compared to focussed firms in the period from 2000 to 2004. However, further analyses show that diversification per se is not the only reason for the discount. Furthermore, we find that the measures used in the literature to calculate the discount lead, if anything, to an overestimation of the discount. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{nature of}} a {{corporate}} takeover often leads to the contraction {{in the number of}} companies operating in a given industry classification, along with the contraction in the amount of formal financial statements produced by the companies in that industry. Since 1985 Australian diversified companies are required to break their operations down into industry and geographical segments, so it would be expected that companies which diversify their operations through a corporate takeover would be forerunners in the adoption of this relatively new accounting standard on <b>segment</b> <b>reporting.</b> While previous studies have both declared the benefits of <b>segment</b> <b>reporting</b> to report users, and exposed some preconceived problems of its application in practice, there has not been any work on the 2 ̆ 7 usefulness 1 of <b>segment</b> <b>reporting</b> as a form of reporting that will compensate shareholder users for the information loss suffered during a corporate takeover. This study endeavours to determine this, by questioning shareholders of companies that have been involved in takeovers in a period subsequent to the application date of the <b>segment</b> <b>reporting</b> standard, and obtaining their views on the usefulness of the post-takeover segment reports produced by their companies. A link is discovered to exist between shareholder dissatisfaction with <b>segment</b> <b>reporting</b> and the non-practice of creating a new segment in the post-takeover annual report for the target acquired. The underlying assumption that the practice of new segment creation after a takeover is influenced by the type of takeover undertaken is supported by the study. Regardless of whether or not a company is diversified before the takeover, the findings show that a corporate acquirer in a takeover is less likely to create a new industry or geographical segment for the target acquired if they are involved in horizontal or vertical takeovers than if they are involved in diversified takeovers. In these situations, <b>segment</b> <b>reporting</b> is found to not compensate shareholders for the loss of information incurred by them in these types of takeovers...|$|E

As a result of the diversity of enterprises’ products and services users of financial statements needs segments’ operating results which are generated by the functions of enterprises.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the value relevance of segment information for both public and private sector banks in India. In doing so, this paper examines a rapidly developing economy and perhaps its most critical sector during this period of strong economic growth. Design/methodology/approach: In this study uses the simplified Ohlson model, for a sample of 136 private sector and public sector banks for the period 2007 - 2010 in India. Findings: The paper finds that public sector banks have higher share prices, higher earnings and more equity compared with private sector banks. Segment earnings data is highly value relevant for both sectors; however, segment equity data is only marginally value relevant for Indian banks. The number of segments is also value relevant and associated with higher share prices. Originality/value: The results of this study contribute additional evidence to the literature on <b>segment</b> <b>reporting</b> by studying the effect of adoption of <b>segment</b> <b>reporting</b> in an emerging market. Findings from the paper are particularly relevant as India is currently in the process of changing its <b>segment</b> <b>reporting</b> requirements and moving to an IFRS-based segment standard...|$|E

Moreover, we find that in both countries CSD is driven especially by reporting incentives associated with profitability and foreign sales, but not by proprietary costs. Further, the manager's choice of the number of reported segments is an important factor affecting CSD.

The objective {{of this study is}} to determine how IAS 14 R affected the segment disclosure practices of companies claiming to comply with IAS. This paper examines the following questions: (1) What items of information are disclosed under IAS 14 and IAS 14 R? Was there a gain or a loss of information disclosed for business and geographic segments with the implementation of IAS 14 R? (2) Has the number of business and geographic segments reported by companies changed with the implementation of IAS 14 R? (3) Are companies disclosing the items required by IAS 14 R? (4) Are companies' <b>segment</b> <b>reporting</b> practices related to size, country of domicile, industry, international listing status, and having a then-Big Five auditor? We find that the impact of IAS 14 R is mixed. Companies are responding to IAS 14 R, but not wholly embracing it.
