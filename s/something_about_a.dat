25|$|Local ambiguities persist {{only for}} {{a short amount of}} time as an {{utterance}} is heard or written and are resolved during the course of the utterance so the complete utterance has only one interpretation. Examples include sentences like The critic wrote the book was enlightening, which is ambiguous when The critic wrote the book has been encountered, but was enlightening remains to be processed. Then, the sentence could end, stating that the critic is the author of the book, or it could go on to clarify that the critic wrote <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> book. The ambiguity ends at was enlightening, which determines that the second alternative is correct.|$|E
500|$|Film {{scholars}} and historians view Citizen Kane as Welles's {{attempt to create}} a new style of filmmaking by studying various forms of film making, and combining them all into one. However, Welles stated that his love for cinema began only when he started the work on the film. When asked where he got the confidence as a first-time director to direct a film so radically different from contemporary cinema, he responded, [...] "Ignorance, ignorance, sheer ignorance—you know there's no confidence to equal it. It's only when you know <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> profession, I think, that you're timid or careful." ...|$|E

500|$|For a time, Anderson {{directed}} Fitzgerald {{toward the}} relative safety of Whitefish Bay; then at 4:39p.m., McSorley contacted the USCG station in Grand Marais, Michigan, to inquire whether the Whitefish Point light and navigation beacon were operational. The USCG replied that their monitoring equipment indicated that both instruments were inactive. McSorley then hailed any {{ships in the}} Whitefish Point area to report {{the state of the}} navigational aids, receiving an answer from Captain Cedric Woodard of Avafors between 5:00 and 5:30p.m. that the Whitefish Point light was on but not the radio beacon. Woodard testified to the Marine Board that he overheard McSorley say, [...] "Don't allow nobody on deck," [...] as well as <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> vent that Woodard could not understand. Some time later, McSorley told Woodard, [...] "I have a 'bad list,' I have lost both radars, and am taking heavy seas over the deck in one of the worst seas I have ever been in." ...|$|E
500|$|Nolan {{designed}} Two-Face's {{appearance in}} the film {{as one of the}} least disturbing, explaining, [...] "When we looked at less extreme versions of it, they were too real and more horrifying. When you look at a film like Pirates of the Caribbean– something like that, there's <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> very fanciful, very detailed visual effect, that I think is more powerful and less repulsive." [...] Framestore created 120 computer-generated shots of Two-Face's scarred visage. Nolan felt using make-up would look unrealistic, as it adds to the face, unlike real burn victims. Framestore acknowledged they rearranged the positions of bones, muscles and joints to make the character look more dramatic. For each shot, three 720-pixel HD cameras were set up at different angles on set to fully capture Aaron Eckhart's performance. Eckhart wore markers on his face and a prosthetic skullcap, which acted as a lighting reference. A few shots of the skullcap were kept in the film. Framestore also integrated shots of Bale and Eckhart into that of the exploding building where Dent is burned. It was difficult simulating fire on Eckhart because it is inherently unrealistic for only half of something to burn.|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reaction}} was not universally affirmative, but Richard Corliss of Time stated that Spielberg [...] "has energized each frame with allusive legerdemain and an intelligent density {{of images and}} emotions." [...] Janet Maslin from The New York Times called the film [...] "a visual splendor, a heroic adventurousness and an immense scope that make it unforgettable." [...] Julie Salamon of The Wall Street Journal wrote that the film as [...] "an edgy, intelligent script by playwright Tom Stoppard, Spielberg has made an extraordinary film out of Mr. Ballard's extraordinary war experience." [...] J. Hoberman from The Village Voice decried that the serious subject was undermined by Spielberg's [...] "shamelessly kiddiecentric" [...] approach. Roger Ebert gave a mixed reaction, [...] "Despite the emotional potential in the story, it didn't much move me. Maybe, like the kid, I decided that no world where you can play with airplanes can be all that bad." [...] On his TV show with Gene Siskel, Ebert said that the film [...] "is basically {{a good idea for}} a film that never gets off the ground." [...] Siskel added, [...] "I don't know what the film is about. It's so totally confused and taking things from different parts. On one hand, if it wants to say <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> child's-eye view of war, you got a movie made by John Boorman called Hope and Glory that was just released that is much better, and much more daring in showing the whimsy that children's view of war is. On the other hand, this film wants to hedge its bet and make it like an adventure film, so you've got like Indiana Jones with the John Malkovich character helping the little kid through all the fun of war. I don't know what Spielberg wanted to do." ...|$|E
