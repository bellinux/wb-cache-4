50|$|Both models {{feature a}} slipper clutch to reduce wheel spin during hard engine braking and a shaft drive system to {{transmit}} {{power to the}} rear wheel. The shaft drive system is bolted to the frame on a <b>swinging</b> <b>pivot</b> mount. Engineers developed a two part shaft connected by a spline which allows system to flex under load mimicking the feel and performance benefits of a traditional chain drive.|$|R
50|$|Yuka Sunada is Dandoh's {{friend who}} follows {{him to play}} golf. She {{constantly}} worries about Dandoh, but also gets excited after his accomplishments. Yuka's <b>swinging</b> <b>pivot</b> is firm, which allows her to keep her form when under pressure and even when being harassed during her first tournament game. She has a calm and kind personality. Yuka shows talent in golf like Aoba whom she hold strong feelings for.|$|R
50|$|Spreader {{design and}} tuning {{can be quite}} complex. The {{spreaders}} may be fixed (rigid) or <b>swinging</b> (<b>pivoted</b> at the mast). The purpose of the spreaders is to control, by either limiting, or inducing, bend into the spar {{so that when the}} windward shroud is loaded the mast achieves the desired bend characteristics. The spreaders may be designed to be angled in a way that either forces bend in to the spar or reduces bend, depending on the desired results.|$|R

50|$|The {{railroad}} promptly began {{construction of}} a one-track bridge, completed in October 1902. This bridge has a 226 ft <b>swing</b> span <b>pivoting</b> on a cylindrical stone pier at mid-stream, flanked by a 97 ft approach span on either side. A wooden pile fender protects the pivot pier and the opened swing span from collisions with boat traffic on the river.|$|R
2500|$|On Monday, May 8, 1916, Grahamona {{was seriously}} damaged while {{passing through the}} draw of Morrison Street bridge in Portland. [...] The Morrison bridge {{at that time was}} a <b>swinging</b> structure, <b>pivoting</b> on a caisson to allow river traffic to draw. [...] Grahamona was half-way through the draw, when the swinging-structure, which, if {{properly}} functioning, would have stopped when fully open, continued to swing around.|$|R

It also has a close ratio gear-box fitted as standard and a crankshaft flywheel that is heavier and Nissin front brake calipers.|$|R
5000|$|A {{compound}} pendulum (or physical pendulum) is {{one where}} the rod is not massless, and may have extended size; that is, an arbitrarily shaped rigid body <b>swinging</b> by a <b>pivot.</b> In this case the pendulum's period depends on its moment of inertia [...] around the pivot point.|$|R
2500|$|Opened in January 1891, {{the first}} Madison Street Bridge was a <b>swing</b> bridge which <b>pivoted</b> {{on a large}} central {{trunnion}} mounted on a piling structure in the river.

5000|$|A swingarm, or [...] "swinging arm" [...] (UK), {{originally}} {{known as}} a <b>swing</b> fork or <b>pivoted</b> fork, is {{the main component of}} the rear suspension of most modern motorcycles and ATVs. It is used to hold the rear axle firmly, while pivoting vertically, to allow the suspension to absorb bumps in the road.|$|R
5|$|After {{the cavalry}} {{breakthrough}} on the coast, the XXI Corps would advance {{to capture the}} headquarters of the Ottoman Eighth Army at Tulkarm together with sections of the lateral railway line in the Judean Hills between Tulkarm and Nablus, a branch of the Jezreel Valley railway, which supplied the two Ottoman Armies, including the important railway junction at Messudieh in the Judean Hills. The infantry divisions were to continue their attack by <b>swinging</b> north–east, <b>pivoting</b> on their right to push the defenders back out of their trenches away from the coast and back into the Judean Hills towards Messudieh.|$|R

25|$|Swing {{boarding}} is {{the activity}} where a skateboard deck is suspended from a pivot point above the rider {{which allows the}} rider to <b>swing</b> about that <b>pivot</b> point. The board swings in an arc which is a similar movement to riding a half pipe. The incorporation of a harness and frame allows the rider to perform turns spins all while flying though the air.|$|R
5000|$|Designed by Brian Jones and Bernard Hooper Engineering, the Bonneville T140AV, {{initially}} {{for police}} use featured an anti-vibration system, the <b>swing</b> arm being <b>pivoted</b> {{and attached to}} the engine, which was itself isolated on rubber mounts from the chassis [...] Engine balance was also revised. Also produced in 'Executive', TSS as well as TR7V Tiger forms, the T140AV was built between 1981 and 1983.|$|R

5|$|After {{the cavalry}} {{breakthrough}} on the coast, the XXI Corps would advance {{to capture the}} headquarters of the Ottoman Eighth Army at Tulkarm and cut the railway lines. Sections of the lateral rail line in the Judean Hills between Tulkarm and Nablus and a branch of the Jezreel Valley railway, were to be denied to the Seventh and Eighth Ottoman Armies. These lines, including the important railway junction at Messudieh, transported their supplies into the Judean Hills.

50|$|The Hillman Imp {{designers}} {{learned from}} {{the problems with the}} Corvair, having crashed one at a relatively low speed, and designed their rear-engined car with semi-trailing arm suspension at the rear. To attain correct handling balance, they actually used swing axle geometry at the front, with the steering pivots mounted at the outer ends of single swing wishbones. These caused too much understeer and uneven tyre wear, and modifications were made to reduce the positive camber of the front wheels by lowering the <b>swing</b> axle <b>pivot</b> points. Aftermarket kits were also available to do this, and an inexpensive alternative was to insert a tapered shim to change the inclination of the kingpin carrier relative to the wishbone.|$|R
50|$|It {{was opened}} to traffic on 2 July 1889 and saw active service until 1975. The {{innovative}} {{design of a}} <b>swing</b> bridge <b>pivoting</b> on a central drum was an unusual method of allowing river traffic to pass up shallow Ross Creek. The central swing allowed large ships to pass through in the deeper, left hand channel, while smaller craft could take the shallower right lane. During the years after the bridge was opened the commercial centre of Townsville expanded and the warehouse district was gradually confined closer {{to the mouth of}} Ross Creek. Ships were no longer required to move up the creek to unload. By 1924 the swing section had ceased to function because of movement of the central drum.|$|R
50|$|Looking {{to improve}} the {{handling}} of the Austin 7, in 1933 Leslie Ballamy (1904 - 1991) split the front beam axle into twin <b>swing</b> arms that <b>pivoted</b> from a central joint. It is for this simple innovation that Ballamy became renowned. Soon afterwards, he put into production his swing axles for the Austin and the Ford 8, 10 and V8 models. Ballamy also converted more up-market cars such as Allard, Bugatti, Delage and Bentley.|$|R
50|$|An {{inverted}} {{roller coaster}} is {{a roller coaster}} in which the train runs under the track with the seats directly attached to the wheel carriage. This latter attribute is what sets it apart from the older suspended coaster, which runs under the track, but <b>swings</b> via a <b>pivoting</b> bar attached to the wheel carriage. The coaster type's inverted orientation distinguishes it from a traditional roller coaster, where the passengers' legs rather than arms are exposed.|$|R
2500|$|Aesthetic Group Gymnastics (AGG) was {{developed}} from the Finnish [...] "naisvoimistelu". It differs from Rhythmic Gymnastics in that body movement is large and continuous and teams are larger. Athletes do not use apparatus in international AGG competitions compared to Rhythmic Gymnastics where ball, ribbon, hoop and clubs are used on the floor area. The sport requires physical qualities such as flexibility, balance, speed, strength, coordination and sense of rhythm where movements of the body are emphasized through the flow, expression and aesthetic appeal. A good performance is characterized by uniformity and simultaneity. The competition program consists of versatile and varied body movements, such as body waves, <b>swings,</b> balances, <b>pivots,</b> jumps and leaps, dance steps, and lifts. The International Federation of Aesthetic Group Gymnastics (IFAGG) was established in 2003.|$|R
50|$|Portumna {{is served}} with a five-span road bridge over the Shannon. This was {{designed}} by C. E. Stanier of London, and completed in 1911, with a central section resting on Hayes's Island which divides the river into two channels. The steel structure of the main bridge and <b>pivotting</b> <b>swing</b> bridge over the navigation channel are of technical and engineering interest, {{and it is the}} largest early-twentieth century swing bridge in Europe.. The opening section was replaced in October 2008.|$|R
5000|$|These {{were simple}} engines {{compared}} to modern engine design. However, they incorporate some very clever designs in several areas, many times because the designer {{was attempting to}} circumvent infringing a patent for a particular part of the engine. This is particularly true {{in the area of}} the governor. Governors are centrifugal, <b>swinging</b> arm, <b>pivot</b> arm, and many others. The actuator mechanism to govern speed is also varied depending on patents existing and the governor used. See, for example, U.S. Patents 543,157 from 1895 or 980,658 from 1911. However accomplished, the governor has one job - to control the speed of the engine. In modern engines, power output is controlled by throttling the flow of the air through the intake by means of a butterfly valve; the only exception to this being in diesels and Valvetronic petrol engines.|$|R
50|$|What makes L4B unique is its swing feature. A {{section of}} the bridge <b>swings</b> on a <b>pivot</b> point, opening up two 150-foot- wide lanes for river traffic to pass through, similar to a gate. The bridge is {{operated}} from a tower and originally ran on steam power. Opening and closing the swing bridge takes about five minutes, which allowed the railroad to build a permanent track across the river to La Crosse without interfering with the towboats and barges that travel {{up and down the}} Mississippi.|$|R
50|$|The {{swing bridge}} on Locke Avenue over the Raccoon Creek was 154 ft long. It was a single-lane, center <b>pivot</b> <b>swing</b> bridge that carried {{vehicular}} traffic over Raccoon Creek. The swing span {{was designed to}} manually rotate at its center pivot pier, which allowed marine traffic to pass underneath. It was constructed in 1911. The swing span had been locked in the closed position since 1971. The main channel of the Raccoon Creek was under the northern span of the bridge {{and has not been}} dredged since April 1965.|$|R

5000|$|Beginning in {{the late}} 1970s, the Corps’ New Orleans Board (OLB) began {{identifying}} and examining hurricane protection alternatives for the outfall canals. Through a series of Design Memorandums {{in the late}} 1980s and early 1990s, the Corps recommended building a prototype gate plan employing self-actuating butter-fly check valves at the Orleans Avenue and London Avenue canals. Butterfly gates are hydraulically operated gates that <b>swing</b> on a <b>pivot</b> and close if storm surge threatens to enter the canals. (It is instructive {{to note that the}} gates alternative did not include auxiliary pump stations like those installed after Hurricane Katrina.) ...|$|R
50|$|Different {{from the}} design {{found in most}} {{conventional}} bobblehead dolls, not {{the head of the}} figure nods or wobbles on an otherwise static figure. Instead, the Wackel-Elvis figure is suspended from an elastic band connected to a suction cup attached to the windshield or rear window of a vehicle. The waist and left shoulder of the figure are equipped with flexible metal spring joints while its right foot stands on a pointed nail. This design prompts the figure to <b>swing</b> its hips, <b>pivot</b> around its vertical axis and shake its left arm up and down while the vehicle is in motion, creating an effect that resembles Elvis Presley performing on stage.|$|R
50|$|Portumna bridge lies east of {{the town}} of Portumna, in County Galway, Ireland. It is a five-span road bridge, which carries the N65 across the River Shannon to Lehinch in County Tipperary. The present bridge was {{designed}} by C. E. Stanier of London, and completed in 1911, with a central section resting on Hayes's Island which divides the river into two channels. The structure of the main bridge, consisting of steel girders supported by concrete filled cast iron cylinders, and the <b>pivoting</b> <b>swing</b> bridge over the navigation channel, are of technical and engineering interest. The house on Hayes Island, accessed from the bridge, was the bridge operators house and pre-dates the present bridge.The opening section was replaced in October 2008.|$|R

50|$|The 2807 ft bridge has a <b>swing</b> span, which <b>pivots</b> on {{its base}} {{to allow for}} the passage of taller ships. The bridge carries two {{railroad}} tracks, which are used by BNSF, Union Pacific Railroad, and Amtrak. It is one of only two surviving swing-span bridges in the Portland metropolitan area, which once had several bridges of that type. The other survivor is another BNSF bridge located nearby, on the same line and built at the same time, the Oregon Slough Railroad Bridge (also known as BNSF Railway Bridge 8.8). The 9.6 in the name is the distance, in miles, from Portland's Union Station, the same as for Bridge 5.1 (across the Willamette River) and Bridge 8.8 on the same line.|$|R
