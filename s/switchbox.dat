40|$|Incremental {{physical}} CAD is encountered {{frequently in}} the socalled engineering change order (ECO) process in which design changes are made typically late in the design process in order to correct logical and/or technological problems in the circuit. As far as routing is concerned, in order {{to capitalize on the}} enormous resources and time already spent on routing the circuit, and to meet time-to-market requirements, it is desirable to re-route only the ECO-affected portion of the circuit, while minimizing any routing changes in the much larger unaffected part of the circuit. Incremental re-routing also needs to be fast and to effectively use available routing resources. In this paper, we develop a complete incremental routing methodology for FPGAs using a novel approach called bump and refit (B&R); B&R was initially proposed in [4] in the much simpler context of extending some nets by a segment (for the purpose of fault tolerance) for FPGAs with simple i-to-i <b>switchboxes.</b> Here we significantly extend this concept to global and detailed incremental routing for FPGAs with complex <b>switchboxes</b> such as those in Lucent's ORCA and Xilinx's Virtex series. We also introduce new concepts such as B&R cost estimation during global routing, and determination of the optimal subnet set to bump for each bumped net, which we obtain using an efficient dynamic programming formulation. The basic B&R idea in our algorithms is to re-arrange some portions of some existing nets on other tracks within their current channels to find valid routings for the incrementally changed circuit without requiring any extra routing resources (i. e., completely unused tracks), and with little effect on the electrical properties of existing nets.

40|$|We have {{developed}} a hop-based complete detailed router ROAD-HOP that uses the Bump & Refit () approach to route a FPGA circuit in a near-optimal manner. This approach is based on generating a minimum-spanning tree (MST) from the complete pin-topin graph of each net with each edge cost based {{on a combination of}} its contribution to the net length, channel congestion and potential average “bumping ” cost in the channels in which the edge lies. Using the MST, a hop-based routing of each net is performed that attempts to minimize the combination of net length, number of hops and total number of tracks needed in the FPGA. Given each net’s global route, a FPGA detailed router can minimize net delays by minimizing the number of hops or equivalently the number of track switchings in complex <b>switchboxes</b> of current FPGAs—hopbased routing can model routing using complex <b>switchboxes.</b> By minimizing the number of hops and total net length, ROAD-HOP minimizes net delay. Note that ROAD-HOP can only be compared to another detailed router and we compare it to the best previous detailed router SEGA for the VPR architecture. We use the output of the VPR global router as input to both ROAD-HOP and SEGA. Our new algorithm achieves significantly better results than SEGA with respect to the number of tracks needed and the circuit speed. Across a number of benchmark circuits, our algorithm needs about 8 % fewer tracks than SEGA. Furthermore, the average net delay of the routing generated by our algorithm is 34 % less than that of SEGA, and is 52 % less for the longest net...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The novel {{design of}} {{high-speed}} and low-energy FPGA routing architecture consisting of appropriate wire segments and multiple Switch Boxes is introduced.

The proposed methodology for designing the high performance interconnection architecture is fully-supported by the software tool called EX-VPR. For both steps, the selection criterion for a minimal Energy×Delay Product is chosen. Depending on the localized performance and energy consumption requirements of each specific region of FPGA architecture, we derive a set of corresponding spatial routing information of the applications mapped onto FPGA.

There {{is a need to}} support several complex applications for navigation and image processing in a rapidly responsive on-board FPGA-based computer. This requires exploring and combining several design concepts such as systolic arrays, hardware-software partitioning, and partial dynamic reconfiguration. A microprocessor/co-processor design that can accelerate two single precision oating-point algorithms, extended Kalman lter and a discrete wavelet transform, is presented. This research makes three key contributions. (i) A polymorphic systolic array framework comprising of recofigurable partial region-based sockets to accelerate algorithms amenable to being mapped onto linear systolic arrays. When implemented on a low end Xilinx Virtex 4 SX 35 FPGA the design provides a speedup of at least 4. 18 x and 6. 61 x over a state of the art microprocessor used in spacecraft systems for the extended Kalman lter and discrete wavelet transform algorithms, respectively.

5000|$|Cryoloops are cooling {{devices that}} use 23 gauge {{stainless}} steel hypodermic tubing shaped into a loop that can fit into sulci {{or on the}} gyri of the section of interest of the cerebral cortex. A pump draws methanol from a reservoir, and the fluid flows through a dry ice bath to be cooled. The cooled methanol flows through Teflon tubing into the cryoloop’s metal tubing, which is secured by passing through a threaded post. A thermocouple connector receives the wires from a microthermocouple {{at the base of}} the loop (where the inflow and outflow tubes meet) that measures the tubing temperature. The post, the thermocouple connector, and heat-shrink Teflon tubing, which envelopes the microthermocouple wires and the inflow and outflow tubes between the post and microthermocouple, are sealed using dental acrylic. [...] After implantation, when the animal is not participating in an experiment, a protective cap is placed over the open inflow and outflow tubes. During experimentation, the inflow and outflow tubes are attached to the Teflon tubing connected to the reservoir setup. The thermocouple connector is connected to a <b>switchbox</b> and a thermometer so cryoloop temperature can be monitored. [...] Cryoloops are considered the most adaptable form of cooling available due to the customization necessary for each experiment. The investigator must form the functional cooling loop of the cryoloop to fit with whatever part of the brain he/she wishes to study, and several cryoloops can be used for one brain. Each device can cool a range of tissue areas from less than 10 mm3 to 75 mm3. Although it may be considered a hassle to have to form each device for each section of interest, this customization allows for a more controlled region of cooling and for more efficient animal use because of the possibility for multiple cooling sites within each animal. Head restraint is unnecessary because the loops are chronically implanted and secured to the skull by screws and dental acrylic.|$|E
