It opens with a birds-eye view shot from the ground, showing several buildings and trees; just before the first verse, a <b>short</b> <b>shot</b> of Amuro is seen. The first verse opens with Amuro walking down a street in Los Angeles, California, singing to the track. During the verse, intercut scenes include various shadows of children holding instruments behind Amuro. The chorus opens with Amuro walking down along a bridge with the children playing their instruments behind her. When the second chorus starts, the camera pans over to several buildings and landscapes around Los Angeles. The camera then pans into several individuals citizens in the city: an elderly couple, {{a man in his}} car, a couple who have just finished surfing, and a woman walking her dog.|$|E
500|$|Another {{well-known}} duel in the American West {{happened in}} Fort Worth, Texas, and {{was known as}} the Luke Short-Jim Courtright Duel. Timothy Isaiah [...] "Longhair Jim" [...] Courtright was running the T.I.C. Commercial agency in Fort Worth, which provided [...] "protection" [...] to gambling dens and saloons in return for a portion of their profits. At the same time, Luke Short, a former friend of Courtright's, was running the White Elephant Saloon and Jim was trying to get Short to utilize his services. But the Dodge City gunfighter told Courtright to [...] "go to Hell," [...] that he could do anything that was necessary {{to take care of his}} business. On February 8, 1887, the two quarreled, and with Bat Masterson at Short's side, Courtright and Short dueled in the street. They drew their pistols at close range, and Short fired first, blowing off Courtright's thumb. Courtright attempted the [...] "border shift", a move where a gunfighter switches his gun to his uninjured hand, but he was too slow. <b>Short</b> <b>shot</b> him in the chest, killing him.|$|E

On February 28, Storm confronted Short once again outside the Oriental Saloon. This time {{he pulled a}} [...]45 caliber revolver. But Storm was too slow and <b>Short</b> <b>shot</b> {{him in the chest}} at point-blank range, his muzzle flash setting Storms' clothes on fire. <b>Short</b> <b>shot</b> Storms again before his body hit the ground. George Parsons witnessed Storms' death and wrote in his journal, [...] "The faro games went right on as though nothing had happened." [...] Short was arrested but the shooting was ruled as self defense. Short left Tombstone in April and returned to Leadville, Colorado.|$|E

40|$|The {{geometric}} {{complexity and}} high fluid speeds involved in High Pressure Die Casting (HPDC) combine to give strongly three dimensional fluid flow with significant free surface fragmentation and splashing. A simulation method that has proved particularly suited to modelling HPDC is Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH). Materials are approximated by particles that {{are free to}} move around rather than by fixed grids, enabling more accurate prediction of fluid flows involving complex free surface motion. Three practical industrial examples of SPH simulated HPDC flows are presented; aluminium casting of a differential cover (automotive), an electronic housing and zinc casting of a door lock plate. These show significant detail in the fragmented fluid free surfaces. The validation of flow predictions coupled with heat transfer and solidification is an important area for such modelling. One approach is to use <b>short</b> <b>shots,</b> where insufficient metal {{is used in the}} casting or the casting shot is halted part way through to leave the die cavity partially filled. The frozen partial castings capture significant detail of the order of fill and about the flow structures occurring during filling. Validation can occur by matching experimental and simulated <b>short</b> <b>shots.</b> Here we explore the effect of die temperature, metal super-heat and volume fill on the <b>short</b> <b>shots.</b> The bulk features of the final solid castings are found to be in good agreement with the predictions, but the fine details appear to depend on surface behaviour of the solidifying metals...|$|R
