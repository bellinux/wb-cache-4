After the 1901 season, Kelley denied reports that he would jump from the Superbas to the Detroit Tigers of the American League (AL), the former Western League which had decided to compete with the NL by creating franchises in east coast cities that housed NL franchises. However, the opportunity to return to Baltimore proved irresistible to Kelley, and after the AL's successful 1901 season, he jumped from the Superbas to the Baltimore Orioles AL.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} impact of split-share {{structure}} reform on earnings management in China. A unique institutional feature of China was the co-existence of two types of share that endowed all shareholders with equal voting and cash flow rights but different tradability. This split-share structure significantly constrained the tradability of shares that led the Chinese Securities Regulatory Commission to make it mandatory for the conversion of non-tradable shares into tradable shares from 2006 onwards. We investigate whether such a conversion has any effect on information quality through reduced earnings manipulation. We specifically examine the incentives for earnings management during the reform-transition period. A unique feature of the split-share reform has been the requirement for non-tradable <b>share</b> <b>holders</b> to compensate the tradable <b>share</b> <b>holders.</b> We argue that the rational response from the non-tradable <b>share</b> <b>holders</b> would be to pay a lower consideration to tradable <b>share</b> <b>holders</b> by portraying a favorable picture through income-increasing earnings management. We also test for the effect {{of an increase in}} tradable shares on earnings management during the reform-transition and post-reform period...|$|R
25|$|A more {{accurate}} method of calculating this price {{is to look}} at the share price and dividend from the after-tax perspective of a <b>share</b> <b>holder.</b> The after-tax drop in the share price (or capital gain/loss) should be equivalent to the after-tax dividend. For example, if the tax of capital gains Tcg is 35%, and the tax on dividends Td is 15%, then a £1 dividend is equivalent to £0.85 of after-tax money. To get the same financial benefit from a capital loss, the after-tax capital loss value should equal £0.85. The pre-tax capital loss would be £0.85/(1-Tcg) = £0.85/(1-35%) = £0.85/65% = £1.30. In this case, a dividend of £1 has led to a larger drop in the share price of £1.30, because the tax rate on capital losses is higher than the dividend tax rate.|$|E
25|$|The IWW {{competed for}} {{the hearts and}} minds of members with the communist-dominated unions, and held union locals well into the 1940s. With the younger {{generation}} rapidly being assimilated into dominant Canadian society, the IWW and CTKL in Northwestern Ontario became friendship and mutual aid societies for an aging membership. In the late 1960s, following the last major wave of Finnish immigration to Canada, a new organization called the Finlandia Club of Port Arthur became the majority <b>share</b> <b>holder</b> of the hall. The new wave of immigrants were a generation separated from their Finnish-Canadian brethren and had no connection to the social struggles of the past. In addition, the newly arriving immigrants were either a-political or conservative, associating any left-wing activity with the brutality of Stalinism and the Finnish Winter War; this despite the fact that the Finnish Wobblies in Canada and the U.S. had actively supported and aided Finland in the war against the Soviet Union and denounced Bolshevism, from a libertarian socialist perspective, since the Kronstadt uprising.|$|E

40|$|A {{fundamental}} question in economics and finance is {{whether and how}} removing barriers is associated with any efficiency gains. We study this question using share issue privatization in China that {{took the form of}} the split share structure reform as our experimental setting. Prior to the reform, domestic A-shares are divided into tradable and non-tradable shares with identical cash flow and voting rights. Under the reform, non-tradable <b>share</b> <b>holders</b> negotiate a compensation plan with tradable <b>share</b> <b>holders</b> in order to make their shares tradable. We develop a general equilibrium model to help understand the determinants of compensation and the source of gains in the process of privatization. Our main predictions are: a) there are underpricing and compensation made by the non-tradable <b>share</b> <b>holders</b> to the tradable <b>share</b> <b>holders</b> if and only if the bargaining power of the former is weaker than the bargaining power of the latter; and b) the size of the compensation is decreasing in firm performance. Our second prediction contradicts conventional wisdom that fails to account for improved risk sharing due to the reform. Our empirical results using data from the reform are broadly consistent with our model’s prediction. We conclude tha...|$|R
