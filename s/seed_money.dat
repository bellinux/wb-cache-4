Development agencies realized that industrializing countries experienced the same urban problems as developed nations. The sister city movement provided a mechanism for communities to share their experiences and growing pains. TAP focused on a spiral out benefits system.

30|$|Zakah is an {{important}} institution in the socio-economic framework of Islam (Kusuma and Sukmana 2010; Muhamat et al. 2013) which is being underutilized for poverty reduction in many poor Muslim countries, though, is considered as third pillar of Islam. The main objective of zakah is to achieve socio-economic justice (Wahab and Rahman 2011). It is considered as an effective divine tool for alleviation of poverty because Islam looks upon poverty as a religious and social problem, since poverty pushes a person to lowliness, sin, and crime (Hassan 2006). But, as a divine tool, zakah fund can alleviate poverty effectively and promptly when it is used as <b>seed</b> (investment) <b>money</b> not as spent (consumption) money for the greater and better benefits of the poor of society; otherwise, it will produce no fruitful result.

40|$|Knowledge valorization, {{a process}} in which value is added to new {{knowledge}} in order to transform it into a new (improved) product, process or service in the market, becomes more and more important in the current economy and society. In particular for the health care area this can lead to large benefits for patients and society. This study investigated to what extent investing in financial, human and social capital influences the knowledge valorization performance of academic medical centers. A total of five European academic medical centers and their related knowledge valorization actors have been studied. 28 interviews have been conducted, complemented with a review of relevant literature. Firstly, all knowledge valorization landscapes have been mapped. This illustrated which actors are involved in the knowledge valorization process. It became clear that the process involves the deployment of fifteen knowledge valorization activities and that investing in financial capital, human capital, and social capital is needed to be able to deploy those activities. Regarding the knowledge valorization performance it became clear that all cases perform quite close to each other. In general human resources appeared to be most important for knowledge valorization around academic medical centers. The human resources have such a large influence on the valorization process mostly because of the broad range of needed expertise and the ability to bridge scientists with the industry. Financial capital and social capital alternate with each other regarding their importance for knowledge valorization. The importance of the social network of actors is mainly due to the possibility of adding expertise and the ability of testing ideas. The financial resources mainly contribute to knowledge valorization through the possibility to buy additional expertise and through the use of <b>seeding</b> <b>money</b> to invest in promising ideas. It also can be concluded that the three resources are dependent on one another, as one resource can help to get access to another resource. Several recommendations can be made for academic medical centers and their related actors: •	Invest most in developing human resources by training of employees in several skills and by hiring employees with a diverse set of qualities. •	Make sure that employees can make a career in the knowledge valorization field as reward and incentive. For instance a researcher could be promoted to associate professor or professor. •	Lobbying with governmental actors for financial resources meant for supporting knowledge valorization to avoid opportunities that remain unused...|$|R
40|$|It {{is often}} said that the root of Latin America’s {{underdevelopment}} lies in its statist tradition. 1 That tradition goes {{as far back as}} the pre-Columbian states, under which masses of laborers toiled for the benefit of the ruling classes; it includes three centuries of corporatist and mercantilist Ibero-Catholic rule; and it has been compounded in modern times by the elitist independent republics. Through a combination of institutional arrangements set in place at various times by the governing cliques and cultural values transmitted from generation to generation, Latin America’s tradition weighs so heavily against ideas of limited government, the rule of law, and personal responsibility that it would seem that an almost determinist view is justified in regarding liberty as beyond the region’s reach. Yet from the days when Indians in parts of Central America and Mexico used cacao <b>seeds</b> as <b>money</b> to the present-day informal economy, the instinct of the Latin American people is no different from that of the rest of the human species. Nothing suggests that the native cultures, either in their precolonial or in their mestizo forms, could not have responded creatively and successfully to the incentives of liberty had they been allowed to operate under less-oppressive conditions.

30|$|Various {{flood relief}} {{measures}} and disaster management regimes {{can be used}} as a reference for responding to flood events. First, when flooding occurs, the government can organize a series of relief measures, including providing food and clothes, tax exemptions, crop reseeding, engineer employment provisions, and relief substitutions. Second, the impact conveying process and influence degree of the floods were relatively consistent. Agricultural production was a key process in the flood response chain, and the two floods both influenced society by affecting agriculture, food, materials and other aspects. Thus, contemporary flood hazard mitigation should follow the order of flood response chain, from measures on production, food, economy to society. All levels of relief measures should be implemented, including food relief, agriculture production, housing, food prices, tax, water conservancy and administration. Especially, governmental food relief and support of <b>money,</b> <b>seed</b> or technology for agriculture production in modern flood hazard mitigation are very necessary. Third, central and local governments should be unified and cooperate with each other, and officers should be rewarded or punished according to their performance in coping with flood hazard. The strict principle of reward and punishment should be implemented as a policy by legislation.|$|R
40|$|In the subsistence-oriented, {{semi-arid}} {{production systems}} of Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka, India, {{the environment is}} marginal for crop growth and often {{there is no substitute}} for millet crops. Across communities, farmers grow thirteen different combinations of pearl millet, sorghum, finger millet, little millet, and foxtail millet varieties, but individual farmers grow an average of only two to three millet varieties per season. The notion of the seed system includes all channels through which farmers acquire genetic materials, outside or in interaction with the commercial seed industry. Data are compiled through household surveys and interviews with traders and dealers in village and district markets. Based on the concept of the seed lot, several characteristics of local seed markets are defined and measured by millet crop, including seed transfer rates for farmer-to-farmer transactions and seed replacement ratios. Most seed transactions appear to be based on <b>money.</b> <b>Seed</b> supply channels differ by improvement status of the genetic material. Econometric results indicate the significance of the seed replacement ratios and seed volumes traded in determining the levels of crop biodiversity managed by communities, in addition to the household, farm and other market-related factors identified by previous studies.
