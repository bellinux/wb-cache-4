30|$|Today, every {{internet}} user {{is familiar with}} the term Wi-Fi. Our homes, restaurants, airports and even trains, buses and commercial airplanes provide Wi-Fi connectivity. The large-scale use of smartphones and the popularity of voice chat applications have also made Wi-Fi a widely used network for communications. The major utility of Wi-Fi is cheap internet access and support for high data rates, but this explosive increase in Wi-Fi usage has its repercussions that a shared bandwidth (up to 600 Mbps) is divided between all of the stations running different applications simultaneously due to which degradation in performance occurs especially for real-time applications. Therefore, it is required by the network to provide appropriate services to delay sensitive applications and guaranteed required bandwidth to the triple play services of voice, video and internet access. The IEEE 802.11 e draft presents the sole brief quality of service (QoS) framework for IEEE 802.11 wireless local area networks (WLANs) by introducing enhanced distributed channel access (EDCA) [1], which characterizes traffic into high and low priority traffic classes. EDCA implementations divide traffic into four major categories of voice, video, best effort and background traffic. Each traffic category gets different medium access priority with voice getting the highest, video second highest, best effort second least and background getting the least priority to access the medium. This medium access priority is enforced by awarding different contention window sizes to different traffic categories with highest priority traffic category getting the lowest contention window size and different sizes of arbitration <b>inter-frame</b> <b>space</b> (AIFS) with high priority traffic transmitting with <b>shorter</b> <b>inter-frame</b> <b>space.</b> To increase the transmission efficiency, EDCA uses transmission opportunity (TXOP) limit, a definite time interval in which a station can transmit any number of frames with <b>short</b> <b>inter-frame</b> <b>space</b> (SIFS) without contention. The approach followed in EDCA makes significant performance enhancements for real-time applications, {{but at the same time}} neglects non-real-time applications. Moreover, the medium access and transmission parameters for different traffic categories do not take into account the traffic characteristics of the applications which result in bandwidth under-utilization and unfair distribution of channel among different applications [2]. Use of AIFS and TXOP limit by EDCA in a non-adaptive manner for different applications having diverse traffic characteristics and behaviour result in notable performance degradation.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a dominant channel occupancy (DCO) {{mechanism for the}} Wi-Fi backscatter uplink in the industrial Internet of things (IIoT). The DCO provides high-priority channel access and reliable burst transmission to the Wi-Fi backscatter devices, thereby enabling the Wi-Fi backscatter tag to deliver its tag information to the Wi-Fi reader without interference from neighboring legacy Wi-Fi devices to guarantee the timeliness and reliability of the IIoT system. For the former, we consider three types of medium access control (MAC) configurations: “carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) starting with <b>short</b> <b>inter-frame</b> <b>space</b> (SIFS) ”, “freezing of the backoff period”, and “reduced CWmin. ” In addition, the DCO uses the SIFS between burst packets to guarantee reliable burst transmission. To verify the effectiveness of DCO and determine a proper value for MAC parameters, we conduct experimental simulations under IEEE 802. 11 n PHY/MAC environments. The simulation {{results show that the}} reduced CWmin has the most significant effect on the channel occupancy. The Wi-Fi backscatter devices achieve much higher throughput than the separate cases when two or more configurations are used simultaneously. Moreover, the results exhibit that the use of SIFS between consecutive packets supports reliable burst transmission regardless of the transmission of the legacy Wi-Fi devices in the vicinity...|$|R
30|$|The DCF {{mechanism}} uses a backoff {{scheme to}} access a channel. Each node which has packets to transmit senses the channel firstly. If the node senses that the channel stays idle continuously within a duration distributed <b>inter-frame</b> <b>space</b> (DIFS), it would transmit the packet. Otherwise, the node would start a backoff process. In this case, {{it will start}} up a counter. Initially, {{the value of the}} counter is selected from [0, Wmin] randomly; here, Wmin denotes the minimum window. Then, after each time slot, the value of the counter will be deduced by 1. After the value of the counter is deduced to 0, the node would transmit the packet. If an acknowledgement (ACK) packet is not received in a <b>short</b> <b>inter-frame</b> <b>space</b> (SIFS) duration, a collision occurred and the node would retransmit the packet. The value of Wmin will be doubled firstly at the initial of each retransmission; then, the node chooses another number from [0, Wmin] randomly as the value of the counter and starts a new backoff process. After Wmin reaches Wmax, where Wmax is the maximum window, it will not be doubled and keep the value Wmax. If the number of retransmissions is larger than the retry limit, the node would drop the packet and reset the value of Wmin to the initial value, and then, the node would start a new backoff process. If the node has no packet to be transmitted and the counter is decremented to 0, the node would keep the counter to be 0 until it has a packet to transmit.|$|R
30|$|If the AP finds a sequence, Q of n {{recipients}} in U sequentially connected, that is, each recipient {{except the}} first recipient can hear its previous recipient in the sequence, the AP can poll {{the sequence of}} n recipients simultaneously by transmitting a single RAK frame including the MAC addresses of the sequence of n recipients after the multicast data frame is transmitted. For this purpose, {{the format of the}} RAK frame should be changed to include the multiple recipient MAC addresses. In response to the RAK frame, the first recipient transmits its ACK frame, on which its uplink data frame can be piggybacked, an SIFS (<b>Short</b> <b>Inter-Frame</b> <b>Space)</b> period after the reception of the RAK frame. And, each recipient except the first recipient transmits its ACK frame, on which its uplink data frame can be piggybacked, automatically an SIFS period {{after the end of the}} ACK frame transmission of the previous recipient in the sequence. If the AP does not detect the ACK frame transmission signal from a recipient within an SIFS period following the transmission of the AP or the previous recipient in the sequence, for the error recovery the AP transmits another RAK frame to poll the next recipients in the sequence after a PIFS (PCF <b>Inter-Frame</b> <b>Space)</b> period from the end of the previous transmission. In this manner, the AP can collect the ACK frames from n recipients by a single RAK frame transmission when the AP receives the ACK frames from the recipients successfully. This procedure for collecting the ACK frames by transmitting the RAK frames to the recipients in the sequence, Q, will be called the RAK polling procedure for the sequence, Q.|$|R
50|$|With EDCA, high-{{priority}} traffic has {{a higher}} chance of being sent than low-priority traffic: a station with high priority traffic waits a little less before it sends its packet, on average, than a station with low priority traffic. This is accomplished through the TCMA protocol, which is a variation of CSMA/CA using a <b>shorter</b> arbitration <b>inter-frame</b> <b>space</b> (AIFS) for higher priority packets. The exact values depend on the physical layer {{that is used to}} transmit the data. In addition, EDCA provides contention-free access to the channel for a period called a Transmit Opportunity (TXOP). A TXOP is a bounded time interval during which a station can send as many frames as possible (as long as the duration of the transmissions does not extend beyond the maximum duration of the TXOP). If a frame is too large to be transmitted in a single TXOP, it should be fragmented into smaller frames. The use of TXOPs reduces the problem of low rate stations gaining an inordinate amount of channel time in the legacy 802.11 DCF MAC. A TXOP time interval of 0 means it is limited to a single MAC service data unit (MSDU) or MAC management protocol data unit (MMPDU).|$|R

Bruno et al. have exploited frame bursting to improve TCP fairness between uplink and downlink flows and to maximize channel utilization. In the approach, AP is able to transmit multiple frames in a burst, whose size is adjusted based on the collision probability monitored in the AP [14]. Additional schemes of supporting the fairness among sending and receiving stations directly manage MAC parameters in [15 – 17]. The approach in [15] mitigates the unfairness by reducing the chances of transmission for the sending stations in the way of increasing the minimum contention window size. The downlink compensation access (DCA) algorithm in [16] gives higher priority to the AP with smaller <b>inter-frame</b> <b>space.</b> In the proposed method of [17], each sending station defers its access based on the next packet information.|$|R
