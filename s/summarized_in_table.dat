5|$|The well-studied CAS {{proteins}} BCAR1 and NEDD9 {{have important}} roles in cancer and other pathological conditions, which have been addressed in many studies and reviews. EFS has attracted less study. However, the conserved functional properties of EFS relevant to cellular adhesion and migration, and RTK signaling, suggest changes in activity of this protein may also be relevant to cancer and other disease states, influencing prognosis and therapeutic response.

25|$|The {{structure}} {{analysis indicated}} that YB41Si1.2 has not the γ-AlB12-type lattice but a rare orthorhombic crystal structure (space group: Pbam, No. 55) with lattice constants of a = 1.674(1) nm, b = 1.7667(1) nm and c = 0.9511(7) nm. There are 58 independent atomic sites in the unit cell. Three of them are occupied by either B or Si atoms (mixed-occupancy sites), one is a Si bridge site and one is Y site. From the remaining 53 boron sites, 48 form icosahedra and 5 are bridging sites. Atomic coordinates and site occupancies are <b>summarized</b> <b>in</b> <b>table</b> III.|$|E
25|$|There are {{currently}} 20 mutations in CACNA1H associated with CAE. These mutations are likely not wholly causative and should instead {{be thought of}} as giving susceptibility. This is particularly true since some groups have found no connection between CAE and CACNA1H mutations. Many of the CACNA1H mutations have a measurable effect on channel kinetics, including activation time constant and voltage dependence, deactivation time constant, and inactivation time constant and voltage dependence (<b>summarized</b> <b>in</b> <b>Table</b> 1). Many of these mutations should lead to neuronal excitability, though others may lead to hypoexcitability. These predictions are due to mathematical modeling and may differ from what will occur in real neurons where other proteins, some of which may interact with CACNA1H, are present.|$|E
25|$|There {{are eight}} atomic {{sites in the}} unit cell: one yttrium Y, four boron B1–B4, one carbon C3 and three silicon sites Si1–Si3. Atomic coordinates, site {{occupancy}} and isotropic displacement factors are listed in table Va; 68% of the Y sites are randomly occupied and remaining Y sites are vacant. All boron sites and Si1 and Si2 sites are fully occupied. The C3 and Si3 sites can be occupied by either carbon or silicon atoms (mixed occupancy) with a probability of about 50%. Their separation is only 0.413 Å, and thus either the C3 or Si3 sites, but not both, are occupied. These sites form Si-C pairs, but not Si-Si or C-C pairs. The distances between the C3 and Si3 sites and the surrounding sites for YxB12C0.33Si3.0 are <b>summarized</b> <b>in</b> <b>table</b> Vb and the overall crystal structure {{is shown in figure}} 14.|$|E

2500|$|The {{biomaterial}} term is {{used for}} materials {{that can be used}} in biomedical and clinical applications. They are bioactive and biocompatible in nature. Currently, many types of metals and alloys (stainless steel, titanium, nickel, magnesium, Co–Cr alloys, Ti alloys), ceramics (zirconia, bioglass, alumina, hydroxyapatite) [...] and polymers (acrylic, nylon, silicone, polyurethane, polycaprolactone, polyanhydrides) [...] are used for load bearing application. This includes dental replacement and bone joining or replacement for medical and clinical application. Therefore their mechanical properties are very important. Mechanical properties of some biomaterials and bone are <b>summarized</b> <b>in</b> <b>table</b> 1. Among them hydroxyapatite is most widely studied bioactive and biocompatible material. However, it has lower young’s modulus and fracture toughness with brittle nature. Hence, it is required to produce a biomaterial with good mechanical properties.|$|E
2500|$|Of the {{hundreds}} of seismogenic (earthquake causing) geologic faults in California, UCERF classifies only six faults as Type A sources, meaning there is sufficient information to both estimate and model {{the probability of a}} Magnitude (M) 6.7 or greater earthquake within 30 years. These six faults (<b>summarized</b> <b>in</b> <b>Table</b> A, below) are the: (1) San Andreas (split into northern and southern sections, (2) San Jacinto, (3) Elsinore, (4) Garlock, (5) Calaveras, and (6) Hayward-Rodgers Creek. [...] Faults which are known to be slipping (and therefore seismogenic) but lack sufficient information to fully model how close they might be to rupture are classified as Type B. [...] About twenty of these faults (see Table B) are estimated to have a 5% or greater chance of an M ≥ 6.7 earthquake within 30 years. An additional six areas where strain is accumulating but where knowledge is insufficient to apportion slip onto specific faults are classified as Type C sources.|$|E
