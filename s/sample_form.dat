It is intended for public, school, academic, and special libraries. [...] The Frontline Advocacy for Public Libraries Toolkit {{offers a variety of}} helpful resources including information about blogging, speech making, and data collecting. [...] Advocating in a Tough Economy is a response to difficult economic situations when the library is simultaneously increasing patronage while losing tax based funding. Its toolkit contains, “resources and tools, including news clips, op-eds, and statistics to help library supporters make the case for libraries in tough economic times.” The CLA also provides a Copyright Grassroots Advocacy Kit to address Bill C-32, An Act to amend the Copyright Act. The contents of this kit are [...] "a list of 8 key messages, a <b>sample</b> <b>form</b> letter to your MP, a guide for holding an in-person meeting, and a link to find contact information for your MP.

40|$|Spectroscopic {{methods have}} been {{proposed}} to predict sugarcane quality in the field. There are different sample forms {{could be used to}} predict sugar content using spectroscopic methods; raw juice (RJ), clear juice (CJ), fibrated samples (FS), stalk cross sectional surface (SCS) and stalk skin (SS). Thus, this study was conducted to identify the optimum <b>sample</b> <b>form</b> for predicting quality using a low-cost and portable spectrometer. A total of 100 samples from each <b>sample</b> <b>form</b> were scanned using a visible-shortwave near infrared (Vis/SWNIR) spectrometer. The experiment was conducted under the same experimental setup and all data were treated using the same statistical methods. All spectral data were calibrated against brix value. The coefficient of determination (R 2) for SCS, FS, CJ, SS and RJ were 0. 88, 0. 86, 0. 84, 0. 81 and 0. 80, respectively. The study found that a Vis/SWNIR spectrometer could be used to predict sugar content from all sample forms. The stalk samples scanned on cross sectional surface was found to be the optimum <b>sample</b> <b>form</b> for quality prediction using a Vis/SWNIR spectrometer. ...|$|E

The introductory chapters of the thesis describe a quality in general form. It offers a basic characteristic of audit and auditor. It is deal with a legislative framework, necessary standards and another regulation of audit quality. Subsequently, it explains control system of audit quality in the Czech Republic and it describes watchdog bodies in the Czech Republic. After that the publication of Federation of European Accountants (FEE) from 2013 is analysed and criteria are presented. These criteria proceed from survey of FEE and determine the auditor selection. In conclusion it deals with application of discovered information on the individual practical examples of application for execution of audit or other audit services. This achieved information is used to create a <b>sample</b> <b>form.</b> This <b>sample</b> <b>form</b> of application for execution of audit could serve to improve of audit quality in the first stage of auditor selection.
