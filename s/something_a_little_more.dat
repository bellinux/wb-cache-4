500|$|Rolling Stone, {{called the}} video [...] "powerful" [...] and a found [...] "the final crescendo {{reaching}} a breaking point of true sorrow". Chris Payne, from Billboard called the music video [...] "somber". Nicole Sia of Spin praised [...] "the song's visual". According to Lansky of Idolator, [...] "the clip, {{which is basically}} just Mars...sitting and singing at the piano...works". He continued, [...] "While he certainly could have gone for <b>something</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> high-concept, the clip’s elegant framing just draws attention to...the song".|$|E
500|$|As {{guest actor}} Leonard Nimoy, who plays William Bell, was {{unavailable}} {{to shoot the}} brief conversation with Blair Brown's Nina Sharp, the producers knew {{they wanted to do}} <b>something</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> creative for the scene. They talked to cartoonist Frank Miller and hired a special effects school to do all the modeling, which they accomplished based on photos of Nimoy, because the actor could not come in to have his head scanned; he did some voicework however. The finished scene included an animated version of Nimoy's head, shown through the same window as the one used in [...] "Peter".|$|E

2500|$|Guitarist Jeff Schroeder also {{hinted that}} the album {{may be less}} heavy than past albums, stating [...] "In this day and age, with what's going on {{politically}} and socially, it just feels right to play <b>something</b> that's <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> spacey and dreamy. We want music to move people on an emotional level." ...|$|R
5000|$|Writing about Other Music's closure for The New Yorker, Amanda Petrusich said, [...] "In 1999, if {{you were}} {{the type of person who}} was looking for <b>something</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> {{different}} (<b>more</b> challenging, more sophisticated, more esoteric) from the schlock being peddled to the herds of dead-eyed automatons browsing the Tower Records up the block, then here was the store for you!" ...|$|R
500|$|Negative reviews {{revolved}} around the theme's classic Bond sound. LAUNCHcast's James Poletti called the song a [...] "perfectly competent Bond theme", but [...] "the formula seems a little too easy. Perhaps {{they would have done}} better to rise to the challenge of doing something a little different, <b>something</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> knowingly tongue-in-cheek." [...] Melody Maker stated, [...] "You know what this sounds like before you hear it. If the people in charge want Garbage, then why not let them do what Garbage do?" [...] In its review of Absolute Garbage, Pitchfork called the song a [...] "predictable 'Goldfinger' permutation signaling the band's limitless affinity for big-budget theatrics." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{band was}} {{surprised}} at the length of [...] "A Farewell to Arms" [...] and [...] "Clenching the Fists of Dissent" [...] running over ten minutes, and wondered if their fans would [...] "be able to get their heads around" [...] what the band was doing. Record company Roadrunner Records hesitated the band's decision to open the album with a ten and a half minute song ("Clenching the Fists of Dissent"), and asked the band questions similar to [...] "Are you sure you don’t want to get into <b>something</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> direct?" [...] The band disregarded the comment and believed the song set the tone musically {{for the remainder of the}} album.|$|E
500|$|According to AllMusic {{reviewer}} Heather Phares, Taking Back Sunday [...] "sometimes {{comes off}} as less than distinctive, and the album can sound like a generic soundtrack to generic teenage angst." [...] Phares called Where You Want to Be [...] "definitely a solid album... but crafting <b>something</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> unique would take Taking Back Sunday's music that much farther." [...] On Chart Attack, despite the album's being [...] "overwrought" [...] its [...] "quality songwriting and some killer arrangements conceal Where You Want to Bes occasional off-the-chart cheese readings." [...] Although Drowned in Sound writer Mat Hocking expected the album {{to be one of}} the [...] "grittiest, most emotionally driving punk-pop records of the year," [...] it turned out to be [...] "an album that's playing it far too safe: melodies rise and fall, soaring and curving with painful predictability." ...|$|E

[...] "Try to find some substance which is less exquisitely sensitive, <b>something</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> grosser, <b>more</b> in key with the material world; or to discover someone whom you do understand. Don't lose heart; don't be beaten after all these years." ...|$|R
5000|$|Clear Heart Full Eyes is {{the debut}} solo album by The Hold Steady vocalist and guitarist Craig Finn, {{released}} on January 24, 2012 on Full Time Hobby.

[...] Upon release, the album debuted at #89 in the US.|$|R
5000|$|Similar {{praise and}} {{commentary}} came from Gamers Daily News, which rated {{the game with}} a 9.0 overall. [...] "The Iron Grip series may bring about some change in the gaming community that, for the better, will introduce a new type of game that caters, not only to {{the people who want to}} run and gun, but to those gamers who want <b>something</b> with <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> meat than your average first person shooter." ...|$|R
500|$|In a 2003 {{interview}} with Kerrang!, DeLonge claimed {{the album was}} only an attempt to [...] "challenge myself to do different shit": [...] "I did it for myself, whether it sold a million copies or just one, it was for myself." [...] He clarified the band's future succinctly: [...] "There {{are a lot of}} emotions between Mark and I and that's why there’s never going to be another Box Car Racer album. It was never meant to be something that would alienate anybody." [...] The article's author, Tom Bryant, describes the album's effect on subsequent Blink-182 albums: [...] "It allowed , and therefore the band, to assess whether, approaching or in their 30s, they still really wanted to be writing songs about splitting up from teenage sweethearts or whether it was time to address <b>something</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> serious and a little more important." ...|$|E
500|$|DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson thought [...] "Bart the Murderer" [...] was season three's first [...] "truly great" [...] episode {{because it}} [...] "starts off strong and gets even better as it moves." [...] Even though he thinks Mafia parodies have been overused, Jacobson thought this one brought [...] "a fresh {{approach}} and remains consistently amusing. A great guest spot from Mantegna helps. It also {{feels like the}} first episode of this season that really moves the series ahead; it seems like <b>something</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> incisive than most of what came before it." [...] Andy Patrizio of IGN called [...] "Bart the Murderer" [...] his favorite of the season, and praised the episode for its references to The Godfather and MacGyver. The episode's reference to GoodFellas was named the 28th greatest film reference {{in the history of}} the show by Total Films Nathan Ditum.|$|E
500|$|The couple's {{marriage}} reflected {{aspects of}} their personalities and courtship. [...] George was devoted to Lenore, and tried to bring her a flower every day, often a single rose with a love note. [...] George was also a strong, blunt personality used to winning arguments by force of will, but the more self-controlled Lenore was unintimidated and willing to push back against him. [...] The couple quarreled often, so much that their grandchildren would later nickname them [...] "the Bickersons". [...] In the end, their closeness {{would allow them to}} settle arguments amicably, often by her finally accepting what he wanted. [...] She still had a restive nature; Mitt later recalled that, [...] "It always seemed that she wanted <b>something</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> for herself." [...] (Mitt himself would later show a more reserved, private, and controlled nature than George's, traits he got from Lenore.) ...|$|E
50|$|Guitarist Stone Gossard {{added the}} siren-like guitar part. Gossard on the song:That song {{went through a}} cool {{evolution}} {{that goes back to}} what we've been saying about creative input. Dave played us the two main parts, that BAM-BAM-BAM groovy chordal riff bit and then the main ascending riff in more of an acoustic vein. Then, when he got behind the drums, everyone turned up real loud and it evolved into <b>something</b> else, <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> hard core.|$|R
500|$|Regarding Broadway, MacFarlane told The Hollywood Reporter, [...] "If I did a Broadway musical, I'd {{probably}} want to do <b>something</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit <b>more</b> old-fashioned", and went on saying [...] "I wouldn't necessarily do something that was as edgy as what they ] and [...] have done. The challenge to me would be more along the lines of, gosh, can somebody write Oklahoma! for 2011?" [...] He has also said that, [...] "The good thing about Broadway is that you don't {{have to worry about}} an airdate. It gets done when it gets done." ...|$|R
5000|$|Dionysos {{delivers}} a Harmony/soul/philosophical/rock n roll style, through a sometimes gentle {{and other times}} intense, medium. Their message {{has always been to}} deliver a pure artistic meaningful musical experience to the people who thirst for <b>something</b> with <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> substance in life. Their lyrics are generally filled with profound observations of the world, and philosophical questions that beckon the listener to come up with their own version of truth. [...] They deliver an experience that strives to take a listener to an intense psychedelic meditative state of mind through progressive rhythms, and vocal harmonies.|$|R
500|$|For the film, cinematographer Russell Carpenter used a 1.85 {{aspect ratio}} shot with Arri Alexa XT and M cameras, using the M for fight {{sequences}} and helicopter filming. Camera operator Peter Rosenfeld said, [...] "Russell and Peyton's decision to shoot in 1.85 {{was a good}} call, since at 2.35 there's insufficient height in frame to appreciate the vertical aspects of [...] going from standing full-size to falling {{through a crack in}} the floor." [...] Carpenter and Technicolor also devised a lookup table (LUT) to darken the color palette. Carpenter said, [...] "For a lot of recent comedies I've kept my LUTs kind of 'Kodak' – saturated and upbeat. But this show needed something different that affected skin tones and the Ant-Man suit, which dates back to the 1980s, so it looks a little run-down. What I loved about this LUT was how it allowed the costume to retain the color but took it from fire-engine red to <b>something</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> weathered." ...|$|E
500|$|The song {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics. AllMusic critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine considered Here We Go Again [...] "not {{quite as much}} fun", as Lovato's debut album Don't Forget, [...] "but still fun, particularly when Lovato tears into hooky power pop like ... 'Remember December'." [...] Erlewine also named the song {{one of the best}} tracks on the album. BBC Music's Fraser McAlpine rated it four out of five stars, and wrote, [...] "I'm sure there's a punkrock reason why we should all get together and hate it, but {{for the life of me}} I just can't. Even with the weird pronunciation and silly lyrics, this is a corker." [...] McAlpine praised the [...] "grand" [...] chorus and wrote: [...] "Someone in Team Lovato has been cocking an ear to the musical stylings of Paramore and maybe suggested that the next logical step after Camp Rocks wholesome Disneyfication of popular song might be <b>something</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> confessional." ...|$|E
500|$|Three {{nights before}} the {{official}} anniversary date, an hour-long documentary of the series, , premiered on VH1. Critically acclaimed duo Patrick Creadon and Christine O'Malley created {{the film as}} a followup to I.O.U.S.A. – a documentary on America's financial situation. Creadon remarked, [...] "After spending two years examining the financial health of the United States, Christine and I were ready to tackle <b>something</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> upbeat. Telling the SpongeBob story feels like the perfect fit." [...] On Friday July 17, Nickelodeon marked the official anniversary of the series, with a 50-hour television marathon titled [...] "The Ultimate SpongeBob SpongeBash Weekend". The marathon began with a new episode, [...] "To SquarePants or Not to SquarePants". Saturday saw a countdown of the top ten episodes as picked by fans, {{as well as an}} airing of The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie. The marathon finished on Sunday, which saw a countdown of episodes as picked by celebrities, as well as the premiere of ten new episodes.|$|E
5000|$|Shehan's {{return to}} Los Angeles {{signified}} {{the end of}} the band's hiatus and on February 13, 2009, the band published a blog post, entitled [...] "There is hope for us....", on their Myspace page, with a short message promising more from the band soon. [...] "Thank you all for standing by our side.... We will post <b>something</b> with <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> detail soon. Promise. Love, The Jealous Sound."

500|$|Night School {{wanted the}} story to have scary and supernatural elements, without verging on horror. [...] "We wanted to <b>something</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit <b>more</b> [...] Spielberg-ian, and sort of give it a sense of wonder and have it, for awhile, just be {{actually}} interacting with these supernatural creatures where it's almost <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit fun, and hopefully, gives you butterflies in your stomach before it gets pretty crazy," [...] Krankel said. The developers were influenced by other coming-of-age stories like Stand By Me when developing the characters and story; Krankel cited the character of Lindsay Weir from Freaks and Geeks as the biggest outside influence {{on the character of}} Alex.|$|R
500|$|Fleming House {{students}} and alumni quickly began plotting {{for the return}} of the cannon, setting up a command center in a trailer on campus and soliciting donations from alumni. Their initial plan was to use a helicopter to fly the cannon out of the MIT campus. [...] Initial arrangements were made with a helicopter company, but Federal Aviation Administration rules ultimately made this untenable. [...] The students instead decided to surreptitiously steal back the cannon under cover of darkness. [...] On the morning of April 10, about two dozen Fleming students, dressed in their signature red Fleming jerseys, descended upon the cannon to reclaim it and begin its journey back to Pasadena. However, MIT students had been tipped off and were waiting for the Caltech students with a friendly barbecue prepared, and played Wagner's Ride of the Valkyries, a forbidden song at Caltech due to its association with final exams, as the Flems entered. The Fleming students left a miniature toy cannon with a note reading, [...] "Here's <b>something</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> your size." ...|$|E
500|$|The song {{received}} mostly positive reviews {{by music}} critics. Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone praised Swift's lyrical craftsmanship, calling the song's couplets [...] "You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter" [...] as a [...] "brilliant throwaway detail." [...] Bobby Peacock of Roughstock gave the song three-and-a-half stars out of five, lauding its catchy yet melodious hook. However, {{he pointed out}} that the song reflects her earlier works in the first two albums and he wished that Swift would [...] "try <b>something</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> out of the ordinary." [...] Nick Levine of Digital Spy gave the song four stars out of five, commenting that although the song was [...] "formulaic," [...] the formula was executed convincingly. Chrissie Dickinson of the Chicago Tribune noted that [...] "Mine" [...] is an epitome of Swift's classic song-craft, calling it [...] "simple but honest expressions of emotion." [...] Anthony Benigno of the Daily News said that although the track is reminiscent of Swift's previous hits, he added, [...] "the song's origins are grounded more in failed relationships than storybook ones." ...|$|E
500|$|Beyoncé changed costumes {{five times}} during the show. Her looks ranged from a {{sparkling}} fringed set to a red leotard. Her fashion during the shows received praise from critics. Celia L. Smith of Essence magazine described Beyoncé's look as [...] "fabulous" [...] while further calling her costumes [...] "dazzling" [...] and [...] "fierce". A writer of Vogue magazine noted that Beyoncé's show [...] "required <b>something</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> spectacular than her recent dressed-down chic". Dawn Fallik of The Wall Street Journal commented that Beyoncé was [...] "shedding costumes like a chameleon changing colors" [...] during the show. He went on saying, [...] "There were fashion montages with Beyonce in 1950s cat glasses, 1960s headbands and 1970s mod form" [...] further concluding that the fashion was [...] "all well and good". Emily Sheridan of the Daily Mail also praised the costumes designed for the show, describing them as [...] "sexy". Chuck Darrow of the Philadelphia Media Network wrote in his review that the [...] "shape-hugging, leg-baring costumes {{in which she was}} garbed were, by today's standards, [...] almost demure." [...] Dan DeLuca of Philadelphia Inquirer noted that her [...] "barely-there" [...] outfits were designed to call attention to Beyoncé's physique [...] "from the derriere down".|$|E
2500|$|For the {{recording}} of their next studio album, the Replacements {{decided to return to}} Blackberry Way Studios in late 1983. The band considered R.E.M.'s guitarist Peter Buck as producer, but when they met him in Athens, Georgia, they did not have enough material to begin recording. Instead, Jesperson and Steve Fjelstad co-produced the album. By this time, the Replacements had grown tired of playing loud and fast exclusively; Westerberg stated, [...] "Now we're softening <b>a</b> <b>little</b> where we can do <b>something</b> that's <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> sincere without being afraid that someone's not going to like it or the punks aren't {{going to be able to}} dance to it." ...|$|R
5000|$|Christopher Troilo from Avault {{gave the}} game three stars out of five, stating that [...] "If you require <b>something</b> with <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> depth and thought, I still {{think you should}} give it a try, but that’s {{probably}} all you’ll need to satisfy your curiosity." [...] Kieron Gillen from Eurogamer gave it a score of 7 out of 10, complimenting the graphic style as [...] "hyperactive amateurish-yet-charming" [...] and stating that it was [...] "a run-and-gun that chooses to {{step back from the}} difficulty cliff and just show all the gleeful nonsense its managed to think up." [...] He, as well as Troilo, compared the game with Contra.|$|R
5000|$|Bishara {{is known}} to be fond of horror, and he has stated that he favors {{composing}} for the genre above others: [...] "It is the one that had the most energy for me. There always just seemed to be <b>something</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit <b>more</b> compelling about being on the edge of everything going away." [...] He is known for his avant-garde style and unique approach to instrumentation and composition that suits horror films particularly well. Music journalists have noted his disregard for horror film score conventions, employing [...] "gut-wrenching string dissonance, haunting electronic sounds and sudden crescendoes" [...] and using strings and percussion to create effects designed to evoke [...] "maximum shock effect" [...] in the listener.|$|R
500|$|Reviewers {{commented on}} the {{differences}} between Free and Office of Strategic Influence. Rosenberg described Free as [...] "heavier, darker, more experimental {{and a lot more}} consistent" [...] than the first album. Stewart Mason of Allmusic described the album as [...] "downright commercial in a way that none of the duo's previous projects have been". He regarded the album as less like the [...] "standard-issue epic metal" [...] of the first album and more like [...] "Evanescence's gothy metal-pop crossed with late-era Radiohead's fondness for electronic interference". He considered the songwriting as [...] "catchy enough that it's not unthinkable that unadventurous rock radio programmers could take a shine to the title track or 'Go'", although noted that [...] "Fates Warning and Dream Theater fans might be less impressed". Rosenberg considers Free as musically [...] "a more progressive version of Nine Inch Nails. Instead of creating their darkness with angst and depression, OSI creates their darkness with sheer indifference." [...] Begrand compared the album to Head Control System, [...] "in that it tends to stray from the typical metal template in an attempt at <b>something</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> electronic influenced". Although not considering Free to be as [...] "enthralling" [...] as Head Control System, he noted that the album [...] "still has its moments".|$|E
500|$|Despite being a {{critical}} success throughout its run, criticisms {{began to emerge}} of the series in its third season. Keith McDuffee of TV Squad described the third season as [...] "disappointing", mainly because the episodes offered nothing new: [...] "most fans of Veronica Mars felt that season three was clearly its weakest." [...] Eric Goldman of IGN said that the main issue was the shift in the overall tone, with a lighter feeling than the previous seasons. He felt that Logan had been most affected by the tone change, robbed of his darker aspects and changed into an [...] "increasingly extraneous character." [...] Goldman felt that despite the concerns over final five episodes, the series ended with [...] "three very strong episodes, with lots of strong dialogue and Veronica proving again just how tough she can be, and what a strong character she is." [...] Goldman concluded that although the third season [...] "was very choppy", it still had [...] "plenty of witty dialogue and a continually engaging performance by Kristen Bell as the title character." [...] The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette opined that Veronica Mars had taken a dive [...] "creatively", from [...] "the mopier version of its theme song to stalled storylines." [...] The reviewer felt that [...] "the arcing mysteries had grown less convincing and compelling {{as time went on}} and were too drawn out." [...] Fox News Channel's Bridget Byrne pointed out that Veronica had [...] "gone from punky to—dare we say—preppy" [...] in the third season. Byrne further explained that [...] "with her quick, bright wit and sharp eye for life's darker moments [...] has left high school and is going to college, doffing her dark threads and spiked tresses for <b>something</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> stylish." ...|$|E
2500|$|But after {{enrolling in}} public school and moving to Montana — a {{predominantly}} white state, albeit one with a decidedly hippie-ish vibe — Lamb and Lynx decided they simply no longer believed what they’d been taught. ..."I’m glad {{we were in the}} band," [...] Lynx said, [...] "but I think we should have been pushed toward <b>something</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> mainstream and easier for us to handle than being front-men for a belief system that we didn’t even completely understand at that time. We were little kids." ...|$|E
50|$|If you {{are buying}} {{a gift for}} a boss or an older person, {{personal}} hygiene products {{might not be the}} best way to go, as it would be <b>a</b> <b>little</b> awkward to hand your boss a toothpaste gift set. Honey is always a welcomed gift idea. Another popular one is a dried salted croaker fish called gulbi. The goal here is to buy <b>something</b> that is <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> desirable or elegant than cleansing products.|$|R
5000|$|On {{beginning}} a solo career, Sherwood stated, [...] "I {{wanted to do}} some of my own writing and make something that was challenging for me... As a producer, it's my job to satisfy the artist foremost. I wanted to make <b>something</b> that was <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> aggressive and modern. I wanted to paint a picture that was contemporary, one that specifically showed where my brain was at. I've got to the point in my life where it's time for me to call all of the shots." ...|$|R
500|$|Matheos {{originally}} intended the first OSI album as a [...] "project" [...] which would never produce a second album. For Free, Matheos and Moore {{wanted to use}} a different musician lineup to focus OSI on primarily being Matheos and Moore. They {{did not want to}} give the impression that the guests on the first album were part of the band. Matheos stated that the music on Free was [...] "focused less on the progressive elements or the metal elements that were on the first record. We thought we could do <b>something</b> just <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> groove oriented." [...] Matheos and Moore had both worked with bassist Joey Vera in the past and considered him [...] "perfect" [...] for the album. Moore was pleased with Vera's bass parts: Vera sent them to Moore in a state such that they required very little editing or enhancement for the final mix of the album.|$|R
