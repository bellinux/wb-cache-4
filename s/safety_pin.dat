25|$|The <b>safety</b> <b>pin</b> is a {{fastening}} device, {{a variation}} of the regular pin, which includes a simple spring mechanism and a clasp. The clasp serves two purposes, to form a closed loop thereby properly fastening the pin to whatever it is applied to, and to cover the end of the pin to protect the user from the sharp point. The <b>safety</b> <b>pin</b> was invented by Walter Hunt, and patented in April 1849. The rights to the invention were sold for $400.|$|E

25|$|Unlike {{most modern}} brooches, fibulae {{were not only}} decorative; they {{originally}} served a practical function: to fasten clothing, such as cloaks. Fibulae replaced straight pins {{that were used to}} fasten clothing in the Neolithic period and the Bronze Age. In turn, fibulae were replaced as clothing fasteners by buttons in the Middle Ages. Their descendant, the modern <b>safety</b> <b>pin,</b> remains in use today. In ancient Rome and other places where Latin was used, the same word denoted both a brooch and the fibula bone because a popular form for brooches and the shape of the bone were thought to resemble one another.|$|E

25|$|The first fibulae design, violin bow fibulae (drahtbugel in German), {{appeared}} in the late Bronze Age. This simple design, with a unilateral spring, looks remarkably like a modern <b>safety</b> <b>pin.</b> The violin bow fibula has a low flat arch; the body runs parallel to the pin so it resembles a violin bow. The bow could be round, square, or flat and ribbon-like in cross-section. Some had simple punched or incised decoration on the bow. Violin bow fibula, such as the Peschiera type and the Unter-Radl type, {{was introduced in the}} 14th century BC (Late Mycenean III era) by the Myceneans on the Greek Peloponnesus. The fibula soon spread to Crete, Cyprus and Mycenean trading posts in Sicily.|$|E
25|$|Although live jewelry has {{featured}} in Mayan cultural traditions for many centuries, {{it was not}} until the 1980s that the Mexican maquech beetle, a subspecies of the zopherus beetle, achieved mainstream popularity as live jewelry. The maquech beetle is a large, docile, wingless insect which is decorated with gold and semi-precious gemstones and is attached to a decorative <b>safety</b> <b>pin</b> by a chain leash. During the Mayan period, women from the Yucatán Peninsula wore maquech beetles pinned to their chests, over their hearts, to attract and sustain loving relationships. The tradition is attributed to a story from Mayan folklore, which believes that when a Mayan princess was not permitted to marry a prince from a rival clan whom she loved, she stopped eating and drinking, preferring to die than to live without her lover. In compassion with her plight, a traditional healer with magical powers transformed her into a maquech beetle, so that she could spend the rest of her life living as a beautiful brooch on the chest of her lover, close to his heart.|$|E

NASA officials concluded Grissom had not necessarily initiated the firing of the explosive hatch, which would have required pressing a plunger that required five pounds of force to depress.|$|E

According to Collins, the primary reason for developing the competition was that he [...] "loved the idea of thousands of {{people from all over the}} world connecting to create incredible things".

Harvey's books, explaining 20th-century civilization, as well as a world globe, a bible, encyclopedias, and newspapers, were to be placed inside two vaults and hermetically sealed in glass. Harvey also wanted to place in this large room: [...] "numerous small items now used in domestic and industrial life, from the size of a needle and <b>safety</b> <b>pin</b> up to a Victrola." [...] It was estimated that the construction would use 16,000 bags of cement, 30,000ft³ (850m³) of sand, 58,000ft³ (1,642m³) of gravel, and tons of corrugated steel reinforcement. The Portland Cement Association donated the service of one of its experts, who pronounced that the Pyramid would not deteriorate or suffer from erosion and would last for over a million years. To prevent water in the valley from interfering with the foundation and to shore up the low knoll to support the heavy Pyramid, Harvey constructed a [...] long retaining wall of stone and concrete.|$|E

Madonna has done for the corset and crucifix what punk did for the <b>safety</b> <b>pin.</b> Macy's New York department store was flooded with buyers, who bought the tour merchandise like the crucifix earrings and fingerless gloves." [...] The demand was so huge that Macy's had to refill the merchandise time again. Madonna's subversive antics on the tour provoked fiery and antics among the press. Rolling Stone said: [...] "Like Marilyn Monroe, Madonna is bent on epitomizing and championing a vision of female sexuality, and like Monroe she is often dismissed as an artist for doing so." [...] Suzanne Ferriss, author of On Fashion said that [...] "Virgin Tour exemplified Madonna's extended desire to treat boys as toys and her chastity belt coming off at her own whim and desire. Her dance numbers with men during the tour shows them as her underlings, accessories that she toys with and totally dominates." ...|$|E
5000|$|<b>Safety</b> <b>pins</b> are {{commonly}} used to fasten pieces of fabric or clothing together. <b>Safety</b> <b>pins,</b> or more usually a special version with an extra safe cover, called a nappy pin, are widely used to fasten cloth diapers (nappies), as the safety clasp, while remaining ingestion hazard, prevents the baby from being jabbed.

5000|$|Morton wore a jean jacket held {{together}} by <b>safety</b> <b>pins</b> as early as 1971, years before the use of <b>safety</b> <b>pins</b> became a widespread part of punk fashion. The use of <b>safety</b> <b>pins</b> in clothing and piercings was later popularized by artists such as Richard Hell, the Sex Pistols and others during the punk rock explosion of the late 70's. [...] It was a jacket that Morton had admired a few years prior on his friend and mentor, Royce Dendler, {{an assistant professor at}} Oberlin College, whom Morton met when he was 14 years of age. Morton later visited Dendler while he was attending SVA and Dendler was also living in New York at the time. Upon inquiring as to the jacket's current whereabouts, Dendler answered by pointing to the doormat below them. Morton offered to replace the doormat and asked if he could have the jacket even though it was now tattered, in need of much repair. Morton subsequently repaired the jacket using <b>safety</b> <b>pins</b> to make it wearable and liked the look so much that he gleefully added even more <b>safety</b> <b>pins.</b> [...] It's also been said that Morton wrote the lyrics to one of his earliest songs, Mr. Crab, after Dendler [...] "walked him around New York and told him to write them." [...] He recorded the song a few weeks later in September 1972 and it was eventually released in 1997 on the Those Were Different Times 3x10" [...] vinyl set on Scat Records credited to The Styrenes.|$|R

2500|$|Considering {{the early}} cemeteries of Kent, most {{relevant}} finds come from furnished graves with distinctive {{links to the}} Continent. However, there are some unique items, these include pots and urns and especially brooches, {{an important element of}} female dress that functioned as a fastener, rather like a modern <b>safety</b> <b>pin.</b> The style of brooches (called Quoits), is unique to southern England in the fifth century AD, with the greatest concentration of such items occurring in Kent. Seiichi Suzuki defines the style through an analysis of its design organisation, and, by comparing it with near-contemporary styles in Britain and on the continent, identifying those features which make it unique. He suggests that the quoit brooch style was made and remade as {{part of the process of}} construction of new group identities during the political uncertainties of the time, and sets the development of the style in the context of the socio-cultural dynamics of an emergent post-Roman society. The brooch shows that culture was not just transposed from the continent, but from an early phase a new [...] "Anglo-Saxon" [...] culture was being developed.|$|E
