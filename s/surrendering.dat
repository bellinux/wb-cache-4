2500|$|<b>Surrender,</b> {{for those}} games that allow it, {{is usually not}} {{permitted}} against a dealer blackjack; if the dealer's first card is an ace or ten, the hole card is checked {{to make sure there}} is no blackjack before <b>surrender</b> is offered. This rule protocol is consequently known as [...] "late" [...] <b>surrender.</b> The alternative, [...] "early" [...] <b>surrender,</b> gives player the option to <b>surrender</b> before the dealer checks for blackjack, or in a no-hole-card game. Early <b>surrender</b> is much more favorable to the player than late <b>surrender.</b> Most medium-strength hands should be <b>surrendered</b> against a dealer Ace if the hole card has not been checked.|$|R

This measure means that firms will face a cost of no higher than NZ$12.50 per tonne of emissions.

40|$|A tontine {{provides}} a mortality driven, age-increasing payout structure through the pooling of mortality. Because a tontine does not entail any guarantees, the payout {{structure of a}} tontine {{is determined by the}} pooling of individual characteristics of tontinists. Therefore, the <b>surrender</b> decision of single tontinists directly affects the remaining members' payouts. Nevertheless, the opportunity to <b>surrender</b> is crucial to the success of a tontine from a regulatory as well as a policyholder perspective. Therefore, this paper derives the fair <b>surrender</b> value of a tontine, first on the basis of expected values, and then incorporates the increasing payout volatility to determine an equitable <b>surrender</b> value. Results show that the <b>surrender</b> decision requires a discount on the fair <b>surrender</b> value as security for the remaining members. The discount intensifies in decreasing tontine size and increasing risk aversion. However, tontinists are less willing to <b>surrender</b> for decreasing tontine size and increasing risk aversion, creating a natural protection against tontine runs stemming from short-term liquidity shocks. Furthermore we argue that a <b>surrender</b> decision based on private information requires a discount on the fair <b>surrender</b> value as well...|$|R
50|$|The {{value of}} the {{investment}} is often subject to a <b>surrender</b> charge in determining the cash value.
