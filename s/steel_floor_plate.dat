These highly dynamic and slender structure are the engineering response to planning, aesthetic and environmental influences, but are prone to excessive and complex vibration. A number of design codes and practice guides provided information to engineers for vibration mitigation However, they are limited to very simple load function applied to a few uncoupled translational modes of excitation. Motivated {{by the need to}} address the knowledge gaps in this area, the investigations described in this paper focused on synchronous multi-modal and coupled excitation of the floor plate and footbridge with considerations for torsinal effects. The results showed the potential for adverse dynamic response from multi-modal and coupled excitation influenced by patterned loading, structure geometry, stiffness distribution, directional effects, forcing functions based on activity frequency and duration of foot contact, and modal participation. It was also shown that higher harmonics of the load frequency can excite higher modes in the composite floor structure. Such responsive behaviour is prevalent mainly in slender and lightweight construction and not in stiffer and heavier structural systems. The analytical techniques and methods used in these investigations can supplement the current limited code and best practice provisions for mitigating the impact of human induced vibrations in slender structural systems...|$|E

5000|$|Induction of the <b>floor</b> <b>plate</b> during {{embryogenesis}} of vertebrate embryos {{has been}} studied extensively in chick and zebrafish and {{occurs as a result}} of a complex signaling network among tissues, the details of which have yet to be fully refined. Currently there are several competing lines of thought. First, <b>floor</b> <b>plate</b> differentiation may be mediated by inductive signaling from the underlying notochord, an axial mesoderm derived signaling structure. This is supported experimentally in chick, in which <b>floor</b> <b>plate</b> induction, as well as associative ventral nervous tissue differentiation, is mediated by the secreted signaling molecule Sonic hedgehog (Shh). Shh is expressed in a gradient with highest concentration localized in the notochord and <b>floor</b> <b>plate.</b> In vitro tissue grafting experiments show that removal of this molecule prevents differentiation of the <b>floor</b> <b>plate,</b> whereas its ectopic expression induces differentiation of <b>floor</b> <b>plate</b> cells. [...] An alternative view proposes that neural tube <b>floor</b> <b>plate</b> cells stem from precursor cells which migrate directly from axial mesoderm. Through chick - quail hybrid experiments as well as genetic interaction experiments in zebrafish, it appears that notochord and <b>floor</b> <b>plate</b> cells originate from a common precursor. Furthermore, in zebrafish, Nodal signaling is required for differentiation of medial <b>floor</b> <b>plate</b> cells whereas Shh is expendable. These data may indicate that the <b>floor</b> <b>plate</b> induction mechanism in amniotes and anamniotes differs. [...] To reconcile these differences, a dual-mode induction model has been proposed in chick. In this model, exclusively ectodermal cells are induced to become medial <b>floor</b> <b>plate</b> during gastrulation by prechordal mesoderm, possibly through Nodal signaling. Later in development during neurulation, extended contact and interaction between notochord and fated <b>floor</b> <b>plate</b> cells causes differentiation, suggesting a cooperative effect between Nodal and Shh signaling.|$|R
40|$|To {{begin to}} {{reconcile}} models of <b>floor</b> <b>plate</b> {{formation in the}} vertebrate neural tube, we have performed experiments aimed at understanding {{the development of the}} early <b>floor</b> <b>plate</b> in the chick embryo. Using real-time analyses of cell behaviour, we provide evidence that the principal contributor to the early neural midline, the future anterior <b>floor</b> <b>plate,</b> exists as a separate population of <b>floor</b> <b>plate</b> precursor cells in the epiblast of the gastrula stage embryo, and does not share a lineage with axial mesoderm. Analysis of the tissue interactions associated with differentiation of these cells to a <b>floor</b> <b>plate</b> fate reveals a role for the nascent prechordal mesoderm, indicating that more than one inductive event is associated with <b>floor</b> <b>plate</b> formation {{along the length of the}} neuraxis. We show that Nr 1, a chick nodal homologue, is expressed in the nascent prechordal mesoderm and we provide evidence that Nodal signalling can cooperate with Shh to induce the epiblast precursors to a floor-plate fate. These results indicate that a shared lineage with axial mesoderm cells is not a pre-requisite for <b>floor</b> <b>plate</b> differentiation and suggest parallels between the development of the <b>floor</b> <b>plate</b> in amniote and anamniote embryos...|$|R

Using human embryonic stem cells (hESC) as a model of neurogenesis, we sought to determine how <b>floor</b> <b>plate</b> cells may be temporarily specified by SHH signaling during human embryogenesis. We found that inhibition of both GSK 3 β and activin/nodal pathways in hESC induces a cellular state of SOX 2 +/PAX 6 - expression, we describe as "pre-neuroepithelial. " Exposure of SHH during this pre-neuroepithelial period causes the expression of GLI transcription factors to function as activators and consequently upregulate expression of the <b>floor</b> <b>plate</b> marker, FOXA 2, while also supressing PAX 6 expression to inhibit neuroepithelial fate.

40|$|AbstractBackground: The {{differentiation}} of <b>floor</b> <b>plate</b> cells and motor neurons in the vertebrate neural tube {{appears to be}} induced by signals from the notochord. The secreted protein encoded by the Sonic hedgehog (Shh) gene is expressed by axial midline cells and can induce <b>floor</b> <b>plate</b> cells in vivo and in vitro. Motor neurons can also be induced in vitro by cells that synthesize Sonic hedgehog protein (Shh). It remains unclear, however, if the motor-neuron-inducing activity of Shh depends on the synthesis of a distinct signaling molecule by <b>floor</b> <b>plate</b> cells. To resolve this issue, we have developed an in vitro assay which uncouples the notochord-mediated induction of motor neurons from <b>floor</b> <b>plate</b> differentiation, and have used this assay to examine whether Shh induces motor neurons {{in the absence of}} <b>floor</b> <b>plate</b> differentiation. Results <b>Floor</b> <b>plate</b> cells and motor neurons were induced in neural plate explants grown in contact with the notochord, but only motor neurons were induced when explants were separated from the notochord. COS cells transfected with Shh induced both <b>floor</b> <b>plate</b> cells and motor neurons when grown in contact with neural plate explants, whereas only motor neurons were induced when the explants were grown at a distance from Shh-transfected COS cells. Direct transfection of neural plate cells with an Shh-expression construct induced both <b>floor</b> <b>plate</b> cells and motor neurons, with motor neuron differentiation occurring prior to, or coincidentally with, <b>floor</b> <b>plate</b> differentiation. The induction of motor neurons appears, therefore, not to depend on <b>floor</b> <b>plate</b> differentiation. Conclusion The induction of motor neurons by Shh does not depend on distinct floor-plate-derived signaling molecules. Shh can, therefore, initiate the {{differentiation of}} two cell types that are generated in the ventral region of the neural tube. These results show that the early development of motor neurons involves the inductive action of Shh, whereas the survival of motor neurons at later stages of embryonic development requires neurotrophic factors...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{development}} of the vertebrate dorsal midline (<b>floor</b> <b>plate,</b> notochord, and hypochord) has been an area of classical research and debate. Previous studies in vertebrates have led to contrasting models for the roles of Shh and Notch signaling in specification of the <b>floor</b> <b>plate,</b> by late inductive or early allocation mechanisms, respectively. Here, we show that Notch signaling plays an integral role in cell fate decisions in the dorsal midline of Xenopus laevis, similar to that observed in zebrafish and chick. Notch signaling promotes <b>floor</b> <b>plate</b> and hypochord fates over notochord, but has variable effects on Shh expression in the midline. In contrast to previous reports in frog, we find that Shh signaling is not required for <b>floor</b> <b>plate</b> vs. notochord decisions and plays a minor role in <b>floor</b> <b>plate</b> specification, where it acts in parallel to Notch signaling. As in zebrafish, Shh signaling is required for specification of the lateral <b>floor</b> <b>plate</b> in the frog. We also find that the medial <b>floor</b> <b>plate</b> in Xenopus comprises two distinct populations of cells, each dependent upon different signals for its specification. Using expression analysis of several midline markers, and dissection of functional relationships, we propose a revised allocation mechanism of dorsal midline specification in Xenopus.

Our results showed that SBA sensitive glycoconjugates react and change in <b>floor</b> <b>plate,</b> notochordal cells and surrounding extracellular matrix and these changes were significant (P< 0. 05). Extensive differences between GalNac sensitive lectins were observed during motoneuron differentiation. There was no reaction with other tested GalNac lectins. Furthermore we observed significant changes (P< 0. 05) in fucose glycoconjugates during notochordal development. The results suggest that the timing and distribution of SBA sensitive glycoconjugates may play a key role(s) in interactions and subsequent formation of adjacent tissues such as <b>floor</b> <b>plate</b> and notochord during critical period of morphogenesis. Our finding also showed that glycoconjugates with fucose terminal sugar may play a role(s) in notochordal development but probably have no function on <b>floor</b> <b>plate</b> development.

40|$|Experiments {{involving}} the random insertion of foreign DNA constructs into the genome have frequently had unanticipated but informative consequences. In the Tg 4 line of transgenic mice, an hsp 68 -lacZ transgene caused an insertional mutation of the dystonia musculorum (dt) locus. In the same line, the transgene gained an ectopic expression {{pattern in the}} neural tube <b>floor</b> <b>plate.</b> The co-occurence of these events suggested that the dt phenotype of postnatal sensory neuropathy might arise from a primary defect expressed in <b>floor</b> <b>plate</b> cells. To test this hypothesis, the cellular target of the dt mutation was determined by analyzing $dt/dt leftrightarrow +/+$ chimeras, in which wild type neurons and their axons were identified by their expression of a human neurofilament transgene. In these chimeras, axonal pathology was confined to the axons of mutant neurons, thus defining an intrinsic neuronal dt defect, and ruling out an extrinsic influence of <b>floor</b> <b>plate</b> cells. The expression of $ beta$-galactosidase in the Tg 4 line was further used to examine, using histochemical staining, the morphology of <b>floor</b> <b>plate</b> cells, which {{play a role in}} the guidance of commissural axons. <b>Floor</b> <b>plate</b> cells were found to possess a number of morphological specializations which appeared to establish a high degree of membrane apposition with commissural axons. Unexpectedly, $ beta$-galactosidase activity was also detected adjacent to stained <b>floor</b> <b>plate</b> cells in profiles that could not be distinguished from midline axon segments, suggesting that a process of macromolecular transfer may normally operate between <b>floor</b> <b>plate</b> cells and commissural axons...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a non-invasive technique for the repair of ancient wooden <b>floors.</b> <b>Steel</b> <b>plates</b> are glued {{on one side}} only by epoxy-adhesive into longitudinal grooves {{in order to allow}} the free swelling and shrinkage of the wood in the direction transversal to the plate glueing surface, thus reducing the risk of plate delamination. A set of high strength steel nails provides load transmission from the steel plates to the wooden beam in the case of loss of adhesion due to fire or delamination. This technique was used to repair a precious beam in a 15 th-century wooden floor in Palazzo Calini (Brescia, Italy). The technique requires particular attention because it might be affected by the delamination of the glued reinforcement due to stress concentration, which occurs {{at the end of the}} repairing element or at any cracks in the repaired beam. Results of experimental studies on delamination phenomenon investigated by means of the Moiré interferometry analysis are also presented. These show that the risk of plate debonding can be markedly reduced by the capability of the sapwood to develop plastic strain. The wooden floor has been monitored for more than fourteen years, confirming the effectiveness of the adopted technique...|$|R
40|$|The <b>floor</b> <b>plate,</b> a cell {{group that}} {{develops}} at the midline of the neural plate {{in response to}} inductive signals from the notochord, has been implicated in the control of dorsoventral neural pattern. The frog Pintallavis gene, encoding {{a member of the}} HNF- 3 /fork head transcription factor family, is expressed in the notochord and in midline neural plate cells that give rise to the <b>floor</b> <b>plate.</b> To examine whether Pintallavis might be involved in regulating the differentiation of the <b>floor</b> <b>plate,</b> we ectopically expressed Pintallavis by injection of synthetic mRNA into two-cell frog embryos. Injection of Pintallavis mRNA resulted in the ectopic expression of F-spondin, a gene encoding a floor plate-specific adhesion molecule, at the dorsal midline of the neural tube. The expression of Pintallavis in midline cells may therefore contribute to the establishment of the <b>floor</b> <b>plate</b> fate...|$|R
