40|$|Research {{objective}} Due to {{the significance}} of tacit knowledge in management consulting industry, the successful customer knowledge management (CKM) is critical. Furthermore, when client relationships are crucial, the efficient CKM can create obvious business benefits. The research object is case company’s <b>strategic</b> <b>client</b> teams, which serve company’s strategic clients, which are big (i. e. different industries, organizational structures, and locations). Therefore, the research context is particularly interesting due {{to the importance of}} CKM in these client teams. The goal of this thesis is to explore the relationship of organizational learning processes and capabilities in CKM. Because there is limited research in linking these constructs together and hence the further goal of this thesis is to provide new insights on how CKM is influenced by organizational learning processes and capabilities {{in the context of a}} Finnish management consulting company. Methodology The foundations of this thesis lie in a qualitative single case study and utilization of abductive research approach. Research data was collected through ten semi-structured one-to-one interviews with <b>strategic</b> <b>client</b> team members. Organizational learning processes acted as the main theoretical framework in the interviews. The research data was analyzed through thematic content analysis. Research Findings The main findings of this study were based on linking the CKM, organizational learning processes, and capabilities. Organizational learning processes facilitated the understanding through which processes the client teams manage customer knowledge and the capabilities that influence both CKM and organizational learning processes. It was explored that especially the market-sensing capability was strongly linked to organizational learning processes. Additionally, organizational learning processes are strongly interrelated influencing each other in different phases of organizational learning. Thus, organizational learning should not be viewed as a straightforward process. Furthermore, of the organizational learning processes, organizational memory was the most significant process in facilitating information acquisition, distribution, and utilization. Also, organizational memory and information and storage and retrieval processes related to it were the key development points in the case company. Regarding the management of customer knowledge, assets including customer database, data quality, and human resources were crucial elements in facilitating organizational capabilities and learning processes. Overall, the relationships of CKM, learning processes, and capabilities should be comprehended in enhancing the management of customer knowledge...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This work {{focuses on}} BitTyrant, a <b>strategic</b> <b>client</b> {{that has been}} {{recently}} proposed {{as an alternative to}} BitTorrent. BitTyrant tries to determine the exact amount of contribution necessary to maximize its download rate by dynamically adapting and shaping the upload rate allocated to its neighbors. In this paper we analyze in details the various mechanisms used by BitTyrant and precisely identify their contribution to the increased performance of the client. Our findings indicate that the performance gain is due to the increased number of connections established by a BitTyrant client, rather than for its subtle uplink allocation algorithm; surprisingly, BitTyrant reveals to be altruistic and particularly efficient in disseminating the content, especially during the initial phase of the distribution process. The apparent gain of a single Bit-Tyrant client, however, disappears {{in the case of a}} widespread adoption: our results indicate a severe loss of efficiency that we analyzed in details. In contrast, a widespread adoption of the latest version of the mainline BitTorrent client would provide increased benefit for all peers. ...|$|E

40|$|BitTorrent is {{a hugely}} popular {{peer-to-peer}} file sharing system. In countries where broadband Internet is widespread, BitTorrent accounts {{for as much}} as 70 % of the overall Internet traffic. In contrast, in developing countries, BitTorrent is almost unusable on the typically low bandwidth dialup connections. In this paper, we present a BitTorrent client called BitMate that is designed to enhance the performance of hosts with lowbandwidth connections. Importantly, BitMate enhances the performance of low-bandwidth nodes without cheating, circumventing the fairness policy of BitTorrent or adversely affecting the performance of other peers. In fact, BitMate drives its performance by scrupulously implementing the fairness philosophy of BitTorrent. BitMate outperforms vanilla BitTorrent by as much as 70 % in download performance, {{while at the same time}} improving upload contribution by as much as 1000 %! BitMate also outperforms <b>strategic</b> <b>clients</b> like BitTyrant in low-bandwidth conditions by as much as 60 % in download performance...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—We {{study the}} problem of {{designing}} downlink scheduling policy for wireless networks with both real-time and non-real-time flows. Most existing scheduling policies for these networks unfairly favor one type of flows. As a result, <b>strategic</b> <b>clients</b> may lie about their types of traffic {{in order to get}} more service from the base station. To counter these strategic behaviors, a scheduling policy should be incentive compatible in the sense that clients cannot improve their performance by lying. We propose a novel scheduling policy that is incentive compatible. The policy can be easily implemented as a thin layer between the Network layer and the MAC layer. It can also work {{with a wide range of}} upper-layer and lower-layer protocols while providing satisfactory performance to both real-time and non-real-time flows. Simulation results show that this policy outperforms other widely used policies by large margins under a variety of scenarios. I...|$|R

Our data set also incorporates data on project profitability that presents us with the opportunity to test the efficiency of the risk estimation.

40|$|In this thesis, {{we studied}} {{the problem of}} {{designing}} a down link scheduling policy to serve multiple types of clients from a base station in a time-varying wireless network. An ideal scheduling policy is fair among the clients, provides reliability to the clients, achieves high system throughput and prevents <b>strategic</b> <b>clients</b> from choosing incorrect means. The existing scheduling policies fail to achieve {{one or more of}} these features. The Proportional Fair scheduling policy for example, fails to provide reliability to the real time clients, while Round Robin policy provides reliability to the clients but fails to achieve high system throughput in a time-varying wireless network. Apart from these policies, there are scheduling policies which prioritize clients based on their delay requirements. Here, a client with lower priority may choose incorrect means like claiming false types of flows to obtain a better performance. A non-real time client may pretend to be a real time client if doing so, which might aid it to achieve better performance in terms of average throughput. We proposed a new scheduling policy that is not only proportionally fair but also provides reliability to the mixture of real time and non-real time clients over a shared wireless channel. Our proposed policy aims to serve clients with different service requirements and provides best service to the clients which furnish true information about their service requirements; the client claiming false service requirements is penalized with the reduced performance. We theoretically demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm by considering uniform distribution of service rates of all the clients. We then provide extensive simulation results of our scheduling policy under the fast fading Rayleigh model to show that this policy can be easily extended in wireless networks. We also show that our policy outperforms existing policies in providing better reliability to the clients and unlike other common policies, our policy degrades the performance of a client that chooses incorrect means...|$|R

40|$|There is an {{increasing}} recognition of outsourcing firms as new organizational forms with unique systems and practices. This paper uses a configurational approach to integrate learnings from outsourcing literature, organization and management theory, strategic management and strategic human resource management {{in order to understand}} similarities and differences between outsourcing firms and their performance.

Five dominant configurations of outsourcing firms emerge, namely, clear-eyed strategists, adapting professionals, focalizing artisans, conservative controllers and overambitious associates. Further examination with Kruskal Wallis One-Way ANOVA and Tamhane. s T 2 test indicates that specific configurations of outsourcing firms are indeed associated with better performance across a variety of organizational performance parameters. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. While {{supplier}} relationship {{management is}} considered essential among supply management professionals, deliberate internal relationship management is often overlooked.
