50|$|CCD readers use {{an array}} of {{hundreds}} of tiny light <b>sensors</b> <b>lined</b> up {{in a row in}} the head of the reader. Each sensor measures the intensity of the light immediately in front of it. Each individual light sensor in the CCD reader is extremely small and because there are hundreds of <b>sensors</b> <b>lined</b> up in a row, a voltage pattern identical to the pattern in a bar code is generated in the reader by sequentially measuring the voltages across each sensor in the row. The important difference between a CCD reader and a pen or laser scanner is that the CCD reader is measuring emitted ambient light from the bar code whereas pen or laser scanners are measuring reflected light of a specific frequency originating from the scanner itself.|$|R

50|$|Since it is {{much easier}} to {{manufacture}} a high-quality linear CCD array with only thousands of pixels than a CCD matrix with millions, very high resolution linear CCD camera backs were available much earlier than their CCD matrix counterparts. For example, you could buy an (albeit expensive) camera back with over 7,000 pixel horizontal resolution in the mid-1990s. However, , it is still difficult to buy a comparable CCD matrix camera of the same resolution. Rotating line cameras, with about 10,000 color pixels in its <b>sensor</b> <b>line,</b> are able, , to capture about 120,000 lines during one full 360 degree rotation, thereby creating a single digital image of 1,200 Megapixels.|$|E

Minco's combination etched foil heater-platinum wire sensors were used on many NASA projects including the 1976 Viking Lander (heated soil samples) and Skylab (Inertial Guidance System).

40|$|This {{research}} {{presents a}} case study of production monitoring on an aerospace composite component: the hinge arm of the droop nose mechanism on the Airbus A 380 wing leading edge. A sensor network composed of Fibre Bragg Gratings, capacitive sensors for cure monitoring and thermocouples was embedded in its fibre reinforced lay-up and measurements were acquired throughout its Resin Transfer Moulding production process. Two main challenges had to be overcome: first, the integration of the <b>sensor</b> <b>lines</b> in the existing Resin Transfer Moulding mould without modifying it; second, the demoulding of the component without damaging the <b>sensor</b> <b>lines.</b> The proposed embedding solution has proved successful. The wavelength shifts of the Fibre Bragg Gratings were observed from the initial production stages, over the resin injection, the complete curing of the resin and the cooling-down prior to demoulding. The sensors proved to be sensitive to detecting the resin flow front, vacuum and pressure increase into the mould and the temperature increase caused by the resin curing. Measurements were also acquired during the post-curing cycle. Residual strains during all steps of the process were derived from the sensors’ wavelength shift, showing values up to 0. 2 % in compression. Moreover, the capacitive sensors were able to follow-up the curing degree during the production process. The sensors proved able to detect the resin flow front, whereas thermocouples could not measure an appreciable increase of temperature {{due to the fact that}} the resin had the same temperature as the mould...|$|R

40|$|Advanced {{composites}} {{are being}} extensively used for aerospace structures {{due to the}} high stiffness to weight and high strength to weight ratios. Measuring internal strains of composite structures is of great interest {{with respect to the}} structural integrity of aerospace structures. A large number of sensors are required for large-scale structures such as aircraft. Fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensor system based on the wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) technology offers a versatile and powerful one for strain monitoring of large structures due to the advantage of multiplexing capability. In this paper, we present an improved FBG sensor system using a wavelength-swept fiber laser (WSFL). The WSFL provides unique and powerful output characteristics useful for a large number of sensor interrogations without any other expensive optic devices such as optical switches. As a practical application of aircraft structures, we demonstrate 24 FBG sensors were used to monitor strains of the smart composite wing box model in the bending test. 3 sensor lines are embedded into upper skin and 1 <b>sensor</b> <b>line</b> is embedded into front spar of composite wing box.

40|$|Normal {{embryonic}} {{development and}} tissue homeostasis require precise levels of retinoic acid (RA) signaling. Despite {{the importance of}} appropriate embryonic RA signaling levels, the mechanisms underlying congenital defects due to perturbations of RA signaling are not completely understood. Here, we report that zebrafish embryos deficient for RA receptor ab 1 (RARab 1), a conserved RAR splice variant, have enlarged hearts with increased cardiomyocyte (CM) specification, which are surprisingly the consequence of increased RA signaling. Importantly, depletion of RARab 2 or concurrent depletion of RARab 1 and RARab 2 also results in increased RA signaling, suggesting this effect is a broader consequence of RAR depletion. Concurrent depletion of RARab 1 and Cyp 26 a 1, an enzyme that facilitates degradation of RA, and employment of a novel transgenic RA <b>sensor</b> <b>line</b> {{support the hypothesis that}} the increases in RA signaling in RAR deficient embryos are the result of increased embryonic RA coupled with compensatory RAR expression.

40|$|The Ko {{displacement}} theory previously formulated for deformed shape {{predictions of}} nonuniform beam structures is further developed mathematically. The further-developed displacement equations are expressed explicitly {{in terms of}} geometrical parameters of the beam and bending strains at equally spaced strain-sensing stations along the multiplexed fiber-optic <b>sensor</b> <b>line</b> installed on the bottom surface of the beam. The bending strain data can then be input into the displacement equations for calculations of local slopes, deflections, and cross-sectional twist angles for generating the overall deformed shapes of the nonuniform beam.

The high degree of accuracy of the further-developed displacement theory for nonuniform beams is validated by finite-element analysis of various nonuniform beam structures. Such structures include tapered tubular beams, depth-tapered unswept and swept wing boxes, width-tapered wing boxes, and double-tapered wing boxes, all under combined bending and torsional loads.

40|$|Digital cameras have {{spectral}} and radiometric properties {{superior to}} analogue film cameras. Due to its radiometrically stable construction the ADS 40 sensor {{is capable of}} making images for cartography as well as remote sensing applications. For the increased size of current projects, for sensor fusion, {{as well as for}} change detection purposes it is necessary to produce comparable images for different flight conditions (weather, camera system, etc.). This is not possible with classical film cameras since comparable images require the absolute radiometric calibration of the imaging system, before atmospheric correction, reflectance calibration and BRDF correction can take place. The methods for satellite laboratory calibration can be also used for digital airborne cameras. A laboratory calibration of the ADS 40 is made with a calibrated integrating sphere in order to determine dark signal, lens falloff, and radiometric gain for each <b>sensor</b> <b>line.</b> For the ADS 40 a linear radiometric model is sufficiently accurate. The knowledge of the system spectral response allows a more accurate calculation of the radiometric calibration coefficients and is a check for system integrity.

40|$|We apply {{persistent}} scatterer interferometry (PSI) {{techniques to}} {{synthetic aperture radar}} (SAR) data from ERS and ENVISAT satellites on the Lesina Marina area, a coastal tourist village in Apulia, Southern Italy, where the excavation of a canal exposed grey micro- and meso-crystalline gypsum which is now showing a high density of cavities and sinkholes due to gravitational collapse processes. We observe PS objects undergoing displacements, along the <b>sensor</b> <b>line</b> of sight, forming the same relatively smooth pattern in all the processed data stacks. Vertical displacement rates, derived through integration of ascending and descending geometries, reach about 4  mm/year on locations adjacent to the canal, gently decreasing towards {{the western end of}} the built-up area. High-precision leveling measurements, performed in 1999 and 2010, reveal a substantial agreement with the ENVISAT PSI data, taking into account a small bias due to the choice of the leveling reference point. The dataset, thus validated, suggests the presence of an uplift phenomenon going on steadily for the entire timespan covered by the SAR observations (1992 – 2009). These observations, supported by petrographic data and in situ investigations, seem only in part compatible with a residual diapirism, and hint instead to more complex processes, such as a combination of diapirism and the hydration of the residual anhydrite in the core of the gypsum mass. These results confirm the importance of the integration between in situ, geologic and geophysical, remotely sensed investigations, as the latter often represent an essential tool to infer whether a given phenomenon, which can be hypothesized by the former, is presently under development...|$|E
