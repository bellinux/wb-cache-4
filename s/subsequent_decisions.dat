5|$|The clause's meaning {{with regard}} to a child of legal {{immigrants}} was tested in United States v. Wong Kim Ark (1898). The Supreme Court held that under the Fourteenth Amendment, a man born within the United States to Chinese citizens who have a permanent domicile and residence in the United States and are carrying on business in the United States—and whose parents were not employed in a diplomatic or other official capacity by a foreign power—was {{a citizen of the}} United States. <b>Subsequent</b> <b>decisions</b> have applied the principle to the children of foreign nationals of non-Chinese descent.|$|E
5|$|The Court of Appeal {{also held}} that legal {{precedents}} from other Commonwealth jurisdictions supported {{a rejection of}} the subjective test in favour of the objective test. The subjective test was applied in Liversidge v. Anderson (1941) and subsequently affirmed in Greene v. Secretary of State for Home Affairs (1941). However, these decisions had been departed from in <b>subsequent</b> <b>decisions</b> by the Privy Council and House of Lords. These courts had rejected the subjective test applied by the majority in Liversidge, preferring the objective test applied by Lord Atkin in his dissenting judgment. In the light of these developments, the Malaysian case of Karam Singh v. Menteri Hal Ehwal Dalam Negeri (Minister for Home Affairs), Malaysia (1969), which had applied the test in Liversidge and which the respondents' counsel had relied on in support of the subjective test, could no longer be considered good law. Additionally, Teh Cheng Poh v. Public Prosecutor (1978) decided by the Privy Council on appeal from Malaysia, was referred to by the Court in support of the objective test. The case concerned the exercise of discretionary power under the Malaysian Internal Security Act, which the ISA of Singapore is derived from.|$|E

500|$|Almost {{immediately}} after the decision, the BIA, on directions from Assistant Secretary of the Interior Kenneth Smith, proposed federal regulations that would have severely limited {{the ability of the}} tribes to impose severance taxes. [...] Following numerous complaints from the tribes, the BIA abandoned that plan. [...] The Jicarilla tribe has also purchased the Palmer Oil Company, becoming the first Indian tribe to have 100% ownership of an oil production firm. [...] The case is a landmark case in Native American case law, having been cited in approximately 400 law review articles as of July 2010. [...] Almost all tribes that have mineral deposits now impose a severance tax, based on the Merrion decision and has been used as the basis for <b>subsequent</b> <b>decisions</b> supporting tribal taxing authority.

2500|$|The Exceptional Access Framework {{was created}} in 2003 when John B. Taylor was Under Secretary of the US Treasury for International Affairs. [...] The new Framework became fully {{operational}} in February 2003 and it was applied in the <b>subsequent</b> <b>decisions</b> on Argentina and Brazil. Its purpose was to place some sensible rules and limits {{on the way the}} IMF makes loans to support governments with debt problem—especially in emerging markets—and thereby move away from the bailout mentality of the 1990s. Such a reform was essential for ending the crisis atmosphere that then existed in emerging markets. [...] The reform was closely related to, and put in place nearly simultaneously with, the actions of several emerging market countries to place collective action clauses in their bond contracts.|$|E
2500|$|In the 1970s and '80s Moldova {{received}} substantial {{investment from}} {{the budget of the}} USSR to develop industrial, scientific facilities, as well as housing. In 1971 the Council of Ministers of the USSR adopted a decision [...] "About the measures for further development of Kishinev city" [...] that secured more than one billion rubles of funds for Chișinău alone from the USSR budget. <b>Subsequent</b> <b>decisions</b> directed large amounts of funds and brought qualified specialists from all over the USSR to further develop the Moldavian SSR. Such an allocation of USSR assets was influenced by the fact that the-then leader of the Soviet Union, Leonid Brezhnev, was the First Secretary of the local Communist Party in the 1950s. These investments stopped in 1991 with the dissolution of the Soviet Union, when Moldova became independent.|$|E
2500|$|The Farmer board also {{ruled that}} strikes {{were the only}} {{activity}} protected by the NLRA. [...] Anything less than a strike was not.

The Farmer board declared these [...] "intermittent" [...] strikes [...] "neither a strike nor work" [...] and thus unprotected activity, and upheld the employer's termination of the workers. The majority did not define the term [...] "intermittent strike" [...] in Pacific Telephone and Telegraph Co. nor in two <b>subsequent</b> <b>decisions</b> upholding the ruling.

2500|$|Plumbbob Rainier was detonated at 899ft {{underground}} on 19 September 1957. The 1.7 kt explosion was {{the first}} to be entirely contained underground, producing no fallout. The test took place in a 1,600 – 2,000ft horizontal tunnel {{in the shape of a}} hook. The hook [...] "was designed so explosive force will seal off the non-curved portion of tunnel nearest the detonation before gases and fission fragments can be vented around the curve of the tunnel's hook". This test would become the prototype for larger, more powerful tests. Rainier was announced in advance, so that seismic stations could attempt to record a signal. Analysis of samples collected after the test enabled scientists to develop an understanding of underground explosions that [...] "persists essentially unaltered today". The information would later provide a basis for <b>subsequent</b> <b>decisions</b> to agree to the Limited Test Ban Treaty.|$|E
2500|$|Scholars have {{extensively}} {{criticized the}} decision. [...] According to Professor Bethany Berger, [...] "By patching together {{bits and pieces}} of history and isolated quotes from nineteenth century cases, and relegating contrary evidence to footnotes or ignoring it altogether, the majority created a legal basis for denying jurisdiction out of whole cloth." [...] Rather than legal precedent, the holding was [...] "dictated by the Court's assumptions that tribal courts could not fairly exercise jurisdiction over outsiders and that the effort to exercise such jurisdiction was a modern upstart of little importance to tribal concerns. [...] Professor Philip Frickey describes Oliphant, along with the <b>subsequent</b> <b>decisions</b> limiting tribal jurisdiction over non-Indians, as rooted in a “normatively unattractive judicial colonial impulse,” while Professor Robert Williams condemns the decision as [...] "legal auto-genocide" [...] According to Dr. Bruce Duthu, the case showed [...] "that the project of imperialism {{is alive and well in}} Indian Country and that courts can now get into the action." [...] Professor Duthu continues"The Oliphant Court essentially elevated a local level conflict between a private citizen and an Indian tribe into a collision of framework interests between two sovereigns, and in the process revived the most negative and destructive aspects of colonialism as it relates to Indian rights. This is a principal reason the decision has attracted so much negative reaction...Oliphant's impact on the development of federal Indian law and life on the ground in Indian Country has been nothing short of revolutionary. The opinion gutted the notion of full territorial sovereignty as it applies to Indian tribes." ...|$|E
60|$|This meal taken, {{the duty}} that came next was to {{provision}} my raft. It took but little time or labour. The cabin stores were quite accessible; {{and a bag}} of pilot-bread, another of that peculiarly American invention, called crackers--some smoked beef, a case of liquors, and two breakers of water, formed my principal stock. To this I added a pot of butter, with some capital smoked herrings, and some anchovies. We lived well in the cabin of the Dawn, and there was no difficulty in making all the provision that six or eight men would have needed for a month. Perceiving that the raft, now it was relieved from the weight of the sails and rigging, was not much affected by the stores, I began to look about me in quest of anything valuable I might wish to save. The preparations I had been making created a sort of confidence in their success; a confidence (hope might be the better word) that was as natural, perhaps, as it was unreasonable. I examined the different objects that offered, with a critical comparison of their value and future usefulness, that would have been absurd, had it not afforded a melancholy proof of the tenacity of our desires in matters of this nature. It is certainly a sad thing to abandon a ship, at sea, with all her appliances, and with a knowledge of the gold that she cost. The Dawn, with her cargo, must have stood me in eighty thousand dollars, or even more; and here was I about to quit her, out on the ocean, with an almost moral certainty that not a cent of the money could be, or would be, recovered from the insurers. These last only took risks against the accidents of the ocean, fire included; and there was a legal obligation on the insured to see that the vessel was properly found and manned. It was my own opinion that no accident would have occurred to the ship, in the late gale, had the full crew been on board; and that the ship was not sufficiently manned was, in a legal sense my own fault. I was bound to let the English carry her into port, and to await judgment,--the law supposing that justice would have been done in the premises. The law might have been greatly mistaken in this respect; but potentates never acknowledge their blunders. If I was wronged in the detention, the law presumed suitable damages. It is true, I might be ruined by the delay, through the debts left behind me; but the law, with all its purity, cared nothing for that. Could I have shown a loss by means of a falling market, I might have obtained redress, provided the court chose to award it, and provided the party did not appeal; or, if he did, that the <b>subsequent</b> <b>decisions</b> supported the first; and provided,--all the decrees being in my favour,--my Lord Harry Dermond could have paid a few thousands in damages:--a problem to be solved, in itself.|$|E
