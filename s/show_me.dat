25|$|The blacking-warehouse was {{the last}} house on the {{left-hand}} side of the way, at old Hungerford Stairs. It was a crazy, tumble-down old house, abutting of course on the river, and literally overrun with rats. Its wainscoted rooms, and its rotten floors and staircase, and the old grey rats swarming down in the cellars, {{and the sound of}} their squeaking and scuffling coming up the stairs at all times, and the dirt and decay of the place, rise up visibly before me, as if I were there again. The counting-house was on the first floor, looking over the coal-barges and the river. There was a recess in it, in which I was to sit and work. My work was to cover the pots of paste-blacking; first with a piece of oil-paper, and then with a piece of blue paper; to tie them round with a string; and then to clip the paper close and neat, all round, until it looked as smart as a pot of ointment from an apothecary's shop. When a certain number of grosses of pots had attained this pitch of perfection, I was to paste on each a printed label, and then go on again with more pots. Two or three other boys were kept at similar duty down-stairs on similar wages. One of them came up, in a ragged apron and a paper cap, on the first Monday morning, to <b>show</b> <b>me</b> the trick of using the string and tying the knot. His name was Bob Fagin; and I took the liberty of using his name, long afterwards, in Oliver Twist.|$|E
500|$|According to Smith, [...] "The song {{is about}} hyperventilating—kissing and fainting to the floor."

Smith said the opening line of the song ("Show me, <b>show</b> <b>me,</b> <b>show</b> <b>me</b> how you do that trick") refers to his childhood memories of mastering magic tricks, but added [...] "on another , it's about a seduction trick, from much later in my life".|$|E

500|$|By this time, while {{dismissing the}} {{possibility}} of a Pixies reunion, Thompson had begun to incorporate an increasing number of the band's songs into Catholics concerts, as well as including Santiago in his solo work again. Black and the Catholics continued to release records; two separate albums, Black Letter Days and Devil's Workshop, were released simultaneously in 2002. Devil's Workshop included the song [...] "Velvety" [...] (...) , a version of the Pixies song [...] "Velvety Instrumental Version" [...] (written by Black as a teenager) with lyrics. The song {{was one of the first}} signs that he had acknowledged his past work with the Pixies in his solo output. A sixth album with the Catholics, <b>Show</b> <b>Me</b> Your Tears, was released in 2003. <b>Show</b> <b>Me</b> Your Tears title and many of the songs in it were inspired by Thompson's recent divorce and entry into therapy.|$|E
