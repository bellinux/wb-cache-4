30|$|In {{this work}} we have {{introduced}} {{a completely new}} type of <b>time</b> <b>scales</b> - ‘changing periodic time scales’, and examined some of their properties. The main propose {{of this kind of}} <b>time</b> <b>scales</b> is to resolve the problems from an arbitrary <b>time</b> <b>scale</b> to the ones on periodic <b>time</b> <b>scales.</b> Our decomposition theorem of <b>time</b> <b>scales</b> divides an arbitrary <b>time</b> <b>scale</b> into a countable union of periodic <b>time</b> <b>scales.</b> This result not only provides us with a new approach to investigate problems by the known methods on periodic <b>time</b> <b>scales,</b> but also opens up new avenues to study local properties of the functions defined on <b>time</b> <b>scales.</b> It is clearly shown that the changing-periodic <b>time</b> <b>scales</b> are more general than the <b>time</b> <b>scales</b> with bounded graininess function μ, and therefore results obtained on this new type of <b>time</b> <b>scales</b> include all the known results on <b>time</b> <b>scales</b> with bounded graininess function μ. Hence, it is compelling to study problems on changing-periodic <b>time</b> <b>scales.</b> To illustrate the importance of our theory, first we introduce new concepts - ‘local-almost periodic functions’ and ‘local-almost automorphic functions’ on <b>time</b> <b>scales,</b> and then we use the properties of changing-periodic <b>time</b> <b>scales</b> to establish the local-almost periodicity and local-almost automorphy of solutions of dynamic equations.|$|R

To this end it supports the development of a ranking system for the importance of stone based on the <b>scale,</b> <b>time</b> and geographical extent of its historic use, the importance of the buildings it has been used in and its special technical features.

When approaching one of the spheres, a visitor to the park might be reminded of the lunar surface or when glancing at the quiet pools of water around the spheres, may relate them to craters. [...] This is no coincidence. Holt held a fascination with solar eclipses, {{as well as in}} the shadows cast by the sun on the surface of the earth and the name of the park is a reference to the astronomical appearance of the large spheres that are its most distinct features. In speaking about the name Holt said, [...] "It’s called Dark Star Park because in my imagination these spheres are like stars that have fallen to the ground-they no longer shine-so I think of the park/artwork in a somewhat celestial way." [...] By engaging the viewer with these spheres and the other elements surrounding them in the park, Holt brought the vast scale of nature and the cosmos back to human <b>scale.</b> <b>Time</b> is also a major part of this work. Once a year on August 1 at 9:32 am, the shadows cast by two of the spheres and their four adjacent poles align with permanent asphalt shadow patterns outlined on the ground.

The main problem of this technique is the time-scale considered and the observation methods used. Most of the time, observations of active ice-sheet processes are instantaneous at geological time-scale and hard to apply in the ancient. Furthermore, in the ancient, field and geophysical studies are carried out at lower resolution but on a wider <b>scale</b> (<b>time</b> and space). Finally, even if Subglacial lakes are observed below ice sheets, melt-water drainage system processes ongoing, especially like the tunnel valleys remain unobserved directly. The record of these huge subglacial [...] "rivers" [...] is mainly analysed via the recent ice ages imprints (Weichselian, Saalian and Pre-Illinoian or Elsterian stages) and in the ancient one (Late Ordovician and Permo-Carboniferous) The idea of GRASP is to use methods commonly applied in the ancient onto recent glaciation record (Pleistocene). In the ancient, wide datasets are acquired by oil companies during exploration of sedimentary basins. By using {{the same type of}} data for the Pleistocene glacial record, the project tries to generate data comparable in between ancient and recent glaciations. The studied area is the North Sea that was glaciated during the Last Glacial Maximum as well as the Northwestern Europe. On the sea floor, around the North Sea and into the kilometre of sediments below, many traces and evidences of the glacial events are recorded. As this place is a petroleum province, many data, especially geophysics ones are currently released or could be borrowed for academic purposes. [...] So, by joining the skills of three different universities, with the help of many data providers and the funding of six oil companies, new income is made into the knowledge of paleo-glacial systems. Basin analysis containing geophysical, reservoir and sedimentological models are produced in a new way and in a new type of environment. In an economic point of view, oil companies are interested in these models to have comparable data with their oil fields. In an academic one, understanding the recent ice sheet dynamic and is associated subglacial meltwater flow is crucial in the context of climate changes or fundamentally solving the intricate glacial record equation of recent and past ice ages.|$|E
