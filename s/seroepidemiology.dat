40|$|AbstractStrongyloidiasis is a {{life-threatening}} parasitic infection, especially in immunosuppressed patients, with death often occurring within several days. The disease has a worldwide distribution and is endemic in tropical and subtropical regions. Therefore, {{this study was}} conducted to investigate <b>seroepidemiology</b> of Strongyloides infection amongst immunocompromised patients in Southwest Iran. This cross-sectional study was conducted amongst a population of immunocompromised patients who were referred to health care or hospital referral centres in Ahvaz, Southwest Iran. Serum samples were tested by an enzyme immunoassay for anti-IgG Strongyloides antibody. Anti-Strongyloides stercoralis antibody was detected in 39 of 270 immunocommpromised cases, yielding a prevalence of 14. 4 %. No significant differences were indicated in terms of gender, age, or type of immunocompromised disorder with anti-Strongyloides stercoralis antibody levels. In conclusion, our results demonstrated high <b>seroepidemiology</b> of infection with this parasite in the region. Therefore, it appears immunocompromised patients should be tested for this infection using sensitive tests.

In babies up to 2 months this incidence was maintained in Caucasians but declined to 54 % in Chinese. High titre antibody was more frequently detected in Caucasians generally, including women of child-bearing age. The detection of rubella-specific IgM in the Caucasian babies was suggestive of recent maternal infection. However, fewer Caucasian (20 %) than Chinese (36 %) women of child-bearing age (15 - 40 years) appeared unprotected against rubella.

40|$|Hepatitis A is {{the most}} common cause of acute viral {{hepatitis}} worldwide although a preventive vaccine is available. Infection generally confers life-long immunity. It causes severe, often fatal, disease in adults, especially in those with underlying liver dysfunction, but is mostly asymptomatic in children. Endemicity is determined by anti-hepatitis A seroprevalence in different regions of the world. Hence, industrialized nations fall under hypoendemic category, but tropical, Asian, or African countries are hyperendemic. Hyperendemic countries have an adult population who develop immunity to hepatitis A as they are usually infected in childhood due to poor sanitation, in contrast to developed nations where adults remain susceptible. Vaccination strategies differ across the world depending on the endemicity. Usually, universal vaccination is still not advocated in endemic developing countries, unlike in USA or Europe. However, data are emerging from developing nations such as India where more adults are probably becoming susceptible to hepatitis A due to improving economy, better sanitation, and personal hygiene. Hence, the global <b>seroepidemiology</b> of hepatitis A is changing in many developing nations giving rise to unique nonimmune adolescent and adult populations emerging in endemic regions, thereby conferring a risk of developing severe hepatitis A.

40|$|Abstract: Background: Toxoplasma gondii is a {{protozoan}} parasite {{that can}} infect {{a wide range}} of hosts, including humans. Infection with T. gondii is potentially life threatening in immunocompromised individuals. Moreover, the infection can be detrimental during pregnancy, often leading to abortion of the fetus. The purpose of this work was to evaluate the <b>seroepidemiology</b> of T. gondii infection among Qom's pregnant women in 20 l 0. Materials and methods: In this descriptive, cross-sectional study, 200 serum samples were selected randomly and examined for toxoplasmosis by ELISA and IFA methods. The relationship between seropositivity for toxoplasmosis on the one hand, and some important factors on the other hand, were evaluated. Results: Total prevalence of Anti-Toxoplasma was 45. 3 %. According to the data reported by patients, toxoplasmosis had direct relationship with residential areas, consumption of semi-cooked meat, consumption of unwashed raw vegetables, and being in contact with cats. There is a statistically significant relationship between age and occurrence of the infection with regard to IgG seropositivity. However, such relationship could not be found for IgM. The highest infection rate was observed in the age range of 2 l to 25. Discussion: Education about the routes of the disease transmission and performing toxoplasma test before pregnancy can be effective reducing the prevalence rate.

40|$|Background.  Recently, 3 {{new members}} of the genus Bocavirus, human bocavirus 2 (HBoV 2), human bocavirus 3 (HBoV 3), and human bocavirus 4 (HBoV 4), were discovered. HBoV 2 – 4 occur mainly in the {{gastrointestinal}} tract but rarely in the respiratory tract, contrary to human bocavirus 1 (HBoV 1). Methods.  To investigate HBoV 1 – 4 <b>seroepidemiology</b> among 195 adults and 252 wheezing children, we conducted immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin M (IgM) enzyme immunoassays with recombinant viruslike particles (VLPs). The children’s sera were also tested for HBoV 1 – 4 DNA by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Results.  Both rabbit and human antibodies to HBoV 1 – 4 VP 2 VLPs {{were found to be}} cross-reactive. After depletion of HBoV 1 -reactive antibodies, the HBoV 2 – 4 approximate seroprevalences in adults were 34 %, 15 %, and 2 % and in children aged 1 – 2 years 25 %, 10 %, and 5 %, respectively. After depletion of HBoV 2 – 4 -reactive antibodies, the HBoV 1 seroprevalence among adults decreased from 96 % to 59 %. No cross-reactivity of human anti-HBoV IgG was observed with bovine parvovirus 1, parvovirus B 19 or PARV 4. No child was HBoV 2 – 4 viremic. Conclusions.  HBoV 2 – 4 infect humans less commonly and elicit weaker B-cell responses than HBoV 1. In our study HBoV 2 – 4 did not seem to have a major etiological role in wheezing. Cross-reactivity with HBoV 2 – 4 IgG partially accounts for the high HBoV 1 seroprevalences previously reported.

Of these, 884 samples were collected from Beijing and 507 were from Nanjing. Infection with HBoV 1 and 2 was prevalent in healthy Chinese people, with the seroprevalence of HBoV 1 and 2 in Beijing at 69. 2 (612 / 884) and 64. 4 % (569 / 884), respectively. Highest seroprevalence was observed in 3 - 5 -year-olds. The seroprevalence of HBoV 1 was significantly decreased between 10 - 13 -year-olds (80. 3 %) and 14 - 20 -year-olds (62. 3 %, p< 0. 05). For individuals over 20 years, seroprevalence was relatively constant at about 60 %. Similar trends were observed in children from Nanjing, with seroprevalence of HBoV 1 and 2 for healthy children at 80. 7 % (409 / 507) and 81. 3 % (412 / 507), respectively. Moreover, both mouse and human antibodies against HBoV 1 and HBoV 2 VLPs were found to be cross-reactive and 58. 4 % (813 / 1391) serum samples were seropositive for both HBoV 1 and HBoV 2. This finding suggests HBoV is highly prevalent in China and the antibodies produced as a result of infection with either HBoV 1 or HBoV 2 will offer future protection. The cross-reactivity between HBoVs is crucial for accurately determining HBoV <b>seroepidemiology...</b>|$|E
40|$|We {{used the}} {{recently}} developed {{enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay}} for antibody to varicella-zoster virus to study the prevalence and titers of virus-specific antibody in a south Indian population of 171 individuals 0 to 25 years old. The antibody prevalence rate was less than 15 % in individuals under 5 {{years of age and}} gradually rose to a maximum of 72 % in young adults 15 to 25 years of age. The median age of primary infection was 12. 25 years. The geometric mean antibody titers were between 1 : 80 and 1 : 160 in the age groups with antibody. These results are different from the pattern of <b>seroepidemiology</b> of varicella-zoster virus infection in temperate countries and indicate that varicella is predominantly a disease of young adults in the population studied...|$|E
40|$|Background and objectives: Helicobacter pylori is a Gram- {{negative}} bacteriacausing {{diseases such}} as peptic ulcer and gastric cancer. In this research,wedetermined the level of three types of antibody IgG, IgM and IgA in ordinarypeople of Izeh. Material and Methods: After collecting blood samples from 263 cases, theserum were obtaind and using the ELISA method the amount of IgG, IgM andIgA, against Helicobacter pylori measured. Results: Eleven samples(4. 3 %) out of 263 casese are positive for IgM anti-Helicobacter pylori. The frequency of IgA and IgG is 28 (10. 6 %) and 201 (76. 4 %),respectively. Conclusion: Based on results more than 70 % of people in Izeh have Anti-Helicobacter pylori antibody in their serum, which is higher than that the otherstudied in Iran and also than developed countries.
