5|$|In December 1984, Silcott {{was arrested}} {{for the murder of}} a 22-year-old boxer, Anthony Smith, at a party in Hackney. Smith had been slashed more than once on his face, there were two wounds to his abdomen, a lung had been lacerated and his aorta cut. Silcott was charged with the murder in May 1985 and was out on bail when Blakelock was killed in October that year. At first he told police he had not known Smith and had not been at the party, {{although}} at trial he acknowledged having been there. He <b>said</b> <b>Smith</b> had started punching him, and that he had pushed Smith back but had not been carrying a knife. Silcott was convicted of Smith's murder in February 1986, while awaiting trial for the Blakelock murder, and was sentenced to life imprisonment; he was released in 2003 after serving 17 years. After the conviction he told his lawyer he had indeed known Smith, that there had been bad blood between them, and that he had stabbed the man in self-defence, because one of Smith's friends had had a knife.|$|E
25|$|Smith was {{addicted}} to prescription medications. Psychiatrist Dr. Nathalie Maullin said she met Smith in April 2006 in Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. Maullin <b>said</b> <b>Smith</b> had borderline personality disorder.|$|E
500|$|In 1995, {{he had a}} 3.88 ERA and 31 saves and {{averaged}} 8.8 K/9. Hoffman pitched hurt from spring training through the season and finally had off-season rotator cuff surgery. [...] " [...] never bitched about his arm, which was killing him from Day One ... He was out there when most guys wouldn't have been", <b>said</b> <b>Smith.</b> This is also the year during which he developed his changeup.|$|E
500|$|Bennion {{praised the}} {{performances}} of Smith and Riley, but <b>said</b> that <b>Smith</b> was [...] "undoubtedly" [...] {{the star of the}} show. Vicki Power, writing for the Daily Telegraph, agreed that Smith was the star, calling her [...] "brilliant", while Patrick Mulkern, writing for Radio Times, <b>said</b> that <b>Smith</b> offered [...] "another multi-faceted, stunning performance as the troubled Christine". Chater <b>said</b> that <b>Smith's</b> role was [...] "superbly performed, as always", and Billen <b>said</b> that <b>Smith</b> offered [...] "tragic depth" [...] to her character. Wilson commended Smith's [...] "arresting performance", saying that [...] "No one does girl-next-door naturalism better – she has the actor's elixir of making you think you know her, just by a smile or an inflection." [...] Dessau commended the writers for allowing other actors to play the lead roles, praising {{the performances of}} Ridley and, especially, Smith.|$|R

5000|$|Commonwealth gold medal-winning long {{distance}} runner Ron Hill <b>said</b> <b>Smith's</b> death [...] "will be felt by many ... He was relatively young at 75 and tremendously fit and his {{death is a}} real shock to everyone. His loss is huge - but I suppose {{you can say that}} he passed away while doing what he loved doing, running across the moors." ...|$|R
500|$|Falcons {{defensive}} end Chuck Smith questioned the Vikings' toughness {{because of the}} ease with which they had won during the season. [...] "It's one thing to beat up on people," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Smith,</b> [...] "but how do you react when someone's finally hitting you back? We've been slugging it out all year." [...] Years later, Smith went on to criticize Gary Anderson in particular for his missed field goal and its contribution to the Vikings' loss.|$|E
500|$|... "To us, it's {{interesting}} {{if it has}} a darkness," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Smith</b> in 2015. [...] "Whatever that is. On {{the lyric}} side of things, if I was singing about dancefloors or happier or rosier things, it wouldn't ring true for me. I don't know why that is. People quite often say, 'oh, you write these sad lyrics but you're not a sad person' - and I'm not... I don't think you need to be sad to write a sad song, everybody has a dark side." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite her success, Smith is {{considered}} by some music critics {{to be one of}} the most underrated vocalists in country music history due to the decision not to pursue super stardom with the non-country general media market like such contemporaries as Loretta Lynn, Dolly Parton, and Tammy Wynette. Artists such as Parton, George Jones, and Chely Wright have cited Smith as either one of the best vocalists in the music industry or their favorite female artist. [...] Eddie Stubbs of Nashville radio station WSM and the Grand Ole Opry has dubbed Smith [...] "The Rolls-Royce of Country Singers." [...] With this being <b>said,</b> <b>Smith</b> has stated on numerous occasions that country legend Loretta Lynn is her favorite country singer ever.|$|E

500|$|Rather than find a {{replacement}} for Qureshi, the xx continued to tour as a smaller line-up of guitar, bass, and percussion. They also reduced their already minimalist arrangements for songs in concert, although Sim jokingly <b>said</b> <b>Smith</b> [...] "needs another few arms so he can work everything" [...] after Qureshi's departure. In their shows, Croft abandoned playing solos and chords in favor of less defined figures and motifs, while Smith performed beats and ambient sounds from his synth pad as an accompaniment to Croft and Sim's playing. Because their style had been suited to the small venues they first played, the xx focused more on the production value of their concerts and performing for larger audiences while on tour. They dressed in dark clothing and illuminated the stage with light boxes displaying their x-shaped, white-on-black logo.|$|E
500|$|What was not {{publicly}} known {{during the regular}} season and playoffs was that Smith had torn his rotator cuff after suffering an impingement in his right shoulder during the July 11–14 homestand against the Padres. After suffering the impingement diving back into first base on a pickoff throw, Smith altered his throwing motion {{to such a degree that}} the rotator cuff tear subsequently developed. The 5'10" [...] (1.78m), 180-pound (82kg) Smith opted to forgo surgery and instead built up his arm strength via weightlifting, playing through whatever pain he encountered. <b>Said</b> <b>Smith,</b> [...] "I didn't tell anybody about the injury, because I wanted to keep playing and didn't want anybody thinking they could run on me or take advantage of the injury. I tried to do almost everything, except throw a baseball, left-handed: opening a door, turning on the radio—everything. It didn't get any better, but it was good enough that I didn't have to have surgery." ...|$|E
500|$|In July 2009 it was {{announced}} that Smith was hoping to release her second album later in the year. In an interview, she expressed surprise and pleasure that the label wanted her to do another album so soon after the first. In September, further details about the album were released, including its name, Wonderland, and planned release date, 30 November. Smith claimed that Faryl [...] "was an introduction to me and an introduction for me to recording", while Cohen, producer of both Faryl and Wonderland, <b>said</b> <b>Smith</b> had [...] "matured as an artist since the first album and I have no doubt that once again, people will be astonished and moved by her performances". The album, which was recorded at Sarm Studios in Notting Hill, London, was completed in early October, and is loosely based on Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland. Wonderland was released on 30 November. To publicise the album, Smith appeared on numerous radio shows, as well as television appearances including Ready Steady Cook, Blue Peter, the BBC News Channel, The Alan Titchmarsh Show and Sky News Sunrise.|$|E
5000|$|Smith {{was called}} a [...] "goofball" [...] and was a {{self-described}} introvert. [...] "He is constantly making me laugh," [...] <b>said</b> Stage. [...] <b>Smith</b> <b>said</b> that {{would have liked to}} have six children if he and his wife became financially stable.|$|R

2500|$|On the July 15, 2013 {{episode of}} Up at Noon on IGN with Greg Miller, Mewes <b>said</b> <b>Smith</b> has [...] "finished and {{packaged}} together" [...] Clerks III. They {{are waiting to}} hear back from The Weinstein Company, and he hopes to start shooting soon.|$|E
2500|$|According to Fawn Brodie, Smith's idea of Kolob {{may have}} been derived from the [...] "throne of God" [...] idea found in Thomas Dick's The Philosophy of a Future State, which Brodie <b>said</b> <b>Smith</b> [...] "had {{recently}} been reading" [...] before dictating the Book of Abraham, and which [...] "made a lasting impression" [...] on him.|$|E
2500|$|He {{was next}} {{entered in the}} Haskell Invitational Handicap at Monmouth Park on July 31, in which he conceded at least eight pounds to each of his rivals. He once again led from the start, then turned back a brief {{challenge}} by Meadow Star down the stretch to win by [...] lengths. [...] "I just tightened him {{up a little bit}} in the stretch and let him cruise on home," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Smith.</b> [...] "I felt no pressure at all." ...|$|E

2500|$|After the murders, {{there was}} {{speculation}} {{about who was}} responsible. Governor Ford was accused of knowing about the plot to kill Smith. Ford denied this, but he later wrote that {{it was good for}} the Mormons to have been driven out of the state and said that their beliefs and actions were too different to have survived in Illinois. He <b>said</b> <b>Smith</b> was [...] "the most successful impostor in modern times," [...] and that some people [...] "expect more protection from the laws than the laws are able to furnish in the face of popular excitement." ...|$|E
2500|$|From the beginning, {{black people}} have been members of Mormon congregations, and Mormon congregations have always been interracial. When the Mormons {{migrated}} to Missouri, they encountered the pro-slavery sentiments of their neighbors. Joseph Smith upheld the laws regarding slaves and slaveholders, and affirmed the curse of Ham as placing his descendants into slavery, [...] "to the shame and confusion of all who have cried out against the South." [...] With that being <b>said,</b> <b>Smith</b> still remained abolitionist in his actions and doctrines. After the Mormons were expelled from Missouri, Smith took an increasingly strong anti-slavery position, and a few black men were ordained to the LDS priesthood.|$|E
2500|$|Author {{and presidential}} speechwriter Curt Smith however, said that Major League Baseball's deal with CBS Sports was [...] "sportscasting's Exxon Valdez." [...] Had {{baseball}} valued national promotion {{provided by the}} Game of the Week, <b>said</b> <b>Smith,</b> it never would have crafted a fast-bucks plan that has cut off the widest viewership. [...] "It's an obscene imbalance", Smith also said, [...] "to have 175 games going to 60 {{percent of the country}} [...] and 16 games going to the rest." [...] He added: [...] "Baseball has paid a grievous price for being out of sight and out of mind. It's attacked the lower and middle classes that forms baseball's heart[...] [...] [...] In the end, the advertising community has come to view baseball as a leper." ...|$|E

2500|$|Croll {{chose to}} skip the Preakness Stakes on May 21 and instead entered Holy Bull in the prestigious Metropolitan Handicap, popularly known as the Met Mile, against older horses on May 30. The field {{included}} the 1993 Belmont Stakes winner Colonial Affair, multiple stakes winner Devil His Due and the fast improving Cherokee Run, who {{would go on to}} be named the champion sprinter of 1994. In one of his best performances, Holy Bull quickly took the lead and drew off to win by [...] lengths, earning a Beyer Speed Figure of 122. [...] "I still can't explain the Derby," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Smith.</b> [...] "But today he came out and showed what he is, like he always does [...] – except for the first Saturday in May. He broke well and, every time I asked him to pick it up, he picked it up." ...|$|E
2500|$|Following the Wall Street Journal report, Matt Tait, a British blogger who {{had done}} {{extensive}} writing about the DNC hacked materials, <b>said</b> <b>Smith</b> had contacted him - [...] "curiously, {{around the same time}} Trump called for the Russians to get Hillary Clinton's missing emails" [...] - to ask him to help authenticate any materials that might be forthcoming. According to Tait, Smith planned to set up an opposition research company and cited the Trump campaign as one of the four groups involved in the project. A document describing his plans claimed that Flynn, Kellyanne Conway, Steve Bannon, and other campaign advisors were coordinating with him [...] "to the extent permitted as an independent expenditure". Both the White House and a campaign official denied that Smith was working for them. Bannon and Conway strongly denied having any connection with Smith's effort. Flynn did not comment.|$|E
6000|$|... "As you justly remark," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Smith,</b> [...] "there are others. I am glad we have secured Comrade Brady's services. We {{may need}} them." ...|$|E

5000|$|In 1823, <b>Smith</b> <b>said</b> that {{an angel}} {{told him of}} the {{existence}} of golden plates along with [...] "two stones in silver bows" [...] fastened to a breastplate that the angel said God had prepared for translating the plates. In dictating the Book of Mormon, <b>Smith</b> <b>said</b> he used these [...] "interpreters," [...] which he later referred to as [...] "Urim and Thummim." [...] <b>Smith's</b> wife, Emma, <b>said</b> that <b>Smith</b> used the Urim and Thummim to translate the lost 116 pages of the manuscript but that Smith translated the published Book of Mormon using the single chocolate-colored stone that he had previously used in treasure-quests.|$|R
