40|$|Farmland {{birds have}} {{suffered}} a severe decline in recent years throughout Europe including Ireland. Agricultural intensification {{is believed to be}} the main cause and this has led to the introduction of agri-environmental schemes, of which <b>set-aside</b> is a part. Bird abundance and diversity were compared between <b>set-aside</b> and adjacent tillage or grassland at 18 locations. The <b>set-aside</b> sites were also assigned to one of four management types: rotational <b>set-aside,</b> non-rotational <b>set-aside,</b> first year <b>set-aside</b> that was productive grassland in the previous year, and long-term <b>set-aside</b> that was grazed by animals in winter. Species diversity and the abundances of skylark, meadow pipit and woodpigeon were significantly greater in <b>set-aside</b> sites. Species diversity was not significantly different between <b>set-aside</b> management types and meadow pipit, skylark, pheasant, house sparrow, magpie, snipe and starling were closely associated with non-rotational <b>set-aside,</b> which also contained significantly larger numbers of these species compared to the other <b>set-aside</b> types. This study shows that <b>set-aside</b> does enhance bird diversity and abundance and that, in Ireland, the most effective form of <b>set-aside</b> is non-rotational.

Mandatory <b>set-aside</b> of land, required farmers to leave arable land out of production {{to be eligible for}} subsidies. The policy effect of a reform in 2008, where the mandatory <b>set-aside</b> policy was abolished due to inefficiencies, is studied by applying a quasi-experimental method to estimate the casual relationship between mandatory <b>set-aside</b> abolishment and farm environmental performance. This evaluation is relevant as the mandatory <b>set-aside</b> was re-introduced in 2013 and this study contributes with insights into policy implications of mandatory <b>set-aside,</b> as it has never been evaluated before. The difference-in-difference results show signs of improved environmental performance of farmers due to the policy change, in opposite towards the hypothesis. Thus, it does not support the expectation that more land would be used for fertiliser and pesticide due to the mandatory <b>set-aside</b> elimination.

40|$|The article {{describes}} the evolution and future of the <b>set-aside</b> system of the European Union. The focus is on Finland s integration to the system. The future developments are evaluated from Finland s point of view. To {{be eligible for the}} compensatory payments introduced as part of the CAP reform for arable crops, producers must set aside a portion of their arable land with a view to achieving a better balance between production and domestic and international demand. The <b>set-aside</b> rate was fixed at 15 % for the rotational <b>set-aside</b> and 20 % (18 % in the UK and Denmark) for other forms of <b>set-aside.</b> The <b>set-aside</b> requirements do not appeal small producers producing less than 92 tons cereals a year. Because of bad harvests in certain areas of the world combined with effective production control measures, for the marketing year 1995 / 96, the <b>set-aside</b> rate was cut to 12 % (15 % and 17 %). During the year 1995, the intervention stocks of cereals continuously decreased and world market prices increased. Consequently, the EU decided to cut the <b>set-aside</b> rate to 10 % for the 1996 / 97 marketing year. As usual, the reduction only applies for the 1996 / 97 marketing year. For the year 1997 / 98, the portion will automatically revert to 15 % (and 18 % and 20 %). The cut of <b>set-aside</b> rate serve the interest of major cereals- producing countries. Finland is obliged to pay her share of the costs without getting any advantage. Finland s interest would probably be to increase the <b>set-aside</b> rate. This is because, within a certain range, (a) the change of the obligatory <b>set-aside</b> rate barely affects the <b>set-aside</b> area in Finland; (b) the change of the obligatory <b>set-aside</b> rate barely affects the cereals production in Finland; and (c) the change of the cereals-production area barely affects the farm income in Finland. The discussion concerning the future development of the EU <b>set-aside</b> system should include the following themes: (a) is the current cereals shortage a temporal or continuous phenomenon; (b) as a high <b>set-aside</b> rate helps to keep cereal prices up, farmers would gain in the form of high producer prices and the tax payers would gain in the form of low export subsidies (or high export taxes); (c) because the increase of <b>set-aside</b> rate is more difficult than the cut, the cuts should be postpo ned if possible; (b) an alternative way to increase production is to rise the farm-by-farm ceiling of 92 tons (that makes the <b>set-aside</b> obligatory), rather than to cut the <b>set-aside</b> rate; and (e) for environmental reasons, the <b>set-aside</b> area shou ld be covered with plants. vokMTT Taloustutkimus (MTTL) The temporal cut of the EU <b>set-aside</b> requirements for the 1996 / 97 marketing year: consequences for Finlan...|$|R

Aims. To identify <b>set-aside</b> features {{important to the}} ecology of four ground nesting species, namely Little Bustard Tetrax tetrax, Stone-curlew Burhinus oedicnemus, Greater Short-toed Lark Calandrella brachydactyla and Calandra Lark Melanocorypha calandra. Methods. <b>Set-aside</b> fields were surveyed in four regions of Catalonia (northeast of Spain) for the selected species during the 2004 and 2005 breeding seasons. <b>Set-aside</b> habitat descriptors (e. g. size, vegetation structure) were collected.

The region where the <b>set-aside</b> was located had a strong effect on the abundance of the selected species. In addition, vegetation coverage, field shape of <b>set-aside</b> and surrounding natural habitats were critical features, but with contrasting effects on the different species. Conclusion. Populations of the selected species of conservation concern could be improved by effective management of <b>set-aside.</b> As selected species responded differently, we recommend that management at local level should take into account the conservation value at a regional level of the protected area for each of the selected species...|$|R

40|$|Amongst {{recent changes}} to the Common Agricultural Policy have been the {{introduction}} of <b>set-aside</b> schemes, tentatively in 1988 and more forcibly in 1992. Such schemes remove land from agricultural production for a fixed period of time whilst ensuring the land is maintained to a standard suitable for any future return to cropping. The main purpose of <b>set-aside</b> in the EC {{is to reduce the}} over-production of certain food crops including cereals. The subsidiary aim of using <b>set-aside</b> to improve the environmental quality of farmland has gained in importance since the early 1990 s as environmental issues have become increasingly highlighted. The primary aim of this research was to determine whether <b>set-aside</b> was promoting environmental improvements within the farmland. This was related to the possible advantages <b>set-aside</b> could give the wider countryside, {{in the light of the}} limited extent and impact of targeted environmental schemes. The study focused upon a sample of farm holdings in Northern Hampshire. Questionnaires and interviews were used to study farmers' opinions and the management of <b>set-aside.</b> Few farmers felt that <b>set-aside</b> had improved the environment. This was particularly true of those with rotational <b>set-aside.</b> However, some benefits were described, mainly relating to increases in bird species. The majority of these were unplanned and developed purely by chance. Other aspects, such as <b>set-aside</b> clearing crop-land of weeds, were generally a consequence of the growers adapting the scheme to meet their own farming requirements. Many farmers expressed an interest in conservation issues and were keen to see the incorporation of more environmental benefits, such as conservation headlands, within the <b>set-aside</b> regulations. Despite their interest, few had entered agri-environmental schemes or utilised conservation grants. This was largely because the compensation rates were not sufficiently attractive or the schemes were unsuitable for the farm. The farmers in this study appeared relatively knowledgeable about conservation, but were less clear as to how to adopt this within their overall farm management plans. <b>Set-aside</b> has the potential to contribute towards the improvement of the countryside's wildlife resource, but much more needs to be done to promote this. Furthermore, it is important that the attitudes of the farmers, and those framing policy, are altered so any positive environmental benefits, made as a consequence of <b>set-aside</b> or agri-environmental schemes, will be sustained once these schemes come to a close...|$|R
40|$|Nominal {{grain and}} oilseed prices have {{declined}} dramatically {{from the high}} levels observed in the mid- 1990 s. As a result, {{it has been suggested}} by some industry stakeholders that measures should be taken to limit world crop supplies to raise prices. One such measure is a <b>set-aside</b> program involving a number of participants that would significantly reduce the quantity of land in production over a certain period of time. In fact, the European Union and the United States currently have <b>set-aside</b> programs that, together, already have had a positive effect on crop prices. <b>Set-aside</b> programs could also become relevant if the use of the World Trade Organization blue box is extended to more countries after the next round of negotiations. This analysis focuses on the quantitative aspects of a substantial multi-country, multi-commodity, <b>set-aside</b> program and its impact on major agricultural commodity prices. Three main conclusions can be drawn from the analysis: · A permanent <b>set-aside</b> program would be necessary to keep prices from returning to relatively low levels · Even with a permanent <b>set-aside</b> program, the results show a declining effect over time mostly because of additional production by non-participating countries and because of crop substitution in favour of cereals and oilseeds and higher yield in participating countries. · For a <b>set-aside</b> program to have any significant impact on prices, the program must include many commodities in many countries. A program involving Canada alone is doomed to fail. And given that the United States and the European Union-two large producers-already have their respective <b>set-aside</b> programs, it might be difficult to convince them to participate in an international effort.
