40|$|A primary {{tool that}} {{consumers}} have for comparative shopping is the <b>shopbot,</b> which {{is short for}} shopping robot. These shopbots automatically search {{a large number of}} vendors for price and availability. Typically a <b>shopbot</b> searches a predefined set of vendors and reports all results, which can result in time-consuming searches that provide redundant or dominated alternatives. Our research demonstrates analytically how <b>shopbot</b> designs can be improved by developing a utility model of consumer purchasing behavior. This utility model considers the intrinsic value of the product and its attributes, the disutility from waiting, and the cognitive costs associated with evaluating the offers retrieved. We focus on the operational decisions made by the shopbot: which stores to search, how long to wait, and which offers to present to the user. To illustrate our model we calibrate the model to price and response time data collected at online bookstores over a six-month period. Using prior expectations about price and response time, we show how shopbots can substantially increase consumer utility by searching more intelligently and then selectively presenting offers. intelligent agents, utility theory, information retrieval, stochastic modeling...|$|E

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{proliferation of}} online shopping and purchasing has naturally {{led to a}} growth in the popularity of comparison-shopping search engines, popularly known as “shopbots”. We extend the one-product-at-a-time search approach used in current <b>shopbot</b> implementations to consider purchasing plans for a bundle of items. Our approach leverages bundle-based pricing and promotional deals frequently offered by online merchants to extract substantial savings. Interestingly, our approach can also identify “freebies ” that consumers can obtain at no extra cost.

40|$|Shopbots are {{software}} {{agents that}} automatically query {{a large number}} of vendors for price and availability of products. They are the primary tools for comparison-shopping on the Internet. Despite their apparent usefulness, shopbots impose considerable costs on their users because of {{the manner in which they}} make their operational decisions. Specifically, search tends to be slow resulting in high wait times for users. In addition, user cognitive costs are high because shopbots present all possible results, several of which are irrelevant or are dominated. This paper models the <b>shopbot</b> decision problem of how long to wait for store responses and what offers to display as an optimization problem. The problem is a large stochastic integer programming problem. Thus, a key challenge is to address the uncertainty and discrete choices in real-time decision making. Given the complexity of the problem, we focus on the design of real-time algorithms that combine simulations and optimization techniques to compute near-optimal results. The algorithms are tested using data collected from 30 stores for a set of 60 books from the New York Times bestsellers list. Our research demonstrates how a <b>shopbot</b> can leverage information about price and response time distributions to develop intelligent algorithms and optimize its performance. We find that the dollar value of the gains to a <b>shopbot</b> user from such an algorithm can be close to 10 % of the price paid by the user...|$|E

For auctioneers selling a single item, pooling – i. e., the use of <b>ShopBots</b> – is beneficial to both auctioneers as long as neither one dominates the market (e. g., possesses more than 60 - 65 % of the market share). For multi-item auctions, pooling is mutually beneficial only if both auctioneers have nearly identical ratios of bidders per items for sale; otherwise, only the auctioneer with the smaller ratio benefits from pooling.

This paper also estimates price elasticities and find that they are relatively high compared to offline markets, with a decrease in demand of 7 to 10 percent for each percentage increase in price, in the base model. Interestingly, in this setting, consumers who search more intensively are less price sensitive than other consumers, reflecting their increased weight on retailer differentiation in delivery time and reliability.

Furthermore, the method in which the data is displayed to consumers lends itself to a utility-based evaluation process, consistent with econometric analysis techniques. While price is an important determinant of customer choice, we find that, even among <b>shopbot</b> consumers, branded retailers and retailers a consumer visited previously hold significant price advantages in head-to-head price comparisons. Further, customers are very sensitive to how the total price is allocated among the item price, the shipping cost, and tax, and are also quite sensitive to the ordinal ranking of retailer offerings with respect to price. We also find that consumers use brand as a proxy for a retailer’s credibility with regard to non-contractible aspects of the product bundle such as shipping time.
