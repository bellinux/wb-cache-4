Furthermore, the effect of applying lubrication at the instrument-trocar <b>seal</b> <b>interface</b> on friction was studied. A friction testing apparatus was designed and built to characterise the resistance force at the instrument-trocar interface {{as a function of}} the instrument's linear movement in the 12 -mm trocar (at constant velocity) for different design, seal material, and angle of tilt. The resistance force depended on the trocar seal design and material properties, specifically surface roughness, elasticity, hardness, the direction of movement, and the instrument linear velocity, and varied between 0. 25 and 8 N. Lubricating the shaft with silicone oil reduced the peak resistance force by 75 % for all trocars and eliminated the stick-slip phenomenon evident in non-lubricated cases. The magnitude of fluctuation in resistance force depends on the trocar design and is attributed to stick-slip of the sealing mechanism and is generally higher during retraction in comparison to insertion. Trocars that have an inlet seal made of rubber/polyurethane showed higher resistance forces during retraction. Use of a lubricant significantly reduced frictional effects. Comparisons of the investigated trocars indicate that a low friction port, providing the surgeon with improved haptic feedback, can be designed by improving the tribological properties of the trocar <b>seal</b> <b>interface...</b>|$|E

40|$|This study {{experimentally}} investigates an actively controlled {{mechanical seal}} for aerospace applications. The seal {{of interest is}} a gas seal, which is considerably more compact than previous actively controlled mechanical seals that were developed for industrial use. In a mechanical seal, the radial convergence of the <b>seal</b> <b>interface</b> has a primary effect on the film thickness. Active control of the film thickness is established by controlling the radial convergence of the <b>seal</b> <b>interface</b> with a piezoelectric actuator. An actively controlled mechanical seal was initially designed and evaluated using a mathematical model. Based on these results, a seal was fabricated and tested under laboratory conditions. The seal was tested with both helium and air, at rotational speeds up to 3770 rad/sec, and at sealed pressures as high as 1. 48 x 10 (exp 6) Pa. The seal was operated with both manual control and with a closed-loop control system that used either the leakage rate or face temperature as the feedback. The output of the controller was the voltage applied to the piezoelectric actuator. The seal operated successfully for both short term tests (less than one hour) and for longer term tests (four hours) with a closed-loop control system. The leakage rates were typically 5 - 15 slm (standard liters per minute), and the face temperatures were generally maintained below 100 C. When leakage rate {{was used as the}} feedback signal, the setpoint leakage rate was typically maintained within 1 slm. However, larger deviations occurred during sudden changes in sealed pressure. When face temperature was used as the feedback signal, the setpoint face temperature was generally maintained within 3 C, with larger deviations occurring when the sealed pressure changes suddenly. the experimental results were compared to the predictions from the mathematical model. The model was successful in predicting the trends in leakage rate that occurred as the balance ratio and sealed pressure changed, although the leakage rates were not quantitatively predicted {{with a high degree of}} accuracy. This model could be useful in providing valuable design information for future actively controlled mechanical seals...|$|E

The flow and thermal characteristics were determined; it was found that for high pressure drops, large fluctuations in flows in the downstream blade-stator gap can occur. These leakages and pulsations in themselves are not all that significant, yet if coupled with cavity parameters, they could set up resonance events.

In this paper, interface reactions between a sealing glass and a ferritic metal interconnect (SS 410) are tested under three different heat treatment conditions: sealing (static), aging (static), and thermal cycling (dynamic). The {{results show that the}} BaCrO 4 crystals with two different morphology (round-shaped and needle-shaped) form both at the three-phase boundary (where air, glass, and SS 410 meet) and {{on the surface of the}} sealing glass under the three conditions. Round-shaped BaCrO 4 crystals form with low O- 2 concentration and short reaction time. Needle-shaped BaCrO 4 crystals form with high O- 2 concentration and long reaction time. For the thermal cycling condition, the BaCrO 4 formed at early stages causes the delamination of the <b>sealing</b> <b>interface.</b> Then, O- 2 diffuses into the interior interface along the delamination path, which results in the formation of BaCrO 4 at the interior interface.

In this design a heat sink, consisting of thousands of micron size cooling pins, is constructed on the end face of the stationary seal ring just below the sealing interface. Since the entire heat sink is constructed within millimeters of the interface, there is an extremely small thermal resistance between the interface and the coolant. Two prototype experiments are carried out; one for dry running conditions at pressure velocity values of 14. 0 MPa m/s (400, 000 psi*ft/min) and the other with the seal installed in a small ANSI water pump operating under dead head conditions.

40|$|Leaf seals are {{filament}} seals for use at static to rotating interfaces in {{the engine}} secondary air system. They offer reduced leakage rates and better off-design performance over conventional labyrinth seals. If compared with advanced brush seals, leaf seals are more compliant due to their lower stiffness and can withstand higher axial pressure differences. Although leaf seals can exhibit hydrodynamic air-riding, {{this is not always}} the case and seal–rotor contact can occur. As a result, friction between the leaf tips and the rotor causes heat generation and wear. To predict the diameter of the rotating shaft and the seal life, the shaft and <b>seal</b> <b>interface</b> temperature needs to be estimated. In the steady state, this is determined by the ratio of convective heat transfer through the seal to that through the shaft. To that end, the convective heat transfer characteristics of the flow over the shaft around the seal are required to build accurate thermal models. In this paper, the convective heat transfer coefficient (HTC) distribution in the close vicinity of a typical leaf seal is investigated in a new test facility. The experimental setup and test method are described in detail, and accuracy considerations are included. The methodology employed to derive HTC is explained with reference to an analogous computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model. The importance of the choice of an appropriate driving gas temperature is demonstrated.

As a key component in fluid transportation, storage, and containment, the reliability and performance of mechanical seals is very important. This paper deals with the design, development, and optimization of unique macro/micro- features, used to improve the mechanical seal performance. This Thesis begins with an introductory background of mechanical seal component design, followed by an introduction of external forces and boundary conditions {{used to describe the}} seal as an axis-symmetric model. A derivation of the governing equation (Reynolds equation) used to describe fluid pressure between two surfaces is then summarized. Followed with a simplification of the Reynolds equation used to describe hydrodynamic lift under the influence of periodic features. The theory behind laser machining, and the method of creating unique features using a laser is then described. The iterative logic structure of code that I developed is then described; A software tool which uses user defined operation (conducted on imported line segments defining the mask and beam shape boundaries) to define and simulate the laser process, which in turn generates the three dimensional geometry. One of the output files from this software (describing the ablated <b>seal</b> <b>interface</b> geometry) is then imported into a proprietary finite element analysis/ fluid mechanics package. The results of the analysis are used for an optimization study to predict the performance of one such unique macro/micro-feature called a tapered channel (patent pending). Following the FEA analysis, actual testing was performed at the Flowserve facility in Temecula, CA. From the test results, it is concluded that laser ablated macro/micro-feature on the sealing interface of a mechanical seal face can be optimized to improve the sealing performance.

If leakage were to occur during or after implantation, potential events such as blood loss, clotting, blood damage, and/or infections could produce adverse effects for the patient. Because of these possibly adverse circumstances, materials and shafts are being evaluated to determine the most appropriate course to limit these effects. Teflon and Nylon were analyzed as potential shaft seal candidates with both a stainless steel shaft and a Melonite 9 coated shaft, the latter provided by Houston Unlimited Inc. Metal Processing in Chappell Hill, Texas. The materials and shafts were evaluated under four time durations (I 5, 3 0, 4 5, and 60 minutes), four rotation rates (800, 1000, 1200, and 1400 RPM), and two outer diameters (0. 5 " and 0. 75 "). The three main parameters evaluated were the inner diameter, the inner temperature, and the outer temperature. Statistical comparisons were computed for the shaft seal materials, the shafts, and the outer diameters along with the inner and outer temperatures. The results indicated that time and RPM had no significant effect on wear. Some unexpected information was produced. Most notable was that the coated shaft did not significantly reduce the amount of wear.

40|$|Faults and {{fracture}} networks {{at depth}} are important fluid pathways, especially in fine-grained, low permeability seal lithologies. Discontinues in sealing lithologies can create seal bypass systems, {{leading to the}} failure of CO 2 geosequestration sites or hydrocarbon traps. We characterize the occurrence of and changes in discontinuity patterns and the associated changes in elastic moduli across sedimentologic interfaces to document the importance of these discontinuities for fluid management in the subsurface and potential for re-activation in high-pressure injection scenarios. We evaluate well-exposed, fine-grained, low-permeability Mesozoic and Paleozoic units that are seals of potential CO 2 repositories on the Colorado Plateau and show evidence for open fractures and fluid flow in the subsurface. Field observations document changes in fracture distributions across lithologic boundaries allowing us to identify mechano-stratigraphic units and focus on the effect of lithologic interfaces on fracture distribution. An interface marks the boundary between facies in a seal and in this study the fractures are shown to deflect or arrest at the interface. In outcrop fracture intensity varies in from 1 to 18 fractures per meter and fracture apertures range from mm to cm. The mineralized fractures often have associated alteration halos along their boundaries; their general orientation follows that of discontinuities within the underlying reservoir facies or adjacent faults. The recognition of these changes in fracture distribution is important for forward modeling of fluid flow and risk management. Studying the occurrence of and changes in fracture patterns from outcrops and scaling it up for use in modeling at a field scale is difficult {{due to the lack of}} direct correlation between outcrop observations and subsurface data. Due to the size and amount of data needed to model fluid flow at the field scale the meso-scale (cm to m) variability of rock properties is often neglected. We evaluate this meso-scale variability in elastic moduli, where possible. We combine mechano-stratigraphic outcrop observations with elastic moduli calculated from publically available wire line log data to evaluate the variability in rock strength within the heterolithic top seal. Relationships between changes in Young’s modulus to resulting fracture distribution can then be observed. The outcome of this analysis can be used for modeling the effectiveness of seal for storage of CO 2 in the underlying reservoirs. Digitized publically available wire line well log data were used to calculate Poisson’s ratio and Young’s modulus over the Carmel Formation and upper most 3 m of the underlying Navajo Sandstone. Our calculations show that Young’s Modulus can range between 15 to 34 GPa across 60 cm of the intra-seal interfaces, and an average difference of 5 GPa across the reservoir <b>seal</b> <b>interface.</b> These variations will affect fracture distributions and fluid behavior in the subsurface. These data provide a means to closely tie outcrop observations to derived estimates of subsurface rock strength. The characterization of rock strength variability is especially important for modeling the response of seals to increased pressure, due to CO 2 injection, and will allow for better site screening and fluid management once injection projects are underway...|$|E

40|$|The {{optimization}} of the geometrical {{parameters of}} the aerodynamic lift features and {{the analysis of the}} fluid flow in the <b>seal</b> <b>interface</b> are inter-twined. Any small changes in the geometrical {{parameters of the}} aerodynamic lift features significantly affect the performance of a non-contacting gas face seal. For a gas face seal to function with optimum performance requires that the optimum geometrical parameters be identified. This can be achieved through a lengthy trial and error process, often heavily dependent on the designer’s depth of insight, itself dependent on experience, or can be achieved through automated numerical methods. The purpose of this research was to develop a reliable numerical model that can serve as a design tool for simulating the performance of both unidirectional and bidirectional dry gas face seals. This was achieved in three steps. The first approach consisted in developing a 2 D numerical model that employed the Reynolds equation for seals operating at very low rotating speeds and low pressure differentials. In the second step a 3 D-CFD model was assembled and the practicability of using CFD, in a seal design loop, for seals operating in wide range of operating conditions, was investigated. This model employed a commercial CFD package (ANSYS CFX version 11). For last approach both models were incorporated into an automatic optimization tool that can generate optimal seal geometries with a minimum of human intervention. An extensive set of results from the analysis of dry gas face seals spanning across different operating conditions and geometrical seal face profiles, with the inclusion of convergent radial taper, are presented and discussed in this thesis. The results obtained from the Reynolds equation and 3 D CFD models are compared and critically analysed. Results obtained with both models are validated against test data obtained from AESSEAL plc, the sponsor of this research. The 3 D CFD model predictions showed a better agreement with the test data on the seal leakage than the Reynolds equation model. The leakage rates and fluid film thickness predictions illustrate how the 3 D CFD model can be used for seal design while overcoming some of the shortcomings of the Reynolds equation based models. The major limitation of the 3 D CFD model is that it is computationally expensive. An automatic optimization tool which can be used for the design of dry gas face seals has been presented. The improvements achieved from the optimization of a spiral groove face seal utilising the automatic optimization tool are: 4. 8 % increase of opening force, 13. 2 % reduction of seal leakage, 20. 7 % increase of design efficiency parameter, 28. 3 % increase of axial film stiffness and 15. 9 % reduction of power consumption.

40|$|Controlling {{interface}} clearances is {{the most}} cost effective method of enhancing turbomachinery performance. Seals control turbomachinery leakages, coolant flows and contribute to overall system rotordynamic stability. In many instances, <b>sealing</b> <b>interfaces</b> and coatings are sacrificial, like lubricants, giving up their integrity {{for the benefit of}} the component. They are subjected to abrasion, erosion, oxidation, incursive rubs, foreign object damage (FOD) and deposits as well as extremes in thermal, mechanical, aerodynamic and impact loadings. Tribological pairing of materials control how well and how long these interfaces will be effective in controlling flow. A variety of seal types and materials are required to satisfy turbomachinery sealing demands. These seals must be properly designed to maintain the interface clearances. In some cases, this will mean machining adjacent surfaces, yet in many other applications, coatings are employed for optimum performance. Many seals are coating composites fabricated on superstructures or substrates that are coated with sacrificial materials which can be refurbished either in situ or by removal, stripping, recoating and replacing until substrate life is exceeded.

These particles are so small (< 0. 1 microns) that they accumulate in the surface valleys of the seal without damaging it. The second stage occurs as the shearing motion of the seal pushes the increas-ing number of entering particles against each other and short-range forces bind the particles into clusters. As more particles enter the seal, the clusters grow in size. Eventually, the clusters become so large that they no longer fit in the surface valleys of the seal...|$|R
40|$|Since {{the usage}} of {{pressurized}} systems, {{there has been a}} challenge to prevent and control leakage of different fluids. When a metal-to-metal face seal is designed, different aspects are to be considered. Its ring shaped sealing surface is designed to prevent leakage and also to maintain pressure. In this thesis, the main objective is to study how out-of-flatness affects the leakage. This property of <b>sealing</b> <b>interface</b> can be described by different wave parameters and in this case, by means of modelling and numerical simulations. The best approach is {{the usage of}} Heterogeneous Multiscale Method (HMM). The data obtained by means of the two-scale stochastic model showed that the pressure amplitude is the most important parameter of the out-of-flatness. In same level of importance, comes the mean pressure even though it is not considered an out-of-flatness parameter. From the data obtained, a simple mathematical expression for leak rate was constructed that shows the effect of out-of-flatness...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, the {{development}} history {{for the first}} cryogenic pressurized fuel tank coverplates is presented along with a synopsis of {{the development}} strategy and technologies which led to success on this program. Coverplates are the large access panels used to access launch vehicle fuel tanks. These structures incorporate all of the requirements for a pressure vessel {{as well as the}} added requirement to mount all of the miscellaneous access points required for a fuel management system. The first composite coverplates to meet the requirements for flight qualification were developed on the X- 33 program. The X- 33 composite coverplates went from an open requirement to successful finished flight hardware with multiple unique configurations, complete with verification testing, in less than eighteen months. Besides the rapid development schedule, these components introduced several new technologies previously unseen in cryogenic composites including solutions to cryogenic shrinkage, self-supporting sealing surfaces, and highly loaded composite bosses with precision <b>sealing</b> <b>interfaces.</b> These components were proven to seal liquid hydrogen at cryogenic temperatures under maximum loading and pressure conditions...|$|R

Because of its properties, polyvinyl acid binders offer improved anode stability, tunable properties, and many other attractive attributes for silicon-based anodes, which enable the anode to withstand silicon cycles of expansion and contraction during charging and discharging...|$|R
40|$|As fluidic {{microelectromechanical}} {{devices are}} developing and often attached to, or embedded in, large, complex and expensive systems, {{the issues of}} modularity, maintenance and subsystem replacement arise. In this work, a robust silicon connector suitable for high-pressure applications – likely with harsh fluids – in the temperature range of + 100 to – 100 °C is demonstrated and tested together with a stainless steel nipple representing a simple and typical macropart. With a micromachined circular membrane equipped with a 5 μm high ridge, this connector is able to maintain a leak rate below 2. 0 ´ 10 - 8 scc/s of gaseous helium with a pressure of up to 9. 7 bar. Degradation of the sealing performance on reassembly {{is associated with the}} indentation of the ridge. However, the ridge makes the <b>sealing</b> <b>interface</b> less sensitive to particles in comparison with a flat reference. Most evaluation is made through so called heat-until-leak tests conducted to determine the maximum working temperature and the sealing mechanism of the connector. A couple of these are followed by cryogenic testing. The effect of thermal mismatch of the components is discussed and utilized as an early warning mechanism...|$|R
