5000|$|Vincent Canby of The New York Times {{described}} The Mechanic as a [...] "solemn, rather <b>spurious</b> <b>action</b> melodrama". Noting the [...] "father son rivalry" [...] between Arthur and Steve {{and picking}} up on the [...] "latent homosexual bond" [...] between the two, Canby concluded that the film was [...] "non-stop, mostly irrelevant physical spectacle" [...] and pondered what a different director might have done with the same material. Roger Ebert praised Bronson's performance, noting that {{he appears to be}} truly listening to Vincent rather than simply waiting for him to stop for Bronson's next line. While finding the plot twists [...] "neat", Ebert found that director Winner failed to squarely address the relationship between the leads in favor of too many boring action sequences. Judith Crist dismissed the film as [...] "a banal expedition into slaughter and sadism and stupid dialogue". Any hint of authenticity, she wrote, was obliterated by Winner's [...] "bang-bang-bang approach".|$|E
40|$|AbstractReferring to Gutenberg {{there are}} three {{elementary}} production factors: material, equipment and human workforce. They all have a significant influence on the product quality. Nevertheless, in machining research they have been given differing attention, depending on the focused scope. This paper {{presents the results of}} an empirical study of the human error probability (HEP) in a Cellular Manufacturing environment. First, it is shown that the influence of human work on the resulting product quality in machining so far has only been given little attention. Therefore a content analysis according to Mayring has been conducted on publications in the domains of production technology and ergonomics. Second, various schemes for the classification of human errors are presented and evaluated in terms of their applicability to human tasks in machining. Finally the design and results of an empirical study which has been conducted at the Cellular Manufacturing reference line, consisting of two lathes and four milling machines, in the Center for industrial Productivity (CiP) at TU Darmstadt are presented. Overall 2700 human-machine interactions have been observed and evaluated in terms of their influence on product quality. Results show that there is a significant influence of the human worker as three percent of these interactions incorporated a <b>spurious</b> <b>action...</b>|$|E
40|$|The AII {{amacrine}} cell of mammalian retina collects signals from several hundred rods and is hypothesized to transmit quantal "single-photon" signals at scotopic (starlight) intensities. One problem for this {{theory is that}} the quantal signal from one rod when summed with noise from neighboring rods would be lost if some mechanism did not exist for removing the noise. Several features of the AII might together accomplish such a noise removal operation: The AII is interconnected into a syncytial network by gap junctions, suggesting a noise-averaging function, and a quantal signal from one rod appears in five AII cells due to anatomical divergence. Furthermore, the AII contains voltage-gated Na+ and K+ channels and fires slow action potentials 		 suggesting that it could selectively amplify quantal photon signals embedded in uncorrelated noise. To test this hypothesis, we simulated a square array of AII somas (Rm = 25, 000 Ohm-cm 2) interconnected by gap junctions using a compartmental model. Simulated noisy inputs to the AII produced noise (3. 5 mV) uncorrelated between adjacent cells, and a gap junction conductance of 200 pS reduced the noise by a factor of 2. 5, consistent with theory. Voltage-gated Na+ and K+ channels (Na+: 4 nS, K+: 0. 4 nS) produced slow action potentials similar to those found 	 	 in the presence of noise. For a narrow range of Na+ and coupling conductance, quantal photon events (~ 5 - 10 mV) were amplified nonlinearly by subthreshold regenerative events in the presence of noise. A lower coupling conductance produced <b>spurious</b> <b>action</b> potentials, and a greater conductance reduced amplification. Since the presence of noise in the weakly coupled circuit readily initiates action potentials that tend to spread throughout the AII network, we spe [...] ...|$|E
5000|$|For fear of <b>spurious</b> <b>actions</b> and {{unlimited}} liability {{of the defendant}} {{to all those who}} may suffer nervous shock in one form or other, the English courts have developed a number of [...] "control mechanisms" [...] or limitations of liability for nervous shock. These control mechanisms usually aim at limiting the scope of the defendant's duty of care not to cause nervous shock, as well as at causation and remoteness.|$|R
40|$|Current plan {{recognition}} research {{cannot be}} directly incorporated into real world applications because plan recognizers typically run in exponential time, require a complete plan library as input, and make strong {{assumptions about the}} actor's behavior. The objective of the research outlined in {{this paper is to}} produce a fast and adaptive goal recognizer that performs well in real domains. Additionally, the goal recognizer must learn its own model of the actor's behavior, instead of receiving a complete plan library. Our recognizer is designed to work on "noisy" streams of executed actions, which represent the ongoing behavior of a suboptimal, forgetful human actor who works on multiple goals at once, abandons plans, executes plans that might not achieve their goal, executes <b>spurious</b> <b>actions,</b> and learns new actions and plans. Introduction Plan recognition (e. g. (Carberry 1990; Pollack 1990)), the task of identifying actors' plans and goals given a partial view of their behavior, is ess [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Providing a {{complete}} and accurate domain model for an agent situated in a complex environment can be an extremely difficult task. Actions may have different effects {{depending on the context}} in which they are taken, and actions may or may not induce their intended effects, with the probability of success again depending on context. We present an algorithm for automatically learning planning operators with context-dependent and probabilistic effects in environments where exogenous events change the state of the world. Empirical results show that the algorithm successfully finds operators that capture the true structure of an agent's interactions with its environment, and avoids <b>spurious</b> associations between <b>actions</b> and exogenous events...|$|R

5000|$|Media {{coverage}} of sites and institutions {{have been linked}} to an increase in Call Bombings recorded in those areas. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has published a list of bomb threats from 1969-1980. Of hundreds of threats recorded, a graphical timeline of Call Bomb frequency and Media coverage relating {{to the site of the}} threat, show great parity between the two (Mazur, 1982). This points to media {{coverage of}} a site having strong suggestive powers on potential Call Bombers. Interestingly 10% of Call Bombings were made from a phone within the site of attack (Mazur, 1982). Suggesting the possibility of perpetrators Call Bombing only with the desire to get a day off from the resulting shut down of the site. In conclusion media coverage makes a topic more salient and therefore makes it a prime target for your typical Call Bomber. Threats follow coverage not the other way around. Increases in media coverage is seen graphically as happening before the increase in Call Bombing, therefore debunking the possibility of a <b>spurious</b> correlation. Any <b>action</b> that gives Call Bombing notoriety will cause an increase in the number of bomb threats in general. This can be done slowly through word of mouth, but technological media expedites the process and can make a bomber famous within hours.|$|R
