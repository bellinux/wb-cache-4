40|$|Our aim in {{this essay}} was to find if <b>suspects</b> <b>of</b> foreign and Swedish {{background}} were presented differently in personal case studies made by the probation authority. We have conducted a content analysis of the personal case studies with male assault offenders {{in the range of}} 18 - 23 years old. The study showed that the <b>suspects</b> <b>of</b> foreign background were presented differently in comparison to the <b>suspects</b> <b>of</b> Swedish background. The differences were noticeable foremost in the description <b>of</b> the <b>suspects</b> relationship to family and friends, but also in the description <b>of</b> the <b>suspects</b> possible criminal values. The personal case studies differed {{in the way that the}} <b>suspects</b> <b>of</b> Swedish background had more of a detailed description of relationships to family and friends, but they were also given the opportunity to value their own experience of their relationships. While the description of relationships to the <b>suspects</b> <b>of</b> foreign background consisted more of a mapping of family members and friends with no description <b>of</b> how the <b>suspect</b> experienced the relationships. The presentation <b>of</b> the <b>suspects</b> possible criminal values differed in the way that in the personal case studies <b>of</b> the <b>suspects</b> <b>of</b> Swedish background included a professional statement about their non-criminal values, but the <b>suspects</b> <b>of</b> foreign background had no such statement nor that they had criminal values. Although this haven´t affected the final statement that the probation officer has done. We have argued that the lack of relationship description and statement of criminal values had made the presentation <b>of</b> the foreign <b>suspect</b> as someone who could be perceived as an impersonal stranger with unknown criminal values where preconceived ideas can grow and lead to stigmatizing processes...|$|R
