5|$|The state {{legislature}} extended the highway in 1925, defining it {{to run from}} near the intersection of Army Street (Cesar Chavez Street) and San Bruno Avenue in San Francisco to a point in San Jose. The governor approved the bill with the stipulation that only the portion between the city limits of <b>San</b> <b>Francisco</b> <b>and</b> San Jose would be a state highway. Construction between South <b>San</b> <b>Francisco</b> <b>and</b> Burlingame had begun by 1924, funded by a $500,000 contribution from <b>San</b> <b>Francisco,</b> <b>and</b> was completed in 1928. A disconnected segment north of San Mateo was built by the state at the same time. It was not until February 1929 that the road was fully paved between <b>San</b> <b>Francisco</b> <b>and</b> Burlingame, and on October 20, 1929 the new highway was officially dedicated to San Mateo, several months after the connecting San Mateo-Hayward Bridge opened (at what is now Third Avenue). Even then, motorists {{had to wait until}} May 7, 1931 to reach Jefferson Avenue in Redwood City (near the west end of the four-year-old Dumbarton Bridge). The roadway was extended to Oregon Avenue in Palo Alto in mid-1932, Lawrence Station Road in mid-1933, and to Lafayette Street near Santa Clara, across the Guadalupe River from San Jose, by 1934. The final piece to Oakland Road (13th Street) in San Jose, which was then the main road - Legislative Route 5 and Sign Route 17 - between San Jose and Oakland, was dedicated on June 12, 1937, over ten years after the Dumbarton Bridge opened in January 1927.|$|E

5|$|In 1992, Caltrans {{released}} the first feasibility study detailing {{the possibility of}} electrifying the railroad between <b>San</b> <b>Francisco</b> <b>and</b> San Jose. The 1992 Feasibility Study proposed replacing the existing diesel-electric locomotives with either a fleet of EMD AEM-7 electric locomotives to move the existing gallery passenger cars or Metro North Budd M-2/M-4 EMUs. The primary benefits of an electrified railway would be improvements in air quality, noise, and acceleration, but would also save on other ancillary costs, such as lubricating oil, cooling water, maintenance, and refueling. Because of the relatively close spacing between stops, the improved acceleration using electric locomotives compared to the existing diesel-electric locomotives would cut transit time between <b>San</b> <b>Francisco</b> <b>and</b> San Jose by up to twelve minutes, and using EMUs would cut the time over the same distance by up to 23 minutes, assuming the use of ten-car trainsets. The 1992 Feasibility Study recommended the use of electric locomotives and 25kV AC overhead lines as the most cost-effective alternative, since the gallery cars, which had been built in 1985, were then relatively new and could be reused.|$|E

5|$|Segments {{are further}} divided into work areas, {{indicated}} by brackets {{in the list}} above. Work {{is scheduled to begin}} in Segments 2 and 4 and proceed from north to south within each segment before moving on to Segments 1 and 3.

Within each work area, the first activity will be tree pruning and removal (scheduled duration, two months) followed by construction of the foundations for the overhead contact system poles (scheduled duration, three to five months). Once the foundations are complete, construction of the traction power substation (estimated at twelve months in duration) and pole and wire installation (estimated at three months) will work in parallel. Schedules have been announced for Segment 2, Work Areas 5 (South City/San Bruno), 4 (Millbrae/Burlingame), and 3 (San Mateo).
