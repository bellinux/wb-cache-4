These compounds are used to reduce the high sliding friction by the helical gear cut of the teeth (this cut eliminates the characteristic whine of <b>straight</b> cut <b>spur</b> <b>gears).</b> On motorcycles with [...] "wet" [...] clutches (clutch is bathed in engine oil), there is usually nothing separating {{the lower part of}} the engine from the transmission, so the same oil lubricates both the engine and transmission. The original Mini placed the gearbox in the oil sump below the engine, thus using the same oil for both. The clutch was however a fairly conventional dry plate clutch.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the benefits of}} a drivetrain that is able to disengage its propulsion motor from the driveline in an electric vehicle. The drivetrain was developed for an ultra-efficient eco vehicle competing in the Shell 2013 Eco Marathon. Various clutch mechanisms were examined. In spite of the complexity and losses associated with additional bearings and release surfaces, an actuated dog clutch was chosen as it offers superior performance due to the dual capability of freewheeling and regenerative braking that results. Track data from the event is presented along with experimental work that indicates that the clutch mechanism reduces power consumption by more than 35 % for a ferrous permanent magnet propulsion motor. Savings were reduced to 5 % for a coreless permanent magnet motor coupled to the driveline via an 11 : 1 <b>straight</b> cut <b>spur</b> <b>gear</b> arrangement. This reduced saving was due to the removal of hysteresis and eddy current losses from the stator. The paper also demonstrates during a competition in which the driver was aware of the energy consumption, the driving style changed when the technological option to free wheel was available. Finally the study was inferred onto a real world application with further experimental and simulation work on the Delta E 4 Coupe, a high performance electric sports car. The vehicle uses a ferrous permanent magnet direct drive arrangement, indicated a reduction in power consumption of 10 to 14 %. It is hoped that these insights are relevant when considering the development of electric vehicle drivetrains where machine topology and drive cycle will determine the value of a clutch mechanism...|$|R

Meshed <b>spur</b> <b>gear</b> windage power loss test results are presented at ambient oil inlet temperatures both with and without shrouding. The rate of windage power loss is observed to increase above 10, 000 ft. min., gear surface speed, similar to results presented in the literature. Shrouding is observed to become more effective above 15, 000 ft. min., decreasing power loss by 10 at 25, 000 ft. min. The need for gearbox oil drain slots limits the effectiveness of shrouding on reducing windage power loss. Also, windage power loss is observed to decrease with increasing gearbox temperatures and to increase with oil flow. Windage power losses for the unshrouded meshed <b>spur</b> <b>gears</b> are 7 x more than losses determined from unshrouded single <b>spur</b> <b>gear</b> tests.
