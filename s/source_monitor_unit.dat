50|$|Young {{children}} have more difficulty with understanding and recalling {{the sources of}} information than adults do. Although episodic memory improves throughout childhood, development {{in the area of}} <b>source</b> <b>monitoring</b> tends to occur between the ages of 3 and 8 years. At 3 years, children who are able to immediately recognize the source of the information they obtain have difficulty recalling this information after a short delay. The development of <b>source</b> <b>monitoring</b> is gradual, and children achieve and display competency in certain aspects of <b>source</b> <b>monitoring</b> before others. The developmental trajectory of <b>source</b> <b>monitoring</b> provides insight into what cognitive factors are necessary prerequisites. While there is no generally accepted unified theory for the development of <b>source</b> <b>monitoring,</b> five major theories contribute ideas about how <b>source</b> <b>monitoring</b> develops in children: <b>Source</b> <b>Monitoring</b> Theory, Fuzzy-trace Theory, Schema Theory, Person-based Perspective, and the Mental-state Reasoning Model.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work is to study dose {{non-linearity}} in medical linear accelerators used in conventional radiotherapy and intensity-modulated radiation therapy. Open fields, {{as well as the}} enhanced dynamic wedge ones, were used to collect data for 6 MV and 15 MV photon beams obtained from the VARIAN linear accelerator. Beam stability was checked and confirmed for different dose rates, energies, and application of enhanced dynamic wedge by calculating the charge per <b>monitor</b> <b>unit.</b> <b>Monitor</b> <b>unit</b> error was calculated by the two-exposure method for open and enhanced dynamic wedge beams of 6 MV and 15 MV photons. A significant <b>monitor</b> <b>unit</b> error with maximum values of ± 2. 05931 <b>monitor</b> <b>unit</b> and ± 2. 44787 <b>monitor</b> <b>unit</b> for open and enhanced dynamic wedge beams, respectively, both energy and dose rate dependent, was observed both in the open photon beam and enhanced dynamic wedge fields. However, it exhibited certain irregular patterns at enhanced dynamic wedge angles. Dose <b>monitor</b> <b>unit</b> error exists only because of the overshoot phenomena and electronic delay in dose coincident and integrated circuits with a dependency on the dose rate and photon energy. <b>Monitor</b> <b>unit</b> errors are independent of the application of enhanced dynamic wedge. The existence of <b>monitor</b> <b>unit</b> error demands that the dose non-linearity of the linear accelerator dosimetry system be periodically tested, so as to avoid significant dosimetric errors...|$|R
40|$|In {{clinical}} neuropsychology, <b>source</b> <b>monitoring</b> deficits {{have been}} classically attributed to executive dysfunction. Nevertheless, {{in this review}} we identified only 16 papers that provided statistical data about the relationships between <b>source</b> <b>monitoring</b> and executive processes. Surprisingly, they reported either a total, partial or non-existent relationship between <b>source</b> <b>monitoring</b> and executive tasks. In order to understand and explain these contradictions, we classified the source and executive tasks of the 16 papers according to two well-accepted definitions. Source tasks were classified using the <b>Source</b> <b>Monitoring</b> Framework (Johnson, Hashtroudi, & Lindsay, 1993) which specifies reality and external and internal <b>source</b> <b>monitoring.</b> Executive tasks were classified according to the model of Miyake Friedman, Emerson, Witzki, and Howerter (2000) which specifies complex, shifting, updating and inhibition tasks. We found that evaluation of reality and internal <b>source</b> <b>monitoring</b> was limited. Regarding executive functions, there was no assessment of updating and only a limited assessment of shifting and inhibition. Therefore, the relationship between <b>source</b> <b>monitoring</b> and executive functions remains an open question. Our findings point {{to the need for}} the simultaneous assessment of <b>source</b> <b>monitoring</b> and executive functions as defined by multidimensional theoretical frameworks. Such investigations would help in understanding the relationship between specific <b>source</b> <b>monitoring</b> deficits and specific executive decline in clinical populations...|$|R

40|$|International audienceSOURCE MONITORING FRAMEWORK: <b>Source</b> <b>monitoring</b> {{refers to}} the ability to {{remember}} the origin of information. Three <b>source</b> <b>monitoring</b> processes can be distinguished: external <b>source</b> <b>monitoring,</b> internal or self-monitoring and reality monitoring (i. e. discrimination between internal and external sources of information). <b>Source</b> <b>monitoring</b> decisions are based on memory characteristics recorded such as perceptions, contextual information or emotional reactions and heuristic or more controlled judgement processes. BRAIN STRUCTURES: Several studies suggested that specific structures in the prefrontal and the mediotemporal lobes are the main areas implicated in <b>source</b> <b>monitoring.</b> ASSESSMENT: A typical <b>source</b> <b>monitoring</b> paradigm includes an items generation stage and a second stage of recognition of items (old versus new) and identification of their sources: external (usually the examiner) or internal (the subject). Several indices can be calculated based on the raw data such as the number of false alarms, attribution biases or discrimination indexes. To date, there is no standardized <b>source</b> <b>monitoring</b> task and differences in the type of items used (words, pictures), in the cognitive or emotional effort involved or in the delay between the two test stages, contribute to the heterogeneity of results. FACTORS INFLUENCING SOURCE MONITORING: Factors such as age (either very young or very old) and emotions influence <b>source</b> <b>monitoring</b> performances. Influence of gender was not properly explored, whereas the role of IQ and selective attention is still debated. SOURCE MONITORING DEFICITS IN NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS: <b>Source</b> <b>monitoring</b> deficits are observed mainly in disorders affecting frontotemporal areas, such as frontal trauma, Alzheimer's disease or frontotemporal dementia. SOURCE MONITORING AND SCHIZOPHRENIA: <b>Source</b> <b>monitoring</b> errors (e. g. external misattribution of self-generated information) are observed in schizophrenia and seem to correlate with positive symptomatology, in particular auditory hallucinations, thought intrusion and alien control symptoms. These results are of particular interest in clinical research because <b>source</b> <b>monitoring</b> is one of the rare cognitive tests showing a correlation with the positive dimension. <b>Source</b> <b>monitoring</b> deficits have been proposed as a potential explanation for the positive symptoms and some, but not all studies lent support to this hypothesis. Heterogeneity of studied samples, in particular different criteria to define hallucinating subjects (e. g. currently versus anytime during their lives), could explain the discordant results. SOURCE MONITORING IN PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS WITHIN THE SCHIZOPHRENIC SPECTRUM: <b>Source</b> <b>monitoring</b> impairments were observed in pharmacological models of psychosis, in first degree relatives of schizophrenic patients, and also in the general population associated with schizotypal dimensions. These results support a relationship between <b>source</b> <b>monitoring</b> deficits and some of the symptomatic dimensions of the schizophrenic spectrum but still await replication. SOURCE MONITORING AND OTHER PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS: Some studies found <b>source</b> <b>monitoring</b> deficits in other psychiatric conditions such as mania or obsessive-compulsive disorder. Thus, those studies suggest that <b>source</b> <b>monitoring</b> deficits may be not specific to schizophrenia. CONCLUSION: <b>Source</b> <b>monitoring</b> competencies are critical for good (i. e. adapted) everyday functioning. <b>Source</b> <b>monitoring</b> deficits have been suggested as a potential explanation for some (or all) positive psychotic symptoms. However, to date, methodological inconsistencies (especially with regard to test design and choice of subjects' samples) have precluded firm, definite conclusions...|$|R

40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) Source memory {{refers to}} memory for details about how {{information}} was acquired, {{as opposed to}} memory for the information itself. While participants’ memory for some forms of source information has been extensively researched, performance on external <b>source</b> <b>monitoring</b> tasks for visual stimuli has been less frequently examined. As such, the factors that affect performance on visual <b>source</b> <b>monitoring</b> tasks are not as well understood. There were five key aims of this thesis. A novel visual <b>source</b> <b>monitoring</b> task designed to overcome some {{of the limitations of}} other visual <b>source</b> <b>monitoring</b> tasks reported in the literature was used to firstly investigate the effect of age on <b>source</b> <b>monitoring.</b> Secondly, the effect of source cue type on <b>source</b> <b>monitoring</b> performance was examined. As a result of poor levels of performance for both children and adults on one of the experimental conditions on the <b>source</b> <b>monitoring</b> task, several experimental manipulations were used to determine whether performance could be improved. Examining the effects of task-based factors such as the provision of elaborative encoding instructions, the provision of intentional encoding instructions, and varying the intrinsic versus extrinsic nature of the stimuli was the third aim of this thesis. The fourth aim was to investigate whether factors based on individual differences, such as anticipation of a source memory task and self-initiated strategy use also improved <b>source</b> <b>monitoring</b> performance. Finally, the relationship between performance on working memory and binding tasks, and <b>source</b> <b>monitoring</b> performance was explored. An underlying theme in the results across the five experiments reported in this thesis was that task manipulations or self-initiated actions that served to increase or facilitate the binding between the item and the source information led to improvements in <b>source</b> <b>monitoring</b> accuracy. This thesis has highlighted the importance of effective binding of visually presented item and source information in order to achieve accurate <b>source</b> <b>monitoring</b> performance...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the problem of}} optimal configuration of the <b>monitoring</b> <b>units</b> in a hierarchical distributed monitoring system. A hierarchical distributed monitoring system consists of a hierarchy of <b>monitoring</b> <b>units</b> which are grouped and distributed onto the physical network. The architecture lends itself to parallel processing, reducing the complexity of distributed monitoring caused by factors such as collection and processing of the large quantities of monitoring data. Furthermore, the topology-specific partitioning of the <b>monitoring</b> <b>units</b> allow complex, topology-specific events to be monitored and evaluated in a natural and efficient way. The optimal configuration problem is concerned with finding an optimal hierarchical partition of the <b>monitoring</b> <b>units</b> such that the total processing cost is the minimum. It is a NP-complete problem. In this paper, we study the heuristics for obtaining near-optimal grouping of <b>monitoring</b> <b>units.</b> Simulation of heuristic algorithms for mesh and hypercube networks are presented. The results suggest further system topology specific heuristics. Although the paper is targeted at distributed monitoring, {{we believe that the}} results can also be applied to other hierarchical control problems in distributed computing.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} had two over-arching goals. The {{first was}} {{to study the}} cognitive mechanisms underlying effective <b>source</b> <b>monitoring</b> by clarifying the role that developing executive function skills play in children’s increasing ability to <b>monitor</b> <b>sources.</b> The second goal was to examine whether a particular interview technique called “source-monitoring training” could help children to recall the sources of their memories more accurately. These two separate lines of research were furthered by the same methodology, and thus, these separate research questions were examined simultaneously within both of the experiments conducted for this dissertation. In the first study, {{the difficulty of the}} source-monitoring decisions was manipulated by testing 4 - to 8 -year-old children’s memories of a lab-based event after a shorter delay (1 - 2 days) or a longer delay (8 - 10 days). Within these two conditions, I explored both the relationship of <b>source</b> <b>monitoring</b> to executive function, as well as the effectiveness of the source-monitoring training procedure. The results of this study showed that executive function was related to <b>source</b> <b>monitoring,</b> and mediation models demonstrated how children’s <b>source</b> <b>monitoring</b> improves with age due to developments in working memory, which improve event encoding and therefore, <b>source</b> <b>monitoring.</b> The effects of source-monitoring training were not as clear as expected; the only group to benefit from the training were older children in the shorter delay condition. Interestingly, neither the relationship between executive function and <b>source</b> <b>monitoring</b> nor the effects of source-monitoring training were affected by the difficulty of the task. In the second study, 4 - to 8 -year-old children’s <b>source</b> <b>monitoring</b> was examined within a repeated-event paradigm. The inclusion of more than two sources (i. e., events) created a more realistic and generalizable task. Again, both the relationship between executive function and <b>source</b> <b>monitoring</b> and the effectiveness of source-monitoring training were examined within the same study. In this study, there was evidence that two broad components of executive function as measured through parent reports were related to <b>source</b> <b>monitoring.</b> The source-monitoring training did not improve source accuracy, but did impact the types of errors children made, such that older children who received the training were more likely to say, “I don’t know” instead of confusing the events. Testing these relationships in a variety of conditions illustrates how cognitive and interview factors are related to <b>source</b> <b>monitoring,</b> demonstrating clear links between executive function and <b>source</b> <b>monitoring,</b> but mixed evidence for the effectiveness of source-monitoring training. Collectively, my doctoral program of research contributes a greater understanding of how <b>source</b> <b>monitoring</b> develops and whether source-monitoring training could be used in practice...|$|R

30|$|The {{use case}} we {{selected}} for evaluating our architecture {{is related to}} road traffic and road condition monitoring in the Finnish highway network. The Finnish highway network has nearly 10, 000 kilometers of road. If <b>monitoring</b> <b>units</b> consisting of equipment to monitor traffic and weather conditions are deployed on highways for instance on the average every five kilometers, the resulting system has 2, 000 <b>monitoring</b> <b>units.</b> With an average distance of one kilometer, there would be 10, 000 <b>monitoring</b> <b>units.</b> We further assume that these units, which act as PNs, are equipped with 3 G HSDPA modules. The <b>monitoring</b> <b>units</b> are coupled with variable speed limit displays and warning displays {{that are used to}} show information to the users of the road. Every <b>monitoring</b> <b>unit</b> acts as a PN for 1 - 100 wireless sensors (LNs) in a local WSN. The sensors are used for monitoring various conditions such as road surface temperature (to detect ice formation), air temperature, wind speed, wind direction, humidity, light, the amount of chemicals applied for prevention of freezing of water, water layer thickness, black ice, traffic volume, speed of vehicles (e.g., using a radar), and accidents (e.g., using video cameras coupled with computer vision). The data from the sensors can be used to adjust the current speed limit and show warnings to the users of the road on the warning displays. We assume that a given <b>monitoring</b> <b>unit</b> uses not only local information but information from sensors in nearby WSNs as input for showing warnings and for determining an appropriate speed limit to optimize the flow of traffic. For this, every <b>monitoring</b> <b>unit</b> is assumed to have on the average 10 outgoing CoAP observation relationships. The mean time between notifications is assumed to be either 1 min or 10 min.|$|R

40|$|Background: Sudden {{unexpected}} {{death in}} epilepsy (SUDEP) {{is the leading}} cause of death in people with chronic refractory epilepsy. Very rarely, SUDEP occurs in epilepsy <b>monitoring</b> <b>units,</b> providing highly informative data for its still elusive pathophysiology. The MORTEMUS study expanded these data through comprehensive evaluation of cardiorespiratory arrests encountered in epilepsy <b>monitoring</b> <b>units</b> worldwide. Methods: Between Jan 1, 2008, and Dec 29, 2009, we did a systematic retrospective survey of epilepsy <b>monitoring</b> <b>units</b> located in Europe, Israel, Australia, and New Zealand, to retrieve data for all cardiorespiratory arrests recorded in these units and estimate their incidence. Epilepsy <b>monitoring</b> <b>units</b> from other regions were invited to report similar cases to further explore the mechanisms. An expert panel reviewed data, including video electroencephalogram (VEEG) and electrocardiogram material at the time of cardiorespiratory arrests whenever available. Findings: 147 (92 %) of 160 units responded to the survey. 29 cardiorespiratory arrests, including 16 SUDEP (14 at night), nine near SUDEP, and four deaths from other causes, were reported. Cardiorespiratory data, available for ten cases of SUDEP, showed a consistent and previously unrecognised pattern whereby rapid breathing (18 - 50 breaths per min) developed after secondary generalised tonic-clonic seizure, followed within 3 min by transient or terminal cardiorespiratory dysfunction. Where transient, this dysfunction later recurred with terminal apnoea occurring within 11 min of the end of the seizure, followed by cardiac arrest. SUDEP incidence in adult epilepsy <b>monitoring</b> <b>units</b> was 5. 1 (95 % CI 2. 6 - 9. 2) per 1000 patient-years, with a risk of 1. 2 (0. 6 - 2. 1) per 10 000 VEEG monitorings, probably aggravated by suboptimum supervision and possibly by antiepileptic drug withdrawal. Interpretation: SUDEP in epilepsy <b>monitoring</b> <b>units</b> primarily follows an early postictal, centrally mediated, severe alteration of respiratory and cardiac function induced by generalised tonic-clonic seizure, leading to immediate death or a short period of partly restored cardiorespiratory function followed by terminal apnoea then cardiac arrest.

40|$|Introduction: Auditory {{hallucinations}} {{are seen}} in different psychiatric and neurological disorders {{as well as in}} healthy people. It is suggested that <b>source</b> <b>monitoring</b> impairments in self recognition and an external attribution bias would lead to hallucinations. In this current study this assumption was examined by comparing participants with and without hallucinations. Furthermore, it was examined whether there is a relation between <b>source</b> <b>monitoring</b> performance and the constructs negative affect and insight into the hallucinations. Methods: In this study two groups of participants with hallucinations were included; 40 subjects with the auditory Charles Bonnet Syndrome (ACBS) and 19 participants diagnosed with schizophrenia spectrum disorders. The third group consisted of 16 healthy control participants without hallucinations. <b>Source</b> <b>monitoring</b> was measured by a <b>source</b> <b>monitoring</b> task. Negative affect was measured by the scores on the Beck Depression Inventory, the Beck anxiety inventory and a composited general negative affect score. Insight into the hallucinations was measured by the newly designed Questionnaire Psychotic Experiences. Groups were compared by MANCOVA and correlation analyzes were conducted in order to examine relations between the different variables. Results: The groups did not differ on <b>source</b> <b>monitoring</b> performance and no impairment in self-recognition nor an external attribution bias was found in any of the three groups. For the schizophrenia spectrum group a correlation between higher scores on the BAI and general negative affect and impaired <b>source</b> <b>monitoring</b> performance was found. For the ACBS group a relation between less insight in hallucinations and impaired <b>source</b> <b>monitoring</b> was found. Conclusion: This study failed to confirm the involvement of impairments in self- recognition and an externalizing bias in hallucinations in participants with schizophrenia spectrum disorders and participants with the ACBS syndrome. Based on the differences between these groups on negative affect and insight in hallucinations and the way these constructs correlate with <b>source</b> <b>monitoring,</b> it is seems that the ACBS and schizophrenia spectrum group reflect different groups. Therefore it is possible that for these groups different mechanisms lead to the experience of the hallucinations...|$|R

The low cost PMU (Portable <b>Monitoring</b> <b>Unit),</b> and MAEMU (Mobile Air Emission <b>Monitoring</b> <b>Unit)</b> are systems used for ammonia concentration monitoring and, with broiler house ventilation rate, ammonia emission rate (ER) can be calculated. The accuracy of ammonia emission rate calculated {{with data from}} the PMU using a simplified calculation algorithm was quantified using the MAEMU as a standard...|$|R
40|$|The <b>Source</b> <b>Monitoring</b> Framework is a {{promising}} model of constructive memory, yet fails {{because it is}} connectionist and does not allow content tagging. The Dual-Process Signal Detection Model is an improvement because it reduces mnemic qualia to a single memory signal (or degree of belief), but still commits itself to non-discrete representation. By supposing that ‘tagging’ means the assignment of propositional attitudes to aggregates of anemic characteristics informed inductively, then a discrete model becomes plausible. A Bayesian model of <b>source</b> <b>monitoring</b> accounts for the continuous variation of inputs and assignment of prior probabilities to memory content.
