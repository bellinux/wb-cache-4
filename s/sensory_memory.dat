40|$|In nature, animals form {{memories}} associating reward or punishment with stimuli {{from different}} sensory modalities, such as smells and colors. It is unclear, however, how distinct <b>sensory</b> <b>memories</b> are processed in the brain. We established appetitive and aversive visual learning assays for Drosophila that {{are comparable to}} the widely used olfactory learning assays. These assays share critical features, such as reinforcing stimuli (sugar reward and electric shock punishment), and allow direct comparison of the cellular requirements for visual and olfactory memories. We found that the same subsets of dopamine neurons drive formation of both <b>sensory</b> <b>memories.</b> Furthermore, distinct yet partially overlapping subsets of mushroom body intrinsic neurons are required for visual and olfactory memories. Thus, our results suggest that distinct <b>sensory</b> <b>memories</b> are processed in a common brain center.

2500|$|As Rivers {{notes in}} Instinct and the Unconscious, one manifestation of {{his lack of}} visual memory was his {{inability}} to visualise {{any part of the}} upper floor of the house he lived in until he was five. This visual blank is made even more significant by the fact that Rivers was able to describe the lower floors of that particular house with far more accuracy than {{he had been able to}} with any house since and, although images of later houses were faded and incomplete, no memory since had been as inaccessible as that of the upper floor of his early home. [...] With the evidence that he was presented with, Rivers was led to the conclusion that something had happened to him on the upper floor of that house, the memory of which was entirely suppressed because it [...] "interfered with [...] comfort and happiness". Indeed, not only was that specific memory rendered inaccessible but his <b>sensory</b> <b>memory</b> in general appears to have been severely handicapped from that moment.|$|E
2500|$|In a model {{outlined}} by Stefan Koelsch and Walter Siebel, music stimuli are perceived in a successive timeline, {{breaking down the}} auditory input into different characteristics and meaning. He maintained that upon perception the sound reaches the auditory nerve, brainstem and thalamus. At this point features involving pitch height, chroma, timbre, intensity and roughness are extracted. This occurs about at about 10–100ms. Next, melodic and rhythmic grouping occurs, which is then perceived by auditory <b>sensory</b> <b>memory.</b> After this, an analysis is made of intervals and chord progressions. A harmony is then built upon the structure of metre, rhythm and timbre. This occurs from about 180–400ms after the initial perception. Following this, structural reanalysis and repair occur, at about 600–900ms. Finally, the autonomic nervous system and multimodal association cortices are activated. Koelsch and Siebel proposed that from about 250–500ms, based on the sound's meaning, interpretation and emotion occurs continuously throughout this process. This is indicated by N400, a negative spike at 400ms, as measured by an [...] "event related potential".|$|E

5000|$|Another 2009 Oxford study {{suggests}} that playing Tetris-like video games may help prevent the development of traumatic memories.

5000|$|<b>Sensory</b> <b>memory</b> holds sensory {{information}} {{less than one}} second after an item is perceived. The ability to look at an item and remember {{what it looked like}} with just a split second of observation, or memorization, is the example of <b>sensory</b> <b>memory.</b> It is out of cognitive control and is an automatic response. With very short presentations, participants often report that they seem to [...] "see" [...] more than they can actually report. The first experiments exploring this form of <b>sensory</b> <b>memory</b> were precisely conducted by George Sperling (1963) [...] using the [...] "partial report paradigm". Subjects were presented with a grid of 12 letters, arranged into three rows of four. After a brief presentation, subjects were then played either a high, medium or low tone, cuing them which of the rows to report. Based on these partial report experiments, Sperling was able to show that the capacity of <b>sensory</b> <b>memory</b> was approximately 12 items, but that it degraded very quickly (within a few hundred milliseconds). Because this form of memory degrades so quickly, participants would see the display but be unable to report all of the items (12 in the [...] "whole report" [...] procedure) before they decayed. This type of memory cannot be prolonged via rehearsal.|$|E

50|$|Intermediate-term memory (ITM) is a {{stage of}} memory {{distinct}} from <b>sensory</b> <b>memory,</b> working memory/short-term memory, and long-term memory. While <b>sensory</b> <b>memory</b> persists for several milliseconds, working memory persists for up to thirty seconds, and long-term memory persists from thirty minutes {{to the end of}} an individual's life, intermediate-term memory persists for about two to three hours. This overlap in the durations of these memory processes indicates that they occur simultaneously, rather than sequentially. Indeed, intermediate-term facilitation can be produced in the absence of long-term facilitation. However, the boundaries between these forms of memory are not clear-cut, and they can vary depending on the task. Intermediate-term memory is thought to be supported by the parahippocampal cortex.|$|E

50|$|Memory {{is divided}} into {{voluntary}} (conscious) and involuntary (unconscious) processes that function independently of each other. Theories and research on memory dates back to Hermann Ebbinghaus, who began studying nonsense syllables. Ebbinghaus classified three distinct classes of memory: sensory, short term, and long-term memory. <b>Sensory</b> <b>memory</b> {{is made up of}} a brief storage of information within a specific medium (the line you see after waving a sparkler in your field of vision is created by <b>sensory</b> <b>memory).</b> Short term memory is made up of the information currently in use to complete the task at hand. Long term memory is composed of the systems used to store memory over long periods. It enables one to remember what happened two days ago at noon, or who called last night.|$|E
5000|$|Human memory can {{be divided}} into three broad categories: Long-term Memory, <b>Sensory</b> <b>Memory,</b> and Short-term (Working) Memory. According to the formal definition, working memory is [...] "a system for {{temporarily}} storing and managing the information required to carry out complex cognitive tasks such as learning, reasoning, and comprehension." [...] The paramount feature that distinguishes the working memory from both the long-term and <b>sensory</b> <b>memory</b> is this system's ability to simultaneously process and store information. The knowledge has what is called a [...] "limited capacity", so there is only a certain amount of information that can be stored and it is easily accessible for only a small window of time after it has been processed, with a recall time block of roughly fifteen seconds to one minute.|$|E

40|$|The {{value of}} reward {{obtained}} with successful behavior {{is important for}} guiding purposeful behavior. The lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) has been implicated in working memory that guides goal-directed behavior. However, mechanism that integrates the reward value into the working memory for goal-directed behavior is not understood. To help clarify this issue, we examined the effect of reward expectation on the neuronal process in the LPFC associated with memory-based sensorimotor processing. By temporally dissociating visuospatial sensory and saccade-directional motor memories in the LPFC, we here show that reward expectation significantly enhanced the directional selectivity of <b>sensory</b> working <b>memory</b> but {{did not affect the}} directional selectivity of motor memory. The enhancement of <b>sensory</b> working <b>memory</b> in the neuronal population was sustained during the delay but extinguished soon after the motor memory appeared. These results suggest that the expectation of high reward value primarily affects the <b>sensory</b> working <b>memory</b> that may be used for behavioral guidance rather than preparation for forthcoming saccades. It thus appears that the LPFC is a neuronal substrate for working memory used to guide a reward-oriented behavior, rather than reflecting an efficient control of motor action in motivated states...|$|R

50|$|There {{are three}} main types of memories: <b>sensory</b> <b>memory,</b> {{short-term}} memory, and long-term memory. <b>Sensory</b> <b>memory</b> in short {{is the ability}} to hold sensory information {{for a short period of}} time, for example looking at an object and being able to remember what it looked like moments after. Short-term memory is memory that allows a person to recall a short period of time; this can be a few seconds to a minute. Short-term memory allows people to remember what happened during that short time span without actually practicing the memory. Long-term memory has a much larger capacity than the prior two and actually stores information from both these types of memories to create a long lasting and large memory. Long-term memory is the largest target for research involving selective memory erasure.|$|E

50|$|George Sperling (born 1934) is an American {{cognitive}} psychologist. He is a Distinguished Professor of both Cognitive Science and Neurobiology & Behavior at the University of California, Irvine. Sperling {{documented the}} existence of iconic memory (one of the <b>sensory</b> <b>memory</b> subtypes). Through several experiments, he showed support for his hypothesis that human beings store a perfect image of the visual world for a brief moment, before it is discarded from memory. He was in the forefront in wanting to help the deaf population in terms of speech recognition. He argued that the telephone was created originally for the hearing impaired but it became popularized by the hearing community. He suggested with a sevenfold reduction in the bandwidth for video transmission, it can be useful for the improvement in American Sign Language communication. Sperling used a method of partial report to measure {{the time course of}} visual persistence (<b>sensory</b> <b>memory).</b>|$|E
40|$|Signals {{representing}} the value assigned to stimuli {{at the time}} of choice have been repeatedly observed in ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC). Yet it remains unknown how these value representations are computed from <b>sensory</b> and <b>memory</b> representations in more posterior brain regions. We used electroencephalography (EEG) while subjects evaluated appetitive and aversive food items to study how event-related responses modulated by stimulus value evolve over time. We found that value-related activity shifted from posterior to anterior, and from parietal to central to frontal sensors, across three major time windows after stimulus onset: 150 - 250 ms, 400 - 550 ms, and 700 - 800 ms. Exploratory localization of the EEG signal revealed a shifting network of activity moving from <b>sensory</b> and <b>memory</b> structures to areas associated with value coding, with stimulus value activity localized to vmPFC only from 400 ms onwards. Consistent with these results, functional connectivity analyses also showed a causal flow of information from temporal cortex to vmPFC. Thus, although value signals are present as early as 150 ms after stimulus onset, the value signals in vmPFC appear relatively late in the choice process, and seem to reflect the integration of incoming information from <b>sensory</b> and <b>memory</b> related regions...|$|R
40|$|Previously, we {{demonstrated}} that visual and olfactory associative memories of Drosophila share mushroom body (MB) circuits (Vogt et al., 2014). Unlike for odor representation, the MB circuit for visual information {{has not been}} characterized. Here, we show that a small subset of MB Kenyon cells (KCs) selectively responds to visual but not olfactory stimulation. The dendrites of these atypical KCs form a ventral accessory calyx (vAC), distinct from the main calyx that receives olfactory input. We identified two types of visual projection neurons (VPNs) directly connecting the optic lobes and the vAC. Strikingly, these VPNs are differentially required for visual memories of color and brightness. The segregation of visual and olfactory domains in the MB allows independent processing of distinct <b>sensory</b> <b>memories</b> and may be a conserved form of sensory representations among insects...|$|R
