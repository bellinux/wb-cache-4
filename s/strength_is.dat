5|$|Of all {{the major}} {{distributed}} computing projects involved in protein research, Folding@home {{is the only one}} not using the BOINC platform. Both Rosetta@home and Folding@home study protein misfolding diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, but Folding@home does so much more exclusively. Folding@home almost exclusively uses all-atom molecular dynamics models to understand how and why proteins fold (or potentially misfold, and subsequently aggregate to cause diseases). In other words, Folding@home's <b>strength</b> <b>is</b> modeling the process of protein folding, while Rosetta@home's <b>strength</b> <b>is</b> computing protein design and predicting protein structure and docking.|$|E
5|$|SG 4 {{was led by}} Alfred Druschel. It had 152 {{machines}} on strength, {{of which}} just 60 were operational, yet the 129 pilots were fit for action.

III./SG reported 24 Fw 190s, but only 16 were available at the forward airfields. Pilot <b>strength</b> <b>is</b> unknown.

30|$|At first, the {{localized}} MOEs and KARs {{within each}} layer in virtual GLT were randomly {{picked up from}} the actual lamina database {{as long as the}} virtual GLT length. Second, localized tensile <b>strengths</b> <b>were</b> generated from the adjusted localized MOE and KAR using Eq. (6). Third, in manufacturing process of GLT, the ends of same lamina grades are connected with finger joint. Thus, finger-jointed <b>strengths</b> <b>were</b> applied according to lamina size and MOE lamina grade. The finger-jointed <b>strengths</b> <b>were</b> generated by the Weibull inverse cumulative distribution function. Weibull parameters for finger-jointed <b>strengths</b> <b>were</b> derived from full-scale tensile strength tests.|$|R

5|$|Examination of fruiting bodies using {{scanning}} {{electron microscopy}} and transmission electron microscopy has revealed details about their ultrastructure—their microscopic architecture and arrangement. For example, the hyphae of the hapteron form a dense tangled network, while the hyphae of the funicular cord are arranged in a twisted form like a rope. Further, the funicular cord, known to be highly elastic and with a high tensile <b>strength,</b> <b>is</b> made of thicker hyphae {{than the rest of}} the funiculus. Also, the ecto- and endoperidium are made of thick-walled, unbranched hyphae, known as skeletal hyphae. It has been proposed that these skeletal hyphae form a structural network that helps the fruiting body maintain the elasticity vital for proper functioning of the spore dispersal mechanism.|$|E

5|$|Factory-based {{industry}} {{accounted for}} an estimated 29.7% of GDP in 2009. More than 75% of Cameroon's industrial <b>strength</b> <b>is</b> located in Douala and Bonabéri. Cameroon possesses substantial mineral resources, {{but these are not}} extensively mined (see Mining in Cameroon). Petroleum exploitation has fallen since 1986, but this is still a substantial sector such that dips in prices have a strong effect on the economy. Rapids and waterfalls obstruct the southern rivers, but these sites offer opportunities for hydroelectric development and supply most of Cameroon's energy. The Sanaga River powers the largest hydroelectric station, located at Edéa. The rest of Cameroon's energy comes from oil-powered thermal engines. Much of the country remains without reliable power supplies.|$|E

This, together with a high shear modulus and a very low figure for Poisson's ratio (the relationship of longitudinal to lateral strain), indicate {{the high degree of}} stiffness and resistance to deformation that have rendered its fabrication into useful components a matter of great difficulty. Despite these limitations and iridium's high cost, a number of applications have developed where mechanical <b>strength</b> <b>is</b> an essential factor in some of the extremely severe conditions encountered in modern technology.|$|E
5|$|Outside of battle, {{the game}} {{contains}} some strong role-playing video game traditions. For example, Mario's <b>strength</b> <b>is</b> determined by multiple statistical fields and status-boosting items {{that can be}} used in and outside of combat. The effects of these items range from healing Mario or his partner to damaging the opponent. Mario can also purchase badges from non-player characters or occasionally obtain them from defeated enemies; when equipped, these badges can permanently enhance a particular skill or aspect, or, in some cases, give Mario new moves, including Power Jump and Quake Hammer. Throughout the game, Mario is permanently assisted by a party member. Each party member has a specialised skill, some of which are required to solve puzzles to advance progression in the game. More party members are gained as the player advances through the game.|$|E

5|$|Saturn's {{interior}} is probably {{composed of a}} core of iron–nickel and rock (silicon and oxygen compounds). This core {{is surrounded by a}} deep layer of metallic hydrogen, an intermediate layer of liquid hydrogen and liquid helium, and finally a gaseous outer layer. Saturn has a pale yellow hue due to ammonia crystals in its upper atmosphere. Electrical current within the metallic hydrogen layer is thought to give rise to Saturn's planetary magnetic field, which is weaker than Earth's, but has a magnetic moment 580 times that of Earth due to Saturn's larger size. Saturn's magnetic field <b>strength</b> <b>is</b> around one-twentieth of Jupiter's. The outer atmosphere is generally bland and lacking in contrast, although long-lived features can appear.

5|$|Spot welding is {{a popular}} {{resistance}} welding method used to join overlapping metal sheets of up to 3mm thick.

Weld <b>strength</b> <b>is</b> significantly lower than with other welding methods, making the process suitable for only certain applications.

Jupiter's magnetic field rotates at the same speed as the region below its atmosphere, with a period of 9h55m.
