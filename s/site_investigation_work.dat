The problem is further aggravated by a data validation process that is often devoid of professional judgment. As a result, many site investigation (SI) studies do not provide sufficient or representative chemical data necessary to make solid decisions related to the selection and implementation of remedial actions.

40|$|There {{has been}} a lot of {{interest}} in the relationship between uniaxial compressive strength (UCS) and other properties of rock. Evaluation of rock parameters such as cohesion, Young's modulus, angle of friction, and Poisson's ratio is required for numerical modeling of rock. Finding empirical relations between these parameters with UCS has been focused. On the basis of the ranges of UCS available in the literature for different types of rocks, 14 empirical relations were developed on the basis of a random number-generation technique, and the relations were validated with available experimental data. The proposed relations were compared with available empirical equations in the literature. The proposed relations can be used to solve various problems in rocky sites by numerical modeling with acceptable accuracy.

40|$|Engineering {{properties}} of rocks such as {{unconfined compressive strength}} (UCS) and Young’s modulus (E) are among the essential parameters {{for the design of}} tunnel excavations. Many {{attempts have been made to}} develop indirect methods of estimating UCS and E. This is generally attributed to the difficulty of preparing and conducting the aforementioned tests in a laboratory. In essence, this study aims to present two predictive models of UCS and E for granite using an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). The required rock samples for model development (45 granite sample sets) were obtained from <b>site</b> <b>investigation</b> <b>work</b> at the Pahang-Selangor raw water transfer tunnel, which was excavated across the Main Range of Peninsular Malaysia. In developing the predictive models, dry density, ultrasonic velocity, quartz content and plagioclase were set as model inputs. These parameters were selected based on simple and multiple regression analyses presented in the article. However, for the sake of comparison, the prediction performances of the ANFIS models were checked against multiple regression analysis (MRA) and artificial neural network (ANN) predictive models of UCS and E. The capacity performances of the predictive models were assessed based on the value account for (VAF), root mean squared error (RMSE) and coefficient of determination (R 2). It was found that the ANFIS predictive model of UCS, with R 2, RMSE and VAF equal to 0. 985, 6. 224 and 98. 455 %, respectively, outperforms the MRA and ANN models. A similar conclusion was drawn for the ANFIS predictive model of E where the values of R 2, RMSE and VAF were 0. 990, 3. 503 and 98. 968 %, respectivel...|$|E
40|$|The {{proposed}} {{port and}} airport construction in Hong Kong requires placing of fill to reclaim {{land from the}} surrounding sea. To accomplish this, {{a substantial amount of}} marine sand will be mined from the nearby shallow waters. The large quantity of fill, the size or the filling operation; and the significance of the project, merit careful consideration of the mechanical behaviours of the filling materials. In this study, a programme for the determination of the basic mechanical properties, static and dynamic behaviours of three marine sands found in Hong Kong is described. These marine sands were mined by trailer hopper dredgers from borrow areas located in South Tathong Channel, Urmston Road and outer Deep Bay, within the territorial water of Hong Kong. These marine sands are transported to the West Kowloon Reclamation site, Tin Shui Wai and Tseung Kwan O Reclamation sites, respectively, for hydraulic filling. Both in-situ samples and bulk samples were taken from the reclamation <b>sites</b> for laboratory <b>investigation.</b> <b>Site</b> <b>investigation</b> <b>works</b> were carried out by the use of CPT investigation technique.

40|$|Considerable {{savings in}} the cost and time {{expended}} in design and construction work will result from more realistic appraisal of material transitional between engineering soil and engineering rock. Research was therefore directed to seeking means of maximising the return of relevant information from routine <b>site</b> <b>investigation</b> <b>work.</b> Definitions of 'transitional material' are proposed, based on geological, contractual and technical criteria. Related definitions are proposed for 'engineering soil' and 'engineering rock'. Flow charts {{have been developed to}} assist in the categorisation of geotechnical material into the types proposed by a Working Party of the Geological Society (1977) and BS 5930 : 1081. Simple laboratory and fieldwork index testing was found to provide an adequate basis for the realistic assessment of the potential engineering behaviour of a range of geotechnical materials. Some modification to routine procedures is proposed for work with transitional material. Pressuremeter testing was generally found to give reproduceable results in fresh oolitic limestone (Beerstone) and in highly weathered Shale, Keuper Marl and Granite. The results of high pressure triaxial and pressuremeter testing of Beerstone are compared and assessed. Further comparison is drawn between the results of pressuremeter testing of Keuper Marl and those obtained during a commercial site investigation from (i) plate bearing tests, and (ii) laboratory testing, of material from the same site. The means of obtaining and communicating geotechnical information are critically appraised. Modifications are proposed to usually adopted contractual attitudes and procedures to assist in the prediction of the geotechnical behaviour of transitional materials which are difficult to assess yet often critical to design and contractual decisions.

40|$|Oxidizing {{conditions}} normally {{prevail in}} surface waters and near-surface groundwaters, {{but there is}} usually a change to reducing conditions in groundwater at greater depth. Dissolved O 2 originally present is consumed through biogenic and inorganic reactions along the flow paths. Fracture minerals participate in these reactions and the fracture mineralogy and geochemistry {{can be used to}} trace the redox front. An important task in the safety assessment of a potential repository for the disposal of nuclear waste in crystalline bedrock, at an approximate depth of 500  m in Sweden, is to demonstrate that reducing conditions can be maintained {{for a long period of}} time. Oxygen may damage the Cu canisters that host nuclear waste; additionally, in the event of a canister failure, oxidizing conditions may increase the mobility of some radionuclides. The present study of the near-surface redox front is based on mineralogical (redox-sensitive minerals), geochemical (redox-sensitive elements) and U-series disequilibrium investigations of mineral coatings along open fractures. The fractures have been sampled along drill cores from closely spaced, 100  m deep boreholes, which were drilled during the <b>site</b> <b>investigation</b> <b>work</b> in the Laxemar area, south-eastern Sweden, carried out by the Swedish Nuclear Fuel and Waste Management Co. (SKB). The distribution of the redox-sensitive minerals pyrite and goethite in open fractures shows that the redox front (switch from mainly goethite to mainly pyrite in the fractures) generally occurs at about 15 – 20  m depth. Calcite leaching by recharging water is indicated in the upper 20 – 30  m and positive Ce-anomalies suggest oxidation of Ce down to 20  m depth. The U-series radionuclides show disequilibrium in most of the samples, indicating mobility of U during the last 1  Ma. In the upper 20  m, U is mainly removed (due to oxidation) or has experienced complex removal and/or deposition. At depths of 35 – 55  m, both deposition and removal of U are indicated. Below 55  m, recent deposition of U is generally indicated which suggests removal of U near surface (oxidation) and deposition of U below the redox front. Scattered goethite occurrences below the general redox front (down to ca 80  m) and signs of U removal at 35 – 55  m mostly correlate with sections of high transmissivity (and/or high fracture frequencies). This shows that highly transmissive fractures are generally required to allow oxygenated groundwaters at depth greater than ca 30  m. Removal of U (oxidation) below 55  m within the last 300  ka is not observed. Although penetration of glacial waters to great depths has been confirmed in the study area, their potential O 2 load seems to have been reduced near the surface...|$|E
40|$|The Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC), {{an agency}} of the U. S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), {{operated}} a grain storage facility at the northeastern {{edge of the city}} of Hanover, Kansas, from 1950 until the early 1970 s. During this time, commercial grain fumigants containing carbon tetrachloride were in common use by the grain storage industry to preserve grain in their facilities. In February 1998, trace to low levels of carbon tetrachloride (below the maximum contaminant level [MCL] of 5. 0 {micro}g/L) were detected in two private wells near the former grain storage facility at Hanover, as part of a statewide USDA private well sampling program that was implemented by the Kansas Department of Health and Environment (KDHE) near former CCC/USDA facilities. In 2007, the CCC/USDA conducted near-surface soil sampling at 61 locations and also sampled indoor air at nine residences on or adjacent to its former Hanover facility to address the residents concerns regarding vapor intrusion. Low levels of carbon tetrachloride were detected at four of the nine homes. The results were submitted to the KDHE in October 2007 (Argonne 2007). On the basis of the results, the KDHE requested sub-slab sampling and/or indoor air sampling (KDHE 2007). This Work Plan describes, in detail, the proposed additional scope of work requested by the KDHE and has been developed as a supplement to the comprehensive <b>site</b> <b>investigation</b> <b>work</b> plan that is pending (Argonne 2008). Indoor air samples collected previously from four homes at Hanover were shown to contain the carbon tetrachloride at low concentrations (Table 2. 1). It cannot be concluded from these previous data that the source of the detected carbon tetrachloride is vapor intrusion attributable to former grain storage operations of the CCC/USDA at Hanover. The technical objective of the vapor intrusion investigation described here is to assess the risk to human health due to the potential for upward migration of carbon tetrachloride and chloroform into four homes located on or adjacent to the former CCC/USDA facility. The technical objective will be accomplished by collecting sub-slab vapor samples. The preliminary data collected during the July 2007 investigation did not fully address the source of or migration pathway for the carbon tetrachloride detected in the four homes. The scope of work proposed here will generate additional data needed to help evaluate whether the source of the detected carbon tetrachloride is vapor intrusion attributable to activities of the CCC/USDA. The additional vapor sampling at Hanover will be performed, on behalf of the CCC/USDA, by the Environmental Science Division of Argonne National Laboratory and H&P Mobile Geochemistry of San Diego ([URL] Argonne is a nonprofit, multidisciplinary research center operated by UChicago Argonne, LLC, for the U.

40|$|The <b>site</b> <b>investigation</b> phase plays a {{vital role}} in any {{foundation}} design where inadequate characterisation of the subsurface conditions may lead to either a significantly over designed foundation that is not cost-effective, or an under-designed foundation, which may result in foundation failure. As such, the scope of an investigation should be dependent on the conditions at the site and the importance of the structure. However, it is common for the expense dedicated to the <b>site</b> <b>investigation</b> to be a fraction of the total cost of the project, and is typically determined by budget and time constraints, and the experience and judgement of the geotechnical engineer. However, additional <b>site</b> <b>investigation</b> expenditure or sampling is expected to reduce the financial risk of the design by reducing the uncertainties in the geotechnical system and protecting against possible foundation failures. This research has quantified the relative benefits of undertaking <b>site</b> <b>investigations</b> of increased and differing scope. This has been achieved by simulating the design process to yield a foundation design {{based on the results of}} a <b>site</b> <b>investigation.</b> Such a design has been compared to an optimal design that utilises the complete knowledge of the soil, which has only been possible due to the use of simulated soils. Comparisons between these two design types indicate the performance of the <b>site</b> <b>investigation</b> to accurately or adequately characterise the site conditions. Furthermore, the design based on the results of the <b>site</b> <b>investigation</b> have been analysed using the complete knowledge of the soil. This yields a probability of failure and, therefore, has been included in a risk analysis where the costs associated with the <b>site</b> <b>investigation</b> have been measured against the financial risk of the design. As such, potential savings in financial risk for increased <b>site</b> <b>investigation</b> expenditure have been subsequently identified. A Monte Carlo analysis has been used in this research to incorporate the uncertainties in the foundation design process. Uncertainties have been included due to soil variability; sampling errors; measurement and transformation model errors; and errors related to the use of a simplified foundation response prediction method. The Monte Carlo analysis has also provided the means to obtain results in a probabilistic framework to enable reliability and risk analyses. Computer code has been specifically developed with an aim to: generate a simulated soil that conforms to the variability of soil properties; simulate a <b>site</b> <b>investigation</b> to estimate data for a foundation design; simulate the design of a foundation and conduct a reliability and risk analysis of such a design. Results indicate that there are significant benefits to be derived from increasing the scope of a <b>site</b> <b>investigation</b> in terms of the risk and reliability of the foundation design. However, it also appears that an optimal <b>site</b> <b>investigation</b> scope or expenditure exists where additional expenditure leads to a design with a higher financial risk due to the increased cost of the <b>site</b> <b>investigation.</b> The expected savings in terms of financial risk are significant when compared to the increased investigation cost.

40|$|The {{research}} {{presented in}} this thesis focuses on the quantification {{of the effect of}} limited <b>site</b> <b>investigations</b> on the design and performance of pile foundations. Limited <b>site</b> <b>investigation</b> {{is one of the main}} causes of structural foundation failures. Over the last 30 years, most <b>site</b> <b>investigations</b> conducted for infrastructure projects have been dictated by minimum cost and time of completion, rather than meeting the need to appropriately characterise soil properties (Institution of Civil Engineers 1991; Jaksa et al. 2003). As a result, limited <b>site</b> <b>investigations</b> remain common, resulting in a higher risk of structural foundation failure, unforeseen additional construction, and/or repair costs. Also, limited <b>site</b> <b>investigations</b> can result in over-designing foundations, leading to increased and unnecessary cost (ASFE 1996). Based on the reliability examination method for <b>site</b> <b>investigations</b> introduced by Jaksa et al. (2003) and performed by Goldsworthy (2006), this research investigated the effect of limited <b>site</b> <b>investigations</b> on the design of pile foundations. This was achieved by generating three-dimensional random fields to obtain a virtual site consisting of soil properties at certain levels of variability, and by simulating various numbers of cone penetration tests (CPTs) and pile foundations on the generated site. Once the site and the CPTs were simulated, the cone tip resistance (qc) was profiled along the vertical and horizontal axes. The simulated qc profiles yielded by the CPTs were then used to compute axial pile load capacity termed the pile foundation design based on <b>site</b> <b>investigations</b> (SI). In parallel, the axial pile load capacity of the simulated pile foundation utilising the “true” cone tip resistance along the simulated pile was also determined. This is termed “the true” design, or the benchmark pile foundation design, and referred to as pile foundation design based on complete knowledge (CK). At the end of this process, the research compared the pile foundation designs based on SI and those based on CK. The reliability of the foundation design based on SI was analysed with a probabilistic approach, using the Monte Carlo technique. The results indicated that limited <b>site</b> <b>investigations</b> have a significant impact on the design of pile foundations. The results showed that minimum sampling efforts result in a high risk of over- or under-designing piles. More intensive sampling efforts, in contrast, led to a low risk of under- or over-design. The results also indicated that the levels of spatial variability of the soil are notable factors that affect the effectiveness of <b>site</b> <b>investigations.</b> These results will assist geotechnical engineers in planning a <b>site</b> <b>investigation</b> in a more rational manner with knowledge of the associated risks.

The results illustrate a decreasing trend of total foundation cost for an increasing <b>site</b> <b>investigation</b> scope. The results also show that the cost of a foundation, excludin...|$|R

Often, {{the scope of the}} <b>site</b> <b>investigation</b> is dictated by construction time lines and budgetary constraints, rather than on the variability of the ground. It has been shown by a number of authors that as little as 0. 04 % – 0. 3 % of the total construction budget is spent on geotechnical <b>investigations.</b> Limited <b>site</b> <b>investigations</b> have the potential to impact significantly on the success or otherwise of the completed project. These include cost over-runs, construction delays, foundation failure and over-design. It has been suggested that “You pay for a <b>site</b> <b>investigation</b> whether you have one or not. ” This paper examines the influence of limited <b>site</b> <b>investigations</b> on the design and performance of pile foundations with respect to pile load capacity. This is achieved by carrying out 3 D numerical simulations within a Monte Carlo framework using varying numbers of cone penetration tests (CPTs) and the LCPC method for estimating pile load capacities. In this way, it is possible to determine the probabilities of design failure and pile over-design for a variety of <b>site</b> <b>investigation</b> scenarios represented by various numbers of the CPTs and levels of ground variability. It is observed, as expected, that the probability of pile foundation design failure and over-design decreases as the number of CPTs increases. It is also identified that after a certain number of CPTs, little benefit is derived from additional soundings. A. Arsyad, M. B. Jaksa, G. A. Fenton, W. S. Kaggw...|$|R
