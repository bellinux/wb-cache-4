40|$|Several {{recent studies}} have shown that {{speakers}} with <b>severe</b> <b>dysarthria</b> can make use of prosody to communicate intentions. Patel and Salata (2006) investigated the abilities of five children with <b>severe</b> <b>dysarthria</b> to convey three pitch levels and three duration lengths to their caregivers, using an interactive computer game. In this extension study, four Cantonese-speaking children with <b>severe</b> <b>dysarthria</b> were asked to produce five durations and five pitch levels. Rising and falling pitch levels were included to simulate the rising and falling lexical tones of Cantonese. Acoustic analysis was performed for all productions to determine the relationship between acoustic cues and listener perception. There was substantial interparticipant and intraparticipant variability in the children's productions and in caregiver accuracy. However, accuracy was above chance level for a number of prosodic targets for each speaker. Some of the perceptual responses could be easily explained by the acoustic data, where clear distinctions were apparent. However, in other cases there was much overlap in the acoustic signal, suggesting that listeners were employing additional cues. The results of this study strengthen previous findings that prosody can be used reliably by speakers with <b>severe</b> <b>dysarthria</b> to communicate with familiar partners. Further cross-linguistic studies would be informative. Copyright © 2008 Delmar Cengage Learning. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: This paper {{examined}} {{the production of}} intonation patterns in children with developmental dysarthria associated with cerebral palsy (CP) prior to and after speech intervention focussing on respiration and phonation. The study further sought to establish whether intonation performance {{might be related to}} changes in speech intelligibility. Method: Intonation patterns were examined using connected speech samples of 15 older children with moderate to <b>severe</b> developmental <b>dysarthria</b> due to CP (9 females; age range: 11 - 18).

40|$|Background: A {{comparative}} study of treatment modalities for improving articulation in a 13 -year-old child with <b>severe</b> spastic <b>dysarthria</b> associated with spastic cerebral palsy (SCP) was conducted. Method: A multiple treatment design examined the effect of phonetic placement therapy (PPT) and sEMG-facilitated biofeedback relaxation therapy over a 6 -week period. Treatment outcomes were measured using acoustic and perceptual analysis. Results: Results revealed significant improvement in single word intelligibility following PPT with the improvements maintained following sEMG treatment. sEMG-facilitated biofeedback relaxation treatment indicated the occurrence of a pre-cursor skill in increased motor control. Intelligibility at paragraph or sentence level did not change following either treatment. Perceptually, there was no change to any parameters of articulation following either treatment. However, subtle changes were observed on acoustic analysis. Functionally, the participant reported no changes to feelings of well-being or distress regarding her speech disorder over the period of intervention. Conclusions: Clinically, the PPT and sEMG treatments demonstrated improvement in single word articulation, despite no perceptible changes to overall intelligibility. It {{is likely that the}} severity of the participant’s dysarthria was a factor in the minimal changes observed following treatment.

40|$|Background and Purpose: Following our {{treatment}} of a patient with hypoglycemia-induced brain stem symptoms, we examined the possible mechanisms for hypoglycemia presenting as basilar artery disease. Case Description: We describe a patient who had progressive brain stem symptoms due to a diet-induced hypoglycemia initially diagnosed as basilar artery thrombosis. Symptoms ceased immediately after intravenous glucose. Conclusions: Before invasive diagnostic and thrombolytic strategies are considered, hypogly-cemia as a rare but important cause of acute brain stem dysfunction {{must be considered in}} patients suspected to suffer from basilar artery thrombosis.

He presents mental retardation, axial hypotonia, hypertonia of arms and legs, paroxysmal dyskinesias, seizures. The endocrine phenotype showed low serum total and free thyroxine (T 4), very elevated total and free triiodothyronine (T 3) and normal thyrotropin (TSH) with blunted response to thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH). The latter finding was unexpected and suggested that the lack of functional MCT 8 was counterbalanced at the thyrotrope cell level by high serum T 3 concentration and/or by increased intrapituitary type 2 deiodinase (D 2) activity. Our case constitutes a relevant contribution to better characterize this disorder and to elucidate the functional consequences of SLC 16 A 2 gene mutations...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} {{whether there is a}} relationship between inflammatorymarkers (serumC-reactive protein (CRP) and cyto-kines) and post stroke cognitive impairment (PSCI). Methods: Thiswas a cross-sectional observational study. Patientswere recruited from 4 sources: (1) the acute stroke unit of a general hospital, (2) an outpatient stroke prevention clinic, (3) a stroke rehabilitation unit in a specialized geriatric hospital, or (4) a stroke rehabilitation unit of a rehabilitation hospital. Patients meeting National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke (NINCDS) and World Health Organization Multinational Monitoring of Trends and Determinants in Cardiovascular Disease (WHO-MONICA) project criteria for stroke were invited to participate in this studywithin the first 5 to 31 dayspost stroke. Patientswith subarachnoidor intracranial hemorrhage, decreased level of consciousness, <b>severe</b> aphasia or <b>dysarthria,</b> or a significant acute medical, neurological, or psychiatric illness were excluded. Clinical assessments included the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) for cognition, the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) for stroke severity, and the Center for Epidemiological StudiesDepression Scale (CES-D) for depressive symptoms. Enzyme-linked immuno-sorbent assay (ELISA) was used to measure serum concentrations of CRP, interleukin 6 (IL- 6), and interferon g (IFN-g). Results: A total of 48 patients with ischemic stroke (age [mean+ SD] 71. 6 + 13. 2 years, 54. 2 %male, MMSE 26. 4 + 3. 8, NIHSS 6. 8 + 4. 0) were recruited within their first month post stroke. Backward stepwise elimination linear regression showed that higher concentrations of serumCRP (bCRP 0. 46, pCRP 0. 002) predicted lower post stroke global cognition ([MMSE], F 1, 44 11. 31, P. 002), with age (...|$|R
40|$|Wilson disease (WD) {{is a rare}} genetic {{disorder}} characterized by copper overload in the liver and the brain. Neurological presentations are mainly related to the accumulation of copper in the basal ganglia, the brainstem, and the cerebellum. Dysarthria is a frequent symptom, with dystonic, spastic, or parkinsonian components and is usually resistant to medical or voice rehabilitation therapies. Here, we report {{the case of a}} patient with WD diagnosed at the age of 12, who presented a <b>severe</b> and constant <b>dysarthria</b> from dystonic origin which was unresponsive to benzodiazepines and anticholinergic drugs. When she was 25 -year-old, she tried zolpidem at bedtime for sleeping difficulties and reported a paradoxical effect of this drug on her voice. To confirm the effect of zolpidem on her dystonic dysarthria, we realized a full evaluation of her dysarthria at baseline without zolpidem and after 4 [*]days of treatment by 10 [*]mg twice a day. Lexical access was evaluated by the semantic fluency; dysarthria by the Intelligibility Score, the spontaneous speech and reading rates, the maximum phonation time on the sustained vowel [a] and by a perceptive evaluation. Two hours after the intake of zolpidem, improvement of all the parameters tested, {{with the exception of the}} maximum phonation time, was observed. Semantic fluency increased by 59 %, the spontaneous speech rate by 88 % and the reading rate by 76 %. General dystonia remained unchanged and the tolerance of zolpidem was satisfactory. Since then, the patient takes zolpidem 5 [*]mg five times a day, and 4 [*]years later shows persistent improvement in oral communication and a good drug tolerance. In this single-case study, we showed that regular daytime intake of zolpidem could have a persisting effect on a complex dystonic dysarthria that was resistant to usual medical treatments...|$|R
