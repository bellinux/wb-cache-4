500|$|The worst {{cells for}} {{confinement}} as a punishment for inmates who {{stepped out of}} line were located {{at the end of}} D-Block in cells 9–14, known as [...] "The Hole". The cells were devoid of light and colder {{than the rest of the}} prison, and prisoners <b>sent</b> <b>here</b> were regularly stripped, beaten, and tortured and often starved, forced to sleep on the cold concrete floor wearing nothing but light underwear. In turn, guards were abused, and often had faeces, urine or food thrown at them or were spat at. Inmates held in the hole were limited to just one 10-minute shower and an hour of exercise in the yard a week. The five cells of [...] "The Hole" [...] had nothing but a sink and toilet and the very worst cell was nicknamed [...] "The Oriental" [...] or [...] "Strip Cell", the final cell of the block with nothing but a hole in the floor as a toilet, in which prisoners would often be confined naked with nothing else for two days. The guards controlled the flushing of the toilet in that cell. A hatchway in the floor on D-Block also led to the dungeon in the basement which contained several cells. The worst behaved inmates would be locked inside their cells in the dungeon, chained to the walls. They were given a meager diet of bread and water each day, and one regular meal every three days, although the quantity and duration often varied relative to the extent of the punishment. Denied of proper toilet facilities, they were given a bucket as a toilet, emptied once a week, and stripped and chained to the wall standing at nights; according to Alvin J. Esau, prisoners in solitary confinement were [...] "placed on a starvation diet and made to stand nine hours each day with hands tied and their feet barely touching the floor." [...] After completing the punishment in the hole, the prisoner could then return to his cell but be tagged; a red tag, third grade, denoted a prisoner who was restricted from leaving his cell for perhaps 3 months. At second grade the prisoners could receive letters, and if after 30 days they remained behaved, they would then be restored full prison privileges.|$|E

Inmates exercise in a concrete pit resembling an empty swimming pool, also designed {{to prevent them from}} knowing their location in the facility. The pit is only large enough for a prisoner to walk 10 steps in a straight line, or 31 steps in a circle. Telecommunication with the outside world is forbidden, and food is hand-delivered by correction officers. However, inmates <b>sent</b> <b>here</b> from other prisons can potentially be allowed to eat in a shared dining room.

The sermon caused a national controversy, as some incorrectly interpreted Lord's view as being that the government can essentially make legal any sinful action legal or mandatory, including murder and theft, among others. He was called a Judas and a Benedict Arnold, although the controversy simmered out fairly quickly as his true views became clarified.
