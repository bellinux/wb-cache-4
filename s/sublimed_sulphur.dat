6000|$|... 433. The {{substance}} presenting {{this effect}} is sulphuret of silver. It was made by fusing a mixture of precipitated silver and <b>sublimed</b> <b>sulphur,</b> removing the film of silver by a file from {{the exterior of the}} fused mass, pulverizing the sulphuret, mingling it with more sulphur, and fusing it again in a green glass tube, so that no air should obtain access during the process. The surface of the sulphuret being again removed by a file or knife, it was considered quite free from uncombined silver.|$|E
6000|$|... 547. In {{support of}} these arguments, {{it may be}} observed, that as yet no {{determination}} of a substance to a pole, or tendency to obey the electric current, has been observed (that I am aware of,) in cases of mere mixture; i.e. a substance diffused through a fluid, but having no sensible chemical affinity with it, or with substances that may be evolved from it during the action, does not in any case seem {{to be affected by}} the electric current. Pulverised charcoal was diffused through dilute sulphuric acid, and subjected with the solution to the action of a voltaic battery, terminated by platina poles; but not the slightest tendency of the charcoal to the negative pole could be observed, <b>Sublimed</b> <b>sulphur</b> was diffused through similar acid, and submitted to the same action, a silver plate being used as the negative pole; but the sulphur had no tendency to pass to that pole, the silver was not tarnished, nor did any sulphuretted hydrogen appear. The case of magnesia and water (495. 533.), with those of comminuted metals in certain solutions (546.), are also of this kind; and, in fact, substances which have the instant before been powerfully determined towards the pole, as magnesia from sulphate of magnesia, become entirely indifferent to it the moment they assume their independent state, and pass away, diffusing themselves through the surrounding fluid.|$|E
40|$|A {{standardized}} skin surface biopsy {{was performed}} in 34 patients suffering from skin diseases with high Demodex folliculorum density (Dd) > 5 D/cm 2 before, during and after topical treatment. The patients were randomized into six comparable groups to study six topical treatments metronidazole 2 %, permethrin 1 %, <b>sublimed</b> <b>sulphur</b> 10 %, lindane 1 %, crotamiton 10 % and benzyl benzoate (BB) 10 %. Their acaricidal activity was measured according to three criteria: (i) for each treatment, decrease of Dd to under the normal threshold (â‰¤ 5 D/cm 2); (ii) for each treatment, {{a significant decrease in}} Dd: and (iii) comparison of the relative difference in Dd between treatments. These three criteria converged to establish the acaricidal activity of BB on D folliculorum: the efficacy of crotamiton was demonstrated by the second criterion. An important irritating effect was observed wit BB and sulphur. SCOPUS: ar. jFLWINinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
