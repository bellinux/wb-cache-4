40|$|To create {{functional}} surfaces for soft materials, such as polyurethanes, {{our approach}} {{is to use a}} semifluorinated <b>surface</b> <b>modifier</b> as minor component to the matrix material. The <b>surface</b> <b>modifier,</b> driving by reduction in surface energy, surface-concentrates to form a functionalized surface layer at the air-polymer interface. In our previous studies, linear PTMO-based polyurethanes were used as the matrix material. These systems undergo slow surface phase separation at room temperature due to the thermodynamically immiscibility of the soft blocks. In this study, chemically crosslinked matrix was developed to provides a steric hindrance to constrain the mobility of <b>surface</b> <b>modifier</b> and to form a kinetically stable surface. The physical property and morphology of base crosslinked matrix has been characterized using DSC, UTT, DMA and AFM.

40|$|In this paper, three {{recycled}} coarse aggregates (RCAs) {{with different}} 24 -h water absorptions (5. 67, 3. 12, and 1. 98 wt%) {{were used to}} produce recycled coarse aggregate concretes (RCACs). Different water absorption rates were obtained by modifying the surface of RCAs with low and high concentration of alkaline organosilicone modifier that is stable in concrete. A normal aggregate concrete mixture was also prepared to serve as control mixture. The effect of RCA absorption on the microstructure (interfacial transition zone), mechanical properties (compressive strength, modulus of elasticity, and concrete-rebar bonding strength), and durability (shrinkage and water permeability) of the resulting RCAC was investigated. Test {{results showed that the}} surface modification of RCA was effective in reducing the water absorption. From micrographs, RCAC prepared with low concentration of <b>surface</b> <b>modifier</b> (No. 2 RCA) showed mechanical interlocking with the surrounding cement matrix. Among RCAC, No. 2 RCA (with low concentration of <b>surface</b> <b>modifier)</b> showed better mechanical and durability performance due to the mechanical interlocking which served as effective force transmission medium between aggregate/cement matrix. It can therefore be concluded that RCA prepared with low concentration of <b>surface</b> <b>modifier</b> improved the properties of RCAC. In addition, it may be used as a potential tool to reduce possible slump loss in fresh concrete thereby resulting in consistent mix and providing greater flexibility in mix design...|$|E
40|$|This {{theoretical}} {{study examines}} the adhesion of amorphous carbon to functionalized polyester surfaces. Several {{modifications to the}} polyester surface have been investigated including the addition of hydroxyl, carboxyl, or fluorine substiments at varying surface concentrations. Initially, the polyesters were artificially held rigid, and the surface modification not only imparted chemical changes to the polymer surface but also accentuated its atomic scale roughness. Under this rigid regime, low concentrations of <b>surface</b> <b>modifiers</b> {{have been shown to}} lead to the greatest reduction in adhesion with amorphous carbon, and increasing the level of modification does not provide further advantages in the reduction of adhesion, due to saturation. The effects of surface reorganization were also investigated and {{have been shown to be}} strongly dependent on the structure of the carbon surface, the chemical type, and <b>surface</b> density of <b>modifiers.</b> The <b>surface</b> <b>modifiers</b> reorganize during relaxation, which leads to significant differences in their effects on adhesion...|$|R

Thermal behavior of the powder was investigated by thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential thermal analysis (DTA). High Resolution Transmission Microscopy (HRTEM) reveals that the particle size is around 22 nm. Chemical microanalysis of europium doped yttria was made by energy dispersive spectrum analyzer (EDS) attached along with HRTEM and indicated a Y/Eu atomic ratio 2. 1.

40|$|There {{are various}} {{techniques}} for synthesizing different Nanoparticles {{depending upon the}} desired properties, application, etc. One of these widely applied techniques is Hydrothermal. However, this technique is known for bulky materials and fabrication of nano-scale materials requires adopting some strategies to alter the properties of materials synthesized. We developed surface modification for this drawback. Application of <b>surface</b> <b>modifier,</b> or surfactant, or capping agent, or organic ligands in proper concentration could not only change morphology, reduce particle size, but also change the surface chemistry of the nanoparticles fabricated. The ZnO and TiO 2 nanoparticles were modified using n-butylamine and caprylic acid as <b>surface</b> <b>modifier</b> under mild hydrothermal conditions (p= autogenous, T= 150 - 250 °C, and t= 18 h). The nanoparticles modified were systematically characterized using Powder XRD, FTIR, SEM, zeta potential, and BET surface area.

40|$|Carbon {{nanostructures}} (CNSs) such as carbon nanotubes, graphene sheets, and nanodiamonds {{provide an}} important type of substrate for constructing {{a variety of}} hybrid nanomaterials. However, their intrinsic chemistry-inert surfaces make it indispensable to pre-functionalize them prior to immobilizing additional components onto their surfaces. Currently developed strategies for functionalizing CNSs include covalent and non-covalent approaches. Conventional covalent treatments often damage the structure integrity of carbon surfaces and adversely affect their physical properties. In contrast, the non-covalent approach offers a non-destructive way to modify CNSs with desired functional surfaces, while reserving their intrinsic properties. Thus far, a number of <b>surface</b> <b>modifiers</b> including aromatic compounds, small-molecular surfactants, amphiphilic polymers, and biomacromolecules {{have been developed to}} non-covalently functionalize CNS surfaces. Mediated by these <b>surface</b> <b>modifiers,</b> various functional components such as organic species and inorganic nanoparticles were further decorated onto their surfaces, resulting in versatile carbon-based hybrid nanomaterials with broad applications in chemical engineering and biomedical areas.

Thermal analyses indicated that silane treatment and 2 - 6 mass% zeolite addition have no {{significant effect on the}} melting and degradation temperatures of the composites.
