40|$|SummaryThe {{development}} of {{safe and effective}} drugs relies on the discovery of <b>selective</b> <b>ligands.</b> Serotonin (5 -hydroxytryptamine [5 -HT]) G protein-coupled receptors are therapeutic targets for CNS disorders but are also associated with adverse drug effects. The determination of crystal structures for the 5 -HT 1 B and 5 -HT 2 B receptors provided an opportunity to identify subtype <b>selective</b> <b>ligands</b> using structure-based methods. From docking screens of 1. 3 million compounds, 22 molecules were predicted to be selective for the 5 -HT 1 B receptor over the 5 -HT 2 B subtype, a requirement for safe serotonergic drugs. Nine compounds were experimentally verified as 5 -HT 1 B-selective ligands, with up to 300 -fold higher affinities for this subtype. Three of the ligands were agonists of the G protein pathway. Analysis of state-of-the-art homology models of the two 5 -HT receptors revealed that the crystal structures were critical for predicting <b>selective</b> <b>ligands.</b> Our results demonstrate that structure-based screening can guide the discovery of ligands with specific selectivity profiles...|$|R
50|$|As of 2009, few highly <b>selective</b> 5-HT2B {{receptor}} <b>ligands</b> {{have been}} discovered, although numerous potent non-selective compounds are known, particularly agents with concomitant 5-HT2C binding.

50|$|Until {{comparatively}} recently, {{there were}} few pharmacological tools {{for the study of}} δ receptors.

40|$|Vasoactive Intestinal Polypeptide (VIP) {{interacts with}} a high {{affinity}} to two subclasses of G protein coupled receptors named VPAC 1 and VPAC 2, and has a 3 – 10 fold preference for VPAC 1 over VPAC 2 receptors. <b>Selective</b> <b>ligands</b> for each receptor subclass were recently described. [R 16]-PACAP (1 – 23) and [L 22]-VIP are two selective VPAC 1 agonists. Chimaeric human VPAC 2 -VPAC 1 recombinant receptors expressed in CHO cells were used to identify the receptor domains implicated in these two <b>selective</b> <b>ligands</b> recognition. The VPAC 2 preference for [R 16]-PACAP (1 – 27) over [R 16]-PACAP (1 – 23) did not require the receptor's NH 2 -terminus domain but involved the whole transmembrane domain. In contrast, the selectivity of [L 22]-VIP depended only {{on the presence of}} the NH 2 terminus and EC 2 domains of the VPAC 1 receptor. The present data support the idea that in the GPCR-B family of receptors the different <b>selective</b> <b>ligands</b> require different domains for their selectivity, and that the peptides carboxyl terminal sequence (amino acids 24 – 27) folds back on the transmembrane receptor domain, close to the peptides, aminoterminus...|$|R

50|$|Asoprisnil ecamate (INN) (developmental {{code name}} J-956) is a synthetic, steroidal {{selective}} progesterone receptor modulator (SPRM) which was under {{development for the}} treatment of endometriosis, uterine fibroids, and menopausal symptoms but was discontinued. It is a potent and highly <b>selective</b> <b>ligand</b> of the progesterone receptor (PR) with mixed agonistic and antagonstic activity and much reduced antiglucocorticoid activity relative to mifepristone.

50|$|Homoquinolinic acid (HQA) is {{a potent}} excitotoxin which is a conformationally-restricted {{analogue}} of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and a partial agonist of the main/glutamate site of the NMDA receptor, with some selectivity for NR2B subunit-containing receptors. It is approximately equipotent to NMDA and about five times more potent than quinolinic acid as an agonist of the NMDA receptor. HQA has also been found to label a novel, yet uncharacterized binding site, which can be distinguished from the NMDA receptor {{with the use of}} 2-carboxy-3-carboxymethylquinoline (CCMQ), a <b>selective</b> <b>ligand</b> of the uncharacterized site.|$|E
5000|$|... 3-Methoxyphencyclidine (3-MeO-PCP) is a dissociative {{anesthetic}} {{drug that}} has been sold online as a designer drug. The compound was first synthesized in 1979 to investigate the structure-activity relationship of phencyclidine derivatives. The activity of 3-MeO-PCP in humans was not described until 1999 when a chemist using the pseudonym John Q. Beagle wrote that 3-MeO-PCP was qualitatively similar to PCP with comparable potency. 3-MeO-PCP binds to the NMDA receptor with higher affinity than PCP and has the highest affinity of the three isomeric anisyl-substitutions, followed by 2-MeO-PCP and 4-MeO-PCP. Though 3-MeO-PCP {{is often described as}} having opioid or dopaminergic activity, this supposition is contradicted by data showing 3-MeO-PCP to be a potent and <b>selective</b> <b>ligand</b> for the NMDA receptor without appreciable affinity for the µ-opioid receptor or dopamine transporter. 3-MeO-PCP was preceded by the less potent dissociative 4-MeO-PCP and first became available as a research chemical in 2011.|$|E
40|$|The FK 506 -binding protein 51 (FICBP 51) is a {{promising}} drug {{target for the}} treatment of stress-related psychiatric or metabolic disorders. Just recently, the first <b>selective</b> <b>ligands</b> for FKBP 51 were reported based on an induced fit mechanism, but they are too large for a further drug development process. We therefore designed and synthesized a novel series of <b>selective</b> <b>ligands</b> to explore the requirements necessary for binding to the induced-fit conformation. All ligands of this series show no binding toward the structurally very similar antitarget FKBP 52. With the cocrystal structure of the best ligand in this novel series we confirmed the induced fit mechanism. Furthermore, the structure affinity relationship provides information about beneficial structural features, which is valuable for the development of improved FKBP 51 -directed drugs...|$|R
40|$|The cloning {{of brain}} melanocortin (MC) receptors, the mapping of their {{expression}} pattern and {{the identification of}} MC receptor <b>selective</b> <b>ligands</b> have opened a new avenue towards elucidating {{the role of the}} melanocortin system in the brain. MC receptors have now been implicated in melanocortin-induced grooming behavior in rats, in the melanocortin-induced lowering of blood pressure and in the control of weight homeostasis. Functional opioid antagonism and the anti-pyretic and anti-inflammatory effects of melanocortins are probably also mediated via MC receptors. However, the effects of melanocortins on avoidance behavior and the effect of 2 -MSH on increasing blood pressure are not mediated via one of the cloned brain MC receptors. The structure of brain MC receptors, their expression pattern, the MC receptor <b>selective</b> <b>ligands</b> and the function of MC receptors are briefly reviewed...|$|R
5000|$|A useful {{property}} of the many benzodiazepine site allosteric modulators is that they may display selective binding to particular subsets of receptors comprising specific subunits. This allows one to determine which GABAA receptor subunit combinations are prevalent in particular brain areas and provides {{a clue as to}} which subunit combinations may be responsible for behavioral effects of drugs acting at GABAA receptors. These <b>selective</b> <b>ligands</b> may have pharmacological advantages in that they may allow dissociation of desired therapeutic effects from undesirable side effects. Few subtype <b>selective</b> <b>ligands</b> have gone into clinical use as yet, with the exception of zolpidem which is reasonably selective for α1, but several more selective compounds are in development such as the α3-selective drug adipiplon. There are many examples of subtype-selective compounds which are widely used in scientific research, including: ...|$|R
50|$|Acetothiolutamide is a {{selective}} androgen receptor modulator (SARM) {{derived from the}} nonsteroidal antiandrogen bicalutamide that was described in 2002 {{and was one of}} the first SARMs to be discovered and developed. It is a high-affinity, <b>selective</b> <b>ligand</b> of the androgen receptor (AR) (Ki = 2.1-4.9 nM), where it acts as a full agonist in vitro, and has in vitro potency comparable to that of testosterone. However, in vivo, acetothiolutamide displayed overall negligible androgenic effects, though significant (albeit very low) anabolic effects were observed at high doses. In addition, notable antiandrogen effects were observed in castrated male rats treated with testosterone propionate. The discrepancy between the in vitro and in vivo actions of acetothiolutamide was determined to be related to rapid plasma clearance and extensive hepatic metabolism into a variety of metabolites with differing pharmacological activity, including AR partial agonism and antagonism. In accordance with its poor metabolic stability, acetothiolutamide is not orally bioavailable, and shows activity only via injected routes such as subcutaneous and intravenous.|$|E
50|$|Rosiglitazone is {{a member}} of the thiazolidinedione class of drugs. Thiazolidinediones act as insulin sensitizers. They reduce glucose, fatty acid, and insulin blood concentrations. They work by binding to the {{peroxisome}} proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs). PPARs are transcription factors that reside in the nucleus and become activated by ligands such as thiazolidinediones. Thiazolidinediones enter the cell, bind to the nuclear receptors, and alter the expression of genes. The several PPARs include PPARα, PPARβ/δ, and PPARγ. Thiazolidinediones bind to PPARγ. PPARs are expressed in fat cells, cells of the liver, muscle, heart, and inner wall (endothelium) and smooth muscle of blood vessels. PPARγ is expressed mainly in fat tissue, where it regulates genes involved in fat cell (adipocyte) differentiation, fatty acid uptake and storage, and glucose uptake. It is also found in pancreatic beta cells, vascular endothelium, and macrophages Rosiglitazone is a <b>selective</b> <b>ligand</b> of PPARγ and has no PPARα-binding action. Other drugs bind to PPARα.|$|E
5000|$|Tamoxifen {{is known}} to bind {{not only to the}} ER but also to non-ER {{so-called}} [...] "antiestrogen binding sites" [...] (AEBS) that are present in cell microsomes as opposed to the cell nucleus. Tesmilifene was developed as a <b>selective</b> <b>ligand</b> of the AEBS without ER affinity to investigate these sites and their role in the antineoplastic activity of tamoxifen. Histamine {{has been found to be}} a ligand of the AEBS, and it has been determined that the AEBS represent the substrate binding site of certain microsomal cytochrome P450 enzymes including CYP3A4, CYP2D6, and CYP1A1. Tesmilifene binds to and displaces histamine from these sites equipotently to tamoxifen and more strongly than conventional antihistamines, and this action has been found to correlate with the cytotoxic effects of tesmilifene in breast cancer cells in vitro. Moreover, in spite of its lack of affinity for the ER, tesmilifene antagonizes the uterotrophic effects of exogenous estrogen in vivo.|$|E
