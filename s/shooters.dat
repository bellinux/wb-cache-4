5|$|Tube <b>shooters</b> feature craft {{flying through}} an {{abstract}} tube. Technically, most tube <b>shooters</b> are also fixed <b>shooters,</b> because the player is still constrained to left/right movement, but it's mapped {{to the shape}} of the tube.|$|E
5|$|First-person <b>shooters</b> are {{a type of}} {{three-dimensional}} shooter game, {{featuring a}} first-person point of view with which the player sees the action {{through the eyes of}} the player character. They are unlike third-person <b>shooters,</b> in which the player can see (usually from behind) the character they are controlling. The primary design element is combat, mainly involving firearms.|$|E
5000|$|If {{there are}} several players, the {{rotation}} of the player who must cover the <b>shooter</b> may change with the <b>shooter</b> (comparable to a blind in poker). The person covering the <b>shooter</b> will always bet against the <b>shooter.</b> For example, if the <b>shooter</b> made a [...] "Pass" [...] bet, the person covering the <b>shooter</b> would make a [...] "Don't Pass" [...] bet to win. Once the <b>shooter</b> is covered, other players may make Pass/Don't Pass bets, or any other proposition bets, {{as long as there is}} another player willing to cover.|$|R

5|$|Targets {{in light}} gun <b>shooters</b> may be {{threatening}} antagonists such as criminals, terrorists or zombies, {{or they may}} be inanimate objects such as apples or bottles. Although these games may be played without a light gun, the use of more conventional input methods has been deemed inferior. Light gun <b>shooters</b> typically feature generic action or horror themes, though some later games employ more humorous, self-referential styles.|$|E

5|$|Howard {{arranges}} a {{game with}} wealthy William Jefferson Slade, who secures <b>Shooter's</b> services as dealer. Howard wins $6,000 from Slade over a 30-hour game, angering Slade and wounding his pride. That night at Slade's home, he tries to bribe <b>Shooter</b> into cheating in the Kid's favor when the two players meet. <b>Shooter</b> declines, but Slade calls in <b>Shooter's</b> markers worth $12,000, and blackmails him by threatening to reveal damaging information about <b>Shooter's</b> wild wife, Melba. <b>Shooter</b> agonizes over his decision, having spent the last 25 years building a reputation for integrity.|$|R
5|$|Though not {{the first}} of its kind, Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six started a popular trend of {{tactical}} first-person <b>shooters</b> in 1998. It featured a team-based, realistic design and themes based around counter-terrorism, requiring missions to be planned before execution and in it, a single hit was sometimes enough to kill a character. Medal of Honor, released in 1999, started a long running proliferation of first-person <b>shooters</b> set during World War II.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, Defender {{established}} scrolling in shoot 'em ups, offering horizontally extended levels. Unlike most later {{games in}} the genre, the player could move in either direction. The game's use of scrolling helped remove design limitations associated with the screen, and though the game's minimap feature had been introduced before, Defender integrated it into the gameplay in a more essential manner. Konami's Scramble, released in 1981, is a side-scrolling shooter with forced scrolling. It was the first scrolling shooter to offer multiple, distinct levels. Atari's Tempest, released in 1981, {{is one of the}} earliest tube <b>shooters</b> and an early attempt to incorporate a 3D perspective into shooter games. Tempest ultimately went on to influence major rail <b>shooters.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 2004, the SS192 hollow-point {{cartridge}} {{was introduced}} to civilian <b>shooters</b> alongside the new IOM variant of the Five-seven pistol. After being met with controversy, the SS192 variety was discontinued in the same year, and in 2005 the SS196SR variety was introduced using a 2.6 g (40grain) Hornady V-Max projectile. The SS196 was also quickly discontinued {{in favor of the}} newer SS195LF and SS197SR varieties, which are currently offered to civilian <b>shooters</b> for use in 5.7Ã—28mm firearms, followed by the SS198LF variety, which is currently produced but is restricted by FN to military and law enforcement customers.|$|E
50|$|If {{a single}} bullet is used, the probabilities of hitting the target are equal and {{deliberate}} missing is allowed, {{the best strategy}} for the first <b>shooter</b> is to deliberately miss. Since he is now disarmed, the next <b>shooter</b> will {{have no reason to}} shoot the first one and so will shoot at the third <b>shooter.</b> While the second <b>shooter</b> might miss deliberately, there would then be the risk that the third one would shoot him. If the first <b>shooter</b> does not deliberately miss, he will presumably be shot by whichever <b>shooter</b> remained.|$|R

5000|$|When {{he comes}} to the line, the <b>shooter</b> will place his guns as {{required}} by the stage description. When the competitor steps to the start position, the Range Officer conducting the stage will ask if the <b>shooter</b> understands the course of fire and clarify any questions the <b>shooter</b> may have. The Range Officer will ask if the <b>shooter</b> is ready, will tell the <b>shooter</b> to [...] "Stand By", and will start the timer within 2 to 5 seconds. When started, the timer gives an audible electronic tone and the <b>shooter</b> will begin the stage.|$|R
5|$|Miles wears {{a costume}} {{given to him}} by S.H.I.E.L.D., and {{initially}} uses Peter Parker's web <b>shooters,</b> which are {{given to him by}} May Parker. He is eventually given a new set of webshooters by S.H.I.E.L.D. as well.|$|E
5|$|Unusually for a revolver, the Webley-Fosbery had {{a safety}} catch, {{and the light}} trigger pull, solid design, and {{reputation}} for accuracy ensured that the Webley-Fosbery remained popular with target <b>shooters</b> long after production had finished.|$|E
5|$|Further {{development}} of the P90 {{led to the creation}} of the P90 TR model, which has a MIL-STD-1913 triple rail interface for mounting accessories. This model was introduced in late 1999 and continues to be offered alongside the standard P90. More recently, the P90 has been offered to civilian <b>shooters</b> as the PS90, a semi-automatic carbine intended for personal protection and sporting use.|$|E

5|$|It is each shooter's {{responsibility}} {{to get the}} pistol and shoes validated in a specific area, the equipment control, prior to starting the competition. Clothing is only inspected during the actual competition. To discourage <b>shooters</b> from lowering the trigger pull weight after passing the equipment control, random controls are conducted after the match with failure resulting in immediate disqualification.|$|E
5|$|Like most shooter games, first-person <b>shooters</b> involve an avatar, {{one or more}} ranged weapons, and a varying {{number of}} enemies. Because they {{take place in a}} 3D environment, these games tend to be {{somewhat}} more realistic than 2D shooter games, and have more accurate representations of gravity, lighting, sound and collisions. First-person <b>shooters</b> played on personal computers are most often controlled with a combination of a keyboard and mouse. This system has been claimed as superior to that found in console games, which frequently use two analog sticks: one used for running and sidestepping, the other for looking and aiming. It is common to display the character's hands and weaponry in the main view, with a head-up display showing health, ammunition and location details. Often, it is possible to overlay a map of the surrounding area.|$|E

5|$|On release Iridion {{garnered}} generally poor reviews. The {{graphics and}} sound were generally praised; {{even a year}} after its release, critics at TechTV considered it the best-looking game on the platform. In contrast, critics derided the game's repetitive and frustrating gameplay. Despite lukewarm reception to the title upon release, Iridion 3D influenced future Shin'en <b>shooters</b> such as Iridion II and Nanostray.|$|E
5|$|People {{relive the}} Wild West both {{historically}} and {{in popular culture}} by participating in cowboy action shooting events, where each gunslinger adopts {{his or her own}} look representing a character from Western life in the late 1800s, and as part of that character, chooses an alias to go by. The sport originated in Southern California, USA, in the early 1980s but is now practiced in many places with several sanctioning organizations including the Single Action Shooting Society (SASS), Western Action Shootists Association (WASA), and National Congress of Old West <b>Shooters</b> (NCOWS), as well as others in the USA and in other countries. There are different categories <b>shooters</b> can compete in. There's the gunfighter, frontiersman, classic cowboy and duelist - each with its own specifications.|$|E
