40|$|The CFD codes {{which can}} be used in {{industrial}} applications are discussed, and it is emphasized that the industrial codes will have to be chosen consistent with the phase of the design. In this paper, a hierarchy of fluid-flow models, in decreasing order of complexity, is obtained by simplifications to the Navier-Stokes (N-S) equations resulting progressively through the neglect of viscosity, rotationality, time-dependence, or less-dominant terms or through linearization or <b>simplification</b> <b>of</b> <b>boundary</b> conditions. The paper highlights the utility of a hierarchy of fluid-flow models and the resulting computer codes in arriving at design information appropriate to different phases of development of aerospace vehicles. Several applications of a possible hierarchy of approximations of N-S equations to practical problems are illustrated based on work carried out at the National Aeronautical Laborator...|$|R
40|$|The Conceptual Aircraft Hinge Moment Measurement System (CAHMMS) was designed, prototyped, and {{validated}} {{to improve}} hinge moment estimates {{early in the}} design process. Validation was performed by integrating CAHMMS with a test wing and conducting wind tunnel tests to compare the expected theoretical, historical, and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) predictions to the experimental results. As CAHMMS is an external measurement system, interference effects at the connection points were investigated. Further studies were undertaken to verify the CFD predictions with the experimental hinge moment measurements. Hinge moment results from the experimental data and the theoretical data closely correlated with less than 5 % difference, validating the CAHMMS design. Over <b>simplification</b> <b>of</b> <b>boundary</b> layer modeling and mesh generating techniques are attributed to the poor correlation of the analytical data. Understanding of the CAHMMS system and its interactions with the test surface can be further determined through finer mesh generation and more precise boundary layer modeling using the CFD analytical technique...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposed}} a practical method for building detection and extraction using airborne laser scanning data. The proposed method consists mainly of two processes: {{low and high}} level processes. The major distinction from the previous approaches is that we introduce a concept of pseudo-grid (or binning) into raw laser scanning data to avoid the loss of information and accuracy due to interpolation {{as well as to}} define the adjacency of neighboring laser point data and to speed up the processing time. The approach begins with pseudo-grid generation, noise removal, segmentation, grouping for building detection, linearization and <b>simplification</b> <b>of</b> building <b>boundary,</b> and building extraction in 3 D vector format. To achieve the efficient processing, each step changes the domain of input data such as point and pseudo-grid accordingly. The experimental results show that the proposed method is promising. 1...|$|R

40|$|A {{number of}} {{questions}} remain concerning homogeneous aerosol formation by natural organics interacting with anthropogenic pollutants. For example, chlorine has been proposed as a potential oxidant in the troposphere because of its very high reactivity {{with a wide range}} of organics (Finlayson-Pitts, 1993). Indeed, sea salt aerosol in the presence of ozone has been shown to produce chlorine atoms in heterogeneous photochemical reactions under laboratory conditions. Whether chlorine can initiate oxidation of natural organics such as monoterpene hydrocarbons and can generate homogeneous nucleation or condensable material that contributes to aerosol loadings needs to be assessed. The nighttime reactions of ozone and nitrate radical can also result in monoterpene reactions that contribute to aerosol mass. We are currently planning field studies in Puerto Rico to assess these aerosol issues and other atmospheric chemistry questions. Puerto Rico has a number of key features that make it very attractive for a field study of this sort. The principal feature is the island's very regular meteorology and its position in the Caribbean Sea relative to the easterly trade winds. This meteorology and the island's rectangular shape (100 x 35 miles) make it highly suitable for <b>simplification</b> <b>of</b> <b>boundary</b> layer conditions. In addition, the long stretch between Puerto Rico and the nearest pollution sources in Africa and southern Europe make the incoming background air relatively clean and constant. Furthermore, Puerto Rico has approximately 3. 5 million people with a very well defined source region and a central area of rain forest vegetation. These features make Puerto Rico an ideal locale for assessing aerosol processes. The following sections describe specific areas of atmospheric chemistry that can be explored during the proposed field study...|$|R
40|$|AbstractGiven a set Z of n<∞ {{points in}} the plane and an integer λ⩾ 2, we {{consider}} the problem of finding a λ-Steiner hull of Z, i. e., a region containing every Steiner minimal tree for Z in the λ-metric. We define a λ-Steiner hull λ-SH(Z) of Z as a set obtained by a maximal sequence of removals of certain open wedge-shaped regions from an initial hull followed by a <b>simplification</b> <b>of</b> its <b>boundary.</b> A perhaps surprising result is presented, namely that a Euclidean MST for Z {{can be used to}} decompose the problem of finding λ-SH(Z) into subproblems. Each of these can then be solved recursively using linear searches combined with a sweep line approach. Using this result, we present an algorithm computing λ-SH(Z). This algorithm has O(λnlogn) running time and O(λn) space requirement which is optimal for constant λ. We prove that λ-SH(Z) is independent of the order of removals of the open wedge-shaped regions...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The paper {{presents}} {{results of}} experimental analysis of femur and femur – expandable intramedullary nail system. The {{aim of the}} work was to determine displacement in three models. In addition, the torsion of the system aiming at determining the moments depending on the torsional angle of the bone was carried out. Design/methodology/approach: Three femurs were selected for studies. The analysis was carried out on the femur – expandable intramedullary nail system. The influence of the loads and displacements on the bone – nail system {{on the results of}} experimental analysis was analysed. In order to carry out calculations, three models were selected: model I – bone without fracture gap, model II and III – femur with expansion intramedullary nails – fracture gap was located 100 mm under greater trochanter. The studies were performed on femur models produced by Swedish company Sawbones. The intramedullary „Fixion IM” nails (Ti- 6 Al- 4 V alloy) were implanted into the bone. Displacements of determinated models were being recorded from the sensors every 100 N from 10 N to 2000 N. Findings: The analyses showed the difference in displacements, depending on the selected models. Research limitations/implications: The limitations were connected with <b>simplification</b> <b>of</b> <b>boundary</b> conditions during analysis which were the result <b>of</b> the <b>simplification</b> <b>of</b> the models. While studying, muscles and ligaments supporting the bone in anatomic position were not taken into consideration. Instead, the system has been loaded with the axial force (compression). Practical implications: The obtained results can be useful in clinical practice. They can be applied in selection of stabilization methods or rehabilitation as well as in describing the biomechanical conditions connected with type of bone fracture obtained from medical imaging. Originality/value:. The work compares the values of displacement of characteristic points of femur (healthy – model I) with the femur – expandable intramedullary nail system (models II and III) with the applied force. In order to estimate the value of the torsional angle of the upper part in relation to the lower one depending on the applied force, the torsion of the model was conducted. On this basis, it was indicated a maximum moment in which the nail would not become loose in medullar canal...|$|R
40|$|HPGRs {{have since}} {{introduced}} in the 1980 s (Kellerwessel, 1993; Schönert, 1988), now become integral comminution units at several minerals processing plants around the world. Even though {{a lot of the}} initial issues concerning performance, availability and wear have been addressed and solved there are still phenomena and aspects which can be improved and understood further. Schönert and Sander (2002) presented experimental results and a mechanistic model including the internal force dynamics between the rollers and the compacted bed. They derived expressions for the pressure distribution involving most of the influencing terms and effects. However, in order to solve the differential equations several of the terms vanish by assumptions. The Schönert and Sander model reflects the experimental data in many aspects but the predicted shear force distinctly deviates from the experimental results at the angular position of the peak pressure level. This finding suggests that the particle to particle interaction and breakage process in the different zones seen in Figure 1 are complex and difficult to model using analytical models. A numerical modelling approach using DEM does not require the same amount <b>of</b> assumptions and <b>simplifications</b> <b>of</b> <b>boundary</b> conditions. Hence such modelling may provide further knowledge and vital understanding. In this paper the breakage process is simulated in order to investigate the shear slip behaviour and how it relates to different operating variables. A laboratory scale HPGR corresponding to the experimental setup used by Schönert (2002) have been modelled in EDEM (DEM-Solutions). The bonded particle model (BPM) is used for modelling quartz particles (Potyondy, 2004). The breakage model strength parameters are calibrated against interparticle breakage experiments in an Instron 400 RD compression device. The contact model parameters are calibrated using calibration methods developed by Quist (2015). The floating roller dynamics are modelled using a spring-damper system. Results present insights regarding the interparticle slip behaviour as well as the frictional tangential force distribution on the rollers. The simulated roller pressure distribution shows good correspondence with previously reported findings in the literature...|$|R
40|$|The {{two-body}} Coulomb scattering {{problem is}} solved using the standard complex scaling method. The explicit enforcement <b>of</b> the scattering <b>boundary</b> condition is avoided. Splitting of the scattering wave function {{based on the}} Coulomb modified plane wave is considered. This decomposition leads a three-dimensional Schrödinger equation with source term. Partial wave expansion is carried out and the asymptotic form of the solution is determined. This splitting {{does not lead to}} <b>simplification</b> <b>of</b> the scattering <b>boundary</b> condition if complex scaling is invoked. A new splitting carried out only on partial wave level is introduced and this method is proved to be very useful. The scattered part of the wave function tends to zero at large inter-particle distance. This property permits of easy numerical solution: the scattered part of the wave function can be expanded on bound-state type basis. The new method can be applied not only for pure Coulomb potential butin the presence of short range interaction too. Comment: submitted to Phys. Rev. ...|$|R
40|$|PhD, Faculty of Engineering and the Built Environment, University of the Witwatersrand, 2010 Informal {{settlements}} are {{a growing}} world-wide phenomenon. Up-to-date spatial information mapping settlements {{is essential for}} a variety of end-user applications from planning settlement upgrading to monitoring expansion and infill. One method of gathering this information is through the analysis of nadir-view aerial imagery and the automated or semi-automated extraction of individual shacks. The problem of shack detection and delineation in, particularly South African, informal settlements is a unique and difficult one. This is primarily due to the inhomogeneous appearance of shack roofs, which are constructed from a variety of disparate materials, and the density of shacks. Previous research has focused mostly on the use of height data in conjunction with optical images to perform automated or semi-automated shack extraction. In this thesis, a novel approach to automating shack extraction is presented and prototyped, in which the appearance of shack roofs is homogenised, facilitating their detection. The main features of this strategy are: construction of an anisotropic scale-space from a single source image and detection of hypotheses at multiple scales; <b>simplification</b> <b>of</b> hypotheses' <b>boundaries</b> through discrete curve evolution and regularisation <b>of</b> <b>boundaries</b> in accordance with an assumed shack model - a 4 - 6 sided, compact, rectilinear shape; selection of hypotheses competing across scales using fuzzy rules; grouping of hypotheses based on their support for one another, and localisation and re-regularisation <b>of</b> <b>boundaries</b> through the incorporation of image edges. The prototype's performance is evaluated in terms of standard metrics and is analysed for four different images, having three different sets of imaging conditions, and containing well over a hundred shacks.

40|$|AbstractThe {{analytic}} approach {{proposed by}} Sekerzh-Zenkovich [On {{the theory of}} standing waves of finite amplitude, Dokl. Akad. Nauk USSR 58 (1947) 551 – 554] is developed {{in the present study}} of standing waves. Generalizing the solution method, a set of standing wave problems are solved, namely, the infinite- and finite-depth surface standing waves and the infinite- and finite-depth internal standing waves. Two-dimensional wave motion of an irrotational incompressible fluid in a rectangular domain is considered to study weakly nonlinear surface and internal standing waves. The Lagrangian formulation of the problems is used and the fifth-order perturbation solutions are determined. Since most of the approximate analytic solutions to these problems were obtained using the Eulerian formulation, the comparison of the results, as an example the analytic frequency–amplitude dependences, obtained in Lagrangian variables with the corresponding ones known in Eulerian variables has been carried out in the paper. The analytic frequency–amplitude dependences are in complete agreement with previous results known in the literature. Computer algebra procedures were written for the construction of asymptotic solutions. The application of the model constructed in Lagrangian formulation to a set of different problems shows the ability to correctly reproduce and predict a wide range of situations with different characteristics and some advantages of Lagrangian particle models (for example, the bigger radius of convergence of an expansion parameter than in Eulerian variables, <b>simplification</b> <b>of</b> the <b>boundary</b> conditions, parametrization <b>of</b> a free <b>boundary)</b> ...|$|R

Further more the influence of slotting parameters on smart bearing’s mechanical characteristics is studied with FEA method. Choosing 220 type of ball bearing as an example, theoretical analysis results of influence of slotting parameters on the maximum stress and deformation of outer ring are shown. The FEA results showed that micro-sensors for smart bearings should be manufactured flatter or the groove depth for micro-sensor embedding should be smaller soon as possible in order to insure the smart bearing’s original mechanical rigidity and strength...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Results of {{finite element}} (FE) {{analyses}} can {{give insight into}} musculoskeletal diseases if physiological boundary conditions, which include the muscle forces during specific activities of daily life, are considered in the finite element modelling. So far, many <b>simplifications</b> <b>of</b> the <b>boundary</b> conditions are currently made. This study presents an approach for FE modelling of the lower limb for which muscle forces were included. Method The stance phase of normal gait was simulated. Muscle forces were calculated using a musculoskeletal rigid body (RB) model of the human body, and were subsequently applied to a FE model of the lower limb. It was shown that the inertial forces are negligible during the stance phase of normal gait. The contact surfaces between the parts within the knee were modelled as bonded. Weak springs were attached to the distal tibia for numerical reasons. Results Hip joint reaction forces from the RB model and those from the FE model were similar in magnitude with relative differences less than 16 %. The forces of the weak spring were negligible compared to the applied muscle forces. The maximal strain was 0. 23 % in the proximal region of the femoral diaphysis and 1. 7 % in the contact zone between the tibia and the fibula. Conclusions The presented approach based on FE modelling by including muscle forces from inverse dynamic analysis of musculoskeletal RB model {{can be used to}} perform analyses of the lower limb with very realistic boundary conditions. In the present form, this model can be used to better understand the loading, stresses and strains of bones in the knee area and hence to analyse osteotomy fixation devices...|$|R

40|$|Summary. The <b>simplification</b> <b>of</b> nonconvex {{tetrahedral}} meshes {{with the}} help of edge collapses (edge contractions) is considerably more complex than the corresponding <b>simplification</b> <b>of</b> convex meshes. In particular, edge collapses in nonconvex meshes may cause intersections of cells that are hard to detect, and therefore hard to avoid. More precisely spoken, the problem is quadratic in the number of cells. However, we show how to reduce the complexity of this problem by employing a preprocessing step, which was originally proposed in order to sort nonconvex meshes. Moreover, our method is able to handle meshes with topologically non-trivial boundaries and to control the modification of the topology <b>of</b> the mesh’s <b>boundary.</b> ...|$|R
