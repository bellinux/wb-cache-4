5|$|The White House's {{most famous}} alleged {{apparition}} {{is that of}} Abraham Lincoln. Eleanor Roosevelt never admitted to having seen Lincoln's ghost, but did say that she felt his presence repeatedly throughout the White House. Mrs. Roosevelt {{also said that the}} family dog, Fala, would sometimes bark for no reason at what she felt was Lincoln's ghost. President Dwight Eisenhower's press secretary, James Hagerty, and Liz Carpenter, press secretary to First Lady Lady Bird Johnson, both said they felt Lincoln's presence many times. The former president's footsteps are also said to be heard in the hall outside the Lincoln Bedroom. As reputable an eyewitness as Lillian Rogers Parks admitted in her autobiography My Thirty Years Backstairs at the White House that she had heard them. Margaret Truman, daughter of President Harry S. Truman, said she heard a specter rapping {{at the door of the}} Lincoln Bedroom when she stayed there, and believed it was Lincoln. President Truman himself was once wakened by raps at the door while spending a night in the Lincoln Bedroom. Others have actually seen an apparition of the former president. The first person reported to have actually seen Lincoln's spirit was First Lady Grace Coolidge, who said she saw the ghost of Lincoln standing at a window in the Yellow Oval Room <b>staring</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Potomac. Winston Churchill, Theodore Roosevelt, and Maureen Reagan and her husband have all claimed to have seen a spectral Lincoln in the White House. A number of staff members of the Franklin D. Roosevelt administration claimed to have seen Lincoln's spirit, and on one occasion Roosevelt's personal valet ran screaming from the White House claiming he had seen Lincoln's ghost. Perhaps the most famous incident was in 1942 when Queen Wilhelmina of The Netherlands heard footsteps outside her White House bedroom and answered a knock on the door, only to see Lincoln in frock coat and top hat standing in front of her (she promptly fainted). Several unnamed eyewitnesses have claimed to have seen the shade of Abraham Lincoln actually lying down on the bed in the Lincoln Bedroom (which was used as a meeting room at the time of his administration), and others have seen Lincoln sit on the edge of the bed and put his boots on. The most famous eyewitness to the latter was Mary Eben, Eleanor Roosevelt's secretary, who saw Lincoln pulling on his boots (after which she ran screaming from the room).|$|E
6000|$|... "The Lady Cicely sits in her parlour. I saw {{her sweet}} {{face at the}} window but now <b>staring</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> snow as though she thought to see a ghost in it." ...|$|E
60|$|She {{went and}} stood at the further window, <b>staring</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> rain. For a long time we were {{absolutely}} still. The wind and rain came in little gusts upon the pane. She turned to me abruptly.|$|E
60|$|He sat <b>staring</b> blankly <b>out</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> window, {{and taking}} his wife's hand between his own, pressed {{it as he}} had been wont to do in their old courting-days nearly forty years before.|$|R
60|$|He {{began to}} {{walk up and down}} the room, then he went into the dining-room, and stood <b>staring</b> blankly <b>out</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> cornfield. The table was already laid for lunch. Presently he turned, still dreaming, and almost {{mechanically}} helped himself to a glass of sherry.|$|R
6000|$|... "Tell me a story," [...] said <b>the</b> Baroness, <b>staring</b> <b>out</b> despairingly <b>at</b> <b>the</b> rain; it {{was that}} light, apologetic sort of rain that {{looks as if it}} was going to leave off every minute and goes on for the greater part of the afternoon.|$|R
60|$|She was gone--oh, thank God, she was gone! Rilla {{was alone}} again, <b>staring</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> unchanged, dream-like beauty of moonlit Four Winds. Feeling {{was coming back}} to her--a pang of agony so acute as to be almost {{physical}} seemed to rend her apart.|$|E
6000|$|... "She {{would do}} it," [...] added Mr. Truefitt, {{crossing}} {{to the window}} and <b>staring</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> road {{with his back to the}} captain. [...] "And she said something about a silver-plated butter-dish; but in the circumstances I said ’No.’ Miss Willett thought so too." ...|$|E
60|$|Alone in {{the stable}} Lawrence stood <b>staring</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> dull red ball of the winter sun with unseeing eyes. He had {{implicit}} faith in his mother, and the stab had gone straight to his heart. Bessy Houghton listened in vain that night for his well-known footfall on the verandah.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, rain! rain! rain!" [...] muttered Mr. Goodworth, <b>staring</b> desperately <b>out</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> miserable prospect, while Zack amused {{himself by}} rubbing his nose vacantly {{backwards}} and forwards against a pane of glass. [...] "Rain! rain! Nothing but rain and fog in November. Hold up, Zack! Ding-dong, ding-dong; there go the bells for afternoon church! I wonder {{whether it will}} be fine to-morrow? Think of the pudding, my boy!" [...] whispered the old gentleman with a benevolent remembrance of the consolation which that thought had often afforded to him, {{when he was a child}} himself.|$|R
50|$|The architect, {{holding the}} plans, is <b>staring</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> window <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{unfinished}} house, waiting patiently for sufficient funds to allow work to restart. Some commentators have {{identified him as}} a lawyer along with Silvertongue here for the bargaining, stating that his facial features and posture indicate his amazed disgust at what even he can tell is hideous.|$|R
5000|$|Cory Barker of TV Guide {{summarized}} that, [...] "... it {{managed to}} produce such a fun, propulsive second episode without the normal post-pilot drop-off {{is both an}} achievement in of itself, and a great sign {{for the rest of}} Season 1 and beyond." [...] Barker also commented that: [...] "the church sequence ran the gamut from intensely violent to surprisingly comedic, striking a tonal balance that simply shouldn't work... But does." [...] Alan Sepinwall of HitFix praised the Rogen and Goldberg's presentation of their [...] "gorgeous bit of imagery", such as, [...] "Jesse baptizing his flock, the camera remaining lock still as the house Odin Quincannon has just bought is bulldozed; Cassidy <b>staring</b> wistfully <b>out</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> open plains when he realizes it's now too light for him to safely go outside, and every beat of bonkers, intricately-choreographed action when Cassidy takes on the two mystery men <b>at</b> <b>the</b> church." ...|$|R
60|$|She hummed softly, {{then three}} times she sang the horn-call. Siegmund, {{with his face}} expressionless as a mask, sat <b>staring</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> mist. The boom of the siren broke in upon them. To him, the sound was full of fatality. Helena waited till the noise died down, then she {{repeated}} her horn-call.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, Augusta," [...] I answered, still <b>staring</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> sea. [...] "In {{the prison}} yonder {{is an old}} bishop named Barnabas of Egypt, who was set upon by other bishops at the Council while you were away and wellnigh beaten to death. I ask {{that he may be}} freed and {{restored}} to his diocese with honour." ...|$|E
6000|$|The glorious {{moment of}} {{standing}} lordly in the inn doorway, and <b>staring</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> world, the swinging sign, the geese upon the green, the duck-pond, a waiting waggon, the church tower, a sleepy cat, the blue heavens, with the sizzle of the frying audible behind one! The keen {{smell of the}} bacon! The trotting of feet bearing the repast; the click and clatter as the tableware is finally arranged! A clean white cloth! ...|$|E
50|$|Also {{aboard the}} Empress are a {{zoologist}} named Tryst {{and his assistant}} Della, with their CET (Continual Event Transmuter) Machine, which stores portions of planets on electro-magnetic crystals. Their collection is large and ethically dubious. Their most recent stop was on the planet Eden where one of their expedition was killed, but both Tryst and Della are reluctant to provide too many details. Romana, however, examines the Eden projection when she is on her own and is sure she has seen eyes <b>staring</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> her from <b>the</b> dark and forbidding jungle. When she later looks <b>at</b> <b>the</b> projection again an insect appears from within it and stings her.|$|R
6000|$|<b>Staring</b> dumbly <b>out</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> toiling sweltering human ant-hill Comus marvelled how missionary enthusiasts could labour {{hopefully}} <b>at</b> <b>the</b> work of transplanting their religion, {{with its}} homegrown accretions of fatherly parochial benevolence, in this heat-blistered, fever- scourged wilderness, where men lived like groundbait and died like flies. Demons one might believe in, if {{one did not}} hold one's imagination in healthy check, but a kindly all-managing God, never. Somewhere in the west country of England Comus had an uncle {{who lived in a}} rose-smothered rectory and taught a wholesome gentle- hearted creed that expressed itself in the spirit of [...] "Little lamb, who made thee?" [...] and faithfully reflected the beautiful homely Christ-child sentiment of Saxon Europe. What a far away, unreal fairy story it all seemed here in this West African land, where the bodies of men were of as little account as the bubbles that floated on the oily froth of the great flowing river, and where it required a stretch of wild profitless imagination to credit them with undying souls. In the life he had come from Comus had been accustomed to think of individuals as definite masterful personalities, making their several marks on the circumstances that revolved around them; they did well or ill, or in most cases indifferently, and were criticised, praised, blamed, thwarted or tolerated, or given way to. In any case, humdrum or outstanding, they had their spheres of importance, little or big. They dominated a breakfast table or harassed a Government, according to their capabilities or opportunities, or perhaps they merely had irritating mannerisms. At any rate it seemed highly probable that they had souls. Here a man simply made a unit in an unnumbered population, an inconsequent dot in a loosely-compiled deathroll. Even his own position as a white man exalted conspicuously above a horde of black natives did not save Comus from the depressing sense of nothingness which his first experience of fever had thrown over him. He was a lost, soulless body in this great uncaring land; if he died another would take his place, his few effects would be inventoried and sent down to the coast, someone else would finish off any tea or whisky that he left behind--that would be all.|$|R
60|$|The {{next morning}} we took up our march silently with the dawn, the prairie grouse {{whirring}} ahead of us. At last, as afternoon drew on, a dark line of green edged the prairie to the westward, and our spirits rose. From mouth to mouth ran the word that these were the woods which fringed the bluff above Kaskaskia itself. We pressed ahead, and the destiny of the new Republic for which we had fought made us walk unseen. Excitement keyed us high; we reached the shade, plunged into it, and presently came <b>out</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> bastioned corners of a fort which rose from the centre of a clearing. It had once defended the place, but now stood abandoned and dismantled. Beyond it, <b>at</b> <b>the</b> edge of the bluff, we halted, astonished. The sun was falling in the west, and below us was the goal for the sight of which we had suffered so much. At our feet, across the wooded bottom, was the Kaskaskia River, and beyond, the peaceful little French village with its low houses and orchards and gardens colored by the touch of the evening light. In the centre of it stood a stone church with its belfry; but our searching eyes alighted on the spot to the southward of it, near the river. There stood a rambling stone building with the shingles of its roof weathered black, and all around it a palisade of pointed sticks thrust in the ground, and {{with a pair of}} gates and watch-towers. Drooping on its staff was the standard of England. North and south of the village the emerald common gleamed in the slanting light, speckled red and white and black by grazing cattle. Here and there, in untidy brown patches, were Indian settlements, and far away to the westward the tawny Father of Waters gleamed through the cottonwoods.|$|R
6000|$|... "My poor boy! Did you see him--his forehead?" [...] Her lips quivered. [...] "I {{will take}} him back home." [...] And tears rolled, one after the other, slowly down her flushed face under her veil. Poor woman! Poor woman! She had turned to the window, passing her {{handkerchief}} up under the veil, <b>staring</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> little strip of darkening lawn, and Winton, too, stared out into that mournful daylight. At last, he said: ...|$|E
6000|$|Brangwen {{went up to}} {{his room}} and lay <b>staring</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> stars of the summer night, his whole being in a whirl. What was it all? There was a life so {{different}} from what he knew it. What was there outside his knowledge, how much? What was this that he had touched? What was he in this new influence? What did everything mean? Where was life, in that which he knew or all outside him? ...|$|E
60|$|The girl, biting the finger-tip of {{her white}} cotton glove, was <b>staring</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> traffic. Like a pale ray of light {{entering}} the now dim cavern of the old man's mind, the thought came to Creed {{that he did not}} quite understand her. He had in his time had occasion to class many young persons, and the feeling that he did not quite know her class of person was like the sensation a bat might have, surprised by daylight.|$|E
60|$|There was a {{movement}} and an exclamation from my right, and {{peering through the}} gloom, I saw Whitney, pale, haggard, and unkempt, <b>staring</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> me.|$|R
5000|$|<b>At</b> <b>the</b> end of {{the episode}} our three young doctors are seen {{standing}} <b>at</b> <b>the</b> edge of a cliff, <b>staring</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> paradise. Lily says: [...] "If there was anywhere to start over, this is it..." ...|$|R
6000|$|But {{the child}} stood unanswering, his little pale lips pinched together, his eyes <b>staring</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> nothing. Emily went {{on her knees}} before him, and put her face close to his, saying, with a voice that made one shrink from its {{unbridled}} emotion of caress: ...|$|R
60|$|Mrs Wickam, {{with her}} eyebrows elevated, {{and her head}} on one side, lighted the way upstairs to a clean, neat chamber, opening on another chamber dimly lighted, {{where there was a}} bed. In the first room, an old woman sat {{mechanically}} <b>staring</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> open window, on the darkness. In the second, stretched upon the bed, lay the shadow of a figure that had spurned the wind and rain, one wintry night; hardly to be recognised now, but by the long black hair that showed so very black against the colourless face, and all the white things about it.|$|E
60|$|The mist cleared away, {{rolling up}} like a curtain and {{revealing}} on the shore a number {{of men and women}} clad in white robes, who were martialled in ranks there, chanting and <b>staring</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> dim waters of the lagoon. Yonder upon the waters, driven forward by the gentle breeze, floated a canoe and lo! in the prow of that canoe sat a white man and on his head the god which they had lost a whole generation gone. On the head of a white man it had departed; on the head of a white man it returned. They saw and fell upon their knees.|$|E
60|$|It fascinated her. There were {{inaccessible}} ledges that haunted {{her with}} their remote fastnesses. How wonderful {{would it be}} to get there, rest there, if that were possible! But only eagles could reach them. There were places, then, that the desecrating hands of man could not touch. The dark caves were mystically potent in their vacant <b>staring</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> world beneath them. The crumbling crags, the toppling ledges, the leaning rocks all threatened to come thundering down at the breath of wind. How deep and soft the red color {{in contrast with the}} green! How splendid the sheer bold uplift of gigantic steps! Carley found herself marveling at the forces that had so rudely, violently, and grandly left this monument to nature.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, they're not so bad," [...] {{was all he}} answered. He {{pretended that}} his hand was the cat and hers the mouse. For {{the first time she}} tolerated him rather than {{encouraged}} him. She was <b>staring</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> Schoenstrom, a hamlet of perhaps a hundred and fifty inhabitants, <b>at</b> which <b>the</b> train was stopping.|$|R
50|$|Jack Mossop was {{confined}} to a Stafford mental hospital, because he had reoccurring dreams of a woman <b>staring</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> him from a tree. He died in the hospital before {{the body in the}} wych elm was found. The likelihood of this being the correct explanation is questioned because Una Mossop did not come forward with this information until more than ten years after Jack Mossop's death.|$|R
6000|$|... "She couldn't keep still. She was {{different}} from the woman one had last seen. She used to be so calm--as if she were always sitting for her portrait. Wasn't she in fact always being painted in a pink frock and one row of pearls, always <b>staring</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> you in exhibitions, as if she were saying 'Here they are again'? Last night she was on the rush." ...|$|R
60|$|Pat {{was asleep}} {{almost as soon}} as he touched the bed, and Hal and Upton were not far behind him. But to Sparrer, tired as he was, the novelty of his {{surroundings}} was too great for immediate sleep, {{and for a long time}} he lay <b>staring</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> flickering flames and above them at the brilliant stars, his active imagination keyed to a high pitch. It was like fairy-land to him. Nothing seemed real. He had read and heard of these things, but that he, Eddie Muldoon, could actually be experiencing them, sleeping in a real hunter's camp in the dead of winter, tramping on snow-shoes through great lonely forests, eating such meals as he had never known before in all his short life--meals cooked over open fires in the great wonderful out-of-doors, couldn't be. And yet here he was.|$|E
60|$|Horrocks {{held the}} door open with a {{ceremonial}} politeness unusual in him towards men. Raut went out, and then, after a wordless look at her, her husband followed. She stood motionless while Raut's light footfall and her husband's heavy tread, like bass and treble, passed down the passage together. The front door slammed heavily. She went to the window, moving slowly, and stood watching, leaning forward. The two men appeared {{for a moment at}} the gateway in the road, passed under the street lamp, and were hidden by the black masses of the shrubbery. The lamplight fell for a moment on their faces, showing only unmeaning pale patches, telling nothing of what she still feared, and doubted, and craved vainly to know. Then she sank down into a crouching attitude in the big arm-chair, her eyes-wide open and <b>staring</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> red lights from the furnaces that flickered in the sky. An hour after she was still there, her attitude scarcely changed.|$|E
60|$|The great {{stallion}} that Slone {{had nearly}} sacrificed {{his life to}} catch was like a thorn in the rider's flesh. Slone lay there in the darkness, restless, hot, rolling from side to side, or <b>staring</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> star-studded sky--miserably unhappy all on account of that horse. Almost he hated him. What pride he had felt in Wildfire! How he had gloried in {{the gift of the}} stallion to Lucy! Then, {{on the morning of the}} race had come that unexpected, incomprehensible and wild act of which he had been guilty. Yet not to save his life, his soul, could he regret it! Was it he who had been responsible, or an unknown savage within him? He had kept his word to Lucy, when day after day he had burned with love until that fatal moment when the touch of her, as he lifted her to Wildfire's saddle, had made a madman out of him. He had swept her into his arms and held her breast to his, her face before him, and he had kissed the sweet, parting lips till he was blind.|$|E
5000|$|... “The gaze {{is telling}} in these pictures. The boys are {{figuring}} {{out who they}} are and who they want to become while <b>staring</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> both their mother and the artist, the push and pull of separating from family while gaining strength from it. Growing up is not always easy, but Fougeron gracefully shows us the metamorphosis in all its complicated beauty”, says Cory Jacobs, curator of <b>the</b> Gallery <b>at</b> Hermès in New York City.|$|R
60|$|The small patrol ship {{made its}} landing with care and precision, its jets choking into final silence. The hatch slid back and Doctor Henry Harris found himself <b>staring</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> a field, a brown, sun-baked landing field. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> {{end of the}} field was a tall signal tower. Around the field on all sides were long grey buildings, the Garrison check-station itself. Not far off a huge Venusian cruiser was parked, a vast green hulk, like an {{enormous}} lime. The technicians from the station were swarming all over it, checking and examining each inch of it for lethal life-forms and poisons that might have attached themselves to the hull.|$|R
6000|$|A pause--then Flo cried out, [...] "Bless me, there's a gallows {{and a man}} going up." [...] "Where, where?" [...] shrieks Amy, <b>staring</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> two tall posts with a {{crossbeam}} {{and some}} dangling chains. [...] "A colliery," [...] remarks Uncle, with a twinkle of the eye. [...] "Here's a lovely flock of lambs all lying down," [...] says Amy. [...] "See, Papa, aren't they pretty?" [...] added Flo sentimentally.
