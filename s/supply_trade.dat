50|$|The aim of {{this pilot}} project (2006-2008) was to {{increase}} trade in honey, bringing more income to poor, rural beekeepers. The Project {{was funded by the}} UK-based donor, Comic Relief, and implemented by the Uganda Export Promotion Board (UEPB), The Uganda National Apiculture Development Organisation (TUNADO), and Bees for Development.

The local market for table honey is significant, and demand in urban areas outstrips <b>supply.</b> <b>Trade</b> opportunities for other bee products are also growing.

40|$|Supply chain {{management}} {{is central to}} the operation of today’s enterprises. Global competition and ever shorter product life cycles are forcing companies to explore more agile supply chain practices. This includes adopting more flexible contractual relationships and taking advantage of new levels of interoperability made possible by emerging standards such as Web services. In these emerging supply chain environments, prices and availability of components and finished products tend to be less predictable. This in turn gives rise to new competitive (or “strategic”) interactions between actors across the supply chain. This includes interactions between manufacturers and their suppliers, between the suppliers themselves, between manufacturers, between manufacturers and their customers. Similar trends and strategic interactions arise in the service sector. The objective of this special issue is to assemble a collection of original, high-quality articles describing novel <b>supply</b> chain <b>trading</b> techniques. This includes work on designing and evaluating expressive <b>supply</b> chain <b>trading</b> mechanisms, managing portfolios of more flexible contractual supply chain relationships, the development of adaptive trading technologies, as well as techniques and architectures aimed at better coordinating interactions with both customers and suppliers. The issue is particularly interested in recent work on dynamic <b>supply</b> chain <b>trading</b> technologies such as those developed and evaluated {{in the context of the}} <b>Supply</b> Chain <b>Trading</b> Competition (TAC-SCM).
