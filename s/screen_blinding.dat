40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to investigate whether knowledge of human papillomavirus (HPV) deoxyribonucleic acid test results increases sensitivity of guided cytology screening for the detection of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) - 2 or higher-grade cervical lesions. STUDY DESIGN: This was a prospective colposcopy-controlled study of 2905 BD SurePath samples to identify cases with CIN 2 + within a 24 month follow-up period. Sensitivity and specificity to detect CIN 2 + was evaluated, comparing guided cytology screening with and without prior knowledge of HPV status. RESULTS: Prior knowledge of HPV status resulted in significantly higher detection rate of CIN 2 + compared with <b>screening</b> <b>blinded</b> to HPV status (P =. 005) with limited loss of specificity (P =. 026). Gain in sensitivity is higher in older women (43. 8 %, P =. 008) vs in younger women (10. 2 %, P =. 317), whereas loss of specificity is more pronounced in younger women (P <. 001) vs older women (P =. 729).

40|$|Introduction: The interleukin- 1 (IL- 1) {{gene family}} {{includes}} three members (IL- 1 a, IL- 1 b and IL- 1 Ra) that mediate immune and inflammatory responses. Interleukin- 1 (IL- 1) is an inflammatory cytokine involved in various autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. IL- 1 receptor antagonist (IL- 1 Ra) is the naturally occurring antagonist to IL- 1 a and IL- 1 b. A variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) polymorphism in the IL- 1 Ra gene {{has been associated}} with increased IL- 1 Ra production and affects the severity of aGVHD. Material and methods: Three hundred and fifty pairs (175 HSCT recipients and their donors) were analyzed by VNTR/PCR. Because of haematological disorders all patients were transplanted. All genotypes were <b>screened</b> <b>blind</b> to the clinical outcome of the transplants. GVHD was graded using Glucksberg criteria. Results: The influence of different alleles on incidence of aGVHD was investigated with univariate analysis. None of them showed an association with aGVHD, but possession of allele 2 in donors was associated with less severe aGVHD, although the frequency of allele 2 in our study population was low. However, aGVHD correlated with recipient age, donor age and recipient disease, particularly thalassaemia. Conclusions: No significant correlation was observed between the IL- 1 Ra polymorphism and incidence of aGVHD. In addition there was a powerful association between diagnosis, particularly thalassaemia, and GVHD (26 out of 30 thalassaemia patients). These findings may help to predict the risk/severity of GVHD, which may contribute to selecting strategies for treatment/prevention in thalassaemia patients...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Misdiagnosis of {{imported}} malaria {{is not uncommon}} and even abnormal routine laboratory tests may not trigger malaria smears. However, <b>blind</b> <b>screening</b> of all thrombocytopenic samples might be a possible way to detect clinically unsuspected malaria cases in the {{accident and emergency department}} (AED). METHODS: The frequency and degree of thrombocytopenia was determined in two cohorts of malaria patients (Lisbon, Portugal and Berlin, Germany). The frequency of thrombocytopenia in full blood count (FBC) samples from patients presenting at the ED at a large teaching hospital in Lisbon, Portugal, was determined and compared with urgent samples from in-patients, both determined at a dedicated emergency laboratory. A cut-off value was established for screening of all FBC samples from the ED with Giemsa-stained thick-blood films. RESULTS: In 4, 362 unselected samples from the ED in Lisbon a thrombocytopenia of < 150, 000 /microL was found in 7 % and of < 100, 000 /microL in 2. 2 % of cases (2. 5 samples/day with < 100. 000 /microL). In patients with malaria, a thrombocytopenia was found in 75 % and 77 % (< 150, 000 /microL) or 53 % and 45 % (< 100, 000 /microL) in Lisbon, (n= 60) and Berlin (n= 170), respectively. <b>Blind</b> <b>screening</b> of all samples with < 100, 000 thrombocytes/microL by thick-blood film microscopy led to the diagnosis of 5 unsuspected malaria cases (3 Plasmodium falciparum, 1 Plasmodium vivax and 1 Plasmodium ovale), during the study. The diagnosis of each unsuspected malaria case would have cost 21 hours of dedicated technician's time. CONCLUSIONS: The problem of clinically unsuspected malaria seems to be more common than generally expected and is dependent on the local incidence of malaria as well as clinical and laboratory expertise. The <b>blind</b> <b>screening</b> of all thrombocytopenic samples with < 100, 000 /microL may be a cost-effective way to reduce the misdiagnosis {{of imported}} malari...|$|R
