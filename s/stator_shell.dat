40|$|Complete vehicle, {{system and}} {{component}} target setting for noise, vibration and harshness (NVH) are important activities within automotive product development. New challenges arise when electric motors are introduced into cars traditionally powered by internal combustion engines (ICE). Although the electric powertrain is generally quieter than ICEs, the sound character however {{is completely different}} and necessarily not more preferable. The noise signature from an electric traction motor is characterized by speed-dependent high frequency tonal components from the dominating electro-magnetic harmonics, covering a wide rpm-range. With relatively low levels of broad band masking noise from tires and wind, the tonal components can be accented in a large frequency range and contribute to perceived annoyance for the occupants inside the car. Methods for good practice of NVH development work for traditional vehicles have been established and refined during the last decades. With the rapid increase of various types of electric powertrain-equipped low emission vehicles, new methodology is {{required in order to}} understand and fulfill expectations on these unaccustomed vehicle-acoustic phenomena. The objective with this thesis was to investigate the audible perception of the electric powertrain and develop and validate methods for assessment of noise transmission. The findings aim to support the complete vehicle, system and component target setting processes to secure a desired sound quality in future electric vehicle launches. The thesis is based upon four papers. The first two papers address the human perception of the sound from the electric powertrain during driving. In Paper 1, the evaluation methodology of electric powertrain sound quality was investigated. It was concluded that the mean ratings of a specific acceleration sound stimulus was judged similarly in two laboratory test environments (listening room and “sound car” respectively) as during on-road driving. Further, with lower level of high frequency (> 1 kHz) tonal components, the overall satisfaction and annoyance ratings were improved. The annoyance due to tonal components, stationary as well as speed-dependent, was further studied in Paper 2. The psycho-acoustic metric prominence ratio (PR) was used to quantify the tone levels relative to the adjacent background noise. It was found that for PR-levels below 3 dB, the perceived annoyance was similar independent of frequency range. Increased PR-level provided higher probability of detecting the tones and the perceived annoyance was significantly increased compared to PR< 3 dB for tones above 2. 5 kHz. The findings from Paper 1 and 2 provide foundation for complete vehicle interior acoustic target specification. The following two papers (Paper 3 and 4) focus on the main mechanical system properties that are responsible for the airborne radiation and transfer of electric powertrain induced noise. Paper 3 has emphasis on the experimental determination of acoustic transfer functions (ATFs) between the car’s interior to multiple positions located on the <b>stator</b> <b>shell</b> surface of an electric rear axle drive. It addresses the ATFs’ spatial resolution with respect to estimated interior noise for theoretically derived and measured surface vibrations. A reciprocal relation was assumed; therefore the measured ATFs could be used to inversely reproduce the sound transmission from the <b>stator</b> <b>shell</b> to the interior. ATFs and surface velocities are also central in Paper 4, where a method for in-situ determination of radiated sound power from a <b>stator</b> <b>shell</b> was presented and validated. By acquiring the operational deflection shape due to an electro-magnetic radial force wave, a simplified expression for the radiation efficiency was estimated. Paper 3 and 4 highlights the advantages of the rotational symmetric force excitation acting on the stator housing which enables sound power as an acoustic source characterization which perhaps is the most adequate measure for system target setting directed towards external suppliers.

40|$|Radial Halbach {{magnetic}} bearings {{have been}} investigated {{as part of an}} effort to develop increasingly reliable noncontact bearings for future high-speed rotary machines that may be used in such applications as aircraft, industrial, and land-vehicle power systems and in some medical and scientific instrumentation systems. Radial Halbach magnetic bearings are based on the same principle as that of axial Halbach magnetic bearings, differing in geometry as the names of these two types of bearings suggest. Both radial and axial Halbach magnetic bearings are passive in the sense that unlike most other magnetic bearings that have been developed in recent years, they effect stable magnetic levitation without need for complex active control. Axial Halbach magnetic bearings were described in Axial Halbach Magnetic Bearings (LEW- 18066 - 1), NASA Tech Briefs, Vol. 32, No. 7 (July 2008), page 85. In the remainder of this article, the description of the principle of operation from the cited prior article is recapitulated and updated to incorporate the present radial geometry. In simplest terms, the basic principle of levitation in an axial or radial Halbach magnetic bearing is that of the repulsive electromagnetic force between (1) a moving permanent magnet and (2) an electric current induced in a stationary electrical conductor by the motion of the magnetic field. An axial or radial Halbach bearing includes multiple permanent magnets arranged in a Halbach array ("Halbach array" is defined below) in a rotor and multiple conductors in the form of wire coils in a stator, all arranged so the rotary motion produces an axial or radial repulsion that is sufficient to levitate the rotor. A basic Halbach array (see Figure 1) consists of a row of permanent magnets, each oriented so that its magnetic field is at a right angle to that of the adjacent magnet, and the right-angle turns are sequenced so as to maximize the magnitude of the magnetic flux density on one side of the row while minimizing it on the opposite side. The advantage of this configuration is that it makes it possible to approach the theoretical maximum force per unit area that could be exerted by a given amount of permanent-magnet material. The configuration is named after physicist Klaus Halbach, who conceived it for use in particle accelerators. Halbach arrays have also been studied for use in magnetic-levitation ("maglev") railroad trains. In a radial Halbach magnetic bearing, the basic Halbach arrangement is modified into a symmetrical arrangement of sector-shaped permanent magnets mounted on the outer cylindrical surface of a drum rotor (see Figure 2). The magnets are oriented to concentrate the magnetic field on their radially outermost surface. The stator coils are mounted in a <b>stator</b> <b>shell</b> surrounding the rotor...|$|E
40|$|Part 8 : Robotics and MechatronicsInternational audienceThis paper {{proposes to}} recover the concept of spherical {{induction}} electrical machines to conceive a shell-like actuator with multi-DOF (Degrees-Of-Freedom). The actuator is formed by a <b>shell</b> <b>stator</b> and a spherical rotor. This work contains the feasibility study of that solution when applied as an active joint actuator in assistive devices. Its electromechanical characteristics are first analyzed using an analytic model that includes: {{the distribution of the}} magnetic potential vector and thus the components of the magnetic flux density in the airgap due to a sinusoidal current distribution imposed in the stator; the model also shows the induced electromotive forces and associated current density distribution in the rotor; and at last the radial and tangential components of the force density in the rotor. The shell-like actuator is concretized as an active joint for assisting movement of the lower leg of a typical 70 kg person. Based on its requirements, the joint actuator electromechanical characteristics are analyzed according to its sensitivity to a set of electrical and mechanical variables...|$|R
