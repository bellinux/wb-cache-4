25|$|In European {{classical}} music and opera, voices are treated like musical instruments. Composers who write vocal music {{must have an}} understanding of the skills, talents, and vocal properties of singers. Voice classification is the process by which human singing voices are evaluated and are thereby designated into voice types. These qualities include {{but are not limited to}} vocal range, vocal weight, vocal tessitura, vocal timbre, and vocal transition points such as breaks and lifts within the voice. Other considerations are physical characteristics, <b>speech</b> <b>level,</b> scientific testing, and vocal registration. The science behind voice classification developed within European {{classical music}} has been slow in adapting to more modern forms of singing. Voice classification is often used within opera to associate possible roles with potential voices. There are currently several different systems in use within classical music including the German Fach system and the choral music system among many others. No system is universally applied or accepted.|$|E

40|$|Javanese is a {{well known}} for its <b>speech</b> <b>levels</b> called ngoko ‘low’ and krama ‘high’ which enable its {{speakers}} to show intimacy, deference, and hierarchy among the society members.

Recorded conversation was then transcribed into written form, classified and codified according to the <b>speech</b> <b>levels,</b> and analyzed using politeness system (Scollon and Scollon, 2001) and status scale (Homes, 2001).                                                                        The use of <b>speech</b> <b>levels</b> shows asymmetric communication: two speakers use two different codes, i. e. ngoko and krama because of power (+P) and with/without distance (+/-D), and it is the reflection of hierarchical politeness. The asymmetrical use of ngoko and krama by God and His Angel, God and human beings strongly explicated the asymmetrical communication between superiors and inferiors. The finding of the research shows that the use of ngoko and krama could present the phenomena of code-switching, code-mixing, and the fundamental phenomenon is ‘code-crossing’. It is concluded that hierarchical politeness in Javanese is ‘social contract’ i. e. the acknowledgment of the existence of high class (superior) and low class (inferior)  implemented in ‘communications contract’  using <b>speech</b> <b>levels</b> of the Javanese language  in line with status scale. Asymmetrical use of ngoko and krama indexed inequality, hierarchy, and harmony</p...|$|R

5000|$|... === <b>Speech</b> <b>levels</b> === Sasak has {{a system}} of <b>speech</b> <b>levels</b> in which {{different}} words are used, depending on the social level of the addressee relative to the speaker. The system {{is similar to that}} of Balinese and Javanese (languages spoken on neighbouring islands) and Korean. There are three levels in Sasak for the status of the addressee (low, mid- and high), and a humble-honorific dimension which notes the relationship between the speaker and another referent. For example, [...] "you" [...] may be expressed as kamu (low-level), side (mid-), pelinggih (high) or dekaji (honorific). [...] "To eat" [...] is mangan (low), bekelór (mid-), madaran (high) or majengan (honorific).|$|R

Among abundant vernacular languages spoken by various ethnic groups in Indonesia, Madurese language spoken by Madurese inhabitants is worth investigating due to its peculiarity. There are three <b>speech</b> <b>levels</b> of Madurese language namely Énjék Iyéh (Bâsa Andhâp/Low Level), Énggê Éntén (Bâsa Tenga’an/Mid-Level), and Enggi Buntén (Bâsa Tenggi/High <b>Level).</b> These different <b>speech</b> <b>levels</b> determine the use of different lexicons based on {{the setting of the}} conversation and the participants’ social role and age. This vernacular has four dialects divided based on their regencies namely Sumenep, Pamekasan, Sampang, and Bangkalan. Among the four dialects, Bangkalan is the most well-known for its frequent use of Énjék Iyéh variety. However, Enggi Buntén is still used when talking to more educated people such as Kyai and teachers, when talking to the respected elders, or when talking to strangers. This study aims at (1) elaborating the <b>speech</b> <b>levels</b> of Madurese language, particularly Bangkalan dialect, used in different settings by speakers of different social statuses and ages and (2) explaining the different lexicons used in each of those settings.

The samples are grouped into 12 groups based on the variable of occupation, age, and gender, and each group consists of 14 people. Besides, one representative from each group is chosen as language informant to be interviewed. The result of this study shows that the speakers’ attitude toward Balinese <b>speech</b> <b>levels</b> tend to be uniform regardless {{of the differences in}} occupation, age, and gender.

In Japanese <b>speech</b> <b>levels</b> {{a polite}} form {{is known as}} Keego which {{consists}} of Sonkeigo, Kenjoogo and Teineigo. In Javanese, such a form is called Undak-usuk. It consists of Ngoko (devided into Ngoko Lugu, Antya Basa, and Basa Antya), Madya (devided into Madya Ngoko, Madyantara, and Madya Krama), and Krama (devided into Mudha Krama, Kramantara, and Wreda Krama). Based {{on the results of}} contrastive analysis used in this paper, it was found out that there are similiarities as well as differences between Keigo and Undak-usuk. Both of them have honorific forms as well as a humble forms. The difference is that in Japanese there are two concepts known as Uchi and Soto. This means that Japanese pay attention to who a speaker is talking to and who is being discussed. Another difference is that Ngoko can not be contrasted with Keigo. Krama Inggil and Krama Andhap do not belong to <b>speech</b> <b>levels.</b> Both are lexicons giving varieties to the existing <b>speech</b> <b>levels,</b> whereas Sonkeigo and Kenjoogo are parts of Keigo...|$|R

40|$|Speech {{intelligibility}} {{is known}} to be mainly determined by the signal-to-noise level difference at a listener, and reverberation. It is directly related to signal-to-noise level difference and is inversely related to the reverberation time. However, their interaction results in a complicated situation in real rooms. Increased reverberation benefits speech intelligibility by increasing <b>speech</b> <b>levels.</b> Noise is also affected by the reverberation time, as are the <b>speech</b> <b>levels.</b> Thus, the spatial relationship between a listener and the sound sources- both speech and noise-affects the optimal reverberation for speech intelligibility in rooms [1].
