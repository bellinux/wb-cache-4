40|$|Optimization of {{the steady}} state {{economic}} efficiency of an industrial {{process is a}} specific task because the decision variables of the optimization (setpoints of the control system) affect the process through the control strategy. Thus, the effects of saturation of a control system {{must be taken into}} account when the gradient of the objective function is estimated and the necessary optimality conditions are checked. In particular, because the optimality conditions cannot be checked directly in the presence of active constraints on the manipulated variables, approximations of the <b>steady</b> <b>state</b> <b>values</b> of the manipulated variables as functions of the setpoints (static plant model) are needed in order to be able to evaluate the optimality conditions. In this paper an iterative method for optimization of the plant profit rate is proposed avoiding the control saturation and is applied to the Pulp Mill benchmark model optimization. Three different static models describing the <b>steady</b> <b>state</b> <b>values</b> of the manipulated variables are constructed and used in the optimization.

40|$|A {{critical}} (<b>steady</b> <b>state)</b> <b>value</b> of the conductivity {{of different}} coatings {{was determined by}} a combination of optical shearography and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The behavior of organic coatings, i. e., ACE Premium-grey Enamel, white Enamel, beige Enamel (spray coatings), a yellow Acrylic Lacquer, and a gold Nail Polish, on a metallic alloy, i. e., a carbon steel, was investigated over a temperature range of 20 - 60 0 C. The value of the conductivity of coatings was obtained by correlating the in plane displacement of the coatings, from optical shearography, and by the alternating current (AC) impedance (resistance) of the coatings, from the EIS. The integrity of the coatings with respect to time was assessed by comparison the measured conductivity to the critical (<b>steady</b> <b>state)</b> or asymptotic <b>value</b> of conductivity. By shearography, measurement of coating properties could be performed independent of parameters such as UV exposure, humidity, presence of chemical species, and other parameters which may normally interfere with conventional methods of the assessing of the integrity of coatings. Therefore, one may measure the critical (<b>steady</b> <b>state)</b> <b>value</b> of the conductivity of coatings, regardless {{of the history of the}} coating, in order to assess the integrity of coatings. In this investigation, the obtained data of shearography were correlated with the data of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in 3 %NaCl solution in order to obtain the critical (<b>steady</b> <b>state)</b> <b>value</b> of the conductivity of coatings...|$|R

We develop here a crosstalk fault model based on the consideration of usual distributed coupling capacitance and RLGC parasitics of interconnects in addition to mutual conductance (resistive bridging) {{in order to deal}} the crosstalk influence. Here, we estimate the crosstalk influence for worst case input signal combinations on aggressors, which induce more crosstalk on single victim. Our model helps the System-on-Chip (SoC) designers by providing sufficient insights into Signal Integrity problems.
