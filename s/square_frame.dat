5|$|Chinese {{characters}} {{conform to}} a roughly <b>square</b> <b>frame</b> {{and are not}} usually linked to one another, so {{do not have a}} preferred direction of writing. Traditionally Chinese text was written in vertical columns which were read from top to bottom, right-to-left; the first column being {{on the right side of}} the page, and the last column on the left. Text written in Classical Chinese also uses little or no punctuation, with sentence and phrase breaks are determined by context and rhythm. Vertical Chinese is still used for effect or where space requires it, such as signs or on spines of books.|$|E
5|$|The {{church is}} built from rubble masonry with very large boulder quoins; {{the roof is}} made from slate with stone copings. The {{main part of the}} church is 45feet 6inches long by 15feet 3inches wide (13.87 by 4.65m); the annexe at the west end {{measures}} 20feet 6inches by 15feet 6inches (6.25 by 4.72m). At the west end of the roof of the nave, there is a bellcote with a single bell decorated with three bull heads, dated 1661; at the east end, there is a cross. There is no structural division between the nave and the chancel. The annexe at the west end is smaller and lower in height than the main building, and was built in line with it. It may have been built for use as a schoolroom. It has a 16th-century doorway at the west end, converted into a window in the 19th century, and a modern door at the east end, as well as an 18th-century fireplace. The main entrance into the church is {{on the north side of}} the nave, dating from the late 15th century. The doorway is pointed, in a <b>square</b> <b>frame.</b>|$|E

25|$|It {{was during}} the late 1970s that he {{produced}} the Wave Series, abandoning the shaped canvas for the <b>square</b> <b>frame,</b> although order and symmetry remained the operative logic. This {{was followed by the}} Frequency series in the early 1980s, a truncated variant of the wave motif. Here, the illusion of three-dimensionality emerged as an interest of his. He also explored chromatic ranges in the Colour Theory series during this period.|$|E
25|$|The network used {{a colored}} {{variation}} of the 1967 logo when color television introduced and they relaunched operations in 1986, after 14 years of forced closure under martial law. The logo had the three rings detached from the transmitter and colored the three rings in red, green, and blue, and substituted the <b>square</b> <b>frame</b> with an outlined black box. The RGB-colored logo has remained relatively unchanged since then, though two modifications in 1993 (the 40th anniversary of Philippine TV) and 1996 (ABS-CBN's 50th corporate anniversary) saw minor tweaks in the letters and the rings and box.|$|E

The entablature frieze has 17 figures, {{including}} biblical {{characters and}} the Sibyls. Also present are animal figures, while a restoration in 2002 showed traces of a fresco. The main portal of the Romanesque church is now moved to the sacristy.|$|R
25|$|A {{modified}} version of ABS' symbol was launched in 1963, composed of a triangle denoting a transmitter tower and four circles denoting its signals (in the same vein as the 1953 logo), enclosed in a rounded box and with the ABS-CBN text above, {{in a form that}} would evolve over the years. The logo soon after took on its current iteration—a vertical line, denoting a transmitter tower, with three concentric circles signifying Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao, enclosed in a <b>square</b> <b>frame,</b> in 1967. At that time, it was rendered in black and white because color TV (despite {{the fact that it was}} ABS-CBN that introduced it the previous year) wasn't common yet and the logo style at that time separated ABS and CBN's names, putting ABS' name on top and CBN's on the bottom.|$|E
25|$|Some of the {{earliest}} evidence of water wells are located in China. The neolithic Chinese discovered and made extensive use of deep drilled groundwater for drinking. The Chinese text The Book of Changes , originally a divination text of the Western Zhou dynasty (1046 -771 BC), contains an entry describing how the ancient Chinese maintained their wells and protected their sources of water. Archaeological evidence and old Chinese documents reveal that the prehistoric and ancient Chinese had the aptitude and skills for digging deep water wells for drinking water as as early as 6000 to 7000 years ago. A well excavated at the Hemedu excavation site was {{believed to have been}} built during the neolithic era. The well was cased by four rows of logs with a <b>square</b> <b>frame</b> attached to them {{at the top of the}} well. 60 additional tile wells southwest of Beijing are also believed to have been built around 600 BC for drinking and irrigation. Plumbing is also known to have been used in East Asia since the Qin and Han Dynasties of China.|$|E

50|$|Starting in the 1970s, Leland's {{contemporary}} Norman Carlberg produced {{groups of}} <b>square</b> <b>framed</b> prints which he placed {{together on a}} wall in a tight grid, each print conceived as an independent module. The viewer is then invited to rotate or reposition them to generate new composite images. The abstract quality of the prints enhanced the creative possibilities of their re-orientation insofar as they are non-directional and geometrically inter-related.|$|R
500|$|The south porch {{has been}} {{described}} as [...] "unusually long"; it measures 11feet 6inches by 8feet 9inches (3.5 by 2.7m) and {{has been used as a}} vestry since the external doorway was blocked off and converted into a window. The 14th-century doorway from the nave into the vestry has a pointed head in a <b>square</b> <b>frame,</b> and was described in the 1937 survey as having an [...] "unusual design". The porch roof may be from the late medieval period.|$|E

500|$|In the machine's {{original}} 1868 design, {{paper was}} placed horizontally {{on the top}} of the machine, held in place by a movable <b>square</b> <b>frame</b> (to provide line and letter spacing). Above the paper and centered on the device, an arm held an inked ribbon which crossed over a small metal plate. Depressing a key caused a typebar to rise from underneath the paper, pressing the paper upwards against the ribbon and thus printing an inked character. This method of imprinting required use of very thin, nonstandard paper (such as tissue paper). Two variants were produced with alternative methods of actuating the typebars: one in which the keys and typebars were connected by a series of wires and one in which the keys directly [...] "kicked" [...] the typebars upwards.|$|E

50|$|Born in Copenhagen, Møller {{studied at}} the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts under Gottfred Eickhoff and Richard Mortensen (1962-66). In the 1960s, {{together}} with Hein Heinsen and Stig Brøgger, {{he was one of}} those who brought American trends in Minimalism to Denmark. Working towards an improved perception of space, they produced a number of rectilinear works including Fire kvadradiske rammer (Four <b>Square</b> <b>Frames,</b> 1966) and Fredens Port (Gate of Peace, 1982).|$|R
