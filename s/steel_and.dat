The {{purpose is to}} study the appropriatenesses of the structure formation and properties, to develop the rapid isothermal and cyclic temperature influences during tempering (ageing treatment) of quenched <b>steels</b> <b>and</b> alloys. The notions of the structure state of various <b>steels</b> <b>and</b> non-ferrous metals after short-time high-temperature and cyclic influences are extended. The correlation between their structure characteristics and properties is shwon. Optimum conditions for cyclic heat treatments of some <b>steels</b> <b>and</b> non-ferrous alloys which allow to reduce the heat treatment duration and so to decrease the furnace running time while the properties remain or improve are determined. The duration of heat treatment process is shortened, the heating equipment is releasedwhile the properties improveAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|R
