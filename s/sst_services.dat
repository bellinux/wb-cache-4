40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the capabilities of}} a Space-Based Space Surveillance (SBSS) demonstration mission for Space Surveillance and Tracking (SST) based on a micro- satellite platform. The results have been produced {{in the frame of}} ESA’s "As sessment Study for Space Based Space Surveillance Demonstration Mission (Phase A) " performed by the Airbus DS consortium. Space Surveillance and Tracking is part of Space Situational Awareness (SSA) and covers the detection, tracking and cataloguing of spa ce debris and satellites. Derived <b>SST</b> <b>services</b> comprise a catalogue of these man-made objects, collision warning, detection and characterisation of in-orbit fragmentations, sub-catalogue debris characterisation, etc. The assessment of SBSS in an SST system architecture has shown that both an operational SBSS and also already a well - designed space-based demonstrator can provide substantial performance in terms of surveillance and tracking of beyond - LEO objects. Especially the early deployment of a demonstrator, possible by using standard equipment, could boost initial operating capability and create a self-maintained object catalogue. Unlike classical technology demonstration missions, the primary goal is the demonstration and optimisation of the functional elements in a complex end-to-end chain (mission planning, observation strategies, data acquisition, processing and fusion, etc.) until the final products can be offered to the users. The presented SBSS system concept takes the ESA SST System Requirements (derived within the ESA SSA Preparatory Program) into account and aims at fulfilling some of the SST core requirements in a stand-alone manner. The evaluation of the concept has shown that an according solution can be implemented with low technological effort and risk. The paper presents details of the system concept, candidate micro - satellite platforms, the observation strategy and the results of performance simulations for GEO coverage and cataloguing accurac...|$|E

Supersonic services from Paris (CDG) to Washington Dulles International Airport began on 24 May 1976, also with F-BVFA. Service to New York (JFK) – {{the only remaining}} Concorde service until its end – commenced on 22 November 1977. Paris to New York was flown in 3 hours 23 minutes, at about twice the speed of sound. Approval for flights to the United States was initially withheld due to noise protests. Eventually, services to Mexico City via Washington, D.C. were started. Air France became {{one of only two}} airlines – British Airways being the other – to regularly operate supersonic services, and continued daily transatlantic Concorde service until late May 2003.|$|R
40|$|Innovations in {{technology}} and service design have increasingly enabled firms to incorporate self-service technology to augment or substitute for "traditional" employee-provided service channels. Although {{it is clear that}} self-service can reduce cost, less is known about how customers utilize self-service channels in a multichannel service delivery system and the resulting impact on firm performance. An important aspect of service operations is that customers are coproducers of the service. Thus, the performance of the delivery system and customers' use of service channels can be affected by customers' own efficiency or productivity in service coproduction (customer efficiency). In this paper, we utilize prior theoretical frameworks in service operations and economics to hypothesize relationships among customer characteristics (especially coproduction efficiency), channel utilization, and firm performance. We then test these hypotheses using panel data from a large retail bank. Overall, we find that higher customer efficiency in self-service channels is associated with greater profitability and has a complex relationship with customer retention and product utilization. service operations management, service delivery system, self-service technology (<b>SST),</b> <b>service</b> coproduction, customer efficiency...|$|R
40|$|The {{adopting}} of self-service technologies (SST) has {{for years}} {{been used as}} a vehicle for delivering service in aim to create value. The popularity of SST has recently increased within organizations and suppliers struggle to persuade customers to adopt the technique in order to co-create value for both customer and supplier. Previous research has covered this type of technology and its effects on service delivery in a business to consumer (B 2 C) perspective but it is relative undiscovered in the context of business to business (B 2 B). By studying the B 2 B relation within SST and the effects on value and value creation this paper identifies three value clusters at the supplier perspective and three at the customer perspective. At each perspective our result shows that there are two positive and one negative value clusters. These clusters can help organizations with both preventive actions and management of the negatives by seeing how relationships between values and value creation exist.

The research has two purposes: (l) To determine how perceived risk impacts {{on the use of}} SSTs for customers with a high and a low technology readiness index (TRI) and (2) To understand the types of perceived risks within the banking industry and which component of risk dominates customer's propensity to use SSTs. The research focuses on the retail bank <b>SSTs</b> <b>services</b> for the reason that the banking industry has the longest development history in SSTs. The research was conducted using a questionnaire containing two service scenarios (bank information search, fund/money transfer) and was distributed to 372 bank customers, of which a valid sample of 307 respondents was analyzed. The test results indicate the effect of perceived risk does exist. High perceived risk influences high TRI customers to lower their propensity to use the SSTs in the funds transfer and money transfer service scenario, whereas customers with low TRI will tend to lower their propensity to use SSTs in the funds transfer, money transfer and other services. Psychological risk was also identified as the dominant influential risk factor among the respondents. The results support the research hypotheses and highlight the importance for companies to manage perceived risk in this technological era...|$|R
40|$|Consumersatisfaction is {{fundamental}} to organisational success. It is well recognised that personal service is important in achieving consumer satisfaction. However, the application of self-service technology (SST) is widcning and is attennuating traditional exchanges between consumers and service employees. The effect of this reduction of personal service on consumer satisfaction judgements is not well understood. This study addresses this gap by investigating the relative effects of <b>SST</b> and personal <b>service</b> attributes on overall consumer satisfaction. Thc study highlights important service attributes applicable to <b>SST</b> and personal <b>service.</b> The conceptual framework is tested using data collected from 241 leisure and business travellers drawn from premium hotels in a regional area.

The rapidly growing Indian retail sector, emerging innovative store-based technologies (like kiosks), and extensive progress in adopting new technologies by consumers all present a pressing {{need to understand}} Indian consumers 2 ̆ 7 views on acceptance and use of self-service technologies (SSTs). A model integrating the cultural-self perspective and {{a modified version of}} the Technology Acceptance Model was developed to explain the influence of culture and motivation factors on Indian consumers 2 ̆ 7 attitude toward <b>SSTs.</b> Familiarity and <b>service</b> perception of <b>SSTs</b> were introduced as moderators in the relationship between motivation factors and attitude towards SSTs. Data collectors trained in mall-intercept techniques were employed to approach Indian mall shoppers in Bangalore and Delhi. A total of 302 completed surveys were used for statistical analysis. Results from the present study show that Indian consumers do not conform to any one single cultural group and vary from being an individual- to a relational- to a collective-self person in their present shopping environments. In addition, the results indicate that perceived enjoyment is the most important criterion for SST use. Additionally, the sample of urban and educated Indian consumers was not anxious about using technology; rather, they were receptive to new technology innovations. Lastly, the proposed moderators, familiarity with <b>SST</b> <b>service</b> and <b>service</b> perception of <b>SSTs,</b> were not found to be significantly related to SST adoption. In this study, educated and employed Indian urban consumers sought enjoyment in their interaction with SSTs as opposed to timesaving and usefulness. It is therefore suggested that effective marketing communication strategies focus on the entertainment or pleasure aspects of using SSTs. The Indian consumers in this study were enthusiastic to learn new SSTs without prior familiarity; they were willing to overcome any anxiety they might have towards new technology adoption. Therefore, retail managers would be wise to focus on training employees to support customers in the transition from employee-assisted services to self-service. To provide maximum customer service, managers should be trained to integrate the right SSTs to retain customers by providing faster, and more efficient and enjoyable service, which could increase profits as well as store loyalty. This study contributes to the growing knowledge base about consumers 2 ̆ 7 shopping behaviors in relation to SSTs and fills a gap in the literature about the potential for SST use in the Indian retail environment. Findings can aid retailers looking to enhance their service offerings by providing an additional means for customers to purchase merchandise in the store.

50|$|A {{supersonic}} transport (SST) is a civilian supersonic aircraft designed to transport passengers at speeds {{greater than the}} speed of sound. To date, the only SSTs to see regular service have been Concorde and the Tupolev Tu-144. The last passenger flight of the Tu-144 was in June 1978 and it was last flown in 1999 by NASA. Concorde's last commercial flight was in October 2003, with a November 26, 2003 ferry flight being its last airborne operation.

40|$|Objectives of {{the study}} Self-service {{technology}} (SST) is rapidly expanding to situations where personal service {{used to be the}} only service delivery option. Despite the potential benefits for service providers, such as cost savings and improved efficiency, the implementation of SST is not successful if customers constantly choose personal service instead of self-service. While struggling with low utilization rates, service providers need further understanding how customers select between <b>SST</b> and personal <b>service</b> in situations where both options are available. The objective of this exploratory study is to deepen the understanding of customers’ selection between <b>SST</b> and personal <b>service.</b> The research setting is in a grocery store where the selection is made between a self-service checkout (SCO) and a traditional checkout. Besides concentrating on the reasoning behind the selection, the research focus is also on the actual reasons. Using dual-process theories as a framework, fast, intuitive, and unconscious (System 1) decisions are compared to slow, deliberate, and conscious ones (System 2). Academic background and methodology The theoretical background of this qualitative study relies on self-service technology acceptance research and dual-process theories. The sample is collected in three supermarket grocery stores with a combination of non-participant observations and semi-structured interviews. The respondents are chosen randomly between SCO and traditional checkout users. Findings and conclusions This study indicates that the reasoning and reasons for checkout selection vary among the grocery store customers. Mainly based on the selected checkout (SCO/traditional) and the reasoning behind it (System 1 /System 2), four customer groups were discovered: habitual SCO users, habitual traditional checkout users, situational users, and customers with no decision possibility. Unlike the group of habitual users who automatically select between the checkout options, situational users consider both a 1 lternatives and make the selection based on the current situation. Customers with no decision possibility were forced to use traditional checkout this time, usually because the cash payment is not available with SSTs. The findings suggests that in order to improve SST utilization rates, the encouragement and influence strategies should be customized for each customer group. The provided recommendations are useful for retailers and other service providers that have already implemented SST solutions or are planning {{to do so in the}} future...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} decade, the {{proliferation}} of self-service technologies (<b>SSTs)</b> in <b>service</b> industries has attracted considerable scholarly attention. An abundance of research has investigated how customers evaluate a new SST and what drives the initial trial. However, {{little is known about}} how customers interact with and adapt to an SST following their first experience. It is argued that while the initial trial is a critical step in the adoption process, the long term viability of an SST and its eventual success depend on its regular use. Therefore, in order to fill the literature gap and shed light on the issue, this research is undertaken with an overall objective to investigate customers&# 146; post-adoption experience with an SST from a longitudinal perspective. To understand this complex, dynamic phenomenon, three specific research objectives are proposed and three empirical studies are conducted in Australia with recently installed supermarket self-checkout kiosks as the focal SST under examination. Study 1 explores situational influences on customers&# 146; choice between self-service and personal service. Through interview and observation, it is found that customers&# 146; choice is influenced by three major situational factors: perceived waiting time, perceived task complexity, and companion influence. Results also show that past experiences influence SST attitudes and behaviours in a more complex manner than SST characteristics and other individual difference variables. Study 2 uses a longitudinal design to examine in particular how habit, self-efficacy, and satisfaction impact on continued SST usage over time. The results show that, as experience accumulates and learning occurs, customers&# 146; decision to continue using an SST is initially rational driven (self-efficacy), then largely emotional driven (satisfaction), and finally becomes habitual (habit). Study 3 adopts an econometric modelling approach to focus on how a habit of SST usage is developed and what drives its formation. The results indicate a significant carryover effect, suggesting that habit is formed cumulatively. In addition to satisfaction and self-efficacy that have been examined in Study 2, past usage (frequency and recency) and need for interaction are also found to impact on habit development. Furthermore, the findings reveal some gender differences in habit development...|$|R

To understand {{the way in which}} Internet technology has impacted these B 2 B services, it is essential to examine its impact not only on business processes but on business relationships too. One technology, enabled by modern Internet technologies, which is changing the nature of business relationships is the increased use of self-service technologies (<b>SSTs)</b> or technology-enabled <b>services,</b> however, {{there is a shortage of}} research in the area in a B 2 B context.

The findings of this study provide evidence that while traditional Relationship Marketing theory is still applicable for some business customers, new theory is required for business customers who do not seek relationships. With both practical and theoretical implications, the research detailed in this paper makes a useful contribution to the literature and indicates the necessity for further research to be developed which explores business customers who prefer to remain transaction-oriented, rather than develop interpersonal relationships...|$|R

From ordering their favorite meal on the <b>SST</b> in quick <b>service</b> restaurants to the purchase of airline tickets online, customers are becoming much more adept at customising and personalising their consumer and purchasing experiences. It is estimated that utilisation of smart, connected products will have far reaching benefits for companies who deliver them and for the broader economy as businesses and customers gain advantage from enhanced productivity (Porter and Heppelmann, 2014). Companies within the Service Sector can utilise SST {{in order to build}} up customer relationships and generate higher profits (Fleming and Artis, 2010). While much research has been published about the estimated value delivered to firms from the introduction of new technologies the researcher will seek to demonstrate the ‘value perceptions’ customers attribute to the introduction of technology within a fast food environment. During the research the author carried out a comprehensive review of previous literature relating to the adoption of technology. Resultantly the research found that the following elements are important when undertaking an evaluation of this type: Rogers’ (1983) Diffusion of Innovation Theory (DIT) outlined relative advantage, compatibility, complexity, trialability and observability as factors influencing an individual’s propensity to adopt new innovations. In contrast to DIT, Davis (2003) posits that the probability of an individual adopting new technology can be enhanced when the following two factors are realised: the perceived ease of use (PEOU) and perceived usefulness (PU) to the individual. Additionally, previous research conducted by Kim et al.

Health impact assessment and economic evaluation using a dynamic model over a ten-year period and according to two cycling promotion scenarios. Cycling to work or school in Florence, Italy. All individuals aged 15 and older commuting to work or school in Florence. The primary outcome measures were changes in NCD incidence and healthcare direct costs for the Tuscany Regional Health <b>Service</b> (<b>SST)</b> due to increased cycling. The secondary outcome was change in road traffic accidents. Increasing cycling modal share in Florence from 7. 5 % to about 17 % (Scenario 1) or 27 % (Scenario 2) could decrease the incidence of type 2 diabetes by 1. 2 % or 2. 5 %, and the incidence of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and stroke by 0. 6 % or 1. 2 %. Within 10 years, {{the number of cases}} that can be prevented is 280 or 549 for type 2 diabetes, 51 or 100 for AMI, and 51 or 99 for stroke in Scenario 1 or Scenario 2, respectively. Average annual discounted savings for the SST are estimated to amount to € 400, 804 or € 771, 201 in Scenario 1 or Scenario 2, respectively. In Florence, due to the high use of vulnerable motorized vehicles (such as scooters, mopeds, and motorcycles), road traffic accidents are expected to decline in both our scenarios. Sensitivity analyses showed that health benefits and savings for the SST are substantial, the most sensitive parameters being the relative risk estimates of NCDs and active commuting. Effective policies and programs to promote a modal shift towards cycling among students and workers in Florence will contribute to reducing the NCD burden and helping long-term economic sustainability of the SST...|$|R
