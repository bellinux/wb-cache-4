40|$|With burgeoning caseloads and {{persistent}} vacancies in many federal courts, <b>senior</b> <b>judges</b> {{play a vital}} role in the continued well-being of our federal judiciary. Despite the importance of their participation in the judicial process, however, <b>senior</b> <b>judges</b> raise a host of constitutional concerns that have escaped the notice of scholars and courts. Many of the problems originate with recent changes to the statute authorizing federal <b>judges</b> to elect <b>senior</b> status, including a 1989 law that permits <b>senior</b> <b>judges</b> to fulfill their statutory responsibilities by performing entirely nonjudicial work. Others arise from the ambiguity of the statutory scheme itself, which seems to suggest that senior status represents a separate constitutional office, requiring reappointment, even though <b>senior</b> <b>judges</b> nominally retain judicial office under federal law. In the first scholarly article addressing the constitutionality of <b>senior</b> <b>judges,</b> the authors examine two general constitutional objections: (1) whether the requirement that <b>senior</b> <b>judges</b> be designated and assigned by another federal judge before performing any judicial work violates the tenure protection of Article III; and (2) whether allowing <b>judges</b> to elect <b>senior</b> status, without a second intervening appointment, violates the Appointments Clause. They also examine whether two specific types of <b>senior</b> <b>judges</b> - the bureaucratic <b>senior</b> <b>judge</b> who performs only administrative duties and the itinerant <b>senior</b> <b>judge</b> who sits exclusively on courts outside his home district or circuit - violate the Constitution. The authors conclude that the current statute authorizing <b>senior</b> <b>judges</b> raises serious constitutional problems that should be addressed by Congress or the Judicial Conference of the United States. In that respect, they formulate a number of straightforward suggestions to repair senior status without having to sacrifice any of the considerable benefits that <b>senior</b> <b>judges</b> have conferred on the federal judiciary over the years...|$|R

In that year, <b>senior</b> <b>judges</b> began a successful campaign to vote reformer Chief Judge Hershey out of office, and replace her with hardliner Judge Francisco.|$|R
