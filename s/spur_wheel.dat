5|$|An enquiry {{into the}} crash was hastily set up. The commission's report (Aktenzeichen 52, Br.B.Nr. 270/42) {{concluded}} that the crash was caused by damage to the differential gear, which caused an oil leak. Then a number of teeth broke off the <b>spur</b> <b>wheel</b> and ignited the oil. Sabotage or human error was ruled out. The aircraft, W. Nr. 14256, was ferried to the unit via Bari, Italy. The mission that ended in its destruction was its first mission.|$|E

50|$|Wylam Dilly is {{the second}} oldest {{surviving}} railway locomotive in the world; it was built circa 1815 by William Hedley and Timothy Hackworth for Christopher Blackett, the owner of Wylam colliery, west of Newcastle upon Tyne. Wylam Dilly was initially designed for and used on the Wylam Waggonway to transport coal. The four driving wheels are connected by a train of <b>spur</b> <b>wheels</b> driven by a central crankshaft.|$|R
50|$|The valves have a {{detachable}} cover {{over each}} valve giving easy access for adjusting seating or complete withdrawal. Between the cams and tappets there are fingers {{which can be}} set with the engine running. There is a similar arrangement for the ignition tappets. However {{the timing of the}} ignition can be varied with a lever above the steering wheel. The lever moves a timing shaft which moves the tappet pivot-pins inward or outward. The axis of the commutator shaft rocks at the same time. This arrangement brought about oil sealing problems when pressure lubrication became more complicated. The <b>spur</b> <b>wheels</b> that operate the two camshafts are enclosed in a neat dust-proof casing.|$|R

25|$|Upthorpe Mill is a {{post mill}} on a {{single-storey}} roundhouse. It has {{two pairs of}} Double Patent sails carried on a wooden windshaft with a cast-iron poll end. This carries a wooden brake wheel with iron segment teeth, driving a cast-iron wallower mounted on a wooden upright shaft. The cast iron great <b>spur</b> <b>wheel</b> drives two pairs of underdrift millstones. The tail stones were driven by belt. The tail of the mill has been extended to provide room for a wire machine. The eight bladed Fantail is mounted on the rear ladder in the Suffolk style and drove both wheels by means of gears and shafts. The main post carries the inscription R Rix 1807.|$|E
25|$|Gears {{inside a}} {{windmill}} convey {{power from the}} rotary motion of the sails to a mechanical device. The sails are carried on the horizontal windshaft. Windshafts can be wholly made of wood, or wood with a cast iron poll end (where the sails are mounted) or entirely of cast iron. The brake wheel is fitted onto the windshaft between {{the front and rear}} bearing. It has the brake around the outside of the rim and teeth {{in the side of the}} rim which drive the horizontal gearwheel called wallower on the top end of the vertical upright shaft. In grist mills, the great <b>spur</b> <b>wheel,</b> lower down the upright shaft, drives one or more stone nuts on the shafts driving each millstone. Post mills sometimes have a head and/or tail wheel driving the stone nuts directly, instead of the spur gear arrangement. Additional gear wheels drive a sack hoist or other machinery.|$|E
500|$|The {{ground floor}} of the mill is the meal floor. It is where the freshly ground flour is {{delivered}} for bagging up. The wooden great <b>spur</b> <b>wheel,</b> located {{at the bottom of}} the extended upright shaft and stone nuts are located on this floor. The great <b>spur</b> <b>wheel</b> has been converted from compass arm construction to clasp arm construction. A third pair of [...] diameter French Burr millstones is located on a hurst frame, driven by the auxiliary engine via a fast and loose pulley.|$|E

The NYA also received permission from the LIRR, which owns most of the tracks on which NYA operates, to handle cars weighing up to 286,000 lb, the top load limit for railroads in the eastern U.S. The previous LIRR limit was 263,000 lb.|$|R
50|$|On power cars, spoked wheels with {{separate}} steel tires are used; the tires have an outer diameter of 105 cm (1050 mm) and a thickness of 75 mm. The tires are shrunk onto the wheels, {{which are in}} turn shrunk onto the axle. One of the wheels on each axle has an elongated hub, which is attached with bolts to the large <b>spur</b> gear. The <b>wheels</b> of the trailer cars are smaller in size (only 95 cm in diameter), solid, have shorter hubs and a thinner axle.|$|R

The moment they met, the combat was opened, and for a time nothing was heard but the thunderous clashing and clamor of blows, now and then beating intermittently, now and then pausing. Occasionally, as the combatants <b>spurred</b> together, checked, <b>wheeled,</b> and recovered, they would be hidden for a moment in a misty veil of dust, which, again {{drifting}} down the wind, perhaps revealed them drawn a little apart, resting their panting horses. Then, again, they would spur together, striking as they passed, wheeling and striking again.|$|R
500|$|Stembridge Mill is a tower mill, {{a type of}} {{windmill}} {{which consists}} of a brick or stone tower, on top of which sits a roof or cap which can be turned to bring the sails into the wind. The advantage of the tower mill over the earlier post mill {{is that it is}} not necessary to turn the whole mill ("body", [...] "buck") with all its machinery into the wind; this allows more space for the machinery and storage. In the earliest tower mills the cap was turned into the wind with a long tail-pole which stretched to the ground at the back of the mill. Later, a looping chain was used which turned the cap with gears, as is used at Stembridge. It is [...] by a wheel and chain. The windshaft is of wood, with a cast iron cross, which carries four common sails. The brake wheel is of clasp arm construction. No other machinery remains, since the wallower, upright shaft and great <b>spur</b> <b>wheel</b> were removed after the mill ceased to operate by wind ...|$|E
500|$|Off-site, the new {{brake wheel}} and fantail were made. The {{original}} brake wheel was too rotten to repair, and showed {{evidence that it}} had been altered from the original one installed in 1819. The original brake wheel was [...] diameter to allow the Common sails to run at their optimum speed. When the mill was modernised in 1832 it was necessary to alter the gear ratios within the mill, as Patent sails run at a slower speed than Common sails. The great <b>spur</b> <b>wheel</b> was increased in diameter and the stone nuts reduced in diameter. The brake wheel was also rebuilt, with a cast iron segment ring fitted in place of the original cogs, resulting in a wheel [...] in diameter. The opinion of professional millwrights was sought, and it was decided that a scaled-up version of the original brake wheel would be made, but retaining the cast iron teeth segments. The remains of the original brake wheel were retained as an exhibit in the mill. The original iron segments were all broken, so a pattern was made and new segments were cast in heat-treated malleable cast iron. When the brake wheel was completed it was dismantled and transported to the mill ready for reassembly.|$|E

40|$|The {{inspection}} {{of each individual}} tooth element of a <b>spur</b> gear <b>wheel</b> can be a tedious and expensive process. Two methods of composite gear testing are available, namely, the single flank rolling gear test and the dual flank rolling gear test. The first method is well documented, but the dual flank system tends to have been neglected, few papers being available on the subject. As a preliminary stage to {{the investigation into the}} dual flank testing technique two methods of pitch error measurement using ball ended contact probes are examined. These are :(i) the direct measurement of cumulative pitch measurement using a single contact probe and dividing arrangement and(ii) the span gauging of adjacent teeth, commercial measuring equipment being used in both cases. The two methods are compared theoretically in terms of the maximum cumulative pitch error of a gear, and their probable accuracy of measurement compared with the allowable pitch tolerances quoted in the relevant British Standard. Specifications, a theory for the dual flank test is developed relating the variation in centre distance of a pair of gears in close mesh to the errors in tooth pitch and involute profile. The validity of the theory- is tested by experimental measurements, on actual gears, and- a means of determining the permissible variation in the dual flank test error trace from the allowable tolerances on tooth pitch error and tooth profile error suggested. The identification of the type of elemental error from the pattern of the dual flank trace is also examined together with the limitations of the test...|$|R
