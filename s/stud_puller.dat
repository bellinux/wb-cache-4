50|$|The {{pull-off}} test, {{also called}} <b>stud</b> <b>pull</b> test is a near-to-surface method {{in which an}} adhesive connection is made between a stud and the carrier (or object to be tested) by using a glue, possibly an epoxy or polyester resin, that is stronger than the bond {{that needs to be}} tested. The force required to <b>pull</b> the <b>stud</b> from the surface, together with the carrier, is measured. Simple mechanical hand-operated loading equipment has been developed for this purpose. When higher accuracy is required, tests can be performed with more advanced equipment called a bond tester. A bond tester provides more control and possibly automation. Applying the glue automatically and curing with UV light is the next step in automation.|$|R
60|$|Curiosity {{prompted}} the ape-man to investigate his surroundings. Several metal-bound, copper-studded chests constituted the sole furniture {{of the round}} room. Tarzan let his hands run over these. He felt of the copper <b>studs,</b> he <b>pulled</b> upon the hinges, and at last, by chance, he raised the cover of one.|$|R

Olive (OD/OG) webbing {{of the same}} material (1000 D) is being incorporated, along {{with a variety of}} hard wearing plastic fasteners (ITW Nexus), Hook and loop fasteners (Velcro) and anti-magnetic press <b>stud</b> fasteners (<b>Pull</b> the Dot).|$|R
50|$|The NMTB tool shanks had the 7 in 24 taper, {{but they}} also had a {{constant}} diameter tail (pilot) {{at the end of}} the shank that was described in the 1927 patent. Subsequent design variations dropped the tail (making the shank shorter) and put a V-groove in the flange that aided automated tool changing. Modern designs started using power drawbars that gripped <b>pull</b> <b>studs</b> (also known as retention knobs) that were screwed into the tool shank rather than screw-in drawbars. The power drawbar would grip the <b>pull</b> <b>stud</b> rather than screwing into the tool shank.|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} {{experiments}} were carried out to investigate the adhesion properties and thermal stability of Cu/benzocyclobutene-divinyl tetramethyldisiloxane (BCB-DVS) interfaces by a <b>stud</b> <b>pull</b> test and cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy (TEM), respectively. Multilayered specimens were prepared by spin-coating a layer of BCB-DVS onto a Si wafer and subsequently a layer of Cu was deposited on the BCB-DVS by electron beam evaporation. It {{was found that the}} average bond strength of the Cu/BCB-DVS interface was improved slightly by either Ar ion bombardment of the BCB-DVS surface or a Ti interlayer between Cu and BCB-DVS. A significant improvement was obtained by a combination of Ar ion bombardment and a Ti interlayer, and resulted in the formation of titanium carbides or oxides between Ti and BCB-DVS. Upon annealing the specimens at 260 degrees C in vacuum for 18 h, interdiffusion of Cu into BCB-DVS to form clusters was observed, by cross-sectional TEM, for specimens with a 5 nm Ti interlayer, whereas the Cu island was not present in specimens with a 20 nm Ti interlayer. Interfacial reactions upon annealing were demonstrated by the formation of Cu 3 TiO 5 and Cu-Ti intermetallics, identified by selected area diffraction...|$|R
40|$|AbstractTFA-MOD derived YBCO {{tapes are}} {{expected}} for many applications due to cost-efficiency. In some applications, uniformity and mechanical strength {{are required for}} tapes. A 205 m-long YBCO tape was fabricated with high and uniform Ic performance throughout the tape by adopting the interim annealing before the conversion process. The effect of the interim annealing on the crystal growth mechanism of YBCO has been studied focusing {{on the relationship between}} the interim annealing conditions and delamination, in this work. Delamination strength was evaluated in the samples prepared with and without interim annealing by the <b>stud</b> <b>pull</b> method. Measurements were carried out on 50 different points for each sample and the results were analyzed statistically. The difference between the two samples was remarkably seen in the delamination strength below 60 MPa. The conventionally annealed sample had more points with low delamination strength below 60 MPa than the interim annealed one. The cross sectional images of both samples observed by SEM showed that there were few pores within the interim annealed superconducting layer, although conventional superconducting layer had many pores. These results suggest that the pores within YBCO layer might be origins to be propagated for delamination at low strength...|$|R
50|$|An {{improvement}} on CAT Tooling is BT Tooling, which looks similar and {{can easily be}} confused with CAT tooling. Like CAT Tooling, BT Tooling comes {{in a range of}} sizes and uses the same NMTB body taper. However, BT tooling is symmetrical about the spindle axis, which CAT tooling is not. This gives BT tooling greater stability and balance at high speeds. One other subtle difference between these two toolholders is the thread used to hold the <b>pull</b> <b>stud.</b> CAT Tooling is all Imperial thread and BT Tooling is all Metric thread. Note that this affects the <b>pull</b> <b>stud</b> only, it does not affect the tool that they can hold, both types of tooling are sold to accept both Imperial and metric sized tools.|$|R

50|$|For {{use with}} heavy loads (such as {{encountered}} by {{a milling machine}} spindle), there is usually a key to prevent rotation and/or a threaded section, which is engaged by a drawbar that engages either the threads or {{the head of a}} <b>pull</b> <b>stud</b> that is screwed into them. The drawbar is then tightened, drawing the shank firmly into the spindle. The draw-bar is important on milling machines as the transverse force component would otherwise cause the tool to wobble out of the taper.|$|R
5000|$|SK and HSK tooling, {{sometimes}} called [...] "Hollow Shank Tooling", {{is much more}} common in Europe where it was invented {{than it is in}} the United States. It is claimed that HSK tooling is even better than BT Tooling at high speeds. The holding mechanism for HSK tooling is placed within the (hollow) body of the tool and, as spindle speed increases, it expands, gripping the tool more tightly with increasing spindle speed. There is no <b>pull</b> <b>stud</b> with this type of tooling.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{the effects of}} post {{deposition}} heat treatments on the cohesive and adhesive strength properties of PS 304, a plasma sprayed nickel-chrome based, high temperature solid lubricant coating deposited on stainless steel, are studied. Plasma spray deposited coating samples were exposed in air at temperatures from 432 to 650 C for up to 500 hr to promote residual stress relief, enhance particle to particle bonding and increase coating to substrate bond strength. Coating pull-off strength was measured using a commercial adhesion tester that utilizes 13 mm diameter aluminum <b>pull</b> <b>studs</b> attached to the coating surface with epoxy. Pull off force was automatically recorded and converted to coating pull off strength. As deposited coating samples were also tested as a baseline. The as-deposited (untreated) samples either delaminated at the coating-substrate interface or failed internally (cohesive failure) at about 17 MPa. Samples heat treated at temperatures above 540 C for 100 hr or at 600 C or above for more than 24 hr exhibited strengths above 31 MPa, nearly a two fold increase. Coating failure occurred inside {{the body of the}} coating (cohesive failure) for nearly all of the heat-treated samples and only occasionally at the coating substrate interface (adhesive failure). Metallographic analyses of heat-treated coatings indicate that the Nickel-Chromium binder in the PS 304 appears to have segregated into two phases, a high nickel matrix phase and a high chromium precipitated phase. Analysis of the precipitates indicates the presence of silicon, a constituent of a flow enhancing additive in the commercial NiCr powder. The exact nature and structure of the precipitate phase is not known. This microstructural change is believed to be partially responsible for the coating strength increase. Diffusion bonding between particles may also be playing a role. Increasing the heat treatment temperature, exposure time or both accelerate the heat treatment process. Preliminary measurements indicate that the heat treatment also results in a one time, permanent coating thickness increase of about 3 %. Based upon these results, the incorporation of a heat treatment prior to final finishing has been incorporated in the application process of this coating technology...|$|R
