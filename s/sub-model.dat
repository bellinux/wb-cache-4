25|$|Suppose V is a {{model of}} ZFC. Either V {{contains}} no strong inaccessible or, taking κ to be the smallest strong inaccessible in V, Vκ is a standard model of ZFC which contains no strong inaccessibles. Thus, the consistency of ZFC implies consistency of ZFC+"there are no strong inaccessibles". Similarly, either V contains no weak inaccessible or, taking κ to be the smallest ordinal which is weakly inaccessible relative to any standard <b>sub-model</b> of V, then Lκ is a standard model of ZFC which contains no weak inaccessibles. So consistency of ZFC implies consistency of ZFC+"there are no weak inaccessibles". This shows that ZFC cannot prove the existence of an inaccessible cardinal, so ZFC is consistent with the non-existence of any inaccessible cardinals.|$|E
2500|$|The Series 3 (1984–1985) {{featured}} {{an updated}} lower front fascia. North American models received a different instrument cluster. GSL package was continued into this series, but Mazda introduced the GSL-SE <b>sub-model.</b> The GSL-SE had a fuel-injected 1.3L 13B RE-EGI engine producing 135hp (101kW) and [...] GSL-SEs had {{much the same}} options as the GSL (clutch-type rear LSD and rear disc brakes), but the brake rotors were larger, allowing Mazda to use the more common lug nuts (versus bolts), and a new bolt pattern of 4x114.3 (4x4.5"). Also, they had upgraded suspension with stiffer springs and shocks. The external oil cooler was reintroduced, after being dropped in the 1983 model-year for the controversial [...] "beehive" [...] water-oil heat exchanger.|$|E
40|$|Statistical {{models of}} shape and {{appearance}} are powerful tools for interpreting medical and other images. However there can remain problems with under-trained models being too constrained. We have combined a global {{model with a}} sequence of partially overlapping <b>sub-models,</b> {{in a manner that}} exploits all the statistical information, whilst mitigating the under-training problem. Instead of applying one global model, we use a global model to apply iteratively-updated soft constraints on a sequence of <b>sub-models.</b> These <b>sub-models</b> may also partially overlap, and thus previously fit <b>sub-models</b> can also impose soft constraints on the next iteration. The algorithm has been applied to dual x-ray absorptiometry scans of the spine in order to automate vertebral morphometry measurements, using overlapping triplets of vertebrae as the <b>sub-models,</b> together with a global model of the entire spine. Combining a global model in this way with a sequence of <b>sub-models</b> gives substantially better results than using the former alone. ...|$|R
40|$|Constraint models often {{describe}} complicated {{problems that}} contain sub-problems {{that could be}} solved in <b>sub-models.</b> Although pre-solving these <b>sub-models</b> might improve {{the performance of the}} model, manually splitting the model to accommodate the occurrences of these <b>sub-models</b> can be a great inconvenience for the modeler. This thesis introduces an approach to automate the process of solving <b>sub-models</b> and replacing them by constraints that provide more inference, based on the solutions found. An implementation of this approach is provided for the MiniZinc language, and using various examples we show how the strain of the implementation of pre-solving is moved from the modeler to the modeling toolchain...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} a novel technique which implements a spatiotemporal model {{as a set}} of <b>sub-models</b> based on first order logic. These <b>sub-models</b> model different, typically independent, parts of the dataset; for example different spatio or temporal contexts. To decide which submodels to use in different situations a context chooser is used. By separating the <b>sub-models</b> from where they are applied allows greater flexibility for the overall model. The <b>sub-models</b> are learnt using an evolutionary technique called Genetic Programming. The method has been applied to spatio-temporal data. This includes learning the rules of snap by observation, learning the rules of a traffic light sequence, and finally predicting a person’s course through a network of CCTV cameras. ...|$|R

Following Sims (2008), we treat nested <b>sub-models</b> as "probability models" and we formalize a procedure that ensures that <b>sub-models</b> are not discarded too easily and do matter for optimal policy.

40|$|International audienceUnderstanding the {{mechanisms}} {{and the time}} and spatial evolution of penumbra following an ischemic stroke is crucially important for developing therapeutics aimed at preventing this area from evolving towards infarction. To help in integrating the available data, we decided to build a formal model. We first collected and categorised the major available evidence from animal models and human observations and summarized this knowledge in a flow-chart with the potential key components of an evolving stroke. Components were grouped in ten <b>sub-models</b> that could be modelled and tested independently: the <b>sub-models</b> of tissue reactions, ionic movements, oedema development, glutamate excitotoxicity, spreading depression, NO synthesis, inflammation, necrosis, apoptosis, and reperfusion. Then, we figured out markers, identified mediators and chose the level of complexity to model these <b>sub-models.</b> We first applied this integrative approach to build a model based on cytotoxic oedema development following a stroke. Although this model includes only three <b>sub-models</b> and would need to integrate more mechanisms {{in each of these}} <b>sub-models,</b> the characteristics and the time and spatial evolution of penumbra obtained by simulation are qualitatively and, to some extent, quantitatively consistent with those observed using medical imaging after a permanent occlusion or after an occlusion followed by a reperfusion...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} a novel technique for learning predictive models from non-deterministic spatio-temporal data. Our technique learns {{a set of}} <b>sub-models</b> that model different, typically independent, aspects of the data. By using temporal relations, and implicit feature selection, based {{on the use of}} 1 st order logic expressions, we make the <b>sub-models</b> general, and robust to irrelevant variations in the data. We use Allen’s intervals [1], plus a set of four novel temporal state relations, which relate temporal intervals to the current time. These are added to the system as background knowledge in the form of functions. To combine the <b>sub-models</b> into a single model a context chooser is used. This probabilistically picks the most appropriate set of <b>sub-models</b> to predict in a certain context, and allows the system to predict in non-deterministic situations. The models are learnt using an evolutionary technique called Genetic Programming. The method has been applied to learning the rules of snap, and uno by observation; and predicting a person’s course through a network of CCTV cameras. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{deployment}} of oxy-fuel combustion in utility boilers {{is one of}} the major options for CO 2 capture. However, combustion under oxy-firing conditions differs from conventional air-firing combustion, e. g., in the aspect of radiative heat transfer, coal conversion and pollutants formation. In this work, a numerical study on pulverised coal combustion was conducted to verify the applicability and accuracy of several <b>sub-models</b> refined for oxy-fuel conditions, e. g., gaseous radiative property model, gas-phase combustion mechanism and heterogeneous char reaction model. The <b>sub-models</b> were implemented in CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) simulations of combustion of three coals under air-firing and various oxy-firing (21 – 35 % vol O 2 in O 2 /CO 2 mixture) conditions in an EFR (entrained flow reactor). The predicted coal burnouts and gaseous emissions were compared against experimental results. A good agreement between the simulations and experiments was achieved, indicating a good applicability and reliability of the refined <b>sub-models</b> and suitability of use of the experimentally derived kinetic data in coal devolatilisation and char oxidation <b>sub-models.</b> The <b>sub-models</b> and the practices implemented in this work can be used in large-scale oxy-fuel combustion processes for reliable design and optimization.
