The following July, the China New Car Assessment Program (C-NCAP) awarded the Cruze a maximum five stars in their independent crash <b>safety</b> <b>test.</b> The Cruze SE 1.6-liter tested scored a maximum of 16 points in side-impact collision, 14.44 in front-end collision, and 15.73 in the 40percent frontal offset collision. Euro NCAP released its rating in November, with the Chevrolet Cruze again receiving the full five-star grading. While the Cruze scored 96percent for adult protection, and 84percent for child occupant protection, Euro NCAP's figure for pedestrian protection is quoted at significantly lower 34percent. In December 2009, the South Korean-specification Cruze—the Daewoo Lacetti Premiere—received the top rating of five stars from the Korean New Car Assessment Program (KNCAP). According to KNCAP, the Lacetti Premiere received the five-star rating in the frontal, offset frontal, side, and whiplash tests.|$|E

Under a plea-bargaining agreement, Met Ed pleaded guilty to one count of falsifying records and no contest to six other charges, four of which were dropped, and agreed to pay a $45,000fine and set up a $1million account to help with emergency planning in the area surrounding the plant.|$|E
25|$|EyeSight is Subaru's {{active safety}} system that uses twin CCD cameras, {{simulating}} stereoscopic vision. It {{was first introduced}} in Japan only as Active Driving Assist (ADA) in 1999. When activated, it actively monitors the road through the windshield-mounted cameras, and can react to driving conditions and possibly avert collisions. Models equipped with EyeSight earned the highest possible rating in the IIHS front crash <b>safety</b> <b>test.</b> Unlike other manufacturers offering stereoscopic cameras for drivers-asset purposes, the Eyesight system's cameras are not bonded to the windshield. Thus, if the windshield is dirty on the inside, it may affect the system's performance.|$|E
25|$|On Sunday 4 September reactor no. 1 {{was shut}} down for regular inspections. These check-ups would last at least three months. At that time reactor No.3 was also shut down, {{although}} the normal inspections were long time finished before September. To resume operation, a stress test was required for all suspended reactors by the government, after the accidents in Fukushima. The Ehime prefectural government said it would decide whether to approve the resumption of operations after {{the results of the}} <b>safety</b> <b>test</b> came out. The Shikoku Electric Power Company said that if the No. 3 reactor did not resume operations, power supplies would be very tight in winter when electricity demand would be high. It was considered to restart a thermal power-plant which had been long out of use.|$|E
40|$|TESTING This Handbook on Non-clinical <b>Safety</b> <b>Testing</b> is {{designed}} {{to serve as an}} aid for scientists who wish to undertake non-clinical <b>safety</b> <b>testing</b> for regulatory purposes during product development. It has been developed as part of a significant and wideranging technology transfer and capacity building programme in the area of pre-clinical product development for disease endemic countries. The Non-clinical <b>Safety</b> <b>Testing</b> Handbook was produced by a Scientific Working Group (SWG) on pre-clinical issues, convened by the UNICEF/UNDP/World Bank/WHO Special Programme for Research & Training in Tropical Diseases (TDR) and consisting of independent scientific specialists from around the world. The Handbook is broadly based on current <b>safety</b> <b>testing</b> guidelines including those of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH). The Handbook will provide scientists and laboratories in disease endemic countries with the necessary technical aid for planning and implementing non-clinical <b>safety</b> <b>testing</b> programmes.

25|$|Most {{multimeters}} {{include a}} fuse, or two fuses, which will sometimes prevent {{damage to the}} multimeter from a current overload on the highest current range. (For added <b>safety,</b> <b>test</b> leads with fuses built in are available.) A common error when operating a multimeter is to set the meter to measure resistance or current, and then connect it directly to a low-impedance voltage source. Unfused meters are often quickly destroyed by such errors; fused meters often survive. Fuses used in meters must carry the maximum measuring current of the instrument, but are intended to disconnect if operator error exposes the meter to a low-impedance fault. Meters with inadequate or unsafe fusing were not uncommon; this situation {{has led to the}} creation of the IEC61010 categories to rate the safety and robustness of meters.|$|E

These failures convinced Mardas and Constantine {{to look at the}} growing European market for anti-terrorist protection, setting up a factory in London to produce [...] "bullet-proof" [...] cars in 1978.

There were two stages. The first was an assembly-line type of operation in the largest hangar where everything was checked.

Her Smith & Wesson [...]357 Magnum revolver jammed when she tried to fire it at two other boys, and she threw it into the trash along with the spare ammunition.
