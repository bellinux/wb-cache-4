5|$|Interstate 69 (I-69) {{is a part}} of the Interstate Highway <b>System</b> <b>that</b> <b>will</b> {{eventually}} {{run from}} the Mexican border in Texas to the Canadian border at Port Huron, Michigan. In Michigan, it is a state trunkline highway that enters the state south of Coldwater and passes the cities of Lansing and Flint in the Lower Peninsula. A north–south freeway from the Indiana–Michigan border to the Lansing area, it changes direction to east–west after running concurrently with I-96. The freeway continues to Port Huron before terminating in the middle of the twin-span Blue Water Bridge while running concurrently with I-94 at the border. There are four related business loops for I-69 in the state, connecting the freeway to adjacent cities.|$|E
5|$|The main {{railway station}} in Aarhus is Aarhus Central Station {{located in the}} city centre. DSB has {{connections}} to destinations throughout Denmark and beyond. Two local railways provide commuter services to Grenaa and Odder. The Aarhus Letbane is a planned electric tram-train <b>system</b> <b>that</b> <b>will</b> link two railway lines with a new light rail route through the city. Most city bus lines go through the inner city and pass through either Park Allé or Banegårdspladsen, or both. Regional and Inter-city buses terminate at Aarhus Bus Terminal, {{just east of the}} central station. The long-distance buses of linie888 connect Aarhus to other cities in Jutland and Zealand.|$|E

5|$|The {{project will}} involve {{building}} a high-speed interchange {{between the two}} roadways. The turnpike commission will also widen the existing four-lane road to six lanes east of the Bensalem interchange, build a new facility east of the Street Road interchange at Neshaminy Falls to mark {{the eastern end of}} the ticket <b>system</b> <b>that</b> <b>will</b> consist of high-speed E-ZPass lanes along with ticket and cash booths, and convert the present Delaware River Bridge toll barrier to a westbound all-electronic facility. A second parallel bridge will also be built over the Delaware River. Work on the project began in late 2010; the replacement of two bridges over the tollway was completed in 2011. Groundbreaking for the interchange with I-95 took place on July 30, 2013, with Governor Corbett in attendance. Construction of the first stage of the interchange began in fall 2014. The flyover ramps between northbound I-95 and the eastbound turnpike, and between the westbound turnpike and southbound I-95 are due to be completed by 2018. Work on the new mainline toll plaza and widening of the turnpike between I-95 and the Delaware River also began in 2013, with completion in 2016. In 2020, construction is expected to begin on completion of the movements between the tollway and I-95, along with the widening of the turnpike between the Bensalem interchange and I-95. Work on building a second, parallel span of the Delaware River Bridge is planned to begin in 2025. The first stage of the project, which includes the new toll plaza, widening, and the flyover ramps between I-95 and the turnpike, is to cost $420 million. The flyover ramps are expected to cost $142.9 million, with $100 million coming from federal funds and the remainder from the turnpike commission. The Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission is borrowing money from foreign investors in order to provide funding for the project. The remaining stages of the project are unfunded, with a projected total cost of $1.1 billion for the entire project.|$|E

25|$|In {{attempting}} to explain similar criticisms manifest in other countries, some academics {{have argued that}} global structures of gender often butt heads with more culture-specific concepts, resulting in tension between the imposed and traditional gender and/or sexual norms. According to one study, this tension in Japan is likely to lessen over successive generations, as holders of traditional views tend to belong to an older cohort of the population. Others argue that the tension between global and local concepts of gender will eventually resolve {{in the establishment of}} a third <b>system</b> <b>that</b> <b>will</b> be a unique conglomeration of traditional and global gender norms for a particular region.|$|E
25|$|In simple terms, he {{believes}} that the singularity in Einstein's field equation at the Big Bang is only an apparent singularity, similar to the well-known apparent singularity at the event horizon of a black hole. The latter singularity can be removed by a change of coordinate system, and Penrose proposes a different change of coordinate <b>system</b> <b>that</b> <b>will</b> remove the singularity at the big bang. One implication of this is that the major events at the Big Bang can be understood without unifying general relativity and quantum mechanics, and therefore we are not necessarily constrained by the Wheeler–DeWitt equation, which disrupts time. Alternatively, one can use the Einstein–Maxwell–Dirac equations.|$|E
25|$|On March 18, 2016, California State Assemblyman Freddie Rodriguez of the Joint Legislative Committee on Emergency Management {{conducted}} {{a hearing in}} which first responders were to share details of {{the response to the}} attack and possible aspects that could be improved on.

He explained that police communications were playing out real-time across the U.S. during the attack, being broadcast on YouTube and other network systems. According to Madden, this put first responders at risk, as potential suspects could have been monitoring the communications and tracking the actions of law enforcement. He added that the City of San Bernardino, as well as San Bernardino County, were moving towards a radio <b>system</b> <b>that</b> <b>will</b> incorporate encrypted frequencies.|$|E
