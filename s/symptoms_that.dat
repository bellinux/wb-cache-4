5|$|Individuals with Asperger {{syndrome}} {{may have}} signs or <b>symptoms</b> <b>that</b> {{are independent of}} the diagnosis, but can affect the individual or the family. These include differences in perception and problems with motor skills, sleep, and emotions.|$|E
5|$|A normal {{variation}} in the PRNP gene can modify {{the course of the}} disease by delaying the age of onset and affecting the type of <b>symptoms</b> <b>that</b> develop. This gene produces prion protein, which is active in the brain and other tissues and also appears to be involved in transporting copper. A role for the ApoE gene was initially suspected but could not be confirmed.|$|E

50|$|It is also {{a medical}} term used for a premonitory <b>symptom,</b> <b>that</b> is, a <b>symptom</b> {{indicating}} the onset of a disease.|$|R
25|$|Amenorrhea, a <b>symptom</b> <b>that</b> occurs after {{prolonged}} weight loss; causes menses to stop, hair becomes brittle, {{and skin}} becomes yellow and unhealthy.|$|R
5|$|A {{number of}} subtypes of Guillain–Barré {{syndrome}} are recognized. Despite this, {{many people have}} overlapping <b>symptoms</b> <b>that</b> can make the classification difficult in individual cases. All types have partial forms. For instance, some people experience only isolated eye-movement or coordination problems; these {{are thought to be}} a subtype of Miller Fisher syndrome and have similar antiganglioside antibody patterns.|$|E
5|$|As the autobodies {{are found}} mainly in {{patients}} that have characteristics of several different autoimmune diseases, the clinical symptoms {{of these patients}} can vary widely. The <b>symptoms</b> <b>that</b> are seen most often are the typical symptoms of the individual autoimmune diseases and include Raynaud's phenomenon, arthritis, myositis and scleroderma. Treatment of these patients is symptomatic and is similar to treatment for the individual autoimmune disease, often involving either immunosuppressive or immunomodulating drugs.|$|E
5|$|Cracked tooth {{syndrome}} {{refers to}} a highly variable set of pain-sensitivity <b>symptoms</b> <b>that</b> may accompany a tooth fracture, usually sporadic, sharp pain that occurs during biting or with release of biting pressure, or relieved by releasing pressure on the tooth. The term is falling into disfavor and {{has given way to}} the more generalized description of fractures and cracks of the tooth, which allows for the wide variations in signs, symptoms, and prognosis for traumatized teeth. A fracture of a tooth can involve the enamel, dentin, and/or pulp, and can be orientated horizontally or vertically. Fractured or cracked teeth can cause pain via several mechanisms, including dentin hypersensitivity, pulpitis (reversible or irreversible), or periodontal pain. Accordingly, there is no single test or combination of <b>symptoms</b> <b>that</b> accurately diagnose a fracture or crack, although when pain can be stimulated by causing separation of the cusps of the tooth, it's highly suggestive of the disorder. Vertical fractures can be very difficult to identify because the crack can rarely be probed or seen on radiographs, as the fracture runs in the plane of conventional films (similar to how the split between two adjacent panes of glass is invisible when facing them).|$|E

5|$|Discontinuation of benzodiazepines or abrupt {{reduction}} of the dose, even after a relatively short course of treatment (three to four weeks), may result in two groups of symptoms—rebound and withdrawal. Rebound symptoms are {{the return of the}} symptoms for which the patient was treated but worse than before. Withdrawal symptoms are the new <b>symptoms</b> <b>that</b> occur when the benzodiazepine is stopped. They are the main sign of physical dependence.|$|E
5|$|Dopamine {{plays a role}} in pain {{processing}} {{in multiple}} levels of the central nervous system including the spinal cord, periaqueductal gray, thalamus, basal ganglia, and cingulate cortex. Decreased levels of dopamine have been associated with painful <b>symptoms</b> <b>that</b> frequently occur in Parkinson's disease. Abnormalities in dopaminergic neurotransmission also occur in several painful clinical conditions, including burning mouth syndrome, fibromyalgia, and restless legs syndrome.|$|E
5|$|HHT is {{a genetic}} {{disorder}} by definition. It is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, {{which means that}} an affected person carries one abnormal gene with a 50% chance of passing this gene to offspring. Those with HHT <b>symptoms</b> <b>that</b> have no relatives with the disease may have a new mutation. It seems that carrying two abnormal copies of the gene is not compatible with life, and hence no homozygotes have been described.|$|E
50|$|Dry eye {{is a major}} <b>symptom</b> <b>that</b> is {{targeted}} in the therapy of CVS. The use of over-the-counter artificial-tear solutions can reduce the effects of dry eye in CVS.|$|R

25|$|Patients with Secondary Raynaud's {{can also}} have {{symptoms}} related to their underlying diseases. Raynaud's phenomenon is the initial <b>symptom</b> <b>that</b> presents for 70% of patients with scleroderma, a skin and joint disease.|$|R
5|$|Hemorrhage from a Rathke's cleft cyst, {{a remnant}} of Rathke's pouch that {{normally}} regresses after embryological development, may cause <b>symptoms</b> <b>that</b> are indistinguishable from pituitary apoplexy. Pituitary apoplexy is regarded by some as distinct from Sheehan's syndrome, where the pituitary undergoes infarction {{as a result of}} prolonged very low blood pressure, particularly when caused by bleeding after childbirth. This condition usually occurs {{in the absence of a}} tumor. Others regard Sheehan's syndrome as a form of pituitary apoplexy.|$|E
5|$|Hip {{dysplasia}} is an abnormality of the {{hip joint}} which can cause crippling lameness and arthritis. The cats most commonly affected with hip dysplasia tend to be males of the larger, big-boned breeds such as Persians and Maine Coons. The relatively smaller size and weight of cats frequently results in <b>symptoms</b> <b>that</b> are less pronounced. X-rays submitted to the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) between 1974 and 2011 indicates that 24.3% of Maine Coons in the database were dysplastic. The Maine Coon is the only cat breed listed in the database.|$|E
5|$|Other bite <b>symptoms</b> <b>that</b> {{may occur}} in humans include edema, which may become extensive, shock, watery blood oozing from the {{puncture}} wounds, nausea and vomiting, subcutaneous bruising, blood blisters that may form rapidly, and a painful {{swelling of the}} regional lymph nodes. Swelling usually decreases after a few days, except for the area immediately around the bite site. Hypotension, together with weakness, dizziness and periods of semi- or unconsciousness is also reported.|$|E

5|$|Other {{potential}} {{causes of}} signs and <b>symptoms</b> <b>that</b> mimic those seen in gastroenteritis {{that need to}} be ruled out include appendicitis, volvulus, inflammatory bowel disease, urinary tract infections, and diabetes mellitus. Pancreatic insufficiency, short bowel syndrome, Whipple's disease, coeliac disease, and laxative abuse should also be considered. The differential diagnosis can be complicated somewhat if the person exhibits only vomiting or diarrhea (rather than both).|$|E
5|$|Performing a chest {{radiograph}} {{is one of}} {{the first}} investigative steps if a person reports <b>symptoms</b> <b>that</b> may suggest lung cancer. This may reveal an obvious mass, widening of the mediastinum (suggestive of spread to lymph nodes there), atelectasis (collapse), consolidation (pneumonia) or pleural effusion. CT imaging is typically used to provide more information about the type and extent of disease. Bronchoscopy or CT-guided biopsy is often used to sample the tumor for histopathology.|$|E
5|$|Signs and {{symptoms}} {{of the most common}} form of pancreatic cancer may include yellow skin, abdominal or back pain, unexplained weight loss, light-colored stools, dark urine and loss of appetite. There are usually no symptoms in the disease's early stages, and <b>symptoms</b> <b>that</b> are specific enough to suggest pancreatic cancer typically do not develop until the disease has reached an advanced stage. By the time of diagnosis, pancreatic cancer has often spread to other parts of the body.|$|E

5|$|The {{acute phase}} lasts {{for the first}} few weeks or months of infection. It usually occurs unnoticed because it is symptom-free or {{exhibits}} only mild <b>symptoms</b> <b>that</b> are not unique to Chagas disease. These can include fever, fatigue, body aches, muscle pain, headache, rash, loss of appetite, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. The signs on physical examination can include mild enlargement of the liver or spleen, swollen glands, and local swelling (a chagoma) where the parasite entered the body.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} {{symptoms}} of COPD are sputum production, shortness of breath, and a productive cough. These symptoms are present for {{a prolonged period}} of time and typically worsen over time. It is unclear if different types of COPD exist. While previously divided into emphysema and chronic bronchitis, emphysema is only a description of lung changes rather than a disease itself, and chronic bronchitis is simply a descriptor of <b>symptoms</b> <b>that</b> may or may not occur with COPD.|$|E
5|$|There {{have not}} been any {{controlled}} studies on meth mouth, and several of its aspects are unclear. Although the condition has been popularized by media coverage and case reports, no systematic {{studies have been conducted}} to conclusively tie methamphetamine use to <b>symptoms</b> <b>that</b> are commonly described as meth mouth. There are few ties between dental scholars and those who study drug use, and it can be difficult for dental researchers to find methamphetamine users to study.|$|E
50|$|In September 1960, Albornoz {{suffered}} a physical attack. It {{was the first}} <b>symptom</b> <b>that</b> years later in Mexico would cause her cerebral paralysis, which, in turn, would lead to her death in Mexico in February 1972.|$|R
