40|$|Modulation {{of voice}} {{is a result of}} {{physiologic}} oscillation within one or more components of the vocal system including the breathing apparatus (i. e., pressure supply), the larynx (i. e. sound source), and the vocal tract (i. e., <b>sound</b> <b>filter).</b> These oscillations may be caused by pathological tremor associated with neurological disorders like essential tremor or by volitional production of vibrato in singers. Because the acoustical characteristics of voice modulation specific to each component of the vocal system and the effect of these characteristics on perception are not well-understood, it is difficult to assess individuals with vocal tremor and to determine the most effective interventions for reducing the perceptual severity of the disorder. The purpose of the present studies was to determine how the acoustical characteristics associated with laryngeal-based vocal tremor affect the perception of the magnitude of voice modulation, and to determine if adjustments could be made to the voice source and vocal tract filter to alter the acoustic output and reduce the perception of modulation. This research was carried out using both a computational model of speech production and trained singers producing vibrato to simulate laryngeal-based vocal tremor with different voice source characteristics (i. e., vocal fold length and degree of vocal fold adduction) and different vocal tract filter characteristics (i. e., vowel shapes). It was expected that, by making adjustments to the voice source and vocal tract filter that reduce the amplitude of the higher harmonics, the perception of magnitude of voice modulation would be reduced. The results of this study revealed that listeners' perception of the magnitude of modulation of voice was affected by the degree of vocal fold adduction and the vocal tract shape with the computational model, but only by the vocal quality (corresponding to the degree of vocal fold adduction) with the female singer. Based on regression analyses, listeners' judgments were predicted by modulation information in both low and high frequency bands. The findings from these studies indicate that production of a breathy vocal quality might be a useful compensatory strategy for reducing the perceptual severity of modulation of voice for individuals with tremor affecting the larynx...|$|E

40|$|Binaural audio {{material}} can be {{presented with the}} use of headphones or a set of loudspeakers. When using the latter, the playback system should compensate for the occurring crosstalk which is done {{with the use of}} crosstalk cancellation filters. A car compartment is considered to be acoustically challenging, for spatial reproduction over loudspeakers, due to the many reflecting surfaces. The thesis set out to investigate suitable loudspeaker positions that might be in favour for a rougher estimation of the cancellation filters, making the system more robust. Another aim was to find a method for filter design. Firstly, a test rig with two loudspeakers was set up to try different loudspeaker positions. When the positions were set, the filters were tuned and tested with the test rig as well as inside a car compartment. Two separate systems were implemented, one behind and one in front of the listener, referred to as back and front system. When the tuning process was completed three user studies were conducted using three different loudspeaker setups: one setup using four similar loudspeakers placed in a listening room, one setup with custom built loudspeakers implemented in a car compartment and the final setup placed inside the listening room using the custom built loudspeakers from the car. The participants were asked to localise virtual source positions generated by either the back or front system. An instrumental evaluation was performed by testing the created filters in a virtual system. Head shadowing and crosstalk performance were studied. Furthermore, a method of filter design was developed along with a measurement script for use with Matlab or Octave. Two of the main findings from the user study are: • The back system was suitable for presenting virtual source positions behind the listener. For source positions in front of the listener most answers resulted in front/back confusions. These tendencies were shown for all tests. • The front system was found to have a more uniform representation of source positions for the tests performed in the listening room. The system inside the car would need further tuning to increase system performance. Keywords: binaural reproduction, 3 D <b>sound,</b> <b>filter</b> design, car HMI, signal processin...|$|E
40|$|Knowledge of {{the mass}} of {{particulate}} matter stored in a diesel particulate filter is imperative for making <b>sound</b> <b>filter</b> regeneration decisions. Currently, the mean-value pressure drop is used to estimate filter particulate load. However, this approach is fraught with accuracy and repeatability problems. In this research, dynamic pressure signal features are examined for this purpose. Specifically, the normalized firing frequency components are extracted from the dynamic pressures upstream, downstream, and across the filter using the complex Fourier Transform for periodic signals. Experimental data show that the firing frequency features appear to have smaller variability and better repeatability than the mean-value pressure drop. In back-to-back filter loading experiments, the mean-value pressure drop varied by around 25 % while variations in the firing frequency features varied by less than about 7 %. The firing frequency features can be used alone or in conjunction with the mean-value pressure drop to improve particulate load estimation. For a loading difference of 0. 25 g/L in the diesel particulate filter, discrimination errors are as high as 3. 4 % using only the mean-value pressure drop, while 0 % error is achieved using the firing frequency features. The discernible particulate load changes can be reduced to less than 0. 25 g/L when the mean-value and firing frequency features are combined. A 1 -D compressible unsteady-flow model was constructed for the flow in the channels of wall-flow diesel particulate filters to study the impact of parameter variations on the firing frequency features. Using this model, the permeability of the porous wall and particulate cake layer demonstrate a nonlinear relationship with the mean-value pressure drop and the firing frequency features. On the other hand, particulate cake layer density has an approximately linear relationship. The simulated firing frequency features were not normalized and showed similar percentage changes with parameter variations. This suggests that the normalization applied to the experimental data is important in suppressing the variations in the firing frequency features. Another important contribution of this research is the construction and validation of a particulate matter measuring system capable of approximately ± 1 g accuracy during steady-state engine operation. ...|$|E
40|$|This {{data set}} {{contains}} raw sensor signals of four analogue sensors and five features derived from them. These {{are used to}} monitor the condition of a printing unit in a demonstrator application and to detect a sensor defect, which is simulated in the data set. The demonstrator is used to simulate the wiping process of an Intaglio printing process. Intaglio is the major printing process to produce security prints like banknotes. Engraved structures in the printing plates, which are mounted on a rotating plate cylinder, are filled with ink, which is transferred onto the printing substrate under high pressure. A second cylinder denoted by wiping cylinder, which is working in the printing unit, is lubricated with a solvent to wipe off surplus ink from the printing plates by rotating in the direction opposite to the plate cylinder. This process is crucial as wiping errors immediately lead to print errors. The printing unit demonstrator contains models of the two cylinders, which are turned by electric drives. Pressure between the wiping cylinder having a rubber surface and the steel-surfaced plate cylinder is freely adjustable. A set of four analogue sensors (contact force, solid-bourne sound, electric current of wiping and plate cylinder drives) continuously acquire data during operation to monitor the process. The sensors each output a continuous voltage signal {{in the range of}} [- 10, 10] V, which is proportional to the respective quantity the sensor is observing. Thus, each signal's unit is irrelevant and abandoned as changes of the original quantity of interest are reflected also in the respective voltage signal. All output time-domain signals are synchronously and equidistantly sampled at a frequency of 20 kHz and quantised with a resolution of 16 bit. The acquired data is then split into non-overlapping batches of 50000 samples (corresponding to 2. 5 sec of operation), respectively. The length of the time frame was chosen to ensure that 3 revolutions of the plate cylinder are captured in each signal data batch. The solid-bourne sound signal is treated by the FFT to determine its frequency spectrum per signal batch. Altogether, 5 features per plate cylinder revolution are extracted. This results in 15 feature values per signal data batch. The extracted features are: 	contact force mean: arithmetic mean of the contact force, 	solid-bourne sound intensity: root mean square of the solid-bourne sound, 	solid-bourne sound maxPowFreqInd: index of the frequency component with largest power, 	motor current wiping cylinder mean: arithmetic mean of the wiping cylinder motor current, 	motor current plate cylinder mean: arithmetic mean of the plate cylinder motor current. Each plate cylinder revolution is represented by one instance in the feature data sets. That is, every instance in the data set is described by a vector of 5 feature values. The raw data and feature data sets are divided into two parts, each containing data of one of the two experiments under different operation conditions: 	Static printing unit demonstrator operation: 	The static experiment observes the printing unit demonstrator during 20 : 13 min of operation. The printing unit demonstrator was started immediately before the data acquisition began. No additional manipulations or events occurred during the experiment. Therefore, only data representing the demonstrator's normal condition is contained in the data set. It contains 10, 000, 000 raw signal samples resulting in 600 instances (plate cylinder revolutions), which are in summary described by 3, 000 feature values. 	Manipulated printing unit demonstrator operation: 	The printing unit demonstrator was started ca. 23 : 00 min before the data acquisition began. During this 10 : 31 min long experiment, the demonstrator application was intentionally manipulated. In addition, the solid-bourne sound sensor signal was manipulated through low-pass filtering in order to simulate a defect of this sensor. An unintended incident also occurred during this experiment. Therefore, data representing both the demonstrator's normal and abnormals conditions are contained in the data set. The sequence of events along with an objective classification of the demonstrator condition by the human experimenter is summarised in the file PrintingUnit_manip_events. txt. The data set contains 5, 950, 000 raw signal samples, which are in summary described by 1, 785 feature values. File name conventions and contents The files in the data set are organised such that each row represents a data set instances, columns represent the respective sensor or feature: 	PrintingUnitData*. csv: These files contain raw sensor signals.

Experiments were conducted to infer the vividness of timbre in imagery for music.

A pilot experiment manipulated instrumentation, while the main experiment manipulated <b>sound</b> <b>filters.</b> The hypothesis that participants are able to internalise timbral aspects of music was supported by an ability to perform the timbre discrimination task, and by facilitated response when imaging the timbre context compared with non-imaging. However, while participants were able to mentally represent timbre, this was not always reported as being a conscious dimension of their musical image. This finding is discussed in relation to previous research suggesting that timbre may be a sound characteristic that is optionally present in imagery for music...|$|R

By measuring the ultrasonic wave field transmitted through slab-shaped samples of different thicknesses, both the dispersion curves and amplitude transmission coefficient can be determined. Be-cause the field is pulsed, the dynamics of the wave fields can also be investigated; this has allowed us to make a systematic study of ultrasonic wave tunneling in phononic crystals.

Recent studies, however, suggest that there are also parallels in vocal production mechanisms.

Methodology/Principal Findings: Correlating high-speed X-ray cinematographic imaging of singing zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) to song structures we identified beak gape and the expansion of the oropharyngeal-esophageal cavity (OEC) as potential articulators. We subsequently manipulated both structures in an experiment in which we played sound through the vocal tract of dead birds. Comparing acoustic input with acoustic output showed that OEC expansion causes an energy shift towards lower frequencies and an amplitude increase whereas a wide beak gape emphasizes frequencies around 5 kilohertz and above.

However, the typical scenario is that the available heap infor-mation, computed by say an up-front points-to analysis, is not precise enough for the client of interest. This imprecise heap information in turn leads to a deluge of false alarms for the tool user to triage. Our position is to approach the false alarm problem not just by improving the up-front analysis but by also employing after-the-fact, goal-directed refutation analyses that yield targeted precision im-provements. We have investigated refutation analysis in the context of detecting statically a class of Android memory leaks. For this client, we have found the necessity for an overall analysis capable of path-sensitive reasoning interproce-durally and with strong updates—a level of precision difficult to achieve globally in an up-front manner. Instead, our approach uses a refutation analysis that mixes highly precise, goal-directed reasoning with facts derived from the up-front anal-ysis to prove alarms false and thus enabling effective and <b>sound</b> <b>filtering</b> of the overall list of alarms...|$|R
