2500|$|After a second, briefer {{period of}} Soviet {{military}} occupation, János Kádár, Nagy's former Minister of State, {{was chosen by}} the Soviet leadership to head the new government and chair the new ruling Socialist Workers' Party (MSzMP). Kádár quickly normalized the situation. In 1963, the government granted a general amnesty and released {{the majority of those}} imprisoned for their active participation in the uprising. Kádár proclaimed a new policy line, according to which the people were no longer compelled to profess loyalty to the party if they tacitly accepted the Socialist regime as a fact of life. In many speeches, he described this as, [...] "Those who are not against us are with us." [...] Kádár introduced new planning priorities in the economy, such as allowing farmers significant plots of private land within the collective farm system (háztáji gazdálkodás). The living <b>standard</b> <b>rose</b> as consumer good and food production took precedence over military production, which was reduced to one tenth of pre-revolutionary levels.|$|E

60|$|I {{discovered}} {{there was}} the nest of a little tit in a hole between two stones in the rock bank that bordered the lawn. I found it out when I {{was sitting on the}} garden seat near by, learning Latin irregular verbs. I saw the minute preposterous round birds going and coming, and I found something so absurdly amiable and confiding about them--they sat balancing and oscillating on a <b>standard</b> <b>rose</b> and cheeped at me to go and then dived nestward and gave away their secret out of sheer impatience--that I could not bring myself to explore further, and kept the matter altogether secret from the enthusiasm of Mr. Siddons. And in a few days there were no more eggs and I could hear the hungry little nestlings making the minutest of fairy hullabaloos, the very finest spun silk of sound; a tremendous traffic in victual began and I was the trusted friend of the family.|$|E

50|$|In the 20th century, {{spending}} on consumer durables rose significantly. Household debt <b>rose</b> as living <b>standards</b> <b>rose,</b> and consumers demanded {{an array of}} durable goods. These included major durables like high-end electronics, vehicles, and appliances, that were purchased with credit. Easy credit encouraged a shift from saving to spending.|$|R

50|$|Plants were {{selected}} to produce year-round colour and interest in the local climate conditions. Initially, evergreen trees were used, but the denseness of shade led to increasing popularity of deciduous trees such as jacaranda, flowering plum and peppercorn. Palms often framed the garden vista, and the native Cootamundra wattle was popular, as were shrubs such as camellias and <b>standard</b> <b>roses.</b> Conservatories contained begonias and adiantum ferns.|$|R
5000|$|Most hybrid tea cultivars are {{not fully}} hardy in {{continental}} areas with very cold winters (below −25 °C). This, combined with their tendency to be stiffly upright, sparsely foliaged and often not resistant to diseases, {{has led to a}} decline in hybrid tea popularity among gardeners and landscapers in favor of lower-maintenance [...] "landscape" [...] roses. The hybrid tea remains the <b>standard</b> <b>rose</b> of the floral industry, however, and is still favored in small gardens in formal situations.|$|E
50|$|The series {{revolves}} around a single bachelor (deemed eligible) and {{a pool of}} romantic interests (22 in season 1, 21 in season 2 and 20 in soasons 3 & 4), which could include a potential wife for the bachelor. The conflicts in the series, both internal and external, stem from the elimination-style format of the show. Early in the season, the bachelor goes on large group dates with the women, {{with the majority of}} women eliminated during rose ceremonies. As the season progresses, women are also eliminated on one-on-one dates and on elimination two-on-one dates. The process culminates with hometown visits {{to the families of the}} final four women, overnight dates, should they choose to accept, at exotic locations with the final three women, and interaction with the bachelor's family with the final two or three women. In many cases, the bachelor proposes to his final selection.The show is known for its dramatic twists, both structurally and contextually. In some cases, the bachelor may or may not follow the show's <b>standard</b> <b>rose</b> ceremony guidelines. Some bachelors, for instance, have conferred fewer roses than allotted as per <b>standard</b> <b>rose</b> ceremony procedure.|$|E
50|$|The {{vigorous}} shrub grows 120 to 200 cm (4 ft to 6 ft) {{high and}} 90 to 125 cm (3 ft to 4 ft 1 in) wide, is winter hardy down to −23 °C (−9 °F, USDA zone 6), half-shade tolerant, and disease resistant. The large, glossy leaves are very dark and leathery. 'Mme A. Meilland' is very versatile—it {{is used as}} cut rose and as garden rose, solitarily or in groups, as <b>standard</b> <b>rose</b> to 90 cm (3 ft) high, or in containers.|$|E
50|$|The garden {{includes}} many old trees, including {{a very old}} black mulberry {{at the rear of}} the house. The front garden is walled with a summer house in one corner, and both the wall and the summerhouse are Grade II listed. The front garden contains many <b>standard</b> <b>roses.</b> Although part of the original orchard has been removed to make a small car park, many fruit trees have been left intact.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to the 1985 stabilization plan, mass Jewish immigration from the former Soviet Union in the 1990s brought many highly educated and skilled immigrants to Israel, and the Israeli government implemented effective macroeconomic policies. As a result, Israel experienced an economic boom, and living <b>standards</b> <b>rose.</b> In 2002, Israeli living standards began climbing rapidly, and the gap between Israel and many other Western nations in quality of life began to narrow.|$|R
50|$|Also {{known as}} A.S.I.S., Yaei High School {{was formed in}} 2008. The new school specializes in four areas: Arts, Sports Science, International studies and Science and Maths, hence why the school is informally known as A.S.I.S. Since the merger, {{academic}} <b>standards</b> <b>rose</b> dramatically and Yaei High School {{has become one of}} the top schools in Sagamihara. The uniform has slightly changed from the former Yaei East and West uniforms, but remains very much the same design.|$|R
50|$|The Einsiedlerhaus {{rose garden}} section {{dates back to}} 1974: the rose garden was {{extended}} {{at the location of}} the former orchard of the Capuchin monks - in return they received compensation for the loss of fruit. This smaller garden of about 350 m2 is divided into four beds by intersecting paths. It is bordered on all four sides by corner flower beds. Thed old tiered fountain {{in the middle of the}} garden was a gift on occasion of the 750th century of the town of Rapperswil. It was planted with older bed roses and a few <b>standard</b> <b>rose</b> bushes.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the early}} years of the Republic of China, intellectuals of the New Culture Movement, such as Hu Shih and Chen Duxiu, {{successfully}} campaigned for the replacement of Literary Chinese as the written standard by written vernacular Chinese, which was based on northern dialects. A parallel priority was the definition of a standard national language (...) [...] After much dispute between proponents of northern and southern dialects and an abortive attempt at an artificial pronunciation, the National Language Unification Commission finally settled on the Beijing dialect in 1932. The People's Republic, founded in 1949, retained this standard, calling it pǔtōnghuà (...) [...]Some 54% of speakers of Mandarin varieties could understand the standard language in the early 1950s, rising to 91% in 1984. Nationally, the proportion understanding the <b>standard</b> <b>rose</b> from 41% to 90% over the same period.|$|E
5000|$|The tall {{shrub rose}} {{or a small}} climber grows upright and bushy, {{reaching}} 100 to 365 cm (39" [...] to 12) height and about 1.8 m width. It has very sturdy, dense, dark green foliage with large, semi-glossy leaves, and almost no prickles. It is winter hardy (USDA zone 5b through 9b), heat and rain tolerant, and very disease resistant, but needs a good nutrient supply and enough sun. In half shade the cultivar is less floriferous. It can be grown as solitary shrub or in groups, in containers or as <b>standard</b> <b>rose</b> to 90 cm (3 ft) high, and is very well suited for cut flowers. Due to its bowing flower heads, training the rose as a small climber along a fence or other supports is recommended.|$|E
50|$|Most roses {{thrive in}} {{temperate}} climates. Those based on warm climate Asian species {{do well in}} their native sub-tropical environments. Certain species and cultivars can even flourish in tropical climates, especially when grafted onto appropriate rootstocks. Most garden roses prefer rich soil which is well-watered but well-drained, and perform best in well-lit positions which receive several hours of sun a day (although some climbers, some species and most Hybrid Musks will tolerate shade). <b>Standard</b> <b>roses</b> require staking.|$|R
2500|$|Córdoba, {{according}} to the census of 1947, had almost 400,000 inhabitants (a quarter of the province's total). Subsequent industrial development led thousands of rural families to the city, doubling its population and turning Córdoba into the second largest city in Argentina, after Buenos Aires, by 1970. The city's population and economic growth moderated, afterwards, though living <b>standards</b> <b>rose</b> {{with the increase in}} the national consumption of Córdoba's industrial products, as well as the development of other sectors of economic activity.|$|R
50|$|A key {{function}} of the society is to conduct trials for new cultivars of roses {{from all over the}} world. The International Merit Trials for both amateur and professional breeders, held at the Royal National Rose Society Gardens' are renowned worldwide. In the autumn of 2013 trials of gold <b>standard</b> <b>roses</b> were relocated to the Garden of the Rose from their previous home in Cambridge. The trial grounds also now contain trials of clematis plants run by the British Clematis Society..|$|R
50|$|The clubs {{history is}} that of {{relative}} obscurity, languishing in the lower leagues usually around the 5th to 3rd tiers of football throughout its history. In the 1996/1997 season, the team started to climb slightly up the leagues due to various complicated mergers with Jagiellonka and Wisła, causing various name changes such as Jagiellonka/Wisła Włocławek in 1997 for example. Despite this, {{as the level of}} football <b>standard</b> <b>rose</b> so did the attendances, reaching an all time high of 7000 spectators for the inaugural match of their highest ever league start, the Second Division in 1997. Successive relegations followed, and after relegation from the Third Division the club was disbanded. The club was however refounded under the name Włocłavia and started the 1999/2000 season in the fifth tier. Recently the clubs fortunes have improved slightly, winning the regional Polish Cup in 2013.|$|E

50|$|The {{favourite}} rose {{for much}} of the history of modern roses, hybrid teas were initially created by hybridising hybrid perpetuals with Tea roses in the late 19th century. 'La France', created in 1867, is universally acknowledged as the first indication of a new class of roses. Hybrid teas exhibit traits midway between both parents: hardier than the teas but less hardy than the hybrid perpetuals, and more ever-blooming than the hybrid perpetuals but less so than the teas. The flowers are well-formed with large, high-centred buds, and each flowering stem typically terminates in a single shapely bloom. The shrubs tend to be stiffly upright and sparsely foliaged, which today is often seen as a liability because it makes them more difficult to place in the garden or landscape. Hybrid teas became the single most popular garden rose of the 20th century; today, their reputation as high maintenance plants has led to a decline in popularity. The hybrid tea remains the <b>standard</b> <b>rose</b> of the floral industry, however, and is still favoured in formal situations. Examples: 'Peace' (yellow), 'Garden Party' (white), 'Mister Lincoln' (red) and 'Double Delight' (bi-colour cream and red).|$|E

5|$|Robinson {{advocated}} {{more natural}} and less formal-looking plantings of hardy perennials, shrubs, and climbers, and reacted against the High Victorian patterned gardening, which used tropical materials grown in greenhouses. He railed against <b>standard</b> <b>roses,</b> statuary, sham Italian gardens, and other artifices common in gardening at the time. Modern gardening practices first introduced by Robinson include: using alpine plants in rock gardens; dense plantings of perennials and groundcovers that expose no bare soil; use of hardy perennials and native plants; and large plantings of perennials in natural-looking drifts.|$|R
50|$|In 1969 he was {{appointed}} first secretary of the Communist Party of the Turkmen SSR. During his time in office, the republic received considerable investment in its modernisation of the gas and oil sectors, and living <b>standards</b> <b>rose</b> significantly for the general population. However, excessive centralised control over economic development and macroeconomic mismanagement led to a stagnation of economic growth in most sectors of the republic's economy in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Gapurow's era also witnessed further growth in nepotism, regional rivalries and corruption.|$|R
