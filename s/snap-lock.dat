Sometimes threaded or <b>snap-lock</b> plastic standoffs are used, which are less secure, but equally useful in a stationary computer. The standoff provides a margin of space between the motherboard and the case to keep the multiple solder points below from grounding and short-circuiting.|$|E

50|$|The first Rough Brothers {{greenhouses}} {{were constructed}} with wood frames. As greenhouse and manufacturing technology advanced, {{the company began}} building with steel and aluminum, and became an early adopter of polyethylene and fiberglass insulating materials. After World War II, Rough Brothers also began manufacturing products to their own design and specifications. They developed the portable Steam-Flo Soil Sterilizer and utilized heat-conserving devices like air-inflated double wall plastic and fiberglass paneling. Rough Brothers also adopted and refined a poly arch system of greenhouse construction. The company’s <b>Snap-Lock</b> insert for poly insulating systems has been tested and recommended by the Ohio Agricultural Research and Development Center. Today, Rough Brothers has four divisions: institutional (research and education markets), conservatory (conservatory construction and restoration), commercial (growers and independent retailers), and mass retail (garden centers).|$|E

50|$|GeoTrax {{train set}} layouts come in beginner, intermediate, {{advanced}} and expert levels, and are built around playset Rail, Construction, Rescue, Elevation and Air and Sea focal point toys. GeoTrax's appeal {{is due in}} part to the number of possible track configurations that can be created with interchangeable track and playsets. GeoTrax is known for its <b>Snap-Lock</b> track which can be locked together or taken apart to create a multitude of track configurations. Layouts can be set up flat or using elevated tracks, and can incorporate curves, ramps and bridges. Some adult assembly is needed to build the track layouts. The assembly process sometimes involves using a Phillips screwdriver and snapping tracks together to create multiple play levels. Users can learn to build a number of prescribed layouts by visiting the GeoTrax site which shows pieces and sets used in each layout and printable pictures of the layouts.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{advancement}} of oral immunization of wild boar, focussing {{on the creation of}} a new bait formulation. The basic objective of oral immunization is to enhance herd immunity and to eliminate the CSF pathogen within a short time frame. Higher bait uptake rates in gruntlings would on one hand lead to an increase of the seroprevalence rate in the wild boar population and on the other hand to a reduction of the number of susceptible animals. This would permit an even more effective control of CSF in the wild boar population. The uptake studies performed with domestic pigs and wild boar described in this exposition revealed, that gruntlings below four months of age only played with the baits and showed an incomplete uptake. By four months of age, the animals began to develop an active bait uptake initially showing a preference for the small baits (1. 8 cm diameter). By the age of five to six months, the animals began to pick up the spheroidal 3 cm bait. The 3 cm bait was taken as a model for {{the creation of a new}} box vaccine container. In order to incorporate a sufficient amount of virus antigen into the bait, the vaccine (C-strain/CP 7 _E 2 alf) was lyophilised and filled into hard gelatine capsules which were then covered with the maize bait masse. Following investigations on the bait uptake, the lyophilised vaccine (we used the conventional C-strain and the chimeric pestivirus CP 7 _E 2 alf) was examined for its stability in comparison to the liquid formulation under different environmental conditions. It could be shown, that both vaccines are much more stable in the lyophilised than in the liquid form (p < 0, 05). Due to the higher stability of lyophilised vaccine at temperatures over 20 °C, the new formulation represents an improvement and is especially suitable for immunization campaigns carried out at higher environmental temperatures (in summer or in warmer regions). In the first part of the animal experiments carried out for the present thesis, the efficacy of the bait formulation containing lyophilised C-strain virus was studied. After administration of the spheroidal vaccine baits to wild boar and domestic pigs followed by an infection with a low dose of CSFV strain Alfort 187 , all vaccinated domestic pigs and wild boar were protected from a CSF infection and we were neither able to isolate challenge virus from BC nor from nasal mucous, eye fluid, saliva or faeces. In a second confirmatory trial, pigs were immunised with lyophilised C-strain and the spheroidal 3 cm bait and were subsequently subjected to a challenge infection with 1, 000 TCID 50 /ml. Again, the animals, which had picked up the bait completely, were protected from a lethal CSFV infection. Neither viremia nor virus shedding could be detected. The pigs developed high neutralising antibody titres. To conclude, the new bait-formulation consisting of: a) a smaller bait (d = 3 cm) b) a hard gelatine capsule with <b>snap-lock</b> and c) lyophilised C-virus is able to protect pigs against a severe CSF infection and simultaneously prevent viremia and virus transmission. As in the future DIVA vaccines might have a positive impact on the control strategies against CSF in domestic pigs and wild boar, the development of new marker vaccine candidates also was one of the aims of an EU-project. Therefore, the last two animal experiments described in this thesis were performed in line with this project, using the chimeric marker vaccine CP 7 _E 2 alf in a lyophilised formulation with the bigger spheroidal bait and analogously to the experiments carried out with C-virus. In contrast to the C-strain, the freeze-dried chimera was not able to protect the infected pigs from a lethal infection. All vaccinees (wild boar and domestic pigs) became ill showing CSF typical symptoms. In the virological examination, virus was found in the blood as well as in all body fluids examined (nasal mucous, eye fluid, saliva and faeces), so that the animals died or had to be killed in a moribund state. We could not clarify conclusively whether the negative result of this animal experiment was due to low virus antigen content or rather the consequence of a non-optimal E 1 E 2 -heterodimer-complex in the chimera. Based on these findings, another animal trial was performed with an improved CP 7 _E 2 alf chimera consisting of the E 2 -gene of CSF-strain Alfort 187  and the E 1 -gene of this CSFV strain instead of the E 1 -gene of BVDV (CP 7 _E 1 E 2 alf). Besides this newly created virus the previous chimera CP 7 _E 2 alf and the C-virus were used for parenteral vaccination. In animal experiments with domestic pigs, a complete protection from clinical signs and virus excretion could be observed with both chimeric pestiviruses and in the C-virus group after i. m. immunization. After vaccination, the weaner pigs developed neutralising antibodies, whereas at the time point of challenge the animals of the CP 7 _E 1 E 2 alf group reached the highest antibody titres in the virus neutralisation test, followed by the C-virus vaccinated and the CP 7 _E 2 alf immunised pigs. Because of the higher antibody titres in the CP 7 _E 1 E 2 alf group, it could be assumed that this construct with its CSF-E 1 E 2 -dimer is more effective with regard to the production of neutralising antibodies. Further studies on the efficacy of this new chimera after oral administration as well as on its stability and safety are not part of this thesis, but are regarded as important exploratory focuses for future research. With the new bait formulation it should be possible to reach a larger number of gruntlings by oral immunization. As a result, more animals will be protected against CSFV infection and in the consequence will not be able to serve as virus carriers spreading and shedding the CSF pathogen. Due to the improved stability of the lyophilised vaccine in comparison to the liquid suspension, the virus antigen content should not fall below the MID, even at high environmental temperatures and if the baits are not taken up for several days after distribution. This should lead to an effective immunization of wild boar over a long time period. If further scientific studies prove that the lyophilised CP 7 _E 1 E 2 alf chimera is efficient after oral administration, this vaccine can be considered as a classical DIVA vaccine candidate which allows to discriminate field-virus infected animals from vaccinated animals also in wild boar...|$|E
