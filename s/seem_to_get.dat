25|$|Jesus is not {{believed}} by his family, {{and so he}} leaves them once again, meets Mary Magdalene, and goes to work helping the fishermen on the Sea of Galilee. One day out on the Sea by himself, he is visited by God and the devil. God tells Jesus of his plan for Jesus to institute Christianity, because God is annoyed at being only the God of one race, and that other gods <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> all the glory. Jesus is initially against {{what he sees as}} a selfish plan bound to lead to great suffering of many, but is made to see that he actually has no choice in the matter.|$|E

25|$|Just {{when things}} couldn't <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> any worse {{coming off a}} last place overall finish, they did for the 1983–84 season, as the Cents {{finished}} with an abysmal record of 8–51–1. The team also set a dubious BCJHL record for the most goals allowed in a season with 543, an average of 9.05 against per game. This {{despite the fact that}} forward Brent Demerais set a single season team record that still stands today with 66 goals. His total represents 26.7% of the total goals the team scored that season. In fact, Demerais' point total of 124 was good enough for third overall in the BCJHL, but it was the lone bright spot in a season with very few.|$|E
25|$|In a December 2015 {{interview}} with BBC Radio 4's Today programme Ahern said low pay workers had brought country {{to its knees}} because they got “cocky” and insisted on “second, third and even fourth homes”. The former Taoiseach said that the availability of cheap credit through Ireland's involvement in the eurozone created “a huge problem”. “Anyone could walk into any institution and <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> any amount of money {{and this is where}} the cocky bit came in. “Unfortunately… Joe Soap and Mary Soap, who never had a lot, got the loans for the second house and leveraged the third house off the second house and the fourth on the third, and you know, what are you having yourself.” People, among them those who had previously regarded the former Taoiseach highly, took to social media and the airwaves to criticise Ahern for his remarks.|$|E
25|$|Rick Ryder (Sebastian Spence) is Sophie's ex-boyfriend {{and former}} {{business}} partner {{who now runs}} his own competing talent agency which stole most of Sophie's clients. Despite {{the end of their}} relationship, however, they can't <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> away from each other, in part because Sophie's mother is constantly plotting to reunite them. His continued presence in Sophie's life also complicates her efforts to find a new boyfriend: in one episode, he accidentally sees Melissa giving Sophie's current love interest a few pointers on how Sophie likes to be flirted with, mistakes him for someone Melissa is seeing behind his back, and later punches him in the face at a gallery show. In the first season finale, he almost asked Melissa to marry him, but when that failed he saw Sophie crying over being rejected by André and as they were about to go get a drink, he sees André walking towards the two.|$|E

500|$|On 4 May 2015, the {{restored}} Pather Panchali premiered at the Museum of Modern Art, {{a little more}} than 60 years to the day after the film’s world premiere at the same venue. Several days later, all three films opened at New York’s Film Forum, where they were originally scheduled to run for three weeks. Because of overwhelming public demand – with one writer commenting that [...] "audiences can’t <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> enough" [...] – the films were held over at that theater until June 30. The trilogy was then sent to be exhibited in many other cities throughout the U.S. and Canada.

Madame de Traventhal, in the hope of curing him of his obsession, sends for a physician newly arrived in the country, a certain Doctor Ox (from the short story [...] "Dr. Ox's Experiment").

500|$|... "The Clash of Triton" [...] {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews from critics.

[...] Gord Lacey of TV Shows on DVD claimed [...] "I enjoyed 'Clash of the Triton', and the bonus episode of Fanboy & Chum Chum was neat." [...] Ken Tucker of the Entertainment Weekly said [...] "The values of SpongeBob remain intact.

500|$|Graduation {{started taking}} {{definite}} form {{around the time}} of the filming of the music video for its second single [...] "Stronger", whereas prior West had been [...] "aimlessly making songs." [...] The music video was directed by famed music video director, film director, and screenwriter Hype Williams. The sci-fi imagery of music video inspired West to take his album in a more futuristic direction. After the filming of the music video, which began before West had even written the song's second verse, he returned to the studio to redo parts of [...] "Stronger" [...] and various other tracks he recorded for the album, watching films such as Total Recall for more ideas. West mixed the track seventy-five times, as he could not <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the kick drum to sound precisely the way that he wanted it to, amongst other issues. He worked on [...] "Stronger" [...] with eight different audio engineers and eleven different mix engineers around the globe and recorded over fifty versions of the track. Still feeling dissatisfied after hearing the number-one hit single inside a club compared alongside Timbaland's 2007 single [...] "The Way I Are", which was his favorite hip-hop beat at the time, West enlisted the record producer to assist him in redoing the drum programming.|$|E

500|$|According to {{an article}} in The Houston Chronicle, [...] "The {{catalyst}} for Disney's braving the stage was an article by The New York Times theater critic Frank Rich that praised Beauty and the Beast as 1991's best musical.... Theatre Under The Stars executive director Frank Young {{had been trying to}} get Disney interested in a stage version of Beauty about the same time Eisner and Katzenberg were mulling over Rich's column. But Young couldn't <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> in touch with the right person in the Disney empire. Nothing happened till the Disney execs started to pursue the project from their end.... When they asked George Ives, the head of Actors Equity on the West Coast, which Los Angeles theater would be the best venue for launching a new musical, Ives said the best theater for that purpose would be TUTS. Not long after that, Disney's Don Frantz and Bettina Buckley contacted Young, and the partnership was under way." [...] A stage condensation of the film, directed by Robert Jess Roth and choreographed by Matt West, both of whom moved on to the Broadway development, had already been presented at Disneyland at what was then called the Videopolis stage. Beauty and the Beast premiered in a joint production of Theatre Under The Stars and Disney Theatricals at the Music Hall, Houston, Texas, from November 28, 1993, through December 26, 1993.|$|E
500|$|Giving a {{partially}} negative {{review of the}} film was Joshua Rothkopf of Time Out New York, who said the [...] "movie has a centerfold sheen to it—and some lesbianic soft-core flirtation to match—as its plot dives deeply into Twilight-esque heavy-melo meltdown in the last act" [...] and that [...] "Cody throws one too many losses at Needy; the screenwriter loses her satiric way about halfway through. But for a while, this has real fangs". Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post said, [...] "There's a certain kooky, kinky fun to be had with Jennifer's Body" [...] but that [...] "dmittedly, this {{is the stuff of}} lurid adolescent distraction, not great cinema" [...] and [...] "is strictly a niche item but provides a goofy, campy bookend to Drag Me to Hell on the B-movie shelf. Watch it, forget it, move on". San Francisco Chronicle Peter Hartlaub stated, [...] "Enjoy the film for its witty dialogue and fun performances, but know that there isn't a single good scare. An episode of Murder, She Wrote has more thrills." [...] Hartlaub felt the film is not bad, is [...] "almost always pleasing" [...] and that Fox [...] "proves that she has some [...] range" [...] but [...] "the chances that it will be somebody else's pop culture reference 27 years from now are slim to none". Joe Neumaier of New York Daily News said, [...] "Fox merely needs to look either vacant or evil, which the Transformers boy-toy does spookily well" [...] but [...] "ords and story are still the lifeblood of a movie, and Jennifer's Body is filled like a Twinkie with half-fleshed-out ideas". Disagreeing with Fox's performance, Chicago Tribune's Michael Phillips called Fox [...] "a pretty bad actress" [...] who [...] "doesn't <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> Cody's sense of humor. At all". He reasoned the [...] "movie's partially redeemed by Seyfried, who makes her character more than a repository for audience sympathy" [...] and [...] "her make-out scene with Fox is handled with more suspense and care than anything else in the movie".|$|E
