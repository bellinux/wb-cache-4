In the open, alpha PCS shifted from highly related to distantly related with increasing potential productivity. However, we found no relationship between gamma PCS and climate, due to divergence in phylogenetic composition between cushion and open sub-communities in <b>severe</b> <b>environments,</b> as demonstrated by increasing phylo-beta diversity.

Triops granarius is exposed to desiccation and extreme temperatures after the water dries up in its habitat. To withstand this <b>severe</b> <b>environment,</b> Triops eggs enter anhydrobiosis after the water evaporates.

50|$|The {{test vehicle}} was {{launched}} on May 19, 1965, at 06:01:04 a.m. M.S.T. (13:01:04 UTC). Within 2.5 seconds after lift-off, a launch malfunction caused {{the vehicle to}} go out of control. The launch vehicle entered into a roll which caused it to break up before second-stage ignition, and a low-altitude abort was initiated instead of the planned high-altitude abort. The launch escape system canard surfaces deployed and survived the <b>severe</b> <b>environment.</b> The high roll rates (approximately 260 degrees per second at the time of canard deployment) induced by the launch vehicle malfunction stabilized the launch escape vehicle in a tower-forward attitude, which overcame the destabilizing effect of the canards. Post-flight simulations verified the ineffectiveness of the canards at the high roll rate, but showed that canards would be effective at the 20 degree per second roll rate limit of the Saturn emergency detection system.|$|E

Significant <b>severe</b> <b>environments</b> are then verified by significant severe weather reports to ensure climatologies presented herein are indeed representative of observations. Reports indicate that environments calculated by reanalysis tend to overestimate the actual distribution of reports, likely due to the absence of accounting for a lifting mechanism.

30|$|Amidst this uncertainty, cushion {{plants have}} not been given the same {{attention}} even though they make up {{a major part of}} some alpine and Arctic vegetation communities (but see Stenström et al. 1997; Alatalo and Totland 1997). Cushion plants are distributed globally in harsh polar and alpine regions, where they are of great importance as they often function as facilitators, nurse plants and foundation species in the <b>severe</b> <b>environments</b> and {{have a positive effect on}} other species across trophic levels (Cavieres and Arroyo 2002; Arroyo and Cavieres 2003; Molenda et al. 2012; Reid and Lortie 2012; Roy et al. 2013). The number of studies on cushion plants has increased rapidly during the last decade (Reid et al. 2010) and cushion plants have been shown to inhibit loss of phylogenetic diversity in <b>severe</b> <b>environments,</b> where they can act as “micro-refugia” to less stress tolerant species (Butterfield et al. 2013). Similarly, cushion plants have been shown to enhance species richness more in systems with lower local diversity through their role as nurse plants, sustaining diversity under harsh conditions (Cavieres et al. 2014). For instance, Antonsson et al. (2009) found that the cushion plant Silene acaulis had a significant nurse plant effect above a certain elevation threshold in alpine sub-arctic Sweden, indicating that the facilitation is increasingly important at higher elevations with more <b>severe</b> <b>environments.</b> Likewise, Yang et al. (2010) found that positive associations between the cushion plant Arenaria polytrichoides and other plants increased with elevation in the Sino-Himalayas. S. acaulis has also been shown to function as facilitator for arthropods (Molina-Montenegro et al. 2006; Molenda et al. 2012).|$|R

5000|$|The PCI {{method is}} based on the simple concept of primary air (termed the [...] "conveying gas") {{carrying}} pulverized coal which injected through a lance to the tuyere (mid-bottom inlet of a blast furnace), then mixed with secondary hot air (termed the [...] "blast") supplied through a blowpipe in the tuyere and then piped to a furnace to create a balloon-like cavity called a [...] "raceway", which then propagates coal and coke combustion and melts the solid iron ore, releasing molten iron. The most remarkable aspect of this method is that it allows for cheaper coal to be consumed in the system, replace expensive coke, thereby remarkably cutting down on costs. Because of the <b>severe</b> <b>environment</b> inside the furnace, (>2000K), visual observation of raceway shape and size is impossible, therefore remotely measuring sensors are used to investigate the chemical and physical reactions inside the furnace.|$|E
5000|$|An {{argument}} against {{this hypothesis is}} that adequate repair mechanisms including those involving recombination already exist in prokaryotes. Prokaryotes do have DNA repair mechanism enriched with recombinational repair, {{and the existence of}} prokaryotic life in <b>severe</b> <b>environment</b> indicates the extreme efficiency of this mechanism to help them survive many DNA damages related to the environment. This implies that an extra costly repair in the form of meiosis would be unnecessary. However, most of these mechanisms cannot be as accurate as and is possibly more mutagenic than the repair mechanism provided by meiosis. They primarily do not require a second homologous chromosome for the recombination that promotes a more extensive repair. Thus, despite the efficiency of recombinational repair involving sister chromatids, the repair still needs to be improved, and another type of repair is required. Moreover, due to the more extensive homologous recombinational repair in meiosis in comparison to the repair in mitosis, meiosis as a repair mechanism can accurately remove any damage that arises at any stage of the cell cycle more than mitotic repair mechanism can do [...] and was, therefore, naturally selected. In contrast, the sister chromatid in mitotic recombination could have been exposed to similar amount of stress, and, thus, this type of recombination, instead of eliminating the damage, could actually spread the damage and decrease fitness.|$|E
