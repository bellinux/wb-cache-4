5|$|Gliders {{are often}} {{launched}} using a stationary ground-based winch {{mounted on a}} heavy vehicle. This method is widely used at many European clubs, often {{in addition to an}} aerotow service. The engine is usually powered by LPG, petrol or diesel, though hydraulic fluid engines and electrical motors are also used. The winch pulls in a 1,000 to 2,500-metre (3,000 to 7,500ft) cable, made of high-tensile <b>steel</b> <b>wire</b> or a synthetic fiber, attached to the glider. The cable is released at a height of about 35% of the cable length after a short, steep ride. A strong headwind will result in higher launches.|$|E
5|$|The cage {{crinoline}} {{made out}} of spring <b>steel</b> <b>wire</b> was first introduced in the 1850s, with the earliest British patent for a metal crinoline (described as a 'skeleton petticoat of steel springs fastened to tape.') granted in July 1856. Alison Gernsheim suggests that the unidentified French inventor was probably R. C. Milliet of Besançon, as the July 1856 patent was filed by their British agent, C. Amet. Milliet had already patented a 'tournure de femme' in Paris on 24 April 1856 which was described as comprising 'elastic extensible circles joined together by vertical bands.' Following its introduction, the women's rights advocate Amelia Bloomer felt that her concerns about the hampering nature of multiple petticoats had been resolved, and dropped dress reform as an issue. Diana de Marly, in her biography of the couturier Charles Frederick Worth noted that by 1858 there existed steel factories catering solely to crinoline manufacturers, and shops that sold nothing else but crinolines. One {{of the most significant}} manufacturers of crinolines was that of Thomson & Co., founded by an American with branches across Europe and the United States. At the height of their success, up to four thousand crinolines were produced by Thomson's London factory in a day, whilst another plant in Saxony manufactured 9.5 million crinolines over a twelve-year period. In 1859 the New York factory, which employed about a thousand girls, used 300,000yards of <b>steel</b> <b>wire</b> every week to produce between three and four thousand crinolines per day, while the rival Douglas & Sherwood factory in Manhattan used a ton of steel each week in manufacturing hoop skirts.|$|E

The corrosion rate of all the examined <b>steel</b> <b>wires</b> in alkaline 1 M NaOH solution (that is, 7 - 18 x 10 - 3 mm/y) was found nearly three orders of magnitude lower corrosion resistance than in 1 M HCl solution at 25 o C, mostly due to an ennoblement of the open circuit potentials of the <b>steel</b> <b>wires</b> at passive potential regions (that is,- 200 to 250 mV vs SCE) in 1 M NaOH solution.

30|$|Leveling was {{accomplished}} sooner by super-elastic than stainless <b>steel</b> arch <b>wires</b> in our sample. Similarly, Weiland [15] has shown {{greater amount of}} buccal premolar displacement {{during the same period}} with super-elastic than stainless <b>steel</b> <b>wires.</b> Initial force applied by stainless <b>steel</b> <b>wires</b> soon declines and needs to be re-established, while the force induced by means of super-elastic wires continues over a longer time. Tooth movement with continuous forces was also found more effective than with interrupted continuous forces at the premolar tipping model by Owman-Moll et al. [16]. Longer treatment time with <b>steel</b> <b>wires</b> could be attributed to the intervals when <b>steel</b> <b>wires</b> are passive. However, in the Cochrane review of published randomized controlled trials (RCTs) by Wang et al.

5|$|Gas {{tungsten}} arc welding, {{because it}} affords {{greater control over}} the weld area than other welding processes, can produce high-quality welds when performed by skilled operators. Maximum weld quality is assured by maintaining cleanliness—all equipment and materials used must be free from oil, moisture, dirt and other impurities, as these cause weld porosity and consequently a decrease in weld strength and quality. To remove oil and grease, alcohol or similar commercial solvents may be used, while a stainless <b>steel</b> <b>wire</b> brush or chemical process can remove oxides from the surfaces of metals like aluminum. Rust on steels can be removed by first grit blasting the surface and then using a wire brush to remove any embedded grit. These steps are especially important when negative polarity direct current is used, because such a power supply provides no cleaning during the welding process, unlike positive polarity direct current or alternating current. To maintain a clean weld pool during welding, the shielding gas flow should be sufficient and consistent so that the gas covers the weld and blocks impurities in the atmosphere. GTAW in windy or drafty environments increases the amount of shielding gas necessary to protect the weld, increasing the cost and making the process unpopular outdoors.|$|E
5|$|Heavy rains from Auring {{triggered}} flooding {{across the}} eastern provinces of the Philippines. A total of 38,764 people were evacuated to avoid floodwaters. The rains caused the Cagayan River to swell, {{leading to the}} death of a 12-year-old boy in Gingoog City. In Talisay City, Cebu, a 27-year-old woman was killed after she was electrocuted by a <b>steel</b> <b>wire</b> which was knocked down by high winds produced by Auring. Nine other people, all of whom are children, were listed as missing. About 12,211 people were left stranded at ports due to dangerous conditions caused by the depression. An additional 14 trucks, 44 light cars, 75 passenger buses, 27 vessels and 295 rolling cargoes were also stranded. Severe flooding destroyed 305 homes, 199 of which were in Macasandig. Another 610 homes sustained damage. An estimated 53hectares (130.9acres) of rice and 3.5hectares (8.6acres) of corn were damaged. About 43,851 people were affected by the storm, mainly along the Cagayan River. The remnants of Auring brought heavy rains to the flooded areas again on January7, triggering several landslides which blocked off roads and damaging power lines, leaving parts of the Catanduanes without power for several hours. Damages from the depression were estimated at PHP23million ($498,318USD) and an estimated 5,000 families were left homeless.|$|E
25|$|On modern yachts, {{standing}} rigging is often stainless <b>steel</b> <b>wire,</b> stainless steel rod or synthetic fiber. Semi-rigid stainless <b>steel</b> <b>wire</b> {{is by far}} the most common as it combines extreme strength, relative ease of assembling and rigging with reliability. Unlike rigid stainless steel rod, it is comparatively easy to recognize wear and stress as individual strains (normally 19) break often near a swage fitting, and can be inspected while standing. Solid rod stainless steel is more aerodynamic so is often used in extreme racing yachts but it is difficult to see stress as this requires x-raying. Great care must be used when swaging fittings onto stainless steel rod as this can start minute cracking. Rod-type stays fail suddenly, often where the rod bends around a spreader. Bending can induce unseen stress fractures.|$|E
40|$|Bridge {{inspections}} {{reveal that}} severe corrosion and fatigue {{are the main}} failure mechanisms of bridge stay cables. This paper presents an empirical modelling of the long-term deterioration process of <b>steel</b> <b>wires</b> in cables with consideration of the simultaneous occurrence of uniform corrosion, pitting corrosion and fatigue induced by a combined action of environmental aggression and cyclic loading. Accelerated corrosion experiments are conducted to determine the different corrosion levels of high-strength <b>steel</b> <b>wires,</b> and time-dependent statistical models are developed to quantify uniform and pitting corrosion depth. Corrosion-fatigue process of <b>steel</b> <b>wires</b> is subsequently simulated using the corrosion models and cyclic stress obtained through cable force monitoring data. The mechanical properties of corroded <b>steel</b> <b>wires,</b> including yield stress, ultimate stress, ultimate strain and modulus of elasticity, are experimentally characterised, and the statistical models are established through regression analysis. Finally, the deterioration models of high-strength <b>steel</b> <b>wires</b> (including crack depth, ratio of broken wires, and remaining strength, among others) is extended to probabilistically assess the time-variant conditions of bridge cables (sectional area loss and remaining capacity). The presented study on the long-term deterioration of bridge cables would provide guidance to future decision-making regarding the maintenance and replacement of bridge cables.

40|$|AbstractHeavily drawn <b>steel</b> <b>wires,</b> used in {{applications}} such as radial tires, have to withstand {{a high number of}} fatigue cycles, typically > 108. Such <b>steel</b> <b>wires</b> have diameters as small as 175 μm. High cycle fatigue failure in such wires is initiated by either surface defects or internal non-metallic inclusions. The former leads to shorter fatigue lives than the latter. A methodology has been developed to measure the fatigue threshold Stress Intensity Factor (SIF) for long cracks in these heavily drawn <b>steel</b> <b>wires.</b> Then, the SIF's of the non-metallic inclusions, at which the high cycle fatigue cracks initiate, were compared to the threshold value for long crack growth. It was shown that the defect size that should be used to calculate the SIF is larger than the inclusion size itself. This is validated using Scanning Electron Microscopy in combination with a Focused Ion Beam, proving that the region around non-metallic inclusions is characterized by alterations in the microstructure. In this intermediate region between the inclusion and the start of the long cracks, the crack growth rate is very slow and can be described by a Paris’ law like relationship. Hence, a bi-linear Paris law has been proposed, enabling to predict the fatigue life of heavily drawn <b>steel</b> <b>wires</b> containing any size of inclusions...|$|R

For wires drawn with medium single draft (10. 4 %, 15. 5 % and 26. 5 %) the investigation of mechanical-technological properties was performed thereby providing results on yield strength, tensile strength, elongation, contraction, number of twist and number of band. On the basis of numerical analysis of wire drawing process {{the influence of}} the value of single draft on inhomogeneity of strain was determined. It was established that in the range of medium single drafts 10 - 26 % used in drawing process of high carbon <b>steel</b> <b>wires</b> large single drafts cause the increase of their strength properties by deterioration of their plasticity properties. It was demonstrated that the increase of strength properties in wires drawn with larger single drafts is related to the occurrence of higher non-dilatational strain, which cause additional work hardening of material. The theoretical-experimental analysis of drawing of high carbon <b>steel</b> <b>wires</b> enabled evaluation of optimal value of single drafts by which it can be used relatively the most advantageous useful properties of wires.
