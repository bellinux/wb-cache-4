40|$|This {{research}} examined whether {{provision of}} information on the environmental impact of <b>street</b> <b>lighting</b> affects the acceptability and perceived social safety of reduced <b>street</b> <b>lighting</b> levels. We argued that such information should particularly affect acceptability and safety judgements of individuals who value these environmental benefits, that is, those with strong biospheric values. Participants viewed virtual representations of a residential <b>street</b> where <b>street</b> <b>lighting</b> levels were varied. As expected, low lighting levels were seen as more acceptable, while high lighting levels were seen as less acceptable when information on the environmental impact of <b>street</b> <b>lighting</b> was provided to individuals that strongly endorsed biospheric values. Support for the expectation that these increases in acceptability of lower lighting levels would trigger a process of rationalisation leading individuals with strong biospheric values to downplay consequences opposing value-driven views was mixed. Stronger effects were found when participants could compare different lighting levels directly. The study suggests that value-congruent information on the environmental benefits of reduced <b>street</b> <b>lighting</b> can increase acceptability of reduced <b>street</b> <b>lighting.</b> (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Crossing locations include midblock and intersections, and light conditions include daylight, dark with <b>street</b> <b>lighting,</b> and dark without <b>street</b> <b>lighting.</b> The study formulates a theoretical framework on the determinants of pedestrian injury severity, and specifies an empirical model accordingly. An ordered probit model is then applied to the KABCO severity scale of pedestrian injuries which occurred while attempting street crossing in the years 1986 to 2003 in Florida. In terms of crossing locations, {{the probability of a}} pedestrian dying when struck by a vehicle, is higher at midblock locations than at intersections for any light condition. In fact, the odds of sustaining a fatal injury is 49 percent lower at intersections than at midblock locations under daylight conditions, 24 percent lower under dark with <b>street</b> <b>lighting</b> conditions, and 5 percent lower under dark without <b>street</b> <b>lighting</b> conditions.

However, inadequate information on the benefits from energy efficiency improvements has given <b>street</b> <b>lighting</b> systems a lower priority in national energy efficiency policy. This paper estimates the national benefits arising from energy efficiency improvements on <b>street</b> <b>lighting</b> systems based on a pilot project in Jakarta city and energy audits in other three cities. The energy efficiency actions considered in the audits are the installation of power meters on every panel in <b>street</b> <b>lighting</b> systems and the replacement of old, inefficient armatures with high-efficiency armatures that are integrated with the dimming schemes featured in smart <b>street</b> <b>lighting</b> technology. The results show that electricity consumption reduction potential from energy efficiency improvements can reach 2. 1 Terra Watts hours annually. This is equivalent to energy costs of USD 177. 4 million, a USD 46. 8 million energy subsidy saving, and a 2. 4 million ton CO emission reduction.
