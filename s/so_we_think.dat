2500|$|Because of Jovita González's {{established}} {{advocacy for}} a cultural assimilation {{that included the}} modernization of gender roles in the Mexican-American community, and because Caballero is a thinly veiled critique of traditional patriarchal home organizations, the novel has since its rediscovery been analyzed as a feminist text. Editors José E. Limón and María Cotera decided for this reason to dedicate the book to [...] "the mexicanas of Texas". They defend their dedication in the [...] "Editor's Acknowledgements": [...] "Caballero deals centrally with the historical experience of Mexican women in Texas, <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>think</b> it wholly appropriate to dedicate this book to this often-neglected sector of Texas society". Cotera considers the novel a precursor to the later-century work done by chicana feminists like Ana Castillo, Cherríe Moraga and Gloria Anzaldúa.|$|E

6000|$|I wish {{to add one}} remark, here--in parentheses, so to speak--suggested by {{the word}} [...] "snowy," [...] which I have just used. We have all seen hills and {{mountains}} and levels with snow on them, and <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>think</b> we know all the aspects and effects produced by snow. But indeed we do not until {{we have seen the}} Alps. Possibly mass and distance add something--at any rate, something IS added. Among other noticeable things, there is a dazzling, intense whiteness about the distant Alpine snow, when the sun is on it, which one recognizes as peculiar, and not familiar to the eye. The snow which one is accustomed to has a tint to it--painters usually give it a bluish cast--but there is no perceptible tint to the distant Alpine snow when it is trying to look its whitest. As to the unimaginable splendor of it when the sun is blazing down on it--well, it simply IS unimaginable.|$|E

By the blessing of Allah we have broken them, and chased them for a mile, though indeed these infidels are different from the dogs of Egypt, and have slain very many of our men. Yet we hope to smite them again ere the new moon be come, to which end I trust that thou wilt send us a thousand Dervishes from Omdurman. In token of our victory I send you by this messenger a flag which we have taken. By the colour it might well seem to have belonged to those of the true faith, but the Kaffirs gave their blood freely to save it, and <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>think</b> that, though small, it is very dear to them.|$|E
60|$|The two last places {{before you}} come to our gate are the Dog's Cemetery and the chaffinch's nest, but we pretend not {{to know what the}} Dog's Cemetery is, as Porthos is always with us. The nest is very sad. It is quite white, and the way we found it was wonderful. We were having another look among the bushes for David's lost worsted ball, and instead of the ball we found a lovely nest made of the worsted, and {{containing}} four eggs, with scratches on them very like David's handwriting, <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>think</b> they must have been the mother's love-letters to the little ones inside. Every day we were in the Gardens we paid a call at the nest, taking care that no cruel boy should see us, and we dropped crumbs, and soon the bird knew us as friends, and sat in the nest looking at us kindly with her shoulders hunched up. But one day when we went, there were only two eggs in the nest, and the next time there were none. The saddest part of it was that the poor little chaffinch fluttered about the bushes, looking so reproachfully at us that we knew she thought we had done it, and though David tried to explain to her, it was so long since he had spoken the bird language that I fear she did not understand. He and I left the Gardens that day with our knuckles in our eyes.|$|E
6000|$|Indifferent poets comfort {{themselves}} {{with the notion that}} contemporary popularity is no test of merit, and that true poetry must always wait for a new generation to do it justice. The theory is not true in any general sense. With hardly an exception, the poetry that was ever to receive a wide appreciation has received it at once. Popularity in itself is no test of permanent literary fame, but the kind of it is and always has been a very decided one. Mr. Longfellow has been greatly popular because he so greatly deserved it. He has the secret of all the great poets--the power of expressing universal sentiments simply and naturally. A false standard of criticism has obtained of late, which brings a brick as a sample of the house, a line or two of condensed expression as a gauge of the poem. But it is only the whole poem that is a proof of the poem, and there are twenty fragmentary poets, for one who is capable of simple and sustained beauty. Of this quality Mr. Longfellow has given repeated and striking examples, and those critics are strangely mistaken who think that what he does is easy to be done, because he has the power to make it seem <b>so.</b> <b>We</b> <b>think</b> his chief fault is a too great tendency to moralize, or rather, a distrust of his readers, which leads him to point out the moral which he wishes to be drawn from any special poem. We wish, for example, that the last two stanzas could be cut off from [...] "The Two Angels," [...] a poem which, without them, is as perfect as anything in the language.|$|E
