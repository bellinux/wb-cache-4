40|$|Introduction: To {{minimize}} the risk of cross-infection between the patient and the medical staff, it is necessary to use individual protective measures such as gloves. According to the recommendations of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO), <b>protective</b> <b>gloves</b> should always be used upon contact with blood, mucosa, injured skin or other potentially infectious material. Materials and Methods: The aim {{of the study was to}} evaluate, through quasi-observation, the use of <b>protective</b> <b>gloves</b> by medical staff according to the guidelines issued by the CDC and WHO. The results were subject to statistical analysis (p < 0. 05). Results: During 1544 hours of observations, 3498 situations were recorded in which wearing <b>protective</b> <b>gloves</b> is demanded from the medical staff. The overall percentage of the observance of using gloves was 50 %. The use of gloves depended significantly on the type of ward, profession, performed activity, number of situations that require wearing gloves during the observation unit and the real workload. During the entire study, as many as 718 contacts with patients were observed in which the same gloves were used several times. Conclusion: Wearing disposable <b>protective</b> <b>gloves</b> by the medical staff is insufficient...|$|R

40|$|Abstract – Titanium dioxide {{nanoparticles}} (nTiO 2) {{are found}} in numerous manufactured products such as sunscreens and paints. Nevertheless, some studies have expressed concern about their likely harmful effects on health. Application of the precautionary principle {{has led to the}} recommendation for the use of <b>protective</b> <b>gloves</b> by numerous Health & Safety agencies. However, recent work has shown that solutions of nTiO 2 can penetrate the <b>protective</b> materials of <b>gloves</b> under conditions simulating occupational use. This study has been designed to identify some of the physical phenomena that may facilitate the penetration of nTiO 2 through elastomer membranes subjected to mechanical deformations (such as those produced by flexing the hand). Nitrile rubber and latex gloves were brought into contact with two solutions of nTiO 2. Mechanical deformations were applied to samples of <b>protective</b> <b>gloves</b> during their exposure to nanoparticles. Repetitive mechanical deformations affected both the physical and mechanical properties of protective materials. Moreover, the elastomers used in <b>protective</b> <b>gloves</b> were also shown {{to be sensitive to the}} action of the nTiO 2 solutions. Elastomer swelling was observed, leading to a modification of the mechanical and chemical properties of the gloves...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The aim of {{this study}} was to measure {{permeation}} of the herbicide dichlobenil in Casoron 4 G through disposable and chemically <b>protective</b> nitrile <b>gloves</b> using an American Society for Testing and Materials-type permeation cell and a closed-loop system employing two different solvents (hexane and water) and two different challenge situations (aqueous emulsion and solid formulation). Capillary gas chromatography–mass spectrometry was used for quantification purposes. The chemically <b>protective</b> <b>glove</b> did not allow any permeation up to 8 h for the solid-formulation and water-collection challenges, but permeation was detected in all other challenges. The disposable glove allowed the most permeation, and the solidformulation challenge with water collection necessitated that a dichlobenil equivalent be calculated because of the presence of its hydrolysis degradation product 2, 6 -dichlorobenzamide. Permeation from the solid formulation was detectable by hexane collection for both the disposable and chemically <b>protective</b> <b>gloves</b> and by water collection for the disposable glove. It was concluded that hexane-solvent collection was not valid for the disposable glove at 4 and 8 h of permeation in the solid Casoron challenge or for the aqueous emulsion challenge at 8 h relative to the watercollection solvent data.

Five of six patients with reactions to rubber gloves reacted to thiuram mix in the baseline series. Delayed reactions to reusable PVC gloves may be as common as to reusable NRL gloves.
