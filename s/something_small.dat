5|$|When we came {{to record}} it in the studio we {{struggled}} because there was something just not quite right about it and I wasn't happy about where we'd left it and where we were happy to leave it and we couldn't put our finger on what it was {{and so it was}} a really nice day one day, me and Chris were just trying, I was actually just trying to record bass at the time and me and Chris were just sitting down trying to brainstorm it and work out what was wrong and so I started trying to just do a few different bass lines and stuff. Between the two of us we came up with just this kind of groove, which stays on the same note as opposed to change, it's quite technical but it kind of added a bit of bounce to the song and it made it roll along in a much more fluid way. It was a bit mechanical before and it's just interesting how <b>something</b> <b>small</b> like that can really change the whole vibe of a song. It was just nice because from there on it was one of our favourite tracks and it almost didn't get on the record but it's now one of our favourite tracks.|$|E
25|$|The next affective {{emotion in}} this {{beginning}} stage is incompetence. Feeling incompetent can spring from multiple {{things in a}} relationship, but during {{the initial stages of}} infidelity a person can experience this on an increased level. Meaning, they begin to notice when their partner does not say thank you for simple things, or they overthink any change made by the unfaithful partner. This can lead to a suspicious partner feeling like they cannot please their significant other and begin to feel incompetent in the relationship. When someone is having incompetent feelings due to someone else’s actions they begin to resent them creating a build-up and eventually an affective emotion outburst over <b>something</b> <b>small.</b> The faithful partner is not normally aware that their suspicion is the reason they feel incompetent in the relationship, and do not expect to be so irritated by the change of simple things; making it an affective response in this stage of infidelity (Miller, 2017). These unanticipated emotions could lead to more and multiple responses such as this one within the future of the initial stage of infidelity.|$|E

The butterfly featured an array of colours and textures, it also represented <b>something</b> <b>small</b> which can start powerful and big movements, a phenomenon known as the butterfly effect, indicating that a flap from one butterfly can start a hurricane.|$|E

500|$|E-4 to E-6 are non-commissioned {{officers}} (NCOs), and {{are specifically}} called Petty Officers in the Navy. Petty Officers perform {{not only the}} duties of their specific career field but also serve as leaders to junior enlisted personnel. They must {{take responsibility for their}} subordinates, address grievances, inform the chain of command on matters pertaining to good order and discipline, and may even have to place personnel on report. The title Petty Officer comes from the French word petit, meaning <b>something</b> <b>small.</b> In medieval England, villages had several [...] "petite" [...] or [...] "petty" [...] officers who were subordinate to major officials. Thus, Petty Officers are assistants to senior officers.|$|E
500|$|Reality Entertainment, an {{independent}} film company Matti co-founded, co-produced On the Job with Star Cinema. Dondon Monteverde, co-founder of Reality Entertainment, {{said that many}} studios were impressed by the script but were reluctant to finance an expensive action film. The production team considered reducing the film's budget, but decided not to, hoping to shift away from making low-budget films; Monteverde recalled arguing that it was [...] "really {{time to do something}} big-budget and showcase it, rather than making <b>something</b> <b>small</b> and claiming budgetary restrictions. This time we didn't give ourselves any excuses. We went all the way". The production cost for the film amounted to ₱47 million (about US$1.1 million in 2013).|$|E
500|$|The {{top three}} {{finishers}} were escorted to the grandstand to collect their trophies. In an interview after the race, Szisz {{reflected on the}} [...] "anxiety" [...] he had felt as he drove the final laps: [...] "I feared <b>something</b> <b>small</b> which would take away victory {{at the moment when}} it had seemed to be won." [...] The prestige Renault gained from Szisz's victory led to an increase in sales for the company, from around 1,600cars in 1906 to more than 3,000 a year later, and increasing to more than 4,600 in 1908. But the race had not proven the superiority of the French motorcar; an Italian car had finished second and only seven of the twenty-three French cars that had started the race finished it.|$|E

2500|$|The concert special {{received}} a 0.5 rating of adults aged 18–49, and aired to 888,000 viewers. Adam Carlson of Time magazine described the special as unique, {{and felt that}} HBO's contributions were mostly simple and cheap [...] "embellishment" [...] which showcase hypnotizing imagery. He [...] summarised the tour special stating, [...] "Beyoncé and Jay-Z style themselves as a modern-day Bonnie and Clyde... But why settle for bank robbers? The pair, African Americans who write, produce, and perform their own music, are never just one thing to anyone. It has been a horrible... summer — for them, {{for all of us}} — but On The Run, a symphony of spectacles, absorbs all of that into <b>something</b> <b>small</b> that feels huge: the most important marriage in pop culture." [...] Erin Strecker of Billboard also gave the special a positive review, explaining that there were many high points from a musical perspective, before adding that the whole show was set up to look as one major high point with the pair changing turns to perform their songs as a medley showcasing their talents. He felt that it had something to offer to every viewer and added that the slow-motion footage focusing on Beyoncé and the audience was among the best executed of the special. Strecker chose the performance of [...] "Young Forever" [...] and [...] "Halo" [...] as the concert's highlight and finished his review concluding that [...] "the HBO special allowed fans to see them up close and at their best". Similarly, a writer of Rap-Up called the special a three-hour [...] "spectacular" [...] with the duo being at their finest.|$|E
2500|$|On January 10, 2007, Bush {{announced}} {{his plans for}} the Iraq War troop surge of 2007. The gist of this announcement had been known around the Capitol for over a week, and when the Associated Press asked Ellison for his reaction to the idea on January 8, 2007, he stated that it was [...] "way too late, way too little.... So rather than do <b>something</b> <b>small</b> and ineffective, why not get about the business of what we're {{going to have to do}} eventually, which is to begin to end the occupation?" [...] Ellison called for an immediate withdrawal in Iraq: [...] "We could describe it as a redeployment or withdrawal, but I think we have run the course in terms of our ability to resolve this conflict militarily. I think we need to have a political and economic and diplomatic engagement, and we need to encourage the forces that are in Iraq to begin to resolve the violence in Iraq." [...] When asked if he would support Bush's call for an additional $100 billion to fund the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, Ellison said, [...] "I want to see [...] first, I want to actually look at it, but I'm not inclined to continue to support a war or an occupation that he has no plans to get us out of, and which is so costly in terms of dollars and lives of American soldiers but also Iraqis." [...] The White House, when asked for a reaction to the comments, referred to a previous statement by press secretary Tony Snow: [...] "Democrats will have to decide where they stand on two issues: 'No. 1, do you want Iraq to succeed, and, if so, what does that mean? And, No. 2, do you believe in supporting the troops as you say, and how do you express that support?'" ...|$|E

Betrayal by the oligarchy during the decade prior to Perón’s first government is emphasized, for example, in Torres (1973) and Hernández Arregui (1973).|$|R

Another typical difference between pulpal and periodontal pain is that the latter is not usually made worse by thermal stimuli.|$|R

Bresler said his initial intention was to create an animated horror movie, but needed to do <b>something</b> <b>smaller</b> first in order to practice and learn. Bresler then compiled hours upon hours of interviews with his friends, picked what he thought to be the best content, and began animating characters {{to go along with the}} dialogue.|$|R

5000|$|In the {{traditional}} offline world of selling products {{there is something}} known as [...] "minimum viable product."

This {{is due to the}} fact that the most popular apps on the market are very nearly always those that are the single-function easiest to use apps available. People want apps that do one thing, and one thing only, does it quickly, easily and with some style. And that's it.|$|R
