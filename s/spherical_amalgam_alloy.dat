This study sought to enhance the compressive strength and setting time of a PC by adding {{one of the following}} additives: 20 % and 30 % poly-methylmethacrylate (PMMA), 20 % and 30 % irregular and spherical amalgam alloys, and 10 % CaCl 2. The control consisted of unreinforced PC specimens. Setting time was determined using a Gillmore apparatus according to standardized methods while compressive strength was measured using a universal testing machine after 21 hours or 60 days of water storage. Data were analyzed by ANOVA, Tukey and Games-Howell tests (&# 945; = 5 %). All additives significantly decreased both initial and final setting times as compared with the PC-control (p <. 05). 30 % PMMA and 30 % irregular alloy had the lowest values of initial setting time. 30 % irregular alloy also produced the lowest values of final setting time while 30 % spherical alloy yielded the highest (p <. 05). No differences were detected between the compressive strength values of 21 hours and 60 days. While 10 % CaCl 2, 20 % and 30 % PMMA produced values significantly lower than the PC-control, 30 % spherical alloy significantly improved the compressive strength of the reinforced PC (p <. 05). In summary, all additives significantly reduced the setting time and 30 % <b>spherical</b> <b>amalgam</b> <b>alloy</b> yielded a significant increase in compressive strength for the tested PC, which might represent an improved composition for PCs to expand their use as endodontic and potentially load bearing materials...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: JET-Fresh™ (Dentsply International, York, PA), a new airpolishing powder that {{contains}} aluminum trihydroxide as the abrasive agent, {{has been introduced}} for use with Prophy-Jet™ (Dentsply International). Purpose: The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the surface effects of aluminum trihydroxide airpolishing powder on a series of restorative materials. Materials and Methods: A total of 6 Class V preparations with enamel margins were created on the buccal surface of extracted human molars. The preparations were restored with Type III gold, a high copper <b>spherical</b> <b>alloy</b> <b>amalgam,</b> porcelain, a lightactivated hybrid composite material, a light-activated microfilled composite material, and a light-activated, resin-modified glass ionomer material. The distal half of each restoration was covered with fiberglass tape and the mesial half subjected to treatment with the aluminum trihydroxide powder via the Prophy-Jet™ for 5 seconds. After removal of the protective tape, the buccal surface of each treated tooth was replicated with impression material. Replicas were generated using epoxy resin and prepared for evaluation with scanning electron microscopy. Results: The aluminum trihydroxide produced surface alterations that were apparent visually and when viewed by a scanning microscope of the hybrid and microfilled composites and the glass ionomer restorations. The surfaces of the amalgam and gold restorations were altered, but not to the extent that the resin-based materials were. No disruption of the surface characterization of the porcelain was detected; however, with gold and porcelain materials, the aluminum trihydroxide removed notable amounts of the luting cements (the results are consistent with the data gathered with sodium bicarbonate powder). Conclusion: Aluminum trihydroxide as the abrasive agent in an airpolishing system should be avoided on resin composites, resin-modified composites, and around the margins of cemented restorations...|$|R

40|$|Background. The authors {{undertook}} {{a study to}} evaluate the effect of two cavity preparation methods on the initial survival of two more-viscous glass ionomer cements, or GICs, placed in the occlusal surfaces of permanent molar teeth. Methods. Three dentists placed 149 restorations in 68 adult patients in a hospital clinic. They used either atraumatic restorative treatment, or ART, or conventional cavity preparation methods to place two encapsulated esthetic conventional GICs: Fuji IX GP (GC International Corp., Tokyo) and Ketac-Molar Aplicap (3 M ESPE, Seefeld, Germany). For comparison, they used high-copper-content GK <b>Amalgam</b> <b>Alloy</b> (Advanced Technology & Materials Co. Ltd., Beijing) in conventional preparations. They evaluated the restorations using both direct and indirect observation methods. Results. Cavity preparations for which the authors used ART hand instruments took approximately twice as long to complete as did those for which they used conventional rotary instruments. After 12 months, no restorations had failed, but restorations comprising both GICs showed early losses of adjacent sealant material. Both GICs also showed relatively high restoration wear. At 12 months, the mean cumulative net occlusal wear for Fuji IX GP was 77 ± 47 micrometers, and for Ketac-Molar 83 ± 51 μm, without statistical significance (P >. 05). Color matching improved significantly with time (P <. 001), without significant differences in color between the two GICs by 12 months (P =. 09). The <b>amalgam</b> <b>alloy</b> had minor surface tarnishing and marginal discrepancies increased with time (P <. 001). Conclusions.
