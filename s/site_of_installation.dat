A permanent magnet that is powerful enough to be used in an MRI will be extremely large and bulky; they can weigh over 100 tonnes. Permanent magnet MRIs are very inexpensive to maintain; this cannot be said of the other types of MRI magnets, but there are significant drawbacks to using permanent magnets. They are only capable of achieving weak field strengths compared to other MRI magnets (usually less than 0.4 T) and they are of limited precision and stability. Permanent magnets also present special safety issues; since their magnetic fields cannot be [...] "turned off," [...] ferromagnetic objects are virtually impossible to remove from them once they come into direct contact.

40|$|Abstract: Manufacturers usually specify {{photovoltaic}} (PV) modules at {{standard test}} conditions of 21000 mW and Co 25, {{which may not be}} attainable anywhere in the world. Therefore, to determine the performance of PV modules at naturally occurring irradiance and ambient temperature, this paper proposes a theoretical methodology. This method could be used to predict the performance of PV modules given the irradiance and the ambient temperature at the <b>site</b> <b>of</b> <b>installation.</b> A novel technique that is based on the current-voltage characteristic model is used, it accounts for the variability in the environmental parameters. The irradiance and the ambient temperature of Zaria, Nigeria were used as an illustrative example, which showed the effects of the environmental conditions on the performance of PV modules...|$|E
40|$|Abstract- Turnout {{equipment}} plays a {{vital role}} in the safe operation of railroad systems. It is of great importance in ensuring safety and punctuality, and in the smooth operation of point switching mechanisms. Failure of switching gear due to climatic conditions at their <b>site</b> <b>of</b> <b>installation</b> is a frequent occurrence, in particular, breakdown resulting from the effects of snow and ice or of piled-up snow. To prevent this happening, heating equipment can be installed {{to get rid of the}} ice and snow. Generally speaking, a point heater comprises a heating system, an electricity supply unit, and various kinds of sensor. However, overheating sometimes occurs owing to failures caused by inadequate sensor installation, resulting in the heater becoming unusable. Therefore, a converter is proposed to prevent this overheating by controlling the electricity supply to the heater while detecting the ambient temperature without the use of such sensors...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In {{recent years}} {{there has been}} a growing {{attention}} towards use of solar energy. Advantages of photovoltaic (PV) systems employed for harnessing solar energy are reduction of greenhouse gas emission, low maintenance costs, fewer limitations with regard to <b>site</b> <b>of</b> <b>installation</b> and absence of mechanical noise arising from moving parts. However, PV systems suffer from relatively low conversion efficiency. Therefore, maximum power point tracking (MPPT) for the solar array is essential in a PV system. The nonlinear behaviour of PV systems as well as variations of the maximum power point with solar irradiance level and temperature complicates the tracking of the maximum power point. This paper reviews various MPPT methods based on three categories: offline, online and hybrid methods. Design of a PV system in a encoding environment has also been reviewed here. Furthermore, different MPPT methods are discussed in terms of the dynamic response of the PV system to variations in temperature and irradiance, attainable efficiency, and implementation considerations...|$|E

40|$|A {{high voltage}} {{composite}} insulator showed severe degradation and {{failure of the}} silicone elastomer sheds following service in a substation environment. Sensitive analytical techniques were used to investigate the extent of degradation of the silicone elastomer (SiE). The polymer content of some surface regions decreased as degradation increased. This was quantified through observation by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), weight loss upon heating using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), determination of surface "silica" levels in damaged areas by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Raman mapping through a cross-section of the elastomer producing a degradation depth profile. It is believed that due to the environmental conditions at the <b>site</b> <b>of</b> <b>installation,</b> the electric field may have reached corona onset threshold on parts of the elastomer surface. Because of the moist conditions the corona was maintained, effectively preventing the elastomer from regaining hydrophobicity and leading in time to severe degradation.

40|$|Many Solar PV modules exhibit {{significant}} loss {{in their}} expected performance due to variations in weather {{conditions such as}} ambient temperature and solar irradiance which result in inaccurate prediction of the module performance in the field. Obviously, the Standard Test Conditions (STC) and the Nominal Operating Cell Temperatures (NOCT) do not represent real operating conditions of PV module at the <b>site</b> <b>of</b> <b>installation.</b> This paper evaluates the performance of commercially used polycrystalline solar photovoltaic module KD 315 under Maiduguri-Nigeria weather conditions. The model of the PV module was implemented using a MATLAB program and the model parameters are evaluated using daily data of temperature and solar irradiance obtained from Maiduguri {{for a period of}} one year. Simulation results confirm that current generated is directly proportional to solar irradiance and is almost independent of temperature. The voltage of the module decreases by about 0. 5 % per degree centigrade temperature increase. It was found that the power produced by the panel is dependent on the solar irradiance and ambient temperature. The manufacturer’s maximum power of 315 W was achieved during the sunniest month. Thus the photovoltaic module exhibited good performance in the region under study...|$|E

40|$|Nowadays {{companies}} supplying medium/high voltage electric energy, near residential areas, {{tend to use}} underground cables laying. Hence {{the design}} engineer is required to estimate the thermal resistance around the underground cable to perform a right dimensioning of the cables; {{as a matter of}} fact what it should be avoided is the overheating determined by a bad heat dissipation due to the Joule effect. IEC rules provides a formula for the evaluation of the soil thermal resistance which is easy to apply. But from an experimental point of view, as the bibliography shows, it was discovered it tends to underestimate the problem when dealing with very dry soils in particular. Thanks to an experimental system, some useful data were collected for the validation of a 2 D FEM model of an excavated area with a linear heat source reproducing the underground conduit. The numerical model presents a variation of both the geometrical parameters of the excavated area and the distance characterizing other cables (hence heat sources) located in the same <b>site</b> <b>of</b> <b>installation</b> examined.

40|$|Abstract. Wind Turbines {{constitute}} a sustainable and effective {{solution for the}} production of energy using wind power. Offshore wind turbines especially are becoming of special interest. However, their design poses great challenges, since an offshore structure is subject to combined wind and wave dynamic loading that is characteristic of the <b>site</b> <b>of</b> <b>installation.</b> The {{purpose of this paper is}} to provide a case study of fatigue life assessment for the cross-section at mudline (foundation) of a standard offshore wind turbine with a monopile design, under a probabilistic framework and assuming the diameter and thickness of the examined cross-section as the design variables. Two potential sites of construction in the Aegean Sea of Greece (part of Mediterranean Sea) were examined. A probabilistic approach was employed in order to determine the fatigue life based on anemological data at each of the two sites of interest. At its basis is an extensive Monte Carlo simulation of wind (velocity) and wave (height, period) characteristics. The results show the dependence of fatigue life on the local wind and wave conditions, the cross-section size (e. g. diameter and thickness of the foundation’s pile) and the welded connection detail. All in all, the more benign conditions in the Aegean allow simpler connection details and smaller in size cross-section of foundation pile’s cross-section to still have acceptable performance. ...|$|E

In his 1862 essay “The Painter of ModernLife,” Charles Baudelaire defined modernity as fleeting, transitory and fragmentary. Baudelairean modernity initiated a breakdown of boundaries between art and life and between high art aesthetics and popular culture, which continues in the work <b>of</b> <b>installation</b> artists. In the <b>sites</b> <b>of</b> <b>installation</b> art, the spectator is compelled to extend – rather than complete – the work of art in his/her own time, prior experiential encounters and transformative after thoughts. The shift from the isolated work of art to the experiential one notonly complicates how and where works of art are viewed, but also radicalizes the materials that constitute the work of art – whether those materials are extracted from the quotidian sphere or complex technologies, each undergoes a process of defamiliarization and reactivation to produce the transformative aesthetic experience. The individual installations in Inhotim’s “outdoor museum” engage the spectator in a dynamic/participatory experience with spatial,temporal and material relationships that define the very essence of art’s reciprocity, or contrast with the natural and man-madeworlds. It is the rarefied setting of Inhotim’s botanical gardens that makes the participatory and transformative experience central to the aesthetic encounter with installation art...|$|R
