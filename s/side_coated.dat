50|$|Correction paper, or {{correction}} film, its plastic based equivalent, is a tab {{of plastic}} with one <b>side</b> <b>coated</b> with white correction material. It {{is used to}} correct typing errors made when using a typewriter. When inserted between the paper and the ribbon, the impression of the typebar presses {{the shape of the}} character into the film, which prints the white correction material onto the paper, hiding the erroneous character and preparing the document for the correct character.|$|E
50|$|An {{emerging}} {{method that}} produces a digital detector array with very small pixel sizes. The device has small (micrometer) channels through it, with the source <b>side</b> <b>coated</b> with a neutron absorbing material (generally gadolinium or boron). The neutron absorbing material absorbs neutrons and converts them into ionizing radiation that free electrons. A large voltage is applied across the device, causing the freed electrons to be amplified as they are accelerated through the small channels then detected by a digital detector array.|$|E

5000|$|In 2010, spherical silica Janus {{nanoparticles}} {{with one}} <b>side</b> <b>coated</b> with platinum {{were used for}} the first time to catalyze the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). [...] The platinum particle catalyzes the surface chemical reaction: 2H2O2 → O2 + 2H2O. The decomposition of hydrogen peroxide created Janus catalytic nanomotors, the motion of which was analyzed experimentally and theoretically using computer simulations. The motion of the spherical Janus nanoparticles was found to agree with the predictions of computed simulations. Ultimately, catalytic nanomotors have practical applications in delivering chemical payloads in microfluidic chips, eliminating pollution in aquatic media, removing toxic chemicals within biological systems, and performing medical procedures.|$|E
50|$|In the OM-2's Auto Dynamic Metering (ADM) {{system the}} first shutter curtain had the lens-facing <b>side</b> <b>coated</b> with a {{computer}} generated pattern of white blocks to emulate an average scene. As the mirror flipped-up the metering cell {{in the base of}} the mirror box measured the light reflected from the subject bouncing off this pattern of blocks. The timing of the release of the second curtain was adjusted in real time during the actual exposure. As the shutter speed increased, the actual light reflecting off the film surface was measured and the timing of the second curtain's release adjusted accordingly. This gave cameras equipped with this system the ability to adjust to changes in lighting during the actual exposure which was useful for specialist applications such as photomicrography and astronomical photography.|$|E

50|$|The {{self-assembly}} {{of certain}} types of Janus particles may be controlled by modifying the pH of their solution. Lattuada et al. prepared nanoparticles with one <b>side</b> <b>coated</b> with a pH-responsive polymer (polyacrylic acid, PAA) {{and the other with}} either a positively charged polymer (poly dimethylamino ethyl methacrylate, PDMAEMA), a negatively charged, pH-insensitive polymer, or a temperature-responsive polymer (poly-N-isopropyl acrylamide, PNIPAm). In changing the pH of their solution, they noticed a change in the clustering of their Janus nanoparticles. At very high pH values, where PDMAEMA is uncharged while PAA is highly charged, the Janus nanoparticles were very stable in solution. However, below a pH of 4, when PAA is uncharged and PDMAEMA is positively charged, they formed finite clusters. At intermediate pH values, they found that the Janus nanoparticles were unstable due to dipolar interaction between the positively and negatively charged hemispheres.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We {{present a}} novel method for {{fabrication}} of dou-ble <b>side</b> <b>coated</b> wafers by back-to-back Direct Wafer Bond-ing (DWB). Two 3 inch sapphire wafers (R-cut) were coated each with YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7 −δ by laser ablation on one side. The wafers were then directly bonded with their uncoated sides {{together in a}} microcleanroom. Subsequent heating increased the bond energy up to energies sufficient for fabrication of hybrid devices working at cryogenic temperatures. TEM cross sections reveal direct contact of the two sapphire lat-tices.

30|$|Surface {{morphology}} of the spin-coated samples on the GaAs substrates {{was investigated}} by a Nanoscope V Multimode Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) provided by Veeco Instrument. To minimize the sample damage, AFM imaging {{was performed in}} tapping mode, and observations were made with the AFM instrument placed on vibration isolation VT- 102 table {{in order to minimize}} the effects of vibration. The measurements were taken at well-stabilized room temperature to avoid thermal drift. During the imaging, both the scan rate and the imaging resolution were set at 0.2 Hz and 512 pixels, respectively. Ultra-high resolution tungsten tips purchased from Micro Masch with tip radius < 1 nm and back <b>side</b> <b>coated</b> with aluminum were used for the AFM experiments.

40|$|AbstractDiamond-like carbon (DLC) coating was {{deposited}} {{on both sides}} of double sided polished single crystalline germanium substrate by RF plasma enhanced chemical vapour deposition (RF-PECVD). DLC coatings were deposited at 100 sccm of C 2 H 2 flow and constant power of 200 W at deposition temperatures of room temperature (25 oC) and 150 oC. DLC coatings were analysed by ellipsometry, Raman analysis and Fourier-transform Infrared (FTIR). Characterizations confirmed the formation of DLC coatings with Id/Ig ration of 0. 5 to 1. 3 and, refractive index (n value) of 2. 38. DLC coating deposited at 150 oC shows low adherence than the room temperature deposition. Antireflection property was studied by FTIR in transmission mode.

40|$|Wafer-based {{crystalline}} silicon (c-Si) {{solar cells}} currently dominate the photovoltaic (PV) market with high-thermal budget (T > 700 ∘C) architectures (e. g. i-PERC and PERT). However, also low-thermal (T < 250 ∘C) budget heterojunction architecture holds {{the potential to}} become mainstream owing to the achievable high efficiency and the relatively simple lithography-free process. A typical heterojunction c-Si solar cell is indeed based on textured n-type and high bulk lifetime wafer. Its front and rear sides are passivated with less than 10 -nm thick intrinsic (i) hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) and front and rear <b>side</b> <b>coated</b> with less than 10 -nm thick doped a-Si:H layers. Finally, transparent conductive oxide (TCO) and metal at both front and rear side terminate the device. Of course, the front side metal is merely a grid, allowing light to impinge on the c-Si wafer. In this project, an HIT heterojunction architecture is investigated, it is used a double intrinsic passivating layer at the front and an highly hydrogenated (p) a-Si:H forming the emitter; i/n passivating stack at the rear in the role of back surface field; a TCO formed by IO:H and ITO and finally copper as front metal contact.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{different}} kinds of coating materials on the properties of flat pressed wood plastic composite (WPC) panels were studied in this work. Rotary-cut birch veneer, sliced oak veneer, phenolic impregnated paper, polyethylene (PE) film, and recycled polyethylene (rPE) layer were used as coating materials. One or two-side coating of WPC panels was carried out simultaneously with their fl at pressing. No coupling agents were used for production of WPC. It was found that properties of fl at pressed WPC panels improved by coating with all investigated coating materials. The highest values of modulus of rupture (MOR) were observed in WPC panels coated with rotary-cut birch veneer and MOR values were higher in along direction than in across direction of veneer fibers. The highest values of water resistance were observed in WPC coated with PE fi lm or rPE layer. Coating of WPC with natural veneer leads to the decreasing of water resistance. Besides, water resistance of WPC coated with one side of natural veneer was higher in comparison with two <b>side</b> <b>coated</b> WPC panels with natural veneer. The two-side coating of WPC with phenolic impregnated paper, PE film or rPE layer leads to the decreasing of water absorption and thickness swelling...|$|E
