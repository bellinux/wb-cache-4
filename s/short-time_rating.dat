(Using symmetrical components, this is Ia0 = Ib0 = Ic0.) Zero-sequence (earth fault) current exists between the transformer’s neutral to the faulting phase. The purpose of a zigzag transformer in this application is to provide a return path for earth faults on delta-connected systems. With negligible current in the neutral under normal conditions, providing the defective load will be automatically disconnected in a fault condition, an undersized transformer may be used only as <b>short-time</b> <b>rating</b> is required (i.e. the transformer can only carry full rated current for, say, 60 s).

40|$|The project {{involved}} the design, construction {{and testing of}} a 3000 kW converter-fed synchronous motor as a development prototype with - HTS rotor windings, - closed-circuit cooling system, - stator air-gap winding and -high-gradient HTS magnetic bearing. The project objective was to create the conditions necessary {{for the construction of}} an application-oriented model(#approx# 2 MW) that would be suitable for field tests and provide a starting point for subsequent series expansion. The main focus was fixed on feasibility and function issues relating to the various components, particularly during operation of the overall system in the test bay. These ambitious targets were achieved within the scope of project-based cooperation. This has been demonstrated especially in test bed operation of the machine since spring 2001, in the course of which the motor produced a maximum continuous rating of 450 kW - significantly above the specified value - while the <b>short-time</b> <b>rating</b> could be increased up to 600 kW. Throughout testing the motor demonstrated excellent performance characteristics that are markedly indifferent to load fluctuations and indicative of important operating advantages to subsequent users of such HTS motors. Loss calculations showed that, in terms of efficiency, this prototype already represents an approximately 1 % improvement over the conventional motors or generators currently available. The robustness of the cooling concept developed as part of the project was also convincingly demonstrated during the comprehensive test phase, which has been ongoing since spring 2001. The innovative pulse-tube coolers developed by our partner companies Leybold and TransMIT promise further advantages over current commercial GM-coolers. Despite considerable problems with materials the team successfully built and operated a contactless HTS magnet bearing (based on YBCO stator cylinders from partner company ATZ) that is currently one of the world's largest in terms of bearing capacity. A bearing of this type functions passively; in other words, it does not require any actively controlled electronic components and could therefore be an important development for high-speed machines in future. In the light of these positive results, additional questions were investigated in connection with the scaling-up of findings and procedures in the application-relevant power range of several MW and with the analysis of critical components (including winding technique, torque transmission, cooling). This further improved the prerequisites for successor projects and for subsequent implementation of the development results. (orig.)

40|$|We analyze {{data from}} {{simulations}} of 2 D and 3 D glass-forming liquids using a correlation function {{defined in terms}} of a memory function with a negative inverse power-law tail. The self-intermediate function and the autocorrelation functions of pressure and shear stress are analyzed; the obtained fits are very good, at least as good as with a stretched exponential. In contrast to the stretched exponential, the key shape parameter [...] the exponent of the power-law tail [...] seems to be the same for all three correlation functions. It decreases from a value around 2 at high temperature to a value close to 1. 58 (2 D), 1. 50 (3 D) at low temperatures. The amplitude of the tail increases towards towards a value corresponding to a diverging relaxation time, which is related to anomalous diffusion. On the other hand, careful analysis of the long time behavior in the case of suggests that the memory function is cut-off exponentially, which avoids the divergence of the relaxation time. Repeating the fits with an exponential cut-off included indicates that the power-law exponent is in fact independent of temperature and close to 1. 58 / 1. 50 over the whole range. Instead of the divergence, a fragile-to-strong crossover in the dynamics, estimated to occur around $T= 0. 40 $ for the 3 D Kob-Andersen system. Another key parameter of the fitting procedure may be interpreted as a <b>short-time</b> <b>rate,</b> the amount of decorrelation that occurs in a fixed, relatively short time interval (compared to the alpha time). This quantity is observed to have a near-Arrhenius temperature dependence, while its wavenumber dependence seems to be diffusive ($q^{- 2 }$) over a wider range than that of the relaxation itself, a further indication that this "bare relaxation rate" is simpler than the full dynamics.

They also investigate the impact of firm business conditions, structural characteristics, human capital investment and labour force composition on firm take-up rates.

Furthermore, the intensity of short-time work use increases with firm size, export share and share {{of research and development}} activities. Interestingly, the share of employees with higher educational attainment is associated with lower take-up, and the negative impact increases with the level of education. The share of employees on part-time or fixed-term contracts appears to reduce the share of firm employment in short-time work, supporting the hypothesis that permanent employees provide stronger incentives for firm participation. Finally, collective pay agreements do not have a clear effect on firm participation, although the impact may be negative.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{proposes a}} new wavelet-based {{algorithm}} for voice/unvoiced classification of speech segments. The classification process is based on: 1) {{statistical analysis of}} the energy-frequency distribution of the speech signal using wavelet transform, and 2) estimation of the <b>short-time</b> zero-crossing <b>rate</b> of the signal. First, {{the ratio of the}} average energy in the low-frequency wavelet subbands to that of highest-frequency wavelet subband is computed for each time segment of the pre-emphasised speech using a 4 -level dyadic wavelet transform, and compared to a pre-determined threshold. This is followed by measuring the zero-crossing rate of the segment and comparing it to a threshold determined by a continually up-dated value of the median of the zero-crossing rates of the speech signal. An experimentally verified criterion based on the re-sults of the above two comparison processes is then applied to obtain the classification decision.

The valuable information about wetting properties of synergetic mixtures {{can be obtained by}} using mixtures in which phase separation occurs at concentrations above cmc. Experiments: Spreading properties of mixed solutions of cationic and anionic surfactants over highly hydrophobic substrate such as polyethylene are investigated and compared with those for trisiloxane superspreader. Experiments are performed at relative humidity of 40 % and 80 %. Interfacial tension at water/air and water/alkane interfaces is measured to explain spreading performance. Findings: Catanionic solutions can wet hydrophobic substrates nearly as effective as solutions of trisiloxane superspreader. The spreading factor reaches 70 % of that of superspreader for the most effective mixed solution. The spreading slows down earlier at high surfactant concentrations. At room humidity (40 %) spread area has a maximum vs concentration. However, the maximum was not observed at higher humidity 80 %.

Therefore, this study was then to report a national data of the number of hip replacements, incidence rate, demographic characteristics of hip replacement patients, and <b>short-time</b> survival <b>rate</b> after hip replacement of Han Chinese in Taiwan. Methods We analyzed 105, 688 cases of hip replacements (including primary partial hip replacement, primary total hip replacement and revision of hip replacement) from National Health Insurance research database between 1996 and 2004. The survival rate of primary hip replacement was estimated for each disease by the Kaplan-Meier method. Results Average annual number of primary partial hip replacement and primary total hip replacement were 4, 257 and 6, 206 cases, respectively. The most two common diagnosis of primary partial hip replacement were femoral neck fractures (73. 6 %, 34 % men, mean age 76 years) and avascular necrosis (18. 0 %, 84 % men, mean age 48 years). In primary total hip replacements, the most two common diagnosis were avascular necrosis (46. 9 %, 79 % men, mean age 50 years) and osteoarthrosis (41. 6 %, 43 % men, mean age 60 years).

It's well-known that using the perfect a-priori knowledge of the pitch can improve the performance of tone discrimination and speech recognition [45]. However, the proposed methods can achieve better performance even with nonperfect pitch and formant estimation, which is shown by the fact that, although {{the improvement of the}} consonant recognition is not so statistically significant, it at least does not decrease despite using essentially invalid initial pitch estimates. This also indicates that the FrFT-MFCC features might degrade more gracefully with increasing noise level than the initial estimates of pitch and formants that are used to derive them. Furthermore, FrFT-MFCC is shown to improve tone and vowel discrimination compared to FFT-MFCC even though pitch harmonics are blended by the mel-frequency filterbank and formants are partially smeared {{as a consequence of the}} FrFT analysis. This forms one of the major outcomes of the study and indicates that the benefit of the FrFT-MFCC does not just result from the fact that initial pitch estimates are used. FrFT-MFCC features seem to provide a better combination of pitch and formant-related information than FFT-MFCC and this might be beneficial for ASR.|$|R

As we previously described [Roos et al., J. Biol. Chem. 272 (1997) 15849 – 15855], this transport process is regulated by extravacuolar adenylates at their physiological concentrations. We now show, using our test object Penicillium cyclopium, {{that not only}} purine but also pyrimidine nucleotides {{are involved in the}} control of efflux of vacuolar phenylalanine. At 0. 1 mM adenosine or guanosine phosphates inhibit, whereas cytidine or uridine phosphates stimulate the rate of efflux. At 1 mM the same nucleotides have no measurable impact on efflux but abolish the effects of other nucleotides present at 0. 1 mM. This argues for at least two interacting binding sites with different nucleotide affinities. The minimum structural requirement for any of the observed effects is a non-cyclic ribonucleoside monophosphate. In intact cells, cytosolic concentrations of ATP (representing purine nucleotides) and CTP (representing pyrimidine nucleotides) are 1 – 2 mM and 0. 05 – 0. 2 mM, respectively. ATP is therefore assumed to dominate transport control and allow optimum efflux (and uptake) <b>rates.</b> <b>Short-time</b> starvation of carbon and nitrogen adjusts CTP and ATP at levels that cause declining efflux rates. During prolonged starvation both nucleotides fall below their transport-controlling concentrations and thus allow increasing rates of efflux from the still maintained vacuolar pool. Hence, efflux control under nutrient limitation includes an interplay of purine and pyrimidine nucleotides which precisely regulates the release of vacuolar amino acids and enables flexible adjustment to either amino acid saving or cell survival...|$|R
40|$|Master of ScienceBiochemistry and Molecular BiophysicsJianhan ChenProteins are {{fundamental}} {{building blocks of}} life in an organism, and to function properly, they must adopt an appropriate three-dimensional conformation or conformational ensemble. In protein aggregation diseases, proteins misfold to incorrect structures {{that allow them to}} join together and form aggregates. A wide variety of proteins are involved in these aggregation diseases and there are multiple theories of their disease mechanism. However, a common theme is that they aggregate into filamentous structures. Therapies that target the process by which the aggregating proteins assemble into these similar fibril-like structures may by effective at countering aggregation diseases. This requires models that can accurately describe the assembly process of the fibrils. An analytical theory was recently described where fibrils grow by the templating of peptides onto an existing amyloid core and the kinetics of the templating process is modeled as a random walk in the backbone hydrogen bonding space. In this thesis, I present my work integrating molecular simulation with this analytical model to investigate the dependence of fibril growth kinetics on peptide sequence and other molecular details. Using the Aβ 16 - 22 peptide as a model system, we first calculate the rate matrix of transitions among all possible hydrogen bonding microscopic states using numerous <b>short-time</b> simulations. These <b>rates</b> were then used to construct a kinetic Monte Carlo model for simulations of long-timescale fibril growth. The results demonstrate the feasibility of using such a theory/simulation framework for bridging the significant gap between fibril growth and simulation timescales.

In particular, we found that dynamics in nonspecifically bound states must also be considered. Possible solutions to this deficiency are discussed at the end...|$|R

Results obtained from the international surveys on AI applications in power systems show that an interest in applications of Al to power system problems is growing strongly. Al is a promising technology that will be able to fill the gap between human capabilities and difficulties involved in the daily operation and planning of modern power systems. The work presented in this thesis addresses the aspects of Al applications to steady state security control in power systems. This research focuses on two major issues. Firstly, analysis of the methods employed in steady state security control and identification of potential Al applications where the existing methods are deficient. The second task is the development of decision-support systems to incorporate operator knowledge, provide an interactive-mode interface to users, and improve the computational speed. Three decision-support systems have been developed: • an intelligent system for determination of short-time thermal ratings and permissible overload duration of transmission lines using the rule-based expert system and artificial neural network. • a prototype expert system for transmission line overload alleviation using database, rule-based, and sensitivity tree approaches. • a prototype expert system for voltage control and reactive power compensation using rule-based and sensitivity tree approaches. The following methods have been proposed and implemented in the development of the above decision-support systems: • Determination of permissible overload duration of transmission lines based on the <b>short-time</b> thermal <b>rating.</b> • Estimation of instantaneous solar radiation employed in the determination of thermal rating of transmission lines using artificial neural network and regression techniques. • Estimation of the distance to a voltage collapse using the stability margin analysis. • Automatic allocation of static and dynamic reactive power compensation to improve solution of voltage security and stability control. • Reduction of the computation time for voltage and reactive power control using the "three-tier" network equivalencing technique. The decision-support systems have been successfully tested on several power systems, such as the IEEE 30 -bus, AEP 57 -bus, and real 293 -bus power system of the Hydro-Electric Commission of Tasmania. Results obtained show that the decision-support systems provide fast and correct solutions with advice on control actions expressed in the natural language form. Therefore, the intelligent systems developed can be effectively applied to assist operators in the detection and alleviation of line overload and bus voltage violation problems in power systems. Nineteen refereed technical papers have been published including three in international scientific journals. The research results have been applied to current practice in the Hydro-Electric Commission of Tasmania for planning and operation studies...|$|R
40|$|The {{severity}} of water repellency was investigated {{on a wide}} range of agricultural, horticultural and turf soils in New Zealand. All the soils studied had some degree of repellency, regardless of texture or land use. Techniques for repellency measurement and amelioration were evaluated and the organic component responsible for repellency development investigated. The temporal and extreme spatial variability of repellency expression was quantified using geostatistics. The 'repellency index' (RI) based upon soil intrinsic sorptivity was developed and evaluated on 14 New Zealand soils. The RI measured undisturbed cores of all the soils water repellent at field moisture conditions and was more sensitive than the MED or water drop penetration time (WDPT) tests. The RI was used to demonstrate that repellency reduced the <b>short-time</b> infiltration <b>rate,</b> i of all the soils by approximately an order of magnitude, including those which appeared to wet normally (i. e. low WDPT). Calculations identified that the reduction in i would be hydrologically significant under intense rainfall and many irrigation systems. Investigation of a development sequence of yellow-brown sands (Aquic Udipsamments) revealed maximum repellency in < 130 y old Waitarere sand, which had the lowest level of organic carbon. Repellency was also severe in the Motuiti and Himatangi sands (c. 500 y) but declined in the Foxton (1600 - 6000 y) and Koputaroa (10000 - 25000 y) soils. While water repellency (measured with the Molarity of Ethanol Droplet, MED test) of the Himatangi sand profile was correlated with organic carbon content, this was not the case with the other soils. Organic matter composition is a more likely determinant of the degree of repellency than organic matter quantity per se. Spectroscopic examination of extracts removed from Himatangi sand by an isopropanol/ammonia mixture using a soxhlet apparatus indicated a range of long chain organic compounds comprising esters and fatty acids as the cause of repellency. The spatial variability of volumetric soil water content (θ) to 200 mm depth at two adjacent sites (A and B) of Himatangi sand, each c. 860 m 2, was studied with geostatistical techniques. At both sites θ varied isotropically and generally followed a normal distribution. Variograms of θ changed over time and were not transferable between the two sites, although there was evidence of drift in the mean at site B. At site A, compared to an October analysis, in summer the coefficient of variation (C. V.) of θ increased and the range of θ spatial dependence, a decreased. Irrigation of both site A and B with a travelling boom slightly increased C. V. (θ), markedly increased the semivariance and slightly decreased a(θ) at site A. When a wetting agent was applied prior to irrigation of site A the C. V. (θ) halved, a(θ) increased and the θ increase was improved by 63 % over irrigation of site A and 206 % over irrigation of site B. Agitation of soil samples reduced repellency significantly, however the effect was somewhat reversible and field cultivation could be precluded by the degree and depth of the repellent topsoil. Soil wetting agents increased grass establishment and growth in both glasshouse and field experiments. In the glasshouse, wetting agent performance was not affected by delayed initial irrigation, however short irrigation return intervals improved plant growth in both untreated and wetting agent treated soil. A survey of golf courses throughout New Zealand found that repellency was a major management problem. Soil cores were removed from areas of greens displaying repellency symptoms ('dry patch') and from areas of compatatively healthy turf. No significant difference was found between the MED profile or the thatch content of the dry patch and non-dry patch cores. Dry patch areas were found to match the poorly irrigated areas of a green using a simple 'catch-can' test, which indicated that irrigation uniformity affected repellency expression in turf...|$|R
