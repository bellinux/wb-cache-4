2500|$|Steelcase's most {{noteworthy}} products include [...] "The Victor" [...] wastebasket, a patented steel fireproof container {{released in}} 1914. The Victor became a top seller for the recently founded company and was eventually expanded into {{a line of}} products. The company released Multiple 15 desks in 1946, which introduced standardized desk sizing and became a universal industry standard. Series 9000 was released in 1973 and became Steelcase's most popular line of office systems. The Leap chair, introduced in 1999, sold 5,000 units a week during its first year and became the company's most popular release. The ergonomic office chair was designed with eight adjustable areas for users to control, including chair height, armrest positioning, lumbar <b>support,</b> <b>seat</b> depth, and back positioning. The chair was developed over four years, cost $35 million to design, and resulted in 11 academic studies and 23 patents. The company released the Gesture chair in 2013, {{which is designed to}} support the way workers naturally sit.|$|E
50|$|Pedersen {{wrote that}} he {{developed}} the hammock style seat first. It provides suspension from road imperfections with much less weight, 4 oz instead of 3 lb of traditional leather and steel spring saddles of the day. Pedersen then developed a frame, a truss assembled from several thin tubes, around his new seat design. He attributed his inspiration to the Whipple-Murphy bridge truss. The design initially did not <b>support</b> <b>seat</b> height adjustment, and even after some adjustability was added, required the manufacture of eight different sizes. The non-standard frame design would not accommodate a traditional front fork. Instead, Pedersen developed a fork that also consisted of thin tubes assembled into a truss, which {{was attached to the}} frame with bearings at two distinct points, instead of through a traditional head tube. Pedersen also received patents for a chainwheel and bottom bracket combination and lightweight pedals.|$|E

40|$|A better {{understanding}} of attitudes and behavioral principles underlying driving behavior and traffic safety issues can contribute to design and policy solutions, such as, speed limits and seat belt legislation. This work examines the Motor Vehicle Occupant Safety Surveys (MVOSS) data set to illuminate drivers ’ seatbelt use, driving speed choices, drinking-and-driving tendencies, along with their attitudes towards speed limits and seat belt laws. Ordered probit, negative binomial, and linear regression models {{were used for the}} data analysis, and several interesting results emerged. For example, persons of higher income and with a college education prefer higher speeds, are more likely to use a seat belt, {{and are more likely to}} <b>support</b> <b>seat</b> belt laws and/or higher speed limits. However, persons with a college education also tend to drink and drive more often. Pickup drivers are less likely to use seat belts, less likely to <b>support</b> <b>seat</b> belt laws, yet less likely to drink and drive. The number and variety of results feasible with this single data set are instructive as well as intriguing...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Aims This study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} {{the changes in the}} spine curvatures and the sensations caused by different types of seats: standard, ischial support and salli. Methods The analyzes were performed by the kinematics and scales of discomfort and pain in 14 healthy subjects. The data collection occurred in three days, one day for each type of seat. The subjects answered questionnaires and were assessed for placement of kinematic markers used to measure the thoracic, thoraco-lumbar and lumbar angles. Each trial was conducted in a sixty-minute period on each chair. Results and conclusions The results showed that the salli seat type causes larger lumbar angles, which is consistent with the maintenance of lumbar lordosis. Likewise, the salli seat showed smaller thoraco-lumbar angle, which is consistent with smaller inferior thoracic kyphosis. Paradoxically, the ischial <b>support</b> <b>seat</b> produced less discomfort and pain than salli type. And finally, the longer the sitting position was the higher the score on the discomfort scale...|$|E
40|$|Ergonomic is the {{application}} of scientific principles, methods and data {{to the development of}} products and systems that interact with human. A product may be ergonomically designed for a specific application. The product selected must be matched the characteristics of the required operations and the characteristics of the people who use the products. Correct sitting posture is an important factor for the prevention of musculoskeletal symptoms. Then, ergonomic furniture should be designed because it can reduce pain and injury, increase productivity, improve morale and decrease complaints. Office chair {{has been one of the}} most required furniture for over hundreds of years especially for office use. However, as the increasing of the demand to produce the office chair, there are several problems commonly occur to clerk. So, the main objectives of this project are to improve the design of office chair with ergonomic features for the office use and to minimize the risk factor of musculoskeletal disorders faced by the clerk. At the end of this project, a new design of office is proposed by using Solid Work software. There are some improvements have been made to the some parts of existence office chair including back <b>support,</b> <b>seat</b> pan, armrest and seat height. The proposed design is different in terms of shape, measurement and also equipped with the ergonomic features. As the result of this improvement, the objective to reduce disorders faced by the clerk can be achieved...|$|E

40|$|In 1997, ISO 2631 - 1 (Evaluation {{of human}} {{exposure}} to whole body vibration- General requirement) was published. At ISO 2631 - 1, the common indicator {{for evaluating the}} health, discomfort, perception, and motion sickness about whole body vibration is defined, and it is decided by evaluation of the discomfort when the human is taking-a-seat posture that vibrating 12 -axis included {{in the human body}} of the <b>supporting</b> <b>seat</b> surface, the seat-back and the feet is measured simultaneously. 6 -axis (3 -axis vibration: x, y and z, and 3 -axis rotational vibration: roll, pitch, yaw) in the <b>supporting</b> <b>seat</b> surface did not correspond to 3 -axis seat pickup defined by ISO 5008, and did not have the way measured actually. Moreover, there were also no measuring instruments, which can carry out simultaneous measurement of the 12 -axis based on ISO- 2631 - 1 standard. Therefore, there are very few studies investigating 12 axes vibration data on the different kinds of vehicle seats according to the ISO 2631 - 1 standard for evaluating perception or discomfort of multi-axis vibration. The growing importance of detrimental vibrations on mobile machinery, magnified by increasing working speed, emphasizes the need to evolve from static to dynamic design of mechanical systems. Data on which to base developments of standard multi-axis prediction techniques for discomfort were therefore limited. There were no special equipments as a commercial base to measure 12 axes vibration on the vehicle seats in the world. Therefore, in order to solve this problem, 6 -axis seat pickup was developed. The 12 -axis vibration measurement on the seat was realizable with this 6 -axis seat pickup. In this research, the 12 -axis vibration measurements in actual operating conditions were performed for various vehicle seats and compared...|$|R

25|$|Initially, 2500 Indy 500 replica pacers—100 {{for each}} year of production—were {{scheduled}} for sale. But {{it was decided that}} each of Chevrolet's 6502 dealers should have one for showroom display. Thus what was called the Limited Edition Indy Pace Car Replica Corvette made up some 15 percent of total production. Like the Silver Anniversary model, the Pace Car Replica was actually an option package-RPO Z78. Its main distinction was black over silver metallic with a bright red pinstripe in between with a spoiler added to each end to alter appearance more dramatically. Pace car interiors reflected Bill Mitchell's influence, with full silver leather or silver leather/gray cloth upholstery and gray carpeting. All replicas were equipped with new thin-shell design-lumbar <b>support</b> <b>seats,</b> new glass t-tops, alloy wheels, power windows, air conditioning, tilt/telescope steering wheel, power locks, rear defogger, sport mirrors, heavy-duty battery, and AM/FM stereo with either eight-track tape player or CB radio.
