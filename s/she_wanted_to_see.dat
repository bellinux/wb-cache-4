500|$|In {{the book}} The Adventures of Esplandián, after many pages of battles and adventures, {{the story of}} Calafia is {{introduced}} as a curiosity, an interlude in the narrative. Calafia is introduced as a regal black woman, courageous, strong of limb and large of person, full in the bloom of womanhood, the most beautiful of {{a long line of}} queens who ruled over the mythical realm of California. She is said to be [...] "desirous of achieving great things"; <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the world and plunder a portion of it with superior fighting ability, using her army of women warriors. She commanded a fleet of ships with which she demanded tribute from surrounding lands, and she kept an aerial defense force of griffins, fabulous animals which were native to California, trained to kill any man they found.|$|E
500|$|Catherine pressed Jeanne d'Albret {{to attend}} court. Writing that <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Jeanne's children, she {{promised not to}} harm them. Jeanne replied: [...] "Pardon me if, reading that, I want to laugh, {{because you want to}} relieve me of a fear that I've never had. I've never thought that, as they say, you eat little children". When Jeanne did come to court, Catherine {{pressured}} her hard, playing on Jeanne's hopes for her beloved son. Jeanne finally agreed to the marriage between her son and Margaret, so long as Henry could remain a Huguenot. When Jeanne arrived in Paris to buy clothes for the wedding, she was taken ill and died on 9 June 1572, aged forty-three. Huguenot writers later accused Catherine of murdering her with poisoned gloves. The wedding took place on 18 August 1572 at Notre-Dame, Paris. Frieda dismisses this accusation based on the fact Catherine had nothing to gain from her death, once the marriage contract had been signed, although Frieda considered Catherine responsible for Philibert le Vayer, who was Duke of Anjou's favourite.|$|E

2500|$|David Suzuki - Suzuki's {{appearance}} on Air Farce is memorable, as he appeared nude in the sketch (although the nudity {{was covered by}} a briefcase and later a desk), a parody of an ad campaign Suzuki participated in for his show The Nature of Things.

2500|$|By all accounts, Nadezhda von Meck was {{imperious}} by nature, {{presiding over}} her household despotically. She {{expected to have}} her own way, so surrounded herself only with people who would give it to her, and she ruled her children's lives in every detail. [...] As they grew into adulthood, she arranged their marriages, bought houses for them, and even chose furniture for their houses. When <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> her married children, she summoned rather than invited them. [...] Understandably, her children were not always grateful for the extreme degree of their mother's care (or meddling, depending on the viewpoint of the person concerned).|$|E

[...] "Sōnan" [...] was the first song she wrote for the album in 2003, shortly after the tour finished. The theme of each Tokyo Jihen album is based around a television channel, and Kyōiku was themed around NHK Educational TV.|$|E
