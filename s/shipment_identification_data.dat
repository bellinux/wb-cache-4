50|$|The {{employees}} of the Interior Ministry would be authorized to collect biometric <b>identification</b> <b>data</b> from the Israeli population, and to transfer the data to a database which would be managed by the biometric database management authority (הרשות לניהול המאגר הביומטרי).

30|$|To this end, {{the edge}} router creates 42 bytes {{signature}} value (size of ECDSA digital signature with 160 bits elliptical curve key) by applying ECDSA signing algorithm to 60 bits <b>identification</b> <b>data</b> plus 13 bytes flow ID. This 42 bytes signature should also {{transfer to the}} destination along with 60 bits of <b>identification</b> <b>data.</b> Obviously, {{it is not a}} good idea to embed 42 bytes of data to the IP header because embedding 42 bytes data and 60 bits <b>identification</b> <b>data</b> to 32 bits marking field requires at least 13 packets, while looking at Table  6 shows that K[*]=[*] 13 has a bad TR (64 % to 88 %). So we decided to add 42 bytes ECDSA digital signature to the end of the K th packet payload of each flow. It is assumed that when this system is used it would be known that DFM is using ECDSA signing algorithm.|$|R

50|$|Conventional {{explicit}} certificates {{are made}} up of three parts: <b>identification</b> <b>data,</b> a public key and a digital signature which binds the public key to the user’s <b>identification</b> <b>data</b> (ID). The digital certificate is created by a trusted third party and its signature can be independently verified by anyone in the network. The public key, ID and digital signature are distinct data elements which make up the physical size of the certificate. Conventional certificates can get very large. For example, a standard X.509 certificate is on the order of 1KB in size (~8000 bits).|$|R
