40|$|It {{is known}} from {{operation}} history {{of nuclear power}} plants (NPPs) that human factors considerations and human reliability analysis (HRA) are necessary for complete safety analysis of NPPs. HRA is usually performed to estimate the influence of human errors on the unavailability of various safety systems of NPPs;The objective of this work is to assess quantitatively the human contribution to the unavailability of those safety systems involved in the S(, 2) C accident sequence. S(, 2) C sequence {{is defined as a}} small loss of coolant accident (LOCA) and core meltdown after containment failure. This sequence is selected for this study because it makes a significant contribution to risk. In order to do that, gross operator error rates were estimated using past experience in the operation of pressurized water reactors (PWR) for the failure mode involving valves in those systems in the S(, 2) C sequence. These systems are the containment <b>spray</b> <b>injection</b> <b>system</b> (CSIS), the containment spray recirculation system (CSRS), the containment heat removal system (CHRS) and the sodium hydroxide addition system (SHAS). The information was extracted from the licensee event reports (LERs). Appropriate statistical methods were used to estimate the error rates and the unavailabilities of those systems. A comparison was made with other estimates reported in other sources. Sources used were the Handbook of Human Reliability Analysis with Emphasis on NPP Applications (NUREG/CR- 1278) and the Reactor Safety Study (WASH- 1400). The estimated error rates from these sources were used to analyze the modified fault trees for the CSIS and CHRS systems. Fault tree analysis (FTA) is commonly used in reliability analysis and probabilistic risk assessment (PRA). The reliability analysis of the CSIS and CHRS was carried out by means of a fault tree methodology using the PREP and KITT- 1 codes. It was found that the unavailability, Q, estimated using LERs for the two systems is comparable to that obtained using the other two sources of data...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an {{experimental study of}} an air-assisted, direct fuel injector in a constant volume chamber. This injector is the principal component of a <b>spray</b> guided <b>injection</b> <b>system</b> manufactured by Orbital Australia, Pty. Ltd. Ensemble averaged, planar images of the laser induced fluorescence (LIF) and Mie scattering from the spray are obtained to measure the Sauter mean diameter (SMD) for varying injection and chamber pressures. Back-illuminated images are also obtained at the same conditions, and the penetration length and spray width are also determined. Non-dimensional parameters for both the SMD and the penetration rate are then proposed, and which achieve good collapse of the experimental results. This demonstrates the significant injection parameters that control the spray behaviour...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAccurate {{characterization}} of swirled flames {{is a key}} point {{in the development of}} more efficient and safer aeronautical engines. The task is even more challenging for <b>spray</b> <b>injection</b> <b>systems.</b> From one side, spray interacts with both turbulence and flame, eventually affecting the flame dynamics. On the other side, the structure of turbulent spray flame is highly complex due to equivalence ratio inhomogeneities caused by evaporation and mix- ing processes. The first objective of this work is to numerically characterize the structure and dynamics of a swirled spray flame. The target configuration is the experimental bench- mark named MERCATO, representative of an actual turbojet <b>injection</b> <b>system.</b> Due to the complex nature of the flame, a detailed description of chemical kinetics is necessary and is here obtained by using a 24 -species chemical scheme, which has been expressly developed for DNS of spray flames. The first LES of a swirled spray flame using such a detailed chemical description is performed here and results are analyzed to study the complex inter- actions between the spray, the turbulent flow and the flame. It is observed that this coupling has an effect on the flame structure and that flame dynamics are governed by the interactions between spray, precessing vortex core and flame front. Even if such a detailed kinetic description leads to an accurate {{characterization of}} the flame, it is still highly expensive in terms of CPU time. Tabulated techniques have been expressly developed to account for detailed chemistry at a reduced computational cost in purely gaseous configurations. The second objective is then to verify the capability of the FPI tabulated chemistry method to correctly reproduce the spray flame characteristics by performing LES. To do this, results with the FPI method are compared to the experimental database and to the results obtained with the 24 -species description in terms of mean and fluctuating axial gas velocity and liquid phase characteristics (droplet diameter and liquid velocity). Moreover, the flame characterization obtained with the FPI approach is compared to the results of the 24 -species scheme focusing on the flame structure, on major and minor species concentrations as well as on pollutant emissions. The potential and the limits of the tabulated approach for spray flame are finally assessed...|$|R

The comparison between two different numerical schemes, the standard Jameson-Schmidt-Turkel (JST) scheme and the advection upstream splitting method (AUSM), is performed for the cold flow and the reacting flow calculations using the RANS. In the cold flow calculation, the AUSM scheme predicts a much stronger reverse flow in the central recirculation zone. In the reacting flow calculation, we test two cases: gaseous fuel <b>injection</b> and liquid <b>spray</b> <b>injection.</b> In the gaseous fuel injection case, the overall flame structures of the two schemes are similar to one another, {{in the sense that}} the flame is attached to the main nozzle, but is detached from the pilot nozzle.
