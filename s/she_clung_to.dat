60|$|But <b>she</b> <b>clung</b> <b>to</b> her brother's neighbourhood, {{she knew}} not why.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>clung</b> <b>to</b> {{him like}} a child wearied with its own naughtiness.|$|E
60|$|He passed on, {{scarcely}} heeding her words, but <b>she</b> <b>clung</b> <b>to</b> his arm.|$|E
60|$|As Hetty {{said the}} last words, <b>she</b> <b>clung</b> closer <b>to</b> Dinah, shuddering.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> still <b>clung</b> <b>to</b> him, craving so to {{have him}} that he could not be reft away.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> still <b>clung</b> <b>to</b> the coaming, but he fancied {{that her}} misgivings were vanishing, {{and he spoke}} again.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>clung</b> <b>to</b> {{him with}} a sudden abandon. She was white to the lips.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>clung</b> <b>to</b> his {{arm through}} the dim-lighted {{passages}} {{and down the}} narrow stairs.|$|E
60|$|Her mood {{changed at}} once. <b>She</b> <b>clung</b> <b>to</b> him, {{pressing}} his hand between her own.|$|E
6000|$|... "Do not stop, mejuffrouw, to parley {{with any}} of these scamps," [...] said Maria as <b>she</b> <b>clung</b> fearsomely <b>to</b> her mistress's cloak.|$|R
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>clung</b> {{wild and}} <b>she</b> <b>clung</b> mute with her shuddering lips half-shut. [...] Toll slowly. [...] Her head fallen as half in swound, hair and knee swept on the ground, [...] <b>She</b> <b>clung</b> wild <b>to</b> stirrup and foot.|$|R
60|$|Confidence and dismay {{seemed to}} {{struggle}} {{together in the}} face of the girl, but the former rose uppermost, for <b>she</b> <b>clung</b> fast <b>to</b> hope.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>clung</b> <b>to</b> {{him with}} {{suddenly}} swimming eyes. Her lips trembled--her face was very wistful.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>clung</b> <b>to</b> my arm, {{and pulled}} at my coat {{in a perfect}} frenzy of fear.|$|E
60|$|He kissed her, and <b>she</b> <b>clung</b> <b>to</b> {{him as if}} he were {{something}} too precious to release.|$|E
60|$|And <b>she</b> <b>clung</b> close <b>to</b> Birkin. Suddenly she {{realised}} she did {{not know}} what he was thinking. She did not know where he was ranging.|$|R
6000|$|Sir Claude {{watched her}} as <b>she</b> charmingly <b>clung</b> <b>to</b> the child. [...] "I'm {{so glad you}} really care for her. That's {{so much to the}} good." ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>clung</b> tighter <b>to</b> him, trembling. He became serious again. [...] "Dear, you mustn't worry," [...] he said. [...] "It can't be helped. He'll come round. Once we're married--" ...|$|R
60|$|When they rose, {{her feet}} were so numbed she could hardly stand. <b>She</b> <b>clung</b> <b>to</b> Siegmund, laughing.|$|E
60|$|But the giddy {{girl had}} darted past him, and, {{face to the}} wall of the cliff, was {{creeping}} along the dangerous path. Rand followed mechanically. Once or twice the trail crumbled beneath her feet; but <b>she</b> <b>clung</b> <b>to</b> a projecting root of chaparral, and laughed. She had almost reached her elected goal, when, slipping, the treacherous chaparral <b>she</b> <b>clung</b> <b>to</b> yielded in her grasp, and Rand, with a cry, sprung forward.|$|E
60|$|She looked up, still {{clinging}} to him as <b>she</b> <b>clung</b> <b>to</b> the hope of her better life to come.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Fiddlesticks!' said Mrs. Crowley, sharply. 'I {{should have}} liked her much better if <b>she</b> had <b>clung</b> <b>to</b> {{her brother and}} sobbed {{and had to be}} torn away.' ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>clung</b> closer <b>to</b> his knee--"Ay, {{beneath the}} cypress-tree!" [...] Toll slowly. [...] "Mock me not, for otherwhere than along the {{greenwood}} fair [...] Have I ridden fast with thee.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, father!" [...] The cry {{came from}} Mrs. Morris and <b>she</b> <b>clung</b> close <b>to</b> her husband, while little Nell {{set up a}} wild sobbing. [...] "Must we leave it all--everything?" ...|$|R
60|$|He hesitated. <b>She</b> <b>clung</b> <b>to</b> his {{arm with}} unfeigned solicitude in her eager, {{pleading}} face, {{and he could}} not resist it.|$|E
60|$|She {{remained}} {{stiff and}} expectant, as rigid {{almost as though}} she {{was a part of the}} tree <b>she</b> <b>clung</b> <b>to,</b> peering down.|$|E
60|$|Lucy {{could not}} speak. <b>She</b> <b>clung</b> <b>to</b> her father, {{looking at him}} with anxious, sombre eyes; but he laughed and patted her hand.|$|E
60|$|They knelt {{side by side}} {{before the}} window-sill. The gardens were still faintly visible in the dim moonlight, but all signs of {{disturbance}} had passed away. <b>She</b> <b>clung</b> nervously <b>to</b> his arm.|$|R
60|$|At night, {{curled up}} on a small bundle of dank straw Yvonne had made vain efforts to snatch a little sleep. Ever since the day {{when she had been}} ruthlessly torn away from the {{protection}} of her dear milor, <b>she</b> had persistently <b>clung</b> <b>to</b> the belief that he would find the means to come to her, to wrest her from the cruel fate which her pitiless enemies had devised for her. <b>She</b> had <b>clung</b> <b>to</b> that hope throughout that dreary journey from dear England to this abominable city. <b>She</b> had <b>clung</b> <b>to</b> it even whilst her father knelt at her feet in an agony of remorse. <b>She</b> had <b>clung</b> <b>to</b> hope while Martin-Roget alternately coaxed and terrorised her, while her father was dragged away from her, while she endured untold misery, starvation, humiliation at the hands of Louise Adet: but now--quite unaccountably--that hope seemed suddenly to have fled from her, leaving her lonely and inexpressibly desolate. That small, shrunken figure which, wrapped in a dark mantle, had stood {{in the corner of the}} room watching her like a serpent watches its prey, had seemed like the forerunner of the fate with which Martin-Roget, gloating over her helplessness, had already threatened her.|$|R
60|$|He made a {{movement}} to disengage himself, but <b>she</b> <b>clung</b> more closely <b>to</b> him, shivering violently.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, it was fearful!" [...] gasped Nell, sitting up. <b>She</b> <b>clung</b> <b>to</b> {{her sister}} with one hand, {{while the other}} grasped Jim's sleeve.|$|E
60|$|Upon the words, {{she felt}} his {{encircling}} arms turn limp, and relax their grip upon her, whereupon <b>she</b> <b>clung</b> <b>to</b> him the more tightly.|$|E
60|$|Mme. de Plougastel screamed, {{and flung}} herself upon him. On her knees now, <b>she</b> <b>clung</b> <b>to</b> his arm {{with all her}} {{strength}} and might.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>clung</b> {{the closer}} <b>to</b> him, but neither lifted up her face, nor spoke a word.|$|R
6000|$|... 'It {{is my own}} fault,' she said, as on {{the last}} night <b>she</b> <b>clung</b> tearfully <b>to</b> Lady Merrifield; 'if I had behaved better I might have gone on just like one of your own.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There," [...] said Lucia, as <b>she</b> <b>clung</b> croodling <b>to</b> him; [...] "there is {{a pretty}} {{character}} of you, sir! Make the most of it, for it is all those Yankees will ever send you." ...|$|R
