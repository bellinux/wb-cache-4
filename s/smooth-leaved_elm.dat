50|$|Ulmus minor subsp. minor, the <b>smooth-leaved</b> <b>elm,</b> narrow-leaved elm or East Anglian elm, is a {{subspecies}} of {{the field}} elm native to southern Europe and Asia Minor including Iran.|$|E
50|$|Although the <b>smooth-leaved</b> <b>elm</b> is {{generally}} susceptible to Dutch elm disease, it is genetically a highly variable tree {{and it is}} possible some specimens survive in the UK owing to an innately high level of resistance (see Cultivation). Research currently (2009) in hand by Cemagref at Le Pepiniére forestiére de l'Etat, Guémené-Penfao, France, should confirm this. However, all <b>smooth-leaved</b> <b>elm</b> varieties are believed to have been introduced into Britain from central and southern Europe during the Bronze Age, and some, being beyond their natural climates and environments, may be growing slowly and thus producing smaller springwood vessels restrictive to the Ophiostoma fungus. Good performance in the field may also be owing to resistance to bark beetle feeding or breeding. Moreover, several types of this subspecies also have very pendulous twigs when mature, a factor which could also make them unattractive to foraging Scolytus beetles, which are disinclined to invert themselves.|$|E
50|$|The <b>smooth-leaved</b> <b>elm</b> is a {{deciduous}} {{tree that}} can grow to 35 m. Its Latin synonym carpinifolia {{alludes to the}} superficial similarity of the leaves to those of hornbeam Carpinus sp., while the common names contrast the smooth upper surface and narrowness of the leaves {{with those of the}} wych elm, which are rough and broad. The apetalous perfect wind-pollinated flowers, and fruit (samaras) are very {{similar to those of the}} species.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>smooth-leaved</b> <b>elm</b> (Ulmus minor subsp. minor) is not {{as common}} as other species. A fastigiate form was {{selected}} by the City of Melbourne for street planting, but was later {{found to have a}} problem with spitting at [...] "V" [...] crotches. The silver elm (U. minor 'Variegata') is the most commonly seen variety of this species, particularly in older botanic gardens and parks. Other introductions include the Cornish elm (Ulmus minor subsp. angustifolia), the Guernsey elm (Ulmus minor subsp. sarniensis) and Ulmus minor var. suberosa (Moench), Rehder (= Ulmus minor Mill.).|$|E
5000|$|Another {{point of}} {{interest}} and a major symbol {{of the city as}} featured on the coat of arms, is over thousand-year-old Stariyat Briast (Старият Бряст, [...] "The Old Elm"), a huge <b>Smooth-leaved</b> <b>Elm</b> {{in the center of the}} city. In times of the Ottoman rule Turkish officials used to hang Bulgarian revolutionaries on it. Today the city is helping the tree live on by frequent evaluations and reinforcing its base. It was elected Bulgarian tree of the year in 2013. On 19 March 2014 the results of online poll were revealed at a ceremony in the European Parliament. The Old Elm was voted European tree of the year 2014.|$|E
5000|$|The elm {{cultivar}} Ulmus ''''Scampstoniensis'''', the Scampston Elm or Scampston Weeping Elm, {{is said to}} {{have come}} from Scampston Hall, Yorkshire, England, before 1810. Loudon opined that a tree of the same name at the Royal Horticultural Society's Garden in 1834, 18 ft high at 8 years old [...] "differed little from the species" [...] (i.e. the <b>smooth-leaved</b> <b>elm,</b> his U. glabra [...] ). Henry described the tree, from a specimen growing in Victoria Park, Bath, as [...] "a weeping form of U. nitens" [...] however Green considered it [...] "probably a form of Ulmus × hollandica". Writing in 1831, Loudon said that the tree was supposed to have originated in America. U. minor is not, however, an American species, so if the tree was brought from America, it must originally have been taken there from Europe. There was (and is) an 'American Plantation' (or 'America Plantation') at Scampston, which may be related to this supposition. A number of old specimens of 'Scampstoniensis' in this plantation were blown down in a great gale of October 1881; younger specimens were still present at Scampston in 1911.|$|E
50|$|The {{tree was}} first {{classified}} by the Oxford botanist George Claridge Druce in 1907-11, who found examples at Banbury and Fineshade, Northamptonshire and published descriptions with photographs. Druce named the tree for Dr Robert Plot, a 17th-century English naturalist. The older vernacular name 'Lock Elm' {{is said to}} be an allusion to the difficulty in working its timber. However Druce wrote in 1913 that 'The wood is of very good quality, easy to work, and of a different texture from the Wych, Dutch, or English Elm, and has a general usefulness as a substitute for Ash or Wych Elm. The name Lock Elm can have no reference to any difficulty in working or dressing of the wood.' 'Lock' may be related to its use in boundaries, as 'loc' is Old English for enclosure. Lock elm may {{have been one of the}} plants used in witchcraft to open locks and reveal hidden treasure. Richens, who had encountered the vernacular name Lock's Elm, called the tree U. minor. var. lockii. A. R. Horwood in his book British Wild Flowers - In Their Natural Haunts, called it the 'Northamptonshire Elm'. Bancroft referred to Plot's Elm as the 'East Anglian Elm', adding that it was often referred to as Wych Elm in the region; however, she was almost certainly alluding to the <b>Smooth-leaved</b> <b>Elm.</b> 'Lock elm' has been in use since at least 1742.|$|E
