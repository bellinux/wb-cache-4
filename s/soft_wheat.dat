25|$|A light batter {{is made of}} {{cold water}} (sometimes {{sparkling}} water is used to keep the batter light) and <b>soft</b> <b>wheat</b> flour (cake, pastry or all-purpose flour). Eggs, baking soda or baking powder, starch, oil, and/or spices may also be added. Tempura batter is traditionally mixed in small batches using chopsticks {{for only a few}} seconds, leaving lumps in the mixture that, along with the cold batter temperature, result in the unique fluffy and crisp tempura structure when cooked. The batter is often kept cold by adding ice, or by placing the bowl inside a larger bowl with ice in it. Overmixing the batter will result in activation of wheat gluten, which causes the flour mixture to become soft and dough-like when fried.|$|E

A previous study in this laboratory found that hard red wheat {{is more effective}} than <b>soft</b> white <b>wheat</b> in reducing colon cancer risk, regardless of processing state, based on fewer aberrant crypt foci (ACF), a morphological marker of colon cancer risk. Here we examined the effect of wheat class (red vs. white) and processing (whole vs. refined) on reducing markers of colon cancer risk during the early and late promotion stage of colon cancer development. Rats adapted to a basal diet were treated twice with the colon-specific carcinogen, dimethylhydrazine (DMH). After the last dose of carcinogen, rats were divided into either the basal diet or the wheat flour-based diet groups. Both hard red and <b>soft</b> white <b>wheat</b> flour significantly reduced morphological markers such as ACF, and sialomucin producing ACF (SiM-ACF), an ACF with greater tumorigenic potential, compared to the basal diet.

40|$|Graduation date: 2015 Wheat (Triticum aestivum) is a {{globally}} traded {{staple food}} crop. The diverse and pleasing nature of wheat-derived products {{is a result}} of the complex interactions of the polymeric components from the wheat endosperm. Changes in the functionality of these polymeric components, as a result of changes in growing conditions or different genetics, impacts market price and end-product quality and directly affects farmers and processors. Wheat is of particular economic importance to the U. S. Pacific Northwest and, specifically, to the state of Oregon. Providing quality wheat for export is paramount to the survival of the Oregon wheat industry. This dissertation focuses on wheat quality from the perspective of serving the practical needs of farmers, processors, and wheat breeders. The first study, split into two portions, concerns pre-harvest sprouting (PHS) and grain storage. PHS increases alpha amylase (αA) activity in wheat, which, in excess, reduces wheat end-product quality. Falling Number (FN) is the primary test used by industry to gauge PHS damage in wheats. Direct measurement of αA activity is the fundamental frame of reference. The objective of these studies was to determine if FN and αA activity of wheat samples changed during storage and if changes were a function of storage time, storage temperature, and degree of PHS damage. Samples from three Idaho locations were used. These captured a wide range of PHS degree, and therefore, wide ranges of FN values and αA activities. Samples were subdivided and stored at - 20 °C, + 20 °C, and + 40 °C. Low FN values and high αA activities were observed in <b>soft</b> <b>wheats</b> from locations that had rain events prior to harvest. Overall, FN and αA activity had the curvilinear relationship expected from the literature, indicating the validity of the sample set with regard to the FN/αA relationship. Changes in FN and αA activity were observed over a 90 day period of grain storage. FN differed between growing environments, wheat varieties, and storage temperatures. αA activity also differed between growing environments and wheat varieties, but not between storage temperatures. Highest rates of increase in FN were observed in hard wheats with high initial (day 0) FN values. Lowest rates of increase in FN were observed in <b>soft</b> <b>wheats</b> with low day 0 FN values. This contrasted with the changes that occurred in αA activity. Decreases in αA activity over storage time were most prevalent in <b>soft</b> <b>wheats,</b> particularly sprouted <b>soft</b> <b>wheats</b> (i. e. those with day 0 αA activities > 0. 1 Ceralpha Units: CU). There were small decreases in αA activity in hard wheats but the distinction between high and low αA activity samples was not as evident as in the <b>soft</b> <b>wheats</b> because the vast majority of hard wheat samples tested had αA activities 300 s in very few cases. Storage was not effective in decreasing αA activity from > 0. 1 CU to < 0. 1 CU. Increases in FN over storage time for the hard wheats significantly differed between locations. However, decreases in αA activities over storage time for the hard wheats were not significantly different between locations. This again highlights a lack of correspondence between increased FN and decreased αA activity, suggesting that these two factors are somewhat decoupled when looking at changes in stored grain. Temperature-induced gluten crosslinking was explored as possible explanation for drastic increases in unsprouted hard wheat FN observed in samples from one location. Total polymeric protein (TPP) content was assessed at the end of the study for unsprouted hard wheats stored at + 40 °C and - 20 °C as well as sprouted hard wheats from stored at - 20 °C. TPP content was assessed as...|$|R
