5000|$|The Misznay-Schardin effect (alternative {{spelling}} Misnay-Schardin), or platter effect, is {{a characteristic}} of the detonation of a broad <b>sheet</b> of <b>explosive.</b> The explosive blast expands directly away from, perpendicular to, the surface of an explosive. Unlike the blast from a rounded explosive charge, which expands in all directions, the blast produced by an <b>explosive</b> <b>sheet</b> expands primarily perpendicular to its plane, in both directions. However, if one side is backed by a heavy or fixed mass, most of the blast (that is, most of the rapidly expanding gas and its kinetic energy) will be sent in the direction away from the mass.|$|R
50|$|One of Alford's early {{experiments}} {{involved a}} cucumber which was carved into a prism with a longitudinal V-shaped groove with {{a strip of}} <b>sheet</b> <b>explosive</b> behind. This generated a crude linear liquid jet capable of cutting steel. From this charge was developed a family of thin-walled plastic containers in which explosive was sandwiched between a grooved, water-filled, projectile and a rear water-filled component which acted as a tamper and flash suppressor. The series of production models derived from this cucumber include the MiniMod, the MLVD (Modular Large Vehicle Disruptor) and the BootBanger.|$|E
50|$|In an explosively-pumped {{magnetic}} flux compression generator, explosives {{are used to}} accelerate the plates of a large capacitor at each other, while the capacitor has a charge. The result is a colossal spike in amperage that can be used, in a typical application, to fire a railgun for kinetic effects or a transient electromagnetic munition for electronic warfare applications. For maximum amperage, the plates must remain parallel as they accelerate towards each other; high detonation velocity is required. In typical designs, however, the capacitor is not made from two flat plates, but from two concentric cylinders. Therefore, sheet explosives simplify construction. The reference cited for this section demonstrates a railgun design using Detasheet C as the <b>sheet</b> <b>explosive.</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We {{present a}} simple and {{inexpensive}} explosive line wave generator which has been designed using commercial <b>sheet</b> <b>explosive</b> and plane wave lens concepts. The line wave generator is constructed using PETN- and RDX-based <b>sheet</b> <b>explosive</b> for the slow and fast components, respectively, and permits the creation of any desired line width. A series of experiments were performed on a 100 -mm design, measuring the detonation arrival time at {{the output of the}} generator using a streak camera. An iterative technique was used to adjust the line wave generator’s slow and fast components, so as to minimize the arrival time deviation. Preliminary tests achieved a wavefront simultaneity of 100 ns with a 7. 0 mm/µs detonation wave. Designs, test results, and concepts for improvements are discussed...|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} {{with the use of a}} Beckman & Whitley Model 189 framing camera to observe the initiation of detonation in cylindrical explosive charges by the detonation of a concentric outside layer of <b>sheet</b> <b>explosive</b> initiated at one end. Experiments were con-ducted with nitromethane, which is a transparent liquid explosive, and aluminum-potassium perchlorate, which is a binary mixture of fuel and oxidizer powders. The use of the trans-parent explosive permitted viewing along the entire length of the charge axis, so that the time of the nitromethane initiation as a function of the position of the concentric <b>sheet</b> <b>explosive</b> detonation could be observed. In the case of the binary charge, the experiment involved the simultaneous viewing of both the side and the end of the charge by a judicious positioning of two front- surface mirrors. One of these was oriented at the end of the charge at an angle of 45 ° with respect to the charge axis. The second mirror, larger in size, viewed the entire system, and was destructed at 656 psec by an explosive bac 1 Jng charge to preclude the possibility of film rewrite. Framing rates for both experiments were approximately 250, 000 frames /sec. The induction time to initiation of detonation in the nitromethane was measured to be about 20 psec. However, the induction time for the aluminum-potassium perchlorate charge was too long to be recorded by the Beckman and Whitley camera. For this and other pyro-technic charges, it was necessary to use a slower writing Fastax camera recording at a rate of 2000 frames /sec; the induction times for the pyrotechnic systems were in the neighborhood of 1 to 3 msec, which is two orders of magnitude longer than for the nitromethane...|$|E

I, I HE problem treated here is the response of a Timo-shenko beam subjected to a constant force traveling at a constant velocity. It is the velocity distribution behind a force moving supersonically with respect to the two wave velocities of the beam that, is of particular interest although intersonic and subsonic cases are also considered. A uniformly distributed impulsive loading on a structure such as a beam is often provided by <b>sheet</b> <b>explosive.</b> However, the ex-plosive imparts an impulse by means of a sharp pidse at the deto-nation front moving at the detonation velocity.

50|$|The Gurney {{equations}} give {{a result}} that assumes the flyer plate remains intact throughout its acceleration. For some configurations, this is true; explosive welding, for example, uses a thin <b>sheet</b> of <b>explosive</b> to evenly accelerate flat plates of metal and collide them, and the plates remain solid throughout. However, for many configurations where materials are accelerated outwards, the expanding shell fractures due to stretching. When it fractures, it usually breaks into many small fragments due to the combined effects of ongoing expansion of the shell and stress relief waves moving into the material from fracture points.|$|R
5000|$|The {{development}} of the M18A1 mine dates back to work done during World War II. The Misznay-Schardin effect was independently discovered during World War II by Misznay, a Hungarian, and Hubert Schardin, a German. When a <b>sheet</b> of <b>explosive</b> detonates in contact with a heavy backing surface (for example, a metal plate), the resulting blast is primarily directed away from the surface in a single direction. Schardin spent some time developing the discovery as a side-attack anti-tank weapon, but development was incomplete {{at the end of}} the war. Schardin also spent time researching a [...] "trench mine" [...] that used a directional fragmentation effect.|$|R

The explosively formed dissimilar materials had substantially improved evenness of heat transfer thanks to the copper center layer.|$|R
40|$|The <b>sheet</b> <b>explosive</b> loading {{technique}} (SELT) {{was employed}} to obtain elastic-plastic, large-deflection transient and/or permanent strain data on simple well-defined structural specimens and materials: initially-flat 6061 -T 651 aluminum beams with both ends ideally clamped via integral construction. The SELT loading technique was chosen since it is both convenient and provides forcing function information of small uncertainty. These data will be useful for evaluating pertinent structural response prediction methods. A second objective was to obtain high-quality transient-strain data for a well-defined structural/material model subjected to impact by a rigid body of known mass, impact velocity, and geometry; large-deflection, elastic-plastic transient response conditions are of primary interest. The beam with both ends clamped and a steel sphere as the impacting body were chosen. The steel sphere was launched vertically by explosive propulsion to achieve various desired impact velocities. The sphere/beam impact tests resulted in producing {{a wide range of}} structural responses and permanent deformations, including rupture of the beam from excessive structural response in two cases. The transient and permanent strain data as well as the permanent deflection data obtained are of high quality and should be useful for checking and evaluating methods for predicting the responses of simple 2 -d structures to fragment (sphere) impact. Transient strain data very close to the point of impact were not obtained over as long a time as desirable because the gage(s) in that region became detached during the transient response...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical references. The dynamic {{response}} of structures subjected to blast and impact loading has been obtained relatively simply using rigid-plastic or rigid-viscoplastic material idealisations. It is essential, however, that {{the predictions of}} these idealised theories should be checked against experimental results, {{and over the past}} twenty years several experimental studies have been carried out. This thesis describes a series of experiments on fully clamped Circular, square and rectangular steel plates. The final midpoint deflections measured were between 3 and 12 plate thicknesses: and the deflection time history was measured using a light interference technique. While the deflection-time history was being recorded. the impulse was simultaneously being measured by means of a ballistic pendulum upon which the plates were attached. The impulse was provided by <b>sheet</b> <b>explosive</b> which was arranged {{in such a way that}} the plate was subjected to a uniformly distributed impulse. In addition an extension of a mode approximation method, based on the assumption that membrane stresses predominate, is presented. This method assumes that the material behaviour can be modelled as rigid-viscoplastic. and that at any instant the shapes of the displacement and the velocity field are the same. Points on the plate surface were first assumed to displace perpendicular to the initial surface: this assumption was then relaxed to permit points to move perpendicular to the current surface. In both cases. the predicted transverse displacements agreed well with the experimental data. The predicted radial strain distribution exhibited trends similar to the experimental data in the case where lateral displacements were modelled...|$|E
40|$|Current {{sheets in}} {{planetary}} magnetospheres that lie between regions of "oppositely-directed" magnetic field are either magnetopause-like, separating plasmas with different properties, or tail-like, separating plasmas of rather similar properties. The magnetopause current sheets generally have a nearly limitless supply of magnetized plasma that can reconnect, possibly setting up steady-state reconnection. In contrast, the plasma {{on either side}} of a tail current sheet is stratified so that, as reconnection occurs, the plasma properties, in particular the Alfven velocity, change. If the density drops and the magnetic field increases markedly perpendicular to the <b>sheet,</b> <b>explosive</b> reconnection can occur. Even though steady state reconnection can take place at magnetopause current sheets, the process often appears to be periodic as if a certain low average rate was demanded by the conditions but only a rapid rate was available. Reconnection of sheared fields has been postulated to create magnetic ropes in the solar corona, at the Earth's magnetopause, and in the magnetotail. However, this {{is not the only way}} to produce magnetic ropes as the Venus ionosphere shows. The geometry of the reconnecting regions and the plasma conditions both can affect the rate of reconnection. Sorting out the various controlling factors can be assisted through the examination of reconnection in planetary settings. In particular we observe similar small-scale tearing in the magnetopause current layers of the Earth, Saturn. Uranus and Neptune and the magnetodisk current sheet at Jupiter. These sites may be seeds for rapid reconnection if the reconnection site reaches a high Alfven velocity region. In the Jupiter magnetosphere this appears to be achieved with resultant substorm activity. Similar seeds may be present in the Earth's magnetotail with the first one to reach explosive growth dominating the dynamics of the tail...|$|E
5000|$|In {{explosive}} welding, {{the pressure}} to bond the two layers is provided by detonation of a <b>sheet</b> of chemical <b>explosive.</b> No heat-affected zone is produced in the bond between metals. The explosion propagates across the sheet, which tends to expel impurities and oxides from between the sheets. Pieces up to 4 x 16 metres can be manufactured.

40|$|A {{speculative}} {{model for}} the nonlinear phase of the collisionless tearing instability is developed for {{the case of a}} single long wavelength tearing mode. Using an energy principle formalism, we find that the nonlinear growth rate is linearly proportional to the mode amplitude. Hence in the nonlinear phase, the tearing mode grows explosively in time, and saturates when the width of the magnetic islands become comparable to the thickness of the current sheet. For typical plasma <b>sheet</b> parameters, the <b>explosive</b> phase lasts 5 - 10 minutes, and develops cross-tail emf's of several 100 KV...|$|R

Physical taggants can take many different forms but are typically microscopic in size, included at low levels, and simple to detect. They can be utilized to differentiate authentic product from counterfeits, provide identifying information for traceability purposes (e.g. lot number, company name), determine mixing homogeneity and cross-contamination, and to detect dilution of proprietary products.

40|$|Reconnection {{physics at}} micro-scales is {{investigated}} in an electron magnetohydrodynamics frame. A new process of {{collapse of the}} neutral current sheet is demonstrated by means of analytical and numerical solutions. It shows how at scales smaller than ion inertia length a compression of the <b>sheet</b> triggers an <b>explosive</b> evolution of current perturbation. Collapse results {{in the formation of}} a intense sub-sheet and then an X-point structure embedded into the equilibrium sheet. Hall currents associated with this structure support high reconnection rates. Nonlinear static solution at scales of the electron skin reveals that electron inertia and small viscosity provide an efficient mechanism of field lines breaking. The reconnection rate does not depend on the actual value of viscosity, while the maximum current is found to be restricted even for space plasmas with extremely rare collisions. The results obtained are verified by a two-fluid large-scale numerical simulation...|$|R
40|$|In {{the current}} 'conceptual' model of magnetospheric substorms, the growth phase terminates and the {{expansion}} phase commences {{with the onset of}} rapid reconnection at a new, near-earth X-type neutral line. Physical concepts developed in the analysis of the collisionless tearing mode and the flow of collisionless plasma in weakly magnetized, thin current sheets are combined to construct a model of purely collisionless, time-dependent, ion-dominated reconnection. Formulated in the context of time-dependent magnetospheric convection, the model describes the reconnection collapse of the initially thick plasma sheet. In the nonlinear phase the reconnection rate grows explosively in time and saturates into a steady collisionless reconnection flow when the initial magnetic flux in the current sheet has reconnected; at saturation the reconnection rate is comparable to the maximum Petschek rate. The time scale and dynamics of the explosive reconnection model are broadly consistent with observations of substorm growth phase and expansion phase onset. For typical plasma <b>sheet</b> parameters the <b>explosive</b> reconnection electromotive force across the tail approaches 1 MV at saturation...|$|R
40|$|Significant {{reductions}} in the fluid structure interaction regulated transfer of impulse occur when sand-wich panels with thin (light) front faces are impulsively loaded in water. A combined experimental and computational simulation approach {{has been used to}} investigate this phenomenon during the compression of honeycomb core sandwich panels. Square cell honeycomb panels with a core relative density of 5 % have been fabricated from 304 stainless steel. Back supported panels have been dynamically loaded in through thickness compression using an <b>explosive</b> <b>sheet</b> to create a plane wave impulse in water. As the impulse was increased, the ratio of transmitted to incident momentum decreased from the Taylor limit of 2, for impulses that only elastically deformed the core, to a value of 1. 5, when the peak incident pressure caused inelastic core crushing. This reduction in transmitted impulse was slightly less than that previously observed in similar experiments with a lower strength pyramidal lattice core and, in both cases, was well above the ratio of 0. 35 predicted for an unsupported front face. Core collapse was found to occur by plastic buckling under both quasistatic and dynamic conditions. The buckling occurred first at the stationary side of the core, and, in the dynamic case, was initiated by reflection of a plastic wave at the (rigid) back face sheet-web interface. The transmitted stress through the back face sheet during impulse loading depended upon the velocity of the front face, which was determined by the face shee...|$|R
40|$|NOVELTY - A layer (12) with a {{structuring}} surface (14) intervenes {{between an}} <b>explosive</b> <b>sheet</b> (16) {{and the surface}} of the workpiece (11). On detonation, the structure is impressed. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is included for a workpiece made as described, for plastic processing. Preferred features: In a related method it is the explosive layer which is structured and laid directly onto the workpiece. The explosive itself, generates and impresses the texturing. The texturing layer is as thin as possible. The explosive has a high detonation velocity. Between workpiece surface and structured material {{there is at least one}} intermediate layer. The surface of the explosive is first structured, before laying it on the workpiece and setting it off. The explosive is coated as a paste, fluid or melt onto a structure. It is hardened and removed, to be laid on the workpiece. The structure is blasted into the workpiece surface as a negative or positive form. USE - To impress a textur e into a surface, especially to make a die for: injection-molding, blow-molding, pressing, foaming, die-casting or electro-erosion. ADVANTAGE - Results are achieved rather quickly. Unlike e. g. photochemical etching processes, large quantities of polluting chemicals are avoided. There are no electroplating or etching stages. In addition to impression, compression takes place, giving the tool a longer life. The operation is independent of the homogeneity of the structure and the hardness of the workpiece material. The method is particularly applicable for materials which are difficult to etch. A leather-like texture can be produced. Almost any type of texture can be produced, e. g. regular, free form, random and non-mathematical. Edges are rounded by suitable choice of materials and quantity of explosive, avoiding any further need for finishing...|$|R
