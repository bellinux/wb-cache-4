25|$|Coal is a {{combustible}} {{black or}} brownish-black sedimentary rock usually occurring in rock strata in layers or veins called coal beds or coal seams. The harder forms, such as anthracite coal, {{can be regarded}} as metamorphic rock because of later exposure to elevated temperature and pressure. Coal is composed primarily of carbon, along with variable quantities of other elements, chiefly hydrogen, sulfur, oxygen, and nitrogen. Coal is a fossil fuel that forms when dead plant matter is converted into peat, which in turn is converted into lignite, then <b>sub-bituminous</b> <b>coal,</b> after that bituminous coal, and lastly anthracite. This involves biological and geological processes that take place over time.|$|E
25|$|The {{economy is}} based on agriculture, industry, {{services}} and tourism. There are small deposits of <b>sub-bituminous</b> <b>coal</b> as well as significant quantities of high-quality marble that is processed in Sandanski {{and part of the}} production is exported. A number of small hydro power plants have been constructed, mainly along Sandanska Bistritsa River. The rivers are also used for irrigation. Forests cover , or 5.5% of Bulgaria's total, and are of commercial importance because of the high-quality timber. As logging is restricted in the protected areas the wood-processing industry in Pirin forms 3.5% of the nation's total production in that sector. The lower parts of the mountain offer favourable conditions for agriculture, the most important cash crops being grapes, peanuts, tobacco and anise. The region around Melnik is renown for its centuries-old traditions in producing distinct red wines. Manufacturing industry is centres in Sandanski, Gotse Delchev, Bansko and Simitli; the main sectors are food processing, machine building and furniture production.|$|E
50|$|<b>Sub-bituminous</b> <b>coals</b> may be dull, {{dark brown}} to black, soft and crumbly {{at the lower}} end of the range, to bright jet-black, hard, and {{relatively}} strong at the upper end.

The heat content of <b>sub-bituminous</b> <b>coals</b> range from 8300 to 11,500 BTu/lb or 19,306 to 26,749 MJ/kg.

2500|$|The {{fossil fuels}} include coal, {{petroleum}} and natural gas. Bulgaria possesses significant reserves of coal estimated at 4,8 billion tons. More than 92% of them, or 4,5 billion tons, is lignite, {{which is the}} lowest rank of coal due to its relatively low heat content but is widely used for electricity generation. With reserves of 2,856 billion tons Maritsa Iztok, situated in the Upper Thracian Plain, {{is by far the}} largest coal basin in the country which powers Maritsa Iztok Complex, the largest energy complex in South-Eastern Europe. Other lignite basins include Sofia valley (reserves of 870 million tons), Elhovo (656 million tons), Lom (277 million tons), Maritsa Zapad (170 million tons). The reserves of <b>sub-bituminous</b> <b>coal</b> are 300 million tons, situated mainly near Bobov Dol, Pernik and Burgas. The recoverable reserves of bituminous coal and anthracite are insignificant— only 10 and 2,5 million tons respectively. However, there is a huge basin of bituminous coal in Southern Dobruja with estimated reserves of over 1 billion tons but its large depth (1370–1950m) is an obstacle for its commercial exploitation.|$|E

2500|$|In 1975, {{concerned}} that Montana was a [...] "stereotypical colonial state" [...] with little economic development whose natural resources would be extracted {{and the state}} left with severe environmental degradation, the Montana State Legislature enacted a severance tax on each ton of coal mined in the state. Then-Governor Tom Judge called the statute [...] "the most significant piece of legislation enacted in Montana in this century." [...] It was attacked in a RAND Corporation study (partly financed by the National Academies of Science) as excessive. An amendment was proposed and adopted in 1976 requiring that at least one-fourth of the coal severance tax be deposited into a Permanent Coal Tax Trust Fund and that, after 1979, {{at least half the}} tax revenues be deposited into the fund. The fund could not be tapped unless three-fourths of each chamber of the state legislature voted to do so.

40|$|Coal is an {{important}} fossil fuel and {{is used as a}} major source of energy in power plants and blast furnaces. But, Indian coals contain a large amount of impurities, particularly ash forming mineral matter, which interfere with proper combustion of coal and decreases its calorific value. Industrial uses demand coal with minimum ash content {{so that it can be}} efficiently used in metallurgical, or, power plants. This paper reviews the removal of ash-forming minerals of coal using chemical techniques and also the extraction of coal by the use of various solvents. Solvents, like N-Methyl- 2 -pyrrolidone (NMP), 1 -methyl naphthalene, Dimethylformamide (DMF), Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) can be used to reduce the ash content of coal. However, polar solvents have been proved to extract greater amounts of coal and reduce ash to a greater extent than non-polar solvents, particularly for lower rank, or, <b>sub-bituminous</b> <b>coals.</b> However, if non-polar solvents are used, then traces of polar additives can also increase the extraction of coal as well as cause greater reduction of the ash content.

Among the studied ILs, 1 -butyl- 3 -methylimidazolium chloride [Bmim][Cl] was found to perform the most consistently {{in being able to}} alter the thermal and morphological properties of most of the coals used.

It was also found that the interactions of the ionic liquids are coal specific, for instance none of the ionic liquids were able to change the thermal properties of coal A.
