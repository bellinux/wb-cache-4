2500|$|During World War I, the paper's {{consistent}} antimilitarist stand {{brought it}} {{into conflict with}} the administration of President Woodrow Wilson and his Postmaster General Albert Burleson.

In August 1918 the publication was deprived {{of the right to}} receive first class mail, with all letters from subscribers and readers sent to the publication <b>summarily</b> <b>returned</b> to sender with the envelope stamped [...] "Mail to This Address Undeliverable Under Espionage Act."

50|$|Gaeta {{determines that}} the Cylon virus is still active, is {{responsible}} {{for a series of}} malfunctions aboard Galactica, and threatens to take full control of the ship. Adama enlists Sharon's help. She confirms Gaeta's diagnosis and warns that a Cylon attack is imminent. Hundreds of Cylon Raiders and Heavy Raiders appear and hold formation, preparing to activate the virus. Forced to trust Sharon, Adama allows her to interface directly with Galacticas systems by inserting a fiber optic cable into her hand. Sharon helps delete the virus and broadcasts a virus of her own to the Cylon ships, rendering them helpless and easy pickings for the Vipers.

5000|$|Two {{years after}} the Act of 1576 was passed into law, yet more {{dramatic}} changes {{were made to the}} methods to fight vagabondage and to provide relief to the poor. The Act of 1578 transferred power from the Justices of the Peace to church officials in the area of collecting the new taxes for the relief of poverty established in the Act of 1572. In addition, this Act of 1578 also extended the power of the church by stating that [...] "â€¦vagrants were to be <b>summarily</b> whipped and <b>returned</b> to their place of settlement by parish constables." [...] By eliminating the need for the involvement of the Justices, law enforcement was streamlined.|$|R
