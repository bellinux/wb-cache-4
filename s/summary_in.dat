5|$|Albrecht the Elder's {{panel is}} {{regarded}} as the superior of the two works. This may in part be attributed to differing contemporary treatments of male and female portraits; men were allowed more individuality, while female portraits were bound by stereotypes and were not as daring, for example showing evidence of ageing. In either case, the father painting is far more closely detailed, especially in the lining of clothing, which is <b>summary</b> <b>in</b> Barbara's panel, compared to the long seam of her husband's gown. This contrast in detail can also be seen in the treatment of the rosaries, which are given prominence and a glowing red colour in his panel, but are small and relegated in hers.|$|E
5|$|Ideas {{from the}} Deep convened {{to come up}} with the design for the game, and Hall {{suggested}} a console-style platformer in the vein of Super Mario Bros., as they had the technology made for it; he further recommended a science fiction theme. John Carmack added the idea of a genius child protagonist saving the world, and Hall quickly created a short summary for the game: a dramatic introduction about eight-year-old genius Billy Blaze, defending the Earth with his spaceship. When he read out the <b>summary</b> <b>in</b> an over-dramatic voice to the group, they laughed and applauded, and the group agreed to begin work on Commander Keen in the Invasion of the Vorticons.|$|E

25|$|In {{the seniors}} singles {{competition}} Scot Andy Murray {{made the most}} significant impact, becoming the first Brit since Tim Henman in 2004 to reach the quarterfinals. Murray, often castigated in the British media for his surly manner, won the crowd's affections with his five-set victory over Richard Gasquet (for further details on this match, see the Day 7 <b>summary).</b> <b>In</b> the UK, the Murray-Gasquet match was watched by over 10m people, and in his native Scotland more than 50% of the potential viewing public watched the match. Chris Eaton from Surrey, the ATP No. 661, began his campaign in qualifying, succeeded in doing so, and then beat ATP No. 114 Boris Pašanski, causing a huge surprise. No British women made it beyond the second round, although Anne Keothavong was the first British woman to directly qualify to the main draw since 1998.|$|E
25|$|Johnson's {{records were}} admired by record {{collectors}} {{from the time}} of their first release, and efforts were made to discover his biography, with virtually no success. The blues researcher Mack McCormick began researching his family background but was never ready to publish his findings. McCormick's research eventually became as much a legend as Johnson himself. In 1982, McCormick permitted Peter Guralnick to publish a <b>summary</b> <b>in</b> Living Blues (1982), later reprinted in book form as Searching for Robert Johnson. Later research has sought to confirm this account or to add minor details. A revised summary acknowledging major informants was written by Stephen LaVere for the booklet accompanying the compilation album Robert Johnson, The Complete Recordings (1990), and is maintained with updates at the Delta Haze website. The documentary film The Search for Robert Johnson contains accounts by McCormick and Wardlow of what informants have told them: long interviews of David Honeyboy Edwards and Johnny Shines and short interviews of surviving friends and family. These published biographical sketches achieve coherent narratives, partly by ignoring reminiscences and hearsay accounts which contradict or conflict with other accounts.|$|E

500|$|The first {{mention of}} Guilllaume de Dole after the Middle Ages {{is found in}} the work of Claude Fauchet, who is {{generally}} considered to have studied the Vatican Regina manuscript (instead of another, now lost, manuscript). In 1844, Adelbert Keller published extracts of the poem including some of the chansons; the chansons acquired some fame, and in 1850 Darenberg and Renan traveled to Rome to study the manuscript, publishing a larger number of the chansons in 1855. It wasn't until 1870 that all of the chansons had been published. A lengthy analysis, partial edition, and <b>summary</b> <b>in</b> English was published by Henry Alfred Todd of Johns Hopkins University, in 1886. The poem was finally published in its entirety in 1893 by Gustave Servois for the Société des anciens textes français.|$|E

500|$|In {{neighboring}} Haiti, {{high winds}} downed {{power lines and}} radio towers, which cut outside communication. High rainfall led to flash flooding between mountain ranges, in a location nicknamed the [...] "valley of death"; there, the Weather Bureau remarked that [...] "local winds... may well have exceeded [...] ". Thousands of homes were either destroyed or lost their roof. The Haitian government reported over 1,000deaths {{in the weeks after}} the storm. The United States government reported that the hurricane [...] "killed no more than 50" [...] in Haiti, and [...] "nor was there a real emergency," [...] due to president François Duvalier misusing previous aid. The U.S. assessment was incorrect, as the 1966 annual tropical cyclone <b>summary</b> <b>in</b> the Monthly Weather Review indicated 750deaths in Haiti, mostly in Jacmel. President Duvalier considered the hurricane the [...] "worst storm... since the 1920s." [...] In the country, 1,000people were injured and 60,000 were left homeless, and damage was estimated at $20.35million.

500|$|In 1931, Lowerhouse {{finished}} in equal fourth place, its best {{position in the}} league since 1908. Reviewing the season, the Burnley News gave credit to St Hill for the revival. Describing him as a dependable batsman, it stated {{that he had a}} big impact with the ball. He scored 288 runs at 14.40, with a top score of 46, [...] to finish third in the club batting averages. He topped the bowling averages with 68 wickets, 46 of which were bowled, at 12.20. By the following season, St Hill's wife had joined him in Lowerhouse. An end of season <b>summary</b> <b>in</b> the Burnley Express suggested that his batting had improved, and that he had surprised people with his ability. He played several longer innings, with a highest score of 85, and he scored runs by [...] "delightfully played cricket". He headed the batting and bowling averages for the club with 477 runs at 20.73 and 77 wickets at 13.87. However, the report stated that his bowling had been inconsistent and that it was surprising that he ended with such a good average. Nevertheless, his figures stood comparison with other leading professionals in the Lancashire League. The club dropped to equal fifth in the league.|$|E
500|$|Somerset's {{difficulties}} {{were not}} confined to the pitch. In 1912, the club made a loss of £327, and they could not persuade Daniell to remain at the club rather than travel to India. Initially the county asked Arthur Newton, who was at that time 50 years old, to serve as captain, but after consideration he declined the role, and Poyntz was appointed instead. The team that he inherited remained a poor one: the Wisden <b>summary</b> <b>in</b> 1913 stated that they had, [...] "no temptation to deal at any great length with the doings of Somerset". During a season in which his side had finished bottom of the championship with only two wins, Poyntz scored 363 runs at an average of 15.12, with a single half-century; 50 runs exactly scored against Derbyshire. The club once again recorded a loss during the season, and at the club's annual general meeting, the mood was negative. Despite this, Poyntz was reappointed as captain for 1914 after a proposal made by Bruce Hylton-Stewart and seconded by Newton. Rare optimism was shown by Newton and Poyntz, with the latter claiming that it was due to [...] "a lot of bad luck that they [...] did not finish half way up the table instead of at the bottom." ...|$|E

The two squadrons rendezvoused at Stampalia on 17 April. At 06:30, Pisa and Amalfi steamed into the Dardanelles in advance of the Italian fleet in an attempt to draw out the Turkish fleet. Four Turkish shore batteries, outfitted with 18 Krupp guns ranging from [...] in size fired on the Italian fleet. The Italians, firing at a range of , returned fire in an exchange that lasted more than two hours. Official Italian reports claimed that no ships were hit and specifically rebutted Turkish claims that Varese had been set on fire, but a <b>summary</b> <b>in</b> The New York Times reports that Varese was hit twice. On 19 April, the Italian fleet departed for home, but left Amalfi, Pisa, and an assortment of smaller craft to continue destroying telegraph stations and cutting cables.|$|E
500|$|Around AD 150, the Greek {{astronomer}} of the Roman period Claudius Ptolemy described Sirius as reddish, {{along with}} five other stars, Betelgeuse, Antares, Aldebaran, Arcturus and Pollux, {{all of which}} are of orange or red hue. The discrepancy was first noted by amateur astronomer Thomas Barker, squire of Lyndon Hall in Rutland, who prepared a paper and spoke {{at a meeting of the}} Royal Society in London in 1760. The existence of other stars changing in brightness gave credence to the idea that some may change in colour too; Sir John Herschel noted this in 1839, possibly influenced by witnessing Eta Carinae two years earlier. Thomas Jefferson Jackson See resurrected discussion on red Sirius with the publication of several papers in 1892, and a final <b>summary</b> <b>in</b> 1926. He cited not only Ptolemy but also the poet Aratus, the orator Cicero, and general Germanicus as calling the star red, though acknowledging that none of the latter three authors were astronomers, the last two merely translating Aratus' poem Phaenomena. Seneca had described Sirius as being of a deeper red than Mars. Not all ancient observers saw Sirius as red. The 1st-century poet Marcus Manilius described it as [...] "sea-blue", as did the 4th century Avienus. It was the standard white star in ancient China, and multiple records from the 2nd century BC up to the 7th century AD all describe Sirius as white.|$|E
500|$|Commander Keen in Invasion of the Vorticons was an {{immediate}} hit for Apogee: the company's previous sales levels had been around US$7,000 per month, but by Christmas Keen already had sales of almost US$30,000. Miller described the game as [...] "a little atom bomb" [...] to magazine editors and BBS controllers when asked about it, and recruited his mother and hired his first employee to handle sales and phone calls from interested players. By June 1991, the game was bringing in over US$60,000 per month. Chris Parker of PC Magazine later in 1991 referred to the game's release as a [...] "tremendous success". A contemporary review by Barry Simon of PC Magazine praised the game's graphical capabilities as having a [...] "Nintendo feel", though he termed the graphics as [...] "well drawn" [...] but [...] "not spectacular" [...] in terms of resolution.
