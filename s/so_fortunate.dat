5|$|The German {{national}} team was not <b>so</b> <b>fortunate,</b> losing {{the final of}} the European Championship to the Netherlands before a home town crowd in Frankfurt. It claimed silver at the 2014 Women's World Wheelchair Basketball Championship in Toronto, Canada, and beat the Netherlands in the 2015 European Championships, to claim its tenth European title. At the 2016 Paralympic Games, it won silver after losing the final to the United States.|$|E
5|$|Glinicki was {{philosophical}} {{about the}} win, noting in December 2012 {{that there were}} many awards and ceremonies, but that the memory of London was fading over time. He returned to coaching his club team, Hamburger SV (now renamed BG Baskets Hamburg), which included national team members Mareike Adermann and Edina Müller (and Australia's Bridie Kean). It {{went on to win the}} national championship for the eighth time in 2013. The national team was not <b>so</b> <b>fortunate,</b> losing the European Championship to the Netherlands by a point, 56–57, before a home town crowd in Frankfurt in July 2013.|$|E

25|$|Unfortunately the English {{readers and}} many of those other {{countries}} who had translated Benzoni's earlier works, were not <b>so</b> <b>fortunate</b> to read Benzoni's other historical novels or Mystery novels (The Aldo Morosini adventures).

25|$|The {{next season}} for the club in Serie A would not be <b>so</b> <b>fortunate,</b> they were relegated in 17th place.

25|$|Another noted Loyalist later {{associated}} with the Cherokee, Thomas Brown, was not nearly <b>so</b> <b>fortunate.</b> In his home of Brownsborough, Georgia, near Augusta, he was assaulted by a crowd of the Sons of Liberty, tied to a tree, roasted with fire, scalped, tarred, and feathered. After his escape, he took up residence among the Seminole commanding his East Florida Rangers, who fought with them {{and some of the}} Lower Muskogee.|$|E
25|$|True to history, the {{downtown}} area was home to several well-known brothels; the first was known to have opened in 1868, providing employment for some women in the untamed frontier town. One stylish madam, Mary Robinson reported property worth $77,000 in 1870. Others were not <b>so</b> <b>fortunate.</b> Kate Hutton {{was shot and killed}} by a lover, and presumably other ladies of the night were victims of violence; Henrietta Charles died of syphilis at age 38. In 1872 Horace Cleveland visited the city and proposed a citywide park system; shortly thereafter Lake Como was purchased, eventually to be the anchor of Como Park, Zoo, and Conservatory. Later, in 1899, Lake Phalen was also purchased by the city.|$|E

Obviously, 'Taken' {{is not the}} kind of action film to spend much time worrying about its pedestrian script or largely indifferent acting, <b>so</b> it's <b>fortunate</b> to have Neeson in the starring role." [...] Bryan Mills is characterized as [...] "relentless attack machine who is impervious to fists, bullets and fast-moving cars, he uses a variety of martial arts skills to knock out more opponents than Mike Tyson and casually kill those he doesn't KO".|$|R

25|$|After the {{abolition}} of the monarchy in 1792, Tourzel was separated from the royal family and imprisoned in La Force Prison and the Prison Port-Libre. Also imprisoned at the same time were Tourzel's daughter, Pauline de Tourzel, and Marie Antoinette's most loyal friend, the Princesse de Lamballe. Shortly after their imprisonment, the three women found themselves victims of the September Massacres, when thousands of incarcerated people in Paris were massacred by violent revolutionaries who were trying to rid the prisons of jailed aristocrats. Tourzel and her daughter were smuggled out of the prison by a mysterious gentleman, but Lamballe was not <b>so</b> <b>fortunate.</b> She was savagely murdered, and her severed head was then paraded around the city.|$|E
25|$|Many of the Confederates {{along the}} wall, {{including}} {{much of the}} 19th, were not <b>so</b> <b>fortunate.</b> General Armistead was struck down in the Federal lines near Cushing's guns; General Kemper was wounded, captured, but then taken back by his soldiers and carried to the rear; General Garnett was shot from his horse (reports vary as to his cause of death; most reports say a canister round blew him from his horse and tore his body to ribbons, but a report by {{a man in the}} 19th said that he was killed by a minie ball and fell dead from his horse. Either way, Garnett was killed {{at the front of the}} charge).|$|E
25|$|A {{daughter}} (July 1717). The Duchess {{had retired}} at the Château de la Muette {{to hide the}} term of her pregnancy. The putative father Sicaire Antonin Armand Auguste Nicolas d'Aydie, Chevalier de Rion, became Berry's lover sometime in 1716 or 1717. In his additions to the diary of Dangeau on 21 July 1719, Saint-Simon mentions that the Duchess had managed to hide a first pregnancy by Rion, bringing forth a girl. She was not <b>so</b> <b>fortunate</b> the second time when she almost died in labour at the Luxembourg and provoked a public scandal, as underscored by Saint-Simon who then writes a short description of Berry's 1719 childbirth which has become the most-well known episode of her scandalous biography. According to Duclos, this child subsequently became a nun at the Abbey of Pontoise.|$|E

25|$|Strassburg {{managed to}} {{disengage}} and escape when the battlecruisers approached but Cöln was not <b>so</b> <b>fortunate.</b> Cut off from escape she was quickly disabled by {{the much larger}} guns of the battlecruisers. She was saved from immediate sinking by the sighting of another German light cruiser, Ariadne, to which Beatty gave chase and again quickly overcame. Ariadne was left to sink, which she eventually did at 15:00, attended by the German ships Danzig and Stralsund who took off survivors. At 13:10, Beatty turned north-west and ordered all the British ships to withdraw, since the tide had now risen sufficiently for larger German ships to pass out through the Jade estuary. Passing Cöln again, he opened fire, sinking her. Attempts to rescue the crew were interrupted {{by the arrival of}} a submarine; one survivor was rescued by a German ship two days later out of some 250 who had survived the sinking. Rear Admiral Maass perished with his ship.|$|E
25|$|Occasionally an aristocrat of {{the first}} rank did find himself in dire {{financial}} troubles. The severely impoverished Duke of Marlborough saved Blenheim Palace by marrying an heiress, tempted from the USA by the lure of an old title in return for vast riches. Not all were <b>so</b> <b>fortunate</b> or seemingly eligible. When 2nd Duke of Buckingham found himself bankrupt in 1848, he sold the contents of Stowe House, one of Britain's grandest houses. It {{proved to be a}} temporary solution; his heirs, the 3rd and final Duke of Buckingham and his heirs, the Earls Temple, inherited huge financial problems until finally in 1922 anything left that was moveable, both internal and external, was auctioned off and the house sold, narrowly escaping demolition. It was saved by being transformed into a school. Less fortunate was Clumber Park, the principal home of the Dukes of Newcastle. Selling the Hope diamond and other properties failed to solve the family problems, leaving no alternative but demolition of the huge, expensive-to-maintain house, which was razed to the ground in 1938, leaving the Duke without a ducal seat. Plans to rebuild a smaller house on the site were never executed. Other high-ranking members of the peerage were also forced to off-load minor estates and seats; the Duke of Northumberland retained Alnwick Castle, but sold Stanwick Park to be demolished, leaving him with four other country seats remaining. Likewise the Duke of Bedford kept Woburn Abbey, considerably reduced in size, after World War II, while selling other family estates and houses. Whatever the personal choices and reasons for the sales and demolitions, the underlying and unifying factor was almost always financial. The root of the problem began long before the 20th century with the gradual introduction and increase of taxes on income and further tax on inherited wealth, death duties.|$|E
500|$|Calcraft {{was also}} {{reportedly}} nervous of executing Fenians, because of threats he had received. On 22 November 1867 he officiated {{at the public}} execution of William Philip Allen, Michael Larkin, and Michael O'Brien, who {{became known as the}} Manchester Martyrs. The three Fenians had been found guilty of the murder of a police officer, and were hanged together. Most accounts claim that Allen died almost instantaneously from a broken neck, but Larkin and O'Brien were not <b>so</b> <b>fortunate.</b> A Catholic priest in attendance, Father Gadd, reported that: ...|$|E

60|$|She {{could have}} said more on the subject; for she had in fact so high an opinion of the Crofts, and {{considered}} her father <b>so</b> very <b>fortunate</b> in his tenants, felt the parish to be so sure of a good example, and the poor of the best attention and relief, that however sorry and ashamed for the necessity of the removal, she could not but in conscience feel that they were gone who deserved not to stay, and that Kellynch Hall had passed into better hands than its owners'. These convictions must unquestionably have their own pain, and severe was its kind; but they precluded that pain which Lady Russell would suffer in entering the house again, and returning through the well-known apartments.|$|R

500|$|Anne Redferne was not <b>so</b> <b>fortunate</b> the {{following}} day, when she faced her second trial, {{for the murder}} of Robert Nutter's father, Christopher, to which she pleaded not guilty. Demdike's statement to Nowell, which accused Anne of having made clay figures of the Nutter family, was read out in court. Witnesses were called to testify that Anne was a witch [...] "more dangerous than her Mother". But she refused to admit her guilt to the end, and had given no evidence against any others of the accused. Anne Redferne was found guilty.|$|E
500|$|The executioner, William Calcraft, was {{the most}} famous of the 19th century, but was {{reportedly}} nervous of executing Fenians, because of threats he had received.

Most accounts claim that Allen died almost instantaneously from a broken neck, but Larkin and O'Brien were not <b>so</b> <b>fortunate.</b> Father Gadd, reported that: ...|$|E
500|$|Although Continental Congress President John Hancock praised Hopkins for the fleet's performance, {{its failure}} to capture Glasgow gave opponents of the Navy {{in and out of}} Congress {{opportunities}} for criticism. Nicholas Biddle wrote of the action, [...] "A more imprudent, ill-conducted affair never happened". Abraham Whipple, captain of Columbus, endured rumours and accusations of cowardice for a time, but eventually asked for a court-martial to clear his name. Held on 6 May by a panel consisting of officers who had been on the cruise, he was cleared of cowardice, although he was criticised for errors of judgment. John Hazard, captain of Providence, was not <b>so</b> <b>fortunate.</b> Charged by his subordinate officers with a variety of offences, including neglect of duty during the Glasgow action, he was convicted by court-martial and forced to surrender his commission.|$|E
50|$|The Fishers met Louis I. Kahn in 1960. He {{was their}} second choice as architect, but a generous working {{relationship}} soon developed.

50|$|During {{the four}} next years, {{leading up to}} the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona, Tomas Johansson won two more World Championship medals. Every {{international}} championship during these years was won by Aleksandr Karelin, <b>so</b> Johansson was <b>fortunate</b> when he was drawn at {{the opposite side of the}} olympic tournament. After an initial tie against Hungarian László Klauz, Johansson won three bouts to reach the Gold medal match.
