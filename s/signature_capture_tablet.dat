40|$|Until recently, most 3 D {{graphics}} applications {{had been}} regarded as too computationally intensive for devices other than desktop computers and gaming consoles. This notion is rapidly changing due to improving screen resolutions and computing capabilities of mass-market handheld devices such as cellular phones and PDAs. As the mobile 3 D gaming industry is poised to expand, significant innovations are required to provide users with high-quality 3 D experience under limited processing, memory and energy budgets that are characteristic of the mobile domain. Energy saving schemes such as Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS), as well as system-level power and performance optimization methods for mobile devices require accurate and fast workload prediction. In this paper, we {{address the problem of}} workload prediction for mobile 3 D graphics. We propose and describe a signature-based estimation technique for predicting 3 D graphics workloads. By analyzing a gaming benchmark, we show that monitoring specific parameters of the 3 D pipeline provides better prediction accuracy over conventional approaches. We describe how <b>signatures</b> <b>capture</b> such parameters concisely to make accurate workload predictions. Signature-based prediction is computationally efficient because first, signatures are compact, and second, they do not require elaborate model evaluations. Thus, they are amenable to efficient, real-time prediction. A fundamental difference between signatures and standard history-based predictors is that <b>signatures</b> <b>capture</b> previous outcomes as well as the cause that led to the outcome, and use both to predict future outcomes. We illustrate the utility of signature-based workload estimation technique by using it as a basis for DVFS in 3 D graphics pipelines...|$|R

40|$|Signature is a {{behavioral}} biometric: {{it is not}} based on the physical properties, such as fingerprint or face, of the individual, but behavioral ones. Signature verification is split into two according to the available data in the input. Offline (static) signature verification takes as input the image of a signature and is useful in automatic verification of signatures found on bank checks and documents. Online (dynamic) signature verification uses <b>signatures</b> that are <b>captured</b> by pressure-sensitive <b>tablets</b> that extract dynamic properties of a signature in addition to its shape. The purpose of project is to develop an authentication system based on personal signatures. Signature verification is an important research topic in the area of biometric authentication.

A visual-based online signature verification system in which the signer’s pen tip is tracked. The data acquisition of the system consists of only low-cost cameras (webcams) and does not need special equipment such as an electronic tablet. Online signature data is obtained from the images captured by the webcams by tracking the pen tip. The pen tip tracking is implemented by the Sequential Monte Carlo method in real time. Then, the distance between the input signature data and reference signature data enrolled in advance is computed using Dynamic Time Warping (DTW). Finally, the input signature is classified as genuine or a forgery by comparing the distance with a threshold. ...|$|R
