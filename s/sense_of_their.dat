At the Miss USA 2009 competition, Prejean became {{the subject of}} a controversy because of her response to a question about same-sex marriage. Scher said that the controversy would not affect Prejean's involvement with the organization and that the issue of same-sex marriage was not relevant to the group's activities. Prejean said that in volunteering with JC's Girls, she encountered pornographic models who, through exploitation and abuse, had developed very low self-esteem but who had regained a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> own dignity because of their interaction with JC's Girls volunteers.|$|E

Players are left without guidance to determine whether game elements are decipherable subpuzzles or simply false signals. These sorts of puzzles include hidden warp gates, enigmatic obelisks, invisible platforms, sequences of tetrominos, a ciphered alphabet, and QR codes. One of the game's recurring themes is an ancient civilization that attempted to make <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> dimensionality, as told through artifacts.|$|E
5|$|Beato pioneered {{and refined}} the {{techniques}} of hand-colouring photographs and making panoramas. He may have started hand-colouring photographs {{at the suggestion of}} Wirgman, or he may have seen the hand-coloured photographs made by partners Charles Parker and William Parke Andrew. Whatever the inspiration, Beato's coloured landscapes are delicate and naturalistic and his coloured portraits, more strongly coloured than the landscapes, are appraised as excellent. As well as providing views in colour, Beato worked to represent very large subjects in a way that gave a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> vastness. Throughout his career, Beato's work is marked by spectacular panoramas, which he produced by carefully making several contiguous exposures of a scene and then joining the resulting prints together, thereby re-creating the expansive view. The complete version of his panorama of Pehtang comprises seven photographs joined together almost seamlessly for a total length of more than 2 metres (6 1/2ft).|$|E

On the morning of the bull run, Imran suggests they make a pact to make a promise if they survive the event. Imran vows to publish his poetry (which he has penned down in his private diary), Arjun vows to go to Morocco with Laila, and Kabir promises to tell Natasha that {{he does not want to}} marry her.

They are free to define themselves and do whatever it is they want to do. This is a type of humanistic therapy that forces the client to explore the meaning of their life, as well as its purpose.

Existential therapy involves trying to resolve this conflict.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} {{native-born}} artists {{at the time}} followed the European Romantic painters in their desire to document the various cultures of Mexico. These painters were called costumbristas, a word deriving from costumbre (custom). The styles of these painters were not always strictly Romantic, involving other styles as well. Most of these painters were from the upper classes and educated in Europe. While the European painters viewed subjects as exotic, the costumbristas had a more nationalistic <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> home countries. One of these painters was Agustín Arrieta from Puebla, who applied realistic techniques to scenes from his home city, capturing its brightly painted tiles and ceramics. His scenes often involved everyday life such as women working in kitchen and depicted black and Afro-Mexican vendors.|$|E

25|$|The House of Montfort's victory {{strengthened}} {{the position of}} England in Brittany. One {{of the effects of}} the Breton War of Succession was to intensify the rivalries between England and France with Brittany as the contested prize. The Houses of Penthièvre and Montfort were united in the <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> opposition to the attempted annexation of Brittany by Charles V of France as a consequence of this Breton civil war. The French king sent the Constable of France, Bertrand de Guesclin, into Brittany with the goal of uniting it to the French crown. When the Breton nobles rebelled against this proposed unification, John IV was able to return from England, assisted once again by a strong army including his English ally, and was able to re-establish his rule. The deposed Joan of Penthièvre joined in the efforts to return John IV to Brittany to defend the Duchy against the advances of Charles V. John IV had three wives but only his third wife, Joan of Navarre, bore him children. John IV died on 1 November 1399. Joan remained a widow for four years acting as a regent for her son John V. The House of Montfort's difficulties in maintaining the Ducal crown continued when John V, Duke of Brittany succeeded his father.|$|E
25|$|Taylor {{built upon}} Heidegger’s work when he {{described}} {{human beings as}} constantly being engaged {{in the process of}} interpreting and re-interpreting themselves using their own unique perspectives based on their thoughts, feelings, and desires. According to Taylor, human beings make <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> feelings by seeing “them as embodying a judgment about the object they bear on: ‘To experience fear is to experience some object as terrifying or dangerous; to experience shame is to experience some objects as shameful or humiliating” (Taylor: 47, as cited in Richardson et al.: 216). What Taylor is getting at is that Dasein's emotions provides him with a sense of situational understanding and are “affective modes of awareness” (as cited in Richardson et al.: 216). Psychologists practicing ontological hermeneutics in counseling write that this standpoint is in stark contrast to mainstream cognitive approaches which hold that emotions are merely byproducts of our cognitive awareness. Instead, Taylor is taking the cognitive-affective relation out of a linear mode of understanding (thoughts lead to emotions) and placing it phenomenologically in non-linear fashion (thoughts=emotions=interpreted knowledge, meaning they don’t necessarily happen in sequence). This affective mode of awareness serves as more than just knowledge about the world and/or about Dasein, where upon Taylor takes the theory to its logical conclusion: if Dasein's emotions reflect his judgments about the world around him, they also show what is important to him and why. For example, to experience love for another person subjectively informs Dasein that the relationship with that person is important to him. It is through such subjective experience that Dasein's world and his experiences become meaningful to him. Richardson et al. say that this contrast between Taylor’s theory and mainstream approaches has profound implications for conceptualizing human suffering as therapists. Taylor's argument is that emotions are not the mere result of cognitive processes, but subjective judgments about how human beings view their world around them and what is important to them, then it begs questions like what is human suffering, what causes human suffering, is all suffering bad, etc. Taylor, drawing on ontological hermeneutics, takes the phenomenon of human suffering out of the objective, scientific realm (where mainstream psychotherapy has currently placed it) and restores it to the subjective realm of embodied experience. Proponents of ontological hermeneutics state that this is where it rightfully belongs.|$|E

ILM's face- and motion-capture [...] "CloneCam" [...] {{technology}} recorded actors' voice and physical performances.

Consequently, the script's dialogue was reduced while reliance on characters' expressions— captured through the CloneCam— increased.

This ritualistic touching is to be distinguished from the utilitarian kind that grasps, manipulates, or holds”.
