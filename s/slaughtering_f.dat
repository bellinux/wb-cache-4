40|$|In 1996, the USDA began {{reporting}} cattle-on-feed placements {{in various}} weight groups, which should provide information regarding expected slaughter timings and improve fed cattle price forecasts and marketing strategies. Private {{data were collected}} to obtain the necessary degrees of freedom to test statistical relationships between placement weight distributions, beef supply, and fed cattle prices. Use of placement weights improved beef supply forecasts only at a one-month horizon; it contributed nothing to price forecast accuracy or returns from selectively hedging. Key Words: fed cattle, forecasting, marketing, prices, placements. Despite long-term efforts to produce accurate fed cattle price forecasts, economists have found this a daunting task (Kastens, Schroeder, and Plain). However, cattle producers indicate that they rely on price forecasts for making production, market timing, and forward pric-ing decisions (Schroeder et al.). Recently, the USDA began reporting monthly steer and heifer placement on feed numbers by weight in the monthly Cattle on Feed Report. These placement-weight data are expected to im-prove fed cattle marketing projections, since cattle placed on feed at a particular weight will typically be fed a similar and relatively fixed number of days before <b>slaughter.</b> <b>Fed</b> cattle marketings {{are the most important}} fed cattle price determinant; therefore, improved ability to project marketing should also improve price forecasting accuracy.

40|$|Restriction {{fragment}} length polymorphism {{analysis of}} rRNA genes {{was employed to}} genetically compare Fusobacterium necrophorum subsp. necrophorum and F. necrophorum subsp. funduliforme isolates from multiple abscesses of the same liver and isolates from liver abscesses, the ruminal wall, and ruminal contents from the same animal. Four livers with multiple abscesses and samples of ruminal contents, ruminal walls, and liver abscesses were collected from 11 cattle at <b>slaughter.</b> <b>F.</b> necrophorum was isolated from all liver abscesses, nine ruminal walls, and six ruminal content samples. Chromosomal DNA of the isolates was extracted and single or double digested with restriction endonucleases (EcoRI, EcoRV, SalI, and HaeIII); then restriction fragments were hybridized with a digoxigenin-labeled cDNA probe transcribed from a mixture of 16 S and 23 S rRNAs from Escherichia coli. EcoRI alone or in combination with EcoRV yielded the most discriminating ribopatterns for comparison. Within the subspecies multiple isolates from the same liver were indistinguishable based on the ribopattern obtained with EcoRI. The hybridization patterns of liver abscess isolates were concordant {{with those of the}} corresponding isolates from ruminal walls in eight of nine sets of samples. None of the six ruminal content isolates matched either the liver abscess isolates or the ruminal wall isolates. The genetic similarity between the isolates from liver abscesses and ruminal walls supports the hypothesis that F. necrophorum isolates of liver abscesses originate from the rumen...|$|R

40|$|Comparative {{performance}} of two broiler hybrids (Cobb- 500 and Ross) under small-scale production system in Debre Zeit, central Ethiopia was evaluated. Questionnaire {{was also used}} to collect information on management and marketing of small-scale broiler production. A total of 500 "as hatched" day-old chicks (250 from each hybrid) were purchased and reared until <b>slaughter.</b> Average feed (<b>F</b> 1) and water intake (W 1), health status and mortality of the birds were recorded on daily basis and average live weight (LWT) on weekly basis. Beginning from week eight {{every two to three}} other days., "full fed" birds that attained live weight of 2. 4 kg or more were slaughtered to determine dresses carcass weight and dressing percentage. The Cobb- 500 had significantly higher mean values (P< 0. 001) than the Ross for F 1, W 1, LWT, slaughter and carcass weights. A significantly higher proportion of Cobb- 500 (65. 7 %) reached market age than Ross chickens (37. 65) during the 8. 9 weeks of age. A relatively higher marginal revenue and lower marginal cost was obtained for Cobb- 500 than for the Ross chickens. It was concluded that the Cobb- 500 had better overall performance than the Ross under the present small-scale production system in Debre Zei...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{geographic}} {{distribution of}} Fasciola hepatica infection {{in relation to}} management routines was studied in Swedish dairy herds by testing for F. hepatica antibodies with the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). In addition, all farmers were sent a questionnaire asking for information about type of production, management routines and historical record of <b>F.</b> hepatica at <b>slaughter.</b> A total of 176 farmers (41 %) responded to the questionnaire. A total of 426 bulk tank milk (BTM) samples {{were randomly selected from}} the period September to October 2012 representing approximately 10 % of all herds in Sweden. The overall seroprevalence was 25 % (n = 107; 95 % confidence interval = 21 - 29 %) with a concen-tration of herds located in south-western Sweden. Among the seropositive herds, 31 (29 %) had antibody levels indicating production loss. There {{were no significant differences in}} seropositivity between organic and conventional herds or due to pasture management routines. The length of grazing period, which increased the risk for heifers, was found to be the most influential factor. A discrepancy was noted between reported F. hepatica presence at meat inspection and herds that were seropositive based on BTM-ELISA results. Although the largest proportion of seropositive BTM samples (80 %) came from herds where liver fluke presence had been observed at meat inspection after slaughter, seropositive BTM samples were also diagnosed in five herds (17 %) with no remarks at <b>slaughter.</b> In conclusion, <b>F.</b> hepatica is a common parasite in Swedish dairy herds and the month of heifer turn-out and the grazing period length were the most influential factors observed...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{experiment}} was to examine relationships between the growth rate (LWG) and estimates of voluntary feed intake, feed conversion efficiency (GFE), temperament, susceptibility to chronic (longer-term) stress, indices of mature weight and indices of metabolic rate within groups of similar cattle run together. Sixty Hereford x Angus cross 9 month old male cattle (30 bulls and 30 steers) were allocated to either the fastest growing two-thirds or slowest growing third (Restricted-Slow Group (RS)), based on their growth rate over a 100 day period commencing on d 0. The fastest growing two-thirds were randomly allocated between the Fast (F) and Restricted-Fast (RF) groups. Restriction of growth of the RF and RS treatment groups commenced on d 112. Treatment group F cattle (10 bulls, 10 steers) were grown rapidly to achieve slaughter weights of 550 and 525 kg for bulls and steers at 16 - 18 months of age, respectively. Treatment group RS and RF were fed to achieve a similar weight at about 25 months of age. The trial was therefore a 3 x 2 factorial with 3 growth path groups and 2 castration groups. Bulls gained 18 % faster than steers in the F treatment group up to slaughter (1. 10 ± 0. 03 and 0. 93 ± 0. 03 kg/d, respectively, P< 0. 001). No {{significant difference was found}} between live weight gains of bulls and steers of the RF and RS groups(0. 56 ± 0. 02 vs. 0. 51 ± 0. 02 kg/d, respectively, NS). Organic matter intakes (OMI) measured using chromium intraruminal capsules ranged between 1. 45 - 170, 1. 19 - 1. 53, 0. 89 - 1. 02 and 0. 94 - 1. 20 kg OMI/ 100 kg LWT/d for the four separate intake periods. These values were all lower than predicted values, reflecting possible poor pasture quality and/or inaccurate measurement of OMI. During the d 90 - 100 period under ad libitum feeding the bulls were significantly more efficient than the steers (0. 24 ± 0. 01 vs. 0. 18 ± 0. 01 kg LWG/kg OMI,P< 0. 001), and F and RF cattle had significantly higher feed conversion efficiency (GFE) than RS cattle (0. 23 ± 0. 0 l vs. 0. 16 ± 0. 02 kg LWG/kg OMI, P< 0. 005). During the later intake periods the fast-growing F treatment group was significantly more efficient at food conversion than the restricted groups (RF and RS) on all occasions. No differences in temperament, as assessed by stepping rate and subjective scoring in a weigh crate, and flight distance measures, were found between bulls and steers. The RF treatment group had a consistently lower, but not always significantly different, temperament scores than the F or RS groups. Plasma cortisol levels were significantly (P< 0. 001) lower in bulls than in steers on all occasions. No sex differences existed in muscle glycogen content. Weight-adjusted withers heights was lower (P< 0. 05) in bulls than in steers on d 208, 306 and 579, however there was no differences between the treatment groups. At <b>slaughter</b> the treatment <b>F</b> cattle had shorter carcass lengths, lighter livers, greater fat depths and kidney fat weights (P< 0. 001) than the RF and RS groups. Bulls had shorter femur bones, lower fat depth and kidney fat weight and liver weights, than steers (P< 0. 005) of the same carcass weight. Relationships were evaluated across all 60 cattle together by expressing each trait as a residual for each animal relative to the mean for its sex by treatment group. Measures of average daily gain, OMI, GFE and muscle glycogen levels were not very repeatable over time as measured by correlation coefficients. Temperament indices (range 0. 31 - 0. 71, P< 0. 05) and cortisol levels (range 0. 29 - 0. 48, P< 0. 05) were repeatable over time. Weight-adjusted height measurements (range 0. 36 - 0. 48, P< 0. 01) were also repeatable when all 60 cattle were measured. Relationships were investigated between various measurements and LWG prior to the measurement, LWG to 16 months of age and LWG to slaughter. No significant consistent relationships were observed between various long-term growth rates and either GFE, temperament, indices of-mature weight or -chronic stress. Moderate but inconsistent relationships were found between OMI and longer-term gain. It appears from this study that no consistent relationships between the various measurements and longer-term LWG exist in the cattle studied...|$|R
