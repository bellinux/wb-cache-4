5|$|In {{accordance}} with recommendations {{made by the}} California's Department of Education, Rocklin Unified School District students are taught using a standards-based curriculum; each student much fulfill a set of essential skills before {{they are allowed to}} pass the class. The program is initially implemented in district elementary schools. For some classes, like English, essential skills may be demonstrated by receiving a passing grade on assigned essays or tests. In classes like mathematics, Essential Skills must be demonstrated by receiving a passing grade in specific skills on cumulative tests. In addition, WHS policy does not allow F or D grades. Any grade below a grade of C is considered a No Mark (NM) or a No Credit (NC); the class must then be repeated to get a passing grade. This plan attempts to prepare students for the California High School Exit Exam, or CAHSEE test, which they are expected to pass prior to graduation; CAHSEE is provided to <b>students</b> <b>during</b> their second year. The test covers grade 6–10 language arts concepts, as well as pre-algebraic and Algebra I mathematics.|$|E
