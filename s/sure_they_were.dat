5|$|Trapper Nelson {{was born}} Vincent Nostokovich (or Natulkiewicz) to Polish {{immigrant}} parents in Trenton, New Jersey, in 1908 or 1909. As a boy, {{to earn money}} he began trapping animals such as muskrats in the marshes of New Jersey. His parents did not speak English, so Nelson would often assist them in translating to make <b>sure</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> not taken advantage of. However, when his mother died and his father remarried, Nelson ran away from home, heading west.|$|E
5|$|Johnston {{protested that}} the British {{government}} {{could not take}} part in the kind of judicial enquiry Smith described, as its sovereignty could not be subject to any outside judgement and there was nothing to arbitrate anyway. Smith was again resolute: why, he queried, was Whitehall so adamant to avoid legal arbitration if its ministers were so <b>sure</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> right? He promised to drop the matter if such a panel ruled against him, but to no avail. Johnston said only that he would telegraph Whitehall to inform them that Reedman's appointment was imminent. Dupont confirmed it that afternoon, telling the Rhodesian Legislative Assembly that the mission had been accepted by Portugal.|$|E
5|$|But it {{was also}} during the mint's second tour of duty that women began to find work at the New Orleans Mint. Several women workers were sent from the Philadelphia Mint to teach those in New Orleans how to adjust money. About this time, the mint {{employed}} forty-four women. Thirty-nine worked as adjusters – employees who weighed the unstamped coin planchets to make <b>sure</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> the proper weight before coining. These women would sit at long narrow tables, filing the planchets down to the proper weight, wearing special aprons with pouches attached to the sleeves and the waist to catch the excess dust. Five women served as counters and packers before the coins were shipped to Washington, D.C. Some women were eventually employed at the coining presses.|$|E

It was initially estimated that we had killed five and injured seventeen, but we only counted the bodies that we saw drop in front of us.|$|E
25|$|Whilst commoners {{could not}} wear finer clothes than nobles did, the nobility {{had to make}} <b>sure</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> not better dressed than the King and his family. In 1528 a royal decree decided that no noble could own more than three clothes of silk. No ladies or maids could wear broad bonnets. Pearls in {{textiles}} as well as textiles containing gold were reserved for royal persons.|$|E
25|$|The bomber {{carrying}} the missile was modified {{with an additional}} antenna and equipment at the bombardier's position needed to guide the RASCAL. During the flight to the launch point, the bombardier transferred wind and navigation data periodically to the missile. Prior to launch the bombardier tuned a video relay receiver, altitude phasing, and adjusted the terminal guidance tracking indicator. Missile control surfaces were also checked to make <b>sure</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> functional.|$|E

In room 43 hung works by André Lhote, Roger de La Fresnaye, André Dunoyer de Segonzac, Luc-Albert Moreau and André Mare.|$|E
25|$|Francia outlawed all opposition, and {{established}} a secret police force. His underground prison {{was known as the}} 'chamber of truth', and most of Paraguay's manufactures were made with prison labour. He abolished flogging, but his implementation of the death penalty was brutal, as he insisted all executions be carried out at a banquillo ("stool") under an orange tree outside his window. So as not to waste bullets, most victims were bayoneted, while their families were not allowed to collect the corpses until they had been lying there all day, to make <b>sure</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> dead.|$|E
25|$|The {{information}} segment {{was introduced}} in Season 2. It consists of Lizzy Lovette and later Sally Stanton giving a brief report on a particular topic. Teams are asked a 10-point buzz-in question on the topic to make <b>sure</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> listening. Initially the team who correctly answered the question also {{won the right to}} be the first team to get their question round, but was later dropped. No points are lost if a team answers the question incorrectly, but will be locked out in the next question. Should this happen, another question would be asked by Reeve for the remaining teams.|$|E

25|$|In {{the spring}} of 1911 the artists soon to be label Cubists made <b>sure</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> shown {{together}} by infiltrating the placement committee. Le Fauconnier's role {{as secretary of the}} salon facilitated the goal of hanging their works together. The result created a scandale. Until then, works hung in alphabetical order of the artists names. In Salle 41 were placed the works of Metzinger, Gleizes, Léger, Delaunay, Le Fauconnier and Marie Laurencin (at the request of Guillaume Apollinaire). In room 43 hung works by André Lhote, Roger de La Fresnaye, André Dunoyer de Segonzac, Luc-Albert Moreau and André Mare.|$|E
25|$|Oral tales, not {{recorded}} until much later, include the widely reported and possibly mythical one that Livingstone used to beat corpses at funerals with his walking stick to make <b>sure</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> dead {{and not simply}} shamming. His wife defended him passionately, claiming he was charitable to the hungry and sick. Her defence is quite plausible: Livingstone was quick-tempered {{and may have been}} violent and kind at different times. However, his distribution of food may have been limited to the headmen appointed by him to control the estate workforce rather than general. Her defence was that Livingstone was good master, not a bad one as the commission claimed. The concept of the master-servant relationship {{was at the heart of}} colonial society, but this concept was precisely what Chilembwe was fighting with his schools and self-help schemes, and ultimately why Livingstone was killed.|$|E
25|$|In 1971 a magnitude-6.6 {{earthquake}} in San Fernando caused some {{damage to the}} Caltech campus. Engineers who evaluated the damage found that two historic buildings dating {{from the early days}} of the Institute—Throop Hall and the Goodhue-designed Culbertson Auditorium—had cracked. These were some of the first reinforced concrete buildings, and their plans did not contain enough details (such as how much reinforcing bar had been embedded in the concrete) to be <b>sure</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> safe, so the engineers recommended demolition. However, demolishing these historic structures required considerably more effort than would have been necessary had they been in real danger of collapse. A large wrecking ball was used to demolish Throop Hall, and smashing the concrete revealed massive amounts of rebar, far in excess of safety requirements. The rebar had to be cut up before the pieces could be hauled away, and the process took much longer than expected.|$|E

500|$|In 1972, Lester {{returned}} to the interscholastic ranks {{as a head coach}} at Paint Branch High School in Burtonsville, Maryland, which awarded him a ten-year contract. It was Paint Branch's third year of varsity football, and their first two campaigns had ended with 3–7 records. About the move, Lester said, [...] "I spent too long treating college players nice and making <b>sure</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> happy... I don't have to do that now. I can coach here. If they want to quit, fine."In 1975, he led Paint Branch to the Class B state championship.|$|E
500|$|In a study {{reported}} in 1997, William M. Goldstein and Robin M. Hogarth gave an experimental group {{was given a}} questionnaire containing general-knowledge questions such as [...] "Who was born first, Aristotle or Buddha?" [...] or [...] "Was the zipper invented before or after 1920?". The subjects filled in the answers they believed to be correct and rated how <b>sure</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> of them. The results showed subjects tend to be under-confident of their answers to questions designated by the experimenters as to be easy, and overconfident of their answers to questions designated as hard.|$|E
500|$|Khánh {{had been}} {{scheduled}} to meet with Quát and his cabinet in a building at Tan Son Nhut. It was the new ministry's first meeting, and Taylor and General William Westmoreland, the commander of US forces in Vietnam, were present. Due to the poor relations, Khánh was <b>sure</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> plotting against him. He thus suspected their insistence on his attending Quát's first cabinet meeting {{to be part of a}} trap, and decided to excuse himself partway through the meeting to go [...] "on tour", at which point he saw troops massing around the perimeter of the air field.|$|E

500|$|By 1936, the Stork {{was doing}} well {{enough to have a}} million-dollar gross for the first time. Young debutante Brenda Frazier made her first visit to the Stork Club in the spring of 1938; she became a regular, {{bringing}} many young people from the society set with her. Billingsley welcomed young people who were not old enough to drink. [...] He encouraged them to gather at the Stork Club by inviting debutantes to the club and holding a yearly [...] "Glamor Girl" [...] election. As the father of three daughters, Billingsley kept an eye on the young people, making <b>sure</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> not served alcohol and {{that they were able to}} have an enjoyable time at the Stork Club without it.|$|E
500|$|Around 500 tribbles {{were created}} for the episode, with special tribbles created for certain {{purposes}} with beanbags or surgical balloons inserted in them. Three additional sets were {{created for the}} episode, although there were problems with finding enough matching chairs for the trading post area. The chairs had to be pulled out of showrooms around Los Angeles County, and Pevney was warned to make <b>sure</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> not damaged during the episode's brawl scene. William Campbell had previously appeared as Trelane in [...] "The Squire of Gothos" [...] and {{was intended to be}} a recurring villain as Koloth.

500|$|An early {{draft of}} the episode {{originally}} featured an Opera house explosion, which was changed because the writers felt using a dam would be more exciting. An early rule of Sideshow Bob episodes was to recap what had gone on in previous Bob episodes, in case the viewer had forgotten who he was. The original script was run by the Frasier producers to make <b>sure</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> okay with it, and they only had one problem. There was a very brief scene in which Cecil talks to a visible character and refers to her as [...] "Maris", who in Frasier is an unseen character, and the producers of Frasier said the scene should go. The writers {{spent a long time}} trying to figure out a civilization that considered chief hydrological engineer a true calling and chose the Cappadocians, who were famous for underground cities although not specifically dams.|$|E
