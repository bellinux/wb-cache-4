25|$|Many systems {{also support}} a {{low-power}} sleep mode {{in which the}} processing functions of the machine are powered down, using a little power to preserve the contents of RAM and support waking up. Instantaneous resumption {{is one of the}} advantages of sleep mode over hibernation. A hibernated system must start up and read data back to RAM, which typically takes time. A system in sleep mode only needs to power up the CPU and display, which is almost instantaneous. On the other hand, a system in sleep mode still consumes power to keep the data in the RAM. Detaching power from a system in sleep mode results in data loss, while cutting the power of a system in hibernation has no risk; the hibernated system can resume when and if the power is restored.

25|$|A {{wet cell}} battery has a liquid electrolyte. Other names are flooded cell, since the liquid covers all {{internal}} parts, or vented cell, since gases produced during operation can {{escape to the}} air. Wet cells were a precursor to dry cells and are commonly used as a learning tool for electrochemistry. They can be built with common laboratory supplies, such as beakers, for demonstrations of how electrochemical cells work. A particular type of wet cell known as a concentration cell is important in understanding corrosion. Wet cells may be primary cells (non-rechargeable) or secondary cells (rechargeable). Originally, all practical primary batteries such as the Daniell cell were built as open-top glass jar wet cells. Other primary wet cells are the Leclanche cell, Grove cell, Bunsen cell, Chromic acid cell, Clark cell, and Weston cell. The Leclanche cell chemistry was adapted to the first dry cells. Wet cells are still used in automobile batteries and in industry for <b>standby</b> <b>power</b> for switchgear, telecommunication or large uninterruptible power supplies, but in many places batteries with gel cells have been used instead.

40|$|Reduction in leakage {{power has}} become an {{important}} concern in low voltage, low power and high performance applications. In this paper, we use dual threshold technique to reduce leakage power by assigning high threshold voltage to some transistors in non-critical paths, and using lowthreshold transistors in critical paths. In order to achieve the best leakage power saving under target performance constraints, an algorithm is presented for selecting and assigning an optimal high threshold voltage. A general standby leakage current model which has been veri ed by HSPICE is used to estimate <b>standby</b> leakage <b>power.</b> Results show that dual threshold technique is good for power reduction during both standby and active modes. The <b>standby</b> leakage <b>power</b> savings for some ISCAS benchmarks can be more than 50 %. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — We {{present in}} this paper the method of Generalized Nodal Control for <b>standby</b> leakage <b>power</b> reduction. First, a sparse set of input and {{internal}} nodes to control are identified using a novel algorithm based on Reduced Ordered Binary Decision Diagrams (ROBDDs) and Fiduccia-Mattheyses Partitioning. Then, customized control gates with ”forced” transistor stacks are inserted at these select locations to achieve effective subthreshold leakage control with minimal overhead addition. Compared to the method of input assignment, our technique is more generalized and more effective, especially on large circuits with high logic depths. We implemented our algorithm in C and tested it on several ISCAS 85 and MCNC 91 benchmark circuits. Experimental results show an average of 29 % <b>standby</b> leakage <b>power</b> reduction and a worst runtime of 3 minutes only. I...|$|R

This technique improves the low skew NAND and NOR circuit performance by 7 % and 11 %, high skew NAND and NOR by 8 % and 13 % respectively.

[...] Standby generators may serve as emergency power for a factory or data center, or may also be operated in parallel with the local utility system to reduce peak power demand charge from the utility. [...] Diesel engines can produce strong torque at relatively low rotational speeds, which is generally desirable when driving an alternator, but diesel fuel in long-term storage can be subject to problems resulting from water accumulation and chemical decomposition.

2500|$|Zero-energy {{buildings}} are built with significant energy-saving features. [...] The {{heating and cooling}} loads are lowered by using high-efficiency equipment, added insulation, high-efficiency windows, natural ventilation, and other techniques.

[...] Water heating loads can be lowered by using water conservation fixtures, heat recovery units on waste water, and by using solar water heating, and high-efficiency water heating equipment. [...] In addition, daylighting with skylights or solartubes can provide 100% of daytime illumination within the home. Nighttime illumination is typically done with fluorescent and LED lighting that use 1/3 or less power than incandescent lights, without adding unwanted heat. And miscellaneous electric loads can be lessened by choosing efficient appliances and minimizing phantom loads or <b>standby</b> <b>power.</b> Other techniques to reach net zero (dependent on climate) are Earth sheltered building principles, superinsulation walls using straw-bale construction, Vitruvianbuilt pre-fabricated building panels and roof elements plus exterior landscaping for seasonal shading.|$|E

2500|$|Generators, as used {{in power}} {{stations}} or in <b>standby</b> <b>power</b> systems, will have automatic voltage regulators (AVR) to stabilize their voltages as the load on the generators changes. The first automatic voltage regulators for generators were electromechanical systems, but a modern AVR uses solid-state devices. An AVR is a feedback control system, that measures the output voltage of the generator, compares that output to a set point, and generates an error signal {{that is used to}} adjust the excitation of the generator. [...] As the excitation current in the field winding of the generator increases, its terminal voltage will increase. [...] The AVR [...] will control current by using power electronics devices; generally {{a small part of the}} generator's output is used to provide current for the field winding. Where a generator is connected in parallel with other sources such as an electrical transmission grid, changing the excitation has more of an effect on the reactive power produced by the generator than on its terminal voltage, which is mostly set by the connected power system. Where multiple generators are connected in parallel, the AVR system will have circuits to ensure all generators operate at the same power factor. AVRs on grid-connected power station generators may have additional control features to help stabilize the electrical grid against upsets due to sudden load loss or faults.|$|E
