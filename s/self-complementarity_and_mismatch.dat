40|$|The {{in vitro}} {{transcription}} pattern of simian virus 40 (SV 40) deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) by a mammalian ribonucleic acid (RNA) polymerase, was studied by electron microscopy and velocity sedimentation techniques. It was found that (i) the majority of supercoiled SV 40 DNA molecules displayed a single binding site for the enzyme, (ii) the supercoiled structure of SV 40 DNA was frequently retained during transcription, and (iii) the majority of RNA molecules synthesized from the supercoiled SV 40 DNA template showed no <b>self-complementarity</b> <b>and</b> sedimented relatively homogeneously in the 15 S to 16 S region of a sucrose gradient (in contrast, the RNA product synthesized from the nicked-circular SV 40 DNA template showed <b>self-complementarity</b> <b>and</b> sedimented heterogeneously). RNA polymerase preparations isolated from SV 40 -infected monkey cells were more active than those isolated from uninfected monkey cells...|$|R

40|$|AbstractFinding the {{similarity}} between two sequences {{is a major problem}} in computer science. It is motivated by many issues from computational biology as well as from information retrieval and image processing. These fields take into account possible corruptions of the data caused by genome rearrangements, typing mistakes, and more. Therefore, many applications do not require merely complete resemblance of the sequences, but rather an approximate matching. We consider <b>mismatches</b> <b>and</b> swaps as natural mistakes which are allowed in a meagre number. The edit distance problem with swap <b>and</b> <b>mismatch</b> operations was solved in O(nmlogm) time. Yet, the problem of string matching with at most k swaps <b>and</b> <b>mismatches</b> errors was open. In this paper, we present an algorithm that finds all locations where the pattern has at most k <b>mismatch</b> <b>and</b> swap errors in time O(nklogm) ...|$|R
40|$|Conditions {{have been}} {{developed}} for reverse transcription by detergent-disrupted virions of Moloney murine leukemia virus which permit synthesis of molecules that appear to be complete transcripts of the 35 S RNA subunits. At limiting Mg 2 + concentration, DNA is synthesized in good yield, up to a maximum size of about 2. 4 X 10 (6) daltons. DNA larger than 2 X 10 (6) daltons, taken from alkaline sucrose gradients, has no detectable <b>self-complementarity</b> <b>and</b> was protected from digestion by S 1 nuclease to an extent of 90 % by annealing to 70 S RNA. All size classes of DNA made in these reactions are primed with RNA, because all are initiated with a pApdAjunction. To produce such long molecules, it is necessary to keep the concentration of Mg 2 + in the reaction mixture below the total concentration of deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates. Under these conditions, degradation of the RNA template is minimized. The rate of DNA synthesis is also slowed by 30 to 50 %, but products longer than 5, 000 nucleotides, which are not found otherwise, are completed between 3 and 6 h of reaction...|$|R

40|$|Errors {{that arise}} from {{tolerance}} variations <b>and</b> <b>mismatches</b> between devices severely degrade the performance of bandgap reference circuits, which are essential building blocks to all highperformance systems. All these error sources have been analyzed (and verified through SPICE) and their design implications have been addressed. It {{has been found that}} resistor tolerance <b>and</b> current-mirror <b>mismatch</b> are the dominant sources of error in bandgap reference-type circuits. Further, it has been found that resistor <b>mismatch,</b> transistor <b>mismatch,</b> <b>and</b> current-mirror <b>mismatch</b> errors have a PTAT variation, while resistor tolerance error has a CTAT dependence – both PTAT and CTAT errors are eliminated by trimming the PTAT terminating resistor in a bandgap circuit, only at room temperature. Resistor TC errors cannot be trimmed out and hence resistors must therefore be carefully selected and designed...|$|R

40|$|The skills <b>mismatch</b> <b>and</b> spatial <b>mismatch</b> {{perspectives}} {{are often}} presented as competing {{explanations of the}} spatial distribution of unemployment within metropolitan areas. This paper argues that the spatial mismatch hypothesis addresses some of the shortcomings of the skills mismatch perspective, while not denying the importance of skills mismatch. The development of the spatial mismatch hypothesis in the US is traced, before considering its relevance in the British context. A framework in which to conceptualise <b>and</b> reconcile skills <b>mismatch</b> <b>and</b> spatial <b>mismatch</b> within metropolitan areas is developed, incorporating the operation of local housing and labour markets {{as well as the}} role of commuting. The paper concludes by arguing that skills <b>and</b> spatial <b>mismatches</b> reinforce each other and that the concept of employability offers some potential to help understand how job searchers and employers make decisions in situations of skills and/or spatial mismatch. The implications for future research are highlighted...|$|R

A CDSMC law is then designed for a general motion control system with both high-order matched <b>and</b> <b>mismatched</b> disturbances, which can attenuate the effects of disturbances from the system output.

40|$|Abstract—Time {{interleaved}} sigma-delta (TIΣΔ) {{architecture is}} a potential candidate for high bandwidth analog to digital converters (ADC) which remains a bottleneck for software and cognitive radio receivers. However, {{the performance of the}} TIΣΔ architecture is limited by the unavoidable gain <b>and</b> offset <b>mismatches</b> resulting from the manufacturing process. This paper presents a novel digital calibration method to compensate the gain <b>and</b> offset <b>mismatch</b> effect. The proposed method takes advantage of the reconstruction digital signal processing on each channel and requires only few logic components for implementation. The run time calibration is estimated to 10 and 15 clock cycles for offset cancellation <b>and</b> gain <b>mismatch</b> calibration respectively.
