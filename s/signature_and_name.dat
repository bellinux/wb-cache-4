Each recording is then visualised by a unique written signature determined by the frequency, sound, rhythm and speech pattern of each participant’s individual voice. Signatures can be further personalised with colour patterns and are easily shareable via social channels. All signatures are rendered in real-time and captured in a 3D gallery {{in the shape of}} a young girl’s face.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the design, acquisition process and baseline {{evaluation of the}} new e-BioSign database, which includes dynamic <b>signature</b> <b>and</b> handwriting information. Data is acquired from 5 different COTS devices: three Wacom devices (STU- 500, STU- 530 and DTU- 1031) specifically designed to capture dynamic <b>signatures</b> <b>and</b> handwriting, and two general purpose tablets (Samsung Galaxy Note 10. 1 and Samsung ATIV 7). For the two Samsung tablets, data is collected using both pen stylus and also the finger in order to study the performance of signature verification in a mobile scenario. Data was collected in two sessions for 65 subjects, and includes dynamic information of the <b>signature,</b> the full <b>name</b> <b>and</b> alpha numeric sequences. Skilled forgeries were also performed for <b>signatures</b> <b>and</b> full <b>names.</b> We also report a benchmark evaluation based on e-BioSign for person verification under three different real scenarios: 1) intra-device, 2) inter-device, and 3) mixed writing-tool. We have experimented the proposed benchmark using the main existing approaches for <b>signature</b> verification: feature- <b>and</b> time functions-based. As a result, {{new insights into the}} problem of signature biometrics in sensor-interoperable scenarios have been obtained, namely: the importance of specific methods for dealing with device interoperability, and the necessity of a deeper analysis on signatures acquired using the finger as the writing tool.

The article in this regard also investigates the importance and role of the ‘notions’ of death, loss of meaning, loss of ownership, and loss of sovereignty in Derrida’s thinking. The contention is that if we take account of Derrida’s reading in Declarations of Independence, it is possible to view constitutions in a very different way, more specifically their ‘origins’, with inevitable implications for constitutional interpretation...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Notions of <b>signature</b> <b>and</b> anomaly {{have formed}} the basis of useful methods in cyber defense, but even in {{combination}} provide only weak evidence for recognizing many events of interest. One can recognize many important events without requiring signatures of specific ways the events can take place and without treating every anomalous behavior as an event.

We shall briefly describe some performance and scalability issues with respect to implementations of XML <b>Signature</b> <b>and</b> Encryption, and then outline some of the challenges related to implementing a one-pass, or streaming implementation of XML Signature.

However, DOM requires an in-memory representation of the document, which can be a major factor that affects performance.
