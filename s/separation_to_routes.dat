Because Rhita Gawr has taken dragon's form, Basilgarrad fights him directly.|$|R
40|$|ACORN (Agent-based Community Oriented Routing Network) is a {{distributed}} multi-agent architecture for the search, {{distribution and}} management of information across networks. ACORN utilises the concept of `information as agent' together with an application of Stanley Milgram's Small World Problem (the idea of Six Degrees of <b>Separation)</b> in order <b>to</b> <b>route</b> individual items of information around a network of people and agents. The ACORN ideal is to achieve a state where a web of users is created such that information distribution, queries and search, and browsing behaviour is encapsulated in a single adaptive architecture which learns community behaviour and knowledge in order <b>to</b> <b>route</b> agents <b>to</b> relevant destinations (users). This paper describes the ACORN architecture and its implementation. We introduce a novel idea of agent meeting places, or Cafes, to carry out community-based information sharing among mobile agents in ACORN. ACORN is compared with similar work, and evaluations of ACORN for information sharing among mobile agents are described. Applications of ACORN include Business to Business and Business to Consumer based e-Commerce solutions, virtual community creation and support systems, peer reviewing systems, and personalized directed information handling. Keywords: Multi-Agent information architectures, autonomous agents, mobile agents, keyphrase matching, multi-agent architecture, community based information handling, e-Commerce. 1...|$|R
40|$|The first {{scientific}} observation related <b>to</b> gas <b>separation</b> was {{encountered by}} J. K Mitchell in 1831.

Membrane is fabricated by various methods and the parameters involved to a certain extent are very complicated. The phase inversion technique that is normally employed to produce membranes are dry/wet, wet, dry and thermal induced phase separation. Other techniques used to produce membrane are also reviewed. This paper reports the latest development in membrane formation for gas <b>separation.</b> The <b>route</b> <b>to</b> produce defect-free and ultrathin-skinned asymmetric membrane is also presented that represents the cutting edge technology in membrane gas separation proces...|$|R

40|$|The {{scheduling}} {{and execution of}} ramp area operations is a challenging task. Unlike aircraft maneuvers on taxiways, ramp area aircraft maneuvers are typically not confined to well-defined trajectories. The stochastic nature can force ramp area aircraft to slow down or stop along <b>routes</b> <b>to</b> the taxiway spot to avoid a loss of <b>separation.</b> <b>To</b> address this, we provide a tool for ramp controllers to help meet the assigned taxiway spot times. We formulate a mixed integer linear program model to compute the optimal push back windows that ensure conflict free trajectories. Initiating the push back within the optimal window ensures each departing aircraft can proceed along the <b>route</b> <b>to</b> the taxiway spot without having to slow down or stop for other traffic.
