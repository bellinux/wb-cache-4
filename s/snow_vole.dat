40|$|<b>Snow</b> <b>voles</b> (Chionomys nivalis) were bait-trapped in the Tatra Mountains, Western Carpathians, Slovakia, and Vitosha and Rila Mountains, Bulgaria. Lead (Pb) {{content in}} the tail {{vertebrae}} was determined. Adult voles were bait-trapped and sampled in September - October (Slovakia 2009 - 2010, Bulgaria 2009). The sampling yielded a total of 33 animals from Slovakia and 24 from Bulgaria. Lead concentrations in bones of voles from the Rila and Vitosha Mountains were approximately three-fold lower than in bones of voles from the Tatra Mountains. The concentration of lead in the bones of voles from Rila Mountains was statistically indistinguishable from that of vole bones from Vitosha Mountains. The content of lead in the bones of voles indicates that the Western Carpathians {{are one of the}} most polluted with lead alpine regions in Europe.

40|$|Bigger is {{apparently}} frequently fitter, and body size is typically heritable, so why don't animals in wild populations evolve towards larger sizes? Different explanations {{have been proposed}} for this apparent "paradox of stasis. " A new study of <b>snow</b> <b>voles</b> in the Swiss Alps finds higher survival in animals with larger body mass and heritability of body mass, but, surprisingly, a genetic decline in body mass is also indicated. The authors suggest a novel explanation for this observation: the appearance of positive phenotypic selection is driven by a confounding variable of {{the age at which}} a juvenile is measured, whereas the evolutionarily relevant selection actually acts negatively on mass via its association with development time. Thus, genes for larger mass are not actually "fitter" because they are associated with longer development times, and juvenile <b>snow</b> <b>voles</b> with longer development times run the risk of not completing development before the first winter snow. However, the genetic decline in body size is not apparent at the phenotypic level, presumably because of countervailing trends in environmental effects on the phenotype...|$|R

40|$|The {{molecular}} phylogeny and morphology of the oxyuroid nematode genus Aspiculuris from voles and house mice has been examined.

50|$|In {{the summer}} {{breeding}} season, female European <b>snow</b> <b>voles</b> have mutually exclusive territories and display considerable aggression towards other females {{of their own}} species when they meet near the territorial boundaries. Males have rather larger, overlapping ranges, and are more socially tolerant. In the winter the territorial boundaries break down and individual males and females become nomadic and solitary. They are aggressive towards other members of their species that they may encounter. When a female meets another female they will often fight but when a male encounters another male, more investigative behaviour takes place. However, if they do fight, {{it will be a}} more intense battle. Males encountering females show intermediate behaviours. These behaviours are probably related to the competition necessary to find enough food in the snow voles' challenging environment, and is in contrast to some other vole species living in more temperate climates. Some of these live solitary lives during the summer and form communal groups in the winter.|$|R
40|$|The {{movements}} of meadow voles {{in a field}} population were studied using radiotelemetry during fall and winter.

Although impacts of some disturbances, most notably fire, have been quantified at the landscape level, some have been ignored and rarely are interactions between disturbances evaluated. We developed conceptual state-and-transition models for each of two broad sagebrush groups-a warm-dry group characterized by Wyoming big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata Nutt. subsp. wyomingensis Beetle & Young) communities and a cool-moist group characterized by mountain big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata Nutt. subsp. vase yana [Rydb. ] Beetle) communities. We used the Vegetation Dynamics Development Tool to explore how the abundance of community phases and states in each conceptual model might be affected by fire, insect outbreak, drought, <b>snow</b> mold, <b>voles,</b> sudden drops in winter temperatures (freeze-kill), livestock grazing, juniper (Juniperus occidentalis var. occidentalis Hook.) expansion, nonnative annual grasses such as cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum L.), and vegetation treatments. Changes in fuel continuity and loading resulted in average fire rotations of 12 yr in the warm-dry sagebrush group and 81 yr in the cool-moist sagebrush group. Model results in the warm-dry sagebrush group indicated postfire seeding success alone was not sufficient to limit the area of cheatgrass domination. The frequency of episodes of very high utilization by domestic livestock during severe drought was a key influence on community phase abundance in our models.

40|$|Voles are {{the most}} {{preferred}} prey of Pygmy Owls (Glaucidium passerinum) in Northern Europe, where the extensive snow cover may decrease the availability of <b>voles.</b> <b>Snow</b> cover may thus cause changes in the diet from what is expected {{on the basis of}} prey abun-dance alone. Food hoarding behaviour of Pygmy Owls was examined in relation to snow cover. Pygmy Owls hoard small birds and mammals in tree holes and nest boxes on their autumn and winter territories. During five winters, we examined hoarded prey items from artificial hoarding boxes provided to Pygmy Owls in central Finland. The most intensive food hoarding periods occurred before the fall of snow, during which 73 % of prey items were hoarded. Presence or absence of snow cover did not affect the number of hoarded birds, but snow cover dramatically lowered the number of hoarded voles. Pygmy Owls began to exploit caches before the beginning of the snowy season and stopped exploita-tion in spring. According to the high utilization degree of the hoarded prey, especially dur-ing the period with permanent snow cover, we suggest that the Pygmy Owl’s food hoard-ing behaviour acts as a buffer for seasonal variation in food supply. 1...|$|R
50|$|Throughout the range, {{small rodents}} form the great {{majority}} of great horned owl prey by number. Weighing a mere 14 to 31.5 g and 20 to 58 g on average, the nine species of New World mice in Peromyscus and eight species voles in Microtus recorded in the diet would appear to be overly small to be as important as they are to a predatory bird of this size. The prominence of these genera is undoubtedly due to the abundance of both genera in the wooded edge habitats frequented by great horned owls. It is estimated that a family of owls with two offspring would need to take about a half dozen (voles) to a dozen (mice) of these rodents every night to satisfy their dietary requirements but apparently the accessibility and abundance of these foods is irresistible as their numeric dominance is indisputable. In 14 studies accumulated for comparison from across North America, Microtus and Peromyscus were each the most numerous prey in 5 of the studies (together 10 out of 14). By winter in areas that hold heavy snow, Peromyscus mice often come to outnumber the voles in the diet since the mice tend to travel over the surface of the <b>snow</b> while the <b>voles</b> make tunnels underneath the snow. Other owls, most notably the great grey owl, habitually crash into the surface of the <b>snow</b> to access <b>voles</b> in their tunnels, a habit only rarely recorded in great horned owls presumably due to its less refined hearing. Notably, the house mouse (Mus musculus), of about as {{the same size as the}} Peromyscus ssp., although taken readily when available, is a relatively minor aspect of the diet as they tend to live much closer to human development than the owls do. Brown rats, despite a similar association with humans and their habitat alterations, also occasionally settle along the fringes of farm fields and meadows and hold much more dietary significance than the house mouse, i.e. the rats were seven times more abundant in pellets from the Upper Midwest. In fact, a healthy family of great horned owls can decimate a colony of field rats, thus potentially performing a key role in controlling a highly destructive pest. In 2134 pellets collected from 17 counties in Pennsylvania, the brown rat was the most common prey species by number, making up to 24%. Great horned owls living in the timbered fringes of garbage or refuse dumps may subsist mostly on rats.|$|R
