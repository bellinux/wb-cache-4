Since version 1.10, DragonFly supports 1:1 userland threading (one kernel thread per userland thread), which is regarded as a relatively <b>simple</b> <b>solution</b> that is also easy to maintain. Inherited from FreeBSD, DragonFly also supports multi-threading.|$|E
5|$|In folklore, silver was {{commonly}} {{thought to}} have mystic powers: for example, a bullet cast from silver is often supposed in such folklore the only weapon that is effective against a werewolf, witch, or other monsters. From this the idiom of a silver bullet developed into figuratively referring to any <b>simple</b> <b>solution</b> with very high effectiveness or almost miraculous results, as in the widely discussed software engineering paper No Silver Bullet. Silver also has more negative cultural meanings: the idiom , referring to a reward for betrayal, references the bribe Judas Iscariot is said in the New Testament to have taken from Jewish leaders in Jerusalem to turn Jesus of Nazareth over to soldiers of the high priest Caiaphas.|$|E

5|$|A businessman, Blackmer, {{visits the}} reclusive Dr Orchard, a {{scientist}} {{who lives in a}} remote house on the Ambro River in South America. From the local plant Sidonicus americanus, Orchard has developed a food additive called Theramine; if administered to animals, the chemical causes them to grow beyond their original size. Enlargement of animal stock would offer a <b>simple</b> <b>solution</b> to world famine and present other economic advantages. Blackmer's boatman, Culp, eavesdrops on the meeting. After a storm forces Blackmer to stay at the house for the night, Culp resolves to steal the Theramine and sell it to the highest bidder. Waiting until the other occupants fall asleep, he steals the keys to Orchard's laboratory from the housekeeper, Mrs Files. While filling a vial with a quantity of the chemical, Culp accidentally knocks the rest of the supply into a sink, and the Theramine drains into the Ambro River.|$|E

25|$|The {{incidence}} of cycles in Lie sphere geometry provides a <b>simple</b> <b>solution</b> {{to the problem}} of Apollonius.

For a generic configuration of circles, there are at most eight such tangent circles.|$|E

However, numerical simulations, and theoretical models, show that the viscosity and magnetic diffusivity have almost the same order of magnitude in magneto-rotationally turbulent disks. Some other factors may possibly affect the advection/diffusion rate: reduced turbulent magnetic diffusion on the surface layers; reduction of the Shakura-Sunyaev viscosity by magnetic fields; and the generation of large scale fields by small scale MHD turbulence –a large scale dynamo.|$|E

He also investigated how western boundary currents, such as the Gulf Stream, dissipated planetary vorticity.

25|$|While Ka {{measures}} {{the strength of}} an acidic molecule, the strength of an aqueous acid solution is measured by pH, which {{is a function of}} the concentration of hydronium ions in solution. The pH of a <b>simple</b> <b>solution</b> of an acid in water is determined by both Ka and the acid concentration. For weak acid solutions, it depends on the degree of dissociation, which may be determined by an equilibrium calculation. For concentrated solutions of strong acids with a pH less than about zero, the Hammett acidity function is a better measure of acidity than the pH.|$|E

25|$|The {{genius of}} Cauchy was {{illustrated}} in his <b>simple</b> <b>solution</b> {{of the problem}} of Apollonius—describing a circle touching three given circles—which he discovered in 1805, his generalization of Euler's formula on polyhedra in 1811, and in several other elegant problems. More important is his memoir on wave propagation, which obtained the Grand Prix of the French Academy of Sciences in 1816. Cauchy's writings covered notable topics including: the theory of series, where he developed the notion of convergence and discovered many of the basic formulas for q-series. In the theory of numbers and complex quantities, {{he was the first to}} define complex numbers as pairs of real numbers. He also wrote on the theory of groups and substitutions, the theory of functions, differential equations and determinants.|$|E
25|$|Having {{the beam}} {{connected}} to the piston shaft by a means that applied force alternately in both directions also meant {{that it was possible}} to use the motion of the beam to turn a wheel. The most <b>simple</b> <b>solution</b> to transforming the action of the beam into a rotating motion was to connect the beam to a wheel by a crank, but because another party had patent rights on the use of the crank, Watt was obliged to come up with another solution. He adopted the epicyclic sun and planet gear system suggested by an employee William Murdoch, only later reverting, once the patent rights had expired, to the more familiar crank seen on most engines today. The main wheel attached to the crank was large and heavy, serving as a flywheel which, once set in motion, by its momentum maintained a constant power and smoothed the action of the alternating strokes. To its rotating central shaft, belts and gears could be attached to drive a great variety of machinery.|$|E
