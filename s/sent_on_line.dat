50|$|The tone <b>sent</b> <b>on</b> the <b>lines</b> was inverted: {{the signal}} {{sent to the}} BBC was a steady 1 kHz tone when no pip was required, and no tone when a pip should be sounded. This let faults <b>on</b> the <b>line</b> be {{detected}} immediately by automated monitoring for loss of audio.|$|R
50|$|In {{distributed}} {{power generation}} the generators are geographically distributed {{and the process}} to bring them online and offline must be carefully controlled. The load control signals can either be <b>sent</b> <b>on</b> separate <b>lines</b> or <b>on</b> the power <b>lines</b> themselves. Voltage and frequency {{can be used as}} signalling mechanisms to balance the loads.|$|R
50|$|The concept uses {{frequency}} {{shifting to}} overcome the narrow bandwidth of regular telephone systems. The input signal is <b>sent</b> <b>on</b> one telephone <b>line</b> as-is, {{or in some cases}} upshifted to provide extra low-frequency response, and <b>sent</b> <b>on</b> a second <b>line</b> shifted down by 3 kHz, which is normally the upper bandpass limit in telephony. Thus, an audio frequency of 5 kHz is sent at 2 kHz. A receiver on the other end then shifts the second line back up and mixes it with the first. This results in greatly improved audio, adding a full octave of range, and pushing the total bandpass to 6 kHz. The sound is then acceptable for voice, if not for music.|$|R
50|$|Reversers {{have been}} used in New South Wales {{especially}} to put starting signals to stop. When the signal was put back to stop, the system automatically <b>sent</b> the train <b>on</b> <b>line</b> bell signal (two bells) to the station in advance. This equipment would have helped prevent the Hawes Junction rail crash.|$|R
50|$|The 802.3an {{standard}} specifies the wire-level modulation for 10GBASE-T to use Tomlinson-Harashima precoding (THP) and pulse-amplitude modulation with 16 {{discrete levels}} (PAM-16), encoded in a two-dimensional checkerboard pattern known as DSQ128 <b>sent</b> <b>on</b> the <b>line</b> at 800 Msymbols/sec. Prior to precoding, {{forward error correction}} (FEC) coding is performed using a 2048,17232 low-density parity-check code on 1723 bits, with the parity check matrix construction based on a generalized Reed-Solomon 32,2,31 code over GF(26). Another 1536 bits are uncoded. Within each 1723+1536 block, there are 1+50+8+1 signaling and error detection bits and 3200 data bits (and occupying 320 ns <b>on</b> the <b>line).</b> By contrast PAM-5 is the modulation technique used in 1000BASE-T Gigabit Ethernet.|$|R
60|$|We {{will not}} dwell long on her painful journey back to Hurst Staple; nor on the wretched {{reflections}} with which {{her mind was}} laden. She <b>sent</b> <b>on</b> a <b>line</b> by post to her eldest daughter, so that she was expected; and Dumpling and the phaëton and the stable-boy were there to meet her. She had feared that Arthur would come: but Arthur had dreaded the meeting also; and, having talked the matter over with his sisters, had remained at home. He was in the book-room, and hearing the wheels, as the carriage drew up to the door, {{he went out to}} greet his mother on the steps.|$|R
50|$|The 50s in Polish {{railways}} were a time {{of serious}} development and improvements. In 1950, construction of TKt48 locomotives started {{and two years later}} a prototype of the Ol49 steam locomotive was built. 1953 brought several new types of electric rolling stock into PKP. Ten units of EP03 electric locomotives and 40 units of EW54 EMUs were ordered from Sweden. EW54 EMUs were <b>sent</b> to operate <b>on</b> <b>lines</b> connecting Warsaw with Mińsk Mazowiecki, Żyrardów and Sochaczew. Meanwhile, EP04 and EU20 locomotives were ordered from the DDR, along with EN56 and ED70 EMUs.|$|R
50|$|The 300 bit/s modems used audio {{frequency-shift}} keying to send data. In {{this system}} the stream of 1s and 0s in computer data is translated into sounds which can be easily <b>sent</b> <b>on</b> the phone <b>lines.</b> In the Bell 103 system, the originating modem sends 0s by playing a 1,070 Hz tone, and 1s at 1,270 Hz, with the answering modem transmitting its 0s on 2,025 Hz and 1s on 2,225 Hz. These frequencies were chosen carefully; {{they are in the}} range that suffers minimum distortion on the phone system and are not harmonics of each other.|$|R

One of the hobos picks {{the lock on}} a switch so that Shack's train, Number 19, will be <b>sent</b> <b>on</b> a branch <b>line,</b> {{making it easier for}} A-No.-1 to board. A-No.-1 unhitches the engine and tender from the freight cars to {{distract}} Shack further. Shack yells at A-No.-1 in his hiding place in the woods that this prank might cost 10 lives when the fast mail train comes through in just a few minutes. A-No.-1 dismisses this as merely [...] "a ghost story." [...] Hogger (the engineer) and Coaly (the stoker) desperately get the train going again, and they barely succeed in getting it onto a siding, narrowly avoiding a catastrophic collision with the mail train.|$|R
50|$|On the 21st {{the rebel}} {{batteries}} were very annoying. Lieutenant Gregory {{and two men}} were wounded by a tree top falling on them, which had been cut off by a solid shot. At dark 6f the twenty-second the command was relieved by the Eighteenth Regulars. They at once moved by the right flank three miles, and halted at daylight. The Eighty-Fourth, with other regiments, was now <b>sent</b> <b>on</b> the front <b>line,</b> to relieve {{a portion of the}} Twentieth Corps. The regiment held the center of the brigade line; sending out skirmishers. In the afternoon, orders were given the Eighty-Fourth to reinforce the skirmish line with three companies, preparatory to making a charge. The rebel line was near the summit of a hill, beyond a small wheat field. The signal was given, and amid a perfect storm of bullets, the Eighty-Fourth rushed across the wheat field, up the hill, capturing, <b>on</b> the skirmish <b>line,</b> thirty-seven prisoners, and penetrating within thirty paces of the main line of the enemy. The timber and thick underbrush through which they advanced, prevented the enemy from discovering their numbers, and protected them from his fire. They held the position one hour and a half, keeping up a brisk fire on the enemy. Meantime the rebels, learning that their right flank was unprotected, massed for an assault, and drove them back to their main line. The loss of the regiment in this affair was five killed, twenty-five wounded, and eleven prisoners. The regiment fortified during the night, and remained <b>on</b> the front <b>line.</b> One man was killed and one wounded on the 24th. Lieutenant Burres and one man were wounded on the 26th. At daylight on the 27th they were relieved by the Fourteenth Corps, and retired to the rear and left, where they were held in reserve during the unsuccessful charge which followed, upon the enemy's position on Kenesaw Mountain. That terrible and fatal assault is familiar to readers of military history. The position was soon afterwards turned by a flank movement, and the rebels evacuated in the night The Eighty-Fourth joined in the pursuit, and early on the morning of July 4 they were again drawn up in line of battle, and advanced nearly a mile, when the rebels were found in force behind a line of works. The regiment was again <b>sent</b> <b>on</b> the skirmish <b>line,</b> where they lost one man killed and four wounded. During the following night the enemy abandoned the works, and were pursued to Vining's Station, on the Chattahoochee, where the Eighty-Fourth went into camp.|$|R
40|$|FPGA (Field Programmable gate Array) {{devices are}} one of the modern {{technologies}} that are changing the electronic industry. They are riding the same integrated circuit process curves as processors and memories and keep getting larger, faster, and cheaper and are now common in low and mid volume embedded products With the advances of FPGA technology, many engineers now have the opportunity to do medium scale digital design. They can be found in primary and secondary surveillance radar, satellite communication, automotive, manufacturing, and many other types of products. Time triggered communication within FPGA is enhanced with the help of UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter). It translates between serial and parallel bits of data. The device changes incoming parallel information to serial data which can be <b>sent</b> <b>on</b> a communication <b>line.</b> A second UART can be used to receive the information. The UART performs all the tasks, timing, parity checking, etc. needed for the communication. UART is designed in VHDL.

50|$|On the 28th {{the line}} of march was taken up at eight o'clock p.m. The advance of the brigade were {{continually}} skirmishing with the enemy until evening, when they were considerably advanced, and built a line of works, while the bullets were whistling about their ears. But one man was killed, however. Next morning they moved to the right, and relieved the Ninety-Sixth Illinois, throwing up another line of works. Five companies of the Eighty-Fourth were <b>sent</b> <b>on</b> the skirmish <b>line,</b> where they remained until dark, when they were relieved by the Twenty-First Kentucky, and retired to their line of works. The enemy evacuated and fell back to Atlanta during the night. Our forces advanced in pursuit, but had not pursued them more than one {{mile and a half}} when they came upon their outer line of works. The regiment went into position about noon, on the left of the front line of the brigade, and threw up a line of bomb-proof entrenchment. They remained in these works until the night of the 26th, continually skirmishing with the enemy, when they were sent back with the brigade about three miles, and occupied a line of works previously built by the rebels. On the morning of the 27th they were placed in position on the extreme left of the entire line, in the immediate vicinity of Atlanta, where they built still another line of works, with abattis in front. Here they pitched tents and remained until the night of August 1, when they moved to the right a short distance, and relieved a portion of the Twenty-Third Corps. Here they remained until the sixteenth, continually skirmishing, and occasionally making a feint <b>on</b> their <b>lines,</b> losing one man killed, instantly, and several severely wounded. Captain J. M. Taylor was slightly wounded in the arm.|$|R

60|$|Next {{morning we}} started for Llangollen, Conway, Bangor, and Capel Curig. This tour was of decided use in {{teaching}} {{me a little}} how {{to make out the}} geology of a country. Sedgwick often <b>sent</b> me <b>on</b> a <b>line</b> parallel to his, telling me to bring back specimens of the rocks and to mark the stratification on a map. I have little doubt that he did this for my good, as I was too ignorant to have aided him. On this tour I had a striking instance of {{how easy it is to}} overlook phenomena, however conspicuous, before they have been observed by any one. We spent many hours in Cwm Idwal, examining all the rocks with extreme care, as Sedgwick was anxious to find fossils in them; but neither of us saw a trace of the wonderful glacial phenomena all around us; we did not notice the plainly scored rocks, the perched boulders, the lateral and terminal moraines. Yet these phenomena are so conspicuous that, as I declared in a paper published many years afterwards in the 'Philosophical Magazine' ('Philosophical Magazine,' 1842.), a house burnt down by fire did not tell its story more plainly than did this valley. If it had still been filled by a glacier, the phenomena would have been less distinct than they now are.|$|R
