40|$|ABSTRACT: A {{combination}} of radiosonde, wind-profiler and aircraft observations, together with large-eddy modelling, show that shading from orphaned cirrus anvils had significant {{effects on the}} boundary layer during CSIP IOP 5. The control of boundary-layer development by the cirrus shading, and the subsidence induced by the cirrus cover, led to a boundary layer that, at an aircraft altitude of around 500 m, was less turbulent, 0. 8 g kg− 1 drier and 0. 3 K warmer under thick cirrus than in clear skies. In addition, {{at the top of}} the boundary layer, turbulence persisted for some time after the onset of cirrus shading, allowing continued entrainment and so stabilization of the previously well-mixed boundary layer. These effects, which would have inhibited convective initiation under the cirrus, are consistent with the results of the first part of this study (Marsham et al., 2007). Power spectra show that, while vertical velocities were dominated by variations on the <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> the boundary-layer depth, for water-vapour mixing ratios and potential temperatures, mesoscale variations were comparable or dominant. In some cases a spectral gap is observed between these two <b>scales</b> <b>of</b> <b>contributions.</b> Radiosonde data and modelling show that, in addition to the variations in the boundary layer caused by the variable cirrus cover, pre-existing variations in lid strength and boundary-layer moisture were also significant on this day. These water-vapour variations are also detectable in retrievals of total-column water vapour from Global-Positioning-System data. Copyright 2007 Royal Meteorologica...|$|R
40|$|Hyperosmotic {{stress is}} the {{increase}} in whole extracellular solute concentration in cell causing many disruption {{that may lead to}} the physiological disease conditions such as diabetes and hypertension. In order to protect itself cells generated an osmotic stress adaptive mechanism in which intracellular inorganic ion homeostasis is restored by mainly activating NFAT 5 (TonEBP) and in return it transactivates the target genes or interact with specific regulatory proteins. NFAT 5 and p 65 have been previously shown to interact at IκB α promoter for regulation of NFκB pathway. In addition to the interaction between NFAT 5 and p 65, it has been also shown that SIRT 1 deacetylates p 65 and inhibits its nuclear translocation. However, there is no such study that examines the expression profile of SIRT 1, NFAT 5 and p 65 all together under hyperosmotic stress in U 937 cells. Therefore, the aim {{of this study is to}} investigate the role of SIRT 1 activity on NFAT 5 and p 65 expression profile under 100 mM NaCl induced hyperosmotic stress in U 937 monocyte cells. In addition, the aim concerns to understand the <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> <b>contribution</b> <b>of</b> NFAT 5 and p 65 on NFκB pathway regulation for the cell survival/death under hyperosmotic stress through examining IκB α expression profile. 100 mM NaCl induced hyperosmotic stress in U 937 monocyte cells indicated high expression levels of NFAT 5 and SIRT 1 overlapping with the activation of NFκB pathway. It is shown that in U 937 cells under 100 mM NaCl induced hyperosmotic stress, the activation of NFκB pathway and its regulation may be independent of NFAT 5 but highly dependent on translocated p 65, and SIRT 1 activity may control p 65 nuclear translocation, hence NFκB pathway activation...|$|R
