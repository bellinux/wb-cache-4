A label printer with built-in keyboard and display for stand-alone use (not connected to a separate computer) is often called a label maker.

Acrylic self-adhesive polymers are nowadays synthesized from a wide selection of acrylic ester monomers, often with low levels of monomers having pendant functional groups.

50|$|Flexo has an {{advantage}} over lithography in that it can use {{a wider range of}} inks, water based rather than oil based inks, and is good at printing on a variety of different materials like plastic, foil, acetate film, brown paper, and other materials used in packaging. Typical products printed using flexography include brown corrugated boxes, flexible packaging including retail and shopping bags, food and hygiene bags and sacks, milk and beverage cartons, flexible plastics, <b>self-adhesive</b> <b>labels,</b> disposable cups and containers, envelopes and wallpaper. In recent years there has also been a move towards laminates, where two or more materials are bonded together to produce new material with different properties than either of the originals. A number of newspapers now eschew the more common offset lithography process in favour of flexo. Flexographic inks, like those used in gravure and unlike those used in lithography, generally have a low viscosity. This enables faster drying and, as a result, faster production, which results in lower costs.|$|E

40|$|Magistrska naloga obravnava področje reprodukcije zlate barve na vinskih etiketah. Glede na to, da je vinska etiketa obraz vina, je v etiketni industriji pomemben tako oblikovni kot tehnološki vidik grafike. Predvsem pa je v nasičenem trgu pomembna dodana vrednost etikete, ki jo lahko dosežemo z zlato barvo. Primerjali smo kakovost treh tehnologij za reproduciranje zlate barve na samolepilni etiketni papir v zvitku, in sicer klasični vroči zlatotisk ter alternativni tehnologiji, to sta digitalni tisk (elektrofotografija) ter sitotisk. Ugotavljali smo, katera izmed tehnologij omogoča kakovostnejše odtise in je racionalnejša. Na površinsko neobdelanih odtisih testne forme smo izvedli analizo tiskovnega materiala in analizo odtisov. Analiza tiskovnega materiala je pokazala dobro pregibno odpornost uporabljenih etiketnih papirjev in minimalno hrapavost. Analiza odtisov pa je glede na izvedene teste pokazala različne rezultate. Vizualna ocena in slikovna analiza sta pokazali najboljše rezultate pri odtisih, upodobljenih z vročim zlatotiskom in elektrofotografijo. Pri meritvah adhezivnosti in abrazivnosti odtisov se je najbolje izkazal odtis, upodobljen s tehnologijo sitotiska. Po izpostavljenosti odtisov na alkohol je očitna degradacija samo na odtisu, upodobljenim z vročim zlatotiskom. Manjšo deformacijo odtisov pa sta povzročila tudi {{detergent}} in voda, medtem ko olje ni povzročilo očitnih sprememb na odtisih. Ugotovili smo, da je na umetno staranje najmanj odporen odtis, upodobljen s sitotiskom. Globoko zamrzovanje pa je največje spremembe povzročilo na odtisu, upodobljenim z vročim zlatotiskom. Vsi vzorci imajo dobro svetlobno obstojnost. Iz rezultatov meritev smo ugotovili, da lahko digitalna tehnologija vsekakor konkurira vročemu zlatemu tisku pri reprodukciji zlate barve na vinske etikete. Na koncu praktičnega dela smo oblikovali kolekcijo vinskih etiket z zlatimi in srebnimi elementi. Etiketo smo odtisnili z digitalno tehnologijo (elektofotografija). Tisk nam je omogočil tiskalnik Xeikon 3030. Tiskali smo na metaliziran etiketni papir SilverVac. The master 2 ̆ 7 s thesis {{deals with}} the field of reproduction of a golden colour on wine labels. Considering {{the fact that the}} wine label is the face of the wine, the design and the technical aspect of the graphic is important in the labelling industry. Above all, in the saturated market, the added value of the label is important, which can be achieved with a golden colour. We compared the quality of the three technologies for the reproduction of a golden colour on <b>self-adhesive</b> <b>label</b> paper in rolls: classic hot foil stamping and alternative technologies such as digital printing (electrophotography) and screen printing. We have examined which of the technologies enables better quality imprints and is more rational. We analysed the printing material and the imprints on the surface of raw and untreated imprints of the test form. The analysis of the printing material showed good flexural resistance of the used labels and minimal roughness. The analysis of the imprints showed different results according to the tests carried out. Visual evaluation and image analysis showed the best results in the imprints made with hot foil stamping and electrophotography. In the adhesiveness and abrasiveness measurements of the imprints, the imprint illustrated with screen printing technology was the best. After being exposed to alcohol, the obvious degradation is only on the imprint made with hot foil stamping. Minor deformation of the imprints was also caused by detergent and water, while oil did not cause obvious changes. We have found out that the least resistant to artificial aging is imprint made with screen printing. Deep freezing, however, caused the biggest changes on the imprint made with hot foil stamping. All samples have good light resistance. The results showed that digital technology can certainly compete with the hot foil stamping when reproducing a golden colour on wine labels. At the end of the practical work we created a collection of wine labels with golden and silver elements. The label was printed with digital technology (electrophotography). The print was enabled by the Xeikon 3030 printer. We printed on the metallised label paper SilverVac...|$|R
50|$|Rotary {{letterpress}} {{machines are}} still {{used on a}} wide scale for printing <b>self-adhesive</b> and non-self-adhesive <b>labels,</b> tube laminate, cup stock, etc. The printing quality achieved by a modern letterpress machine with UV curing is on par with flexo presses. It is more convenient and user friendly than a flexo press. It uses water-wash photopolymer plates, which {{are as good as}} any solvent-washed flexo plate. Today even CtP (computer-to-plate) plates are available making it a full-fledged, modern printing process. Because there is no anilox roller in the process, the make-ready time also goes down when compared to a flexo press. Inking is controlled by keys very much similar to an offset press. UV inks for letterpress are in paste form, unlike flexo. Various manufacturers produce UV rotary letterpress machines, viz. Dashen, Nickel, Taiyo Kikai, KoPack, Gallus, etc. - and offer hot/cold foil stamping, rotary die cutting, flatbed die cutting, sheeting, rotary screen printing, adhesive side printing, and inkjet numbering. Central impression presses are more popular than inline presses due to their ease of registration and simple design. Printing of up to nine colours plus varnish is possible with various online converting processes.|$|R
40|$|Issue: Historically, label {{adhesives}} used by bottlers {{were designed}} for easy removal so that bottlers could recover their own bottles through local buy-back programs and wash the containers for re-use. With most bottle-washing programs discontinued, {{and in response to}} marketing and operational considerations, many have converted to more convenient and durable label adhesives. These adhesives, which include press-applied and plastic labels, pose a major barrier to successful bottle washing because they do not readily come off in the caustic baths used in bottle washing machines. Best Practice: Several strategies may help to mitigate the problems associated with more durable label adhesives. The best way is to convince bottlers to use washing-friendly labels. This should be part of an overall marketing plan for the bottle-washing program (see Elements of a Bottle-Washing Program Best Practice). Second, understanding the fundamental technology of label adhesives makes it possible to develop strategies for resolving difficulties with durable label adhesives. There are several primary glue types, including wet glues, high release dry glues, and press-applied adhesives (i. e., <b>self-adhesive</b> <b>labels).</b> Wet glues are water-based, and easily release in hot caustic solutions. Press-applied labels, however, are more durable and may actually strengthen their bonds in response to heat, preventing them from releasing when washed.
