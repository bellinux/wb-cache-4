5|$|The True Cost is a 2015 {{documentary}} film directed by Andrew Morgan {{that focuses on}} fast fashion. It discusses several aspects of the garment industry from production—mainly exploring the life of low-wage workers in developing countries—to its after-effects such as river and soil pollution, pesticide contamination, disease and death. Using an approach that looks at environmental, <b>social</b> <b>and</b> <b>psychological</b> aspects, it also examines consumerism and mass media, ultimately linking them to global capitalism. The documentary is a collage of several interviews with environmentalists, garment workers, factory owners, and people organizing fair trade companies or promoting sustainable clothing production.|$|E
25|$|Generally speaking, women {{raised in}} the Western world or {{developed}} countries in Asia live long enough so {{that a third of}} their life is spent in post-menopause.

Although the significance of the changes that surround menarche is fairly well recognized, in countries such as the United States, the <b>social</b> <b>and</b> <b>psychological</b> ramifications of the menopause transition are frequently ignored or underestimated.|$|E

In doing so, she draws on sociology, anthropology, and psychology, leading some critics to categorize her work as soft science fiction. She has objected to this classification of her writing, arguing the term is divisive and implies a narrow view of what constitutes valid science fiction. There are also the underlying ideas of anarchism and environmentalism that make repeated appearances throughout Le Guin's work.|$|E
25|$|In 1792 Pinel {{became the}} chief {{physician}} at the Bicêtre Hospital. Before his arrival, inmates were chained in cramped cell-like rooms {{where there was}} poor ventilation, led {{by a man named}} Jackson 'Brutis' Taylor. Jackson was then killed by the inmates leading to Pinel's leadership. In 1797, Pussin first freed patients of their chains and banned physical punishment, although straitjackets could be used instead. Patients were allowed to move freely about the hospital grounds, and eventually dark dungeons were replaced with sunny, well-ventilated rooms. He argued that mental illness was the result of excessive exposure to <b>social</b> <b>and</b> <b>psychological</b> stresses, to heredity and physiological damage.|$|E
25|$|Systematic {{research}} on individuals in such environments {{has been conducted}} since the 1980s.

Outside of the U.S. {{there is no significant}} literature on the effects of growing up as a military dependent. Since the Department of Defense does not track or monitor former brats, any study on adult brats is based upon self-identification. Thus, even though the studies are performed using scientific sampling methods, they may contain bias because of the difficulty in conducting epidemiological studies across broad-based population samples. Some researchers used referrals, the Internet, and newspaper articles to identify military brats.|$|E

25|$|One major {{criticism}} of <b>social</b> <b>and</b> <b>psychological</b> explanations of smoking in schizophrenia {{is that most}} studies have failed to include personal perspectives of patients with schizophrenia. Studies including personal perspectives find that people with schizophrenia generally start smoking {{for the same reasons}} as the general population, including social pressures and cultural and socioeconomic factors. People with schizophrenia who are current smokers also cite similar reasons for smoking as people without schizophrenia, primarily relaxation, force of habit, and settling nerves. However, 28% cite psychiatric issues, including response to auditory hallucinations and reducing the side effects of medication. The major themes found in studies of personal perspectives are habit and routine, socialization, relaxation, and addiction to nicotine. It is argued that smoking provides structure and activity, both of which may be lacking in the lives of those with serious mental illness.|$|E
25|$|It {{has long}} been {{established}} that genetic factors along with <b>social</b> <b>and</b> <b>psychological</b> factors are contributors to addiction. A common theory along these lines is the self-medication hypothesis. Epidemiological studies estimate that genetic factors account for 40–60% of the risk factors for alcoholism. Similar rates of heritability for other types of drug addiction have been indicated by other studies. Knestler hypothesized in 1964 that a gene or group of genes might contribute to predisposition to addiction in several ways. For example, altered levels of a normal protein due to environmental factors could then change the structure or functioning of specific brain neurons during development. These altered brain neurons could change the susceptibility of an individual to an initial drug use experience. In support of this hypothesis, animal {{studies have shown that}} environmental factors such as stress can affect an animal's genotype.|$|E

Near {{the end of that}} month, after one of these trips Butler told the hospital that she (Butler) might have contracted rubella, to which Genie would have been exposed. Hospital staff were reluctant to give foster custody to Butler and were very skeptical of her story, strongly suspecting she had concocted it as part of a bid to take over as Genie's guardian and primary caretaker, but decided that placing Genie in an isolation ward at the hospital could potentially be highly damaging to her <b>social</b> <b>and</b> <b>psychological</b> development, so they agreed to temporarily quarantine her in Butler's home. Butler, who was childless, unmarried, and at the time living alone, subsequently petitioned for foster custody of Genie, and despite the hospital's objections authorities extended Genie's stay while they considered the matter.|$|E

The two studies utilized the same data - the 2001 IHIS - including 11, 483 intramarried persons and 1, 392 intermarried persons. Generalized linear models were used for analyses. Study 1 found that interracial married persons were likely to have less potential social capital than intramarried persons. Study 2 found that the association between potential <b>social</b> capital <b>and</b> <b>psychological</b> distress was stronger for interracial married persons and intermarried persons with non-White spouse than for intramarried persons. The association was weaker for intermarried persons with White spouse than for intramarried persons.

40|$|Abstract The {{death of}} spouse brings {{major changes in the}} life of the wife/husband that may affect their {{psychological}} well-being. To maintain their psychological well-being within an optimum level, elderly will seek sources of social support in their lives. This study aims to test the correlation between perceived <b>social</b> support <b>and</b> <b>psychological</b> well-being in elderly and to investigate gender differences in perceived <b>social</b> support <b>and</b> <b>psychological</b> well-being. This study comprised 112 elderly (78 widowers; 34 widows), members of the Healthy Elderly Community of the Indonesian Red Cross, Semarang City. Data were collected using the Perceived Social Support Scale (32 items; α = 0. 97) <b>and</b> <b>Psychological</b> Well-being Scale (33 items; α = 0. 92). Simple regression analysis was applied to test the correlation between two variables and student t-test was used to compare data from male and female groups. The results revealed a positive and significant correlation between perceived <b>social</b> support <b>and</b> <b>psychological</b> well-being in elderly (r = 0. 739; p < 0. 001). Perceived social support explained 54. 6 % of the psychological well-being. T-test revealed gender differences in perceived <b>social</b> support <b>and</b> <b>psychological</b> well-being in elderly. The widows perceived social support better than the widowers (t(35) = 3. 594; p < 0. 001), the widows also showed higher psychological well-being than the widowers (t(42) = 2. 944; p= 0. 004) ...|$|R
