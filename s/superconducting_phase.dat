25|$|The {{order of}} the <b>superconducting</b> <b>phase</b> {{transition}} was long a matter of debate. Experiments indicate that the transition is second-order, meaning there is no latent heat. However, {{in the presence of}} an external magnetic field there is latent heat, because the <b>superconducting</b> <b>phase</b> has a lower entropy below the critical temperature than the normal phase. It has been experimentally demonstrated that, as a consequence, when the magnetic field is increased beyond the critical field, the resulting phase transition leads to a decrease in the temperature of the superconducting material.|$|E
25|$|Similarly, {{at a fixed}} {{temperature}} {{below the}} critical temperature, superconducting materials cease to superconduct when an external magnetic field is applied which {{is greater than the}} critical magnetic field. This is because the Gibbs free energy of the <b>superconducting</b> <b>phase</b> increases quadratically with the magnetic field while the free energy of the normal phase is roughly independent of the magnetic field. If the material superconducts {{in the absence of a}} field, then the <b>superconducting</b> <b>phase</b> free energy is lower than that of the normal phase and so for some finite value of the magnetic field (proportional to the square root of the difference of the free energies at zero magnetic field) the two free energies will be equal and a phase transition to the normal phase will occur. More generally, a higher temperature and a stronger magnetic field lead to a smaller fraction of the electrons in the superconducting band and consequently a longer London penetration depth of external magnetic fields and currents. The penetration depth becomes infinite at the phase transition.|$|E

It is suggested that bound states of radially oscillating charged particles with oppositely oriented spins – the analogue of Cooper pairs – can appear inside a ball lightning.

40|$|We {{construct}} a holographic multi-band superconductor model with each complex scalar {{field in the}} bulk minimally coupled to a same gauge field.

After milling in a Fritsch mill, the samples were compressed in a hydraulic uniaxial press and encapsulated in evacuated quartz tubes for heat treatment. The compressed and heat treated samples were characterized using X-ray diffractometry. Microstructure and chemical analysis were accomplished using scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive spectrometry. Nb(3) Al XRD peaks were observed after the sintering at 800 degrees C for the sample milled for 30 h. Nb(3) Sn XRD peaks could be observed even before the heat treatment. (C) 2009 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Abstract. We {{address the}} phase {{structure}} of color superconducting quark matter at high quark density. Under the electric and color neutrality conditions there appear various phases {{as a result}} of the Fermi surface mismatch among different quark flavors induced by finite strange quark mass; the color-flavor locked (CFL) phase where quarks are all energy gapped, the u-quark <b>superconducting</b> (uSC) <b>phase</b> where u-quarks are paired with either d- or s-quarks, the d-quark <b>superconducting</b> (dSC) <b>phase</b> that is the d-quark analogue of the uSC <b>phase,</b> the two-flavor <b>superconducting</b> (2 SC) <b>phase</b> where u- and d-quarks are paired, and the unpaired quark matter (UQM) that is normal quark matter without pairing. Besides these possibilities, when the Fermi surface mismatch is large enough to surpass the gap energy, the gapless <b>superconducting</b> <b>phases</b> are expected. We focus our discussion on the chromomagnetic instability problem related to the gapless CFL (gCFL) onset and explore the instability regions on the phase diagram as a function of the temperature and the quark chemical potential. We sketch how to reach stable physical states inside the instability regions. PACS. 12. 38. -t Quantum chromodynamics – 12. 38.
