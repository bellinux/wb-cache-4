50|$|The marsh is geologically {{relatively}} new, {{the oldest}} parts date back about 10,000 years. Ever since {{the formation of}} the harbour, when the lower valleys of the rivers Avon and Stour were flooded by a post-glacial rise in sea level; the two rivers have been depositing their sediment in the shallow waters. During periods of low tide, channels and creeks began to appear and the isolated banks of silt became colonised by plants such as Glassworts, <b>Sea</b> <b>Purslane</b> and Seablite all of which have a high tolerance to salt water. These plants caused the flow of water to decrease further and thus more sediment was deposited. Eventually the mud banks grew above the high tide level and other vegetation was able to develop.|$|E

50|$|In a psammosere, {{the organisms}} {{closest to the}} sea will be pioneer species: salt-tolerant species such as {{littoral}} algae and glasswort with marram grass stabilising the dunes. Progressing inland many characteristic features change and help determine the natural succession of the dunes. For instance, the drainage slows down as the land becomes more compact and has better soils, and the pH drops as the proportion of seashell fragments reduces {{and the amount of}} humus increases. <b>Sea</b> <b>purslane,</b> sea lavender, meadow grass and heather eventually grade into a typical non-maritime terrestrial eco-system. The first trees (or pioneer trees) that appear are typically fast-growing trees such as birch, willow or rowan. In turn these will be replaced by slow-growing, larger trees such as ash and oak. This is the climax community, defined as the point where a plant succession does not develop any further because it has reached equilibrium with the environment, in particular the climate.|$|E
40|$|The {{stability}} of cohesive sediments of a saltmarsh in Southern England {{was measured in}} the field and the laboratory using a Cohesive Strength Meter (CSM) and a shear vane apparatus. Cores and sediment samples were collected from two tidal creek banks, covered by Atriplex portulacoides (<b>Sea</b> <b>Purslane)</b> and Juncus maritimus (Sea Rush), respectively. The objectives of the study were to examine the variation of sediment stability throughout banks with cantilevers present and investigate the influence of roots and downcore consolidation on bank stability. Data on erosion threshold and shear strength were interpreted with reference to bank depth, sediment properties and biological influences. The higher average erosion threshold was from the <b>Sea</b> <b>Purslane</b> bank whilst the Sea Rush bank showed higher average vane shear strength. The vertical variation in core sediment stability was mainly affected by roots and downcore consolidation with depth. The data obtained from the bank faces revealed that vertical variations in both erosion threshold and vane shear strength were affected primarily by roots and algae. A quantitative estimate of the relative contributions of roots and downcore consolidation to bank sediment stability was undertaken using the bank stability data and sediment density data. This showed that roots contributed more to the <b>Sea</b> <b>Purslane</b> bank stability than downcore consolidation, whilst downcore consolidation has more pronounced effects on the Sea Rush bank stability...|$|E

40|$|Freshwater {{shortages}} {{are increasingly}} limiting both irrigated and rainfed agriculture. To expand possibilities for controlled plant production without using land nor freshwater, we cultivated potted halophytes floating at sea that {{were provided with}} rain- and seawater. Plantlets of two mangroves (Avicennia germinans and Rhizophora mangle) and plants of two herbaceous species, <b>sea</b> <b>purslane</b> (Sesuvium portulacastrum) and salt couch grass (Sporobolus virginicus) were grown in near-coastal tropical Pacific waters of Costa Rica for 733  days. There were a total of 504 rainless days, including two dry periods of ca. 150 d long each, evidencing prolonged and exclusive reliance on seawater. Pots with a sandy soil mixture and the transplanted plants were placed on low-cost wooden floating rafts with their lower end perforated and immersed for capillary rise of water. Free seawater entry and exit through the bottom from bobbing with waves, which also occasionally added water from the top, effectively controlled soil salinity build-up even during the rainless seasons. Continuous leaching made necessary frequent fertilizer addition. No water deficit symptoms were observed and midday canopy temperature during rainless periods was not significantly different between species or from air temperature. With all-year-round growth, height increase of mangrove plantlets ranged from 208. 1 to 401. 5  mm yr− 1. Fresh biomass production of <b>sea</b> <b>purslane</b> and the grass was 10. 9 and 3. 0  kg m− 2 yr− 1 respectively. High yield, edibility and protein content of 10. 2 % dry weight established <b>sea</b> <b>purslane</b> as a potential crop.
