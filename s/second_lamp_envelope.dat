The optimum condition was hot-pressing between 1850 °C to 1920 °C for 3 ~ 5 h under 35 MPa. We got transparent samples Φ 70 × 3 mm with in-line transmittance above 70 % {{in the range}} from the visible to infrared wavelength. The effect of additive contents on transparency and the relation of microstructure and transparency have been discussed in this paper. The transmittance is good when the Y 2 O 3 sintering additive content is 1. 5 wt%. The sample density is about 99 % of its theoretical density. We also measured the flexural strength, elastic modulus and other mechanical properties of ALON. Cubic γ-ALON has attracted much attention due to its unique combination of optical, dielectric and mechanical properties.

50|$|The {{power level}} of the lamps is rated in watts/area, total {{electrical}} input power divided by the lamp's inner wall surface. Cooling of the electrodes and the <b>lamp</b> <b>envelope</b> is of high importance at high power levels. Air cooling is sufficient for lower average power levels. High power lamps are cooled with a liquid, typically by flowing demineralized water through a tube in which the lamp is encased. Water-cooled lamps will generally have the glass shrunk around the electrodes, to provide a direct thermal conductor {{between them and the}} cooling water. The cooling medium should flow also across {{the entire length of the}} lamp and electrodes. High average power or continuous-wave arc lamps must have the water flow across the ends of the lamp, and across the exposed ends of the electrodes as well, so the deionized water is used to prevent a short circuit. Above 15 W/cm2 forced air cooling is required; liquid cooling if in a confined space. Liquid cooling is generally necessary above 30 W/cm2.|$|R

This {{study was designed to}} evaluate the aging of MP UV lamps utilized with a closed-vessel UV reactor technology for drinking water disinfection applications. Beginning in May 2002, measurements of MP UV lamps were recorded to track the total UV output, the germicidal output and the spectral wavelength distribution of four lamps under normal operating conditions. Of the four lamps, one aged to its end-of-life output (dropping below 70 % efficiency) at 6, 600 hours. The <b>second</b> <b>lamp</b> reached its end of lamp life at 13, 600 hours. Two lamps lasted the full span of testing (16, 500 h), ending at 68 % and 71 % efficiency. These data show that MP lamps are capable of lasting well beyond their guaranteed 4, 000 hour lifetime. No appreciable changes in the spectral wavelength distribution could be discerned until the efficiency dropped below approximately 70 %. These results demonstrate that appropriate use of sensor readings are essential for tracking lamp aging and with these readings, it may be unnecessary to presume a lamp’s lifetime or to constantly track a lamp’s spectral characteristics...|$|R

The envelope analysis of the CCFL, which was verified experimentally, revealed that the magnitude of the negative EI decreases with temperature. This might cause the system to become unstable at low temperatures {{due to the fact that}} the loop gain of the PT–CCFL system encircled the (1, 0) point in the Nyquist plane. In such cases, the PT–CCFL system may enter a quasi-stable oscillatory operation mode in which the current is AM modulated by a low frequency parasitic signal. This phenomenon is analyzed and explained by considering the temperature effect on the EI of the CCFL.

The detector {{is based on}} project “muon detector” presented on website www. astroparticelle. it. The idea is to use 2 fluorescent tube lamps. When a muon hits the detector, it ionizes some atoms of gas of the lamp. Putting an electric tension (order of 1 kV) outside the tube with electrodes spaced 10 cm each other, the ionized atom goes toward one electrode. If ionized atom hit glass produces lamp, as internal surface of these lamps are coated with fluorescent powder. First step is looking lamp with human eyes. Second step: we would automatize muons detection. To observe lamps we put a light sensor for each sector of the detector (the sections are 5 for each tube).
