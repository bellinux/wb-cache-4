5000|$|A 2010 {{study by}} the University of Exeter into the meaning of {{contemporary}} Cornish identity across Cornwall {{found that there was}} a [...] "west-east distance decay in the strength of the Cornish identity." [...] The study was conducted amongst the farming community as they were deemed to be the <b>socio-professional</b> <b>group</b> most objectively representative of Cornishness. All participants categorised themselves as Cornish and identified Cornish as their primary ethnic group orientation. Those in the west primarily thought of themselves as Cornish and British/Celtic, while those in the east tended {{to think of themselves as}} Cornish and English. All participants in West Cornwall who identified as Cornish and not English described people in East Cornwall, without hesitation, as equally Cornish as themselves. Those who identified as Cornish and English stressed the primacy of their Cornishness and a capacity to distance themselves from their Englishness. Ancestry was seen as the most important criterion for being categorised as Cornish, above place of birth or growing up in Cornwall. This study supports a 1988 study by Mary McArthur that had found that the meanings of Cornishness varied substantially, from local to national identity. Both studies also observed that the Cornish were less materialistic than the English. The Cornish generally saw the English, or city people, as being [...] "less friendly and more aggressively self-promoting and insensitive." [...] The Cornish saw themselves as friendly, welcoming and caring.|$|E

40|$|It is {{the aim of}} {{this article}} to {{contribute}} to reflection on relations among education, work and professional identities {{based on the results of}} a study carried out under the scope of a doctoral thesis. The study examined the influence of the school institution on the production and transformation of the professional identity of Cardio-Pneumology technicians according to socialization processes in both academic and professional entities as well as professionalization processes and projects, the vectors of transformation and identity recomposition. Cardio-Pneumology technicians are the empirical reference of this analysis. They form a <b>socio-professional</b> <b>group</b> with a diagnostic and therapeutic technical career which, over the last decade, has undergone significant transformations. Exploration of the specificity of this empirical field has made it possible to confirm some of the more dominant principles set out in the studies on this theme and to reveal differences regarding the processes of other socio-professional groups. The case in question highlights an identity construction process which is highly influenced by the academic institution, not so much as a result of its action as a socialization entity which has a different impact to other groups of reference in the health sector with its more accentuated “ideological” training model, but mainly due to its action in professionalization processes and projects, owing to the strategic guidelines defined for education, which are reflected in the restructuring of professional knowledge and the role played in the institutionalization and legitimation of the knowledge of this <b>socio-professional</b> <b>group...</b>|$|E
40|$|This book {{focuses on}} {{one part of}} the {{judicial}} system: the criminal justice chain. This involves all the activities and actors dealing with policing, prosecution, judgment, and sanctioning of crimes. In the last decades, reforms have been implemented in several European countries. In Belgium for example, there was the so-called Octopus reform in 1998. The police was restructured leading to an integration of the police forces on a national and local level. New steering instruments were introduced, such as regional security plans. With regard to the sanctioning of crimes, a new institution was installed, called the sentence implementation court. This book evaluates these reforms and discusses the current reform on the reorganisation of the judicial landscape. In addition, it examines the relation between trust and distrust and the application to the judicial system. It discusses the human capital aspect of the system, by means of a study on the proposography of the Belgian magistrates that analyses the Magistracy as <b>socio-professional</b> <b>group,</b> and focuses on situations of system building, transformations under constraint (occupation) and transfers (colonial experience). Lastly, the book presents a comparative study of Belgium and France regarding the new techniques and instruments that are needed to accelerate the judicial response time and to ensure that the judicial system delivers its services on time. nrpages: XVIII, 275 status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|This work is {{centred on}} the {{dynamics}} of identity and professional development of two socio-professional groups; namely, Social Assistants and Mediators. It takes as its point of departure the characterisation of these <b>socio-professional</b> <b>groups</b> and their professionalization. The professionalization of the social groups matches {{the dynamics of}} identity development and presupposes social recognition of their professional knowledge and competences that are built in situations of real work and professional socialization (Dubar, 1997; Wittorski, 2008). Schön's (1996) "epistemology of professional practice" is paramount in this context, as theoretical knowledge and learning developed in formal training settings are insufficient for their professional daily work. The study of a qualitative nature was carried out using case studies in four countries - two in Europe and two in Latin America – Portugal, France, Brazil and Argentina. It had as its principal objectives the identification {{and analysis of the}} dynamics of identity and their articulation with the construction of professional knowledge in two <b>socio-professional</b> <b>groups,</b> which {{have been the subject of}} an increasing social visibility. The research strategies that we favoured were phenomenological and ethno-methodological, which turned out to be the two fundamental techniques for collecting information; namely, documentary research and biographical interviews. This methodology allowed us access to the socio-historical processes and subjective experiences of the participants with respect to their dynamics of professionalisation and in this way we could understand better the continuities and/or gaps in the processes in relation to their construction of identity. In order to analyse the data collected we turned to the emerging characterisations, a structural analysis of discourses and continuous comparison, when searching for evidence in the construction of the interpretative text. As the principal results of the study, we would stress the singularity of each one of these <b>socio-professional</b> <b>groups</b> taking into account their origins, their socio-historical processes and the theoretical and ethical assumptions that have structured their identities. Taking, as a reference, the geographical and cultural variable, it was not possible to find any significant differences in or between any of the groups, which indicates a consistent specific and cross-disciplinary professional ethos. Also evident was the particularity and relevance of professional knowledge in the assertion and professional development of both the Social Assistants and the Mediators.

The conclusions are based on an empirical study carried out in five macro-architectural practices 1 in London City {{through the use of a}} focused cognitive questionnaire handed out in situ. The analysis shows that unconscious and continuous use of metaphors when referring to the basic categories of building and city constitute a powerful basis for communication at work, transmitting concepts and ideas according to a common cognitive map.

40|$|The {{population}} {{engaged in}} the individual farming {{was included in the}} system social security as the last <b>socio-professional</b> <b>group.</b> The Act of Pensionary Rights of Individual Farmers handing over their farms to State ownership or management of June 28, 1962 became an important event. But the exhaustive regulation of the social security was instituted by the Act of Social Security for Farmers and their Families of December 14, 1982. Ensuring the social security to those farmers and their families who on account of various factors are not able to manage their farms is the basic function of the new Act. Revalorisation of farmers pensions is the essential solution introducted in that aspect. The said Act can create potential requisites to stimulate structural changes in individual farming and also institutes solutions which can, in future affect the productivity of individual farms. Reservations can be raised as to the questions of relating a competence to receive a pension from handing over the farm. Benefits should result from the age and period of work and not from the fact of handing over the farm. The adopted solution is hampering becoming independent by young people. It is one of the problems which has to be returned to in the future.

50|$|In {{the area}} of social policy, the main issue was the {{progressive}} extension of social security to all <b>socio-professional</b> <b>groups,</b> and especially to farmers and the self-employed.

The law of 29 July 1957 extended compulsory health insurance to craftworkers, shopkeepers and manufacturers. The questions {{of the length of}} the working day, overtime payment, and wages, created numerous tensions between employers and workers. In 1955, a strike by miners paralysed the entire sector.

In addition to these economic arguments, one must consider the moral arguments in favour of the companies’ social responsibility. Competitiveness in this field is real, thus making the companies’ visibility to depend on it. Consequently, underestimating their impact can lead to the loss of customers, narrowing of economic activity and difficulties in attracting new customers.

40|$|International audienceLiterature on {{laterality}} emphasises {{the importance}} of implementing a comprehensive investigation of humans’ and non-humans’ laterality for both non-communication and communication functions. Adopting a global approach should enhance {{our understanding of the}} mechanistic drivers of human brain functional lateralisation and help to explore further the nature of the left-hemispheric systems for both functions. This study investigated human laterality for both functions by taking, for the first time, numerous behaviours and multiple potential influential factors into consideration. We analysed replies to the Rennes Laterality Questionnaire that takes into account simultaneously: participants’ behavioural, demographic and social characteristics as well as their genetic/social learning components and collateral factors such as health problems. We collected and analysed a large data set including 450, 220 item responses (317, 594 items related to behavioural laterality and 132, 626 items related to personal information) by 5, 904 participants. The majority of participants were right-lateralised for nine behavioural categories. The laterality of right-lateralised individuals for the behaviours considered varied very little between behavioural categories, contrary to the laterality of ambiguously- and left-lateralised individuals. This is the first evidence of the stability of right-lateralised individuals and the relative flexibility of ambiguously- and left-lateralised individuals with regards to behavioural laterality related to 60 everyday activities. Moreover, the laterality patterns of our study population were linked in particular to the following individual-related factors: demographic characteristics (current continent of residence), social characteristics (<b>socio-professional</b> <b>group</b> and study level), and collateral factors (writing hand, forced right-hand use, guiding eye, and health problems related to ear and back).

40|$|Management is an {{activity}} that crosses every area of a hospital. Bioethics gives health care management the basic criteria to promote the common good, to respect everyone and to overcome the economistic paradigm. This {{article is based on}} an ongoing study in hospitals in the northern zone, within the PhD in Bioethics. It aims to disseminate the results obtained in the <b>socio-professional</b> <b>group</b> of nurses who perform management functions, regardless of the implemented management model or level of performance. We aim to understand if the system of human values and the ethics of hospital managers influence the decision on health care, while contributing to the identification of a "Profile of ethical skills to manage health units". Methodologically, this research is identified as an exploratory-descriptive and transversal study with a quantitative approach. When collecting data, we used the Ethicality Questionnaire of Hospital Management, developed and validated, with a good level of internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha =. 74). It's a self-report instrument consisting of six dimensions (costs and ethics; weighting ethics; ethical decision, responsibility and quality; economic constraint and ethics, and ways to limit costs) and a total of 37 items, with a 5 -point Likert-type scale response. We focused solely on the results of the group of professional nurses, given its predominance in the study (191 elements corresponding to 45, 4 %). The results that reveal the nurses' opinion suggest that there is an integration of values such as responsibility, respect for human dignity and equity, among others, highlighting the consideration of ethical issues in management practices in nursing.

40|$|This {{work was}} based on {{material}} of military anthropological survey of Poland, which {{was carried out in}} the years 1921 - 1923 under the leadership of J. Mydlarski. Subject of investigation were data concerning 2569 soldiers born in the years 1899 - 1901 in Poznań province and the southern part of Pomeranian province. The purpose of this work was to evaluate the dependence between the environmental conditions and the mean body height in the population. The results are analysed {{in the light of the}} hypothesis about a selective character of the environmental influence on the population. In agreement with the accepted assumption, the mean body height in the population is influenced in a contrasting way by two partially different environmental factors: ’living conditions’ understood as the level of satisfying the basic life needs of the individual, and ’selective pressure’ being the sum of life dangers. These factors act on the individuals in a differentiated way depending on the genetic predispositions conditioning their adaptation ability, resistance and general health. The selective pressure through negative selection (differential mortality) eliminating from the population individuals who in the given living conditions develop and realize their growth potential in the poorest way limits the negative influence of living conditions on the mean body height in the population. This selection can have both a directional and stabilizing character. The mean body height of mature individuals in the population depends on the living conditions in which their development took place and on the selection degree by differential mortality. For the evaluation of the living and environmental conditions data were utilized concerning the number of children born, living and deceased in the families from which the investigated subjects originated. On this basis the environmental conditions were evaluated both in families and in the <b>socio-professional</b> <b>groups</b> distinguished on the basis of the father’s profession and the birth place ("village", "town"). In case of families, the evaluation {{was based on}} the assumption that the number of children in the family is a burdening factor, and the morality is in a great degree the effect of worse living and environmental conditions. Better environmental conditions in <b>socio-professional</b> <b>groups</b> are testified primarily by a lower percentage of deceased children in the families from which the investigated subjects belonging to the given group originate, as well as by a greater number of children. The departing point of the hypothesis accepted at the outset was the fact that in the material no definite dependence was found between the evaluated living and environmental conditions and the mean body height. The analysis of families has shown that on the average the tallest were the subjects originating from families which due to the number of living children in the family and the percentage of the deceased ones could provide the average living and environmental conditions (Tables 8 and 11). Worse environmental conditions, in case of <b>socio-professional</b> <b>groups,</b> caused by mortality and fecundity in the families from which the subjects belonging to the definite groups originated were not always connected with smaller body heights (Tables 9 and 10) ...|$|R

The analysis encompasses also the degree of internal coherence of this category. It is but a fragment of more extensive analyses concerning the place of teachers in the society's macrostructure. The study reveals that teachers represent a socio-professional category, which is characterized with a specific structure of social features typical for the inteligentsia and here mainly {{in the area of the}} level of educational background and cultural consumption and, to a smaller extent, in the area of performed managerial functions (absence of expanded formal hierarchic structure in the education system) and income levels. They represent the most numerous professional category among the intelligentsia (not counting technicians). According to the estimates of the teachers themselves their social position is closest to that of civil officers, and it is estimated to be each lower than that of doctors, lawyers, and engineers. And oven though the teachers do not constitute an internally fully homogeneous category - the educational background proved to be a main dimension of differentiation - they display distinct features of a <b>socio-professional</b> <b>group.</b> This is confirmed among others by the observed strong tendency towards maintaining social and marital contacts within their own professional category, convergence of estimates as regards the socio-professional position held by them as well os observance of their own specific attitude to work or personality features.

40|$|International {{audience}} BACKGROUND: Many factors {{influence the}} return to work of workers with chronic low back pain (CLBP). They have been said to vary according to <b>socio-professional</b> <b>group.</b> This study first aimed to compare prognostic factors influencing {{the return to}} work of CLBP healthcare workers (HCWs) and other workers (non-HCWs) after rehabilitation coupled with an occupational intervention. The second objective was to improve the evolution of indicators such as clinical examination, psychosocial impact and pain impact. METHODS: Between 2007 and 2012, a cohort of 217 CLBP workers (54. 8  %-women; mean age[*]=[*] 41. 3 [*]±[*] 9. 5  years, 118 non-HCWs; 99 HCWs mainly from the public sector) was included in an ambulatory rehabilitation program (standard physiotherapy or intensive network physiotherapy) coupled with an occupational intervention. Workers completed a questionnaire and had a clinical examination at baseline and after 24  months' follow up. Physical, social and occupational data was collected at the same time. Statistical analyses were performed to evaluate prognostic factors for return to work and compare the two worker populations. RESULTS: There {{was no difference between}} groups for the rate of OP (occupational physician) intervention or type of physiotherapy. 77. 3  % of workers returned to work after 2  years following inclusion. To be an HCW (OR 0. 1; 95  % CI [0. 03 - 0. 34]), to have less than 112 sick- leave days (OR 1. 00; 95  % CI [0. 93 - 1. 00]), a small fingertip-floor distance (OR 0. 96; 95  % CI [0. 93 - 0. 99]), a low anxiety/depression score (OR 0. 97; 95  % CI [0. 95 - 1. 00]), a low impact of CLBP on daily life (OR 0. 96; 95  % CI [0. 93 - 1. 00]), and on quality of life (OR 0. 98; 95  % CI [0. 95 - 1. 00]) at baseline were statistically associated with return to work after 2  years of follow up. Only the profession (workplace) was statistically associated with return to work after 2  years of follow up using multivariate analysis. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the first cohort study concerning predictive factors of RTW among CLBP workers after 2  years of follow up. Interventions in the work environment did not seem to predict job retention significantly. But only 50  % of the employees in both groups (HCW and non-HCW) had one intervention at their workplace after 2  years. This study underlined the fact that the type of physiotherapy with a well-trained physiotherapist used to take care of CLBP could not impact on the RTW forecast. To develop these initial results, it might be interesting to study the comparison between private and public sectors and to randomize the physiotherapeutic intervention. </p...|$|E

40|$|IntroductionNoncommunicable {{diseases}} (NCDs) are a {{major public}} health threat, particularly in developing countries. In sub-Saharan Africa, the scarcity of reliable data on NCDs {{in the general population}} makes it difficult to develop efficient prevention strategies. The objective of this cross-sectional study was to assess the prevalence of 4 cardiometabolic NCDs among 402 private-sector workers in Dakar, Senegal: high blood pressure (HBP), diabetes, obesity, and chronic kidney disease (CKD). MethodsWe collected demographic, clinical, and biological data for each worker during routine occupational health visits between September 1 and November 30, 2010. Multivariate analyses were performed to identify risk factors associated with NCDs. ResultsAmong the 402 study participants, 24. 1 % had HBP, 9. 7 % had diabetes, 16. 7 % were obese, and 22. 4 % had CKD. About half of participants (48. 5 %) were not aware of their diseases before the screening. Univariate analysis showed that age was significantly associated with blood pressure, fasting blood glucose, and renal function. After adjusting for age and sex, systolic blood pressure was correlated with renal function, and physical inactivity was significantly associated with obesity. ConclusionDespite its small sample size, our study provides a perspective on the extent of cardiometabolic NCDs in Senegalese workers. Our study also suggests that targeted screening activities focusing on <b>socio-professional</b> <b>groups</b> may be helpful in the absence of national integrated prevention programs...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} problem of {{choosing}} some identified strategies for life by various population groups {{and the impact of}} this phenomenon on the regulation of mass demographic behavior. Life strategies are interpreted by the authors as examples (stereotypes) of behavior, the subject of construction of social action based on a conscious, planned design of life (life plan) and correction of the fundamental set of values in accordance with the deliberate socio-economic interests. Criteria and types of strategies for living with the specific socio-economic conditions and factors determining the differentiation of the installations of demographic behavior are suggested for the reader. As the basis for the typology of strategies for life of <b>socio-professional</b> <b>groups,</b> a type of social activity of the population is adopted. Specific socio-economic factors, the strategy of material prosperity and economic activity as regulators of reproductive and self-preservation behavior at the micro- and macro-level are identified. During the conducted selective survey, the structure of socio-economic values of reproduction in urban and rural families of the northern regions of the Urals was revealed. Scientific and practical significance of these research results are defined by the needs of areas, urban districts and city parts to develop appropriate requirements of the day of innovative concepts of demographic development and family policy measures, taking into account the identified specific value orientations of family, socio-economic expectations and well-being of the population...|$|R
40|$|The nomads are {{referred}} to as ethnic or <b>socio-professional</b> <b>groups</b> of people that travel and migrate from one geographical location to another, in search of means of livelihood. In Nigeria, the nomads are predominately the pastoralists, the migrant farmers, and the fishermen. Nomads are characterized by the absence of fixed domicile; hence they are always on the move. They do not have permanent place of settlement, therefore, their children suffer a lot of deprivations. This research investigated on the impact of psycho-social deprivations on emotional health and education of the nomadic children in Nigeria. A descriptive survey was adopted, while focus group discussion built into interview was used for data collection. Two research questions and two hypotheses guided the study. The population of the study was the entire nomads in Nigeria. A random sampling technique was used to select 400 nomads. The result was analysed, using mean scores, standard deviations, and z-test. The findings indicated that nomadic children experience emotional, intellectual deprivations, and deprivations of health care services, and social amenities among others. There is {{no significant difference in the}} mean scores and standard deviations of male and female respondents on whether nomadic children suffer psycho-social deprivations. There is no significant difference in the mean scores and standard deviations of male and female respondents on whet her psycho-social deprivations have impact on the emotional health and education of the nomadic children. Summarily, the findings were that nomadic children experience a high rate of psycho-social deprivations in Nigeria...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{attempts}} {{to analyze the}} major factors which led to landmarks {{in the evolution of}} social security in Greece during the turbulent period between 1920 and 1990. The development of hundreds of different social insurance schemes and the lack of reliable information makes a full history almost impossible. The landmarks are chosen both for their impact on population coverage {{as well as for the}} principles they established. The first ever state social insurance was introduced in 1922 followed by the Social Insurance Organization (IKA) in 1934 - the compulsory scheme for white and blue collar workers in the urban areas; in the post war period there were desperate efforts to establish social assistance to help the casualties of the Second World War and the successive civil war. An attempt to reorganize IKA failed in 1951. Agricultural social insurance was established in 1961. Finally the repressive social insurance reform of 1990 attempted to correct the social policies of the 1960 s, 1970 s and 1980 s. Seventy years after the early state social insurance policies, the nature of the Greek social security system is unique - a mosaic of almost four hundred social insurance funds - reproducing huge inequalities, inconsistencies and inefficiencies. Moreover, the "system" reached a financial deadlock in the late 1980 s, threatening the country itself with bankruptcy. The faulty development of the social security system reflects the irresponsibility, indecisiveness and opportunism of Greek politics, not met in other European countries. What is shown is that the social security model in Greece is embarrassingly characterized as an accumulation of political bribes in favour of particular <b>socio-professional</b> <b>groups.</b> Rational decisions have never been taken. In fact, social policy is meant and used as a form of social politics...|$|R
40|$|Local {{development}} {{could be}} described as an attempt of global territorial development including economic, social, ultural, political aspects, encouraging the endogenous development -involving all human and financial means which contribute to it and assuring their convergence. It is a process based on the involvement of all interested actors (persons elected at local level, <b>socio-professional</b> <b>groups,</b> associative groups, initiators of projects on a certain territory) but also of the local population. Tourism {{is one of the most}} important branches in Romanian economy, having at its disposal a huge development potential. This field can represent a development chance for many areas. The diversity of tourism activities as well as the presence of some of them in the structure of other branches of economy offers tourism the character of an interference branch, having complex, ample connections with the other economic branches, connections that must be taken into account when local development strategies are drawn up. Local authorities are increasingly involved in the development and running of several aspects connected to tourism. This fact is based on the decentralizing tendency found in many countries, which refers to granting more responsibilities to local authorities. They know best what is important for the areas they manage and will do their best to achieve the local development objectives. At the same time, this reflects the stress laid on the involvement of communities in planning tourism and in the developing process of their areas. Tourism has many positive effects and contributes to the economic development of the areas that contain tourism sights directly and indirectly. The currency contribution of tourism, its contribution to forming the community’s income, the generation of business and employment opportunities are only a few of the aspects that show the part played by tourism in the overall economic development of an area. Tourism contributes to the sustainable local development. Tourism development must take place both in rural and urban environments. ...|$|R
40|$|The Polish {{economic}} literature adopts that a consumption {{policy should}} consist of an aggregate of principles, methods and means {{used by the}} State {{in order to increase}} the level and modernize the structure of consumption both in relation to the whole society and to its basic <b>socio-professional</b> <b>groups</b> and individuals. Therefore the main subject and task of the consumption policy is to delimit directions of the consumption development, define its current and target levels, material structures, indicate at priorities in consumption and propose methods and tools of implementation. As far as Poland is concerned, for the whole postwar period only a normative and active policy of consumption was encountered. It can be generally stated though, that in particular years of functioning of our economy and under certain conditions it has never become a compact system of goals and instruments of their implementation,, for the whole of the examined period. It was characterized by fragmentarity, ad hoc actions and the lack of coherence. Thus under the conditions of presently implemented economic reform, a clear definition of goals and tasks of the consumption policy becomes an utmost -necessity. The consumption policy, being an element of the superior goals of the economy is able to and should become an active element of the new economic system which is to be introduced in course of the implementation of the economic reform. The system has to contribute to more effective and rational relating production to the consumption. Yet, returning a general monetary-market equilibrium and partial equilibria, then preventing their drastic upsetting are the prerequisits to pursue the active consumption policy by the State. The previous practice indicates that only under conditions of market equilibrium the process of rationalizing consumption structure and optimizing a consumption effect can effectively take place. It is of a primary importance for the implementation of the active consumption policy.

40|$|International audienceWith a {{specific}} {{focus on the}} 2015 regional elections, this paper looks comparatively at the territorial dimension of FN national populist politics across two French regions, namely NPDCP and PACA, where the FN achieved its best electoral performances in 2015. Taking both the supply and demand sides of FN politics in France, it seeks to assess the salience and relevance of regional-identity frames of mobilization, and how these may shape the dynamics of FN support locally. Whilst a typical case of ‘national-populist party’, the Front national has recently diversified its strategies of electoral mobilization and organizational development at the subnational level, while also becoming increasingly embedded in local and regional politics. Distinctive patterns of regional identity politics reflect diverging strategies of mobilization {{as well as the}} presence of factions within the FN, which have a territorial basis along a North-South divide. Turning to the demand side of FN politics, the second section of this paper shows a positive relationship between the FN vote and the presence of specific <b>socio-professional</b> <b>groups,</b> i. e. farmers, blue collar workers and routine non manual employees, which have formed the bulk of FN support since the late 1990 s. The analysis confirms the positive correlation between unemployment and FN voting, while also corroborating the negative relationship with immigration at the communal level. Looking at regional variation in the above patterns, we find the FN’s appeal to working class voters to be similar in both regions, although the effect is more heterogeneous in the south. In PACA, support for the FN is more positively associated with the level of income in the commune, which may attest to the weight of the party’s traditional petty-bourgeois constituency in the region. Finally, contrary to anticipation, the effect of unemployment is found to be significantly stronger in the Mediterranean south. Finally, looking at the presence of regionalized patterns of party competition and the competitive location taken by the FN across NPDCP and PACA. suggests two electorally disparate regions and distinct subnational party systems. In the north, the strategic emphasis by Marine Le Pen on socio-economic issues may be accounted for by the fact that competition for votes takes place essentially between the FN and the left. In the south, on the other hand, party competition is increasingly characterized by the opposition between the FN and the mainstream right, which may produce stronger incentives for the FN to focus on cultural issues of immigration and national identity. Despite regional differences, however, nationalism remains a strong ideological feature of the French Front National, which is rooted in a populist radical right ideology...|$|R
