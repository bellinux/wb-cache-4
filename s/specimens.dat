5|$|In 2007, {{a review}} of all well-preserved <b>specimens</b> {{including}} the then-newly discovered Thermopolis specimen concluded that two distinct species of Archaeopteryx could be supported: A. lithographica (consisting of at least the London and Solnhofen <b>specimens),</b> and A. siemensii (consisting of at least the Berlin, Munich, and Thermopolis <b>specimens).</b> The two species are distinguished primarily by large flexor tubercles on the foot claws in A. lithographica (the claws of A. siemensii <b>specimens</b> being relatively simple and straight). A. lithographica also had a constricted portion of the crown in some teeth and a stouter metatarsus. A supposed additional species, Wellnhoferia grandis (based on the Solnhofen specimen), seems to be indistinguishable from A. lithographica except in its larger size.|$|E
5|$|In London Smith {{tended to}} neglect the zoological {{parts of the}} collection, he added some <b>specimens</b> and also gave some <b>specimens</b> away.

5|$|It {{has been}} argued that all the <b>specimens</b> belong to the same species, A. lithographica. Differences do exist among the <b>specimens,</b> and while some {{researchers}} regard these as due to the different ages of the <b>specimens,</b> some may be related to actual species diversity. In particular, the Munich, Eichstätt, Solnhofen, and Thermopolis <b>specimens</b> differ from the London, Berlin, and Haarlem <b>specimens</b> in being smaller or much larger, having different finger proportions, having more slender snouts lined with forward-pointing teeth, and possible presence of a sternum. Due to these differences, most individual <b>specimens</b> have been given their own species name at one point or another. The Berlin specimen has been designated as Archaeornis siemensii, the Eichstätt specimen as Jurapteryx recurva, the Munich specimen as Archaeopteryx bavarica, and the Solnhofen specimen as Wellnhoferia grandis.|$|E
