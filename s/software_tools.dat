Third-party mods like Garry's Mod usually offer the ability to manipulate characters {{and take advantage of}} custom or migrated content, allowing for the creation of works like Counter-Strike For Kids that can be filmed using multiple games.|$|E
5|$|The Image Computer never sold well. Inadequate sales {{threatened}} {{to put the}} company out of business as financial losses grew. Jobs invested more and more money in exchange for an increased stake in the company, reducing the proportion of management and employee ownership until eventually, his total investment of $50million gave him control of the entire company. In 1989, Lasseter's growing animation department, originally composed of just four people (Lasseter, Bill Reeves, Eben Ostby, and Sam Leffler), {{was turned into a}} division that produced computer-animated commercials for outside companies. In April 1990, Pixar sold its hardware division, including all proprietary hardware technology and imaging software, to Vicom Systems, and transferred 18 of Pixar's approximately 100 employees. That same year, Pixar moved from San Rafael to Richmond, California to Burbank, California. Pixar released some of its <b>software</b> <b>tools</b> on the open market for Macintosh and Windows systems. RenderMan was one of the leading 3D packages of the early 1990s, and Typestry was a special-purpose 3D text renderer that competed with RayDream addDepth.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: To {{develop a}} <b>software</b> <b>tool</b> for {{intensity}} modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) and electronic portal imaging (EPI) dosimetry research. The <b>software</b> <b>tool</b> implements correction factors to a commercially available EPI dosimetry model {{to account for}} the change in EPI response to multileaf collimator (MLC) transmitted beam as compared to open beam in IMRT fields. Method and Materials: Software was designed to perform the following tasks: i) Read MLC files from IMRT treatment plans and calculate a matrix of open beam and MLC transmission components. ii) Read portal dose image prediction (PDIP) files exported from the Eclipse treatment planning system (Varian Medical Systems, Palo Alto, CA). iii) Interpolate correction factors from look‐up tables for each PDIP based on the MLC transmission components of the corresponding MLC file. iv) Calculate and write a corrected PDIP that can be imported back into the planning system. The <b>software</b> <b>tool</b> was developed using the Microsoft Visual Studio. NET framework with the C# compiler. The <b>software</b> <b>tool</b> was validated for functionality and accuracy with a series of test IMRT fields. Results: The <b>software</b> <b>tool</b> correctly calculated the open and MLC beam components for different MLC models and collimator rotations. The corrected PDIP pixel values agreed with manual calculations to within 1 % in all cases. Artifacts in the corrected PDIP in regions of high dose gradients were avoided when the MLC transmission matrix was sampled with pixel size ⩽ PDIP pixel size. Additional functions available with the <b>software</b> <b>tool</b> include the ability to write the open beam matrix to file, perform arithmetic operations on images, display and save image files, and to plot profile comparisons across images and open beam matrices. Conclusion: A <b>software</b> <b>tool</b> was developed and validated for IMRT and EPI dosimetry investigations. The <b>software</b> <b>tool</b> is being developed further for EPI dosimetry using transit IMRT beams. 1 page(s...|$|R

5|$|In digital puppetry, machinima creators become virtual actors; each {{crew member}} {{controls}} {{a character in}} real-time, as in a multiplayer game. The director can use built-in camera controls, if available. Otherwise, video is captured {{from the perspectives of}} one or more puppeteers who serve as camera operators. Puppetry allows for improvisation and offers controls familiar to gamers, but requires more personnel than the other methods and is less precise than scripted recordings. However, some games, such as the Halo series, (except for Halo PC and Custom Edition, which allow AI and custom objects and characters), allow filming only through puppetry. According to Marino, other disadvantages are the possibility of disruption when filming in an open multi-user environment and the temptation for puppeteers to play the game in earnest, littering the set with blood and dead bodies. However, Chris Burke intentionally hosts This Spartan Life in these unpredictable conditions, which are fundamental to the show. Other works filmed using puppetry are the ILL Clan's improvisational comedy series On the Campaign Trail with Larry & Lenny Lumberjack and Rooster Teeth Productions' Red vs. Blue. In recamming, which builds on puppetry, actions are first recorded to a game engine's demo file format, not directly as video frames. Without re-enacting scenes, artists can then manipulate the demo files to add cameras, tweak timing and lighting, and change the surroundings. This technique is limited to the few engines and <b>software</b> <b>tools</b> that support it.|$|E
