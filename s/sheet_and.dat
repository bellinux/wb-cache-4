5|$|Earth's {{lithosphere}} {{is divided}} into several rigid tectonic plates that migrate across the surface over periods of many millions of years. About 71% of Earth's surface is covered with water, mostly by oceans.

The majority of Earth's polar regions are covered in ice, including the Antarctic ice <b>sheet</b> <b>and</b> the sea ice of the Arctic ice pack. Earth's interior remains active with a solid iron inner core, a liquid outer core that generates the Earth's magnetic field, and a convecting mantle that drives plate tectonics.|$|E

30|$|The {{interaction}} between GO <b>sheets</b> <b>and</b> MMT <b>sheets</b> was studied. GO <b>sheets</b> <b>and</b> MMT <b>sheets</b> were repelled through electrostatic repulsion. There {{were a few}} negative charges {{at the edges of}} GO <b>sheets</b> <b>and</b> on the surface of MMT sheets. The hydroxyl groups of GO were attracted by the oxygen atoms through hydrogen bonds. An equilibrium was reached between repulsive and attractive forces. With enhancement of the attractive force, the equilibrium was broken, <b>and</b> then GO <b>sheets</b> were adsorbed on the surface of MMT <b>sheets</b> <b>and</b> some GO <b>sheets</b> inserted into the interlayer space of MMT. The adsorption and insertion of GO sheets were the main mechanism to form a stable assembly structure based on GO nano-sheets <b>and</b> MMT <b>sheets.</b>|$|R

5|$|A {{scenario}} {{consistent with}} the phylogenetic, ice sheet size, and sea-level depth data is that during the Late Pleistocene the sea levels were at their lowest. A single wave of wolf colonization into North America commenced {{with the opening of}} the Bering land bridge 70,000YBP. It ended with the closing of the Yukon corridor that ran along the division between the Laurentide Ice <b>Sheet</b> <b>and</b> the Cordilleran Ice Sheet 23,000YBP during the Late Glacial Maximum. As wolves had been in the fossil record of North America but the genetic ancestry of modern wolves could be traced back only 80,000 years, the wolf haplotypes that were already in North America were replaced by these invaders, either through competitive displacement or through genetic admixture. The replacement in North America of a basal population of wolves by a more recent one is {{consistent with the}} findings of earlier studies.|$|E
5|$|According to U.S. officials, bin Laden {{was buried}} at sea because no country would accept his remains. Before {{disposing}} of the body, the U.S. called the Saudi government, who approved of burying {{the body in}} the ocean. Muslim religious rites were performed aboard Carl Vinson in the North Arabian Sea within 24 hours of bin Laden's death. Preparations began at 10:10am local time and at-sea burial was completed at 11am. The body was washed, wrapped in a white <b>sheet</b> <b>and</b> placed in a weighted plastic bag. An officer read prepared religious remarks which were translated into Arabic by a native speaker. Afterward, bin Laden's body was placed onto a flat board. The board was tilted upward {{on one side and the}} body slid off into the sea.|$|E

5|$|Five single {{sheets of}} bark paper were found {{associated}} with the codex, they had no stucco coating and were brown and water stained. Two of these had adhered to the codex {{and the other three}} may have once been with the codex but had separated. One of these sheets had a painted line in the same red hematite pigment used in the codex itself. A smaller sheet of bark paper was attached to the lined <b>sheet</b> <b>and</b> this smaller piece was submitted for radiocarbon dating. This testing produced a date for the sheet of AD 1230 ± 130; this would date the document {{to the end of the}} Early Postclassic period (c. 950–1200) and would make the codex the oldest known surviving Mesoamerican codex. The lack of incrustations or insect damage to the codex suggests that, if genuine, it was stored inside a container for hundreds of years. The overall damaged state of the codex conflicts with the good preservation of surviving parts; it may be that the damaged codex was deliberately decommissioned as a ritual object, rather than being simply discarded.|$|E
5|$|On 18 August 2013, Juventus {{began the}} 2013–14 season by {{defending}} their Supercoppa Italiana title, at the Stadio Olimpico in Rome. Juventus defeated Lazio 4–0, with Buffon keeping a clean sheet {{in the competition}} for the first time; Buffon was praised for making several saves. On 24 November, Buffon made his 500th appearance in Serie A, keeping a clean sheet in a 2–0 away win against Livorno. On 6 December, Buffon recorded his seventh consecutive clean <b>sheet,</b> <b>and</b> his ninth of the season; as a result, he bettered his previous personal record of 568 minutes without conceding a goal in Serie A, going 640 minutes without being beaten in the Italian League. Buffon was finally beaten by Maximiliano Moralez in a 4–1 win over Atalanta, after going 745 minutes without conceding a goal in Serie A, and equalling Luca Marchegiani's sixth-best unbeaten streak in Serie A history. Buffon was nominated for the 2013 FIFPro XI and the 2013 Ballon d'Or for his performances throughout the calendar year.|$|E
5|$|Phocids {{are known}} to have existed for at least 15 million years, and {{molecular}} evidence supports a divergence of the Monachinae and Phocinae lineages 22mya. The fossil monachine Monotherium and phocine Leptophoca were found in southeastern North America. The deep split between the lineages of Erignathus and Cystophora 17mya suggests that the phocines migrated eastward and northward from the North Atlantic. The genera Phoca and Pusa could have arisen when a phocine lineage traveled from the Paratethys Sea to the Arctic Basin and subsequently went eastward. The ancestor of the Baikal seal migrated into Lake Baikal from the Arctic (via the Siberian ice <b>sheet)</b> <b>and</b> became isolated there. The Caspian seal's ancestor became isolated as the Paratethys shrank, leaving the animal in a small remnant sea, the Caspian Sea. The monochines diversified southward. Monachus emerged in the Mediterranean and migrated to the Caribbean and then the central North Pacific. The two extant elephant seal species diverged close to 4mya after the Panamanian isthmus was formed. The lobodontine lineage emerged around 9mya and colonized the southern ocean in response to glaciation.|$|E
