5|$|Portraits of Mary <b>show</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> had a small, oval-shaped head, a long, graceful neck, bright auburn hair, hazel-brown eyes, {{under heavy}} lowered eyelids and finely arched brows, smooth pale skin, a high forehead, and regular, firm features. She was {{considered}} a pretty child and later, as a woman, strikingly attractive. At some point in her infancy or childhood, she caught smallpox, {{but it did not}} mark her features.|$|E
5|$|Stamata Revithi {{was born}} in Syros in 1866. Records of her life from 1896 <b>show</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was living in poverty in Piraeus in 1896. At that point she {{had given birth to}} two children, a son who died in 1895, aged seven, and another child who was {{seventeen}} months old {{by the time of the}} 1896 Olympics. According to Olympic historian Athanasios Tarasouleas, Revithi, who was blonde and thin with large eyes, looked much older than her age.|$|E
5|$|Alster was {{launched}} on 5 January 1928, and completed on 25 February 1928. She {{was built for}} Norddeutscher Lloyd. The Code Letters QMHG were allocated and her port of registry was Bremen. She served on routes between Germany and Australia and East Asia. Lloyds Register entries <b>show</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> held a passenger certificate from 1934–40. With the change in Code Letters in 1934, Alster was allocated DOEO as her callsign. She had a crew of 69 and could initially take 14 passengers. In 1930 the passenger capacity was increased to 16.|$|E

Lulu is green, <b>showing</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> is Lara's dog. Like their owners, Sara, Kara and Lara, Susu, Kuku and Lulu are snooty.|$|R

5|$|An Inconvenient Truth is a 2006 American {{documentary}} film directed by Davis Guggenheim about former United States Vice President Al Gore's campaign to educate citizens {{about global warming}} via a comprehensive slide show that, by his own estimate made in the film, he has given {{more than a thousand}} times. The idea to document his efforts came from producer Laurie David, who saw his presentation at a town-hall meeting on global warming, which coincided with the opening of The Day After Tomorrow. Laurie David was so inspired by Gore's slide <b>show</b> <b>that</b> <b>she,</b> with producer Lawrence Bender, met with Guggenheim to adapt the presentation into a film.|$|E
5|$|Head I, {{completed}} late in 1948, {{is considered}} {{more successful than}} Head II. Although it is well-regarded critically, Head II is seen {{as something of a}} creative cul-de-sac, while Heads III, IV and V are usually considered as merely intermediate steps towards HeadVI. It is exceptional in Bacon's oeuvre that works of their relative poor quality survive; he was ruthlessly self-critical and often slashed or abandoned canvasses before they were completed. When pressed again by Brausen in 1953 to produce works for a New York <b>show</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> had been publicising for a year, he was full of doubt and destroyed most of what he had been working on, including several other popes.|$|E

25|$|Vincejo {{arrived at}} Sheerness on 6 April 1803. Admiralty records <b>show</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> then {{underwent}} refitting at Chatham between September 1803 and February 1804, with Commander John Wesley Wright recommissioning her in September 1803.|$|E

25|$|Most of the {{paintings}} Kahlo made during this time were portraits of herself, her sisters, and school friends. Her early paintings and correspondence <b>show</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> drew inspiration especially from European artists, in particular Renaissance masters such as Sandro Botticelli and Bronzino and avant-garde movements such as Neue Sachlichkeit and Cubism.|$|E

25|$|LST-12 {{left from}} Hampton Roads, Virginia for the Mediterranean on 14 May 1943, with convoy UGS 8A, {{arriving}} in Oran, Algeria, sometime before 8 June 1943, breaking down en route. Records also <b>show</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> left Gibraltar on 21 June 1943, with Convoy GTX 3, and traveled to Port Said, Egypt, arriving 4 July 1943.|$|E
25|$|Dispatch was {{transferred}} to Russia under an Admiralty Order dated 28 January 1796. She apparently was at Chatham on , in company with two Russian ships of the line, suggesting that she was already under the Russian flag. However, British records <b>show</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was struck from the Navy List and handed over at Chatham to the Russian Navy in March.|$|E
25|$|Some fictional {{accounts}} {{speculate that}} Sacagawea was romantically involved with Lewis or Clark during their expedition, however, while the journals <b>show</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was friendly with Clark and would often do favors for him, {{the idea of}} a romantic liaison was created by novelists who wrote about the expedition much later. This fiction was perpetuated in the Western film The Far Horizons (1955).|$|E

5000|$|Jill Murphy's {{illustrations}} <b>shows</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> is tall, {{with long}} brown plaits. Some illustrations <b>shows</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> frequently fails to tie her bootlaces and the colour ones that her uniform sash is red. According to the author, Mildred's appearance {{is based on}} her own appearance as a teenager. She remembers: [...] "Mildred is based on myself when I had plaits so long that I could sit on them!" ...|$|R
25|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, Milano {{contacted}} Ryan White, a schoolboy ostracized for having AIDS, and {{a fan of}} Milano's. She attended a big party for him where she sat with him for six hours making friendship bracelets. They appeared together on The Phil Donahue Show, where Milano kissed White, in order to <b>show</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> could not catch the disease through casual contact with him.|$|E
25|$|Nevertheless, Lady Mary's {{views on}} {{marriage}} and equality <b>show</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was advanced for her time period. She {{was a strong}} advocate of women's education. Hamilton's stories may have influenced Jane Austen, as the English author included several of Hamilton's names in her works: Bennet and Bingley in Pride and Prejudice, and Dashwood in Sense and Sensibility. Johns observes that Hamilton's feminist utopian ideas also influenced Mary Wollstonecraft and Catharine Macaulay.|$|E
25|$|Ever cautious, {{she wanted}} to {{eliminate}} misleading possibilities. Photographs of her Birkbeck work table <b>show</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> routinely used small molecular models, although certainly not ones on the grand scale successfully used at Cambridge for DNA. In the middle of February 1953, Crick's thesis advisor, Max Perutz, gave Crick {{a copy of a}} report written for a Medical Research Council biophysics committee visit to King's in December 1952, containing many of Franklin's crystallographic calculations.|$|E

25|$|Having {{established}} the facts, Gordon {{turned to the}} law. He applied the test from Mt. Healthy City Bd. of Ed. v. Doyle, a 1977 Supreme Court decision overturning the firing of a teacher for, among other things, sharing a proposed dress code with the media. First, Myers would {{have to prove that}} her distribution of the questionnaire was constitutionally protected speech, and that her firing was a result. If she could establish that, the burden would then be on Connick to <b>show</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> would have been fired whether she had distributed the questionnaire or not.|$|E
25|$|At this point, {{although}} {{she does not}} mention it in her memoirs, she appears to have left the dragoons and returned home; on 27 June 1796, she married Henri Commarmot, a cavalryman in the , then forming part of the Dijon garrison in the Army of the Rhine. Army records <b>show</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> herself joined the 8th Hussars as a trooper on 21 December 1797, under the surname of Sangène; she remained with them even when Commarmot transferred to another regiment, but in November 1798, she transferred back to the 15th Dragoons. She was thus {{a soldier in the}} Hussars during the invasion of Switzerland.|$|E
25|$|Chios {{departed}} Methil, on 3 December 1943, in convoy EN 314 (series 2), {{arriving in}} Loch Ewe, on 5 December. She departed Liverpool, England, in convoy OS 63/KMS 37, on 25 December 1943. The convoy split on 7 January 1944, with Chios continuing on in convoy convoy KMS 37G, arriving in Gibraltar, on 9 January. However, the same records <b>show</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> departed Liverpool, England, in convoy OS 64/KMS 38, on 3 January 1944. The convoy split on 15 January 1944, with Chios continuing on in convoy convoy KMS 38G, arriving in Gibraltar, on 17 January. It's possible {{that she was}} delayed from sailing in the first, here intended convoy, and had to travel in the proceeding convoy.|$|E
