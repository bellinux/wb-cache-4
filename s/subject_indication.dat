40|$|Hepatitis C virus (HCV) {{infection}} is highly prevalent among {{chronic kidney disease}} (CKD) subjects under hemodialysis and in kidney transplantation (KT) recipients, being an important cause {{of morbidity and mortality}} in these patients. the vast majority of HCV chronic infections in the hemodialysis setting are currently attributable to nosocomial transmission. Acute and chronic hepatitis C exhibits distinct clinical and laboratorial features, which can impact on management and treatment decisions. in hemodialysis subjects, acute infections are usually asymptomatic and anicteric; since spontaneous viral clearance is very uncommon in this context, acute infections should be treated as soon as possible. in KT recipients, the occurrence of acute hepatitis C can have a more severe course, with a rapid progression of liver fibrosis. in these patients, it is recommended to use pegylated interferon (PEG-IFN) in combination with ribavirin, with doses adjusted according to estimated glomerular filtration rate. There is no evidence suggesting that chronic hepatitis C exhibits a more aggressive course in CKD subjects under conservative management. in these <b>subjects,</b> <b>indication</b> of treatment with PEG-IFN plus ribavirin relies on the CKD stage, rate of progression of renal dysfunction and the possibility of a preemptive transplant. HCV infection has been associated with both liver disease-related deaths and cardiovascular mortality in hemodialysis patients. Among those individuals, low HCV viral loads and the phenomenon of intermittent HCV viremia are often observed, and sequential HCV RNA monitoring is needed. Despite the poor tolerability and suboptimal efficacy of antiviral therapy in CKD patients, many patients can achieve sustained virological response, which improve patient and graft outcomes. Hepatitis C eradication before KT theoretically improves survival and reduces the occurrence of chronic graft nephropathy, de novo glomerulonephritis and post-transplant diabetes mellitus.

40|$|Varying {{rates of}} partial {{fertilization}} (2 - 40 %) {{were found in}} literature. These data gave evidence that the 'all-or-none' hypothesis on fertilization is not correct, {{at least in a}} number of sheep breeds and experimental conditions. Furthermore, there are indications for variability in prenatal mortality at different stages of pregnancy, as a function of ovulation rate (OR). Consequently, higher partial fertilization and foetal mortality rates interfere with the determination of prenatal survival (PS), based on the difference between OR and the number of living embryos at varying times before or at lambing, as was done in many studies on that <b>subject.</b> <b>Indications</b> for variability in PS within breeds were mainly an effect of differentiation between lines, depending on the selection criteria followed, e. g., growth rate vs, multiple ovulations. In some cases, this effect was associated with dam-embryo interactions or line-age interactions. Data on differences in PS between breeds and crosses were based, in most cases, on differences between twin and multiple ovulating ewes, or in ewes carrying multiple foetuses after egg transfer. Among twin ovulating ewes, all born to Romney dams, uterine efficiency (UE) was highest in Finnish Landrace (FL) shed ewes. The contribution of FL breeding to superiority in UE was supported in other FL crossbreeds and in crossbred genotypes with FL genes from their ancestry. Crossbreeding effects of the Booroola Merino on uterine capacity (UC) or on UE were variable, depending on the breeds used, on the presence of the Booroola Fecundity gene and on OR. A clear distinction should be made between UE (the marginal increase in LS as OR increases) and UC (the maximum number of foetuses a dam is able to support at birth) when comparing Finnish Landrace and Booroola Merino with other prolific breeds. There were indications of a higher genetic variability in PS, independent from the genetic variability in OR, in the Romanov breed than in other breeds and crosses. in conclusion, while genetic variation in litter size (LS) within some breeds can be statistically predicted on the basis of OR, between-breed variation in LS has consider the genetic variation in PS.

30|$|In most {{elderly and}} chronic-ill {{patients}} physicians have difficulties {{to take decisions}} when oxygen supplementation and the usual medical therapy are not effective. In these <b>subjects</b> the <b>indication</b> for mechanical ventilation may be questionable. Our data suggest that NIV could be an alternative option as it could provide an effective and safe treatment in a general ward. The difficulty lies in making a proper selection of these patients, how to establish who needs to be admitted in an ICU setting and who could be treated with NIV in a setting of sub-intensity of care. To address this question {{we need to develop}} more accurate prediction rules focused on patients' overall prognosis to better select and help families in the decision-making process, and to make a more efficient use of the resources. The major limitations of our study are its retrospective nature, its low power due to the limited sample size, and the lack of a randomized control group. Our data suggest that the use of NIV in internal medicine sub-intensive units is a safe and effective option in the treatment of ARF in elderly patients with co-morbidities, reducing the need of intubation and unnecessary admissions to ICUs.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{accuracy}} of a prediction equation {{for assessing the}} lowest arterial oxygen saturation (Sao 2) during sleep was determined in 24 consecutive patients with chronic obstructive lung disease referred for assessment for home oxygen therapy. Subjects had a mean (SD) FEV, of 0 81 (0 31) litre and an FEV,/FVC of 37 % (12 %). There was reasonable agreement between predicted and measured values (mean difference [predicted-measured] =- 2 - 5 %) but the prediction was not precise as the 95 ° % confidence interval for the difference was + 8 % to- 13 %. The duration of arterial oxygen desaturation, defined {{as the percentage of}} total sleep time spent below a given Sao 2, was not predicted accurately. It is concluded that nocturnal arterial oxygen desaturation in individual patients with chronic obstructive lung disease cannot be predicted from "awake " measurements with sufficient accuracy to be clinically useful.

40|$|AbstractVagus nerve {{stimulation}} is an empirically based method {{for treatment of}} epilepsy by repeated stimulation of the left vagus nerve through implanted electrodes. Despite studies in animals and man, which show changes in brain electrophysiology, metabolism and neurochemistry, the mode of action remains unknown. Clinical testing has presented methodological challenges, as {{it is difficult to}} assess under double blind conditions a treatment which requires surgery and produces a sensation every time the stimulator comes on. This has nevertheless been successfully addressed in parallel design, controlled trials comparing high and low stimulation schedules. These have been performed in adults with medically intractable partial seizures, and demonstrated efficacy, safety and good tolerability. Efficacy, both in the controlled trials and in numerous reports arising from the considerable post-marketing experience is modest. Some 30 % of patients achieve a 50 % seizure reduction after 3 months of treatment, but this proportion progressively increases to about 50 % after 18 months. Side-effects comprise: discomfort in the face or neck when the stimulator is activated, coughing, breathlessness on exertion and hoarseness of voice. All are related to intensity of stimulation and rapidly habituate in most subjects. In those patients who respond, a stimulus level can therefore generally be found which is acceptable to the <b>subject.</b> No <b>indication</b> other than refractory partial seizures in adults {{has been the subject of}} controlled trials, but post-marketing experience and uncontrolled reports indicate comparable efficacy and safety in a wide range of epilepsies, partial and generalized, idiopathic, cryptogenic, or symptomatic, in patients of all ages...|$|R

Lipoprotein-particle subclasses may also have an effect, but comparative data after standard HAART regimens are limited. Methods: This was a substudy of a trial in 91 antiretroviral-naïve patients randomized to tenofovir + emtricitabine + atazanavir/ritonavir (ATV/r) or efavirenz (EFV). Over-time trends from baseline to week 48 in total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), HDL particles (HDLp), and TC:HDL-C and TG:HDL-C ratios were analyzed by analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). Furthermore, confidence intervals for differences between the 2 groups at week 48 were calculated. Indications for lipid-lowering interventions and low HDL-C were also studied. Results: ANCOVA showed that, with respect to patients receiving ATV/r, those prescribed efavirenz (EFV) had greater increases reported as mean differences in lipid values at week 48 : 14 mg/dL (95 % CI, 0. 2 to 27) for TC, 14 mg/dL (95 % CI, 4 to 25) for LDL-C, 5 mg/dL (95 % CI, 2 to 9) for HDL-C, and 2. 2 mg/dL (95 % CI, 0. 4 to 4) for large HDLp.

30|$|It {{has been}} {{controversial}} {{for a long}} time whether additional use of IABP could improve survival or not [14 – 17]. As previous study included <b>subjects</b> for all <b>indications,</b> confounding factors might be induced when interpreting the yield of combined use of VA-ECMO and IABP. Moreover, previous studies on VA-ECMO in subjects with PCS did not concern about the time sequence for initiating VA-ECMO and IABP. In this study, we took the time sequence of initiation of VA-ECMO and IABP into consideration, so we found concurrent initiation of IABP with VA-ECMO could bring better outcomes. As we know, VA-ECMO increases left ventricular (LV) afterload and decreases the blood flow in coronary artery due to retrograde blood flow, which potentially deteriorates cardiac function. An IABP could reduce LV afterload and increase the blood flow of coronary artery by providing pulsatile flow through inflating during diastole and deflating during systole. Additionally, in such condition as PCS, surgical procedure refined the structural defect of the diseased heart. Reduced LV afterload and increased the blood flow of coronary artery would promote myocardial recovery Therefore, it could improve survival when initiating IABP concurrently with VA-ECMO in such subgroups of patients with PCS.|$|R

It would be easy to spend the entire year simply translating all the instructions for the different tools in the shop, but this would provide little indication of what the tools could be used for, and by extension, why people {{thought it was a good}} idea to invent them in the first place. We will certainly spend a great deal of time on familiarizing ourselves with the language and basic tools of algebraic geometry, but we will also try to motivate this technical <b>subject</b> with some <b>indication</b> of how the tools can be applied to concrete and classical questions. The sheer scale of the subject mandates that we take many shortcuts along the way, but it is my hope that you will emerge with not only a mastery of the technical underpinnings of modern algebraic geometry, but with some intuition for these topics, as well as a sense of some of the central theorems and problems in the field...|$|R
40|$|Aims: 1) To {{assess the}} {{feasibility}} of EPAGE criteria in clinical practice; 2) To assess appropriateness colonoscopy using EPAGE criteria; 3) To compare colonoscopy appropriateness and endoscopic lesions. Method: Hundred thirtynine consecutive patients explored by colonoscopy were included. The appropriateness of colonoscopy was evaluated by EPAGE criteria. Results: EPAGE criteria were applicable among 127 patients (91 % of the cases). Colonoscopies were appropriate, uncertain and inappropriate in respectively 40 %; 27 % and 24 % of the cases. Rate of abnormal colonoscopies was significantly different between the 3 groups (p = 0. 03). Cancers were diagnosed exclusively in the groups with appropriate and uncertain colonoscopies (11 % and 5 %). Colonic adenomas were observed in the three groups (appropriate (7 %), uncertain (5 %) and inappropriate (6 %)). <b>Subjects</b> with uncertain <b>indication</b> were older (58. 25 years; p = 0. 035). Conclusion: EPAGE criteria are feasible in clinical practice in Cocody’s teaching hospital center. Colonoscopies are generally appropriate in our hospital. However, {{within sight of the}} significant number of normal colonoscopies and discovered lesions in uncertain indication, colonoscopy cannot concern exclusively calculation of a score of appropriateness...|$|R
40|$|According to {{international}} surveys, {{half of the}} <b>subjects</b> with <b>indications</b> for statin therapy are treated and half the treated subjects is still adherent after six month from starting therapy. Poor adherence to statin therapy is the main factor of cardiovascular prevention failure and healthcare costs increase. Unfortunately, tools to support stakeholders in monitoring current medical practice are unavailable. The aim of our work was to perform a population-based retrospective analysis to evaluate the characteristics of patients treated with statins and their adherence to treatment through the linkage of administrative databases of the LHS of Ferrara (approximately 350, 000 beneficiaries). All subjects aged ≥ 18 years receiving at least a prescription for statins between January 1 st, 2004 and June 31 st, 2005 were enrolled. In each subject we recorded age, sex, concurrent chronic therapy, previous hospital admissions and, starting from the first prescription, a treatment profile in the following 6 months. Adherent subjects were defined as having a PDD-standardized (mean daily dose/PDD) ≥ 0. 8. The pharmacological patterns were compared among three periods lasting 6 months each. Treated subjects decreased from 20, 445 and 20. 221 {{of the first two}} periods to 17, 756 of the third period mainly for reduction of newly treated subjects (from 5, 108 and 4342 to 3, 688). Newly treated in the third period were more frequently male, older and showed a higher prevalence of concurrent drug treatments and of previous cardiovascular hospitalizations. Adherent subjects increased from 29, 7 % and 31. 9 % in first two periods to 45, 4 % in third period (OR 1, 648, CI 1. 579 - 1. 721, p< 0. 001). Poor adherence was associated with younger age, lower prevalence of concurrent drug treatments and of previous cardiovascular hospitalizations. Adequate systems are required to monitor and assess actual practice, to highlight and size critical areas, to account stakeholders for practice improvement through adherence to standard rather than for cost containment...|$|R
40|$|In this {{functional}} MRI (fMRI) study, {{we investigated}} ageing effects on motor skill learning. We applied an adapted {{version of the}} serial reaction time (SRT) task to extensive groups of young (N = 26) and elderly (N = 40) <b>subjects.</b> Since <b>indications</b> have been provided for age-related shrinkage of brain regions assumed to be critical to motor skill learning, we tested the hypothesis that age effects on implicit sequence learning are larger on a neurofunctional level than on a behavioural level. The SRT task consisted of two identical scan sessions, in which subjects had to manually trail an asterisk appearing serially in one of four spatial positions by means of button-pressing. Reliable response time reductions were already found in the first session for both {{the young and the}} elderly groups, when comparing a fixed sequence condition to a random sequence. but the learning effect was greater for the young subjects. In the second session, though, both groups showed a similar degree of learning. This indicates that implicit sequence learning is still intact in elderly adults, but that the rate of learning is somewhat slower. Reliable learning-related changes in brain activity were also observed. A similar network of brain regions was recruited by both groups during the fixed compared to the random sequence, involving several regions that have been previously associated with implicit sequence learning. including bilateral parietal, and frontal regions, the supplementary motor area (SMA), cerebellum and the basal ganglia. The direct group comparison did not reveal any differences in brain activity. In addition, we did not observe any significant differences in activity when comparing the different sessions either, neither for the young nor for the elderly subjects. Hence, we did not find indications for an age-related functional reorganisation of neural networks involved in motor sequence learning. In view of earlier reports of pronounced ageing effects on the performance on declarative memory tasks, our finding of age-related sparing of processes that sustain motor skill learning. provides further support for the proposition of different memory systems relying on different brain substrate...|$|R
40|$|To {{assess the}} iron status among European {{adolescents}} through selected biochemical parameters in a cross-sectional study performed in 10 European cities. SUBJECTS/METHODS: Iron status was defined utilising biochemical indicators. Iron depletion {{was defined as}} low serum ferritin (SF 8. 5 mg/l) plus iron depletion. Iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) was defined as ID with haemoglobin (Hb) below the WHO cutoff for age and sex: 12. 0 g/dl for girls and for boys aged 12. 5 - 14. 99 years and 13. 0 g/dl for boys aged ¿ 15 years. Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay was used as analytical method for SF, sTfR and C-reactive protein (CRP). <b>Subjects</b> with <b>indication</b> of inflammation (CRP > 5 mg/l) {{were excluded from the}} analyses. A total of 940 adolescents aged 12. 5 - 17. 49 years (438 boys and 502 girls) were involved. RESULTS: The percentage of iron depletion was 17. 6 %, significantly higher in girls (21. 0 %) compared with boys (13. 8 %). The overall percentage of ID and IDA was 4. 7 and 1. 3 %, respectively, with no significant differences between boys and girls. A correlation was observed between log (SF) and Hb (r = 0. 36, P < 0. 01), and between log (sTfR) and mean corpuscular haemoglobin (r = - 0. 30, P < 0. 01). Iron body stores were estimated on the basis of log (sTfR/SF). A higher percentage of negative values of body iron was recorded in girls (16. 5 %) with respect to boys (8. 3 %), and body iron values tended to increase with age in boys, whereas the values remained stable in girls. CONCLUSIONS: To ensure adequate iron stores, specific attention should be given to girls at European level to ensure that their dietary intake of iron is adequate.
