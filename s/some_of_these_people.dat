5|$|The Ulster Scots {{people are}} {{an ethnic group}} of British origin in Ireland, broadly descended from Lowland Scots who settled in large numbers in the Province of Ulster during the planned process of colonisations of Ireland {{which took place in}} the reign of James VI of Scotland and I of England. Together with English and Welsh settlers, these Scots {{introduced}} Protestantism (particularly the Presbyterianism of the Church of Scotland) and the Ulster Scots and English languages to, mainly, northeastern Ireland. With the partition of Ireland and independence for what is now the Republic of Ireland <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> found themselves no longer living within the United Kingdom.|$|E

50|$|The {{vicinity}} of Vincennes was inhabited {{for thousands of}} years by different cultures of indigenous peoples. During the Late Woodland period, <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>peoples</b> used local loess hills as burial sites; <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the more prominent examples are the Sugar Loaf Mound and the Pyramid Mound. In historic times, prominent local native groups were the Shawnee, Wabash, and the Miami tribe.|$|R
50|$|There is archaeological {{evidence}} that the Saugeen Complex people, a Hopewell-influenced group who were located on the Bruce Peninsula during the Middle Woodland period, may have evolved into the Odawa people. The Hopewell tradition was a widely extended trading network operating from about 200BCE to 500 CE. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>peoples</b> constructed earthwork mounds for burials, a practice that ended about 250 CE. The Saugeen mounds have not been excavated.|$|R

25|$|Before {{the larger}} wave of {{migration}} during the British colonial era, a significant group of South Asians, {{especially from the}} west coast (Sindh, Surat, Konkan and Malabar) travelled regularly to South East Africa, especially Zanzibar. It is believed that they travelled in Arab dhows, Maratha Navy ships (under Kanhoji Angre), and possibly Chinese junks and Portuguese vessels. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> settled in South-East Africa and later spread to places like present day Uganda, and Mozambique. Later they mingled with the much larger wave of South Asians who came with the British.|$|E
25|$|Prior to {{conversion}} in the 19th {{century to}} Christianity by Welsh Baptist missionaries, the Chin, Kuki, and Mizo peoples were animists; among their practices were ritual headhunting. Since the late 20th century, <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>peoples</b> have begun following Messianic Judaism. The Bnei Menashe {{are a small}} group who started studying and practicing Judaism since the 1970s in a desire to return to {{what they believe is}} the religion of ancestors.

25|$|One of {{the results}} of the {{persecution}} in England was that some people fled Great Britain to be able to worship as they wished – but they did not seek religious freedom, and early North American colonies were generally as intolerant of religious dissent as England; Puritan Massachusetts, for example, did not allow standard Church of England worship. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> voluntarily sailed to the American Colonies specifically for this purpose. After the American Colonies famously revolted against King George III of the United Kingdom, the Constitution of United States was specifically amended to ban the establishment of religion by Congress.|$|E
25|$|Methamphetamine induces a {{psychosis}} in 26–46 {{percent of}} heavy users. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> develop a long-lasting psychosis that can persist {{for longer than}} six months. Those {{who have had a}} short-lived psychosis from methamphetamine can have a relapse of the methamphetamine psychosis years later after a stress event such as severe insomnia or a period of heavy alcohol abuse despite not relapsing back to methamphetamine. Individuals who have long history of methamphetamine abuse and who have experienced psychosis in the past from methamphetamine abuse are highly likely to rapidly relapse back into a methamphetamine psychosis within a week or so of going back onto methamphetamine.|$|E
25|$|Calls for {{reinforcements}} {{from the}} newly established Kingdom of Jerusalem, and Pope Paschal II, successor to Pope Urban II (who died before learning {{of the outcome of}} the crusade that he had called), urged a new expedition. He especially urged those who had taken the crusade vow but had never departed, and those who had turned back while on the march. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> were already scorned at home and faced enormous pressure to return to the east; Adela of Blois, wife of Stephen, Count of Blois, who had fled from the Siege of Antioch in 1098, was so ashamed of her husband that she would not permit him to stay at home.|$|E

50|$|From the {{earliest}} days of the township, an important element in the Normanton community was the variety of cultures that were evident. As well as the pioneering European settlers, in themselves a diverse cultural group, a significant minority of Chinese immigrants were attracted to the area through the Croydon goldfields. Fringe camps of Aboriginal peoples, originally located on the northern side of the Norman River, developed into large groups by the turn <b>of</b> the century. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>peoples</b> were removed to reserves on Mornington Island in 1914 and Doomadgee in 1936. Fringe camps endured and were similar in character to those found in other townships of the Gulf region.|$|R

25|$|At {{the start}} of the 20th century the town was growing fast. New roads were laid out in Callowland (North Watford) and in West Watford, on what had been until then farmland. However, a lot of people still lived in the older cramped and unsanitary houses in the yards and alley-ways opening off the High Street. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> were among those who rioted in 1902 when {{celebrations}} for the King's coronation were postponed. The Council had a programme of slum clearance and was building council houses when the outbreak of war in 1914 brought this to a halt. This work resumed after the war and in the 1920s the Harebreaks estate was developed.|$|E
25|$|In Brunei Sultanate, {{many of the}} Muslim {{subjects}} of the Sultan were converts from local Dayak groups. Acculturation had also taken place in Sarawak and Northern Borneo (modern day Sabah), where Brunei Sultanate and by the 18th century the Sulu Sultanate were collecting products for China and other markets, and establishing a fairly loose, river based governmental presence. Dayak chiefs were incorporated into the Brunei hierarchy, being given Malay titles such as Datuk, Temenggong and Orang Kaya. What had once been independent villages were gradually built into wider units, and their leaders co-opted into {{the hierarchy of the}} polity. A colonial writing about Sarawak, observed that many non-Malays would be amazed to learn {{the degree to which the}} present Malay population derives from the local native sources, and among the latter are Sea (Iban) and Land Dayaks (Bidayuh). In northeastern Borneo, the Bulungan Malays appear to be of Kayan origin. Further down the east coast, the Paser polity had extended its influence into the Barito-speaking Dayak, and <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> became Muslim and were eventually referred to as 'Paser Malays'. In southern Borneo, the Malay-speaking Sultanate of Banjar had been pushing inland since the 17th century, bringing Dayaks into its Muslim culture. In the west, the development of such sultanates of Sambas, Sukadana and Landak tells a similar tale of recruitment among Dayak people.|$|E
25|$|The {{impact of}} the Roman conquest on these people is uncertain. One {{hypothesis}} {{was that they were}} effectively eliminated. An important clue to the character of Dacian casualties is offered by the ancient sources Eutropius and Crito. Both speak about men when they describe the losses suffered by the Dacians in the wars. This suggests that both refer to losses due to fighting, not due to a process of extermination of the whole population. A strong component of the Dacian army, including the Celtic Bastarnae and the Germans, had withdrawn rather than submit to Trajan. Some scenes on Trajan's Column represent acts of obedience of the Dacian population, and others show the refugee Dacians returning to their own places. Dacians trying to buy amnesty are depicted on Trajan's Column (one offers to Trajan a tray of three gold ingots). Alternatively, a substantial number may have survived in the province, although were probably outnumbered by the Romanised immigrants. Cultural life in Dacia became very mixed and decidedly cosmopolitan because of the colonial communities. The Dacians retained their names and their own ways {{in the midst of the}} newcomers, and the region continued to exhibit Dacian characteristics. The Dacians who survived the war are attested as revolting against the Roman domination in Dacia at least twice, in the period of time right after the Dacian Wars, and in a more determined manner in 117 AD. In 158 AD, they revolted again, and were put down by M. Statius Priscus. Some Dacians were apparently expelled from the occupied zone at the end of each of the two Dacian Wars, or otherwise emigrated. It is uncertain where these refugees settled. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> might have mingled with the existing ethnic Dacian tribes beyond the Carpathians (the Costoboci and Carpi).|$|E

The Basotho group is also the major ethnic group in Lesotho. The Tswana ethnic group constitute {{the majority of the}} population of Botswana. The Swazi ethnic group is the major ethnic group in Swaziland. A part of the Zulu ethnic group is also found in Matabeleland in Zimbabwe, where they are known as the Matabele. <b>These</b> Ndebele <b>people</b> are the descendants of a Zulu faction under the warrior Mzilikazi that escaped persecution from Shaka during the Mfecane by migrating to their current territory. The Tsonga ethnic group is also found in southern Mozambique, where they are known as the Shangaan.|$|R
500|$|Most {{were forced}} to convert due to the {{systematic}} abuse and discrimination inflicted upon them by followers of Islam. [...] Once a Zoroastrian family was forced to convert to Islam, the children were sent to an Islamic school to learn Arabic and study the teachings of Islam, as a result <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> lost their Zoroastrian faith. However, under the Samanids, who were Zoroastrian converts to Islam, the Persian language flourished. On occasion, the Zoroastrian clergy assisted Muslims in attacks against those who they deemed Zoroastrian heretics.|$|E

[...] It's like beating a dead horse at this point, but at the time Britney Spears was just coming out. But I still think it's relevant." [...] Joe D'Angelo of MTV News wrote that [...] "fans will get to see Amy Lee like never before. Instead of her homemade wings and signature gothic garb, the clip finds Lee dressed alternately as a wholesome teenager, a kitschy pop idol and a softly lit glamazon." [...] Amy Lee portrays the life of a model who promotes products by a company called [...] "Lies". The music video focuses on the struggles that Lee's character suffers with because of her modeling career and her opposite lifestyle.|$|E

Luna, Jansen, Whitehead, and Birdsell reprise their roles from {{earlier in the}} series. When asked whether the series still wanted to pursue stories about Inhumans such as James, Whedon said they are [...] "still in our world, so we still have <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> in the mix ... but right now we’re on the Ghost Rider kick."

500|$|In August 2015, Bloomberg {{reported}} that Kaspersky Lab changed course in 2012. According to the publication, [...] "high-level managers have left or been fired, their jobs often filled {{by people with}} closer ties to Russia’s military or intelligence services. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> actively aid criminal investigations by the FSB using data {{from some of the}} 400 million customers". Bloomberg and The New York Times also said Kaspersky was less aggressive about identifying cyberattacks originating from Russia than from other countries, allegations Kaspersky refutes. For example, he allegedly ignored or downplayed a series of denial-of-service attacks in December 2011 that were made to disrupt online discussion criticizing Russian politicians. Kaspersky also allegedly ignored a Russian-based spyware called Sofacy, which {{is believed to have been}} used by Russia against NATO and Eastern Europe. On the other hand, Kaspersky also published information on the Russia-based Crouching Yeti cyberattacks two days before Bloomberg accused him of ignoring Russia-based cyberattacks. At the time, the company had published eleven reports on malicious Russian programs. Competitor FireEye said it is awkward even in the U.S. to investigate cybercrimes performed by one's own government.|$|E
500|$|Vane {{lost his}} {{position}} to the elder John Winthrop in the 1637 election. The contentious election {{was marked by}} a sharp disagreement over the treatment of John Wheelwright, another Hutchinson supporter. [...] Winthrop won {{in part because the}} location of the vote was moved to Cambridge, reducing the power of Vane's Boston support. [...] In the aftermath of the election Anne Hutchinson was put on trial, and eventually banished from the colony. [...] Many of her followers seriously considered leaving after the election. [...] At the urging of Roger Williams, <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>people,</b> including Hutchinson, founded the settlement of Portsmouth on Aquidneck Island in the Narragansett Bay (later named Rhode Island and joined to Providence to form the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations). [...] Vane decided to return to England, apparently with the notion that he would acquire a royal governorship to trump the colonial administration. [...] Before his departure, he published A Brief Answer to a Certain Declaration, a response to Winthrop's defense of the Act of Exclusion; this act was passed after the election to restrict the immigration of people with views not conforming to the colony's religious orthodoxy.|$|E
500|$|With {{the number}} one draft pick {{described}} as a [...] "poisoned chalice" [...] by the Herald Sun journalist, Jon Anderson, Watts has been continually compared to the players who were drafted after him and who rivalled him for {{the number one}} pick, especially the number two pick, Nic Naitanui. The choice to choose Watts over Naitanui {{has been one of}} the most talked about draft decisions, with many deeming the decision to be incorrect, especially considering Naitanui's impact for West Coast which included earning All-Australian honours in just his fourth season. Daniel Rich at the time was also considered a potential first pick; with Rich winning the AFL Rising Star in his first year, the choice by Melbourne to recruit Watts was further questioned. Despite the comparisons to other players, many people in the media believe the label of [...] "number one draft pick" [...] placed too much unfair expectation on Watts, which he would never be able to live up to; <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> include former player Nathan Brown, The Age journalists, Greg Baum and Brent Diamond, and former coaches, Mark Neeld and Paul Roos, who both said being the number one draft pick set him up to fail.|$|E
