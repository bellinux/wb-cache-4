25|$|In January 2008 the South African {{government}} {{announced that it}} would introduce electricity rationing. On 25 January 2008 the country's deepening power crisis was such that South Africa's (and the world's) largest gold and platinum mining companies were forced to shut down operations. Eskom (the national power supplier) and the government both apologised for the blackouts and in his next-to-last State of the Nation speech Mbeki devoted nearly three pages to the electricity crisis, repeating the apologies of Eskom and the government. Mbeki blamed the power shortages on increased demand caused by years of economic growth and the provision of electricity to black townships that were not connected in the apartheid era. But Mbeki also admitted the government had failed to heed warnings from Eskom (the earliest 10 years previously) that without new power stations Eskom {{might not be able to}} meet demand by 2007. Each year over the preceding 10 years, Eskom had produced annual Integrated Strategic Electricity Plans each setting out scenarios of future investment requirements to cope with projected increased demand, but although projections of average demand growth in the period 2001–2005 had been accurate, no investment had been forthcoming. Mbeki failed to respond to allegations that the government's black empowerment strategy had been a root cause of the problem in that small and medium sized black entrepreneurs, in preference to large corporations, had been awarded coal supply tenders. The policy of giving preference to <b>small</b> <b>suppliers</b> had caused problems in securing reliable supplies of coal, and had also, because <b>small</b> <b>suppliers</b> did not have the capital to invest in rail or conveyor belts infrastructure but used coal trucks, accelerated the wear and tear damage to the roads around the power stations. Warnings highlighted in several of Eskom's annual reports, starting in 2003, had been ignored not only by the Eskom board but also its political masters, Mbeki's government.|$|E

40|$|Purpose of {{the paper}} and {{literature}} addressed: The {{purpose of this paper}} is to empirically investigate the developing interaction capabilities of <b>small</b> export <b>suppliers</b> in term of export involvement and how they influence their relationships with importers. Prior studies in the business to business marketing (Johnsen and Ford, 2006) and in the international marketing (Lages et al., 2009 and Pagano, 2009) have explored that relational capabilities are important, which influence the positions and strategies of international firms within their network. However, there has been lack of empirical research in the area of developing relational capabilities of <b>small</b> export <b>suppliers</b> in term of export involvement and their influence on relationships with importers. Research Method: It has investigated developing interaction capabilities within 10 <b>small</b> export <b>suppliers</b> in Turkey regarding export involvement. It is purposed to contribute to the knowledge of relational capabilities from international relationship perspective. Research Findings: The research findings have revealed that the level of export involvement with importer much depends upon the interaction capabilities held by <b>small</b> export <b>suppliers.</b> Developing interaction capabilities draw importers’ attention and provide opportunities to <b>small</b> export <b>suppliers</b> for being nominated and offered a better positioning in importers’ networks. Main Contribution: The paper contributes to the knowledge of interaction capabilities from an international perspective, export involvement of <b>small</b> export <b>suppliers</b> in particular. In addition, the paper suggests how <b>small</b> export <b>suppliers</b> can increase the level of export involvement by developing interaction capabilities through the enhancement of relationships with importers.

50|$|As About 6 tehsils lies under Churu {{district}} (Taranagar, Sardarshehar, Rajgarh, Rattangarh, Sujangarh, Bidasar (new)) {{with more}} than 900 villages along with 248 panchayats and about 20 lac population, {{the economy of the}} town and surrounding area is mainly based on animal husbandry and hand embroidery work done by women. Due to climatic conditions, the scope of agriculture is very low in Churu. Also, more than 2 lac women do hand embroidery in Churu district itself. They tie designs on the cloth by the help of needle and nylon threads. After the cloth is coloured they again tie the knots on the cloth and finally again with the help of needle, thread and different types of beads, sitaras, mirror, pearls, and stitches they do the hand embroidery work on the coloured tie dyed fabric which makes the stuff much more decorative. The embroidery work depends on the sale price of the bandhani and the demand of the market. Many <b>small</b> <b>suppliers</b> depend on the women working here. These suppliers finally collect the fabric and deliver to the big wholesalers, retailers and exporters. These big people fetch a good price from the consumer only because the odani/bandhani/chunni they are selling is 100% hand made. But the women working hard behind this process are earning very little.|$|E
40|$|This study {{sets out}} to {{investigate}} the relationship development impacts on <b>small</b> <b>suppliers</b> and their larger customers in the Taiwanese electronics industry. More precisely, this research's principal goal is to outline a framework for relationship development of <b>small</b> <b>suppliers</b> and their larger customers in the Taiwanese electronics network. Recent {{research has shown that}} <b>small</b> <b>suppliers</b> may face a range of problems in their relationship with larger customers (Blomqvist, 2002; Johnsen and Ford, 2002; Johnsen, 2005). This research examines the relationship development impacts of relationship characteristics of <b>small</b> <b>suppliers</b> and their larger customers on the process of development of these relationships in the Taiwanese electronics industry. The chosen study method involves a phenomenologicalapproach using case studiesof the relationships of <b>small</b> <b>suppliers</b> and their larger customers in the Taiwaneseelectronics industry. Individual in-depth interviews in both customer and supplier firms with directors or managers who have been closely involved in the relationship are employed to collect relevant primary data. Through the literature review, a classification of relationship characteristicsof <b>small</b> <b>suppliers</b> and larger customers is developed and a relationship development stage model identified (Ford, 1980). A conceptual model of the relationship development impacts of relationship characteristics of <b>small</b> <b>suppliers</b> and larger customers on their relationship developmentprocessis developed, and guidesthe empirical study. Five sets of small supplier and larger customer relationships are examined. From each supplier organisation five persons are interviewed e. g. president, managing director, and marketing manager. Also five individuals in each of the customer organisations are interviewed e. g. vice-managing director, purchasing managerand others involved in supplier relationships. In total, there are 50 participants in 49 interviews, (since Case B supplier side had two participants interviewed together). The researcher analyses the findings from these five sets of customer and supplier relationships through the use of analysis matrices. The premise of this research is to provide a better assessmentof the relationship development impacts on the relationship characteristics of <b>small</b> <b>suppliers</b> and their larger customers on the process of relationship development in the Taiwanese electronics industry. It is hoped that this study can benefit <b>small</b> <b>suppliers</b> by developing a set of managerial lessons from the study concerning relationship development with larger customers in the Taiwanese electronics market. Furthermore, the research provides indicators that different types of relationship development impacts on the relationship characteristics may influence the relationship development process between <b>small</b> <b>suppliers</b> and their larger customers at different stagesof relationship. ...|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn {{seeking to}} {{understand}} relationships between <b>smaller</b> <b>suppliers</b> and larger customers, {{there is a}} growing interest in examining the characteristics of asymmetry in relationships. However, there is a paucity of research that looks at the consequences of size asymmetry for <b>smaller</b> <b>suppliers.</b> Building on IMP (Industrial Marketing and Purchasing Group) research, this paper presents a typology for analysing the consequences of size asymmetry in customer-supplier relationships from the <b>smaller</b> <b>supplier's</b> perspective. The paper reports on the findings from a study involving a total of 48 interviews and eight in-depth case studies of suppliers in the UK textile industry involved in relationships with larger customers. The findings from the study show that the consequences of size asymmetry may vary widely across different relationship characteristics, with both positive and negative outcomes for suppliers. The implications of these findings are that suppliers may take advantage of the positive and constructive consequences of size asymmetry to capitalise on developing their current relationships with customers. In addition, by focusing on the positive consequences of size asymmetry, suppliers may develop the confidence and assurance to develop constructive and more balanced new customer relationships. The paper concludes by identifying the managerial implications for the development of opportunities and customer relationship options for suppliers in asymmetric relationships and proposes that it is important for suppliers to have an assessment instrument to identify the extent of asymmetry or symmetry across their customer relationships...|$|R

40|$|We {{examine a}} novel, but {{economically}} important, characterization of trade credit relationships in which large investment-grade buyers borrow from their <b>smaller</b> <b>suppliers.</b> Using a matched sample of large retail buyers and their much <b>smaller</b> <b>suppliers,</b> {{we find that}} slower payment terms by large retailers are associated with lower investment at the supplier level. The effects are sharpest during periods of tight bank credit and for firms which we might otherwise characterize as financially constrained. The opportunity cost of extending credit to large buyers appears to be positive and sharply increasing in the financial frictions facing a firm. (JEL G 20, G 30, G 31, G 32) As of 2009, trade payables—financing {{for the purchase of}} goods extended by suppliers to their customers—represented the second largest liability on the aggregate balance sheet of nonfinancial businesses in the United States (U. S. Flow of Funds Account 2011). Yet relative to its volume as a source of corporate funding, there has been limited research on the effects of trade credit relationships on other financial and real activities of the firm. Why is so much financing in a well-developed capital market done by nonfinancial firms? The existing literature on trade credit suggests that financial constraint may play an important role, with evidence that small, young firms lean on their larger suppliers for funding when access to traditional financial markets is limited (Meltzer’s 1960; Schwartz 1974; Petersen and Rajan 1997). Yet at the same time, we also observe the inverse relationship, one which is harder to reconcile with a story based on financial constraint. Large, highly rated borrowers with unfettered access to capital markets may also borrow via trade credit, often from <b>smaller,</b> weaker <b>suppliers.</b> Walmart, for example, borrows more from its considerably <b>smaller</b> <b>suppliers</b> via trade credit than it does in bank and bon...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (MTech (Information Technology)) [...] Cape Peninsula University of Technology, 2006. This {{research}} {{investigates the}} ordering process between <b>small</b> <b>suppliers</b> and retailers {{and the role}} of the Internet in this process. Product ordering and fulfilment are both important components of a supply chain, of which suppliers and retailers are members. The Internet as an enabling technology has an important role to play in supply chains and therefore also in order processing. Internet technology facilitates Business-to-Business (B 2 B) transactions. Retailers and their suppliers collaborate to align production with customer demands. Internet-enabled B 2 B supports this collaboration between businesses, allowing them to gain knowledge about customer demands real-time. This enables them to determine the impact of these demands on their operations. Using the Internet has the advantage that it provides an ever present link that is less costly than private networks and Electronic Data Interchange (EDI). When the Internet is used to facilitate trade and commerce between businesses, ecommerce is established. With Internet-enabled B 2 B (or B 2 B e-commerce), multiple suppliers are connected to multiple customers. This reduces production cycle times, reduces inventory, improves speed and quality of communications and reduces costs. This research investigates suppliers in the retail supply chain and focuses more specifically on small businesses due to their reported importance in the South African economy. They provide employment to a large portion of the country's population and contribute almost half to the economic activity. <b>Small</b> <b>suppliers</b> form part of supply chains and have to adhere to the demands exerted by larger supply chain members in order to be included in such supply chains. <b>Small</b> <b>suppliers</b> have just as an important role to fulfil in supply chains as larger companies. <b>Small</b> <b>suppliers</b> are also responsible for connecting and integrating supply chain members and in so doing, reduce costs...|$|E
