40|$|Alternatives {{to reduce}} or modify {{nematicide}} use for minimizing groundwater contamination in Easter lily were explored in two field trials. Alternatives to standard 1, 3 -dichloropropene (1, 3 -D) plus phorate injection in the first trial were: (i) delaying applications until after winter rains, (ii) removing roots from planting stock, (iii) 1, 3 -D via drip irrigation, (iv) a chitin-urea soil amendment, (v) the registered insecticide disulfoton, and (vi) several nonregistered nematicides. None of the treatments equaled the standard treatment. In the second trial, potential benefits of adding a <b>systemic</b> <b>nematicide,</b> oxamyl (OX), or a fungicide, metalaxyl (MX), to the standard treatment were explored. Preplant drip irrigation applications of metam sodium (MS), sodium tetrathiocarbonate (ST), and emulsifiable 1, 3 -D were evaluated alone and in combination with postplant applications of OX and MX. Several drip-applied treatments performed comparably to the standard treatment {{with respect to the}} most important criteria of crop quality, bulb circumference. Metam-sodium in combination with either or both OX and MX, 1, 3 -D plus OX and MX, and ST plus OX and MX provided the best results...|$|E
40|$|Avaliou-se o efeito do tratamento com torta de mamona e com nematicidas sistêmicos (aldicarb, carbofurã, oxamil e sulfona de aldicarb), na qualidade das fibras do algodoeiro (Gossypium hirsutum cv. IAC 17) cultivado em área infestada por Meloidogyne incognita, Pratylenchus brachyurus, Helicotylenchus dihysteroides e Xiphinema sp., no nunicípio de Paranapanema, no Estado de São Paulo. As características afetadas foram: o comprimento das fibras, no qual só o carbofurã produziu aumento significativo; a resistência das fibras, que aumentou com os tratamentos torta de mamona e aldicarb; e a maturidade das fibras, onde, com exceção do oxamil, todos os tratamentos foram superiores à testemunha. As características de uniformidade e índice de finura das fibras não diferiram da testemunha em nenhum dos tratamentos. The {{effect of}} {{nematode}} control using castor bean cake and <b>systemic</b> <b>nematicide</b> treatments (Aldicarb, Carbofuran, Oxamyl and Sulfon Aldicarb), on the fiber properties of upland cotton (Gossypium hirsutum cv. IAC 17) was evaluated. The crop was grown in Paranapanema - SP, Brazil, {{in a field}} infested with Meloidogyne incognita, Pratylenchus brachyurus, Helicotylenchus dihysteroides and Xiphinema sp. The properties affected were: fiber length, which improved only with Carbofuran; fiber strength, that improved with the treatments castor bean calce and Aldicarb; and fiber maturity, in which all treatments showed superior results than the check, except Oxamyl. No treatment effects on fiber fineness and uniformity were observed...|$|E
50|$|There {{are several}} causes for the {{increasing}} problem of foliar nematodes in agriculture, greenhouse nurseries, and personal lawns, {{but there are}} no <b>systemic</b> <b>nematicides</b> available to growers due to the hazards they pose to people handling the plants. Advancements in plant breeding have enabled nurseries to produce more vegetative plants, which may cause infection of new plants via propagation from infected plants. Plants are also moved long distance to growers across the country and internationally, thus nematodes can easily spread to new areas where infection was previously not a problem.|$|R
40|$|The first {{written record}} of {{pineapple}} in Hawaii is from 1813. In 1901 commercial pineapple production started, and in 1924 the Experiment Station for pineapple research was established. Nematode-related problems were {{recognized in the}} early 1900 s by N. A. Cobb. From 1920 to approximately 1945 nematode management in Hawaiian pineapple was based on fallowing and crop rotation. During the 1920 s and 1930 s G. H. Godfrey conducted research on pineapple nematode management. In the 1930 s and 1940 s M. B. Linford researched biological control and described several new species of nematodes including Rotylenchulus reniformis. In 1941 nematology and nematode management were advanced by Walter Carter's discovery of the first economical soil fumigant for nematodes, D-D mixture. Subsequently, DBCP was discovered and developed at the Pineapple Research Institute (PRI). Since 1945 soil fumigation has been the main nematode management strategy in Hawaiian pineapple production. Recent {{research has focused on}} the development of the nonvolatile nematicides, their potential as <b>systemic</b> <b>nematicides,</b> and their application via drip irrigation. Current and future research addresses biological and cultural alternatives to nematicide-based nematode management...|$|R
40|$|The spatial {{location}} of the banana (Musa AAA) root parasitic nematodes within three root parts considering two root thickness was determined in three commercial farm management systems, which differ in weed and nematode management. Roots in each farm management system were classified in thick (> 5 mm-d) and thin (1 {{less than or equal}} to 5 mm-d) roots. From each root type, the epidermis, the cortical parenchyma (CP) and the vascular cylinder (VC) were separated by fingernail, and nematodes were extracted by maceration of each root part. Independent of the farm management system, and for either root thickness, highest numbers of Radopholus similis per gram of root was found in the CP, followed by the epidermis and VC. The highest number of Helicotylencus spp., Pratylenchus spp. and the total nematode population per gram of root was found in the epidermis. Considering the number of nematodes per root part, the highest number of R. similis and total nematodes was located in the CP, while Helicotylenchus spp. and Pratylenchus spp. were concentrated in the epidermis. These patterns were approximately reproduced in the two root thickness and in the three farm management systems. This behavior suggests that injection of <b>systemic</b> <b>nematicides</b> into the plant pseudostem to replace the granular applications on surface soil might be promissory. (C) 2004 Elsevier SAS.

40|$|Ten {{populations of}} the cereal cyst {{nematode}} (Heterodera avenge Will.) from the Victorian Mallee and Wimmera districts, were tested for their variation in pathogenicity, using a selected range of cereal species and cultivars as. indicators. The tests were made in a glasshouse between 1967 and 1969. Of the oats used, Avena sterilis and A. strigosa were resistant, but all other cultivars and species were susceptible {{to each of the}} populations. Two barley cultivars, Morocco, and Marocaine 079 were resistant to all populations, but all other barleys used were susceptible. None of the cultivars of wheat was resistant; the spring wheat cv. Loris was very susceptible. Rye cv. South Australian was resistant to all populations. The results indicate that a single biotype of H. avenge is present in Victoria. It appears to be more "aggressive" than any of the biotypes known in Europe. Two hundred and forty cereal species and cultivars (wheat, barley, oats, rye and Triticales) were field. tested for resistance to H. avenge at Sea Lake in the Victorian Mallee between 1966 and 1969. All wheats tested were susceptible to very susceptible, and all Triticales were susceptible. Two barley cultivars Morocco, and Marocaine 079 were resistant and two others moderately resistant. Avena sterilis and A. strigosa were resistant and fifteen cultivars of A. sativa were moderately resistant. Rye cv. South. Australian, posseses a high degree of resistance in contrast to European ryes. The <b>systemic</b> <b>nematicides</b> "Temik" and "Lannate", and the fumigant nematicides ethylene dibromide and dibromochloropropane, were tested for control of H. avenge in a field experiment with Wheat at Sea Lake in the 1968 - 69 season. All chemical treatments reduced white cyst production, and four of the treatments increased grain yield, and reduced nematode carryover. "Temik" (11 kg/ha broadcast), gave the best nematode control and more than trebled grain yield. "Lannate" (13 'kg/ha broadcast) was almost as effective. Dibromochloropropane was an effective nematicide, but was phytotoxic at 56 1 /ha. The <b>systemic</b> <b>nematicides</b> "Temik", "Lannate", "Nemafos", "Vydate", "Nemac ur P", and the contact nematicide "Mocap" were tested for control of H. avenge in field experiments with wheat; at Greenland Dam in the Wimmera (1969 - 70), and at Sea Lake in the Mallee (1969 - 70 to 1971 - 72). In one series of experiments all the nematicides were compared on a broadcast basis. All chemical treatments reduced white cyst production and nematode carryover. Plants from plots treated with "Temik" (9 kg/ha) were always cyst-free. "Mocap" when used at the same rate was severely phytotoxic. Grain from plots treated with "Temik" and "Lannate" at the higher rate (9 kg/ha) were analysed for the presence of chemical residues. No "Lannate" residues were detected, and "Temik" residues were less than 0. 1 ppm. In a second series of experiments, a comparison was made of methods and rates of application of "Temik" and "Lannate". All broadcast nematicide applications, except those at Sea Lake in 1969 - 70, reduced white cyst production and nematode carryover. All nematicide applications with superphosphate in the drill row, except for "Lannate" 0. 3 kg/ha at Sea Lake in 1971 - 72, also reduced white cyst production and nematode carryover. Significant grain yield increases were obtained in each experiment. "Temik" (9 kg/ha broadcast, and 2. 2 kg/ha in the drill row) consistently gave the best control of H. avenge. Plants from plots receiving these treatments were always cyst-free. In all experiments "Lannate" dusted wheat seed provided little, if any, control of H. avenge. When used at comparable rates of application, "Temik" was a more effective nematicide than "Lannate". Restricted Access: University of Melbourne Staff and Students Onl...|$|R
40|$|Wheat {{in winter}} and grain sorghum in summer are the most {{important}} crops of the subtropical grain region of eastern Australia, where they are often grown in sequences of 1 - 4 years of each crop species separated by a long fallow period of 11 - 14 months. Growers have observed that the second wheat crop in sequence can appear nutrient deficient with poor growth and grain yield compared with the first or subsequent crops. To investigate this problem, wheat was grown in various field experiments as the first-fourth wheat in sequence after long fallow from sorghum sequences of various lengths (one-four years) to test for responses in biomass production and grain yield to fertilisers, biocidal fumigants and nematicides. Populations of root-lesion nematodes (Pratylenchus thornei) were greatest in the soil before the second wheat crop was sown than before the first or third wheat crops. Greatest responses in wheat growth were obtained to the nematicide aldicarb in various wheat sequence positions up to the fourth (up to 137 % increased yield of second wheat). Aldicarb best protected the roots from P. thornei allowing increased nutrient response. The fumigants chloropicrin and dazomet caused substantial changes in soil microbial populations and available nutrients, but the <b>systemic</b> <b>nematicides</b> fenamiphos and aldicarb did not. Responses in grain yield were also obtained to N fertiliser and less frequently to P and Zn (41 % increase of second wheat to NPZn fertiliser), with best overall responses to a combination of aldicarb and fertiliser. A range of tolerance to P. thornei, as judged by both grain yield from nil treatment and response to aldicarb and/or fertiliser, was identified among wheat cultivars. In comparison, one barley cultivar yielded maximally without treatment (up to 3. 7 and 1. 3 times the yield of the most intolerant and the most tolerant wheat cultivars, respectively). Integrated management using crop rotation with sorghum to reduce P. thornei populations combined with growing tolerant wheat and barley cultivars supplied with adequate fertiliser are practical measures to reduce the impact of P. thornei. ...|$|R
40|$|Tylenchorhynchus spp. are {{frequently}} associated with poor growth {{of trees and}} shrubs in the initial years of their cultivation in nurseries (Ruehle, 1967; Rossner, 1969). Siris (AZbizia Zebbek L.) Benth., a tree of mixed deciduous forests, is grown in agroforestry and silvi-pastoral systems in India. Near root soil of seedlings and trees in nurseries and fields were found to harbour large population of T. indicus Siddiqi, 196 1.
