25|$|In 1978, Daniel Hechter handed {{control of}} the club to Francis Borelli, under whose {{guidance}} the Red-and-Blues won their first silverware: the Coupe de France in 1982 and 1983 and the league in 1986, during a decade marked by players such as <b>Safet</b> Sušić, Luis Fernández and Dominique Rocheteau.|$|E
25|$|Perhaps more importantly, Sarajevo in {{the late}} 19th and {{throughout}} the 20th century was home to a burgeoning and large center of Sevdalinka record-making and contributed greatly to bringing this historical genre of music to the mainstream, which had for many centuries been a staple of Bosnian culture. Songwriters and musicians such as Himzo Polovina, <b>Safet</b> Isović, Zaim Imamović, Zehra Deović, Halid Bešlić, Hanka Paldum, Nada Mamula, Meho Puzić and many more composed and wrote some of their most important pieces in the city.|$|E
25|$|Promoted by PSG {{president}} Francis Borelli, {{the club}} changed its home identity in 1981–82. The new shirt, worn until 1992–93, was white with {{blue and red}} vertical stripes on the left. PSG legends from the 1980s like <b>Safet</b> Sušić, Luis Fernández and Dominique Bathenay {{are associated with the}} white jersey. It was with this outfit that fans saw the first big PSG team that won two Coupe de France titles (1982, 1983), experienced its first European campaign in 1983, and claimed its maiden league crown in 1986.|$|E
500|$|In December 1941 and January 1942, Chetniks under Dangić's command co-operated {{with the}} Germans in eastern Bosnia. Between December 1941 and April 1942, Dangić engaged in direct {{negotiations}} with the Germans. During {{the latter half of}} December he met with Abwehr representatives numerous times in an effort to reach an agreement with them. In January 1942, Dangić and other Chetnik leaders met with Renzo Dalmazzo, the commander of the Italian 6th Army Corps. By this time, Dangić's cooperation with the Germans came to be seen as being even more valuable because of the arrival of Tito and his First Proletarian Brigade to eastern Bosnia. The Germans and Croats launched Operation Southeast Croatia on 17 January. Dangić and Todorović advised other Chetnik commanders that the operation was targeted at the Partisans, and {{there was no need for}} the Chetniks to get involved. Following this, their units withdrew from their positions on the front line, let the Germans pass through their areas, or went home. Many withdrew across the Drina river into the Territory of the Military Commander in Serbia to avoid being engaged. On 22 January, Dangić ordered his own troops to permit the Germans to pass through Bosnia, saying [...] "they are advancing peacefully and minding their own business without disturbing our unfortunate and long-suffering people." [...] He urged Chetniks and Serbs to annihilate the Ustaše, Croats and Communists. Within a few days, the Germans and Croats succeeded in pushing the Partisans out of eastern Bosnia and southward into the Italian-occupied zone of the NDH. The Chetnik actions in response to Operation Southeast Croatia severely weakened Partisan defences with the result that they suffered significant casualties and lost a great deal of territory. The result was the severing of any remaining cooperative links that remained between the Chetniks and Partisans in eastern Bosnia. In the same month Dangić's staff declared that the Partisans [...] "are led by the Kike Moša Pijade, the Turk <b>Safet</b> Mujić, the Magyar Franjo Vajnert, and that so-and-so Petar Ilić whose real name nobody knows [...] " [...] and announced the shared goal of the Partisans and Ustaše was [...] "to break up and destroy Serbdom. That, and that alone! [...] ". In February, Dangić and other former Royal Yugoslav Army officers re-entered eastern Bosnia from the Territory of the Military Commander in Serbia, where some of them had withdrawn to avoid Operation Southeast Croatia. They started to re-form Chetnik units in eastern Bosnia and began agitating against the Partisans on a [...] "conservative, Serb-nationalist and anti-Muslim basis." ...|$|E
6000|$|This {{isolated}} [...] "Yellow Hill," [...] a [...] "horse" [...] in Icelandic parlance, rising {{about two}} hundred feet above the valley-sole, is separated by a deep, narrow gorge from the adjacent eastern range. The slopes, now water-torn and jagged, may formerly have declined in regular lines, and evidently all were built over to the crest like those of Syrian <b>Safet.</b> The foundations of walls and rock-cut steps are still found even {{on the far side}} of the eastern feature. The knifeback is covered with the foundations of what appears to be a fortified Laura or Palace; a straight street running north-south, with 5 degrees west (mag.). It serves as base for walls one metre and a half thick, opening upon it like rooms: of these we counted twenty on either side. At the northern end of the [...] "horse," [...] which, like the southern, has been weathered to a mere spur, is a work composed of two semicircles fronting to the north and east. A bastion of well-built wall in three straight lines overhangs the perpendicular face of the eastern gorge: in two places there are signs of a similar defence to the south, but time and weather have eaten most of it away. The ground sounds hollow, and the feet sink in the crumbling heaps: evidently the whole building was of Rughám (gypsum); and in the process of decay it has become white as blocks of ice, here and there powdered with snow.|$|E
