A coating of hemocompatible carbon film covers all the exposed, nonbiological surfaces. Optimal preservation of collagen and graft cells is achieved by fresh tissue glutaraldehyde fixation and cusp shaping without mold. Accelerated fatigue testing showed a duration of over 150 million cycles, a figure much higher than that observed when current pericardial and porcine valves were tested with the same apparatus. Results of long-term (greater than 7 months, average 10. 5) implantation in 20 sheep (13 mitral, 7 tricuspid) disclosed no case of mechanical failure, mild to moderate primary calcification in older explants, and significant fibrous tissue overgrowth only in the tricuspid position. Transmission electron microscopy studies revealed collagen and elastic fiber integrity, no significant plasma protein insudation, and well-preserved graft cells. Re-endothelialization by host cells was a regular finding on scanning electronic microscopy. Early ultrastructural nuclei of calcification were seen mostly on collagen fibers. Pericarbon presents basic changes in pericardial valve design, and optimal morphological preservation is obtained after industrial processing. Accelerated fatigue tests in vitro show long duration. At medium long-term animal experimental follow-up, mechanical failure was not observed; significant host tissue reaction occurred in the tricuspid but not in the mitral position; primary calcification increased progressively with time and involved mainly collagen fibers...|$|E
40|$|Small airway {{epithelial}} cells form a continuous <b>sheet</b> <b>lining</b> the conducting airways, which serves many functions including a physical barrier {{to protect the}} underlying tissue. In asthma, injury to {{epithelial cells}} can occur during bronchoconstriction, which may exacerbate airway hyperreactivity. To investigate the role of epithelial cell rupture in airway constriction, laser ablation was used to precisely rupture individual airway epithelial cells of small airways (< 300 -μm diameter) in rat lung slices (∼ 250 -μm thick). Laser ablation of single epithelial cells using a femtosecond laser reproducibly induced airway contraction to ∼ 70 % of the original cross-sectional area within several seconds, and the contraction lasted for up to 40 s. The airway constriction could be mimicked by mechanical rupture of a single epithelial cell using a sharp glass micropipette but not with a blunt glass pipette. These results suggest that soluble mediators released from the wounded epithelial cell induce global airway contraction. To confirm this hypothesis, the lysate of primary human small airway epithelial cells stimulated a similar airway contraction. Laser ablation of single epithelial cells triggered a single instantaneous Ca 2 + wave in the epithelium, and multiple Ca 2 + waves in smooth muscle cells, which were delayed by several seconds. Removal of extracellular Ca 2 + or decreasing intracellular Ca 2 + both blocked laser-induced airway contraction. We conclude that local epithelial cell rupture induces rapid and global airway constriction through release of soluble mediators and subsequent Ca 2 + -dependent smooth muscle shortening.

40|$|Pericarbon is a last-generation bovine pericardial valve bioprosthesis, {{which was}} {{designed}} [I], experimentally tested [2], and introduced into clinical practice [3] in the late 1980 ’s {{with the aim of}} overcoming the main drawback of the Ionescu-Shiley and Vascor Hancock devices, namely mechanical tearing at the commissural level {{even in the absence of}} calcification [4 - 61. The early and medium-term failures observed in these first-generation pericardial valve bioprostheses were unanimously ascribed to limitations of valve design and structural properties, namely poor tissue preservation, the use of the three-leaflet model requiring excessive stitch anchorage to the commissure and tissue wear owing to friction between the leaflet and the Dacron-covered stent. To solve these problems, a single-cusp pericardial device was designed by Gabbay, which consisted of a single leaflet of glutaraldehyde-fixed bovine pericardium mounted on a flexible Delrin stent, covered by a second pericardial sheet [7]. The aims were to reduce the number of leaflet commissures at risk of tearing, to prevent contact between cloth and tissue, and to obtain the largest possible orifice area. However, despite this unquestionable rationale and promising results, both in the experimental models and initial clinical experience [8], subsequent animal [9] and clinico-pathological studies [IO] demonstrated failure of the single-cusp principle: cusp redundancy, primary commissural tears and dystrophic calcification occurred early, which suggests that this device is unsuitable as a cardiac valve substitute. Alternative solutions designed to prolong mechanical resistence at the commissures were attempted with the Carpentier-Edwards and Pericarbon pericardial bioprostheses [12], which incorporated many improvements. The Pericarbon device is characterized by a single, three-cuspal shaped pericardium sheet, which is sutured to a second <b>sheet</b> <b>lining</b> the inner surface of a low-profile, Dacron-covered Delrin frame. The two pericardial sheets are cross-sutured internally to the stents. A coating of hemocompatible Carbotilm covers all the exposed, nonbiological surfaces. The use of two pericardial sheets should allow the creation of a linkages chain with smoothly decreasing elasticity (pericardial leaflet-pericardium lining-Dacron-Delrin stent), with the aim of optimizing the stress reduction. Moreover, pericardiumto- pericardium contact should avoid leaflet abrasion...|$|E

40|$|At the epidermal-dermal {{junction}} of the skin, the basal keratinocytes are stably {{anchored to the}} underlying basement membrane by specific anchoring structures, the hemidesmosomes. For tissue remodelling, like during wound healing or the cycling growth of the hair follicle, epithelial cell migration occurs and the epithelial cells are forced to reorganize their anchoring structures in order {{to respond to the}} new environment. Here, we report that components of the hemidesmosomes, in particular collagen XVII and the tetraspanin CD 151, are involved in the regulation of keratinocyte migration in cooperation with the laminin-binding integrins. We observe that collagen XVII-deficient cells are more motile than normal keratinocytes (Tasanen et al., 2004). The tetraspanin CD 151 is known to form stable complexes with laminin-binding integrins. In the epidermis, CD 151 is associated with alpha 3 beta 1 integrins at cell-cell contacts and with alpha 6 beta 4 integrins in hemidesmosomes. We used a monoclonal antibody against CD 151, TS 151 r, the epitope of which overlaps with the tetraspanin integrin-binding site, to investigate the role of CD 151 in the migration of epithelial cells. Under standard culture conditions, the migratory capacity of epithelial HaCaT cells on laminins is low compared to that of Wi 26 fibroblasts, apparently due to the production of endogenous laminin 5. However, HaCaT cells treated with TS 151 r respond to laminin 1 by an enhanced migration. This event is associated with a disruption of cell-cell contacts and a redistribution of beta 1 and beta 4 integrins. In the hair follicle, free CD 151 is present in cell-cell contacts in the epithelial <b>sheet</b> <b>lining</b> the hair bulb, which is considered to contain migrating cells. Together, these results strongly suggest that integrin-bound CD 151 inhibits cell migration and that dissociation of the CD 151 -integrin complex permits cell migration. In contact with the extracellular matrix, the cells capture information through their integrin membrane receptors, which further transduce the signals to the actin cytoskeleton. Two different laminin isoforms, laminin 1 and 5, activate alpha 6 beta 1 and alpha 3 beta 1 integrins, respectively, in fibroblasts and epithelial cells. Upon adhesion, these cells develop laminin-isoform specific morphology and cell-matrix adhesions, which influence the migration pattern of the cells. On laminin 5, the cells develop lamellipodia and very small vinculin patches and migrate in a polarized manner, while on laminin 1, the same cells form filopodia-like structures and thick vinculin aggregates and migrate in an uncoordinated manner, as shown by immunofluorescence staining and time-lapse videomicroscopy, respectively. In HaCaT epithelial cells, these differences {{can be explained by the}} activation of different Rho GTPases as shown by pull-down assays of activated Rho GTPases. Upon adhesion on laminin 1, Cdc 42 is primarily activated and in the absence of Cdc 42 the cells are not able to spread correctly and to develop strong focal adhesions. In contrast, laminin 5 is an activator of Rac 1 and a down-regulator of RhoA. In a complementary approach, RhoA and Rac 1 were down-regulated in epithelial cells using siRNA. RhoA-deficient HaCaT cells are flat and present small focal complexes, even when plated on laminin 1, while Rac 1 -deficient HaCaT cells have numerous and large focal adhesions on laminin 1 and laminin 5. An enhanced migration on laminin 1 is obtained when RhoA (to a smaller extent Cdc 42) is down-regulated, leading to the development of lamellipodia and tiny focal adhesions. These results show that laminins differentially regulate epithelial cell migration by transducing defined signals via specific membrane receptors. These signals induce the activation of the small Rho GTPases, which participate in the formation of cell morphology and behavior...|$|E
