40|$|A {{detailed}} {{model for}} flue gas desulfurization by <b>spray-dry</b> absorption with a lime slurry is presented. The model combines a steady state one-dimensional spray-dryer {{model with a}} single-drop model for SO 2 absorption with instantaneous irreversible reaction in a rigid droplet containing uniformly dispersed fine lime particles. The fate of the droplets is followed from atomization until formation of a porous coherent shell around the drying droplets. The model results were validated against available experimental <b>spray-dry</b> FGD results, showing excellent agreement at low to medium Ca/S feed ratios. The model was then used to study {{the relevance of the}} different resistances to SO 2 absorption and to predict the influence of the main operating variables on the spray-dryer desulfurization performance. Analysis of variables profiles along the <b>spray-dry</b> column showed that the initial droplet velocity has no influence on model results and that the initial droplets decelerating phase always accounts for negligible SO 2 capture. Results further showed that the controlling resistance to SO 2 absorption shifts from a liquid-phase one near the atomizer to a gas-phase one at the column exit. The operating variables that exert the largest influence on the overall desulfurization efficiency are the Ca/S molar feed ratio, the mean initial droplet size and the mean lime particle size. In particular, careful control of the last two variables is critical in order to obtain a good spray-dryer performance. (C) 2003 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E

During phase I (d 0 to 14), linear· and quadratic improvements occurred in average daily gain and average daily feed intake. No significant differences occurred in feed efficiency for any phase of the eXPeriment. In Trial 2, 68 weanling pigs (12. 7 lb and 21 d of age) were used to determine if supplemental methionine is needed for diets containing high levels of <b>spray-dried</b> porcine plasma. Pigs were fed identical diets containing 20 % dried whey, 7. 5 %spray-dried porcine plasma, and 1. 75 % <b>spray-dried</b> blood meal except that one diet contained 2 lblton supplemental DL-methionine. Pigs receiving diets containing supplemental methionine had improved average daily gain and average daily feed intake during the first week postweaning. Feed efficiency also was improved for the overall trial. In Trial 3, 144 weanling pigs (initially 12. 61 b and 19 d of age) were used in a 21 -d growth trial to evaluate two different sources of <b>spray-dried</b> porcine plasma. Pigs were assigned one of two diets containing 20 % dried whey and 10 % <b>spray-dried</b> porcine plasma. Pigs receiving the diet containing <b>spray-dried</b> porcine plasma obtained from source 1 had improved average daily gain for all phases of the eXPeriment and increased average daily feed intake for d 0 to 14 and d 0 to 21 compared to pigs fed the diet containing spraydried porcine plasma from source 2. There were no differences in feed efficiency. In conclusion, these trials demonstrate three key points concerning <b>spray-dried</b> porcine plasma: 1) starter pig performance is improved linearly with increasing levels of <b>spray-dried</b> porcine plasma through 10 % of the diet; 2) DL-methionine must be added to diets containing high levels of <b>spray-dried</b> porcine plasma to obtain optimal performance; and 3) there are differences in commercially available sources of <b>spray-dried</b> porcine plasma...|$|R
40|$|The {{efficiency}} of two drying carriers, namely whey protein isolate (WPI) and maltodextrin (MD), {{alone or in}} combination, was evaluated during spray-drying of honey. No powder was recovered when pure honey was spray-dried. Honey powders were successfully obtained (powder recovery > 50 %) by adding MD and WPI alone at a Honey: MD ratio of 40 : 60 or at a Honey:WPI ratio of 70 : 30. The addition of {{a small amount of}} WPI (as low as 0. 5 % w/w) to MD reduced the amount of carriers required to <b>spray-dry</b> honey. Powder recovery increased from 0 (Honey:MD:WPI = 60 : 40 : 0) to 57. 4 ± 4. 7 % when MD was replaced by 0. 5 % WPI (Honey:MD:WPI = 60 : 39. 5 : 0. 5). The surface tension of feed solutions, surface elemental composition, and glass transition temperature of spray-dried honey powders was analyzed. The mechanisms of such a significant effect of WPI on spray-drying of honey are attributed to the preferential migration of protein to the droplet/air interface and the limited inward movement of protein during moisture evaporation, in conjunction with excellent skin-forming properties of protein upon drying. Powders' moisture content, water activity, and hygroscopicity were negligibly influenced by different carriers. Bulk density and particle size were positively affected by MD concentration, which might be related to agglomeration process of particles...|$|E
40|$|O objetivo deste trabalho foi estudar a levedura de recuperação (Saccharomyces sp), seca por rolo rotativo (LRRR) ou <b>spray-dry</b> (LRSD), no desempenho de 176 coelhos em crescimento, 88 machos e 88 fêmeas, da raça Nova Zelândia Branco, de 40 a 90 dias de idade. Os animais foram distribuídos em delineamento {{experimental}} em blocos cazualizados, com 11 tratamentos (cinco níveis de cada uma das leveduras: 4, 0; 8, 0; 12, 0; 16, 0; e 20, 0 %) em substituição gradativa da proteína bruta (PB) do farelo de soja (FS) de uma dieta testemunha, com oito repetições de dois animais por unidade experimental. O peso vivo aos 70 dias de idade, o ganho de peso diário e o consumo diário de dieta de 40 a 70 dias de idade diminuíram linearmente, à medida que se elevou o nível de LRRR nas dietas. No período total, de 40 - 90 dias de idade, o consumo diário dos animais que receberam ração com LRRR diminuiu linearmente, com melhora linear na conversão alimentar. A inclusão de LRSD nas dietas não influenciou o desempenho dos coelhos nos níveis estudados. A inclusão de 16 e 20 % de LRRR e LRSD na dieta acarretou em elevada mortalidade dos animais, com quadro de enterite aguda, especialmente no período de 40 a 70 dias de idade. Os dados indicam que a LRSD substituiu mais eficientemente a PB do FS que a LRRR, entretanto, devido à elevada mortalidade, recomenda-se não usar mais que 15 % de inclusão das leveduras estudadas. The {{objective of}} this work was to study the restorative yeast (Saccharomyces sp) dried by rotative roller (RYRR) or by <b>spray-dry</b> (RYSD), {{on the performance of}} 176 growing rabbits, 88 males and 88 females, white New Zealand breed, from 40 to 90 days of age. The animals were distributed in a randomized complete block design, with 11 treatments (five levels of each one yeast: 4. 0, 8. 0 12. 0 16. 0, and 20, 0 %) in gradually replacement of soybean meal (SM) crude protein (CP) of a control diet, with eight replicates and two animals per experimental unit. The live weight at 70 days of age, daily weight gain and the daily diet intake from 40 to 70 days of age decreased linearly as the RYRR level increased in the diet. In the total period, from 40 to 90 days of age, the daily intake of the animals that received RYRR decreased linearly, with linear improvement in the feed:gain ratio. The inclusion of RYSD on the diets did not influence the performance of rabbits in the studied levels. The inclusion of 16 and 20 % of RYRR and RYSD in the diet caused a higher mortality of animals, with acute enterite, especially during the period from 40 to 70 days of age. The data showed that RYSD replaced more efficiently the CP of SM than RYRR. However, due to the high mortality, the recommendation is not to use more than 15 % of inclusion of the studied yeast...|$|E
40|$|Yttria-stabilized {{zirconia}} (YSZ) coatings {{with low}} thermal conductivity were obtained using three different particle size distributions as starting powder: nano-, submicron- and bimodal submicron/nano-sized particles. On the one hand, these particles were reconstituted into micrometric, <b>spray-dry</b> agglomerates, which were subsequently deposited {{by means of}} conventional atmospheric plasma spraying (APS). On the other hand, the starting particles were dispersed in water and the resultant suspensions were deposited by means of suspension plasma spraying (SPS). The coatings were thermally treated to assess their sintering resistance. As-sprayed and thermally treated coatings were then characterized in terms of microstructure (FEG-SEM) and thermal diffusivity (laser flash equipment). The results showed that SPS coatings exhibited extremely low thermal conductivity at low temperature which drastically augmented with increasing temperature. On the other hand, APS coatings also exhibited low thermal conductivities but their values were {{higher than those of}} the SPS coatings at the lowest temperature tested while the conductivities hardly varied with temperature.

40|$|A {{total of}} 420 {{weanling}} pigs {{was used in}} a growth trial having two objectives. Objective 1 was to compare <b>spray-dried</b> avian blood meal and <b>spray-dried</b> bovine blood meal as protein sources in the phase II diet (d 7 - 21 postweaning). Objective 2 {{was to determine the}} appropriate level of dried whey for a phase II diet containing 2. 5 % <b>spray-dried</b> bovine blood meal. During phase I (d 0 - 7 postweaning), all pigs were fed a common high nutrient density pelletized diet containing 1. 5 % lysine, 20 % dried edible grade whey, 7. 5 % <b>spray-dried</b> porcine plasma, and 1. 75 % <b>spray-dried</b> bovine blood meal. All phase II diets were formulated to 1. 25 % lysine,. 9 % Ca, and. 8 % P. In the comparison of avian and bovine <b>spray-dried</b> blood meals, the diets contained 2. 5 % blood meal and 10 % whey. No significant differences occurred in average daily gain (ADG), average daily feed intake (ADFI), or feed to gain ratio (FIG) with use of avian and bovine <b>spray-dried</b> blood meal. The phase II diets comparing different whey levels contained 2. 5 % <b>spray-dried</b> bovine blood meal and whey levels of 5, 10, 15, or 20 % substituted for corn and soybean meal on a protein basis. Linear and quadratic improvements occurred in performance with increasing whey levels for the 21 d growth period. However, linear and quadratic increases in the cost per pound of gain also occurred. In conclusion, avian and bovine blood meal appear to be comparable sources of protein for the phase II diet. Current economics indicate that approximately 10 % whey is the optimal inclusion rate in phase II starter pig diets containing 2. 5 % <b>spray-dried</b> blood meal...|$|R
40|$|A {{total of}} 144 {{weanling}} pigs (initially 14. 1 lb and 24 d of age) {{was used to}} compare three different blood meal sources in starter diets. The three sources included <b>spray-dried</b> porcine, <b>spray-dried</b> bovine, and flash-dried bovine blood meal. Each diet contained 10 % dried whey and 2. 5 % of one of the three blood meal sources. Diets were formulated to contain 1. 25 %lysine and. 31 % methionine. Pigs receiving diets containing either source of <b>spray-dried</b> blood meal had improved average daily gain and feed efficiency during the first 2 weeks of the experiment and the overall trial compared to pigs receiving diets containing the flash-dried source. No differences occurred in pig performance between the two <b>spray-dried</b> sources. Therefore, no apparent effects were due to species differences, but the blood meal must be <b>spray-dried</b> in order to optimize starter pig performance...|$|R
