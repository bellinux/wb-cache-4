In the early 1990s, {{she was in a}} relationship with Bruce Wilson, an official of the Australian Workers' Union (AWU). Gillard provided pro-bono legal assistance to help establish the AWU Workplace Reform Association for Wilson and his associate Ralph Blewitt. She was also involved in providing legal services in relation to the purchase of a Fitzroy property by Wilson and Blewitt. Wilson and Blewitt have been accused of creating the association in order to use a <b>slush</b> fund for personal benefit, including diverting funds for the purchase of the house in Fitzroy.|$|E
5|$|Swift died, aged 44, in the Munich air {{disaster}} after {{reporting on}} Manchester United's European Cup match against Red Star Belgrade in Belgrade, Yugoslavia for the News of the World. On 6 February 1958, the {{flight back to}} Manchester carrying the Manchester United team and journalists made a refuelling stop at Munich-Riem Airport in poor weather. Two take-off attempts were abandoned due to engine problems, with the weather continuing to deteriorate. On the third attempt, <b>slush</b> on the runway prevented the aircraft from reaching the required speed for take-off. The plane veered off the runway and crashed into a house. One of 23 victims of the disaster, Swift {{was one of two}} journalists pulled alive from the wreckage but died on his way to hospital, as his seat belt had cut into his aorta.|$|E
5|$|Spring Brook {{experiences}} noticeable flow loss. As of 2009, it {{has high}} levels of sodium and alkalinity. Pittson Township and the borough of Moosic have permits to discharge stormwater into it. However, the water quality and habitat quality of the stream are relatively unimpacted. The stream has relatively high water quality even where it flows through a concrete channel. In {{a study by the}} Susquehanna River Basin Commission, it was found not to fail any water quality standards either during base flow or storm flow conditions. However, a study from the previous year found concentrations of sodium and alkalinity exceeding the threshold for concern. In the early 1900s, Spring Brook was a clear stream in its upper reaches. However, by the time it reached the property of the Du Pont Powder Company, it was affected by <b>slush</b> pumped into it by the Pennsylvania Coal Company.|$|E

5|$|With Fate and Other Worlds launched, Palmer {{began to}} plan for a new magazine, to be called Imagination. Material {{for the first two}} issues had been {{assembled}} by mid-1950, but in the early summer Palmer fell down his basement stairs and was left paralyzed from the waist down. While he was hospitalized, much of the work of editing both Other Worlds and Imagination was done by Mahaffey, who coped well, despite her inexperience. An assistant, Marge Budwig Saunder, was hired to read the <b>slush</b> pile and help out. The magazine's first issue, dated October 1950 on a planned bi-monthly schedule, appeared on news stands 1 August 1950. However, in September that year, Ziff-Davis made the decision to move to New York from Chicago; Palmer promptly contacted William Hamling, {{who did not want to}} relocate and suggested that Hamling take over Imagination. Like Palmer, Hamling had made preparations to leave Ziff-Davis by establishing a separate publishing company, Greenleaf Publishing, and in November 1950 Hamling left Ziff-Davis and became Imaginations editor and publisher.|$|E
25|$|The Serious Fraud Office was {{reported}} to be considering opening an investigation into an alleged £20 million <b>slush</b> fund on 12 September 2003, the day after The Guardian had published its <b>slush</b> fund story.

25|$|Although {{the crash}} was {{originally}} blamed on pilot error, it was subsequently {{found to have}} been caused by <b>slush</b> {{towards the end of the}} runway, causing deceleration of the aircraft and preventing safe flying speed. During take-off, the aircraft had reached , but, on entering the <b>slush,</b> dropped to , too slow to leave the ground, with not enough runway to abort the take-off. Aircraft with tail-wheel undercarriages had not been greatly affected by <b>slush,</b> due to the geometry of these undercarriages in relation to the aircraft's centre of gravity, but newer types, such as the Ambassador, with nose wheel landing-gear and the main wheels behind the centre of gravity, were found to be vulnerable. The accident resulted in the imposition of operating limits for the amount of <b>slush</b> build-up permitted on runways.|$|E

50|$|While {{the appeal}} was pending, in late 1984 the Campbells reached a verdict with <b>Slusher</b> and Ospital's estate, whereby those parties {{agreed not to}} seek {{satisfaction}} of the judgment against the Campbells, and the Campbells would pursue a bad-faith action against State Farm. The attorneys for <b>Slusher</b> and Ospital's estate would represent the Campbells in the bad-faith suit and would make all major decisions regarding it. No settlement would take effect without the approval of <b>Slusher</b> and Ospital's estate, who would receive 90 percent of any verdict against State Farm.|$|R
25|$|The annual {{snowfall}} is up {{to thirty}} feet (over nine meters). The ski season begins in early November and traditionally ends in late May, on the Victoria Day long weekend, with an event called the <b>Slush</b> Cup. <b>Slush</b> Cup participants attempt to ski {{down in front of}} a very large crowd of crazily dressed spectators, jump onto a pool of water (approx. 50'/ 15m long & 8' / 2.5m deep) and skim across the pool to the other side.

25|$|Exceptional {{circumstances}} do offer exceptional cases: Jupiter's moon Io (which {{is smaller}} {{than any of the}} terrestrial planets) is volcanically dynamic because of the gravitational stresses induced by its orbit, and its neighbor Europa may have a liquid ocean or icy <b>slush</b> underneath a frozen shell also due to power generated from orbiting a gas giant.|$|E
