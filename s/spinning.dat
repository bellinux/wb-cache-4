5|$|A {{tradition}} of cottage <b>spinning</b> and weaving and improvements to <b>spinning</b> technology by local inventors, Richard Arkwright and Samuel Crompton, led to {{rapid growth of}} the textile industry in the 19th century. Crompton, whilst living at Hall i' th' Wood, invented the ] in 1779. Streams draining the surrounding moorland into the River Croal provided the water necessary for the bleach works that were a feature of this area. Bleaching using chlorine {{was introduced in the}} 1790s by the Ainsworths at Halliwell Bleachworks. Bolton and the surrounding villages had more than thirty bleachworks including the Lever Bank Bleach Works in the Irwell Valley. The mule revolutionised cotton <b>spinning</b> by combining the roller drafting of Arkwright's water frame with the carriage drafting and spindle tip twisting of James Hargreaves's <b>spinning</b> jenny, producing a high quality yarn. Self-acting mules were used in Bolton mills until the 1960s producing fine yarn. The earliest mills were situated by the streams and river as at Barrow Bridge, but steam power led to the construction of the large multi-storey mills and their chimneys that dominated Bolton's skyline, some of which survive today.|$|E

40|$|Central {{focus of}} {{spintronics}} is concentrated on generation of pure <b>spin</b> current and associated <b>spin</b> torque. Pure <b>spin</b> current {{can be generated}} by <b>spin</b> Hall effect in heavy metals by passing charge current. By <b>spin</b> Seebeck effect pure <b>spin</b> current can also be generated in ferromagnet. In this work we experimentally demonstrate that if heavy metals like Platinum with high <b>spin</b> orbit coupling carry heat current it can convert it into <b>spin</b> current due to relativistic <b>spin</b> orbit interaction. This conversion of heat current into <b>spin</b> current in non magnet is equivalent of thermally driven <b>spin</b> Hall effect or it is known as <b>spin</b> Nernst effect. We observed <b>spin</b> Nernst effect in Ni/Pt bi-layer experimentally and we confirm that when Pt is replaced by low <b>spin</b> orbit material like Al <b>spin</b> Nernst effect significantly reduces. So we have detected <b>spin</b> Nernst effect unambiguously and compare its strength with electrical <b>spin</b> Hall effect...|$|R

Mining peaked in the 19th century with over 200collieries in the town. Royton's pits were prone to repeated flooding, and owners began to close them. Coal production began to decline even before that of the local <b>spinning</b> industry, with the last pit closing in 1902.|$|E
40|$|<b>Spin</b> {{liquid is}} a state of {{electron}} <b>spins</b> in which quantum fluctuation breaks magnetic ordering while maintaining <b>spin</b> correlation. It has been a central topic in magnetism because of its relevance to high-Tc superconductivity and topological states. However, utilizing <b>spin</b> liquid has been quite difficult. Typical <b>spin</b> liquid states are realized in one-dimensional <b>spin</b> systems, called quantum <b>spin</b> chains. Here, we show that a <b>spin</b> liquid in a spin- 1 / 2 quantum chain generates and carries <b>spin</b> current via its long-range <b>spin</b> fluctuation. This is demonstrated by observing an anisotropic negative <b>spin</b> Seebeck effect along the <b>spin</b> chains in Sr 2 CuO 3. The results show that <b>spin</b> current can flow even in an atomic channel owing the <b>spin</b> liquid state, which can be used for atomic spin-current wiring. Comment: to be publishe...|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} higher <b>spin</b> black holes in a {{truncated}} version of higher <b>spin</b> gravity in AdS_ 3. This theory contains only finite number of even <b>spins</b> s= 2, 4, [...] ., 2 N. We mainly {{focus on the}} simplest case, so-called (Type I and II) <b>spin</b> 4 ̃ gravity, which contains only <b>spin</b> 2 and <b>spin</b> 4 fields. This <b>spin</b> 4 ̃ gravity {{is as simple as}} <b>spin</b> 3 gravity, thus provides another example to test various ideas on higher <b>spin</b> gravity. We find that the asymptotical symmetry of this <b>spin</b> 4 ̃ gravity is a classical W(2, 4) -symmetry. Moreover, we study the black hole solution with pure <b>spin</b> 4 hair and discuss its thermodynamics. One important feature of this black hole is that its entropy could be written in compact forms. Furthermore, we investigate a G_ 2 generated higher <b>spin</b> gravity. This higher <b>spin</b> gravity only contains <b>spin</b> 2 and <b>spin</b> 6 fields which makes it different from other kinds of higher <b>spin</b> gravity. We find the corresponding black hole with <b>spin</b> 6 hair, and discuss its thermodynamics analytically. It turns out that the black holes with <b>spin</b> 4 or <b>spin</b> 6 hair constructed in this paper are the only black holes with single higher <b>spin</b> hair, besides the <b>spin</b> 3 black hole found in arXiv: 1103. 4304.

2500|$|Quarks are fermionic {{particles}} of <b>spin</b> [...] (S=). Because <b>spin</b> projections vary in increments of 1 (that is 1ħ), a single quark has a <b>spin</b> vector of length , {{and has two}} <b>spin</b> projections (Sz=+ and Sz=−). Two quarks can have their <b>spins</b> aligned, {{in which case the}} two <b>spin</b> vectors add to make a vector of length S=1 and three <b>spin</b> projections (Sz=+1, Sz=0, and Sz=−1). If two quarks have unaligned <b>spins,</b> the <b>spin</b> vectors add up to make a vector of length S=0 and has only one <b>spin</b> projection (Sz=0), etc. Since baryons are made of three quarks, their <b>spin</b> vectors can add to make a vector of length S=, which has four <b>spin</b> projections (Sz=+, Sz=+, Sz=−, and Sz=−), or a vector of length S= with two <b>spin</b> projections (Sz=+, and Sz=−).|$|R

25|$|During a <b>spin,</b> the skater rotates on {{the round}} {{part of the}} blade, called the front rocker, just behind the toe pick (the ball of the foot). <b>Spins</b> may be {{performed}} individually or in a sequence combining different types of <b>spins.</b> A <b>spin</b> may be executed on the back rocker of the blade during a change of edge <b>spin.</b> For example, a back scratch <b>spin</b> will flip edges to a forward inside edge. This feature of a <b>spin</b> will change {{the level of a}} <b>spin.</b> <b>Spins</b> may be performed on either foot. Like jumping, skaters mostly rotate in the counterclockwise direction, but there are some skaters who rotate in the clockwise direction. Some skaters are able to rotate in both directions. For skaters who rotate in a counterclockwise direction, a <b>spin</b> on the left foot is called a forward <b>spin,</b> while a <b>spin</b> on the right foot is called a back <b>spin.</b> When learning to <b>spin,</b> one will typically learn a forward <b>spin</b> then once completing that will learn how to execute a back <b>spin.</b>|$|R
40|$|On {{the basis}} of a <b>spin</b> drift-diffusion model, we show how the <b>spin</b> current is {{composed}} and find that <b>spin</b> drift and <b>spin</b> diffusion contribute additively to the <b>spin</b> current, where the <b>spin</b> diffusion current decreases with electric field while the <b>spin</b> drift current increases, demonstrating that the extension of the <b>spin</b> diffusion length by a strong field does not result in a significant increase in <b>spin</b> current in semiconductors owing to the competing effect of the electric field on diffusion. We also find that there is a <b>spin</b> drift-diffusion crossover field for a process in which the drift and diffusion contribute equally to the <b>spin</b> current, which suggests a possible method of identifying whether the process for a given electric field is in the <b>spin</b> drift or <b>spin</b> diffusion regime. <b>Spin</b> drift-diffusion crossover fields for GaAs are calculated and are found to be quite small. We derive the relations between intrinsic <b>spin</b> diffusion length and the <b>spin</b> drift-diffusion crossover field of a semiconductor for different electron statistical regimes.

In the spring of 1768, the <b>spinning</b> jennies at Peel's factory were blamed for job losses.

A surprising feature of this <b>spin</b> Hall induction is that the <b>spin</b> accumulation sign does not change upon bias reversal. Contribution to the <b>spin</b> Hall accumulation from the <b>spin</b> Hall induction and the <b>spin</b> deviation due to intrinsic spin-orbit force as well as extrinsic <b>spin</b> scattering can be straightforwardly distinguished simply by reversing the bias.

50|$|The {{mechanisms}} of decay for a <b>spin</b> polarized population can be broadly classified as spin-flip scattering and <b>spin</b> dephasing.
