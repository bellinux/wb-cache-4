5|$|Following the abdication of the Russian Tsar in 1917, the Caucasus Front collapsed, leaving Central Asia—and {{beyond it}} India—open to the Turkish Army. The War Office {{responded with a}} plan to send a force of {{hand-picked}} British officers and NCOs to organise any remaining Russian forces or civilians who were ready to fight the Turkish forces. This force became known as Dunsterforce after its commander, Major General Lionel Charles Dunsterville, the inspiration for the titular character of Rudyard Kipling's novel <b>Stalky</b> & Co.. It arrived in Baku in August 1918. It was hoped that Dunsterforce could raise an army from the Christian Georgian, Armenian and Assyrian people who had supported the Russians and had historically feared the Turks. While Dunsterforce had some success the task proved beyond its ability.|$|E
25|$|A {{prolific}} writer {{during his time}} in Torquay, he also wrote <b>Stalky</b> & Co., a collection of school stories (born of his experience at the United Services College in Westward Ho!) whose juvenile protagonists displayed a know-it-all, cynical outlook on patriotism and authority. According to his family, Kipling enjoyed reading aloud stories from <b>Stalky</b> & Co. to them and often went into spasms of laughter over his own jokes.|$|E
25|$|In January 1878, Kipling was {{admitted}} to the United Services College at Westward Ho!, Devon, a school founded a few years earlier to prepare boys for the army. The school proved rough going for him at first, but later led to firm friendships and provided the setting for his schoolboy stories <b>Stalky</b> & Co. (1899). During his time there, Kipling also met {{and fell in love with}} Florence Garrard, who was boarding with Trix at Southsea (to which Trix had returned). Florence became the model for Maisie in Kipling's first novel The Light that Failed (1891).|$|E
60|$|McTurk laughed {{into the}} {{nickel-plated}} shaving-cup, and settled Sefton's head between <b>Stalky's</b> vise-like knees.|$|R
60|$|The {{answer is}} unprintable; but it brought not the faintest flush to <b>Stalky's</b> downy cheek.|$|R
60|$|There was a pause, {{filled by}} <b>Stalky's</b> long, liquid whistle of contempt, amazement, and derision.|$|R
500|$|The series can be {{considered}} part of the British children's boarding school genre, which includes Rudyard Kipling's <b>Stalky</b> & Co., Enid Blyton's Malory Towers, St. Clare's and the Naughtiest Girl series, and Frank Richards's Billy Bunter novels: the Harry Potter books are predominantly set in Hogwarts, a fictional British boarding school for wizards, where the curriculum includes the use of magic. In this sense they are [...] "in a direct line of descent from Thomas Hughes's Tom Brown's School Days and other Victorian and Edwardian novels of British public school life", though they are, as many note, more contemporary, grittier, darker, and more mature than the typical boarding school novel, addressing serious themes of death, love, loss, prejudice, coming-of-age, and the loss of innocence in a 1990s British setting.|$|E
500|$|Gardner {{spent his}} summers at the Museum of Magic and Witchcraft on the Isle of Man, and thus often relied on Valiente {{to deal with}} his affairs in Southern England. He sent her to meet with the occult artist Austin Osman Spare when he wanted some talismans {{produced}} by the latter. Spare subsequently described Valiente as [...] "a myopic <b>stalky</b> nymph... harmless and a little tiresome" [...] in a letter that he wrote to Kenneth Grant. At Gardner's prompting, she also met with the occultist Gerald Yorke, who was interested in learning about Wicca; Gardner insisted that she lie to Yorke by informing him that she was from a longstanding family of hereditary Wiccan practitioners. She also aided him in preparing his second non-fiction book about Wicca, The Meaning of Witchcraft, focusing in particular on those sections refuting the sensationalist accusations of the tabloid press.|$|E
500|$|Following the abdication of the Russian Tsar in 1917, the Caucasus Front collapsed, leaving Central Asia {{open to the}} Turkish Army. The British War Office {{responded with}} a plan to send a force of {{hand-picked}} British officers and NCOs to organise any remaining Russian forces or civilians who were ready to fight the Turkish forces. A request for Australian officers to participate was sent to the commander of the Australian Corps, General Sir William Birdwood. Some twenty officers, drawn from [...] "the cream of the cream" [...] of Australian leaders, were chosen, including Savige. This force became known as Dunsterforce after its commander, Major General Lionel Charles Dunsterville, the inspiration for the titular character of Rudyard Kipling's novel <b>Stalky</b> & Co. Dunsterforce arrived in Baku in August 1918. It was hoped that, from the Christian Georgian, Armenian and Assyrian people who had supported the Russians and historically feared the Turks, Dunsterforce could raise an army to contain the Turks but [...] "the task proved superhuman".|$|E
6000|$|... "It's {{the olive}} branch," [...] was <b>Stalky's</b> comment. [...] "It's the giddy white flag, by gum! Come {{to think of}} it, we have metagrobolized 'em." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sta--Corkran said," [...] the prefect began, {{his tone}} showing {{his sense of}} <b>Stalky's</b> insolence, [...] "that perhaps you'd {{tell us about that}} {{business}} with Duncan's body." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not exactly--in summer, anyhow." [...] <b>Stalky's</b> eye roved contentedly to the window. [...] "Our bounds {{are pretty}} big, too, and they leave us to {{ourselves}} a good deal." ...|$|R
2500|$|In Rudyard Kipling's 1926 {{short story}} [...] "The Propagation of Knowledge" [...] (later {{collected}} in Debits and Credits and The Complete <b>Stalky</b> & Co.), some schoolboys discover the Baconian theory and profess to be adherents, infuriating their English master.|$|E
2500|$|Edward FitzGerald's Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam, though {{formally}} {{derived from}} the Persian ruba'i, nevertheless shows a strong Horatian influence, since, as one modern scholar has observed,"...the quatrains inevitably recall the stanzas of the 'Odes', as does the narrating first person of the world-weary, ageing Epicurean Omar himself, mixing sympotic exhortation and 'carpe diem' with splendid moralising and 'memento mori' nihilism." [...] Matthew Arnold advised a friend in verse {{not to worry about}} politics, an echo of Odes , yet later became a critic of Horace's inadequacies relative to Greek poets, as role models of Victorian virtues, observing: [...] "If human life were complete without faith, without enthusiasm, without energy, Horace...would be the perfect interpreter of human life." [...] Christina Rossetti composed a sonnet depicting a woman willing her own death steadily, drawing on Horace's depiction of 'Glycera' in Odes [...] and Cleopatra in Odes [...] A. E. Housman considered Odes , in Archilochian couplets, the most beautiful poem of antiquity and yet he generally shared Horace's penchant for quatrains, being readily adapted to his own elegiac and melancholy strain. The most famous poem of Ernest Dowson took its title and its heroine's name from a line of Odes , Non sum qualis eram bonae sub regno Cynarae, as well as its motif of nostalgia for a former flame. Kipling wrote a famous parody of the Odes, satirising their stylistic idiosyncrasies and especially the extraordinary syntax, but he also used Horace's Roman patriotism as a focus for British imperialism, as in the story Regulus in the school collection <b>Stalky</b> & Co., which he based on Odes [...] Wilfred Owen's famous poem, quoted above, incorporated Horatian text to question patriotism while ignoring the rules of Latin scansion. However, there were few other echoes of Horace in the war period, possibly because war is not actually a major theme of Horace's work.|$|E
60|$|King went down-stairs again, and Beetle and McTurk lit the gas {{to confer}} with <b>Stalky.</b> But <b>Stalky</b> had vanished.|$|E
6000|$|... 'We're {{having a}} quiet evening together. <b>Stalky's</b> upstairs changing. Dinner's at 7.15 sharp, because we're hungry. His room's next to yours,' said The Infant, nursing a cobwebbed bottle of Burgundy.|$|R
60|$|They found <b>Stalky's</b> bed {{drawn out}} from the wall {{to the left of}} the dormer window, and the latter end of Richards {{protruding}} from a two-foot-square cupboard in the wall.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I wish to {{goodness}} you'd stop talking!' he snapped, and {{sat down}} on a chair. <b>Stalky's</b> hand on my shoulder quietly signalled me out of action, but I felt that my fire had not been misdirected.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mornin' came. No <b>Stalky.</b> Not {{a sign of}} him. I took counsel {{with his}} senior native officer--a grand, white-whiskered old chap--Rutton Singh, from Jullunder-way. He only grinned, {{and said it was}} all right. <b>Stalky</b> had been out of the fort twice before, somewhere or other, accordin' to him. He said <b>Stalky</b> 'ud come back unchipped, and gave me to {{understand}} that <b>Stalky</b> was an invulnerable Guru of sorts. All the same, I put the whole command on half rations, and set 'em to pickin' out loopholes.|$|E
6000|$|... "None of our Pathans {{believed}} that was luck," [...] said Tertius. [...] "They swore <b>Stalky</b> {{ought to have}} been born a Pathan, and--'member we nearly had a row in the fort when Rutton Singh said <b>Stalky</b> was a Pathan? Gad, how furious the old chap was with my Jemadar! But <b>Stalky</b> just waggled his finger and they shut up.|$|E
60|$|Hogan, Swayne, <b>Stalky,</b> Perowne, and Ansell {{were deep}} in {{consultation}} by the vaulting-horse, <b>Stalky</b> as usual laying down the law. The Sergeant watched them uneasily, knowing that many waited on their lead.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ye-es," [...] said Tertius, with a shudder. [...] "'Member the beastly look on <b>Stalky's</b> face, though, {{with his}} {{nostrils}} all blown out, same {{as he used}} to look when he was bullyin' a fag? That was a lovely evening." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Did {{you give}} Clewer Brush-drill?" [...] This time the {{question}} was answered sooner, and Brush-drill was dealt out for the space of five minutes by <b>Stalky's</b> watch. They could not even writhe in their bonds. No brush is employed in Brush-drill.|$|R
6000|$|... "Confound him, {{he might}} have had the decency to have backed the scheme. I could do such a lovely ballad, rottin' it; and now I'll have to be a giddy enthusiast. It don't bar our pulling <b>Stalky's</b> leg in the study, does it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "P'r'aps. <b>Stalky</b> {{was sent}} {{up for his}} wiggin' like a bad little boy. I've {{reason to believe that}} His Excellency's hair stood on end. He walked into <b>Stalky</b> for one hour--Stalky at {{attention}} {{in the middle of the}} floor, and (so he vowed) Von Lennaert pretending to soothe down His Excellency's topknot in dumb show in the background. <b>Stalky</b> didn't dare to look up, or he'd have laughed." ...|$|E
60|$|Beetle lay at {{full length}} on the turf behind the Lodge, {{literally}} biting {{the earth in}} spasms of joy. <b>Stalky</b> kicked him upright. There was nothing of levity about <b>Stalky</b> or McTurk save a stray muscle twitching on the cheek.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's {{precisely}} what you are! That's what we've been tryin' to hammer into your thick heads all this time," [...] said <b>Stalky.</b> [...] "Never mind, we'll forgive you. Cheer up. You can't help bein' asses, you know," [...] and, the enemy's flank deftly turned, <b>Stalky</b> hopped into bed.|$|E
6000|$|... "Aie! yeou {{little red}} rascal. I see yeou!" [...] The keeper threw {{the gun to}} his shoulder, and fired both barrels in their direction. The pellets dusted the dry stems round them as a big fox plunged between <b>Stalky's</b> legs, and ran over the cliff-edge.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now we find out," [...] <b>Stalky's</b> voice rose, [...] "that {{there is}} {{apparently}} an organized conspiracy throughout the house. For aught we know, the fags may be lendin' and borrowin' far beyond their means. We aren't responsible for it. We're only {{the rank and}} file." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] began Beetle, doubtfully, [...] "he {{comes from}} Balliol, but I'm {{going to give}} the beast a chance. You see I can always make him hop with some more poetry. He can't report me to the Head, because it makes him ridiculous. (<b>Stalky's</b> quite right.) But he shall have his chance." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "To make us quite comfy, <b>Stalky</b> took {{us up to}} the watch-tower to see poor Everett's body, lyin' in a foot o' drifted snow. It {{looked like}} a girl of fifteen--not a hair on the little fellow's face. He'd been shot through the temple, but the Malo'ts had left their mark on him. <b>Stalky</b> unbuttoned the tunic, {{and showed it to}} us--a rummy sickle-shaped cut on the chest. 'Member the snow all white on his eyebrows, Tertius? 'Member when <b>Stalky</b> moved the lamp and it looked as if he was alive?" ...|$|E
60|$|The {{visitors}} gasped, but <b>Stalky</b> {{interpreted the}} parable with large grins.|$|E
6000|$|... "Naturally, Cathcart {{not being}} a fool, {{even if he is}} a Political, let <b>Stalky</b> do his {{shooting}} within fifteen miles of Fort Everett for the next six months, and I always understood they and Rutton Singh and the prisoner were as thick as thieves. Then <b>Stalky</b> loafed back to his regiment, I believe. I've never seen him since." ...|$|E
5|$|For his {{services}} in Iran, Savige was also mentioned in despatches a third time. He later {{wrote a book}} about his experiences, entitled <b>Stalky's</b> Forlorn Hope, which was published in Melbourne in 1920. In November 1918, he was evacuated to a hospital in Bombay, suffering an attack of malaria, and returned to Australia in January 1919 on the City of Exeter.|$|R
6000|$|Ten o'clock {{struck and}} the Army class {{boys in the}} further studies coming to their houses after an hour's extra work passed along the gravel path below.

They heard Mullins' window slide up and then <b>Stalky's</b> voice: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Local etiquette, sir," [...] he replied, too earnest {{to notice}} <b>Stalky's</b> atrocious pun. [...] "If a slaver runs slaves through British {{territory}} {{he ought to}} pretend that they're his servants. Hawkin' 'em about in the Fork--the forked stick that you put round their necks, you know--is insolence--same as not backing your topsails in the old days. Besides, it unsettles the District." ...|$|R
