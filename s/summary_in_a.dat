50|$|Unfortunately, by {{the time}} Atlantic explorers were seeking {{information}} in the 1490s, the Inventio had gone missing, and was only known through a <b>summary</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> second text, the Itinerarium, written by a Brabantian traveller from 's-Hertogenbosch named Jacobus Cnoyen (also known as James Cnoyen or Jakob van Knoyen; modern Knox).
