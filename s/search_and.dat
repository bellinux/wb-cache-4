40|$|There are two {{dominant}} {{methods for}} locating information or goods on websites <b>and</b> online systems: <b>searching</b> <b>and</b> linking. Most {{previous research on}} <b>searching</b> <b>and</b> linking methods has focused on generic websites dedicated to locating information, such as Yahoo, rather than the <b>searching</b> <b>and</b> linking mechanisms used in specific applications, such as online shopping. In contrast, this study assessed the <b>searching</b> <b>and</b> linking metaphors inherent in online grocery stores, where each website must provide efficient tools for locating products {{if they are to}} be successful e-commerce websites. Worldwide grocery sites were judged against a checklist of advanced <b>search</b> features, <b>and</b> the use of <b>searching</b> <b>and</b> linking methods on the sites was evaluated using results from shopping scripts completed by eighteen participants...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: <b>Searching</b> <b>and</b> {{tracking}} {{are important}} issues in multi-robot observation of multiple moving targets. In this paper, our distributed memory based <b>searching</b> <b>and</b> artificial potential field based tracking algorithms are presented. For searching, a memory table, either local or shared, helps to find targets. For tracking, an artificial potential field based motion control algorithm provides real-time tracking with collision avoidance. Simulations demonstrate {{the capability of}} our distributed <b>searching</b> <b>and</b> tracking works...|$|R

5|$|A {{dedicated}} <b>search</b> <b>and</b> rescue (SAR) version, the HAR3, {{was developed}} for the RAF <b>Search</b> <b>and</b> Rescue Force. The type entered service in 1978 to replace the Westland Whirlwind HAR.10. A 16th helicopter was ordered shortly after, and following the Falklands War of 1982, three more examples were purchased to enable operation of a SAR flight in the islands, initially from Navy Point {{on the north side}} of Stanley harbour, and later from RAF Mount Pleasant. In 1992, six further helicopters were ordered to replace the last remaining Westland Wessex helicopters in the SAR role, entering service in 1996. The six Sea King HAR3As featured updated systems, including a digital navigation system and more modern avionics.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a novel approach}} in face digital image <b>searching</b> <b>and</b> matching. The given key image is converted into gray scale image and after that a matrix is computed with gray scale values of the key image. Then we are collecting the diagonal key elements for diagonal searching key sequence. Using Pair wise sequence alignment {{we are trying to}} match the key with available images in the large data base of collection of faces. Initially we discussed various techniques used in digital image <b>searching</b> <b>and</b> matching in this paper. This new algorithm Diagonal matrix is a new algorithm for all face images <b>searching</b> <b>and</b> matching. Face recognition is very essential in the field of criminology. Face Image <b>searching</b> <b>and</b> matching are very difficult task in image processing; there are several algorithms for face image matching. But still needs more optimization for image matching. Using this new approach we can match criminal photo from a large database. Face Image recognition, feature extraction and pattern matching needs improvements in Image processing. There are several methods for Face image <b>searching</b> <b>and</b> matching, but we need new optimized technique for image <b>searching</b> <b>and</b> matching. This new Diagonal matrix approach is tried to give optimized solution in Face digital image matching. Key words: Image retrieval, edge detection and matching, face recognition, affine invariant, image <b>searching</b> <b>and</b> matching...|$|R
