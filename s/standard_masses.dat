The <b>standard</b> <b>masses</b> are often referred to, non-technically, as [...] "weights". [...] Since any variations in gravity will act equally on the unknown and the known weights, a lever-balance will indicate the same value at any location on Earth. [...] Therefore, balance [...] "weights" [...] are usually calibrated and marked in mass units, so the lever-balance measures mass by comparing the Earth's attraction on the unknown object and <b>standard</b> <b>masses</b> in the scale pans. [...] In {{the absence of a}} gravitational field, away from planetary bodies (e.g. space), a lever-balance would not work, but on the Moon, for example, it would give the same reading as on Earth. Some balances can be marked in weight units, but since the weights are calibrated at the factory for standard gravity, the balance will measure standard weight, i.e. what the object would weigh at standard gravity, not the actual local force of gravity on the object.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIt {{has been}} {{reported}} recently that classical, isothermal–isobaric molecular dynamics (NTP MD) simulations at a time step of 1. 00 fs of the standard-mass time (Δt= 1. 00 fssmt) and a temperature of ≤ 340 K using uniformly reduced atomic masses by tenfold offers better configurational sampling than standard-mass NTP MD simulations {{at the same time}} step. However, it has long been reported that atomic masses can also be increased to improve configurational sampling because higher atomic masses permit the use of a longer time step. It is worth investigating whether standard-mass NTP MD simulations at Δt= 2. 00 or 3. 16 fssmt can offer better or comparable configurational sampling than low-mass NTP MD simulations at Δt= 1. 00 fssmt. This article reports folding simulations of two β-hairpins showing that the configurational sampling efficiency of NTP MD simulations using atomic masses uniformly reduced by tenfold at Δt= 1. 00 fssmt is statistically equivalent to and better than those using <b>standard</b> <b>masses</b> at Δt= 3. 16 and 2. 00 fssmt, respectively. The results confirm that, relative to those using <b>standard</b> <b>masses</b> at routine Δt= 2. 00 fssmt, the low-mass NTP MD simulations at Δt= 1. 00 fssmt are a simple and generic technique to enhance configurational sampling at temperatures of ≤ 340 K...|$|E

Therefore, the investigation is surveyed through three seperate experiments; Experiments A, B and C; which examined the three effects respectively. For each experiment, a pendulum is constructed by suspending a thread from the ceiling and attaching a mass hook with <b>standard</b> <b>masses</b> to it and the sinuodally varying acceleration of 20 oscilations are measured and recorded by Vernier Accelerometer. As for the results, predictedly, the period decreased dramatically when the length of the pendulum decreased.

Then, the theoretical periods of the oscilations are calculated and the experimental periods are compared with them. For each experiment, the experimental error is less than 5...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{assess the}} {{diagnostic}} {{performance of a}} three-step strategy proposed by the International Ovarian Tumor Analysis (IOTA) Group for discriminating between benign and malignant adnexal masses. Methods: This was a prospective observational study, performed at two tertiary-care university hospitals, of women diagnosed with an adnexal mass on transvaginal or transabdominal ultrasound between December 2012 and December 2014. Women were scheduled for an ultrasound evaluation, which was initially performed by non-expert examiners. The examiner had to classify the mass using ‘simple descriptors’ (first step) and, if not possible, using ‘simple rules’ (second step). For inconclusive masses, an expert examiner classified the mass according to their subjective impression (third step). Masses were managed expectantly, with serial follow-up examinations, or surgically, according to ultrasound findings and clinical symptoms. Histology {{was used as the}} reference <b>standard.</b> <b>Masses</b> that were managed expectantly with at least 1 year of follow-up were considered as benign for analytical purposes. Women with less than 1 year of follow-up {{were not included in the}} study. Results: Six hundred and sixty-six women were included (median age, 41 (range, 18 – 81) years) of whom 514 were premenopausal and 152 were postmenopausal. Based on the three-step strategy, 362 women had surgical removal of the mass (53 malignant and 309 benign), 71 masses resolved spontaneously and 233 persisted. Four hundred and forty-eight (67. 3 %) of 666 masses could be classified using simple descriptors and, of the 218 that could not, 147 (67. 4 %) were classified using simple rules. Of the remaining 71 masses, the expert examiner classified 45 as benign, 12 as malignant and 14 as uncertain. Overall sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio and negative likelihood ratio of the three-step strategy were 94. 3 %, 94. 9 %, 18. 6 and 0. 06, respectively. Conclusion: The IOTA three-step strategy, based on the sequential use of simple descriptors, simple rules and expert evaluation, performs well for classifying adnexal masses as benign or malignant.

40|$|FBG sensors are {{particularly}} suitable for strain measurements on mechanical parts subjected to strong electromagnetic disturbances. This {{is the case}} of strain measurements on the pantograph collector strip of underground trains, where, due to arcing phenomena caused by contact loss between the pantograph collector and the contact wire of overhead line during the current collection, high electromagnetic disturbances are present. Moreover, an intrinsic advantage of fiber optic sensors is the ability to electrically insulate the sensor from the conditioning and data-gathering unit. In this work the application of FBG sensors on the pantograph collector of an underground train, instrumented for experimental in-line tests, is presented. First, a FEM analysis of the collector to identify the suitable position, in terms of maximum sensitivity and fiber safety, for the strain sensor was performed. The position of a thermal compensating FBG sensor was also selected as a compromise between a place not too far from the main sensor (so that both are subject to the same temperature), and with a small (or negative) strain. The compensated signal is simply computed subtracting the compensator signal from the main one, and this can be considered roughly proportional to the total contact force. A static calibration was conducted in the laboratory with <b>standard</b> <b>masses,</b> and dynamic tests were carried out to dynamically characterize the pantograph. The FBG static measurements were compared with force measurements obtained from traditional sensors positioned on the pantograph collector interface, {{on each side of the}} collector, in order to obtain information on the position of vertical contact force. The total vertical contact force from the traditional load cells is compared with the FBG measurement obtained in the center of the collector. The comparison of the total force signals obtained during experimental results for both laboratory and in-line tests showed a good accordance, and these tests can be considered as a validation of the method, so that it can be further developed and used in the future in similar situations...|$|E
40|$|We used {{simulations}} from a biophysical {{model that}} integrates interlinked exchanges {{of energy and}} water between frogs and their environments to address questions about the limits to thermoregulation and about adaptations for arboreality. Body size and cutaneous resistance (Rc) both significantly affected body temperature (Tb) and the time to desiccate to 70 % of <b>standard</b> <b>mass</b> (an ecologically relevant metric of desiccation). Cutaneous resistances < 25 s/cm allow basking frogs to elevate their Tb several degrees above ambient, but Rc above 25 had little additional effect on Tb. Small frogs (< 10 g) are able to elevate their Tb above ambient while basking, even with small Rc. Large frogs must have greater skin resistances {{to be able to}} elevate body temperatures above ambient, yet large frogs take longer to desiccate to 70 % of their <b>standard</b> <b>mass.</b> Frogs can avoid rapid desiccation with high Rc, a large body size, or some combination of these traits.
