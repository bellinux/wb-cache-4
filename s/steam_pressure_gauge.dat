40|$|AbstractWhen {{moisture}} saturated composites {{are rapidly}} heated, the <b>steam</b> <b>pressure</b> inside cavities {{can cause the}} composite to delaminate. We study the effect of heating rate on the <b>steam</b> <b>pressure</b> inside an isolated long thin “crack-like” cavity of thickness h assuming that the chemical potential of water is continuous across the cavity/polymer interface. For such a cavity in an infinite plate, we show there is sufficient moisture for the <b>steam</b> <b>pressure</b> to reach the saturated <b>steam</b> <b>pressure,</b> irrespective of the heating rate. However, for a plate of thickness L exposed to dry air, the cavity pressure reaches a maximum value, which depends only on the normalized plate thickness, α=L/h and normalized heating rate, β=T˙h 2 /T 0 D(T 0) where T˙ is the heating rate, D(T 0) is the moisture diffusivity at the initial temperature T 0, before it decays to zero because of the dry air outside. For this case, the maximum <b>steam</b> <b>pressure</b> can be significantly less than the saturation pressure.

The analysis will improve the optimal system-wide control theory of air-cooling power plant.
