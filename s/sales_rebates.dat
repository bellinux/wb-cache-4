40|$|This paper {{studies the}} impact of {{strategic}} customer behavior on supply chain performance. We start with a newsvendor seller facing forward-looking customers. The seller initially charges a regular price but may salvage the leftover inventory at a lower salvage price after random demand is realized. Customers anticipate future sales and choose purchase timing to maximize their expected surplus. We characterize the rational expectations equilibrium, where {{we find that the}} seller 2 ̆ 7 s stocking level is lower than that in the classic model without strategic customers. We show that the seller 2 ̆ 7 s profit can be improved by promising either that quantities available will be limited (quantity commitment) or that prices will be kept high (price commitment). In most cases, both forms of commitment are not credible in a centralized supply chain with a single seller. However, decentralized supply chains can use contractual arrangements as indirect commitment devices to attain the desired outcomes with commitment. Decentralization has generally been associated with coordination problems, but we present the contrasting view that disparate interests within a supply chain can actually improve overall supply chain performance. In particular, with strategic customer behavior, we find that (i) a decentralized supply chain with a wholesale price contract may perform strictly better than a centralized supply chain; (ii) contracts widely studied in the supply chain coordination literature (e. g., markdown money, <b>sales</b> <b>rebates,</b> and buyback contracts) can serve as a commitment device as well as an incentive-coordinating device; and (iii) some of the above contracts cannot allocate profits arbitrarily between supply chain members because of strategic customer behavior...|$|E
40|$|We explore in {{this paper}} the {{performance}} of <b>sales</b> <b>rebate</b> contracts in fashion supply chains. We conduct both analytical and numerical analyses via a mean-variance framework with reference to real empirical data. To be specific, we evaluate the expected profits and variance of profits (risk) of the fashion supply chains, fashion retailers, and manufacturers under (1) the currently implemented <b>sales</b> <b>rebate</b> practices, (2) the case without <b>sales</b> <b>rebate,</b> and (3) the theoretical coordination situation (if target <b>sales</b> <b>rebate</b> is adopted). In addition, we analyze how sales effort affects the performances of the supply chain and its agents. Our analysis indicates that the rebate contracts may hurt the retailer and the manufacturer of a fashion supply chain when it is inappropriately set. Moreover, a properly designed <b>sales</b> <b>rebate</b> contract not only can coordinate the supply chain (with retail sales effort) but can also improve expected profits and lower the levels of risk for both the manufacturer and the retailer.

40|$|Coordinating supply chains is an {{effective}} way to improve channel performance. This paper details how a <b>sales</b> <b>rebate</b> contract helps achieve supply chain coordination which allows decentralized decisions of chain members to perform a centralized decision for the whole system. A model {{in the context of a}} two-echelon supply chain with a single supplier serving multiple retailers in vendor-managed inventory (VMI) partnership is proposed. VMI facilitates the application of the <b>sales</b> <b>rebate</b> contract since information sharing in VMI partnership allows the supplier to obtain actual sales data in a timely manner and determine the rebate for retailers. Retailers are considered in two scenarios: independent retailers with a demand function sensitive only to their own price and competing retailers with a demand function depending on all retailers' prices. The proposed model demonstrates that the supplier gains more profit with competing retailers than without as competition among the retailers lowers the prices and thus stimulates demand.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} channel {{coordination}} {{issue of a}} supply chain with a risk-neutral manufacturer and a loss-averse retailer facing stochastic demand that is sensitive to sales effort. Under the loss-averse newsvendor setting, a distribution-free gain/loss-sharing-and-buyback (GLB) contract {{has been shown to}} be able to coordinate the supply chain. However, we find that a GLB contract remains ineffective in managing the supply chain when retailer sales efforts influence the demand. To effectively coordinate the channel, we propose to combine a GLB contract with <b>sales</b> <b>rebate</b> and penalty (SRP) contract. In addition, we discover a special class of gain/loss contracts that can coordinate the supply chain and arbitrarily allocate the expected supply chain profit between the manufacturer and the retailer. We then analyze the effect of loss aversion on the retailer’s decision-making behavior and supply chain performance. Finally, we perform a numerical study to illustrate the findings and gain additional insights...|$|R
40|$|The <b>sale</b> tax <b>rebate</b> {{program has}} existed in states along the U.

40|$|We {{consider}} the coordination challenge with a risk-neutral manufacturer which supplies to multiple heterogeneou retailers. We {{find that the}} manufacturer can maximize its expected profit only if the expected profit of the supply chain is maximized, or equivalently supply chain coordination (SCC) is achieved. The target <b>sales</b> <b>rebate</b> (TSR) contract is commonly used in practice to achieve SCC. However, as we found in this paper, the presence of heterogeneity in retailers' minimum expected profit requirements is the major cause that a single TSR contract and the related single hybrid contracts all fail to achieve SCC and maximize the manufacturer's expected profit simultaneously. Thus, we develop an innovative menu of TSR contracts with fixed order quantity (TSR-FOQ). Although there are multiple contracts in a menu, {{we find that the}} manufacturer only needs to decide one basic TSR contract and two newly developed parameters termed as the risk-level indicator and the separation indicator, in applying the sophisticated menu of TSR-FOQ. By adjusting the two indicators, the manufacturer can control the profit variance of the retailers and the separations of the component contracts of the menu. We further propose another sophisticated menu of TSR with minimum order quantity and quantity discount contracts which can give each retailer a higher degree of freedom in the selection of order quantity. Differences between the two menus are analytically examined. Some meaningful managerial insights are generated. Department of Applied MathematicsInstitute of Textiles and Clothin...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{production and}} order {{as well as}} advertising coordination issues for a single-manufacturer single-buyer supply chain. In the two-echelon system, the manufacturer sells a newsvendor-type product through the buyer who faces a random demand depending on advertising expenditure and selling price. Before {{the start of the}} selling period, the buyer needs to determine how much she should invest in advertising, how many units of products she should order from the manufacturer and at what price she should sell the ordered products. At the end of the selling period, when the revealed demand exceeds stock on hand, all the superfluous demand is met by a second order from the manufacturer, if unfilled customers are offered a discount in selling price. Based on the buyer's first order, the manufacturer needs to select his initial production quantity under a relatively cheap but long lead-time production mode, and responds to the buyer's second order with an expensive but quick-response production mode (if necessary). Under both the centralized and decentralized setting, we formulate mathematical models of how two members make their decisions, respectively, and provide the closed-form solution to each model. In order to achieve perfect coordination of the supply chain, we propose an improved <b>sales</b> <b>rebate</b> contract, which can arbitrarily allocate the profit between two parties.

40|$|AbstractDomestic {{water heating}} in Australia {{conventionally}} uses electric resistance heating storage or gas fuelled water heaters. The Australian electricity supply {{has some of}} the highest greenhouse gas emissions factors in the world. Consequently, water heating is responsible for approximately 24 percent of residential sector greenhouse gas emissions in Australia. To assist households to move towards an energy efficient, low carbon future, a suite of market intervention programs to support solar hot water uptake have been introduced at both state and federal levels. These programs aim to improve the capacity of industry to deliver solar solutions, reduce the emissions intensity and net cost of household water heating, and increase the market share of the solar water heating sector. Incentives include:•Point of <b>sale</b> <b>rebates</b> and certificate-based programs for energy efficiency and renewable energy;•Regulations for new houses that encourage solar water heating installations;•Community awareness programs; and•Training programs for installers to ensure that tradespeople have the competencies to size systems and the skills to install them correctly. In some jurisdictions the incentive programs were performance-based, but in others a fixed rebate amount was available for all systems having performance above a minimum threshold. These programs have lead to the widespread expansion of the industry, with an almost doubling of the proportion of households with solar water heaters between 1999 and 2011. Installations in new homes have seen an even more marked increase: For example, regulations for new homes in the state of Victoria require the installation of a solar water heater or rainwater tank. This program has seen the adoption of solar water heaters in new homes increase fro m around 5 % in 2004 to over 70 % in 2011. Across most of Australia there are proposed regulations limiting the emissions intensity of replacement water heaters which will effectively ban resistance electric water heaters in most situations. Recently both South Australia and Queensland commenced their program for existing houses. It is expected that in the future these programs will drive an even greater uptake, which will go some way to insulating Australian households from price increases that may result from carbon driven future increases in the cost of energy. This paper discusses the various approaches and outcomes of the different programs and provides analysis of the basis of program success or improvements. Learning relevant to market interventions worldwide include•Continuity in program operation is necessary to allow industry to grow in a sustainable way. •Basing the incentive on independently derived performance results provides industry with a means of differentiating better products and provides purchasers with appropriate guidance. •Rebate program design should consider the consumer's purchasing priorities. For example, a point of sale discount awarded as part of the purchase transaction aligns with the urgency of the purchasing process and does not require additional cash to be available from the purchaser. •Design of the schemes can not only produce a greater market share, but can also encourage the manufacture of lower greenhouse gas emissions products. •Market interventions can have unintended consequences, so the programs need to be monitored and flexibility maintained to changes to avoid poor outcomes...|$|R

Parts II-III discuss the specific situations under Community competition law in which price discrimination and the legality of pricing practices may be relevant. Part II discusses rebate and discounting practices, including target (or <b>sales</b> growth) <b>rebates,</b> fidelity or loyalty rebates, and rebates in return for exclusivity. Part III discusses price discrimination that gives rise to distortions of competition between customers. This concerns Article 82 (c), a provision that has some parallels with the Robinson-Patman Act under U. S. law. In practice, it will be rare that a profit-maximizing firm will have the ability or incentive to charge different prices to comparable customers {{to such an extent that}} competition between those customers will be significantly distorted. Part IV discusses predatory pricing. It is important that prices that remain above average variable cost should nearly always be treated as legal, since rivals will usually be able, and should be encouraged, to compete in that scenario. Community competition law should only treat pricing above average variable cost as unlawful where there is evidence of other abusive behavior linked to that low pricing, in other words a clear plan to eliminate a rival by using a range of illicit practices.

Large stores often work in conjunction with manufacturers, usually requiring two or even three separate rebates for each item. Manufacturer rebates are sometimes valid only at a single store. Rebate forms and special receipts are sometimes printed by the cash register at time of purchase on a separate receipt or available online for download. In some cases, the rebate may be available immediately, in which case it is referred to as an instant rebate. Some rebate programs offer several payout options to consumers, including a paper cheque, a prepaid card that can be spent immediately without a trip to the bank, or even PayPal payout.|$|R
5000|$|Gale {{analyzed}} {{a national}} sales tax (though different from the FairTax in several aspects) and reported that the overall tax burden on middle-income Americans would increase while the tax burden on the top 1% would drop. A study by the Beacon Hill Institute reported that the FairTax may {{have a negative effect}} on the well-being of mid-income earners for several years after implementation. According to the President's Advisory Panel for Federal Tax Reform report, which compared the individual and corporate income tax (excluding other taxes the FairTax replaces) to a <b>sales</b> tax with <b>rebate,</b> the percentage of federal taxes paid by those earning from $15,000-$50,000 would rise from 3.6% to 6.7%, while the burden on those earning more than $200,000 would fall from 53.5% to 45.9%. [...] The report states that the top 5% of earners would see their burden decrease from 58.6% to 37.4%. FairTax supporters argue that replacing the regressive payroll tax (a 15.3% total tax not included in the Tax Panel study; payroll taxes include a 12.4% Social Security tax on wages up to $97,500 and a 2.9% Medicare tax, a 15.3% total tax that is often split between employee and employer) greatly changes the tax distribution, and that the FairTax would relieve the tax burden on middle-class workers.|$|R
