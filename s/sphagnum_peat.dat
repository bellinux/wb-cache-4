The aqueous solution influence of various pH, also the initial metal ion concentration, peat dose and contact time was studied in batch experiments. The obtained results indicate that for an initial solution pH = 6. 0 (acetate buffer), <b>sphagnum</b> moss <b>peat</b> was effective in removing 98 % of lead, and still increase with the increasing of peat dose. With the increasing of initial lead concentration, the residual Pb(II) content from aqueous solution increase the same, but the removal percent is higher than 95 % only in case of solutions with an initial concentration lower than 350 mg/L.

40|$|Batch {{sorption}} {{experiments were}} performed {{for the removal}} of chromium(III) ions from aqueous solutions using Romanian <b>Sphagnum</b> moss <b>peat</b> (untreated and treated with NaCl solution) as sorbent. In order to establish the best conditions for the sorption of chromium(III), the influence of initial pH, contact time, peat dose and metal ion concentration was investigated. The Freundlich, Langmuir and Dubinin–Radushkevich models were applied to describe the sorption isotherms and to calculate its constants. The experimental data fitted well to the Langmuir model with a maximum sorption capacity of 18. 6 mg Cr(III) /g of peat. The mean free energy of sorption suggests that the binding of Cr(III) on peat occurred through an ion exchange mechanism. The kinetic data evaluated by pseudo-first order and pseudo-second order kinetic models showed that the sorption of chromium onto the peat followed a pseudo-second order rate equation. The chromium(III) could be easily eluted from the loaded peat using 0. 10 M HCl and the peat may be reused in several sorption/desorption cycles.

40|$|Plant macrofossil {{data have}} been used to {{identify}} the successive mire communities occupying both central and marginal locations in the Walton Moss peatland complex, during the last 10 500 years. The reconstructed pathways of mire development indicate that early-Holocene fen and fen-carr communities were succeeded by species indicative of deep mire water tables and oligotrophic conditions. The character of the fen/bog transition (FBT) is compared with similar records of peatland development from Britain and Scandinavia and with independent climate data for the early Holocene. The ‘pseudohochmoor’ of central Europe is suggested as an approximate modern analogue for the dry pioneer oligotrophic mire type and alternative explanations for its presence are explored. The first major increase in ombrotrophic Sphagna occurred at c. 7800 cal. BP.

40|$|Distributions of bacteriohopanepolyols (BHPs) were {{investigated}} in a peat core from the Bissendorfer Moor (Germany) {{in order to}} test the utility of BHPs as indicators of microbial processes in peats. Between 13 and 22 BHPs were identified in each sample (23 structures in total), with total concentrations ranging from 160 – 2800 µg g- 1 TOC. We have tentatively ascribed sources of most BHPs observed at this site via comparison of known BHPs source organisms with recent microbiological studies on the peat microbiome. Members of the Alpha-, Beta- and Gammaproteobacteria and specifically the genera Burkholderia, Bradyrhizobium and Rhodoblastus, as well as other phyla including the cyanobacteria, Acidobacteria and Acetobacteria are amongst the most likely sources. Additionally, BHP signatures which could be assigned directly to methane oxidising bacteria (35 -aminobacteriohopanepentol and 35 -aminobacteriohopanepentol) were present only at very low levels, supporting previous studies which have shown that the majority of precursor organisms biosynthesising hopanoids in peat environments are heterotrophs. The surface layers also contained a highly unusual signature comprising high concentrations of unsaturated compounds, including unsaturated bacteriohopanetetrol pseudopentose, which has previously only been reported in Gloeocapsa cyanobacteria. This genus is known to occur in symbiotic association with host Sphagnum species, and has the ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen which is a well known trait amongst members of the peat microbiome and amongst hopanoid producing microorganisms. The apparent capacity for hopanoids to protect organisms from external stresses such as low pH is therefore likely to be a significant factor accounting for the high BHP contributions from heterotrophs, methanotrophs and phototrophic organisms in <b>Sphagnum</b> <b>peats...</b>|$|R

Consequently, calcifuges grown on alkaline soils often develop the symptoms of iron deficiency, i.e. interveinal chlorosis of new growth.

Both solutions separated the different fractions by size; the best regression and the largest interval of linearity, M from 3000 to 200 000 Da, was obtained with the 25 g l- 1 PEG solution. At 10 kV and without PEG, migration times ranged from 6. 5 to 8. 1 min and did not differentiate the peats, whereas at 25 g l- 1 PEG, migration times ranged from 3. 3 to 6. 5 min and, when plotted as a function of either the r value or the von Post index (H), which are used to evaluate the degree of decomposition of horticultural peats, they separated samples {{on the basis of their}} geographical origin and probable type of mire complex. At 25 g l- 1 PEG, migration times also showed a well-defined linear decreasing trend with the increase of mean annual temperatures.
