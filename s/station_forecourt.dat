25|$|The <b>station</b> <b>forecourt</b> is the {{terminus}} or key intermediate {{destination for}} many bus services; almost all local and district bus services stop there.

Numerous bus services each hour traverse Midsummer Boulevard, connecting the station to the shopping centre, the theatre and Xscape. There is a public toilet in this area.|$|E
25|$|The {{merger of}} the two {{railways}} made possible the implementation of numerous development measures. By the end of 2006, the shuttle train terminal in Täsch had been fundamentally transformed, {{and the number of}} covered parking spaces increased to 1700. In connection {{with the opening of the}} Lötschberg Base Tunnel, the station at Visp was completely rebuilt. Beginning in 2005, the MGB lines were moved from the <b>station</b> <b>forecourt</b> to points adjacent to the existing standard gauge tracks so as to minimise the walking distances for transferring passengers.|$|E

25|$|Originally {{opened on}} 1 May 1895 {{by a private}} company, the Bexleyheath Line {{was taken over by}} the South Eastern Railway after it {{suffered}} bankruptcy. There were originally two stations in Eltham: Eltham Well Hall and Eltham Park. Eltham Well Hall station opened in 1895. Eltham Park station opened (after a prolonged legal wrangle) on 1 July 1908. On 11 June 1972, a London-bound train came off the track at Well Hall, killing 6 and injuring 126. Both Eltham stations were closed in 1985 and replaced by a new ‘Eltham’ station; this coincided with the construction of the Rochester Way Relief Road part of which was built on the site of Eltham Well Hall station. Glenlea Road between Well Hall Road and Archery Road was replaced by the <b>station</b> <b>forecourt</b> and a bus station (this had previously been adjacent to Well Hall station). The new rail station was built above the new road at the point it travels through what is sometimes referred to as 'the Eltham tunnel'. The new station has a modernist feel.|$|E
25|$|The {{engineering}} of the Morden {{extension of}} the C from Clapham Common to Morden was more demanding, running in tunnels to a point just north of Morden station, which was constructed in a cutting. The line then runs under the wide <b>station</b> <b>forecourt</b> and public road outside the station, to the depot. The extension was initially planned to continue to Sutton over part of the route for the unbuilt Wimbledon and Sutton Railway, in which the UERL held a stake, but agreements were made with the Southern Railway to end the extension at Morden. The Southern Railway later built the surface line from Wimbledon to Sutton, via South Merton and St. Helier. The tube extension opened in 1926, with seven new stations, all designed by Charles Holden in a modern style. Originally, Stanley Heaps was to design the stations, but after seeing these designs Frank Pick, Assistant Joint Manager of the UERL, decided Holden should take over the project. With the exception of Morden and Clapham South, where more land was available, the new stations were built on confined corner sites at main road junctions in areas that had been already developed. Holden made good use of this limited space and designed impressive buildings. The street-level structures are of white Portland stone with tall double-height ticket halls, with the famous London Underground roundel made up in coloured glass panels in large glazed screens. The stone columns framing the glass screens are surmounted by a capital formed as a three-dimensional version of the roundel. The large expanses of glass above the entrances ensure that the ticket halls are bright and, lit from within at night, welcoming. The first and last new stations on the extension, Clapham South and Morden, include a parade of shops and were designed with structures capable of being built above (like many of the earlier central London stations). Clapham South was extended upwards soon after its construction with a block of apartments; Morden was extended upwards in the 1960s with a block of offices. All the stations on the extension, except Morden itself, are Grade II listed buildings.|$|E

Thomas Cook established a travel office {{on the corner of}} the <b>station</b> <b>forecourt.</b> The SER route became the shortest from London to Dover after a diversion at Sevenoaks was built in 1868, and by 1913 it was possible to travel from Charing Cross to Paris in six and a half hours.|$|E
2500|$|Since 1930, the {{starting}} point for the line to Zermatt has been Brig station. Until the merger of the two railways, the metre gauge part of this station was owned by the FO, and the BVZ therefore had to pay a fee for using it. Erected in 1915 by the then Brig-Furka-Disentis-Bahn, Brig's metre gauge station extends over three platform tracks and is located at the forecourt of Brig's standard gauge station, where there are connections with BLS and SBB trains heading towards the Lötschberg, Lake Geneva and Simplon Tunnel. With the opening of the Lötschberg base tunnel, {{a large portion of the}} travellers changing for Zermatt now make the change at Visp. Brig's metre gauge station is now a through station. [...] Its previous configuration as a terminal station came to an end with the opening of new tracks leading from the metre gauge station directly to the east towards Goms. The new track formation, which was first used on 1 December 2007, replaced a section through Naters that was equipped with many level crossings. Currently, the town of Brig is seeking the complete removal of the narrow gauge system from the <b>station</b> <b>forecourt,</b> and its incorporation into the standard gauge station.|$|E
50|$|The <b>station</b> <b>forecourt</b> was rebuilt up to 2013. This {{involved}} {{the building of}} a new bus station, 55 parking bays and a covered bicycle facility at a cost of €580,000. The redesigned <b>station</b> <b>forecourt</b> was opened in Easter 2013.|$|E

40|$|This {{case study}} {{examines}} the alleged hazard associated with mobile phone use at petrol stations {{and suggests that}} it is a phantom risk. Understanding its persistence in the absence of evidence, a number of factors are outlined. A precautionary safety regime enforced by oil companies in the UK established a restriction on mobile use on <b>station</b> <b>forecourts</b> that had the effect of confirming a danger. Warning signs in mobile phone handbooks had a similar effect and led to further restrictions at petrol stations. Among a number of problematic consequences, most ironic has been to distract from the real cause of the increased number of petrol stations fires at, particularly, American petrol stations. Investigations have identified the real cause, body static generated through vehicle re-entry while refuelling. This episode suggests the need for clarity about the precise reasons behind any restrictions on the use of a popular device that is already established as a potential, but invariably unconfirmed, health hazard...|$|R
