Hydrocarbons and fatty alcohols, two components characteristic of waxes associated with potato suberin, increased 9 - and 5 -fold, respectively, as a result of ABA treatment. Thus, the deposition of the polymeric aliphatics and aromatics as well as waxes, all of which have been postulated to be components of suberized cell walls, was markedly stimulated by ABA. ω-Hydroxy-fatty acid dehydrogenase which showed a rather high initial level of activity increased only 60 % due to ABA treatment.

Thorough washing of potato disks up to 3 to 4 days after cutting resulted in severe inhibition of <b>suberization</b> as measured both by diffusion resistance and {{by the amount of}} the octadecene diol generated by hydrogenolysis (LiAlH 4) of the tissue. Disks washed after 4 days did not show any inhibition of <b>suberization.</b> High performance liquid chromatographic analysis of the wash from fresh potato disks showed that about 14 ng of ABA was released into the wash per g of tissue. The amount of ABA released increased with time up to 4 to 6 hours of washing. The maximal amount of ABA was washed out after aging for 24 hours and after 2 days of aging ABA could no longer be found in the surface wash of the disks. Addition of ABA to the media of potato tissue cultures resulted in suberin formation whereas control cultures contained little suberin. The effect of ABA on <b>suberization</b> in the tissue cultures was shown to be linearly concentration-dependent up to 10 − 4 m and a linear increase in suberin formation was seen up to about 8 days of culture growth on the media containing 10 − 4 m ABA.

The first-formed internodes were most susceptible to infection, whilst later-forming and slower-expanding internodes were less susceptible. Detailed tuber physiological examination of internode 2 showed that pathogen-induced changes, including increased phellem (periderm) thickness, cell layers and phellem <b>suberization</b> (key physiological features believed critical to S. scabiei infection) were promoted through S. scabiei inoculation.

The lack of an intact epidermis or cuticle results in uncontrolled loss of water. However, neither the tumor nor the host plant displays wilting. This phenomenon points to drought adaptation in both tumors and the crown gall host plant. To understand the underlying molecular mechanisms of protection against desiccation the gene expression pattern of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) tumors was integrated with the profile of stress metabolites: Arabidopsis tumors accumulated high amounts of abscisic acid (ABA), the ethylene precursor aminocyclopropyl carboxylic acid, osmoprotectants, and form a suberized periderm-like protective layer. <b>Suberization</b> of the outer tumor cell layers most likely is mediated by ABA since external application of ABA induced <b>suberization</b> of Arabidopsis roots. However, the expression level of the classical marker genes, known to respond to drought stress and/or ABA, was lower in tumors. Instead another set of drought and/or ABA-inducible genes was more highly transcribed. Elevated transcription of several ABA-dependent aquaporin genes might indicate that ABA controls the water balance of the tumor. The retarded tumor growth on abi and aba mutant plants underlined the importance of a tumor-specific ABA signaling pathway. Taken together, we propose that ABA is an important signal for protection of tumors against desiccation and thus supports tumor development...|$|E

Efforts are under-way to engineer improved varieties of the C 3 cereal crop rice by introducing NADP-malic enzyme C 4 photosynthesis using maize as a model system. However, several modifications to the rice leaf vasculature are potentially necessary, including the introduction of suberin lamellae into the bundle sheath cell walls. Suberized cell walls are ubiquitous in the root endodermis of all grasses, and developmental similarities are apparent between endodermis and bundle sheath cell walls. Nonetheless, there is considerable heterogeneity in sheath cell development and suberin composi-tion both within and between grass taxa. The effect of this variation on physiological function remains ambiguous over forty years after suberin lamellae were initially proposed to regulate solute and photoassimilate fluxes and C 4 gas exchange. Interspecies variation has confounded efforts to ascribe physiological differences specifically to the pres-ence or absence of suberin lamellae. Thus, specific perturbation of <b>suberization</b> within a uniform genetic background is needed, but, until recently, the genetic resources to manipulate suberin composition in the grasses were largely unavailable.

However, the current knowledge on the {{formation of}} these two distinct endodermal barriers and their regulatory role in nutrient transport is still limited. Here, we identify an uncharacterized gene, LOTR 1, essential for Casparian strip formation in Arabidopsis thaliana.

Degradation by expression of a suberin-degrading enzyme in the mutants revealed that the ectopic <b>suberization</b> at the endodermal cells limits Ca transport through the transmembrane pathway, thereby causing reduced Ca delivery to the shoot. Moreover, analysis of the mutants showed that suberin lamellae function as an apoplastic diffusion barrier to the stele at sites of lateral root emergence where Casparian strips are disrupted.

In the normal roots, the major aliphatic components were ω-hydroxy acids and dicarboxylic acids in which saturated C 16 and monounsaturated C 18 were the dominant homologues. Iron-deficient bean roots contained only 11 % of the aliphatic components of suberin found in control roots although the relative composition of the constituents was not significantly affected by iron deficiency. Analysis of the aromatic components of the suberin polymer that could be released by alkaline nitrobenzene oxidation of bean root samples showed a 95 % decrease in p-hydroxybenzaldehyde, vanillin, and syringaldehyde under iron-deficient conditions. The inhibition of suberin synthesis in bean roots was not due to a decrease in Fe-dependent ω-hydroxylase activity since normal ω-hydroxylation could be demonstrated, both in vitro with microsomal preparations and in situ by labeling of ω-hydroxy and dicarboxylic acids with [14 C]acetate. The level of the isozyme of peroxidase that is specifically associated with <b>suberization</b> was suppressed by iron deficiency to 25 % of that found in control roots.

In the present paper, histochemical, structural and biochemical data, particularly, regarding the polyaromatic domain of suberized tissues, are critically reviewed. A revised description of the polyaromatic domain of suberized tissues, based on the consensus that is emerging from the current data, is presented and especially includes a spatially distinct (poly) hydroxycinnamoyl-containing macromolecule...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{provides}} new insights {{on the role}} of the potato (Solanum tuberosum) suberin feruloyl transferase FHT in native and wound tissues, leading to conclusions about hitherto unknown properties of the phellogen. In agreement with the enzymatic role of FHT, it is shown that its transcriptional activation and protein accumulation are specific to tissues that undergo <b>suberization</b> such as the root boundary layers of the exodermis and the endodermis, along with the tuber periderm. Remarkably, FHT expression and protein accumulation within the periderm is restricted to the phellogen derivative cells with phellem identity. FHT levels in the periderm are at their peak near harvest during periderm maturation, with the phellogen becoming meristematically inactive and declining thereafter. However, periderm FHT levels remain high for several months after harvest, suggesting that the inactive phellogen retains the capacity to synthesize ferulate esters. Tissue wounding induces FHT expression and the protein accumulates from the first stages of the healing process onwards. FHT is up-regulated by abscisic acid and down-regulated by salicylic acid, emphasizing the complex regulation of suberin synthesis and wound healing. These findings open up new prospects important for the clarification of the <b>suberization</b> process and yield important information with regard to the skin quality of potatoesThe authors thank Professor S.

40|$|The anionic {{peroxidase}} {{associated with}} the <b>suberization</b> response in potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) tubers during wound healing has been purified and partially characterized at the biochemical level. It is a 45 -kD, class III (plant secretory) peroxidase that is localized to suberizing tissues and shows a preference for feruloyl (o-methoxyphenol) -substituted substrates (order of substrate preference: feruloyl > caffeoyl > p-coumaryl ≈ syringyl) {{such as those that}} accumulate in tubers during wound healing. There was little influence on oxidation by side chain derivatization, although hydroxycinnamates were preferred over the corresponding hydroxycinnamyl alcohols. The substrate specificity pattern is consistent with the natural substrate incorporation into potato wound suberin. In contrast, the cationic peroxidase(s) induced in response to wound healing in potato tubers is present in both suberizing and nonsuberizing tissues and does not discriminate between hydroxycinnamates and hydroxycinnamyl alcohols. A synthetic polymer prepared using E-[8 - 13 C]ferulic acid, H 2 O 2, and the purified anionic enzyme contained a significant amount of cross-linking through C- 8, albeit with retention of unsaturation...|$|E
40|$|Increasing soil {{salinity}} reduces crop yields worldwide, with rice being particularly affected. We {{have examined the}} correlation between apoplastic barrier formation in roots, Na(+) uptake into shoots and plant survival for three rice (Oryza sativa L.) cultivars of varying salt sensitivity: the salt-tolerant Pokkali, moderately tolerant Jaya and sensitive IR 20. Rice plants grown hydroponically or in soil for 1 month were subjected to both severe and moderate salinity stress. Apoplastic barriers in roots were visualized using fluorescence microscopy and their chemical composition determined by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. Na(+) content was estimated by flame photometry. <b>Suberization</b> of apoplastic barriers in roots of Pokkali was the most extensive of the three cultivars, while Na(+) accumulation in the shoots was the least. Saline stress induced the strengthening of these barriers in both sensitive and tolerant cultivars, with increase in mRNAs encoding suberin biosynthetic enzymes being detectable within 30 min of stress. Enhanced barriers were detected after several days of moderate stress. Overall, more extensive apoplastic barriers in roots correlated with reduced Na(+) uptake and enhanced survival when challenged with high salinity...|$|E
40|$|The {{polymeric}} material (suberin) {{of the wound}} periderm of potato tuber slices was analyzed after depolymerization with LiAIH 4 in tetrahydrofuran or BF 3 in methanol {{with the use of}} thin layer chromatography, chemical modification, and combined gas-liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. Fatty acids (C 16 to C 26), fatty alcohols (C 16 to C 26), octadec- 9 -ene- 1, 18 -dioic acid, and 18 -hydroxy-octadec- 9 -enoic acid were identified to be the major components. Based on the structural information that the two bifunctional C 18 molecules constituted a major portion of suberin, a gas chromatographic method of measuring <b>suberization</b> was developed. This method consisted of hydrogenolysis of powdered tissue followed by thin layer chromatography and gas chromatographic measurement of octadecene- 1, 18 -diol as the trimethylsilyl ether. With this assay it was shown that the development of resistance to water loss by the tissue slices was directly proportional to the quantity of the bifunctional C 18 molecules, thus providing evidence that a function of suberin is prevention of water loss...|$|E
