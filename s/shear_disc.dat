The use of back support belts has been forwarded as a counter measure towards reducing low-back injuries in the industrial setting. PURPOSE: The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine if a back support belt relieves stresses encountered by the lumbar spine during stoop type lifting and potentially reduce the risk of injury. METHODS: Twelve male participants (49. 7 ± 3. 7 years) performed two sessions of stooped type lifting with a loaded milk crate (11. 5 kg), at 4 repetitions per minute, for 15 minutes in accordance with the NIOSH lifting equation. One lifting session was performed without a support belt, while the other with a support belt. Three sets of fluoroscopic images were collected with the participants positioned at the initiation (flexed trunk), mid-range, and completion of the lift (erect standing). The first series of images were collected under a no-load condition, while the second (no support belt) and third series (support belt) of images were collected with the participants lifting the 11. 5 kg milk crate. Images were imported into AutoCAD where lumbar disc deformation and joint angles were measured by calculating changes in position of adjacent vertebra (L 3 - 4 and L 4 - 5). A reduction of disc deformation was deemed indicative of reduced stress.

40|$|Graduation date: 1998 Study Design. This study {{investigated}} {{the effects of a}} lumbar support belt on lumbar disc deformation and joint angles. Trunk strength and endurance were also compared to disc deformation and joint angles to determine if any meaningful relationships existed. Objective. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine if back support belts relieve stresses encountered by the lumbar spine during lifting activities and thus reduce the risk of injury. Additionally, trunk strength and endurance measures were collected in order to determine if strong, well conditioned trunk musculature aids in the support of the lumbar spine. Summary of Background Data. Low-back pain and injury are responsible for a major portion of lost work days and injury compensation claims. Back support belts have been proposed as a counter measure towards reducing low-back injuries in the industrial setting. Methods. Twelve male subjects (average age, 49. 7 years) performed two sessions of stoop type lifting with a loaded milk crate (11. 5 kg), at a rate of 4 repetitions per minute, for a total 15 minutes per session in accordance with the NIOSH 1993 lifting equation. The order of testing with and without a belt was randomized for the two sessions. Fluoroscopic images were collected prior to and following both lifting sessions. Fluoroscopic images were collected with the subjects positioned at the initiation (flexed trunk), mid-range, and completion of the lift (erect standing). Images were imported into Auto Cad where lumbar disc deformation and joint angles were measured by calculating changes in position of adjacent vertebra (L 3 - 4 and L 4 - 5). A reduction of deformation was deemed indicative of reduced stress. Trunk extension and flexion strength were measured with a Kin Com isokinetic dynamometer. Trunk flexion endurance was measured via a 60 second curl-up test. Results. Analysis of variance revealed that compressive and <b>shear</b> <b>disc</b> deformation were reduced while in the erect trunk posture for the support belt condition (p. 05).

During stoop type lifting, support belts provide a measurable amount of stress reduction of the lumbar spine when the trunk is in the erect posture, with little effect during flexed trunk positions.

In this limit, the presence of shocks is found to cause the wave amplitude to decrease with time as 1 /t^ 2. The validity of the analytic description is confirmed by direct numerical solution of the full nonlinear equations of motion.

40|$|A {{generalized}} mean {{magnetic field}} induction equation for differential rotators is derived, including a compressibility, and the anisotropy induced on the turbulent quantities from the mean magnetic field itself and a mean velocity shear. Derivations {{of the mean}} field equations often do not emphasize {{that there must be}} anisotropy and inhomogeneity in the turbulence for mean field growth. The anisotropy from shear is the source of a term involving the product of the mean velocity gradient and the cross-helicity correlation of the isotropic parts of the fluctuating velocity and magnetic field, ·^(0). The full mean field equations are derived to linear order in mean fields, but it is also shown that the cross-helicity term survives to all orders in the velocity shear. This cross-helicity term can obviate the need for a pre-existing seed mean magnetic field for mean field growth: though a fluctuating seed field is necessary for a non-vanishing cross-helicity, the term can produce linear (in time) mean field growth of the toroidal field from zero mean field. After one vertical diffusion time, the cross-helicity term becomes sub-dominant and dynamo exponential amplification/sustenance of the mean field can subsequently ensue. The cross-helicity term should produce odd symmetry in the mean magnetic field, in contrast to the usually favored even modes of the dynamo amplification in <b>sheared</b> <b>discs.</b> This may be important for the observed mean field geometries of spiral galaxies. The strength of the mean seed field provided by the cross- helicity depends linearly on the magnitude of the cross-helicity.

40|$|We {{study and}} {{elucidate}} {{the mechanism of}} spiral density wave excitation in a differentially rotating turbulent flow. We formulate a set of wave equations with sources that are only non-zero {{in the presence of}} turbulent fluctuations. We solve these in a shearing box domain using a WKBJ method. It is found that, for a particular azimuthal wave length, the wave excitation occurs through a sequence of regularly spaced swings during which the wave changes from leading to trailing form. This is a generic process that is expected to occur in <b>shearing</b> <b>discs</b> with turbulence. Trailing waves of equal amplitude propagating in opposite directions are produced, both of which produce an outward angular momentum flux that we give expressions for as functions of the disc parameters and azimuthal wave length. By solving the wave amplitude equations numerically we justify the WKBJ approach for a Keplerian rotation law for all parameter regimes of interest. In order to quantify the wave excitation completely the important wave source terms need to be specified. Assuming conditions of weak nonlinearity, these can be identified and are associated with a quantity related to the potential vorticity, being the only survivors in the linear regime. Under the additional assumption that the source has a flat power spectrum at long azimuthal wave lengths, the optimal azimuthal wave length produced is found to be determined solely by the WKBJ response and is estimated to be 2 pi H, with H being the nominal disc scale height.

Scoliosis is a 3 -dimensional deformity of the spine that presents itself mainly in adolescent girls and elderly patients. Our concept of its etiopathogenesis is that an excess of posteriorly directed shear loads, relative to the body's intrinsic stabilizing mechanisms, induces a torsional instability of the spine, making it vulnerable to scoliosis.

In an adult lumbar motion segment model, the disc properties were varied to simulate different aspects of disc degeneration. These models were then loaded with a pure torsion moment in combination with either a shear load in posterior direction, no shear, or a shear load in anterior direction. Results. Posteriorly directed shear loads reduced torsion stiffness, anteriorly directed shear loads increased torsion stiffness.

40|$|The {{intervertebral}} disc (IVD) {{is a unique}} soft tissue structure which provides structural support and flexibility in the axial skeleton of vertebrates. From a structural perspective, the disc behaves somewhat like a thick walled pressure vessel, where the walls are comprised {{of a series of}} composite annular rings (lamellae). However, a prior study (Marchand and Ahmed, 1990) found a high proportion of circumferentially discontinuous lamellae in human lumbar IVDs.

As a result of stretching, the vortex aspect ratio increases and a weaker azimuthal density contrast develops. The strength of the vortex stretching is proportional to the disc mass.

The angular momentum lost from the disc during the encounter is derived from linear theory, for distant fly-bys, as well as the changes to the disc orientation expected in non-coplanar encounters.

This small precession is shown to give rise to a relative tilt of the disc which is always more important for determining its final orientation than is the change to the orbital inclination.

The disc wobbles with a period approximately equal to half the binary’s orbital period and precesses on a longer timescale. We determine the characteristic timescale for realignment of the disc with the orbital plane due to dissipation. If the dissipation is determined by a simple isotropic viscosity then we find, in line with previous studies, that the alignment timescale is of order the viscous evolution timescale. However, for typical protostellar disc parameters, if the disc tilt exceeds the opening angle of the disc, then tidally induced <b>shearing</b> within the <b>disc</b> is transonic. In general, hydrodynamic instabilities associated with the internally driven shear result in extra dissipation which is expected to drastically reduce the alignment timescale.

The 3 [...] dimensional magnetic field outside the disc is calculated in a potential field approximation from the magnetic flux density distribution in the disc. For uniformly rotating discs we confirm numerically the existence of the interchange instability as predicted by Spruit, Stehle & Papaloizou (1995). In agreement with predictions from the <b>shearing</b> sheet model, <b>discs</b> with Keplerian rotation are found to be stabilized by the shear, as long as the contribution of magnetic forces to support against gravity is small. When this support becomes significant, we find a global instability which transports angular momentum outward and allows mass to accrete inward. The instability {{takes the form of a}} m= 1 rotating `crescent', reminiscent of the purely hydrodynamic nonlinear instability previously found in pressure-supported discs. A model where the initial surface mass density Σ(r) and B_z(r) decrease with radius as power laws shows transient mass accretion during about 6 orbital periods, and settles into a state with surface density and field strength decreasing approximately exponentially with radius. We argue that this instability is likely to be the main angular momentum transport mechanism in discs with a poloidal magnetic field sufficiently strong to suppress magnetic turbulence.

40|$|Abridged) We analyse the {{stability}} and evolution of power-law accretion disc models. These have midplane densities that follow radial power-laws, and have either temperature or entropy distributions that are power-law functions of cylindrical radius. We employ two different hydrodynamic codes to perform 2 D-axisymmetric and 3 D simulations that examine the long-term evolution of the disc models {{as a function of}} the power-law indices of the temperature or entropy, the thermal relaxation time of the fluid, and the viscosity. We present a stability analysis of the problem that we use to interpret the simulation results. We find that disc models whose temperature or entropy profiles cause the equilibrium angular velocity to vary with height are unstable to the growth of modes with wavenumber ratios |k_R/k_Z| >> 1 when the thermodynamic response of the fluid is isothermal, or the thermal evolution time is comparable to or shorter than the local dynamical time scale. These discs are subject to the Goldreich-Schubert-Fricke (GSF) or `vertical shear' linear instability. Development of the instability involves excitation of vertical breathing and corrugation modes in the disc, with the corrugation modes in particular being a feature of the nonlinear saturated state. Instability operates when the dimensionless disc kinematic viscosity nu H c_s/nu > 2500). In 3 D the instability generates a quasi-turbulent flow, and the Reynolds stress produces a fluctuating effective viscosity coefficient whose mean value reaches alpha ~ 6 x 10 ^{- 4 } by the end of the simulation.

We analyse the linear dynamics of non-axisymmetric convection and spiral density waves in a Keplerian disc with superadiabatic vertical stratification using the local shearing box approach. It is demonstrated that the shear associated with Keplerian differential rotation introduces a novel phenomenon, it causes these two perturbation modes to become coupled: during evolution the convective mode generates (trailing) spiral density waves and can therefore be regarded as a new source of spiral density waves in discs. The wave generation process studied here owes its existence solely to <b>shear</b> of the <b>disc's</b> differential rotation, and is a special manifestation of a more general linear mode coupling phenomena universally taking place in flows with an inhomogeneous velocity profile. We quantify the efficiency of spiral density wave generation by convection as a function of azimuthal and vertical wavenumbers of these modes and find that it is maximal and most powerful when both these length-scales are comparable to the disc scale height. We also show that unlike the convective mode, which tends to transport angular momentum inwards in the linear regime, the spiral density waves transport angular momentum outwards. Based on these findings, we suggest that in the non-linear regime spiral density waves generated by convection {{may play a role in}} enhancing the transport of angular momentum due the convective mode alone, which is actually being changed to outward by non-linearity, as indicated by above-mentioned recent developments.

For this imaging, flow field is seeded with particles of water or DEHS in case of free jet studies and with acetone for confined jet studies. Using high power laser and high speed camera, flow field is illuminated and captured. A series of simple image processing routines are carried out to extract the noticeable attributes of the flow. Prominent flow features like Mach <b>disc,</b> <b>shear</b> layer instability and shock cells are captured in the instantaneous PLMS images of a severely under-expanded supersonic axisymmetric free jet of design Mach number (M-D) 1. 367. Qualitative increase in the shock cell spacing (L-s) for increasing Mach number ratio (M-R) is observed for time-averaged PLMS imaging of a supersonic axisymmetric free jet (M-D = 2. 0 & 2. 5). Also an effective increase in the jet width of an over-expanded jet undergoing screech is noticed. Major flow features like large scale coherent structures and terminal potential core instability are seen clearly in the instantaneous PLMS images of a rectangular supersonic confined jet of M-PD = 2. 0. Shock cell spacing and mixing layer formation are observed distinctly in the time-averaged PLMS images. Qualitative increase in L-s for increasing stagnation pressure ratio (SPR) is highlighted along {{with the increase in}} the wavelength of the potential core instability. More details regarding the experimentation procedure and the underlying physics behind the observed flow features along with the variations encountered for different operating conditions are discussed elaborately in this paper...|$|R
40|$|Low {{back pain}} is a {{debilitating}} condition that afflicts {{millions of people}} each year. It is characterized by complex biochemical, morphological, and biomechanical changes. However, most believe low back pain arises due to abnormal mechanical loading, inflammation, and disc degeneration. Several studies have investigated radial back pain, but to date, {{there is only one}} in vivo animal model for low back pain. Despite advances in science, the causes of low back pain remain unclear and treatments fail to relieve the pain. To better understand the causative factors of low back pain, a reliable animal model is needed. This study was designed to advance the knowledge of the previous in vivo animal model for low back pain by investigating the effects of <b>shear</b> loading on <b>disc</b> degeneration (for a longer duration of time) and discogenic low back pain (in terms of immunohistochemistry) in hopes developing better treatment strategies for low back pain sufferers and to help elucidate the etiology of low back pain. Adult male Sprague Dawley rats (n= 31) were shear loaded for 4 - and 8 - weeks. Pain behavioral testing was done prior to and after surgery. After sacrifice, immunohistochemistry was used to detect the presence of pain in the intervertebral discs and the spinal cord. Results {{of this study indicate that}} the application of an abnormal shear load gives rise to disc degeneration. Histology revealed that all loaded levels as well as the adjacent levels degenerated due to the shear load. Pain behavior testing revealed that the rats did experience pain, however, when combined with the immunohistochemical results, we were able to exclude the pain as pain stemming from the degenerated discs. Surprisingly, we observed that shear loading caused scoliosis of the thoracolumbar spine...|$|R

40|$|Whiplash {{injuries}} {{occur in}} automotive crashes and may cause long term health {{issues such as}} headache, neck pain, and visual and auditory disturbance. Whiplash-Associated Disorders are very costly and can impair the quality of human lives. Most studies focus on whiplash injuries that occur in neutral position head postures, although {{there is some evidence}} in the literature that non-neutral head posture can significantly increase the persistence of symptoms on patients. Crash dummies have limited biofidelity particularly for out-of-position scenarios and the current neck injury criteria were not derived for situations at which the head motion is not through the sagittal plane. Therefore Finite Element Methods provide an important tool {{that can be used to}} predict injury in different impact scenarios. The Finite Element model which was used for this study was previously developed at the University of Waterloo representing a 50 th percentile male. The model had been previously validated at the segment level in extension, flexion, tension, and axial rotation. The full cervical spine model was validated in frontal and rear impact as well as tension. Since the final validation of the model, the ligament properties of the upper cervical spine and the muscle implementations had been improved to enhance the biofidelity of the model. To further improve the model, the addition of laxities to the ligaments of the upper cervical spine was studied. Several studies were performed based on the experiments in the literature to determine appropriate laxities for the upper cervical spine model. First, the laxities of - 2 to 4 mm on all the ligaments were studied on the segment level of the model to find their effect on the failure force and displacement to failure in extension, flexion, tension, and axial rotation. The model development then went through a series of iterations in order to achieve laxity values that satisfied the failure force and displacement to failure reported in the literature for the four loading cases. Finally the laxities were used on a full cervical spine model and tested in physiological range of motion in extension, flexion, axial rotation, and lateral bending. The laxities were optimized using an iterative process. The results of this study provided laxity values that were acceptable in both segments level failure study and full cervical spine physiological range of motion study. The model was also validated against literature in impact scenarios. Using a cadaver experiment of 7 g rear impact, the global kinematics of the cervical spine was verified against the literature. The model provided good agreement with the head kinematics and relative rotations between the vertebrae for the cadaver tests. An 8 g rear impact cadaver test was used to validate the ligament strains and <b>disc</b> <b>shear</b> strains. For the anterior longitudinal ligament, the capsular ligament, and the <b>disc</b> <b>shear</b> strains, the model results were within one standard deviation of the literature in the majority of cervical spine regions that were reported. The model was also validated against volunteer low severity rear impact to verify the active musculature in the cervical spine. The head kinematics was generally within the boundaries that were reported by the literature. The model was compared to an experiment that used cadavers to investigate non-neutral rear impact scenarios. This experiment used cables and springs to replicate the passive behaviour of the musculature. The model showed good agreement with the extension and axial rotation results in both head kinematics and relative vertebrae rotations. The flexion and lateral bending results were not similar to the experimental data; attributed to the difference in muscle implementation between the two models. A total of 24 simulations were completed to find the effect of impact severity, axial rotation, and muscle activations on ligament strains during out-of-position rear impacts. The results illustrated that in general, ligament strains increased with the severity of impact and decreased with muscle activation. In out-of-position scenarios, the strains increased in some of the ligaments. An increase to the ligament strain as a result of non-neutral posture was mostly visible in the capsular ligaments of the upper cervical spine. The alar ligament and the apical ligaments of the upper cervical spine may fail in out-of-position at high rear impact scenarios. Recommendations for future work on the cervical spine Finite Element model includes the validation of the musculature and the usage of the muscles to rotate the head to a desired position to improve the biofidelity of the model and the results in out-of-position rear impacts. Further optimization of the laxities of the upper cervical spine can increase the biofidelity in this region. The modeling of the vertebral arteries into the FE model can help investigate whether out-of-position can increase the chance of injury of this region. The effect of flexion, extension, lateral bending, and their combination with axial rotation and the study of frontal and side impacts can be helpful in design of safer headrests for vehicles...|$|R
40|$|In this {{contribution}} {{the ordering}} and stacking kinetics of layered concentrated colloid dispersions are described, especially the structure in a layer {{and between the}} layers. For this purpose the theory of Bragg reflections in the liquid and solid state is applied. The charge stabilised particles of defined site and small polydispersity are prepared by the technique of emulsion copolymerisation. The solid like structures were prepared in a Couette or <b>disc</b> <b>shear</b> cell. The uniform crystal ordering was achieved by shearing. By the method of small angle scattering of X-rays the vectors of scattering were obtained. Rotation of the sample perpendicular to the incident beam yields the intensity distribution along certain Bragg rods in the reciprocal space necessary for studying the stacking order. Two ways of getting structure information on the mentioned dispersions were applied. In the first case using the step by step method the dispersion was rotated perpendicular to the direction of flow (beta-rotation). Secondly the hexagonal layers in the Couette cell were oriented by the self-focusing tangential position parallel to the beam direction. The intensity distribution along the Bragg rods perpendicular to the layers {{is determined by the}} scattering. The results of this less accurate tangential method are comparable with those of the more exact step by step procedure. It is a new attractive method of getting information about the structure of concentrated colloidal dispersions. The oriented structure of the colloidal systems can be verified by comparing the results of these two methods with those of radial scattering. Two different aspects of crystallisation are available from the white or black Bragg rods. First the growing of cubic crystals along the black rods was recognised by the determination of the layer distances c. Secondly kinetics {{of the structure of the}} random or crystalline stacking of the hexagonal layers is investigated by the homogenous or inhomogenous intensity distribution of the white Bragg rods. In this case the transition of the closed packed fcc crystal to the random stacking sequence or vice versa was observed with spontaneous or forced manipulation of the dispersion ordering due to variation of the inner (range of interaction, particle distance, relaxation time) or outer (shear rate) parameters. By seed emulsion polymerisation it is possible to prepare core shell particles with a shell adopted to the medium, which are necessary for the microscopic investigation or light scattering investigations of concentrated dispersions. Particles with this wanted structure and a small polydispersity were obtained neither in one nor in two polymerisation steps...|$|R
40|$|Since {{the first}} {{publication}} of the crystal structure of vanadyl pyrophosphate (VPP/(VO) 2 P 2 O 7) in 1979 [1] the question arose whether the unique catalytic properties of this compound in the oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride (MA) {{are associated with the}} exposure of a special crystallographic plane of the VPP crystal, i. e. the plane parallel to (100). Compared to the other planes the (100) plane is more exposed in high performance catalysts exhibiting platelet type habit than in VPP catalysts having other habits [2]. Therefore, it has been postulated that the butane oxidation is structure sensitive to the (100) plane [3] and the VPP crystal has been assumed to be catalytically anisotropic [4]. To answer the main question concerning the catalytic anisotropy of VPP vanadyl hydrogenphosphate hemihydrate (VHP/VOHPO 4 · 0, 5 H 2 O) precursors prepared either by crystallization from aqueous solution (VHPH 2 O) or from alcoholic medium (VHPROH) and VPP catalysts exhibiting different morphology were tribomechanically treated (TT) in different laboratory mills: mortar (main energy input: <b>shear</b> forces), vibratory <b>disc</b> (<b>shear,</b> pressure), planetary ball (impact, friction). The duration and the strength of the treatment were varied. After shaping VHP granulate (1. 25 - 2. 5 mm) was transformed into fresh VPP in a tubular reactor under oxidizing conditions. All the VPP samples were conditioned for more than 12 h at reaction conditions to form quasi-equilibrated catalysts. The catalytic tests were carried out in a tubular reactor (1. 5 vol% n?butane/air, flow rate: 3 - 18 l/hSTP). VHP and VPP were characterized by X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) using a STADI P (Stoe, Germany) set-up (transmission, Ge primary monochromator, CuKa 1, capillary technique). The orientation factors o 1 characterizing the deviation of the habit from cube-shaped (o 1 = 1) to platelet-shaped (o 1 1) were calculated applying the March-Dollase function. The average primary crystallite sizes, internal micro strains, lattice parameters, and the proportions of the X-ray amorphous fraction were determined using appropriate software. The TT of VHPH 2 O and also of the fresh catalyst VPPH 2 O led to an improvement of the selectivity and activity in the conversion of n-butane. Hence, the maximum MA yields (temperature range: 430 … 460 °C) were en-hanced by 4 mol % independent of the type of mill used and when milling was carried out (TT of VHP or of fresh VPP). From the differences in the MA selectivities of untreated and milled samples found at low values of n-butane conversion it is to be concluded that milling of VHPH 2 O enhances both the number of active sites and the ratio of selective to non selective sites of n-butane conversion. In contrast to the changes in selectivity the increase in activity due to the TT of VHPH 2 O seems to depend on the type of mill used: the higher the sup-posed energy input the higher the catalytic activity. The results for VPPROH differ significantly from those obtained with VPPH 2 O. Surprisingly, the TT of VHPROH neither influenced markedly the mass related activity nor the MA selectivity at the reaction conditions chosen. However, milling of the fresh VPPROH led to an increase in activity associated with an enhancement in MA yield by 4 mol% due to the lower reaction temperature necessary to achieve the optimum n-butane conversion degree. From XRPD it was concluded that the crystals of both VPPH 2 O and VPPROH as well as of VHPH 2 O and VHPROH are distinguished by different orientation factors o 1 which are characteristic for a cubic (o 1 = 1, VPPH 2 O and VHPH 2 O) and a platelet-like habit (o 1 = 0. 6, VPPROH and VHPROH), resp. These factors behaved differently in the treatment process: for VHPH 2 O o 1 remained constant, i. e. the original cubic habit did not change. In contrast, o 1 of the platelet-shaped VHPROH changed drastically from 0. 6 to 1. 0, i. e. to cubic habit. These results are confirmed by SEM images and speak against a pre-ferred exposure of a special surface plane of the VPP crystals after each kind of milling procedure and, there-fore, against a correlation of catalytic performance and the exposure mentioned. The results of VHPH 2 O microstructure analysis revealed that TT caused a marked reduction of the unit cell volumes and a relatively isotropic lattice contraction. Furthermore, TT led to drastically changed crystallite sizes and internal micro strains whereas both the selectivity and the activity of all the milled catalytic materials increased as described above. Analogous microstructure changes were obtained in the case of VHPROH/VPPROH. These results of the microstructure analysis and of the catalytic tests show that VPP is not catalytically anisotropic: the improved catalytic properties of the tribome-chanically treated VPP samples cannot be due to the exposure of a special surface plane since the orienta-tion factors of all materials became 1 after milling. In the case of VHPH 2 O, the enhanced catalytic performance could be associated with an increase in disorder in VPPH 2 O crystals expressed by the observed changes in micro strains, crystallite sizes, and unit cell volumes. On the other hand, such properties like the number of step sites of the comminuted particles should be considered, too. In this sense a structure sensitivity of the n-butane oxidation on VPPH 2 O cannot be excluded. However, the unique catalytic properties of VPP in the oxidation of n-butane to MA are not associated with an exclusive exposure of the active sites on surface planes parallel to (100...|$|R
40|$|Soft tissue {{cervical}} spine (neck) injuries, {{known as}} ‘whiplash’, are a {{leading cause of}} injury in motor vehicle collisions. A detailed finite element (FE) model of the cervical spine that is able to predict local tissue injury is a vital tool to improve safety systems in cars, through understanding of injury mechanisms at the tissue level and evaluation of new safety systems. This is the motivation for the formation of the Global Human Body Models Consortium, which is a collective of major automotive manufacturers with the goal of producing a detailed FE human body model to predict occupant response in crash. This work builds on an existing detailed cervical spine model, with a focus on improved validation in terms of kinematics and tissue level response. The neck model used in this research represents a 50 th percentile male and was developed at the University of Waterloo. The model includes both passive and active musculature, detailed nucleus and annulus models of the discs, rate dependent non-linear ligaments, facet capsules with a squeeze film model of the synovial fluid, and rigid vertebrae with the geometry derived from CT scans. The material properties were determined from published experimental testing and were not calibrated to improve the model response. The model was previously validated at the segment level. In this study, the model was validated for tension loading, local tissue response during both frontal and rear impacts, and head kinematic response during frontal and rear impact. The whole neck model without musculature was exposed to a tensile load up to 300 N and the predicted response was within the experimental corridors throughout. The ligament strains and <b>disc</b> <b>shear</b> strains predicted by the model were compared to bench-top cadaver tests. In frontal impact, the ligament and disc strains were within a standard deviation of the experiments 26 / 30 and 12 / 15 times respectively. In rear impact, the strains were within a standard deviation of the experiments 9 / 10 and 12 / 15 times for the ligaments and discs respectively. All of the ligament strains were within two standard deviation of the experimental average and the disc strains were all within three standard deviations. The global kinematic response of the head for 4 g and 7 g rear impacts and 7 g and 15 g frontal impacts was generally a good fit to the experimental corridors. These impact loads are relevant to the low speed impacts that generally cause whiplash. In the global kinematic validation, the model was shown to oscillate more, which is likely {{due to the lack of}} soft-tissues such as the skin and fat or the lack of high-rate material data for the intervertebral discs. In rear impact, the head over extended by 17 ° and 6 ° for 4 g and 7 g impacts respectively; this is likely due to difficulties defining the facet gap or lack of uncovertebral joints. Even with these limitations the model response for these varied modes of loading was considered excellent. A review of organic causes of whiplash revealed the most likely sources of whiplash include the capsular ligament, other ligaments, and the vertebral discs. The model was exposed to frontal and rear impacts with increasing severities until the soft tissue strains reached damage thresholds. In frontal impact, these strains started to reach damage values at a 15 g impact. The disc annulus fibres were likely injured at 10 g in a rear impact, and the ligaments were likely injured at 14 g in a rear impact. These impact severities agree with findings from real-life accidents where long term consequences were found in rear impacts from 9 g to 15 g. The model was used to show that bench-top cadaver impacts under predict strain because they lack active musculature. A number of recommendations have been proposed to improve the biofidelity of the model including perform in-vivo measurement of human facet gaps, incorporate the uncovertebral joints, measure rate-dependent properties for the annulus fibrosus of the disc, include non-structural soft tissues for increased damping, determine a muscle activation strategy that can maintain head posture in a gravity field, and continue to develop relationships between prolonged painful injury and strain in structures of the neck other than the capsular ligaments. Furthermore, it was recommended that the model should be developed further for whiplash injury prediction with out of position occupants...|$|R
