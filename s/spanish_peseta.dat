For {{the first three years}} of its existence it was an invisible currency, only used in accountancy. Euro cash was not introduced until 1 January 2002, when it replaced the national banknotes and coins of the countries in eurozone 12, such as the French franc and the <b>Spanish</b> <b>peseta.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{study of}} central bank {{interventions}} on the US dollar and Deutsche mark found only limited {{evidence of any}} substantial effect on deviations from UIRP. UIRP {{has been found to}} hold over very small spans of time (covering only a number of hours) with a high frequency of bilateral exchange rate data. Tests of UIRP for economies experiencing institutional regime changes, using monthly exchange rate data for the US dollar versus the Deutsche mark and the <b>Spanish</b> <b>peseta</b> versus the British pound, have found some evidence that UIRP held when US and German regime changes were volatile, and held between Spain and the United Kingdom particularly after Spain joined the European Union in 1986 and began liberalizing capital mobility.|$|E

25|$|The Andorran peseta (ADP) (pesseta in Catalan) was pegged at 1:1 to the <b>Spanish</b> <b>peseta.</b> Following the {{outbreak}} of the Spanish Civil War on 17 July 1936, the Consell General de les Valls d'Andorra issued Decree No. 112 of 19 December 1936, authorizing the issuance of paper money backed by Spanish banknotes.|$|E

25|$|A grid (known as the Parity Grid) of {{bilateral}} rates was calculated {{on the basis}} of these central rates expressed in ECUs, and currency fluctuations had to be contained within a margin of 2.25% on either side of the bilateral rates (with the exception of the Italian lira, the <b>Spanish</b> <b>peseta,</b> the Portuguese escudo and the pound sterling, which were allowed to fluctuate by ±6%). Determined intervention and loan arrangements protected the participating currencies from greater exchange rate fluctuations.|$|E
25|$|Andorra is not {{a member}} of the European Union, but enjoys a special {{relationship}} with it, such as being treated as an EU member for trade in manufactured goods (no tariffs) and as a non-EU member for agricultural products. Andorra lacked a currency of its own and used both the French franc and the <b>Spanish</b> <b>peseta</b> in banking transactions until 31 December 1999, when both currencies were replaced by the EU's single currency, the euro. Coins and notes of both the franc and the peseta remained legal tender in Andorra until 31 December 2002. Andorra negotiated to issue its own euro coins, beginning in 2014.|$|E

2500|$|The Law of Banking Ordination (...) of December 29, 1921, {{alternatively}} called Cambó Law ( [...] , {{named after}} Minister of Finance Francesc Cambó), attempted {{for the first}} time to organize the relations within the Bank of Spain as a central bank and as a private bank. The law also regulated the conditions under which the gold reserves could be mobilized by the Bank, which required the preceptive approval of the Council of Ministers. The Cambó Law stipulated that the Government had the power to approach the entity and solicit the selling of the Bank's gold reserves exclusively to influence the exchange rate of the <b>Spanish</b> <b>peseta</b> and to [...] "exercise an interventionist action in the international exchange and in the regularity of the monetary market", in which case the Bank of Spain would participate in such action with a quantity of gold equal to that dictated by the Treasury.|$|E
25|$|The {{gold was}} heavily escorted and was transported via railway, {{according}} to witnesses of the events. A {{few days after}} the extraction of the gold from the Bank of Spain, Bank functionaries retrieved the Bank's silver, valued at a total of 656,708,702.59 <b>Spanish</b> <b>pesetas</b> of the time, which was later sold to the United States and France between June 1938 and July 1939 for a sum slightly more than 20 million U.S. dollars of the time (a portion of the silver was confiscated by French authorities).|$|R

The American and Italian sets each offered sixteen perforated stamps, denominated in sixteen values. The Spanish and Portuguese sets, by contrast, included many imperforate images, for only one stamp on each sheet was perforated, and in each of these two sets, all the perforated stamps bore the same denomination—- respectively, 60 <b>Spanish</b> <b>pesetas</b> and 260 Portuguese escudos (no denominations {{appeared on}} the imperforate images).|$|R

It was a relatively inexpensive vehicle (then 60,000 <b>Spanish</b> <b>pesetas)</b> and was the first car that came within the modest but rapidly growing economic means of most Spanish families from the mid-1960s to the early 1970s. The vehicle has become an icon of the period.|$|R

50|$|BTLP was {{a utility}} company which {{provided}} power and streetcar services in Barcelona; originally incorporated in Canada, {{it was mostly}} owned by Belgian investors. BTLP had come through the Spanish Civil War largely undamaged, and was quite profitable. Its assets were about £10,000,000 (about $500 million in 2010). However, {{for the convenience of}} some of its foreign investors, BTLP had issued some bonds denominated in pounds, and the interest on these bonds was payable in pounds. The Spanish government had imposed currency restrictions: BTLP was unable to exchange its <b>Spanish</b> <b>pesetas</b> for pounds, and so could not pay the interest.|$|R
50|$|In Morocco, dirhams {{are divided}} into 100 centimes and one may find prices in the country quoted in centimes rather than in dirhams. Sometimes centimes are known as francs or in former <b>Spanish</b> areas, <b>pesetas.</b>|$|R
50|$|Calviá at {{that time}} lacked {{industrial}} establishments, except for the manufacturing of cement and plaster. The latifundia system was largely an impoverished agrarian autarky. In 1923 the Federació Obrera Calvianera ("Federation of Calvian Workers") was founded {{as a member of}} the socialist Unión General de Trabajadores, followed by the Unió Agrària de Calvià (Calvian Agrarian Union) and La Fraternal. On 30 September 1923, Spain's socialist party, the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party, inaugurated a Casa del pueblo (a cultural and service center), which represented an investment of half a million <b>Spanish</b> <b>pesetas.</b> The labor movement and socialism played an important part in politics during the Second Spanish Republic, but were squashed during the Spanish Civil War.|$|R

From 1940 the banknotes were produced by the Royal Mint (Fábrica Nacional de Moneda y Timbre). In about the same year the inscription [...] "El Banco de España" [...] {{on both sides of}} the banknotes was temporarily changed to [...] "Banco de España", as the definite article [...] "el" [...] was dropped. There is no significant legislation on the copyright of the <b>Spanish</b> <b>peseta</b> banknotes and their reproductions are permitted, except for advertising.|$|E
50|$|Four {{denominations}} {{of coins}} were issued, all dated 1969. These were 1, 5, 25 and 50 pesetas. The coins {{were the same}} size as the corresponding <b>Spanish</b> <b>peseta</b> coins.|$|E
50|$|The castle {{remained}} {{the property of}} the Spanish state until 1971, when it was sold at auction for 30,000 <b>Spanish</b> <b>pesetas.</b> Its purchaser was Don Antonio Sanz Polo (1913-2008), a descendant of Don Juan de Hombrados Malo and a distinguished educator. His family had kept Don Juan's documents of wardenship for over 400 years, passing them down the generations. However, by this time the castle was completely ruined. Sanz Polo spent the next 30 years and most of his fortune on rebuilding the castle, hiring cranes, architects and historians to assist him. He was recognised for his efforts by the award of the Medal of Merit from the National Association of Friends of Castles.|$|R
5000|$|The Death of Cleopatra (Spanish: La Muerte de Cleopatra), {{also known}} simply as Cleopatra, is an 1881 {{painting}} made by the Filipino painter Juan Luna. The famous painting was a silver medalist or second prize winner during the 1881 National Exposition of Fine Arts in Madrid (Exposicion Nacional de Bellas Artes). The 1881 Madrid painting contest was Luna's first art exposition. [...] Because of the exposure, Luna received a pension scholarship at the Ayuntamiento de Manila. [...] After the painting competition, Luna sold it for 5,000 <b>Spanish</b> <b>pesetas,</b> the highest price for a painting at the time. [...] As Luna's [...] "graduation work", The Death of Cleopatra was acquired by the Spanish government for one thousand duros.|$|R
5000|$|Virtually every European {{currency}} was acquired, {{as well as}} South American and Far Eastern currencies; {{a statement}} from mid-1944 prepared for Winston Churchill cited the cumulative acquisitions to that date as being 600m French francs, 20m Belgian francs, 8m Dutch guilders, 3.5m Norwegian kroner, 3.5m Danish kroner, 6m Reichsmarks, 8m <b>Spanish</b> <b>pesetas,</b> 16m U.S. dollars, and 0.5m Argentine pesos. Excluding the U.S. dollars and Argentine pesos, the balance had cost the British Treasury around £2m. A major problem that both SOE and BSC {{had to contend with}} was the sheer weight and volume of small denomination bank notes; a number of surviving signals in SOE files at National Archives in Kew mention [...] "tons" [...] of bank notes.|$|R
