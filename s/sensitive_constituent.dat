30|$|Merchant-manufacturers in Norwich, a {{major centre}} for textile {{production}} in England, used pattern books and pattern cards containing swatches of worsted and worsted mixed with other yarns to facilitate sales and trade. Studying such well-preserved and dated materials provides valuable {{information that can}} translate into informed decisions {{for the care of}} Norwich textile collections. Using a Norwich pattern book from Winterthur Museum’s Special Collections dated c. 1790 – 1793, we report the first stage of a substantial study that combines spectroscopic and chromatographic techniques with archival research. A combination of X-ray fluorescence (XRF), high performance liquid chromatography-photodiode array (HPLC–PDA) and scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM–EDX) allowed for identification of characteristic mordants like iron and tin salts; and dyes, like quercitron, native to North America. In addition, a combination of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC–MS) allowed for partial identification of the glazed finish in some textiles as a natural gum. Setting the foundations for future conservation and conservation science work, our research contributes to the care of these important and beautiful textiles, by providing scientific evidence for humidity and/or light <b>sensitive</b> <b>constituent</b> materials.|$|E

40|$|In {{the coming}} years {{the world will be}} {{undergoing}} a major structural transformation as the size, composition, and geographic distribution of industry changes under the influence of: [...] increases in factor prices: energy, labor; [...] depletion of resources: minerals, cheap liquid fuels; [...] changes in technology: microelectronics, biotechnology; [...] industrialization of the LDCs. The already-industrialized nations, whose industrial structure was shaped by relatively inexpensive energy and easy access to resources, will find certain sectors losing competitiveness to newly-industrialized nations with access to similar technologies and cheaper labor. The newly-industrializing nations will strive to increase their portion of the global industrial pie, while the industrialized nations will compete with each other to preserve their shares. At the same time, population increase and economic development will place new demands both for employment and for goods on the industrial system. At the national level, this transformation will affect economic growth, employment, regional development, balance of payments, R & D, and many other <b>sensitive</b> <b>constituents</b> of national well-being. For the small economies that have a relatively large foreign trade sector, the transformation can be traumatic. Even the large, autarkic economies will face substantial challenges. IIASA is now beginning an exploration of the role that it might play in analyzing and improving understanding of the global and national issues arising from this transformation of the international industrial structure. One part of the exploration has been the commissioning of a series of papers by outside specialists. A central question for all nations {{in the face of the}} industrial transformation is: what strategy should be followed to maximize the prospects of national well-being, given the anticipated changes? The first paper in the series addresses this question for a nation with a small, open economy: Finland. Its author, Professor Jaakko Honko, is Rector of the Helsinki School of Economics, and a member of the Advisory Committee to the Institute's Management and Technology Area. The paper is an English summary of his book recently published in Finland...|$|R
40|$|As {{part of the}} {{extracellular}} matrix (ECM), perineuronal nets (PNs) are polyanionic, chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (CSPG) -rich coatings of certain neurons, known to be affected in various neural diseases. Although these structures are considered as important parts of the neurovascular unit (NVU), their role during evolution of acute ischemic stroke and subsequent tissue damage is poorly understood {{and only a few}} preclinical studies analyzed PNs after acute ischemic stroke. By employing three models of experimental focal cerebral ischemia, this study was focused on histopathological alterations of PNs and concomitant vascular, glial and neuronal changes according to the NVU concept. We analyzed brain tissues obtained 1 day after ischemia onset from: (a) mice after filament-based permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAO); (b) rats subjected to thromboembolic MACO; and (c) sheep at 14 days after electrosurgically induced focal cerebral ischemia. Multiple fluorescence labeling was applied to explore simultaneous alterations of NVU and ECM. Serial mouse sections labeled with the net marker Wisteria floribunda agglutinin (WFA) displayed largely decomposed and nearly erased PNs in infarcted neocortical areas that were demarcated by up-regulated immunoreactivity for vascular collagen IV (Coll IV). Subsequent semi-quantitative analyses in mice confirmed significantly decreased WFA-staining along the ischemic border zone and a relative decrease in the directly ischemia-affected neocortex. Triple fluorescence labeling throughout the three animal models revealed up-regulated Coll IV and decomposed PNs accompanied by activated astroglia and altered immunoreactivity for parvalbumin, a calcium-binding protein in fast-firing GABAergic neurons which are predominantly surrounded by neocortical PNs. Furthermore, ischemic neocortical areas in rodents simultaneously displayed less intense staining of WFA, aggrecan, the net components neurocan, versican and the cartilage link protein (CRTL) as well as markers in net-bearing neurons such as the potassium channel subunit Kv 3. 1 b and neuronal nuclei (NeuN). In summary, theconsistent observations based on three different stroke models confirmed that PNs are highly <b>sensitive</b> <b>constituents</b> of the NVU along with impaired associated GABAergic neurons. These results suggest that PNs could be promising targets of future stroke treatment, and further studies should address their reorganization and plasticity in both stabilizing the acute stroke as well as supportive effects during the chronic phase of stroke...|$|R
40|$|Adhesion, {{friction}} and wear behavior of glasses and ionic solids are reviewed. These materials are shown {{to behave in}} a manner similar to other solids with respect to adhesion. Their friction characteristics are shown to be <b>sensitive</b> to environmental <b>constituents</b> and surface films. This sensitivity can be related to a reduction in adhesive bonding and the changes in surficial mechanical behavior associated with Rehbinder and Joffe effects. Both {{friction and}} wear properties of ionic crystalline solids are highly anisotropic. With metals in contact with ionic solids, the fracture strength of the ionic solid, the shear strength in the metal, and those properties that determine these will dictate which of the materials undergoes adhesive wear...|$|R
40|$|Both copper K X-rays and {{the soft}} general {{radiation}} from a tungsten tube operated at 12 KV kill B. coli and B. aertryke in a linearly exponential fashion. Within the experimental limits, the two organisms appear to be equally sensitive to these radiations. By making use {{of the fact that}} X-ray energy is absorbed in quanta, an approximate picture can be formed of the mechanism of this destructive action. If the average numbers of quanta (α) absorbed per bacterium per second are calculated from measurements of air ionization using the quantities outlined in the text, survival ratios for these bacilli can be approximately represented by the equations See PDF for Equation for filtered copper rays and See PDF for Equation for unfiltered copper rays (peak voltage = 34 KV). In terms of the foregoing interpretation this means that when death results, it is caused by the absorption of a single X-ray quantum of energy. Since only about one in twenty of the absorbed quanta kills, the <b>sensitive</b> cell <b>constituents</b> whose destruction leads to cell death must have a volume which is less than 0. 06 of the bacterium itself...|$|R
40|$|The {{sensitivity}} of the differential {{cross section of the}} interaction between neutrino-electron with dense matter to the possibly nonzero neutrino electromagnetic properties has been investigated. Here, the relativistic mean field model inspired by effective field theory has been used to describe non strange dense matter, both with and without the neutrino trapping. We have found that the cross section becomes more <b>sensitive</b> to the <b>constituent</b> distribution of the matter, once electromagnetic properties of the neutrino are taken into account. The effects of electromagnetic properties of neutrino on the cross section become more significant for the neutrino magnetic moment mu_nu > 10 ^{- 10 } mu_B and for the neutrino charge radius R > 10 ^{- 5 } MeV^{- 1 }.

40|$|Superconductivity (SC) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{intriguing}} physical phenomena in nature. Nucleation of SC has long been considered highly unfavorable if not impossible near ferromagnetism, in low dimensionality and, above all, out of non-superconductor. Here we report observation of SC with TC near 4 K in Ni/Bi bilayers that defies all known paradigms of superconductivity, where neither ferromagnetic Ni film nor rhombohedra Bi film is superconducting in isolation. This highly unusual SC is independent of the growth order (Ni/Bi or Bi/Ni), but highly <b>sensitive</b> to the <b>constituent</b> layer thicknesses. Most importantly, the SC, distinctively non-s pairing, is triggered from, but does not occur at, the Bi/Ni interface. Using point contact Andreev reflection, we show evidences that the unique SC, naturally compatible with magnetism, is triplet p-wave pairing. This new revelation may lead to unconventional avenues to explore novel SC for applications in superconducting spintronics. Comment: 16 pages, 4 figure...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} {{calculation}} of the β-term for D^* [...] > D gamma within a heavy-light chiral quark model. Within the model, soft gluon effects {{in terms of the}} gluon condensate with lowest dimension are included. Also, calculations of 1 /m_c corrections are performed. We find that the value of β is rather <b>sensitive</b> to the <b>constituent</b> quark mass compared to other quantities calculated within the same model. Also, to obtain a value close to the experimental value, one has to choose a constituent light quark mass larger than for other quantities studied in previous papers. For a light quark mass in the range 250 to 300 MeV and a quark condensate in the range -(250 - 270 MeV) ^ 3 we find the value (2. 5 +- 0. 6) GeV^- 1. This value is in agreement with the value of β extracted from experiment 2. 7 +- 0. 2 GeV^- 1. Comment: 16 pages, 5 figure...|$|R
40|$|Well-being is a {{multifaceted}} concept, having intellectual origins in philosophy, psychology, economics, political science, and other disciplines. Its presence is correlated {{with a variety}} of institutional and business critical indicators. To date, methods to assess well-being are performed infrequently and superficially; resulting in highly aggregated observations. In this paper, we present well-being as a predictive entity for the management of a smart community. Our vision is a low latency method for the observation and measurement of well-being within a community or institution that enables different resolutions of data, e. g. at the level of an individual, a social or demographic group, or an institution. Using well-being in this manner enables realistic, faster and less expensive data collection in a smart system. However, as the data needed for assessing well-being is highly <b>sensitive</b> personal information, <b>constituents</b> require incentives and familiar settings to reveal this information, which we establish with Facebook and gamification. To evaluate the predictive value of well-being, we conducted a series of surveys to observe different self-reported psychological aspects of participants. Our key findings were that neuroticism and extroversion seem to have the highest predictive value of self-reported well-being levels. This information can be used to create expected trends of well-being for smart community management...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{development}} of galaxy surveys {{enables us to}} investigate the deep universe of high redshift. We quantitatively present the physical information extractable from the observable correlation function in deep redshift space in a framework of the linear theory. The correlation function depends on the underlying power spectrum, velocity distortions, and the Alcock-Paczyński (AP) effect. The underlying power spectrum is <b>sensitive</b> to the <b>constituents</b> of matters in the universe, the velocity distortions {{are sensitive to the}} galaxy bias as well as the amount of total matter, and the Alcock-Paczyński effect is sensitive to the dark energy components. Measuring the dark energy by means of the baryonic feature in the correlation function {{is one of the most}} interesting applications. We show that the "baryon ridge" in the correlation function serves as a statistically circular object in the AP effect. In order to sufficiently constrain the dark energy components, the redshift range of the galaxy survey should be as broad as possible. The survey area on the sky should be smaller at deep redshifts than at shallow redshifts to keep the number density as dense as possible. We illustrate an optimal survey design that are useful in cosmology. Assuming future redshift surveys of z 3 which are within reach of the present-day technology, achievable error bounds on cosmological parameters are estimated by calculating the Fisher matrix. According to an illustrated design, the equation of state of dark energy can be constrained within ± 5...|$|R
40|$|Advantages of Cu based {{shape memory}} alloy include amongst other features, high {{transformation}} temperature, low cost of production, ease in manufacturing processes and ability to vary the achieved properties through alloying additions. It has been often reported that these alloys {{are very sensitive to}} the alloying additions in terms of properties achieved and phase precipitation necessary for development of shape memory properties. This behaviour in Cu based {{shape memory alloy}}s i. e. being very <b>sensitive</b> to its <b>constituents</b> can be used positively to design alloys with pre set properties if the alloying additions and their percentages are properly controlled. In an attempt to understand the effect of different alloying additions, 2 % of different elements [Zn, Si, Mg & Cr] were added to a known Cu-based shape memory alloy [Cu- 12. 5 wt% of Al- 5 wt % of Mn]. The objective was to ascertain changes or improvements achieved due to the additions in terms of microstructural changes, hardness, phase precipitation and transformation temperatures. Attempts have been made to analyze the changes in properties achieved in the base Cu-Al-Mn alloys due to the quaternary additions. Grain structure with &# 945;+&# 946; phases, which is a pre requisite for martensite formation on quenching is seen in all the alloys indicating that all the alloys have potential to exhibit the shape memory behaviour. The martensite formation with different morphologies is observed in the quenched samples however. XRD results have identified the precipitated phases to be the martensitic phases. The DSC results indicate clear transformation peaks in most of the samples with significantly high transformation temperatures. The findings confirm the variation in properties achieved due to different additions and improvements achieved in terms of higher transformation temperatures and martensite formation due to the alloying additions. An attempt has been made to understand the findings...|$|R
