5000|$|Using beta as {{a measure}} of {{relative}} risk has its own limitations. Most analyses consider only the magnitude of beta. Beta is a statistical variable and should be considered with its statistical significance (R <b>square</b> <b>value</b> of the regression line).

40|$|Based on the {{principles}} derived from Campbell’s theorem, this paper carries out {{an analysis of the}} possibilities of Campbell’s mean <b>square</b> <b>value</b> signal processing system. The mean <b>square</b> <b>value</b> mode is especially suitable for measurements performed in a mixed radiation field, because the quantities of electrical charge involved in the interactions of the two types of radiation are substantially different. The measuring detector element may be an adequate ionization chamber and/or semiconductor components for mixed n-γ fields. An examination of the discrimination of gamma in relation to the neutron component in the signal of the detector output was carried out, calculated according to the theoretical model of radiation interaction with the detector. The advantage of the mean <b>square</b> <b>value</b> method was confirmed and it was concluded that the order of n-γ discrimination in mean <b>square</b> <b>value</b> signal processing is greater than the one rendered by the classical measuring method...|$|R

(Spread also corresponds to a scaled form of the inner product between line segments taken as vectors). The three main laws in trigonometry: Pythagoras's theorem, the sine law and the cosine law, given in rational (square-equivalent) form, are augmented by two further laws: the triple quad formula (relating the quadrances of three collinear points) and the triple spread formula (relating the spreads of three concurrent lines), giving the five main laws of the subject.|$|E

More generally, when samples are represented using linear PCM with B bits per sample, MAXI is 2B−1. For color images with three RGB values per pixel, the definition of PSNR is the same except the MSE is the sum over all <b>squared</b> <b>value</b> differences divided by image size and by three. Alternately, for color images the image is converted to a different color space and PSNR is reported against each channel of that color space, e.g., YCbCr or HSL.|$|E
50|$|To fully {{specify a}} belt, the material, length, and {{cross-section}} {{size and shape}} are required. Timing belts, in addition, require {{that the size of}} the teeth be given.The length of the belt is the sum of the central length of the system on both sides, half the circumference of both pulleys, and the square of the sum (if crossed) or the difference (if open) of the radii. Thus, when dividing by the central distance, it can be visualized as the central distance times the height that gives the same <b>squared</b> <b>value</b> of the radius difference on, of course, both sides. When adding to the length of either side, the length of the belt increases, in a similar manner to the Pythagorean theorem. One important concept to remember is that as D1 gets closer to D2 there is less of a distance (and therefore less addition of length) until its approaches zero.|$|E
5000|$|The above {{definition}} of {{energy spectral density}} is suitable for transients (pulse-like signals) whose energy is concentrated around one time window; then the Fourier transforms of the signals generally exist. For continuous signals over all time, such as stationary processes, one must rather define the power spectral density (PSD); this describes how power of a signal or time series is distributed over frequency, as in the simple example given previously. Here, power can be the actual physical power, or more often, for convenience with abstract signals, is simply identified with the <b>squared</b> <b>value</b> of the signal. For example, statisticians study the variance of a function over time [...] (or over another independent variable), and using an analogy with electrical signals (among other physical processes), it is customary to {{refer to it as}} the power spectrum even when there is no physical power involved. If one were to create a physical voltage source which followed [...] and applied it to the terminals of a 1 ohm resistor, then indeed the instantaneous power dissipated in that resistor would be given by x2 watts.|$|E

In general, a full joint minimization of this mean squared error w.r.t. all K unknowns ak must be executed.

For multiple regression analysis, an R <b>squared</b> <b>value</b> of 0.8 or above can be considered a large effect (Cohen, 1992). The results show that high scores on the organization rating scale are significantly predicted by scores on the content scale (p = 0.000), the number of paragraphs an essay has (p = 0.000) and the number of cohesive devices used (p = 0.015). On the other hand, the negative results for the length and coherence variables show that longer essays and ideationally more coherent essays tended to predict lower scores on the organization rating scale, although these relationships are not statistically significant.|$|E
