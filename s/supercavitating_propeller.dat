50|$|The <b>supercavitating</b> <b>{{propeller}}</b> is {{a variant}} of a propeller for propulsion in water, where supercavitation is actively employed to gain increased speed by reducing friction. They are being used for military purposes and for high performance racing boats, as well as model racing boats. The <b>supercavitating</b> <b>propeller</b> operates submerged with the entire diameter of the blade below the water line. Its blades are wedge-shaped to force cavitation on the whole forward face, starting at the leading edge, {{in order to reduce}} water skin friction. As the cavity collapses well behind the blade, the <b>supercavitating</b> <b>propeller</b> avoids the spalling damage due to cavitation that is a problem with conventional propellers.|$|E

40|$|The various {{theories}} concerning propeller design are discussed. The use {{of digital}} computers to obtain specific blade shapes to meet appropriate flow conditions is emphasized. The development of lifting-line and lifting surface configurations is analyzed. Ship propulsive performance and basic propeller design considerations are investigated.

5000|$|The ship's {{helmsman}} had to {{be qualified}} as both a sea pilot and an aircraft pilot. Bras d'Or had two propulsion systems: one for foilborne operation and one for hullborne operation, which included four engines. Foilborne power was provided by a FT4A-2 gas turbine developing [...] at 21,500 rpm through General Electric gearboxes {{to a pair of}} three-bladed <b>supercavitating</b> <b>propellers.</b> Hullborne propulsion was driven by a Paxman Ventura 16YJCM sixteen-cylinder diesel engine to a pair of variable-pitch propellers. Auxiliary power and electrical power while foilborne was provided by an ST6A-53 gas turbine powering an auxiliary gearbox. Both of the P&W turbines were built by United Aircraft of Canada. There was also a Garrett GTCP85-291 gas turbine for essential ship electrical requirements in emergencies.|$|R
5000|$|This article distinguishes a <b>supercavitating</b> <b>propeller</b> from a {{subcavitating}} propeller running under supercavitating conditions. In general, subcavitating propellers {{become less}} efficient {{when they are}} running under supercavitating conditions.|$|E

They are being used for military purposes and for high performance racing boats as well as model racing boats.|$|E
50|$|An {{alternative}} to the <b>supercavitating</b> <b>propeller</b> is the surface piercing, or ventilated propeller. These propellers are designed to intentionally cleave the water and entrain atmospheric air to fill the void, {{which means that the}} resulting gas layer on the forward face of the propeller blade consists of air instead of water vapour. Less energy is thus used, and the surface-piercing propeller generally enjoys lower drag than the supercavitating principle. The surface-piercing propeller also has wedge-shaped blades, and propellers may be designed that can operate in both supercavitating and surface-piercing mode.|$|E
50|$|Two {{experimental}} SESs (the SES-100A and 100B), both {{of around}} 100 tons, with 80 ft (24 m) length and 40 ft (12 m) beams, were {{developed for the}} US Military in the 1960s and 70s. They both attained speeds {{in excess of the}} program goal of 80 knots (150 km/h). The SES 100B, was built by Bell Aerospace (Textron Corporation) at the NASA Michoud Assembly Facility. Driven by 2 semi-submerged, <b>supercavitating</b> controllable, reversible <b>propellers,</b> achieved speeds in excess of 96 knots (approximately 110 mph) in the Gulf outside St. Andrews Bay in Panama City, Florida.|$|R
40|$|Traditional {{propellers}} operate fully submerged, with cavitation limited as much {{as possible}} in order to minimize its disruptive and damaging consequences. Conversely, <b>supercavitating</b> <b>propellers</b> operate in an encompassing vapor cavity, thereby averting these negative effects while substantially reducing drag on the blades. Surface-piercing propellers, operating under a similar concept as supercavitation, often achieve even greater efficiency by drawing in an air cavity from the free surface. Existing small craft have demonstrated the ability of such propellers to yield extremely high speeds (110 + knots); nevertheless, the full potential of these propellers has yet to be explored. In particular, designs often neglect low-speed performance, focusing solely on high-speed operation. This research therefore developed a new surface-piercing propeller concept designed instead to maximize performance across the spectrum of operating speeds. Applying established theory for supercavitating hydrofoils, the new blades were shaped based on theoretical maximally-efficient two-dimensional profile sections. Furthermore, in order to affect the low-speed performance enhancement, the trailing edge of each profile was appended with a unique "tail" form that allows the blade to resemble a traditional propeller when operating at subcavitating speeds without sacrificing supercavitating performance. The design used an existing racing propeller as a baseline for comparison, matching certain characteristics (rotational speed, advance speed, number of blades, hub size) in order to ensure equivalent operating conditions. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) of the 2 D profiles informed changes to the profile shapes until lift-to-drag (L/D) was maximized while ensuring a fully-encompassing vapor cavity. The complete propeller was drafted from these optimized radial sections for full 3 D CFD analysis. Results from both the 2 D and 3 D CFD simulations revealed promising benefits to propulsive efficiency. High-speed performance met or exceeded that of the baseline propeller, and low-speed performance showed significant improvement. This surface-piercing propeller concept offers an unconventional design with convincing results for balanced low- and high-speed operation. by Justin Richard Parker. Thesis: Nav.

40|$|The user of a turbo {{machine is}} mainly {{interested}} only in the overall hydrodynamic performance of the device. However, the designer is almost always confronted {{with the problem of}} achieving the intended performance in the face of many conflicting hydrodynamic and system requirements. In certain areas it may happen that a formerly deleterious effect (such as the occurrence of cavitation) can be turned to good advantage {{as in the case of}} the <b>supercavitating</b> hydrofoil or <b>propeller.</b> Unfortunately, this happy circumstance is not the lot of the designer of a liquid pumping system when the effects of cavitation are predominant. That this is so, follows from the fact that the dissipation effects in production of lift by a hydrofoil are relatively unimportant whereas dissipation is important in the decrease of energy of a fluid stream as in the case of a pump...|$|R
50|$|Cavitation {{can be used}} as an {{advantage}} in design of very high performance propellers, in form of the <b>supercavitating</b> <b>propeller.</b> In this case, the blade section is designed such that the pressure side stays wetted while the suction side is completely covered by cavitation vapor. Because the suction side is covered with vapor instead of water it encounters very low viscous friction, making the supercavitating (SC) propeller comparably efficient at high speed. The shaping of SC blade sections however, make it inefficient at low speeds, when the suction side of the blade is wetted. (See also fluid dynamics).|$|E
