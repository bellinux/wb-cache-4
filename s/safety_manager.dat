2500|$|The initial {{planning}} {{application was}} placed on hold in 2005, and Richard Butler, Principal Planning Officer for Rochdale Borough Council said in October 2008: [...] "The application {{has not yet been}} determined and is suspended whilst the applicants and their consultants, together with our own contamination experts, assess a number of issues, the most important being the asbestos risk and the remediation required as part of the redevelopment." [...] In December 2009, despite no decontamination work having been carried out, the council earmarked the site for 568 houses, based on a housing density of 30 dwellings per hectare, in a draft allocation of future brownfield land targets. In January 2010, however, the council deleted references to the redevelopment of the site. Simon Danzcuk, the Rochdale Labour Party parliamentary candidate, has warned that the council believe a housing development on the site is an inevitability and that they are [...] "sleepwalking into a catastrophic mistake." [...] MMC have stated that [...] "there is no viable alternative to development led remediation of the site." [...] A National Health and Safety Commissioner who was formerly a Health and <b>Safety</b> <b>Manager</b> at the factory has said that the felling of trees and disturbing of soil on the site is [...] "sheer madness... With the potential amount of asbestos on that site, no development should be built on this land." [...] Hilda Palmer of the Greater Manchester Hazards Centre has said: [...] "Asbestos is a carcinogen and it causes lung diseases. When asbestos gets into the air and can be inhaled by people it can cause those diseases 10, 20, 50 years down the line. So if there is any development on that site there is a potential for serious lung diseases, cancers and death from that development." [...] Spokesman Jason Addy of Save Spodden Valley, stated: [...] "The key issue is contamination. Asbestos from this site has killed far too many people already." ...|$|E

40|$|The {{likelihood}} of the voluntary adoption of hazard analysis and critical control point (HACCP) among food processing firms is evaluated by exploring {{the perceptions of}} food <b>safety</b> <b>managers</b> {{with respect to a}} range of possible motivating factors including the exogenous pressure to adopt HACCP, efficacy of existing food safety controls, perception that HACCP will improve the firm's food safety controls, relative costs and benefits of HACCP implementation, impact of HACCP on business performance, and the nature of barriers to implementing HACCP. While market-based factors exert substantial pressure on firms to adopt HACCP, many food <b>safety</b> <b>managers</b> perceive that their existing food safety controls are adequate to meet existing food safety demands. While good manufacturing practice (GMP) and traceability are considered the most efficacious food safety controls, HACCP is most often perceived to provide intangible and "incidental" benefits that are often not recognized by food <b>safety</b> <b>managers</b> a priori. An important barrier to the voluntary adoption of HACCP is the perceived questionable appropriateness of HACCP for enhancing food safety controls, while financial constraints can be an absolute barrier to implementation. The results suggest a number of potential strategies through which the implementation of HACCP might be facilitated and enhanced through cooperation and coordination between regulators and industry organizations.

40|$|Work related stress (WRS) is a {{contributor}} to absence from work by workers in the construction industry. Whilst there has been research into WRS in the construction sector, there has been limited empirical research focussing on WRS amongst construction health and <b>safety</b> <b>managers.</b> This study therefore investigates the causes and impacts of work related stress amongst construction health and <b>safety</b> <b>managers</b> (CHSMs). A qualitative research strategy was used involving 8 semi-structured interviews with construction health and <b>safety</b> <b>managers</b> in the UK. Analysis of the data revealed the main causes of work related stress amongst CHSMs to include: travelling/commuting; long working hours; public speaking/presentations; the occurrence of an accident (e. g. fatality); too much paperwork; and work overload. Additionally, the main impacts of WRS include: impact on work performance; drinking alcohol; smoking; sleeplessness; impact on decision making; and impact on family. Whilst the findings, reflect issues of WRS similar to those reported in previous WRS studies in the construction industry, aspects also seem more prominent or pertinent {{to the role of}} the CHSM, particularly long commuting period as CHSMs often tend not to be based at a single site. Overall, the findings offer insights that could be useful to construction health and safety professionals as well as their employers, occupational safety and health professional bodies, and relevant industry stakeholders in providing appropriate WRS support for CHSMs and other professionals in the industry...|$|R

Participating drivers drove an instrumented vehicle for 17 consecutive weeks while they made their normal, revenue-producing deliveries.

40|$|This {{study was}} carried out to assess hygiene conditions, food {{handling}} practices, food safety knowledge of food service providers (FSPs), and the microbial quality of food served in different food service establishments in Doha. Fifty-three FSPs were randomly selected among 200 FSPs. Face-to-face interviews with the food <b>safety</b> <b>managers</b> at each participating FSP were conducted using a survey consisting of 40 -questions (demographic data on workers, HACCP training, knowledge on personal hygiene, and safe-food handling practices) in October-December 2015. In addition to survey questionnaire, a checklist {{was used to determine}} the implementation of international food safety standards by observing actual practices applied at each FSP. The microbial quality of food samples (n= 105) served and swabs collected from food preparation surfaces (n= 58) were also assessed using select media (APC, MCA, XLT 4, and LSA). The identification of positive samples {{was carried out}} using VITEK- 2 system. The survey results indicated that average service years of FSPs was 11, the average age of food <b>safety</b> <b>managers</b> interviewed was 33, most managers (66 %) had college degree, and 68 % of them were trained on HACCP. It was demonstrated that casual-sit-in and fine-dine-in restaurants are the only FSP types which consistently kept records (100 %), followed by fast-food (36 %), and catering (14 %) FSPs. The microbial analysis indicated that the average APC in food samples collected from all FSPs met the international standards, while the APC counts of swab samples were considered unsatisfactory since the levels were above 106 Log 10 CFU/cm 2. The highest bacterial count was reported in swab samples (7. 26 Log 10 CFU/cm 2) collected from preparation area in takeaway restaurants. Concerning the target organisms (Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp., and Listeria monocytogenes), among 105 food samples and 58 swab samples collected, 13 samples (8 %) exhibited positive results for possible target pathogens. Positive samples were identified as Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Pantoea spp. Results obtained in this study might help food <b>safety</b> <b>managers</b> in these select FSPs to better understand the need for implementing effective control measures in order to prevent contamination and eventually protect the public health...|$|R
