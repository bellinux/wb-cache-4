40|$|Aluminium {{hydroxide}} is used {{to prevent}} hyperphosphataemia in patients undergoing dialysis, but many standard preparations are unpalatable. In this study hydrated aluminium sucrose was suspended in <b>synthetic</b> <b>cream</b> and used as a biscuit filling. Six patients undergoing dialysis took part in five five-week study periods comparing different forms of treatment. No {{significant difference was found}} between serum phosphate concentrations measured during standard treatment and those measured during treatment with aluminium sucrose biscuits. There {{was no significant difference in}} serum phosphate concentrations when the patients were given placebo biscuits and when they received no treatment. Aluminium sucrose presented in this form was an adequate phosphate binder and was acceptable to the patients...|$|E
30|$|Bakery {{products}} usually contain {{basic elements}} of milk, butter, starch, eggs and sugar that provide the nutrient sources for the good growth of microbial contaminants (Pyler 1988). However, these food products are {{generally considered to be}} microbiologically safe due to the high temperature of up to 170  °C used in the baking process. Usually, baked products do not pose a health risk unless they have cream or custard filling containing egg or a dairy product (Stewart et al. 2003). This filling is the most likely source of a serious food safety hazard due to post-baking microbial contamination. Another risk may arise from climatic conditions facilitating microbial growth, especially in a tropical country like Thailand. Several antimicrobial substances, such as acetic acid, propionic acid, sorbic acid and their salts have been used as food preservatives to extend a product’s shelf life (Smith et al. 2004). However, their inhibition efficiencies at the neutral pH of bakery products with creamy filling have been reported as low which corresponded to previous studies proposed that chemical preservatives are only effective in bakery products at pH <  6.5 (Guynot et al. 2005; Rosenquist and Hansen 1998). Schmidt et al. (1969) reported that both potassium sorbate and sodium benzoate at a concentration of 1000  ppm could inhibit the growth of Staphylococcus aureus in <b>synthetic</b> <b>cream</b> pies at 22 and 37  °C and at pH 4.5 – 5.0 but not at a higher pH of 5.2. In addition, it was found that calcium propionate shows no inhibition against rope-producing spores containing B. subtilis, B. licheniformis and B. pumilus in white bread (Thompson et al. 1998).|$|E
40|$|Vernix caseosa (VC) is the cheesy, white cream {{that covers}} {{the skin of the}} human fetus and the newborn. VC is a {{protective}} cream, which consists of water containing dead cells that are embedded in lipids. This natural cream is suggested to feature multiple biological functions such as facilitating the skin formation during pregnancy and hydrating the skin of the newborn. The aim of this thesis was the rational design of <b>synthetic</b> <b>creams</b> which mimic VC’s structure and its unique properties. <b>Synthetic</b> <b>creams</b> were made of highly hydrated synthetic particles embedded in wool wax and skin lipids. These creams were shown to mimic excellently the structure and composition of natural VC, while the water content and release properties could be controlled. The developed creams showed their great potential for disrupted and underdeveloped skin concerning several aspects: the skin barrier recovery rate was drastically reduced, crust formation was prevented and thickening of the epidermis was less frequently observed. These promising results give rise to future clinical studies in order to prove the benefits of the newly developed creams to treat healthy, dry and diseased human skin.

50|$|A lactose-free food, such as non-dairy ice cream, {{may require}} a {{different}} process during manufacturing. For example, traditional dairy ice cream is made {{with a combination of}} milk products that contain lactose, but non-dairy ice cream may be synthesized using hydrogenated or partially hydrogenated vegetable oil (coconut oil, palm kernel oil and soybean oil) along with emulsifier, protein, sweetener and water. Some not yet widely prevalent <b>synthetic</b> ice <b>cream</b> products are claimed to have a similar flavour and texture to traditional dairy ice cream.|$|R

40|$|Objective: to {{evaluate}} the effectiveness and safety of combined use of <b>creams</b> Prednicarbum and <b>synthetic</b> tannin (phenol-methanal-of urea-polycondensate) in the treatment of exacerbation of atopic dermatitis in children. Material and methods: 50 children, 1 to 12 years, with atopic dermatitis with the exacerbation of the skin process different degrees of severity. Results: In children with mild localized form of atopic dermatitis after the monotherapy whith <b>cream</b> <b>synthetic</b> tannin, noted a marked clinical improvement up to 7 days of treatment. The noted expressive positive dynamics of the skin process and reduction of objective symptoms during the first days after of combination treatment with Prednicarbatet <b>cream</b> and <b>synthetic</b> tannin, also after combination therapy Prednicarbate and moisturizing cream in mode of step therapy. Conclusions: The combined application of Prednicarbate cream and phenol-methanal-of urea-polycondensate increases the effectiveness of anti-inflammatory treatment of atopic dermatitis, which can reduce the duration of use of topical corticosteroids and reduce the risk of adverse reactions in children with moderate and severe course skin process. ...|$|R
40|$|A {{simple and}} {{sensitive}} kinetic spectrophotometric method {{was developed for}} the determination of ciclopirox olamine in pharmaceutical formulations (cream). The method {{is based on the}} oxidation of ciclopirox olamine with KMnO 4 in alkaline medium to form K 2 MnO 4, a bluish green color compound, at ionic strength controlled and room temperature. The reaction is monitored measuring the rate of change of absorbance at 610 nm. The absorbance-concentration plot corresponding to <b>synthetic</b> pharmaceutical samples (<b>cream)</b> was rectilinear, over the range of 0. 32 - 10. 0 mu g mL(- 1), with detection and quantification limits of 0. 095 mu g mL(- 1) and 0. 32 mu g mL(- 1), respectively. Different experimental parameters affecting the development and stability of the reaction product were carefully studied via factorial screening and optimized by univariate method. The determination of ciclopirox olamine by the fixed time method is feasible and more advantageous with the calibration equation obtained at 30 min.

40|$|Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory {{drugs have}} their origin as the {{derivatives}} of plants which were observed to have strong analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects in various disease states. Ibuprofen {{is a better}} tolerated NSAID because its topical formulation has limited numbers of adverse effects. The present research was conducted with the aim to develop and evaluate a novel Ibuprofen cream formulation, which would attenuate the gastrointestinal related toxicities associated with oral administration. Olive oil was used as penetration enhancer and was added in formulation to see its enhancement effect on in-vitro dug release profile. In the present study, a fixed concentration of Ibuprofen cream (2 %) was prepared alone and by using olive oil as penetration enhancer. The prepared cream formulations were evaluated for several physiochemical parameters to justify its suitability for topical use. The invitro drug release {{was carried out by}} using Franz cell diffusion apparatus across the <b>synthetic</b> membrane. The <b>cream</b> formulations were evaluated for anti-inflammatory and skin irritation study. The results obtained were encouraging; Ibuprofen (2 %) cream with olive oil was successfully prepared and exhibited the most satisfying results of all the parameters including a better result of in-vitro drug release as compared to Ibuprofen cream formulation without a penetration enhancer.
