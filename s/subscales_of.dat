40|$|Overt {{academic}} behaviors, such as {{problem solving}} strategies, attention skills, and motivation, are key, instructional targets considered to contribute both to {{present and future}} progress (Barnett, 1996; McKinney, 1975). The assessment of student behaviors {{through the use of}} behavior rating scales is prevalent in the field of education. With the link between learning behaviors and achievement and the widespread use of behavior ratings scales, the need for valid, standardized rating scales that focus on observable and potentially alterable learning behaviors is evident. One such measure is the Learning Behaviors Scale (LBS; McDermott, Green, Francis, 2 ̆ 6 Stott, 1999). In light of the LBS, the present study explored the constructs of attention, problem solving, and motivation with the following tasks used as standards for comparison: the Attention/Persistence <b>subscale</b> <b>of</b> the LBS with the Trail Making Test (TMT; Reitan 2 ̆ 6 Wolfson, 1985); the Attention/Persistence <b>subscale</b> <b>of</b> the LBS with the Digit Span subtest of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Third Edition (WISC-III; Wechsler, 1991); the Strategy/Flexibility <b>subscale</b> <b>of</b> the LBS with the Mazes of the WISC-III (Wechsler, 1991); the Strategy/Flexibility <b>subscale</b> <b>of</b> the LBS with the Matrices subtest of the Differential Abilities Scale (Elliott, 1990); the Motivation <b>subscale</b> <b>of</b> the LBS with the General <b>subscale</b> <b>of</b> the Children 2 ̆ 7 s Academic Intrinsic Motivation Inventory (Gottfried, 1985). Teachers rated student learning behaviors with the 29 -item LBS. Teacher-assigned grades and standardized achievement scores served as achievement criterions. The participant sample (N = 141) consisted of students from two schools in southeastern Pennsylvania. Although the results failed to support the proposed hypotheses, a number of factors influenced the study: a contextual impact on the execution of the TMT, the construct validity of intelligence scale subtests, and variance due to the different sources of information gathered in this study. ...|$|R

40|$|Perfectionism is a {{construct}} only recently operationalized in the literature, with need identified in discovering {{its relationship to}} attachment style and patterns of adjustment in college. The first hypothesis was that a positive correlation would be evidenced between insecure attachment style and maladaptive perfectionism.

Participants were 64 first-year undergraduate students from Pacific University and Reed College. Self-report measures used to measure the variables were the Multidimensional Perfectionism Scale (MPS), Experiences in Close Relationship Scale (ECR), and Student Adaptation to College Questionnaire (SACQ).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Research is an {{important}} motivating factor for pursuing a career in academic medicine, but the relation between motivation and other factors involved in scientific research are not clear. PURPOSE: To explore the motivational orientation for doing research and its relation with attitudes towards science and publication practice among members of faculty at a medical school. METHODS: We used a Science Attitude Survey and the Work Preference Inventory (intrinsic and extrinsic motivational orientation using 4 Likert-type scales of motivation, possible range 1 - 5) to survey two groups of teachers at the Zagreb University School of Medicine (n = 327, 66 % response rate) : professors, elected to tenure-track positions (n = 150), and instructor/research fellows working on or just completing their thesis (n = 177). RESULTS: Overall, teachers scored highest on the Enjoyment <b>subscale</b> <b>of</b> intrinsic motivational orientation (mean score +/- standard deviation 4. 3 +/- 0. 42 for professors vs 4. 1 +/- 0. 42 for instructors/research fellows, P = 0. 001, t-test). Professors also scored higher than instructors/research fellows on the Challenge <b>subscale</b> <b>of</b> intrinsic motivational orientation (3. 8 +/- 0. 55 vs. 3. 5 +/- 0. 64, P < 0. 001, t-test), whereas instructors/research fellows scored higher on the Compensation <b>subscale</b> <b>of</b> extrinsic motivational orientation (3. 5 +/- 0. 74 vs. 3. 1 +/- 0. 71, P < 0. 001, t-test).

50|$|In 2009 a {{study was}} {{conducted}} by Lotta Fernros of the Karolinska Institute into the methods used by Mullingstorp. The study measured the Health Related Quality of Life (HRQOL) in the participants {{at the beginning of}} the course. On arrival, before the course, the participants completed three questionnaires. The first was SWEDQUAL, with 61 items for self-rating of HRQOL classified in 13 areas, e.g. cognition, physical functions, sleep, pain, relations and emotions. The second was Antonovsky's Sense of Coherence with 13 items divided into three areas: comprehensibility, meaningfulness and manageability. The third was about work, education, experience of alternative medicine, sick listing and medication. Comparisons were made with population data from Statistics Sweden, the National Insurance Office and the National Board of Health and Welfare. Six of the thirteen <b>subscales</b> <b>of</b> HRQOL showed very low starting values, which is unusual in a group with such a high level of education. Eight of the <b>subscales</b> <b>of</b> HRQOL showed clinically significant improvements in the study group (>9%, p<0.01), namely: general health (9%), emotional well-being (negative 45% and positive 26%), cognitive functioning (24%), sleep (15%), pain (10%), role limitations due to emotional health (22%) and family functioning (16%). Physical, partner and sexual functioning were normal in both groups. The study concluded that the Meet Yourself Process can improve cognitive and emotional function, which in turn increases motivation. The process has the potential to be used as a starting point in rehabilitation for working life, for people who are forced for health reasons to cope with a readjustment crisis and establish a foundation for a new orientation.|$|E
