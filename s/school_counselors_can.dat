25|$|In 2011, Counseling at the Crossroads: The {{perspectives}} and promise {{of school counselors}} in American education, the largest survey {{of high school and}} middle school counselors in the United States (over 5,300 interviews), was released by the College Board's National Office for School Counselor Advocacy, the National Association of Secondary School Principals, and the American School Counselor Association. The study shared school counselors' views on educational policies, practices, and reform, and how many of them, especially in urban and rural school settings, are not given the chance to focus on what they were trained to do, especially career and college access counseling and readiness for all students, in part due to high caseloads and inappropriate tasks that take up too much of their time. School counselors made strong suggestions about their crucial role in accountability and success for all students and how school systems need to change so that <b>school</b> <b>counselors</b> <b>can</b> be key players in student success. Implications for public policy and district and school-wide change are addressed. The National Center for Transforming School Counseling at The Education Trust released a brief, Poised to Lead: How <b>School</b> <b>Counselors</b> <b>Can</b> Drive Career and College Readiness, challenging all schools to utilize school counselors for equity and access for rigorous courses for all students and ensuring college and career access skills and competencies be a major focus of the work of school counselors K-12.|$|E

40|$|According to the American School Counseling Association (ASCA, 2010), <b>school</b> <b>counselors</b> {{are charged}} with meeting the academic, social/emotional and career needs of all {{students}} (2010).
