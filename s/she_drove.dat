25|$|Writer Jack Olsen {{had earlier}} {{advanced}} a similar theory {{in his book}} The Bridge at Chappaquiddick, published early in 1970.

Olsen wrote that Kopechne normally drove a smaller Volkswagen model car, which was much lighter and easier to handle than Kennedy's larger Oldsmobile.|$|E

Googoosh performed many times for the royal family and was a favorite of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi's wife and children. She performed at the party given for the 1977 birthday of Reza Pahlavi, Crown Prince of Iran.|$|E
