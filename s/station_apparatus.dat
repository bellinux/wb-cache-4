40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 17 - 20, 1994 / Town & Country Hotel and Conference Center, San Diego, CaliforniaAn earth <b>station</b> <b>apparatus</b> and its {{technical}} specificities {{and components}} {{are described in}} this article. Which is used for locating and telecontrol of flying objects. The pseudo-random spread spectrum system compatible with GPS is used in measuring the distance and velocity of moving-targets. The ranging and range-rate measuring signals and telecontrol signal are included in up link. The CDMADS, GLOD code are used for ranging and range-rate measuring. The GLOD code rate varies from 1 Kbps to 2. 048 Mbps in step 1 bit. The subcarrier modulation systems of telecontrol are PSK, FSK, MFSK and High alphabet modulation. The frequency of subcarrier varies from 1 KHz to 1 MHZ in step 1 Hz. The rate of instruction code varies from 50 bps to 38. 4 Kbps in step 1 bit. The modulation indexes varies from 0. 7 to 2 in 16 steps. The polarization diversity technique of digital symmetical common mode and differential mode loops are applied in down link receiver. It is used for demodulation of back signal, ranging and range-rate measuring signal and A, E error signal used by track system. The digital technique and modularization bus technique are used throughout the apparetus. All modules in apparatus and their principle are discussed in thes article...|$|E
