40|$|Background. Limited {{information}} is available regarding the impact of childhood tumour on the cerebral hemispheres and supratentorial cranial fossa. However, a {{recent study found that}} children managed for a tumour located in this region may demonstrate reduced general language abilities. However, the indirect or direct impact of a tumour in this region on higher-level language abilities in childhood is at present largely unknown. Materials and methods. The present study examined the higher language and phonological awareness abilities of five children treated for <b>supratentorial</b> <b>tumour</b> ranging in age from seven to fourteen years in age. Assessments included measures of receptive and expressive semantic abilities, inferencing, figurative language, and problem solving, as well as a comprehensive pre-literacy test. Results. As a group, reductions were evident in problem solving, and in the ability to receive and decode content of high-level language when compared to a group of age- and gender-matched peers. At an individual level, only two of five children managed for <b>supratentorial</b> <b>tumour</b> demonstrated language deficits. These two cases were noted to be the same children previously identified as also having general language deficits. More widespread findings were noted in phonological awareness, with four of the five children previously managed for <b>supratentorial</b> <b>tumour</b> demonstrating weaknesses in one or more areas. Conclusions. Findings demonstrated that weaknesses in general language ability in children managed for <b>supratentorial</b> <b>tumour</b> may indicate higher-level language difficulties. Language abilities beyond general measures of language should be monitored, as well as long-term consideration of phonological awareness abilities in this population...|$|E
40|$|Background. To date {{few studies}} have {{investigated}} the impact of management for <b>supratentorial</b> <b>tumour</b> on the language abilities of children. In reporting children with brain tumour {{as part of a}} larger cohort of various aetiologies of brain injury, such studies have failed to differentiate between the causes of acquired childhood language disorders, or specifically report associated information relating to site and treatment. Material and methods. The present study examined the general language abilities of six children managed for <b>supratentorial</b> <b>tumour,</b> using a comprehensive standardized general language assessment battery, including receptive and expressive components, receptive vocabulary, and naming. Results. At a group level, children managed for <b>supratentorial</b> <b>tumour</b> performed below an individually matched control group in the area of general expressive language. However, at an individual case level it was revealed that only two cases exhibited specific language deficits. Reduced performance in the area of expressive language and syntax was evident in the language profile of one child treated surgically for a left parietal astrocytoma, while a child treated surgically for an optic nerve glioma demonstrated difficulties in receptive semantic abilities. The remaining four cases with similar treatments and locations demonstrated intact general language abilities. Conclusions. Factors such as site, long-term presence of tumour prior to diagnosis, young age at diagnosis, and variations in time post treatment were considered to have contributed to the findings. The need for long-term monitoring of language abilities post treatment as well as larger group sizes and the investigation of higher-level abilities was highlighte...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{confirmed}} {{the usefulness of}} Bispectral index (BIS) and spectral entropy in non-neurosurgical patients. The effects of thiopentone or propofol on BIS and entropy in patients with supratentorial tumours have not been studied. To address the above issue, we carried out a prospective, randomised controlled trial to determine the correlation between BIS, Response entropy and State entropy during different stages of induction of anaesthesia in neurosurgical patients. Twenty ASA I/II patients of either gender, aged 19 - 58 years undergoing excision of <b>supratentorial</b> <b>tumour</b> were selected for the study. The BIS was recorded using A- 2000 BIS monitor (Aspect medical systems, Newton, MA) and entropy monitored with Datex-Ohmeda S/ 5 entropy module (Helsinki, Finland) at various stages of induction of anaesthesia, using either thiopentone or propofol as the induction agent. We found that BIS and Entropy parameters correlated strongly {{at different stages of}} induction. The correlation was significant between BIS and Entropy at baseline, after fentanyl administration, after induction, and after intubation. We also noted that Entropy parameters unlike BIS are not affected by haemodynamic response due to intubation. To conclude, Entropy may be considered a valid indicator of the effects of thiopentone and propofol during different stages of induction of general anaesthesia neurosurgical patients...|$|E

40|$|The {{clinical}} {{course of}} intrinsic <b>supratentorial</b> <b>tumours</b> is variable. Prediction of outcome {{would be useful}} in defining patients for specific treatment policies. A retrospective analysis of 560 patients with intrinsic <b>supratentorial</b> <b>tumours</b> was performed. Proportional hazards models for survival were derived by using a stepwise selection procedure with only clinical and CT features as possible explanatory variables. The variables of prognostic importance were age, a first symptom of epilepsy, focal signs at presentation, a cystic lesion on CT scan, and duration of symptoms before presentation. The model defined a group with a good prognosis (score {{less than or equal}} to 9, n = 211) and a group with a poor prognosis (score greater than 9, n = 344). The median survival was 27 months for those with a score {{less than or equal to}} 9 or less and three months for those with score greater than 9. An alternative model, not including duration of symptoms, is also capable of defining groups with long (score less than or equal to 16, n = 234) and short (score greater than 16, n = 325) survival. The model may provide a means of classifying patients for inclusion in prospective randomised studies...|$|R
40|$|It is {{not known}} whether {{conservative}} or early aggressive (resective surgery with or without radiotherapy) management is better for tumours presenting with epilepsy. The prognosis of 560 patients with a clinical and CT diagnosis of intrinsic <b>supratentorial</b> <b>tumour</b> was examined retrospectively. Epilepsy was the first symptom in 164 patients. Histological confirmation of diagnosis was available in 391 (70 %) of cases. Median survival was 37 months in the group presenting with epilepsy and six months in those presenting with other symptoms (p less than 0. 0001). Patients presenting with epilepsy {{were more likely to}} have a normal clinical examination, a non-enhancing low density lesion on CT scan and a low grade tumour. From Cox's stepwise proportional hazards model, significant independent variables adversely affecting prognosis were increasing age, focal neurological signs and enhancing CT lesions at diagnosis, non-resective surgery and male sex. Of those presenting with epilepsy 80 patients had surgical treatment within two months of CT diagnosis. The Cox's model failed to identify any beneficial effects for either early resective surgery or radiotherapy. In primary intracerebral tumours with presentations other than epilepsy, resective surgery and radiotherapy were amongst the important factors associated with prolonged survival. Primary intracerebral tumours presenting with epilepsy are relatively benign and their outcome appears to be chiefly determined by clinical factors...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND A {{comparison}} {{of three different}} doses of mannitol on brain relaxation during supratentorial brain tumour craniotomy. Supratentorial tumours produce significant mass effects {{in the brain and}} certain types are accompanied by significant peritumoral oedema that leads to increased intracranial pressure. Higher osmotic pressure in the blood vessels after the infusion of mannitol drives water molecules from the brain tissue to blood vessels and results in brain tissue dehydration. The point of my study is to determine a dose that leads to a beneficial effect without triggering negative effects. MATERIALS AND METHODS This is a prospective, randomised single-blinded study conducted in Konaseema Institute of Medical Sciences, Amalapuram, from March 2015 to March 2017. After getting ethical committee approval and informed consent, 48 patients of both sexes (male and female) who underwent elective craniotomy for <b>supratentorial</b> <b>tumour</b> surgeries under general anaesthesia at were taken up for study. 48 patients were divided into three groups as group-A, group-B and group-C with 16 in each group. RESULTS There is significant change in brain relaxation score with increasing dose of mannitol. MAP and pH are significant with increasing dose of mannitol, serum sodium and potassium levels are also significant. Anion gap and urine output also showed significant change. Age, sex and BMI are not statistically significant. CONCLUSION From this study, it is concluded that 1. 5 mg/kg of 20...|$|E
40|$|Choroid plexus tumours {{are rare}} {{epithelial}} brain tumours and limited {{information is available}} regarding their biology and the best treatment. A meta-analysis was done to determine prognostic factors {{and the influence of}} various treatment modalities. A thorough review of the medical literature (1966 – 1998) revealed 566 well-documented choroid plexus tumours. These were entered into a database, which was analysed to determine prognostic factors and treatment modalities. Most patients with a <b>supratentorial</b> <b>tumour</b> were children, while the most common sites in adults were the fourth ventricle and the cerebellar pontine angle. Cerebellar pontine angle tumours were more frequently benign. Histology was the most important prognostic factor, as one, five, and 10 -year projected survival rates were 90, 81, and 77 % in choroid plexus-papilloma (n= 353) compared to only 71, 41, and 35 % in choroid plexus-carcinoma respectively (P 50. 0005). Surgery was prognostically relevant for both choroid plexus-papilloma (P= 0. 0005) and choroid plexus-carcinoma (P= 0. 0001). Radiotherapy was associated with significantly better survival in choroid plexus-carcinomas. Eight of 22 documented choroid plexus-carcinomas responded to chemotherapy. Relapse after primary treatment was a poor prognostic factor in choroid plexus-carcinoma patients but not in choroid plexus-papilloma patients. Treatment of choroid plexus tumours should start with radical surgical resection. This should be followed by adjuvant treatment in case of choroid plexus-carcinoma, and a ‘wait and see ’ approach in choroid plexus-papilloma...|$|E

Astrocytomas of the optic chiasm and hypothalamus make up 10  % to 15  % of <b>supratentorial</b> <b>tumours</b> in children; males and females are approximately equally affected.

40|$|Background and Aims: Patients with {{intracranial}} tumour {{are usually}} on anticonvulsants. Patients on phenytoin therapy demonstrate rapid metabolism of nondepolarising muscle relaxants secondary to enzyme induction. Infusion dose requirement of rocuronium in such patients has been sparingly studied. We studied the continuous infusion dose requirement of rocuronium bromide in patients on phenytoin therapy and its correlation with serum levels of phenytoin. Methods: Seventy-five patients scheduled for <b>supratentorial</b> <b>tumour</b> surgery {{were included in}} the study. Patients not on phenytoin were taken as control. The primary outcome variable studied was the infusion dose requirement of rocuronium in patients on phenytoin. Based on pre-operative serum phenytoin levels, study group patients were divided into two groups: sub-therapeutic level group (phenytoin level 10 μg/mL). Following anaesthesia induction, rocuronium bromide 0. 6 mg/kg was administered to achieve tracheal intubation. Rocuronium infusion was titrated to maintain zero response on the train-of-four response. Results: Demographic data were comparable. Patients receiving phenytoin required higher infusion dose compared to the control group (0. 429 ± 0. 2 mg/kg/h vs. 0. 265 ± 0. 15 mg/kg/h, P < 0. 001). The serum phenytoin level had no correlation to infusion dose requirement of rocuronium (0. 429 ± 0. 205 mg/kg/h vs. 0. 429 ± 0. 265 mg/kg/h (P = 0. 815). The recovery was faster in the phenytoin group compared to the control group. Haowever, it was not clinically significant. Conclusion: The infusion dose requirement of rocuronium bromide in patients on phenytoin is higher and the serum levels of phenytoin does not influence the dose required...|$|E
40|$|Background: Impaired {{autonomic}} function (AF) {{can result}} in adverse cardiovascular events during the perioperative period. Literature suggests that patients with intracranial space-occupying lesions experience impaired AF depending {{on the site of}} tumour and associated raised intracranial pressure (ICP). The complex interaction between general anaesthetics, AF and intracranial tumours with raised ICP has not been extensively studied. Objective: This study was aimed at evaluating the cardiac AF (in terms of heart rate variability [HRV]) in patients undergoing surgery for supratentorial tumours, at baseline and at different propofol effect site concentrations (Ce) during anaesthetic induction and the results were compared with patients undergoing non-cranial surgeries. Materials and Methods: In this prospective observational study, consecutive adult patients undergoing surgeries for <b>supratentorial</b> <b>tumour</b> (study group) and brachial plexus injury (control group) were recruited. Electrocardiogram was recorded for 5 min at three time points – before propofol induction, at propofol Ce 2 μg/ml and at Ce 4 μg/ml. Results: Forty-five patients were recruited, 24 in study group and 21 in control group. In spite of similar baseline heart rate and blood pressure, low frequency (LF), high frequency (HF) and total power were significantly higher in control group. Baseline LF/HF, though higher in patients with intracranial tumour (craniotomy: 2. 2 ± 2. 2, control: 1. 2 ± 1. 1), was not significantly different between the two groups (P = 0. 197). HRV variables in both the groups changed the same way in response to the increasing propofol Ce. Conclusion: HRV measurements were significantly different at baseline between the two groups. Following propofol administration, haemodynamic changes and HRV changes were similar in both the groups and also between the two groups...|$|E

Patients classified by the index as having a poor prognosis had a median survival of six months, and those classified as having a good prognosis had a median survival of five years.

40|$|Overall {{paediatric}} {{high grade}} glioma (pHGG) has a poor prognosis, {{in part due}} to the lack of understanding of the underlying biology. We therefore used high resolution 244 K oligo array comparative genomic hybridisation (oligo aCGH) (Agilent Technologies) to analyse DNA from 38 formalin-fixed paraffin embedded pHGG samples, including 13 DIPG. The pattern of gains and losses were distinct from those seen in HGG arising in adults. In particular we found 1 q gain in 21 % of our cohort compared to 9 % in adults. Homozygous loss at 8 p 12 was seen in 6 / 38 (15 %) of pHGG. This deletion has not been previously reported in adult or paediatric high grade gliomas. The minimal deleted region is of the gene ADAM 3 A and homozygous deletion of ADAM 3 A was confirmed by quantitative real time PCR (qPCR). This novel homozygous deletion of ADAM 3 A in pHGG merits further study. Amplification of the 4 q 11 - 13 region was detected in 8 % of cases and included PDGFRA and KIT and subsequent qPCR analysis was consistent with amplification of PDGFRA. MYCN amplification was seen in 2 / 38 samples (5 %) and was shown to be significantly associated with anaplastic astrocytomas (p= 0. 03). Loss of CDKN 2 A/B was seen in 4 / 38 (10 %) samples by oligo a CGH, confirmed by FISH on TMAs, and was restricted to <b>supratentorial</b> <b>tumours.</b> ~ 50 % of <b>supratentorial</b> <b>tumours</b> were positive for CDKN 2 B expression by IHC, whilst ~ 75 % of brainstem gliomas were positive for CDKN 2 B expression (p = 0. 03).

Methods: Single voxel MRS (1. 5  Tesla, TE 30  ms, TR 1500  ms) was performed on 27 children with PAs. Cases were designated ‘progressors’ if tumour progression led to their clinical management plan being altered. Results: Prior to treatment, <b>supratentorial</b> <b>tumours</b> had significantly higher myo-inositol (p <  0. 01, t-test) and glutamate plus glutamine (p =  0. 02, t-test) than cerebellar tumours.

40|$|Chemical {{analysis}} of brain tumour cyst contents has invalidated {{the concept of}} cyst formation being the result of tumour necrosis, and a common mechanism of vasogenic brain oedema and cyst formation, namely blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption, has been suggested. To analyse a possible relationship between the occurrence of vasogenic oedema and the presence, of cysts, we performed a volumetric analysis on the MRI and CT studies of 60 patients with primary or metastatic brain tumours. We compared four groups of tumours: 30 gliomas, of which 15 were cystic and 15 not and 30 metastatic brain tumours of which 15 were cystic and 15 not. Although the mean volume of oedema was similar for cystic and noncystic tumours, the ratio of oedema to tumour volume was approximately four times as high in cystic <b>supratentorial</b> <b>tumours.</b> This would {{support the view that}} cyst formation may be related to relatively greater production of oedema, possibly due to fusion of microcysts containing oedema fluid. The ratio of oedema to tumour volume is not greater in cystic cerebellar and intraventricular tumours. This {{may be due to the}} different anatomical organization of the cerebellar white matter, and the fact that the intraventricular tumours are bordered by subcortical grey matter.

40|$|Background: Neurosurgical {{patients}} {{often require}} administration of both, mannitol and hydroxyethyl starch (HES). A recent in vitro study demonstrated that HES {{in combination with}} mannitol could disturb coagulation parameters and should be avoided in neurosurgical practice. The aim of our study was to evaluate coagulation abnormalities due to mannitol when administered alone and in combination with HES in patients undergoing craniotomy for various intracranial brain tumours. Materials and Methods: We enrolled 30 adult patients undergoing craniotomy. Patients were randomised into two groups using a computer generated randomisation chart. Interventions: Group A: Patients received 10 ml/kg 0. 9 % normal saline and 1 g/kg mannitol and Group B: Patients received 10 ml/kg, HES 130 / 0. 4, and 1 gm/kg mannitol; immediately after induction of general anaesthesia. Rotational thromboelastography was done immediately after induction of general anaesthesia and 5 min after administration of mannitol. Measured parameters of blood coagulation were clotting time (CT) and clot formation time (CFT) with EXTEM and maximum clot firmness (MCF) with EXTEM and (FIBTEM). Results: Fourteen patients in each group completed the study. Insignificant change was noted in CT; CFT altered significantly from the baseline in both the groups (P 0. 05), but significantly differed between groups (P = 0. 001). However, all values were in normal range. Conclusion: Mannitol 1 g/kg and HES 10 ml/kg can be safely administered in patients undergoing craniotomy for <b>supratentorial</b> <b>tumours,</b> without clinically significant changes in coagulation parameters...|$|R
40|$|SYNOPSIS A {{retrospective}} {{study has been}} carried out on 67 patients with posteriorfossa haemangio-blastomata. Clinical details are presented, and the problems of diagnosis discussed. A fresh definition of the von Hippel-Lindau complex is put forward. The results of surgery are good for patients with solitary and sporadic tumours. Haemangioblastomata are histologically benign tumours occurring solely within the neuraxis. The incidence of haemangioblastomata among posterior fossa neoplasms varies from 7. 30 0 to 12 % (Olivecrona, 1952; Mondkar et al., 1967; Dastur and Lalitha, 1970; Gleave, 1970). Con-siderable interest lies in the association of these tumours with the von Hippel-Lindau complex and with erythrocytosis of the peripheral blood. Our understanding of these tumours still lacks a great deal, both in terms of simple data and in terms of explanations of the curious manifesta-tions exhibited by these remarkable tumours. A {{retrospective study}} {{has been carried out}} involving analysis of all cases of haemangioblastomata admitted to three neurosurgical units (St Bartholomew's Hospital, the London Hospital, and Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge). The material in the first two mentioned hospitals extends over 22 years and in the last hospital over 11 years. This study involved 76 patients with haemangioblastomata, five with spinal <b>tumours,</b> four with <b>supratentorial</b> <b>tumours,</b> and 67 with posterior fossa tumours.

The aim of this study was to investigate this region to gain insight into the role of 1 q genes in intracranial paediatric ependymoma. To address this issue we generated profiles of eleven ependymoma, including two relapse pairs and seven primary tumours, using comparative genome hybridisation and serial analysis of gene expression. Analysis of 656 SAGE tags mapping to 1 q identified CHI 3 L 1 and S 100 A 10 as the most upregulated genes in the relapse pair with de novo 1 q gain upon recurrence. Moreover, three more members of the S 100 family had distinct gene expression profiles in ependymoma. Candidates (CHI 3 L 1, S 100 A 10, S 100 A 4, S 100 A 6 and S 100 A 2) were validated using immunohistochemistry on a tissue microarray of 74 paediatric ependymoma. In necrotic cases, CHI 3 L 1 demonstrated a distinct staining pattern in tumour cells adjacent to the areas of necrosis. S 100 A 6 significantly correlated with <b>supratentorial</b> <b>tumours</b> (P< 0. 001) and S 100 A 4 with patients under the age of 3 years at diagnosis (P= 0. 038).

40|$|Background and Aims: Both inhalational and {{intravenous}} anaesthetic {{agents are}} being used for neuroanaesthesia. Clinical trials comparing "propofol and sevoflurane" and "desflurane and sevoflurane" have been published. However, the comparison of all the three anaesthetics in neurosurgical patients has not been done. A randomised clinical study was carried out comparing propofol, sevoflurane and desflurane to find the ideal neuroanaesthetic agent. Methods: A total of 75 adult patients undergoing elective craniotomy for <b>supratentorial</b> <b>tumours</b> {{were included in the}} study. The patients were induced with morphine 0. 1 mg/kg and thiopentone 4 - 6 mg/kg. Neuromuscular blockade was facilitated with vecuronium. The patients were randomised to receive propofol, sevoflurane or desflurane along with nitrous oxide in oxygen for maintenance of anaesthesia. The neuromuscular blockade was reversed following the surgery once the patients opened eyes or responded to verbal commands. The three anaesthetics were compared for their effects on haemodynamics, brain relaxation and emergence characteristics. Results: The mean arterial blood pressure during anaesthesia was comparable among the groups. The patients receiving sevoflurane had faster heart rates intraoperatively when compared to desflurane (P 0. 05). The time to response to verbal commands were significantly prolonged with use of sevoflurane (8. 0 ± 2. 9 min) when compared to propofol (5. 3 ± 2. 9 min) and desflurane (5. 2 ± 2. 6 min) (P = 0. 003). However, the time to emergence and the number of patients who had early emergence (0. 05). The quality of emergence (coughing and emergence agitation), as well as postoperative complications, were also comparable among the three groups. Conclusions: All the three anaesthetic agents-propofol, sevoflurane and desflurane appear comparable and acceptable with regard to their clinical profile during anaesthesia in patients undergoing elective supratentorial surgeries...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we study the {{feasibility}} of measuring the diverse biological parameters in stereotaxic biopsies from human brain lesions. These biological parameters are the nuclear area (NA), the proliferation index (PI) and the ploidy level, the latter of which was evaluated {{by means of the}} DNA index (DI) and histogram type (DHT). These parameters were assessed by means of the digital cell image analysis of Feulgen-stained nuclei. This analysis was performed on 124 samples from 22 computed tomography (CT) -guided stereotaxic biopsies. The data show that the methodology used here enables the above parameters to be assessed on small samples without limiting the classical anatomopathological diagnosis. The data also reveal that the DHT corresponded more accurately to the ploidy level in the sample analysed than the DI. Lastly, it appears that <b>supratentorial</b> astrocytic <b>tumours</b> of the adult, which constituted the majority of the cases analysed here, are strongly heterogeneous at a biological level.

40|$|SummaryBackgroundAnaplastic oligodendrogliomas (AO) are infiltrative, mostly <b>supratentorial</b> <b>tumours,</b> often bilaterally {{affecting}} the white matter. Radiotherapy {{alone or in}} combination with chemotherapy {{have a role in}} the adjuvant treatment of AO, but currently the efficacy of various treatment modalities could not be definitively determined because of the heterogeneity of the therapies used. AimAssessment of the efficacy of altered therapy schedules in postoperative treatment of patients with anaplastic oligodendrogliomasMaterials/MethodsBetween 1975 and 2000, 101 adult patients with anaplastic oligodendrogliomas were postoperatively treated in our institution. During this period patients received conventional radiation therapy and chemotherapy (CRT/CH), conventional radiation therapy (CRT), and split course hypofractionated radiation therapy (SCHRT). Between 1975 and 1985, CRT/CH was applied in 42 patients. Whole brain irradiation was delivered; the tumour dose of 5 Gy in 25 fractions over 5 weeks was calculated at the midplane of the skull. Then treatment fields were reduced and a 10 Gy boost was given in 5 fractions over 5 days to the known tumour bearing area. On the last day of irradiation patients began the first of six planned series of chemotherapy with CCNU, given 100 mg/ 2, orally every 8 weeks. From 1986 to 1990, CRT was received by 27 patients. Irradiation was only as described above. Between 1991 and 2000, 32 patients were given SCHRT. There were 3 courses of irradiation separated by a one-month interval. In each of the two first series patients received 20 Gy in 5 fractions in five days to the whole brain, and in the third course a 20 Gy boost in 5 fractions over 5 days was given as in the CRT regimen. ResultsActuarial overall survival rates at two and five years were 38 % and 10 % respectively for patients treated with CRT/CH, 36 % and 11 % for the CRT group, and 23 % and 6 % for the SCHRT option. Multivariate analysis revealed that only age was a significant factor. Patients aged 45 years or less carried the best prognosis. ConclusionsThe efficacy of different postoperative treatments administered to our patients with anaplastic oligodendrogliomas gave approximately comparable and unrewarding poor results...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND Brain {{neoplasms}} {{occur at}} {{all ages and}} account for around 2 - 3 percent of all deaths in adults. In children, the frequency increases to more than twenty percent. In children, it forms {{the second most common}} type of malignancy. Most of the tumours encountered are not related to any identifiable risk factors except for irradiation and some hereditary syndromes like subependymal giant cell astrocytoma, glioblastoma multiforme, cerebellar haemangioblastoma, meningioma, Schwannoma of 7 th cranial nerve. Gliomas constitute fifty percent of the brain tumours and sixty percent of all gliomas are glioblastoma multiforme. Meningiomas constitute twenty percent and cerebral metastasis is seen in fifteen percent of the cases. Seventy percent of <b>supratentorial</b> <b>tumours</b> are found in adults and seventy percent of brain tumours in children are infratentorial. The three common tumours of cerebellum are medulloblastoma, haemangioblastoma and juvenile pilocytic astrocytoma. Brain tumours are space occupying lesions and cause compression and destruction of adjacent structures, brain oedema (Peritumoural tissue), infarction and ischaemia of brain by compressing/infiltrating cerebral blood vessels, obstruction of CSF flow causing hydrocephalus, and rise in intracranial pressure with herniations. Tumours can undergo ischaemic necrosis and necrotic tumours tend to bleed. Brain tumours generally do not metastasise. Schwannoma and meningioma are benign tumours. Medulloblastoma of childhood may have drop metastasis via CSF. A sincere effort has been put in this study to identify the incidence of each variety of brain tumour among the fifty confirmed and identified cases of brain tumours. METHODS The age range of the cases in present study was 5 - 72 years {{with a mean age of}} occurrence of 44. 11 years and the peak age group affected were in the 3 rd and 4 th decades. Cerebral hemisphere was the commonest site for intracranial tumours. RESULT In the present study, fifty six percent of the cases were of neuroepithelial in origin. Twenty eight percent were meningiomas. Only one case was metastatic in origin and in two patients the pituitary adenomas were confirmed. The study is in agreement with the other studies when compared. CONCLUSION Cerebrum was the commonest site of intracranial tumours. Neuroepithelial tumours were the most common histological type followed by pituitary tumours and meningiomas. Majority of malignant intracranial tumours were WHO grade I. Rare variant like clear cell type was also observed. Most meningiomas were of grade I, but most astrocytomas were of higher grade...|$|R
40|$|The {{diagnostic}} and prognostic {{value of the}} DNA ploidy level (nuclear DNA content) was studied {{in a series of}} 847 tumours of the nervous system. This series included 93 nerve sheath tumours, 224 meningiomas, 389 neuro-epithelial tissue tumours, 46 primitive neuroectodermal tumours (retinoblastomas, medulloblastomas, neuroblastomas, etc.) and 95 brain metastases. The DNA ploidy level determination was carried out by means of the computer-assisted microscope analysis (digital cell image analysis) of Feulgen-stained nuclei. The results show that the DNA ploidy level does not contribute significant diagnostic information when tumours are analyzed individually. Indeed, some tumours which are definitely benign like certain schwannomas and meningiomas can exhibit very high levels of aneuploidy, while some highly malignant tumours like certain glioblastomas and neuroblastomas can be diploid. In contrast to its weak diagnostic value, the DNA ploidy level appears to be a powerful prognostic factor with respect to the <b>supratentorial</b> astrocytic <b>tumours</b> of the adult. Indeed, patients with hypertriploid astrocytic tumours exhibit a survival period which is significantly longer when compared to that of patients with non-hypertriploid astrocytic tumours. These hypertriploid astrocytic tumours could be involved in a process of biological degeneration when reference is made to their proliferation activity which is significantly weaker than that of non-hypertriploid tumours.

40|$|Background: Gabapentin attenuates the haemodynamics, {{decreases}} the catecholamine release {{and has a}} neuroprotective effect. The aim {{of the present study}} was to assess the effect of gabapentin in patients with <b>supratentorial</b> brain <b>tumours</b> undergoing craniotomy under general anaesthesia. Methods: A radial arterial line, central venous line and ventriculostomy catheters were inserted before surgery. Anaesthesia was induced with thiopental, fentanyl and atracurium and maintained with sevoflurane, fentanyl and atracurium infusion. The study included 160 patients classified randomly into two groups: Group G: The patients received gabapentin capsules 1200 mg orally 2 h before surgery. Group C: The patients received placebo capsules. Results: The heart rate, mean arterial blood pressure and intracranial pressure decreased significantly with gabapentin as compared to the control group (P < 0. 05). The dose of fentanyl and end-tidal sevoflurane was lower with gabapentin than the control group (P < 0. 05). The urine output was higher in the gabapentin group than the control group (P < 0. 05). The Glasgow coma scale score was better in the gabapentin group as compared to the control group (P < 0. 05). The incidence of nausea and vomiting was lower in the gabapentin group as compared to the control group (P < 0. 05). Conclusions: Pre-operative administration of gabapentin in patients undergoing craniotomy under general anaesthesia minimised the fluctuations in haemodynamics, reduced the requirements for sevoflurane and fentanyl, decreased intracranial pressure and improved the outcomes. There were some side effects associated with gabapentin such as hypotension and bradycardia...|$|R
