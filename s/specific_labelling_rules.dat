40|$|Farming in {{the islands}} of the European Union faces {{specific}} challenges due to isolation and small size, which justify specific policy tools in terms of structural and regional polices. The question whether the output of island farming (island agricultural and food products) is of such a <b>specific</b> quality that <b>labelling</b> it as such by ways of an optional quality term {{in the sense of}} Regulation (EC) No 1151 / 2012 is justified or not. Capturing the socio-economic reality of island farming in the EU as well as the labelling strategies pursued by stakeholders on the market demonstrates that a <b>specific</b> <b>labelling</b> <b>rule</b> for island products has benefits in particular for small producers and/or small islands, but that it would better be accompanied by the <b>labelling</b> of the <b>specific</b> name of the island(s) concerned.

40|$|Abstract—Association rule mining for {{classification}} is a {{data mining}} technique for finding informative patterns from large datasets. Output {{is in the}} form of if-then rules containing attribute value combinations in antecedent and class label in the consequent. This method is popular for classification as rules are simple to understand and allow users to look into the factors leading to a <b>specific</b> class <b>label.</b> <b>Rule</b> mining methods based on swarm intelligence, specifically particle swarms, can effectively handle problems with large number of instances and mixed data. But the issue of classification over imbalanced datasets, wherein samples from one class greatly outnumber the other class, has not been fully investigated so far. A rule mining method based on Dynamic Particle Swarm and Ant Colony Optimizer that can handle data imbalance, has been proposed in this paper. Performance of the proposed algorithm has been compared with other state-of-the-art methods. Results indicate that in terms of quality, the proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.

40|$|In immunoelectron {{microscopy}} (immuno-EM) on ultrathin sections, gold {{particles are}} used for localization of molecular components of cells. These particles are countable, and quantitative methods have been established to estimate and evaluate the density and distribution of “raw” gold particle counts from a single uncontrolled labeling experiment. However, these raw counts are composed of two distinct elements: particles that are <b>specific</b> (<b>specific</b> <b>labeling)</b> and particles that are not (nonspecific labeling) for the target component. So far, approaches for assessment of <b>specific</b> <b>labeling</b> and for correction of raw gold particle counts to reveal <b>specific</b> <b>labeling</b> densities and distributions have not attracted much attention. Here, we discuss experimental strategies for determining specificity in immuno-EM, and we present methods for quantitative assessment of (1) the probability that an observed gold particle is specific for the target, (2) the density of <b>specific</b> <b>labeling,</b> and (3) the distribution of <b>specific</b> <b>labeling</b> over a series of compartments. These methods should be of general utility for researchers investigating the distribution of cellular components using on-section immunogold labeling.

40|$|The second {{harmonic}} generation (SHG) active nanocrystals have been demonstrated as attractive imaging probes in nonlinear microscopy due to their coherent, non-bleaching and non-blinking signals with a broad flexibility {{in the choice of}} excitation wavelength.
