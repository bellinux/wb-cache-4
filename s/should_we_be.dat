500|$|The BBC Deputy Director General, Mark Byford, also {{defended the}} {{decision}} {{on the day of}} the programme, saying: [...] " [...] should have the right to be heard, be challenged, and for the public who take part in Question Time and the viewers to make up their own minds about the views of the BNP. It's not for the BBC to censor and say they can't be on". The BBC's chief political adviser, Ric Bailey, stated after the failed appeal that the BBC [...] "would have been breaking its charter if it had not treated the BNP with impartiality ... We absolutely stand by that judgement, even though there's obviously been a lot of controversy about it". A senior BBC presenter, John Humphrys, said the decision was [...] "absolutely right". He said: [...] "Why <b>should</b> <b>we</b> <b>be</b> afraid of what they have to say? Free speech is the issue here, and the BBC's obligations." [...] However, broadcasting unions said some of its members would protest at the invitation.|$|E

500|$|In April 2011 {{before the}} release of Thor (2011), Marvel Studios {{president}} Kevin Feige stated that following The Avengers (2012), [...] "Thor will go off into a new adventure." [...] Kenneth Branagh, director of Thor, responded to his comments, saying, [...] "It is kind of news to me. Here's what I would say to that: It's that I'm thrilled they're that confident. I shall wait for the audience to tell us whether {{there should be a}} second one, and then if that's a nice conversation to be had [...] all of us, that'd be thrilling. But I've got too much Irish superstitious blood in me to assume that Thor 2 will happen. But if Marvel says so, then I guess it must be true". Feige later explained that Marvel Studios would gauge how well Thor did at the box office before announcing sequels, but stated, [...] "Don Payne is working on story ideas for a part two. We've got various options with Ken [...] to discuss coming back, but right now {{the focus is on the}} first one. Don is, slowly but surely, thinking about where to take the character next <b>should</b> <b>we</b> <b>be</b> so lucky".|$|E

2500|$|One of Buck's final public {{appearances}} was on September 17, 2001 at Busch Memorial Stadium in St. Louis. It {{was the first}} night that Major League Baseball resumed {{after the terrorist attacks}} of September 11. Although looking rather frail (Buck at the time was sick with lung cancer) and struggling to maintain his composure (Buck was obviously showing the signs of Parkinson's disease as well), Buck stirred emotions by reading a patriotic-themed poem during the pregame ceremonies. He concluded by silencing critics who thought baseball had come back too soon: [...] "I don't know about you, but as for me, the question has already been answered: <b>Should</b> <b>we</b> <b>be</b> here? Yes!" ...|$|E

Long also reports {{the fate of the}} descendants of the Howards who chose to stay on the planet of the Little People.

2500|$|A Baraita {{taught that}} the words of [...] "This is my God, and I will adorn him," [...] teach that one should adorn oneself before God in the {{fulfillment}} of the commandments. Thus, the Gemara taught that in God's honor, one should make a beautiful sukkah, a beautiful lulav, a beautiful shofar, beautiful tzitzit, and a beautiful Torah Scroll, and write it with fine ink, a fine reed pen, and a skilled penman, and wrap it about with beautiful silks. Abba Saul interpreted the word for [...] "and I will glorify Him" [...] ( [...] , v'anveihu) in [...] to mean [...] "and I will be like Him." [...] Thus, Abba Saul reasoned, we should seek to be like God. Just as God is gracious and compassionate, so <b>should</b> <b>we</b> <b>be</b> gracious and compassionate..

2500|$|John Harris, {{an expert}} in bioethics, {{has said that it}} would be {{unethical}} to stop healthy people taking the drug. He pointed out the logical non sequitur which would result if people were to draw a parallel between the claims of a university that they could [...] "set out deliberately to improve the mental capacities of its students; suppose its stated aims were to ensure that students left the university more intelligent and learned than when they arrived. Suppose they further claimed that not only could they achieve this but that their students would be more intelligent and mentally alert than any students in history." [...] He then asked the rhetorical question of whether, [...] "if the claims could be sustained, <b>should</b> <b>we</b> <b>be</b> pleased?" [...] He argues that it would be [...] "not rational" [...] and against human enhancement to not use the drug to improve people's cognitive abilities.|$|E
2500|$|It was {{reported}} on January 31, 2008, that Redick asked his agent, Arn Tellem, {{to see about}} a possible trade. [...] "We want to see what's out there," [...] Redick told the Orlando Sentinel, [...] "I want to stay here, but it's been frustrating." [...] Magic coach Stan Van Gundy responded: [...] "Right now {{it would be very}} hard to fit him in. I know it's also hard to keep sitting him on the bench... <b>Should</b> <b>we</b> <b>be</b> playing him? Right now we're going good so we probably won't disrupt things." [...] The Orlando Magic confirmed Van Gundy's comments by stating that Redick would not receive more minutes or a trade before the Feb 21 trade deadline. In the last game of the season, with the playoff seed locked up, Redick received more time than he had all season and led the Magic with 18 points, {{for the first time in}} his career.|$|E

2500|$|Gillian Brock asks [...] "Do {{we have an}} {{obligation}} to ensure people have their basic needs met and can otherwise lead “decent” lives, or <b>should</b> <b>we</b> <b>be</b> more concerned with global socio-economic equality?". [...] 1.1 billion people [...] 18% of humanity [...] live below the World Bank's $2/day. Is this distribution of wealth and other goods just? What is the root cause of poverty, and are there systemic injustices in the world economy? John Rawls has said that [...] international obligations are between states as long as [...] "states meet a minimal condition of decency" [...] where as Thomas Nagel argues that obligations to the others are on an individual level and that moral reasons for restraint do not need to be satisfied for an individual to deserve equal treatment internationally. [...] Peter Singer argues in Famine, Affluence, and Morality that the rich have a moral obligation to give their money away to those who need it.|$|E
2500|$|Over {{the course}} of the 1990s, Jack Buck decided to reduce his {{schedule}} to calling only Cardinals home games (or 81 games a year unless there was a special occurrence). Health concerns obviously could have played a factor in this, as Buck suffered from such ailments as Parkinson's disease, diabetes, requiring a pacemaker, cataracts, sciatica, and vertigo. Buck once joked, [...] "I wish I'd get Alzheimer's, then I could forget I've got all the other stuff." [...] In 1998, the Cardinals dedicated a bust of Buck that showed him smiling with a hand cupping his left ear. In 1999, he lent his name to a restaurant venture called J. Buck's, with the restaurant's name being shared with son Joe and daughter Julie. One of Buck's final public appearances was on September 17, 2001 at Busch Memorial Stadium in St. Louis. It was the first night that Major League Baseball resumed after the terrorist attacks of September 11. Although looking rather frail (Buck at the time was sick with lung cancer) and struggling to maintain his composure (Buck was obviously showing the signs of Parkinson's disease as well), Buck stirred emotions by reading a patriotic-themed poem during the pregame ceremonies.
