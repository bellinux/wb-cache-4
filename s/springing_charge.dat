50|$|The {{land was}} part of a land patent called White Mill Seat in 1756. The name was changed to Peter's Mill Seat in 1800. Later, the area was called Crystal Springs, named after the pure water that flowed from several nearby springs. One of the springs was located near the modern-day {{intersection}} of Fourteenth and Kennedy streets, which still flows in the present day, creating a constant stream of water on the sidewalk of the western side of Fourteenth Street, across from the Metrobus building. The area had many chestnut trees, and it was considered a place to enjoy with family. The Passenger Railroad Company ran hourly stagecoaches from Fourteenth Street and Boundary Avenue to the <b>springs,</b> <b>charging</b> 25 cents per ride.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — In nature, {{many animals}} {{are able to}} jump, upright {{themselves}} after landing and jump again. This allows them to move in unstructured and rough terrain. As a further development of our previously presented 7 g jumping robot, we consider various mechanisms enabling it to recover and upright after landing and jump again. After a weighted evaluation of these different solutions, we present a spherical system with a mass of 9. 8 g and a diameter of 12 cm that is able to jump, upright itself after landing and jump again. In order to do so autonomously, it has a control unit and sensors to detect its orientation and <b>spring</b> <b>charging</b> state. With its current configuration it can overcome obstacles of 76 cm at a take-off angle of 75 ◦. I...|$|R

5|$|In April 2001, {{while he}} was on parole, a Los Angeles police officer found him {{wandering}} barefoot in Culver City, just outside Los Angeles. He was arrested for suspicion of being under the influence of drugs, but was released a few hours later, even though tests showed he had cocaine in his system. After this last arrest, producer David E. Kelley and other Ally McBeal executives ordered last-minute rewrites and reshoots and dismissed Downey from the show, despite the fact that Downey's character had resuscitated Ally McBeals ratings. The Culver City arrest also cost him a role in the high-profile film America's Sweethearts, and the subsequent incarceration forced Mel Gibson to shut down his planned stage production of Hamlet, as well. In July 2001, Downey pleaded no contest to the Palm <b>Springs</b> <b>charges,</b> avoiding jail time. Instead, he was sent into drug rehabilitation and put on a three-year probation, benefiting from the California Proposition 36, which had been passed the year before with the aim of helping nonviolent drug offenders overcome their addictions instead of sending them to jail.|$|R

40|$|A Dissertation {{submitted}} to the Department of Electrical Engineering for the MScConventional power electronics and electronic control circuits have been replacing by {{the intervention of the}} microprocessors/microcontrollers in modern industrial applications. This is mainly because with their applications the whole systems becomes more and more compact while enhancing the durability. On the other even with the more robust applications hand more accurate & fine operation could achieve by using such modern programming devices. This project was origin from based on an actual requirement of designing (10 v battery charging panel (to energize the batteries in <b>spring</b> <b>charge</b> type breakers) for electrical engineering division of Jaya Container Terminal(J. C. T) of Sri Lanka Ports Authority. But this technique would use to not only to <b>charge</b> batteries of <b>spring</b> <b>charge</b> breakers. but also batteries widely use in YHF communication hand held sets, explosive detectors, emergency lamps, etc [...] Rechargeable batteries are vital to portable electronic equipment such as laptop computers and cell phones. Fast charging circuits must be carefully designed and are highly dependent on the particular battery's chemistry. The most popular types of rechargeable batteries in use today are the Sealed-Lead-Acid (SLA), Nickel-Cadmium(NiCd), Nickel-Metal-Hydride (NiMH), and Lithium-Ion (Li-Ion). Li-Ion is fast becoming the chemistry of choice for many portable applications because it offers a high capacity-tosize (weight) ratio and a low self-discharge characteristic. Depending on the battery chemistry the charging characteristics of a battery differs to each other. In this project simply what I have done is allows the particular battery to follow its charging characteristic curve when they where you could not find in conventional charging techniques. The charging process is controlled by the software program microcontroller (PIC 16 F 876). Since the battery chemistries are different for different types of batteries, several sets of programs would have to written to the controller for each battery given by the manufacturer. There are some theoretical design calculations included for designing of power electronics modules. DCDC converter, square pulse generator, single rail power & dual rail power supplies,(etc [...] ) Calculations have been done based on highly theoretical facts. Therefore some practical observations are tends to differ from the theoretical approach. Most of the theories studied in the power electronic lessons of my M. S post graduate were widely used in doing above mentioned designs. At the beginning the actual target was to built a battery charging panel of 110 V,tut due to some limitations of purchasing of high capacity transformer which suit to this application,the project was limited to 40 V panel only. But the concept, approach & the guide line would be more or less same for the more advanced systems also...|$|R
