30|$|The {{tribological}} {{behaviors of}} {{two types of}} seal coatings, nickel–graphite and aluminum–hexagon-boron nitride (Ni–Cg and Al–hBN, respectively) versus a Ti– 6 Al– 4 V blade used in turbofan engines were investigated using a high-speed rubbing test. The wear status and damage mechanism of the friction couples were studied and the abradability of the seal coatings was evaluated. By analysis of the coating properties and damage mechanism of the <b>seal</b> <b>couple,</b> the friction heat effect was identified as the key factor influencing blade wear forms as well as coating abradability. A one-dimensional heat conduction model was established to estimate the effect of increasing temperature on the friction interface. The results indicated that in the Ni–Cg and Ti– 6 Al– 4 V <b>seal</b> <b>couple,</b> the temperature rising rate (TRR) of the Ti– 6 Al– 4 V blade was faster {{than that of the}} Ni–Cg coating, and so the Ti– 6 Al– 4 V blade softened earlier than the Ni–Cg coating, causing the blade to suffer severe wear. In the Al–hBN and Ti– 6 Al– 4 V <b>seal</b> <b>couple,</b> the TRR of the Ti– 6 Al– 4 V blade was slower than that of the Al–hBN coating, and so the Al–hBN coating softened first; thus, blade damage was reduced or even replaced by coating adhesion. The square root ratio of thermal diffusivity between the blade and the coating could be taken as an indicator of the ratio of TRR between the blade and coating to predict blade wear status as well as damage mechanism. The results of the model agreed well with the experiment results of the two <b>seal</b> <b>couples</b> used in this study.|$|R

The intervention rate at scheduled routine review visits and at unscheduled {{visits to the}} eye casualty service in the first 120  postoperative days was recorded. Interventions were defined as departures from predetermined postoperative care protocols.  RESULTS—Clinical interventions were reported in 2. 8 % (95 % confidence interval 1. 5  to 4. 1 %) of (n= 1652) routine follow up visits. Many of these interventions were avoidable or trivial; 90 % of patients had no postoperative intervention at any visit. 7. 3 % of patients made unscheduled visits to the emergency service. The intervention rate in this group was 50 % (35. 9  to 64. 1 %).  CONCLUSIONS—The intervention rate in routine clinical review after uncomplicated modern cataract surgery is low.

Two samples of Boom clay are resaturated in a new hollow cylinder triaxial cell with a short drainage path and then sheared by performing an axisymmetric triaxial loading. The effect of the undrained heating under deviatoric stress is studied on the first sample. It is shown that undrained temperature increase leads to an increase of pore water pressure and consequently to a decrease of the effective mean stress which brings the sample to failure. For an initially sheared sample, the failure occurs along the existing shear band which behaves as a weakness plane in the sample. The responses of the local strain measurement transducers clearly show the sliding of rigid blocks when failure occurs in the sample. The effect of the presence of a shear band on the permeability of the other Boom clay sample is investigated at ambient temperature andat 80 °C. It is shownthat the presence of a shear band does not affect significantly the permeability.

The reservoir consists of two perpendicular sets of fractures and faults, related to major regional tectonic structures, which have been clogged near surface by <b>self</b> <b>sealing.</b> The heat exchanges of the reservoir with the outside are reduced, through thermal and hydraulic blanketing, to conductive transfers. Convection cells are active within the reservoir, ensuring its thermal and geochemical homogeneity. Heat exchange with the magmatic chamber is only conductive.

Many arguments (equilibrium state, absence of tritium, low in/out fluxes, large reservoir volume) suggest a long residence time (> 100 years) of the geothermal fluid.
