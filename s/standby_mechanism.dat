They {{have been used as}} a <b>standby</b> <b>mechanism</b> upon which many science fiction authors rely to establish faster-than-light communication, with or without reference to causality issues. The word tachyon has become widely recognized {{to such an extent that}} it can impart a science-fictional connotation even if the subject in question has no particular relation to superluminal travel (a form of technobabble, akin to positronic brain).|$|E
5000|$|The {{hypothetical}} particles tachyons {{have inspired}} many occurrences of tachyons in fiction. The {{use of the}} word in science fiction dates back at least to 1970 when James Blish's Star Trek novel Spock Must Die! incorporated tachyons into an ill-fated transporter experiment.In general, tachyons are a <b>standby</b> <b>mechanism</b> upon which many science fiction authors rely to establish faster-than-light communication, with or without reference to causality issues. For example, in the Babylon 5 television series, tachyons are used for real-time communication over long distances. Another instance is Gregory Benford's novel Timescape, winner of the Nebula Award, which involves the use of tachyons to transmit a message of salvation back in time. Likewise, John Carpenter's horror film Prince of Darkness uses tachyons to explain how future humans send messages backward through time to warn the characters of their impending doom. By contrast, Alan Moore's classic comic book limited series Watchmen features a character who uses [...] "a squall of tachyons" [...] broadcasting from space to muddle the mind of the only person on Earth capable of seeing the future.|$|E

For {{the lack}} of computing, storage, {{information}} integration and other aspects in traditional electric power computing platform, {{it is necessary to}} introduce cloud computing to it and to build a cloud computing platform based on open source Hadoop to meet the requirements of smart grid. As the single point of failure of Hadoop cannot guarantee the high availability that electric power system requires, this paper gives a solution that based on hot <b>standby</b> <b>mechanism</b> and automatically failover controlled by Zookeeper, analyses availability and disaster recovery times to ensure the electric power system provides fast and accurate service...|$|E
40|$|Availability in Process Support Systems (PSS) can be {{achieved}} by using <b>standby</b> <b>mechanisms</b> that allow a backup server to take over in case a primary server fails. These mechanisms, resembling the process pair approach used in operating systems, require the primary to send information about state changes to the backup on a regular basis. In PSS where all relevant state information is stored in a database, there are two principal strategies for synchronizing a primary [...] backup pair. One is to use the replication mechanisms provided by the DBMS. Another is to implement a message mechanism to exchange state information between servers above the database level. For both approaches, several variants exist that allow to trade run-time performance for failover time. This paper discusses the possible strategies and evaluates their performance based on an implementation within the OPERA process support kernel. Moreover, it is shown how the mechanisms can be used as the basis for implementing process migration in a distributed setting...|$|R

40|$|In many {{desalination}} plants, multi stage flash desalination {{process is}} normally used for sea water purification. The probabilistic analysis and profitability {{of such a}} complex system with <b>standby</b> support <b>mechanism</b> is of great importance to avoid huge loses. Thus, {{the aim of this}} paper is to present a probabilistic analysis of evaporators of a desalination plant with major and minor failure categories and estimating various reliability indicators. The desalination plant operates round the clock and during the normal operation; six of the seven evaporators are in operation for water production while one evaporator is always under scheduled maintenance and used as standby. The complete plant is shut down for about one month during winter season for annual maintenance. The water supply during shutdown period is maintained through ground water and storage system. Any major failure or annual maintenance brings the evaporator/plant to a complete halt and appropriate repair or maintenance is undertaken. Measures of plant effectiveness such as mean time to system failure, availability, expected busy period for maintenance, expected busy period for repair, expected busy period during shutdown & expected number of repairs are obtained by using semi-Markov processes and regenerative point techniques. Profit incurred to the system is also evaluated. Seven years real data from a desalination plant are used in this analysis...|$|R

To success this exertion, {{we should consider}} not only power reduction of consumer electronics itself but also efficient automatic control in networked home environment. In this paper, we present a design approach and implementation result of control <b>mechanism</b> for <b>standby</b> power reduction. Proposed mechanism has the Host-Agent based structure and uses the IEEE 802. 15. 4 based ZigBee protocol for communication and security between Host and Agents. We verified reliability of proposed mechanism and reduction effect of standby power; also, we applied implemented device to scenario {{which is similar to}} user living pattern.

40|$|Abstract: Standby {{power is}} {{electric}} power that a device consumes {{when not in}} present use, but plugged in to a source of power and ready to be used. Present estimates indicate that standby power consumption reaches 10 to 15 percent of total residential electrical use. In this paper, we propose a Host-Agent based <b>standby</b> power control <b>mechanism</b> in home network environment. It uses the IEEE 802. 15. 4 based ZigBee communication protocol between Host and Agent for transmission and secure network. The Agent can acquire the local context information from various embedded sensor and sends the sensing information to the Host. The Host compares this context information from Agent with database and sends the standby power control message to the Agent. To prove the necessity and {{the efficiency of the}} proposed control mechanism, we have developed prototype devices and carried out simulation according to control scenario. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — This paper proposes the <b>standby</b> {{power saving}} <b>mechanism</b> that the user can {{terminate}} home network appliance (i. e. Personal Computer) power and standby {{power at the}} remote site. Generally, for the power management of the home appliance, {{it has to be}} put through the physical contact. In the proposed mechanism, the smartphone is offered the power on/off state information of the home network appliance on a real-time basis. The user can transmit the power-termination order to the home network appliance through the smartphone. If the home gateway receives the power-termination order from the smartphone, the power-termination order is sent to the home network appliance and the standby power is blocked. Its power and standby power can be blocked through the method to be proposed even through the user is not physically contacted with the home appliance. That is, the proposed mechanism gives convenience to the user in electric power management aspect. In addition, the power saving can be done, because reducing the unnecessary operation time and blocking the standby power of the home network appliance...|$|R
40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the Kenyan {{mediation}} of the Somali conflict and strategic intervention engagement between 2002 and 2012. The core aim {{of the study was}} to establish and evaluate the role and effects of track-one diplomacy on conflict management and post-conflict reconstruction as pertains to the Somali conflict and on the basis of the Kenyan experience. A qualitative approach was followed in this study. It employed a descriptive, explanatory and analytical case-study method. The data were collected through interviews and documentary analysis. The twenty-two participants in the study were drawn from the Kenyan Foreign Ministry, the Inter-Governmental Authority on Development (IGAD), the Regional Centre on Small Arms and Light Weapons (RECSA), the International Peace Support Training Centre (IPSTC), the East African <b>Standby</b> Force Co-ordination <b>Mechanism</b> (EASFCOM), the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM), the United Nations Political Office for Somalia (UNPOS), the African Peace Forum Organization (APFO), and selected respondents representing the Somali people. The documents comprised policy treatises, protocols, treaties, and communiqués highlighting the actions of the Kenyan government and other track-one actors in the Somali peace endeavour. Other scholarly research on official diplomacy, soft-power and conflict management by small States – in particular African case studies – were also utilised. The study revealed that Kenya’s diplomatic and stabilisation efforts had their own dynamics and challenges. This is especially so with regard to the preferred policy option of exercising diplomacy that utilises soft-power resources. This diplomacy had to contend with the challenges of dealing with sensitive aspects of the process. These sensitive aspects involved a recognition of and complicated engagement with the Somali conflict-constituencies, and a complex mapping of various actors and their respective interests. Contrary to the expected outcomes, interests and issues 17 proliferated, and the original peace-making agenda was consistently slowed down and complicated. The study also revealed that Kenya ought to have exercised a non-directive role in dealing with the different Somali conflict players. This role provides that such an “interested mediator” ought to exercise some considerable influence over the mediation environment. It also emerged from the study that as pertains to the current peace-making developments in Somalia that began in 2005 onwards to 2012, it is important that different intermediary co-operative roles be recognized and utilised. Towards this end, the study recommends that Kenya’s diplomacy should adopt a strategy of co-operation with those regional regimes that it helped to establish. A case in reference is the diplomatic opportunity of utilising regional arms control and disarmament diplomacy. This is Kenya’s intermediary co-operative role with RECSA, which is mandated to support arms control and disarmament implementation efforts in the East African region. The study also recommends that strategic foreign policy and regional actions by Kenya should be taken up given its new lease of engagement, noting that it was officially integrated into AMISOM in 2012. The study posited that in the ongoing engagement environment there would be a ‘revisiting’ of the experiences and complexities of the first phase of engagement (2002 - 2004). It is, therefore, recommended that Kenya should seize this opportunity and continue with its ‘facilitative and enabling role’ in its peace diplomacy, while utilising the lessons learnt in past engagements...|$|R
