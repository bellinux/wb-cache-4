500|$|The Portrait Series {{was first}} {{released}} by the Board of Commissioners of Currency Singapore (BCCS) on 9 September 1999 to welcome the new millennium, designed by local artist Eng Siak Loy. The series has a total of seven denominations in general circulation; the denominations $1 and $500 were not carried forward from the previous Ship Series. The colour for denominations up to $50 have been retained, a tradition kept since {{the era of the}} Malaya and British Borneo dollar. A more <b>standardised</b> <b>approach</b> is adopted across all banknote denominations, with features noticeably differing from all previous series. For example, the watermark no longer features the lion head symbol. Due to design considerations, the dollar sign was considered redundant and is no longer included in this series. [...] In addition, the note printing company no longer appears on any part of the portrait note.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the time}} of {{acquisition}} BankWest was reporting to the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) under to Basel I requirements, and under CBA ownership began reporting under Basel II Pillar 3 <b>standardised</b> <b>approach</b> requirements on 1 January 2009.(Refer the CBA 2009 Profit Announcement). At the time both HBOS and the CBA reported provisions for remaining consideration of circa $300 million. The acquisition was completed on 19 December 2008. (refer note 14 of the CBA 11 February 2009 half year profit announcement). The BankWest performing loan book as at 18 December 2008, had a value of approximately $57 billion, $18 billion of which were S (Standard and Poors) rated B+ or worse.(Refer the BankWest Credit Policy, the BankWest 2008A financial statements and the CBA Answers to Questions on Notice to the Parliamentary Inquiry(PJC)). As at 18 December 2008 BankWest owed its Parent HBOS a net figure of $21,076 million, and HBOS had secured a further $3,767 million loan from the RBA (Reserve Bank of Australia) to support the funding of the BankWest loan book. The BankWest Parent Company Funding therefore can be calculated as $17.3 billion being ($21,076 million minus $3,767 million). On completion, the CBA paid $14.513 to HBOS and $3,767 million to the RBA [...] leaving a loan from HBOS to the CBA of $2,797 million called the Excess Facility Amount loan.|$|E

30|$|KVA {{was first}} {{introduced}} by Andrew Green, Chris Kenyon, and Chris Dennis in 2014. They model it by adapting the semi-replication hedging strategy of (Burgard and Kjaer, 2011 a) to replicate the cost of capital of a trade. The issue here {{is not so much}} in pricing KVA, but rather knowing regulatory capital requirements and computing the expected value of capital through time. That is either done through <b>standardised</b> <b>approaches</b> or internal model methods.|$|R

50|$|There {{is a lack}} of {{consensus}} on what constitutes the 'ideal' early warning score system. Comparing different systems in clinical use shows variation in which parameters are scored and how those scores are assigned to differing levels of deterioration.

This has led to a call in several countries {{for the development of a}} national early warning score that would allow a <b>standardised</b> <b>approach</b> to assessing and responding to deteriorating patients.|$|E
40|$|Despite {{the growth}} in {{theoretical}} understandings of health behaviour and <b>standardised</b> <b>approaches</b> to health interventions (e. g. behaviour change taxonomies), health psychology has paid comparatively less attention {{to the importance of}} the implementation processes – ‘how to’ rather than ‘what to’ of such interventions.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} supply-side factors {{underpinning technology}} forcing by national policymakers {{in the low}} carbon vehicle sector. It focuses on five countries France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the UK and examines the driving imperatives for promoting alternative fuel vehicle and, in particular, electric vehicle uptake. It does so by looking at four overarching concerns for decision-makers; energy security, sustainable development, impact on the existing automotive sector and the pressure from sub-national actors. The paper seeks to show that national policy in the five selected countries is heterogeneous in nature making consistent, <b>standardised</b> <b>approaches</b> to policy implementation a challenge, despite the similarity in ambition to advance instances of electromobility and to transition from conventional transport technology to alternative fuel vehicles...|$|R

It is clear that a more <b>standardised</b> <b>approach</b> is needed to safeguard the rights of the Officer and ensure fair treatment across Forces.|$|E
50|$|In the 1950s and 1960s State Housing designs changed due to cost, to {{material}} shortages and to concerns about 'urban sprawl' in Porirua and in wider New Zealand. Housing became increasingly standardised and cheaper material like fibrolite came into use. This was generally unpopular, with growing negative public perceptions of State housing. It was markedly {{different from the}} approach adopted by Michael Joseph Savage in 1939, where 400 different designs by architects meant no two homes were exactly alike and where low-density, single-unit dwellings characterised State housing in Porirua. In part this change to a more <b>standardised</b> <b>approach</b> came {{in response to the}} material shortages in the 1950s, which meant importing 500 pre-cut houses for the southern part of Titahi Bay. A total of 194 tradesmen came from Austria on 18-month contracts to complete these houses.|$|E

Because this framework approach does not rely on traditional IP QoS mechanisms it {{can be applied to}} arbitrary combinations of IP transport technologies. In order to save up network resources and, at the same time, provide appropriate service performance to the subscribers multiple factors (such as individual QoS requirements of different media and codecs) are considered to perform scalable end-to-en...|$|R

The methodology NFS AM001, does not involve predicting land use changes in specific places at specific times, but applies a risk-based approach to baseline quantification which allows for a programmatic approach to reducing emissions. [...] This allows efficient, valid and comparable results to be produced akin to performance benchmarking, where projects within a given region can use a consistent set of baseline data and accounting methods which provides a <b>standardised</b> <b>approach</b> to quantification of carbon benefits and is based on forest at risk and not a percentage or absolute rate of loss.The methodology allows a combination of remote sensing and ground based data as monitoring sources for monitoring the emissions from the project areas, with emphasis placed on satellite monitoring, such as PRODES for application in Amazonia.|$|E
50|$|Based on the {{original}} Basel Accord, under the <b>Standardised</b> <b>Approach,</b> banks’ activities are divided into eight business lines: corporate finance, trading & sales, retail banking, commercial banking, payment & settlement, agency services, asset management, and retail brokerage. Within each business line, gross income is a broad indicator {{that serves as a}} proxy for the scale of business operations and thus the likely scale of operational risk exposure within each of these business lines. The capital charge for each business line is calculated by multiplying gross income by a factor (denoted beta) assigned to that business line. Beta serves as a proxy for the industry-wide relationship between the operational risk loss experience for a given business line and the aggregate level of gross income for thatbusiness line.The total capital charge is calculated as the three-year average of the simple summation of the regulatory capital charges across each of the business lines in each year. In any given year, negative capital charges (resulting from negative gross income) in any business line may offset positive capital charges in other business lines without limit.|$|E
5000|$|Predicting where {{performers}} {{would fall}} on the curve involved considering the possible {{advantages and disadvantages of}} using these two adaptive resources. A strategy of relying entirely on altering pause duration to adapt to a new tempo—falling on (1.0,0.5)—would permit the same number of pauses to be used irrespective of tempo. Theoretically, this would enable readers to use a standardised scanpath across a score, whereas if they changed the number of their pauses to adapt to a new tempo, their scanpath would need to be redesigned, sacrificing the benefits of a <b>standardised</b> <b>approach.</b> There is no doubt that readers are able to change their pause duration and number both from moment to moment and averaged over longer stretches of reading. Musicians typically use a large range of fixation durations within a single reading, even at a stable tempo. Indeed, successive fixation durations appear to vary considerably, and seemingly at random; one fixation might be 200 ms, the next 370 ms, and the next 240 ms. (There are no data on successive pause durations in the literature, so mean fixation duration is cited here as a near-equivalent.) ...|$|E
