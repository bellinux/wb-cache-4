5000|$|The {{band was}} formed in 1999 when guitarist Mikael Sandorf, {{split-up}} from his previous melodic death metal band Gates of Ishtar and shortly afterwards the band was created. Initially the band would be named Soulash, until changing it in 2001 to The Duskfall. Although line-up changes would hamper the band at first when band members Tommi Konu and Urban Carlsson departed, they would quickly fill the vacant <b>slots</b> with <b>drummer</b> Oskar Karlsson (from the later period of Gates of Ishtar) and bassist Kaj Molin.

50|$|In 1995, Watson and Pottie {{exited the}} band partway through the {{recording}} of their third album, Aurora. The band, now down to Cripps and McAdorey, completed the album with session musicians John Borra and Mike Sloski as their rhythm section. Gavin Brown and Eric Chenaux took over the bass and <b>drum</b> <b>slots</b> on the subsequent tour.|$|R
50|$|In August 1989, vocalist Dennis Owens, guitarist Jake Kline, keyboardist Rodi DelGadillo, bassist Deryke Cardenaz, {{and drummer}} Christine Tasche formed a band called The Silent Invasion, which played one show shortly before Tasche left the band. The {{remaining}} members {{decided to change}} the band's name to Suburban Rhythm; Ed Kampwirth replaced Cardenaz on bass while Carlos de la Garza, drummer for Cerritos ska band The Trenchtown Invaders, filled the band's <b>drum</b> <b>slot.</b>|$|R
5000|$|At {{different}} points in the show, individual solo slots were offered up, typically a bass solo, a guitar solo, then later a drum solo. The <b>drum</b> <b>slot</b> was often the most popular, with James Hetfield often taking a seat behind the second kit, dueling with Ulrich. Drum parts from other bands such as Slayer might be quoted, or Kirk Hammett might appear to play a bit of [...] "Smoke on the Water" [...] along with the drums. The bass solos often included segments with the guitars.|$|R
5000|$|He also drummed for McCaughey's band, The Minus 5, which {{occasionally}} included guitarist Peter Buck. Eventually Buck offered Rieflin {{the opportunity}} to sit in with R.E.M., who were missing a permanent drummer since the 1997 departure of Bill Berry. The band gave him the live <b>drummer</b> <b>slot</b> in its 2003 tour. [...] They later announced that Rieflin would fill the role indefinitely, though once again as a hired musician {{rather than as an}} official member. In recordings, Rieflin also contributed bouzouki, keyboards and guitars to the group, serving as an auxiliary member until R.E.M. disbanded in 2011.|$|R
5000|$|Rotating-drum action {{first seen}} on the M1867 Werndl-Holub and later on the Magnum Research Lone Eagle pistol, the breech closure is a {{rotating}} drum with the same axis, but offset from the bore. When locked, a firing pin aligns with the primer and the breech is otherwise solid. When rotated open, a <b>slot</b> in the <b>drum</b> is exposed for extraction and feeding of a new round. Though first used on the Werndl-Holub, this action {{is commonly known as}} a cannon breech due to its association with the French 75mm Model of 1897 cannon. The French M1897 was, itself, based on William Hubbell's [...]|$|R
50|$|Yo-yo, pile-up, or pilewind, hoists use yo-yo type devices {{instead of}} {{helically}} grooved drums. The yo-yos lines are coiled into overlapping layers of cable {{in the narrow}} <b>slots.</b> The pile-up <b>drum</b> hoists are usually used in low load. As the hoists are narrower than helically grooved drum hoists, these {{can be used in}} the places with limited space. Pile-up drum hoists can be mounted in many locations including ceiling, floor or wall mounting. Typical applications are to have a pile-up drum hoist with many pulleys to control a batten. Since the line is piled up on itself, this type of drum hoist provides a zero fleet angle solution.|$|R
50|$|After a 2-year silence period, {{the band}} would {{eventually}} see the vacant <b>drummer</b> <b>slot</b> filled by ex Catharsis member Alexei Rodriguez, {{who called the}} band after returning from Germany. It was {{at the same time}} that Candace was on her way to audition for a local indie band when she received the call from Mike saying that WOJ were re-forming. In April 2003 the band began touring again, playing major hardcore events such as Hellfest in Syracuse, New York. Complete with their new drummer, the band began writing new material and had completed recording in September 2003. All Hail the Dead was released in February 2004, 5 years since the release of The Bound Feed the Gagged.|$|R
5000|$|During this time, Josefa hand-carved {{authentic}} Polynesian tiki and honed {{his skills}} as a Samoan knife dancer perfecting {{the art of the}} Nifo Oti (Samoan sword) and spectacular Fire Knife dance. It was in this era (1957) that Josefa served in the United States Army at Schofield Barracks, Hawaii. During the 1950s through early 1970s, Josefa performed as a knife dancer and musician in Waikiki at Duke Kahanamoku's and was featured knife dancer at the International Market Place's Polynesian Revue as well as the Royal Hawaiian and Sheraton Hotel's luaus. He performed with Hawaii’s biggest entertainers of the era like Don Ho, Kui Lee, Martin Denny and Ed Kenney. Josefa was featured in the first authentic Polynesian show with Kimo Lee in New York's Lexington Hotel. Aside from being a knife dancer, Josefa was a musician singing and playing a variety of instruments, specializing in guitar and Tahitian bass <b>drum</b> and to'ere (<b>slotted</b> wooden <b>drum).</b> Josefa was recorded performing with the International Market Place troupe on the popular 1962 album POLYNESIAN POT-POURRI on which you can hear him perform the Samoan [...] "slap dance" [...] on track 11 - S'au S'au Wale.|$|R
5000|$|The {{heartwood}} of the Portia tree is dark reddish brown to {{chocolate brown}} {{and has a}} specific gravity of 0.55 to 0.89. It is {{used to make the}} thavil, a Carnatic musical instrument of South India. Milo is popular in Hawaii for woodworking (commonly turned into bowls) because of the range of colours expressed (tan, through yellow, to red). Traditionally it was planted in sacred groves and used for religious sculpture throughout eastern Polynesia. In Tahiti, Milo wood is used in the making of the to'ere (<b>slotted</b> wooden <b>drum),</b> used in traditional Tahitian tribal drumming. Makoi was used for the rongorongo tablets of Easter Island. Since the advent of aluminium-hulled boats in the 20th century, Pitcairners have made regular trips to Henderson Island to harvest miro wood. Usually they venture to Henderson only once per year, but may make up to three trips if the weather is favourable. Pitcairners carve the wood into curios, from which they derive much of their income. [...] The flower of the Portia tree played a part in Sri Lanka's independence struggle, when it was sold on Remembrance Day by the Suriya-Mal Movement instead of the poppy to aid indigenous ex-servicemen.|$|R
5000|$|After {{graduation}} in 1993, he {{left the}} band scene, took his MCATs and passed the time building cabinets for a Phoenix contractor. He rarely followed the local bands but was aware of buzz surrounding the Refreshments, a group which included Clyne and Naffah’s friend, guitarist Brian Blush. In 1995, Blush called Naffah, inviting him to audition for the band’s then-open <b>drummer</b> <b>slot.</b> Naffah decided that a career in medicine could wait and he joined the band. Signed by Mercury months later, the Refreshments grew from garage band to an early contender in the post-grunge landscape. Their first label album from 1996-1997 was the well-received Fizzy Fuzzy Big & Buzzy, which spawned two radio hits, [...] "Banditos" [...] and [...] "Down Together". New management was installed at the Mercury label and despite another noteworthy album, The Bottle and Fresh Horses, the Refreshments were cut loose and eventually disbanded.|$|R
5000|$|Carbon/Silicon {{recorded}} four demo CDs: Sample This, Peace; Dope Factory Boogie; The Grand Delusion and The Homecoming. The band's first officially released album, A.T.O.M (A Twist of Modern) debuted on the band's website on 28 July 2006. The next album Western Front followed {{soon after}} on 14 October 2006 and included re-recorded versions of their earlier songs. The group's third album, The Crackup Suite {{was released in}} March 2007.

5000|$|Furthermore, on August 22, 2015, Slash stated to the Swedish {{newspaper}} Aftonbladet, that Axl and he {{had spoken}} recently. This was considered a big news story because it was almost common knowledge {{that the two of}} them had not spoken together ever since he left the band in 1996. When asked about the re-connection with Rose, Slash commented [...] "It was probably way overdue". Rumors of a reunited Guns N' Roses started to pick up more and more during the fall of 2015. More reports came in claiming to have a confirmation that a reunion would happen, but no official statement was made during this period. One of the questions on people’s minds was if this was going to be a full reunion of the [...] "classic line-up" [...] or if it would be just one or two people from that line-up returning to the band. Steven Adler (the drummer from Guns N' Roses’ [...] "classic line-up") admitted during a radio interview with Eddie Trunk that he had not heard anything from Guns N' Roses about a reunion. Classic-era member Izzy Stradlin later confirmed to Rolling Stone that he will have no involvement with the new lineup. Former drummer Matt Sorum stated he was not asked to be part of the reunion, while departed guitarist Ashba claimed he was asked by Rose to be a part of the lineup but had turned it down, citing his commitment to Sixx:A.M. Stradlin explained his absence on the tour stating [...] "they didn't want to split the loot equally". Ultimately, long-time Chinese Democracy-era Members Richard Fortus and Frank Ferrer remained with the band to fill the rhythm guitarist and <b>drummer</b> <b>slots</b> respectively.|$|R
