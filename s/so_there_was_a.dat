5|$|Situated in the Burnden area of Bolton, {{approximately}} one {{mile from the}} centre of the town, the ground served as the home of the town's football team for 102 years. In its heyday, Burnden Park could hold up to 70,000 supporters but this figure was dramatically reduced during the final 20 years of its life. A section of The Embankment was sold off in 1986 {{to make way for a}} new Normid superstore. At this time, Bolton were in a dire position financially and were struggling in the Football League Third Division, <b>so</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> low demand for tickets and the loss of part of the ground gave the Bolton directors good value for money.|$|E
5|$|The ground has {{undergone}} several major changes since its original construction in 1905. The original Main Stand, boasting a press loft and a balcony above the roof, burnt down in 1921, {{and was replaced}} by the current stand before the 1922–23 campaign. The new Main Stand was split into two: the upper tier contained wooden seats, <b>so</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> ban on smoking in the stand; the lower tier, which became known as the Enclosure, was terracing.|$|E
5|$|With the {{retirement}} of Hassett following the 1953 England tour, the Australian captaincy was open for competition. No international cricket was scheduled until 1954–55, <b>so</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> full domestic season in 1953–54 for players to stake their claims. Morris started strongly with consecutive centuries against Queensland and South Australia, {{but was unable to}} maintain his form, passing fifty only twice in his remaining eight innings. He ended with 487 runs at 54.11 as New South Wales won the Sheffield Shield under Miller's leadership. Nevertheless, the Australian selectors indicated that they were considering Morris as a captaincy option by making him captain of Morris' XI, which played Hassett's XI in a testimonial match. Morris' XI won by 121 runs.|$|E

5|$|On 14 November 2007, it was {{announced}} that former EastEnders scriptwriter Tony Jordan had been contacted by Controller of BBC Drama Production John Yorke with an idea for an episode and that Jordan had returned to EastEnders having written the script for the episode. The single-hander episode {{was announced}} the next day, the first episode of any soap opera to feature just one character. Jordan had wanted to write a solo episode for EastEnders – well known for its two-hander episodes – for some time, but the opportunity had never arisen until Bardon had a stroke in real life, which was reflected in storyines when Jim was said to have suffered a stroke when visiting relatives off screen. Cast and crew were grateful for the opportunity to make the episode but were aware it had come about due to the suffering of somebody they loved. Brown was initially sceptical that her character could carry an entire episode by herself, but stated that Dot has a lot of history <b>so</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> lot to call upon.|$|E
5|$|The {{detailed}} {{design for the}} project was completed during summer 2006 and construction began in January 2007. The first task was to build a stable access road, but the moor was covered in a layer of peat with a low load-bearing capacity. The whole area had also been subjected to extensive coal mining during the 19th and early 20th centuries, <b>so</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> potential for subsidence. To address these problems, the mining voids were grouted and a floating road was constructed, using a complex system of geotextiles and geogrids to prevent the road from sinking. This was achieved by laying a crushed-gravel base, reinforced with polyester and polypropylene grids, to bridge any potential mine voids and ensure that the weak shear strength of the subsoil was exceeded by the base course material.|$|E

25|$|The {{light crude}} oil spilled in the Mega Borg {{incident}} was brown and evaporated much quicker than the {{heavy crude oil}} in spills such as the Exxon Valdez.

25|$|Yorkshire and Lancashire {{played two}} Roses Matches a season {{home and away}} in the County Championship. In 1993 the Championship was reduced so 18 teams would play each {{opponent}} once. For some seasons Yorkshire and Lancashire played an extra early season game to maintain home and away fixture. With a two division County Championship was introduced in 2000 with home and away games against each opponent which brought back two Roses Matches.

25|$|A Fistful of Dollars was an Italian/German/Spanish co-production, <b>so</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> {{significant}} {{language barrier}} on set. Leone {{did not speak}} English, and Eastwood communicated with the Italian cast and crew mostly through stuntman Benito Stefanelli, who also acted as an unlicensed interpreter for the production and would later appear in Leone's other pictures. Similar to other Italian films shot at the time, all footage was filmed silent, and the dialogue and sound effects were dubbed over in post-production. For the Italian version of the film, Eastwood was dubbed by stage and screen actor Enrico Maria Salerno, whose 'sinister' rendition of the Man with No Name's voice contrasted with Eastwood's cocksure and darkly humorous interpretation.|$|E

25|$|Huxley was {{certainly}} not slavish in his dealings with Darwin. As shown in every biography, they had quite different and rather complementary characters. Important also, Darwin was a field naturalist, but Huxley was an anatomist, <b>so</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> difference in their experience of nature. Lastly, Darwin's views on science were different from Huxley's views. For Darwin, natural selection {{was the best way}} to explain evolution because it explained a huge range of natural history facts and observations: it solved problems. Huxley, on the other hand, was an empiricist who trusted what he could see, and some things are not easily seen. With this in mind, one can appreciate the debate between them, Darwin writing his letters, Huxley never going quite so far as to say he thought Darwin was right.|$|E
25|$|There was {{no change}} {{after the first}} two matches as Gloucestershire beat Glamorgan in two days and Middlesex won the {{difficult}} encounter at Derby. It all went wrong for Gloucestershire at Dean Park, Bournemouth where stubborn Hampshire batting forced a draw while Middlesex were defeating Surrey with some ease. This gave Middlesex a twenty-point lead and only two matches each to be played. Middlesex's victory over the bottom team Northants settled it, especially as Gloucestershire surprisingly lost to Sussex by nine wickets. Even <b>so,</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> slight sting in the tail as Middlesex then lost their final match to a determined Lancashire by 64 runs while Gloucestershire rallied to defeat Essex. The final table showed Middlesex winning by twenty points, {{on the face of}} it a handsome margin, but in reality it was a much closer contest than the figures would suggest.|$|E
25|$|The post-war period saw a huge {{building}} boom in Palermo. Allied bombing in World War II had left more than 14,000 people homeless, and migrants were pouring {{in from the}} countryside, <b>so</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> huge demand for new homes. Much of this construction was subsidized by public money. In 1956, two Mafia-connected officials, Vito Ciancimino and Salvatore Lima, took control of Palermo's Office of Public Works. Between 1959 and 1963, about 80 percent of building permits were given to just five people, none of whom represented major construction firms and were probably Mafia frontmen. Construction companies unconnected with the Mafia were forced to pay protection money. Many buildings were illegally constructed before the city's planning was finalized. Mafiosi scared off anyone who dared to question the illegal building. The result of this unregulated building was the demolition of many historic buildings and the erection of apartment blocks, {{many of which were}} not up to standard.|$|E

25|$|Matthew Hayden and Justin Langer started positively, taking {{runs off}} the {{occasional}} bad balls that were served up by Harmison, Hoggard and Giles, {{and by the}} twelfth over they had racked up 47 for no loss, and were {{well on the way}} to chasing the target of 282. Then, Flintoff came and bowled the over of the series. He failed to make the hat-trick he was on from the last innings, but with his second ball he bowled Langer with a leg cutter. His third delivery was narrowly turned down for lbw, the fourth found Ponting's edge but failed to carry to slip, an lbw appeal on the fifth was also turned down, but his sixth which Ponting left outside the offstump was a no ball, <b>so</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> seventh and final delivery, another leg cutter and Ponting was out caught behind. Including the previous innings, Flintoff had taken four wickets in nine balls. But more importantly, Australia had been reduced from 47/0 to 48/2.|$|E
25|$|In 1905, King Alfonso XIII of Spain made an {{official}} state {{visit to the}} United Kingdom. Victoria Eugenie's uncle, King Edward VII, hosted a dinner in Buckingham Palace, in honour of the Spanish king. Alfonso was seated between Queen Alexandra and Princess Christian of Schleswig-Holstein, King Edward's sister. He noticed Victoria Eugenie and asked who the dinner guest with almost white hair was. Everybody knew that King Alfonso {{was looking for a}} suitable bride and one of the strongest candidates was Princess Patricia of Connaught, daughter of King Edward's brother, the Duke of Connaught. As Princess Patricia seemed not to be impressed by the Spanish monarch, Alfonso indulged his interest in Victoria Eugenie, and so the courtship began. When Alfonso returned to Spain he frequently sent postcards to Victoria Eugenie and spoke of her approvingly. His widowed mother, Queen Maria Cristina, did not like her son's choice, in part because she considered the Battenbergs non-royal because of the obscure origin of Prince Henry's mother, and in part because she wanted her son to marry within her own family, the Habsburgs from Austria. Another obstacle to a marriage was Victoria Eugenie's Protestantism (Alfonso was Roman Catholic; she was Anglican). Another potential problem was haemophilia, the disease that Victoria had transmitted to some of her descendants. Eugenie's brother Leopold was a haemophiliac, <b>so</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> 50% probability that Victoria Eugenie would be a carrier, although the degree of risk was not yet known. Still, if Alfonso married her, their issue could be affected by the disease. Nonetheless, Alfonso was not dissuaded.|$|E
25|$|By {{the early}} 1890s, the {{construction}} and expansion of rival cargo ports in the North West and {{the building of the}} Manchester Ship Canal heralded the decline of Fleetwood's prominence as a cargo port. However, at the same time this was more than offset by a period of rapid expansion of the fishing industry, signalled by the launch in 1891 of the first steam powered trawler, the Lark. All the other major fishing ports in Britain, Hull, Grimsby and Aberdeen, were on the east coast, <b>so</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> competitive advantage for a west-coast port with good rail links. By the start of the 20th century, Fleetwood's position as one of the three major fishing ports in England was cemented. James Marr brought a fleet of steam trawlers to Fleetwood and actively started to change the port by selectively fishing for hake, which until then had been treated as a much less desirable catch. Many of the houses in the old area of town around the Mount and Lord Street were built in the 1890s. In keeping with the thriving economy, these terraced houses were large for their era. An electric tramway link to Blackpool was constructed in the 1890s and remains operational to this day. The trams were routed along East Street and West Street (now Lord Street and North Albert Street) rather than Dock Street, and commercial trade followed, making those streets the commercial centre of the town. Fleetwood is the only town in Britain with trams running the full length of its main street, sharing road-space with cars. The docks were expanded in 1908 with the construction of the Fish Dock, accessible through Wyre Dock and still used today for the inshore fleet. Plans for a pier were first made in the 1890s but building did not start until 1909 and it was opened in 1910. It was the last new seaside pier to be built in the United Kingdom.|$|E
