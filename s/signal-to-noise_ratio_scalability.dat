40|$|Wireless {{networks}} typically {{suffer from}} packet loss and variable bit-rates due to bandwidth variations when, for example, video is transported between different devices in the home. Users {{who are watching}} video sent over wireless networks will therefore often experience jerkiness and blocking in the image. To intercept the effects caused by those problems, adaptation methods such as I-Frame Delay and <b>Signal-to-Noise</b> <b>Ratio</b> <b>scalability</b> were devised. To assess the perceived quality of MPEG- 2 video optimized by these adaptation methods, subjective tests were carried out. These tests demonstrate, amongst others, that scene content and duration of the quality loss affects the perceived quality. Furthermore, we observed a saturation effect.

Such an approach {{makes it possible to}} tackle the diversity of the current networks, terminals, and multimedia formats in a transparent way. This paper discusses the fundamentals of BFlavor, a novel language for describing the structure of binary multimedia resources. BFlavor has been developed to combine the strengths of MPEG- 21 BSDL and XFlavor and to avoid their weaknesses. The three different scalability axes of the H. 263 + coding format (i. e., temporal, spatial, and <b>Signal-to-Noise</b> <b>Ratio</b> <b>scalability)</b> are exploited by making use of MPEG- 21 BSDL, XFlavor, and BFlavor.

40|$|To {{interpret}} the impressions of observers, {{it is necessary}} to understand the relationship between components that influence perceived video quality. This paper addresses the effect of assessment methodology on the subjective judgement for spatial and temporal impaired video material, caused by video adaptation methods that come into play when there is variable throughput of video material (I-Frame Delay and <b>Signal-to-Noise</b> <b>Ratio</b> <b>scalability).</b> Judgement strategies used are the double-stimulus continuous-quality scale (DSCQS) and the double stimulus impairment scale (DSIS). Results show no evidence for an influence of spatial artifacts on perceived video quality with the presented judgement strategies. Results for the influence of temporal artifacts are less easy to interpret, because {{it is not possible to}} distinguish whether the non-linear relation between DSIS and DSCQS appeared because of the temporal artifacts themselves or presented scene content...|$|E

This paper {{presents the results of}} a transmission experiment of MPEG- 2 coded video data over a satellite link affected by noise, in order to investigate under which conditions this type of transmission is economically feasible. The <b>signal-to-noise</b> <b>ratio</b> <b>scalability</b> feature of the MPEG- 2 encoder was used to produce different bitstreams of the same movie sequence. The scope {{of the study was to}} verify which are the best combinations of video and channel codings in the presence of attenuation on the satellite link, in order to optimize the bandwidth utilisation for a requested image quality. The results obtained give indications about the data channel codings to be used to counter the rain fade on the transmission link, which is a non negligible problem especially when satellite transmissions are in the Ka band. Moreover, the results highlight the flexibility of the scalable video coding in the examined scenario...|$|E
