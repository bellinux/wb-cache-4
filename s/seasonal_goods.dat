40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{temporal}} stability of dichotomous choice (DC) contingent values and models and the implication of time related aspects for benefits transfer as a viable valuation method. From a practical point of view, time {{plays an important role}} in benefits transfer. Results are used from studies often carried out years ago and the obvious question is to what extent the estimated values and models stand the test of time. In the case of value function transfer, this implies testing the robustness of the estimated coefficient estimates over time. The novelty of the temporal stability work presented here is that two identical DC contingent valuation (CV) studies of the health risks associated with bathing water quality were carried out before and during extreme weather conditions causing the closure of bathing locations for public health reasons. Differences in contingent values and models before and during the extreme event are tested. The extreme event causes the <b>seasonal</b> <b>good</b> in question to become temporarily scarcer and marginal WTP is therefore expected to be higher during the extreme event than before, but not that underlying preferences have changed. Hence, basically two things are tested: the effect of time on stated preferences for a <b>seasonal</b> <b>good</b> and the effect of the extreme event on these preferences. WTP values before and during the event appear to be robust, also when accounting for substitution effects. The results before and during the extreme event remain transferable when accounting for theoretically expected factors in a simple multivariate transfer model. However, when introducing additional and contextual 'ad hoc' factors in the model, the estimated models and their random components become significantly different and hence not transferable, suggesting that unobserved preferences may not have been randomly distributed across the two surveys after all. © 2006 Elsevier B.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} production planning for a <b>seasonal</b> <b>good</b> which is produced in a multistage manner (e. g., when one or more components must be produced or purchased with a lead time that is long compared to the sales season). During the selling season, lost Bales occur if demand cannot be satisfied; {{at the end of}} the season, leftover inventory incurs the usual overage cost. As the season progresses, the forecast of total demand is revised in light of current sales. The problem is to determine production quantities of the various components and assemblies at each period to minimize expected costs of underage and overage. If delivery is not required until the end of the selling (or "order-taking") season, then a dynamic programming formulation can produce the optimal decision rule. However, for the case in which delivery is required during the season, the associated dynamic programming formulation is computationally infeasible. The paper explores four heuristics for the latter problem and compares their cost performance in a numerical example. The most sophisticated heuristic produces expected profits which range from 3. 2 % to 5. 5 % of an upper bound on expected profit. ...|$|R

30|$|Demand for {{the product}} in an {{industry}} depends on price, time, and performance quality with time. In general, increasing demand functions over time are exponential, stock-dependent, and etc. In the case of some products (e.g., new electronic chips, <b>seasonal</b> <b>goods,</b> new spare parts of machinery systems, etc.), the demand rate {{is likely to increase}} very fast, almost exponentially, with time. In addition, in the supermarket, we often see that large piles of goods displayed give the customer a wider selection of goods and increase the probability of making a sale. The effect of this dependence is that the retailers have incentive to keep higher levels of inventory in spite of higher holding costs as long as the item is profitable and the demand is an increasing function of the inventory level.|$|E

We also used sensitivity analysis to show effect of changes in total optimal cost per unit time to illustrate the model. We use such type of demand pattern in which <b>seasonal</b> <b>goods</b> come in market, demand of items increases with time and become constant, and decreases to zero or some constant limit.

The optimal control problem is addressed by means of the classical Pontryagin Maximum Principle and the solution can be easily found solving, in some cases numerically, a system of two non linear equations. Moreover, a para-metric analysis is performed to understand how the total expenditure in communication should be divided between advertising and sales pro-motion...|$|E

40|$|Many {{industries}} {{face the}} problem of selling a fixed stock of items over a finite horizon. These industries include airlines selling seats before planes depart, hotels renting rooms before midnight, theaters selling seats before curtain time, and retailers selling <b>seasonal</b> <b>goods</b> such as air-conditioners or winter coats {{before the end of}} the season. Given a fixed number of seats, rooms, or coats, the objective for these industries is to maximize revenues in excess of salvage value. When demand is price sensitive and stochastic, pricing is an effective tool to maximize revenues. In this paper we address {{the problem of}} deciding the optimal timing of a single price change from a given initial price to either a given lower or higher second price. Under mild conditions, we show that it is optimal to decrease (resp., to increase) the initial price as soon as the time-to-go falls below (resp., above) a time threshold that depends on the number of yet unsold items. dynamic pricing, yield management, stopping times, intensity control, martingales, finite horizon, optimal policies...|$|E
40|$|Firms in {{the retail}} {{industry}} have to face uncertainty in demand when pricing <b>seasonal</b> <b>goods</b> such as clothing and apparels. This optimization problem can be modeled as a risk-neutral monopoly facing a two-period stochastic demand, where period 1 indicates the regular season when a new product line is introduced and period 2 indicates an off-season when the price for the old product line is marked down for clearance. The firm determines period 1 price and total quantity supplied before either period, and determines period 2 price based on sales from period 1. The findings are: period 1 price always exceeds period 2 price; prices in both periods increase if pricing in period 1 lowers the uncertainty in period 2; and an inherent increase in uncertainty has ambiguous effect on period 1 price and tends to raise period 2 price. Empirical data confirms the first result, but cannot confirm or dispute the other two due to the inability to control for {{the differences in the}} expected demand function.

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a {{structural}} model of channel choice and product purchases, in which consumers base their channel choice decision {{on both the}} utility inherent in visiting a channel and the expected utility from purchasing products upon visiting. Specifically, we allow channels to have different abilities to resolve consumer uncertainty about product fit that varies by product category. We use this model to evaluate and predict the demand impact of retail entry for a <b>seasonal</b> <b>goods</b> provider that uses both retail and online channels to sell directly to consumers. Both online and retail sales will depend on retail outlet proximity through the rate of new customer arrivals and the shopping trip frequency of existing customers, as well the tradeoffs inherent in choosing between channel formats and the outside option. We find evidence of channel complementarity through increased arrivals of new customers and shopping frequency as the distance to retail outlets decreases. While {{the net effect of}} retail entry is demand-stimulative, we find these market expansion effects are partially offset by increased switching from online to retail formats in areas close to store locations.

40|$|Abstract⎯In many industries, sellers {{have the}} {{opportunity}} to enhance their revenues through the dynamic pricing of their perishable products such as flight seats, hotel rooms, or <b>seasonal</b> fashion <b>goods</b> that become worthless if they are not sold by a specific time. Therefore, how to dynamically adjust the prices of perishable products through differentiating the purchased time and the amount of unsold items to maximize the revenue is an important issue. Due to the immediate response and lower menu cost on the Internet, the application of the dynamic pricing to the Internet market is especially appropriate. In this paper we construct a dynamic pricing model for selling a given stock of identical perishable products over a finite time horizon on the Internet. We then propose three theorems to demonstrate the properties of the expected revenue and the time thresholds in the model.

40|$|We {{study the}} optimal pricing of a finite {{quantity}} of a fashion-like <b>seasonal</b> <b>good</b> {{in the presence}} of forward-looking (strategic) customers. We distinguish between two classes of pricing strategies: contingent and announced fixed-discount. In both cases, the seller acts as a Stackelberg leader announcing his pricing strategy, while consumers act as followers taking the seller's strategy as given and determining their purchasing behavior. In each case, we identify a subgame-perfect Nash equilibrium and show that given the seller's strategy, the equilibrium in the consumer subgame is unique and consists of symmetric threshold purchasing policies. For both cases, we develop a benchmark model in which customers are nonstrategic (myopic). We conduct a comprehensive numerical study to explore the impact of strategic consumer behavior on pricing policies and expected revenue performance. We show that strategic customer behavior suppresses the benefits of price segmentation, particularly under medium-to-high values of heterogeneity and modest rates of decline in valuations. However, when the level of consumer heterogeneity is small, the rate of decline is medium-to-high, and the seller can optimally choose the time of discount in advance, segmentation can be used quite effectively even with strategic consumers. We find that the seller cannot avoid the adverse impact of strategic consumer behavior even under low levels of initial inventory. We argue that while the seller expects customers to be more concerned about product availability at discount time, he cannot use high-price "betting" strategies as he would in the case of low inventory and myopic customers. Under certain qualifications, announced fixed-discount strategies perform essentially the same as contingent pricing policies in the case of myopic consumers. However, under strategic consumer behavior, announced pricing policies can be advantageous to the seller, compared to contingent pricing schemes. Interestingly, those cases that announced discount strategies offer a significant advantage compared to contingent pricing policies. They appear to offer only a minimal advantage in comparison to fixed-pricing policies. Finally, when the seller incorrectly assumes that strategic customers are myopic in their purchasing decisions, it can be quite costly, reaching potential revenue losses of about 20 %. dynamic pricing, game theory applications, marketing-operations interface, revenue management, strategic consumer behavior...|$|R
