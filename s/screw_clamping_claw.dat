50|$|<b>Screw</b> <b>clamps</b> {{consist of}} a {{galvanized}} or stainless steel band into which a screw thread pattern has been cut or pressed. One end of the band contains a captive <b>screw.</b> The <b>clamp</b> is put around the hose or tube to be connected, with the loose end being fed into a narrow space between the band and the captive screw. When the screw is turned, it acts as a worm drive pulling the threads of the band, causing the band to tighten around the hose (or when screwed the opposite direction, to loosen). <b>Screw</b> <b>clamps</b> are normally used for hoses 1/2 inch diameter and up, with other clamps used for smaller hoses.|$|R
50|$|Two-screw clamps still provide {{force on}} two sides (one dimension) only. Four (or more) <b>screw</b> <b>clamps</b> provide force on four (or more) sides, and thus two dimensions.|$|R
5000|$|The claw catcher {{features}} two <b>clamping</b> <b>claws</b> in {{the front}} that grab lava monsters and throw them into a water tank {{in the back of}} the vehicle. It includes Brains in a silver suit and an Infernox lava monster. This power miner vehicle is no. 15 ...|$|R
5000|$|Pairs of <b>screw</b> <b>clamps</b> {{on a short}} {{rubber tube}} form a [...] "no-hub band," [...] often used for {{attaching}} sections of domestic wastewater piping, or used for other pipes as a flexible coupler (to fix alignment difficulties or to prevent pipe breakage due to relative movement of sections) or an emergency repair.|$|R
50|$|In November 2009, Ferrari {{recalled}} about 2,400 1995-99 355s and 355F1s in the United States {{because of}} improperly placed <b>screw</b> <b>clamps</b> that could damage the fuel-supply pipes and allow fuel to leak into the engine compartment. Ferrari {{learned of the}} problem when it was sued over a fire involving an injury to a driver.|$|R
50|$|When a {{cable is}} {{terminated}} by a connector, the various wires {{in the cable}} are connected to contacts (pins) in the connector. The most common methods of connecting pins to individual wires are soldering, insulation displacement, insulation piercing, <b>screw</b> <b>clamping,</b> axial <b>screw</b> termination, cage <b>clamping,</b> crimping, press-in termination, and wire wrapping. Some of these wiring methods can be accomplished without specialized tools. Other methods, while requiring a special tool, can assemble connectors to a cable much faster and more reliably, and make repairs easier.|$|R
5000|$|A Ring clamp is {{an item of}} {{laboratory}} equipment which comprises a conjoined metal ring and radially-extending rod. In some cases, the rod terminates in a <b>screw</b> <b>clamp</b> for attachment to a retort stand or other support; in others, the rod may be attached to a stand {{by means of a}} laboratory clamp holder. Iron rings are commonly used in chemistry laboratories for supporting apparatus above the work surface, for example: ...|$|R

60|$|He {{brought forth}} two <b>screw</b> <b>clamps</b> and {{adjusted}} {{them to the}} double springs of the traps. By turning thumb-screws the springs were compressed and held so that the jaws of the trap could be opened and the pan set to hold them. The boys noticed that in doing this he worked from underneath, sure sign of the careful and experienced trapper. In the event of the clamps slipping {{there would be no}} chance of his hand or arm being caught in the jaws.|$|R
50|$|Unlike copper, {{aluminium}} has {{a tendency}} to creep or cold-flow under pressure, so older plain steel <b>screw</b> <b>clamped</b> connections could become loose over time. Newer electrical devices designed for aluminum conductors have features intended to compensate for this effect. Unlike copper, aluminium forms an insulating oxide layer on the surface. This is sometimes addressed by coating aluminium conductors with an antioxidant paste (containing zinc dust in a low-residue polybutene base) at joints, or by applying a mechanical termination designed to break through the oxide layer during installation.|$|R
5000|$|V-Blocks are {{precision}} metalworking jigs {{typically used}} to hold round metal rods or pipes for performing drilling or milling operations. They consist of a rectangular steel or cast iron block with a 90-degree channel rotated 45-degrees from the sides, forming a V-shaped channel in the top. A small groove is cut {{in the bottom of}} the [...] "V". They often come with <b>screw</b> <b>clamps</b> to hold the work. There are also versions with internal magnets for magnetic work-holding. V-blocks are usually sold in pairs.|$|R
50|$|A mounted or bar {{corkscrew}} is {{a device}} <b>screwed</b> or <b>clamped</b> {{to a wall}} or counter top, used to draw corks from beer, wine or other bottles.|$|R
50|$|Cable {{lighting}} is a variation where the fixtures are hung from uninsulated cables which carry low voltage. These fixtures {{range from the}} very simple, such as two hinged rods from which a halogen lamp hangs, to the very artful, such as a human silhouette whose feet touch the wires and hands hold the bulb or its socket. Two sets of cables (such as {{in the corner of}} a room where two walls meet) can be connected together with short wires that have clips (such as alligator clips or <b>screw</b> <b>clamps)</b> at either end.|$|R
50|$|Even though arca-type {{systems from}} various vendors are similar, {{variations}} do create some incompatibilities. The {{width of the}} mounting plates, {{as well as the}} depth and angle of the dovetails, can introduce such incompatibilities when mixing components from different brands. While the traditional <b>screw</b> <b>clamp</b> used to hold plates can accommodate various plate widths, some clamps use a lever-release, which has much lower tolerances. Often the lever-release clamps are only guaranteed to be compatible with plates from the same brand, though they are still considered to be arca-type, and often are compatible with other plates.|$|R
50|$|This {{weapon was}} the first modern {{railroad}} gun to enter service with the Heer. The gun was mounted on a simple pivot mount on a ballrace on a well-base flatcar with four outriggers. In action the outriggers and their jacks would be dropped to stabilize the gun and absorb the firing recoil. In addition jacks locked the spring suspension, bore {{on the surface of}} the rails and <b>screw</b> <b>clamps</b> gripped the rails for more stability. The elderly 15 cm Schnelladekanone L/40 was used because it was available in some numbers.|$|R
5000|$|Basic Erector parts {{included}} various metal beams with regularly-spaced {{holes for}} assembly using nuts and bolts. A frequently-promoted feature was {{the ability to}} fabricate a strong but hollow lightweight structural girder from four long flat pieces of stamped sheet steel, held together by bolts and nuts. Flat or curved pieces of sheet metal in various shapes and colors could {{be added to the}} structural skeleton. Hardened steel rods and <b>screw</b> <b>clamps</b> allowed the construction of hinges and the transmission of mechanical power via rotating parts such as pulleys, gears, wheels, and levers.|$|R
5000|$|Dry {{friction}} {{as used in}} wheel brakes, {{by using}} disks (classically made of leather) at the pivot of a lever, with friction forced by springs. Used in early automobiles such as the Ford Model T, up through some British cars of the 1940s. Although now considered obsolete, an advantage of this system is its mechanical simplicity; the degree of damping can be easily adjusted by tightening or loosening the <b>screw</b> <b>clamping</b> the disks, {{and it can be}} easily rebuilt with simple hand tools. A disadvantage is that the damping force tends not to increase with the speed of the vertical motion.|$|R
50|$|Camera {{equipment}} maker Arca-Swiss independently {{developed a}} quick-release system {{for use on}} their tripod heads. It is based on plates that are 38mm wide, and have a 45° dovetail, which is held into place on the receiver with a <b>screw</b> <b>clamp.</b> Starting in the 1990s, with the popularization of the Arca-Swiss B-1 ballhead, many other companies began producing plates and including Arca-Swiss style (sometimes referred to as arca-type) receivers on their tripod heads. Many other manufacturers now utilize this system, including Acratech, FEISOL, Giotto's, Kirk Photo, Really Right Stuff, Wimberley and others. Today most plates are machined aluminum which {{are attached to the}} cameras or lenses with a 1/4-20 hex screw.|$|R
50|$|A barb (or hose barb), which connects {{flexible}} hose or tubing to pipes, typically has a male-threaded end which mates with female threads. The {{other end of}} the fitting has a single- or multi-barbed tube—a long tapered cone with ridges, which is inserted into a {{flexible hose}}. An adjustable worm drive <b>screw</b> <b>clamp</b> (or other type of clamp) is often added, to keep the hose from slipping off the barbed tube. Barb fittings can be made of brass for hot-water applications, and plastic may be used for cold water; brass is considered more durable for heavy-duty use. The barb fitting may be elbow-shaped or straight.|$|R

50|$|A general type of {{connector}} {{that simply}} <b>screws</b> or <b>clamps</b> bare wire to a post; such connectors are frequently used in electronic test equipment and audio. Many, {{but not all}} binding posts will also accept a banana connector plug.|$|R
50|$|Twist-on {{connectors}} are {{not often}} used on wire gauges thicker than AWG #10 (5.26 mm²), because such solid wires are too stiff to be reliably connected with this method. Instead, set <b>screw</b> connectors, <b>clamps</b> or crimp connectors are used.|$|R
50|$|A {{challenge}} for mobility-impaired drivers is renting a vehicle when they travel. Organizations {{that specialize in}} adaptive tourism can assist in finding a vehicle, when possible. In New Zealand, Enable Tourism is an organization that helps drivers with disabilities to locate car rentals offering adapted cars or vans. In France, adapted cars with hand-controls are available from leading car rental businesses, however, it is advisable for drivers with disabilities to reserve a car {{well in advance of}} travelling. Several designs of portable push-pull hand-controls are also available which may be quickly connected to a new vehicle by <b>screwing</b> <b>clamps</b> to the pedals, however these may not be suitable for drivers with more extensive requirements.|$|R

50|$|Pipe vises are a plumber's tool, {{often used}} to hold pipes in place for {{threading}} and cutting. There are two main styles: chain and yoke. The yoke type vise uses a <b>screw</b> to <b>clamp</b> down the pipe, and the chain style uses a chain for securing the pipe.|$|R
50|$|The weights {{are either}} stone or metal, with {{a handle on}} top and often covered {{with a layer of}} food-neutral plastic. Another modern type of pickle press is usually made from plastic, and the {{necessary}} pressure is generated by turning a <b>screw</b> and <b>clamping</b> down onto the pickles.|$|R
50|$|Cables {{usually are}} secured with special {{fittings}} where they enter electrical apparatus; {{this may be}} a simple <b>screw</b> <b>clamp</b> for jacketed cables in a dry location, or a polymer-gasketed cable connector that mechanically engages the armour of an armoured cable and provides a water-resistant connection. Special cable fittings may be applied to prevent explosive gases from flowing in the interior of jacketed cables, where the cable passes through areas where flammable gases are present. To prevent loosening of the connections of individual conductors of a cable, cables must be supported near their entrance to devices and at regular intervals along their runs. In tall buildings, special designs are required to support the conductors of vertical runs of cable. Generally, only one cable per fitting is permitted, unless the fitting is rated or listed for multiple cables.|$|R
40|$|Correlations {{between local}} {{mechanical}} and metabolic events were studied during a partial decrease in {{flow in the}} left anterior descending coronary artery in 14 open-chest pigs. A decrease in flow to 28 % (19 - 39 %) of the control value was achieved with an adjustable <b>screw</b> <b>clamp.</b> A flow probe was placed around the artery. Blood samples {{were taken from the}} regional anterior coronary vein and the femoral artery- Myocardial wall thickening was measured with a harpoon type of mercury strain gauge. During ischemia, systolic myocardial wall thickening decreased to 44. 5 ± 5. 1 % (SE) of its control value (P *M (P < 0. 005), venous potassium concentration increased from 3. 77 ± 0. 10 IDM to 4. 08 ± 0. 13 mM (P < 0. 001), and venous lactate concentration increased from 1. 04 ± 0. 1...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY We {{investigated}} {{the relationship between}} regional myocardial blood flow (MBF) and segmental shortening in 17 open-chest dogs. The left anterior descending coronary artery was cannu-lated and perfused from the left carotid while measuring perfusion pressure. Graded occlusion was produced by a <b>screw</b> <b>clamp.</b> Extent of occlusion was monitored by perfusion pressure. Percent systolic shortening (%AL) was measured using ultrasonic crystals implanted in normal and ischemic endocar-dium and ischemic epicardium. MBF was measured in ischemic and normal endocardium and epicar-dium with tracer microspheres. Dogs underwent 1 to 4 grades of coronary stenosis. Myocardial blood flow both to endocardium and epicardium {{was found to be}} linearly related to diastolic perfusion pressure below 50 mmHg (r = 0. 803 and 0. 748, respectively). Normalized %AL (N%AL) was best related to fraction normal zone MBF in the endocardium by the sigmoidal equation, N%AL = e*...|$|R
50|$|In 1981, the McGuffins {{completed}} their first long distance journey together. They spent {{four and a}} half months backpacking the 2100 mile Appalachian Trail through 14 states from Georgia to Maine. Gary photographed their journey with a Pentax K1000 35mm camera and a 50mm lens. The only other photographic equipment he carried consisted of a tiny tripod which could be <b>screwed,</b> <b>clamped</b> or balanced on a variety of surfaces. With only seven rolls of 36-exposure Kodak slide film, Gary could only average 2 photographs a day to document the expedition. Using a system of small town post offices, they received new supplies and sent their photographs and writing journals back home. The long-distance journey confirmed their personal commitment to a life of exploration and adventure. The success of completing the Appalachian Trail led them dream bigger dreams together.|$|R
50|$|It may {{be noted}} that due to radial {{movement}} of the legs, plumb bob gets shifted {{in the direction of}} the movement of the leg without seriously affecting the level of the instrument. On the other hand, when the legs are moved side ways or circumferentially, the plumb does not shift much but the level gets affected. Sometimes, the instrument and the tripod have to be moved bodily for centring. It must {{be noted that}} the centering and leveling of instrument is done recursively. Finally, exact centring is done by using the shifting head of the instrument. During this, first the screw-clamping ring of the shifting head is loosened and the upper plate of the shifting head is slid over the lower one until the plumb bob is exactly over the station mark. After the exact centring, the <b>screw</b> <b>clamping</b> ring gets tightened.|$|R
50|$|Workmanship shall {{meet the}} {{applicable}} standards including T.O. 00-25-234 and shall {{be free of}} obvious physical defects. A unit that exhibits any sign that a part is stressed beyond its design limit (cracked circuit boards, loose connectors and/or <b>screws,</b> bent <b>clamps</b> and/or <b>screws,</b> worn parts, etc.) is considered to have failed even if the UUT passes the Functional Testing.|$|R
50|$|However, {{with the}} {{clamping}} plate type of screw terminal {{this time is}} reduced, since it is necessary only to insert the stripped wire between the terminal and the rear clamping plate then tighten the connection, using the <b>screw</b> to <b>clamp</b> the wire between the terminal and the clamping plate, without any need properly to wrap it around the screw head.|$|R
5000|$|This {{weapon was}} {{designed}} {{with the intent}} of replacing the 15 cm K (E) mounted on the same carriage, although only 6 were built before it was realized that both guns were too small to justify railroad mounts. The gun was mounted on a simple pivot mount on a ballrace on a well-base flatcar with four outriggers. In action the outriggers and their jacks would be dropped to stabilize the gun and absorb the firing recoil. In addition jacks locked the spring suspension, bore {{on the surface of the}} rails and <b>screw</b> <b>clamps</b> gripped the rails for more stability. The elderly 17 cm Schnelladekanone L/40 was used because it was available in some numbers, having been designed as the casemate gun for the [...] predreadnought battleships. It fired a 17 cm Sprgr L/4.7 KZ mit Hb shell weighing 62.8 kg. This was a standard HE shell with a nose fuze beneath a ballistic cap.|$|R
40|$|Electroporationis an {{effective}} method to deliver drugs into tumor cells to kill them, by applying a pulsed electric {{field to the}} cellular membrane [1, 2]. Existing electrodes consist of <b>clamping</b> <b>claws</b> or arrays of needles and can be effectively applied only to small areas. New electrodes that can treat large areas are sought; flexibility is needed to adapt to irregular tumor shape and, to be folded to enter from small surgical opening. In this work we present the design and test of a 16 cm 2 flexible electrode for electroporation with biosensing capabilities, built with standard flexible circuit technologies enclosed in a biocompatible package. The electrode contains electronics to provide cryptography-based identification to the electroporation machine to avoid setup errors and protection against use of counterfeited electrodes. In-vitro tests of the electrode show that electroporation occurs up {{to a depth of}} 8 mm with 100 % electroporation efficiency over the 30 % of electrode area. Temperature rise on the electrode during treatment does not exceed 6 degrees celsius, a value that not causes damage to the cells. © 2013 IEEE...|$|R
30|$|In addition, {{spinal cord}} {{function}} was clinically evaluated by observing {{the movements of}} the upper and lower limbs in response to <b>claw</b> <b>clamping</b> during temporarily reduced anesthesia. The muscular response was classified as follows: 0 = no movement, 1 = muscular movement, 2 = joint movement, 3 = normal movement; an additional score of 4 was attributed if spontaneous movement was present even without stimulation by <b>claw</b> <b>clamping.</b> The reaction was measured before clamping (measuring point, MP 1) and 1  h (MP 2), 2  h (MP 3), 4  h (MP 4), and 8  h (MP 5) after reperfusion. The reaction of the upper extremities was used to demonstrate the normal response.|$|R
