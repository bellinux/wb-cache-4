The goals of this thesis work are explained below. First of all, the design and realization of an experimental campaign of turning tests on a nickel base alloy of aeronautical interest (Inconel 718) was carried out in an industrial environment.

40|$|The present work {{approached}} {{the most relevant}} aspects in the development process of solar cells and modules based on amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) thin films. Since semiconductor characteristics determine the photovoltaic device performance, {{the first stage of}} this research was focused on the search for the correlation between deposition conditions and the optoelectronic properties of a-Si:H and a-SiC:H alloys (see chapter 3). The study allowed the finding of the conditions for the obtainment of good quality a-Si:H/a-SiC:H at low temperatures, compatible with the use of low-cost flexible substrates. After this step, the effort was reoriented to the preparation and characterisation of a-Si:H p-i-n solar cells. The fabrication process of these devices was optimised for the particular case of a dual-chamber PECVD. The design of the a-Si:H p-i-n structure was progressively improved at different deposition temperatures based on a detailed analysis of the optoelectronic behaviour of the resulting solar cell (<b>see</b> <b>section</b> <b>4.</b> <b>1).</b> For this purpose, the standard techniques for device characterisation were complemented with a new I-V curve measurement setup that uses LEDs as source of monochromatic light of variable intensity (<b>see</b> <b>section</b> 2. 3. 4). The result of this evolution was solar cells with efficiencies close to state-of-the-art, which showed good homogeneity and reproducibility. Once enough technological maturity was reached, the work was focused on the implementation of some of the concepts that make a-Si:H technology of interest to the photovoltaic industry. Specifically, different tests of monolithic interconnection of solar cells were carried out, which allowed the fabrication of the first a-Si:H modules entirely developed with Spanish technology (<b>see</b> <b>section</b> <b>4.</b> <b>1.</b> <b>4).</b> Subsequently, the work addressed the issue of cost reduction by means of substrates based on lower-price materials. Firstly, the effect on the device performance of the TCO material used as front electrode was analysed on glass substrates (<b>see</b> <b>section</b> 4. 2).

40|$|This {{dissertation}} investigates relative entropies, {{also called}} generalized divergences, {{and how they}} can be used to characterize information-theoretic tasks in quantum information theory. The main goal is to further refine characterizations of the optimal rates for quantum source coding, state redistribution, and measurement compression with quantum side information via second order asymptotic expansions and strong converse theorems. The dissertation consists of a mathematical and an information-theoretic part. In the mathematical part, we focus on the α-sandwiched Rényi divergence (α-SRD). We first investigate the limit α→ 0 to determine whether this recovers the well-known 0 -Rényi relative divergence. We then prove various new results for entropic quantities derived from the α-SRD, including dimension bounds and useful bounds in terms of the fidelity between two quantum states. Furthermore, we derive a necessary and sufficient algebraic condition for equality in the data processing inequality (viz. monotonicity under quantum operations) for the α-SRD, and give applications to entropic bounds. In the information-theoretic part, we first derive the second order asymptotics of visible quantum source coding using a mixed source. For the achievability part, we develop universal quantum source codes achieving a given second order rate for a memoryless source. As a corollary of the main result, we obtain the second order asymptotics of quantum source coding using a single memoryless source. We then prove strong converse theorems for state redistribution (with or without feedback) and measurement compression with quantum side information. The key ingredients in proving these theorems are the aforementioned fidelity bounds on Rényi entropic quantities derived from the α-SRD. Comment: 200 pages, 11 figures.

40|$|This article {{initiated}} an area {{of research}} called replica theory. The replica theory not only provided answers to questions {{in the field of}} spin glasses, but also provided answers for the problems with the analysis of neural networks. Replica theory was used, for example, to calculate the maximum number of stable patterns a certain pattern recognizing neural network can harbor (<b>see</b> <b>section</b> <b>1.</b> <b>4.</b> 3 on the Hopfield model). In the next chapter we will use replica theory extensively. Because most of the replica theory and applications were developed for use in the theory of spin glasses in the context of Ising models, we will often borrow notation and nomenclature from the spin glass models. We write as often the word spins as we use neurons, or we use the word couplings when we discuss the weights or synaptic strengths. We will never talk about thresholds, but always use the term external field. As the reader has noticed, we already have used the physical term temperature for the amount of errors neurons make in firing or in learning, although we did not immerse the neural network in a heat bath. And we used the physical concept of energy. All this is the heritage of spin glass theory. The model we construct and analyze in this thesis is inspired by neural networks and not on spin glasses.

Aerosol studies were conducted at the Paul Scherrer Institut Laboratory for Atmospheric Chemistry (PSI-LAC, Villigen, Switzerland) and at the Queensland University of Technology International Laboratory for Air Quality and Health (QUT-ILAQH, Brisbane, Australia). The primary measurement tool employed in this program was the Volatilisation and Hygroscopicity Tandem Differential Mobility Analyser (VHTDMA - Johnson et al. 2004). This system was initially developed at QUT within the ILAQH and was completely re-developed {{as part of this}} project (<b>see</b> <b>Section</b> <b>1.</b> <b>4</b> for a description of this process). The new VHTDMA was deployed to the PSI-LAC where an analysis of the volatile and hygroscopic properties of ammonium sulphate seeds coated with organic species formed from the photo-oxidation of á-pinene was conducted. This investigation was driven by a desire to understand the influence of atmospherically prevalent organics upon water uptake by material with cloud forming capabilities. Of particular note from this campaign were observed influences of partially soluble organic coatings upon inorganic ammonium sulphate seeds above and below their deliquescence relative humidity (DRH). Above the DRH of the seed increasing the volume fraction of the organic component was shown to reduce the water uptake of the mixed particle. Below the DRH the organic was shown to activate the water uptake of the seed. This was the first time this effect had been observed for á-pinene derived SOA. In contrast with the simulated aerosols generated at the PSI-LAC a case study of the volatile and hygroscopic properties of diesel emissions was undertaken. During this stage of the project ternary nucleation was shown, for the first time, {{to be one of the}} processes involved in formation of diesel particulate matter. Furthermore, these particles were shown to be coated with a volatile hydrophobic material which prevented the water uptake of the highly hygroscopic material below. This result was a first and indicated that previous studies into the hygroscopicity of diesel emission had erroneously reported the particles to be hydrophobic. Both of these results contradict the previously upheld Zdanovksii-Stokes-Robinson (ZSR) additive rule for water uptake by mixed species.

40|$|The Leray-Serre {{spectral}} {{sequence is}} a fundamental tool for studying singular homology of a fibration E->B with typical fiber F. It expresses H (E) in terms of H (B) and H (F). One of the classic examples of a fibration is given by the free loop space fibration, where the typical fiber is given by the based loop space. The {{first part of this}} thesis constructs the Leray-Serre spectral sequence in Morse homology on Hilbert manifolds under certain natural conditions, valid for instance for the free loop space fibration if the base is a closed manifold. We extend the approach of Hutchings which is restricted to closed manifolds. The spectral sequence might provide answers to questions involving closed geodesics, in particular to spectral invariants for the geodesic energy functional. Furthermore we discuss another example, the free loop space of a compact G-principal bundle, where G is a connected compact Lie group. Here we encounter an additional difficulty, namely the base manifold of the fiber bundle is infinite-dimensional. Furthermore, as H (P) = HF (T P) and H (Q) =HF (T Q), where HF denotes Floer homology for periodic orbits, the spectral sequence for P -> Q might provide a stepping stone towards a similar spectral sequence defined in purely Floer-theoretic terms, possibly even for more general symplectic quotients. Hutchings’ approach to the Leray-Serre spectral sequence in Morse homology couples a fiberwise negative gradient flow with a lifted negative gradient flow on the base. We study the Morse homology of a vector field that is not of gradient type. The central issue in the Hilbert manifold setting to be resolved is compactness of the involved moduli spaces. We overcome this difficulty by utilizing the special structure of the vector field. Compactness up to breaking of the corresponding moduli spaces is proved with the help of Gronwall-type estimates. Furthermore we point out and close gaps in the standard literature, <b>see</b> <b>Section</b> <b>1.</b> <b>4</b> for an overview. In the second part of this thesis we introduce a Lagrangian Floer homology on cotangent bundles with varying Lagrangian boundary condition. The corresponding complex allows us to obtain the Leray-Serre spectral sequence in Floer homology on the cotangent bundle of a closed manifold Q for Hamiltonians quadratic in the fiber directions. This corresponds to the free loop space fibration of a closed manifold of the first part. We expect applications to spectral invariants for the Hamiltonian action functional. The main idea is to study pairs of Morse trajectories on Q and Floer strips on T Q which are non-trivially coupled by moving Lagrangian boundary conditions. Again, compactness of the moduli spaces involved forms the central issue. A modification of the compactness proof of Abbondandolo-Schwarz {{along the lines of the}} Morse theory argument from the first part of the thesis can be utilized...|$|R
40|$|There are recent {{successes of}} {{automated}} deduction techniques in various application domains, such as mathematics, classical and nonmonotonic logics, diagnosis, planning and within software engineering. We will briefly review {{some of them}} and observe that these successes have been made only after a careful analysis of the application domain {{as well as the}} deduction system under consideration. The {{purpose of this article is}} to argue that automated deduction systems can be usefully applied in practice, but it is necessary to have available a variety of deduction methods, to understand their properties and their computational power in order to tailor them for the application under consideration. In the early days of automated deduction, research concentrated on the development of general purpose deduction systems. “Applications ” were toy examples, which did not scale up to realistically sized problems. Nowadays, the theorem prover community discovers applications again. The key to success quite often is the specific knowledge of the application domain which is used to optimise the deduction systems, i. e. the knowledge is used to guide the search for a proof or a model. Indeed, there are some recent impressive results which show that such deductive systems are even able to handle realistic problems.

No wonder that many academic and commercial projects are aimed at producing tools that detect classes of memory cleanness problems (<b>see</b> <b>Section</b> <b>4.</b> <b>1).</b> This paper {{does not intend to}} introduce another shape analysis or pointer analysis algorithms. Instead, we focus on detecting clea [...] ...|$|R

We cover our smooth affine C with affines B each of which is finite, tale over a localization of a polynomial algebra. For these particular affines, we decompose WttQ into an integral part and a fractional part and then show that the integral part is isomorphic to the Monsky-Washnitzer complex and that the fractional part is acyclic.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} we study at a {{concrete}} practical level how computation with action potentials (spikes) can be performed. We {{address the problem}} of pro- gramming a dynamical system modeled as a neural network and considering both, hardware and software implementations. For this, we use a discrete- time spiking neuron model, which has been introduced in Soula et al. (2006), and called BMS in the sequel, whose dynamics is rather rich (<b>see</b> <b>section</b> <b>1.</b> 2. <b>4).</b> On one hand, we propose an efficient method to properly estimate the parameters (delayed synaptic weights) of a neural network from the observa- tion of its spiking dynamics. The idea is to avoid the underlying NP-complete problem (when both weights and inter-neural transmission delays are con- sidered in the parameters estimation). So far, our method defines a Linear Programming (LP) system to perform the parameters estimation. Another aspect considered {{in this part of the}} work is the fact that we include a reser- voir computing mechanism (hidden network), which permits us, as we show, to increase the computational power and to add robustness in the system. Furthermore these ideas are applied to implement input-output transforma- tions, with a method learning the implicit parameters of the corresponding transfer function. On the other hand we have worked on the development of numerical implementations permitting us to validate our algorithms. We also made contributions to code methods for spike trains statistics analysis and simu- lations of spiking neural networks. Thus, we co-develop a C++ library, called EnaS, which is distributed under the CeCILL-C free license. This library is also compatible with other simulators and could be used as a plugin. Finally we consider the emergent field of bio-inspired hardware im- plementations, where FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) and GPU (Graphic Processing Unit) technologies are studied. In this sense, we evalu- ate the hardware implementations of the proposed neuron models (gIF-type neuron models) under periodic and chaotic activity regimes. The FPGA- based implementation has been achieved using a precision analysis and its performance compared with that based on GPU...|$|R
30|$|The Dance-the-Music {{facilitates}} {{to instruct}} dance gestures to dance novices {{with the help}} of an interactive visual monitoring aid (<b>see</b> <b>Sections</b> 3.4. <b>1</b> and <b>4).</b> Concerning the visualization of basic step models, we take into account two aspects involving the perception and understanding of complex multimodal events, like dance figures. First, research has shown that segmentation of ongoing activity into smaller units is an automatic component of human perception and functional for memory and learning processes [1, 15]. For this, we applied algorithms that segment the continuous stream of motion information into a concatenation of elementary gestures (i.e., dance steps) matching the beat pattern in the music (cf., [6]). Each of these gestures is conceived as a separate unit, having a fixed start- and endpoint. Second, neurological findings indicate that motor representations based on first-person perspective action involve, in relation to a third-person perspective, more kinesthetic components and take less time to initiate the same movement in the observer [16]. Although applications in the field of dance gaming and education often enable a manual adaptation of the viewpoint perspective, they do not follow automatically when users rotate their body during dance activity [17 – 20]. In contrast, the visual monitoring aid of the Dance-the-Music automatically adapts the viewpoint perspective in function of the rotation of the user at any moment.|$|R
40|$|PROTHEGO (PROTection of European Cultural HEritage from GeO-hazards) is a {{collaborative}} research project funded in 2015 – 2018 {{in the framework}} of the Joint Programming Initiative on Cultural Heritage and Global Change (JPI-CH) – Heritage Plus. The project aims to make an innovative contribution towards the analysis of geohazards in areas of cultural heritage, and uses novel space technology based on radar interferometry (InSAR) to retrieve information on ground stability and motion in the 400 + UNESCO's World Heritage List monuments and sites of Europe. Dissemination and communication are central to the success of PROTHEGO, and are embedded into its WP 7, which runs throughout the whole lifetime of the project under the leadership of NERC. This report outlines the strategy that NERC in collaboration with ISPRA, CUT, UNIMIB and IGME designed to disseminate PROTHEGO’s objectives, methodologies and achievements and to engage stakeholders and heritage practitioners to maximise the impact of the project. Several dissemination tools are used to achieve PROTHEGO’s dissemination goals, including the development of the project branding (<b>see</b> <b>sections</b> 2. <b>1.</b> 1 and 2. 1. 2), a dedicated website (<b>see</b> <b>section</b> 2. <b>1.</b> <b>4),</b> project leaflets and brochures (<b>see</b> <b>section</b> 2. <b>1.</b> 3). A publication plan is in place with associated scenarios (<b>see</b> <b>sections</b> 2. 2. <b>1</b> and 2. 2. 2) to publicise the project and its results at both national and international level. An internal approval process and copyright responsibilities are identified in line with the Consortium Agreement (<b>see</b> <b>section</b> 2. 2. 3). A record of dissemination activities undertaken by Project Partners and Associate Partners (Table 6) is kept via the List of Outputs (<b>see</b> <b>section</b> 2. 2. 4 and Appendix A). Deliverables with public (PU) dissemination level (as defined in the Description of Work) are made freely available to stakeholders and the public via the project website. Restricted (PP) dissemination level deliverables are stored in the password-protected file sharing platform only for internal use to the Project Partners and the JPI-CH Heritage Plus Coordinator (<b>see</b> <b>section</b> 2. 2. 5). PROTHEGO will capture the needs and requirements of end-users and stakeholders, inform them about the project activities and outputs, and engage them {{from the very beginning of}} the project. This will be achieved through stakeholder-focussed workshops and activities: (i) Initial Consultation Workshop (<b>see</b> <b>section</b> 3. 1); (ii) Public Consultation via Online Survey (<b>see</b> <b>section</b> 3. 2); (iii) Stakeholder and User Workshop (<b>see</b> <b>section</b> 3. 3); and (iv) Final PROTHEGO Workshop (<b>see</b> <b>section</b> 3. 4). These workshops and activities will allow PROTHEGO to tailor its project outcomes and results to the stakeholders’ needs, to maximise the impact of the project and transfer its research outcomes to the heritage sector, policy makers and the general public...|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanical}} properties of metal foams (and other cellular solids) {{depend on the}} properties of the metal that they are made from, on their relative density, and on the cell topology (i. e., cell size, cell shape, open or closed cell morphology, etc.). The cell size of commercially available metal foams is about 1 to 10 mm. This is on the order of the smallest structural length of specimens in many applications. In such cases, the individual response to a load differs significantly from one cell to another, and the fundamental assumption of the classical continuum theory that the (physical, chemical, mechanical, etc.) properties of a material are uniformly distributed throughout its volume fails. Another situation where the classical continuum theory loses its accuracy is when the characteristic wavelength of loading is comparable to the cell size. An important technological consequence of this is the occurrence of size effects. The term "size effect" designates the effect of the macroscopic (sample) size, relative to the cell size, on the mechanical behaviour. In the last decade evidence of this appeared in a number of experimental studies (<b>see</b> <b>section</b> <b>1.</b> <b>4).</b> To theoretically account for size effects, one may take the cellular morphology into account by discretely modelling each cell wall and/or cell face. This allows for an accurate representation of the microstructural deformation mechanisms, the bending and stretching of cell walls and faces. Such a microstructural model can predict how the overall (macroscopic) response is related to the microstructural parameters. In view of size effects, the most important feature is that it incorporates, in a physically sound manner, the material length scale in the problem, i. e. the cell size. However, such a discrete model can become computationally expensive for complex (random) microstructures, especially in three dimensions. Another approach is to use a generalized continuum theory in which many microstructural details are averaged out, but in which a "characteristic" length scale is retained. The goal of this thesis is twofold: 1) To explore the physical mechanisms that are responsible for the size-dependent elastic behaviour of cellular solids by using a discrete microstructural model. 2) To assess the capability of generalized continuum theories to capture size effects through a careful comparison with the discrete simulations. The first chapter thesis introduces the experimental evidence for the size effects, and gives an historical overview of the generalized continuum theories used to model these size effects. In chapter 2, we use two-dimensional beam networks to mimic real (three-dimensional) foams, which allow us to account for the discreteness of their microstructure. We perform simple shear, uniaxial compression, and pure bending tests on a large variety of samples, and calculate the change in the macroscopic {{mechanical properties}} corresponding to a change in size. We close the chapter with a summary of the size effects that we observed in our calculations and discuss the possible mechanisms behind these size effects. Chapter 3 uses the micropolar theory to capture the size effects observed in chapter 2. We fit the elastic constants of the micropolar continuum theory by comparing the analytical solution of the simple shear problem with the discrete analyses, in terms of the best agreement in the macroscopic shear stiffness of the samples. We develop a strain mapping procedure and evaluate the performance of the fitted micropolar constants in predicting the local deformation fields, the microrotations and shear strains. Finally, we solve the pure bending problem analytically for the micropolar theory and close the chapter with a discussion on the limitations of the Cosserat-type theories. In chapter 4, we propose a generalized continuum theory (strain divergence theory), which associates energy to the divergence of strain. We derive the equilibrium equations and the boundary conditions for the strain divergence continuum, and develop a finite element implementation of the theory. We solve the simple shear and the pure bending problems analytically and compare the solutions with the discrete calculations, {{as well as with the}} analytical solutions for the couple stress theory. Chapter 5 explores the strain concentration problem around a cylindrical hole in a field of uniaxial tension. First, we perform discrete calculations on samples with different hole sizes and show the effect of the hole size on the strain distribution near the hole. Then we compare the discrete analyses with the analytical solutions for the classical, couple stress and strain divergence theories. Finally, in Chapter 6, we summarize the size effects that we observed in the mechanical behaviour of the two dimensional cellular solids, and we compare the different generalized continuum theories with respect to their ability in capturing size effects. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We study a moduli {{space of}} ASD {{connections}} over S 3 × R. We consider not only finite energy ASD connections but also infinite energy ones. So the moduli space is infinite dimensional in general. We study the (local) mean dimension of this infinite dimensional moduli space. We show the {{upper bound on}} the mean dimension by using a “Runge-approximation ” for ASD connections, and we prove its lower bound by constructing an infinite dimensional deformation theory of periodic ASD connections. 1. introduction Since Donaldson [4] discovered his revolutionary theory, many mathematicians have intensively studied the Yang-Mills gauge theory. There are several astonishing results on the structures of the ASD moduli spaces and their applications. But most of them study only finite energy ASD connections and their finite dimensional moduli spaces. Almost nothing is known about infinite energy ASD connections and their infinite dimensional moduli spaces. (One of the authors struggled to open the way to this direction in [19, 20].) This paper studies an infinite dimensional moduli space coming from the Yang-Mills theory over S 3 × R. Our main purposes are to prove estimates on its “mean dimension” (Gromov [12]) and {{to show that there}} certainly exists a non-trivial structure in this infinite dimensional moduli space. (Mean dimension is a “dimension of an infinite dimensional space averaged by a group action”.) The reason why we consider S 3 × R is that {{it is one of the}} simplest non-compact antiself-dual 4 -manifolds of (uniformly) positive scalar curvature. (Indeed it is conformally flat.) These metrical conditions are used via the Weitzenböck formula (<b>see</b> <b>Section</b> <b>4.</b> <b>1).</b> Recall that one of the important results of the pioneering work of Atiyah-Hitchin-Singer [1, Theorem 6. 1] is the calculation of the dimension of the moduli space of (irreducible) self-dual connections over a compact self-dual 4 -manifold of positive scalar curvature. So our work is an attempt to develop an infinite dimensional analogue of [1, Theorem 6. 1]...|$|R
40|$|Dried {{vine fruit}} farms in Sunraysia and Robinvale were nearly all {{established}} under closer settlement schemes, with farm size averaging about 8 hectares. The present {{study indicates that}} economics of size exist up to a harvested area of about 25 hectares. This would suggest that structural change is occurring in the industry, with farms being amalgamated {{to take advantage of}} these economies of size. However, structural change {{in recent years has been}} negligible. Some of the obstacles to adjustment are examined in the thesis. They have important implications for government policy; in particular, there is a need for a Land Authority to facilitate adjustment in dried vine fruit growing regions. The thesis also considers some methodological problems in estimating economies of size, and in deriving policy proposals from such estimates. It concludes that the results of most studies of farm size, including this one, must he regarded as provisional, pending the outcome of properly designed empirical tests. It also concludes that the Paretian concept of efficiency is inadequate as a framework for adjustment policy. I would like to thank my supervisors,Mr. G. W. Edwards, Mr. N. H. Sturgess, and Dr. A. S.
