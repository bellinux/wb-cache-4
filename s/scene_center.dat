40|$|Abstract — Magnification {{around the}} most {{important}} point of the <b>scene</b> (<b>center</b> of interest- COI) might be an effective aid for people with vision impairments that cause resolution loss. This requires that a COI exist for most video frames. Operationally, we defined the COI by recording the eye movements of normallysighted subjects as they watched movies. Here we report the frequency that people looked {{at the same place}} during the movies and the spatial distribution of their COIs, and investigate age and gender differences...|$|E
30|$|From {{all these}} results, {{we can tell}} that with the {{increasing}} of {{the distance from the}} position of the target to the <b>scene</b> <b>center</b> in the range direction, the focusing quality degrades dramatically by using the MSR-based chirp-scaling algorithm, while satisfying results can be obtained by using the proposed one. The reason for this phenomenon {{lies in the fact that}} the proposed chirp-scaling algorithm is based on an exact analytical bistatic PT spectrum, while the one based on the MSR spectrum is an approximate one. Although the MSR spectrum is a spectrum with high precision, it is still an approximation to some extent.|$|E

30|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a new approach}} for the squint-mode spotlight SAR imaging. Like the frequency scaling algorithm, this method starts with the received signal dechirped in range. According to the geometry for the squint mode, the reference range of the dechirping function {{is defined as the}} range between the <b>scene</b> <b>center</b> and the synthetic aperture center. In our work, the residual video phase is compensated firstly to facilitate the following processing. Then the range-cell migration with a high-order range-azimuth coupling form is processed by a nonlinear frequency scaling operation, which is different from the original frequency scaling one. Due to these improvements, the algorithm can be used to process high squint SAR data with a wide swath and a high resolution. In addition, some simulation results are given {{at the end of this}} paper to demonstrate the validity of the proposed method.|$|E
40|$|Bistatic {{synthetic}} aperture radar (SAR) enables high resolution imaging in forward direction of a moving receiver, if {{the motion of the}} transmitter guarantees an adequate aspect angle variation with respect to the <b>scene</b> <b>center.</b> Such a configuration could be realized at an airport, where a ground-based transmitter illuminates the runway and the receiver on board an aircraft receives the reflected signals and provides the pilot with a high-resolution radar image of the runway. The situational awareness and the safety of approaching aircrafts in conditions of low visibility could be increased using such a system. A big challenge is the time and phase synchronization of the transmitter and receiver for coherent processing. The synchronization method as well as the hardware setup of the ground-based transmitter and the compact X-band receiver are presented in this paper. Several experiments to demonstrate the feasibility of imaging a runway during the landing approach were performed using a receiver on board an ultralight aircraft and a transmitter on a moving truck to illuminate the runway. First image results are presented...|$|E

40|$|Unlike {{previous}} spaceborne Earth observing sensors, the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) employs onboard sample aggregation {{to reduce}} downlink bandwidth requirements and preserve spatial resolution across the scan. To examine the potentially deleterious impacts of onboard sample aggregation when encountering detector saturation, nearly {{four months of}} the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Nightfire product are analyzed, which contains {{a subset of the}} hottest observed nighttime pixels. An empirical method for identifying saturation is devised. The M 12 band (3. 69 μm) is the most frequently saturating band with 0. 15 % of the Nightfire pixels at or near the ~ 359 -K detector saturation limit; some saturation is also found in M 14, M 15, and M 16 (8. 58, 10. 74, and 11. 86 μm). Artifacts consistent with detector saturation are seen with M 12 temperatures as low as 330 K in the <b>scene</b> <b>center.</b> This partial saturation and aggregation influence must be considered when using VIIRS radiances for quantitative characterization of hot emission sources such as fires and gas flaring...|$|E

(right) The same visualization for our new algorithm. The dark blue color corresponds to zero traversal steps, dark red corresponds to 255 or more traversal steps per ray. Note that the new algorithm significantly reduces the number of traversals per ray. We present a new method for ray tracing acceleration by modification of current spatial data structures. We augment a spatial hierarchy such as kd-tree with sparsely distributed bounding boxes that are linked from bottom to top. The augmented data structures {{can be viewed as a}} hybrid between kd-trees and uniform grids. The augmentation by boxes is used in new traversal algorithms, which are not restricted to start the hierarchy traversal at the root node. This is in particular efficient for short rays where we significantly reduce the number of traversal steps through the hierarchy. Further we make use of ray coherence as well as explicit knowledge of ray distribution and initiate the traversal near the leaf nodes where the intersection is expected...|$|E
30|$|There {{is a good}} spatial {{correlation}} between the range shortening area (warm-colored area) and the mountainous area (Figure  2). In particular, the relationship is obvious in the area from the coast to the north-facing slope of the mountain (lines 1 and 2 in Figure  4). The {{correlation between}} the two caused us {{to think about the}} landform evolution and whether the spatial correlation could be true. As mentioned in Section Methods, we applied an elevation-dependent correction to reduce the artifact displacement correlating with elevation, but the correction was often insufficient because of the large amount of topographic relief and the accuracy of the DEM data [13]. Thus, we had to consider carefully whether or not the spatial correlation is true. We here confirmed the potential error caused by the topography. For the SAR data pair that we analyzed, the perpendicular baseline of satellite orbit was estimated to be approximately − 47  m at the <b>scene</b> <b>center.</b> In this case, the artifact, calculated using a formulation presented by Kobayashi et al. [26], should be at most 8  cm at the elevation of 500  m. Thus, we concluded that the error produced by the topographic effect can be ignored in this analysis.|$|E

40|$|Interferometric SAR is an {{emerging}} earth observation technique, especially useful in cartography and surface subsidence survey, Differential SAR Interferometry (DInSAR) provides an alternative and complementary method {{to investigate the}} land subsidence phenomena, which can provide two dimensional deformations on the line of sight (LOS) of radar on areas of thousands square kilometers. In order to obtain accurate surface subsidence, precise orbit must be provided so as to compensate the reference surface phase and topographic phase. This paper proposed a new method for SAR interferometric baseline rectification specifically for SAR satellites those have no precise orbits. The method based on the imaging geometry of interferometric SAR, during the processing we setup a coordinate system called RXA, where R is a vector directing from the <b>scene</b> <b>center</b> to the corresponding position on the orbit, A is the vector of satellite velocity, X is normal to both R and A to construct a right hand coordinate system. There are two steps in our baseline rectification process, which are perpendicular baseline rectification and parallel baseline rectification, and the singular value of phase frequency was removed by the DIA method. In our study two InSAR pairs are processed, the results show the new proposed method could compensate not only the linear part of the orbit error but also nonlinear part of the orbit error...|$|E
40|$|High Altitude Pseudo-Satellites (HAPS) are future {{platforms}} {{flying in}} the stratosphere. Owing to the expected long endurance, missions lasting for several weeks, {{months or even years}} are possible. This property makes HAPS very attractive as carrier platforms for remote sensing instruments. HAPS allow for short revisiting times or even for continuous observations, e. g., by performing circular flight tracks over the region of interest. Such an operating mode is not feasible with satellites and is also not realizable economically with state-of-the-art aircraft platforms over longer time frames. We focus on a synthetic aperture radar (SAR) as HAPS payload. The SAR principle ensures high resolution down to the sub-meter range independently from the flight altitude, weather conditions and sunlight illumination. Due to the side-looking radar imaging geometry also hazard areas can be monitored safely since the platform is not only separated in altitude, but additionally separated horizontally several kilometers far away from the <b>scene</b> <b>center.</b> In 2015 we have carried out a study for Airbus Defence and Space to investigate if it is feasible to bring and operate a SAR sensor on their solar-powered Zephyr HAPS platform. In the study we found that the two main platform restrictions, the limited payload weight and the limited available electrical power, can be overcome. For instance, a peak transmit power of 50 W at a duty cycle of 20...|$|E
40|$|In daily life, we are {{surrounded}} by objects with pre-existing motivational associations. However, these are rarely controlled for in experiments with natural stimuli. Research on natural stimuli would therefore benefit from stimuli with well-defined motivational properties; in turn, such stimuli also open new paths in research on motivation. Here we introduce a database of Motivational Objects in Natural Scenes (MONS). The database consists of 107 scenes. Each scene contains 2 to 7 objects placed at approximately equal distance from the <b>scene</b> <b>center.</b> Each scene was photographed creating 3 versions, with one object (“critical object”) being replaced to vary the overall motivational value of the scene (appetitive, aversive, and neutral), while maintaining high visual similarity between the three versions. Ratings on motivation, valence, arousal and recognizability were obtained using internet-based questionnaires. Since the main objective was to provide stimuli of well-defined motivational value, three motivation scales were used: (1) Desire to own the object; (2) Approach/Avoid; (3) Desire {{to interact with the}} object. Three sets of ratings were obtained in independent sets of observers: for all 805 objects presented on a neutral background, for 321 critical objects presented in their scene context, and for the entire scenes. On the basis of the motivational ratings, objects were subdivided into aversive, neutral, and appetitive categories. The MONS database will provide a standardized basis for future studies on motivational value under realistic conditions...|$|E
