Other arrivals included former Manchester City teammate Billy McAdams, forward Ian Lawson and left-back Cliff Mason.

Leeds pushed for promotion in 1962–63, but the harsh winter caused many postponements and a backlog of games {{at the end of the}} season proved too much for Leeds, who fell away to finish in fifth place.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} Mansur's Fatimid {{reinforcements}} arrived in Aleppo, Abu'l-Hayja' and the Kilab {{had reached the}} city's outskirts. The Fatimid troops marched toward Abu'l-Hayja's camp, after which the Kilab, having secretly agreed to Mansur's offer, abandoned Abu'l-Hayja'. The latter then fled back to Byzantine territory. Basil II at first refused to once again grant asylum to the Hamdanid, but Mansur persuaded him to keep Abu'l-Hayja' under virtual house arrest in the Byzantine capital, Constantinople. Meanwhile, Mansur did not abide by his promise to al-Hakim, who responded by sending an army from Cairo {{with the aim of}} replacing Mansur with the Hamdanid emir Abu al-Ma'ali Sharif. This army made it to Ma'arrat al-Nu'man, in Aleppo's countryside, in 1011, but retreated after encountering resistance by the Kilab, who attempted to kidnap Abu al-Ma'ali Sharif and <b>sell</b> <b>him</b> to Mansur.|$|E

5|$|He {{started his}} {{professional}} career at Hartlepool United in February 1978, {{after failing to}} win a contract at Chesterfield. He was coached by Billy Horner to become a strong centre-forward, using his natural strength and power to retain possession in attacking positions. Financial difficulties forced the club to <b>sell</b> <b>him</b> on to Leyton Orient for £25,000 in March 1982. After failing to impress in his two years in London, he was moved on to York City for £15,000 in March 1984. He played seven games in the club's Fourth Division title winning season in 1983–84, before transferring to Scunthorpe United for £40,000 in March 1986.

5|$|After enjoying life as {{a billionaire}} for a few days, Homer decides to throw a party before Burns returns. He heads to Moe's Tavern to buy some beer and invite his friends to the party. However, Moe informs Homer {{that he can not}} <b>sell</b> <b>him</b> alcohol on account of it being Sunday before 2:00 PM. After Homer is told {{the only way he could}} buy alcohol would be to sail out to {{international}} waters where there are no laws, he and his friends (including his son Bart) set sail in Burns' private yacht to throw the party there. Back at the Mayo Clinic, Burns discovers that he not only has all previously discovered diseases, but numerous new diseases the doctors have just discovered in him. However, the sheer number of diseases prevents any one disease from actually doing harm to him. This leads Burns to (incorrectly) conclude that he is indestructible, even though the doctors protest that even a slight breeze could disrupt the balance in his body.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the 1986–87 season, Rush {{announced}} his intention to leave Liverpool for Italian team Juventus when the season was finished. Rush did not want to leave but the club decided to <b>sell</b> <b>him,</b> as they were short of money due to their expulsion from European competition. Midway through the season, Dalglish signed John Aldridge to replace Rush when he left. Prior to his departure, Rush scored 40 goals. Liverpool finished second in the league behind Everton, and were knocked out of the FA Cup in the third round by Luton Town. The club did reach the 1987 Football League Cup Final, but they were beaten 2–1 by Arsenal. At the end of the season, Dalglish signed Peter Beardsley and John Barnes to improve their attack. Liverpool regained the league championship; they did not suffer defeat until their 29th match against Everton, one of two losses during the season. The club had the chance to complete the double, as they reached the final of the FA Cup against Wimbledon. Although favourites against a club who had only {{become a member of the}} Football League eleven years previously, they lost the match 1–0.|$|E
5|$|Born {{and raised}} in Acton, west London, Friday was scouted, but not retained, by four {{professional}} clubs during his teenage years. He appeared for local semi-professional sides in the Isthmian League until he joined Charlie Hurley's Fourth Division Reading team in 1974—quickly becoming a key player, he helped Reading to win promotion to the Third Division during the 1975–76 season. As his drug habit intensified, Friday's form began to dip {{in the first half}} of the 1976–77 season, leading Reading to <b>sell</b> <b>him</b> to Second Division side Cardiff City around the New Year. Friday travelled to join his new team by train without a valid ticket and had to be bailed by the Cardiff manager Jimmy Andrews before he signed for the club. He performed strongly on his debut, but afterwards his form declined and his personal life caused him to repeatedly miss matches altogether. Following a number of incidents, on and off the field—including kicking Mark Lawrenson in the face —Friday retired from football in December 1977, aged 25. He died in Acton in 1990, aged 38, after suffering a heart attack.|$|E

5|$|Mansfield is {{best known}} for his {{judgment}} in Somersett's Case on the legality of keeping slaves in England. The English had been involved in the slave trade since 1553, and by 1768, ships registered in Liverpool, Bristol and London carried more than half the slaves shipped in the world. James Somersett was a slave owned by Charles Stewart, an American customs officer who sailed to Britain for business, landing on 10 November 1769. A few days later Somersett attempted to escape. He was recaptured in November and imprisoned on the ship Ann and Mary, owned by Captain John Knowles and bound for the British colony of Jamaica. Stewart intended to <b>sell</b> <b>him</b> there. However, three people claiming to be Somersett's godparents, John Marlow, Thomas Walkin and Elizabeth Cade, made an application before the Court of King's Bench for a writ of habeas corpus, and Captain Knowles was ordered to produce Somersett before the Court of King's Bench, which would determine whether his imprisonment was legal.|$|E
5|$|Ryder {{is sought}} after by the town's women but begins courting a very light mixed-race woman from Washington, DC named Molly Dixon. He plans to propose {{to her at}} the next Blue Vein ball, for which he is giving a speech. Before the talk, he meets an older, plain-looking black woman. Her name is 'Liza Jane, and she is searching for her husband Sam Taylor, whom she has not seen in 25 years. She says she was married to Sam before the Civil War, when she was enslaved and he was a hired {{apprentice}} to the family of her master. Despite Taylor's being a free black, the family tried to <b>sell</b> <b>him</b> into slavery. She assisted Sam in escaping, and he promised to return and free her, but she was sold to a different master. Ryder says that Taylor could have died, may have outgrown her, or could have remarried. However, she persists in saying that her husband has remained faithful, and refuses to stop looking. Ryder advises her that slave marriages did not count after the war; marriages had to be officially made legal. She shows him an old picture of Sam and leaves.|$|E
