5|$|State-owned <b>slaves</b> <b>were</b> {{put to work}} in palaces, offices, workshops, stables, and {{sometimes}} state-owned agricultural fields, while privately owned <b>slaves</b> <b>were</b> employed in domestic services {{and sometimes}} farming. However, {{the vast majority of}} non-independent farmers working for wealthy landowners were not hired laborers or slaves, but were landless peasants who paid rent as tenants. It might have been more economically feasible to maintain tenants instead of slaves, since slave masters were obligated to pay an annual poll tax of 240 coins for each slave they owned (the same rate merchants had to pay for their poll tax). Government <b>slaves</b> <b>were</b> not assigned to work in the government's monopolized industries over iron and salt (which lasted from Emperor Wu's reign until the beginning of Eastern Han). Privately owned <b>slaves</b> <b>were</b> usually assigned to kitchen duty while others fulfilled roles as armed bodyguards, mounted escorts, acrobats, jugglers, dancers, singers, and musicians.|$|E
5|$|Most slaves {{worked as}} {{plantation}} laborers. Relatively few Brazilians owned slaves and most {{small and medium-sized}} farms employed free workers. Slaves could be found scattered throughout society in other capacities: some were used as house servants, farmers, miners, prostitutes, gardeners and in many other roles. Many emancipated slaves went on to acquire slaves and there were even cases of slaves who had their own slaves. While <b>slaves</b> <b>were</b> usually black or mulatto there were reported cases of slaves {{who appeared to be}} of European descent—the product of generations of inter-ethnic sexual relations between male slave owners and their female mulatto slaves. Even the harshest slave owners adhered to a long-established practice of selling slaves along with their families, taking care not to separate individuals. <b>Slaves</b> <b>were</b> regarded by law as properties. The ones who were freed immediately became citizens with all civil rights guaranteed—the only exception being that, until 1881, freed <b>slaves</b> <b>were</b> barred from voting in elections, although their children and descendants could vote.|$|E

5|$|Slaves (nuli 奴隸) {{comprised}} roughly 1% of the population, {{a proportion}} {{far less than}} the contemporary Greco-Roman world which relied on the labor of a large slave population. <b>Slaves</b> <b>were</b> classified into two categories: those who were privately owned, and those who were owned by the state. Privately owned <b>slaves</b> <b>were</b> often former peasants who fell into debt and sold themselves into slavery, while others were former government slaves bestowed to nobles and high officials as rewards for their services. State-owned <b>slaves</b> <b>were</b> sometimes prisoners of war (yet not all were made slaves). However, most <b>slaves</b> <b>were</b> tributary gifts given to the court by foreign states, families of criminals who committed treason against the state, and former private slaves who were either donated to authorities (since this would exempt the former slaveholder from labor obligations) or confiscated by the state if their master had broken a law. In both Western and Eastern Han, arrested criminals became convicts and it was only during the reign of Wang Mang that counterfeiting criminals were made into slaves.|$|E

5000|$|The Catholic Church {{played an}} {{instrumental}} role in preserving the {{human dignity and}} working for the social integration of the African man in Puerto Rico. The church insisted that every <b>slave</b> <b>be</b> baptized and converted to the Catholic faith. Church doctrine held that master and <b>slave</b> <b>were</b> equal before the eyes of God, and therefore brothers in Christ with a common moral and religious character. Cruel and unusual punishment of <b>slaves</b> <b>was</b> considered {{a violation of the}} fifth commandment.|$|R
5|$|In March 1865, General Order 14 {{provided}} for enlisting slaves into the army, {{with a promise}} of freedom for service. The idea had been suggested years earlier, but Davis did not act upon it {{until late in the}} war, and very few <b>slaves</b> <b>were</b> enlisted.|$|E
5|$|<b>Slaves</b> <b>were</b> {{also used}} as {{craftsmen}} and tradespersons. As in agriculture, {{they were used}} for labour that was beyond the capability of the family. The slave population was greatest in workshops: the shield factory of Lysias employed 120 slaves, {{and the father of}} Demosthenes owned 32 cutlers and 20 bedmakers.|$|E
5|$|The Chagos Islands are {{a cluster}} of 60 islands and seven atolls in the Indian Ocean. First {{occupied}} by lepers from Mauritius, France acquired the islands in the late 18th century, and <b>slaves</b> <b>were</b> brought in from Africa and India to maintain coconut plantations placed there. Following Napoleon's defeat in 1814, the islands were ceded to the British in the Treaty of Paris, who administered them as a dependency of the Colony of Mauritius. Although the <b>slaves</b> <b>were</b> given their freedom in 1835, many remained on the Chagos Islands as contract workers, and their descendants and later immigrants are considered the indigenous people - the Chagossians.|$|E

50|$|The legal {{state of}} <b>slaves</b> <b>was</b> {{based on the}} fact that the <b>slave</b> <b>was</b> not a subject but an object of law. A master had the right of {{ownership}} over the slave. He could sell him, give him in pawn but certainly could not harm or kill him. If someone injured his slave, a master could initiate legal proceedings and demand protection. The ownership over the <b>slave</b> <b>was</b> called dominica potestas, and not dominium like the ownership of objects and animals.|$|R
50|$|The chief {{concern of}} the article is the {{representation}} of slaves in relation to taxation and representation.

5|$|A {{large-scale}} {{slave trade}} with English privateers was begun. The {{life expectancy of}} slaves was much higher in North America than further south, because of less disease and better food and treatment, leading to a rapid increase {{in the numbers of}} slaves. Colonial society was largely divided over the religious and moral implications of slavery and colonies passed acts for and against the practice. But {{by the turn of the}} 18th century, African <b>slaves</b> <b>were</b> replacing indentured servants for cash crop labor, especially in southern regions.|$|E

5|$|African <b>slaves</b> <b>were</b> {{originally}} {{excluded from}} United States citizenship. In 1857, the United States Supreme Court held in Dred Scott v.

5|$|For {{the most}} part, <b>slaves</b> <b>were</b> treated harshly and oppressively during the Roman republican period. Under Republican law, a slave was not {{considered}} a person, but property.

While there were many grades and types of slaves, the lowest—and most numerous—grades {{who worked in the}} fields and mines were subject to a life of hard physical labor.|$|E

To do this, he drew up statistical tables of data from the census.|$|E

5000|$|The Quran assigns {{the same}} spiritual value to a slave as {{to a free}} man, and a believing <b>slave</b> <b>is</b> {{regarded}} as superior to a free pagan or idolator.

[...] While the spiritual value of a <b>slave</b> <b>was</b> same as the freeman, states Forough Jahanbakhsh, in regards to earthly matters, a <b>slave</b> <b>was</b> not an equal to the freeman and relegated to an inferior status. In Quran and for its many commentators, states Ennaji, there is a fundamental distinction between free Muslims and slaves, a basic constituent of its social organization, an irreparable dichotomy introduced by the existence of believers and infidels.|$|R

5|$|In the United States, {{fried chicken}} has stereotypically been {{associated}} with African-Americans. The reasons for this are various. Chicken dishes were popular among slaves before the Civil War, as chickens were generally the only animals <b>slaves</b> <b>were</b> allowed to raise on their own. Minstrel shows and the film The Birth of a Nation led to a prevalent stereotype associating African-Americans with fried chicken.|$|E
5|$|It is {{not certain}} that the <b>slaves</b> <b>were</b> a {{homogeneous}} group {{under the leadership of}} Spartacus. While this is the unspoken assumption of the Roman historians, this may be the Romans projecting their own hierarchical view of military power and responsibility on the ad hoc organization of the slaves. Certainly other slave leaders are mentioned—Crixus, Oenomaus, Gannicus, and Castus—and it cannot be told from the historical evidence whether they were aides, subordinates, or even equals leading groups of their own and traveling in convoy with Spartacus' people.|$|E
50|$|According to the Talmudic law, {{killing of}} a <b>slave</b> <b>is</b> {{punishable}} {{in the same way}} as {{killing of a}} freeman, even it was committed by the owner.
