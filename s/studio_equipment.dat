5|$|After {{acquiring}} {{their own}} recording studio, the duo immediately {{started working on}} new material and assimilated themselves with music recording and <b>studio</b> <b>equipment,</b> as they sought to become more ambitious artists and less dependent on other producers. The two also became more accustomed to playing live, particularly Big Boi, and André 3000 significantly changed his lifestyle, as he adopted a more eccentric fashion sense, became a vegetarian, and stopped smoking marijuana. Having dropped out months before graduation, André 3000 also returned to high school to earn his diploma during the recording of ATLiens.|$|E

5|$|The {{competitors}} in the 1984 sale of ATV Music included Charles Koppelman and Marty Bandier's New York-based the Entertainment Co., Virgin Records, New York real estate tycoon Samuel J. LeFrak, and financier Charles Knapp. On November 20, 1984, Jackson sent a bid of $46million to Holmes à Court. Branca suggested {{the amount of the}} bid after having spent time evaluating the earnings of the catalogue and learning of another bid for $39million. Jackson was only interested in the music copyrights, but the package also included buildings, a recording studio and <b>studio</b> <b>equipment.</b> The two sides signed a non-binding memorandum of mutual interest in December 1984 and Jackson's team began a four-month process of verifying ATV Music's legal documents, financial reports, and every significant composition in the nearly 4000-song catalog.|$|E

25|$|Playing back {{a signal}} from {{recording}} <b>studio</b> <b>equipment</b> directly into a guitar amplifier can cause unwanted side-effects such as input-stage distortion, treble loss or overemphasis, and ground-loop hum; thus there is sometimes a need for impedance conversion, level-matching, and ground alteration. Like running a guitar signal through a guitar effects pedal that is set to Bypass, re-amping introduces some degree of sonic degradation compared to playing a guitar live directly into a guitar amp rig.|$|E

500|$|During a tour {{where they}} {{supported}} Underoath in October, they brought their <b>studio</b> <b>equipment</b> with them, which {{allowed them to}} record on the road. Butler said [...] "It was like we'd have a pop up studio in a bathroom in South Florida or in the woods off the highway in Wyoming." [...] In December, the band felt they were done with recordings; Butler said [...] "there was absolutely nothing left to try", and {{walked away from the}} project. The band had recorded the drums on four different occasions. They finished recording at a static studio in January 2013.|$|E
500|$|Frenetic in {{progression}} {{and explicit}} in lyrical content, Adkins {{was known for}} having an unconventional take on traditional rockabilly. His unpolished sound was a praised by-product of the makeshift <b>studio</b> <b>equipment</b> used {{for the majority of}} his career. [...] "I didn't try to be primitive, I just had bad microphones", he wrote. His lyrics explored topics such as eating peanut butter on the moon and the suggestive strut of a chicken. Recurring themes in Adkins' catalogue included sex, heartbreak, decapitation, aliens, hot dogs and poultry. Together with country and honky-tonk, Adkins' assortment of styles helped delineate a genre known as psychobilly.|$|E
500|$|Ranaldo {{originally}} recorded acoustic demos for Between the Times and the Tides on his iPhone. He later rerecorded them in-studio with Steve Shelley, {{the drummer}} of Sonic Youth. According to Ranaldo, the subsequent demo recording {{led to the}} development of the songs, which then became [...] "guitar-and-bass-and-drums demos." [...] He referred to the recording process of the album as [...] "gradual but really organic." [...] When he began recording the album in January 2011at Echo Canyon West in Hoboken, New Jersey, Ranaldo [...] "started laying them down in a little bit more hi–fi fashion", using <b>studio</b> <b>equipment</b> and effects pedals.|$|E

500|$|Albini used unusual {{recording}} techniques. For Kim Deal's backing vocals in [...] "Where Is My Mind?" [...] and her lead vocals on [...] "Gigantic", Albini {{moved the}} <b>studio</b> <b>equipment</b> and recorded {{in a studio}} bathroom to achieve real, rather than studio, echo; according to John Murphy, Deal's husband at the time, [...] "Albini didn't like the studio sound." [...] Albini later said that the record could have been completed in a week, but [...] "we ended up trying more experimental stuff basically to kill time and see if anything good materialized." [...] An example was [...] "Something Against You", where Albini filtered Black Francis' voice through a guitar amp for [...] "a totally ragged, vicious texture." ...|$|E
500|$|The song {{begins with}} [...] "a startling machine-gun fuzz guitar riff", with Lennon and Harrison's guitars {{prominent}} throughout the track. The distorted guitar sound {{was achieved by}} direct injection of the guitar signal into the mixing console. Emerick later explained that he routed the signal through two microphone preamplifiers in series while keeping the amount of overload just below the point of overheating the console. This was such a severe abuse of the <b>studio</b> <b>equipment</b> that Emerick thought, [...] "If I was the studio manager and saw this going on, I'd fire myself." [...] Lennon overdubbed the opening scream, and double-tracked {{some of the words}} [...] "so roughly that its careless spontaneity becomes a point in itself", according to author Ian MacDonald.|$|E
500|$|In March 1979, Coleman went to RCA Records' New York {{studio to}} produce an album with Prime Time by direct-to-disc recording. They had {{mechanical}} problems with the <b>studio</b> <b>equipment</b> and the recording was rejected. The failed session was a project under Phrase Text, Coleman's music publishing company. He wanted to set up his own record company with the same name, and chose his old friend Kunle Mwanga as his manager. In April, Mwanga arranged another session at CBS Studios in New York City, and Coleman recorded Of Human Feelings there on April 25; the session was originally titled Fashion Faces. Jackson did not record with the band and Calvin Weston was hired in his place to play simultaneously with Denardo Coleman. They recorded all the album's songs on the first take without any equipment problems.|$|E

500|$|In {{addition}} to recording at I.D. Sound, Rundgren took an 8-track recorder and some <b>studio</b> <b>equipment,</b> installing {{it at his}} rented home on Astral Drive, Nichols Canyon. 'Intro' and 'Breathless' were recorded here, along with various guitar and keyboard overdubs. A version of 'Torch Song' was also recorded, but was scrapped due to excessive background noise. Rundgren recalled that recording at home meant he could spend time working on pieces of technology or production, such as programming a VCS3 synthesizer, at his leisure without wasting anyone else's time. The artwork on the original gatefold sleeve was also shot in this apartment. Despite working long hours each day in both I.D and at home, with minimum breaks for sleeping and eating, Rundgren said he enjoyed the recording experience, and [...] "wouldn't have had it any other way." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Julien, Sgt. Pepper {{represents}} the [...] "epitome {{of the transformation}} of the recording studio into a compositional tool", marking the moment when [...] "popular music entered the era of phonographic composition." [...] Its lasting commercial success and critical impact are largely due to Martin and his engineers' creative use of <b>studio</b> <b>equipment</b> while originating new processes. Artistic experimentation, such as the placement of random gibberish in the run-out groove, is one of the album's defining features. In the opinion of the Beatles historian Mark Lewisohn, Sgt. Pepper {{represents the}} group's last unified effort, displaying a cohesion that would begin deteriorating immediately following the album's completion and that had entirely disappeared by the release of The Beatles in 1968. Emerick notes the minimal involvement of Harrison and Starr, viewing Sgt. Pepper as a work of Lennon and McCartney that was less a group effort than any of their previous releases.|$|E
500|$|After {{the album}} was {{certified}} platinum, LaFace Records gave OutKast more creative control and advanced money for their 1996 follow-up album ATLiens. After acquiring their own recording studio, the duo immediately started working on new material and assimilated themselves with music recording and <b>studio</b> <b>equipment,</b> as they sought to become more ambitious artists and less dependent on other producers. The two also became more accustomed to playing live, particularly Big Boi, and André 3000 significantly changed his lifestyle, as he adopted a more eccentric fashion sense, became a vegetarian, and stopped smoking marijuana. The album's success also opened up more opportunities for Organized Noize, who subsequently worked on TLC's CrazySexyCool (1994). The Organized Noize-produced hit [...] "Waterfalls" [...] became a massive success and earned the production team enough clout with LaFace to endorse Goodie Mob to the label. Organized Noize produced Goodie Mob's acclaimed 1995 debut Soul Food and continued their crossover into R production, including work on Curtis Mayfield's 1997 album New World Order.|$|E
5|$|Before its studio's second production, Oriental began renting {{the studios}} of Algemeen Nederlandsch Indisch Filmsyndicaat (ANIF) in Molenvliet, Batavia, for 1,500 gulden a month.

500|$|While {{she worked}} on the film, she also began {{producing}} her next album, writing new music, and teaming with new collaborators. She has said [...] "Selmasongs was the day job and Vespertine was the hobby". The earliest sessions took place in Spain with programmer Jake Davies. Her new relationship with artist Matthew Barney, and the tension while filming Dancer in the Dark, have {{been referred to as}} the two major forces that shaped what would become Vespertine. As the process of filming demanded that she be extroverted, the new music she was creating became hushed and tranquil as a way to escape. Björk commissioned Valgeir Sigurðsson to relocate some of his <b>studio</b> <b>equipment</b> from Iceland to Denmark where Dancer in the Dark was being filmed. While living in Copenhagen, she also contacted the electronic musician Thomas Knak (also known as Opiate), after having enjoyed his 1999 album Objects for an Ideal Home. Björk's musical taste shifted from the [...] "clang and clatter" [...] and [...] "thumping techno" [...] that characterized Homogenic, as she grew tired of [...] "big beats".|$|E
500|$|... "Da Funk" [...] and [...] "Alive" [...] {{were later}} {{included}} on Daft Punk's 1997 debut album Homework. In February of that year, the UK dance magazine Muzik published a Daft Punk cover feature and described Homework as [...] "one {{of the most}} hyped debut albums in a long long time." [...] According to The Village Voice, the album revived house music and departed from the Eurodance formula. As noted by critic Alex Rayner, Homework brought together established club styles and the [...] "burgeoning eclecticism" [...] of big beat. In 1997 Daft Punk also launched their Daftendirektour to promote Homework in several cities throughout the world. For this tour the duo opted to utilize their home <b>studio</b> <b>equipment</b> for the live stage. As Bangalter stated, [...] "Everything was synched up—the drum machines, the bass lines. The sequencer was just sending out the tempos and controlling the beats and bars. On top of this structure we built all these layers of samples and various parts that we could bring in whenever we wanted to." [...] 25 May 1997 saw them perform at the Tribal Gathering festival at Luton Hoo, England, headlining with Orbital and Kraftwerk.|$|E
500|$|Mardas {{gave the}} Beatles regular reports of his progress, {{but when they}} {{required}} their new studio in January 1969, during the Get Back project that became Let It Be, they discovered an unusable studio: no 72-track tape deck (Mardas had reduced it to 16 tracks), no soundproofing, no talkback (intercom) system, and not even a patch bay to run the wiring between the control room and the 16 speakers that Mardas had fixed haphazardly to the walls. The only new piece of sound equipment present was a crude mixing console which Mardas had built, which looked (in the words of Martin's assistant, Dave Harries) like [...] "bits of wood and an old oscilloscope". The console was scrapped after just one session. Harrison said it was [...] "chaos", {{and that they had}} to [...] "rip it all out and start again," [...] calling it [...] "the biggest disaster of all time." [...] Harrison's suspicions of Mardas' competence had been raised when he saw him wandering around in a white coat with a clipboard, and considered the possibility that Mardas had [...] "just read the latest version of Science Weekly, and used its ideas". Mardas later stated that he had never been in the basement of Savile Row, as the <b>studio</b> <b>equipment</b> he was building was being tested in Apple Electronics, at Boston Place, Marylebone.|$|E
