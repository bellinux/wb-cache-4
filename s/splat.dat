The event was live-streamed on The Splat's Facebook page. The week of July 25, 2016, The <b>Splat</b> aired a Double Dare-themed week featuring episodes and moments from the series' history, and included edited versions of the Comic-Con games. These events marked Summers' first Nickelodeon-sponsored involvement with the brand since Double Dare 2000.|$|E

Since 2011, Double Dare has {{been incorporated into}} the branding of TeenNick's classic Nickelodeon blocks The '90s Are All That, and its successor, NickSplat (previously known as The <b>Splat).</b> Episodes of Double Dare have occasionally aired in these blocks.|$|E
5|$|On October 6, 2016, Nickelodeon {{announced}} that Double Dare would {{be returning to}} television for a half-hour commemorative special celebrating the 30th anniversary of the show's premiere. The Double Dare Reunion Special aired on November 23, 2016, on Nick at Nite, with a special encore airing on The <b>Splat.</b> The special included vintage clips, behind-the-scenes footage, and a new game recorded at San Diego Comic-Con 2016 played by cast members from All That. Marc Summers, announcer Harvey, and stage assistant Robin Russo (née Marrella) appeared in the special. The Double Dare Reunion Special was watched by 1.126 million viewers on Nick at Nite, outperforming all other shows on the network for the evening, and finishing as the third-most viewed of all non-sports original cable telecasts among viewers ages 18 to 34 for that day. In {{the first half of}} 2017, Marc Summers stated that due {{to the success of the}} special, he is in negotiations to return to Double Dare in some form with Nickelodeon, possibly in a version with adult contestants on Nick at Nite.|$|E

5|$|Although English {{furniture}} derives so extensively {{from foreign}} and especially French and Italian models, the earlier forms of English chairs owed but little to exotic influences. This was especially the case {{down to the}} end of the Tudor period, after which France began to set her mark upon the British chair. The squat variety, with heavy and sombre back, carved like a piece of panelling, gave place to a taller, more slender, and more elegant form, in which the framework only was carved, and attempts were made at ornament in new directions. The stretcher especially offered opportunities which were not lost upon the cabinet-makers of the Restoration. From a mere uncompromising cross-bar intended to strengthen the construction it blossomed, almost suddenly, into an elaborate scroll-work or an exceedingly graceful semicircular ornament connecting all four legs, with a vase-shaped knob in the centre. The arms and legs of chairs of this period were scrolled, the splats of the back often showing a rich arrangement of spirals and scrolls. This most decorative of all types appears to have been popularized in England by the cavaliers who had been in exile with Charles II, and had become familiar with it in the north-western parts of the European continent. During the reign of William III and Mary II these charming forms degenerated into something much stiffer and more rectangular, with a solid, more or less fiddle-shaped <b>splat</b> and a cabriole leg with pad feet. The more ornamental examples had cane seats and ill-proportioned cane backs. From these forms was gradually developed the Chippendale chair, with its elaborately interlaced back, its graceful arms and square or cabriole legs, the latter terminating in the claw and ball or the pad foot. George Hepplewhite, Thomas Sheraton and Robert Adam all aimed at lightening the chair, which, even in the master hands of Thomas Chippendale, remained comparatively heavy. The endeavour succeeded, and the modern chair is everywhere comparatively slight.|$|E

40|$|Figure 1 : Various test models (chameleon, face, male, tiny) are {{rendered}} using view-independent object-space surface <b>splatting.</b> Elliptical {{weighted average}} (EWA) surface <b>splatting</b> {{is an important}} technique for producing high-quality point-based rendering. With the proliferation of programmable graphics hardware, many methods have been proposed recently to implement hardware-accelerated EWA surface <b>splatting</b> on modern consumerlevel graphics hardware. However, we notice that those methods tend to rely heavily on customized vertex programs (or shaders) and fragment programs. Many hardware functions such as the multisampling and anisotropic texture filtering features that could be equally useful for both triangle-based rendering and point-based rendering are seldom put to use in current EWA surface <b>splatting</b> methods. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective change to the EWA surface <b>splatting</b> method by removing the low-pass filter from the resampling process. The low-pass filtering is then {{taken care of by}} multisampling (for full-scene antialiasing). This simple change effectively extracts the screen-space issues out of the EWA surface <b>splatting</b> problem. Therefore, the remaining parts of EWA surface <b>splatting</b> become purely object-space problems which are much easier to solve. For example, perspective accurate <b>splatting</b> which requires special attention in some screen-space surface <b>splatting</b> algorithms is easily achieved as long as the hardware supports perspective-correct interpolation. Other hardware features such as anisotropic texture filtering can be easily added as well. Our results show the rendering quality is comparable to those produced with resampling filters with tightly-coupled low-pass filters. We also achieve rendering speed of about 6 million <b>splats</b> per second...|$|R

The mountain's previous rides had all been removed several years previously, and Volcano gave the mountain a major transformation. Volcano, which was manufactured by Intamin, was the world's first LIM-launched inverted roller coaster. The ride featured two separate launch sections, an Immelman loop {{out of the top}} of the mountain, and three heartline rolls on the way back down. Volcano was themed to the 1997 film Volcano; the other Paramount Parks added inverted or suspended roller coasters themed to Top Gun around the same time. During the next two seasons, Kings Dominion expanded Hurricane Reef behind the Rebel Yell and renamed it WaterWorks. The new portion of WaterWorks includes Pipeline Peak, a set of four enclosed water slides, one of which (the Night Slider) is the world's tallest dark free-fall slide. In 2000, Nick Central opened, replacing Nick <b>Splat</b> City and part of Kidzville.|$|E

The influence of the substrate temperature and roughness on the microstructure of copper <b>splats</b> was examined in the present study. Copper (− 90 + 45 μm) was plasma sprayed under atmospheric conditions on mirror polished (Ra not, vert, similar 0. 02 μm) and on grit-blasted (Ra not, vert, similar 1. 33 μm) stainless steel substrates (AISI 304 L).

40|$|<b>Splatting</b> is an object-order volume {{rendering}} algorithm {{that produces}} images of high quality, and several optimization techniques have been proposed. This paper presents new techniques that accelerate <b>splatting</b> algorithms by exploiting both object-space and image-space coherence. In particular, we propose two visibility test methods suitable for octree-based <b>splatting.</b> The first method, based on dynamic image-space range tree, offers an accurate occlusion test, {{and does not}} trade off image quality. The second one, based on image-space quadtree, uses an approximate occlusion test that is faster than the first algorithm is. Although the approximate visibility test may produce visual artifacts in rendering, the introduced error is usually found very little. Tests with several datasets of useful sizes and complexities showed considerable speedups {{with respect to the}} <b>splatting</b> algorithm, enhanced with octree only. Considering that they are very easy to implement, and need little additional memory, our techniques will be used as very effective <b>splatting</b> methods.

EWA surface <b>splatting</b> renders water-tight surfaces of complex point models with high quality, anisotropic texture filtering. In this paper we introduce a new multi-pass approach to perform EWA surface <b>splatting</b> on modern PC graphics hardware, called object space EWA <b>splatting.</b> We derive an object space formulation of the EWA filter, which is amenable for acceleration by conventional triangle-based graphics hardware. We describe how to implement the object space EWA filter using a two pass rendering algorithm. In the first rendering pass, visibility <b>splatting</b> is performed by shifting opaque surfel polygons backward along the viewing rays, while in the second rendering pass view-dependent EWA prefiltering is performed by deforming texture mapped surfel polygons. We use texture mapping and alpha blending to facilitate the <b>splatting</b> process. We implement our algorithm using programmable vertex and pixel shaders, fully exploiting the capabilities of today´s graphics processing units (GPUs).

25|$|In some {{instances}} growers’ demand for beehives far exceeds the available supply. The number of managed beehives in the US has steadily declined from close to 6 million after WWII, {{to less than}} 2.5 million today. In contrast, the area dedicated to growing bee-pollinated crops has grown over 300% {{in the same time}} period. Additionally, {{in the past five years}} there has been a decline in winter managed beehives, which has reached an unprecedented rate of colony losses at near 30%. At present, there is an enormous demand for beehive rentals that cannot always be met. There is a clear need across the agricultural industry for a management tool to draw pollinators into cultivations and encourage them to preferentially visit and pollinate the flowering crop. By attracting pollinators like honey bees and increasing their foraging behavior, particularly in the center of large plots, we can increase grower returns and optimize yield from their plantings. ISCA Technologies, from Riverside California, created a semiochemical formulation called <b>SPLAT</b> Bloom, that modifies the behavior of honey bees, inciting them to visit flowers in every portion of the field.|$|E

40|$|Volume {{ray casting}} {{is based on}} {{sampling}} the data along sight rays. In this technique, reconstruction is achieved by a convolution, which collects the contribution of multiple voxels to one sample point. <b>Splatting,</b> on the other hand, is based on projecting data points onto the screen. Here, reconstruction is implemented by an “inverted convolution ” where the contribution of one data element is distributed to many sample points (i. e., pixels). <b>Splatting</b> produces images of a quality comparable to raycasting but at greater speeds. This is achieved by precomputing the projection footprint that the interpolation kernel leaves on the image plane. However, while fast incremental schemes can be utilized for orthographic projection, perspective projection complicates the mapping of the footprints and is therefore rather slow.
