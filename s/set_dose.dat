40|$|The Sleeping Beauty (SB) {{transposon}} {{system has}} been shown to enable long-term gene expression by integrating new sequences into host cell chromosomes. We found that the recently reported SB 100 x hyperactive transposase conferred a surprisingly high level of long-term expression after hydrodynamic delivery of luciferase-encoding reporter transposons in the mouse. We conducted dose-ranging studies to determine the effect of varying the amount of SB 100 x transposase-encoding plasmid (pCMV-SB 100 x) at a <b>set</b> <b>dose</b> of luciferase transposon and of varying the amount of transposon-encoding DNA at a <b>set</b> <b>dose</b> of pCMV-SB 100 x in hydrodynamically injected mice. Animals were immunosuppressed using cyclophosphamide in order to prevent an antiluciferase immune response. At a <b>set</b> <b>dose</b> of transposon DNA (25 µg), we observed a broad range of pCMV-SB 100 x doses (0. 1 – 2. 5 µg) conferring optimal levels of long-term expression (> 1011 photons/second/cm 2). At a fixed dose of 0. 5 μg of pCMV-SB 100 x, maximal long-term luciferase expression (> 1010 photons/second/cm 2) was achieved at a transposon dose of 5 – 125 μg. We also found that in the linear range of transposon doses (100 [*]ng), co-delivering the CMV-SB 100 x sequence on the same plasmid was less effective in achieving long-term expression than delivery on separate plasmids. These results show marked flexibility in the doses of SB transposon plus pCMV-SB 100 x that achieve maximal SB-mediated gene transfer efficiency and long-term gene expression after hydrodynamic DNA delivery to mouse liver...|$|E

Due to its simplicity of measurement, the use of entrance surface dose as the dose parameter to be used for setting the dose limit as recommended by the European Union and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is also suggested.

In {{order to deal with}} the variations in crop development and site-specific variations in a field, a sensor-based spray technology was developed; SensiSpray. The system consists of sensors to detect crop variation and a spray system to automatically change spray volume. Electronics and software were developed to use the output signal of the sensor NTech GreenSeeker to adapt spray volume. For the variation of spray volume (50 - 550 L ha- 1) Lechler VarioSelect nozzle bodies were used fitted with four different low-drift venturi flat fan nozzles. Spray deposition measurements were performed to test the sprayer accuracy in adapting spray volume based on the reflection signal per section, using a fluorescent dye (Brilliant Sulpho Flavine) added to the spray liquid.

This model utilizes the recruitment and activation of neutrophils into bronchial alveolar lavage fluid (BALF) as the efficacy endpoint. This model was selected for the study because it provides two distinctive advantages. First, this acute animal model has been well studied by researchers and used to mimic human pulmonary inflammation [14 – 18]. Secondly, compared with other animal models such as the mouse ovalbumin model, the rat LPS model offers the advantage of serial blood sampling and more precise delivery of drug into the lung via intratracheal dosing. We chose two ICS compounds to evaluate in this rat LPS model—fluticasone propionate and ciclesonide.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Despite recent advances, {{treatment}} {{of patients with}} aggressive Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL 2) {{has yet to be}} optimally designed. Notwithstanding the contribution of molecular treatments, intensification of chemotherapeutic regimens may still be beneficial. Hoping to aid in the design of intensified chemotherapy, we put forward a mathematical and computational model that analyses the effect of Doxorubicin on NHL over a wide range of patho-physiological conditions. The model represents tumour growth both in diffusion-limited settings, that is, in small avascular tumours and tumour cords, and in perfusion-limited settings, e. g. in well-vascularized tumours. Model simulations indicated the presence of a critical regimen intensity below which treatment will fall short of tumour elimination. Taking this critical intensity into account, we compared two regimen intensification strategies: Dose escalation and regimen densification, i. e. reducing the inter-dosing interval. In the diffusion-limited <b>setting,</b> <b>dose</b> escalation was somewhat more efficient than regimen densification. In the perfusion-limited setting, both intensification strategies yielded similar results.

This study attempts to determine how breathing motion affects intact-breast cancer patients for three different treatment techniques commonly used in the clinic: physical wedge compensators (PWs), enhanced dynamic wedges (EDWs), and step-and-shoot intensity modulated radiation therapy (ssIMRT). Some {{of the effects of}} intrafraction motion can be eliminated with Gating Therapy. In this study, we have also investigated the efficiency of a Real-Time Position Management Gating System. In order to mimic patient breathing, equipment has been designed to simulate respiratory motion to a first order approximation. A breast phantom has also been designed to represent patient tissue and shape. Film was used as a dosimeter and static dosimetry data were used as a control for comparison. Three velocities of the breast phantom were studied, and Gating Therapy was introduced for each data <b>set.</b> <b>Dose</b> area histograms were calculated for a breast and lung planning target area (PTA), and Normalized Agreement Test (NAT) Indexes were calculated in reference to the static case. Our study shows that the results are dependent on the respiratory rate and the wedge angle and that deviation from the static case is highest if the collimator speed is of the same magnitude as the speed of the target. Generally, there is a large overdosage to the lung PTA and a large underdosage to the breast PTA. However, with the implementation of Gating Therapy, these dose discrepancies are dramatically reduced. The areas of high and low dose within the treatment field observed in this study can be related to other treatment sites affected by respiratory motion. Based on these results, we highly recommend using Gating Therapy for all treatments that may be affected by intrafraction organ motion...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Purpose To {{estimate}} {{the effects of}} heterogeneity on tumour cell sensitivity to radiotherapy combined with radiosensitizing agents attributable to differences in expression levels of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFr). Materials and methods Differences in radiosensitivity {{are not limited to}} cells of different cancer histotypes but also occur within the same cancer, or appear during radiotherapy if radiosensitizing drugs are combined with ionizing radiation. A modified biologically effective dose (MBED), has been introduced to account for changes in radiosensitivity parameters (α and α/β) rather than changes in dose/fraction or total dose as normally done with standard biologically effective dose (BED). The MBED approach was applied to cases of EGFr over-expression and cases where EGFr inhibitors were combined with radiation. Representative examples in clinical practice were considered. Results Assuming membrane EGFr over-expression corresponds to reduced radiosensitivity (α H [*] =[*] 0. 15 Gy - 1 and α H /β H [*] =[*] 7. 5 Gy) relative to normal radiosensitivity (α[*]=[*] 0. 2 Gy - 1 and α/β[*]=[*] 10 Gy), an increased dose per fraction of 2. 42 Gy was obtained through the application of MBED, which is equivalent to the effect of a reference schedule with 30 fractions of 2 Gy. An equivalent hypo-fractionated regime with a dose per fraction of 2. 80 Gy is obtained if 25 fractions are <b>set.</b> <b>Dose</b> fractionations modulated according to drug pharmacokinetics are estimated for combined treatments with biological drugs. Soft and strong modulated equivalent hypo-fractionations result from subtraction of 5 or 10 fractions, respectively. Conclusions During this computational study, a new radiobiological tool has been introduced. The MBED allows the required dose per fraction to be estimated when tumour radiosensitivity is reduced because EGFr is over-expressed. If radiotherapy treatment is combined with EGFr inhibitors, MBED suggests new treatment strategies, with schedules modulated according to drug pharmacokinetics. </p...|$|E
40|$|Because {{we became}} an {{unintended}} {{world leader in}} the development of multiple anthelmintic resistance, South Africa has had to find, embrace and implement more sustainable and holistic methods of managing helminths in sheep. The problem has been to wean farmers off a heavy reliance on anthelmintics and to use a wide array of measures that require more management, in the face of inertia and attempts by some unscrupulous drug purveyors to block the needed changes. Packaging the available and proven measures into five practical sections helps to make the change more palatable and attractive to farmers. These sections are termed “The Big Five” and consist of firstly, host resistance and resilience: in the past we have concentrated too much on anthelmintic resistance (AR) and not enough on SR (sheep resistance). The motto must be “Stop Selecting Sissy Sheep!” To achieve this we can apply selection of rams by faecal egg counts (FEC) or FAMACHA, culling of ewes based on targeted selective treatment (TST) results, good nutrition, especially protein and trace elements needed to support immunity, enough exposure to worms for immunity to develop, and control of other diseases. Secondly, reducing parasite load: since the outcome of parasitosis is largely determined by numbers, this needs ongoing attention. This can be achieved by reducing the length of stay in a pasture, reducing the grazing pressure if this is not possible, increasing the time of absence from a pasture, especially at danger times, alternation with non-susceptible grazing species where possible, avoiding worm “hot spots” like grassed pens and leaking water troughs. Thirdly, evaluate pasture factors: the farmer and advisor have to consider the height (length) of grazing as it affects its risk for parasite transfer, the type (pasture species) as it will influence risk, the pasture slope affecting run-off and thus the suitability for larval survival, and the aspect (direction facing) should also be used to assess risk. Fourth, monitoring the situation: farm situations can be assessed by regular (monthly or bimonthly) pooled flock FECs, AR assessments using FEC reduction tests (FECRTs) or other measures, measures using TST like the 5 POINT CHECK, a weather watch to predict conditions favourable for larval development (rain, humidity, temperature) and grazing monitoring to assess developing dangers. Fifth, optimise drugs to be used: drug usage must be rationalised and minimised. Implement TST and TT (targeted treatment); read the label, follow instructions and check the spectrum covered; weigh the sheep, <b>set</b> <b>dose</b> according to the heaviest in the group and check the gun for accuracy and repeatability; target the most vulnerable (lambs and lactating or heavily pregnant ewes) for special attention; do not buy on cost alone and do not formulate (mix) own farm mixtures. By emphasising the “Big Five” we can encourage and enable farmers to implement four or more items in each section, and thus minimise the long-term effects of internal parasites on farm profitability. This approach has assisted with getting farmers to use sustainable, holistic internal parasite management (SHIPM) in sheep flocks. A reminder {{in the form of a}} poster to be hung on the wall of the farm office will help encourage continuous implementation. [URL]...|$|E

Gilts were inseminated twice at predetermined times, namely 144 and 168 h (Group 2), 128 and 144 h (Group 3), and 144 and 152 h (Group 4) after the end of RU treatment, respectively. Pregnant gilts were slaughtered at 30 d. Administration of Re 104 h after the end of RU feeding synchronized ovulation over a 24 -h time window in 97. 9 % and 100 % of the gilts of Groups 3 and 4, respectively, whereas Re administration at 120 h (Group 2) only successfully synchronized 88. 9 % of the gilts over 24 h. Ovulation rates of gilts of Groups 2 and 4 were similar to that of the control group. Pregnancy rates were numerically higher in Groups 2 and 3 (92 % and 96 %, respectively) compared with those of Groups I and 4 (84 % and 81 %, respectively). Combination of eCG with Re administration at 104 h (Group 3) increased ovulation rate (+ 4 CL) but decreased embryo survival to 62 % at Day 30. The weaned sow experiment involved 61 sows of a range of parities (2. 7 +/- 0. 9), allocated to two control groups (Control 104 group and Control 94 group) and two treated groups (Re 104 group and Rc 94 group), which received 10 mu g Re at 104 and 94 h after weaning, respectively. The females were inseminated at detected estrus. All pregnant sows farrowed. After treatment with Re 94 h after weaning, 100 % of sows ovulated over a 24 -h time window versus only 68. 7 % of controls. Farrowing rate and litter size of the sows treated with Re at that time were unaffected compared with that of control sows. In contrast, Re administration at 104 h after weaning may have been too late; only 66. 7 % of the treated sows ovulated during a 24 -h period. This proportion was numerically lower but not significantly different than that for control sows. Farrowing rate and litter size of treated sows were not significantly different than that of controls. Administration of Rc at the dose and times selected in this study tightened synchrony of ovulation in gilts and in sows after weaning. It remains to be established if such a synchrony is suitable to obtain good fertility after a single artificial insemination at a predetermined time...|$|E
40|$|Real time in vivo {{dosimetry}} is a {{major challenge}} in modern radiotherapy. One promising candidate for such dosimetry is the metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor (MOSFET) dosimeter. The advantage of MOSFET dosimeters is that they offer real-time dose determination, along with a very small dosimetric volume. At the Centre for Medical Radiation Physics (CMRP) a new design of the MOSFET dosimeter called MOSkin, is being developed to measure the dose delivered to the basal layer (0. 07 mm below the skin surface). This thesis discusses pre-clinical characterization of {{a new version of}} the MOSkin dosimeter and optimisation of the operating conditions. Experiments were carried out to test a number of the characteristics of the dosimeter. The tests performed were to investigate the temperature response, sensitivity response, energy dependence and angular dependence of the dose response for the new MOSkin device. The effect of the packaging surrounding the MOSFET dosimeter in these properties was also investigated. Two versions of the MOSkin have been studied; one version was packaged “hard” (set in rigid packaging) and the other “soft” (no rigid packaging). The reproducibility of MOSkin measured dose was tested by placing a device at Dmax (15 mm) in a block of solid water and acquiring data for multiple exposures with 10 * 10 cm 2 of 6 MV photons. Each irradiation was of a <b>set</b> <b>dose,</b> with the dosimeter readout taken 10 sec or 1 min after irradiation. Two phantoms were constructed, one plano-convex and one cylindrical, to test the angular response with the dosimeter located at the centre of each phantom. These were used to investigate the measured angular response of the dosimeter and the effect of phantom geometry on that response. The temperature response tests of the un-irradiated MOSkin found that they have a thermostable readout current leading to low temperature instability 0. 2 mV/°C while sensitivity was 2. 5 mV/Gy. In contrast to dual MOSFET dosimeters the single MOSkin includes built in thermo stabilization, which is independent of accumulated dose. Sensitivity response of the MOSkin was found to decline at a rate of 1. 2 % per 3 Gy while creep-up effects were not observed in the MOSkin – waiting 10 sec or waiting 1 min after irradiation before readout made little difference on measured doses. The MOSkin sensitivity response like any Si device does depend on photon energy in the kV range with the response at 75 kV producing 4. 9 times greater than with 6 MV photons. This is comparable to commercial MOSFET dosimeters described in literature with 4. 5 higher than at 6 MV for the same energy [33]. The angular dependence produced some interesting results. The back face of the hard device showed no angular dependence within ± 2. 5 %, but there was angular dependence with the front face for ± 90 °. However the front face has been shown previously to be accurate for surface measurements when compared to the Attix ionisation chamber [12]. This presents the possibility for use of the MOSkin dosimeter both for surface and at depth in the current configuration. The unique MOSkin design is showing to be very promising as a reliable real-time dosimetry device with the potential capability for many dosimetry applications, in particular skin dosimetry. Unlike other MOSFET dosimeters, it has been shown that the MOSkin has been designed to be temperature independent for dosimetry with a single device, while also having the unique capability of both surface and at depth dosimetry...|$|E
40|$|The {{focus of}} this project has been to explore {{practical}} applications of radiation dose optimisation in the clinical setting of the cardiac catheterisation laboratory. The relevance of interventional procedures and hence fluoroscopy, to modern cardiology practice, is illustrated, and the clinical significance of radiation dose management outlined. Current radiation dose management techniques, {{as well as the}} proposals for further dose optimisation, are detailed in this thesis. The first experiment in this project aims to establish an automated method of data collection for the monitoring of radiation dose optimisation techniques. A combination of open source programming languages and database management software has been used to create software that receives information directly from the fluoroscopic systems following patient procedures in the form of Radiation Dose Structured reports. All information about radiation exposure as well as study type, length and patient demographics are collected and stored. A further application of the software is to calculate the patient skin dose to monitor the likelihood of adverse tissue reactions following any high dose procedures. This information is then analysed and disseminated to operators to drive radiation dose optimisation. The second experiment in this project assessed the accuracy of the reported radiation dose metrics for different manufacturers collected in the above experiment. Fluoroscopic units used for cardiac catheterisation procedures are tested routinely for compliance. However, under Australian regulations, it is not required to validate certain metrics that impact on patient dose management. This study aimed to assess the accuracy of standard DICOM values used in patient dose calculations through direct measurement. The results indicate that the accuracy of the table height was dependent on the age of the unit, with older units varying by up to 4 cm. The reference air kerma and DAP were all within 10 %. The FOV showed the greatest discrepancy from the directly measured value with up to 20 % inaccuracy. The results of this experiment show that table height, and FOV should be directly measured and accounted for when calculating patient skin dose. This chapter also presents recommendations regarding the frequency and tolerance of testing. The third experiment in this thesis addresses the feasibility of using a novel &lsquo;ultralow&rsquo; fluoroscopic pulse rate during routine diagnostic coronary angiograms. Fluoroscopic pulse rate, one of the factors that influence patient dose in a coronary angiogram, is also under control of the operator and can thus be adjusted accordingly. Literature relating to reduction in fluoroscopic pulse rate as a means of radiation dose optimisation shows positive results. However, the resulting loss of diagnostic clarity has been a limiting factor. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of using an ultra low fluoroscopic pulse rate of 3 pulses per second on procedure duration, diagnostic clarity and radiation dose in an analysis of 50 coronary angiograms performed at a large metropolitan centre. The results showed a statistically significant reduction in DAP (58 %) with no reduction in diagnostic clarity or increase in procedure length. The fourth experiment uses the above results in conjunction with educational talks to practically apply radiation dose optimisation techniques at a large teaching hospital. Dose optimisation is particularly pertinent in teaching hospitals, where longer procedure times may be necessary to accommodate the teaching needs of junior staff, and thus impart a greater dose. The aim {{of this study is to}} analyse the effects of varying optimisation protocols in conventional coronary angiograms, from the perspective of a large tertiary centre implementing a rapid dose reduction program. Routine coronary angiograms were chosen to compare baseline levels of radiation, and the dose imparted before and after dose optimisation techniques was measured. Such techniques included lowering dose per pulse, pulse rate, frame rate and encouraging larger field of views and collimation. The results showed up to 54 % dose reduction from a lowering of both frame rate and dose per pulse, without any adverse impact on clinical outcomes or teaching of junior staff. The fifth experiment focuses on the radiation exposure received by the operators in the cardiac catheterisation laboratory. Established research indicates potential long-term harm from low dose protracted radiation exposure to operators of cardiac angiography, with increasing exposure imparting greater risk. This experiment used a phantom model and thermoluminescent dosimeters to measure radiation dose to operators in a conventional coronary angiogram procedure, specifically looking at radiation dose to target regions of the operator to better examine clinical effects. Correspondingly, the results allow for a deduction of a comprehensive list of factors that allow the conversion from readily available patient dose metrics to operator dose. The study also found that basic monitoring using only a single under apron dosimeter underestimates the radiation dose by up to 68 %. Finally, the study provides recommendations to best mitigate the risk of radiation-induced disease through the use of radiation protection tools in high exposure regions of the body. The sixth and final experiment in this thesis outlines the production and evaluation of a real-time radiation dose detector for the purpose of educational simulation and furthering understanding of radiation safety, and eventually clinical applications. Current conventional dose measurement methods, while clinically useful, are usually limited to retrospective analysis of dose only. In the cases where a real-time dose can be measured and displayed, the onus to continually assess the radiation dose visually adds cognitive load to the operator. This project examines the creation of a real-time dose detector that can provide visual, audible and tactile feedback to the interventional cardiologist. The aim of such a device is to provide ongoing feedback to the operator which can result in dose savings to the patient in real time via procedural modifications. A prototype was created and tested, with calibration results showing that detector performance was comparable to available products and comfortable to wear for the operator. The vibration module providing tactile feedback can be programmed to either activate during increased dose rates (thus allowing procedural modifications) or following a <b>set</b> <b>dose</b> threshold, serving as a reminder that the procedure is resulting in a high patient and operator radiation exposure...|$|E
40|$|The dose {{coverage}} of low dose rate (LDR) -brachytherapy for localized prostate cancer is monitored 4 - 6 weeks after intervention by contouring the prostate on computed tomography and/or {{magnetic resonance imaging}} <b>sets.</b> <b>Dose</b> parameters for the prostate (V 100, D 90 and D 80) provide information on the treatment quality. Those depend strongly on the delineation of the prostate contours. We therefore systematically investigated the contouring process for 21 patients with five examiners. The prostate structures were compared with one another using topological procedures based on Boolean algebra. The coincidence number C-V measures the agreement between a set of structures. The mutual coincidence C(i, j) measures the agreement between two structures i and j, and the mean coincidence C(i) compares a selected structure i with the remaining structures in a set. All coincidence parameters have a value of 1 for complete coincidence of contouring and 0 for complete absence. The five patients with the lowest C-V values were discussed, and rules for contouring the prostate have been formulated. The contouring and assessment were repeated after 3 months for the same five patients. All coincidence parameters have been improved after instruction. This shows objectively that training resulted in more consistent contouring across examiners...|$|R
40|$|Overall, {{few studies}} {{reported}} in the literature have focused specifically on non-respond-ers to psychotherapy. Even fewer have specifically selected patients based on previous non-response to treatment and attempted systematic, customized psy-chological interventions to address their needs. Such studies could yield impor-tant information about strategies for overcoming the unfortunate fact that so many do not benefit from psychological treatments. The current study, and the treatment program it examines, was de-signed and implemented as an attempt to remedy this state of affairs. With the aim of relieving the suffering of patients with repeated non-response to treatment, an intensive, time-limited, residential treat-ment program was devised. Using criteria for clinically signifi-cant change in symptoms, 1 the average recovery rate for formal psychothera-peutic treatments delivered in well-designed trials is approximately 50 %. 2 Accordingly, approximately half the patients leave treatment with significant clinical symptoms or deteriorate during or after the intervention. In routine care (treatment as delivered outside of orga-nized psychotherapy trials), the rates of recovery are substantially smaller. 3 Thus, a large percentage of patients in mental health care can be classified as “treatment-resistant ” to psychotherapy. Given this, the development of new ap-proaches specifically designed to aid these patients is of prime importance. Due to lack of research, it remains unknown whether modifications in treatment format, <b>setting,</b> <b>dose,</b> or con...|$|R
50|$|Since general-use x-ray systems emit {{ionizing}} radiation, {{the societal}} benefit of reliably detecting threats must {{be sufficient to}} outweigh the potential radiation risk, if any, to the individual screened. The dose from one screening with a general-use x-ray security screening system is so low that it presents an extremely small risk to any individual. To put the radiation dose received into perspective:* Naturally occurring ionizing radiation is all around us. We are continuously exposed to this background radiation during ordinary living. In 42 minutes of ordinary living, a person receives more radiation from naturally occurring sources than from screening with any general-use x-ray security system.* The national radiation safety standard (see below) <b>sets</b> a <b>dose</b> per screening limit for the general-use category. To {{meet the requirements of}} the general-use category a full-body x-ray security system must deliver less than the dose a person receives during 4 minutes of airline flight. TSA has <b>set</b> their <b>dose</b> limit to ensure a person receives less radiation from one scan with a TSA general-use x-ray security system than from 2 minutes of airline flight.* A person would have to be screened more than a thousand times in one year in order to exceed the annual radiation dose limit for people screening that has been set by expert radiation safety organizations (see below).* Millimeter wave security systems which comply with the limits set in the applicable national non-ionizing radiation safety standard (see below) cause no known adverse health effects.|$|R
