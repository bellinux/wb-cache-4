25|$|Before 1850, {{most of the}} {{freshwater}} on {{the islands}} was held in beaver (Castor canadensis) ponds, although the aquatic mammal was extirpated by Hudson's Bay Company fur stations at Fort Langley and San Juan Island. Remnants of beaver dams number in the hundreds across the archipelago. Gnawed stumps and beaver sign are now seen on Orcas and other islands, and recolonization by this keystone species is {{likely to lead to}} increased abundance and diversity of birds, amphibians, reptiles and plants. In spring, 2011 a pair of beaver appeared at Killebrew Lake on Orcas Island, but were killed to avoid flooding a phone company <b>switch</b> <b>box</b> buried under Dolphin Bay Road. These beaver likely swam from the mainland and could have recolonized the islands.|$|E
2500|$|Another, different, bit {{also called}} an {{installer}} bit {{has a very}} long flexible shaft, typically up to [...] long, with a small twist bit at the end. The shaft is made of spring steel instead of hardened steel, {{so it can be}} flexed while drilling without breaking. This allows the bit to be curved inside walls, for example to drill through studs from a light <b>switch</b> <b>box</b> without needing to remove any material from the wall. These bits usually come with a set of special tools to aim and flex the bit to reach the desired location and angle, although the problem of seeing where the operator is drilling still remains.|$|E
50|$|Switch {{panels and}} <b>switch</b> <b>boxes.</b> Colored <b>switches,</b> when active, will {{activate}} platforms that may {{move across the}} field or that increase height, while deactivating a switch will cause these platforms {{to return to their}} original position. Floor panels are active by stepping on them or placing a box on them, while <b>switch</b> <b>boxes</b> require a laser beam to hit them.|$|R

40|$|According to the ITRS predictions, {{controlling}} manufacturing yield {{is going}} to be a challenging task in future technologies. The effective yield of future FPGA architectures considering configurable logic blocks, <b>switch</b> <b>boxes,</b> connection boxes and routing segments is estimated in this paper. The results show that some degree of redundancy for logic blocks, routing and <b>switch</b> <b>boxes</b> is necessary. However, no more than one spare logic block per cluster, and at most one spare wire is required to obtain a satisfactory effective yield. The results also indicate that it is beneficial to increase logic cluster size of future FPGA architectures for better yield. 1...|$|R
2500|$|Lt. Timmermann, who {{had been}} born in Frankfurt am Main about [...] from their position, was the first American officer to cross the bridge. Following him, Sgt. Dorland reached the far shore and {{destroyed}} the main demolition <b>switch</b> <b>box.</b> Sgt. DeLisio captured a German machine gun team in the eastern tower. The rest of A/27 AIB followed them, and after the eastern shore was initially secured, Lt. Mott led B Company, 9th Engineers, in finding and eliminating more live demolition charges on the bridge. A platoon led by Lt. Emmett Burrows climbed Erpeler Ley and cleared out the snipers, after which he and his men were hit by concentrated artillery and mortar fire. They then climbed down the hill towards the town to the far entrance of the railroad tunnel.|$|E
50|$|Whenever a {{vertical}} and a horizontal channel intersect, {{there is a}} <b>switch</b> <b>box.</b> In this architecture, when a wire enters a <b>switch</b> <b>box,</b> there are three programmable switches that allow it to connect to three other wires in adjacent channel segments. The pattern, or topology, of switches used in this architecture is the planar or domain-based <b>switch</b> <b>box</b> topology. In this <b>switch</b> <b>box</b> topology, a wire in track number one connects only to wires in track number one in adjacent channel segments, wires in track number 2 connect only to other wires in track number 2 and so on. The figure on the right illustrates the connections in a <b>switch</b> <b>box.</b>|$|E
50|$|Generally, the FPGA routing is unsegmented. That is, each wiring segment spans {{only one}} logic block before it terminates in a <b>switch</b> <b>box.</b> By turning {{on some of}} the {{programmable}} switches within a <b>switch</b> <b>box,</b> longer paths can be constructed. For higher speed interconnect, some FPGA architectures use longer routing lines that span multiple logic blocks.|$|E
25|$|Elsewhere {{at the end}} of June, {{telephone}} and optic fiber cables were cut, causing service losses to over 300,000 customers and half of the island's ATMs. A telephone <b>switching</b> <b>box</b> in Cayey and a telephone booth in Mayag√ºez were also set on fire.|$|R
5000|$|A 3-conductor cable (not {{including}} an extra fourth conductor for the 'safety ground') {{is needed to}} connect all the <b>switch</b> <b>boxes</b> in a single line, starting from one 3-way switch, then to each multiway switch, and then terminating at the other 3-way switch.|$|R
50|$|The 2-conductors {{from the}} mains can enter your multiway setup {{at any of}} the <b>switch</b> <b>boxes,</b> or even at the box for the load. The box closest to the mains is {{typically}} the one that receives the two conductors from the 'mains'.|$|R

50|$|Jawa 250 type 559 (known popularly as Panelk) was a {{standard}} motorcycle made by Jawa Motors from 1962 to 1974. It {{was preceded by}} the Jawa 250/353, and its successor was the Jawa 250/592. This was the first 250 cc model to be called Panelka. The Panelka series had the headlamp top nacelle stretched {{to the end of}} the handlebar with an oval speedometer instead of a circular speedometer on the headlamp top nacelle. For better security, the FAB <b>switch</b> <b>box</b> was used, whereas in the previous models a PAL <b>switch</b> <b>box</b> with nail type keys were being used. As in the previous models the rear tail lamp was made of translucent red plastic.|$|E
50|$|A {{digital system}} usually {{requires}} {{a central unit}} to generate digital address and command signals, most central units also incorporate one or more locomotive controllers and a booster unit to generate the power necessary to run locomotives.
