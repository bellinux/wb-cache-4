50|$|While most {{processors}} use {{a hydraulic}} chainsaw bar {{to cut the}} logs to length, some use a very large circular saw blade called a <b>slasher</b> <b>blade.</b> They are fast and efficient, requiring little maintenance once set up properly. While the safety of slasher blades has been proven over decades, {{there are a number}} of people who will not walk within 50 ft of one. The more traditional chainsaw bar setup requires constant oiling and frequent maintenance, but it is simple and familiar work.|$|E
5000|$|The log is sawn {{by either}} a {{hydraulically}} operated chainsaw harvester bar, or on larger machines, {{a very large}} circular saw <b>blade</b> (<b>slasher</b> saw), or a guillotine powered either directly from a pto (tractor or engine powered) or by hydraulics. When the cut is completed, the [...] "round" [...] drops into position to be split in the next process. In some guillotine splitters the wood is split as the wood is cut.|$|R
