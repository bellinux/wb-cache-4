5|$|The subpoenas are {{handed out}} in the hearing over Bartlet's {{concealment}} of his multiple sclerosis. The special prosecutor, Clement Rollins (Pryor), appears to be both fair and responsible, but C.J. believes the White House will be better served {{in the public eye}} if investigated by a partisan agent. She therefore decides—against the strong objections of White House counsel Oliver Babish—to present Rollins as an ally of the administration, thereby forcing Congress to take control over the investigation. Meanwhile Donna, unwittingly, becomes entangled in potential problems over the hearings. Ainsley Hayes sets her up on a date with the Republican House Government Oversight Committee counsel Clifford Calley, but even though the date <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> well, Calley then leaves her quite abruptly {{in the middle of the}} street. Donna later realizes the reason: his congressional committee is the one that will be in charge of the investigation, and a relationship between the two could constitute a conflict of interest.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of a plane accident that killed Sloan and Lexie Grey (Chyler Leigh), Torres is forced to make the decision to have Alex Karev amputate Robbins's left leg to keep her alive, which puts strains on their relationship. The hospital is sued and eventually found guilty of negligence. Each victim, including Robbins, Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey), Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo), and Cristina Yang (Sandra Oh) must receive $15 million of compensation, which leads the hospital to a near bankruptcy as the insurances refuse to pay. These doctors and Torres buy the hospital {{with the help of the}} Harper-Avery Foundation to prevent it from closing, and each become members of the new directing board. Everything <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> well for Arizona and Callie, until a big storm hits the hospital now named after Mark Sloan and Lexie Grey. In the last episode of the ninth season, Arizona cheats on Callie with Dr. Lauren Boswell (Hilarie Burton). Callie soon discovers Arizona's infidelity by seeing her wedding ring pinned to Dr. Boswell's scrub top. In {{the aftermath}} of discovery, both Callie and Arizona share their feelings and it is revealed that Arizona does not forgive Callie for making the call to amputate her leg. Callie is heartbroken and Arizona states that Callie lost nothing in the crash, to which Callie responds that she, apparently, lost Arizona.|$|E

25|$|Concerning {{the troops}} types, {{it is unknown}} {{whether or not the}} Persian {{infantry}} engaged in the battle. It is most likely Cyrus and the cavalry he had escaped with from Media fought directly with the Median cavalry Astyages had sent to bring Cyrus back. Cyrus might have known he needed all his men when fighting Astyages's best cavalry, for when battle had started, Cyrus with his will and superior numbers had the advantage. Nicolas goes as far as to say Cyrus first displayed his bravery in this battle. Nevertheless, Cyrus's tactics proved successful in maintaining the war. In Herodotus' Histories, he hints the first battle between the Persians and Medes, which Harpagus goes over to Cyrus, and most of the Medes either joined Cyrus or were killed, with a small force escaping back to Media. This <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> in accordance with Nicolaus' account of the first battle.|$|E
25|$|Harold is aghast, worried if {{the foreign}} police will believe the story {{both he and}} Elsie have to tell and that their 'relationship' is innocent. The {{evidence}} points to manslaughter at best and murder at worst. Mrs Rice suddenly has an idea and wonders if the hotel management and foreign police are open to bribery. Harold agrees {{to give it a}} try and wires for money but aside from that, and unable to speak the local language, leaves Mrs Rice to carry out the negotiations. All <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> well and the next day Harold sees Mrs Rice speaking with a police officer and she tells him that the death has been declared as being from natural causes and that they are all in the clear. That is until the two Polish women approach Mrs Rice and speak to her. She translates for Harold and tells him that they know what really happened (their room being next to Elsie's) and that they are blackmailing the English people.|$|E
500|$|The exact {{meaning of}} the name [...] "antlion" [...] is uncertain. It has been thought to refer to ants forming a large {{percentage}} of the prey of the insect, the suffix [...] "lion" [...] merely suggesting destroyer or hunter. In any case, the term <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> back to classical antiquity. The antlion larva is often called a [...] "doodlebug" [...] in North America because of the odd winding, spiralling trails it leaves in the sand while relocating, which look as if someone has been doodling.|$|E

500|$|Sue's {{sudden change}} of {{behavior}} in this episode caused Kubicek to ask {{when she had}} become [...] "the moral compass on this show", and Bell wondered, [...] "how does Ryan Murphy expect us to like a character that continually changes", given that whenever she <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> [...] "in a new direction, she heads back to her same glee club-hating ways". Kubicek also made that point that while [...] "Sam and Quinn seemingly {{did the right thing}} by choosing the shelter over the special", the others did eventually show up, which [...] "muddled" [...] the message.|$|E

During his voiceover session, he noted, [...] "I always find voice work really fascinating because you are working on one element of your make up as an actor—focusing more intently on one part of your toolbox if you like—in a way so everything <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> into producing that vocal effect. It really isn’t just an effect, because it actually comes from a source which is a true continuation of that character." ...|$|E
500|$|Some {{critics were}} less {{enthusiastic}} about the episode. Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club gave it a B+ grade; he praised the horror sequences in the episode, but called the character development [...] "tepid". [...] "At the very least", he wrote, [...] "the show does a fine job working within its restrictions. There {{are a handful of}} absolutely top-notch set pieces in , starting with an attack on the highway that <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> on forever." [...] Alex Hanno of The Tufts Daily felt that, although entertaining, the plot lacked [...] "a much needed rush of energy". He gave it 3.5 out of 5 stars. Likewise, Nick Venable of Cinema Blend wrote: [...] "I won't say I got bored, but much of the episode left me unmoved, and far less tense than I should have been." ...|$|E

500|$|Romantic {{notions of}} the 1920s as a more {{innocent}} period are put aside in favor of depicting Los Angeles as ruled by a despotic political infrastructure, steeped in sadistic, systematic corruption throughout the city government, police force and medical establishment. In {{addition to being a}} Kafkaesque drama about the search for a missing child, the film also focuses on issues relevant to the modern era. Eastwood noted a correlation between the corruption of 1920s Los Angeles and that of the modern era, manifesting in the egos of a police force that thinks it cannot be wrong {{and the way in which}} powerful organizations justify the use of corruption. [...] " [...] Los Angeles police department every so often <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> into a period of corruption," [...] he said, [...] "It's happened even in recent years... so it was nice to comment [...] by going back to real events in 1928." [...] Eastwood said that Los Angeles had always been seen as [...] "glamorous", but he believed there had never been a [...] "golden age" [...] in the city. In Changeling, this dissonance manifests in the actions of Arthur Hutchins, who travels to the city in the hope of meeting his favorite actor. Eastwood said that given the corruption that the story covers, Hutchins' naïvete seemed [...] "bizarre". As a lesson in democratic activism, the film shows what it takes to provoke people to speak against unchecked authority, no matter the consequences. Richard Brody of The New Yorker said this rang as true for 1928 Los Angeles as it did for Poland in 1980 or Pakistan in 2008. The film directly quotes Chief of police James E. Davis: [...] "We will hold trial on gunmen in the streets of Los Angeles. I want them brought in dead, not alive, and I will reprimand any officer who shows the least bit of mercy to a criminal." [...] It compares police excess to the vigilantism of the Ku Klux Klan of the 1920s, as the department's [...] "Gun Squad" [...] carries out illegal executions of criminals—"not to stamp out crime... but 'competition. The pressure from the police hierarchy was a motivator for officers to quickly solve Walter Collins' disappearance, and a potential reason why they ignored the fact they had returned the wrong child.|$|E

[...] For example, in Thomas Otway's comedy The Soldier's Fortune (1681) a character says: [...] "Be sure they be lewd, drunken, stripping whores".

2500|$|The album {{combines}} R and hip hop {{sounds from}} her previous albums {{along with a}} new pop and dance direction. Fantasy Ride received generally mixed reviews from music critics, who complimented its slow jams and the club tracks, and Ciara's vocal performances, with some critics calling it [...] "a consistently sexy listen" [...] with other critics calling it [...] "Ciara's smoothest ride ever". However, some critics found the album to be a [...] "dud" [...] and others saying [...] "Ciara <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> almost unnoticed". The album debuted at number three on US Billboard 200, with sales of 81,000.

2500|$|The three sitting {{statues of}} Kannon that the Main Hall enshrines are the temple's main object of worship. The statue {{on the left}} is {{supposedly}} the one Gyōki built, but it appears to belong rather to the late Heian period (from 794 to 1185). In spite of its dubious attribution, the statue is a city Important Cultural Asset. The one in the middle is the statue said to have been made by Ennin, which also <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> back only to the late Heian period and is a national Important Cultural Asset. The one on the right is the statue traditionally attributed to Genshin, which has been dated {{to the middle of the}} Kamakura period and is far too young to really be by him.

2500|$|Despite any {{difficulties}} that his suspected Communist sympathies might have posed, Copland traveled extensively during the 1950s and early 60s {{to observe the}} avant-garde styles of Europe, hear compositions by Soviet composers not {{well known in the}} West and experience the new school of Polish music. While in Japan, he was taken with the work of Toru Takemitsu and began a correspondence with him that would last over the next decade. Copland revised his text [...] "The New Music" [...] with comments on the styles that he encountered. He found much of what he heard dull and impersonal. Electronic music seemed to have [...] "a depressing sameness of sound," [...] while aleatoric music was for those [...] "who enjoy teetering on the edge of chaos."

2500|$|The {{practice}} of [...] "chrismation" [...] (baptism with oil) {{appears to have}} developed {{in the early church}} during the later 2nd century as a symbol of Christ, rebirth, and inspiration.

In it, he calls the act [...] "sweet and useful", punning on khristós ( [...] , [...] "anointed") and khrēstós ( [...] , [...] "useful"). He <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> on to say [...] "wherefore we are called Christians on this account, because we are anointed with the oil of God", and [...] "what person on entering into this life or being an athlete is not anointed with oil?" [...] The practice is also defended by Hippolytus in his [...] "Commentary on the Song of Songs" [...] and by Origen in his [...] "Commentary on Romans". Origen opines that [...] "all of us may be baptized in those visible waters and in a visible anointing, in accordance with the form handed down to the churches".|$|E
