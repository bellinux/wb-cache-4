Her wreck was discovered in the Mississippi River in New Orleans in 2003, although there are no plans to raise her.|$|E
5|$|<b>Sometime</b> <b>during</b> {{their journey}} or their {{stay in the}} region, Rebmann and Krapf learned of a great {{mountain}} referred to as 'Kilimansharo', which reached the clouds and which was 'capped in silver'. The two men, like most Europeans at the time, were {{under the impression that}} snow and ice could not exist so close to the equator, and failed to realize the significance of the mountain being 'topped with silver'.|$|E

5|$|During the war, the ship's light {{anti-aircraft}} armament was augmented several times. Improved 2cm C/38 guns {{replaced the}} original C/30 guns and three additional guns were added sometime in 1941. The two {{guns on the}} aft shelter deck were replaced by a single 2cm quadruple Flakvierling mount, probably <b>sometime</b> <b>during</b> 1942. It is not certain if the improved 3.7cm SK M/42 gun replaced her original 3.7cm guns, but Theodor Riedel had one quadruple, two twin and six single mounts for 2cm guns {{by the end of}} the war.|$|E
5|$|Giant mouse lemurs begin {{foraging}} {{moments before}} the sun disappears, occasionally participate in social activities during {{the last half of}} the night, and return to one of their nests prior to sunrise. Cold temperatures cause them to leave the nest later and return early, <b>sometime</b> <b>during</b> the second half of the night. During the first half of the night, giant mouse lemurs are more likely to rest for an hour or more, usually at the expense of social activities, but not feeding time. Rest periods are longer when temperatures are low. Unlike many other cheirogaleids, they remain active all year and do not enter daily or seasonal torpor.|$|E
5|$|Grissom's {{spacecraft}} {{was recovered}} in 1999, but no further evidence was found which could conclusively {{explain how the}} explosive hatch release had occurred. Later, Guenter Wendt, pad leader for the early American manned space launches, wrote that he believed a small cover over the external release actuator was accidentally lost <b>sometime</b> <b>during</b> the flight or splashdown, and the T-handle may have been tugged by a stray parachute suspension line, or was perhaps damaged by the heat of re-entry and, after cooling upon splashdown, contracted and fired.|$|E

5|$|On {{becoming}} king in 548, Thurisind immediately {{found himself}} in a difficult situation. <b>Sometime</b> <b>during</b> 546–548, the Byzantine Empire had conspired to convince the Lombards under Audoin to move into Pannonia (modern Hungary), a former Roman province bordering the Danube river. Justinian hoped this would keep open the land route from the Balkans to Italy while containing the Gepids, who he considered a serious menace to Byzantine interests on the Balkan frontier. The Gothic War between the Ostrogoths and the Byzantines had been raging on the Italian peninsula since 535; Justinian {{wanted to be able to}} rush troops to Italy if they were needed.|$|E
5|$|Scholars {{believe that}} stichometry became {{established}} in Athens <b>sometime</b> <b>during</b> the 5th century BCE when copying prose works became common. Stichometry is mentioned briefly in Plato's Laws (c. 347 BCE), {{several times in}} Isocrates (early to mid-4th century), and in Theopompus (late 4th to early 3rd century), but these casual references suggest the practice was already routine. The same standard line was used for stichometry among the Greeks and Romans for about a thousand years until stichometry apparently fell out of use among the Byzantine Greeks in the Middle Ages as page numbers became more common.|$|E
5|$|<b>Sometime</b> <b>during</b> the 20th or 21st Dynasty Amenhotep's {{original}} tomb {{was either}} robbed or deemed insecure and emptied {{and his body}} was moved for safety, probably more than once. It {{was found in the}} Deir el-Bahri Cache, hidden with the mummies of numerous New Kingdom kings and nobles in or after the late 22nd dynasty above the Mortuary Temple of Hatshepsut and is now in the Egyptian Museum in Cairo. His mummy had apparently not been looted by the 21st dynasty, and the priests who moved the mummy took care to keep the Cartonnage intact. Because of that exquisite face mask, Amenhotep's is the only royal mummy which has not been unwrapped and examined by modern Egyptologists.|$|E

50|$|In general, marine iguanas live in colonies, but {{adult males}} defend territories {{for up to}} 3 months during the {{breeding}} season. Fights between males <b>sometime</b> occur <b>during</b> the breeding season and may last for hours. Nevertheless, the fights are generally harmless; males will bob their heads as a threat and if the other suitor responds, both will thrust their heads together until one backs away.|$|R

5|$|The Fortifications Interpretation Centre (FIC) is {{a public}} {{institution}} dedicated to communicating and exhibiting Malta's military architecture. It {{is located in a}} building adjoining Saint Andrew's Bastion, part of the city walls of Valletta. The building was originally a bombproof magazine and artillery school that was built <b>sometime</b> <b>during</b> the reign of Hugues Loubenx de Verdalle in the late 16th century. The uppermost floor had been destroyed in World War II {{and the rest of the}} building was subsequently used as an examination hall. The building was restored and the upper floor rebuilt in a project co-financed by the European Regional Development Fund, and the FIC was opened on 16 February 2013.|$|E
5|$|The Qing state's main shamanistic ritual was {{performed}} at the tangse by the emperor {{on the first day}} of the New Year. In the Shunzhi (1644–1661), Kangxi (1662–1722), and Yongzheng (1723–1735) eras, this ceremony was the emperor's first activity {{on the first day of}} the New Year, but <b>sometime</b> <b>during</b> the Qianlong era (1736–1796) it fell to the second rank after private sacrifices to the Aisin Gioro ancestors. Even with this somewhat diminished importance, these shamanic rites continued to the end of the dynasty.|$|E

Amongst this, Elphin interjected {{that he had a}} wife who is even more chaste than the King's and that he also had a bard who is more {{proficient}} than all of the king's bards combined. When the king heard of this boast from his companions, he was very angry and imprisoned Elphin.|$|R

5|$|The exact {{date that}} Burebista came to reign over the Dacians is debated among sources; University of Illinois {{professor}} Keith Hitchins give a starting date for Burebista's reign of 82 BC, while historian Matthew Bunson, and authors John Middleton and Michael Schmitz suggest a starting date around 61–60 BC. The historian John Koch states that Burebista founded an empire <b>sometime</b> <b>during</b> the 1st century BC and that around 61 BC Burebista expelled the Celts {{and moved into}} the middle Danube.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} morning, {{at first}} light, {{spurred on by}} the example provided by 11 Platoon, reinforcements from the 2/48th came up to complete the capture of Sattelberg. Just after dawn, a heavy artillery barrage was brought down on the summit by Australian artillery {{in preparation for the}} final attack. At 8:25am patrols were sent out from 'B' Company, 2/48th Battalion, and they subsequently reported that the Japanese had abandoned the position <b>sometime</b> <b>during</b> the night. Indeed, it was later established that Miyake, who had been in command of the troops gathered around the mission and had been given permission to abandon Sattelberg if the situation became untenable, had decided to withdraw from the position soon after Derrick's attack.|$|E
5|$|The {{libraries}} of Europe contain many medieval {{copies of}} ancient Greek and Latin texts. Many of these contain short notes or 'subscriptions' {{on the final}} page that, in hundreds of cases, give {{the total number of}} lines in the work. In texts of classical authors such as Herodotus and Demosthenes, these totals are expressed in the older, acrophonic numerals that were used in Athens during the classical period but abandoned <b>sometime</b> <b>during</b> the Hellenistic period. Thus these stichometric totals are thought to descend, along with the content of the texts, from very early editions.|$|E
50|$|In urban areas, the dugnad is most {{commonly}} identified with outdoor spring cleaning and gardening in housing co-operatives. Dugnader, Dugnads, {{are also a}} big phenomenon in kindergartens and elementary schools to make the area nice, clean and safe and to do decorating etc. such as painting {{and other types of}} maintenance. Dugnader occur more widely in remote and rural areas. Neighbours <b>sometime</b> participate <b>during</b> house or garage building, and organizations (such as kindergartens or non-profit organisations) may arrange annual dugnader.|$|R
50|$|Professor Aikens {{emphasized}} {{in his book}} that Hogup Cave {{was only one of}} the settlements that were occupied {{during the course of a}} seasonal round, with the whereabouts of the <b>sometime</b> occupants <b>during</b> the rest of their economic cycle being unknown. Aikens pointed out that his study defined only a part of the total cultural system. Therefore, he proposed that to understand fully the changing systems of cultural ecology, those sites which had other activities had to be found and excavated.|$|R
5000|$|Dismissing {{completely}} 17th to 19th century {{ideas of}} a Canaanite, Assyrian, Indian or Macedonian origin, Nefiodkin also challenges Xenophon's attribution of scythed chariots {{to the first}} Persian king Cyrus, pointing to their notable absence in the invasion of Greece (480−479 BC) {{by one of his}} successors, Xerxes I. Instead, he argues that the Persians introduced scythed chariots <b>sometime</b> later <b>during</b> the Greco-Persian Wars, between 467 BC and 458 BC, as a response to their experience fighting against Greek heavy infantry.|$|R
