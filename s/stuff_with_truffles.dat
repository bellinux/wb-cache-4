In Heaven, there was neither soda-water nor biscuits.

Bertolini was the only man who ever caught the tournure of your shoulders, and yet I am not {{altogether}} satisfied with his work. So, you are going to dine with that good Neuchatel. Remember me kindly to him. There are few men I like better. He is so sensible, knows so much, and so much of what is going on. I should have liked very much to have dined with him, but he is aware of my unfortunate state. Besides, my dear, if I were better I should not have enough strength for his dinners. They are really banquets; I cannot stand those ortolans <b>stuffed</b> <b>with</b> <b>truffles</b> and those <b>truffles</b> <b>stuffed</b> <b>with</b> ortolans. Perhaps he will come and dine with us some day off a joint." ...|$|R
2500|$|The term à la Maréchale ("marshal-style") denotes in French cookery tender {{pieces of}} meat, such as cutlets, escalopes, sweetbreads, or chicken breasts, which are treated à l'anglaise ("English-style"), i.e. coated with eggs and breadcrumbs, and sautéed. Numerous recipes of such dishes, {{some of them}} with stuffings, are {{described}} both in Western and Russian cookbooks of the 19th century. Among the stuffed versions, on finds a recipe for a [...] "fowl fillet à la Maréchale" [...] <b>stuffed</b> <b>with</b> <b>truffles</b> and herbs in The Art of French Cuisine of the 19th Century (1847) by Marie-Antoine Carême, and a similar filet de poulets à la Maréchale with herbs and forcemeat in La cuisine classique (1868) by Urbain Dubois. Elena Molokhovets' A Gift to Young Housewives, the most successful Russian cookbook of the 19th century, has included since its first edition in 1861 an elaborate recipe for [...] "hazel grouse à la Maréchale" [...] <b>stuffed</b> <b>with</b> madeira sauce, portobello mushrooms and truffles.|$|R

60|$|It {{was at this}} {{dinner that}} Mr. Gladstone had his first {{opportunity}} of making a remarkable acquaintance. In his diary he mentions as present three of the judges, the flower of the bench, as he supposes, but he says not a word of {{the man of the}} strangest destiny there, the author of Vivian Grey. Disraeli himself, {{in a letter to his}} sister, names 'young Gladstone,' and others, but condemns the feast as rather dull, and declares that a swan very white and tender, and <b>stuffed</b> <b>with</b> <b>truffles,</b> was the best company at the table. What Mr. Gladstone carried away in his memory was a sage lesson of Lyndhurst's, by which the two men of genius at his table were in time to show themselves extremely competent to profit,--'Never defend yourself before a popular assemblage, except with and by retorting the attack; the hearers, in the pleasure which the assault gives them, will forget the previous charge.' As Disraeli himself put it afterwards, Never complain and never explain.|$|R
50|$|En vessie {{refers to}} a cooking method in which a meat or other dish is cooked in a (pig) bladder. A {{well-known}} application is with Bresse chicken: Poularde de Bresse en vessie; a prepared chicken is <b>stuffed</b> <b>with</b> foie gras, <b>truffles,</b> and other flavorings, then enclosed in the bladder and poached in chicken broth. The advantage of the method is that the meat does not {{come into contact with}} the cooking liquid; in Poularde de Bresse en vessie, the juices from the chicken all stay in the chicken, and turn into a flavorful jelly if the dish is served cold. The meat remains extremely moist. It has been likened to the cooking method of sous vide where meat is vacuum packed and cooked slowly in a water bath. A similar effect can be achieved by wrapping chicken in aluminum foil.|$|R
500|$|Despite {{the large}} number of unusual dishes, Schwa is perhaps best known for Carlson's simple, modern {{interpretation}} of Italian classics. Among the most popular dishes is the quail egg ravioli, which has been on the menu since day one. [...] Considered the restaurant's signature dish, it consists of a single ravioli <b>stuffed</b> <b>with</b> quail egg yolk and laced <b>with</b> <b>truffle</b> butter. [...] Schwa is known for emphasizing locally grown produce, and many dishes feature organic ingredients. [...] However, The Local Beet (a website that promotes eating locally grown food) questioned Schwa's commitment to the principle, noting the use of out-of-season strawberries and peas. Most dishes are served with purées.|$|R
