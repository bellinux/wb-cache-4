The power per unit gate width obtainable from GaN and AlGaN SITs are approximately the same, but the maximum power handling capacity of the AlGaN SIT is significantly higher due to bigger optimum load resistance.

The on-voltage Von of Si-IGBT degraded excessively at the early stage of the irradiation (>~ 0. 1 MGy(SiO 2)) due to the bulk damage produced by Compton electrons like the gain degradation in Si bipolar transistors. The threshold voltage Vth of Si-MOSFET was very sensitive against the radiation due to the competing mechanism between the generation of the hole traps in the gate SiO 2 and the SiO 2 /Si interface states. Moreover, the breakdown voltage VBR and leak current Ileak of MOSFET degraded significantly against the absorbed dose.

The turn-off behaviors also depend on the operation temperature, especially for long WS. On the other hand, the turn-on behaviors hardly depend on the WS and temperature...|$|R

The point of the SIT is that it behaves like a triode but at lower voltages and higher currents, so it doesn't need a matching transformer to deliver power to 8 Ohms. Like tubes, SITs have soft overload clipping. When brief bursts of musical energy occur, SITs react with rounded waveform tops instead of sharp and hard clipping of solid-state. SITs have a curve which looks a lot like a triode vacuum tube; low at first and climbs steadily.

At zero gate bias, the gate p-n junction depletion layers extend far enough into the conduction channel {{to cut off the}} channel. Application of forward gate bias narrows the depletion regions, opening up the channel to conduction by majority carriers. In the present devices, narrow vertical channels get pinched by depletion regions from opposite sides. Since the material is SiC, the devices are usable at temperatures above 150 C. Static curve and pulse mode switching observations were done at selected temperatures up to 200 C on a device with average static characteristics from a batch of similar devices.
