5|$|The Qing Emperor's {{undercover}} emissary Jack Knife {{arrives in}} the village to monitor the gold and takes up residence in the Pink Blossom, a brothel run by Madam Blossom, Lady Silk's madame. Silver sends members of the Rodent clan to kill Zen-Yi before he can reach the village, but Zen-Yi kills them. The mercenary Brass Body {{arrives in the}} village and meets with Silver; he is sent to kill Zen-Yi. The blacksmith meets with Silk in the brothel and delivers the final payment needed to free her. After arriving in the village, Zen-Yi and his men are confronted by Brass and find that they cannot physically harm him because his skin turns to metal on impact. Brass beats Zen-Yi and destroys his blade-laden armor. Zen-Yi's last surviving man sacrifices himself to pull a canopy <b>support</b> <b>beam</b> loose, burying Brass under heavy stone. The blacksmith is watching the fight; he rescues Zen-Yi and helps him recover as penance for crafting the weapon that killed Zen-Yi's father.|$|E
25|$|The passage was {{a miserable}} one, with huge waves {{constantly}} crashing against the ship's topside deck until a key structural support timber fractured. The passengers had already suffered agonizing delays, shortages of food, and other shortages, {{and were now}} called upon to provide assistance to the ship's carpenter in repairing the fractured main <b>support</b> <b>beam.</b> This was repaired {{with the use of}} a metal mechanical device called a jackscrew, which had been loaded on board to help in the construction of settler homes. It was now used to secure the beam to keep it from cracking further, making the ship seaworthy enough.|$|E

External timber stairs survive, and rooftop fittings that formerly carried a camouflage netted structure. The upper level contains original timber joinery to observation slit and doorway and four intact concrete mounting blocks, possibly for a vertical rangefinder. The lower level comprises one large room with steel-reinforced concrete <b>support</b> <b>beam</b> and pillar beneath the mounting blocks in the upper level. Both levels contain evidence of a later interior fitout as residential accommodation.|$|E

Model <b>supporting</b> <b>beams</b> with three different forms of section were designed based on standard MIRA model. The commercial CFD software- Ansys Fluent was used to simulate the three-dimensional flow field around the standard MIRA model installed with three different kinds of <b>supporting</b> <b>beams.</b> With comparisons between the drag coefficients, pressure distributions and velocity distributions around the wheels with the different <b>supporting</b> <b>beams,</b> the reasons for the differences in aerodynamics are analyzed and advices were given for helping choosing the <b>supporting</b> <b>beam</b> with minimal disturbance to reduce the correction error...|$|R
30|$|Simply <b>supported</b> <b>beam</b> bridges {{are widely}} used in the {{construction}} of passenger dedicated lines in China because of their characteristics of simple structure, clear path for force transfer, low cost, easy manufacturing and installing techniques [1, 2]. After long-term research in design and application, the system of simply <b>supported</b> <b>beam</b> bridges (20, 24 and 32  m in span) for Chinese passenger dedicated line was formed [3, 4]. According to statistical data, the total kilometrage of simply <b>supported</b> <b>beam</b> bridges is {{more than half of the}} total length of high-speed railways in China, and the most widely used is the 32  m simply <b>supported</b> <b>beam.</b> Thus, ensuring the service performance of continuous welded rail (CWR) on the simply <b>supported</b> <b>beam</b> bridge is essential for safe operation of railways.|$|R
40|$|A novel, {{suspended}} {{thin film}} bulk acoustic wave resonator (SFBAR) has been fabricated from an aluminum nitride film sputtered directly on a (100) silicon Substrate. The suspended membrane design uses thin <b>beams</b> to <b>support,</b> {{as well as}} electrically connect, the resonator and has been fabricated using both thin film processing and bulk silicon micromachining. The quality factor and the effective electromechanical coupling coefficient were characterized {{as a function of}} the number and the length of the <b>support</b> <b>beams.</b> The length of the <b>support</b> <b>beams</b> was found to affect neither the quality factor at resonance nor the effective electromechanical coupling factor. However, longer <b>support</b> <b>beams</b> did facilitate better frequency pair response. Device performance varied with the number of support beams: 70 % of the resonators tested showed a higher figure of merit with eight <b>support</b> <b>beams</b> than with four <b>support</b> <b>beams...</b>|$|R

500|$|In 1989, Lionel visits Smallville {{to buy the}} Ross Creamed Corn company {{immediately}} before a meteor shower occurs. Twelve years later during season one, Lionel exiles his son Lex Luthor (Michael Rosenbaum) to Smallville to run LuthorCorp's local fertilizer plant as a test. When Lex makes a profit {{for the first time}} in years, Lionel closes the plant and blames Lex's poor managerial skills. Lionel later confronts his son at the Luthor mansion when Lex tries to orchestrate an employee buyout to save the fertilizer plant. When strong winds force debris to smash through the mansion, Lionel is pinned under a fallen <b>support</b> <b>beam</b> and Lex hesitates to save his father. In Season two, Lex saves Lionel but loses his sight because of Lex's judgment to rush into surgery. Season two's first half shows Lionel as blind. Lex and Lucas Luthor (Paul Wasilewski)—Lionel's illegitimate son—devise a plan to uncover Lionel's deception; it is revealed that Lionel was blind but that his eyes healed and he intentionally neglected to tell anyone so he could watch how they acted around him. Season two's second half shows Lionel is aware of the Kawatche caves and tries to unlock the mysterious symbols there, to the dismay of Clark Kent (Tom Welling).|$|E
500|$|This episode {{featured}} {{a lot of}} character development {{that many of the}} actors had been waiting for. Lana's jealousy over Clark and Chloe going to the prom begins to come out; although Kristin Kreuk believes that Lana {{does not want to be}} jealous, and wants to be able to support Clark with his newfound feelings for Chloe. According to Eric Johnson, Whitney finally gets to show a side of himself that Johnson wishes the audience would have been able to see sooner, as Whitney gives Lana a private dance before the prom knowing that she will not be able to go because he is leaving town. To add further depth to his character not previously seen, Millar and Gough decided to send Whitney off to war, instead of killing the character outright. The idea of sending Whitney off to war was something that came to Millar and Gough midway through the season. They knew they did not want to kill him, because they wanted the ability to bring him back at some point in the future, so they came up with this [...] "noble, heroic, send-off" [...] for the character. For Lex, this episode featured the moment when he finally began to contemplate what his life would be like if his father was no longer a part of it. As Rosenbaum sees it, the moment that Lex hesitates to free his father from the <b>support</b> <b>beam</b> that collapses on him is the moment that the audience gets to see a hint of the evil man they know Lex will one day become. This is a brief moment where Lex forgets who he is, and if he had let his father die he would have certainly made his [...] "turn to the dark side".|$|E
40|$|MEMS sensors usually work at {{frequencies}} {{well above}} 1 kHz. At these frequencies, <b>supporting</b> <b>beams</b> do not only {{contribute to the}} elasticity of the system but also to its inertia. However, the supporting beams' inertia is not equal to any modal mass since excitation frequency is not equal to any eigenfrequency of the <b>supporting</b> <b>beams.</b> Based on a FEA model of the <b>supporting</b> <b>beams</b> {{it is possible to}} determine this inertial contribution at any working frequency thus allowing to set up a simple lumped parameter model that correctly reproduces the dynamic behaviour of the device...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—The {{nonlinear}} {{dynamics of}} micromechanical oscil-lators are explored experimentally. Devices consist of singly and doubly <b>supported</b> Si <b>beams,</b> 200 nm thick and 35 μm long. When illuminated within a laser interference field, devices self-oscillate {{in their first}} bending mode due to feedback between laser heating and device displacement. Compressive prestress buckles doubly <b>supported</b> <b>beams</b> leading to a strong amplitude–frequency relationship. Significant frequency instability is seen in doubly <b>supported</b> devices. Self-resonant <b>beams</b> are also driven inertially with varying drive amplitude and frequency. Regions of primary, sub-, and superharmonic entrainment are measured. Statistics of primary entrainment are measured for low drive amplitudes, where the effects of frequency instability are measurable. Sub-and superharmonic entrainment are not seen in singly <b>supported</b> <b>beams.</b> A simple model is built to explain why high-order entrainment is seen only in doubly <b>supported</b> <b>beams.</b> Its analysis suggests that the strong amplitude–frequency relationship in doubly <b>supported</b> <b>beams</b> enables hysteresis, wide regions of primary entrainment, and high orders of sub- and superharmonic entrainment.

2500|$|On July 9, 2006, a {{vertical}} support timber cracked, leading to two more <b>support</b> <b>beam</b> failures. Together, these caused a slight {{dip in the}} track, creating a jarring [...] "pothole effect" [...] that injured 27 riders as they passed over, many in the neck and chest. About 17 injured were {{released from the hospital}} within five hours. Others were kept overnight. None of the injuries were life-threatening. The ride reopened on July 4, 2007, with various changes. The loop was removed to allow for lighter trains and a smoother ride, according to park officials.|$|E

Julian, a Cheyenne, Wyoming architect, {{designed}} the contraption in 1892. The trap door was connected to a lever which pulled the plug out of a barrel of water. This would cause a lever with a counterweight to rise, pulling on the <b>support</b> <b>beam</b> under the gallows. When enough pressure was applied, the beam broke free, opening the trap and hanging the condemned man.|$|E

2500|$|Another {{point of}} {{contention}} was that Resnais had included photographs of French officers guarding a detention center where Jews were gathered before deportation, operated by the collaborationist Vichy government located in central France. This scene prompted a call demanding that the shot be cut because it [...] "might be offensive {{in the eyes of}} the present-day military". Resnais resisted this censorship, insisting that images of collaboration were important for the public to see. When Resnais refused to cut the French officer scene, the censors threatened to cut the last ten minutes of his film. Finally in compromise, Resnais stated that obscuring the contested scene would not change the meaning of the film to him, and he painted a fake <b>support</b> <b>beam</b> that obscured the distinctive képi the officer was wearing. In exchange, Resnais would be allowed to show the bodies of victims at the end of the film. The censored scene was restored to its original form for a 2003 DVD release.|$|E
2500|$|In {{what then}} Executive Director Paul Nicholson called the biggest {{crisis in the}} history of the Festival, a crack was {{discovered}} in the seventy-foot long, six and one-half foot high main ceiling <b>support</b> <b>beam</b> of the Bowmer Theatre two hours before 18 June 2011 matinee. [...] Shows were immediately relocated to other venues as work progressed to repair the beam. A 598-seat tent, [...] "Bowmer in the Park", was erected as a temporary replacement venue. [...] A single set was designed and built to serve four very different shows, and the shows themselves were re-staged while keeping the artistic vision of each as intact as possible. Thirty-one performances were given in the tent and averaged 82% of capacity generating approximately $650,000 in revenue against approximately $800,000 for the tent itself, $1,000,000 in lost revenue from ticket returns, and $330,000 in repair costs to the Bowmer. [...] The Bowmer reopened on 2 August, a month ahead of the initial estimate. The Festival filed an insurance claim for $3.58 million and received checks in March 2012 for $330,000 to cover the cost of repairs and $2.984 million covering much of the lost revenue, leaving only about $200,000 representing the cost of the temporary tent theater itself unresolved.|$|E
2500|$|In January 2004, the {{expressway}} {{was shut}} down between Lower Nazareth Township (Route 248) and Stockertown (Route 191) because of a sinkhole {{that was in the}} area of the Bushkill Creek directly under a northbound bridge <b>support</b> <b>beam.</b> [...] Crossovers were created, narrowing the highway to one lane in each direction through Stockertown. [...] Studies were conducted, and came to the conclusion that the bridge was dangerous and could not be fixed. [...] The northbound bridge was demolished in February of the same year. [...] Just 21 days later, a sinkhole was discovered under the southbound bridge over the Bushkill Creek, and resulted in the demolition of the southbound bridge. [...] Once the new northbound bridge was completed, another crossover was created, detouring southbound traffic onto the northbound side of the highway. [...] On April 21, 2004, a depression formed under the new northbound bridge, and the highway {{was shut down}} once again to fill the area with bituminous material. [...] The bridge re-opened within twenty minutes. [...] By November 19, 2004, both bridges were completed and opened. [...] All of this happened feet from the Bushkill Street Bridge, which connects Stockertown and Palmer Township, and has been closed since 1999 because of numerous sinkholes causing the bridge to collapse.|$|E
