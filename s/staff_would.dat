40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 50 - 55) The writer {{became interested}} in the subject of differentiated staffing upon hearing a lecture in 1970 given by Bruce C. Newlin, then the new Assistant Superintendent of Curriculum for the Lancaster School District, Lancaster, California. (Dr. Newlin is now Superintendent of the Lancaster School District.) Among other things, he made a statement somewhat to the effect that differentiated <b>staffing</b> <b>would</b> be a reality in the seventies. Certainly the concepts behind such a program were unfamiliar to the writer and many other teachers in Lancaster when the term itself had not been heard previously. Therefore, when the writer decided to write a graduate project in partial fulfillment of the requirement for the Master of Arts Degree in Education, it appeared that a study about differentiated <b>staffing</b> <b>would</b> be appropriate and worthwhile. At the date of this writing, the amount of literature on the subject was quite limited, and relatively few persons had reported on their districts' experience with differentiated staffin...|$|R
40|$|This article {{examines}} the social and business case for quality related to nursing {{and the need to}} restructure incentives to align the interests of the hospital and payers with the interests of the patients. Increasing the proportion of nurses who are registered nurses is associated with net cost savings. Increasing both nursing hours and the proportion of nurses who are registered nurses would result in improved quality and fewer deaths (creating a social case for improved <b>staffing)</b> but <b>would</b> be associated with small cost increases. Cost offsets associated with reduced turnover because of higher <b>staffing</b> <b>would</b> reduce the net cost increase but not result in savings. Under current reimbursement systems, hospitals that increase nurse staffing to improve patient outcomes will likely lose money as a result. Current proposals for pay for performance would create limited incentives for improving hospital nursing care...|$|R

Fourteen areas nevertheless joined the park system during his two years as director, including the first two national preserves.

For example, the naval detachments on Lake Ohrid and Lake Scutari were subordinated to the local army districts, and the Naval Coastal Command was subordinated to the Royal Yugoslav Army's Coastal Defence Command. In case of mobilisation, the navy would need to requisition about 250 sea-going and 25 river vessels.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{development}} of the strategically roles requires one paradigm shift to the program of training and development, {{so that it could}} be obtained the much deeper consideration to the purposes and goals of the development directions. The initial focus of the department of training and development was on the products. The <b>staffs</b> <b>would</b> develop the products as many as possible and offer those products to the organizations. It came to our mind, a little bit, if a program was needed or in reality, could be used. The objectives were to produce products as many as possible for being used by a group or an individual as many as possible. The shift of the training program was focused much more on the service aspect and it made the department of training and development experiencing much more progress. Here, the department of training and development emphasized that both products and services should comply with the form of actual needs of the users. The concept of the training program was the clients??? involvement, and the service aspect to the customers became the most important thing. With various types of well-identified customers, the <b>staffs</b> <b>would</b> focus much more on the efforts of assuring that all customers would be very much pleased with the products and services provided for the customers...|$|R

The orangery hides the view of the servants' quarters from the main house. The servants' quarters was revised and modernised in the 1840s. It contains the kitchen, dairy, bakehouse and several larders for raw and cooked meat. There is also a servants' hall where the <b>staff</b> <b>would</b> take their meals and a tenants' hall which was used by the tenant farmers to eat on the days when they came to pay their rent. In addition to the designs for the house, William Talman created the large 15-bay stable block. It is now used as a tea-room for visitors.|$|E

5|$|The line {{operated}} successfully and settlements of people {{attracted to the}} area {{by the prospect of}} employment in the mines grew around the Brendon ridge. However changes in the availability of imported ore made the mines a less attractive proposition and by 1883 the mines were closed and mineral traffic on the railway ceased. In 1879 the railway announced that the wages of all <b>staff</b> <b>would</b> be reduced. The passenger service continued until 7 November 1898; a brief resumption took place from 1907 (but not west of Brendon Hill) until final closure to passengers in 1910. The 1895 Bradshaw Railway Guide shows two return trips every day, at 09:15 and 15:10 from Watchet, calling at Washford, Roadwater and Comberow, taking 30 minutes; return trains were at 10:45 and 16:15, also taking 30 minutes.|$|E

5|$|The {{production}} facility for Daicon IV {{was in a}} dedicated studio in a building called the Hosei Kaikan that was owned by a textile union. Takeda defined it as a literal anime sweatshop, the building was shutdown at 9:00 pm {{and a majority of}} the <b>staff</b> <b>would</b> be locked inside and working through the night without air conditioning. The Daicon IV film officially credits a production crew of twelve people. Hiroyuki Yamaga directed the production of Daicon IV with Hideaki Anno and Takami Akai as animation directors. Toru Saegusa did the artwork and the animations were done with Yoshiyuki Sadamoto, Mahiro Maeda, Norifumi Kiyozumi; additional animation was provided by Ichiro Itano, Toshihiro Hirano, Narumi Kakinouchi, Sadami Morikawa, Kazutaka Miyatake. Originally, Daicon IV was supposed to be fifteen minutes long, but the difficult production resulted in the cut time.|$|E
5|$|The senior {{officers}} of the 1st Airborne Division had estimated {{that there would be}} around 450 casualties during the capture of the bridge, of which 25 per cent would be killed or missing, and the other 75 per cent wounded. It was appreciated that by themselves the three battalions' medical officers and <b>staff</b> <b>would</b> be unable to cope with the expected numbers of casualties, so one section from the 16th (Parachute) Field Ambulance, consisting of one doctor and 16 other ranks, would be attached to each of the parachute battalions. The remainder of the field ambulance, comprising the headquarters with two surgical teams, would be co-located with the brigade and establish their main dressing station in farm buildings to the south of the bridge.|$|E
5|$|MacArthur's {{next move}} was the {{invasion}} of Mindoro, where there were good potential airfield sites. Willoughby estimated, correctly as it turned out, that the island had only about 1,000 Japanese defenders. The problem this time was getting there. Kinkaid balked at sending escort carriers into the restricted waters of the Sulu Sea, and Kenney could not guarantee land based air cover. The operation was clearly hazardous, and MacArthur's staff talked him out of accompanying the invasion on Nashville. As the invasion force entered the Sulu Sea, a kamikaze struck Nashville, killing 133 people and wounding 190 more. Australian and American engineers had three airstrips in operation within two weeks, but the resupply convoys were repeatedly attacked by kamikazes. During this time, MacArthur quarreled with Sutherland, notorious for his abrasiveness, over the latter's mistress, Captain Elaine Clark. MacArthur had instructed Sutherland not to be bring Clark to Leyte, due to a personal undertaking to Curtin that Australian women on the GHQ <b>staff</b> <b>would</b> not {{be taken to the}} Philippines, but Sutherland had brought her along anyway.|$|E

5|$|On 26 September 1941, the General Staff for the People's Liberation Partisan Detachments of Yugoslavia held {{a conference}} at Stolice in the German-occupied {{territory}} of Serbia, {{at which it}} adopted a standard structure for the military organisation of the resistance. The General Staff was renamed the Supreme Staff, and the Military Staff of each province became the General Staff. The basic Partisan unit {{was to be a}} company of 80–100 soldiers, composed of platoons and sections. Two to four companies were to make up a battalion, and three to four battalions formed a detachment, the largest unit of the Partisan forces. Each detachment would have a staff consisting of a commander and deputy, with a political commissar and deputy, and the detachment <b>staff</b> <b>would</b> be directly responsible to the General Staff. On that basis, the existing Partisan units operating in Bosnia-Herzegovina were re-organised in October and November 1941 into ten detachments, six in east Bosnia, three in Bosanska Krajina, and one in Herzegovina. The Sarajevo and Tuzla Military Staffs were dissolved and detachments in those regions were placed under the direct control of the General Staff for the People's Liberation Partisan Detachments of Bosnia-Herzegovina.|$|E
5|$|Prior {{to their}} {{invasion}} of his country, the Germans had offered Andrić {{the opportunity to}} evacuate to neutral Switzerland. He declined {{on the basis that}} his <b>staff</b> <b>would</b> not be allowed to go with him. On 6 April 1941, the Germans and their allies invaded Yugoslavia. The country capitulated on 17 April and was subsequently partitioned between the Axis powers. In early June, Andrić and his staff were taken back to German-occupied Belgrade, where some were jailed. Andrić was retired from the diplomatic service, but refused to receive his pension or cooperate in any way with the puppet government the Germans had installed in Serbia. He was spared jail, but the Germans kept him under close surveillance throughout the occupation. Because of his Croat heritage, they had offered him the chance to settle in Zagreb, then the capital of the fascist puppet state known as the Independent State of Croatia, but he declined. Andrić spent the following three years in a friend's Belgrade apartment in conditions that some biographers liken to house arrest. He directed most of his energies towards writing, and during this time completed two of his best known novels, Na Drini ćuprija (The Bridge on the Drina) and Travnička hronika.|$|E
5|$|In early 2010, Nomura {{was asked}} in an {{interview}} if Square Enix would release an international Final Mix of Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep, to which he replied he would like to, as he enjoyed the work from the English voice casting done in the previous games. However, he stated {{that one of the}} main reasons for the popularity of the Final Mix version of Kingdom Hearts II was because it was released alongside the PlayStation 2 remake of Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories, so he and the <b>staff</b> <b>would</b> think on it more. In September 2010, Square Enix announced that Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep Final Mix would be released on January 20, 2011 in Japan. Like all Final Mix releases, it combines English audio with Japanese game text and subtitles, and includes all additional features implemented in the Western versions as well as brand new content, such as a new playable secret episode for Aqua, which also has new cutscenes with dialogue provided by her voice actress Megumi Toyoguchi. Alongside The 3rd Birthday, Final Mix includes a code that allows players to obtain downloadable content for Dissidia 012 Final Fantasy, with Final Mix featuring the character Cloud Strife costume from the original Kingdom Hearts. Final Mix topped the video game charts following its release with 77,317 units sold in the first week, and reaching 106,276 in February 2011. Final Mix was released for the first time outside Japan as part of Kingdom Hearts HD 2.5 Remix.|$|E
