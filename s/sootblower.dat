50|$|A <b>sootblower</b> is {{a device}} for {{removing}} the soot that is deposited on the furnace tubes of a boiler during combustion.|$|E
50|$|A <b>sootblower</b> may be {{operated}} manually or by a remotely controlled motor. The soot, which {{is removed from}} the heating surfaces, will be blown out with the flue gases. If the boiler is equipped with a dust collector, it will trap the soot. Otherwise, the soot will be ejected into the outside air through the chimney stack.|$|E
40|$|A <b>sootblower</b> uses {{supersonic}} free jets {{obtained from}} nozzles to wash off deposit accumulated on the fireside surface of boiler tubes． To remove deposit effectively， {{it is desirable}} that the jet maintains high Pitot pressure even in the far downstream of the nozzle exit． In the present work， supersonic free jets obtained from three nozzles are investigated by visualizing the flow field with the schlieren method and also by measuring the Pitot pressure distributions along the jet center line． These nozzles have different shapes but have the same throat and exit areas；the exit Mach number calculated from the one-dimensional isentropic theory is 2 ． 4 ． The experiments cover from over-to under-expansion pressure ratio． It is found that the complex wave pattern exists in the jets and this pattern depends strongly on the pressure ratio {{as well as on}} the nozzle shape． The decay process of the Pitot pressure in the downstream region is also clarified．These results will provide valuable information for the． design of the <b>sootblower</b> nozzles...|$|E
50|$|<b>Sootblowers</b> utilize flowing media such as water, air or {{steam to}} remove {{deposits}} from the tubes. This is typically done during maintenance {{with the air}} blower turned on. There are several different types of <b>sootblowers</b> used. Wall blowers of the rotary type are mounted on furnace walls protruding between the convection tubes. The lances are connected to a steam source with holes drilled into it at intervals along its length. When it is turned on, it rotates and blows the soot off the tubes and out through the stack.|$|R
50|$|A soot fire can be {{damaging}} to a boiler {{because it can}} cause localized hotspots {{to occur in the}} tubes. These hotspots may reach temperatures that weaken the materials of the tubes. <b>Sootblowers</b> reduce the risk of soot fires and their resulting damage.|$|R
50|$|<b>Sootblowers</b> {{are found}} in the {{convection}} section. As this section is above the radiant section and air movement is slower because of the fins, soot tends to accumulate here. Sootblowing is normally done when the efficiency of the convection section is decreased. This can be calculated by looking at the temperature change from the crossover piping and at the convection section exit.|$|R
40|$|Coal-fired {{units are}} {{increasingly}} expected {{to operate at}} varying loads while simultaneously dealing with various operational influences as well as fuel variations. Maintaining unit load availability while managing adverse effects of various operational issues such as, flue gas temperature excursions at the SCR inlet, high steam temperatures and the like presents significant challenges. Dynamic adjustment of sootblowing activities and different operational parameters is required to effectively control slagging, fouling and achieve reliability in unit operation. Closed-loop optimizers aim to reduce ongoing manual adjustments by control operators and provide consistency in unit operation. Such optimizers are typically computer software-based and work by interfacing an algorithmic and/or artificial intelligence based decision making system to plant control system [1]. KCP&L {{is in the process}} of implementing Siemens SPPA-P 3000 combustion and sootblowing optimizers at several Units. The Sootblowing Optimizer solution determines the need for sootblowing based on dynamic plant operating conditions, equipment availability and plant operational drivers. The system then generates <b>sootblower</b> activation signals for propagation in a closed-loop manner to the existing <b>sootblower</b> control system at ‘optimal ’ times. SPPA-P 3000 Sootblowing Optimizer has been successfully installed at Hawthorn Unit 5, a 594 -MW, wall-fired boiler, firing 100 percent Powder River Basin coal. This paper discusses implementation approach as well as operational experience with the Sootblowing Optimizer and presents longer-term operational trends showing unit load sustainability and heat rate improvement...|$|E
40|$|F i g. 9 {{the same}} {{conditions}} is not attacked. The indications are that the corrosion occurs when the proper combination of high metal temperature and slag deposits is present. These factors in turn are dependent on boiler configuration, <b>sootblower</b> locations, fuel characteristics, and operating variables. Corrosion usually can be detected before {{the point at which}} tube failures begin to occur by removing the overlying scale and measuring outside tube diameters. Measures that would make this j ob easier include improving accessibility of suspect areas when the unit is designed (this would also reduce the cost of re-placing tubing) and development of a practical nondestructive method of measuring tube-wall thickness {{from one side of the}} tube. The most successful practical method of protecting tubing fro...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a model experiment of <b>sootblower</b> jets {{which have been}} used to remove fire side deposits of boiler tubes. A circular cylinder is used instead of a boiler tube. Flowfield around the circular cylinder placed in correctly expanded jets from a supersonic nozzle with a design Mach number of 2. 0 and 2. 4 is studied. Visualization by schlieren method and measurement of pressure on a cylinder are performed to diagnose the flowfield. The pressure coefficient on the cylinder is found smaller than that obtained by potential flow theory around a cylinder, especially, when the cylinder is located in the potential core region of the jets. The velocity distribution on the cylinder strongly depends on the flow Mach number just downstream of the shock wave generated in front of the cylinder...|$|E
25|$|Tube spacing {{wide enough}} for normal {{operation}} of a coal-fired boiler had to be wider for recovery boilers. This gave satisfactory performance of about a week before a water wash. Mechanical <b>sootblowers</b> were also quickly adopted. To control chemical losses and {{lower the cost of}} purchased chemicals electrostatic precipitators were added. Lowering dust losses in flue gases has more than 60 years of practice.|$|R
50|$|A further {{operational}} {{difficulty in}} coal-fired boilers is the binding of the catalyst by fly ash from the fuel combustion. This requires {{the usage of}} <b>sootblowers,</b> sonic horns, and careful design of the ductwork and catalyst materials to avoid plugging by the fly ash. SCR catalysts have a typical operational lifetime of about 16,000-40,000 hours in coal-fired power plants, depending on the flue gas composition, and up to 80,000 hours in cleaner gas-fired power plants.|$|R
40|$|Acousticlean Sonic <b>Sootblowers,</b> or 'horns' are low frequency, {{high energy}} {{acoustical}} devices which offer a low-cost approach to cleaning {{many areas of}} the boiler and its associated equipment. The horns are presently in use and/or are being evaluated at more than 50 sites in the U. S., and at many more in Europe, where the technology originated. This paper describes five industrial applications of the horns to solve operating problems in varied industries. The applications discussed include utilization in pulp mill hog fuel boilers to substantially reduce steam lancing requirements; use in recovery boiler precipitators to reduce salt cake buildups; maintenance of clean economizer sections in oil field steam generators; waste fuel boilers; and precipitator dust minimization in smelting operations. A comparison of acoustical energy versus steam sootblowing costs is also included...|$|R
40|$|The {{temperatures}} of floor tubes in a slope-floored black liquor recovery boiler were measured using {{an array of}} thermocouples located on the tube crowns. It was found that sudden, short duration temperature increases occurred with a frequency that increased with distance from the spout wall. To determine if the temperature pulses were associated with material falling from the convective section of the boiler, the pattern of <b>sootblower</b> operation was recorded and compared with the pattern of temperature pulses. During the period from September, 1998, through February, 1999, {{it was found that}} more than 2 / 3 of the temperature pulses occurred during the time when one of the fast eight sootblowers, which are directed {{at the back of the}} screen tubes and the leading edge of the first superheater bank, was operating...|$|E
40|$|A unique {{test program}} was {{conducted}} to evaluate flue gas-side fouling and cleaning performance characteristics of a heat exchanger tube bundle for application in coal-fired environments. The test bundle contained helically finned tubes in a staggered arrangement. Air sootblowers were installed upstream and downstream of the test bundle to evaluate cleaning effectiveness during the fouling test. The bundle was installed in the outlet flue of a coal-fired test boiler to simulate flue gas and friable flyash conditions of a pulverized-coal-fired utility or industrial boiler. Thermal and hydraulic performance characteristics were measured {{to determine the effects}} of fouling and <b>sootblower</b> cleaning on bundle heat transfer and pressure drop. Results showed that ash deposits were controllable by sootblowing and that the bundle did not plug. The maximum fouling factor depended on sootblowing frequency, and there was no measurable increase in bundle pressure drop. Fouling-factor data were correlated against time, bundle geometry, and flue gas conditions for the two coals tested.

40|$|The {{primary goal}} of the Fireside Performance Indices (FPI) {{research}} project at the Energy & Environmental Research Center (EERC) {{was to develop a}} series of indices to reliably predict the fireside performance of subbituminous coals in utility boilers. Individual utilities must respond quickly and effectively to changing fuel markets because of competition within the U. S. coal-fired power industry. Spot-market purchases of coal have become commonplace. The economics associated with sulfur emissions control have caused many utilities to use Powder River Basin (PRB) subbituminous coals. The PRB coals usually provide a lower-cost, medium-heating-value, low-sulfur fuel option. Although these coals possess similar overall or bulk compositional properties, their fireside performance characteristics vary considerably within a given boiler. Consequently, bulk compositional parameters and, hence, conventional indices such as the base-to-acid ratio, stagging factor, and fouling factor are inappropriate for predicting the fireside performance of PRB coals. The development of the computer-controlled scanning electron microscopy (CCSEM) and chemical fractionation methods, however, has enabled a more thorough characterization of the inorganic constituents of PRB, coals that contribute to the following adverse operational effects: stagging, fouling, opacity, erosion and poor grindability, slag tapping, and <b>sootblower</b> performance. Eight predictive indices have been developed based primarily on CCSEM and chemical fractionation analysis parameters to predict the propensity of a given coal or coal blend to cause operational problems. The indices were formulated using bench-, pilot-, and full-scale combustion testing data from previous research projects combined with bench-scale data from this project to identify the primary coal inorganic properties that cause ash-related problems in utility boilers...|$|E
50|$|SCR {{systems are}} {{sensitive}} to contamination and plugging resulting from normal operation or abnormal events. Many SCRs are given a finite life due to known amounts of contaminants in the untreated gas. The large majority of catalyst on the market is of porous construction. A clay planting pot {{is a good example}} of what SCR catalyst feels like. This porosity is what gives the catalyst the high surface area essential for reduction of NOx. However, the pores are easily plugged by a variety of compounds present in combustion/fuel gas. Some examples of plugging contaminates are: fine particulate, ammonia sulfur compounds, ammonium bisulfate (ABS) and silicon compounds. Many of these contaminants can be removed while the unit is on line, for example by <b>sootblowers.</b> The unit can also be cleaned during a turnaround or by raising the exhaust temperature. Of more concern to SCR performance is poisons, which will destroy the chemistry of the catalyst and render the SCR ineffective at NOx reduction or cause unwanted oxidation of ammonia (forming more NOx). Some of these poisons include: halogens, alkaline metals, arsenic, phosphorus, antimony, chrome, copper.|$|R
40|$|Waste-to-energy boiler fire-side fouling {{is a major}} {{operational}} {{issue for}} many facilities, including the Commerce Refuse-to-Energy Facility. The Commerce Refuse-to-Energy Facility is a 350 ton per day, mass burn waterwall facility that began operation in 1987. Fouling occurs throughout the convection sections with the highest differential pressure occurring across the generating bank. Flue gas differential pressures and temperatures have been tracked and analyzed at the facility for approximately ten years during various operating conditions. It has been determined {{that the rate of}} increase of the differential pressure across the generating bank is correlated with flue gas temperature and the extent of fouling. Several different cleaning methods have been used to clear the convection zone of ash deposits, including off-line hydroblasting, on-line hydroblasting, on-line explosives cleaning, <b>sootblowers</b> and sonic horns [...] Better understanding of the fouling trends and evaluation of cleaning methods has led the facility to use a combination of on-line hydroblasting and explosives cleaning and off-line hydroblasting. The facility is now able to operate one year between planned outages, compared to ten weeks during the initial operation of the facility. Additional savings have also been achieved by reducing induced draft fan load, and possibly a reduction in tube wastage...|$|R
40|$|Superheater is for {{generating}} superheated steam from the saturated steam from the evaporator outlet. In {{the case of}} pulverized coal fired boiler, a relatively small amount of ash causes problems with ash fouling on the heating surfaces, including the superheaters. In the convection pass of the boiler, the flue gas temperature is lower and ash deposits can be loose or sintered. Ash fouling not only reduces heat transfer from the flue gas to the steam, but also {{is the cause of}} a higher pressure drop on the flue gas flow path. In the case the pressure drop is greater than the power consumed by the fan increases. If the superheater surfaces are covered with ash than the steam temperature at the outlet of the superheater stages falls, and the flow rates of the water injected into attemperator should be reduced. There is also an increase in flue gas temperature after the different stages of the superheater. Consequently, this leads to a reduction in boiler efficiency. The paper presents the results of computational fluid dynamics simulations of the first stage superheater of both the boiler OP- 210 M using the commercial software. The temperature distributions of the steam and flue gas along the way they flow together with temperature of the tube walls and temperature of the ash deposits will be determined. The calculated steam temperature is compared with measurement results. Knowledge of these temperatures is of great practical importance because it allows to choose the grade of steel for a given superheater stage. Using the developed model of the superheater to determine its degree of ash fouling in the on-line mode one can control the activation frequency of steam <b>sootblowers...</b>|$|R
40|$|Boiler {{combustion}} dynamics change continuously due {{to several}} factors including coal quality, boiler loading, ambient conditions, changes in slag/soot deposits and {{the condition of}} plant equipment. NO{sub x} formation, Particulate Matter (PM) emissions, and boiler thermal performance are directly affected by the sootblowing practices on a unit. As part of its Power Plant Improvement Initiative program, the US DOE is providing cofunding (DE-FC 26 - 02 NT 41425) and NETL is the managing agency for this project at Tampa Electric's Big Bend Station. This program serves to co-fund projects that {{have the potential to}} increase thermal efficiency and reduce emissions from coal-fired utility boilers. A review of the Big Bend units helped identify intelligent sootblowing as a suitable application to achieve the desired objectives. The existing <b>sootblower</b> control philosophy uses sequential schemes, whose frequency is either dictated by the control room operator or is timed based. The intent of this project is to implement a neural network based intelligent soot-blowing system, in conjunction with state-of-the-art controls and instrumentation, to optimize the operation of a utility boiler and systematically control boiler fouling. Utilizing unique, online, adaptive technology, operation of the sootblowers can be dynamically controlled based on real-time events and conditions within the boiler. This could be an extremely cost-effective technology, which has the ability to be readily and easily adapted to virtually any pulverized coal fired boiler. Through unique on-line adaptive technology, Neural Network-based systems optimize the boiler operation by accommodating equipment performance changes due to wear and maintenance activities, adjusting to fluctuations in fuel quality, and improving operating flexibility. The system dynamically adjusts combustion setpoints and bias settings in closed-loop supervisory control to simultaneously reduce {sub x} emissions and improve heat rate around the clock...|$|E
40|$|Cost {{effective}} {{generation of}} electricity {{is vital to the}} economic growth and stability of this nation. To accomplish this goal a balanced portfolio of fuel sources must be maintained and established which not only addresses the cost of conversion of these energy sources to electricity, but also does so in an efficient and environmentally sound manner. Conversion of coal as an energy source to produce steam for a variety of systems has been a cornerstone of modern industry. However, the use of coal in combustion systems has traditionally produced unacceptable levels of gaseous and particulate emissions, albeit that recent combustion, removal and mitigation techniques have drastically reduced these levels. With the combustion of coal there is always the formation and deposition of ash and slag within the boilers. This adversely affects the rate at which heat is transferred to the working fluid, which in the case of electric generators is water/steam. The fouling of the boiler leads to poor efficiencies {{due to the fact that}} heat which could normally be transferred to the working fluid remains in the flue gas stream and exits to the environment without beneficial use. This loss in efficiency translates to higher consumption of fuel for equivalent levels of electric generation; hence more gaseous emissions are also produced. Another less obvious problem exists with fouling of various sections of the boiler creating intense peak temperatures within and around the combustion zone. Total nitrogen oxides (NOx) generation is primarily a function of both ''fuel'' and ''thermal'' NOx production. Fuel NOx which generally comprises 20 %- 40 % of the total NOx generated is predominantly influenced by the levels of oxygen present, while thermal NOx which comprises the balance is a function of temperature. As the fouling of the boiler increases and the rate of heat transfer decreases, peak temperatures increase as does the thermal NOx production. Due to the composition of coal, particulate matter is also a by-product of coal combustion. Modern day utility boilers are usually fitted with electrostatic precipitators to aid in the collection of particulate matter. Although extremely efficient, these devices are sensitive to rapid changes in inlet mass concentration as well as total mass loading. Traditionally, utility boilers are equipped with devices known as <b>sootblowers,</b> which use, steam, water or air to dislodge and clean the surfaces within the boiler and are operated based upon established rule or operator's judgment. Poor sootblowing regimes can influence particulate mass loading to the electrostatic precipitators. The project applied a neural network intelligent sootblowing system in conjunction with state-of-the-art controls and instruments to optimize the operation of a utility boiler and systematically control boiler slagging/fouling. This optimization process targeted reduction of NOx of 30 %, improved efficiency of 2 % and a reduction in opacity of 5 %. The neural network system proved to be a non-invasive system which can readily be adapted to virtually any utility boiler. Specific conclusions from this neural network application are listed below. These conclusions should be used in conjunction with the specific details provided in the technical discussions of this report to develop a thorough understanding of the process...|$|R
