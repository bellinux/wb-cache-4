5|$|In a {{panoramic}} camera, the focal-plane shutter {{was replaced by}} a rotation of 180° of the lens itself. This model was the basis for the Doppel-Sport Panoramic Camera, which Neubronner tried to market around 1910. It captured {{a panoramic}} view on 3cm×8cm film. It never went into <b>serial</b> <b>production,</b> though.|$|E
5|$|Although not {{strictly}} a missing <b>serial,</b> <b>production</b> of the 1979 Tom Baker story Shada was curtailed by a technician's strike partway through recording. To prevent the half-finished material from being junked, incoming Doctor Who producer John Nathan-Turner placed a preservation order {{on it with}} an intention to later finish the production. Although repeated attempts to remount the serial failed, a clip from Episode 1 was later used in the 1983 story The Five Doctors after Tom Baker declined to reprise his role.|$|E
5|$|Although Si Tjonat was {{initially}} {{intended to be}} a <b>serial,</b> <b>production</b> of the second instalment halted after the closure of Batavia Motion Picture. Jo Eng Sek left the industry completely, only returning in 1935 to produce Poei Sie Giok Pa Loei Tay. Wong, meanwhile, remained active in the cinema together with his brothers Joshua and Othniel. Using the banner Halimoen Film they later cast Sim in their 1931 film Si Pitoeng. Ku Fung May did not act in another film. Several films centred on bandits, including Lie Tek Swie's Si Ronda (1930) and the Wongs' Rampok Preanger (1929) and Si Pitoeng (1931), followed soon after Si Tjonat.|$|E

5|$|Six {{prototype}} trams {{were delivered}} by Strømmen in 1937, with four different motor solutions, from AEG, Siemens, Vickers and Norsk Elektrisk & Brown Boveri (NEBB). None {{of these were}} particularly successful, and the 40 <b>serial</b> <b>production</b> trams used conventional motors from ELIN. These were delivered in 1939, with 20 (class E) being used by Oslo Sporveier mainly on the Kjelsås Line, but also on other services. The remaining 20 trams (class B) were leased to Bærumsbanen, that used them on the Kolsås and Østensjø Lines, and later on the Ekeberg Line.|$|E
5|$|Small batch {{production}} of the single-seat, single-engine JF-17s began in China in June 2006. The first two small-batch-produced aircraft were delivered on 2 March 2007 and first flew in Pakistan on 10 March. They took part in an aerial display on 23 March 2007 {{as part of the}} Pakistan Day Joint Services Parade in Islamabad. Another six small-batch-produced aircraft were delivered by March 2008. These were extensively flight-tested and evaluated by the PAF. Two <b>serial</b> <b>production</b> aircraft were delivered from China in 2009 and the first Pakistani-manufactured aircraft was delivered to the PAF in a ceremony on 23 November 2009.|$|E
5|$|The Tupolev Tu-70 (NATO {{reporting}} name: Cart) was a Soviet passenger {{variant of}} the Tu-4 bomber (which was a reverse-engineered copy of the American-made Boeing B-29 Superfortress) designed immediately {{after the end of}} World War II. It used a number of components from Boeing B-29s that had made emergency landings in the Soviet Union after running out of fuel after bombing Japan. It had the first pressurized fuselage in the Soviet Union and first flew on 27 November 1946. The aircraft was successfully tested, recommended for <b>serial</b> <b>production,</b> but ultimately not produced because of more pressing military orders and because Aeroflot had no requirement for such an aircraft.|$|E

5|$|The {{avionics}} software {{incorporates the}} concept of open architecture. Instead of the military-optimised Ada programming language, the software is written using the popular C++ programming language, enabling {{the use of the}} numerous civilian programmers available. The aircraft also includes a health and usage monitoring system, and automatic test equipment. The flight control system (FCS) comprises conventional controls with stability augmentation in the yaw and roll axis and a digital fly-by-wire (FBW) system in the pitch axis. The leading edge slats/flaps and trailing edge flaps are automatically adjusted during manoeuvring to increase turning performance. The FCS of <b>serial</b> <b>production</b> aircraft reportedly have a digital quadruplex (quad-redundant) FBW system in the pitch axis and a duplex (dual-redundant) FBW system in the roll and yaw axis.|$|E
5|$|<b>Serial</b> <b>production</b> of the T1000 {{started in}} 1964 by Strømmens Værksted, NEBB and AEG. Until 1978, 162 cars were {{delivered}} to Oslo Sporveier. These were manufactured in four series, designated T1 through T4, with minor changes to specifications. During the late 1970s, the western suburban lines which {{were part of}} the tramway needed new rolling stock. Oslo Sporveier was at the time considering connecting the metro with these lines, and between 1978 and 1981, 33 new T1300 cars were built. The only difference from the T1000 was that they had a pantograph that allowed them to operate on the tramways. They also retained the necessary technical appliances to run on the metro. The new T1300 were designated T5 and T6. From 1985 to 1989, 16 T4s were rebuilt to T1300 and designated T7 and T8.|$|E
5|$|<b>Serial</b> <b>production</b> {{started in}} 1964, with the bodies built at Strømmens Værksted, the motors built by NEBB and the {{electrical}} equipment by AEG. By 1978, 162 cars had been delivered to Oslo Sporveier. These were manufactured in four series, named T1 through T4, with varying specifications. T1 was manufactured in 90 units from 1964 to 1966 {{for the opening}} of the Grorud Line and the conversion of the Lambertseter Line. The first 30 have driver's cabs in both directions (designated T1-2), while the latter 60 have it in only one end (designated T1-1). In 1967, 15 T2s were built for the conversion of the Østensjø Line. Although given a new designation, they are in all ways identical to the T1-1s. From 1969 to 1972, 30 T3s were built for the Furuset Line. Further expansions of the lines resulted in 37 T4s being built from 1976 to 1978. The T1000s are numbered 1001–1162.|$|E

5|$|The first lorry made in Vanaja was a Sisu S-22 prototype, which {{rolled out}} of the factory door on 1 August 1945. After a short and {{intensive}} testing period, <b>serial</b> <b>production</b> began on 29 October 1945 but because of a shortage of materials and component quality problems, the first vehicles were not ready until early 1946. The capabilities of the domestic suppliers proved to be very limited and the company was dependent on imported gearboxes, steering components, drive shafts and electrical systems until domestic companies could {{set up their own}} production. The Finnish suppliers were unable to meet the requirements with the available materials and experienced severe quality problems. Total production in 1946 was 147 Sisu S-22 vehicles, which was far below the target of 2,000 vehicles. The original, calculated price per vehicle had been 765,000marks but the eventual cost was 800,000marks.|$|E
5|$|The series {{received}} 14 {{nominations for}} Martín Fierro Awards and won eight, including the Golden Award. It won awards for best daily <b>serial,</b> <b>production,</b> writing and opening theme, and {{was nominated for}} best direction (won by Juan José Campanella for El hombre de tu vida). Daniel Hendler and Luciano Cáceres were nominated for best lead actor in a daily serial, which Hendler won. Paola Barrientos was the best supporting actress in a daily serial, with Mirta Busnelli also nominated. Isabel Macedo and Nancy Dupláa were nominated as best lead actress in a daily serial, and Macedo (not Dupláa, as expected by the cast) won. Chang Sung Kim, Jenny Williams (new actor), Andy Kusnetzoff, Betiana Blum (guest appearance), Mex Urtizberea and Roberto Carnaghi (supporting actor in daily drama) also received nominations.|$|E
5|$|The {{first two}} single-car trains were {{delivered}} in 1959 {{and given the}} designation T. They were delivered by Strømmens Værksted and NEBB as prototypes, without compensation from the planning office. They were tested on the Østensjø and Lambertseter Lines until 1 December 1960, when they were transferred to Bærumsbanen, who used them on the Kolsås Line. During their service they were prone to technical problems, and were more in the depot than in service. However, they gave valuable knowledge for the <b>serial</b> <b>production.</b> The trains were originally painted silver with a dark-blue cheatline and numbered 1 and 2. About 1970, they were repainted dark blue with a silver cheatline, and in 1971 given the numbers 451 and 452. The latter remained in service until 1977, when it was put aside, and scrapped in 1987. The former remained in service until it was put aside as defect, although it had rarely been used since 1982. It was fixed up and made operational again 1993, but was withdrawn the same year and scrapped the following year.|$|E

5|$|There were {{plans to}} {{establish}} mass ("serial") {{production of the}} model at the Kiev Aircraft Production Plant (later renamed as Antonov <b>Serial</b> <b>Production</b> Plant), which was associated with but separate from the Antonov Design Bureau, and at the Samara Aircraft Production Plant (later reorganised as Aviakor) in Samara, Russia. At one stage during early development, Russia was showing reluctance at supporting {{the development of the}} An-70, and so Uzbekistan sought, unsuccessfully, to establish a final assembly plant in the capital at the Tashkent Aircraft Production Plant, where the production of the An-70's wings and the Il-76 were taking place. Construction of the first prototype had started in Kiev in 1991. The maiden flight of the aircraft had originally been scheduled for late 1992. However, due to financing and design issues, this was pushed back until 1994. In particular, the weakened national currency diminished the firm's ability to pay for the aircraft's components, especially those sourced from Russia, and workers' salaries. In addition, engineers discovered numerous design and manufacturing deficiencies during the final ground checks, the majority of which were non-critical yet necessitated lengthy corrections. In the end, the aircraft made its maiden flight on 16 December 1994.|$|E
