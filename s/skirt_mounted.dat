40|$|This study {{investigates the}} effect that several {{different}} floaters' geometries have on the performance characteristics of tightly moored vertical axisymmetric wave energy converters (WECs). A cylindrical buoy with and without vertical and horizontal <b>skirts</b> <b>mounted</b> at its bottom, a cone, {{as well as two}} piston-like arrangements, consisting of an internal floater (cone or cylinder) and an exterior torus, have been examined and comparatively assessed. The WEC's first-order hydrodynamic characteristics are evaluated using a linearised diffraction-radiation semi-analytical method. Axisymmetric eigenfunction expansions of the velocity potential are introduced into properly defined ring-shaped fluid regions surrounding the bodies and the potential solutions are matched at the boundaries of adjacent fluid regions by enforcing continuity of the hydrodynamic pressures and radial velocities. A dynamical model for the floaters' performance in time domain is developed that properly accounts for the floater's hydrodynamic behaviour, the coupling terms between the different modes of motion and of the power take-off mechanism. Numerical results are presented and discussed, in terms of the expected power production. The results show parametrically {{the effect that}} the varying hydrodynamic characteristics of each particular floater's geometry have on the investigated WEC's performance characteristics. © 2010 © The Institution of Engineering and Technology...|$|R

50|$|The Huon Highway is an 87 km {{highway in}} {{southern}} Tasmania, Australia. The highway forms {{part of the}} A6 and connects Hobart with the southern parts of Tasmania. The original Huon Highway (now known as Huon Road (B64)) was a twisty two-lane road <b>skirting</b> around <b>Mount</b> Wellington, but that section of the highway was bypassed in stages when the Southern Outlet was completed in 1968. This provided a more direct, and higher traffic-capacity, route between Hobart and the Huon Valley. A few sections of the old highway remain, all within the Huon Valley, and have been upgraded.|$|R
60|$|In {{company with}} the chevalier, I took several {{excursions}} on horseback about the environs of Catania, and the picturesque <b>skirts</b> of <b>Mount</b> Etna. One of these led through a village, which had sprung up on the very tract of an ancient eruption, the houses being built of lava. At one time we passed, for some distance, along a narrow lane, between two high dead convent walls. It was a cut-throat-looking place, {{in a country where}} assassinations are frequent; and just about midway through it, we observed blood upon the pavement and the walls, as if a murder had actually been committed there.|$|R

50|$|William Gill’s {{first major}} {{expedition}} began in April 1873, {{two years after}} his return from India. He accompanied the distinguished cavalry officer Colonel Valentine Baker on an eight-month exploration of Persia and adjacent territories. Baker and Gill travelled to Tblisi (Tiflis) in Georgia thence to Baku in Azerbaijan. Having crossed the Caspian Sea, they travelled to Ashgabat in Turkmenistan, from which they hoped to explore and survey the Atrak valley. This proved impossible at that time, so they headed towards Tehran in Persia (now Iran), crossing the Alborz mountains via a pass more than 2 miles above sea level. They <b>skirted</b> <b>Mount</b> Damavand, descended into the Mazandaran forests, recrossed the mountains to Damghan, then visited Mashhad. They then travelled to the fortress of Kilat-i-Nadir, which until then had been shown on British maps in two separate locations. Next, Baker and Gill trekked to Dargaz in the Kopet Dag Mountains. Dargaz was shown on the best British maps merely as a small town whereas in reality {{it was a large}} and thriving autonomous Kurdish district. Here William Gill was lucky to survive when he dropped his shotgun and it discharged at his feet. (His thick leather boots saved him.) Later, Baker and Gill succeeded in their original ambition of exploring the upper Atrak valley. This again revealed the poor quality of existing British maps of the region. Baker and Gill's survey work was to prove important in settling a boundary dispute between Persia and Russia, as it enabled Britain to support the Shah of Persia’s position on a factual basis.|$|R

As with the gents' roadster, the frame was of steel construction and the positioning of the frame and handlebars gave the rider a very upright riding position. Though they originally came with front spoon-brakes, technological advancements meant that later models were equipped with the much-improved coaster brakes or rod-actuated rim or drum-brakes.|$|R

40|$|ATK Space Systems – Commerce (ATK Commerce), {{formerly}} known as Pressure Systems, Inc. (PSI), has been supplying pressure vessels to the aerospace industry for over 45 years. Its first 3 decades of existence can be characterized by the maturing of its tank technologies and the securing of its market niche. The primary focus at {{that period of time}} was on maintaining its foothold in the aerospace industry, and less emphasis was given to developing breakthrough technologies. However, beginning in the early 1990 ’s and under new leadership, ATK Commerce has introduced a string of new technologies in the design and fabrication of its pressure vessels. Many innovations were industry firsts. They demonstrated dynamic use of materials to achieve the various design goals of low mass, low cost, excellent packaging efficiency, and exceptional performance. This paper summarizes some of these innovations, which include: · Hybrid tank shells; · Bonded brackets or <b>skirts</b> for <b>mounting</b> large propellant tanks; · Titanium lined, composite overwrapped pressurant tanks; · Propellant Management Devices (PMDs) adapted for launch vehicle horizontal handling; · PMD for on-orbit fluid transfer; · PMD for Center-of-Mass control; · “Uni-body ” Integrated tank and structure...|$|R

50|$|On 24 February, the PLA {{decided to}} {{supplement}} their reserves, the 149th Division, to {{the fight against the}} VPA 316th Division. Chinese efforts now concentrating on cutting off the retreat of the VPA 316th Division, as the PLA 447th Regiment <b>skirted</b> around <b>Mount</b> Phan Xi Pang through the Hoang Lien Son Pass and maneuvered toward the direction of Bình Lư, which was 44 km west of Sapa. In meantime, the rest of the 149th Division pushed toward Sapa along two roads parallel to Highway 10. Despite showing excellent combat performance, the VPA 316th Division was finally forced to retreat {{due to the lack of}} manpower. At 14:45 on 1 March, Sapa fell to the PLA. On the eastern wing of the offensive, Khoc Tiam succumbed to a night assault raging from 20:00 on 2 March to 14:45 on 3 March. At 19:00 on 3 March, all roads that connected Phong Thổ with Bình Lư and Pa Tần had been under Chinese control. On 4 March, Chinese forces eventually captured the town, thus successfully blocking the supply route to the VPA 316th Division from Lai Châu; the blocking position was at least 40 km from the Sino-Vietnamese border, becoming the deepest Chinese penetration in the war. The 316th Division finally ceased fighting on 5 March. On the same day, the Chinese government announced the withdrawal of troops from Vietnam.|$|R
60|$|It is very {{characteristic}} of the city, with its medieval medley and huddle of houses, that a man may first see the Church of the Holy Sepulchre {{which is in the}} west, by going as far as possible to the east. All the sights are glimpses; and things far can be visible and things near invisible. The traveller comes on the Moslem dome round a corner; and he finds the Christian dome, as it were, behind his own back. But if he goes on round the wall to the north-east corner of the Court of the Temple, he will find the next entrance; the Gate of St. Stephen. On the slope outside, by a strange and suitable coincidence, the loose stones which lie on every side of the mountain city seemed to be heaped higher; and across the valley on the <b>skirts</b> of the <b>Mount</b> of Olives is the great grey olive of Gethsemane.|$|R
5000|$|Named {{after its}} European discoverer, Donald George Mackay, Lake Mackay {{is the fourth}} largest lake in Australia.

[...] "May 9th we left the well on a Southerly course, and were soon amongst the ridges, which continued {{for the next two}} days. The night of the 11th, having skirted a line of rough cliffs, we camped about three miles North of a very prominent single hill, which I named Mount Webb, after W. F. Webb, Esq., of Newstead Abbey, Nottinghamshire. As the sun rose that morning the mirage of a lake of apparently great size was visible for 90° of the horizon — that is, from East round to South. Neither from the cliffs that we <b>skirted,</b> nor from <b>Mount</b> Webb, was any lake visible, but it is more than probable that a large salt lake exists in this locality, possibly connecting, in a broken line, Lake White and Lake Macdonald." ...|$|R

Since by then it was the British who had the strongest and best-developed market in bike design, Dutch framemakers either copied them or imported them from England. In 1895, 85 per cent of all bikes bought in the Netherlands were from Britain; the vestiges of that influence can still be seen in the solid, gentlemanly shape of a traditional Dutch bike even now.|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} a {{shielding}} <b>skirt,</b> a tarpaulin <b>mounted</b> from the surface down to 5 m depth around a net cage, on the flow pattern at a commercially stocked salmon cage was inves-tigated. Dye {{was used as a}} tracer for water movement and the dye spreading was moni-tored using aerial images. Current meters were employed to investigate the flow close to the net inside and outside the cage. Tests were conducted with and without the shielding skirt. The focus was on the effectiveness of the shielding skirt to deflect water around the cage. This study shows that a shielding skirt can reduce horizontal flow components significantly inside a cage, which is related to a reduction of water exchange. The flow toward a cage is divided by a shielding skirt, i. e., some of the water is transported around the cage, while some is passing underneath the shielding skirt. Some water entering the fish cage from underneath the tarpaulin is transported toward the surface inside the cage. The use of a shielding skirt might not prevent interaction of the upper water layers inside and outside of a fish cage completely, but {{it has the potential to}} reduce the inflow of surface water into the cage, if deployed properly.
