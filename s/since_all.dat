5|$|<b>Since</b> <b>all</b> {{the twenty}} one {{predetermined}} hurricane names were exhausted after Hurricane Wilma, the Greek alphabet was {{used and the}} storm was designated Alpha once it reached tropical storm status. The name Alpha had been used before in the Atlantic for a subtropical storm, but 2005 was the first season to have a tropical storm Alpha.|$|E

5|$|The {{dominance}} of Latin and Greek among the literate elite may obscure {{the continuity of}} spoken languages, <b>since</b> <b>all</b> cultures within the Roman Empire were predominantly oral. In areas where Syriac, Coptic, Hebrew and Aramaic were spoken, they coexisted with Greek.|$|E
5|$|A senator {{could make}} a brief statement, discuss the matter in detail, or talk about an {{unrelated}} topic. All senators had to speak before a vote could be held, and <b>since</b> <b>all</b> meetings had to end by nightfall, a senator could talk a proposal to death (a filibuster or diem consumere) if they could keep the debate going until nightfall. It is known, for example, that the senator Cato the Younger once filibustered {{in an attempt to}} prevent the Senate from granting Julius Caesar a law that would have given land to the veterans of Pompey.|$|E
5|$|According to an {{official}} government press agency dispatch, {{about half of}} the candidates (approx. 360) were PZPR members. A majority of the remainder belonged to PZPR allies (Democratic Party (SD), United People's Party (ZSL)). There was no opposition party in Poland <b>since</b> <b>all</b> political groupings had to support the program of the PZPR. As a result, no real opposition candidates were permitted to run in the elections, but in theory the Polish voters could have stripped the communists from their claimed legitimacy by abstaining from voting. Another means of preventing the PZPR from obtaining a political victory would have occurred if all of the PZPR candidates were struck out, leaving only 100 to be elected.|$|E

5|$|Although Sullivan County has boroughs and townships, {{it has no}} cities. Any {{municipality}} in Pennsylvania {{with more}} than 10 persons can incorporate as a borough. Any township or borough {{with a population of}} at least 10,000 can ask the state legislature to become chartered as a city. However, as Sullivan County has a population of only 6,428, it has no cities. There are no unincorporated areas in the county, <b>since</b> <b>all</b> territory in Pennsylvania is incorporated.|$|E
5|$|For several decades, {{no natural}} {{reproduction}} of pallid sturgeon was observed, <b>since</b> <b>all</b> the fish {{that had been}} captured were older specimens. In the late 1990s, young pallid sturgeon were discovered living in a restored riparian area of the lower Missouri River. This was the first documented example of wild spawned pallid sturgeon in 50 years. In 2007, two female pallid sturgeon were also reported to have spawned in the Missouri National Recreational River area located downstream from Gavins Point Dam on the Missouri River.|$|E
5|$|In 1982, Pratt & Whitney studied {{retrofitting}} B-52s {{with four}} Pratt & Whitney PW2000 (F117) engines, {{but this was}} not done, <b>since</b> <b>all</b> B-52s were to be replaced by B-1s and B-2s by the late 1990s. In 1996 Rolls-Royce and Boeing jointly proposed to fit B-52s with four leased Rolls-Royce RB211-535 engines, but this plan failed because of Air Force resistance to leasing combat assets and a negative Air Force economic analysis which was later disputed as flawed.|$|E

5|$|In {{the poem}} Lokasenna, the half-god Loki angrily flyts with the gods {{in the sea}} entity Ægir's hall. Thor does not attend the event, however, as he is away in the east for {{unspecified}} purposes. Towards {{the end of the}} poem, the flyting turns to Sif, Thor's wife, whom Loki then claims to have slept with. The god Freyr's servant Beyla interjects, and says that, <b>since</b> <b>all</b> of the mountains are shaking, she thinks that Thor is on his way home. Beyla adds that Thor will bring peace to the quarrel, to which Loki responds with insults.|$|E
5|$|Independently of Schmid's actions, another {{figure has}} also been {{credited}} with ensuring Gisela took place. Heinz-Wolfgang Schnaufer—who was to the end the war as the most successful night fighter ace on 121 aerial victories—was said to have attempted to gain support for a like-minded offensive. Schnaufer pursued RAF bombers regularly to the English coast, or least {{the other side of}} the frontline. He experienced a lack of British interference beyond German-held territory. He recalled that he could fly around as if it was peace time, <b>since</b> <b>all</b> British jamming and interference stopped immediately once he was in Allied airspace.|$|E
5|$|NATO {{acquired}} 18 E-3As {{and support}} equipment for a NATO air defense force. <b>Since</b> <b>all</b> aircraft must be registered {{with a certain}} country, {{the decision was made}} to register the 18 NATO Sentries with Luxembourg, a NATO member that previously did not have any air force. The first NATO E-3 was delivered in January 1982. The eighteen E-3s were operated by Number 1, 2 and 3 Squadrons of NATO's E-3 Component, based at NATO Air Base Geilenkirchen. Presently, 16 NATO E-3As are in the inventory, since one E-3 was lost in a crash and one was retired from service in 2015 (see below).|$|E

5|$|Servicing Mission 3B {{flown by}} Columbia in March 2002 saw the {{installation}} of a new instrument, with the FOC (which, except for the Fine Guidance Sensors when used for astrometry, {{was the last of}} the original instruments) being replaced by the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS). This meant that COSTAR was no longer required, <b>since</b> <b>all</b> new instruments had built-in correction for the main mirror aberration. The mission also revived NICMOS by installing a closed-cycle cooler and replaced the solar arrays for the second time, providing 30 percent more power.|$|E
5|$|<b>Since</b> <b>all</b> PID bytes include four 0bits, {{they leave}} the bus in the full-bandwidth Kstate, {{which is the same}} as the low-bandwidth Jstate. It is {{followed}} by a brief pause, during which hubs enable their low-bandwidth outputs, already idling in the Jstate. Then a low-bandwidth packet follows, beginning with a sync sequence and PID byte, and ending with a brief period of SE0. Full-bandwidth devices other than hubs can simply ignore the PRE packet and its low-bandwidth contents, until the final SE0 indicates that a new packet follows.|$|E
5|$|<b>Since</b> <b>all</b> {{isotopes}} of neptunium have half-lives {{that are}} many times {{shorter than the}} age of the Earth, any primordial neptunium should have decayed by now. After only about 80 million years, the concentration of even the longest lived isotope, 237Np, would have been reduced to less than one-trillionth (10−12) of its original amount; and even if the whole Earth had initially been made of pure 237Np (and ignoring that this would be well over its critical mass of 60kg), 2100 half-lives would have passed since the formation of the Solar System, and thus all of it would have decayed. Thus neptunium is present in nature only in negligible amounts produced as intermediate decay products of other isotopes.|$|E

5|$|<b>Since</b> <b>all</b> {{meetings}} had to end by nightfall, {{a senator}} could talk {{a proposal to}} death (a filibuster) if he could keep the debate going until nightfall. Any proposed motion could be vetoed by a tribune, {{and if it was}} not vetoed, it was then turned into a final senatus consultum. Each senatus consultum was transcribed into a document by the presiding magistrate, and then deposited into the aerarium.|$|E
5|$|The actual {{degree of}} serotiny and fire {{mortality}} in B.prionotes varies with latitude, or, more likely, climate. Observations {{suggest that it}} is always killed by fire in the north of its range, which is relatively hot and dry, and where individual plants are usually smaller, but may survive fire in the cooler, moister, south. Moreover, it is essentially non-serotinous in the south, <b>since</b> <b>all</b> seed is released {{by the end of the}} second year, but seed retention increases steadily to the north, and at the northern end of its range, it typically takes around four years for a plant to release half of its seed in the absence of bushfire, with some seed retained for up to 12 years.|$|E
5|$|The {{dominance}} of Latin among the literate elite may obscure {{the continuity of}} spoken languages, <b>since</b> <b>all</b> cultures within the Roman Empire were predominantly oral. In the West, Latin, referred to in its spoken form as Vulgar Latin, gradually replaced Celtic and Italic languages that were related to it by a shared Indo-European origin. Commonalities in syntax and vocabulary facilitated the adoption of Latin.|$|E
