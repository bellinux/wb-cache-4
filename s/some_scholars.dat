5|$|Due {{to their}} shared {{association}} with skiing {{and the fact}} that both place names referring to Ullr and Skaði appear most frequently in Sweden, <b>some</b> <b>scholars</b> have proposed a particular connection between the two gods.

5|$|The most {{commonly}} suggested candidate for authorship is John Massey of Cotton, Cheshire. He {{is known to}} have lived in the dialect region of the Pearl Poet and is thought to have written the poem St. Erkenwald, which <b>some</b> <b>scholars</b> argue bears stylistic similarities to Gawain. St. Erkenwald, however, has been dated by <b>some</b> <b>scholars</b> to a time outside the Gawain poet's era. Thus, ascribing authorship to John Massey is still controversial and most critics consider the Gawain poet an unknown.|$|E

5|$|According to <b>some</b> <b>scholars,</b> the Black Stone was {{the same}} stone that Islamic {{tradition}} describes as greeting Muhammad before his prophethood. This led to a debate about whether the Black Stone's greeting comprised actual speech or merely a sound, and following that, whether the stone was a living creature or an inanimate object. Whichever was the case, the stone was held to be a symbol of prophethood.|$|E

5|$|Aspasia {{appears in}} the {{philosophical}} writings of Plato, Xenophon, Aeschines Socraticus and Antisthenes. <b>Some</b> <b>scholars</b> argue that Plato was impressed by her intelligence and wit and based his character Diotima in the Symposium on her, while others suggest that Diotima {{was in fact a}} historical figure. According to Charles Kahn, Professor of Philosophy at the University of Pennsylvania, Diotima is in many respects Plato's response to Aeschines' Aspasia.|$|E
5|$|In {{an early}} account, Sophocles wrote that Tereus {{was turned into}} a large-beaked bird whom <b>some</b> <b>scholars</b> {{translate}} as a hawk while a number of retellings and other works (including Aristophanes' ancient comedy, The Birds) hold that Tereus was instead changed into a hoopoe. Various later translations of Ovid state that Tereus was transformed into other birds than the hawk and hoopoe, including references by Dryden and Gower to the lapwing.|$|E
5|$|Interpretations vary. The canvas {{seems to}} portray {{simultaneously}} a dreaming {{woman and the}} content of her nightmare. The incubus and horse's head refer to contemporary belief and folklore about nightmares, but have been ascribed more specific meanings by some theorists.
