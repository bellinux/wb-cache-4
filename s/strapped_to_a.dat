Lucy accepts Gru's invitation for a date, and the pair dive into the ocean seconds before the rocket enters the volcano and violently explodes. After a comical 147 dates, Gru and Lucy get married, and Margo, Edith and Agnes finally have someone close to a mother.|$|E
5|$|The {{failed attempt}} to kill Bond while at Royale-Les-Eaux was {{inspired}} by Fleming's knowledge of the attempted assassination of Franz von Papen, Vice-Chancellor of Germany and an ambassador under Hitler. Both Papen and Bond survived their assassination attempts, carried out by Bulgarians, because trees protected them from the blasts. The torture scene in which Bond's genitals are thrashed while he is <b>strapped</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> bottomless chair was a version of a French-Moroccan torture technique, , in which the steel string of a mandolin was used to slice in half the testicles of British wartime agents.|$|E
50|$|Hook is a {{rectangular}} shape, {{similar to the}} slides but with an opening at its one end which used to hang detachable or multi-way <b>straps</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> bra. It is hooking bra shoulder <b>straps</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> strapless bra, re-positioning the <b>straps</b> <b>to</b> achieve the various looks, such as halter-neck and crossed-back.|$|R

5|$|Walter Golic (Paul McGann) is {{a mentally}} {{unstable}} murderer and arsonist who is imprisoned on Fury 161. He sees the Alien killing Boggs and Rains and is later {{found in the}} cafeteria eating cereal, his face covered in blood.

5|$|Sawyer {{wakes up}} to find himself <b>strapped</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> table, where Ben, Tom (M. C. Gainey) and two other Others watch over him. Sawyer is gagged before {{inserting}} a large hypodermic needle into his chest. When Sawyer awakens, Ben enters, carrying a rabbit in a cage; he shakes the cage vigorously, causing the rabbit to suddenly collapse, presumably dead. Ben informs Sawyer that they fitted him, like the rabbit, with a modified pacemaker; should his heart rate reach 140, his heart would explode. Ben threatens to implant one in Kate if Sawyer should tell her of his ordeal.|$|E
5|$|Dexter {{is called}} to a crime scene at the {{abandoned}} hospital where, last night, the Ice Truck Killer left security guard Tony Tucci (Brad William Henke) <b>strapped</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> table for Dexter to kill. Instead, Dexter had reported the crime scene and Tucci had been hospitalized after the Killer had amputated his hand and leg. Debra and Sgt. James Doakes (Erik King) question Tucci when he wakes up in hospital, but Doakes is unimpressed with Debra's ways of extracting information from Tucci. He disapproves of her suggestion to blindfold Tucci to help him to remember his encounter with the Killer, but after she confronts him about his attitude toward her, he agrees to blindfold Tucci, who remembers that the Killer used throat lozenges. They return {{to the crime scene}} and find a lozenge wrapper, on which forensics expert Vince Masuka (C.S. Lee) finds a partial fingerprint.|$|E

50|$|Strapping, {{also known}} as {{bundling}} and banding, {{is the process of}} applying <b>a</b> <b>strap</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> item <b>to</b> combine, stabilize, hold, reinforce, or fasten it.

5|$|Shortly before midnight, Taylor was {{led into}} the {{execution}} chamber and <b>strapped</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> chair 17 {{feet away from the}} shooters with a hood covering his head. Multiple bright lights covered Taylor. Sandbags were arranged behind him to prevent any ricochets. The captain walked down the aisle, tapping each shooter on the shoulder to check to see if they were ready. At 12:03 a.m. Mountain Standard Time on January 26, 1996, every shooter fired at the count of five and the white cloth target on Taylor's chest flew off. His chest moved upward and his left hand tightened into a fist. His grip gradually loosened and his head fell back. A doctor checked Taylor's neck for a pulse and cut two holes in his hood to check for a pupillary light reflex. Taylor was declared dead at 12:07 a.m. and became the 49th person to be executed in the state of Utah since 1852.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} Knowles walking down an alley, {{accompanied}} by several men in suits, {{an homage to}} Quentin Tarantino's 1992 film Reservoir Dogs. As the main section of the song begins, cameras zoom in on Knowles as she dances in {{a black and white}} latex leotard while holding sunglasses with hand signals on them. When the first verse begins, Knowles seductively dances for two men who have cameras as heads. Another scene shows her teasing men with futuristic toy guns while wearing a skin-colored latex top. During Gaga's verse, she and Knowles appear wearing white leotards; they both sing to the camera while shooting more toy guns in open fire. Knowles next brandishes a bow and fires arrows at a cameraman who's <b>strapped</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> rotating dart board. She and Gaga, now in front of a white backdrop, perform a synchronized dance together, with Gaga wearing a pair of yellow Louboutins heels. Knowles then appears dressed as an homage to Bettie Page, while handling several different firearms. Throughout the video, the two singers fire their guns and arrows at men. The video ends with Knowles shooting a gun while perched upon a stationary motorcycle and surrounded by images {{from the start of the}} video.|$|E
5|$|When the Griffin family {{decide to}} go for a hike in the local woods, Chris and Stewie get lost while chasing after a {{floating}} butterfly. As a result, they go missing for several days, with only limited supplies. As Lois is at her wits' end, she decides to see a psychic medium who assures her of the children's safety and well being. Eventually the boys are found and rescued by Bruce, and returned to their home in Quahog which only furthers Lois's psychic obsession to the annoyance of a skeptical Brian. In defiance of Lois's assertion that extrasensory perception exists, Brian has Peter perform a cold reading on a passerby in the park in order to demonstrate that psychic readings are purely an act, and not real. However, Peter is struck by his success as a medium, convincing himself that he actually has extrasensory perception, and decides to capitalize on it by opening his own psychic readings business and performing in front of a live audience. Soon after, Peter's bluff is finally called when Joe requests his help in a frantic search for a missing person who has been <b>strapped</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> bomb. Peter stalls for time during the search (as he just wants to feel the victim's daughter's breasts), eventually resulting in a gruesome death when the bomb explodes, prompting Peter to flatly admit that he actually has no psychic powers whatsoever.|$|E
50|$|The ’72 haversack {{could be}} repositioned to sit {{lower on the}} back {{allowing}} a radio or small bergen to be worn above it. This was effected by connecting the knapsack <b>straps</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> set of lower buckles beneath the ammunition pouches then adjusting the side straps accordingly.|$|R

5|$|Todd's {{identical}} twin brother, Victor Lord, Jr. (Trevor St. John), {{whom he had}} never known, is physically altered and brainwashed {{to believe that he}} is Todd. From May 2003 to August 2011, he assumes Todd's identity. In 2003, the presumed dead Irene Manning had ordered a hit on the real Todd to keep him from exposing her agency. She had Todd <b>strapped</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> chair and made him uncover every detail of his life. She originally gave Victor Todd's scar, but then had Victor's face altered with reconstructive surgery to make him look like Mitch Laurence's long lost brother, Flynn Walker Laurence. Irene sent Victor away in Todd's place, so that he could get his share of the inheritance as Victor Lord Sr.'s heir, and unknowingly help the agency. She kept the real Todd locked up, instead of following through with the original plan to kill him. She eventually admits to these facts after Todd escapes and returns home. Todd struggles with losing eight years of his life, and blames Victor for stealing his children, including the daughter he had with Téa, Danielle (Dani). He plans to kill Victor and is the top suspect when Victor is gunned down. He claims his innocence and convinces Starr to help him escape jail to keep Irene from killing the family for Victor's fortune. Although Irene wounds him, Todd kills her. Téa's brother, Tomás (Ted King), takes credit for allowing a wounded Todd to escape. Todd begins having vivid memories of killing Victor. Before Tomás is sentenced, Todd confesses to Irene's murder; Téa gets the charges reduced to self-defense. Todd locates the gun used to kill Victor and uses it to frame Tomás as revenge for initially bringing him to Irene. Todd and a rogue CIA agent force Tomás into a false confession. Todd faces difficulty bonding with Jack, who only accepts Victor as his father, but he continues to bond with Starr and assists her with various issues. He also helps Cole Thornhart fake his death so he can live with Starr and their daughter, Hope, in California. Todd is later arrested for Victor's murder.|$|E
25|$|On February 25, 1968, SAD {{operative}} Alex Mason is <b>strapped</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> {{chair in}} an interrogation room, bombarded with questions by his unseen captors about {{the location of}} a numbers station.

5000|$|Popular in the Philippines during New Year's Eve celebrations, it {{is known}} as Sinturón ni Hudas (Tagalog for [...] "Judas's belt," [...] from the Spanish cinturón de Judas). The name comes from an old Catholic {{tradition}} during Holy Week in the Philippines, wherein a chain of firecrackers is <b>strapped</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> effigy of Judas Iscariot and then lit up.|$|R
50|$|At {{the end of}} the episode, Damon {{wakes up}} in his cell after the {{shooting}} and he asks for Elena. Elena though is not in her cell.

He introduces himself as Enzo (Michael Malarkey) and when Elena hears his name she looks surprised since according to Damon, Enzo was killed in the fire 60 years ago.|$|R
50|$|In August 1985, Lister began a new {{independent}} newspaper, The Namibian. Her {{reporting on}} human rights abuses by South African forces brought new anger {{from the government and}} an advertising boycott by the white business community. In 1987, South African authorities banned the paper from printing a photograph of the corpse of <b>an</b> insurgent <b>strapped</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> armoured personnel carrier; Lister challenged the ban in court.|$|R
25|$|While {{waterboarding}} {{has been}} depicted in several films and demonstrated at protest gatherings, images of its actual use are scarce. The CIA allegedly destroyed all videos it {{made of the}} procedure. The 1968 Washington Post photo of a captured North Vietnamese soldier being interrogated is arguably different because instead of being <b>strapped</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> board, the prisoner is held down by two soldiers as a third pours water from a canteen over a cloth covering face.|$|E
25|$|The {{cover of}} Stick It to Ya, the debut album by heavy metal band Slaughter, was infamous {{for a picture}} by {{photographer}} Glen Wexler of former Playboy playmate Laurie Carr wearing a swimsuit, <b>strapped</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> target board and surrounded by knives. The cover of a subsequent release, Stick It Live, featured an image apparently from the same shoot as the first but this time showing the target girl walking towards the board hand-in-hand with a knife thrower.|$|E
25|$|One {{well-known}} {{example of}} this process is Kane's painting Flathead woman and child, in which he combined a sketch of a Chinookan baby having its head flattened by being <b>strapped</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> cradle board with a later field portrait of a Cowlitz woman living in a different region. Another example of how Kane elaborated his sketches can be seen in his painting Indian encampment on Lake Huron, which is based on a sketch taken in summer 1845 during his first trip to Sault Ste. Marie. The painting has a distinct romantic flair accentuated by the lighting and the dramatic clouds, while the scene of the camp life depicted is reminiscent of a European idealized rural peasant scene.|$|E
5000|$|Good News {{from the}} Next World {{received}} favourable reviews among {{critics in the}} United States. However, it received mixed to negative reviews in U.K. John Harris wrote in Melody Maker that the album [...] "approximates the noise that would be made if the entire contents of a music shop were <b>strapped</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> Empire transport ship from Star Wars", adding [...] "for all its cod-Wagnerian vastness, there are no tunes." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{official}} {{music video}} for the song, lasting four minutes and seventeen seconds, was uploaded on 17 August 2015 to the group's Vevo channel on YouTube.

25|$|Genie {{spent almost}} all of her {{childhood}} locked alone in a bedroom with almost no environmental stimuli, where her father left her severely malnourished and almost always kept her either <b>strapped</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> child's toilet or bound inside a crib with {{her arms and legs}} completely immobilized. He refused to speak to or around her, beating her or forcing her brother to do so if she made any sound or showed any emotion, and to discourage her from making any outward expression he would bare his teeth and bark and growl at her like a dog. As a result, she learned not to vocalize or make noise and to remain as unexpressive as possible. On some occasions when she was hungry or seeking some kind of attention she made environmental noises, but otherwise maintained silence at all times.|$|E
25|$|His {{second test}} {{leads him to}} a vat, {{at the bottom of}} which Judge Halden, who gave Dylan's killer six months in jail, is chained at the neck. Large dead pigs drop into a liquidiser and spray Judge Halden with liquified pig, but Jeff reluctantly sets fire to a cage full of Dylan's toys in order to {{retrieve}} the key (hidden inside one of the many toys) and save Halden. His third test brings him before Timothy Young, Dylan's killer, who is <b>strapped</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> machine that will twist his limbs and neck in turn until they break. The key is tied to the trigger of an enclosed shotgun. Jeff eventually tries to free Timothy, but taking the key discharges the shotgun and accidentally kills Halden, and Jeff is unable to stop the machine before Timothy's neck breaks.|$|E
25|$|The gradual {{abandonment}} of naturalism and {{the depiction of}} realistic representations of the visual appearance of subjects in the 19th and 20th centuries led to a rolling controversy lasting for over a century. In the twentieth century, Pablo Picasso's Guernica (1937) used arresting cubist techniques and stark monochromatic oils, to depict the harrowing consequences of a contemporary bombing of a small, ancient Basque town. Leon Golub's Interrogation III (1981), depicts a female nude, hooded detainee <b>strapped</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> chair, her legs open to reveal her sexual organs, surrounded by two tormentors dressed in everyday clothing. Andres Serrano's Piss Christ (1989) is {{a photograph of a}} crucifix, sacred to the Christian religion and representing Christ's sacrifice and final suffering, submerged in a glass of the artist's own urine. The resulting uproar led to comments in the United States Senate about public funding of the arts.|$|E
