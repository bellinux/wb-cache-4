40|$|The {{subject of}} this thesis are {{concepts}} to increase the stabilized efficiency of amorphous silicon solar cells. The work focuses on the p/i-interface region and on the intrinsic absorber layer of p-i-n type solar cells. The increased degradation of solar cells containing buffer layers in the p/i-interface region is explained by a reduction of the built-in electric field in {{the volume of the}} i-layer. A new design of the p/i interface region increases the open-circuit voltage without leading to an increased degradation of the fill factor. Intrinsic layers deposited at low substrate temperatures with a high hydrogen dilution of the <b>silane</b> <b>process</b> gas decrease the degradation of fill factor and open-circuit voltage. Very high hydrogen dilution even leads to an increase of the open-circuit voltage during light soaking. An accompanying materials study shows a correlation between the improved solar cell characteristics and good structural andtransport properties of the new i-material. A simple model is presented to explain the observed effects related to the open-circuit voltage, which is based on an analytical description of the dark I-V curves. The application of the successful results for single-junction cells into tandem cells led to the preparation of an a-Si:H/a-Si:H stacked cell with 9. 2 % stabilized efficiency after less than 10 % relative degradation.

To be compatible with the price goals of the FSA Project, the price of the produced silicon was to be less than 1 O/kg (in 1975 dollars).

40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{research}} work is to test experimentally, how {{the parameters of the}} d. c. glow discharge <b>silane</b> <b>process</b> influence the electronic parameters of the resultant a-Si:H films and the metal a-Si:H junctions. The films were deposited in a two parallel plate electrode system (cathodic films) and in a three electrode system, where the substrate was held on an electrode biased positively with respect to the cathode. An objective for employing the latter system was to determine if polarization of the substrates influence the properties of the deposited a-Si:H films. Undoped a-Si:H films were deposited on single crystal silicon substrates in a range of substrate temperatures and the discharge environment pressures. The structure of the films was studied using x-ray diffraction and SEM techniques. Infrared spectroscopy was employed to examine different hydrogen environments in the films. The temperature dependence of the dark- and photo-conductivity has been investigated. Gold and platinum Schottky barrier photovoltaic cells were fabricated employing discharge-deposited a-Si:H films. Characterization of these cells in terms of dark and illuminated current-voltage measurements was performed. A theoretical model of the amorphous silicon photovoltaic cell, which allowed the development of a computer simulation program for the solar cell operation, has been derived. The films deposited in the three electrode system under bias revealed different composition and, apparently associated with it, better semiconductor quality, than the films deposited in the two electrode system. The films deposited under bias revealed predominately monohydride phase when deposited at 250 (DEGREES) C under pressure 250 mTr in contrast to dihydride and trihydride phase found in the cathodic films. The dark conductivity of the films was found to be 2. 10 (2 Ì 75) (ohm cm) (2 Ì 7 - 1) with activation energy (DELTA) E = 0. 33 eV. The low value of the activation energy resulted probably from oxygen contamination found in the films. The carrier transport in the films was found to be due to electrons in the extended states at temperatures above 240 - 280 (DEGREES) K. At low temperatures phonon assisted hopping transport was significant. The lifetime of electrons was estimated to be 10 (2 Ì 7 - 6) sec. at room temperature. The films deposited in the three electrode system were characterized by the recombination mechanism, which reflected a quasi-exponential distribution of the trapping centers in the mobility gap. The photocells made on the films deposited under the substrate bias revealed both dark and illuminated current-voltage characteristics superior to those of photocells made on the cathodic films. The junction ideality factor was close to unity and the rectification ratio was (TURN) 10 (2 Ì 74). The barrier potential of Au-a-Si:H junction was found to be 0. 87 V.

40|$|We present two {{different}} investigations showing {{the influence of}} hydrogen in hot-wire chemical vapor deposition (HWCVD). First, dissimilarities in the growth kinetics of hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) films by the plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) and HWCVD are discussed. A series of a-Si:H films with varying substrate temperature (T,) was deposited by HWCVD and PECVD. In comparing the initial growth, which was measured by in-situ kinetic ellipsometry for both deposition methods, we conclude that, in the PECVD process, a faster coalescence takes place {{as a result of}} a larger surface mobility of the adsorbed precursor radicals at the growing surface. This dissimilarity can be explained by different <b>silane</b> dissociation <b>processes</b> which yield to a higher ratio of atomic hydrogen to silicon radicals and a lower hydrogen coverage of the film growing surface in the case of HWCVD. Therefore, dense high quality a-Si:H films deposited by HWCVD are formed at higher substrate temperatures and lower hydrogen dilutions compared to PECVD. The second investigation deals with the effect of atomic hydrogen on polished and textured silicon wafers. The hydrogen treatment can decrease the surface defect density without deteriorating the properties of the bulk material. Therefore, the fill factor and the open circuit voltage of (n) a-Si:H/(p) c-Si heterojunction solar cells increase and the intrinsic conversion efficiency reaches up to 15. 2 %.

Critical partial pressures for lower limits of explosion at room temperature (0. 223 mbar) and at deposition temperature (0. 17 mbar) are noticed.

Hybrid technology is the answer for the queries and interests sighted above. Preparation of metal-plastic hybrids by insert injection moulding offers a manufacturing route for multi-functional components in a few processing steps. Nowadays, bonds between metal and plastic are basically established using mechanical methods. However, bonding by chemical method is needed but it is difficult because metals and plastics exhibit different physical and chemical characteristics. Hence coupling agents are used to improve bonding between metal and plastic. Silanes are the most commonly used coupling agents for metal-plastic bonding. The main objective of this thesis was to study the bonding characteristic between steel substrate and silane layer. Different parameters of the <b>silane</b> treatment <b>process</b> affect the structure, uniformity and thickness of silane layer present on the metal surface. Therefore, variations in parameters for silane treatment like pH and concentrations of the silane solution and rinsing methods for maintaining the thickness of silane layer on the metal substrate were tested. Planar and cross-sectional samples were prepared in order test the bonding characteristics. These samples were observed under optical microscope and scanning electron microscope. Certain samples were observed in x-ray photoelectron spectrometer and the results were computed. In order to aid these kinds of tests in future a simulation program was designed using CASINO simulation software. The results obtained from scanning electron microscope were consistent with the earlier published results. Developing a method to observe cross-sectional samples in a scanning electron microscope was difficult because of instability of the silane layer and previously used sample preparation methods. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy confirmed the results obtained using scanning electron microscope. Simulation of experimental conditions was helpful to determine the conditions to be used in experiments. /Kir 1...|$|R

This paper deals with the hydrolysis process of 1 vol% ?-methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane (MPS) in aqueous solution at different pHs (2, 4, 6, 8 and 10). Because the hydrolysis rate is a function of pH, hydrolysis times, ranging from 2 min to 48 h, were studied. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy was used to evaluate the chemical modifications produced by changing the hydrolysis time. The disappearance of the infrared band due to the Si-O-C groups and the appearance of the bands due to the Si-OH bonds were studied.

As an example of the growth of organic multilayered structures on aminosilylated silica, the deposition of polyimide structures was demonstrated. The basic principles of ALD on porous substrates and a review of the literature on the use of <b>silanes</b> in gas-phase <b>processes</b> are presented by way of background. The study showed TG to be a simple and relatively fast technique for determination of the total number of silanol groups on silica. Combined DRIFTS/PLS procedure also enabled fast determination of the total number of silanols after calibration with the results from TG measurements. Separate determination of the different types of silanols was not possible with these methods, however. For reference and practical purposes, the numbers of isolated and hydrogen-bonded silanols were also determined by 1 H MAS (magic angle spinning) NMR, but this is a slower and more expensive technique. Trifunctional Î³-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane (APTMS), Î³-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTS), and N-(2 -aminoethyl) - 3 -aminopropyltrimethoxysilane (AAPS); bifunctional Î³-aminopropyldiethoxymethylsilane (APDMS); and monofunctional Î³-aminopropyldimethylethoxysilane (APDMES) were used as precursors for the deposition of amino-functionalized surfaces on silica. The aminosilylated silica surfaces were characterized by DRIFTS, solid-state 29 Si and 13 C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and elemental analyses. According to the results, homogeneous aminosilylated silica surfaces can be prepared by ALD at low temperatures (â¤Â  150 Â Â°C) in a reproducible way by a solvent-free procedure. The deposition of a single surface-saturated molecular layer on silica led to densities between 1. 0 and 2. 1 amino groups/nm 2 depending on the pretreatment temperature of silica (200 - 800 Â Â°C) and the precursor. The highest amino group density was achieved with the bifunctional precursor, APDMS, on silica pretreated at 200 Â Â°C. The use of relatively high deposition temperatures, i. e. 150 - 300 Â Â°C, led to side-reactions between the amino groups of bi- and trifunctional precursors and silanol groups or alkoxy groups of other precursor molecules on silica. The amino group density could be better controlled when sequential reactions of trifunctional aminopropylalkoxysilanes and water were applied. Thus, depending on the number of APTS/-, APTMS/-, or AAPS/water cycles, surface densities from 1. 5 - 1. 9 to 2. 8 - 3. 0 terminal amino groups/nm 2 were achieved. After four cycles the surface was saturated and a constant surface density of nitrogen and carbon atoms was achieved. The deposition of a monolayer on the surface was thus achieved. reviewe...|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} pellicular {{particles}} was suggested by HorvÃ¡th and Lipsky over fifty years ago. The reasoning behind {{the idea of}} these particles was to improve column efficiency by shortening the pathways analyte molecules can travel, therefore reducing {{the effect of the}} A and C terms. Several types of shell particles were successfully marketed around this time, however with the introduction of high quality fully porous silica under 10 Î¼m, shell particles faded into the background. In recent years a new generation of core shell particles have become popular within the separation science community. These particles allow fast and efficient separations that can be carried out on conventional HPLC systems. Chapter 1 of this thesis introduces the chemistry of chromatographic stationary phases, with an emphasis on silica bonded phases, particularly focusing on the current state of technology in this area. The main focus is on superficially porous silica particles as a support material for liquid chromatography. A summary of the history and development of these particles {{over the past few decades}} is explored, along with current methods of synthesis of shell particles. While commercial shell particles have a rough outer surface, Chapter 2 focuses on the novel approach to growth of smooth surface superficially porous particles in a step-by-step manner. From the StÃ¶ber methodology to the seeded growth technique, and finally to the layer-bylayer growth of the porous shell. The superficially porous particles generated in this work have an overall diameter of 2. 6 Î¼m with a 350 nm porous shell; these silica particles were characterised using SEM, TEM and BET analysis. The uniform spherical nature of the particles along with their surface area, pore size and particle size distribution are examined in this chapter. I discovered that these smooth surface shell particles can be synthesised to give comparable surface area and pore size in comparison to commercial brands. Chapter 3 deals with the bonding of the particles prepared in Chapter 2 with C 18 functionality; one with a narrow and one with a wide particle size distribution. This chapter examines the chromatographic and kinetic performance of these silica stationary phases, and compares them to a commercial superficially porous silica phase with a rough outer surface. I found that the particle size distribution does not seem to be the major contributor to the improvement in efficiency. The surface morphology of the particles appears to play an important role in the packing process of these particles and influences the Van Deemter effects. Chapter 4 focuses on the functionalisation of 2. 6 Î¼m smooth surface superficially porous particles with a variety of fluorinated and phenyl <b>silanes.</b> The same <b>processes</b> were carried out on 3. 0 Î¼m fully porous silica particles to provide a comparison. All phases were accessed using elemental analysis, thermogravimetric analysis, nitrogen sorption analysis and chromatographically evaluated using the Neue test. I observed comparable results for the 2. 6 Î¼m shell pentaflurophenyl propyl silica when compared to 3. 0 Î¼m fully porous silica. Chapter 5 moves towards nano-particles, with the synthesis of sub- 1 Î¼m superficially porous particles, their characterisation and use in chromatography. The particles prepared are 750 nm in total with a 100 nm shell. All reactions and testing carried out on these 750 nm core shell particles are also carried out on 1. 5 Î¼m fully porous particles in order to give a comparative result. The 750 nm core shell particles can be synthesised quickly and are very uniform. The main drawback in their use for HPLC is the system itself due to the backpressure experienced using sub â 1 Î¼m particles. The synthesis of modified StÃ¶ber particles is also examined in this chapter with a range of non-porous silica and shell silica from 70 nm â 750 nm being tested for use on a Langmuir â Blodgett system. These smooth surface shell particles have only been in existence since 2009. The results displayed in this thesis demonstrate how much potential smooth surface shell particles have provided more in-depth optimisation is carried out. The results on packing studies reported in this thesis aims to be a starting point for a more sophisticated methodology, which in turn can lead to greater chromatographic improvements...|$|R
