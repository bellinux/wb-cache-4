40|$|Childhood obesity {{around the}} world, and {{particularly}} in the United States, is an escalating problem that is especially detrimental as its effects carry on into adulthood. In this paper we employ the 1979 Child-Young Adult National Longitudinal Survey of Youth and the 1997 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth to estimate the effects of fast-food restaurant advertising on children and adolescents being overweight. The advertising measure used is the number of hours of <b>spot</b> <b>television</b> fast-food restaurant advertising messages seen per week. Our results indicate that a ban on these advertisements would reduce the number of overweight children ages 3 - 11 in a fixed population by 10 percent and would reduce the number of overweight adolescents ages 12 - 18 by 12 percent. The elimination of the tax deductibility of this type of advertising would produce smaller declines of between 3 and 5 percent in these outcomes but would impose lower costs on children and adults who consume fast food in moderation because positive information about restaurants that supply this type of food would not be banned completely from television. ...|$|E
40|$|There is {{insufficient}} {{research on the}} direct effects of food advertising on children's diet and diet-related health, particularly in non-experimental settings. We employ a nationally-representative sample from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Survey–Kindergarten Cohort (ECLS-K) and the Nielsen Company data on <b>spot</b> <b>television</b> advertising of cereals, fast food restaurants and soft drinks to children across the top 55 designated-market areas to estimate the relation between exposure to food advertising on television and children's food consumption and body weight. Our results suggest that soft drink and fast food television advertising is associated with increased consumption of soft drinks and fast food among elementary school children (Grade 5). Exposure to 100 incremental TV ads for sugar-sweetened carbonated soft drinks during 2002 - 2004 {{was associated with a}} 9. 4 % rise in children's consumption of soft drinks in 2004. The same increase in exposure to fast food advertising was associated with a 1. 1 % rise in children's consumption of fast food. There was no detectable link between advertising exposure and average body weight, but fast food advertising was significantly associated with body mass index for overweight and obese children (>= 85 th BMI percentile), revealing detectable effects for a vulnerable group of children. Exposure to advertising for calorie-dense nutrient-poor foods may increase overall consumption of unhealthy food categories. ...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to study how <b>television</b> <b>spot</b> and product {{placement}} compare in terms of gaining the target audience’s attention, having control over the marketing message and creating credibility for a product or a brand. The context {{of the study is}} Finnish television from advertisers’ point of view. Three major theories used are: AIDA, Generic Communications Process and Two-Step Communications. Twelve hypotheses are built based on the theories, the main hypothesis being: “Although a marketing message sent through product placement gains the target audience’s attention better and creates higher credibility for a product or a brand than a <b>television</b> <b>spot,</b> advertisers are keener on sending the marketing message through a <b>television</b> <b>spot</b> than through product placement because they have more control over the message in a <b>television</b> <b>spot</b> and because it historically has a more stable legal position. ” Five experts on the field were interviewed to test the hypotheses.
