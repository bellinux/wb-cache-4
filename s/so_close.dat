5|$|Perhaps fittingly for an area <b>so</b> <b>close</b> to Trafford Park, the world's first planned {{industrial}} estate, {{one of the}} world's first {{industrial espionage}} agents, John Holker, was born in Stretford, in 1719.|$|E
5|$|The {{birth of}} wolf pups <b>so</b> <b>close</b> {{to the state}} border raised the {{probability}} of a future long-term wolf population in California. In June 2014, the California Fish and Game Commission voted 3–1 to protect those wolves under the state Endangered Species Act.|$|E
3000|$|... (2.) Heuristic, {{which is}} visibility, {{is defined as}} the inverse of the distance, and <b>so,</b> <b>closer</b> nodes have a higher chance of being next.|$|R
5000|$|By a field we {{will mean}} every {{infinite}} system of real or complex numbers <b>so</b> <b>closed</b> in itself and perfect that addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of any {{two of these}} numbers again yields {{a number of the}} system. Richard Dedekind, 1871 ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>So</b> <b>closed</b> the task. [...] "Deathless the Creed [...] Here substanced!" [...] said my soul: [...] "I {{heard me}} bidden to this deed, [...] And {{straight}} obeyed the call. [...] Illume this fane, [...] That not in vain [...] I build it, Lord of all!" ...|$|R
5|$|A second {{possible}} aetosaur nest site {{is known}} from northeastern Italy. The nests are preserved as depressions in carbonate rock that are circular or horseshoe-shaped, with high ridges around the sides. They {{appear to be}} unusually complex for nests created by Triassic reptiles. Archosaur footprints were found nearby that resembled aetosaurs, although they were not present in the same layer. Because the tracks were found <b>so</b> <b>close</b> to the nests, {{it is likely that}} aetosaurs built them.|$|E
5|$|Another {{person to}} testify was Robert Havelka, {{who worked as}} a {{security}} guard the night of the incident. Havelka said that the guardrail was too close to the stage, but not <b>so</b> <b>close</b> as to make a platform for climbing the stage. He testified that he pulled one person off the stage and that another person fell off before he could be secured. He further said that the fan's fall might have been helped by someone else, perhaps the singer, though he did not see it precisely.|$|E
5|$|As Tropical Storm Jose formed <b>so</b> <b>close</b> {{to shore}} {{there was a}} lead time of less than 9hours on the {{tropical}} storm warning for the Veracruz coastline. The area covered by the warning issued on August 22 was extended southwards as Jose intensified, before being canceled soon after landfall on August 23. The advisories issued by the National Hurricane Center emphasized that rainfall from Jose was the primary threat.|$|E
25|$|Although most dialects of Czech and Slovak are {{mutually}} intelligible (see Comparison of Slovak and Czech), eastern Slovak dialects are less intelligible to speakers of Czech and more <b>so</b> <b>closer</b> to Polish and mutual contact between speakers of Czech and speakers {{of the eastern}} dialects is limited.|$|R
50|$|Ultimately, Lalulal and Yashodara are {{murdered by}} the latter's family, {{as the family}} wants Yashodara to support them instead of marrying Lalulal. Ghulam decides to return to Lucknow, but {{procrastination}} prevents him from doing <b>so.</b> <b>Closing</b> shots show him driving his taxi {{in the city of}} dreams.|$|R
50|$|The {{families}} visit {{each other}} several times {{for various reasons}} and get <b>so</b> <b>closer.</b> Niko's spinster aunt Katina gets married with a Turkish man, much exasperating her mother Efthalia. Even the initial hatred between the older members of the families, Memik Dede and Efthalia, turns to a romantic affair.|$|R
5|$|F. emasculata and Pinck Pharmaceuticals are fictitious, but {{pharmaceutical}} companies do send scientists {{all over the}} world looking for plants and animals that could have medicinal use. The appearance of The Smoking Man in a stand-alone episode is unusual, as Chris Carter did not like mixing the mythology and stand-alone episodes. Initially, the producers were wary of releasing the episode <b>so</b> <b>close</b> to the release of the similarly-themed movie Outbreak. In the end, however, they realized that the two entities were separate and stood on their own.|$|E
5|$|Gliese 876 {{is located}} fairly {{close to the}} Solar System. According to astrometric {{measurements}} made by the Hipparcos satellite, the star shows a parallax of 213.28 milliarcseconds, which corresponds to a distance of , currently making it the third-closest known star with orbiting planets, after Epsilon Eridani and Gliese 674. Despite being located <b>so</b> <b>close</b> to Earth, the star is so faint that it is invisible {{to the naked eye}} and can only be seen using a telescope.|$|E
5|$|Holy Trinity Church on Boar Lane was {{constructed}} between 1721 and 1727, built to a design by William Etty. It is a Grade I listed building. The building {{has not changed}} much (although a new steeple was built in 1839 by R D Chantrell), but developments such as the Burton Arcade and the Leeds Shopping Plaza have been built <b>so</b> <b>close</b> {{that it is difficult}} to see the full exterior of the building as was once possible.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah," [...] said Clara, [...] "the {{last thing}} my little darling looked at was the {{pictures}} in Uncle Tom; {{when she came to}} the death of Eva, she said, 'Now I am weary, I will go to sleep;' and <b>so</b> <b>closed</b> her eyes, and never opened them more." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>So</b> <b>closed</b> the consultation; {{and after}} an evening which Lucilla perforce {{rendered}} lively, {{she and her}} brother took their leave. The next day they were to accompany the Charterises to Castle Blanch {{to prepare for the}} festivities; Honor and her two young friends following on the Wednesday afternoon.|$|R
50|$|C&A and Beatties former {{store in}} Birmingham, {{is now a}} {{shopping}} centre with three stores; New Look and Mothercare. The former department store site has undergone a £5 million facelift. The Beatties store opened in Birmingham in 2001 but never managed {{to make a profit}} <b>so</b> <b>closed</b> down in 2006.|$|R
5|$|In addition, most {{researchers}} have speculated {{as to why}} Sydney was <b>so</b> <b>close</b> to an unknown vessel, with various levels of blame assigned to Captain Burnett for the demise of his ship. Theories to explain Burnett's actions include that he was inexperienced or incompetent, deceived by Kormorans disguise, {{the idea that he}} was under conflicting orders instructing that raiders be attacked at range but enemy supply ships be captured, or {{that he was trying to}} clearly identify the merchantman.|$|E
5|$|It often also {{falls in}} the same range for {{reaction}} order, resembling terbium and dysprosium in its chemical reactivity. Yttrium is <b>so</b> <b>close</b> in size to the so-called 'yttrium group' of heavy lanthanide ions that in solution, it behaves {{as if it were}} one of them. Even though the lanthanides are one row farther down the periodic table than yttrium, the similarity in atomic radius may be attributed to the lanthanide contraction.|$|E
5|$|One {{piece of}} {{evidence}} for such a past resonance is Miranda's unusually high orbital inclination (4.34°) for a body <b>so</b> <b>close</b> to the planet. The largest Uranian moons may be internally differentiated, with rocky cores at their centers surrounded by ice mantles. Titania and Oberon may harbor liquid water oceans at the core/mantle boundary. The major moons of Uranus are airless bodies. For instance, Titania was shown to possess no atmosphere at a pressure larger than 10–20nanobar.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Or {{if they do}} delight therein, yet are <b>so</b> <b>closed</b> with wit, [...] As with sententious lips to set a title vain on it; [...] Oh {{let them}} hear these sacred tunes, and learn in Wonder's schools [...] To be, in things past bonds of wit, fools if they be not fools!' ...|$|R

50|$|There are {{currently}} 44 publicly acknowledged closed cities in Russia {{with a total}} population of about 1.5 million people. 75% are administered by the Russian Ministry of Defense, with the rest being administered by Rosatom. Another 15 or <b>so</b> <b>closed</b> cities are believed to exist, but their names and locations have not been publicly disclosed by the Russian government.|$|R
5|$|Some {{believers in}} a 2012 doomsday claimed that a planet called PlanetX, or Nibiru, would collide with or pass by the Earth. This idea, which {{appeared}} in various forms since 1995, initially predicted Doomsday in May 2003, but proponents abandoned that date after it passed without incident. The idea originated from claims of channeling alien beings and is widely ridiculed. Astronomers calculated that such an object <b>so</b> <b>close</b> to Earth would be visible to anyone {{looking up at the}} night sky.|$|E
5|$|Sometime {{during their}} journey or their {{stay in the}} region, Rebmann and Krapf learned of a great {{mountain}} referred to as 'Kilimansharo', which reached the clouds and which was 'capped in silver'. The two men, like most Europeans at the time, were {{under the impression that}} snow and ice could not exist <b>so</b> <b>close</b> to the equator, and failed to realize the significance of the mountain being 'topped with silver'.|$|E
5|$|Teammate {{and quarterback}} Benny Lom chased Riegels, {{screaming}} {{at him to}} stop. Known for his speed, Lom {{finally caught up with}} Riegels at California's 3-yard line and tried to turn him around, but he was immediately hit by a wave of Tech players and tackled back to the 1-yard line. The Bears chose to punt rather than risk a play <b>so</b> <b>close</b> to their own end zone, but Tech's Vance Maree blocked Lom's punt for a safety, giving Georgia Tech a 2–0 lead.|$|E

60|$|He stayed. And {{with this}} {{fulfillment}} of his youthful dreams {{the romance of}} his young manhood seemed to be completed, and <b>so</b> <b>closed</b> the second volume of this trilogy. But what effect that fulfillment of youth had upon his maturer years, or the fortunes {{of those who were}} nearly concerned in it, may be told in a later and final chronicle.|$|R
60|$|But {{three days}} was all Wolf Larsen allowed him {{in which to}} recover from the effects of the beating. On the fourth day, lame and sore, {{scarcely}} able to see, <b>so</b> <b>closed</b> were his eyes, he was haled from his bunk by the nape of the neck and set to his duty. He sniffled and wept, but Wolf Larsen was pitiless.|$|R
5|$|The bee-eaters are diurnal (active by day), {{although}} a few species may migrate during the night if the terrain en route is unsuitable for stopping or if they are crossing the sea. Bee-eaters are highly social, and pairs sitting or roosting together are often <b>so</b> <b>close</b> that they touch (an individual distance of zero). Many species are colonial in the breeding season and some species are also highly gregarious when not nesting.|$|E
5|$|The employees, however, did {{not like}} living <b>so</b> <b>close</b> to their employers. They complained about the {{distance}} to the city and the transportation problems, and they criticised the rental rates and the reserves they had to make. After the deaths of Matthes and van Marken, however, the park gradually evolved into a desirable residential area. In 1931 the villa, Rust Roest, which had long been empty, was converted into a school. It was demolished in 1981. Since 1989, the park has been listed as Cultural heritage.|$|E
5|$|The {{location}} in Elvebakken was somewhat controversial in Alta, {{especially as the}} airport would be located <b>so</b> <b>close</b> to the town center, potentially causing noise pollution. An alternative at Sokkelma was considered, but this was discarded because the surrounding mountains prevented good landing conditions. The decision to build Alta Airport was made in 1961, followed by additional expropriation of land. Construction was carried out simultaneously with that of Banak and Kirkenes Airport, Høybuktmoen, which combined would give Finnmark three primary airports.|$|E
50|$|A {{practical}} {{difference between}} dynamic and positive displacement pumps {{is how they}} operate under closed valve conditions. Positive displacement pumps physically displace fluid, <b>so</b> <b>closing</b> a valve downstream of a positive displacement pump produces a continual pressure build up that can cause mechanical failure of pipeline or pump. Dynamic pumps differ in {{that they can be}} safely operated under closed valve conditions (for short periods of time).|$|R
6000|$|My aunt {{caught me}} by the hand, and whispered, [...] "Stand between us {{for a minute or}} two. Don't let Rachel see me." [...] I noticed a bluish tinge in her face which alarmed me. She saw I was startled. [...] "The drops will put me right in a minute or two," [...] she said, and <b>so</b> <b>closed</b> her eyes, and waited a little.|$|R
