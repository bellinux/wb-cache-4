40|$|The clinic-based {{healthcare}} model {{does not}} deliver high quality, cost-effective care to populations of patients. Despite public perception that aggressive investment {{in information technology}} will lead to improvements in the safety and quality of healthcare delivery, {{there is little evidence}} that health information technology can be used to promote population-based health management. This paper describes the use of a standards-based clinical decision support system to facilitate proactive population health management using data from a regional health information exchange (HIE) network. The initial release of this system was designed to detect ten <b>sentinel</b> <b>health</b> <b>events</b> related to hospitalization, emergency department (ED) utilization, and care coordination in a population of 36, 000 individuals.

Medical evaluation showed abnormal pulmonary function tests, a lung biopsy showed hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and his illness was traced to his work environment. His physician asked the employer to remove him from exposure to metalworking fluids. Symptoms reoccurred when he was later reexposed to metalworking fluids, and further permanent decrement in his lung function occurred. Investigation of his workplace showed that five of six large reservoirs of metalworking fluids (cutting oils) grew Mycobacterium chelonae (or Mycobacterium immunogenum), an organism previously associated with outbreaks of hypersensitivity pneumonitis in automaking factories.

40|$|This article {{describes}} a computer-based {{application of the}} <b>Sentinel</b> <b>Health</b> <b>Event</b> (Occupational) [SHE(O) ] concept, developed in conjunction with five states, to monitor deaths which are occupationally related. The states have coded their state death certificate files for industry and occupation, using the decedent's usual occupation and industry as reported on the death certificate. From these files, the SHE(O) computer program selects deaths which {{are likely to be}} work-related, based on a previously published SHE(O) list of 50 disease rubrics and associated industries and occupations. The computer program matches the SHE(O) list with the recorded industry, occupation, and underlying cause of death. The program has been tested using 1984 death certificate data from Maine, upstate New York (excluding New York City), North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island. Approximately 1 to 2 per cent of all deaths were selected by the program, with lung cancer and coal workers' pneumoconiosis being the most frequent cause of death. The SHE(O) program may be useful for identifying deaths which are potentially occupationally related, but its utility and its application to death certificates needs further evaluation before recommending widespread use. Limitations are discussed, as well as plans for improving the application of the SHE(O) concept to death certificates...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Experiencing {{a serious}} adverse behavior-related {{consequence}} may motivate behavior change. PURPOSE: To examine how a <b>sentinel</b> <b>health</b> <b>event</b> {{is associated with}} changes in smoking. Methods: We used a prospective cohort design. Adult emergency department (ED) patients provided demographic data, a smoking history, ratings of quit intentions, and endorsement of self-identified smoking-related health problems. A chart review collected data on acuity, ED disposition, and medical diagnoses. Smoking was reassessed 1 month postvisit. Hierarchical regression {{analyses were conducted to}} predict (a) intention to quit, (b) any quit attempt of 24 hr or more, and (3) 7 -day abstinence. RESULTS: Of 717 smokers enrolled, 189 (26 %) intended to quit within the next month. Of the 253 participants reached 1 month postvisit, 126 (50 %) reported they had attempted to quit, with 44 (19 %) reporting 7 -day abstinence. After controlling for other predictors, several event-related variables, such as having a smoking-related ED visit and being admitted to the hospital, were strong predictors of outcomes. CONCLUSION: Compared to community-based estimates, many more smokers in our sample attempted to quit and achieved 7 -day abstinence. This was especially true among smokers who attributed their ED visit to a smoking-related health problem and who were admitted to the hospital. We discuss the implications for tobacco intervention design in medical settings...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES. In {{response}} to limitations in state-based occupational disease surveillance, the California Department of Health Services developed {{a model for}} surveillance of acute, work-related pesticide illness. The objectives were to enhance case reporting and link case reports to preventive interventions. METHODS. Elements from surveillance of communicable diseases and <b>sentinel</b> <b>health</b> <b>events</b> were used to integrate a model into the preexisting system in one agricultural country. RESULTS. Between 1988 and 1991, 45 Fresno County health care providers reported 230 suspected cases, of which 217 from 80 work sites met reporting guidelines. Risk factors were profiled from interviews of 81 prioritized case patients and 36 employers. Fifteen work sites were visited and 117 recommendations were made, of which 6 % were identified in enforcement inspections. Pest management experts consulted with growers on reducing future pesticide use. CONCLUSIONS. Risk factors for pesticide illness were prevalent. Agricultural inspectors did not detect routine and serious hazards. Integrated pest management should be expanded and linked to occupational health.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{describe}} pesticide exposure in the population of callers to Minnesota Regional Poison Centers. Case files from 1988 reporting pesticide exposure to humans were identified in cooperation with the Minnesota Center for Health Statistics. Data analysis was conducted by computer using SAS statistical package. Of the 1, 428 case files indicating pesticide as the primary substance of exposure to Minnesota residents, a mean age of 5 years (range, one month to 85 years) was identified; 50 percent of all cases were below age 3 years. Males accounted for 1. 3 times as many cases as females. Insecticide was identified in the largest percentage of case files (74 percent) followed by herbicide (12 percent), rodenticide (11 percent) and fungicide-nonmedicinal (3 percent). Ingestion was the most common route of exposure; 85 percent of all calls originated from a residence. While insecticides are still the most common types of pesticide call, herbicide has surpassed insecticide in production and sales in the US. In this study, herbicide type exposure calls present a much different picture than other pesticide types. The usefulness of poison control centers for examination of pesticide poisoning is explored.

40|$|Widespread {{concern about}} the social, economic, and health {{consequences}} of teenage pregnancy has led to statewide efforts to reduce those pregnancies. Girls under age 18 are a special concern {{because they have not}} reached the age of legal consent, they are often less mature biologically, and they are less apt to have adequate support systems. Narrowing the focus a bit, Governor Hunt’s 1995 “agenda for action ” supports actions to discourage teenage parents from having another child until they are “married, have completed their education, and are ready to raise a strong family. ” 1 To the extent that effective family planning and other programs can help accomplish that mission, more babies will be born healthy and live in a healthy environment.

Methods: From October to December 2005, all cases of maternal death (MD), near-miss (NM), fetal deaths (FD), and early neonatal deaths (END), occurring in Campinas, Brazil, were audited by maternal mortality committees. Results: A total of 4, 491 liveborn infants (LB) and 159 adverse perinatal events (35. 4 / 1000 LB) were revised, consisting of 4 MD (89 / 100. 000 LB) and 95 NM (21. 1 / 1000 LB), 23. 7 NM for each MD. In addition, 32 FD (7. 1 / 1000 LB) and 28 END (6. 2 / 1000 LB) occurred. The maternal death/near miss rate was 23. 7 : 1.

Methods: The program combines (1) surveillance of <b>sentinel</b> <b>health</b> <b>events</b> {{in the general population}} (carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) was the sentinel event for upper limb MSDs), (2) assessment of the prevalence of the main upper limb MSDs and their risk factors in the workplace based on a network of occupational physicians and (3) registration of the notification of work-related diseases (WRDs). Results: 1168 incident cases of CTS were included over a 3 year period. The estimated incidence of CTS was 1. 00 per 1000 person-years in those aged 20 – 59 years (0. 60 in men and 1. 40 in women). The incidence rate was higher in employed than unemployed persons in the year of diagnosis (0. 6 per 1000 vs 0. 3 in men and 1. 7 vs 0. 8 in women). The occupational physician network noted high prevalence rates: 11 % of men and 15 % of women had {{at least one of the}} six main upper limb clinically-diagnosed MSDs.

Drift included off-target movement of pesticide spray, volatiles, and contaminated dust. Acute illness cases were characterized by demographics, pesticide and application variables, health effects, and contributing factors. |From 1998 through 2006, we identified 2, 945 cases associated with agricultural pesticide drift from 11 states. Our findings indicate that 47 % were exposed at work, 92 % experienced low-severity illness, and 14 % were children (< 15 years). The annual incidence ranged from 1. 39 to 5. 32 per million persons over the 9 -year period. The overall incidence (in million person-years) was 114. 3 for agricultural workers, 0. 79 for other workers, 1. 56 for nonoccupational cases, and 42. 2 for residents in five agriculture-intensive counties in California. Soil applications with fumigants were responsible for the largest percentage (45 %) of cases. Aerial applications accounted for 24 % of cases. Common factors contributing to drift cases included weather conditions, improper seal of the fumigation site, and applicator carelessness near nontarget areas. |Agricultural workers and residents in agricultural regions had the highest rate of pesticide poisoning from drift exposure, and soil fumigations were a major hazard, causing large drift incidents. Our findings highlight areas where interventions to reduce off-target drift could be focused...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{parents and}} children in the longitudinal Panel Study of Income Dynamics and PSID-Child Development Supplement to identify how a child's level of skills is affected by the onset of a negative parental <b>health</b> <b>event.</b> I estimate effects for two measures of health events—the diagnosis of one of eleven specific health conditions and an unspecified physical or nervous condition—each of which are reported to limit the activities of the parent. For both measures of <b>health</b> <b>events,</b> the analysis suggests that the onset of a parental <b>health</b> <b>event</b> has, on average, small negative effects on the level of children's noncognitive skills. However, small average effects mask heterogeneous effects across: the sex of the parent, sex of the child, and the type of health condition. Specifically, parental <b>health</b> <b>events</b> are estimated to significantly impair noncognitive skill development when a father is afflicted with a <b>health</b> <b>event,</b> affect sons more negatively than daughters, and are worse for certain—vascular or cancerous—conditions. Further exploration suggests that effects of parental <b>health</b> <b>events</b> on skill investments are driven by the hypothesized mechanism, changes in skill investments. Specifically, when parental <b>health</b> <b>events</b> are estimated to create the poorest behavior outcomes, large reductions in one measure of skill investment, time that parents participate in activities with children, is also commonly found. parental health; skills; children...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} effect of serious <b>health</b> <b>events</b> {{including}} new diagnoses of heart attacks, strokes, cancers, chronic lung disease, chronic heart failure, diabetes, and heart disease on future smoking status up to 6 years postevent. Data come from the Health and Retirement Study, a nationally representative longitudinal survey of Americans aged 51 - 61 in 1991, followed every 2 years from 1992 to 1998. Smoking status is evaluated at each of three follow-ups, (1994, 1996, and 1998) {{as a function of}} <b>health</b> <b>events</b> between each of the four waves. Acute and chronic <b>health</b> <b>events</b> are associated with much lower likelihood of smoking both in the wave immediately following the event and up to 6 years later. However, future events do not retrospectively predict past cessation. In sum, serious <b>health</b> <b>events</b> have substantial impacts on cessation rates of older smokers. Notably, these effects persist for as much as 6 years after a <b>health</b> <b>event.</b> This research was {{supported by a grant from}} the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (# 039787), as part of the Transdisciplinary Tobacco Use Research Center at Yal...|$|R
40|$|We {{studied the}} effect of <b>health</b> <b>events</b> (accidents and chronic diseases) on the {{occupation}} probabilities at the individual level, while accounting for both correlated individual and time effects. Using difference-in-differences with exact matching estimators, we found that <b>health</b> <b>events</b> have a strong impact on individual labor market histories. The workers affected by a healt event have a stronger probability of entering inactivity and a lower probability of keeping their jobs. We {{also found that the}} less qualied workers, women, and workers with short term jobs are the most negatively affected by <b>health</b> <b>events.</b> chronic illness, <b>health,</b> labor, difference in differences...|$|R
