Many fleets today admit that tire-pressure checking is a major problem in enforcement.

40|$|This paper investigates {{stochastic}} {{analysis of}} transit segment hourly passenger load factor variation for transit capacity {{and quality of}} service (QoS) analysis using Automatic Fare Collection data for a premium radial bus route in Brisbane, Australia. It compares stochastic analysis to traditional peak hour factor (PHF) analysis to gain further insight into variability of transit route segments’ passenger loading during a study hour. It demonstrates that hourly design load factor is a useful method of modeling a route segment’s capacity and QoS time history across the study weekday. This analysis method is readily adaptable to different passenger load standards by adjusting design percentile, reflecting either a more relaxed or more stringent condition. This paper also considers hourly coefficient of variation of load factor as a capacity and QoS assessment measure, in particular through its relationships with hourly average and design load factors. Smaller value reflects uniform passenger loading, which is generally indicative of well dispersed passenger boarding demands and good <b>schedule</b> <b>maintenance.</b> Conversely, higher value may be indicative of pulsed or uneven passenger boarding demands, poor <b>schedule</b> <b>maintenance,</b> and/or bus bunching. An assessment table based on hourly coefficient of variation of load factor is developed and applied to this case study.

40|$|The {{traditional}} approach for maintenance scheduling concerns single-resource (machine) maintenance during production {{which may not}} be sufficient to improve production system reliability as a whole. Besides, in the literature many researchers <b>schedule</b> <b>maintenance</b> activities periodically with fixed maintenance duration. However, in a real manufacturing system maintenance activities can be executed earlier and the maintenance duration will become shorter since less time and effort are required. A practical example is that in a plastic production system, the proportion of machine-related downtime is even lower than mould-related downtime. The planned production operations are usually interrupted seriously because of the mismatch among the maintenance periods between injection machine and mould. In this connection, this paper proposes to jointly schedule production and maintenance tasks of multi-resources in order to improve production system reliability by reducing the mismatch among various processes. To integrate machine and mould maintenance tasks in production, this paper attempts to model the production scheduling with mould scheduling (PS-MS) problem with time-dependent deteriorating maintenance schemes. The objective {{of this paper is to}} propose a genetic algorithm approach to <b>schedule</b> <b>maintenance</b> tasks jointly with production jobs for the PS-MS problem, so as to minimise the makespan of production jobs.
