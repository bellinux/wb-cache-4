40|$|<b>Servant</b> {{leadership}} {{has been researched}} internationally and various types of favourable individual, team, and organisational outcomes {{have been linked to}} the construct. Different <b>servant</b> leadership measures have been validated to date and a clear distinction has been made between the theory of <b>servant</b> leadership and other leadership theories. However, it seems that research on the implementation of <b>servant</b> leadership within an organisation is still in need. The main functions of a <b>servant</b> leader are not yet conceptualised in the literature to help researchers or practitioners to implement <b>servant</b> leadership successfully within organisations. After conducting a systematic literature review, the main functions of a <b>servant</b> leader were identified. These functions were clustered into strategic <b>servant</b> leadership and operational <b>servant</b> leadership and supported by <b>servant</b> leadership characteristics and competencies as defined by current literature. The results of this study might help practitioners to develop <b>servant</b> leaders more effectively and assist organisations to cultivate a <b>servant</b> leadership culture within companies.

Sometimes these were placed on a mezzanine floor, as at Kinross. <b>Servants</b> were less visible, using backstairs that kept them away from members of the family and guests and they fulfilled necessary and sometimes unpleasant tasks. They were also fewer in number, of lower social status and predominately female. A country house could have 10 to 20 <b>servants</b> and large houses had more. A hierarchy of positions developed from the butler and housekeeper to footmen and maids. The sexes were increasingly segregated into their own quarters.|$|E
40|$|<b>Servant</b> {{leadership}} {{is a growing}} topic in the leadership literature. Our study considered <b>servant</b> leadershipâ€™s relationship to two outcomes, core self-evaluation and job satisfaction. The former is particularly noteworthy because if <b>servant</b> leadership predicts core self-evaluation this would confirm that <b>servant</b> leadership affects important changes in employees as people, a central tenet of <b>servant</b> leadership. In addition, if <b>servant</b> leadership predicts core self-evaluation, this could add {{to the question of}} whether core self-evaluation is a non-changeable personality trait or is potentially malleable. We conducted a field study of three firms and found that <b>servant</b> leadership predicts both core self-evaluation and job satisfaction, and that core self-evaluation also predicts job satisfaction. This study contributes to <b>servant</b> leadership, and in general to values-based leadership, by observing a predictive relationship to core self-evaluation, which potentially adds new information about the impact <b>servant</b> leadership can have on individuals. This study confirms the findings of previous authors who found that <b>servant</b> leadership predicts job satisfaction...|$|R

40|$|Purpose - This paper {{seeks to}} explore whether the Western concept of <b>servant</b> {{leadership}} holds the same {{meaning in the}} public sector of the cross-cultural context of China and to identify whether there is an alternative term in the Chinese language that closely relates to the concept of <b>servant</b> leadership Design/methodology/approach - An inductive approach is adopted based on critical incident technique, using an open-ended survey to collect the data. Findings - It was found that the concept of <b>servant</b> leadership holds parallel meaning in China to that of the West and that the Chinese concept of <b>servant</b> leadership can be described precisely as public <b>servant</b> leadership {{in the public sector}} and <b>servant</b> leadership in the non-public sector. When asked to characterize Chinese <b>servant</b> leadership in the public sector, the study respondents consider six types of <b>servant</b> leadership similar to the West but also three types of Chinese extended <b>servant</b> leadership. Originality/value - The paper is a first attempt to examine <b>servant</b> leadership in the public sector in China.
