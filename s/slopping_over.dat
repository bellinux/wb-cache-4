60|$|Also, I found much {{delight in}} looking at the molten iron, boiling and {{bubbling}} in the furnace, and sometimes <b>slopping</b> <b>over,</b> when stirred by the attendant. There were numberless fires on all sides, blinding us with their intense glow; and continually the pounding strokes of huge hammers, some wielded by machinery and others by human arms. I had a respect for these stalwart workmen, who seemed to be near kindred of the machines amid which they wrought,--mighty men, smiting stoutly, and looking into the fierce eyes of the furnace fearlessly, and handling the iron at a temperature which would have taken the skin off from ordinary fingers. They looked strong, indeed, but pale; for the hot atmosphere in which they live cannot but be deleterious, and I suppose their very strength wears them quickly out. But I would rather live ten years as an iron-smith than fifty as a tailor.|$|E

6000|$|One day I undertook, unaided, {{to drive}} home a small troop of cattle we had {{purchased}} {{at a distance of}} a good many leagues, and was in the saddle from morning till after dark in a continuous flooding rain and violent wind. The wind was against me, and the beasts were incessantly trying to turn and rush back to the place they had been taken from, and the fight with wind and cattle went wearily on, the driving rain gradually soaking through my woollen poncho, theft through my clothes to my skin, and trickling down until my long boots were full and <b>slopping</b> <b>over</b> at the knees. For the last half of that midwinter day my feet and legs were devoid of feeling. The result of it was rheumatic fever and years of bad health, with constant attacks of acute pain and violent palpitation of the heart which would last for hours at a stretch. From time to time I was sent or taken to consult a doctor in the city, and in that way from first to last I was in the hands of pretty well all the English doctors in the place, but they did me no permanent good, nor did they say anything to give me a hope of complete recovery. Eventually we were told that it was a practically hopeless case, that I had [...] "outgrown my strength," [...] and had a permanently bad heart and might drop down at any moment.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{comprises}} five chapters {{that together}} offer some {{contribution to the}} economics of unemployment, earnings and absence. Chapter One: Unemployment Stigma investigates the implications of an occupational hierarchy on labour market behaviour. The ideas developed are applied, firstly, to {{a model of the}} wage curve where it is shown that the relationship between unemployment and pay may be upward <b>slopping</b> <b>over</b> some range; and secondly, to a non-shirking model of efficiency wages where the potential for multiple labour market equilibria is highlighted. Chapter Two: The Economics of Absence investigates the relatively neglected issue of worker absence. The Chapter reviews and offers some perspective to existing studies of absence, develops a theoretical model of absence that incorporates both the supply and demand aspects of the employment relation, and sets out an empirical analysis of the relationship between absence and labour supply. Chapter Three: Absence and Profit Sharing explores the relationship between employee sharing and worker absence using data from a panel of 127 French firms over the period 1981 - 1991. The results suggest that both profit sharing and employee share ownership schemes are associated with significantly lower absence, the extent of the decline depending crucially upon whether or not the schemes operate exclusively of one another. An interesting question also emerges concerning the relationship between contractual flexibility and absence behaviour, the empirical analysis suggesting that a more widespread use of part-time contracts may act to reduce the incidence of absence in firms operating profit sharing schemes. Chapter Four: U. K. Unemployment profiles the incidence of unemployment in the U. K. over the period 1985 - 91 by quantifying the differential probabilities of unemployment faced by particular groups within the population. The results indicate that, even after controlling for a plethora of demographic characteristics, regional disparities in unemployment risk are prevalent. Chapter Five: Trade and Trade Unions examines the effects of international trade on the employment and earnings prospects of a sample of U. K. workers. The Chapter develops a model of international oligopoly with generally unionised labour markets which suggests that an increased exposure to trade is more likely to impact negatively upon the wage (employment) prospects of workers the greater (lesser) the degree of union bargaining power to which they are subservient. The empirical analysis in the Chapter offers substantive support for this proposition...|$|E

His name was Harris. Philip discovered that on some days there were large soup-plates down the table full of mixed pickles. They were very popular. There were no knives and forks, but in a minute a large fat boy in a white coat came in with a couple of handfuls of them and threw them loudly on the middle of the table. Each man took what he wanted; they were warm and greasy from recent washing in dirty water. Plates of meat swimming in gravy were handed round by boys in white jackets, and as they flung each plate down with the quick gesture of a prestidigitator the gravy <b>slopped</b> <b>over</b> on to the table-cloth. Then they brought large dishes of cabbages and potatoes; the sight of them turned Philip's stomach; he noticed that everyone poured quantities of vinegar over them. The noise was awful.

He then started a win streak, defeating The Shard, Grizzly Redwood, Tim Donst, and Lancelot Bravado in singles matches. On September 14, The Stranger entered the 2012 King of Trios tournament, teaming with Osaka Pro Wrestling representative Mihara and Tito Santana. The trio was, however, defeated {{in their first}} round match by The Spectral Envoy (Frightmare, Hallowicked and UltraMantis Black), {{who went on to}} win the entire tournament. Prior to the match, The Stranger came face-to-face with Veronica, who had just managed the Throwbacks in their first round match and who, in storyline, was impressed with the southern gentleman yet unable to recognize the man under the mask. Following the tournament, Peck continued his singles match win streak over deviAnt and Walter Eaton. Following his win over Eaton, The Stranger made a veiled challenge towards Mark Angelosetti. The Stranger's win streak ended on November 10, when he was pinned by Angelosetti in a four tag team elimination match, during which Touchdown also killed his pet bird Sapphire. The following day, The Stranger was defeated by Angelosetti in a singles match via disqualification. On December 2 at Chikara's third internet pay-per-view, Under the Hood, The Mysterious and Handsome Stranger was crowned Chikara's homecoming king.

60|$|To {{run down}} the Thames so is to run one's hand over the pages {{in the book of}} England from end to end. One begins in Craven Reach and it is as if one were in the heart of old England. Behind us are Kew and Hampton Court with their {{memories}} of Kings and Cardinals, and one runs at first between Fulham's episcopal garden parties and Hurlingham's playground for the sporting instinct of our race.

What a long slow crescendo that is, mile after mile, with the houses crowding closelier, the multiplying succession of church towers, the architectural moments, the successive bridges, until you come out into the second movement of the piece with Lambeth's old palace under your quarter and the houses of Parliament on your bow! Westminster Bridge is ahead of you then, and through it you flash, and in a moment the round-faced clock tower cranes up to peer at you again and New Scotland Yard squares at you, a fat beef-eater of a policeman disguised miraculously as a Bastille.|$|R
50|$|The long {{procession}} of red sports cars suddenly turned into confusion, when Behra {{ran out of}} brakes and needed two stops to make adjustments, meanwhile Gendebienâ€™s Ferrari was leaking oil and stopped for a refill, letting Robert Manzon have a go. He did not go far before the engineâ€™s oil level dropped and stopped with a bang. Both Collins and Hill went off the road due to the resultant oil patch, while Portago was sideways {{on for a long}} while, during which Flockhart managed to avoid him by a small margin. Hill motored on through the corn field until he found {{his way back to the}} track, while Collins lost more time trying get back on the track, the same way he entered the field. This resulted in Fangio taking the lead, with Hill now in second, Portago third and Collins fourth. The leading Maserati was now in fifth with Harry Schell in the Villoresi car, and Behra struggling back in sixth. Flockhart retired with a blown engine when a rod broke, and Maserati decided to add Moss to the Villoresi/Schell car to try to improve on the fifth position. However, the pit stop did not go well, for fuel and oil was put in, while the rear wheels were changed. But everyone got in everyoneâ€™s way, fuel was <b>slopped</b> <b>over</b> the pit lane, one mechanic tripped over the jack, and amidst the pools of oil, petrol and water. Moss eventually got away. Then Behra decided he was tired of driving without brakes, came in for Villoresi to take over. With gallons of petrol all over the car and the ground, suddenly there was a boomph and the whole lot was on fire. The prompt action of the fire brigade, who were ever at the ready, the whole pits might have gone up in flames. After a few tense moments, the Maserati lay under a heavy covering of foam, as was most of the pit crew. The explosion split the fuel tank, as the Maserati was wheeled away into retirement.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{capacity}} {{of an existing}} spillway can be increased by lengthening the spillway crest, or increasing the discharge coefficient or operating head, or any combination of these approaches. Constructing a labyrinth weir in an existing spillway {{is an example of}} an effective way to increases the spillway crest length and the corresponding discharge capacity for the same operating head. Thus, labyrinth weir are well suited to the sites where increasing the spillway width and maximum reservoir water surface elevation would be difficult, yet larger discharge are needed. This type of weir consists of series of slender walls having a repeating shape in plan, usually triangular or trapezoidal with vertical upstream faces and steeply <b>slopping</b> downstream faces. <b>Over</b> the past few decades, labyrinth spillways have been constructed throughout the world. Definite guidelines and theoretical procedures pertaining to hydraulic design of this type of weir not completely established. There are many factors such as head to crest height ratio, vertical aspect ratio, side wall angle, apex width and approach and conveyance channel conditions that influence the {{capacity of}} weir and hence the hydraulic design of labyrinth weir. In this paper extensive physical modeling of the labyrinth spillway, primarily flume studies, has been performed, resulting in the development of Lux and Tullis methods are compared for a given labyrinth spillway. Further testing to define labyrinth hydraulic behaviour for this lower vertical aspect ratio (w/p) is recommended. Key words: Labyrinth weir Spillway Floods hydraulics structure Hydraulic...|$|R
5000|$|The mystery deepened when on 2 September 1914, the Mercury {{provided}} {{further details}} of the event in their article [...] "The Norfolk Bay Tragedy - A mysterious occurrence - The {{details of the}} event"THE NORFOLK BAY TRAGEDY. A MYSTERIOUS OCCURRENCE. THE DETAILS OF THE EVENT.Fuller details which have come to hand of the drowning tragedy in Norfolk Bay, by which Mr. C. Wellard lost his life, show that the whole affair is a mystery.On the night before Mr. Wellardâ€™s disappearance he stayed on the island with Mr. David Kingston, of Koonys. In the morning Mr. Wellard took several sheep out in his dinghy, {{and put them on}} board the s.s. Breone. He then went back to the island, and Mr Kingston helped him load the dinghy with six bags of fish manure, weighing some 7cwt ((approximately 317.5kg)), which, with a lamb in the bag and three dogs, formed the dinghyâ€™s freight. Mr. Wellard then put out from the island in his dinghy, intending to cross to King Georgeâ€™s Sound {{on the west side of}} Forestierâ€™s Peninsula and several miles from Garden Island, near which his home lay. The captain of the s.s. Breone offered to give him a tow for part of his journey, as the steamer would be going past the mouth of the Sound, and the dinghy was made fast to the steamer. As soon as the Breone got under way the captain noticed that the dinghy was <b>slopping</b> water <b>over</b> the bows. He then told Mr. Wellard he did not think the dinghy would stand towing, on which the latter asked him to cast off, which was at once done. The dinghy was then about 200 yards from the Garden Island jetty, but nor more than 60 or 70 yards from the nearest point on the island.When the dinghy was cast loose from the steamer, Mr. Wellard at once turned round and started to pull back to the jetty. Presumably he intended to get a bailer, as it was noticed that he had not one on board. The steamer rounded a point, and those on board lost sight of him before he reached the jetty.Mr. Wellard was never seen again, and what happened remains a mystery. He had no sail up at the time he was last seen. The dinghy is a stiff little boat, and it is hard to imagine how she got bottom upwards. The fact remains that she did turn over, and was found floating bottom upwards three days later. One of the dogs got on the bottom of the boat, and had been there three days and three nights before the boat was found.The deepest sympathy is felt for Mr. Wellardâ€™s family and relatives. He was a young man in the prime of life, with a wife and two young children. He had established a farm and orchard in the bush, near Murdunna, and was working hard with good prospects of success.On 4 September 1914, S. N. Wellard discussed his nephew's death in the Mercury in his letter entitled 'Norfolk Bay Tragedy'.:To the Editor of [...] "The Mercury". Sir, â€”Being the late Charles Wellard's uncle and owner of Garden Island, I would like to explain to the public how I think the sad accident occurred. After driving the sheep on the s. s. Breonce (I would like here to say there is a good jetty on Garden Island, and all stock is loaded from it) Mr. David Kingston helped me to load the dinghy with fish manure. The dinghy is 14 ft. long and about 5 ft. beam, and thoroughly sea-worthy. No doubt, after being towed a short distance by the vessel, he re-turned to the Island, bailed out and made another start with a full load. A north-east wind sprang up when he was crossing, a little <b>slop</b> was going <b>over</b> and wetting the manure making it very much heavier. Mr. Kingston said he put the load in the bow of the boat, a very unusual thing for him to do and he was sitting down on the well (which was corked up) pulling. No doubt when he saw danger he threw the bag off the well, it being easy to get at. This would most likely cause the boat to go down head foremost, and roll over. Mr Dalton, from the opposite shore saw a dinghy about noon three-parts of the way across to the mainland. When he returned to his work he could not see it, and he presumed it was someone fishing who had gone home. It was also seen by Mr Dodridge, of Dunalley, about the same time. A bailer was picked up with name on it and several other things on Chronicle Point [...] Yours, etc., S. N. WELLARD.|$|R
