25|$|In 1999, another {{life-threatening}} illness befell him. Because {{of months}} of incessant diarrhea, {{the signs of}} life were fading from the 94-year-old Mentor of Buddhism. Such pain and fatigue would be unbearable to any robust youth, let alone {{a man of his}} age. Yet never once did Yin Shun panic or complain. Whenever guests came to visit the venerable master, he summoned up his spirit to <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E
25|$|In Dogma, Metatron {{is portrayed}} by Alan Rickman, stating that he {{acts as the}} Voice of God in {{situations}} where people hear God <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> <b>them,</b> as humanity is psychologically and physically incapable of hearing God's actual voice without their heads exploding. In {{the course of the}} film, he recruits abortion clinic worker Bethany Sloan (Linda Fiorentino), who is revealed {{over the course of the}} film to be the last living relative of Jesus, to stop two angels from unwittingly negating existence while God is incapacitated after he is attacked and left in a coma while in a mortal form. During a later conversation with Bethany, the Metatron notes that Jesus had trouble adapting to the news that he was God's son and asked Metatron to take it back, with Metatron admitting to Bethany that he regretted placing so much responsibility on a child.|$|E

500|$|Shankly {{emphasised}} {{the importance}} of communication with the supporters. At Carlisle he used to <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> over the public address system before matches. Rather than just putting a few lines in the match programme, he preferred to speak and explain his team changes and his views about the previous match. At Workington, he would answer supporters' letters in person, using an old typewriter. But he said he preferred to phone business-people as he would put {{as little as possible}} in writing when dealing with them. He would readily obtain match tickets for fans whom he considered to be deserving cases and wrote in his autobiography that he [...] "would give people anything within reason".|$|E
500|$|The {{director}} {{was inspired by}} his own experiences: [...] "The germ for that comes from my own childhood memories of school-time friends. I have lived in boarding school {{for most of my}} childhood and the friends that I have today are the ones whom I got in touch with during 4th/5th standard. I may not <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> for years but they are a family whom I can call up at 4 am without hesitation." [...] Manuskhani soon realised that Bollywood had explored friendship, live–in relationships, marriage and divorce many times, and he wanted to do something different for his debut film. He decided to use sexuality to shed light on the issue, untouched by Bollywood, for the Indian audience.|$|E
500|$|The plots for Bedsitcom were {{devised by}} a team of writers (led by Rob Gibbons, Neil Gibbons and {{producer}} Matt Crook) located in a garage {{on the ground floor of}} the apartment building that the contestants were staying in. The writers would often appear on screen and explain to the TV audience what their intention for each episode was. They communicated with Ash, Gibbon and Jones either by ringing them on their mobile phones, or by calling them downstairs to <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> in person. They would occasionally change their plans for an episode—in [...] "Worst Case Scenario", for example, the writers altered their storyline from having Mel bring various animals into the flat to having the group kill Mel's goldfish after only one night.|$|E

500|$|The Protoss are humanoids, [...] {{with two}} {{luminous}} eyes, typically gold, green, or blue. With two fingers {{flanked by two}} opposable thumbs on each hand, two large toes on each foot (four small toes in earlier games), digitigrade legs, broad chests and shoulders with narrow waists, Protoss are very agile and physically strong. A bony crest extends back from the crown of the head, with long neural strands sprouting {{from the back of}} the head. These strands facilitate the basic psychic communal link all Protoss naturally share. Each Protoss has a different skin shade that corresponds to the tribe from which they are descended. The Protoss do not possess any visible ears (but they can hear, as when Terrans <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> or hear what they are thinking), mouths or noses, but are able to communicate telepathically and possess strong olfactory sensitivities. Protoss do not need to eat or drink, but are shown in The Dark Templar Saga to instead absorb energy from a form of photosynthesis. The average life expectancy for a Protoss is about one thousand years. Little is known of the internal anatomy of the Protoss.|$|E
500|$|The pro-Church accounts, by contrast, {{described}} a boy very much resolved {{to stay where}} he was, and horrified by his mother's exhortations {{to return to the}} Judaism of his ancestors. In this narrative, the main reason for the Mortaras' grief was not that their son had been taken, but that he now stood to grow up in the Christian faith. According to La Civiltà Cattolica, Marianna flew into a rage on seeing a medallion hanging from Edgardo's neck bearing the image of the Virgin Mary, and ripped it off; one article {{went so far as to}} claim the Jewish mother had done this with the words: [...] "I'd rather see you dead than a Christian!" [...] Some of the Church's critics had charged that by keeping Edgardo, it was violating the commandment that a child should honour his father and mother—La Civiltà Cattolica countered that Edgardo still loved his family despite their religious differences and indeed, after being taught by the priests to read and write, had chosen to write his first letter to his mother, signing it [...] "your most affectionate little son". Louis Veuillot, the ultramontane editor of the L'Univers newspaper and one of the Pope's staunchest defenders, reported after meeting Edgardo in Rome that the boy had told him [...] "that he loves his father and his mother, and that he will go to live with them when he is older... so that he can <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> of Saint Peter, of God, and of the most Holy Mary." ...|$|E
500|$|On October 18, 2016, an {{anonymous}} woman sued Michael Jackson's Estate, MJJ Productions and MJJ Ventures, alleging {{she had been}} sexually-abused by Jackson when she was 12-15, from 1986-1989 in Jackson's Encino home, hotels, the [...] "Smooth Criminal" [...] set, the [...] "Moonwalker" [...] movie set, {{in the back of}} his limousine, his Neverland Ranch, and an apartment/condo he nicknamed [...] "The Hideout". She provided letters, love notes allegedly written by Jackson, multiple gifts apparently given by Jackson, a jacket he supposedly gave to her after an Album photo-shoot, checks given to her from 1990-1993 totaling $920,000 sent from Michael Jackson, MJJ Ventures, and MJJ Productions—coming directly from Jackson's back-accounts, and a 1993 Santa Barbara PD letter alleging that the Police Department concluded she [...] "knew all about Child Abuse" [...] to come in and <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> <b>them,</b> regarding their investigation. Her complaint alleges that she never considered her emotional/psychological injuries to be a result of her sexual activities with Jackson until she reflected on those experiences for the first time in September 2016, and that even if she had wanted to she could not possibly come forward earlier because she was threatened with physical harm if she ever told anyone, told that she would get in trouble with law enforcement and go to jail if she did, and that Jackson made her promise not to tell anyone. A lawyer for the Businesses dismissed the allegations saying, [...] "This is yet another attempt to hit the lottery by suing the estate of Michael Jackson more than seven years after Michael's death and close to 30 years after these incidents supposedly occurred. We believe this claim was created from whole cloth and is without any merit. It's also no coincidence that this woman is represented by the same attorneys involved in two other frivolous claims against the estate." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} {{directed}} by Charles McDougall, his first credit for the series. According to Kinsey, McDougal, in order to set the characters' moods, would start every scene by saying [...] "everyone happy, Angela pissed!" [...] McDougal sought to bring movement to the Secret Santa scene, due to it being a largely stationary sequence. The cold opening was shot four different times, and almost every time, the ceiling tile that Michael displaces with a tree [...] "crashed through the ceiling and almost killed Steve Carell". The scene wherein Angela starts crying when the Christmas party descends into chaos {{was based on a}} deleted scene from the earlier season two episode [...] "The Fire", where Angela starts crying during a talking head due to the stress of the situation. The scenes featuring snow were created by a company that specialized in producing fake snow. Daniels was initially worried that the shots would look fake, but he was pleased with the final results. According to Fischer, {{on the last day of}} shooting, the cast had a snowball fight—a scene that is included in the episode—which she called a [...] "magic moment". Fischer later recounted that the prop egg nog and pigs in a blanket were kept out for three straight days, an act that she felt was revolting. In order to make her scenes more real Phyllis Smith forced herself to cry for [...] "30 minutes" [...] between takes. Many of the cast members asked her what was wrong, but Smith refused to <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> <b>them,</b> in order to stay in character. The series' writers researched local Pennsylvania laws and discovered one that states a liquor salesman must wear a tie. Thus, the show features a liquor store worker wearing a tie. Several of the scenes were improvised on the spot. During the sequence where Angela angrily throws Christmas bulbs at a wall, Angela Kinsey was unable to get them to break, so she decided to stomp on them. Kate Flannery improvised her line about not drinking only during the week while she was filming her talking head.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the seventh}} reading ( [...] , aliyah), seeing the thunder, lightning, and the {{mountain}} smoking, the people fell back and asked Moses to <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> instead of God.

And God prohibited ascending the altar by steps, {{so as not to}} exposed the priests' nakedness.|$|E

2500|$|Tsuchiya {{has also}} confessed that when drunk, she often picked on [...] "fatter" [...] models herself, {{especially}} foreigners {{who came to}} work for fashion magazines such as Elle, Vogue, SPUR and Pre Numéro, publications she considered sub-stream. These models, unable to understand Japanese, were oblivious to Tsuchiya's abuse and always just smiled back to whatever what she said. Tsuchiya would also often <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> in English using offensive words related to obesity, as many models in their teens do, and would often further assault them when they reacted negatively to her verbal abuse.|$|E
2500|$|A pro-independence {{conspiracy}} {{was discovered}} in Vallodalid (Morelia, Michoacán). This was headed by Lieutenant José Mariano Michelena and Father Vicente de Santa María. They were arrested, and Lizana ordered them brought to Mexico City {{so that he could}} <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> <b>them.</b> The conspirators proposed to the viceroy (as related by Michelena) to form a junta to govern New Spain in the name of King Ferdinand VII and to take all possible measures to extend the reign of this [...] "august" [...] sovereign.

2500|$|Playing {{in front}} of small audiences, during early shows the Mary Chain {{performed}} very short gigs, typically fuelled by amphetamines and lasting around 20 minutes, and played with {{their backs to the}} audience, refusing to <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> <b>them.</b> In late December 1984, the band performed as part of the ICA Rock Week. During their performance, bottles were thrown on stage, with press reports exaggerating events and claiming {{that there had been a}} riot, and national newspaper The Sun running a story on the band concentrating on violence and drugs, the band attracting the tag [...] "The new Sex Pistols". This led several local councils to ban the band from performing in their area.|$|E
