We show {{that the impact of}} financial variables depends strongly on the labour market context. Increased market capitalization as well as decreased banking concentration reduce unemployment if the level of labour market regulation, union density and coordination in wage bargaining is low. The above financial variables have no effect otherwise. Increasing intermediated credit and banking concentration is beneficial for employment when the degree of labour market regulation, union density and coordination in wage bargaining is high. These results suggest that the respective virtues of ed and market-based finance are crucially tied to the labour market context. unemployment, institutional complementarities and <b>substituabilities,</b> labour market, financial system...|$|R

In this set-up, we show that the investment rate is a fundamental determinant of the profitability of R&D. We characterize the balanced growth paths. We show that, although the model can generate multiple equilibria due {{to the presence of}} strategic complementarities, the unique stable equilibrium is indeed dominated by strategic <b>substituabilities.</b> At this equilibrium, the higher is the investment rate, the more resources are devoted to R&D, the faster the economy grows, the lower is the average age of capital and the higher is the rate of decline of the relative price of capital.

40|$|ABSTRACT: We {{consider}} a supply channel composed of one manufacturer and two symmetric retailers. Three cases are studied. The non-cooperation {{case is a}} leader-follower relationship. The manufacturer determines his spending in national advertising and the wholesale price. Then, retailers determine non-cooperatively the price for consumers. In the partial-cooperation case, retailers decide jointly for the price. In the full-cooperation case, {{all members of the}} channel cooperate by maximizing a joint profit function. Interestingly, partial-cooperation reduces the profits of retailers with respect to non-cooperation, when the degree of <b>substituability</b> between the two products proposed by retailers is low. Because of symmetry, this also implies that the total profit of retailers may decrease with partial-cooperation. Thus, when the degree of <b>substituability</b> between products is low, it {{is in the interest of}} retailers to set their prices non-cooperatively. We propose a cooperative implementable contract between all channel members, which shares the extra-profit due to full-cooperation. We propose a new and unusual evaluation of consumers ’ surplus which positively depends not only on the price-demand function but also on the spending in national advertising. Partial-cooperation is always the worst case for the manufacturer, the whole channel, consumers ’ surplus and social welfare, while full-cooperation is the best case...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} strategic fiscal policy-making {{within the}} context of the standard two-country-two-good real trade model developped by Turnovsky (1988). Introducing asymmetry between the two countries and assuming that one country acts as a Stackelberg leader relative to the other one, we compare the welfare issued from the Nash equilibrium and the welfare for each country issued from the Stackelberg equilibrium. It happens that both countries benefit from Stackelberg equilibrium with respect to the non cooperative equilibrium in the presence of strategic complementarity, because both governments reduce their public spendings. In this model, strategic interactions depend on the relative value of elasticities of substitution between goods. There may either exist strategic <b>substituability</b> or complementarity. ...|$|E
40|$|One reason {{cited for}} the limited effect of {{financial}} incentives on physician behaviour {{is the assumption}} of <b>substituability</b> of motivations. Extrinsic motivations crowd out intrinsic motivation (IM). We seek to highlight the theorical conditions for this "crowding out effect" (COE).

The latter is then likely to interpret the incentive as a bad news on his capabilities to succed the task or as a negative signal source of loss of social prestige.

Aghion, Bacchetta and Banerjee (1999, 2000, 2001) show that a restrictive monetary policy is optimal if economy is strongly in debt in foreign currency and if the effect of credit channel is weak. However, this result is obtained with an assumption of perfect <b>substituability</b> of assets - the risk premium is equal to zero. The introduction of a risk premium in the theoretical model can be justified with an econometric approach for Thailand {{and to a lesser extent}} for South Korea. The efficiency of the monetary policy during a currency crisis is reduced when the risk premium plays an important part in the determination of the interest rate differential. Under these conditions, capital controls could be a more adequate policy to manage a currency crisis. Monetary policy; currency crisis; risk premium. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: When using a {{component}} framework developers need {{to respect the}} behavior implemented by the components. Static information about the component interface is not sufficient. Dynamic information such as the description of valid sequences of operations is required. Instead of being in some external documentation, this information should be formally represented and embedded within the components themselves, {{so that it can}} be used by automatic tools. We propose a mathematical model and a formal language to describe the knowledge about behavior. We rely on a hierarchical model of deterministic finite state-machines. The communication between the machines follows the Synchronous Paradigm. We favor a structural approach allowing incremental simulation, automatic verification, code generation, and run-time checks. Associated tools may ensure correct and safe reuse of the components. We focus on extension of components through inheritance (in the sense of sub-typing), owing to the notion of behavioral refinement.

We find that, for religious parents, the higher is the fraction of religious peers, the more parents put effort in transmitting their religiosity, indicating cultural complementarity. For non-religious parents, we obtain the reverse, indicating cultural <b>substituability.</b> Concerning the success in transmitting the religious trait, we find that, for religious parents, the fraction of religious peers has only an indirect effect (through parental effort) while, for non-religious parents, there is a lower indirect effect and a statistically significant and sizeable direct effect of peers on the {{transmission of the}} non-religious trait. cultural transmission; network fixed effects.; peer effects; Religion...|$|E
40|$|The {{standard}} asset pricing models (the CCAPM and the Epstein-Zin non-expected utility model) counterintuitively {{predict that}} equilibrium asset prices can rise if the representative agent's risk aversion increases. If the income effect, which implies enhanced saving {{as a result}} of an increase in risk aversion, dominates the substitution effect, which causes the representative agent to reallocate his portfolio in favour of riskless assets, the demand for securities increases. Thus, asset prices are forced to rise when the representative agent is more risk adverse. By disentangling risk aversion and intertemporal <b>substituability,</b> we demonstrate that the risky asset price is an increasing function of the coefficient of risk aversion only if the elasticity of intertemporal substitution (EIS) exceeds unity. This result, which was first proved par Epstein (1988) in a stationary economy setting with a constant risk aversion, is shown to hold true for non-stationary economies with a variable or constant risk aversion coefficient. The conclusion is that the EIS probably exceeds unity...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to generalize the {{endogenous}} timing game proposed by Hamilton and Slutsky (1990) to cases where the reaction functions are non-motononic, as for instance in the literature on contest.

Under the assumptions of the existence and the uniqueness of the Nash and Stackelberg equilibria, we highlight the presence of a ﬁrst-mover advantage or a second-mover incentive only depending on the nature of cross-eﬀects in players' payoﬀ functions and the slopes of their reaction functions at the Nash equilibrium of the static game. These properties allow us to determine rigorously the Subgame Perfect Nash Equilibrium (SPNE) in the ten studied situations.

40|$|This paper studies {{competition}} under dynamic {{price and}} quantity postponement where product <b>substituability</b> is included. Supplier who operates as market leader and two retailers who act as follower produce two differentiated products {{according to the}} same product family. Price postponement is taken into consideration from a motivation to anticipate product variety while quantity postponement to anticipate demand changing. Furthermore their effectiveness to different substitutability degrees is benchmarked according to Bertrand and Cournot Stackelberg game. System dynamic is applied {{in order to show}} how different dynamic game strategies effect to profit and product life cycle at several product substitutability degrees. The simulation results are used to answer two research questions (1) how does product substitution degree affects the different game strategy?

It is shown that Cournot game is superior to highly differentiated product with short product life cycle while Bertrand game for product that shares common platform and longer product life cycle. Moreover the results show that Bertrand game gives stability effect rather than Cournot game.

40|$|I {{focus on}} three {{features}} of international markets: first, people mainly consume home produced goods (the “home bias in consumption puzzle”). Second, they hold {{a disproportionate share}} of domestic assets (the “home bias in portfolio puzzle”). Third, countries that are more open to trade are also more financially open. Following Obstfeld and Rogoff [2000], I ask whether one can replicate these three broad facts by simply adding trade costs in a two-country stochastic equilibrium model. Since trade costs generate deviations from “purchasing power parity ” i. e real exchange rate fluctuations, equilibrium portfolios deviate from the market portfolio but not systematically in favor of domestic equities. The direction of the bias in equity portfolios depends crucially on the risk aversion of consumers, on the <b>substituability</b> between domestic and foreign goods and on the size of trade costs. Under reasonable parameters values, trade costs actually worsen the “home bias in portfolio puzzle”. To reconcile facts and theory, I propose a combination of small frictions between financial markets and large trade costs on goods market. Obviously frictions in financial markets lead to “home bias in portfolio ” {{but it is not the}} whole story. The interaction between both types of frictions also matters: reducing trade costs increases competition in goods market, which increases the volatility of domestic incomes. Facing higher risks, people want more diversified portfolios and increase their holdings of foreign assets for a given level of frictions in financial markets...|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{this paper}} is to analyze the {{determination}} of countries equity portfolios and countries stock returns behavior in the context of imperfectly integrated financial markets. We build a continuous-time equilibrium model of a two-country endowment economy in which the level of financial integration is simply captured by with holding taxes on foreign dividends. Despite the heterogeneity among investors induced by these taxes, we obtain approximate closed-form expressions for asset prices and we characterize equity holdings and national assets returns behavior in equilibrium. The existence of a friction akin to a with holding tax on foreign dividends has two opposite effects on portfolios: the first mechanical effect is to reduce foreign holdings by reducing expected returns on foreign assets; but there is a second effect, which is to reduce endogenously the correlation between national asset returns, thus increasing the willingness to diversify internationally. Quantitatively, we show that the direct effect dwarfs the indirect effect and we find that, for a reasonably high level of <b>substituability</b> between national assets, small frictions on equity markets can generate a large home bias in portfolios. Empirically, our model is consistent with a broad range of findings on international financial integration. Moreover, we provide an explanation for the puzzling positive relationship that has been found in the data between bilateral equity holdings and bilateral stock returns correlations.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{conceptual}} framework to investigate the effects of central bank independence, {{of the degree of}} centralization of wage bargaining and of the interaction between those institutional variables, on real wages, unemployment and inflation. The labour market is characterized by the degree of centralization of bargaining and by the degree of trade unions’ inflation aversion. The latter leads each union to moderate its wage demands in order to induce the Central Bank (CB) to inflate at a lower rate. An increase in the degree of centralization of wage bargaining (a {{decrease in the number of}} unions) triggers two opposite effects on real wages, unemployment and inflation. The decrease in the number of unions reduces the <b>substituability</b> between the labours of different unions and therefore the degree of effective competition between them. This ‘reduced competition effect’ raises real wages, unemployment and inflation. But the decrease in the number of unions also strengthens the moderating effect of inflationary fears on the real wage demands of each union. This ‘strategic effect’ lowers real wages, unemployment and inflation. The interaction between those two effects produces a Calmfors-Driffill type relation between real wages and centralization. The paper analyses the effects of centralization and of independence on the position and the shape of this Calmfors-Driffill relation, as well as on inflation and unemployment. Some of the resulting implications are tested empirically, using data from 19 developed economies. Implications for the optimal degree of conservativeness and for European Monetary Union (EMU) are also discussed. centralization of bargaining; Credibility; industrial organization of labour markets; Inflation; monetary policy institutions; Unemployment...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} effects of returns to scale, {{technological}} learning, i. e. learning-by-doing and learning-by-searching, and uranium price on the prospects of nuclear cost decrease. We use an extended learning curve specification, named multiple factors learning curve (MFLC). In a first stage, we estimate a single MFLC. In a second stage, we estimate the MFLC under the framework of simultaneous system of equations which {{takes into account the}} uranium supply and demand. This permits not only to enhance the reliability of the estimation by incorporating the uranium price formation mechanisms in the MFLC via the price variable, but also to give preliminary insights about uranium supply and demand behaviors and the associated effects on the nuclear expansion. Results point out that the nuclear cost has important prospects for decrease via capacity expansion, i. e. learning-by-doing effects. In contrast, they show that the learning-by-searching as well as the scale effects have a limited effect on the cost decrease prospects. Conversely, results also show that uranium price exerts a positive and significant effect on nuclear cost, implying that when the uranium price increases, the nuclear power generation cost decreases. Since uranium is characterized by important physical availability, and since it represents only a minor part in the total nuclear cost, we consider that in a context of increasing demand for nuclear energy the latter result {{can be explained by the}} fact that the positive learning effects on the cost of nuclear act in a way to dissipate the negative ones that an increase in uranium price may exert. Further, results give evidence of important inertia in the supply and demand sides as well as evidence of slow correlation between the uranium market and oil market which may limit the inter-fuels <b>substituability</b> effects, that is, nuclear capacity expansion and associated learning-by-doing benefits.
