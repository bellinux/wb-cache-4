2500|$|Experimental work {{by several}} groups {{revealed}} the basic mechanisms of CRISPR-Cas immunity. [...] In 2007 the first experimental evidence that CRISPR was an {{adaptive immune system}} was published. [...] A CRISPR region in Streptococcus thermophilus acquired spacers from the DNA of an infecting bacteriophage. The researchers manipulated the resistance of S. thermophilus to phage by adding and deleting spacers whose sequence matched {{those found in the}} tested phages. [...] In 2008, Brouns and colleagues identified a complex of Cas protein that in E. coli cut the CRISPR RNA within the repeats into spacer-containing RNA molecules, which remained bound to the protein complex. That year Marraffini and Sontheimer showed that a CRISPR sequence of <b>S.</b> <b>epidermidis</b> targeted DNA and not RNA to prevent conjugation. [...] This finding was at odds with the proposed RNA-interference-like mechanism of CRISPR-Cas immunity, although a CRISPR-Cas system that targets foreign RNA was later found in Pyrococcus furiosus. [...] A 2010 study showed that CRISPR-Cas cuts both strands of phage and plasmid DNA in S. thermophilus.|$|E

40|$|Rationale : A  {{significant}} proportion of post-operative infectious complications in cardiovascular surgery is caused by Staphylococcus spp, with an increasing role of Staphylococcus epidermidis. Aim: To identify biological characteristics of coagulase-negative staphylococci isolated from various biotopes in a cardiac surgery department, {{in order to assess}} their pathogenic potential. Materials and methods: The study was performed with Staphylococcus isolates (n= 73) obtained in a cardiac surgery department in 2015 – 2016. Biochemical identification of the cultures was done with the use of Vitek 2   compact microbiological analyzer (BioMerieux, France) and test systems Staphytest (ERBA Lachema, Czech Republic). The biological properties of staphylococci were assessed by classical microbiological techniques. Statistical analysis was done with the Microbe- 2   software package. Results : S.  aureus and 6  strains of coagulase-negative staphylococci with predominance of <b>S.</b>   <b>epidermidis</b> were isolated in the department of cardiac surgery. In most cases <b>S.</b>   <b>epidermidis</b> was isolated from post-operative wounds (n= 16, 30. 8 ± 6. 4 %) and environmental swabs (n= 11, 21. 1 ± 5. 7 %). All <b>S.</b>   <b>epidermidis</b> studied (n= 52) hydrolyzed maltose with formation of the acid without gas, could ferment glucose and tregalose, and were lacking β-galactosidase (except the cultures isolated from post-operative wounds). They also could not degrade mannitol in aerobic environment (excluding staphylococci isolated from the environmental objects and from the medical staff). <b>S.</b>   <b>epidermidis</b> displayed variable biochemical activity towards lactose and saccharose. Hemolytic activity (more often of the β-type) was characteristic for 69. 2 ± 6. 4 %  of <b>S.</b>   <b>epidermidis</b> cultures. The majority of cultures (92. 4 ± 3. 6 %) displayed proteolytic activity irrespective of the type of staphylococci and the source of isolation. Lipolytic activity was more frequent in staphylococci isolated from clinical materials (airway secretions of the medical personnel [9 / 10   cultures], patients [9 / 10   cultures] and post-operative wounds [16 / 20  cultures]), than in those isolated from the environmental objects. There was a direct significant correlation between the lipase activity and the presence of β-galactosidase (φ= 0. 40), lipase and proteolytic activities (φ= 0. 33), β-galactosidase and gelatin liquation (φ= 0, 65), hemolytic and proteolytic activities (φ= 0. 37). Conclusion : S.  epidermidis was the most prevalent pathogen in all ecotopes of the department of cardiac surgery. Biochemical properties of coagulase-negative staphylococci and their fermentative activity related to factors of pathogenicity were different depending on the site of isolation. This illustrates their contribution in the development of inflammation in a given biotope. </p...|$|R

40|$|Lysozyme {{production}} {{is a frequent}} property of potentially pathogenic staphylococci. In the present study, 1, 186 strains of human origin, 85 strains of animal origin, and 156 strains of Staphylococcus albus (epidermidis) were tested. Of 1, 114 coagulase-positive strains of human and animal origin, 1, 098 were lysozyme-positive (98. 5 %).

All of the 156 strains (100 %) belonging to the species <b>S.</b> albus (<b>epidermidis)</b> were lysozyme-negative. We conclude that lysozyme {{production is}} a better index of potentially pathogenic staphylococci than the measurement of free coagulase, especially in cases of strains of animal origin.

40|$|Polyvalent bacteriophages of {{the genus}} Twort-like that infect {{clinically}} relevant Staphylococcus strains may {{be among the most}} promising phages with potential therapeutic applications. They are obligatorily lytic, infect the majority of Staphylococcus strains in clinical strain collections, propagate efficiently and do not transfer foreign DNA by transduction. Comparative genomic analysis of 11 <b>S.</b> aureus/S. <b>epidermidis</b> Twort-like phages, as presented in this chapter, emphasizes their strikingly high similarity and clear divergence from phage Twort of the same genus, which might have evolved in hosts of a different species group. Genetically, these phages form a relatively isolated group, which minimizes the risk of acquiring potentially harmful genes. The order of genes in core parts of their 127 to 140 -kb genomes is conserved and resembles that found in related representatives of the Spounavirinae subfamily of myoviruses. Functions of certain conserved genes can be predicted based on their homology to prototypical genes of model spounavirus SPO 1. Deletions in the genomes of certain phages mark genes that are dispensable for phage development. Nearly half of the genes of these phages have no known homologues. Unique genes are mostly located near termini of the virion DNA molecule and are expressed early in phage development as implied by analysis of their potential transcriptional signals. Thus, many of them are likely {{to play a role in}} host takeover. Single genes encode homologues of bacterial virulence-associated proteins. They were apparently acquired by a common ancestor of these phages by horizontal gene transfer but presumably evolved towards gaining functions that increase phage infectivity for bacteria or facilitate mature phage release. Major differences between the genomes of <b>S.</b> aureus/S. <b>epidermidis</b> Twort-like phages consist of single nucleotide polymorphisms and insertions/deletions of short stretches of nucleotides, single genes, or introns of group I.

Two different PRP preparations - a single spin process yielding lower white blood cells and platelet concentration (PRPLP) and one yielding high platelet and white blood cell concentration (PRPHP) - were obtained from 2 individuals. PRPLP, PRPHP, phosphate buffered saline (PBS), whole blood and Cefazolin were added to experimental reaction tubes, each containing a single bacterial inoculum of Staphylococcus aureus (<b>S.</b> aureus), Staphylococcus <b>epidermidis</b> (<b>S.</b> epi), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) or Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes). Two dilutions (1 : 1, 000, and 1 : 10, 000) were plated in duplicate tubes, along with positive (blood and PBS) and negative (Cefazolin) controls and assessed at five time points (0, 1, 4, 8 and 24 hours).

All the experiments were carried out on PUs films obtained by solvent casting. The wettability of these films was analysed by measuring static contact angles against water. The ability of the selected PUs to adsorb human fibronectin (Fn) and fibrinogen (Fbg) was checked by ELISA with biotin-labelled proteins. All PUs were able to adsorb Fn and Fbg (Fn>Fbg).

40|$|AIM: To compare {{bacterial}} biofilm colonization in lacrimal stents following external dacryocystorhinostomy (EX-DCR), endoscopic dacryocystorhinostomy (EN-DCR), and transcanalicular dacryocystorhinostomy (TC-DCR) with multidiode laser. METHODS: This {{prospective study}} included 30 consecutive patients with nasolacrimal duct obstruction who underwent EXT-, EN-, or TC-DCR. Thirty removed lacrimal stent fragments and conjunctival samples were cultured. The lacrimal stent biofilms were examined by {{scanning electron microscopy}} (SEM). RESULTS: Eleven (36. 7 %) of the 30 lacrimal stent cultures were positive for aerobic bacteria (most commonly <b>S</b> taphylococcus <b>epidermidis</b> and P seudomonas aeruginosa). However anaerobic bacteria and fungi were not identified in the lacrimal stent cultures. Twenty-seven (90 %) patients had biofilm-positive lacrimal stents. The conjunctival culture positivity after the DCR, biofilm positivity on stents, the grade of biofilm colonization, {{and the presence of}} mucus and coccoid and rod-shaped organisms did not significantly differ between any of the groups (P ＞ 0. 05). However, a significant difference was found when the SEM results were compared to the results of the lacrimal stent and conjunctival cultures (P ＜ 0. 001). CONCLUSION: Type of dacryocystorhinostomy (DCR) surgery did not affect the biofilm colonization of the lacrimal stents.
