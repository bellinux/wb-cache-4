40|$|The {{container}} ship stowage planning problem {{was introduced to}} the research group by the container transport company Euroports. The goal of this so called Master Bay Plan Problem (MBPP) is to minimize the total stowage time to transport a given set of cargo. Although the MBPP is a general definition of the problem, it differs in two aspects. First, the MBPP takes into account an individual loading time for each container and aims to minimize the total loading time. Second, containers are located into fixed slots in the cargo space. Our approach aims to minimize the total container operations or shifts consisting of unloading and reloading operations caused by blocking containers. In the first stage an alternative model is developed: the <b>Sliced</b> <b>Bar</b> Packing Model (SBPM). Bars represent containers from the pick up till the destination terminal. These bars can be cut into multiple parts and are packed in a given space, while the total number of cuts should be minimized. In the second stage, a heuristic solves stowage problems represented by the SBPM. The performance of the SBPM heuristic is compared to the Suspensory Heuristic (SH) introduced by Avriel et al. Results show that the SBPM outperforms the SH. In addition, while the SH is limited to a homogeneous set of containers and cannot take into account stability constraints, the SBPM accommodates these needs. status: publishe...|$|R

50|$|On March 14, 2015, an {{outbreak}} of listeriosis in Kansas was linked to certain Blue Bell Ice Cream products (Blue Bell Chocolate Chip Country Cookies, Great Divide Bars, Sour Pop Green Apple Bars, Cotton Candy Bars, Scoops, Vanilla Stick <b>Slices,</b> Almond <b>Bars,</b> and No Sugar Added Moo Bars). Blue Bell, the nation's third most popular ice cream brand, says its regular Moo Bars were untainted, as were its ice cream varieties in three-gallon, half-gallon, quart, pint and single-serving containers and its take-home frozen snack novelties. It was the first outbreak of a foodborne illness in the company's history. The items came from the company's production facility located in Broken Arrow, Oklahoma, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), in Washington, D.C. The Atlanta-based U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), also {{a branch of the}} U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), stated that all five of the sickened individuals, including the three who have died (60% mortality rate) were receiving treatment at the same Kansas hospital before developing the listeriosis, suggesting their infections with the Listeria bacteria were nosocomial (acquired, while eating the products, in the hospital). That might also help to explain the higher mortality rate in these cases (60%, versus the more normal 20%-30%): the people, who were all older (three of the five were women) were already hospitalized.|$|R
5000|$|A commercially {{acquired}} [...] "melt and pour" [...] soap base {{is melted}} {{in a pan}} or commercial melting vessel, using direct heat, or in a water jacket melting pot, (large double boiler or [...] "bain marie"), and re-solidifies as it cools. Domestically, a microwave oven {{can be used for}} melting small quantities of the base. Additions can be added at the still-hot liquid stage, such as fragrance, fragrant essential oils, moisturizing agents, colorants, or exfoliating agents, e.g. poppy seeds, coffee grounds or pumice, along with coloured micas, metallic glitter, honey and flower heads. The liquified concoction can be poured into individual molds, tray molds, or blocks. Molds are made of metal or, more commonly, from reinforced silicone rubber, allowing artisans to make their own molds using a two-part mold kit. Upon cooling, the soap can be removed from the molds as individual soaps, or as blocks for <b>slicing</b> into <b>bars.</b> Layers of different colors, or transparent layers, can be built up, or pre-cast embeddable soap shapes, called embeds, can be set into the soap during moulding to produce novel patterns. Melt and pour bases can be transparent or opaque, and are sometimes enriched with products like goat's milk or shea butter to add value. The small-scale process lends itself to bespoke manufacture; a single soap bar can be individually manufactured if desired.|$|R
40|$|Mango is higly {{perishable}} {{and must}} be consumed {{within a few days}} after harvesting. Preserving mango into dry product can extend shelf life and increase added value. The research aimed to investigate the processing technology of dried candied mango by analysing the drying rate and quality of the product in various drying temperature and slice forms the mango. Mangos of Kopek cv. were <b>sliced</b> into cubes, <b>bar,</b> and flat then dried at 45 °C and 50 °C. Responses which observed were drying rate, water content, water activity value (aw), yield, and organoleptic. The results showed that the drying rate fluctuates due to the influence of the opening of the drying rack and the heating element. Shortest drying time is obtained in the form of slices drying box at 50 °C with a yield of 52. 45 % and the value of aw 0. 59. Organoleptic response indicates that the wedge shape and drying temperature does not affect the assessment of panel...|$|R

He slips on the ladder, grabs on an electric cord and slides down into an electricity box and gets zapped. A tower from Mr. Burns' mansion breaks in half, damaging a mausoleum, which opens up four caskets which in turn reveal three skeletons which all resemble Mr. Burns, dressed in various costumes.Later, we see the Simpsons dressed up in costumes, with Homer as Fred Flintstone, Marge as Wilma Flintstone, Lisa and Maggie as conjoined twins, and Bart as a hobo walking up to the mansion (with Bart and Lisa complaining that Flanders gave them toothpaste instead of candy). The family sees the building and caskets on fire, and screams in terror. They run out the gate, which as it closes, has its <b>bars</b> <b>slice</b> the family.

40|$|There {{are several}} ways to characterise the {{hydrothermally}} degraded layer in metastable tetragonal zirconia ceramics: X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The aim {{of this study is to}} compare different surface characterization methods to get a more profound understanding of the degradation process taking place in dental zirconia ceramics after exposure to a humid environment. Fully-sintered IPS e. max ZirCAD (Ivoclar-Vivadent) blocks were <b>sliced</b> into rectangular <b>bars</b> with an approximate volume of 15 x 5 x 3 mm 3. Both the top and bottom surface of the specimen were mirror polished and analyzed by a θ- 2 θ XRD (Seifert 3003 TT, Seifert) in order to confirm that no monoclinic phase (m-phase) was present in the as-sintered ceramic. The low-temperature degradation test was performed at 134 °C for 4 hours under 2 bar within a custom-made autoclave. θ- 2 θ XRD was applied to both the top and bottom surface of the degraded sample. The diffraction patterns were compared with those recorded using a grazing incident XRD. Fracture surfaces of the degraded samples were analysed by micro-Raman spectroscopy (XploRA, Horiba). Finally, a micro-structural analysis was performed using SEM. Before hydrothermal treatment, no m-phase could be detected. After degradation, θ- 2 θ XRD revealed the presence of approximately 22 % m-phase within 8 μm of the sample. Grazing incident XRD showed that over 60 % m-phase was present down to a depth of 2 μm below the sample surface, while the proportion m-phase significantly decreased from 3 μm below the surface. Micro-Raman analysis indicated that the m-phase content decreased quite rapidly below the degraded sample surface, and even 2 µm below the surface was nearly absent. SEM disclosed that the thickness of the degraded layer varied significantly over the sample surfaces. It can be concluded that the three methodologies tested allow to quantify and characterise the hydrothermally degraded zones in dental zirconia ceramics. status: publishe...|$|R
