40|$|The {{current study}} {{analyzes}} {{the effects of}} the <b>scaling</b> <b>parameters</b> of the batch unscented transformation on precision satellite orbit determination. Satellite laser ranging (SLR) data are used in the orbit determination algorithm, which consists of dynamics model, observation model and filtering algorithm composed of the batch unscented transformation. TOPEX/Poseidon SLR data are used by utilizing the normal point (NP) data observed from ground station. The filtering algorithm includes a repeated series of processes to determine the appropriate <b>scaling</b> <b>parameters</b> for the batch unscented transformation. To determine appropriate <b>scaling</b> <b>parameters,</b> general ranges of the <b>scaling</b> <b>parameters</b> of α, β, κ, λ are established. Depending on the range settings, each parameter was assigned to the filtering algorithm at regular intervals. Appropriate <b>scaling</b> <b>parameters</b> are determined for observation data obtained from several observatories, by analyzing the relationship between tuning properties of the <b>scaling</b> <b>parameters</b> and estimated orbit precision. The orbit determination of satellite using the batch unscented transformation can achieve levels of accuracy within several tens of cm with the appropriate <b>scaling</b> <b>parameters.</b> The analyses in the present study give insights into the roles of <b>scaling</b> <b>parameters</b> in the batch unscented transformation method...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn {{this work}} we study the Plancherel–Rotach type asymptotics for Stieltjes–Wigert, q-Laguerre and Ismail–Masson {{orthogonal}} polynomials with complex scalings. The main {{terms of the}} asymptotics for Stieltjes–Wigert and q-Laguerre polynomials (Ismail–Masson polynomials) contain Ramanujan function Aq(z) for <b>scaling</b> <b>parameters</b> above the vertical line R(s) = 2 (R(w) = 12); the main terms of the asymptotics involve theta function for <b>scaling</b> <b>parameters</b> in the vertical strip 0 <R(s) < 2 (0 <R(w) < 12). When <b>scaling</b> <b>parameters</b> in the vertical strips, the number theoretical properties of <b>scaling</b> <b>parameters</b> completely determine the orders of the error terms. These asymptotic formulas may provide some insights to new random matrix models and also add a new link between special functions and number theory...|$|R

25|$|Note {{that some}} of these (such as median, or mid-range) are {{measures}} of central tendency, and are used as estimators for a location parameter, such as the mean of a normal distribution, while others (such as range or trimmed range) are measures of statistical dispersion, and are used as estimators of a <b>scale</b> <b>parameter,</b> such as the standard deviation of a normal distribution.|$|E
25|$|A Bayesian account can {{be found}} in Gelman et al. The degrees of freedom {{parameter}} controls the kurtosis of the distribution and is correlated with the <b>scale</b> <b>parameter.</b> The likelihood can have multiple local maxima and, as such, it is often necessary to fix the degrees of freedom at a fairly low value and estimate the other parameters taking this as given. Some authors report that values between 3 and 9 are often good choices. Venables and Ripley suggest that a value of 5 is often a good choice.|$|E
40|$|An {{experimentally}} accessible {{definition for}} the inner {{region of the}} wall-bounded turbulent boundary layer is proposed. This proposed integral area description method is then extended to consider velocity profile similarity issues for the inner region of turbulent flows. It is shown that a necessary (but not sufficient) requirement for similarity is that {{the ratio of the}} velocity <b>scaling</b> <b>parameter</b> to the length <b>scaling</b> <b>parameter</b> must be proportional to the wall shear stress. Three different inner region similarity <b>scaling</b> <b>parameters</b> sets are shown to meet this requirement including the Prandtl Plus <b>scaling</b> <b>parameters.</b> Additional similarity requirements are developed that relate the inner region thickness parameters to outer region characterization parameters.

30|$|As can be {{seen from}} Table 1, as the <b>scaling</b> <b>parameter</b> m increases, the number of {{parameters}} that the network can train is also increasing. When the <b>scaling</b> <b>parameter</b> is 1, when the network is added to 122 layers, the training parameter is 22.6 M. If the number of layers is increased, the problem of untrained will appear. When the <b>scaling</b> <b>parameter</b> is increased to 5, the maximum training parameter is 77.1 M. With the increase of parameter, the accuracy of network is higher and higher.|$|R
30|$|Tables 1 and 2 {{lists the}} {{comparison}} {{results for the}} proposed algorithm with the spatial domain state-of-the-art algorithm of [11] and bicubic technique. The proposed algorithm produces better results when compared with Yang et al.’s [11], due to the directional clustered dictionary learning. The proposed algorithm gives an average PSNR raise of 1.01, 0.59, and 0.72 dB for <b>scale</b> <b>parameters</b> 2, 3, and 4 over {{the state of the}} algorithm of Yang et al. [11] with SSIM improvement of 0.0127, 0.0182, and 0.0442 for <b>scale</b> <b>parameters</b> 2, 3, and 4 when tested on [15, 16] data sets and some other benchmark images. The improvements over the coupled K-SVD algorithm of Xu et al. [12] is 0.5, 0.66, and 0.72 dB in terms of PSNR for <b>scale</b> <b>parameters</b> 2, 3, and 4. The improvements in SSIM values are 0.0002, 0.0207, and 0.0447 for <b>scale</b> <b>parameters</b> 2, 3, and 4. The improvements over the bicubic technique over this set of test images is 2.32, 3.18, and 2.07 dB in terms of PSNR for <b>scale</b> <b>parameters</b> 2, 3, and 4 and 0.0623, 0.1412, and 0.1017 in terms of SSIM for <b>scale</b> <b>parameters</b> 2, 3, and 4, respectively. This justifies the fact that directional clustered dictionaries better recover some of the high-frequency components of the LR image.|$|R

40|$|International audienceIn {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} the asymptotic properties of non- parametric bayesian mixtures of Betas for estimating a smooth den- sity on [0, 1]. We consider a parameterisation of Betas distributions {{in terms of}} mean and <b>scale</b> <b>parameters</b> and construct a mixture of these Betas in the mean parameter, while either fixing the <b>scaling</b> <b>parameter</b> (as a function {{on the number of}} observations) or putting a proper prior on this <b>scaling</b> <b>parameter.</b> We prove that such Bayesian nonparametric models have good frequentist asymptotic properties. We determine the posterior rate of concentration around the true density and prove that it is the minimax rate of concentration when the true density belongs to a H ̈older class with regularity β, for all positive β, by choosing correctly the <b>scaling</b> <b>parameter</b> of the Betas densities, {{in terms of the number}} of observations and β. We improve on these results by considering a prior on the <b>scaling</b> <b>parameter</b> and thus obtain an adaptive estimating procedure of the density.
