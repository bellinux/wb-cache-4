40|$|In {{recognizing}} {{the significance of}} the extraordinary results achieved in the testing of materials and innovative technologies in the field of restoration this paper wants to focus on the importance of a closer examination of the effectiveness of traditional methods and materials {{as a starting point for}} a more informed interventive conservation. We describe below the cases of some treatments where the characteristics of procedural choices adopted in previous restorations have been approached and verified: a critical analysis of the maintenance procedures executed in the past has allowed to discern the operative solutions and the materials still efficient and to present them again with few corrections avoiding an uncritical, common use of new products that are sometimes very invasive. This study compares the methods <b>of</b> <b>extrados</b> strengthening and <b>of</b> tying of the light vaults and of the detached plaster in use from the seventeenth century until the middle of last century...|$|R

40|$|Over {{one hundred}} masonry vault {{structures}} {{have been studied}} by means of archaeological analysis, {{most of them are}} dated XVII – XVIII century. About one hundred and fifty design instructions have been examined, they were found in the building specifications and tenders since the end of Middle Ages.

These two data sources are quite different one from the other; the analysis results were similar and comparable for some points of view, but they also complete each other or suggested new investigations in their respective fields. The result outcome includes data on materials (most of all masonry), textures, geometric shapes, solutions for thrusts balancing, various contrivances and tricks used in the installation phase, historical nomenclature. Some of the building rules adopted by ancient masons are examined in the light of modern scientific culture and technology, evaluating validity and effectiveness.
