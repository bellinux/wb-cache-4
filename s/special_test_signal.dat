40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{research}} is to develop advanced system identification techniques {{that can be used to}} accurately measure the frequency response functions of a wind-turbine structure immersed in wind noise. To allow for accurate identification, the authors have developed a <b>special</b> <b>test</b> <b>signal</b> called the Pseudo-Random Binary Sequence (PRBS). The Matlab program that generates this signal allows the user to interactively tailor its parameters for the frequency range of interest based on the response of the wind turbine under test. By controlling NREL`s Mobile Hydraulic Shaker System, which is attached to the wind turbine structure, the PRBS signal produces the wide-band excitation necessary to perform system identification in the presence of wind noise. The techniques presented here will enable researchers to obtain modal parameters from an operating wind turbine, including frequencies, damping coefficients, and mode shapes. More importantly, the algorithms they have developed and tested (so far using input-output data from a simulated structure) permit state-space representation of the system under test, particularly the modal state space representation. This is the only system description that reveals the internal behavior the system, such as the interaction between the physical parameters, and which, in contrast to transfer functions, is valid for non-zero initial conditions...|$|E

Several non-idealities such as loop filter inaccuracy, excess loop delay and instability can be corrected using this technique. This method works in background by observing the bit-stream and generating limit cycle distributions during normal operation. It then uses the distribution data {{to estimate the}} non-idealities and takes steps to correct them. As a result, the proposed technique does not require any <b>special</b> <b>test</b> <b>signals</b> or customized hardware circuitry used in other calibration approaches.

40|$|In modern {{motion control}} and power {{conversion}} applications, {{the use of}} inverter-fed electrical machines is fast growing with continuous development {{in the field of}} power electronics and drives. The Variable Voltage Variable Frequency (VVVF) supply for electrical machines gives superior performance in terms of speed control, efficiency and dynamics compared to the machines operated directly from the mains. In one of the most basic configurations, a drive system consists of a closed loop speed control that has a current controller inside the loop. For effective and stable current control, the controller gains need to be set according to the parameters of the machine at hand. Besides, accurate parameter information is helpful in ensuring better machine exploitation as well as maintaining higher efficiency in various operating modes and conditions. The traditional methods of determining machine parameters consist of extensive machine testing under prescribed supply and ambient conditions. These methods become impracticable when the machine cannot be isolated from its load or the test equipment cannot be made available. Under such conditions, the alternatives are needed that use only the available hardware included in a standard drive to completely define the machine parameters. Self-commissioning thus comes into play in such situations. The automatic determination of machine electrical parameters before the drive is put in continuous operation is called self-commissioning of the drive system. In this thesis, self-commissioning of AC electric motors is studied, analyzed and results are presented for the implementation of different self-commissioning methods either proposed in the literature or developed {{in the course of this}} research. By far the commonest control strategy of AC machines is the vector control that allows dc machine like decoupled control of machine flux and torque. The separation of flux and torque producing current components depends heavily on the parameters of the machine at hand. In case the parameters fed to the controller do not match the actual machine parameters, the control performance deteriorates both in terms of accuracy and efficiency. For synchronous machines using permanent magnets, the magnetic model of the machine is important both for flux estimation accuracy at low speeds and for deriving maximum torque out of machine per ampere of input stator current. The identification of the magnetic model of permanent magnet synchronous machines requires <b>special</b> <b>tests</b> in a laboratory environment by loading the machine. A number of machine parameter identification methods have been studied in the past and proposed in the literature. As the power amplifier implied is almost always an inverter, the estimation of machine parameters at start-up by generating <b>special</b> <b>test</b> <b>signals</b> through the inverter have been researched in depth and are investigated in this thesis. These techniques are termed as offline parameter identification strategies. Other methods that focus on parameter updating during routine machine operation are called online parameter estimation methods. In this thesis, only the offline identification schemes are studied and explored further. With continuous improvements in power semiconductor devices' switching speeds and more powerful microprocessors being used for the control of electric drives, generating a host of <b>test</b> <b>signals</b> has been made possible. Analysing the machine response to the injected <b>test</b> <b>signals</b> using enhanced computational power onboard is relatively easier. These conditions favour the use of even more complex test strategies and algorithms for self-commissioning and to reduce the time required for conducting these tests. Moreover, the universal design of electric drives renders the self commissioning algorithms easily adaptable for different machine types used in industry. Among a number of AC machines available on the market, the most widely used in industrial drives are considered for study here. These include AC induction and permanent magnet synchronous machines. Induction machines still play a major part in industrial processes due, largely, to their ruggedness and maintenance-freeness; however, the permanent magnet machines are fast replacing them as competitive alternatives because of their low volume-to-power, weight-to-power ratios and higher efficiency. Their relatively light weight makes these machines a preferred choice in traction and propeller applications over their asynchronous counterpart...|$|R

40|$|Abstract – ADC testing {{frequently}} {{confronts the}} problem of spectral purity of harmonic <b>test</b> <b>signal.</b> The majority of dynamic ADC test methods require <b>test</b> <b>signal</b> distortion at least 10 dB {{less than that of}} the tested ADC – the condition that cannot be practically fulfilled for testing up-to-date ADCs.

40|$|A {{time-varying}} {{acoustic channel}} may be estimated by an appropriate inference using the output from a periodic <b>test</b> <b>signal.</b> In this paper it is shown {{how to do}} this in a way that takes full account of the past history of the background noise and the past history of the channel. An explicit formula is obtained for the optimal linear estimator that may be used for rapid channel estimation for a given <b>test</b> <b>signal</b> when we know the autocovariance or power spectrum of the interfering noise and the autocovariance of the echo channel variation. Given this closed formula for the optimal estimator of the channel impulse response, an efficient method for determining the optimal <b>test</b> <b>signal,</b> subject to a constraint on the <b>test</b> <b>signal</b> power, given the history of the channel and the noise, is developed. We show that if the second order statistics of the channel or the noise are known, then the optimal <b>test</b> <b>signal</b> is not white. The method includes an explicit formula for the optimal <b>test</b> <b>signal</b> given a fixed estimator. A model of channel variation which is realistic while having less complexity than a full second-order statistical model, and therefore is more amenable to robust estimation, is used in the experiments which illustrate the performance of the optimal <b>test</b> <b>signals</b> and the channel estimation method. Matrix calculus identities required for the derivation of this expression for the optimal estimator are stated and proved in the Appendixes 1 and 2. ...|$|R

40|$|The rotor {{position}} of a salient-pole permanent-magnet synchronous machine (PMSM) at standstill or rotating at low speed is often estimated by measuring the responses on high-frequency <b>test</b> <b>signals.</b> In some drives, the rotor position is computed by measuring important current ripples that are generated by supplying the PMSM periodically with high-frequency voltage test pulses.
