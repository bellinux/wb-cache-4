40|$|Electroencephalogram (EEG) -based brain-computer {{interfaces}} (BCIs) {{often use}} <b>spatial</b> <b>filters</b> to improve signal-to-noise ratio of task-related EEG activities. To obtain robust <b>spatial</b> <b>filters,</b> {{large amounts of}} labeled data, which are often expensive and labor-intensive to obtain, need to be collected in a training procedure before online BCI control. Several studies have recently developed zero-training methods using a session-to-session scenario in order to alleviate this problem. To our knowledge, a state-to-state translation, which applies <b>spatial</b> <b>filters</b> derived from one state to another, has never been reported. This study proposes a state-to-state, zero-training method to construct <b>spatial</b> <b>filters</b> for extracting EEG changes induced by motor imagery. Independent component analysis (ICA) was separately applied to the multi-channel EEG in the resting and the motor imagery states to obtain motor-related <b>spatial</b> <b>filters.</b> The resultant <b>spatial</b> <b>filters</b> were then applied to single-trial EEG to differentiate left- and right-hand imagery movements.

5000|$|A <b>spatial</b> <b>filter</b> is {{an optical}} device which uses the {{principles}} of Fourier optics to alter {{the structure of a}} beam of light or other electromagnetic radiation, typically coherent laser light. Spatial filtering is commonly used to [...] "clean up" [...] the output of lasers, removing aberrations in the beam due to imperfect, dirty, or damaged optics, or due to variations in the laser gain medium itself. This filtering can be applied to transmit a pure transverse mode from a multimode laser while blocking other modes emitted from the optical resonator. The term [...] "filtering" [...] indicatesthat the desirable structural features of the original source pass through the filter, while the undesirable features are blocked.Apparatus which follows the filter effectively sees a higher-quality but lower-powered image of the source, instead of the actual source directly. An example of the use of <b>spatial</b> <b>filter</b> can be seen in advanced setup of micro-Raman spectroscopy.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine the spatial and {{population}} (e. g., socio-economic) characteristics of low birthweight using two different cluster estimation techniques. We compared the results of Kulldorff's Spatial Scan Statistic with the results of Rushton's <b>Spatial</b> <b>filtering</b> technique across increasing sizes of <b>spatial</b> <b>filters</b> (circle). We were able to demonstrate that varying approaches exist to explore spatial variation in patterns of low birth weight. Results <b>Spatial</b> <b>filtering</b> results did not show any particular area that was not statistically significant based on SaTScan. The high rates, which remain as the filter size increases to 0. 4, 0. 5 to 0. 6 miles, respectively, indicate that these differences are less likely due to chance. The maternal characteristics of births within clusters differed considerably between the two methods. Progressively larger <b>Spatial</b> <b>filters</b> removed local <b>spatial</b> variability, which eventually produced an approximate uniform pattern of low birth weight. Conclusion SaTScan and <b>Spatial</b> <b>filtering</b> cluster estimation methods produced noticeably different results from the same individual level birth data. SaTScan clusters are likely to differ from <b>Spatial</b> <b>filtering</b> clusters in terms of population characteristics and geographic area within clusters. Using the two methods in conjunction could provide more detail about the population and spatial features contained with each type of cluster. </p...|$|R
40|$|By {{reducing}} {{the effects of}} wavefront phase corrugation caused by atmospheric turbulence, spa-tial filtering can redunce the uncertainties in visibility observations with optical/IR interferom-eters. The aim of the work described in this Thesis {{was to investigate the}} use of <b>spatial</b> <b>filtering</b> on astronomical optical interferometers and to construct an optimised filtering solution for the Cambridge Optical Aperture Synthesis Telescope (COAST). A numerical simulation was carried out to predict the performance of several different forms of <b>spatial</b> <b>filtering.</b> The results of this investigation led to the design of a pinhole <b>spatial</b> <b>filtering</b> system for use at COAST. This system used near-infrared achromatic lenses as the coupling optics and an array of different sized pinholes. All components were tested and a series of alignment schemes were devised for both the coupling optics and the pinholes.

40|$|The Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) {{algorithm}} {{is a highly}} successful method for efficiently calculating <b>spatial</b> <b>filters</b> for brain signal classification. <b>Spatial</b> <b>filtering</b> can improve classification performance considerably, but demands {{that a large number}} of electrodes be mounted, which is inconvenient in day-to-day BCI usage.

50|$|The {{simplest}} way to eliminate these effects was to filter them out physically using what essentially {{amounts to a}} Fourier transform technique applied to the beam's spaitial intensity profile.

50|$|The {{only way}} in {{practice}} {{to approach the}} theoretical sharpness possible in a digital imaging system such as a camera is to use more pixels in the camera sensor than samples in the final image, and 'downconvert' or 'interpolate' using special digital processing which cuts off high frequencies above the Nyquist rate to avoid aliasing whilst maintaining a reasonably flat MTF up to that frequency. This approach was first taken in the 1970s when flying spot scanners, and later CCD line scanners, were developed which sampled more pixels than were needed and then downconverted, which is why movies have always looked sharper on television than other material shot with a video camera. The only theoretically correct way to interpolate or downconvert is by use of a steep low-pass <b>spatial</b> <b>filter,</b> realized by convolution with a two-dimensional sin(x)/x weighting function which requires powerful processing. In practice, various mathematical approximations to this are used to reduce the processing requirement. These approximations are now implemented widely in video editing systems and in image processing programs such as Photoshop.|$|E
50|$|Just as {{standard}} definition video {{with a high}} contrast MTF is only possible with oversampling, so HD television with full theoretical sharpness is only possible by starting with a camera that has a significantly higher resolution, followed by digitally filtering. With movies now being shot in 4k and even 8k video for the cinema, {{we can expect to}} see the best pictures on HDTV only from movies or material shot at the higher standard. However much we raise the number of pixels used in cameras, this will always remain true in absence of a perfect optical <b>spatial</b> <b>filter.</b> Similarly, a 5-megapixel image obtained from a 5-megapixel still camera can never be sharper than a 5-megapixel image obtained after down-conversion from an equal quality 10-megapixel still camera. Because of the problem of maintaining a high contrast MTF, broadcasters like the BBC did for a long time consider maintaining standard definition television, but improving its quality by shooting and viewing with many more pixels (though as previously mentioned, such a system, though impressive, does ultimately lack the very fine detail which, though attenuated, enhances the effect of true HD viewing).|$|E
