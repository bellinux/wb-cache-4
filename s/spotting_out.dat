The main action {{has been focused on}} the reduction of the production costs through Value Stream Mapping principles, <b>spotting</b> <b>out</b> those commonly called "hidden costs". The case study has highlighted some basic problems that are related to work-in-progress, waiting time, and number of parts in the buffers. Optimizing these elements through a simulation model using a Taboo Search Algorithm has led to a reduction of wastes in terms of materials, time and resources, and by the way to lower cost...|$|E
40|$|The European Union is the {{greatest}} donor of the world. Until 2002, the south African country Zimbabwe was a recipient of European development aid. Due to major disagreements over key issues, such as human rights and democratic principles, theEuropean Union has partially suspended official development cooperation in 2002. Zimbabwe has not longer fulfilled the criterions of Good Governance, which isdemanded by the European Union. In order to restore the {{respect for human rights}} and ademocratic way of governance, the EU has posed sanctions and resolutions. This study provides a study of the outcomes of these repressive measures. Have the sanctions led to a better governance performance in Zimbabwe?

40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to investigate the adoption of improved food legume technologies and welfare impacts of improved food legume varieties specifically on income, consumption expenditure and calorie intake in Bale highlands of Ethiopia. The study focused particularly on the identification of factors determining adoption of improved food legume technologies, evaluation of welfare impacts of adoption status and intensity of improved food legume varieties, identifying intra-household impact dynamics due to adoption of improved legume varieties and <b>spotting</b> <b>out</b> the major challenges and opportunities faced by smallholders in their adoption of improved food legume technologies [...] This study used cross sectional data that acquired from a total of 600 households, which were randomly and proportionately sampled from 12 major legume producer kebeles in 3 districts of Bale highlands by using three-stage sampling technique. Probit and Clog-log binary model were estimated to identify the underlying factors that determine adoption of improved food legume varieties; and fertilizer and pesticide, respectively and separately. PSM model was estimated to evaluate the welfare impacts of adoption of improved food legume varieties. In addition, continuous treatment effects model (GPS) was also employed to estimate the welfare impact of intensity of adoption by discarding non-adopters from the analysis. The results from probit and clog-log indicate that age, livestock holding, farm size, membership in farmers cooperatives, contact with agricultural research center, household head participation in off-farm activity, distance from agricultural extension office and main market; and location (district dummy) were factors that significantly determine farmers decision to adopt improved food legume technologies. The study also indicates that adoption of improved food legume technologies can motivate farmers to shift from the monocropping system to diversified one, improve income since they fetch higher prices than common cereals and they are the major source of protein for the household who cannot acquire it from animal products. However, adoption of improved food legume technologies is highly constrained by labor-intensive nature of the production, lack of improved food legume technologies especially water logging tolerant varieties and market irregularities. The outputs from PSM indicate that adoption of improved food legume varieties has positive and significant impact on the income and the adopter receive 25 % higher income than non-adopter. The intra household analysis indicated that households with productive labor force receive better treatment effect while households with economically dependents female members receive considerably lower treatment effects from adoption of improved food legume varieties, suggesting the prevalent intra-household differences. The result of GPS also confirms the positive effect of intensity of adoption on income, consumption expenditure and calorie intake. The results generally suggests the need to design interventions enhancing adoption of food legume technologies focusing on improving adoption rates and minimizing intra household difference in income.
