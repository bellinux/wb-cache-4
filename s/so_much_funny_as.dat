5000|$|In its {{original}} American broadcasting, [...] "Sheesh! Cab, Bob?" [...] was viewed by an estimated 4.91 million viewers {{and received a}} 2.7 rating/4% share among adults {{between the ages of}} 18 and 49, an improvement from last episode and became the highest rated episode of the season to be aired after the first two episodes. Rowan Kaiser of The A.V. Club gave the episode an A-, saying [...] "As <b>funny</b> <b>as</b> the episode is, it's also genuinely sweet by the end, with Bob and Tina bonding over how much work he's done. Of course, that just makes his drunken bender with transvestite hookers that <b>much</b> <b>funnier,</b> <b>as</b> well as Louise acting as Tina's kissing coordinator and sending her to boot camp." ...|$|R
500|$|The {{joke about}} Mulder wanting Richard Gere {{to appear in}} the movie stemmed from the fact that Duchovny's acting was often {{compared}} to Gere's. Duchovny decided to turn the idea into a joke, saying, [...] "we used to always have the joke on set that when they do the movie it's going to be Richard Gere and Jodie Foster [...] So I originally wrote the teaser for Richard Gere and Jodie Foster and I just started to think about it and you know, it's <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>funnier</b> with Garry and Téa." [...] The episode featured several uncredited celebrity cameos. During the premiere of the movie, Duchovny's Return to Me costars Minnie Driver and David Alan Grier appear as members of the audience. In addition, Chris Carter, the show's creator, made a cameo during the theater scene. The appearance was his second in the series.|$|R
5000|$|Much of Bad Grandpa {{was filmed}} in Cleveland and Columbus, Ohio, {{as well as}} North Carolina.

[...] Alterian, Inc.'s prosthetic Irving Zisman makeup took {{three and a half hours}} to apply to Knoxville every morning. Five hours were needed for scenes requiring Knoxville to remove his shirt. Jackson Nicoll was cast as Billy, Irving Zisman's grandson. Knoxville cast Nicoll after working with him on the 2012 film Fun Size. [...] "Jackson would just follow me on the set and verbally assault me while hitting me in the zipper," [...] Knoxville said. [...] "I was just shaking my head thinking that this kid is a piece of work. He's unbelievable. I think he was sent from heaven." ...|$|R

A future party leader, Kim Beazley Jr., considered Young {{on a par with}} Paul Keating as the most effective baiter of Liberal politicians, although Young [...] "was <b>much</b> <b>funnier,</b> but gentler <b>as</b> well".|$|R
5000|$|The {{first song}} on the album, [...] "Such Small Hands", a spoken word track which is seen to [...] " [...] build to {{seemingly}} uncontrollable levels". Drummer Brad Vander Lugt commented on its surprising popularity, saying: “We cannot figure it out! It’s just an intro to the record, I {{have no idea why}} people have clung to it <b>so</b> <b>much...</b> It’s <b>funny,</b> we don’t even count it as a song!” [...] "Bury Your Flame" [...] is seen as [...] "a perfect fusion of blues, post-rock and hardcore".|$|R
5000|$|Writing for The Guardian, Travis Irvine {{highlighted}} the film among valuable comedy {{contributions to the}} discussion of climate change, and called it a [...] "poignant video". Lindsay Abrams of Salon wrote: [...] "What I like <b>so</b> <b>much</b> about <b>Funny</b> or Die's parody PSA about Climate Change Denial Disorder is that, aside from medicalizing what in actuality is just willful ignorance, it’s pretty spot-on." [...] Abrams lamented that the Senator's pronouncement in the film against any action on climate change was: [...] "all the more difficult to hear knowing {{that the vast majority}} of all Americans — including half of Republicans — support government action on climate change." ...|$|R

There is nothing which the Stumfoldian ladies of Littlebath liked <b>so</b> <b>much</b> as these little jokes which bordered on the profanity of the outer world, which made them feel themselves to be almost <b>as</b> <b>funny</b> <b>as</b> the sinners, and gave them a slight taste, as it were, of the pleasures of iniquity.|$|R

60|$|A strange exotic creature, this Saki, to us {{many others}} {{who were trying to}} do it too. For we were so domestic, he so terrifyingly cosmopolitan. While we were being <b>funny,</b> <b>as</b> planned, with collar-studs and hot-water bottles, he was being <b>much</b> <b>funnier</b> with werwolves and tigers. Our little dialogues were between John and Mary; his, and how much better, between Bertie van Tahn and the Baroness. Even the most casual {{intruder}} into one of his sketches, as it might be our Tomkins, had to be called Belturbet or de Ropp, and for his hero, weary man-of-the-world at seventeen, nothing less thrilling than Clovis Sangrail would do. In our envy we may have wondered sometimes if it were not much easier to be funny with tigers than with collar-studs; if Saki's careless cruelty, that strange boyish insensitiveness of his, did not give him an unfair start in the pursuit of laughter. It may have been so; but, fortunately, our efforts to be funny in the Saki manner have not survived to prove it.|$|R
5000|$|Midnight in Paris {{has been}} {{compared}} to Allen's The Purple Rose of Cairo (1985), in that the functioning of the magical realism therein is never explained. David Edelstein, New York, commended that approach, stating that it eliminates, [...] "the sci-fi wheels and pulleys that tend to suck up <b>so</b> <b>much</b> screen time in time-travel movies." [...] He goes on to applaud the film stating that, [...] "this supernatural comedy isn't just Allen's best film in more than a decade; it's the only one that manages to rise above its tidy parable structure and be easy, graceful, and glancingly <b>funny,</b> <b>as</b> if buoyed by its befuddled hero's enchantment." ...|$|R

500|$|The episode {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics. HitFix Senior Editor Alan Sepinwall wrote that [...] "Timothy Dalton was everything {{we had come}} to expect from him in the part: scary and dangerous and then <b>so</b> <b>much</b> the <b>funnier</b> for the way he kept trying to work the steps and turn over a new leaf. The episode left 's sincerity up in the air for most of the hour - was he really serious about making amends, or just trying to distract Chuck from his latest evil plan? - but Volkoff is such a well-drawn character, and Dalton so talented and versatile, that the comedy worked either way... Vivian, on the other hand? I'd been iffy on her in her most recent appearance, and putting her on camera with , even briefly, was just a reminder of how much less she brings to the table." [...] Ryan McGee of The A.V. Club gave the episode a A-. Though he praised Dalton's performance, McGee wrote, [...] "The direct parallels between Chuck and Vivian haven't really panned out in the way the show initially envisioned it. Let's face it: These two aren't exactly Buffy and Faith in terms of being foils for one another. The show has never painted Chuck as ever potentially going to the dark side. It has used Casey and occasionally Sarah to serve that function at times, but never Chuck. At this point, he's as set in his moral code as possible. Had the Vivian storyline happened at the outset of his Intersect 2.0 days, perhaps the taste of power could have gone to his head, with Vivian {{as an example of the}} road not taken. As such, Vivian's existence largely serves to connect her to the larger spy world of the show, not draw a direct parallel to the support system that helped Chuck overcome any potential temptations." [...] Eric Goldman of IGN gave this episode a score of 8 out of 10, writing, [...] "This Chuck got off to a shaky start. I don't know how to put my finger on it exactly, but the pacing felt off in the first third or so of the episode... Thankfully, things picked up considerably as the episode went along – I'd say the turning point was the scene in which Chuck was sent in to meet with the pirates. The way Chuck's big announcement that he worked for Alexei Volkoff immediately led to a bunch of guns pulled on him was <b>funny,</b> <b>as</b> was not only Chuck asking to play Uno (for his life), but that the pirate did indeed have the game." [...] Carl Cortez of Assignment X, however, gave the episode a negative review, calling it [...] "a painfully nonsense driven episode that's now grasping at straws in an attempt to round out the last part of the season with an adequate storyline." ...|$|R
