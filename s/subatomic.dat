5|$|Emilio Gino Segrè (1 February 1905 – 22 April 1989) was an Italian-American {{physicist}} and Nobel laureate, {{who discovered the}} elements technetium and astatine, and the antiproton, a <b>subatomic</b> antiparticle, {{for which he was}} awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1959.|$|E
5|$|Pierre Teilhard de Chardin's metaphysical Omega Point theory, {{found in}} his book The Phenomenon of Man (1955), {{describes}} the gradual development of the universe from <b>subatomic</b> particles to human society, which he viewed as its final stage and goal.|$|E
5|$|Feynman {{developed}} a widely used pictorial representation scheme for the mathematical expressions governing {{the behavior of}} <b>subatomic</b> particles, which later became known as Feynman diagrams. During his lifetime, Feynman {{became one of the}} best-known scientists in the world. In a 1999 poll of 130 leading physicists worldwide by the British journal Physics World he was ranked as one of the ten greatest physicists of all time.|$|E
5|$|Francium has no {{commercial}} applications, {{but because}} of francium's relatively simple atomic structure, among other things, {{it has been used}} in spectroscopy experiments, leading to more information regarding energy levels and the coupling constants between <b>subatomic</b> particles. Studies on the light emitted by laser-trapped francium-210 ions have provided accurate data on transitions between atomic energy levels, similar to those predicted by quantum theory.|$|E
5|$|Though {{the word}} atom {{originally}} denoted a particle that cannot be cut into smaller particles, in modern scientific usage the atom {{is composed of}} various <b>subatomic</b> particles. The constituent particles of an atom are the electron, the proton and the neutron; all three are fermions. However, the hydrogen-1 atom has no neutrons and the hydron ion has no electrons.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, matter {{itself is}} {{expected}} to come {{under the influence of}} radioactive decay, as even the most stable materials break apart into <b>subatomic</b> particles. Current data suggest that the universe has a flat geometry (or very close to flat), and thus, will not collapse in on itself after a finite time, and the infinite future allows for the occurrence of a number of massively improbable events, such as the formation of Boltzmann brains.|$|E
5|$|Francium's {{ability to}} be synthesized, trapped, and cooled, along with its {{relatively}} simple atomic structure, has made it the subject of specialized spectroscopy experiments. These experiments have led to more specific information regarding energy levels and the coupling constants between <b>subatomic</b> particles. Studies on the light emitted by laser-trapped francium-210 ions have provided accurate data on transitions between atomic energy levels which are fairly similar to those predicted by quantum theory.|$|E
5|$|Outer {{space is}} sparsely filled with several dozen types of organic {{molecules}} discovered to date by microwave spectroscopy, blackbody radiation {{left over from}} the big bang and the origin of the universe, and cosmic rays, which include ionized atomic nuclei and various <b>subatomic</b> particles. There is also some gas, plasma and dust, and small meteors. Additionally, there are signs of human life in outer space today, such as material left over from previous manned and unmanned launches which are a potential hazard to spacecraft. Some of this debris re-enters the atmosphere periodically.|$|E
5|$|Synchrotrons are {{generally}} national facilities, each with several dedicated beamlines where data is collected without interruption. Synchrotrons were originally {{designed for use}} by high-energy physicists studying <b>subatomic</b> particles and cosmic phenomena. The largest component of each synchrotron is its electron storage ring. This ring is actually not a perfect circle, but a many-sided polygon. At each corner of the polygon, or sector, precisely aligned magnets bend the electron stream. As the electrons’ path is bent, they emit bursts {{of energy in the}} form of X-rays.|$|E
5|$|The first <b>subatomic</b> {{particles}} to {{be formed}} included protons, neutrons, and electrons. Though simple atomic nuclei formed {{within the first}} three minutes after the Big Bang, thousands of years passed before the first electrically neutral atoms formed. The majority of atoms produced by the Big Bang were hydrogen, along with helium and traces of lithium. Giant clouds of these primordial elements later coalesced through gravity to form stars and galaxies, and the heavier elements were synthesized either within stars or during supernovae.|$|E
5|$|The {{volume of}} interplanetary space is a nearly total vacuum, {{with a mean}} free path of about one astronomical unit at the orbital {{distance}} of the Earth. However, this space is not completely empty, and is sparsely filled with cosmic rays, which include ionized atomic nuclei and various <b>subatomic</b> particles. There is also gas, plasma and dust, small meteors, and several dozen types of organic molecules discovered to date by microwave spectroscopy. A cloud of interplanetary dust is visible at night as a faint band called the zodiacal light.|$|E
5|$|With the {{development}} of the particle accelerator {{during the first half of}} the twentieth century, physicists began to delve deeper into the properties of <b>subatomic</b> particles. The first successful attempt to accelerate electrons using electromagnetic induction was made in 1942 by Donald Kerst. His initial betatron reached energies of 2.3MeV, while subsequent betatrons achieved 300MeV. In 1947, synchrotron radiation was discovered with a 70MeV electron synchrotron at General Electric. This radiation was caused by the acceleration of electrons through a magnetic field as they moved near the speed of light.|$|E
5|$|Cross dons the Yellowjacket {{and attacks}} Lang before Lang is arrested by Paxton. Cross takes Cassie hostage to lure Lang into another fight. Lang {{overrides}} the regulator and shrinks to <b>subatomic</b> size to penetrate Cross' suit and sabotage it to shrink uncontrollably, killing Cross. Lang {{disappears into the}} quantum realm but manages to reverse the effects {{and returns to the}} macroscopic world. Out of gratitude for Lang's heroism, Paxton covers for Lang to keep him out of prison. Seeing that Lang survived and returned from the quantum realm, Pym wonders if his wife is alive as well. Later, Lang meets up with Luis, who tells him that Wilson is looking for him.|$|E
5|$|Method and Luma {{both worked}} on {{creating}} the various ants {{seen in the}} film, with Method creating the several species of ants, to share among the vendors. Luma also handled many of the scenes at Pym Technologies when Ant-Man attempts to acquire the Yellowjacket. ILM worked on the Falcon fight sequence, having done Falcon visual effects in The Winter Soldier. Using practical suit pieces built by Legacy Effects, ILM mixed live-action shots with digital take-overs and fully digital shots to create the sequence. ILM also handled the sequences in the quantum realm, providing an array of microscopic and largely psychedelic imagery for the <b>subatomic</b> shrinking, taking advantage of procedural fractal rendering techniques the studio had utilized on Lucy.|$|E
5|$|Outside a {{protective}} atmosphere and magnetic field, {{there are few}} obstacles to the passage through space of energetic <b>subatomic</b> particles known as cosmic rays. These particles have energies ranging from about 106eV up to an extreme 1020eV of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays. The peak flux of cosmic rays occurs at energies of about 109eV, with approximately 87% protons, 12% helium nuclei and 1% heavier nuclei. In the high energy range, the flux of electrons is only about 1% of that of protons. Cosmic rays can damage electronic components and pose a health threat to space travelers. According to astronauts, like Don Pettit, space has a burned/metallic odor that clings to their suits and equipment, similar to the scent of an arc welding torch.|$|E
5|$|Pym, who {{manipulated}} Lang {{through an}} unknowing Luis into stealing the suit as a test, wants Lang {{to become the}} new Ant-Man to steal the Yellowjacket from Cross. Having been spying on Cross after discovering his intentions, van Dyne and Pym train Lang to fight and to control ants. While van Dyne harbors resentment towards Pym about her mother Janet's death, he reveals that Janet, known as the Wasp, disappeared into a <b>subatomic</b> quantum realm while disabling a Soviet nuclear missile. Pym warns Lang that he could suffer a similar fate if he overrides his suit's regulator. They send him to steal a device that will aid their heist from the Avengers' headquarters, where he briefly fights Sam Wilson.|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} of the AdS/CFT correspondence in late 1997 {{was the culmination of}} a long history of efforts to relate string theory to nuclear physics. In fact, string theory was originally developed during the late 1960s and early 1970s as a theory of hadrons, the <b>subatomic</b> particles like the proton and neutron that are held together by the strong nuclear force. The idea was that each of these particles could be viewed as a different oscillation mode of a string. In the late 1960s, experimentalists had found that hadrons fall into families called Regge trajectories with squared energy proportional to angular momentum, and theorists showed that this relationship emerges naturally from the physics of a rotating relativistic string.|$|E
5|$|The {{electron}} {{is by far}} {{the least}} massive of these particles at , with a negative electrical charge and a size that is too small to be measured using available techniques. It is the lightest particle with a positive rest mass measured. Under ordinary conditions, electrons are bound to the positively charged nucleus by the attraction created from opposite electric charges. If an atom has more or fewer electrons than its atomic number, then it becomes respectively negatively or positively charged as a whole; a charged atom is called an ion. Electrons have been known since the late 19th century, mostly thanks to J.J. Thomson; see history of <b>subatomic</b> physics for details.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} day, while {{reviewing the}} station's surveillance tapes, Mulder sees footage of Banton {{staring at the}} floor. After blowing up the frame, Mulder sees the logo for a company called Polarity Magnetics on Banton's jacket. The agents visit Polarity Magnetics, where they meet scientist Christopher Davey (Kevin McNulty). He identifies Banton, a physicist conducting research into dark matter. Davey reveals that Banton disappeared five weeks earlier after an incident in his laboratory {{in which he was}} locked in a target room with an active particle accelerator and exposed to a large amount of <b>subatomic</b> particles. His account is enough for Scully to consider spontaneous human combustion, but Mulder is now doubtful of this theory.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} protons and {{neutrons}} in the atomic nucleus can be modified, although this can require very high energies {{because of the}} strong force. Nuclear fusion occurs when multiple atomic particles join to form a heavier nucleus, such as through the energetic collision of two nuclei. For example, {{at the core of}} the Sun protons require energies of 3–10 keV to overcome their mutual repulsion—the coulomb barrier—and fuse together into a single nucleus. Nuclear fission is the opposite process, causing a nucleus to split into two smaller nuclei—usually through radioactive decay. The nucleus can also be modified through bombardment by high energy <b>subatomic</b> particles or photons. If this modifies the number of protons in a nucleus, the atom changes to a different chemical element.|$|E
5|$|After {{turning down}} offers from IBM and the Brookhaven National Laboratory, Segrè {{returned}} to Berkeley in 1952. He {{moved his family}} from Berkeley to nearby Lafayette, California, in 1955. Working with Chamberlain and others, he began searching for the antiproton, a <b>subatomic</b> antiparticle of the proton. The antiparticle of the electron, the positron had been predicted by Paul Dirac in 1931 and then discovered by Carl D. Anderson in 1932. By analogy, it was now expected {{that there would be}} an antiparticle corresponding to the proton, but no one had found one, and even in 1955 some scientists doubted that they existed. Using Lawrence's Bevatron set to 6GeV, they managed to detect conclusive evidence of antiprotons. Chamberlain and Segrè were awarded the 1959 Nobel Prize in Physics for their discovery. This was controversial, because Clyde Wiegand and Thomas Ypsilantis were co-authors of the same article, but did not share the prize.|$|E
5|$|All of {{the forces}} in the {{universe}} are based on four fundamental interactions. The strong and weak forces are nuclear forces that act only at very short distances, and {{are responsible for the}} interactions between <b>subatomic</b> particles, including nucleons and compound nuclei. The electromagnetic force acts between electric charges, and the gravitational force acts between masses. All other forces in nature derive from these four fundamental interactions. For example, friction is a manifestation of the electromagnetic force acting between the atoms of two surfaces, and the Pauli exclusion principle, which does not permit atoms to pass through each other. Similarly, the forces in springs, modeled by Hooke's law, are the result of electromagnetic forces and the Exclusion Principle acting together to return an object to its equilibrium position. Centrifugal forces are acceleration forces that arise simply from the acceleration of rotating frames of reference.|$|E
5|$|Study {{has shown}} that the origin of charge is from certain types of <b>subatomic</b> {{particles}} which have the property of electric charge. Electric charge gives rise to and interacts with the electromagnetic force, one of the four fundamental forces of nature. The most familiar carriers of electrical charge are the electron and proton. Experiment has shown charge to be a conserved quantity, that is, the net charge within an isolated system will always remain constant regardless of any changes taking place within that system. Within the system, charge may be transferred between bodies, either by direct contact, or by passing along a conducting material, such as a wire. The informal term static electricity refers to the net presence (or 'imbalance') of charge on a body, usually caused when dissimilar materials are rubbed together, transferring charge from one to the other.|$|E
5|$|In 1924, Louis de Broglie {{proposed}} that all moving particles—particularly <b>subatomic</b> particles such as electrons—exhibit {{a degree of}} wave-like behavior. Erwin Schrödinger, fascinated by this idea, explored {{whether or not the}} movement of an electron in an atom could be better explained as a wave rather than as a particle. Schrödinger's equation, published in 1926, describes an electron as a wavefunction instead of as a point particle. This approach elegantly predicted many of the spectral phenomena that Bohr's model failed to explain. Although this concept was mathematically convenient, it was difficult to visualize, and faced opposition. One of its critics, Max Born, proposed instead that Schrödinger's wavefunction described not the electron but rather all its possible states, and thus could be used to calculate the probability of finding an electron at any given location around the nucleus. This reconciled the two opposing theories of particle versus wave electrons and the idea of wave–particle duality was introduced. This theory stated that the electron may exhibit the properties of both a wave and a particle. For example, it can be refracted like a wave, and has mass like a particle.|$|E
5|$|The Big Bang {{theory is}} the {{prevailing}} cosmological {{model for the}} universe from the earliest known periods through its subsequent large-scale evolution. The model describes how the universe expanded from a very high density and high temperature state, and offers a comprehensive explanation for {{a broad range of}} phenomena, including the abundance of light elements, the cosmic microwave background (CMB), large scale structure and Hubble's law. If the known laws of physics are extrapolated to the highest density regime, the result is a singularity which is typically associated with the Big Bang. Physicists are undecided whether this means the universe began from a singularity, or that current knowledge is insufficient to describe the universe at that time. Detailed measurements of the expansion rate of the universe place the Big Bang at around 13.8 billion years ago, which is thus considered the age of the universe. After the initial expansion, the universe cooled sufficiently to allow the formation of <b>subatomic</b> particles, and later simple atoms. Giant clouds of these primordial elements later coalesced through gravity in halos of dark matter, eventually forming the stars and galaxies visible today.|$|E
25|$|The lambda {{particle}} {{is a type}} of <b>subatomic</b> particle in <b>subatomic</b> particle physics.|$|E
25|$|The muon is an {{unstable}} <b>subatomic</b> particle {{with a mean}} lifetime of , much longer than many other <b>subatomic</b> particles. As with the decay of the non-elementary neutron (with a lifetime around 15 minutes), muon decay is slow (by <b>subatomic</b> standards) because the decay is mediated by the weak interaction exclusively (rather than the more powerful strong interaction or electromagnetic interaction), and because the mass difference between the muon and the set of its decay products is small, providing few kinetic degrees of freedom for decay. Muon decay almost always produces at least three particles, which must include an electron of the same charge as the muon and two neutrinos of different types.|$|E
25|$|Bosons, a {{class of}} {{elementary}} <b>subatomic</b> particles in particle physics were named after Satyendra Nath Bose to commemorate his contributions to science.|$|E
25|$|<b>Subatomic</b> {{particles}} {{may be more}} or less penetrating and may {{be generated}} by a radioisotope or a device, depending upon the type of particle.|$|E
25|$|Physicists {{report the}} {{possible}} detection {{of a new}} <b>subatomic</b> particle, Zc(3900), a hadron {{which may be the}} first tetraquark to have been observed experimentally.|$|E
25|$|The inner {{workings}} of atomic and <b>subatomic</b> processes are necessarily and essentially inaccessible to direct observation, because the act of observing them would greatly affect them.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} years of the 20th century the atom– long {{believed}} to be the smallest building-block of matter– was proven to consist of even smaller components called protons, neutrons and electrons, which are known as <b>subatomic</b> particles. Starting in the 1960s, other <b>subatomic</b> particles began being discovered. In the 1970s, it was discovered that protons and neutrons (and other hadrons) are themselves made up of smaller particles called quarks. The Standard Model is the set of rules that describes the interactions of these particles.|$|E
25|$|It {{was found}} that <b>subatomic</b> {{particles}} and electromagnetic waves are neither simply particle nor wave but have certain properties of each. This originated the concept of wave–particle duality.|$|E
25|$|Quantum {{mechanics}} is {{the science}} of the very small. It explains the behavior of matter and its interactions with energy {{on the scale of}} atoms and <b>subatomic</b> particles.|$|E

25|$|A quark {{is a type}} of {{elementary}} particle found in nucleons and other <b>subatomic</b> particles. They are a major constituent of matter, along with leptons. The quark model was first postulated independently by physicist Murray Gell-Mann in 1964.|$|E
