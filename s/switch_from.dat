5|$|From Spring 2007 to 2008 the {{messages}} were handled by a Ruby persistent queue server called Starling, but since 2009 implementation has been gradually replaced with software written in Scala. The <b>switch</b> <b>from</b> Ruby to Scala and the JVM has given Twitter a performance boost from 200–300 requests per second per host to around 10,000–20,000 requests per second per host. This boost {{was greater than}} the 10x improvement that Twitter's engineers envisioned when starting the switch. The continued development of Twitter has also involved a <b>switch</b> <b>from</b> monolithic development of a single app to an architecture where different services are built independently and joined through remote procedure calls.|$|E
5|$|The {{forward speed}} at which non-oscillatory leaning increases, where the capsize mode {{eigenvalues}} <b>switch</b> <b>from</b> negative to positive in a pitchfork bifurcation at about 8m/s (18mph) in this example, is called the capsize speed. Above this speed, this non-oscillating lean eventually causes the uncontrolled bike to fall over.|$|E
5|$|The {{forward speed}} at which {{oscillations}} do not increase, where the weave mode eigenvalues <b>switch</b> <b>from</b> positive to negative in a Hopf bifurcation at about 5.3m/s (12mph) in this example, is called the weave speed. Below this speed, oscillations increase until the uncontrolled bike falls over. Above this speed, oscillations eventually die out.|$|E

In 2017 one member <b>switched</b> <b>from</b> NEOS to ÖVP. Three members <b>switched</b> <b>from</b> Grüne to independent; one member <b>switched</b> <b>from</b> SPÖ to independent. On August 9, 2017 Team Stronach {{political}} {{group has been}} disbanded and one member left independent group to FPÖ.|$|R
50|$|An Institute of Agriculture was {{established}} at Gurdaspur. In 1988 the university <b>switched</b> <b>from</b> the trimester to semester system and in 1993 it <b>switched</b> <b>from</b> the letter grade {{system to a}} 10.00 credit point average system.|$|R
5|$|Troponin I, slow {{skeletal}} muscle is a protein that in humans is encoded by the TNNI1 gene. An isoform <b>switch</b> <b>from</b> ssTnI to cTnI occurs during perinatal heart development. ssTnI is not {{expressed in the}} embryonic hearts of Xenopus and zebrafish, while it is expressed in the somites and {{skeletal muscle}}s.|$|E
5|$|Another {{proposed}} {{remedy for}} farmers of pollinated crops {{is simply to}} <b>switch</b> <b>from</b> using beekeepers {{to the use of}} native bees, such as bumble bees and mason bees. Native bees can be helped to establish themselves by providing suitable nesting locations and some additional crops the bees could use to feed from (e.g. when the pollination season of the commercial crops on the farm has ended).|$|E
5|$|Around 1900, Dr. Richard H. Stein, a Berlin musicologist, made a quarter-tone clarinet, {{which was}} soon abandoned. Years later, another German, Fritz Schüller of Markneukirchen, built a quarter tone clarinet, with two {{parallel}} bores of slightly different lengths whose tone holes are operated {{using the same}} keywork and a valve to <b>switch</b> <b>from</b> one bore to the other.|$|E
30|$|<b>Switching</b> <b>from</b> {{concrete}} to all-wood and hybrid timber check dams {{would reduce}} CO 2 emissions by 54 and 43  %, respectively. <b>Switching</b> <b>from</b> steel to all-wood and hybrid timber check dams reduced CO 2 emissions by 28 and 11  %, respectively.|$|R
5000|$|If [...] is {{positive}} at some times, negative at others {{and is only}} zero instantaneously, then the solution is straightforward and is a bang-bang control that <b>switches</b> <b>from</b> [...] to [...] at times when [...] <b>switches</b> <b>from</b> negative to positive.|$|R
25|$|Suppose a {{triangle}} is triangulated and labeled with {1,2,3}. Consider the cyclic sequence of labels on {{the boundary of}} the triangle. Define the degree of the labeling as {{the difference between the}} number of <b>switches</b> <b>from</b> 1 to 2, and the number of <b>switches</b> <b>from</b> 2 to 1. See examples in the table at the right. Note that the degree is the same if we count <b>switches</b> <b>from</b> 2 to 3 minus 3 to 2, or from 3 to 1 minus 1 to 3.|$|R
5|$|As much as 80% of {{therapeutic}} doses of salicylic acid is metabolized in the liver. Conjugation with glycine forms salicyluric acid, and with glucuronic acid to form two different glucuronide esters. The conjugate with the acetyl group intact {{is referred to}} as the acyl glucuronide; the deacetylated conjugate is the phenolic glucuronide. These metabolic pathways have only a limited capacity. Small amounts of salicylic acid are also hydroxylated to gentisic acid. With large salicylate doses, the kinetics <b>switch</b> <b>from</b> first-order to zero-order, as metabolic pathways become saturated and renal excretion becomes increasingly important.|$|E
5|$|Availability of {{substitute}} goods: The {{more and}} closer the substitutes available, {{the higher the}} elasticity is likely to be, as people can easily <b>switch</b> <b>from</b> one good to another if an even minor price change is made; There is a strong substitution effect. If no close substitutes are available, the substitution effect will be small and the demand inelastic.|$|E
5|$|Cognitive {{flexibility}} varies {{during the}} lifespan of an individual. Researchers have more specifically described cognitive flexibility as {{the capacity to}} shift or switch one’s thinking and attention between different tasks or operations typically {{in response to a}} change in rules or demands. For example, when sorting cards based on specific rules, children are considered cognitively flexible if they are able to successfully <b>switch</b> <b>from</b> sorting cards based on the color of the object to sorting based on the type of object on the card.|$|E

5|$|Halfway {{through the}} year South Katanga was further divided into the provinces of Katanga Oriental and Lualaba (also known as the new South Katanga). Though they were opposed to such divisions, many Katangese leaders from the secession joined the new provincial governments. A new {{constitutional}} commission was established, and in March 1964 it recommended that the Congo <b>switch</b> <b>from</b> its parliamentary system to a presidential model of government.|$|E
5|$|In November 2016, Pizza Hut told {{media that}} it had merged with Eagle Boys. In a statement, Pizza Hut said it {{intended}} to convert {{about half of the}} Eagles Boys to the Pizza Hut brand before Christmas 2016; the remainder it hopes to convert by April2017. The first store to <b>switch</b> <b>from</b> Eagle Boys to Pizza Hut was on Sydney's northern beaches.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{significant}} differences between proto-globalization and archaic globalization was the <b>switch</b> <b>from</b> inter-nation trading of rarities to the trading of commodities. During the 12th and 13th centuries it was common to trade items that were foreign and rare to different cultures. A popular trade during archaic globalization involved European merchants sailing to areas of India or China in order to purchase luxury items such as porcelain, silk and spices. Traders of the pre-modern period also traded drugs and certain foods such as sugar cane and other crops.|$|E

5|$|The GR1A is the {{reconnaissance}} variant {{used by the}} RAF and RSAF, {{fitted with}} the TIRRS (Tornado Infra-Red Reconnaissance System), replacing the cannon. The RAF ordered 30 GR1As, 14 as GR1 rebuilds and 16 as new-builds. When the Tornado GR1s were upgraded to become GR4s, GR1A aircraft were upgraded to GR4A standard. The <b>switch</b> <b>from</b> low-level operations to medium/high-level operations means that the internal TIRRS {{is no longer in}} use. As the GR4A's internal sensors are no longer essential, the RAF's Tactical Reconnaissance Wing operate both GR4A and GR4 aircraft.|$|E
5|$|The newly hatched {{young of}} oviparous fish are called larvae. They are usually poorly formed, carry a large yolk sac (for nourishment), {{and are very}} {{different}} in appearance from juvenile and adult specimens. The larval period in oviparous fish is relatively short (usually only several weeks), and larvae rapidly grow and change appearance and structure (a process termed metamorphosis) to become juveniles. During this transition larvae must <b>switch</b> <b>from</b> their yolk sac to feeding on zooplankton prey, a process which depends on typically inadequate zooplankton density, starving many larvae.|$|E
5|$|Two earlier {{business}} decisions by the Chicago Sun-Times led to substantial savings {{of time and}} money during the Trump Tower's construction. The original 1950s sea wall was built by the newspaper company to bomb-shelter thickness, to withstand a Cold War attack, and thus {{did not have to be}} broken down and rebuilt. Furthermore, the company decided in the 1970s to <b>switch</b> <b>from</b> petroleum-based to soy-based ink, which reduced ground pollution from the printing plant. This considerably reduced the costs and time for cleaning up the site prior to building anew.|$|E

5|$|Changes in {{government}} approaches towards education {{meant that it}} was no longer regarded adequate for a child to leave education aged 14, as that is the age when they were seen to really understand and appreciate the value of education, as well as being the period when adolescence was at its height. It was beginning to be seen as the worst age for a sudden <b>switch</b> <b>from</b> education to employment, with around 80% of children in 1938 leaving education at this age, many having only had primary-school level education. Although there were concerns about the effects of having less labour from these children, it was hoped that the outcome of a larger quantity of more qualified, skilled workers would eliminate the deficit problem from the loss of unskilled labour.|$|E
5|$|Construction of {{the station}} was {{complicated}} {{by the need to}} keep the line open: trains ferrying materials were unable to stay on-site for long, and frequently had to <b>switch</b> <b>from</b> one track to the other, necessitating trips to nearby Montpelier railway station, where the nearest crossover points were located. The station finally opened on 12 April 1897. The first train was the 7am service: 94 tickets were issued to Clifton Down, and an estimated 550 passengers bought tickets from the station the same day. Some local writers were sceptical, claiming that many of those first day passengers were not new passengers, but would previously have travelled from Montpelier or Clifton Down. Construction took nine months, and cost £2,000.|$|E
5|$|Linezolid was {{discovered}} in the mid 1990s and was approved for commercial use in 2000. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, {{the most effective and}} safe medicines needed in a health system. Linezolid is available as a generic medication. The wholesale cost in the developing world is about US$ 2.90 USD per day while that in the United States as of 2016 is about US$13.79 per day. It appears to be more cost-effective than alternatives such as vancomycin, mostly because of the ability to <b>switch</b> <b>from</b> intravenous use to administration by mouth sooner.|$|E
