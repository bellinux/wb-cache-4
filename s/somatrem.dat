50|$|In 1990, the US Congress {{passed an}} omnibus crime bill, the Crime Control Act of 1990, that amended the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, that {{classified}} anabolic steroids as controlled substances {{and added a}} new section which reads:Prohibited distribution of human growth hormone.(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), whoever knowingly distributes, or possesses with intent to distribute, human growth hormone for any use in humans other than the treatment of a disease or other recognized medical condition, where such use has been authorized by the Secretary of Health and Human Services under section 355 of this title and pursuant {{to the order of}} a physician, is guilty of an offense punishable by not more than 5 years in prison, such fines as are authorized by title 18, or both.(2) Whoever commits any offense set forth in paragraph (1) and such offense involves an individual under 18 years of age is punishable by not more than 10 years imprisonment, such fines as are authorized by title 18, or both.(3) Any conviction for a violation of paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection shall be considered a felony violation of the Controlled Substances Act U.S.C. 801 et seq. for the purposes of forfeiture under section 413 of such Act U.S.C. 853.(4) As used in this subsection the term “human growth hormone” means <b>somatrem,</b> somatropin, or an analogue of either of them.(5) The Drug Enforcement Administration is authorized to investigate offenses punishable by this subsection.|$|E
40|$|In a {{multicentre}} {{clinical trial}} 54 children aged 4. 0 to 17. 3 years, who had growth hormone deficiency that had not previously been treated, were given biosynthetic methionyl growth hormone (<b>somatrem)</b> 4 units {{three times a week}} by subcutaneous or intramuscular injection for one year. Height was measured every three months for at least one year before and during treatment. Forty two patients responded to treatment with an increase in growth of greater than 1. 5 cm/year. The remaining 12 who grew more slowly were less obviously short and had a higher pretreatment growth than those who responded. The three who responded and the one who did not had undergone therapeutic spinal irradiation before starting the drug. If a whole year's pretreatment growth rate of less than 5 cm/year had been used as a diagnostic criterion the prediction of those who responded would have slightly improved. About two thirds of the patients developed antibodies against growth hormone and Escherichia coli protein; these were, however, of low and fluctuating titre and binding capacity, and did not influence the response to treatment. No adverse side effects were encountered. We conclude that <b>somatrem</b> is a safe and effective alternative to pituitary growth hormone...|$|E
40|$|Sixteen {{girls with}} Turner's {{syndrome}} aged 7. 9 - 15. 2 years (bone ages 7. 0 - 11. 8 years) were given methionyl growth hormone (<b>somatrem)</b> 4 IU/m 2 body surface daily, corresponding to 0. 9 IU/kg/week. During {{one year of}} treatment their mean (SD) height velocity increased from 3. 4 (0. 9) to 7. 2 (1. 7) cm/year and height prediction from 148. 2 (4. 4) to 150. 0 (4. 4) cm. All the girls except one had a height velocity increment of more than 2 cm/year and these velocities are above the age references for girls with Turner's syndrome. The girl with a low growth response had antibodies against growth hormone with high binding capacity (3. 7 U/l). The height velocity increment was inversely correlated with age and bone age, but this might be {{partly due to the}} somewhat higher dosage/m 2 body surface and kg body weight that the younger patients were given because of the rounding off of the dose. The better results of our study compared with those of other workers who used similar dosages but did not give the drug as often suggest that giving it daily might have increased the growth response as it does in children deficient in growth hormone...|$|E
40|$|The {{growth of}} 26 short normal prepubertal {{children}} (mean age 8. 4, height velocity standard deviation score for chronological age between + 0. 4 and - 0. 8) was studied for two years. Sixteen children {{were treated with}} <b>somatrem</b> (methionyl growth hormone) during the second year, and the remaining 10 children served as controls. During one year of treatment the height velocity standard deviation score for chronological age increased from the pretreatment mean of - 0. 44 (SD 0. 33) to + 2. 20 (1. 03). These values represented a change in height velocity from a pretreatment mean of 5. 3 cm/year (range 4. 6 - 6. 9) to 7. 4 cm/year (range 5. 7 - 9. 9). In the control group the height velocity standard deviation score was unchanged. Bone age advanced by 0. 75 (0. 33) years in the treated group compared with 0. 70 (0. 18) years in the control group. There was {{a significant increase in}} the height standard deviation score for bone age (0. 63 (0. 55] in the treated group. Multiple regression analysis of predictive factors contributing to the change in height velocity standard deviation score over the first year of treatment showed that the dose of growth hormone and pretreatment height velocity standard deviation score were important, together yielding a regression correlation coefficient of 0. 80. The only metabolic side effect of treatment was an increase in fasting insulin concentration, which may be an important mediator of the anabolic effects of growth hormone. Treatment had no effect on thyroid function, blood pressure, or glucose tolerance. At the end of the treatment year seven of the 16 treated children had developed antibodies to growth hormone, but they were present in low titre with low binding capacity and in no child was growth attenuated. Biosynthetic growth hormone improved the height velocity of children growing along or parallel to the third height centile, but the effects on height prognosis need to be assessed over a longer period...|$|E
