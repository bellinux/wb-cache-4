The structural <b>safety</b> <b>monitoring</b> method based on the monitoring data is widely used in traditional research. On the basis of the analysis of the high arch dam’s deformation principles, this study proposes a structural <b>safety</b> <b>monitoring</b> method derived from the dam deformation monitoring data. The method first analyzes and establishes the spatial and temporal distribution of high arch dam’s <b>safety</b> <b>monitoring,</b> overcoming the standard artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm’s shortcoming of easily falling into the local optimum by adopting the adaptive proportion and average Euclidean distance afterwards. The improved ABC algorithm is used to optimize the backpropagation (BP) neural network’s initial weight and threshold.

This mechanism is easy to implement and low-cost compared to other more theoretically based mechanisms such as Kalman filter.

The present Road <b>safety</b> <b>monitor</b> analyses the developments in 2011. The most important findings of this monitor are: 1. The overall trend in the number of road fatalities is still downward, although the number of road in 2011 (N = 661) is higher than in 2010. 2. The {{increase in the number of}} serious road injuries in recent years has continued in 2011. 3. Elderly road users and cyclists in particular have increasingly been involved in road crashes, both in fatal crashes and in crashes resulting in serious road injury. 4. The quality of a wide range of road safety data is deteriorating. In recent years, the Netherlands has underperformed in the area of road safety. More attention is required for the prevention of road crashes among elderly road users and cyclists and for quality improvement of road safety data.

Today, more and more batteries are connected in series with high voltage, {{if there is any}} fault in high voltage system (HVS), the consequence is serious and dangerous.
