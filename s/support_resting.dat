40|$|By {{drawing from}} {{theoretical}} perspectives suggesting that unfair conditions threaten fundamental psychological needs, perceived unfairness at work was proposed and tested {{as a predictor}} of resting blood pressure. As part of the Midlife Development in the United States Biomarkers project, participants completed questionnaires measuring perceived unfairness, self-esteem and coworker <b>support.</b> <b>Resting</b> blood pressure readings were also recorded {{as part of a larger}} physical examination. Results indicate that perceived unfairness at work was associated with higher resting diastolic and systolic blood pressure. Perceived unfairness was most strongly related to diastolic and systolic blood pressure among women with low levels of coworker support. Contrary to predictions, self-esteem did not moderate the association between perceived unfairness and blood pressure. These results suggest that high blood pressure may be a mechanism linking unfairness to negative health outcomes and point to coworker support as a moderator of the perceived unfairness–blood pressure relationship among women. Further research is needed exploring the mediating mechanisms linking unfair treatment at work to blood pressure and health. Copyright © 2013 Joh...|$|E
40|$|Neuroplasticity is a {{fundamental}} property {{of the nervous system}} that is maximal early in life, within the critical period [1 - 3]. Resting GABAergic inhibition is necessary to trigger ocular dominance plasticity and to modulate the onset and offset of the critical period [4, 5]. GABAergic inhibition also plays a crucial role in neuroplasticity of adult animals: the balance between excitation and inhibition in the primary visual cortex (V 1), measured at rest, modulates the susceptibility of ocular dominance to deprivation [6 - 10]. In adult humans, short-term monocular deprivation strongly modifies ocular balance, unexpectedly boosting the deprived eye, reflecting homeostatic plasticity [11, 12]. There is no direct evidence, however, to <b>support</b> <b>resting</b> GABAergic inhibition in homeostatic plasticity induced by visual deprivation. Here, we tested the hypothesis that GABAergic inhibition, measured at rest, is reduced by deprivation, as demonstrated by animal studies. GABA concentration in V 1 of adult humans was measured using ultra-high-field 7 T magnetic resonance spectroscopy before and after short-term monocular deprivation. After monocular deprivation, resting GABA concentration decreased in V 1 but was unaltered in a control parietal area. Importantly, across participants, the decrease in GABA strongly correlated with the deprived eye perceptual boost measured by binocular rivalry. Furthermore, after deprivation, GABA concentration measured during monocular stimulation correlated with the deprived eye dominance. We suggest that reduction in resting GABAergic inhibition triggers homeostatic plasticity in adult human V 1 after a brief period of abnormal visual experience. These results are potentially useful for developing new therapeutic strategies that could exploit the intrinsic residual plasticity of the adult human visual cortex...|$|E

40|$|This study {{examined}} whether activity {{is a contributing}} factor to motor terminal degeneration in mice that overexpress the G 93 A mutation of the SOD 1 enzyme found in humans with inherited motor neuron disease. Previously, we showed that overload of muscles accomplished by synergist denervation accelerated motor terminal degeneration in dogs with hereditary canine spinal muscular atrophy (HCSMA). In the present study, we found that SOD 1 plantaris muscles overloaded for 2 months showed no differences of neuromuscular junction innervation status when compared with normally loaded, contralateral plantaris muscles. Complete elimination of motor terminal activity using blockade of sciatic nerve conduction with tetrodotoxin cuffs for 1 month also produced no change of plantaris innervation status. To assess possible effects of activity on motor terminal function, we examined the synaptic properties of SOD 1 soleus neuromuscular junctions {{at a time when}} significant denervation of close synergists had occurred as a result of natural disease progression. When examined in glucose media, SOD 1 soleus synaptic properties were similar to wildtype. When glycolysis was inhibited and ATP production limited to mitochondria, however, blocking of evoked synaptic transmission occurred and a large increase in the frequency of spontaneous mEPCs was observed. Similar effects were observed at neuromuscular junctions in muscle from dogs with inherited motor neuron disease (HCSMA), although significant defects of synaptic transmission exist at these neuromuscular junctions when examined in glucose media, as reported previously. These results suggest that glycolysis compensates for mitochondrial dysfunction at motor terminals of SOD 1 mice and HCSMA dogs. This compensatory mechanism may help to <b>support</b> <b>resting</b> and activity-related metabolism in the presence of dysfunctional mitochondria and prolong the survival of SOD 1 motor terminals...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{use of the}} HeartMate II continuous-flow left {{ventricular}} assist device (LVAD) improves survival, {{quality of life and}} functional capacity of patients with advanced heart failure. However, no study so far has shown the benefits of these devices for cardiac function during peak exercise. OBJECTIVE: To assess cardiac and exercise performance in patients implanted with the HeartMate II LVAD under two settings: (i) optimal device support and (ii) reduced device support. METHODS: Twelve patients implanted with a HeartMate II LVAD performed a graded cardiopulmonary exercise test with respiratory gas exchange and non-invasive (rebreathing) haemodynamic measurements. After a 4 h resting period, patients performed an additional cardiopulmonary exercise test with reduced LVAD support (pump speed was reduced from optimal 9000 - 9600 to 6000 revs/min). RESULTS: In response to reduced HeartMate II LVAD <b>support,</b> <b>resting</b> cardiac power output and cardiac output decreased by 21 % and 13 %, respectively. Also at reduced device support, peak exercise cardiac power output was 39 % lower (1. 40 +/- 0. 50 vs 2. 31 +/- 0. 58 W; p< 0. 05), peak cardiac output 30 % lower (8. 6 +/- 2. 5 vs 12. 2 +/- 2. 1 l/min; p< 0. 05) and mean blood pressure 13 % lower (74. 3 +/- 14. 9 vs 85. 4 +/- 15. 4 vs mm Hg; p< 0. 05). Exercise capacity was also diminished with 23 % lower peak oxygen consumption (14. 1 +/- 5. 3 vs 18. 2 +/- 4. 5 ml/kg/min; p< 0. 05) and an 18 % shorter exercise duration (516 +/- 119 vs 628 +/- 192 s; p< 0. 05). CONCLUSION: It has been shown {{for the first time that}} the HeartMate II LVAD can confer both resting and peak cardiac functional benefits to patients with end-stage heart failure, thus improving exercise capacity...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to use A. V. Hill's {{equation}} describing diffusion of O 2 into cylindrical muscles to assess the adequacy of O 2 supply for commonly used isolated preparations of mammalian cardiac and skeletal muscles. The diffusion equation was solved numerically to give the maximum, steady state O 2 diffusion distances (i. e. the distance from the surface of the muscle to the radial location where dO 2 /dr is 0) for both resting and contracting muscles and for a range of temperatures. Non-steady state solutions for the rest-to-work transition were also determined to estimate how long contractile activity could be continued before anoxia develops at the muscle centre. The influence on muscle oxygenation of myoglobin-facilitated O 2 diffusion was also assessed. The analysis was performed for typical sized, whole muscles from adult rats and mice, for frog sartorius muscle and for a range of temperatures. Muscle O 2 consumption rates were taken from the literature. The results indicated that (1) diffusive O 2 supply would be adequate to <b>support</b> <b>resting</b> metabolism of soleus and EDL muscles of rat and mouse but may not be adequate to support the transient high resting metabolic rate of papillary muscles shortly after dissection, (2) during steady contractile activity of soleus and EDL muscles, particularly those from the rat, over a reasonable range of duty cycles, adequate O 2 supply could only be ensured if the radii of preparations was substantially smaller than those of whole muscles and (3) for cardiac muscles, diffusive O 2 supply could only support steady-state metabolism at twitch frequencies < 1 Hz for whole papillary muscles from rat and < 3 Hz for those from mouse. Reducing experimental temperature markedly enhances O 2 supply to skeletal, but not cardiac, muscle. O 2 supply from myoglobin had only minimal effects on oxygenation under typical isolated muscle conditions. Griffith Health, School of Rehabilitation SciencesNo Full Tex...|$|E
