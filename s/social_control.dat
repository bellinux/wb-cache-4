5|$|A <b>social</b> <b>control</b> {{program was}} {{implemented}} whereby local unions took on responsibility for ensuring that this quota was not exceeded; in doing so, {{they hoped to}} remove the need for military and police intervention, and thus stem the violence of previous decades. Measures were implemented to ensure the industrialization of coca production, with Morales inaugurating the first coca industrialization plant in Chulumani, which produced and packaged coca and trimate tea; the project was primarily funded through a $125,000 donation from Venezuela under the PTA scheme.|$|E

The first two were built to regulate these popular activities by centralizing them at a single venue, while the cemetery {{put an end to the}} practice of burials at churches which was considered unhealthy by public authorities.|$|E
5|$|In Suicide (1897), Durkheim {{explores the}} differing suicide rates among Protestants and Catholics, arguing that {{stronger}} <b>social</b> <b>control</b> among Catholics results in lower suicide rates. According to Durkheim, Catholic society has normal levels of integration while Protestant society has low levels. Overall, Durkheim treated suicide {{as a social}} fact, explaining variations in its rate on a macro level, considering society-scale phenomena such as lack of connections between people (group attachment) and lack of regulations of behavior, rather than individuals' feelings and motivations.|$|E
40|$|The role of {{informal}} <b>social</b> <b>controls</b> and their sanctions are still given little attention in crime prevention field. Some people still regard fighting and preventing crime {{as the work}} of the government and its agencies. This paper provides insight into the extent to which residents of Site B in Khayelitsha township take initiative to fight and prevent criminal activities in their area using informal <b>social</b> <b>controls.</b> Qualitative analysis was used to analyse the data collected from various categories of participants including ordinary residents, community police officers, community leaders and representatives of anti-crime organisations. Results indicate that the residents are reluctant to sanction offenders informally {{as a result of a}} high level of individualism among the residents. Some residents do not practise informal <b>social</b> <b>controls</b> because they fear to be arrested for sanctioning criminals and other offenders. This suggests that informal <b>social</b> <b>controls</b> conflict with formal sanctions rather than supporting and supplementing each other. However, individualism and lack of solidarity among residents of Site B were found to be the major cause of weak informal <b>social</b> <b>controls.</b> [URL]...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This article {{develops}} {{an evolutionary}} theory of conflict over {{the construction of}} culture that is informed by current knowledge of psychological mechanisms. Psychological mechanisms important {{for the production of}} culture include (1) general intelligence (including the ability to engender hypothetical scenarios and means-end reasoning necessary for constructing tools and other exemplars of technology); (2) explicit processing mechanisms (e. g., symbolic representations of the world). Explicit processing allows humans to regulate modular mechanisms in accordance with culturally constructed norms and culturally constructed cost/benefit payoff schedules. It also enables active attempts to construct culture in accordance with explicit perceptions of possible costs and benefits. Because people have different construals of {{the costs and benefits of}} particular forms of culture, there is conflict over the construction of culture. <b>Social</b> <b>controls</b> and ideologies are introduced as general cultural categories that are enabled by explicit processing and which are able to regulate and motivate behavior within particular historical contexts, at times in ways that conflict with evolved predispositions. Ideologies are often intimately intertwined with various <b>social</b> <b>controls</b> but are logically and psychologically independent from <b>social</b> <b>controls.</b> Ideologies typically rationalize extant <b>social</b> <b>controls</b> but they also benefit from the power of <b>social</b> <b>controls</b> to enforce ideological conformity in schools or in religious institutions. Because of the control of explicit processing over behavior, this theory predicts that conflicts over culture will often be intense. Discussion deals with the implications of this model for group selection, cultural transmission, gene-culture co-evolution, and the various types of conflicts of interest apparent in conflicts over the construction of culture...|$|R
5|$|Most churches {{used two}} acts to {{sanction}} its members: censure and excommunication. Censure was a formal reprimand for behavior {{that did not}} conform with accepted religious and social norms, while excommunication involved full removal from church membership. Many perceived social evils, from fornication to public drunkenness, were dealt with through church discipline rather than through civil punishment. Church sanctions seldom held official recognition outside church membership and seldom resulted in civil or criminal proceedings. Nevertheless, such sanctions were a powerful tool of <b>social</b> <b>control.</b>|$|E
5|$|Social {{hierarchy}} and tapu (sacred matters) in the Cook Islands {{was controlled by}} ariki (high chiefs), with typically between three and six per island. Each ariki was a ruler of an ivi or ngati (tribe). Lesser noble ranks in the social hierarchy were the mataiapo and rangatira (minor chiefs). The chief's control, which could neither be gained or lost, was established by his mana (power), which derived from his birth, achievements and status. However, an ariki with declining popularity could be perceived to be lacking in mana, which {{might lead to a}} loss of <b>social</b> <b>control.</b>|$|E
5|$|Arkwright's {{innovations}} {{were not}} confined to developing workers' settlements; he also had patents on many technologies used for water-powered spinning. They were so successful that rival industrialists risked legal action by copying his designs. His patents expired in 1785, and by 1788 over 200Arkwright type mills had been founded in Britain. New Lanark in Scotland– also a World Heritage Site– was directly influenced by Richard Arkwright and the developments in the Derwent Valley; Lanark {{was identified as a}} potential site for a mill on a visit by David Dale and Arkwright in 1784. Dale later established four mills at Lanark; they were structurally similar to Arkwright's Masson Mill and {{at least two of the}} mills used technology developed in the Derwent Valley, although the factory system was different from that used in the Derwent Valley. New Lanark was acquired by Robert Owen in 1799 who developed paternalism further than had been done in the Derwent Valley, experimenting with education for young and old and <b>social</b> <b>control.</b> Saltaire– another World Heritage Site– was founded in 1853 and featured worker's housing and facilities, as well as other elements of the factory system developed by Arkwright.|$|E
40|$|Abstract There {{is strong}} {{evidence}} that focussing police resources at ‘crime hot spots’—small geographic places at which crime is concentrated—is an effective crime control strategy. Generally, hot spots policing strategies focus on formal <b>social</b> <b>controls</b> such as police crackdowns and often ignore {{the social context of}} the places that are targeted. Our article describes an approach that recognizes the importance of police community collaboration to improve public safety and reinforce informal <b>social</b> <b>controls,</b> and the emerging empirical evidence that social disorganization and collective efficacy may influence crime patterns at the micro-geographic level. We argue for the relevance of informal <b>social</b> <b>controls</b> in place-based policing and describe an innovative Smart Policing collaboration between the Brooklyn Park (Minnesota) Police Department and the Center for Evidence-Based Crime Policy at George Mason University that implements a department-wide programme in which police lead interventions to increase collective efficacy in hot spots...|$|R

This study explores some fundamental aspects of pastoralist settlement and social systems as they developed following the Bronze Age. The analysis uses the agent-based computational model, HouseholdsWorld, to simulate aspects of mobility, population density, kinship structures, and herd dynamics relating to emerging social territories and the implications for sustainable landscape use. Comparisons with archaeological data show the potential impacts of <b>social</b> <b>controls</b> on habitation distributions and mobility. When overarching <b>social</b> <b>controls</b> were in place distinctive territorial differences emerged.   When <b>social</b> <b>controls</b> were less centralized individual households became wealthier.   In regions with dense populations, expanding the scope of landscape knowledge allowed micro-mobility to effectively mitigate social restrictions.   As a result population expanded, but became poorer.   In less densely inhabited regions greater knowledge of the landscape expanded the mid-range of wealth distribution without expanding the number of poor...|$|R

5|$|In 1928, the {{gendarmerie}} was reorganized as the Garde d'Haïti {{and became}} the nucleus of what would eventually evolve into the reconstituted Haitian army. The later politicization of the Haitian military has been attributed by some to Haiti's early experience with the Gendarmerie d'Haïti. The gendarmerie's special access to U.S. resources and influence vested in it a measure of <b>social</b> <b>control</b> within Haiti that would become institutionalized in later years. On the other hand, former Haitian President Prosper Avril has observed that Haiti already had {{a long tradition of}} military involvement in government prior to the occupation, with 25 of its 26 pre-occupation presidents being either military officers or leaders of rebel groups. Avrill also contends the gendarmerie worked to instill a respect for political neutrality in its men.|$|E
5|$|Racial {{violence}} {{at the time}} was common throughout the nation, manifested as individual incidents of extra-legal actions, or attacks on entire communities. Lynchings reached a peak around the start of the 20th century as southern states were disenfranchising black voters and imposing white supremacy; white supremacists used it as a means of <b>social</b> <b>control</b> throughout the South. In 1866 Florida, as did many Southern states, passed laws called Black Codes disenfranchising black citizens. Although these were quickly overturned, and black citizens enjoyed a brief period of improved social standing, by the late 19th century black political influence was virtually nil. The white Democrat-dominated legislature passed a poll tax in 1885, which largely served to disenfranchise all poor voters. Losing political power, black voters suffered a deterioration of their legal and political rights in the years following. Without the right to vote, they were excluded as jurors and could not run for office, effectively excluding them from the political process. The United States as a whole was experiencing rapid social changes: an influx of European immigrants, industrialization and the growth of cities, and political experimentation in the North. In the South, black Americans grew increasingly dissatisfied with their lack of economic opportunity and status as second-class citizens.|$|E
