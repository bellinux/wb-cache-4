50|$|Bearings with {{a flange}} {{on the outer}} ring simplify axial location. The housing for such {{bearings}} can consist of a through-hole of uniform diameter, but the entry face of the housing (which may be either the outer or inner face) must be machined truly normal to the hole axis. However such flanges are very expensive to manufacture.A more cost effective arrangement of the bearing outer ring, with similar benefits, is a <b>snap</b> <b>ring</b> <b>groove</b> at either or {{both ends of the}} outside diameter. The snap ring assumes the function of a flange.|$|E
50|$|Now, if one {{positions}} {{the snap}} ring with its flat side {{such that it}} is pushed into the rounded edge of the <b>snap</b> <b>ring</b> <b>groove</b> when load or force is applied, the flat and square edge of the snap ring will “bite” into the rounded edge of the retaining groove and as more force is applied the snap ring will distort as it rides up the rounded edge. This distortion will spread an external snap ring or compress an internal snap ring, leaving it prone to possibly being forced from the groove and releasing the part {{it is designed to}} hold.See the accompanying pictures as to how this works and how to properly orient the snap ring in the groove.|$|E
50|$|This {{is because}} no {{machined}} groove can {{or should be}} machined with perfectly square edges, as a perfect 90-degree square edge would constitute a stress riser and subject the shaft or part to cracking at that edge. Hence, <b>snap</b> <b>ring</b> <b>grooves</b> are always machined with their edges slightly (however microscopically) rounded.|$|R

40|$|The Defense Waste Processing Facility (DWPF) {{requested}} the Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) to develop tooling {{and equipment to}} remotely replace gaskets in mechanical Hanford connectors to reduce personnel radiation exposure {{as compared to the}} current hands-on method. It is also expected that radiation levels will continually increase with future waste streams. The equipment is operated in the Remote Equipment Decontamination Cell (REDC), which is equipped with compressed air, two master-slave manipulators (MSM's) and an electro-mechanical manipulator (EMM) arm for operation of the remote tools. The REDC does not provide access to electrical power, so the equipment must be manually or pneumatically operated. The MSM's have a load limit at full extension of ten pounds, which limited the weight of the installation tool. In order to remotely replace Hanford connector gaskets several operations must be performed remotely, these include: removal of the spent gasket and retaining ring (retaining ring is also called <b>snap</b> <b>ring),</b> loading the new <b>snap</b> <b>ring</b> and gasket into the installation tool and installation of the new gasket into the Hanford connector. SRNL developed and tested tools that successfully perform all of the necessary tasks. Removal of <b>snap</b> <b>rings</b> from horizontal and vertical connectors is performed by separate air actuated retaining ring removal tools and is manipulated in the cell by the MSM. In order install a new gasket, the <b>snap</b> <b>ring</b> loader is used to load a new <b>snap</b> <b>ring</b> into a <b>groove</b> in the gasket installation tool. A new gasket is placed on the installation tool and retained by custom springs. An MSM lifts the installation tool and presses the mounted gasket against the connector block. Once the installation tool is in position, the gasket and <b>snap</b> <b>ring</b> are installed onto the connector by pneumatic actuation. All of the tools are located on a custom work table with a pneumatic valve station that directs compressed air to the desired tool and vents the tools as needed. Extensive testing of tooling operation was performed in the DWPF manipulator repair shop. This testing allowed the operators to gain confidence before the equipment was exposed to radioactive contamination. The testing also led to multiple design improvements. On July 17 and 29, 2008 the Remote Gasket Replacement Tooling was successfully demonstrated in the REDC at the DWPF of The Savannah River Site...|$|R
40|$|A <b>ring</b> <b>groove</b> {{arrangement}} is proposed to suppress unstable flow or surge in a centrifugal blower. The <b>ring</b> <b>groove</b> arrangement connects the upstream position of impeller inlet and the inducer throat tip through a bypass. The recirculation flow {{was formed by}} the pressure {{difference between the two}} positions, and the recirculation flow rate was changed by increasing the <b>ring</b> <b>groove</b> widths. The inlet recirculation results in a decrease in the flow rate of unstable flow inception, and an up to 8 % improvement in stall limit was obtained by the <b>ring</b> <b>groove</b> arrangement at a small expense of the delivery pressure drop. The improvement of stall limit in the present experiment seems to be mainly due to decrease in flow incidence based on the inlet recirculation flow. Tre flow incidence decreases more as the recirculation flow rate increases, thus resulting in a larger improvement in stall limit...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The three {{dimensional}} {{model was}} established for studying performance of spiral groove gas face seal. According to machining features of different surface area, the seal face {{can be divided}} into three parts, rotor <b>ring</b> <b>grooved</b> area, rotor <b>ring</b> non-grooved area and static ring area. The effect of roughness on seal performance was analyzed based on calculation of three dimensional flow field. The analysis results show that the surface roughness of rotor <b>ring</b> <b>grooved</b> area has great influence on the seal performance, but the influence is little when roughness on non-grooved rotor ring surface and static ring surface. The influence must be considered when surface roughness of rotor <b>ring</b> <b>grooved</b> area bigger than 0. 2 µm. Roughness of rotor ring surface can increase the loading force while it also can cause the increase of leakage. It is important to select rational roughness when designing gas face seal...|$|R

40|$|A {{high-pressure}} {{ratio and}} a wide operating range are highly required for a turbocharger in diesel engines. Ring groove arrangement is effective for flow range enhancement of centrifugal compressors. Two <b>ring</b> <b>grooves</b> on the suction pipe and the shroud casing wall are connected {{by means of the}} annular passage, and the stable recirculation flow is formed at small flow rates from the downstream groove toward the upstream groove through the annular bypass. It is well known that the <b>ring</b> <b>groove</b> arrangement shows the following two merits; (1) the formation of recirculation flow removes the low energy fluid around the downstream groove located near the splitter blade leading edge, (2) the flow incidence can be reduced because the recirculation flow merges again with the incoming main flow upstream of the impeller inlet. In the present study, the <b>ring</b> <b>groove</b> arrangement was applied to the high speed centrifugal compressor, in addition, in order to suppress too large pre-whirl due to the recirculation flow, the effects of guide vane installed in th...|$|R

40|$|Failures in {{reciprocating}} {{internal combustion}} engines operating with landfill gas are not uncommon. In general, damage {{is located in}} the combustion chamber surfaces and in the <b>ring</b> <b>grooves,</b> where a layer of non-volatile combustion products is deposited. These deposits attached to the surfaces reduce heat transfer and increase inner temperature, which produces a knocking phenomena damaging the crank bearings and fusing of the piston head material. Lubrication problems also appear due to the formation of a layer of soft paste silicone deposits in the <b>rings</b> <b>grooves,</b> which increases friction losses and accelerates wear on cylinder and rings. In this paper, some typical examples of damaged engines are presented. The deposits found were analysed using Scanning Electron Microscope and Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (SEM–-EDX). Additionally, the engine oil used was also analysed by Infra-Red Spectrometry (IR) and the results were compared with known organo-compounds. A method to detect incipient failure caused by organo-compounds contained in landfill gas is introduced.
