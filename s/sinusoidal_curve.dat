The leaves are made with mosaic technique, the trunk instead is made with pieces of marble. The tree is a thick figure of symbolic meanings: it refers to life that transcends time and space. The tree has the truck {{on the surface of}} the earth, the roots in the ground and the branches in the sky. This symbolically takes up the salvation-historical time path from the Creation to the coming of Christ, with the intent of making the entrance-altar journey as a passage from darkness to light. Teruzzi was assisted by Luigi Beretta in the collection of biblical references. Along the tree-trunk are represented the stages of the history of salvation. Each stage or day of history is marked by a stone. At the base appears a continuous line, without interruption, in dark colors and dotted with tiny bright flashes (few golden mosaic tiles). It represents the primordial chaos which preceded the Creation, when the earth was a formless void and darkness covered the abyss (in black tiles), but already the spirit (in clear tiles) hovered over the waters (Gen[...] 1:29). The creation is marked by stones 7, numbered from 1 to 7 with simple marble tiles, and they are one for each day. On each of them it is represent the work of God in that day as written in Genesis. After the Creation are remembered the 10 generations Cycle from Adam to Noah and 10 generations from Noah to Abraham. Each group is made with different shades of color of the marble tiles, on which there are marked at the most salient character names from which generations are named.

40|$|Knowledge {{transfer}} is computationally challenging, {{due in part}} to the curse of dimensionality, compounded by source and target domains expressed using different features (e. g., documents written in different languages). Recent work on manifold learning has shown that data collected in real-world settings often have high-dimensional representations, but lie on low-dimensional manifolds. Furthermore, data sets collected from similar generating processes often present different high-dimensional views, even though their underlying manifolds are similar. The ability to align these data sets and extract this common structure is critical for many transfer learning tasks. In this paper, we present a novel framework for aligning two sequentially-ordered data sets, taking advantage of a shared low-dimensional manifold representation. Our approach combines traditional manifold alignment and dynamic time warping algorithms using alternating projections. We also show that the previously-proposed canonical time warping algorithm is a special case of our approach. We provide a theoretical formulation as well as experimental results on synthetic and real-world data, comparing manifold warping to other alignment methods.
