40|$|The {{fundamental}} question in speech compression {{is that of}} determining the minimum information rate that must be maintained between speaker and listener {{in order to achieve}} a specified level of <b>speech</b> <b>fidelity</b> or quality. The problem in answering this question is that a measure of speech quality must first be defined. Any meaningful definition of speech quality clearly must con-sider the manner in which speech is processed by the listener. If the details of the signal processing in the auditory system were known, speech quality could be defined in terms of the sensitivity of the listener to distortions of signals within the auditory system. A study of the manner in which sounds are processed by the human audi-tory system was done to provide the basic information to define a measure of <b>speech</b> <b>fidelity.</b> The mechanical or sound-conducting parts of the auditory system are reasonably well understood and can be considered as linear sys-tems in an engineering sense. The neural processing of the peripheral audi-tory system is only partly understood. Further experimental work augmented with computer simulation of neural models is necessary to fully understand the nature of the neural data processing. Accepted for the Air Forc...|$|E

International audienceUsing the Bayesian {{networks}} framework, {{we present}} a new multi-band approach for continuous speech recognition.

Moreover, it leads to a higher <b>fidelity</b> <b>speech</b> modeling than HMMs. We provide a preliminary evaluation of the performance of our new approach on a connected digits recognition task...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} an extensive {{study of the}} short time spectrum analysis-synthesis of speech. This type of speech processing attempts to synthesize speech without the short time Fourier transform phase information. Several existing analysis-synthesis methods are presented. In addition, five other methods are attempted experimentally. The results of these experiments are explained, identifying some very important properties of the short time spectrum analysis-synthesis. One of the methods was shown to synthesize a high <b>fidelity</b> <b>speech.</b> Finally, a comparison is made between this method and other known methods {{which are based on}} short time Fourier transform approach...|$|R
500|$|Nellie Bertram (Catherine Tate) assigns Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) and Pete Miller (Jake Lacy) to {{a social}} media project that meets with some success. She notices the two flirting {{with each other for}} the first time and assumes that she brought it on with the project, citing several unintentional double entendres in her project e-mails. She feels guilty because Erin is Andy Bernard's (Ed Helms) girlfriend and Andy {{recommended}} Nellie to the adoption agency, and is afraid that Andy will fire her when he finds out. She hijacks Dwight's customer loyalty meeting to talk about fidelity in relationships, which soon zeroes in on Erin and Pete. Nellie also ends the social media project so they will not be able to flirt. Shamed by Nellie's <b>fidelity</b> <b>speech,</b> Erin assumes a coldly professional attitude towards Pete. However, a talk with Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) reminds Nellie that Andy was not the best boyfriend to Erin and Nellie has second thoughts. She soon restarts the project, [...] "forcing" [...] Erin and Pete to work together again, much to their delight.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} blind source separation (BSS) {{problem of}} multiple speech signals in low signal-to-interference-noise ratio (SINR) environment. We consider an over-determined case {{so that we}} can form multiple sub-arrays (of which there are as many sensors as speech signals), and propose a novel hybrid scheme to obtain high <b>fidelity</b> <b>speech</b> signals after separation. Firstly, the proposed method applies the commonly-used BSS technique at each sub-array to separate the speech signals. Next, the outputs of the same speech signal from different sub-arrays are grouped to form a new subarray. We can then exploit the spatial diversity of the new sub-array to achieve high fidelity source separation. This configuration is the key innovation of this paper. Another contribution of the paper is on the justification of using the hybrid configuration to further increase the output SINR. From numerical analysis, it is demonstrated that 12 dB SINR improvement can be achieved using 5 -element sensor array in the presence of two other interfering speech signals over a range of input SNR values. A significant improvement can also be seen from the output signal-to-artifact ratio (SAR) of the recovered signals. 1...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT We {{present a}} new {{continuous}} {{automatic speech recognition}} system where no a priori assumptions on the dependencies between the observed and the hidden speech processes are made. Rather, dependencies are learned form data using the Bayesian networks formalism. This approach guaranties to improve modelling fidelity as compared to HMMs. Furthermore, our approach is technically very attractive because all the computational effort {{is made in the}} training phase. 1 INTRODUCTION First order Hidden Markov Models (HMM) are the most commonly used stochastic models in speech recognition. They are defined with a set of imposed conditional independence assumptions. Indeed, the observations are assumed to be governed by a hidden (unobserved) dynamic process. The associated independence assumptions state that the hidden process is first-order Markov, and each observation depends only on the current hidden variable. There is, however, a fundamental question regarding these dependency assumptions: are they realistic hypothesis for any kind of speech recognition task? In [1], we proposed a methodology in which we do not make any a priori dependency assumptions. Rather, we give data a complete (but controlled) freedom to dictate the appropriate dependencies. In other words, we learn the dependencies between (hidden and observable) variables from data. The principle of this methodology is to search over all the possible "realistic " dependencies, and to chose the ones which best explain the data. This approach has the advantage to guaranty that the resulting model represents <b>speech</b> with higher <b>fidelity</b> than HMMs. Moreover, a control is given to the user to make a trade-off between modeling accuracy and model complexity. In addition, the approach is technically very attractive because all the computational effort is made in the training phase...|$|R
40|$|Background: Unexplained chronic cough (UCC) causes {{significant}} {{impairments in}} quality of life. Effective assessment and treatment approaches {{are needed for}} UCC. Methods: This systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) asked: What is the efficacy of treatment compared with usual care for cough severity, cough frequency, and cough-related {{quality of life in}} patients with UCC? Studies of adults and adolescents aged > 12 years with a chronic cough of > 8 weeks' duration that was unexplained after systematic investigation and treatment were included and assessed for relevance and quality. Based on the systematic review, guideline suggestions were developed and voted on by using the American College of Chest Physicians organization methodology. Results: Eleven RCTs and five systematic reviews were included. The 11 RCTs reported data on 570 participants with chronic cough who received a variety of interventions. Study quality was high in 10 RCTs. The studies used an assortment of descriptors and assessments to identify UCC. Although gabapentin and morphine exhibited positive effects on cough-related quality of life, only gabapentin was supported as a treatment recommendation. Studies of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) were affected by intervention fidelity bias; when this factor was addressed, ICS were found to be ineffective for UCC. Esomeprazole was ineffective for UCC without features of gastroesophageal acid reflux. Studies addressing nonacid gastroesophageal reflux disease were not identified. A multimodality speech pathology intervention improved cough severity. Conclusions: The evidence supporting the diagnosis and management of UCC is limited. UCC requires further study to establish agreed terminology and the optimal methods of investigation using established criteria for intervention <b>fidelity.</b> <b>Speech</b> pathology-based cough suppression is suggested as a treatment option for UCC. This guideline presents suggestions for diagnosis and treatment based on the best available evidence and identifies gaps in our knowledge as well as areas for future research...|$|R
