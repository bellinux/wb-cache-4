2500|$|One of {{the major}} {{segments}} of Top Gear, [...] "Car Reviews" [...] focuses on the presenters conducting a road-test of a car, looking at such factors as ride quality, speed, handling, practicality, and reliability. Their reviews are either conducted on and around Top Gears test track, or on the roads of Britain and abroad. Such reviews often focus on one car, primarily from well known car manufactures, though occasionally can feature more than one car, can include exotic or foreign cars, and sometimes involving multiple presenters, who compare those being reviewed while voicing arguments about which should be considered worthwhile to own. Although the programme operated in a <b>standard</b> <b>manner</b> in the early series, Top Gear later adopted an approach of reviewing cars, by conducting an unusual test(s) to either put a vehicle through its paces in an arranged scenario, or to demonstrate and showcase an exceptional quality that it exhibited.|$|E

30|$|Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) {{systems have}} the {{potential}} to provide the capacity needed for future-generation wireless systems, and for this reason they have been adopted by 3 GPP Long-Term Evolution (LTE) and LTE-Advanced (LTE-A) [1, 2]. MIMO operation was already defined in the early stage of LTE specification work. In the downlink, 2 Ã— 2 and 4 Ã— 4 MIMO operation have been defined in Release 8 [3], and these have been further extended to 8 Ã— 8 MIMO in Release 10 [2]. The main scenario is single-user (SU)-MIMO, where spatial multiplexing within individual time-frequency resource blocks is performed for a single user equipment (UE) at a time. In addition, multi-user (MU)-MIMO operation, where a time-frequency resource block is shared by multiple users in the spatial domain, has been possible since Release 8. In LTE Release 8, MU-MIMO is allowed only in a <b>standard</b> non-transparent <b>manner,</b> but in LTE Release 9 and 10 it can be enabled in a <b>standard</b> transparent <b>manner.</b> In Release 10, certain features have been included to improve the MU-MIMO performance compared to Release 8. One such feature is a user-specific reference signal (RS) that makes it possible to suppress MU interference with a linear receiver.|$|R
