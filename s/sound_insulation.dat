40|$|Laboratory {{measurements}} {{were made of}} the <b>sound</b> <b>insulations</b> and absorption coefficients {{of a range of}} metal-framed partitions having built-in acoustic treatment. The partitions were made using glass wool and gypsum boards. The <b>sound</b> <b>insulations</b> of the single leaf partitions having built-in acoustic treatment were considerably lower than those of comparable partitions made using mineral wool, gypsum boards and fibreboard. For the double leaf partition having built-in acoustic treatment, the <b>sound</b> <b>insulations</b> were, on average, 8 dB higher than those of the comparable partitions containing mineral wool. The use of the new double and triple leaf partitions containing built-in acoustic treatment should result in similar savings of floor areas to those obtained by using the partitions containing mineral wool as built-in acoustic treatment. However, {{it should be possible to}} obtain a flatter reverberation time curve using the new partitions and the <b>sound</b> <b>insulations</b> should be higher, provided that double leaf partitions are used.

25|$|A few {{suspension}} refinements {{were made}} for 1964. The front coil springs were changed from constant-rate to progressive or variable-rate and were more tightly wound at the top, while leaf thickness of the rear transverse spring was also altered thus providing a more comfortable ride with no sacrifice in handling. Shock absorbers were reworked toward the same end. The 1964 Corvette arrived with a new standard shock containing within its fluid reservoir a small bag of Freon gas that absorbed heat. Chevy added more <b>sound</b> <b>insulation</b> and revised body and transmission mounts for the 1964 Corvette. It also fitted additional bushings to quiet the shift linkage and placed a new boot around the lever. The result was a more livable car for everyday transportation.|$|E

A fast-moving fire with intense black smoke engulfed the club in 5½ minutes. Video footage of the fire shows its ignition, rapid growth, the billowing smoke that quickly made escape impossible, and the exit blockage that further hindered evacuation.

25|$|Due {{in part to}} {{the impact}} of {{aircraft}} noise on south Minneapolis and surrounding suburbs, Northwest Airlines and others had proposed moving out of MSP and building a new airport on the fringes of the Twin Cities metro area to handle more large jets and more international traffic. Minneapolis and other neighboring cities were concerned that such a move would have a negative economic impact, so an arrangement was made where the Metropolitan Airports Commission would outfit many homes {{in the vicinity of the}} airport with <b>sound</b> <b>insulation</b> and air conditioning so that indoor noise could be reduced. A citizen group named ROAR (Residents Opposed to Airport Racket) was created in 1998 and helped push the MAC to make these concessions. Later, in 2004, the MAC voted to reduce funding for the soundproofing projects, stating in part that the economic climate had turned in the wake of the September 11, 2001 attacks. Minneapolis Mayor R. T. Rybak, who had been a founding member of ROAR, promised that the city would challenge the funding changes.|$|E

500|$|A {{provision}} of the original Civil Aviation Act allows designated airports to be required to provide facilities for consultation with affected parties, where local environmental concerns can be raised, and some 51 airports have been so designated. A 2000 consultation by the government re-iterated its policy that generally, local issues arising from airport operations are best addressed locally. To support this the Civil Aviation Act was extended in 2006 to give all airports the authority to mandate measures to address noise and air quality issues beyond their boundaries, and to impose financial penalties on aircraft which fail or are unable to adhere to such measures. The Civil Aviation Act 2006 also extends the provisions of section 78 of the original act, augmenting {{the powers of the}} Secretary of State to intervene directly in operations at designated airports; currently Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted, [...] "…for the purpose of avoiding, limiting or mitigating the effect of noise and vibration connected with aircraft landing or taking off." [...] The largest airports also implement voluntary schemes to assist local communities in coping with the local impacts of airport operations. Birmingham International Airport, for example, has been operating a <b>sound</b> <b>insulation</b> scheme since 1978, in which 7,600 properties are eligible for sound proof glazing paid for by the airport. Schemes are also available to residents most affected by noise around Heathrow, designed to protect property prices ahead of any development of a third runway, assist with relocation costs for people who wish to move, and provide <b>sound</b> <b>insulation</b> for private and communal property currently affected by noise. In both cases local residents have also set up campaign groups; Birmingham Airport anti-Noise Group, and HACAN Clearskies at Heathrow, to represent themselves over local environmental issues arising from airport operations. Even the smallest of airports engaged in air transport operations; Gloucestershire Airport, has attracted organised opposition to its plans to extend the main runway there, and the umbrella group AirportWatch lists over 20 local airport campaign groups.|$|E

40|$|It is {{important}} for a fisheries research vessel to reduce the underwater-radiated noise. In 1995, the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) firstly recommended the maximum noise level for research vessels to ensure the acoustic research works and to prevent the fish reaction against the noise 1). Since then, {{it has been the}} world standard for the design of fisheries research vessels. For a small size vessel, however, {{it is very difficult to}} achieve the recommendations because of not enough space or capacity to make <b>sound</b> <b>insulations.</b> Moreover, the Froude number (Fn) of such small vessels tends to be higher than that of the larger vessels. Since the higher Froude number of the operating condition causes the large wave-making resistance, both propeller thrust and occurrence of cavitation increase, which tends to result in the higher level of underwater-radiated noise. Meanwhile, the fisheries research-cost can be reduced by using a small vessel, because not only the construction and operation cost, but also maintenance cost become lower than those of a large vessel. It would be desirable and efficient if a small vessel could satisfy the ICES's recommendation in place of a large research vessel. In this paper, the authors propose a design method for a small research vessel to reduce the underwater-radiated noise level. Utilizing this method, a small fisheries research vessel whose capacity is 290 GT and length is 33. 5 m has been designed. From the sea trials after the construction, it has been proved successfully that the underwaterradiated noise level is the world lowest class at 10 knots (Fn= 0. 28) of researching speed and still satisfies the ICES's recommendation even in 11. 6 knots (Fn= 0. 33) of the high-speed region...|$|R
