It is an important problem of micromeritics to ascertain what <b>sample</b> <b>divider</b> should be used to obtain true informations of given particles. 　A new type of <b>sample</b> <b>divider</b> for particles, which applies an uniformity of particle concentration in the fluidized bed, has been originated by us. The structure of this ample divider is shown in Figs 1, 2 and 3.

30|$|The {{soil was}} mixed with {{different}} amounts {{of sewage sludge}} and biowaste to vary the carbon content and the resulting redox conditions in the sample (see Table  2). The sewage sludge originates from the WWTP Wassmannsdorf (near Berlin, Germany) and was sampled in November 2011. The biowaste was obtained from a commercial company and presents compost produced from fermentation of plant garbage in a treatment plant in Saxony-Anhalt, Germany. Both materials were air-dried and sieved to a particle size < 2  mm. The Cd pigments were suspended in water and 100  g of sewage sludge and 200  g soil, respectively, was added while stirring the suspension. While this mixture was air-dried, it was mixed regularly until the solid was dry enough for further processing. The spiked sludge and soil were mixed with soil, sludge, and biowaste to achieve mixtures according to Table  2. All mixtures were homogenized using a gyro wheel mixer (Engelsmann, Ludwigshafen, Germany) for 2  h and subdivided using an automated <b>sample</b> <b>divider</b> (Retsch, Haan, Germany).|$|E

40|$|AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Human {{pancreatic}} beta cells may be {{complicit in}} their own demise in type 1 diabetes, but how this occurs remains unclear. One potentially contributing factor is hyperexpression of HLA class I antigens. This was first described approximately 30  years ago, but has never been fully characterised and was recently challenged as artefactual. Therefore, we investigated HLA class I expression at the protein and RNA levels in pancreases from three cohorts of patients with type 1 diabetes. The principal aims were to consider whether HLA class I hyperexpression is artefactual and, if not, to determine the factors driving it. METHODS: Pancreas samples from type 1 diabetes patients with residual insulin-containing islets (n[*]=[*] 26) from the Network for Pancreatic Organ donors with Diabetes (nPOD), Diabetes Virus Detection study (DiViD) and UK recent-onset type 1 diabetes collections were immunostained for HLA class I isoforms, signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT 1), NLR family CARD domain containing 5 (NLRC 5) and islet hormones. RNA was extracted from islets isolated by laser-capture microdissection from nPOD and <b>DiViD</b> <b>samples</b> and analysed using gene-expression arrays. RESULTS: Hyperexpression of HLA class I was observed in the insulin-containing islets of type 1 diabetes patients from all three tissue collections, and was confirmed at both the RNA and protein levels. The expression of β 2 -microglobulin (a second component required for the generation of functional HLA class I complexes) was also elevated. Both 'classical' HLA class I isoforms (i. e. HLA-ABC) {{as well as a}} 'non-classical' HLA molecule, HLA-F, were hyperexpressed in insulin-containing islets. This hyperexpression did not correlate with detectable upregulation of the transcriptional regulator NLRC 5. However, it was strongly associated with increased STAT 1 expression in all three cohorts. Islet hyperexpression of HLA class I molecules occurred in the insulin-containing islets of patients with recent-onset type 1 diabetes and was also detectable in many patients with disease duration of up to 11  years, declining thereafter. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Islet cell HLA class I hyperexpression is not an artefact, but is a hallmark in the immunopathogenesis of type 1 diabetes. The response is closely associated with elevated expression of STAT 1 and, together, these occur uniquely in patients with type 1 diabetes, thereby contributing to their selective susceptibility to autoimmune-mediated destruction.

40|$|In this paper, a novel unequal {{broadband}} out-of-phase {{power divider}} (PD) is presented. Double-sided parallel-strip lines (DSPSLs) are employed {{to achieve an}} out-of-phase response. Also, an asymmetric dual-band matching structure with two external isolation resistors is utilized to obtain arbitrary unequal power division, in which the resistors are directly grounded for heat sinking. A through ground via (TGV), connecting {{the top and bottom}} sides of the DSPSLs, is used to short the isolation components. Additionally, this property can efficiently improve the broadband matching and isolation bandwidths. To investigate the proposed divider in detail, a set of design equations are derived based on the circuit theory and transmission line theory. The theoretical analysis shows that broadband responses can be obtained as proper frequency ratios are adopted. To verify the proposed concept, a <b>sample</b> <b>divider</b> with a power division of 2 : 1 is demonstrated. The measured results exhibit a broad bandwidth from 1. 19 GHz to 2. 19 GHz (59. 2 %) with a return loss better than 10 dB and port isolation of 18 dB...|$|E
30|$|Sixty {{samples were}} {{processed}} for coccolith analysis (at ~[*] 3  m intervals). Sediment samples were freeze-dried and prepared following combined dilution and filtering (Andruleit 1996), which enabled {{estimates of the}} absolute numbers of coccoliths per gram of dry sediment. Between 61 and 129  mg of dry bulk sediment was suspended in buffered water and treated ultrasonically for ~[*] 30  s. Samples were wet-split using a rotary <b>sample</b> <b>divider,</b> and 1 / 100 of the original solution was filtered through polycarbonate filters (0.45  μm pore size) with a vacuum pump. The filters were dried in an oven at ~[*] 40  °C for at least 24  h and stored. A small part of each filter was cut out, fixed on an aluminum stub, and sputtered with gold/palladium. Following a counting routine, a minimum of 400 coccoliths per sample were identified and classified under SEM at ×[*] 3000 magnification. However, in a few cases, this minimum number was not reached. Identification of coccoliths followed Young et al. (2003) and the electronic guide Nannotax 3 ([URL] TWC indicators included the taxa Calcidiscus leptoporus, Gephyrocapsa oceanica, and Helicosphaera carteri (Muza 1992).|$|E
40|$|Quality of {{oat flakes}} is {{dependent}} on end-use. Specific weight is used to steer the flaking process, and is important in ensuring that the correct pack weight is achieved. It is also related to flake thickness. Flake thickness in turn may affect other quality parameters such as water absorption, colour and breakage of the flakes. The {{aim of this study}} was to describe the effect of specific weight on the quality parameters of oat flakes. Oat flakes were prepared from locally grown oats by a commercial mill. Five flake thickness levels were obtained by adjusting the gap between the rolls. According to usual practice, specific weight was used as an indicator of thickness. For determination of moisture content and pasting properties, samples were ground using a pin mill and cyclone mill. Thickness was measured from 10 randomly selected flakes. Moisture content was determined by air-drying. Water absorption was determined by weighing 50 g of flakes into a beaker and adding 200 ml of water at 24 °C. After 5 min the mixture was spread over a pre-weighed 0. 85 mm screen, tilted at 28 ° from the horizontal and allowed to drain. Flake colour was measured with a tri-stimulus instrument. Flake size distribution was measured using 5 and 2. 5 mm round-holed sieves, from a representative sample obtained with a <b>sample</b> <b>divider.</b> Pasting properties were measured using a Rapid Viscoanalyzer. There was a positive correlation between specific weight and flake thickness. Specific weight showed strong negative correlations with water absorption and the peak viscosity of flakes ground in a pin mill, however there were no significant difference between finely ground flakes, which suggests differences in the particle size distribution or extractability of starch. Thin flakes were whiter. The relationship between specific weight and breakage was less clear, although thin flakes were more susceptible to breakage. These results suggest some methods for measuring the quality of oat flakes and show the effect of a milling parameter (specific weight) on these quality parameters. vokMyynti MTT tietopalvelu...|$|E
40|$|The {{filtration}} {{technique is}} a widely applied method to calculate absolute coccolith abundances in paleoceanographic, paleoclimatic and ecological studies. Here, we have tested the accuracy and reproducibility of absolute coccolith abundance estimates obtained with the filtration method in combination with a rotary <b>sample</b> <b>divider.</b> The examination of two different filtration devices, a funnel and an in-line system, analysing a known number of microbeads per weight, revealed that counts obtained with funnel systems are up to Ø 18. 6 % too high. Repeated analyses (15 ×) of a fine-fraction sediment sample revealed {{a standard deviation of}} ± 11. 4 % for the in-line system and ± 15. 2 % for the funnel system, respectively. The comparison between three sub-samples (three splits of 1 / 30) showed a standard deviation of 4. 6 % for the in-line system and 9. 9 % for the funnel system, respectively. Therefore, we assume that the potential split error for the rotary splitter is ? 4. 6 %. The comparison of our results with estimates for the same samples analysed with the random settling and the “spiking with microbeads and spraying method” (SMS method) reveal that only the data obtained with the SMS and in-line filter method are statistically equal. The results obtained with the settling method are too low, whilst the results obtained with funnel filtration are too high in terms of coccolith absolute abundances. Our results confirm that the filtration method, including sample splitting with a rotary splitter, is a suitable method for the analysis of absolute coccolith abundances. However, the use of different filtration devices appears to affect the accuracy and reproducibility of the results. Furthermore, the number of splitting steps should be as small as possible to avoid an increase of error due to error propagation. In order to increase the reliability of the filtration method, we suggest calibrating a filtration device with microbeads as a standard measure. The reported reproducibility of the various preparation techniques may help to compare data sets obtained with different methods. <br/...|$|E
