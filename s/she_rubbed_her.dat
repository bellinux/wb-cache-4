2500|$|After Making the Band 4 - The Tour and {{the release}} of the first single [...] "Damaged," [...] Danity Kane once again {{encountered}} rumors of a breakup, largely spurred by scenes from the Making the Band series featuring their mentor Sean Combs sparring with O'Day over her dance performance and desire to create her own image separate from the group. On the August 28, 2008 episode of Making the Band, Combs, frustrated with the [...] "oversexed" [...] image he felt O'Day now showcased, he called O'Day [...] "one of the worst dancers" [...] in Danity Kane, when she used to be [...] "one of the best." [...] He told O'Day that she no longer looked like the girl he signed. Combs bluntly accused O'Day of trying to expand her fame {{at the expense of the}} entire group, and that she liked flaunting her breasts and wearing big hair. O'Day had boasted about her cleavage to former World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) [...] guru and current SunSport broadband television producer/host Paul Heyman of The Heyman Hustle in order to validate her breasts as natural. In a controversial act, <b>she</b> <b>rubbed</b> <b>her</b> cleavage on Heyman's arm. Furious, Combs asked himself on television why he was keeping O'Day in the group. With O'Day forgoing promotional appearances with the group to appear as Amber Von Tussle on Broadway's Hairspray, speculation arose that O'Day's role in the group had been marginalized. On September 7, 2008, however, the group appeared together at the MTV Video Music Awards to help present the Best New Artist Award.|$|E
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>rubbed</b> <b>her</b> {{cheek against}} the comfortable, rough, heather-smelling {{shoulder}} of her father's coat, while he patted her and smiled, [...] "Good girl! I {{better get out}} and help." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'My Tib {{came with}} {{us when we}} came here. Ay, Tib! purr thy best!' as he held his fingers over her, and <b>she</b> <b>rubbed</b> <b>her</b> smooth head against him.|$|E
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>rubs</b> <b>her</b> {{cheek against}} his. Feeling {{that he does}} not rub [...] his cheek against hers, OLIVE stands away, and looks from him to [...] her mother in wonder.|$|R
5000|$|Helen - a {{woman who}} is often seen in {{important}} places, such as at a wedding or an interview, where <b>she</b> <b>rubs</b> <b>her</b> buttocks along the floor. When the surrounding people look confused, she states, [...] "I've got worms." ...|$|R
5000|$|Urolagnia - simple {{urination}} {{is permitted}} but urination onto or into a person, licking or drinking the urine, or urinating while masturbating will be cut; urination {{by a woman}} while <b>she</b> <b>rubs</b> <b>her</b> breasts and female ejaculation have previously been removed.|$|R
6000|$|... "You're not going, Jack?" [...] {{she said}} hesitatingly, as <b>she</b> <b>rubbed</b> <b>her</b> wet eyes into a {{consciousness}} of his movements. [...] "You'll {{wait to see}} HIM? He'll be here in an hour." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How good!" [...] she cried, {{sniffing}} the cold air. [...] "I'm {{glad you did}} a lot." [...] And she stretched out her hands eagerly for her plate--"Come back to bed, quick--it's cold." [...] <b>She</b> <b>rubbed</b> <b>her</b> hands together sharply.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah but you {{scarcely}} {{take for}} granted I do!" [...] <b>She</b> <b>rubbed</b> <b>her</b> cheek an instant with the polished silver and again the next moment turned over the case. [...] "This {{is the kind of}} one I should like." ...|$|E
5000|$|Kenoly {{states that}} when his mother, Edith Kenoly, was {{pregnant}} with him, <b>she</b> would <b>rub</b> <b>her</b> stomach, and her prayer was, 'Lord let this one praise you.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Maisie wrapped {{herself in}} the soft marten skins, turning the gray {{kangaroo}} fur to the outside. [...] "This is delicious," [...] <b>she</b> said, <b>rubbing</b> <b>her</b> chin thoughtfully along the fur.|$|R
6000|$|... "Sh-sh!" [...] he said softly, and {{the gentle}} animal {{understood}} {{and made no}} further sound. But <b>she</b> gladly <b>rubbed</b> <b>her</b> soft nose {{up and down his}} neck to signify her pleasure.|$|R
60|$|Then he returned, {{rubbing his}} sticky finger dry against his breeches. He stood near to Lettie, {{and she felt}} rather than saw the {{extraordinary}} pale cleanness of the one finger among the others. <b>She</b> <b>rubbed</b> <b>her</b> finger against her dress in painful sympathy.|$|E
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>rubbed</b> <b>her</b> {{cheek against}} his. [...] "Now we must run," [...] she said. She quickly {{turned back to}} the shadow of the board-walk, to draw on her {{stockings}} and shoes, kneeling on the sand like the simple maid of the ballads which she had been envying.|$|E
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>rubbed</b> <b>her</b> {{knuckles}} {{into her}} forehead. [...] "Oh, but life is difficult!" [...] she groaned. [...] "When you loosen the tangle {{in one place}} you tie a knot in another.... Before there is any change, any real change, I shall be dead--dead--dead and finished--two hundred years!..." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Are {{they all}} gone? Did {{you hear the}} bells? Wasn't it splendid?" [...] <b>she</b> asked, <b>rubbing</b> <b>her</b> eyes, and looking about her for the pretty child who was so real and sweet.|$|R
5000|$|Audience records: the Chapter that Mirna (Fernanda Souza) {{throw the}} villain Cristina (Flávia Alessandra) in a pigsty and <b>she</b> <b>rubs</b> <b>her</b> face in mud, it had 48 points of {{audience}} and 70% of share. Another big audience happens, the telenovela {{is going to}} end, when devil Debora (Ana Lúcia Torre) tries to murder Rafael (Eduardo Moscovis), putting poison in his juice, but who takes it and die is herself. But the most watched chapter was the last, going to 56 points.|$|R
60|$|The light wakened Betsy Bobbin. <b>She</b> sat up, <b>rubbed</b> <b>her</b> {{eyes and}} stared across the water.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{feel very}} funny around my neck," [...] she answered, wonderingly. [...] "What {{have you been}} doing to me?" [...] <b>She</b> <b>rubbed</b> <b>her</b> throat. [...] "My neck feels as if it had a band round it, and my tongue seems swollen. What have you been about?" ...|$|E
60|$|Now, at length, Tua {{seemed to}} awake. <b>She</b> <b>rubbed</b> <b>her</b> eyes and looked. There was the {{sleeping}} Asti; {{there on the}} table beside her were the water and the bread; there {{at the foot of the}} couch, glimmering in the low lights of dawn, was the glorious figure of herself draped in the splendid robes.|$|E
6000|$|Poor Una! She was {{thinking}} now, secretly and shamefacedly, of the [...] "beautifying methods" [...] which she saw advertised in every newspaper and cheap magazine. <b>She</b> <b>rubbed</b> <b>her</b> red, desk-calloused elbows with Pemberton's cold-cream. She cold-creamed and massaged her face every night, standing wearily before a milky {{mirror in the}} rather close and lingerie-scattered bedroom, solemnly rotating her fingers about her cheeks and forehead, stopping to conjecture that the pores in her nose were getting enlarged. <b>She</b> <b>rubbed</b> <b>her</b> hair with Pemberton's [...] "Olivine and Petrol" [...] {{to keep it from}} growing thin, and her neck with cocoanut oil to make it more full. She sent for a bottle of [...] "Mme. LeGrand's Bust-Developer," [...] and spent several Saturday afternoons at the beauty parlors of Mme. Isoldi, where in a little booth shut off by a white-rubber curtain, she received electrical massages, applications of a magic N-ray hair-brush, vigorous cold-creaming and warm-compressing, and enormous amounts of advice about caring for the hair follicles, from a young woman who spoke French with a Jewish accent.|$|E
6000|$|The woman, {{looking very}} much ashamed, walked along by Christian; <b>she</b> kept <b>rubbing</b> <b>her</b> brown hands together, and saying; [...] "Gracious lady, I {{would not have}} wished. It is heavy, but I would not have wished." ...|$|R
6000|$|But when <b>she</b> had <b>rubbed</b> <b>her</b> {{cheeks and}} {{smoothed}} her face, {{she was no}} nearer to feeling that she could trust herself. What had happened in her was too violent, too sweet, too terrifying. And going up to him she said: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How {{long you}} have stayed!" [...] cried <b>she,</b> gaping, <b>rubbing</b> <b>her</b> eyes and {{stretching}} herself {{as if she}} had been just waked out of her sleep; she had not, however, any manner of inclination to sleep since they went from home.|$|R
60|$|June, who {{by nature}} {{never saw a}} hornet's nest until she had put her head into it, was seriously alarmed. She came and slipped her arm through his. Not {{convinced}} that he was right, and she herself wrong, because that was not natural to her, she was yet profoundly impressed by the obvious fact that the subject was very bad for him. <b>She</b> <b>rubbed</b> <b>her</b> cheek against his shoulder, and said nothing.|$|E
6000|$|... "Is it a {{crime to}} try and look my best when YOU come here?" [...] {{answered}} Mrs. Rawdon plaintively, and <b>she</b> <b>rubbed</b> <b>her</b> cheek with her handkerchief as if to show there was no rouge at all, only genuine blushes and modesty in her case. About this who can tell? I know there is some rouge that won't come off on a pocket-handkerchief, and some so good that even tears will not disturb it.|$|E
6000|$|She {{stared at}} him. [...] "Was that yesterday? I thought it was--to-morrow." [...] <b>She</b> <b>rubbed</b> <b>her</b> hand across her {{forehead}} as people {{do when they}} wish to clear their minds. Then she sighed deeply. [...] "It tires me so. And yet I can't help trying." [...] A light broke over her face {{at the sound of}} a step on the gravel walk near by, and she said, laughing, without looking round: [...] "That is papa! I knew it was his step." ...|$|E
60|$|The car glided away. They {{all stood}} in a group to see him go, and waved {{indiscriminate}} farewells. Blanche moved a little apart as the car disappeared, and Berenice watched <b>her</b> curiously. <b>She</b> was <b>rubbing</b> <b>her</b> lips with her handkerchief.|$|R
60|$|The {{girl did}} not reply. <b>She</b> was <b>rubbing</b> <b>her</b> head where the roof had struck it and {{thinking}} earnestly {{of the wonderful}} country she had just left. Tot might, in time, forget his visit to Merryland, but Dot never would.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh, {{everybody}} {{laughs at}} Aunt Mary, and she hardly ever finds it out, {{and when she}} does, she does not mind! Even old Mrs. Kedge, her mother, does nothing but laugh at her for trying to be fine. Old Granny is not a bit by way of being a lady, you know; {{she lives in a}} little house in the city with one maid, and I believe <b>she</b> <b>rubs</b> <b>her</b> own tables. I am sure she goes about in omnibuses, though she has lots of money; and Marilda is so fond of her, and so like her, only not so clever and shrewd.' ...|$|R
60|$|Dick murmured {{something}} about never wanting {{a friend or}} a bottle to give him, and also gasped forth his favourite allusion to the wing of friendship and its never moulting a feather; but his faculties appeared to be absorbed in the contemplation of Miss Sally Brass, at whom he stared with blank and rueful looks, which delighted the watchful dwarf beyond measure. As to the divine Miss Sally herself, <b>she</b> <b>rubbed</b> <b>her</b> hands as men of business do, and took a few turns {{up and down the}} office with her pen behind her ear.|$|E
6000|$|... "Father," [...] {{she said}} gently, [...] "that man is mad. He is not {{responsible}} for his actions, and therefore, except in self-defence, you must not think of such a thing. As for {{what he said about}} you, I believe it was only an empty threat, and for me you need have no fear, his power over me is gone; it went like a flash when his lips touched me," [...] and <b>she</b> <b>rubbed</b> <b>her</b> own as though to wipe away some stain. [...] "I am afraid of nothing more. I believe--yes, I believe the old Molimo was right, and that all will end well----" ...|$|E
60|$|The {{afternoon}} was long, the longest I've ever spent. Sometimes {{she seemed to}} sleep, sometimes whispered to herself about her mother, her grandfather, the garden, or her cats--all sorts of inconsequent, trivial, even ludicrous memories seemed to throng her mind--never once, I think, did she speak of Zachary, but, now and then, she asked the time.... Each hour she grew visibly weaker. John Ford sat by her without moving, his heavy breathing was often the only sound; sometimes <b>she</b> <b>rubbed</b> <b>her</b> fingers on his hand, without speaking. It was a summary of their lives together. Once he prayed aloud for her in a hoarse voice; then her pitiful, impatient eyes signed to me.|$|E
60|$|Her rogue face twinkled again, and, turning <b>her</b> chin, <b>she</b> <b>rubbed</b> it on <b>her</b> plump shoulder, {{as might}} a heifer, while {{from behind her}} Grandfather Gaunt's face looked out with a faint, sardonic grin.|$|R
5000|$|Chiharu's {{energetic}} sister, {{she looks}} like a short-haired cheekier version of Chiharu. Despite being fully aware of Densuke and Chiharu's feelings for each other, Yuriko likes trying to get between them, most often attempted by seducing Densuke with her toned runner's butt. <b>She</b> likes <b>rubbing</b> <b>her</b> sister's breasts to tease her because of her own lack of giant breasts, as she only has a 73cm (A-cup) bust.|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Tristram kissed her. Newman {{expressed}} his thanks, {{and she took}} her leave. Her hostess went {{with her to the}} door, and left Newman alone a moment. Presently <b>she</b> returned, <b>rubbing</b> <b>her</b> hands. [...] "It was a fortunate chance," [...] she said. [...] "She had come to decline my invitation. You triumphed on the spot, making her ask you, at the end of three minutes, to her house." ...|$|R
