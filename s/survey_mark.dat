5000|$|Survey markers, {{also called}} <b>survey</b> <b>marks,</b> <b>survey</b> monuments, or {{geodetic}} marks, are objects placed to <b>mark</b> key <b>survey</b> {{points on the}} Earth's surface. They are used in geodetic and land <b>surveying.</b> Informally, such <b>marks</b> {{are referred to as}} benchmarks, although strictly speaking the term [...] "benchmark" [...] is reserved for marks that indicate elevation. Horizontal position markers used for triangulation are also known as triangulation stations.|$|R

5000|$|In {{addition}} to the survey data sheet for a mark being hunted, many hunters bring along a digital camera to take close-up and area pictures of the <b>survey</b> <b>mark</b> (a disk, a cross cut in a rock, an old copper bolt, etc.). These photographs, {{as well as a}} current description of the mark by the person who finds ("recovers") the location of the mark, can then be uploaded to a website as proof of a find. Surveyors use the term [...] "recovering" [...] as a synonym for [...] "finding" [...] a mark. This {{does not mean that the}} found mark should be disturbed in any way. On the contrary—disturbing a <b>survey</b> <b>mark</b> in even a small way often destroys its usefulness to surveyors and others. In the U.S., benchmark hunters often file two different reports on marks they find. One, less formal, is made to the website at Geocaching.com. The other more formal type is made by more experienced and careful hunters to the NGS database itself, and describes the mark's found/not found status, current condition, and updated directions to reach it so that others (particularly surveyors) can more easily re-find the mark.|$|E

There is certainly a local tradition of the existence of such a building, although Nicolson (2002) believes this to be mistaken and speculates that Eilean Mhuire may have been a pre-Norse hermitage.

5|$|In 1878, Rollin J. Reeves <b>surveyed</b> and <b>marked</b> {{the border}} between the newly created State of Colorado and the Utah Territory.

He then began to <b>survey</b> and <b>mark</b> {{the border between}} Colorado and Utah from this point northward. In 1901, Howard B. Carpenter <b>surveyed</b> and <b>marked</b> the border between Arizona and Utah, completing the survey of borders making up the Four Corners Monument.|$|R
50|$|The goat {{track is}} no longer visible. The track ran {{from the front of}} the lawn of the lodge steeply down the crest of the ridge to the west. It was used as a short cut between the lodge and the dump. At its top end it started around about where a <b>survey</b> <b>mark</b> is located on the north-west corner of Mt Roberts. It ran {{approximately}} north-west downhill and crossed the loop track. It then turned due west and down, very steeply, zig zagging until it crossed the bitumen on the apex of a sharp corner below Barry's Track. The bottom section of the track then disappeared into rainforest below the bitumen and down to the dump.|$|E
50|$|During {{survey work}} for the Gunbarrel Highway in May 1958, Beadell found the {{mountain}} which was to bear his name. He {{was always on the}} lookout for high points in the landscape, necessary for accurate surveys. Bill Johnson, who had known Beadell since their time in the army together, recommended that the feature be named in Beadell's honour. The Surveyor General of Western Australia formally approved the name in August 1958. An official <b>survey</b> <b>mark</b> and beacon was erected on the feature in May 1959. On 12 May 1996, exactly one year after the death of Beadell, a memorial was erected on top of the mountain consisting of a replica theodolite and plaque. The ceremony was attended by about 170 people.|$|E
5000|$|Different {{types of}} cairns exist from rough piles of stones to {{interlocking}} dry stone round cylinders. The most important cairns commonly used {{around the world}} are interlocking stone survey cairns constructed around a central <b>survey</b> <b>mark</b> about every 30 km on the tallest peaks across a nation. These physical <b>survey</b> <b>mark</b> cairn systems are the basis for national survey grids to interconnect individual land survey measurements for entire nations. On occasion these permanent interlocking stone cairns are taken down then reconstructed to re-mark measurements to increase the accuracy of the national survey grid. They can also be used in unpopulated countries as emergency location points. In North America and Northern Europe any type of cairn can be used to mark mountain bike and hiking trails and other cross-country trail blazing, especially in mountain regions at or above the tree line. For example, the extensive trail network maintained by the DNT, the Norwegian Trekking Association, extensively uses cairns in conjunction with T-painted rock faces to mark trails. Other examples of these {{can be seen in the}} lava fields of Volcanoes National Park to mark several hikes. Placed at regular intervals, a series of cairns can be used to indicate a path across stony or barren terrain, even across glaciers. Such cairns are often placed at junctions or in places where the trail direction is not obvious. They may also be used to indicate an obscured danger such as a sudden drop, or a noteworthy point such as the summit of a mountain. Most trail cairns are small, usually being a foot or less in height. However, they may be built taller so as to protrude through a layer of snow. Hikers passing by often add a stone, as a small bit of maintenance to counteract the erosive effects of severe weather. North American trail marks are sometimes called [...] "ducks" [...] or [...] "duckies", because they sometimes have a [...] "beak" [...] pointing in the direction of the route. The expression [...] "two rocks do not make a duck" [...] reminds hikers that just one rock resting upon another could be the result of accident or nature rather than intentional trail marking.|$|E
5000|$|In the U.S., about 740,000 [...] "benchmarks" [...] {{with the}} most precise {{elevations}} or coordinates (but {{only a small fraction}} of the existing <b>survey</b> <b>marks)</b> are listed in a database maintained by the National Geodetic Survey (NGS) and accessible on-line. The majority of marks set by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), the Forest Service, the Corps of Engineers, or cities, and states, and local authorities. Cadastral (land <b>survey)</b> <b>marks</b> are usually not measured for the geodetic data base.

Through their dialogue they found that the activity of <b>survey</b> <b>mark</b> hunting relies on the construction of both information and its authority in ways contextualized within the communities that participate; that <b>survey</b> <b>mark</b> hunting is a conversation that builds on the past, where lived experience counts as evidence; and, that <b>survey</b> <b>mark</b> hunting is both a metaphor and embodied enactment of information literacy...|$|E
40|$|Abstract]: For {{many years}} the {{coordination}} of surveys in Australia has been encouraged through the placement and connection to the growing network of survey marks (SMs) in each state. The connection of cadastral surveys to the <b>survey</b> <b>mark</b> infrastructure has facilitated the improvement and maintenance of other spatial databases such as the Digital Cadastral Data Bases (DCDB's). These networks of survey marks are usually managed and maintained by the state surveying and mapping agencies {{on behalf of the}} spatial information community. With the downsizing of the government agencies, their ability to coordinate and maintain these marks has come under increasing pressure. Although advances {{have been made in the}} connection of the <b>survey</b> <b>mark</b> infrastructure to the cadastre, the actual coordination of survey marks appears to have declined in some states. This paper will investigate the current status of this <b>survey</b> <b>mark</b> infrastructure across Australia and its impact on the spatial information industry. The changing role of the private sector in the placement, maintenance and coordination of marks will also be examined. The results of a case study in Queensland that investigated the use, access and maintenance of the permanent <b>survey</b> <b>mark</b> infrastructure by the surveying industry will be discussed. The study found that the permanent <b>survey</b> <b>mark</b> infrastructure in the state is potentially valued in the hundreds of millions of dollars, although this cost does not appear to be fully appreciated by the spatial information community or government. In addition, the effectiveness of the infrastructure appears to be declining due to a range of reasons including the quality of marks, lack of ongoing maintenance, poor access to information and funding. Some possible solutions to these issues are put forward and some examples of recent initiatives across Australia to improve the <b>survey</b> <b>mark</b> infrastructure are examined. The future need for this infrastructure in the context of new positioning technologies will be discussed...|$|E
