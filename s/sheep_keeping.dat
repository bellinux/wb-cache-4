5|$|In South America, {{especially}} in Patagonia, {{there is an}} active modern sheep industry. <b>Sheep</b> <b>keeping</b> was largely introduced through immigration to the continent by Spanish and British peoples, for whom sheep were a major industry during the period. South America has {{a large number of}} sheep, but the highest-producing nation (Brazil) kept only just over 15 million head in 2004, far fewer than most centers of sheep husbandry. The primary challenges to the sheep industry in South America are the phenomenal drop in wool prices in the late 20th century and the loss of habitat through logging and overgrazing. The most influential region internationally is that of Patagonia, which has been the first to rebound from the fall in wool prices. With few predators and almost no grazing competition (the only large native grazing mammal is the guanaco), the region is prime land for sheep raising. The most exceptional area of production is surrounding the La Plata river in the Pampas region. Sheep production in Patagonia peaked in 1952 at more than 21 million head, but has steadily fallen to fewer than ten today. Most operations focus on wool production for export from Merino and Corriedale sheep; the economic sustainability of wool flocks has fallen with the drop in prices, while the cattle industry continues to grow.|$|E
6000|$|... [FN#32] I am {{informed}} that the Benu Kahtan still improvise, but I never heard them. The traveller in Arabia will always be told that some remote clan still produces mighty bards, and uses in conversation the terminal vowels of the classic tongue, but he will not believe these assertions till personally convinced of their truth. The Badawi dialect, however, though debased, is still, as of yore, purer than {{the language of the}} citizens. During the days when philology was a passion in the East, those Stephens and Johnsons of Semitic lore, Firuzabadi and Al-Zamakhshari, wandered from tribe to tribe and from tent to tent, collecting words and elucidating disputed significations. Their grammatical expeditions are still remembered, and are favourite stories with scholars. [FN#33] I say “skilful in reading,” because the Arabs, like the Spaniards, hate to hear their language mangled by mispronunciation. When Burckhardt, who spoke badly, began to read verse to the Badawin, they could not refrain from a movement of impatience, and used to snatch the book out of his hands. [FN#34] The civilized poets of the Arab cities throw the charm of the Desert over their verse, by images borrowed from its scenery—the dromedary, the mirage, and the well—as naturally as certain of our songsters, confessedly haters of the country, babble of lowing kine, shady groves, spring showers, and purling rills. [FN#35] Some will object to this expression; Arabic being a harsh and guttural tongue. But the sound of language, in the first place, depends chiefly upon the articulator. Who thinks German rough in the mouth of a woman, with a suspicion of a lisp, or that English is the dialect of birds, when spoken by an Italian? Secondly, there is a music far more spirit-stirring in harshness than in softness: the languages of Castile and of Tuscany are equally beautiful, yet who does not prefer the sound of the former? The gutturality of Arabia is less offensive than that of the highlands of Barbary. Professor Willis, of Cambridge, attributes the broad sounds and the guttural consonants of mountaineers and the people of elevated plains to the physical action of cold. Conceding this to be a partial cause, I would rather refer the phenomenon to the habit of loud speaking, acquired by the dwellers in tents, and by those who live much in the open air. The Todas of the Neilgherry Hills have given the soft Tamil all the harshness of Arabic, and he who hears them calling to each other from the neighbouring peaks, can remark the process of broadening vowel and gutturalising consonant. On the other hand, the Gallas and the Persians, also a mountain-people, but inhabiting houses, speak comparatively soft tongues. The Cairenes actually omit some of the harshest sounds of Arabia, turning Makass into Ma’as, and Sakka into Sa’a. It is impossible to help remarking the bellowing of the Badawi when he first enters a dwelling-place, and the softening of the sound when he has become accustomed to speak within walls. Moreover, it is to be observed there is a great difference of articulation, not pronunciation, among the several Badawi clans. The Benu Auf are recognised by their sharp, loud, and sudden speech, which the citizens compare to the barking of dogs. The Benu Amr, on the contrary, speak with a soft and drawling sound. The Hutaym, in addition to other peculiarities, add a pleonastic “ah,” to soften the termination of words, as A’atini hawajiyah, (for hawaiji), “Give me my clothes.” [FN#36] The Germans have returned for inspiration to the old Eastern source. Ruckert was guided by Jalal al-Din to the fountains of Sufyism. And even the French have of late made an inroad into Teutonic mysticism successfully enough to have astonished Racine and horrified La Harpe. [FN#37] This, however, does not prevent the language becoming optionally most precise in meaning; hence its high philosophical character. The word “farz,” for instance, means, radically “cutting,” secondarily “ordering,” or “paying a debt,” after which come numerous meanings foreign to the primal sense, such as a shield, part of a tinder-box, an unfeathered arrow, and a particular kind of date. In theology it is limited to a single signification, namely, a divine command revealed in the Koran. Under these circumstances the Arabic becomes, in grammar, logic, rhetoric, and mathematics, as perfect and precise as Greek. I have heard Europeans complain that it is unfit for mercantile transactions.—Perhaps! [FN#38] As a general rule there is a rhyme {{at the end of every}} second line, and the unison is a mere fringe—a long a, for instance, throughout the poem sufficing for the delicate ear of the Arab. In this they were imitated by the old Spaniards, who, neglecting the consonants, merely required the terminating vowels to be alike. We speak of the “sort of harmonious simple flow which atones for the imperfect nature of the rhyme.” But the fine organs of some races would be hurt by that ponderous unison which a people of blunter senses find necessary to produce an impression. The reader will feel this after perusing in “Percy’s Reliques” Rio Verde! Rio Verde! and its translation. [FN#39] In our knightly ages the mare was ridden only by jugglers and charlatans. Did this custom arise from the hatred of, and contempt for, the habits of the Arabs, imported into Europe by the Crusaders? Certainly the popular Eastern idea of a Frank was formed in those days, and survives to these. [FN#40] Baron Von Hammer-Purgstall, in the “Falkner-Klee,” calls this bird the “Saker-falke.” Hence the French and English names sacre and saker. The learned John Beckmann (History of Inventions, Discoveries, and Origins: sub voce) derives falconry from India, where, “as early as the time of Ctesias, hares and foxes were hunted by means of rapacious birds.” I believe, however, that no trace of this sport is found in the writings of the Hindus. Beckmann agrees with Giraldus, against other literati, that the ancient Greeks knew the art of hawking, and proves from Aristotle, that in Thrace men trained falcons. But Aristotle alludes to the use of the bird, as an owl is employed in Italy: the falcon is described as frightening, not catching the birds. Œlian corroborates Aristotle’s testimony. Pliny, however, distinctly asserts that the hawks strike their prey down. “In Italy it was very common,” says the learned Beckmann, “for Martial and Apuleius speak of it as a thing everywhere known. Hence the science spread over Europe, and reached perfection at the principal courts in the twelfth century.” The Emperor Frederic II. wrote “De Arte Venandi cum Avibus,” and the royal author was followed by a host of imitators in the vulgar tongue. Though I am not aware that the Hindus ever cultivated the art, Œlian, it must be confessed, describes their style of training falcons exactly similar to that in use among the modern Persians, Sindians, and Arabs. The Emperor Frederic owes the “capella,” or hood to the Badawi, and talks of the “most expert falconers” sent to him with various kinds of birds by some of the kings of Arabia. The origin of falconry is ascribed by Al-Mas’udi, on the authority of Adham bin Muhriz, to the king Al-Haris bin Mu’awiyah, and in Dr. Sprenger’s admirable translation the reader will find (pp. 426, 428), much information upon the subject. The Persians claim the invention for their just King, Anushirawan, contemporary with Mohammed. Thence the sport passed into Turkey, where it is said the Sultans maintained a body of 6000 falconers. And Frederic Barbarossa, in the twelfth century, brought falcons to Italy. We may fairly give the honour of the invention to Central Asia. [FN#41] Here called “bandukiyah bi ruhayn,” or the two-mouthed gun. The leathern cover is termed “gushat”; it is a bag with a long-ringed tassel at the top of the barrel, and a strap by which it is slung to the owner’s back. [FN#42] I described elsewhere the Mirzak, or javelin. [FN#43] Ostriches are found in Al-Hijaz, where the Badawin shoot after coursing them. The young ones are caught and tamed, and the eggs may be bought in the Madinah bazar. Throughout Arabia there is a belief that the ostrich throws stones at the hunter. The superstition may have arisen from the pebbles being flung up behind by the bird’s large feet in his rapid flight, or it may be a mere “foolery of fancy.” Even in lands which have long given up animal-worship, wherever a beast is conspicuous or terrible, it becomes the subject of some marvellous tale. So the bear in Persia imitates a moolah’s dress; the wolf in France is a human being transformed, and the beaver of North America, also a metamorphosis, belts trees so as to fell them in the direction most suitable to his after purpose. [FN#44] Not that the “Agrebi” of Bir Hamid and other parts have much to learn of us in vice. The land of Al-Yaman is, I believe, the most demoralised country, and Sana’a the most depraved city in Arabia. The fair sex distinguishes itself by a peculiar laxity of conduct, which is looked upon with an indulgent eye. And the men drink and gamble, to say nothing of other peccadilloes, with perfect impunity. [FN#45] In Al-Yaman, it is believed, that if a man eat three heads of garlic in good mountain-samn (or clarified butter) for forty days, his blood will kill the snake that draws it. [FN#46] Circumcisionis causa apud Arabos manifestissima, ulceratio enim endemica, abrasionem glandis aut praeputii, maxima cum facilitate insequitur. Mos autem quem vocant Arabes Al-Salkh ([Arabic] i.e. scarificatio) virilitatem animumque ostendendi modus esse videtur. Exeunt amici paterque, et juvenem sub dio sedentem circumstant. Capit tunc pugionem tonsor et præputio abscisso detrahit pellem [Greek] ab umbilico incipiens aut parum infra, ventremque usque ad femora nudat. Juvenis autem dextra pugionem super tergum tonsoris vibrans magna clamat voce [Arabic] i.e. caede sine timore. Vae si haesitet tonsor aut si tremeat manus! Pater etiam filium si dolore ululet statim occidit. Re confecta surgit juvenis et [Arabic] “Gloria Deo” intonans, ad tentoria tendit, statim nefando oppressus dolore humi procumbit. Remedia Sal, et [Arabic] (tumerica); cibus lac cameli. Nonnullos occidit ingens suppuratio, decem autem excoriatis supersunt plerumque octo: hi pecten habent nullum, ventremque pallida tegit cutis. [FN#47] The Spanish dollar is most prized in Al-Hijaz; in Al-Yaman the Maria Theresa. The Spanish Government has refused to perpetuate its Pillar-dollar, which at one time was so great a favourite in the East. The traveller wonders how “Maria Theresas” still supply both shores of the Red Sea. The marvel is easily explained: the Austrians receive silver at Milan, and stamp it for a certain percentage. This coin was doubtless preferred by the Badawin for its superiority to the currency of the day: they make from it ornaments for their women and decorations for their weapons. The generic term for dollars is “Riyal Fransah.” [FN#48] Torale, sicut est mos Judaicus et Persicus, non inspiciunt. Novae nuptae tamen maritus mappam manu capit: mane autem puellae mater virginitatis signa viris mulieribusque domi ostendit eosque jubilare jubet quod calamitas domestica, sc. filia, intacta abiit. Si non ostendeant mappam, maeret domus, “prima enim Venus” in Arabia, “debet esse cruenta.” Maritus autem humanior, etiamsi absit sanguis, cruore palumbino mappam tingit et gaudium fingens cognatis parentibusque ostendit; paululum postea puellae nonnulla causa dat divortium. Hic urbis et ruris mos idem est. [FN#49] An explanation of this term will be found below. [FN#50] It is the plural of “Kaum,” which means “rising up in rebellion or enmity against,” as well as the popular signification, a “people.” In some parts of Arabia it is used for a “plundering party.” [FN#51] Bayt (in the plural Buyut) is used in this sense to denote the tents of the nomades. “Bayt” radically means a “nighting-place”; thence a tent, a house, a lair, &c., &c. [FN#52] Some tribes will not sell their <b>sheep,</b> <b>keeping</b> them for guests or feasts. [FN#53] So the word is pronounced at Meccah. The dictionaries give “Aakal,” which in Eastern Arabia is corrupted to “Igal.” [FN#54] Called “Tatarif,” plural of Tatrifah, a cartridge. [FN#55] The liver and the spleen are both supposed to be “congealed blood.” Niebuhr has exhausted the names and the description of the locust. In Al-Hijaz they have many local and fantastic terms: the smallest kind, for instance, is called Jarad Iblis, Satan’s locust. [FN#56] This is the Kurut of Sind and the Kashk of Persia. The butter-milk, separated from the butter by a little water, is simmered over a slow fire, thickened with wheaten flour, about a handful to a gallon, well-mixed, so that no knots remain in it, and allowed to cool. The mixture is then put into a bag and strained, after which salt is sprinkled over it. The mass begins to harden after a few hours, when it is made up into balls and dried in the sun. [FN#57] The North American trappers adopted this natural prejudice: the “free trapper” called his more civilized confrere, “mangeur de lard.” [FN#58] Burckhardt shrank from the intricate pedigree of the Meccan Sharifs. I have seen a work upon the subject in four folio volumes in point of matter equivalent to treble the number in Europe. The best known genealogical works are Al-Kalkashandi (originally in seventy-five books, extended to one hundred); the Umdat al-Tullab by Ibn Khaldun; the “Tohfat al-Arab fi Ansar al-Arab,” a well-known volume by Al-Siyuti; and, lastly, the Sirat al-Halabi, in six volumes 8vo. Of the latter work there is an abridgment by Mohammed al-Banna al-Dimyati in two volumes 8vo.; but both are rare, and consequently expensive. [FN#59] I give the following details of the Harb upon the authority of my friend Omar Effendi, who is great in matters of genealogy. [FN#60]The first word is the plural, the second the singular form of the word. [FN#61] In the singular Aufi and Amri. [FN#62] To these Mr. Cole adds seven other sub-divisions, viz.:— 1. Ahali al-Kura (“the people of Kura?”), 5000. 2. Radadah, 800. 3. Hijlah, 600. 4. Dubayah, 1500. 5. Benu Kalb, 2000. 6. Bayzanah, 800. 7. Benu Yahya, 800. And he makes the total of the Benu Harb about Al-Jadaydah amount to 35,000 men. I had no means of personally ascertaining the correctness of this information. [FN#63] The reader will remember that nothing like exactitude in numbers can be expected from an Arab. Some rate the Benu Harb at 6000; others, equally well informed, at 15,000; others again at 80,000. The reason of this is that, whilst one is speaking of the whole race, another may be limiting it to his own tribe and its immediate allies. [FN#64] “Sham” which, properly speaking, means Damascus or Syria, in Southern Arabia and Eastern Africa is universally applied to Al-Hijaz.|$|E

In this thesis are described following breeds: Cameroon sheep, Heidschnucke, Shetland sheep, Ouessant sheep, Jacob sheep and Kerry Hill sheep. Information was drawn from available literature and from personally visited breeding. This thesis is a summary of available information about history of sheep breeding and beginning of small-scale keeping. They are founded as a free time activity or for concrete utility.

In a small-scale <b>sheep</b> <b>keeping</b> are used often primitive breeds that are strong and adaptable therefore even unskilled breeder can start a new breeding. Furthermore, there is describtion of history and actual information about breeding in the Czech Republic. The thesis is focused on utility of every described breed.

Data from Association of Sheep and Goat Breeders show that small-scale sheep breeding is more popular every year in the Czech Republic.

40|$|Abstract The Italian wolf is in {{the process}} of regaining the Alpine region which comes into {{conflict}} with the extensive <b>sheep</b> <b>keeping</b> practiced in Switzerland during the summer. As in Switzerland, the wolf is a protected species, the government reimburses losses caused by wolves. Therefore we wanted to know whether the Italian wolf could be distinguished from the domestic dog by microsatellite analysis if DNA samples of the predators could be secured. The evaluation of combined genotypes for the microsatellites CanBern 6, CPH 4, CPH 7, CPH 9, CPH 12, CPH 22 and ZuBeCa 1 made it possible to identify an individual as either a domestic dog or an Italian wolf. The assignment of an individual to either one of the two populations is based on the logarithm of the likelihood ratio of an individual being an Italian wolf rather than a domestic dog, given a specific combined genotype. The distribution of the Italian wolf combined genotypes (n = 42) is clearly distinct from the distribution of the domestic dog combined genotypes (n = 90). The likelihood ratio for the "worst" Italian wolf combined genotype was 2. 3 E+ 5 and for the "worst" domestic dog combined genotype was 3. 8 E- 5. </p...|$|E

The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the nitrous oxide (N 2 O) emissions from the steppes for Awassi <b>sheep</b> <b>keeping</b> and feed cropping in arid zones such as Syria. The methodology developed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was used to estimate N 2 O emissions. A survey was conducted on 64 farms in Syria to gather data for analysis. Precipitation and crop yield data from 2001 to 2009 were also used for calculation and modelling. Sheep-keeping systems, precipitation, year and the region have significant effects on N 2 O emissions (p< 0. 05). Emissions of N 2 O from lands with extensive, semi-intensive and intensive systems were 0. 30 ± 0. 093, 0. 598 ± 0. 113 and 2. 243 ± 0. 187 kgsheep− 1 year− 1, respectively. Crop production was higher in regions with high precipitation levels, which helped to reduce N 2 O emissions. Using more residuals of wheat, cotton and soya as feed for sheep in the keeping systems evaluated may decrease the overuse of steppe regions and N 2 O emissions. Nitrous oxide emissions of N 2 O from sheep-keeping areas can be reduced by changing sheep-keeping systems and increasing the crop production in arid zones through artificial irrigation...|$|E
40|$|Sheep {{production}} {{is an integral}} part of the subsistence crop-livestock systems of Ethiopian highlands and plays crucial role in economic development and poverty reduction. So far, there have been very limited efforts exerted to introduce and promote market oriented sheep production and hence the current income generating capacity of the sector is not at all encouraging. Therefore, reorientation of sheep production systems towards consumer preferences and demands through timely and comprehensive transformation need to be given due emphasis. With the intent of contributing in this line, this study analyzed whether prices of indigenous sheep breed are influenced by their own traits as well as other market and temporal factors. The level and intensity of market participation was also investigated as the willingness and level of market participation by the sheep keepers determines the effectiveness of interventions to reorient the production system. Determinants of the decision to participate in sheep production were also identified and analyzed in this study. Data were generated both from the rural households in their villages and from sheep sellers and buyers in four rural markets in Horro-Guduruu Wollega Zone of Oromia. Hedonic pricing model was fitted for the analysis of determinants of indigenous sheep price. The empirical result indicates that phenotypic traits of traded sheep (age, color, body size, and tail condition) are major determinants of price implying the need for development of comprehensive breeding program. Season and market locations are also very important determinants of price suggesting the need to target season and market place in breeding program so that sheep keepers benefit from the intervention and hence the program become sustainable. To investigate production participation decision, Probit model was employed and the result show that livestock asset base, access to extension service, access to market information and educational background of the household head are significant determinants of production participation decision. Thus, the implications are that improving farmers’ access to extension service including livestock market information, improving access to credit service to develop farmers’ asset base, and expanding educational opportunity in the rural area would result in farm households’ ability to diversify their livelihood strategy. Poisson and Negative Binomial models were employed to examine factors determining the level of market participation by sheep keepers. The empirical results of both types of models consistently show that flock size, family size, educational background, experience, access to market information, and access to veterinary service were decisive determinants of level of market participation for <b>sheep</b> <b>keeping</b> farm households. The implications of these empirical results indicate the need to expand and capacitate service providing institutions, like veterinary services and livestock market information services, to improve access to the services and hence enhance market participation and advance producers income. As educational background and production experience are also the vital determinants, provision of training to farm household is important to increase market participation by sheep keepers...|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to game, mutton was consumed {{from time to}} time. <b>Keeping</b> <b>sheep</b> provided wool to the household, and when a sheep reached an age when it was unsuitable for wool production, it could be harvested as mutton. Sheep were originally introduced to the Americas through the Spanish in Florida. In the north, the Dutch and English also introduced several varieties of sheep. The casual English practice of animal husbandry allowed sheep to roam free, consuming a variety of forage. Foragebased diets produce meat with a characteristically strong, gamey flavor and a tough consistency, which requires aging and slow cooking to tenderize.|$|R

40|$|A {{survey was}} {{undertaken}} to understand sheep management, breeding practices and selection criteria for Red Maasai sheep in Maasai pastoralist communities in Kajiado District, Kenya. Differences between North and South Kajiado District were investigated to gain knowledge about farmers having different prerequisites {{and how it}} can affect the sheep production. The reason for <b>keeping</b> <b>sheep</b> and the specific breeds show the multiple objectives of the Maasai farmers. Adaptive traits, such as resistance to diseases and droughts, and productive traits, such as increased growth and carcass weight, were both ranked highly. In addition to this, the sheep has a social and traditional value in Maasai culture. Although the Red Maasai sheep was ranked highly with regard to traits important for adaptation and social purposes, the population was considered to decline in numbers of pure bred Red Maasai. The breed was common in the whole district, but mostly used in crosses with Dorper in both North Kajiado and South Kajiado, whereas crosses with Blackhead Persian were more common to use in South than in North Kajiado. Most important reason for <b>keeping</b> <b>sheep</b> was food source, followed by source of cash income. When purchasing new sheep for the time being, the most important traits were body size (weight and height) and growth. Large differences in cultivation practices, herd size and herd productivity could be shown between North and South Kajiado. The differences were most likely caused by the different infrastructural and environmental conditions in the two locations. Challenges in the future, with unpredictable climate with recurrent droughts, may lead to larger demand of well adapted sheep. In this case, Red Maasai sheep would be an appropriate breed to better utilize. Swedish International Development Cooperation Agenc...|$|R
40|$|The {{traditional}} {{economy of}} the region called Pampa, based in the extensive raising of cattle, is being threatened and has been losing space after the introduction of alternatives that affect the social and biological evolution of the Pampa biome. One of the outlined alternatives in the “Southern Portion” of Rio Grande do Sul is to substitute the original meadows for homogeneous plantations of exotic trees to produce cellulose, which has become {{the center of a}} social and environmental issue. The {{purpose of this study is}} to analyze the perception of family cattle raisers in the Territory of Alto Camaquã/RS in what concerns the “reforestation” process in that area. For this, semi-structured interviews have been carried out, along with observation, daily field journal and bibliographical review on such subject. Family cattle raisers seem to resist bringing exotic species (“forestation”) to the area, because of their impact on and of the dissociation of individuals with local environment, reduction of water sources, appearance of predators, especially boars, destruction of natural pasture and decrease of of beef cattle and sheep activities, which are traditional. This way, family cattle raisers contribute to maintain the natural landscape of the region with the tradition of raising bovine and <b>sheep</b> and <b>keeping</b> the environmental and social characteristics of Pampa, especially in the Territory of Alto Camaquã - Southern Portion of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil...|$|R
40|$|Six {{reindeer}} (Rangifer tarandus), five {{sheep and}} six goats (Ovis ovis and Capra hircus) were experimentally {{infected with the}} nematode Elaphostrongylus alces. Additionally, one sheep was infected with E. rangiferi. Reindeer infected with E. alces showed no neurological signs. Sheep and goats infected with the same parasite also remained clinically healthy; however, the sheep infected with E. rangiferi showed severe neurological signs and became paralysed. Pathological lesions were minimal in reindeer and domestic ruminants infected with E. alces, but were prominent in the lamb infected with E. rangiferi. Our results indicate that <b>keeping</b> and transferring <b>sheep</b> and goats into ateas inhabited by moose, which is a natural host of E. alces may not harm the livestock, while <b>keeping</b> <b>sheep</b> in areas inhabited by reindeer infected with E. rangiferi may result in petiodic outbreaks of cerebrospinal elaphostrongylosis in sheep...|$|R

As more is understood about the behavioral tendencies related to maternal success, management systems will be tailored to lower labor requirements, making sheep farming less stressful for those involved and encouraging the growth of the sheep industry. Any tactic that can work toward the goals of decreased labor and increased production, while preserving or enhancing animal welfare, should continue to be thoroughly explored.
