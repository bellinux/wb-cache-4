50|$|Recipes for sloe gin vary {{depending}} on the maker's taste. The sweetness can be adjusted to taste {{at the end of the}} process, although sufficient sugar is required while the drupes steep to ensure full extraction of flavour. When made sufficiently slowly, the alcohol extracts an almond-like essence from the sloes' stones, giving sloe gin a particular aromatic flavour. However, some recipes use a shorter steeping time and include a small amount of almond essence. Another common variation is the addition of a few cloves and a small <b>stick</b> <b>of</b> <b>cinnamon.</b>|$|E

50|$|Salmagundi is also purportedly a meal {{served on}} pirate ships. It is a stew of {{anything}} the cook had on hand, usually consisting of chopped meat, anchovies, eggs, and onions, often arranged in rows on lettuce {{and served with}} vinegar and oil, and spiced with anything available. The following is taken from a reprint of Mrs. Hill's New Cook Book, originally published in 1867 and republished by Applewood Books of Bedford, Massachusetts.Boil two calf's feet; take the feet out when done; reduce the broth to a quart. The feet may be fried and used, first removing the bones. Let the broth become cold in an earthen vessel; scrape off all the grease; wipe {{the top of the}} jelly with a coarse towel; put the cake of jelly into a kettle lined with tin or porcelain; season it with two lemons cut up (removing the seed), fine blades of mace, a <b>stick</b> <b>of</b> <b>cinnamon,</b> pepper (white pepper is best), and salt to taste. Beat to a froth the whites of six eggs; stir these to the jelly just as it melts; it must then be left to clarify and not stirred again. When it simmers long enough to look clear at the sides, strain it through a flannel bag before the fire; do not squeeze the bag. Suspend it by running a stick through a loop made by tying the bag; rest each end of the stick upon a chair, and throw a table-cloth over all to keep out the dust. If the jelly does not run through clear the first time, pour it through the jelly-bag again. Set this aside. Prepare the meat and seasoning for the pie. Put into a stew-pan slices of pickled pork, using a piece of pork four inches square; if it is very salty lay it an hour in tepid water. Cut up two young, tender chickens—a terrapin, if it is convenient—two or three young squirrels, half a dozen birds or squabs. Stew them gently, cutting up and adding a few sprigs of parsley. Roll into half a pound of butter two tablespoonfuls of flour; add this to the stew until the meat is nearly done. Line a fire-proof dish, or two fire-proof dishes (this quantity of stew will fill two common-sized or quart dishes;) with good pastry; mix the different kinds of meats; put in Irish potato dumplings; season to taste; pour in the gravy and bake. When done, remove the upper crust when the pie is cold and pack in the jelly, heaping the jelly in the middle. Return the crust and serve cold or hot. The jelly will prevent them become too dry. They are good Christmas pies and will keep several days. Very little gravy should be used, and that rich. Should there be too much, leave the stew-pan open until reduced sufficiently. This kind of pie keeps well if made in deep plates, and by some is preferred to those baked in deep moulds.|$|E

The highest yield <b>of</b> <b>cinnamon</b> oil was obtained by soxhlet extraction in dichloromethane, followed by hexane and petroleum ether were 5. 22 %, 3. 84 % and 3. 71 %, respectively. While only 1. 82 % yields <b>of</b> <b>cinnamon</b> essential oil extracted when using hydrodistillation method. The volatile compounds <b>of</b> <b>cinnamon</b> essential oil were identified using GC-MS analysis. The results indicated that 9 major volatile compound were presence such as alcohols, aldehydes, alkenes, carboxylic acids, ether, ester and ketone in the cinnamon essential oil extracted by hydrodistillation.

Cinnamon (Cinnamomum Zeylanicum) is an endemic plant popularly known as “Kurundu” in Sri Lanka. Cinnamon yields mainly cinnamon leaf oil and cinnamon bark oil. Cinnamon bark oil produces by processing dried <b>cinnamon</b> chips. Composition <b>of</b> <b>cinnamon</b> bark oil varies due to many factors including the type and quality <b>of</b> <b>cinnamon</b> chips. Good quality cinnamon chips can be produced by uniform drying. Present study examines the effect of air drying temperature during pre processing <b>of</b> <b>cinnamon</b> chips on the volatile organic compounds <b>of</b> <b>cinnamon</b> bark oil extracted by the method <b>of</b> hydro-distillation <b>of</b> <b>cinnamon</b> chips. Laboratory scale tunnel dryer fitted with an electrical heater was used to dry cinnamon chips at five different air drying temperatures; ambient temperature, 35 °C, 40 °C, 45 °C and 50 °C. The extracted cinnamon bark oil was analysed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). A total of 16 compounds were identified, cinnamaldehyde-E, cinnamyl acetate, linalool and eugenol, in that order, being the main volatile organic compounds. Results indicated that air drying temperature <b>of</b> <b>cinnamon</b> chips significantly altered the composition <b>of</b> <b>cinnamon</b> bark oil. Percentage of Cinnamaldehyde-E increased {{with the increase in}} drying temperature. High percentage of monoterpenes, cinnamaldehyde and cinnamaldehyde derivatives such as cinnamyl acetate, and 2 -methoxy-cinnamaldehyde was observed at low temperature drying. Increase in drying temperature resulted in substantial losses in certain oxygenated terpenes and sesquiterpene. The percentage of cinnamaldehyde-E could be substantially increased by hot air drying but at the expense of oil yield. Keywords: Bark oil, air drying, volatile organic compounds, cinnamon chip...|$|R

Previously, we have reported that anti-cancer effect <b>of</b> <b>cinnamon</b> extracts is associated with modulation of angiogenesis and effector function of CD 8 + T cells. In this study, we further identified that anti-tumor effect <b>of</b> <b>cinnamon</b> extracts is also link with enhanced pro-apoptotic activity by inhibiting the activities NFκB and AP 1 in mouse melanoma model. Methods Water soluble cinnamon extract was obtained and quality <b>of</b> <b>cinnamon</b> extract was evaluated by HPLC (High Performance Liquid Chromatography) analysis. In this study, we tested anti-tumor activity and elucidated action mechanism <b>of</b> <b>cinnamon</b> extract using various types of tumor cell lines including lymphoma, melanoma, cervix cancer and colorectal cancer in vitro and in vivo mouse melanoma model. Results Cinnamon extract strongly inhibited tumor cell proliferation in vitro and induced active cell death of tumor cells by up-regulating pro-apoptotic molecules while inhibiting NFκB and AP 1 activity and their target genes such as Bcl- 2, BcL-xL and survivin.
