25|$|The {{shape of}} the hook shank can vary widely from merely {{straight}} {{to all sorts of}} curves, kinks, bends and offsets. These different shapes contribute in some cases to better hook penetration, fly imitations or bait holding ability. Many hooks intended to hold dead or artificial baits have sliced shanks which create barbs for better baiting holding ability. Jig hooks are designed to have lead weight molded onto the hook <b>shank.</b> <b>Hook</b> descriptions may also include shank length as standard, extra long, 2XL, short, etc. and wire size such as fine wire, extra heavy, 2X heavy, etc.|$|E
40|$|The {{black bream}} Acanthopagrus butcheri {{recreational}} fishery {{is the largest}} estuarine fishery in Victoria. This fishery is managed through legal-minimum length and daily bag limits. The success of this management strategy requires a high survival rate for released fish. Deep-hooking is known to reduce the chance of fish survival after recreational capture and release. This study investigated the potential to reduce deep-hooking {{and the number of}} under-size A. butcheri caught by varying angling gear and techniques. Three sizes of long <b>shank</b> <b>hook</b> (small [size 8], medium [size 4] and large [size 1 / 0]) and two angling techniques (slack line and tight line) were tested for their deep-hooking rates and selectivity characteristics. Increasing the hook size from small to large decreased the likelihood of deep-hooking by 6. 6 times (95 % CI 2. 3 – 16. 3 times). Fishing with a tight line instead of a slack line decreased the chance of deep-hooking by almost 100 % (95 % CI 0. 8 – 3. 6). Fishing with a large hook instead of a small hook significantly (F = 6. 71, df = 2, P = < 0. 001) increased the mean A. butcheri length, although this mean size increase was less than 1 cm. This study was able to identify angling gear and angling technique manipulations that reduced the rate of deep-hooking when targeting A. butcheri in Victorian estuaries. <br /...|$|E
50|$|Tube flies are {{threaded}} on a tippet {{instead of}} the traditional method of tying the fly to the tippet. The angler threads a tippet through the tube and attaches the tippet to a hook. Hooks used for tube flies are typically short <b>shank,</b> wide gap <b>hooks.</b> Once tied to the tippet, the hook is pulled into a junction tube attached {{to the rear of}} the tube fly. When a fish is hooked, the fly is typically dislodged from the hook and slides up the tippet. This protects the fly from damage by the fishes teeth. The use of wide gap, short <b>shank</b> <b>hooks</b> with tube flies provides less leverage for fish and results in higher hookup rates over traditional style flies. An additional advantage results from the ability to replace dulled or damaged hooks without replacing the fly. Tube fly hooks can be oriented with hook point down or up depending on conditions.|$|R

50|$|Stevens innovated fly tying {{design by}} {{shortening}} streamers to extend only slightly beyond hooks, and by using longer <b>hook</b> <b>shanks.</b> She furthermore brought fly profiles closer {{to those of}} baitfish by tying materials parallel to the hook, and used fly shoulders to imitate bait fish gill plates. While patterns similar to the Grey Ghost existed prior to Stevens work, she pioneered the streamer by using new colors, structure, and less exotic materials, making it more effective and accessible.

Care needs to be taken when handling hooks as they can 'hook' the user. If a hook goes in deep enough below the barb, pulling the hook out will tear the flesh. There are three methods to remove a hook. The first is by cutting the flesh to remove it. The second is to cut the eye of the hook off and then push the remainder of the hook through the flesh and the third is to place pressure on the shank towards the flesh which pulls the barb into the now oval hole then push the hook out the way it came in.|$|R

50|$|The first {{suggestion}} for tying the bumper knot is to always keep the loops tight. If the loops become loose {{at all the}} knot will not work. The initial string used for the lead usually consumes about 8 inches when tying. In order to start tying the knot, hold the bend of the hook, and start feeding {{one end of the}} line through the eye of the hook. Do this until it is possible to grasp it with the same fingers holding the hook. After that, start to wrap the line around the <b>shank</b> of the <b>hook</b> in a clockwise direction. It is known that the first loop is also the toughest to make. Altogether, about 18-20 loops will be adequate. It needs to be tight and {{there needs to be a}} lot of pressure on the line. Then place the opposite end of the leader in a parallel direction to the <b>shank</b> of the <b>hook</b> and put it through the eye. All this needs to be done so that the previous loops do not come undone. Wrap over the line that is put through the eye, and make these wraps clockwise. On this set, it is recommended to only wrap with medium pressure. For about four or five wraps, continue to work with this process and make sure that they do not overlap. Then grasp all of the wraps on the hook to hold them tightly. Then pull the line hanging out of the eye and pull it through the wraps. The final step is to make everything snug and in place.|$|R
25|$|Hooks are {{designed}} as either single hooks—a single eye, shank and point; double hooks—a single eye merged with two shanks and points; or triple—a single eye merged with three shanks and three evenly spaced points. Double hooks are formed {{from a single}} piece of wire and {{may or may not have}} their shanks brazed together for strength. Triple hooks are formed by adding a single eyeless hook to a double hook and brazing all three <b>shanks</b> together. Double <b>hooks</b> are used on some artificial lures and are a traditional fly hook for Atlantic Salmon flies, but are otherwise fairly uncommon. Triple hooks are used on all sorts of artificial lures as well as for a wide variety of bait applications.|$|R
40|$|Certain {{aspects of}} the biology of two species of fish, {{bluegill}} (Lepomis macrochirus) and largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides), and the assessment of fishing pressure upon the sport fishery of Pelican Lake, Uintah County, Utah, a 680 ha warmwater lake, were studied between April 1, 1976 and June 30, 1978. The growth rate of bluegills (sexes combined) was fairly rapid; the mean back-calculated total lengths from ages one through nine were 55, 112, 166, 194, 211, 229, 245, 256 and 259 mm. The growth of largemouth bass was 104, 194, 271, 316, 350, 405 and 416 mm total length for ages one through seven for the combined sexes. Male bluegills matured earlier in life than females. Bluegills spawned continually from the first of June to the first of September, although the peak spawning occurred in June of both years. Gonadal weight to body weight ratios (maturity index) were greatest {{in the first of}} June for both male and female bluegills. Fecundity estimates ranged from 1 1, 102 mature ova for an age II bluegill to 4 6, 281 mature ova for an age V bluegill. Fecundity estimates for largemouth bass ranged from 4, 810 mature ova for a II year old to 31, 719 mature ova for a V year old. Largemouth bass spawned primarily in late May in 1976 and early June in 1977. Angler use of the lake was estimated to be 10, 054 angler days fished in 1975, culminating a seven-year increase in use, with subsequent declines in angling to 8, 001 angler days in 1976 and 5, 027 in 1977. A significant winter fishery developed in 1978. Anglers harvested an estimated 58, 277, 44, 918 and 22, 469 bluegills and 5, 791, 2, 747 and 4, 176 largemouth bass in 1975, 1976 and 1977, respectively. Angler catch rates for bluegills in respective years were 1. 520, 1. 640 and 1. 130 fish/hr and 0. 204, 0. 094 and 0. 213 fish/hr for largemouth bass. Bluegill age groups IV and V and largemouth bass age group III composed the majority of angler harvested fish in 1976 and 1977. Age and size composition of angler harvested bluegills indicated no statistically significant change between 1976 and 1977. Bass harvested by anglers in 1977 were significantly greater in weight than those harvested in 1976. The total annual mortality determined from scale analyses of angler harvested fish was 59. 9 % for bluegill and 71. 6 % for bass. A significant number of male bluegills was harvested by anglers in June 1977, the period of peak nesting activity. Anglers released 5, 158 bluegills in 1977, of which an estimated 11 % (565) were lost to hooking mortality. Of various hook sizes used to assess hooking mortality, number 8 regular <b>shank</b> <b>hooks</b> yielded the highest total mortality (18 %). The lowest hooking mortality was with number 6 regular <b>shank</b> jig <b>hooks</b> (0 %) and where the leader was cut and the hook allowed to remain (0 %). Higher mortality of worm-hooked fish was attributed largely to anatomical location of hooking. Of the total (19) bluegill mortalities, 63 % were hooked in the esophagus and 37 % in the gill/gill arch. Postwinter population sampling in May 1977 indicated the estimated standing crop weight was 40 % less than the prewinter standing crop weight in Au gust 1976. A similar loss in standing crop (37 %) was noted in weight from August 1977 to June 1978. The greatest loss in numbers was in young-of-the-year bluegill that suffered an estimated 98 % overwinter mortality. Midwinter water quality analyses indicated that anoxic conditions occurred from 2. 0 m below the ice to the bottom. An increase in hydrogen sulfide levels was also detected. Recommendations for the fishery were (1) adjustment of the daily bag limit for the bluegill sport fishery with fluctuations in angling use; (2) continuation of a creel census from April 1 through July 31 similar to the design used in this study to annually assess angling use, catch rates, total harvest and the size and age composition of this harvest; (3) stomach analyses of potential predators to assess the overwinter mortality of blue gills; (4) retainment of the current bag limit on largemouth bass with future consideration of utilizing a 12 - 15 -in (305 - 381 mm) total length limit to increase the numbers of larger, older bass in the population; (5) nonrestrictive use of terminal gear by anglers since hooking mortality of bluegills caught and released by anglers in the summer of 1977 was insignificant; (6) no size length restrictions on the bluegills retained by anglers; and (7) consideration of purchasing additional water storage from the irrigation company...|$|R
50|$|There are {{limitless}} {{material and}} colour variations, however {{the essence of}} the Muddler Minnow is a spun deer hair head. While each Muddler may differ in colour or profile, all true Muddlers have a fore-end or body of spun deer hair that is clipped close to the shank to provide a buoyant head. Typically there is an underwing of squirrel hair and a wing of mottled secondary turkey feather. Often the fly body is made of gold/silver Mylar or tinsel wrapped around the <b>hook</b> <b>shank.</b> Marabou may be tied in as a substitute wing for colour and lifelike movement through the water. The head may be weighted or unweighted, according to the style of fishing, the target species and the intended imitation.

40|$|Radiographic {{studies are}} among the most {{important}} diagnostic procedures in the clinical evaluation of sea turtles. The anatomical structures for which it is possible to obtain an optimal assessment by radiographic examination are respiratory tact, digestive tract, skeleton, carapace, and plastron. The fundamental and indispensable projections for a proper radiographic estimation of the body are dorsoventral view, vertical beam, horizontal beam, lateral view, and craniocaudal view. Radiographs in the dorsal-ventral projection usually allow achieving the detection of fishhooks in the various sections of the digestive tract. In fact, hooks are poorly detectable in other projections due to the intense radiopacity determined by the superimposition of other anatomical structures, and to the inability to set the radiographic cassette in strict contact with the body of the animal. On the contrary, when the hooks are stacked in the esophagus wall, especially in the intracoelomatic tract, images in the dorsoventral beam do not allow to ascertain if the tip or the hook barbs are dangerously close to airways (trachea and bronchi) or great vessels (brachycephalic trunk). Without this information, the surgeon risks to cause irreparable injuries during the removal of the hook. On the other hand, a complete radiographic study in two orthogonal projections is invaluable to correctly assess position and orientation of the hook to properly schedule the surgery. The present study included 21 loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta) referred to the Department of Veterinary Medicine of Bari University (Italy), which showed drifting longlines hooks located in the caudal cervical or intracoelomatic esophagus subsequently to a first radiographic evaluation in dorsoventral beam. The other radiographic projections were obtained in horizontal beam lateral view, with turtles set on a radiolucent support (plastic box) with the surface of the radiographic cassette adherent to the lateral margin of the bridge. In order to reduce the overlap of soft tissues of the pectoral girdle, the front flippers were forward stretched below the neck, and temporarily wrapped together with self-adhesive elastic bandage. X-ray images were obtained with a digital acquisition system, which allowed improving contrast and brightness of images by graphic processing. The opportunity to evaluate different radiograms obtained in two orthogonal projections has allowed to precisely locate the position of <b>hook,</b> <b>shank</b> and bend with respect to the horizontal midsagittal plane the animal, the orientation of the tip (cranially, caudally or laterally), and above all the closeness to vital anatomical structures. These significant assessments have allowed choosing the most appropriate surgical approaches, and to avoid dangerous intraoperative maneuvers during removal of hooks...|$|R
