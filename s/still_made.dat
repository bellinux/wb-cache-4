5|$|During the High Middle Ages, the {{majority}} of Poland's castles were <b>still</b> <b>made</b> of wood, so uncut stone was frequently added to the front to improve their fire defences.|$|E
5|$|The company <b>still</b> <b>made</b> some acquisitions, such as {{buying the}} instant {{messaging}} specialist Odigo for $20 million in 2002, after having previously purchased a 12percent stake in it in 2001.|$|E
5|$|Despite these {{administrative}} systems, important state {{decisions were}} <b>still</b> <b>made</b> by the emperor. The emperor met with {{officials from the}} Northern and Southern Administrations twice a year, but aside from that the emperor {{spent much of his}} time attending to tribal affairs outside of the capital cities.|$|E
50|$|Rumors {{were that}} <b>Stills</b> <b>made</b> an {{unsuccessful}} attempt {{to become one}} of the Monkees. He was reportedly turned down, not due to any lack of ability, but because of a conflict with his existing music publishing contract. So instead, he recommended his friend, multi-instrumentalist Peter Tork.|$|R
50|$|Chef Distilled is an American rum {{distillery}} {{founded in}} 2013 by Paul Menta in Key West, Florida {{in the former}} Coca-Cola bottling plant on 105 Simonton St. The rum is distilled on site in two custom-made copper pot <b>stills</b> <b>made</b> by Vendome Copper and Brass Works in Louisville, Kentucky.|$|R

5|$|U.S. forces also {{established}} an officer candidate {{school during the}} later part of the war, using instructors selected from the American troops in the country. The school conducted two courses and graduated nearly 300 new officers. Just under twenty years later in 1964, the group <b>still</b> <b>made</b> up over 50% of the officer corps of the AFL.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{acquiring}} the Turk, Mälzel {{had to learn}} its secrets and make some repairs {{to get it back}} in working order. His stated goal was to make explaining the Turk a greater challenge. While the completion of this goal took ten years, the Turk <b>still</b> <b>made</b> appearances, most notably with Napoleon Bonaparte.|$|E
5|$|Australia was {{the first}} Commonwealth nation to create its own VC, on 15 January 1991. Although it is a {{separate}} award, its appearance is identical to its British counterpart. Canada followed suit when in 1993 Queen Elizabeth signed Letters Patent creating the Canadian VC, which is also similar to the British version, except that the legend has been changed from FOR VALOUR to the Latin PRO VALORE. The New Zealand and Australian awards are <b>still</b> <b>made</b> by the jewellers Hancocks from the gunmetal used for the originals. The Canadian Victoria Cross also includes metal from the same cannon, along with copper and other metals from all regions of Canada.|$|E

50|$|Lotoko {{is usually}} made from maize, but {{sometimes}} made from cassava, or plantain. Heads of corn are cut up and boiled into a mash {{which is then}} fermented and distilled using improvised <b>stills</b> <b>made</b> from cut-down oil drums. Because of the woody core of the cobs of corn, the alcohol produced contains high levels of methanol which is toxic.|$|R

5|$|Costello officially {{retired from}} wrestling in 1983 but <b>still</b> <b>made</b> a few brief {{returns to the}} ring after that. In 1993, he managed The New Fabulous Kangaroos (Denny Kass and Al Snow) before {{retiring}} completely from the wrestling business. Both Costello and his tag team partner Heffernan died before Kangaroos were honored as the first tag team to ever {{be inducted into the}} Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame in 2003, which started a tradition of inducting a new team every year.|$|E
5|$|In the 21st century, {{the high}} price of nickel has led to some {{replacement}} of the metal in coins around the world. Coins <b>still</b> <b>made</b> with nickel alloys include one- and two-euro coins, 5¢, 10¢, 25¢ and 50¢ U.S. coins, and 20p, 50p, £1 and £2 UK coins. Nickel-alloy in 5p and 10p UK coins was replaced with nickel-plated steel began in 2012, causing allergy problems for some people and public controversy.|$|E
5|$|In {{the next}} year, the Rockets started poorly, winning only 15 {{of the first}} 33 games amidst {{injuries}} among the star players and off-court controversies {{for the rest of}} the roster, such as Lewis Lloyd and Mitchell Wiggins getting suspended for cocaine use. The team <b>still</b> <b>made</b> the playoffs, and advanced to the second round past favored Clyde Drexler and his Portland Trail Blazers (eventually proving to be their last playoff victory until 1993), before being eliminated by the Seattle SuperSonics in Game 6, a double-overtime classic in which Olajuwon scored 49 points in the losing cause.|$|E

5|$|Like other bows, {{they lost}} {{importance}} {{with the introduction}} and increasing accuracy of guns. In some areas composite bows were still used and were further developed for leisure purposes. Later Turkish bows are specialized for flight archery (shooting for distance). Composite bows are <b>still</b> <b>made</b> and used in Korea and in China, and the tradition has been revived elsewhere. Modern replicas are available, often made with fiberglass bellies and backs with a natural or man-made core.|$|E
5|$|Simms won the {{starting}} job back in 1984, and Brunner was traded. The Giants had a resurgent season, highlighted by a second-half stretch where they won five of six games. Despite losing their last two to finish 9–7, they <b>still</b> <b>made</b> the playoffs. In the first round, they defeated the highly favored Los Angeles Rams 16–13 on the road before losing 21–10 to the eventual Super Bowl champion San Francisco 49ers. Simms threw for 4,044 yards, making him the first Giant to pass for 4,000 yards in a season.|$|E
5|$|The {{best known}} Welsh cheese is Caerphilly, named in 1831 but made long before that. Originally {{a method for}} storing excess milk until it could be brought to market, it was a moist cheese that would not last very long. Production of the cheese was halted due to milk {{rationing}} after World War II, although it was <b>still</b> <b>made</b> in England. There, the cheese was produced very quickly and sold early in its maturation process, creating a dryer cheese. In the 1970s, production of Caerphilly returned to Wales and over the following few decades {{a variety of new}} cheeses have also been produced in Wales.|$|E

5|$|The {{number of}} triarii {{were reduced to}} 600 per legion, forming 10 maniples of 60 men each. The triarii <b>still</b> <b>made</b> up the third line in the legion, behind {{the front line of}} hastati and the second line of principes, but the rorarii and accensi were phased out. Leves had been {{replaced}} with velites, who had a similar role but were also attached to principes and triarii.|$|E
5|$|The {{pharmaceutical}} company Rexar reformulated their popular weight loss drug Obetrol following its mandatory {{withdrawal from the}} market in 1973 under the Kefauver Harris Amendment to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act due to the results of the Drug Efficacy Study Implementation (DESI) program (which indicated a lack of efficacy). The new formulation simply replaced the two methamphetamine components with dextroamphetamine and amphetamine components of the same weight (the other two original dextroamphetamine and amphetamine components were preserved), preserved the Obetrol branding, and despite it utterly lacking FDA approval, it <b>still</b> <b>made</b> it onto the market and was marketed and sold by Rexar for a number of years.|$|E
5|$|Allen {{returned}} to Brunswick {{after the war}} and reopened the Planters' Hoe Company in association with George T. Lane. He ended the production of augers, which <b>still</b> <b>made</b> up a small percentage of production even after closing Millville Manufacturing. Allen put himself in charge of manufacturing and sales and he again secured a solid market share in the South. A prosperous trade resumed and was still strong at least until the 1880s. The company eventually expanded and began manufacturing lighter common hoes for the general public, adding to its heavy southern-style line of hoes. The Planters' Hoe Company was still a success as late as the 1890s, but it was extinct by the 1920s.|$|E

25|$|Maize, {{although}} sold steaming hot as a {{fast food}} in the market, is primarily produced for alcohol production. Heads of corn are cut up and boiled into a mash, which is then fermented and distilled using improvised <b>stills</b> <b>made</b> from cut oil drums. Because of the woody core of the cobs of corn, the alcohol produced contains high levels of methanol, which is toxic. It is known as lotoko or bompulo.|$|R

5|$|As well {{as being}} kept as pets, cats are also used in the {{international}} fur and leather industries for making coats, hats, blankets and stuffed toys; and shoes, gloves and musical instruments respectively (about 24 cats are {{needed to make a}} cat fur coat). This use has now been outlawed in the United States, Australia, and the European Union. Cat pelts have been used for superstitious purposes as part of the practise of witchcraft, and are <b>still</b> <b>made</b> into blankets in Switzerland as folk remedies believed to help rheumatism. In the Western intellectual tradition, the idea of cats as everyday objects have served to illustrate problems of quantum mechanics in the Schrödinger's cat thought experiment.|$|E
5|$|Every new Queen's Counsel created {{reduced the}} Serjeants in importance, since {{even the most}} junior QC took {{precedence}} over the most senior Serjeant. Although appointments were <b>still</b> <b>made</b> to the Serjeants-at-Law, the King's Serjeant and the King's Ancient Serjeant, and several Serjeants were granted patents of precedence which gave them superiority over QCs, the Victorian era saw a decline in appointments. The rule that all common law judges must be Serjeants was circumvented: anyone chosen to be a judge would be appointed a Serjeant, and immediately thereafter a judge. In 1834 Lord Brougham issued a mandate which opened up pleading in the Court of Common Pleas to every barrister, Serjeant or not, and this was followed for six years until the Serjeants successfully petitioned the Queen to overturn it as invalid.|$|E
5|$|Harris {{signed with}} the University of North Carolina Tar Heels to play for head coach Anson Dorrance. Due to {{national}} team commitments for the FIFA U-19 Women's World Cup in Thailand {{in the fall of}} 2004, Harris delayed her enrollment and did not start training with the Tar Heels until the spring of 2005. During one spring practice, a ball caught her right hand as she was warming up and shattered her thumb. After a surgery that inserted three pins in her thumb, she was put on the bench until the summer. At her first practice back with the Tar Heels in the summer of 2005, Harris tore her right anterior cruciate ligament, which kept her out for the entire 2005 season. Despite being hurt, Harris <b>still</b> <b>made</b> the 2006 Atlantic Coast Conference Academic Honor Roll team.|$|E
