25|$|If {{there are}} {{uncertain}} or incomplete clauses in the contract, and all options in resolving its true meaning have failed, {{it may be}} possible to sever and void just those affected clauses if the contract includes a <b>severability</b> clause. The test of whether a clause is severable is an objective test—whether a reasonable person would see the contract standing even without the clauses. Typically, non-severable contracts only require the substantial performance of a promise rather than the whole or complete performance of a promise to warrant payment. However, express clauses may be included in a non-severable contract to explicitly require the full performance of an obligation.|$|E
500|$|The court first {{addressed}} the VSDA's {{argument that the}} entire Act should be invalidated based on the defendant's concession on appeal that the definition of [...] "violent video game" [...] in the Act is unconstitutionally broad. However, the statute had a <b>severability</b> clause so the court went through the <b>severability</b> test set forth in Hotel Employees & Rest. Employees Int'l Union v. Davis. The {{court held that the}} definition for [...] "violent video game" [...] is grammatically and functionally separable because, as an alternative definition of [...] "violent video game," [...] it can be removed from the Act without affecting the wording or function of the Act's other provisions. Further, the definitions are volitionally separable because those sections were not of critical importance to the passage of the Act and the legislative body would have adopted the Act had it foreseen the partial invalidation of the statute. These definition sections were only included to avoid the possibility that a court would rule the terms unconstitutionally vague; the court found that the legislature would still have enacted the statute without this definition section.|$|E
500|$|The {{leadership}} of the Public Works Authority was torn over the new agency's mission. PWA could initiate its own construction projects, distribute money to other federal agencies to fund their construction projects, or make loans to states and localities to fund their construction projects. But many in the Roosevelt administration felt PWA should not spend money, for fear of worsening the federal deficit, and so funds flowed slowly. Furthermore, {{the very nature of}} construction (planning, specifications, and blueprints) also held up the disbursement of money. Harold Ickes, too, was determined to ensure that graft and corruption did not tarnish the agency's reputation and lead to loss of political support in Congress, and so moved cautiously in spending the agency's money. Although the U.S. Supreme Court would rule Title I of NIRA unconstitutional, the <b>severability</b> clause in the Act enabled the PWA to survive. Among the projects it funded between 1935 and 1939 are: [...] the USS Yorktown; USS Enterprise; the 30th Street railroad station in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; the Triborough Bridge; the port of Brownsville; Grand Coulee Dam; Boulder Dam; Fort Peck Dam; Bonneville Dam; and the Overseas Highway connecting Key West, Florida, with the mainland. The agency survived until 1943, when the Reorganization Act of 1939 consolidated most federal public works and work relief functions of the federal government into the new Federal Works Agency.|$|E
2500|$|Article 4 {{implies that}} the High Court may void a piece of {{legislation}} to the extent of its inconsistency with the Constitution. At present, it is unclear how the Court will apply this requirement. If, say, an entire piece of criminal legislation or one of its provisions is found to be void, a person alleged to have committed an offence created by the impugned legislation may be able to escape liability. To circumvent this, a test of <b>severability,</b> also known as the [...] "blue pencil" [...] test, has been established in the UK. If the unconstitutional parts of the legislation are severable from the constitutional parts, the latter are preserved and remain valid and enforceable. In Director of Public Prosecutions v. Hutchinson (1988), the House of Lords held that two forms of <b>severability</b> must be established for a law to be held partially valid– textual <b>severability</b> and substantial <b>severability.</b> A provision is textually severable if it remains grammatical and correct after severance. It is substantially severable if its substance after severance remains true to its [...] "legislative purpose, operation and effect". However, the court also recognized that a rigid adherence to the test of textual <b>severability</b> may result in unreasonable consequences. It may defeat legislation with a substantial purpose clearly within the lawmaker's power but, by oversight, which was written in a way that exceeded that scope of power. Hence, the [...] "blue pencil" [...] test may still apply to rescue a provision that is not textually severable {{as long as it does}} not alter the substantial purpose and effect of the impugned provision.|$|E
2500|$|After {{reversing}} that holding, Cummings {{disposed of}} the case by remanding it to district court and invoking the ordinance's <b>severability</b> provisions.

2500|$|While one paragraph, {{exempting}} {{the firm}} from liability for any harm {{caused by the}} representation or advice of its agents, {{could be seen as}} violating the anti-waiver provision, that did not invalidate the entire agreement due to the <b>severability</b> provisions elsewhere in the contract. Nor did the anti-waiver provision itself contain language that invalidated entire contracts that violated its terms, only [...] "ny condition, stipulation, or provision" [...] of an agreement that did. [...] "The stipulation to arbitrate is not one waiving compliance with the statute unless the statute be construed to forbid arbitration," [...] Swan wrote, [...] "a construction believed to be untenable for reasons hereafter stated." ...|$|E
2500|$|But Stevens's {{principal}} objection {{was that}} the Court had crafted {{a new kind of}} <b>severability</b> analysis. [...] He started with the premise that all legislative enactments are presumed to be valid, and may only be struck down in their entirety if the law is unconstitutional in [...] "all or nearly all of its applications," [...] or if the invalid provision cannot be severed from the remainder of the statute. [...] Neither of those conditions applied to the federal sentencing laws, Stevens observed, and so {{there was no need to}} adopt a third method of curing constitutional violations. [...] After all, according to the Sentencing Commission, 45% of criminal sentences involve no enhancements whatsoever, and not all of the rest would actually implicate a defendant's Sixth Amendment rights. [...] Furthermore, defendants may waive their jury-trial rights, and so it follows that they may also waive their Blakely rights in appropriate situations.|$|E
2500|$|It is clear, {{from the}} Schedule, Peninsular Malaysia {{states has the}} {{constitutional}} right to fees for permits and licences for extraction of any petroleum that is derived from their land and territorial waters. Anything beyond territorial waters, such as on the continental shelf, is entirely in federal hands. However, because exploration {{of oil and gas}} is approximately 150km from Kota Bharu and beyond the territorial water of Kelantan. Relying on that, Emeritus Professor Dr Shad Saleem Faruqi concludes Kelantan has no constitutional right to regulate it and to receive compensation for it. He further argued given the agreement deed to support Kelantan rights over royalties will render as unconstitutional and void under the doctrine of <b>severability</b> (constitutional parts of the law remain even if other parts are unconstitutional), as the Assignment by Kelantan gives to Petronas the ownership of all petroleum [...] "whether lying onshore or offshore of Malaysia" [...] was an overstatement, and Kelantan has no rights to what lies off the shores of the whole of Malaysia. Indeed, it is the rights of federal government guaranteed by constitution that extraterritorial operations are in their hands.|$|E
2500|$|Proponents of {{arbitration}} {{and other}} means of alternative dispute resolution {{have seen in the}} decision a reassuring reaffirmation of the separability principle that cleared up whether it covered a challenge to the legality of the underlying contract. [...] "While seemingly a mere reiteration of Prima Paints holding," [...] the International Institute for Conflict Prevention and Resolution (IICPR) wrote, [...] "the Buckeye decision both clarifies and expands an arbitrator's jurisdiction by adding potentially void contracts to an arbitrator’s domain and by unequivocally extending the <b>severability</b> and validity principles into state court." [...] The decision left open the question of whether it was still for the courts to decide if a contract had been properly formed, however, and some lower courts had denied motions to compel arbitration when that was the issue. Lawyers from the international arbitration department at White & Case praised the decision for making U.S. law [...] "consistent with current international arbitration case law and doctrine", under which separability has a stronger foundation than it does in the U.S. [...] " [...] avoids damage to the reputation of the United States as a 'safe' ...|$|E
2500|$|Richberg also {{returned}} to the NRA. NRA Administrator Hugh Johnson was showing signs of mental breakdown due to the extreme pressure and workload of running the National Recovery Administration. Johnson's increasingly erratic behavior, frequent policy about-faces, and abusive behavior toward subordinates aliented Richberg, who began asking President Roosevelt to fire or replace the Administrator. After two meetings with Roosevelt and an abortive resignation attempt, Johnson resigned on September 24, 1934. Three days later, Roosevelt replaced the position of Administrator with a new National Industrial Recovery Board, of which Richberg was named Executive Director. As head of the Board, however, Richberg engaged in double-dealing, lying to the President about the views of his subordinates and agreeing to his staff's requests that he raise issues with the President and later refusing to do so. [...] He also took increasingly pro-business policy stands. [...] For example, although {{a majority of the}} National Industrial Recovery Board had agreed to let the automobile industry code lapse (so that a new code might be negotiated) and to abolish the Automobile Labor Board, Richberg overruled the majority and persuaded Roosevelt to continue the status quo. Labor unions and the NRA staff were outraged. Nonetheless, when the chairmanship of the National Industrial Recovery Board came open in the spring of 1935, labor and most Roosevelt advisors grudgingly agreed to ask Roosevelt to name Richberg the new chairman. [...] With the NIRA due to sunset on June 15, 1935, Richberg went ahead with plans to reorganize NRA in order to improve the law's chances of reauthorization. But on May 27, 1935, the U.S. Supreme Court held Title I of the Act unconstitutional in Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States, 295 U.S. 495 (1935), making the issue moot. A <b>severability</b> clause enabled NRA to continue functioning to some degree, {{but the vast majority of}} its regulatory work was now no longer possible. President Roosevelt terminated the Board on June 15, 1935, and replaced it with an Administrator again. Richberg resigned the next day.|$|E

50|$|In law, <b>severability</b> (sometimes {{known as}} salvatorius, from Latin) {{refers to a}} {{provision}} in a contract which states that if parts of the contract are held to be illegal or otherwise unenforceable, {{the remainder of the}} contract should still apply. Sometimes, <b>severability</b> clauses will state that some provisions to the contract are so essential to the contract's purpose that if they are illegal or unenforceable, the contract as a whole will be voided. However, in many legal jurisdictions, a <b>severability</b> clause will not be applied if it changes the fundamental nature of the contract, and that instead the contract will be void; thus, often this is not explicitly stated in the <b>severability</b> clause.|$|E
