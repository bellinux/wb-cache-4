5|$|As a <b>seaside</b> resort Eastbourne derives a {{large and}} {{increasing}} income from tourism, with revenue from traditional <b>seaside</b> attractions augmented by conferences, public events and cultural sightseeing. The other main industries in Eastbourne include trade and retail, healthcare, education, construction, manufacturing, professional scientific and the technical sector.|$|E
5|$|The {{lighthouse}} {{is listed}} as a contributing property for Bridgeport's <b>Seaside</b> Park historic district, which was listed on July 1, 1982. The grounds are accessible by parking at <b>Seaside</b> Park and crossing a breakwater, but the lighthouse is not open to the public.|$|E
5|$|It {{is part of}} the Thanet {{district}} and forms part of the civil parish of Birchington. It lies on the coast facing the North Sea, east of the Thames Estuary, between the <b>seaside</b> resorts of Herne Bay and Margate. As a <b>seaside</b> resort, the village is a tourist and retirement destination. The village's Minnis Bay is a family beach with attractions such as sailing, windsurfing, a paddling pool and coastal walking routes. Its three smaller beaches are surrounded by chalk cliffs, cliff stacks and caves.|$|E
5|$|The {{electrolyte}} {{is usually}} iron(II) sulfate {{in urban areas}} (formed when atmospheric sulfur dioxide attacks iron), and salt particles in the atmosphere in <b>seaside</b> areas.|$|E
5|$|Two {{species of}} birds in the park {{are in danger of}} disappearing. The range of the Cape Sable <b>seaside</b> sparrow is {{restricted}} to Everglades National Park and the Big Cypress Swamp. In 1981 6,656 Cape Sable <b>seaside</b> sparrows were reported in park boundaries, but surveys over 10 years documented a decline to an estimated 2,624 birds by 2002. Attempts to return natural levels of water to the park have been controversial; Cape Sable <b>seaside</b> sparrows nest about a foot off the ground, and rising water levels may harm future populations, as well as threaten the endangered snail kite. The Everglades snail kite eats apple snails almost exclusively, and the Everglades is the only location in the United States where this bird of prey exists. There is some evidence that the population may be increasing, but loss of habitat and food sources keep the estimated number of these birds at several hundred.|$|E
5|$|Animals {{that are}} {{important}} to the marsh rice rat's diet include insects, fiddler crabs, and snails, but the species is known to eat many other animals, including fish, clams, and juvenile Graptemys and Chrysemys turtles. They scavenge on carcasses of muskrats, deermice, and sparrows, and {{may be the most important}} predator on eggs and young of the marsh wren. Rice rats also eat eggs and young of the <b>seaside</b> sparrow (Ammodramus maritimus) and are aggressive towards the sparrow, apparently leading it to avoid nesting in Juncus in a <b>seaside</b> salt marsh in Florida. On islands in North Carolina, rice rats consume eggs of Forster's tern (Sterna forsteri). They have been observed preying on alligator eggs in Georgia.|$|E
5|$|As {{his health}} declined, Waugh {{moved to the}} <b>seaside</b> town of New Brighton. On his death in 1890, his body was brought back {{to be buried in}} the {{graveyard}} of St. Paul's Church, {{on the edge of the}} moorland he loved so well.|$|E
5|$|Due to the town's {{traditional}} <b>seaside</b> appearance, it {{has often}} been used as a setting for television programmes and films. The seafront has been featured in programmes such as the ITV period drama Upstairs, Downstairs, the 1984 BBC <b>seaside</b> comedy Cockles, CBBC's The Tweenies and the BBC comedy Little Britain. The town's railway station was seen in an episode of the 1970s comedy Some Mothers Do 'Ave 'Em. The town has featured in movies such as Ken Russell's French Dressing, and The Medusa Touch, starring Richard Burton. In fiction, Jeeves from the stories by P. G. Wodehouse regularly holidays at the town, spending much of his time there fishing. Herne Bay was the hometown of the three main characters in the 1990s BBC sitcom, Game On.|$|E
5|$|Eastbourne's {{earliest}} {{claim as}} a <b>seaside</b> resort came about following a summer holiday visit by four of King George III's children in 1780 (Princes Edward and Octavius and Princesses Elizabeth and Sophia).|$|E
5|$|Holloway's stage {{career began}} in 1910, when he {{travelled}} to Walton-on-the-Naze {{to audition for}} The White Coons Show, a concert party variety show arranged and produced by Will C. Pepper, father of Harry S. Pepper, with whom Holloway later starred in The Co-Optimists. This <b>seaside</b> show lasted six weeks.|$|E
5|$|Several {{private schools}} exist in Galveston. The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Galveston-Houston {{operates}} two Roman Catholic private schools, including Holy Family Catholic School (K through 8th) and O'Connell College Preparatory School (9-12). Other private schools include Satori Elementary School, Trinity Episcopal School, <b>Seaside</b> Christian Academy, and Heritage Christian Academy.|$|E
5|$|The Royal Hotel in {{the area}} of Woodhill was {{designed}} and built to serve Brunel's railway line which finished a few steps away from the Hotel. The original building survives as The Royal Inn pub. It was built in 1830 by the Corporation of Bristol (now known as Bristol City Council) in order to provide a hotel supporting the development of the <b>seaside</b> resort. It is thought to be the only <b>seaside</b> hotel to be built by a public authority during the nineteenth century. It is a Grade II listed building.|$|E
5|$|The {{population}} of Somerset {{has continued to}} grow since 1800, when it was 274,000, particularly in the <b>seaside</b> towns such as Weston-super-Mare. Some population decline occurred earlier in the period in the villages, but this has now been reversed, and by 1951 the {{population of}} Somerset was 551,000.|$|E
5|$|After {{rounding}} Widmouth Head, {{the path}} passes 'The Coastguard Cottages' in Hele Bay {{and enters the}} <b>seaside</b> resort of Ilfracombe, with its small harbour, surrounded by cliffs. A seasonal foot passenger ferry service runs from the harbour to Lundy Island, and the Balmoral, the Waverley and pleasure boats ply to Porthcawl near Swansea. From Ilfracombe to Bideford the Tarka Trail coincides with the South West Coast Path.|$|E
5|$|Beginning {{with the}} {{construction}} of a pier and a promenade in the 19th century, Sheerness acquired the added attractions of a <b>seaside</b> resort. Industry retains its important place in the town and the Port of Sheerness is one of the United Kingdom's leading car and fresh produce importers. The town is the site of one of the UK's first co-operative societies and also of the world's first multi-storey buildings with a rigid metal frame.|$|E
5|$|Butlins Skegness (officially Butlins Resort Skegness), {{formerly}} Butlin's Skegness or Funcoast World; is {{a holiday}} camp located in Ingoldmells near Skegness in Lincolnshire, England. Sir William Butlin conceived of its creation {{based on his}} experiences at a Canadian summer camp in his youth and by observation {{of the actions of}} other holiday accommodation providers, both in <b>seaside</b> resort lodging houses and in earlier smaller holiday camps.|$|E
5|$|During the Victorian era Clevedon {{became a}} popular <b>seaside</b> town; before {{that it had}} been an {{agricultural}} village. The Victorian craze for bathing in the sea was catered for in the late 19th century by saltwater baths adjacent to the pier (since demolished, though the foundations remain), and bathing machines on the main beach.|$|E
5|$|During the Victorian era, Clevedon {{became a}} popular <b>seaside</b> town, having {{previously}} been an agricultural village. Due to improving transport links, via the Clevedon Branch Line, Clevedon {{was able to}} cater for the late 19th century craze for bathing in the sea with saltwater baths adjacent to the pier (since demolished, though the foundations can still be seen), and bathing machines on the main beach. Many English <b>seaside</b> resorts built piers in the 1850s to attract tourists. At Clevedon tourism grew following {{the opening of a}} branch line from Yatton railway station which connected it to the Bristol to Exeter Line, enabling travel {{from the rest of the}} country. It was also proposed that a pier could form part of a route from London to South Wales with the use of steamers to cross the Severn Estuary. An enabling act was submitted to parliament in 1864.|$|E
5|$|For every 100 females, {{there were}} 89.9 males. The age {{distribution}} was 6% aged 0–4years, 14% aged 5–15years, 4% aged 16–19years, 29% aged 20–44years, 25% aged 45–64years and 22% aged 65years and over. The town {{had a high}} percentage of residents over 65, compared with the national average of 16%. As a <b>seaside</b> town, Herne Bay is a popular retirement destination; many modern retirement complexes are located near the seafront.|$|E
5|$|For {{some time}} Butlin had nurtured {{the idea of}} a holiday camp. He had seen the way landladies in <b>seaside</b> resorts would, {{sometimes}} literally, push families out of the lodgings between meals, regardless of the weather. Butlin {{toyed with the idea of}} providing holiday accommodation that encouraged holiday-makers to stay on the site and even provided entertainment for them between meals.|$|E
5|$|In 1927 Butlin leased a {{piece of}} land from the Earl of Scarbrough by the <b>seaside</b> town of Skegness, where he set up an {{amusement}} park with hoopla stalls, a tower slide, a haunted house ride and, in 1928, a miniature railway and Dodgem carsthese were the first bumper cars in Britain, as Butlin had an exclusive license to import them.|$|E
5|$|Major {{sporting}} {{and entertainment}} venues {{are concentrated in}} Kingston upon Hull, while the <b>seaside</b> and market towns support semi-professional and amateur sports clubs and provide seasonal entertainment for visitors. Bishop Burton {{is the site of}} an agricultural college, and Hull provides the region's only university. On the southern border, close to Hull, the Humber Bridge spans the Humber Estuary to enable the A15 to link Hessle with Barton-upon-Humber in North Lincolnshire.|$|E
5|$|Most {{of these}} {{projects}} were focused in Brussels, where he constructed two large palaces, and Ostende, where a vast colonnaded arcade was built along the seafront {{in an attempt to}} turn the town into a fashionable <b>seaside</b> resort. During Leopold's reign, Belgium hosted five prestigious World Exhibitions, in 1885, 1888, 1894, 1897 and 1905, as well as a major national exhibition in 1880 to mark the 50th anniversary of Belgian independence.|$|E
5|$|On 20 February 1988, the Nagorno-Karabakh Supreme Council (the {{regional}} legislature) {{issued a}} request to transfer the region from Soviet Azerbaijan to Soviet Armenia. The Moscow government declined the claims, while {{hundreds of thousands of}} people demonstrated in Yerevan in support of the idea. Few days later, on 26 February, an anti-Armenian pogrom broke out in the Azerbaijani <b>seaside</b> industrial city Sumgait, forcing thousands of Armenians to leave Azerbaijan en masse.|$|E
5|$|On December 26, 2004, Carradine {{married the}} widowed Annie Bierman (née Anne Kirstie Fraser, born December 21, 1960) at the <b>seaside</b> Malibu {{home of his}} friend, Michael Madsen. Vicki Roberts, his {{attorney}} and {{a longtime friend of}} his wife's, performed the ceremony. With this marriage he acquired three stepdaughters, Amanda Eckelberry (born 1989), Madeleine Rose (born 1995), and Olivia Juliette (born 1998) as well as a stepson, actor Max Richard Carradine (born 1998).|$|E
5|$|Race meetings, concert parties (including drag acts– good drag queens were {{in great}} demand), {{trips to the}} <b>seaside</b> and {{football}} matches were organised to keep men entertained. There were various unofficial publications, including the “Wipers Times”– these give an insight into the views of ordinary soldiers and junior officers. Overt patriotism was rare, and politicians such as (Prime Minister) Asquith and Ramsay MacDonald (an opponent of the war, later Labour Prime Minister) were satirised.|$|E
5|$|Synge's father {{contracted}} smallpox {{and died}} in 1872 {{at the age of}} 49. Synge's mother moved the family to the house next door to her mother's house in Rathgar, County Dublin. Synge, although often ill, had a happy childhood there. He developed an interest in bird-watching {{along the banks of the}} River Dodder and during family holidays at the <b>seaside</b> resort of Greystones, County Wicklow, and the family estate at Glanmore.|$|E
5|$|Tange's {{interest}} in urban studies {{put him in}} a good position to handle post war reconstruction. In the summer of 1946 he was invited by the War Damage Rehabilitation Board to put forward a proposal for certain war damaged cities. He submitted plans for Hiroshima and Maebashi. His design for an airport in Kanon, Hiroshima was accepted and built, but a <b>seaside</b> park in Ujina was not.|$|E
5|$|The Hastings line {{is built}} over the difficult, forested, and hilly terrain across the High Weald and {{sandstone}} Hastings Beds, necessitating the construction of eight tunnels between Tonbridge and the south coast <b>seaside</b> resort of Hastings. The SER was anxious to construct the line as economically as possible, since it was in competition with the LBSC to obtain entry into Hastings and {{was not in a}} strong financial position in the mid 1840s.|$|E
5|$|The age {{distribution}} was 5% aged 0–4years, 13% aged 5–15years, 5% aged 16–19years, 28% aged 20–44years, 22% aged 45–64years and 27% aged 65years and over. There {{was a high}} percentage of residents over 65, compared with the national average of 16%, mainly due to <b>seaside</b> towns being popular retirement destinations. For every 100 females, there were 85.7 males.|$|E
5|$|The army's two battalions {{were located}} in {{separate}} bases. The 1st Battalion is based at Baucau, with a contingent in the <b>seaside</b> coastline village of Laga. The 2nd Battalion is stationed at the Nicolau Lobato Training Centre near Metinaro. Almost all of the 2nd Battalion's soldiers were dismissed during the 2006 crisis. The 2011 edition of Jane's Sentinel put the total strength of the Army at 1,300.|$|E
5|$|The {{opening of}} the railway {{dramatically}} ended Chesham's isolation. Commuting to London became possible for the first time, as did affordable excursions to the <b>seaside</b> resorts on {{the south and east}} coasts. The products of the area's industries and farms could for the first time be shipped cheaply to the markets of London, and London newspapers arrived each morning at 7.28am, in time for delivery.|$|E
5|$|The son of {{a schoolteacher}} who played for Waverley Cricket Club in Sydney as a fast bowler, Morris was born in 1922 in the Sydney <b>seaside</b> suburb of Bondi and spent his early years in the city. His family moved when he was five to Dungog, then to Newcastle before {{returning}} to Sydney in the suburb of Beverly Hills. By this time, Morris' parents had separated.|$|E
5|$|The town's low {{rainfall}} and ample sunshine made it popular as a <b>seaside</b> resort, with tourists arriving by steamboat and train. The Sheppey Light Railway opened in 1901, connecting the new Sheerness East station {{with the rest}} of the island. However, by 1950, lack of demand led to the railway's closure. The Sheerness and District Tramways, which opened in 1903, only lasted until 1917.|$|E
5|$|This {{waterfront}} {{development is}} now known as Port Marine. The area has varied styles of housing, including an area built in the style of a fishing village, which is modelled on the Cornish <b>seaside</b> town of Polperro with narrow streets and multi-coloured houses. New waterside bars and restaurants, including Hall & Woodhouse, Aqua and Bottelinos have opened around the marina, with further outlets are set to open in the future, including Costa Coffee and a nearby Wetherspoons.|$|E
5|$|Thompson {{was absent}} from screens in 1996, but {{returned}} {{the following year}} with Alan Rickman's directorial debut, The Winter Guest. Set over one day in a Scottish <b>seaside</b> village, the drama allowed Thompson and her mother (Phyllida Law) to play mother and daughter on screen. She then returned to America to appear in an episode of Ellen, and her self-parodying performance received a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series.|$|E
