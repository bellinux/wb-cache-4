50|$|The Control Arms Coalition is a {{campaign}} jointly {{run by a}} coalition of over 100 organisations including Amnesty International, IANSA, Oxfam International and <b>Saferworld.</b> The campaign has been active since 2003 in calling for an international Arms Trade Treaty (ATT). The campaign began {{due to the lack of}} regulation in the international trade in arms. Control Arms has argued that the lack of controls on the arms trade is fuelling armed conflict, poverty and human rights abuses worldwide. Even though existing treaties and pieces of international law exist that focus on the international arms trade, none of them, before the Arms Trade Treaty, were legally binding and fully international.|$|E
50|$|Gethins {{was born}} in Glasgow and brought up in Perth. He was educated at Perth Academy. He {{graduated}} with a Bachelor of Laws degree from the University of Dundee in 1998, specialising in public international law. He also holds a Master of Research from the University of Kent.

5000|$|Cost of Conflict {{is a tool}} which {{attempts}} to calculate the price of conflict to the human race. The idea is to examine this cost, {{not only in terms}} of the deaths and casualties and the economic costs borne by the people involved, but also the social, developmental, environmental and strategic costs of conflict. In most cases organizations measure and analyze the economic and broader [...] costs of conflict. While this conventional method of assessing the impact of conflict is fairly in-depth, it does not provide a comprehensive overview of a country or region embroiled in conflict. One of the earliest studies assessing the true cost of conflict on a variety of parameters was commissioned by <b>Saferworld</b> and compiled by Michael Cranna. Strategic Foresight Group has taken this science to a new level by developing a multi-disciplinary methodology, that has been applied to most parts of the world. A key benefit of using this tool is to encourage people to look at conflict in new ways and to widen public discussion of the subject, and to bring new insights to the debate on global security.|$|E
