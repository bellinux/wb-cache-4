5|$|Hańska {{wrote to}} Balzac {{several times during}} 1832. On 7 November she posted a seven-page letter filled with praise and flattery:Your soul embraces centuries, Monsieur; its {{philosophical}} concepts {{appear to be the}} fruit of long study matured by time; yet I am told that you are still young. I would like to know you, but feel that I have no need to do <b>so.</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> you through my own spiritual instinct; I picture you in my own way and feel that were I to set eyes upon you I should exclaim, 'That is he!' Your outward semblance probably does not reveal your brilliant imagination; you have to be moved, the sacred fire of genius has to be lit, if you are to show yourself as you really are, and you are what I feel you to be—a man superior in his knowledge of the human heart.|$|E
500|$|With {{no return}} address, Balzac {{was left to}} reply in the Gazette de France, {{with the hope that}} she would see the notice. She did not, but wrote again in November: [...] "Your soul embraces centuries, monsieur; its {{philosophical}} concepts appear to be the fruit of long study matured by time; yet I am told you are still young. I would like to know you, but feel I have no need to do <b>so.</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> you through my own spiritual instinct; I picture you in my own way, and feel that if I were to actually set eyes upon you, I should instantly exclaim, 'That is he!'" ...|$|E
500|$|The show's writers admire Grammer's singing voice, and try {{to include}} a song for each appearance. Alf Clausen, the primary {{composer}} for The Simpsons, commented that [...] " [...] is so great. He's just amazing. You can tell he has this love of musical theater {{and he has the}} vocal instrument to go with it, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> whatever I write is going to be sung the way I've heard it." [...] Clausen composed Sideshow Bob's theme, which is played whenever Bob gets out of prison or is about to commit a sinister action, and was first used in [...] "Cape Feare". It is based on the score of the film Cape Fear, composed by Bernard Herrmann. The musical score for [...] "Cape Feare" [...] earned Clausen an Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Dramatic Underscore– Series in 1994.|$|E

500|$|American actor Kelsey Grammer {{was brought}} in to guest star as Sideshow Bob for the third time. At that time, Grammer had become a {{household}} name as the lead of the television series Frasier, which was in production {{at the same time as}} this episode. Grammer did not know that the rake scene was extended, because he had only done the moan once and was surprised when he saw the final product. The show's writers admire Grammer's singing voice, and try to include a song for each appearance including this episode. Alf Clausen, the primary composer for The Simpsons, commented that [...] " [...] is so great. He's just amazing. You can tell he has this love of musical theater and he has the vocal instrument to go with it, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> whatever I write is going to be sung the way I've heard it." ...|$|E
500|$|Renewal was {{uncertain}} {{until after the}} finale aired. In April, actor Enrico Colantoni, who plays Keith, stated regarding renewal, Unofficially, everyone at CBS and Warner Bros is saying, [...] "Yeah, no worries!" [...] But you know, those are always famous last words. And then last year they told us two days after we wrapped, and they {{got a lot of}} criticism over that. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> they're not gonna make that mistake again. They're gonna wait until May. Colantoni also expressed optimism towards the show's future on The CW, believing {{that it would be a}} chance for the show to get more exposure. On May 15, before the official press release was announced, it was believed that The CW had ordered 13 episodes of Veronica Mars. Later, it was revealed that the series had been renewed for a 22-episode season, but that the season could be shortened if ratings were poor.|$|E
2500|$|The next radio {{message from}} Sophia came at 17:20: [...] "For God's sake, hurry, {{the water is}} in my room." [...] There was more but the radio {{operator}} could not pick it up. [...] Knowing [...] Sophia had weak wireless batteries, Cedar wired Sophia to conserve battery power and only transmit if absolutely necessary. [...] Sophias operator radioed back: [...] "Alright I will. [...] You talk to me <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> you are coming." [...] This was the last wireless message from Sophia.|$|E

2500|$|On May 9, 2007, {{homeless}} shelters across Tennessee received massive numbers of vegetarian pizzas from {{people all over}} the country honoring Workman's last meal request. [...] "Philip Workman was trying to do a good deed and no one would help him," [...] said one woman who, together with friends, donated $1200 worth of pizzas to Nashville's Rescue Mission. [...] People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) President Ingrid Newkirk, who donated 15 veggie pizzas, commented that [...] "Workman's act was selfless, and kindness to all living beings is a virtue." [...] Marvin Champion, an employee of Nashville's Rescue Mission, remarked [...] "I used to be homeless, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> how rough it gets. I seen some bad times – not having enough food, the cupboards are bare. But we got pizza to feed enough people for a while." ...|$|E
2500|$|As {{she came}} from a strong legal background, her family [...] "weren't wildly happy" [...] about her desire to become an actress: [...] "My parents were always making me watch Rumpole of the Bailey, going 'You see? It’s just like acting, you make things up, you wear a wig and a funny outfit. Why not the law?' But I just always, always wanted to act, {{as far back as}} I remember." [...] Her joining the Royal Shakespeare Company though, finally won her parents over. However, in a 2004 {{interview}} Oberman noted that her father's death seven years earlier prevented his seeing the development of her career and her national success as an actor: [...] "I've {{come a long way in}} my career since he died and I wish he was here to see it. He was a big EastEnders fan <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> he'd be very, very proud of me." ...|$|E
2500|$|At the D8 conference {{hosted by}} [...] on June 2, 2010, host Kara Swisher told Zuckerberg {{she knew he}} was not happy with The Social Network being based on him, to which he replied, [...] "I just wished that nobody made a movie of me while I was still alive." [...] Zuckerberg stated to Oprah Winfrey that the drama and partying of the film is mostly fiction, {{explaining}} [...] "this is my life, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> it's not so dramatic," [...] and that he spent most of the past six years focusing, working hard, and coding Facebook. Speaking to an audience at Stanford University, Zuckerberg stated that the film portrayed his motivations for creating Facebook inaccurately; instead of an effort to [...] "get girls", he says he created the site because he enjoys [...] "building things". However, he added that the film accurately depicted his real-life wardrobe, saying, [...] "It's interesting the stuff that they focused on getting right – like every single shirt and fleece they had in that movie is actually a shirt or fleece that I own." ...|$|E

2500|$|That {{is such a}} {{difficult}} question. There are times when certain people are blessed—and cursed—with an extraordinary gift, in which the gift is almost greater than the human being. Callas {{was one of these}} people. It was as if her own wishes, her life, her own happiness were all subservient to this incredible, incredible gift that she was given, this gift that reached out and taught us things about music that we knew very well, but showed us new things, things we never thought about, new possibilities. I think that is why singers admire her so. I think that's why conductors admire her <b>so.</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> it's why I admire her so. And she paid a tremendously difficult and expensive price for this career. I don't think she always understood what she did or why she did it. She usually had a tremendous effect on audiences and on people. But it was not something she could always live with gracefully or happily. I once said to her [...] "It must be a very enviable thing to be Maria Callas." [...] And she said, [...] "No, it's a very terrible thing to be Maria Callas, because it's a question of trying to understand something you can never really understand." [...] She couldn't really explain what she did. It was all done by instinct. It was something embedded deep within her.|$|E
