60|$|Taxes {{are either}} direct or indirect. A direct tax is {{one which is}} demanded from the very persons who, it is {{intended}} or desired, should pay it. Indirect taxes are those which are demanded from {{one person in the}} expectation and intention that he <b>shall</b> <b>indemnify</b> himself at the expense of another: such as the excise or customs. The producer or importer of a commodity is called upon to pay tax on it, not with the intention to levy a peculiar contribution upon him, but to tax through him the consumers of the commodity, from whom it is supposed that he will recover the amount by means of an advance in price.|$|E

5000|$|An {{example of}} letting the indemnitor control costs is (in this case a {{contractor}} for a homeowners association-HOA), [...] "Contractor <b>shall</b> <b>indemnify,</b> defend (by counsel reasonably acceptable to Association) and hold harmless the Association" [...] Companies and HOAs also use indemnity to protect directors, since few would serve as directors if their risks were not indemnified. Negotiation is important for both parties, [...] "Just about all homeowner association management contracts have a provision which states that the HOA <b>shall</b> <b>indemnify</b> the manager under certain circumstances...

Indemnity can be extremely costly, since X's liability insurance typically does not cover claims against Y, but X still has to cover them.|$|R

40|$|I]f the assured is not {{entitled}} to retain an excess against the insurer, and the insurer … is not entitle to receive the excess from the assured, {{what happens to the}} excess?” This question, posed by Lord Justice Megaw in L. Lucas Ltd. v. Export Credits Guarantee Department, is bred by the juxtaposition of two subrogation rules. The right to subrogation, being in nature like restitution, entitles the holder of the right only to reimbursement and, under a contract of insurance, “the assured … <b>shall</b> be fully <b>indemnified,</b> but <b>shall</b> never be more than fully indemnified. ” The confusion that distribution of windfall profits in subrogation has brought to American and English courts derives from both the difficulty of the question and its rarity. Because insurance agreements are contracts of indemnity, the issue of which party is entitled to any possible excess once both the insurer and the insured have been indemnified has seldom been litigated. This comment will evaluate a subrogee’s right to recover more than it paid to the subrogor. The purpose of subrogation and insurance will be outlined, focusing on those few recent cases in England and the United States dealing with the profit-in-subrogation issue. Next, this Comment will examine the circumstances under which a windfall might accrue to the insurer and the possible justifications and consequences of such a windfall award. A flexible approach for courts confronted with allocating a windfall in an equitable subrogation suit will then be proposed. Finally the implications of choosing a flexible approach to windfalls in subrogation will be contrasted with the view that the windfall be awarded strictly to either the insured or the insurer...|$|R
