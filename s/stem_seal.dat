40|$|The {{reliability}} of a valve <b>stem</b> <b>seal</b> (VSS) {{is directly related}} to its ability to deliver the correct rate of lubrication. Too little lubrication may result in valve stem wear; too much may result in ‘burnt’ valves and seats.

This paper discusses the use of accumulative leakage measurements to study the life performance of a VSS as changes are made to ‘key’ design sealing features. A standard design VSS is used for ‘normal’ leakage bench marking.

40|$|Abstract: The {{simulation}} of oil leakage through a valve <b>stem</b> <b>seal</b> involves complex fluid-structure interaction between a moving valve stem (rigid body), oil and deformable seal (flexible body). In the simulation {{we used a}} full 3 D model of a seal and considered a two-way fluid-structure coupling between the seal (structure) and oil (fluid). The seal deformation is modeled with Abaqus-explicit and oil leakage with FlowVision (finite volume based CFD code). The calculation domain is descretized by a volume Cartesian grid with dynamic local adaptation and uses a Euler grid approach for {{simulation of}} the moving boundary. At each physical time step the simulation domain is re-meshed and loads are exchanged between Abaqus and FlowVision(FV). Pressure values calculated by FV are transferred to Abaqus-explicit to calculate the resulting seal deformation. The data is automatically exchanged using Capvidia’s Multi-Physics-Manager (MPM). The MPM links FV with Abaqus and transfers data via Abaqus user-subroutines. The approach described above allows us to perform {{detailed analysis of the}} oil leakage through a valve stem for various engine loads and operational conditions.

40|$|Abstract. In {{orthopedic}} surgery {{and particularly in}} the total hip arthroplasty, the stem fixation is performed in general using a surgical cement which consists essentially of polymer(PMMA). Fracture of cement and prosthesis loosening appears after a high-stress level. This phenomenon origin is due to the presence of micro-cavities in the PMMA volume. The focus of our study is the modeling using the finite-element method of the cement damage around these cavities, the cavities' sizes and shapes effect on the damage risk, and the crack length estimation due to this damage. A small Fortran schedule was incorporated with the Abaqus code to calculate the damage zone. Results show that the presence of a cavity in the cement increases the damage parameter. The damage appears when the cavity is located in cement on the loading axis. If the cavity changes its shape from circular to elliptical, the size of the damage zone increases. One can predict the initiation of a crack in cement with a maximal length of 70 µm. Introduction.

50|$|A {{multi-valve}} engine design typically has three, four, or five valves per cylinder to achieve improved performance. Any four-stroke {{internal combustion engine}} needs at least two valves per cylinder: one for intake of air and fuel, and another for exhaust of combustion gases. Adding more valves increases valve area and improves the flow of intake and exhaust gases, thereby enhancing combustion, volumetric efficiency, and power output. Multi-valve geometry allows the spark plug to be ideally located within the combustion chamber for optimal flame propagation. Multi-valve engines tend to have smaller valves that have lower reciprocating mass, which can reduce wear on each cam lobe, and allow more power from higher RPM without the danger of valve bounce. Some engines are designed to open each intake valve at a slightly different time, which increases turbulence, improving the mixing of air and fuel at low engine speeds. More valves also provide additional cooling to the cylinder head. The disadvantages of {{multi-valve engine}}s are an increase in manufacturing cost and a potential increase in oil consumption due to the greater number of valve <b>stem</b> <b>seals.</b> Some SOHC multi-valve engines (such as the Mazda B8-ME) use a single fork-shaped rocker arm to drive two valves (generally the exhaust valves) so that fewer cam lobes will be {{needed in order to}} reduce manufacturing costs.|$|R

In a first series of experiments, fluid flow along {{the interface between}} bone cement and well-fixed model femoral components, differing in surface finish, and in shape, was measured. Fluid migration along the bone-cement interface of rough stems (Ra 3 microm) was greater than that on polished stems (p < 0. 001). This was true of cylindrical and conical tapered stems. On stems with the same surface finish, shape did not influence fluid migration. In a second series of experiments, fluid flow along the stem-cement interface of 5 highly polished and 10 rough-finished (5 of Ra approximately 1. 5 microm and 5 of Ra approximately 3 microm), debonded, tapered circular stems was measured. None of the rough stems could prevent fluid flow along the stem-cement interface.

Varying oil consumption rates and their effect on particulates were analyzed at selected operation conditions of the CARB 8 -mode test cycle. The three steady-state engine operating conditions tested were mode 4 (1200 RPM, 25 % load), mode 5 (1200 RPM, 100 % load), and mode 1 (1800 RPM, 100 % load).

Each of these alterations was tested individually to avoid causing interacting effects. LOC rates were successfully quantified by measuring the calcium concentration in the exhaust particulates.

40|$|As implant {{survival}} extends {{into the}} second and third decades focal osteolysis around cemented femoral components in total hip replacement is emerging as an important failure mechanism. Whilst the problem of focal osteolysis is well recognised, there are many aspects of its development which are poorly understood. The broad aim of this thesis is to try to provide some insights into how, why and where focal osteolysis develops around the cemented femoral component. There are broadly two sections to this thesis, chapters 2 - 5 present clinical and geometrical studies and chapters 6 - 10 a series of experimental studies. The aim of the first section was to establish what is observed in clinical practice, the aim of the second to try to explain these findings. A mid-term clinical study showed that focal osteolysis is more common with rough than polished stems that differed in no aspect other than their surface finish. Further studies established that focal osteolysis is probably always associated with defects in the cement mantle. These defects occur anteriorly at the mid-stem of the prosthesis and posteriorly at the component tip. The distribution of focal osteolysis and its strong association with cement mantle defects suggests the importance of the stemcement interface as a pathway for fluid and debris to reach the distal femur. However, at 15 - 25 years, osteolysis rarely develops with the polished Exeter stem even in the presence of confirmed defects in the cement mantle, suggesting that the <b>stem</b> <b>seals</b> the stem-cement interface against fluid and debris. In an attempt to explain the clinical findings a series of bench top experiments were undertaken. These studies showed that the behaviour of fluid and dye at the stemcement interface was significantly influenced by component surface finish. Bonded and debonded stem-cement interfaces of rough stems provided an incomplete barrier to fluid movement along this interface. In contrast, polished stems both bonded and debonded were able to provide a seal at the stem-cement interface. The seal at this interface was improved with component subsidence in the presence of rotational stability. It is believed that this thesis provides a rationale explanation for why focal osteolysis rarely develops around the Exeter stem in clinical practice. It also explains how, where, and why osteolysis develops around certain designs of cemented femoral components used in total hip replacement. </p...|$|R
