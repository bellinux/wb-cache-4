The {{awareness}} of health risks on board ships {{in terms of}} knowledge of dangers and discomfort at the workplace, and of risks of contracting communicable diseases including those related to food hygiene was assessed {{in a sample of}} workers of an Italian <b>shipping</b> <b>company.</b> Analysis was performed on crew members and on ashore personnel of the same firm to assess possible differences in risk perception.

The study was conducted by proposing an anonymous questionnaire to the crew members of 9 tankers and to the office staff of the <b>shipping</b> <b>company</b> Finaval <b>S.</b> p. A., which has its headquarters in Rome. Results. People living ashore have a better knowledge of infectious risks than seafarers. Both ashore workers and seafarers have a reasonable {{awareness of}} blood-borne and sexually-transmitted diseases. Seafarers are more concerned about the risks of psychological problems due to isolation than are office personnel. The risk of not being adequately cared for in case of disease or injury on board is also perceived as a major problem by seafarers. Ashore personnel, eating raw fish more than their mates on board, are at a greater risk of communicable gastrointestinal diseases. Conclusions. Seafarers should be the target of specific informative campaigns about health risks, possible consequences, and how to minimize exposure to them during travel/life at sea...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND AND AIM: The aim of {{the study}} was to {{evaluate}} the knowledge and attitudes on food hygiene in seafarers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was conducted using an anonymous questionnaire presented to the workers of 7 tankers of an Italian <b>shipping</b> <b>company</b> (Finaval <b>S.</b> p. A.). As a reference, the analysis was extended to office employees of the same firm. Data were divided according to the rank of seafarers to assess possible differences in perceiving the risk. RESULTS: Overall knowledge on food safety concept was not high among seafarers. In general, galley and catering workers group provided a lower percentage of correct answers than other crew members. Foodservices staff revealed little awareness of the risks linked with handling food and their perception of risk of disease transmission through food was low. Answers about risk related to specific food (eggs and fish) showed that knowledge about these problems was less than satisfactory. Moreover, the percentage of 'I don't know' answers was high. These findings suggest that this personnel is aware of the right stepsof health protection in terms of food hygiene, but does not understand why it is necessary. CONCLUSIONS: Galley and catering group workers were not the most informed about food hygiene problems. This highlights the need to hire qualified personnel of the food industry on board ships. All those working inthe food service area should be properly trained on food hygiene. Seafarers should be the target of specificinformative campaigns about health risks linked with aliments, possible consequences of it and also oneson how to minimise the exposure to potentially dangerous agents/behaviours during travel/life at sea...|$|R
