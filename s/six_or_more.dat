Luidia ciliaris has seven arms, members of the Solasteridae have ten to fifteen while the Antarctic Labidiaster annulatus can have up to fifty.

5|$|Incapillo {{is part of}} the Andean Central Volcanic Zone, {{which extends}} through the {{countries}} of Chile, Bolivia, and Argentina and includes <b>six</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> Quaternary caldera or ignimbrite systems, about 44 stratovolcanoes, and over 18 smaller centres. One of these stratovolcanoes, Ojos del Salado, is the world's highest volcano. This zone also includes the Altiplano-Puna volcanic complex and the Galan caldera farther south. Incapillo is the southernmost volcano of the Central Volcanic Zone with Pleistocene activity; the next such volcano to the south is Tupungato in the Southern Volcanic Zone at 33° southern latitude.|$|E
5|$|It is {{estimated}} that two billion cases of gastroenteritis resulted in 1.3million deaths globally in 2015. Children {{and those in the}} developing world are most commonly affected. As of 2011, in those below age five, there were about 1.7billion cases resulting in about 700,000 deaths. In the developing world children less than two years of age frequently get <b>six</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> infections a year. It is less common in adults, partly due to the development of immunity.|$|E

5|$|The NL {{race was}} tight {{throughout}} the 1959 season between the Braves, Dodgers, and San Francisco Giants. Neither the Giants nor the Braves ever fell {{five or more}} games back of the league leader, and the Dodgers never faced a deficit of <b>six</b> <b>or</b> <b>more.</b> The Dodgers had {{the best record in}} games played amongst the three, posting a combined 26–18 record against the other two before the tie-breaker. However, the Dodgers spent just 21 days with at least a share of the lead while the Braves and Giants each led the league for 86 days.|$|E
5|$|The {{music of}} folk metal is characterised by its {{diversity}} with bands known to perform {{different styles of}} both heavy metal music and folk music. A large variety of folk instruments {{are used in the}} genre with many bands consequently featuring <b>six</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> members in their regular line-ups. A few bands are also known to rely on keyboards to simulate the sound of folk instruments. Lyrics in the genre commonly deal with fantasy, mythology, paganism, history and nature.|$|E
5|$|It is {{estimated}} {{that there were two}} billion cases of gastroenteritis that resulted in 1.3million deaths globally in 2015. Children and those in the developing world are most commonly affected. As of 2011, in those less than five, there were about 1.7billion cases resulting in 0.7million deaths, with most of these occurring in the world's poorest nations. More than 450,000 of these fatalities are due to rotavirus in children under 5years of age. Cholera causes about three to five million cases of disease and kills approximately 100,000 people yearly. In the developing world, children less than two years of age frequently get <b>six</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> infections a year that result in significant gastroenteritis. It is less common in adults, partly due to the development of acquired immunity.|$|E

5|$|The {{large number}} of {{instruments}} that some bands rely on in recording their studio albums can be a hindrance for live performances. While Orphaned Land are able to perform onstage with twenty musicians in their homeland of Israel, they {{have to rely on}} a computer to replicate the roles of the guest musicians for concerts elsewhere. Some folk metal acts confine themselves to studio recordings and are not known to perform any live concerts. This includes Folkearth, and Falkenbach. Other folk metal bands expand their regular roster to include more musicians and consequently, {{it is not uncommon to}} find bands in the genre featuring <b>six</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> members in their line-up. Some of the sextets in the genre are Schandmaul, Cruachan, Korpiklaani, Turisas, and Midnattsol, while septets include Ithilien, Subway to Sally, In Extremo, and Lumsk. Both Silent Stream of Godless Elegy and Eluveitie boast eight members each while the line up of Mägo de Oz totals nine performers. Even when a band includes members dedicated to folk instruments, they might still rely on guest musicians to further enhance their sound. As an example, Lumsk added thirteen guest musicians to the band's seven members on their debut album Åsmund Frægdegjevar. At times, guest musicians are known to become full-fledged members of the band, as was the case in Skyforger and Turisas.|$|E
