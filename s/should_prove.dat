5|$|Love in Several Masques was Fielding's first play, and {{was first}} {{released}} on 16 February 1728. Though {{the play was}} never revived and only ran for four nights, it still did moderately well especially {{when compared with the}} competing plays at that time. In the play, three respectable males each meet a female counterpart three times, and share a parallel incident with letters and an unmasking. Fielding focuses on men and how he believes they <b>should</b> <b>prove</b> their worth before marriage. It also highlights Fielding's belief in the relationship of morality and libertine beliefs and introduces character types that Fielding would use throughout his plays and novels.|$|E
5|$|Following Desai's {{resignation}} {{and the fall}} of the Janata government headed by him, Reddy appointed Charan Singh as Prime Minister. This was on the condition that he <b>should</b> <b>prove</b> his majority {{on the floor of the}} House before the end of August. Singh was sworn in on 28 July 1979 but never faced Parliament to prove his majority when Reddy convened it on 20 August. Reddy had appointed him Prime Minister since he had produced a letter claiming to have a parliamentary majority with the support of the opposition Congress Party led by his rival, the former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. In return for her support, Gandhi demanded that a law establishing special courts to try her and her son Sanjay Gandhi be repealed – a proposition that was unacceptable to Charan Singh. Gandhi therefore withdrew her support, forcing Singh to resign. His government lasted 24 days and he never faced Parliament. The convention of appointing a Prime Minister in a hung House but with conditions on time to prove majority was later adopted by President R Venkataraman.|$|E
5|$|The five reel {{film was}} {{released}} through the Pathé Exchange as a Pathé Gold Rooster Play on October 7, 1917. Charles E. Wagner of the Exhibitor's Trade Review {{found it to}} be a good film with great direction and photography, but was concerned that the stunt in which the baby appeared {{to be involved in the}} accident was too real. Wagner stated the film had sufficient action and pathos without sexual suggestiveness; which <b>should</b> <b>prove</b> a strong program for the Pathé program. Frances Agnew of The Morning Telegraph {{found it to be}} an average picture that was not exceptional for audiences, but it would hold sentimental appeal for the average viewer. A reviewer for The New York Dramatic Mirror found the film's excessive use of coincidental meetings to be highly improbable, but found Warde's performance to be excellent and the rest of the cast give good performances. The reviewer said that Emile Chautard had made the improbable story more plausible.|$|E

25|$|Further genetic {{research}} {{is necessary to}} identify and rule out other possible loci contributing to EEC syndrome, though it seems certain that disruption of the p63 gene is involved to some extent. In addition, {{genetic research}} {{with an emphasis on}} genetic syndrome differentiation <b>should</b> <b>prove</b> to be very useful in distinguishing between syndromes that present with very similar clinical findings. There is much debate in current literature regarding clinical markers for syndromic diagnoses. Genetic findings could have great implications in clinical diagnosis and treatment of not only EEC, but also many other related syndromes.|$|E

25|$|The {{close of}} the First Civil War left England and Scotland in the hands {{potentially}} of {{any one of the}} four parties or any combination of two or more that <b>should</b> <b>prove</b> strong enough to dominate the rest. Armed political Royalism was indeed at an end, but Charles, though practically a prisoner, considered himself and was, almost to the last, considered by the rest as necessary to ensure the success of whichever amongst the other three parties could come to terms with him. Thus he passed successively {{into the hands of the}} Scots, Parliament and the New Model, trying to reverse the verdict of arms by entreating with each in turn.|$|E
25|$|In January {{and early}} February 1991, Mearsheimer {{published}} two op-eds in the Chicago Tribune and the New York Times {{arguing that the}} war to liberate Kuwait from Iraqi forces should be quick and lead to a decisive US victory, with less than 1,000 American casualties. This view countered the conventional wisdom {{at the start of}} the war, that predicted a conflict lasting for months and costing thousands of American lives. Mearsheimer's argument was based on several points. First, the Iraqi Army was a Third World military, unprepared to fight mobile armored battles. Second, US armored forces were better equipped and trained. Third, US artillery was also far better than its Iraqi counterpart. Fourth, US airpower, unfettered by the weak Iraqi air force, <b>should</b> <b>prove</b> devastating against Iraqi ground forces. Fifth and finally, the forward deployment of Iraqi reserves boded ill for their ability to counter US efforts to penetrate the Iraqi defense line along the Saudi-Kuwaiti border. These predictions came true in the course of the war.|$|E
25|$|Paul's icon {{continues}} the Apostles tier {{on the right}} side. He {{was not one of}} the twelve disciples of Jesus; Paul, a Roman citizen, was arrested in Jerusalem because he was accused of preaching against the Jewish law and traditions. However, as a Roman citizen by birth, he exercised his right to appeal to Caesar. He was brought to Rome, and after six years' imprisonment, the curia sentenced him to death. Considering his Roman status, they chose the most pious way to execute him: Paul was beheaded with a sword according to tradition. This is the reason he is shown with a sword in his right hand. In his left hand he holds his epistles from the New Testament. The next icon portrays John. He has his own gospel in his left hand. Legend has it that John was the only apostle who was not martyred as he died after a long life in Ephesus. Nevertheless, he was unable to escape persecution and had to defend his faith before Domitian. The emperor told him that he <b>should</b> <b>prove</b> the strength of his God with deeds and not just words. John asked for a cup of poisoned wine that he blessed and then drank; the strength of his faith protected him and he remained unharmed. The empty chalice on his gospel is symbolic of this miracle. Luke the Evangelist appears in the next image. As in the icons of Mark and Matthew, he holds a quill and his gospel. The icon of James the Elder follows Luke's image. He was painted with a pilgrim's staff, holding a pack and a letter of pilgrimage in his right hand. James was John's brother, and he was beheaded in Judea in 44 AD. His relics were translated to Spain, where one of the first pilgrimage sites in Europe was born to venerate him. The Camino de Santiago leads to his shrine. Simon's icon is the next on the tier; he preached the Word in Egypt, and he was martyred in Armenia. Simon was put to death by a saw and is portrayed with the symbol of his martyrdom. The last image on the Apostles tier depicts Philip. He lived and spread Jesus' teachings in today's Turkey, and according to Christian traditions he was crucified upside-down. He holds a Latin Cross to commemorate his martyrdom.|$|E

In contrast, FilmsAsia reviewer Soh Yun-Huei panned its use of political satire, which she felt [...] " [...] the film to be devoid of innocence and replaced with a sense of agenda and manipulation".|$|E

500|$|Nine days later, Senator Brien McMahon, who {{within a}} year would write the Atomic Energy Act and {{organize}} and chair the Congressional Joint Committee on Atomic Energy, made the first public proposal for such a test, but one designed to demonstrate the vulnerability, rather than survivability, of ships. He proposed dropping an atomic bomb on captured Japanese ships and suggested, [...] "The resulting explosion <b>should</b> <b>prove</b> to us just how effective the atomic bomb is when used against the giant naval ships." [...] On September 19, the Chief of the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF), General of the Army Henry H. Arnold, asked the Navy to set aside ten of the thirty-eight captured Japanese ships {{for use in the}} test proposed by McMahon.|$|E

The deal was announced on January 6, 1920. Reaction in Boston was mixed: some fans were embittered {{at the loss of}} Ruth; others conceded that the slugger had become difficult to deal with. The New York Times suggested presciently, [...] "The short right field wall at the Polo Grounds <b>should</b> <b>prove</b> an easy target for Ruth next season and, playing seventy-seven games at home, it would not be surprising if Ruth surpassed his home run record of twenty-nine circuit clouts next Summer."

500|$|The {{work was}} written {{sometime}} in the early 13th century, and is explicitly dedicated to Frederick II. The scholar James Wood Brown argues that the book was likely written and then presented to soon-to-be Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II in AD 1209 {{on the occasion of}} his wedding to Constance of Aragon. Brown also adds, [...] "No date suits this publication so well as 1209, and nothing but the urgent desire of Court and people that the marriage <b>should</b> <b>prove</b> fruitful can explain, one might add excuse, some passages of almost fescennine license which it contains." [...] The philosophy and religion scholar Irven Resnick argues that the work was given to Frederick so that [...] "the emperor [...] to distinguish, from outward appearances, trustworthy and wise counselors from their opposite numbers." ...|$|E
500|$|Mary Shelley lived a {{literary}} life. Her father {{encouraged her to}} learn to write by composing letters, and her favourite occupation as a child was writing stories. Unfortunately, all of Mary's juvenilia were lost when she ran off with Percy in 1814, and none of her surviving manuscripts can be definitively dated before that year. Her first published work is often {{thought to have been}} Mounseer Nongtongpaw, comic verses written for Godwin's Juvenile Library when she was ten and a half; however, the poem is attributed to another writer in the most recent authoritative collection of her works. Percy Shelley enthusiastically encouraged Mary Shelley's writing: [...] "My husband was, from the first, very anxious that I <b>should</b> <b>prove</b> myself worthy of my parentage, and enrol myself on the page of fame. He was forever inciting me to obtain literary reputation." ...|$|E
500|$|Opinion {{about the}} value of Florida to the Union was mixed: some thought it a useless land of swamps and horrible animals, while others thought it a gift from God for {{national}} prosperity. In 1838 comments in The Army and Navy Chronicle supported future development of southern Florida: [...] climate [...] most delightful; but, from want of actual observation, [...] could not speak so confidently of the soil, although, from the appearance of the surrounding vegetation, a portion of it, at least, must be rich. Whenever the aborigines shall be forced from their fastnesses, as eventually they must be, the enterprising spirit of our countrymen will very soon discover the sections best adapted to cultivation, and the now barren or unproductive everglades will be made to blossom like a garden. It is the general impression that these everglades are uninhabitable during the summer months, by reason of their being overflowed by the abundant rains of the season; but if it <b>should</b> <b>prove</b> that these inundations are caused or increased by obstructions to the natural courses of the rivers, as outlets to the numerous lakes, American industry will remove these obstructions.|$|E
