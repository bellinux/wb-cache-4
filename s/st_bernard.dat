5|$|Alpine spaniels {{were kept}} by the canons of the monasteries in the Alps in order to search for {{travellers}} during heavy snow storms, including the Great <b>St.</b> <b>Bernard</b> Hospice in the Great <b>St</b> <b>Bernard</b> Pass between Italy and Switzerland. The dogs would be dispatched in pairs to search for fallen travellers, and were trained so that upon finding them {{would return to the}} canons in order to lead rescuers back to the unfortunate individuals. The Alpine breed was also used as a watchdog to guard sheep and cattle of mountainous regions, including the Himalayas.|$|E

5|$|Gibraltar was {{subjected}} to several more sieges before its final fall on 20 August 1462 (feast of <b>St.</b> <b>Bernard)</b> to Christian forces under the 1st Duke of Medina Sidonia. The population, Muslim and Jewish, was expelled en masse and replaced by Christian settlers.|$|E
5|$|The Reconquista of Gibraltar {{took place}} on the feast of <b>St.</b> <b>Bernard,</b> whom the Spanish named patron saint of Gibraltar and has {{remained}} so ever since. This brought an end to Moorish Gibraltar, just over 751 years after Tariq ibn-Ziyad had begun the conquest of Iberia.|$|E
5|$|Until September 2004, 18 dogs still {{belonged to}} the hospice at any one time. The Foundation Barry du Grand Saint Bernard was {{established}} to create kennels in Martigny, a village further down the pass, {{to take over the}} breeding of <b>St.</b> <b>Bernard</b> puppies from the friars at Hospice. Around 20 puppies per year are born at the foundation. In 2009, the <b>St.</b> <b>Bernard</b> Dog Museum was opened at the Foundation in Martigny and, to commemorate the occasion, Barry's remains were lent from the museum in Bern. Each summer, the foundation leads dogs up the pass when it is open to the hospice, mainly for tourists, with rescue efforts on the pass now conducted by helicopters.|$|E
50|$|In 1972 <b>St.</b> <b>Bernard's</b> School {{merged with}} Miss Gill's School to become Gill <b>St.</b> <b>Bernard's</b> School. At {{this time the}} {{religious}} affiliation of <b>St.</b> <b>Bernard's</b> was discontinued. The new school had its early grades on the old Gill campus in Bernardsville and upper grades on the <b>St.</b> <b>Bernard's</b> campus in Gladstone. The two divisions consolidated in 1997 on the Gladstone campus. Sidney A. Rowell became Headmaster in 2001.|$|R
50|$|To {{the north}} east and {{overlooking}} Silvermills lies <b>St</b> <b>Bernard's</b> House, a brick building constructed in 1987 by Lothian Homes Limited, with 46 private retirement flats and a warden's flat. The warden's flat became a retirement flat in 2010. Its main entrance is on Henderson Row, the gardens and car park are accessed from West Silvermills Lane. On this site, at the Disruption of the Church of Scotland in 1843, <b>St</b> <b>Bernard’s</b> Free Church was founded {{together with a}} church hall and a beadle's house. The church was rebuilt in 1856. The Free Church united with the United Presbyterian Church in 1900, forming the United Free Church when it became known as <b>St</b> <b>Bernard’s</b> United Free Church. Dean Street Congregation united with <b>St</b> <b>Bernard’s</b> United Free Church in 1915.

5|$|In 1829 a Mastiff like dog {{was brought}} from the Great <b>St</b> <b>Bernard</b> Hospice and was {{exhibited}} in London and Liverpool to thousands of people.

5|$|In 25BC, an army under Aulus Terentius Varro Murena {{wiped out}} the Salassi in the Aosta Valley. At some time between 25 and 7BC – either {{following}} the Aosta campaign or, more likely, {{in the course of}} the conquest of Raetia in 15BC – a campaign also subjugated the Celtic tribes of the Valais and opened the Great <b>St</b> <b>Bernard</b> Pass.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} regain the upper hand, he planned to launch a {{surprise}} assault on the Austrian army stationed in the Cisalpine Republic. Based on the assumption the Austrians would never expect Napoleon's large force {{to be able to}} traverse the Alps, he chose that as his route. He selected the shortest route through the Alps, the Great <b>St</b> <b>Bernard</b> Pass, which would enable him to reach his destination as quickly as possible.|$|E

50|$|Roman Catholics did {{not have}} a home in Assonet until 1912, when a mission was created. Services were held in private homes until 1937, when <b>St.</b> <b>Bernard's</b> Catholic Church was {{constructed}} on the site of Col. Ebeneezer Pierce's home on So. Main St. It opened in 1938. As the congregation grew too large for the small church, <b>St.</b> <b>Bernard's</b> Church was sold and its parishioners moved into South Church, heavily renovated and renamed <b>St.</b> <b>Bernard's</b> Church. <b>St.</b> <b>Bernard's</b> Parish remains in South Church , and the parsonage has remained as the rectory.|$|R

5|$|The Alpine Spaniel is an extinct {{breed of}} dog {{which was used}} in {{mountain}} rescues by the Augustinian Canons, who run hospices in the region around the Great <b>St.</b> <b>Bernard</b> Pass. The spaniel was a large dog notable for its thick curly coat. One {{of the most famous}} specimens of the Alpine Spaniel is Barry, however his preserved body has been modified {{on more than one occasion}} to fit with descriptions of the extinct breed from earlier time periods. Due to the conditions in the Alps, and a series of accidents, extinction was discussed as a possibility by authors during the 1830s, and at some point prior to 1847 the entire breed was reduced to a single example due to disease. Evidence held at the Natural History Museum in Bern show that two distinct breeds of dog were being used in the area during this time period. The breed is thought to be the predecessor to the modern <b>St.</b> <b>Bernard</b> and the Clumber Spaniel.|$|E
5|$|The {{work was}} {{inspired}} by Jacques-Louis David's series of five Napoleon Crossing the Alps paintings (1801–1805). David's works also show Napoleon's journey through the Great <b>St.</b> <b>Bernard</b> Pass, but there are significant stylistic {{differences between the two}} conceptions. Delaroche's Napoleon is cold and downcast, whereas David's wears a pristine uniform, and is idealized as a hero. Delaroche was commissioned to paint a realistic portrait; the style of which was emerging at the time.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{becoming}} {{a tropical storm}}, the National Hurricane Center issued a tropical storm warning {{from the mouth of}} the Mississippi River to Pensacola, Florida. Sixhours later, the warning was extended westward to Morgan City, Louisiana. The threat of Beryl prompted some voluntary evacuations in <b>St.</b> <b>Bernard</b> Parish in Louisiana, and also forced the evacuations of thousands from offshore oil rigs. Officials advised small craft to remain at port from Port O'Connor, Texas to Pensacola, Florida.|$|E
50|$|In 1965, a club {{located in}} Belmont was founded, {{under the name}} <b>St</b> <b>Bernard's</b> Football Club. It was {{admitted}} to the Geelong DFL Woolworth's Cup the same year. With a series of average performances in 1970, both the <b>St</b> <b>Bernard's</b> and Anglesea clubs were demoted to the reserve grade competition. <b>St</b> <b>Bernard's</b> won the premiership that year and both clubs advanced back into the senior grade in 1971.|$|R

5|$|Aventicum (Avenches) {{was likely}} {{the capital of}} the Helvetii since its {{founding}} {{at the beginning of the}} 1st century. In the 40s, it benefited from the traffic brought over the <b>St</b> <b>Bernard</b> pass over a street expanded by Claudius, and in 71 it acquired the status of a Roman colony and of an allied city. This is believed to have been a favor of Vespasian for the city in which he had lived for a time, or a measure to better control the Helvetii after the events of 69 by implanting a colony of veterans in their midst.|$|E
5|$|Barry is {{described}} as the most famous <b>St.</b> <b>Bernard</b> by the Natural History Museum of Bern. Following his death, his skin was preserved by a taxidermist for the museum, {{while the rest of}} his body was buried. He was originally given a humble and meek pose, as the taxidermist felt that this would serve as a reminder of servitude to future generations. In 1923, his body was refurbished by Georg Ruprecht, as his coat had become brittle and had broken into more than 20 pieces. During the restoration, his body was re-posed and his skull shape was modified to match the shape of the <b>St.</b> <b>Bernard</b> of that time, in a compromise between Ruprecht and the Museum's director. His original head shape was rather flat with a moderate stop, with the modification resulting in a larger head with a more pronounced stop. A barrel was added hanging from his collar, following the popularization of the myth of the monastery's dogs using these during the rescues, which was originally introduced by Edwin Landseer's work Alpine Mastiffs Reanimating a Distressed Traveller. The barrel was removed in 1978 by Professor Walter Huber, the director of the museum, although it has since been replaced. A monument to Barry is located opposite the entrance to the Cimetière des Chiens in Paris.|$|E

The declaration allowed {{residents to}} receive individual and public assistance. Including relief funds to Puerto Rico and Mississippi associated with Georges, {{a total of}} $14,150,532 insurance claims was paid for by FEMA. The Clinton administration appropriated $56million in post-disaster funds for regions impacted Tropical Storm Frances and Hurricane Georges in Louisiana.|$|E

5|$|Lacock Abbey, {{dedicated}} to St Mary and <b>St</b> <b>Bernard,</b> {{was founded in}} 1229 by the widowed Lady Ela the Countess of Salisbury, who laid the abbey's first stone 16 April 1232, in the reign of King Henry III, and to which she retired in 1238. Her late husband had been William Longespee, an illegitimate son of King Henry II. The abbey was founded in Snail's Meadow, {{near the village of}} Lacock. The first of the Augustinian nuns were veiled in 1232.|$|E
5|$|The Alpine Spaniel {{was one of}} {{the direct}} genetic {{progenitors}} to the <b>St.</b> <b>Bernard.</b> Starting in 1830, the monks and canons of the Swiss Alps began crossing the dogs with the Newfoundland, expecting that the resulting offspring would have the longer hair of the Newfoundland and this would protect the dogs better from the cold. Unfortunately ice would form on the longer hair, and seeing that the dogs were no longer effective rescue dogs, the monasteries gave them away to people in the surrounding Swiss valleys.|$|E
5|$|Work {{immediately}} began on constructing the abbey church, {{a task that}} took many decades. It was a conservative design, heavily influenced by the thoughts of <b>St.</b> <b>Bernard</b> and the order's early churches in its homeland of Burgundy. It was cruciform in shape with an aisled nave of seven bays, a short, square east end, and transepts each with two side chapels. The eastern parts of the church were built first, and were likely finished in 1232, {{at which point the}} abbey received a royal donation of oak to build choir stalls. The remainder was probably completed by mid-century.|$|E
