The effect of various parameters, such as carbon source, nitrogen source, presence/absence of buffering agents, carbon:nitrogen ratio, pH values, and time were examined. Following the screening of ten strains of Aspergilli, A. awamori NRRL 3112 was found to be the superior amyloglucosidase producing strain, while A. niger CBS 26265, produced higher levels of o i-amylase. The favoured nitrogen source for amylolytic enzyme production was corn steep powder, which had a strong buffering effecton the medium. Starch or its breakdown products stimulated ©¿»amylase and amylolucosidase expression 2 ̆ 7 as well as secretion. oC-Amylase production was more sensitive to pH than amyloglucosidase. The former showed peak production after 24 - 48 hours while the rate <b>of</b> <b>amyloglucosidase</b> synthesis was linear for 6 - 7 days. The fermentation was scaled up to 5 and 10 1 laboratory scale fermenters. The effects of various agitation and aeration rates were examined. Oxygen transferrate (OTR) or oxygen transfercoefficient (K. a) was found to have a large effect on biomass and enzyme yield s, with the conditions for maximal amylase production corresponding to suboptimal conditions for Aspergillus growth. Controlling pH a t 4. 5 or 5 - 5 increased oo-amylase production, but had little effect on amyloglucosidase yield s. The average doubling time of A. awamori NRRL 3112 varied with the medium pH.

30|$|The {{results of}} {{internal}} evaluation of Makgeolli {{before and after}} the LHBP system are shown in Table  2. A significant decrease in extracellular activity of the target enzyme (here amyloglucosidase for glucose-induced degradation) was observed during the storage period after LHBP treatment. Particularly, under the optimal homogenization condition, the activity of the amyloglucosidasee enzyme in Makgeolli showed reversible regulation, above 2.3 -fold after 35  days (1.3 U/ml), compared with the initial state. In the case of homogenization treatment with high pressures (Lim et al. 2004), the expression pattern <b>of</b> <b>amyloglucosidase</b> was similarly observed in cereal suspensions, but interestingly its activity was not below that of the LHBP system. This spontaneous phenomenon may affect the rheological properties (especially reducing sugar content) in colloidal suspension, and further enhance the storage stability of microbial suspensions due to the relatively low extracellular activation of starch hydrolysis by amyloglucosidase. However, no significant differences in acidity and alcohol level could be observed in this system during the 35 -day storage period.|$|R

Most studies of starch hydrolysis use enzymes, temperature conditions and reaction times which have been done for grains, such corn. The starch of sweet potatoes is considered more complex than cereal starches, making it more challenging to hydrolyze into fermentable sugars.

40|$|Highly {{branched}} glucose polymers {{produced from}} starch are applied in various products, such as peritoneal dialysis solutions and sports drinks. Due to its insoluble, granular nature, {{the use of}} native starch as substrate requires an energy consuming pre-treatment to achieve solubilization {{at the expense of}} process costs. Glycogen, like starch, is also a natural glucose polymer that shows more favorable features, since it is readily soluble in cold water and more accessible by enzymes. The extremophilic red microalga Galdieria sulphuraria accumulates large amounts of a small, highly branched glycogen that could represent a good alternative to starch as substrate for the production of highly branched glucose polymers. In the present work, we analyzed the structure-properties relationship of this glycogen in its native form and after treatment with amyloglucosidase and compared it to highly branched polymers produced from potato starch. Glycogen showed lower susceptibility to digestive enzymes and significantly decreased viscosity in solution compared to polymers derived from starch, properties conferred by its shorter side chains and higher branch density. The action <b>of</b> <b>amyloglucosidase</b> on native glycogen was somewhat limited due to the high branch density but resulted in the production of a hyperbranched polymer that was virtually resistant to digestive enzymes.

The cyclodextrin complexes were accepted as substrates by the enzymes to variable extent. The β-glucosidases originating from Thermotoga neapolitana (Tn Bgl 3 B) and from almond were not at all able to hydrolyse alkyl β-glucosides in the presence of 100 mM α-cyclodextrin. However, Aspergillus niger amyloglucosidase readily accepted the complexes as substrates. In reactions involving decyl and dodecyl maltosides, the presence of 100 mM α-cyclodextrin caused an increase in reaction rate in most cases, especially at high substrate concentrations. Surprisingly, the amyloglucosidase-catalyzed hydrolysis of octyl-β-maltoside to glucose and β-octylglucoside was faster in the presence of α-cyclodextrin than without, even at substrate concentrations below CMC.

Porous starches were obtained using a range <b>of</b> concentrations <b>of</b> <b>amyloglucosidase</b> (AMG), α-amylase (AM), cyclodextrin-glycosyltransferase (CGTase) or branching enzyme (BE). Porous starches exhibited major content of digestible starch (DS) that increased with the intensity of the enzymatic treatment, and very low amount of resistant starch (RS). Porous starches behaved differently during in vitro hydrolysis depending on their enzymatic treatment. AMG was the unique treatment that increased the digestive amylolysis and estimated glycemic index, whereas AM, CGTase and BE reduced them. A significant relationship was found between the pore size and the severity of the amylolysis, suggesting that a specific pore size is required for the accessibility of the digestive amylase.

Amyloglucosidase treatment affected significantly (P < 0. 05) the color of the crust and decreased the moisture content and water activity of the crusts. Mechanical properties were modified by amyloglucosidase, namely increasing levels of enzyme promoted a decrease in the force (Fm) required for crust rupture and an increase in the number of fracture events (N wr) related to crispy products. Crust microstructure analysis confirmed that enzymatic treatment caused changes in the bread crust structure, leading to a disruption of the structure, by removing the starchy layer that covered the granules and increasing the number of voids, which agree with the texture fragility. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

Using the known <b>solution</b> <b>of</b> the non-linear differential equation, linear differential equations are set up. The <b>solutions</b> <b>of</b> these linear differential equations are found using standard techniques.
