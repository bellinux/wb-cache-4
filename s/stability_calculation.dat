40|$|Computer {{simulations}} {{have shown}} that <b>stability</b> <b>calculations</b> in boiling water reactors (BWRs) {{are very sensitive to}} a number of input parameters, modeling assumptions, and numerical integration techniques. Following the 1988 LaSalle instability event, a significant industry-wide effort was invested in identifying these sensitivities. One major conclusion from these studies was that existing time-domain codes could best predict BWR stability by using explicit methods for the energy equation with a Courant number as close to unity as possible. This paper presents a series of sensitivity studies using simplified models, which allow us to determine the effect that different numerical integration techniques have on the results of <b>stability</b> <b>calculations.</b> The present study appears to indicate that, even though using explicit integration with a Courant number of one is adequate for existing codes using time-integration steps of less than 10 ms, second-order solution techniques for the time integration can result in significant improvements in the accuracy of linear (i. e., decay ratio) <b>stability</b> <b>calculations...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{result of}} a linear <b>stability</b> <b>calculation</b> of solitary waves which {{propagate}} steadily along the free surface of a liquid layer of constant depth is examined numerically by employing a time-stepping scheme based on a boundary-integral method. The initial growth rate that is found for sufficiently small perturbations agrees well with the growth rate expected from the linear <b>stability</b> <b>calculation.</b> In calculating the later ‘nonlinear ’ stage of the instability, {{it is found that}} two distinct types of long-time evolution are possible. These depend only on the sign of the unstable normal-mode perturbatioli that is superimposed initially on the steady wave. The growth of the perturbation ultimately leads to breaking for one sign. Unexpectedly, for the opposite sign, there is a monotonic decrease in the total height of the wave. In this latter case there is a smooth evolution to a stable solitary wave of lesser amplitude but very nearly the same energy. 1...|$|E

40|$|Both a {{circular}} slip surface <b>stability</b> <b>calculation</b> (Bishop or Fellenius) and a FEM calculation (c-phi reduction) produce a safety factor {{but not a}} probability of failure or reliability index. The mayor problem with the probabilistical calculations is that variable soil parameters create a correlated and therefore also variable failure mechanism. The {{question is how much}} the value of the calculated probability of failure is influenced by this correlation. The Monte-Carlo method leads, because of the many slip surface calculations, to the most accurate calculation of the probability of safety. The disadvantage of this method is that it is far too time consuming for daily FEM calculations. The idea is therefore to replace the Monte-Carlo approach by another approach with only a limited amount of calculations. In this paper several methods are discussed and validated. An indication is given about the error, the number of necessary stability calculations and the optimal estimation points for an additional <b>stability</b> <b>calculation.</b> In this way a minimum number of FEM calculations is needed to obtain a certain desired accuracy...|$|E

40|$|In this thesis, a new {{numerical}} ocean model, Tempest, {{has been}} developed for application to simple process studies of large-scale ocean dynamics. This model allows for hydrostatic, non-hydrostatic, quasi-hydrostatic, and quasi-geostrophic model options to be employed and is a rigid-lid, fully three-dimensional model that allows for two-dimensionally varying bottom topography using a terrain-following coordinate transformation. To assess the accuracy and validity of this model a number of preliminary test cases are considered. These consist of a complex linear advection test, various convection studies including those defined over one- and two-dimensionally varying bottom topography, {{and a series of}} ocean gyre tests. Next, the stability characteristics of a barotropic and a surface intensified baroclinic coastal jet are analyzed. Barotropic jets are characterized by significant horizontal shear and can give rise to both barotropic and baroclinic modes. Furthermore, barotropic jets are often more greatly impacted by variations in the bottom topography compared to surface-intensified baroclinic jets. On the other hand, baroclinic jets have both strong horizontal and vertical shear and are representative of more commonly observed physical jets in the ocean. That being said, baroclinic jets are often more difficult to study numerically {{due in part to the}} variations in the isopycnals from the definition of the background jet structure. To gain insights into the growth and structure of the instabilities that can arise from the perturbation of these jets both linear <b>stability</b> <b>calculations</b> and nonlinear simulations are performed. The linear <b>stability</b> <b>calculations</b> allow us to consider a wide range of parameters efficiently. The effects of prograde and retrograde topography as well as varying degrees of stratification are considered. Guided by the results from the linear <b>stability</b> <b>calculations,</b> a set of nonlinear simulations are chosen. Using both the hydrostatic and quasi-geostrophic model options, a comparison between the two sets of results are made and non-QG effects are observed. As well, the results from the linear <b>stability</b> <b>calculations</b> are validated...|$|R
