The original goal of reverse engineering the FBW of F-111 proved to be far too ambitious and had to be abandoned, and much simpler version was adopted. The triplex analog FBW of Q-6 is just slightly more advanced the most rudimentary FBW in that it used the same principle of the most rudimentary FBW in replacing the mechanical <b>servo</b> <b>valves</b> with electrical <b>servo</b> <b>valves</b> operated by electronic controller, but contrary to the most rudimentary FBW where hydraulic actuators still existed, the hydraulic actuators are replaced by electrical actuators on Q-6. The system proved to be major obstacle in the development and it took nine years to complete (1980-1988), under the personal leadership of Mr. Lu Xiaopeng. Although hailed as a technological breakthrough for the Chinese aviation by China, and provided superior performance, the Chinese system was more than 12% heavier than the simple mechanical-hydraulic controlled variable-sweep wing of MiG-23, reducing the weapon payload, fuel capacity and combat radius, which contributed partially to the final cancellation of Q-6.|$|E

30|$|Yet {{sensitivity}} analysis {{has a few}} applications in hydraulic system. Vilenus [18] applied trajectory {{sensitivity analysis}} to the valve-controlled cylinder system of the logging machine and the mathematical model of this system was simplified to fifth order model where the <b>servo</b> <b>valve</b> flow-pressure nonlinearity and dead zone nonlinearity were taken into consideration. Moreover, the sensitivity analysis of ten main parameters containing viscous damping coefficient, conversion mass, internal leakage coefficient of servo cylinder, effective piston area of servo cylinder, effective bulk modulus, <b>servo</b> <b>valve</b> gain, nature frequency of <b>servo</b> <b>valve,</b> damping ratio of <b>servo</b> <b>valve,</b> conversion coefficient and system supply oil pressure is obtained with parameters change 1 % under single working condition. The sensitivity analysis {{results indicated that the}} sensitivity of piston rod area of the <b>servo</b> cylinder, <b>servo</b> <b>valve</b> gain, conversion flow coefficient and system supply oil pressure is large and that of viscous damping coefficient, internal leakage coefficient of the <b>servo</b> <b>valve,</b> damping ratio of servo vale and nature frequency of the <b>servo</b> <b>valve</b> is relatively small under the same working condition. Furthermore, Farasat et al. [19] founded the fourth order linear mathematical model of the valve-controlled cylinder position control system where the <b>servo</b> <b>valve</b> flow-pressure nonlinearity is linearized partially. The sensitivity of other parameters, such as <b>servo</b> <b>valve</b> torque motor constant, <b>servo</b> <b>valve</b> area constant, orifice opening of metering valve, system return oil pressure, supply oil volume, return oil volume and input signal voltage, is given with parameters change 1 % under single working condition by four sensitivity evaluation methods including VILENUS method, revised VILENUS method, Entirety index method and Individual characteristics method. The analysis results indicated that the sensitivity of effective piston area of servo cylinder, flow coefficient, conversion mass and input signal voltage is relatively small. Kong et al. [20 â€“ 22] first established the fifth linear order mathematical model for the hydraulic drive unit of quadruped robot and derived the first order trajectory sensitivity formulas analysis. Aimed at the imprecise conclusion of sensitivity analysis obtained from the linear model, some nonlinear models are also established. Besides, the sensitivity mathematical expressions with nonlinear and time-varied parameters are derived under the trotting gait working conditions. Kong et al. [23] derived the mathematical model of the second order trajectory sensitivity analysis based on the mathematical model of the first order trajectory sensitivity formulas analysis. Therefore, the situation where the first order trajectory sensitivity formulas analysis accuracy of some parameters is not high is improved. Then the experimental verification is conducted.|$|R
