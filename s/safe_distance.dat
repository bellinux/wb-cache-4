5|$|Humpback whales {{have been}} sighted {{in the lower}} region of Glacier Bay; also in Sitakaday Narrows, Whidbey Passage and the waters around South Marble Island. For kayakers, Hugh Miller Inlet and the Beardslee Islands are good {{locations}} to see humpback whales from a <b>safe</b> <b>distance</b> of about a quarter mile. Other marine whales sighted are grey, minke, fin, and killer whales (orcas).|$|E

The distances are for underground coal mines and electromagnetic {{sources in the}} frequency range below 10 MHz. The distances are based on measurements performed at 3 locations in each of 3 coal mines. The measurement apparatus, measurement procedure, measurement results and the rationale used in the calculation of the <b>safe</b> <b>distances</b> are all described. The <b>safe</b> <b>distances</b> presented are dependent on the measurement results and their interpretation.

5|$|Blacktip sharks showing curiosity towards divers {{has been}} reported, but they remain at a <b>safe</b> <b>distance.</b> Under most circumstances, these timid sharks are not {{regarded}} as highly dangerous to humans. However, they may become aggressive {{in the presence}} of food, and their size and speed invite respect. As of 2008, the International Shark Attack File lists 28 unprovoked attacks (one fatal) and 13 provoked attacks by this species. Blacktip sharks are responsible annually for 16% of the shark attacks around Florida. Most attacks by this species result in only minor wounds.|$|E
5|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} Gaveston's death, however, civil conflict in England rarely seemed far away, and it is currently believed that Thomas probably intended to create a secure retreat, a <b>safe</b> <b>distance</b> away from Edward's forces in the south. He also probably hoped to erect a prominent status symbol, illustrating his wealth and authority, and challenging that of the King. He may perhaps also have hoped to create a planned town alongside the castle, possibly intending to relocate the population of Embleton there.|$|E
5|$|Martín de Ursúa was now {{convinced}} that Kan Ek' would not surrender peacefully, {{and he began}} to organise an all-out assault on Nojpetén. Work on the road was redoubled and about a month after the battle at Ch'ich' the Spanish arrived at the lakeshore, now supported by artillery. Again a large number of canoes gathered, and the nervous Spanish soldiers opened fire with cannons and muskets; no casualties were reported among the Itza, who retreated and raised a white flag from a <b>safe</b> <b>distance.</b>|$|E

40|$|A {{survey of}} the {{literature}} on the classification of fireworks and requirements on safe-distance storage of fireworks in the USA, Germany, France and the UK was conducted to allow a comparison of legislation among these countries. Although the definitions and systems of measurement used (e. g. gross or net weight) were not always clear in the consulted references, the following observations could be made. The approach to this subject by the countries surveyed does not differ much on main issues. When it comes to more detailed legislation, however, differences are greater. The table below compares the <b>safe</b> <b>distances</b> (m) of fireworks (according to gross weight) in the least dangerous firework class (subclass 1. 4), both with and without a sprinkler system. It can be concluded that the <b>safe</b> <b>distances</b> for a small storage facility in the Netherlands are comparatively small. For a larger storage facility, the <b>safe</b> <b>distances</b> are greater than in Germany and similar to those in the USA and the UK...|$|R
40|$|In {{the context}} of spatial {{planning}} the Dutch Ministry of Housing, Spatial Planning and the Environment asked the Centre for External Safety of the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) to advice on <b>safe</b> <b>distances</b> pertaining to hydrogen filling stations. The RIVM made use of failure modeling and parameters for calculating the distance in detail. An imaginary hydrogen filling station for cars {{is used in the}} determination of ‘external safety’ or third party distances for the installations and the pipe work for three different sizes of hydrogen filling stations. For several failure scenarios ‘effect’ distances are calculated for car filling at 350 and 700 bar. <b>Safe</b> <b>distances</b> of filling stations from locations where people live and work appear to be similar for compressed hydrogen, gasoline/petrol and compressed natural gas. <b>Safe</b> <b>distances</b> for LPG are greater. A filling unit for hydrogen can be placed at gasoline/petrol-filling stations without increasing safety distance...|$|R
5|$|Union {{infantry}} attacked {{from the}} east side of the battlefield, while most of the cavalry attacked from the south and west. Capehart's brigade attacked from the southwest, and eventually was on the extreme western side of the battlefield. At times, the cavalry fought dismounted, with their horses led at a <b>safe</b> <b>distance</b> behind. The opposing forces were always within range of the Union cavalry carbines, keeping the weapon's seven-shot advantage—and not enabling the Confederate infantry to utilize the advantage of their longer range weapons.|$|E
5|$|Abercrombie {{made two}} notable errors of {{judgment}} during the battle. One {{was a failure}} to recognize after {{the first wave of}} attacks that his chosen method of attack was unlikely to work. Instead of ordering additional waves of troops to the slaughter, he should have retreated to a <b>safe</b> <b>distance</b> and considered alternative actions. The second failure was that he apparently never considered ordering a flanking maneuver against the French right. At a minimum this would have stretched the French defenses, allowing his attackers elsewhere to find weak points. In fact, the French twice in the battle sent companies of militia out of their works on the right to enfilade the British attackers.|$|E
5|$|Heavier {{suburban}} {{traffic on the}} Melbourne network saw a greater strain on the block working then used, which required {{a large number of}} manned signal boxes to enable trains to run close together. As a result, it was decided to adopt power signalling under the Automatic Block System (ABS) of safeworking, where the presence of trains automatically control the signals after them, providing a <b>safe</b> <b>distance</b> between trains. Introduced from 1915, the system was based on American speed signalling practice with GRS2A upper quadrant mechanical signals with two arms able to indicate up to 5 different speed aspects to train drivers. These signals were later replaced by colour light signals which are the standard today, but the old mechanical style remained until 2001.|$|E

40|$|When {{trees are}} planted {{too close to}} a {{building}}, the roots of them are causing damages to that building in both direct and indirect ways. In many cases, these subterranean problems go unnoticed, until cracks appear on surfaces. The remedial works for such cases can be always difficult and expensive. This research was carried out to identify the causes and effects of not using the <b>safe</b> planting <b>distances</b> and then it is extended with a detail survey to find <b>safe</b> <b>distances</b> using 5 categories of trees, which are most common in Sri Lanka. It was noted that the direct damages to civil structures are very common here in Sri Lanka. It was observed that the damage from Bodhi tree is much greater than other trees. Therefore, its’ <b>safe</b> planting <b>distance</b> is around 11 metres. <b>Safe</b> planting <b>distances</b> for Tamarind and Royal Poinciana are in a range between 6 to 7 metres. For Jack & Mango tree, it is about 4 to 5 metres. So these <b>safe</b> planting <b>distances</b> has presented numerically in this report...|$|R
5|$|Special {{technical}} solutions had to {{be designed}} for the accommodations for three adults to be confined in a small balloon basket for up to 30 days. The sleeping berths for the crew were fitted at {{the floor of the}} basket, along with some of stores and provisions. The highly flammable hydrogen meant that cooking could not be done in the basket itself. The solution was a modified primus stove (designed by a friend of Andrée's) that could be dangled 8m (26ft) below the crew and then lit from the basket, at a <b>safe</b> <b>distance.</b> An angled mirror attached to the specially designed stove allowed the crew to determine whether it was successfully lit or not.|$|E
5|$|The game's ending changes {{depending}} on whether the player has a radio beacon to call for extraction, and when the nuclear device is set to explode. Forgetting to set the bomb, or setting it to explode at any time past the awakening of the dreaming god, results in Earth's destruction. The device's detonation before the player reaches a minimum <b>safe</b> <b>distance</b> results in a pyrrhic victory. The most favorable endings are achieved by leaving the pyramid with a beacon for evacuation at least twenty game minutes before the device is set to go off; if the game ends with enough time for the player to escape on foot, the player survives without a beacon.|$|E
5|$|This turn {{of events}} {{convinced}} Martín de Ursúa that Kan Ek' would not surrender peacefully, {{and he began to}} organise an all-out assault on Nojpetén. The enlistment of previously authorised reinforcements was now urgent, but was hindered when 70 of 100 soldiers mutinied and never reached García's camp. Work on the road was redoubled and about a month after the battle at Ch'ich' the Spanish arrived at the lakeshore, now supported by artillery. Again a large number of canoes gathered, and the nervous Spanish soldiers opened fire with cannons and muskets; no casualties were reported among the Itza, who retreated and raised a white flag from a <b>safe</b> <b>distance.</b>|$|E

5|$|Amésqueta left Mopán {{three days}} after Díaz and {{followed}} Díaz’s trail to the lakeshore. He arrived at the lake over a week later with 36 men. As they scouted along the south shore near Nojpetén they were shadowed by about 30 Itza canoes and more Itzas approached by land but kept a <b>safe</b> <b>distance.</b> Amésqueta was extremely suspicious of the small canoes being offered by the Itza to transport his party across to Nojpetén; as nightfall approached Amésqueta retreated from the lakeshore and his men took up positions on a small hill nearby. In {{the early hours of}} the morning he ordered a retreat by moonlight. At San Pedro Martír he received news of an Itza embassy to Mérida in December 1695, and an apparent formal surrender of the Itza to Spanish authority. Unable to reconcile the news with the loss of his men, and with appalling conditions in San Pedro Mártir, Amésqueta abandoned his unfinished fort and retreated to Guatemala.|$|E
5|$|Despite Bompart's {{attempts}} to disguise his destination, by {{the evening of}} 23 September Countess had correctly deduced the French were heading for Ireland, and despatched the brig Sylph to warn Commodore Warren and any other British ships she came across. Two days later, on 25 September, Commodore Bompart was forced to haul {{to the east and}} lose ground to his pursuers when a 100-ship British convoy passed to the north. This convoy consisted of many well-armed East Indiamen, protected by several frigates, and posed a serious threat to Bompart's overloaded ships. He then tried to drive off pursuit by feinting towards Countess's squadron, but the faster British ships simply withdrew to a <b>safe</b> <b>distance,</b> resuming their chase once the French had returned to their original course. On 29 September Bompart made a final bid to shake his pursuers; he attempted to engage the British frigates with three of his own—Immortalité, Loire and another. This plan failed after his flagship Hoche lost a topmast in heavy weather and fell behind the rest of the squadron, forcing the frigates to return to her protection.|$|E
5|$|The commotion {{caused by}} the stoor worm's writhing agonies draws a crowd to the beach, and Assipattle lands safely among them. The ferocity of the fire burning in the creature's liver increases, causing smoke clouds to be {{expelled}} from its mouth and nostrils, turning the skies black. The islanders, believing {{that the world is}} about to end, clamber up a hillside to watch the final death throes of the creature at a <b>safe</b> <b>distance</b> from the resulting tidal waves and earthquakes. As it dies, the creature's teeth fall out to become the islands of Orkney, Shetland and the Faroes. The Baltic Sea is created where its tongue falls out, and when the creature finally curls up into a tight knot and dies, its body becomes Iceland. True to his word, once the skies clear and the earth settles, the king relinquishes his kingdom to Assipattle, who marries Princess Gem-de-lovely. As promised, the king also gives Odin's magic sword to Assipattle.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Discharges from {{overhead}} power lines and lightning discharges may severely endanger human life and health. If non-lethal, burn injuries may also last for a lifetime, so as Lichtenberg figures caused by lightning discharges. Some accidents with burns are discussed in this paper and recommendations given for safety reasons. Specific energy transferred by typical lightning strokes currents given in the standard IEC 62305 is calculated. The aim of the paper is to suggest a simple expression for the estimation of <b>safe</b> approach <b>distances</b> to overhead lines, especially if high temperatures and changes in terrain reduced the secure height above ground, or if carrying elevated objects. Results of these calculations are compared to <b>safe</b> approach <b>distances</b> given in regulations of different countries. <b>Safe</b> <b>distances</b> from railway power lines are also considered...|$|R

5|$|Zur was {{extremely}} reluctant to withdraw his personal forces. He {{decided to do}} so only at 09:00, {{when it became clear}} that the other two companies were at a <b>safe</b> <b>distance,</b> and the Egyptians were massing for a counterattack. First, the injured were evacuated, then the rest of the forces made their way back, each squad providing cover for the next. The Egyptian artillery caused the forces to scatter, and the commanders had difficulty diverting them to the general retreat path. After they came to a small grove to the west of the main road, it was discovered that three were missing and 17 injured, who were treated by the only remaining medic. Approximately at noon, Zur's men met with Dromi and Harpaz, and the working communication device was used to summon vehicles to take the soldiers to Gan Yavne.|$|E
5|$|Although the Royal Navy {{is widely}} {{regarded}} as vital to the rise of the British Empire, the British Army {{played an important role in}} the formation of colonies, protectorates and dominions in the Americas, Africa, Asia, India and Australasia. British soldiers captured strategically-important territories, and the army was involved in wars to secure the empire's borders and support friendly governments. Among these actions were the Seven Years' War, the American Revolutionary War, the Napoleonic Wars, the First and Second Opium Wars, the Boxer Rebellion, the New Zealand Wars, the Sepoy Rebellion of 1857, the first and second Boer Wars, the Fenian raids, the Irish War of Independence, interventions in Afghanistan (intended to maintain a buffer state between British India and the Russian Empire) and the Crimean War (to keep the Russian Empire at a <b>safe</b> <b>distance</b> by aiding Turkey). Like the English Army, the British Army fought the kingdoms of Spain, France (including the Empire of France) and the Netherlands for supremacy in North America and the West Indies. With native and provincial assistance, the army conquered New France in the North American theatre of the Seven Years' War and suppressed a Native American uprising in Pontiac's War. The British Army was defeated in the American Revolutionary War, losing the Thirteen Colonies but retaining The Canadas and The Maritimes as British North America.|$|E
5|$|Soon after, Rebecca {{contacts}} the hacker, {{and says}} that she has convinced TriOptimum to authorize the station's destruction; she provides him with details {{on how to do}} this. After obtaining the necessary codes, the hacker initiates the station's self-destruct sequence and flees to the escape pod bay. There, the hacker defeats Diego a second time, then attempts to disembark. However, SHODAN prevents the pod from launching; it seeks to keep the player aboard the station, while the bridge—which contains SHODAN—is jettisoned to a <b>safe</b> <b>distance.</b> Rebecca tells the hacker that he can still escape if he reaches the bridge; SHODAN then intercepts and jams the transmission. After defeating Diego for the third time and killing him for good, the hacker makes it to the bridge as it is released from the main station, which soon detonates. He is then contacted by a technician who managed to circumvent SHODAN's jamming signal. The technician informs him that SHODAN can only be defeated in cyberspace, due to the powerful shields that protect its mainframe computers. Using a terminal near the mainframe, the hacker enters cyberspace and destroys SHODAN. After his rescue, the hacker is offered a job at TriOptimum, but he declines in favor of continuing his life as a hacker.|$|E
