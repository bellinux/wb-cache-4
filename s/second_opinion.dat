5|$|His neck {{continued}} to cause him pain, and Prince Philip commented on its crooked state as he gave Trautmann his winner's medal. Trautmann attended that evening's post-match banquet despite {{being unable to}} move his head, {{and went to bed}} expecting the injury to heal with rest. As the pain did not recede, the following day he went to St George's Hospital, where he was told he merely had a crick in his neck which would go away. Three days later, he got a <b>second</b> <b>opinion</b> from a doctor at Manchester Royal Infirmary. An X-ray revealed he had dislocated five vertebrae, the second of which was cracked in two. The third vertebra had wedged against the second, preventing further damage which could have cost Trautmann his life.|$|E

Nonetheless, Breuer mentioned that Johnson told him that he was essentially fired from AC/DC and that he hadn't heard from the band since the announcement of the tour being postponed, adding that Angus Young wants to continue the band for at least another ten years and do at least one more studio album and world tour. Breuer later clarified his comments on Facebook that did not end speculation on Johnson's future with the band.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to make a first {{inventory}} of the phenomenon of <b>second</b> <b>opinions,</b> with a view to determining to what extent <b>second</b> <b>opinions</b> contribute to an appropriate and efficient use of public health care and to the guidance of further deployments. The study described in this thesis does not supply answers to all questions.

In addition, there is a need for more investigation of the questions how the growth of <b>second</b> <b>opinions</b> is evolving and how it might be streamlined better. ...|$|R

5|$|When Rocky was {{diagnosed}} with brain damage, {{it must be noted}} that many athletes have a form of brain damage including football players, soccer players, and other individuals in contact sports such as rugby, etc. Rocky never went for a <b>second</b> <b>opinion</b> and yielded to his wife's wishes to stop. So with the advent of new research techniques into brain damage, Rocky was found to be normal among fighters, and he was suffering the results of a severe concussion. By today's standards Rocky Balboa would be given a clean bill of health for fighters.|$|E
5|$|At Zeus Genetics clinic, Scully overhears a {{pregnant}} woman, Mary Hendershot (Saxon Trainor), who is telling her doctor {{that she does}} not want to be under his care any more. In order to avoid being seen, Scully hides in a storeroom, finding it full of preserved fetuses that resemble the alien child seen earlier, but she is discovered by a doctor, Dr. Lev. Scully then phones Dr. Parenti, who is dissecting an alien fetus. She asks him to compare her ultrasound scan with the one given to her earlier. Later, while waiting to be attended to by Dr. Parenti, she has another flashback, recalling the time she sought a <b>second</b> <b>opinion</b> about her ova from Dr. Parenti, and was told that her ova might be viable with a sperm donor. In the present, she is called in to be attended to, and she is then assured her scans are in order. Later, Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) and Doggett confront Duffy about threatening letters he has been sending to both Mulder and Dr. Lev. However, when the agents leave, Duffy makes a phone call to Lev, warning him that they are being investigated. In another flashback, Scully asks Mulder to be the donor, to which he happily agrees.|$|E

5|$|Thanks to {{his strong}} finish in 2012, Kendrick entered spring {{training}} assured of {{a spot in}} the Phillies' Opening Day starting rotation {{for the first time in}} five years and spent his first full season exclusively a member of the major league starting rotation. His 2013 season took the opposite trajectory of his 2012 campaign; he held a 4–1 record with a 2.47 ERA in his first eight starts, while he posted a 6–12 record with a 5.65 ERA in his final 22 starts. Some suggested that because Kendrick is a contact pitcher (i.e., he focuses on getting outs via batters hitting the ball rather than striking out), his career-worst batting average on balls in play indicated horrendous defense was the primary reason for his downturn, not necessarily poor pitching. However, both were likely contributing factors. On September 18, he was scratched from his scheduled start due to right rotator cuff tendinitis, which may have contributed to his poor pitching down the stretch. It was the first time in Kendrick's career he missed a start due to injury. He had initially planned on making his next start, but the Phillies announced on September 20 that Kendrick had been shut down for the remainder of the season after receiving a <b>second</b> <b>opinion</b> on the injury. The team placed him on the disabled list for his first career stint and Zach Miner took his spot in the rotation. Overall, he posted 10–13 with a 4.70 ERA in 182 innings pitched.|$|E

Two days prior to his scheduled promotion to the major league roster, Rodriguez sustained a new injury, as an MRI later revealed a Grade 1 quad strain, delaying his return and forcing him to continue rehabilitating in the minor leagues. Rodriguez independently sought a <b>second</b> <b>opinion</b> on his quad strain on July 24 with a doctor who stated that there {{did not appear to}} be an injury; the Yankees were incensed by his decision, saying that he violated league rules for seeking a <b>second</b> <b>opinion</b> without the team's permission.

40|$|I {{investigate}} {{when and}} how principals can use external experts to monitor agents when agents control information necessary for monitoring. In particular, I provide a theoretical model to examine in what circumstances external experts can assist boards of directors in discharging their management oversight and investment approval duties. Management controls relevant information about an investment but {{may not have the}} ability to process it to make an informed recommendation. External experts have the ability, but may not enjoy access to this information. I demonstrate how using experts to certify management recommendations a¤ects the disclosure incentives of management. Because certi…cation serves as a signaling mechanism, when managers have the incentive to truthfully reveal all that they know, certi…cation mandates are unnecessary since managers will choose to seek out <b>second</b> <b>opinions.</b> When information disclosures cannot be easily veri…ed, certi…cation mandates can be counterproductive, elevating the status of costly <b>second</b> <b>opinions</b> that always agree with management recommendations.
