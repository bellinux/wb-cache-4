5000|$|The object system within Rust {{is based}} around implementations, traits and {{structured}} types. Implementations fulfill a role {{similar to that}} of classes within other languages, and are defined with the [...] keyword. Inheritance and polymorphism are provided by traits; they allow methods to be defined and mixed in to implementations. Structured types are used to define fields. Implementations and traits cannot define fields themselves, and only traits can provide inheritance. Among other benefits, this prevents the diamond problem of multiple inheritance, as in C++. In other words, Rust <b>supports</b> <b>interface</b> inheritance, but replaces implementation inheritance with composition, see composition over inheritance.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Some {{object-oriented}} languages, such as Java and C#, provide interfaces as {{a feature}} for supporting a restricted form of multiple inheritance. Most typed intermediate languages for compiling objectoriented languages {{do not support}} interfaces or multiple inheritance. This paper describes a typed intermediate language that <b>supports</b> <b>interface</b> implementation strategies based on interface tables (itables). The language can faithfully model itables, the standard itable-based interface method invocation, and interface cast. The language extends a typed intermediate language that supports classes and single inheritance, {{and it has a}} sound and decidable type system. We believe that the underlying ideas can be applied to address other interface implementation techniques. ...|$|E

It incorporates mathematical relations and algorithms to analyze and solve the problems regarding fluid flow. CFD analysis of an airfoil produces results such as lift and drag forces which determines the ability of an airfoil. Optimization of an airfoil involves improving {{the design of the}} airfoil in order to manipulate the lift and drag coefficients according to the requirements. It is a very common method used in all fields of engineering. MATLAB is a numerical computing environment which <b>supports</b> <b>interface</b> with other software. XFoil is airfoil analysis software which calculates the lift and drag characteristics for different Reynolds numbers, Mach numbers and angles of attack. MALAB is interfaced with XFoil and the optimization of NACA 0012 airfoil is done and the results are analyzed. The performance of optimized air foil is analyzed using ANSYS FLUENT software...|$|E
