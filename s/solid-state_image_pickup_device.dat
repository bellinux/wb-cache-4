50|$|Digital {{and film}} cameras share an optical system, {{typically}} using a lens with a variable diaphragm to focus light onto an <b>image</b> <b>pickup</b> <b>device.</b> The diaphragm and shutter admit {{the correct amount}} of light to the imager, just as with film but the <b>image</b> <b>pickup</b> <b>device</b> is electronic rather than chemical. However, unlike film cameras, digital cameras can display images on a screen immediately after being recorded, and store and delete images from memory.

50|$|A <b>pickup</b> <b>device</b> is a {{transducer}} (specifically {{a variable}} reluctance sensor) that captures or senses mechanical vibrations produced by musical instruments, particularly stringed instruments {{such as the}} electric guitar, electric bass guitar, Chapman Stick, or electric violin, and converts them to an electrical signal that is amplified using an instrument amplifier (such as a guitar amplifier) to produce musical sounds through a loudspeaker in a speaker enclosure. The signal from a pickup can also be recorded directly, using a DI box (a common practice with the electric bass) or broadcast on the radio or television. Most electric guitars and electric basses use magnetic pickups. Acoustic guitars, upright basses and fiddles often use a piezoelectric pickup.|$|R
50|$|That {{the output}} images are {{oriented}} {{the same way}} around (in the case of CCD image sensors). In the prism assembly illustrated above, where the red light is the direct path, the blue path is reflected once and the resultant image is not laterally inverted, unlike the red and green. In cameras using vacuum tube video <b>pickup</b> <b>devices</b> this was solved by merely reversing the connections for the line scan coils; with CMOS imagers, the row or column address sequence is simply reversed. But with CCD sensors {{it is necessary to}} build a mirror image sensor for one channel. The Philips prism assembly (center right) has all three color channels laterally inverted and can thus use three similar CCDs.|$|R
