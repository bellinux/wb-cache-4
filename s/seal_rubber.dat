50|$|The seal is {{designed}} to have a point contact between the O-ring and sealing faces. This allows a high local stress, able to contain high pressure, without exceeding the yield stress of the O-ring body. The flexible nature of O-ring materials accommodates imperfections in the mounting parts. But {{it is still important}} to maintain good surface finish of those mating parts, especially at low temperatures where the <b>seal</b> <b>rubber</b> reaches its glass transition temperature and becomes increasingly crystalline. Surface finish is also especially important in dynamic applications. A surface finish that is too rough will abrade the surface of the O-ring, and a surface that is too smooth will not allow the seal to be adequately lubricated by a fluid film.|$|E
40|$|Abradable <b>seal</b> <b>rubber</b> {{has been}} widely used in aero-engine fans to improve their {{efficiency}} by reducing the clearance between rotating and stationary components. To investigate the high-speed scraping behavior between a vulcanized silicone rubber and a Ti- 6 Al- 4 V fan blade and evaluate the abradable performance of <b>seal</b> <b>rubber,</b> abrasion tests were conducted at a blade tip velocity of 50 – 300  m/s with an incursion rate of 100  μm/s. The influences of the blade tip velocity on the wear mechanism and interaction forces were specially analyzed. It is shown that abrasive wear and pattern wear are the predominant wear mechanisms, and pattern wear {{can be seen as}} the emergence and propagation of cracks. With an increase of the blade tip velocity, both of the final incursion depth and wear mass loss of <b>seal</b> <b>rubber</b> exhibit growth trends. The gradual changes of rubbing forces with an increase of rubbing time are the characteristic of abrasive wear, and force curves with unstable mutations are a reflection of pattern wear. At a constant incursion rate of 100  μm/s, the maximum values of interaction forces decrease first and then grow with an increase of the blade tip velocity, and the blade tip velocity of 150  m/s becomes the cut-off point between abrasive wear and pattern wear...|$|E

40|$|Part 5 : Aeronautical and Automotive EngineeringInternational audienceThis paper reviews a {{countermeasure}} {{development of}} leakage from coolant seals of head-gaskets in a diesel engine applying the Decomposition Analysis and Resolution Process (DAR). We can find complexity arising from some causes of leakage {{even in a}} simple square-ring rubber seal. The major causes are (1) large displacement around a head-gasket generated by the combustion, (2) seal distortion at a high compression, (3) <b>seal</b> <b>rubber</b> degradation induced by coolant microorganism deterioration, (4) uncontrolled seal production and (5) unsuitable rubber composition. Through our DAR, we can resolve {{the complexity of the}} leakage and can clarify all the cause positions and their relationships. We can confirm that an improved silicone rubber seal, which has a higher fatigue strength, an excellent acid-resistance and a uniform contact property, is the correct resolution.

30|$|The proper {{assembly}} of underground precast concrete structures is often {{critical in the}} construction of underground structures. In particular, interfacial waterproofing between precast concrete segments is a key factor influencing use, safety, and life span. Current practice is to incorporate waterproofing rubber strips in the design. During the installation process, compressive stress is applied to the strip by post-tensioning to achieve performance. For this paper, lateral constraint compression tests were carried out on composite <b>rubber</b> <b>seal</b> strips that utilize putty. Special waterproofing and sealing test devices were designed to investigate corresponding relationships between water pressure and compressive stress (or strain). A relationship between water resistance pressure and compression stress and strain of the putty-based composite rubber strip was proposed based on the series tests and the control target of the minimum compression strain of the putty composite rubber strip was then suggested. Finally, full-scale waterproofing tests on tunnel joints were conducted. The experimental results provide a scientific reference for the engineering application and design of composite <b>sealing</b> <b>rubber</b> strips putty for underground post-tensioned precast concrete structures.|$|R
