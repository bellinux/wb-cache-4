However, a most adequate feasibility of <b>CHP</b> <b>systems</b> {{must be based on}} energy consumption followed by economic considerations. <b>CHP</b> <b>systems</b> designs must yield economical savings, but more importantly must yield real energy savings based on the best energy performance. For <b>CHP</b> <b>systems,</b> energy savings is related to primary energy and not to site energy. This paper presents a mathematical analysis demonstrating that <b>CHP</b> <b>systems</b> increase the site energy consumption (SEC).

For a <b>CHP</b> <b>system</b> with a natural gas engine as the prime mover, {{the difference between the}} price of natural gas and the price of purchased electricity, called spark spread, is an indicator as to whether a <b>CHP</b> <b>system</b> might be considered or not.

An expression for the spark spread based on the cost of the fuel and some of the <b>CHP</b> <b>system</b> efficiencies is presented in this paper as well as an expression for the payback period for a given capital cost and spark spread. The developed expressions allow determining the required spark spread for a <b>CHP</b> <b>system</b> to produce a net operational savings over the SHP in terms of the performance of system components.

40|$|Combined {{heat and}} power (<b>CHP)</b> <b>systems,</b> also {{referred}} to as cogeneration, generate on-site electricity and useful thermal energy in a single integrated system. As a result, well-designed <b>CHP</b> <b>systems</b> consume less fuel than would be required to obtain electricity and thermal energy separately. Since less fuel is consumed, <b>CHP</b> <b>systems</b> offer greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction benefits over the conventional method of obtaining heat from a boiler and power from the electric grid. Additionally, since <b>CHP</b> <b>system</b> energy is consumed on-site as a form of distributed generation (DG), no energy is lost through transmission, adding to the energy savings. CHP can also provide opportunities to use renewable fuels.

40|$|Abstract Background Combined Heat and Power (<b>CHP)</b> <b>systems</b> {{can provide}} a range of {{benefits}} to users with regards to efficiency, reliability, costs and environmental impact. Furthermore, {{increasing the amount of}} electricity generated by <b>CHP</b> <b>systems</b> in the United States has been identified as having significant potential for impressive economic and environmental outcomes on a national scale. Given the benefits from increasing the adoption of CHP technologies, there is value in improving our understanding of how desired increases in CHP adoption can be best achieved. These obstacles are currently understood to stem from regulatory as well as economic and technological barriers. In our research, we answer the following questions: Given the current policy and economic environment facing the CHP industry, what changes need to take place in this space in order for <b>CHP</b> <b>systems</b> to be competitive in the energy market? Methods We focus our analysis primarily on Combined Heat and Power Systems that use natural gas turbines. Our analysis takes a two-pronged approach. We first conduct a statistical analysis of the impact of state policies on increases in electricity generated from <b>CHP</b> <b>system.</b> Second, we conduct a Cost-Benefit analysis to determine in which circumstances funding incentives are necessary to make CHP technologies cost-competitive. Results Our policy analysis shows that regulatory improvements do not explain the growth in adoption of CHP technologies but hold the potential to encourage increases in electricity generated from <b>CHP</b> <b>system</b> in small-scale applications. Our Cost-Benefit analysis shows that <b>CHP</b> <b>systems</b> are only cost competitive in large-scale applications and that funding incentives would be necessary to make CHP technology cost-competitive in small-scale applications. Conclusion From the synthesis of these analyses we conclude that because large-scale applications of natural gas turbines are already cost-competitive, policy initiatives aimed at a CHP market dominated primarily by large-scale (and therefore already cost-competitive) systems have not been effectively directed. Our recommendation is that for CHP technologies using natural gas turbines, policy focuses should be on increasing CHP growth in small-scale systems. This result can be best achieved through redirection of state and federal incentives, research and development, adoption of smart grid technology, and outreach and education. </p...|$|R

The system generates constant electric power (selling excess power back to the grid when it is not consumed), {{and at the same time}} produces hot air and water from the waste heat. As the result <b>CHP</b> <b>systems</b> have the potential to save primary energy as they can make use of waste heat which is generally rejected by thermal energy conversion systems. A typical capacity range of home fuel cell is 1-3 kWel / 4-8 kWth. <b>CHP</b> <b>systems</b> linked to absorption chillers use their waste heat for refrigeration.|$|R
