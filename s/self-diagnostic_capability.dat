The radiometer has microwave channels at 20. 7, 22. 2, and 31. 4 GHz, and includes new features which should promote radiometric precision {{while at the same}} time reduce instrument complexity. The instrument will be compact, portable, and will possess a <b>self-diagnostic</b> <b>capability</b> to ensure reliability.

40|$|Due {{to growth}} of {{mechanisation}} and automation, today’s industrial systems {{are becoming more}} complex. A small breakdown of any non-redundant machine component affects {{the operation of the}} entire system. To increase the availability and reliability, automated health monitoring and <b>self-diagnostic</b> <b>capability</b> (SDC) becoming essential to many industrial machineries like pumps, motors, etc. Condition monitoring does not prevent the failure, but it can predict the possibility of future failure by measuring certain machine parameters. Though there are various condition monitoring techniques, vibration analysis and motor current signature analysis (MCSA) are most suitable for detection of faults and abnormalities in machine systems. This work attempts to develop an SDC framework and diagnose the impeller condition of a centrifugal pump using MCSA. Time and frequency domain analyses are done for different impeller conditions of the pump, such as normal impeller and defective impellers. Significant differences are observed and a fault prediction strategy is recommended. Peer reviewe...|$|E
25|$|The Fifth {{generation}} {{was equipped with}} an interchangeable extruder with some <b>self-diagnostics</b> <b>capabilities.</b> It was new {{in the market and}} supposed to help printer maintenance but reliability problem occurred with very short lifespan on the extruder, requiring frequent replacement at high cost. This led to a class action lawsuit which was dismissed Ultimately, Makerbot replaced the failing extruder with a new version.|$|R
50|$|The new {{generation}} of sensors use sound waves to measure wind speed and direction. The measurement {{is based on the}} time it takes for an ultrasonic pulse to travel from one transducer to another, which varies depending on - among other factors - the wind speed. The transit time is measured in both directions for several (usually two or three) pairs of the transducer heads. Based on those results, the sensor computes wind speed and direction. Compared to mechanical sensors, the ultrasonic sensors offer several advantages such as no moving parts, advanced <b>self-diagnostic</b> <b>capabilities</b> and reduced maintenance requirements.|$|R
50|$|The {{fire control}} system {{was able to}} access and process {{relevant}} target, environmental & gun status data from various internal and external sensors including laser rangefinders and thermal imagers {{in order for the}} main gun to be able to accurately & consistently hit targets under the most adverse of conditions (First shot, first kill). Major components of the FCS included the Fire Control Computer which was the 'brains' of the FCS, the Gun Control Equipment, and the STAMPLAR sight (see below), all of which were connected together by a fully digital databus. The FCS was also designed with <b>self-diagnostic</b> <b>capabilities.</b> The commander and gunner had duplicate turret/main gun controls, so either of them could aim and fire the main gun. Ammunition for the EXP-28M1 would have included APFSDS, APDS-T, HEAT, HESH, and Smoke-WP rounds.|$|R
40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 13 - 16, 1986 / Riviera Hotel, Las Vegas, NevadaEngineers {{developing}} specialized telemetry {{systems do}} not always have {{the vantage point of}} the user of their systems. The requirements of an upper air sounding system may seem straightforward at first; but, when the meteorologist’s viewpoint is considered, the engineering problems become more difficult than originally perceived. This paper discusses the Meteorological Data System (AN/GMD- 5) manufactured by Space Data Corporation for the U. S. Air Force. The GMD- 5 is designed to be a militarized, rugged, portable replacement of the World War II vintage GMD- 1. It can be set up in the field and provide automatic, real-time data reduction of a rawinsonde flight within two hours of arrival at a site. The system has an extensive <b>self-diagnostic</b> <b>capability</b> such that a trained meteorological operator could troubleshoot faults and correct them down to the circuit board level. This paper presents the problems involved in designing a telemetry system that will work in field environments and will be easy to use by meteorological technicians. The whole system, including the sonde (both sensors and telemetering system), the tracker, telemetry decoder, and data processing systems, is presented, and the problems associated with the system’s performance and accuracy are discussed from the meteorologist’s point of view, followed by the engineer’s solution to these problems...|$|E
40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 29 -November 02, 1990 / Riviera Hotel and Convention Center, Las Vegas, NevadaThe seven WSMR Transportable Telemetry Acquisition Systems (TTAS), {{have served}} WSMR well as primary {{telemetry}} tracking systems since their acquisition {{over twenty years}} ago. Increasing maintenance demands for the original analog position control system (the antenna feed, servo power amplifiers, and position compensation) coupled {{with the potential for}} substantial tracking system performance improvement and <b>self-diagnostic</b> <b>capability</b> offered by current technology led to the establishment of a new instrumentation development task at WSMR whose objective was {{the development of a new}}, almost totally digital prototype tracking system to replace the aging analog control system in one of the TTAS’s. A modern conical scan feed has replaced the original monopulse feed, pulse-width-modulated power amplifiers have replaced the originals using SCR’s, and a VMEbus-based computer using a real-time operating system has replaced the analog compensation and overall control of the system. In this paper, following an overview of the prototype tracking system, the results of the development of a new position control algorithm for the prototype tracking system are described using root loci, computer simulation, and from the actual tracking system using servo test software developed for the computer controller. The results of the study of the old analog control system using computer simulation are presented for comparison. Problems encountered with the TTAS directly affecting position control are also presented. The new position control algorithm was designed to accommodate all of the critical tracking system nonlinearities (power amplifier saturation, current limiting, dead band, and control output saturation), all tracking modes (autotrack, manual, and using external pointing data), different operating bandwidths, and all possible drive inputs to the system. It has converted the tracking system from a type- 1 to a type- 2 control system improving the dynamic capability of the TTAs...|$|E
40|$|The {{adoption}} of efficient online fault detection and isolation (FDI) tools is becoming {{of the utmost}} importance for robots, especially for those operating in remote or hazardous environments, where a high degree of safety and <b>self-diagnostics</b> <b>capabilities</b> is required. In this paper a new observer-based approach to fault detection and isolation for robot manipulators is proposed. A nonlinear observer of the system's outputs, joint position and velocities, is designed directly in the discrete-time domain; in order to improve the robustness of the observer to unknown dynamics and discretization errors, a linear feedback of the observation error and a delayed nonlinear compensation action are added. The residuals for the detection of both sensor and actuator failures are then generated from the observation errors. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach, even if a relatively low sampling rate is adopted and in the presence of large modeling error...|$|R
40|$|The {{design and}} {{characterization}} in high-voltage (HV) -CMOS technology of an innovative intelligent power switch (IPS) for harsh automotive applications is proposed in this paper. To safely handle the ordinary and extraordinary automotive electrical and environmental conditions, a systematic design flow is followed: several design solutions are {{presented at the}} architectural and circuital level, integrating on-chip <b>self-diagnostic</b> <b>capabilities</b> and full protection against the high voltage and reverse polarity, the effects of wiring parasitics, and the over-current and over-temperature phenomena. Moreover, the current slope and soft start integrated techniques ensure a low electromagnetic interference, and the IPS is also configurable to efficiently drive different interchangeable loads. The innovative IPS has been implemented in a 0. 35 -mu m HV-CMOS technology and has been embedded in mechatronic third generation brush-holder regulator system-on-chip for an automotive alternator. The electrical simulations and experimental characterization and the testing at component and on-board system levels prove that the proposed design allows a compact and smart power switch realization facing the harshest automotive conditions...|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} decade {{considerable}} research efforts have been spent to seek for systematic approaches to Fault Diagnosis (FD) in dynamical systems. Special attention has been put in robotic systems, especially for those operating in remote or hazardous environments, where {{a high degree of}} safety as well as <b>self-diagnostics</b> <b>capabilities</b> are required. On the other hand, the development of effective strategies of fault diagnosis for robot manipulators operating in an industrial context is a critical research task. Several FD techniques for robot manipulators have been proposed in the literature, although the problem of their application to industrial robots has not been extensively investigated. In this chapter different discretetime observer-based approaches to FD for mechanical manipulators are presented and critically compared. First, a rough FD technique is considered, which is based solely on the prediction capabilities of the manipulator dynamic model. Next, an observer-based technique is presented, where a robust time-delayed compensation is introduced to cope with disturbances and modeling uncertainties. Finally, two different observer-based schemes are developed, where the uncertain terms in the model are dynamically estimated: the first scheme is based on the recursive estimation of the uncertain terms, while the second one adaptively estimates the parameters of a suitable parametric model of the uncertainties. All the considered schemes are experimentally tested on a six-degree-of-freedom industrial robot and the performance are critically compared each other...|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{this project}} is to provide <b>self-diagnostic</b> <b>capabilities</b> to the thermal {{protection}} systems (TPS) of future spacecraft. Self-diagnosis is especially important in thermal protection systems (TPS), where large numbers of parts must survive extreme conditions after weeks or years in space. In-service inspections of these systems are difficult or impossible, yet their reliability must be ensured before atmospheric entry. In fact, TPS represents the greatest risk factor after propulsion for any transatmospheric mission. The concepts {{and much of the}} technology would be applicable not only to the Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV), but also to ablative thermal protection for aerocapture and planetary exploration. Monitoring a thermal protection system on a Shuttle-sized vehicle is a daunting task: there are more than 26, 000 components whose integrity must be verified with very low rates of both missed faults and false positives. The large number of monitored components precludes conventional approaches based on centralized data collection over separate wires; a distributed approach is necessary to limit the power, mass, and volume of the health monitoring system. Distributed intelligence with self-diagnosis further improves capability, scalability, robustness, and reliability of the monitoring subsystem. A distributed system of intelligent sensors can provide an assurance of the integrity of the system, diagnosis of faults, and condition-based maintenance, all with provable bounds on errors...|$|R

The relationship between the mechanical stress applied, both in axial and flexural mode and the electrical properties of an epoxy composite, are analyzed. The electrical resistance or impedance of the nanocomposites samples are strongly affected by the applied mechanical stress. The present work aims at investigating the possible use of the nanotechnology towards the development of embedded sensor systems in composite structures having <b>self-diagnostic</b> functionalities and <b>capability</b> of provide real-time structural health monitoring...|$|R
2500|$|On-board {{diagnostics}} (OBD) is an automotive term {{referring to}} a vehicle's <b>self-diagnostic</b> and reporting <b>capability.</b> OBD systems give the vehicle owner or repair technician access {{to the status of}} the various vehicle subsystems. The amount of diagnostic information available via OBD has varied widely since its introduction in the early 1980s versions of on-board vehicle computers. Early versions of OBD would simply illuminate a malfunction indicator light or [...] "idiot light" [...] if a problem was detected but would not provide any information as {{to the nature of the}} problem. Modern OBD implementations use a standardized digital communications port to provide real-time data in addition to a standardized series of diagnostic trouble codes, or DTCs, which allow one to rapidly identify and remedy malfunctions within the vehicle.|$|R
40|$|Smart ” or {{adaptable}} sensors {{are considered}} as “modern sensor technologies ” that exhibit {{a high rate}} of growth (10 %/year as opposed to 4 %/year of “traditional technologies”) in the global market with an estimated worth between $ 15 -$ 25 billion 1, 2, 3, 4. “Smart sensors ” are generally thought to be able to adapt themselves automatically to the measuring task and/or to have <b>self-diagnostic</b> and self-calibration <b>capabilities.</b> Development of sensors with increased level of functionality will be the key in the development of new sensing technologies and their application in wide variety of industries (e. g. environmental, food, pharmaceutical, automotive, sport etc). A very exciting research direction is where sensors are integrated with “smart materials ” or materials capable of responding to external stimulus via an active control mechanism. Applications are invited from UK/EU Nationals for a 3 -year PhD studentship on a joint project between Keele University, UK and Clark University, USA. The two groups will team up in order to (a) design and synthesize hybrid materials capable of changing physico-chemical properties when exposed to external stimuli and (b) use these stimuli-responsive materials as the active layer for chemical sensors capable of modulating their selectivity upon change...|$|R
40|$|Testing {{for plant}} {{experiments}} in space {{has begun to}} explore active nutrient delivery concepts in which water and nutrients are replenished on a continuous basis for long-term growth. The goal {{of this study is}} to develop a novel microsensor array to provide information on the dissolved oxygen environment in the plant root zone for the optimum control of hydroponics and solid substrate plant cultivation systems in the space environment. Miniaturized polarographic dissolved oxygen sensors have been designed and fabricated on a flexible Kapton (trademark) (polyimide) substrate. Two capabilities of the new microsensor array were explored. First, measurements of dissolved oxygen in the plant root zone in hydroponics and solid substrate culture systems were made. The microsensor array was fabricated on a flexible substrate, and then cut out into a mesh type to make a suspended array that could be placed either in a hydroponics system or in a solid substrate cultivation system to measure the oxygen environments. Second, the in situ <b>self-diagnostic</b> and self-calibration <b>capability</b> (two-point for oxygen) was adopted by dynamically controlling the microenvironment in close proximity to the microsensors. With a built-in generating electrode that surrounds the microsensor, two kinds of microenvironments (oxygen-saturated and oxygen-depleted phases) could be established by water electrolysis depending on the polarity of the generating electrode. The unique features of the new microsensor array (small size, multiple sensors, flexibility and self-diagnosis) can have exceptional benefits for the study and optimization of plant cultivation systems in both terrestrial and microgravity environments. The in situ self-diagnostic and self-calibration features of the microsensor array will also enable continuous verification of the operability during entire plant growth cycles. This concept of automated control of a novel chemical monitoring system will minimize crew time required for maintenance, as well as reduce volume, mass, and power consumption by eliminating bulky diagnosis systems including calibrant (fluid and gas) reservoir and flow system hardware...|$|R
