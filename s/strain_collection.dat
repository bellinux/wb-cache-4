40|$|Abstract Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis are {{important}} urinary tract pathogens. The constant {{increase in the}} antibiotic resistance of clinical bacterial strains has become an important clinical problem. The {{aim of this study}} was to compare the antibiotic resistance of 141 clinical (Sweden and Poland) and 42 laboratory (Czech Republic) P. mirabilis strains and 129 clinical (Poland) uropathogenic E. coli strains. The proportion of unique versus diverse patterns in Swedish clinical and laboratory P. mirabilis <b>strain</b> <b>collections</b> was comparable. Notably, a similar proportion of unique versus diverse patterns was observed in Polish clinical P. mirabilis and E. coli <b>strain</b> <b>collections.</b> Mathematical models of the antibiotic resis-tance of E. coli and P. mirabilis strains based on Kohonen networks and association analysis are presented. In contrast to the three clinical <b>strain</b> <b>collections,</b> which revealed complex associations with the antibiotics tested, laboratory P. mirabilis strains provided simple antibiotic association diagrams. The monitoring of antibiotic resistance patterns of clinical E. coli and P. mirabilis strains plays an impor-tant role in the treatment procedures for urinary tract infections and is important in the context of the spreading drug resistance in uropathogenic strain populations.

40|$|Abstract Background Class 1 integrons contain genetic {{elements}} for site-specific recombination, capture and mobilization of resistance genes. Studies investigating the prevalence, distribution {{and types of}} integron located resistance genes are important for surveillance of antimicrobial resistance and to understand resistance development at the molecular level. Methods We determined the prevalence and genetic content of class 1 integrons in Enterobacteriaceae (<b>strain</b> <b>collection</b> 1, n = 192) and E. coli (<b>strain</b> <b>collection</b> 2, n = 53) from bloodstream infections in patients from six Norwegian hospitals by molecular techniques. Class 1 integrons were also characterized in 54 randomly selected multiresistant E. coli isolates from gastrointestinal human infections (<b>strain</b> <b>collection</b> 3). Results Class 1 integrons were present in 10. 9 % of the Enterobacteriaceae blood culture isolates of collection 1, all but one (S. Typhi) being E. coli. Data indicated variations in class 1 integron prevalence between hospitals. Class 1 integrons were present in 37 % and 34 % of the resistant blood culture isolates (collection 1 and 2, respectively) and in 42 % of the resistant gastrointestinal E. coli. We detected a total of 10 distinct integron cassette PCR amplicons that varied in size between 0. 15 kb and 2. 2 kb and contained between zero and three resistance genes. Cassettes encoding resistance to trimethoprim and aminoglycosides were most common. We identified and characterized a novel plasmid-located integron with a cassette-bound novel gene (linF) located downstream of an aadA 2 gene cassette. The linF gene encoded a putative 273 aa lincosamide nucleotidyltransferase resistance protein and conferred resistance to lincomycin and clindamycin. The deduced LinF amino acid sequence displayed approximately 35 % identity to the Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus faecalis nucleotidyl transferases encoded by linB and linB ' Conclusions The present study demonstrated an overall low and stable prevalence of class 1 integron gene cassettes in clinical Enterobacteriaceae and E. coli isolates in Norway.

40|$|Published {{studies of}} rhizobial populations, {{communities}} and other <b>strain</b> <b>collections</b> were analysed to identify trends in strain richness, strain dominance and genetic diversity {{within and between}} locations. For individual populations and communities, strain richness indices were calculated by dividing the number of strain types identified {{by the number of}} isolates recovered. Where possible, strain dominance (the proportion of rhizobial isolates represented by each strain type) was also calculated. Analysis of the genetic diversity of populations, communities and rhizobial <b>strain</b> <b>collections</b> originating from diverse legume hosts and locations, was confined to studies using multilocus enzyme electrophoresis (MLEE) so that diversity could be compared on the basis of published H values. Strain richness indices were highly variable (0. 02 - 0. 94) and were influenced by both the discriminatory power of the strain typing method and the type and number of legume species used to recover rhizobia from soil. The strain richness of populations recovered either directly from soil, or from the nodules of trap hosts inoculated with the same soil, was similar. Because the arithmetic relationship between the number of strain types and number of isolates varies between different populations and communities, strain richness curves are proposed as the most appropriate method for reporting rhizobial structural diversity. Comparison of over 50 rhizobial populations and communities from published studies showed that strain dominance patterns in nodules were often similar. Typically, a single strain type occupies more than 30 % of nodules with the majority of strain types being recovered at low frequency (∼ 75 % of published populations and communities). Rhizobial populations and communities characterised by MLEE varied in their genetic diversity, with H values ranging from 0. 06 to 0. 78. In several studies, most of the genetic diversity within a site could be recovered from the nodules of a single plant. When hierarchical analyses were performed on populations within and between sites, the genetic diversity within sites was similar to the genetic diversity between sites. Similarly, the genetic diversity of <b>strain</b> <b>collections</b> originating from multiple hosts and locations was no more diverse than some individual populations and communities. Strain richness and genetic diversity measures were not always correlated for rhizobial populations. Populations with low strain richness were sometimes genetically diverse, and the relationship between the diversity measures varied for different legume species at the same location. We suggest that both strain richness and genetic diversity measures are required to fully describe rhizobial population and community diversity...|$|R

In this study we comparatively evaluated the usefulness of rep-PCR typing with two sets of well-defined collections of Staphylococcus aureus strains. Rep-PCR analysis of the first collection of S. aureus strains (n = 59) and one Staphylococcus intermedius strain showed 14 different rep-PCR patterns, with each pattern harboring 6 to 15 DNA fragments. The discriminatory power of rep-PCR typing compared well to those of arbitrarily primed PCR (average of 20 types) and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (11 types). S. aureus <b>strain</b> <b>collection</b> I comprised four outbreak-related groups of isolates. The isolates in only one group were found to have identical rep-PCR profiles. However, in an analysis of isolates from three additional independent local outbreaks (n for outbreaks 1 and 2 = 5, n for outbreak 3 = 12), identical rep-PCR types were found among strains isolated during each outbreak. Therefore, we conclude that rep-PCR genotyping may be an easy and fast method for monitoring of the epidemiology of nosocomial Staphylococcus infections. Rep-PCR analysis of <b>strain</b> <b>collection</b> II, which consisted of epidemic and nonepidemic methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) strains, revealed that a cluster of similar rep-PCR profiles was found among MRSA isolates which were more frequently isolated and which were most often associated with outbreaks...|$|E
