40|$|Aims: <b>Streakline</b> and its {{visualization}} {{and production}} techniques {{are one of}} important indices for fluid dynamics, civil engineering, material engineering, and so on. In chaotic or turbulent flow field where global mixing occurs, fluid trajectory exponentially expands in particular directions. Consequently, it is quite difficult to visualize streak as a “line” because experimental streak behaves as a “sheet” that has rounded surface. In the present study, to product and visualize a vivid and distinct <b>streakline,</b> a non-ionic surfactant was utilized. Study Design: Experimental study containing simulation. Place and Duration of Study: Division of Chemical Engineering, Department of Materials Engineering Science, Graduate School of Engineering Science, Osaka University, between December 2010 and October 2011. Methodology: The novel production and visualization technique for vivid <b>streakline</b> in three-dimensional (3 D) flow field was developed. The innovative characteristic of visualization technique is that the expansion of streak can be suppressed by the surface tension with the self-assembly of surfactant molecules in the tracer fluid. The impelleragitated tank was adopted as an unsteady 3 D flow system. A non-ionic surfactant, "Emulgen 103  (Kao Co., Ltd., polyoxyethylenelaurylether) was adopted, whose concentration was optimized at about 9 mass% in advance. Results: The obtained <b>streakline</b> could keep the linear form {{for a long time}} not to expand, and there was little leakage of colored component due to the effect of molecular diffusion. The <b>streakline</b> could circulate freely in the tank; nevertheless its linear structure was maintained for a long time even if the <b>streakline</b> collided with the tank wall and impeller blades. The periodical consistency of <b>streakline</b> structure could be confirmed, which was one of necessary and sufficient conditions for the movement of <b>streakline</b> with flow field. Conclusion: This study clearly demonstrates the production method of vivid <b>streakline</b> with the help of surfactant. While this technique has a little room for additional refinement, the present technique may be used and developed for future science and practical applications...|$|E

30|$|For the interplanetary field, {{the corona}} issues {{out of the}} Sun’s upper atmosphere, above a source surface (Schatten et al. 1969) and acts as a tracer of the flow, hence the field moves in a <b>streakline,</b> {{remaining}} “attached to one point which issues the field forth into space. The particles, however, move in pathlines, more usually understood, if called by the non-fluid term the trajectory of the particles. Schatten (2001) outlines the differences of these patterns, and provides illustrations, with formulae and calculations showing the differences. The pathline is generally well understood, one just follows the path/trajectory of the particles moving forwards in time. What is not generally understood, except by fluid dynamicists, is the streakline; often this is misunderstood and taken to be the time independent streamline, however, {{this is only the}} case for time independent flow.

40|$|Abstract. Based on the Lagrangian {{framework}} for fluid dynamics, a <b>streakline</b> representation of flow {{is presented to}} solve computer vision problems involving crowd and traffic flow. Streaklines are traced in a fluid flow by injecting color material, such as smoke or dye, which is transported with the flow and used for visualization. In the context of computer vision, streaklines {{may be used in}} a similar way to transport information about a scene, and they are obtained by repeatedly initializing a fixed grid of particles at each frame, then moving both current and past particles using optical flow. Streaklines are the locus of points that connect particles which originated from the same initial position. In this paper, a <b>streakline</b> technique is developed to compute several important aspects of a scene, such as flow and potential functions using the Helmholtz decomposition theorem. This leads to a representation of the flow that more accurately recognizes spatial and temporal changes in the scene, compared with other commonly used flow representations. Application...|$|E

40|$|Numerical {{simulations}} of complex 3 D time-dependent (unsteady) flows {{are becoming increasingly}} feasible because of the progress in computing systems. Unfortunately, many existing flow visualization systems were developed for time-independent (steady) solutions and do not adequately depict solutions from unsteady flow simulations. Furthermore, most systems only handle one time step of the solutions individually and do not consider the time-dependent nature of the solutions. For example, instantaneous streamlines are computed by tracking the particles using one time step of the solution. However, for <b>streaklines</b> and timelines, particles need to be tracked through all time steps. <b>Streaklines</b> can reveal quite different information about the flow than those revealed by instantaneous streamlines. Comparisons of instantaneous streamlines with dynamic <b>streaklines</b> are shown. For a complex 3 D flow simulation, {{it is common to}} generate a grid system with several millions of grid points and to have tens of thousands of time steps. The disk requirement for storing the flow data can easily be tens of gigabytes. Visualizing solutions of this magnitude is a challenging problem with today's computer hardware technology.
