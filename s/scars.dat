5|$|Atrophic acne <b>scars</b> {{have lost}} {{collagen}} from the healing response {{and are the}} most common type of acne scar (account for approximately 75% of all acne <b>scars).</b> They may be further classified as ice-pick <b>scars,</b> boxcar <b>scars,</b> and rolling <b>scars.</b> Ice-pick <b>scars</b> are narrow (less than 2mm across), deep <b>scars</b> that extend into the dermis. Boxcar <b>scars</b> are round or ovoid indented <b>scars</b> with sharp borders and vary in size from 1.5–4mm across. Rolling <b>scars</b> are wider than icepick and boxcar <b>scars</b> (4–5mm across) and have a wave-like pattern of depth in the skin.|$|E
5|$|Hypertrophic <b>scars</b> are uncommon, and are {{characterized}} by increased collagen content after the abnormal healing response. They are described as firm and raised from the skin. Hypertrophic <b>scars</b> remain within the original margins of the wound, whereas keloid <b>scars</b> can form scar tissue outside of these borders. Keloid <b>scars</b> from acne occur more often in men and people with darker skin, and usually occur on {{the trunk of the}} body.|$|E
5|$|Acne <b>scars</b> {{are caused}} by {{inflammation}} within the dermal layer of skin and are estimated to affect 95% of people with acne vulgaris. The scar is created by abnormal healing following this dermal inflammation. Scarring {{is most likely to}} take place with severe acne, but may occur with any form of acne vulgaris. Acne <b>scars</b> are classified based on whether the abnormal healing response following dermal inflammation leads to excess collagen deposition or loss {{at the site of the}} acne lesion.|$|E

40|$|Objective: <b>Scar</b> endometriosis {{is a rare}} condition. We {{report a}} case of <b>scar</b> endometriosis {{occurring}} {{at the site of}} an old cesarean section <b>scar.</b> Case Report: A 29 -year-old multiparous woman complained of painful sensation during menstruation for 2 years that occurred at the site of her cesarean section surgical <b>scar.</b> On examination, there was a firm nodule measuring 2 × 1. 5 cm in size at the mid-point of the <b>scar.</b> In view of the possibility of <b>scar</b> endometriosis, the mass was completely excised. Pathologic findings were compatible with <b>scar</b> endometriosis. Postoperatively, danazol was prescribed to prevent recurrence. Conclusion: A surgical <b>scar</b> becoming painful and swollen during menstruation is the classic symptom of <b>scar</b> endometriosis. Causes include iatrogenic transplantation of endometrium to the surgical wound. Surgical excision is the main treatment. Postoperative GnRH-agonist or danazol may be prescribed to patients with <b>scar</b> endometriosis...|$|R
5|$|Chemical peels {{can be used}} {{to reduce}} the {{appearance}} of acne <b>scars.</b> Mild peels include those using glycolic acid, lactic acid, salicylic acid, Jessner's solution, or a lower concentrations (20%) of trichloroacetic acid. These peels only affect the epidermal layer of the skin and can be useful in the treatment of superficial acne <b>scars</b> as well as skin pigmentation changes from inflammatory acne. Higher concentrations of trichloroacetic acid (30–40%) are considered to be medium-strength peels and affect skin as deep as the papillary dermis. Formulations of trichloroacetic acid concentrated to 50% or more are considered to be deep chemical peels. Medium-strength and deep-strength chemical peels are more effective for deeper atrophic <b>scars,</b> but are more likely to cause side effects such as skin pigmentation changes, infection, and small white superficial cysts known as milia.|$|E
5|$|Dermabrasion is an {{effective}} therapeutic procedure for reducing the appearance of superficial atrophic <b>scars</b> of the boxcar and rolling varieties. Ice-pick <b>scars</b> do not respond well to treatment with dermabrasion due to their depth. The procedure is painful and has many potential side effects such as skin sensitivity to sunlight, redness, and decreased pigmentation of the skin.

40|$|Aim: Mastectomy is a {{variable}} {{associated with increased}} incidence of upperbody morbidity after breast cancer. <b>Scar</b> severity may contribute to this risk; however, there is no recognized mastectomy <b>scar</b> assessment. The Observer Scale (OS) from Patient and Observer <b>Scar</b> Assessment Scale has been evaluated in breast linear <b>scar</b> research but not for mastectomy <b>scar</b> tissue. This study investigates the suitability of OS to rate <b>scar</b> severity of two common <b>scar</b> types after mastectomy. Method: Therapists indicating interest in mastectomy <b>scar</b> from Linkedin connections and Google searched websites (English) {{were invited to participate}} in an online survey. Each OS feature was surveyed for two scenarios: mastectomy linear <b>scar</b> (LS) and mastectomy chest wall adhesion (CWA) assessment. Therapists rated the level of importance of five additional instructions or skill requirements for each <b>scar</b> feature, with the aim of achieving a more reliable assessment of <b>scar</b> severity. Data from therapists reporting 2 + years of experience were evaluated. Results: 28 responders met the experience criteria. Each therapist evaluated 4 / 9 <b>scar</b> types after mastectomy and many evaluated 9 / 9. CWA and LS assessment rated as strongly important in their practice (71 % and 57 %). Responders had high agreement (> 90 %) with the level of importance (5 / 6 + 6 / 6) for: clothing removal instruction for six OS <b>scar</b> features (LS and CWA) and <b>scar</b> palpation skills for the pliability feature (CWA). Sound agreement (80 – 90 %) occurred for: <b>scar</b> palpation skills for vascularity (CWA), thickness and pliability features (LS) and knowledge of mastectomy <b>scar</b> types for thickness feature (LS and CWA). Reasonable agreement (70 – 80 %) occurred for: <b>scar</b> stretch instruction for vascularity feature (LS) and pliability feature (CWA) and knowledge of <b>scar</b> types for most <b>scar</b> features. Mixed opinion (< 55 %) occurred for importance of photographic examples. Conclusion: Modifications to OS instructions and observer training should be developed for mastectomy LS assessment. CWA assessment was more important for therapists, supporting the need for additional measurement tools for clinicians. Clarification of <b>scar</b> types evaluated in LS and CWA assessment is required as nine <b>scar</b> types are potentially within this zone...|$|R

5|$|In {{order to}} support the robust head, the neck of Hatzegopteryx was likely {{strongly}} muscled. On the occipital bones, the nuchal lines, which serve as muscular attachments, are very well-developed and bear prominent <b>scars.</b> These conceivably supported the transversospinalis muscles, which aid in extension and flexion {{of the head and}} neck. Likewise, the opisthotic process, neural spines, and zygapophyses all appeared to have been large and robust (with the latter bearing many pits and edges that likely represent muscle <b>scars),</b> and the basioccipital tuberosities were long; these all serve as points of attachment for various muscles of the head and neck. Although not entirely unmuscled, the neck of Arambourgiania probably would not have been as extensively muscled as that of Hatzegopteryx.|$|E

5|$|A common belief {{regarding}} self-harm {{is that it}} is an attention-seeking behaviour; however, in many cases, this is inaccurate. Many self-harmers {{are very}} self-conscious of their wounds and <b>scars</b> and feel guilty about their behaviour, leading them to {{go to great lengths to}} conceal their behaviour from others. They may offer alternative explanations for their injuries, or conceal their <b>scars</b> with clothing. Self-harm in such individuals may not be associated with suicidal or para-suicidal behaviour. People who self-harm are not usually seeking to end their own life; it has been suggested instead that they are using self-harm as a coping mechanism to relieve emotional pain or discomfort or as an attempt to communicate distress. Alternatively, interpretations based on the supposed lethality of a self-harm may not give clear indications as to its intent: life risking behaviour may have no suicidal intent, whilst seemingly superficial cuts may have been a suicide attempt.|$|E

40|$|Background: Cesarean section {{has come}} a long way from being a risky & {{restrictive}} surgery to one that is safe and quick. Due to a rise in the rates of primary caesarean section globally, repeat cesarean section has also become very common. The chief concern during labor with <b>scarred</b> uteri is that of <b>scar</b> rupture which can have devastating fetal and maternal consequences, including mortality. Several studies monitoring for the features of <b>scar</b> rupture like abnormal cardiotocography (CTG), severe abdominal pain persisting between contractions, acute onset <b>scar</b> tenderness, hematuria or abnormal vaginal bleeding, maternal tachycardia or shock, cessation of uterine activity and loss of station of the presenting part exist with the exception of <b>scar</b> tenderness which has not been evaluated separately in any study. The present prospective observational study was undertaken in a tertiary care hospital to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of <b>scar</b> tenderness as a sign of <b>scar</b> complications in labor. Methods: 78 women with one previous cesarean delivery in spontaneous labor at term undergoing trial of <b>scar</b> were monitored for progress of labor and observed for vaginal bleeding, <b>scar</b> tenderness, maternal pulse and blood pressure every 30 minutes. <b>Scar</b> tenderness was elicited by pressing below and behind the pubic symphysis in between uterine contractions while engaging the woman in conversation and noting for a visible wince. Fetal heart rate auscultation was done as per protocol. Trial of <b>scar</b> was terminated for <b>scar</b> tenderness, unexplained maternal tachycardia, fresh vaginal bleeding, fetal heart rate abnormalities and non-progress of labor. Results: The sensitivity and specificity of <b>scar</b> tenderness as a predictor of <b>scar</b> complications was 92. 3 % and 3. 8 %, while accuracy was 33. 3 %. The likelihood ratio of a positive sign of <b>scar</b> tenderness being associated with <b>scar</b> complications in labour is 1. 48. Maternal tachycardia was not a significant predictor of <b>scar</b> complications in labour (p value= 0. 2). Past history of D&E has relative risk of 2. 85 for <b>scar</b> complications. Conclusions: <b>Scar</b> tenderness is a sensitive sign of <b>scar</b> complications and should continue to be elicited for all women undergoing trial of labor after previous caesarean.
