25|$|Porter {{developed}} {{a framework for}} analyzing the profitability of industries and how those profits are divided among the participants in 1980. In five forces analysis he identified the forces that shape the industry structure or environment. The framework involves the bargaining power of buyers and suppliers, the threat of new entrants, the availability of <b>substitute</b> <b>products,</b> and the competitive rivalry of firms in the industry. These forces affect the organization's ability to raise its prices {{as well as the}} costs of inputs (such as raw materials) for its processes.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the most}} {{pressing}} and often difficult jobs of a mashgiach, however, is the checking in and verification of shipments. The mashgiach must ensure that every food product that arrives at the facility has a reliable hekhsher before it is used. Suppliers often <b>substitute</b> <b>products</b> {{that are out of}} stock with non-kosher products. Non-kosher establishments would generally not mind these substitutions. For a kosher establishment, however, these substitutions can cause major problems. If a product arrives without a hekhsher, the mashgiach must make sure the product is clearly marked as non-kosher and is not used, but returned to the supplier. Sometimes a product arrives that is purportedly kosher, but no hekhsher can be found. In this case, the mashgiach obtains a valid letter of certification from the certifying rabbi or kashrut agency, usually by contacting the manufacturer. In addition to checking hekhsherim, the mashgiach must also check that all meat products that arrive are double sealed, usually by inner and outer plastic bags or an inner plastic bag and a sealed box, and that all wine is kosher wine.|$|E

2500|$|The study Beyond Reference Pricing: Understanding Consumers’ Encounters with Unexpected Prices [...] (2003), {{indicated}} that when consumers experience an unexpected price encounter, they adopt three methods to reduce cognitive dissonance: (i) Employ {{a strategy of}} continual information; (ii) Employ a change in attitude; and (iii) [...] Engage in minimisation. Consumers employ the strategy of continual information by engaging in bias and searching for information that supports prior beliefs. Consumers might search for information about other retailers and <b>substitute</b> <b>products</b> consistent with their beliefs. Alternatively, consumers might change attitude, such as re-evaluating price in relation to external reference-prices or associating high prices and low prices with quality. Minimisation reduces {{the importance of the}} elements of the dissonance; consumers tend to minimise the importance of money, and thus of shopping around, saving, and finding a better deal.|$|E
40|$|Using {{the real}} game option approach, we analyze the {{two-stage}} preemptive patent-investment race between an incumbent and a challenger (new entrant) in a product market with profit flow uncertainty. The challenger can gain {{entry into the}} monopolized product market dominated by the incumbent by patenting related technologies for a <b>substitute</b> <b>product.</b> To maintain its monopolized advantage, the incumbent has an incentive to block challenger’s entry by patenting the <b>substitute</b> <b>product</b> before the challenger. Either firm can pay an upfront fee to gain an immediate acquisition of the patent, and subsequently holding the real option to develop the new <b>substitute</b> <b>product.</b> We provide a full characterization of the optimal strategies adopted by the incumbent and challenger firm in this asymmetric patent-investment race. In particular, we examine the phenomena of sleeping patent, where the patented product is not launched immediately into the product market...|$|R

40|$|The role of methyl {{radicals}} in the networking of sp 2 carbons {{has been}} explored through kinetic analysis of mass spectra of the gas-phase {{products of the}} pyrolysis of toluene and toluene/acetone mixtures. Pyrolytic reactions were performed in a flow tube reactor at temperatures of 1140 – 1320 K and a constant total pressure of 10. 38 Torr with a residence time of 0. 585 s. On addition of acetone, methyl <b>substituted</b> <b>products</b> and their derivatives were enhanced. Mass peaks were observed in several sequences at an interval of 14 mass units; these ions correspond to methyl <b>substituted</b> <b>products</b> formed {{as a result of}} hydrogen abstraction (−H) followed by methyl radical addition (+CH 3). Each major peak was usually preceded by a peak at two mass units lower, which was likely produced through dehydrogenation/dehydrocyclization (−H 2) of methyl <b>substituted</b> <b>products.</b> Detected species include a large number of alkyl, cyclotetrafused (CT), cyclopentafused (CP) mono-, di-, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) along with primary PAHs. The analysis showed that MAC (methyl addition/cyclization) has a unique capacity to induce the sequential growth of hexagonal networks of sp 2 carbons from all fusing sites [1] of a PAH. Moreover, MAC was found capable of answering an important question in PAH growth, which is expansion of the CT → CP → hexagonal network for which other reported mechanisms are inefficient...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} preemptive patenting in a two-stage real options {{game where}} an incumbent firm competes {{with a potential}} entrant firm for the patent of a <b>substitute</b> <b>product</b> in a product market with profit flow uncertainty. The incumbent suffers loss of monopoly in the product market if the entrant acquires the patent of a <b>substitute</b> <b>product</b> and later commercializes the product. Our patent-investment game model assumes that the entrant has complete information on the incumbent’s commercialization cost while the incumbent only knows {{the distribution of the}} entrant’s cost. We investigate the impact of information asymmetry on the preemption strategies adopted by the two competing firms on patenting the <b>substitute</b> <b>product</b> by comparing the optimal preemption strategies and the real option value functions of the two competing firms under complete information and information asymmetry. Our analysis reveals that the informationally disadvantaged incumbent always suffers from loss in its real option value of investment since it tends to act more aggressively in competing for the patent. On the other hand, the real option value of investment of the informationally advantaged entrant may be undermined or enhanced. The incumbent’s aggressive response under information asymmetry may lead to reversal of winner in the patent race. We also examine how information asymmetry may affect the occurrence of sleeping patent and the corresponding expected duration between the two stages of patenting and product commercialization...|$|R
50|$|Porter's five forces {{include three}} forces from 'horizontal' competition: {{the threat of}} <b>substitute</b> <b>products</b> or services, the threat of {{established}} rivals, {{and the threat of}} new entrants; and two forces from 'vertical' competition: the bargaining power of suppliers and the bargaining power of customers.|$|E
50|$|Four factors affect elasticity: {{the number}} of <b>substitute</b> <b>products</b> (or identities) {{in the market and}} their {{closeness}} to the good in question; effects from marginal consumers; complications from wholesale and retail marketing; and the temporal, informational, and transaction costs necessary for consumers to learn about and take advantage of competing products.|$|E
