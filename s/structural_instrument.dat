The focus is particularly on the variability of financial and economic rates of return and how to integrate this information in the EU co- financing mechanism. We investigate, through the analysis of variance of co-financing rate, to which extent variability of rates is due to structural characteristics (sectors, countries) or to the existence of a residual variance due both to specificity of the project and discretional element of the appraisal method, which may constitute an information noise. We find that the variance of co-financing rate across countries is poorly explained by different composition of sectors of investment. This suggests the need to reinforce a more consistent approach to evaluation and co-financing. We suggest some possible solutions.

However, it is difficult for the existing error compensation models to describe various factors, which affects the accuracy of AACMM. In this paper, a modeling and error compensation method for AACMM is proposed based on BP Neural Networks. According to the available measurements, the poses of the AACMM are used as the input, and the coordinates of the probe are used as the output of neural network. To avoid tedious training and improve the training efficiency and prediction accuracy, a data acquisition strategy is developed according to the actual measurement behavior in the joint space. A neural network model is proposed and analyzed by using the data generated via Monte-Carlo method in simulations. The structure and parameter settings of neural network are optimized to improve the prediction accuracy and training speed. Experimental studies have been conducted to verify the proposed algorithm with neural network compensation, which shows that 97 % error of the AACMM can be eliminated after compensation.

The research {{focus is on the}} empirical analysis of the variability of financial and economic rates of return and how to integrate this information in the EU co-financing mechanism. We investigate to what extent the variability of expected returns and of EU co-financing rates is due to structural project characteristics (sectors, countries) or to other unexplained factors, including errors in the appraisal. We find that while the absolute level of grants is related to sectors, the EU co-financing rate depends on countries. There is no justification in economic analysis of such a country bias, because the variability of economic rate of returns is unrelated either to sector or country factors. These findings points to the need of a more consistent approach to evaluation and EU co-financing of infrastructure supported by the EU funds. We suggest possible improvements, based on the idea to offer an incentive to projects with high-expected economic␣rates of return relative to a benchmark and showing ex-post the realism of the initial analysis.

40|$|The Sangiran Dome (Central Java, Indonesia), {{inscribed on}} the World Heritage List, {{is one of the}} most {{important}} sites regarding Homo erectus evolution and regarding hominids’ adaptation to isolated conditions during the Late Lower and Early Middle Pleistocene. Sangiran is a c. 50 sq. km large tectonic ‘boutonnière’ within the Solo depression, whose stratigraphy allows to describe the evolution of the area during the considered period, through the so-called Pucangan, Grenzbank and Kabuh series, influenced by eustatism, volcanism and also orogenesis. Archaeological sites are still rare in the dome, mostly found in the NNW and SSE areas. In the SSE quarter were discovered the oldest artefacts found in Sangiran, the Sangiran 17 Homo erectus fossil (with an almost complete face) and several important archaeological and paleontological sites. Our work focuses on this SSE part of the dome. Its primary objective is to correlate the various sites along a transect defined by the Pucung river between the Dayu and Pucung villages. Cartographic and structural records allow to locate the main sites along a synthetic stratigraphical log, and also to discriminate several structural zones (where the dip varies) linked to the formation of the dome. Our work provides a stratigraphical and <b>structural</b> <b>instrument</b> which is able to help future paleontological and archaeological surveys, allowing to infer the probable location of rich horizons in the topography. A group of stratigraphic sections were identified, recorded and described along the studied transect., in order to relate the evolution of the area between the Late Lower and the Early Middle Pleistocene. Near to the top of the transect, we studied in more details the PCTS site, were several excavation campaigns documented an Early Middle Pleistocene fauna, associated to lithic artifacts (including some using a raw material imported from remote areas) and to several Homo erectus remains. Analyses (granulometry, petrography, mineralogy and taphonomy of tuffaceous pebbles and gravels) helped to precise the deposition environments. This work show that there is little perspective to detail the palaeoclimatic evolution during the considered period in the Pucung area, mostly because of the overwhelming influence of volcanism, much more marked compared to other areas of the dome. It is likely that ‘hot’ volcanic effluients (e. g. volcanic surges) could deposit in the Pucung area. The comparison between the volcanic layers and the alluvial fossil-bearing deposits allows to formulate hypotheses regarding the formation and also the destruction of archaeological occupation layers. Eventually, several facies can be discriminated regarding the Grenzbank, transition zone between the Pucangan and Kabuh series...|$|E

Esse crescimento coloca as realidades das IES em contato direto com a necessidade {{nacional de}} parâmetros que possam sinalizar ao Ministério da Educação sobre aspectos destas realidades. Nosso estudo “PDI – Plano de Desenvolvimento Institucional, PPI – Projeto Pedagógico Institucional e PPC – Projeto Pedagógico de Curso, entre o dito e o feito, uma análise da implementação em Três IES/RS/Brasil” traz uma contribuição neste sentido, realizando uma análise reflexiva e crítica sobre as articulações havidas entre PDI, PPI e PPC/Pedagogia em três IES/RS/BRASIL, objetivando caracterizar elementos interagentes, efetivos, relevantes e significativos à trajetória de organização e implementação destes documentos nas suas realidades acadêmicas e pedagógicas, nos seus Cenários de Ambientação definidos como “A”, “B” e “C” e, com estes dados, organizar categorias temáticas. Os estudos de casos múltiplos, como metodologia de pesquisa, buscaram qualificar aspectos relativos às mudanças e desafios conceituais e de paradigmas, à qualidade dos processos interativos e às suas dimensões sociais. Tendo como referência as orientações legais do MEC/INEP/SINAES/DCNs, que regulam as Instituições de Ensino Superior, as tecituras dos textos caracterizam o quanto estes três documentos, exigidos pela Legislação vigente às IES, mantêm relações significativas entre o dito e o feito. As caracterizações e implementações apresentadas impõem especificidades que expressam a personalidade das IES, as problematizações trazem as práticas que identificam e delineiam estes limites e possibilidades, entendendo que, a cada novo elemento de descoberta, o texto da pesquisa pode reestruturar-se buscando uma construção “em navegação”. Algumas questões orientaram diretamente nossa Pesquisa: As IES pesquisadas possuem os três documentos, exigidos pelo MEC, como seus referenciais legais obrigatórios? Como foram construídos esses documentos e por quem? Como se dá a implementação desses documentos? O que eles representam na prática diária dos Alunos e Professores? A exigência legal do MEC apóia o desenvolvimento das IES ou se torna um mero instrumento de estrutura a ser apresentado oficialmente em ocasiões especiais? As novas demandas do Ensino Superior, colocadas nos documentos, são implementadas no cotidiano acadêmico? Haveria possibilidade de um levantamento de categorias que desse conta das implicações dessas ações de implementação,nas IES pesquisadas? O trabalho traz reflexões sobre: o Ensino Superior Brasileiro e sua expansão, competitividade e avaliação; Base Legal da Avaliação do Ensino Superior – SINAES - PDI, PPI, PPCPed; o Curso de Pedagogia – Formação Docente; a Metodologia de Pesquisa de “Estudos de Casos Múltiplos”; Textos de cada um dos Cenários de Ambientação; Análise Comparativa entre os três casos estudados e Conclusões. University Education in Brazil, according to statistical data from INEO – The Anísio Teixeira National Institute of Studies and Educational Research – between 1995 and 2005 – presents {{a significant increase}} in the number of private institutions of higher learning (IES) and, as a consequence, of enrollments. This growth connects the realities of these institutions directly to the national need for parameters, which might inform the Ministry of Education on certain aspects of these realities. Our study PDI – Institutional Development Plan, PPI – Institutional Pedagogical Project and PPC – Course Pedagogical Project, between what has been said and what has been done, an analysis of implementation in three private Institutions/RS/Brazil brings a contribution on this field, as it makes a reflexive and critical analysis on the articulations among PDI, PPI and PPC/Pedagogic in three IES/RS/Brazil, with the purpose of characterizing interactive, effective, relevant and significant elements to the organizational trajectory and implementation of these documents in their academic and pedagogic reality, in their Environmental Scenery defined as “A”, “B” and “C” and, with these data to be able to organize thematic categories. The Multiple Cases Studies, as a research methodology, sought to qualify aspects related to changes and conceptual and paradigmatic challenges to the interactive processes and to their social dimensions. Having the legal orientations of MEC/INEP/SINAES/DCNs as a reference – which regulate the IES – the textures of these legal documents characterize how strongly these three documents demanded by present law, keep significant relationships between what is said and what is done. The characterizations and implementations presented demand a specificity which expresses the personality of the IES, the problematizations bring forth the practices which identify and delineate these limits and possibilities, understanding that to each new element of discovery, the research text may restructure itself looking for a construction “in course”. Some questionings have oriented our research: do the researched IES have the three documents demanded by the Ministry of Education as their legal mandatory references? How have these documents been constructed and by whom? How is the implementation of these documents done? What do they represent in the daily practice of students and masters? Do the legal demands of the Ministry of Education support the development of the IES or do they become a mere <b>structural</b> <b>instrument</b> to be presented officially on solemn occasions? Are the new demands of University Education in the documents implemented in everyday academic activities? Would it be possible to evaluate categorical evidence on the implications of these implemented actions in the IES that have been researched? The study brings reflections on: Brazilian University Education and its expansion, competitivity and evaluation; Legal Fundaments of Evaluation in University Education – SINAES – PDI, PPI, PPCPed; the Pedagogy Course – Professor’s Formation; Research Methodology in “Studies of Multiple Cases”; texts from each one of the Environmental Scenery, Comparative Analysis among the three cases studied and Conclusions. Consolidating the matters that have oriented the three study cases performed, the paper presents partial synoptic tables and another of final comparative analysis. As far as the three formalized divisions are concerned, Fundaments/ODI, Development/PPI and PPL, Sustainability/ PPCPed, besides the characterization of each scenery and analysis: both present the results achieved. The IES bring from their region of activity their strong institutional cultures. They exert their educational actions with Christian and regional references challenging, with their personalities, a multiple-offer market; they believe in a new meaning for Legal Documents, maintaining the orientation. However, they create alternate economical viabilities; invest in a pedagogical and administrative management bringing them to their curricular matrixes, within their own personalities, mixing ethics, faith, Christianity, national challenges, credibility and globalization. In the concluding pages of this paper, we have placed the core idea to which this thesis is the answer, abstracted from the path of data collecting in the study cases, articulating its formal and interpretative possibilities and management forms of Community and Contextualized Cultures of Universities, through dimensions such as, knowledge, Concepts, Attitudes and behavior and the possibilities of their being linked anew: Individual and Team Competence, Personal Dominion, Work, Team Teaching and Learning, Shared Visions, Mental Models, Inter and Transdisciplinarity...|$|E

The consequences of such a situation are apparently contradictory. On one hand, the crisis lowers the European integration process in view of achieving the performance imposed by the Single Market, the economic and administrative convergence etc. On the other hand, the possibility of accessing the European structural funds becomes a welcome financial resource for diminishing or stopping the effects of the crisis. The second alternative establishes new balances or imbalances at the local community level, with effect on the employment policies. The European <b>structural</b> <b>instruments</b> – <b>Structural</b> Funds, Cohesion Fund, EC initiatives – are associated with the effects induced in view to achieve the EU objectives such as: economic, social and territorial cohesion, economic growth, competitiveness, employment, sustainable development etc. The current paper aims to emphasise in a theoretic and empiric manner, the influences of these <b>structural</b> <b>instruments</b> on the employment policies at local level.
