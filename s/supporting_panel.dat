The gallery aims to portray the human body in all its aspects: anatomical, physiological, biochemical, structural, {{functional}} and systemic. The concept for the gallery arose out of the feedback that the Centre had been receiving from its visitors, to set up more exhibits on the Human Body, its structure and functioning. The Human Body is something, which we all possess and are familiar with, {{but at the same}} time, is an eternal source of mystery. From this gallery visitor comes down to an exciting gallery on prehistoric life, featuring several life sized and scaled animated robotic models of dinosaurs and other long extinct creatures in their natural ambience. The <b>supporting</b> <b>panel</b> exhibition provides ample information about origin of Earth, geological changes that occurred on earth through ages, evolution of atmosphere, origin of life in water, spread of life on land, early life forms, early mass extinctions and so on.

40|$|The {{performance}} of a solar photovoltaic silicon panel is inversely proportional to its operating temperature. Therefore the overheating risk must be avoided {{in order to improve}} the cells electric efficiency. The temperature increase in a solar cell also gives rise to thermal stresses within the module.

Experimental investigations have been conducted on a two photovoltaic modules assembly composed by silicon panels. Numerical simulations have been performed employing a two-dimensional finite element numerical model, validated against experiments carried out by the authors.

40|$|A work of art, {{considered}} in its complexity {{and in its}} evolution over time, requires knowledge and thorough study in order to arrive at its correct interpretation, a prerequisite for any conservation and maintenance interventions. The evaluation of the preliminary information {{on the work of}} art and its analytical reading are closely interrelated to a careful and critical use of the technical and operational instruments defined in a comprehensive and focused methodological programme. Information technology and the integration of multidisciplinary knowledge lead to making even more powerful forms of support available for a phase of documentation, as a means of investigation and organisation of the information, followed by analysis and processing that implement the knowledge of the work of art. Instruments for the 3 D surveys of the panels and software for processing and post-processing allow us to obtain digital models of the surveyed surfaces, which are implemented in the GIS environment. We take advantage of the advanced analytical and management capacities, normally applied to the territory, with a simple change of scale, allowing us to carry out detailed investigations on the painting, on the paint film and on the <b>supporting</b> <b>panel.</b> Quantitative evaluations of the metric/statistical type on the spatial distribution of the elements are flanked both by colourimetric analysis, vectorising the RGB components and extrapolating the useful information, and by graphic analysis of the iconographic composition and on the conservation status. We then process the three-dimensional data relative to the morphology of the panel, allowing the identification of any critical aspects or elements of deterioration, until reaching a geometrical comparison among subsequent acquisitions that allows us to identify any displacement due to modifications of the support. The application of the method also allows us to define a comparison between diverse sensing systems to verify their accuracy and effectiveness, in a perspective of programmed management of interventions that will optimise costs and benefits and predispose the elevation profiles to study the morphological evolution along particular lines of interest. The GIS application in a field which is so different from the usual context of usage provides innovative scenarios and various potentials of data analysis and processing...|$|E
40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) A {{number of}} {{oncolytic}} picornaviruses are currently under evaluation as potential therapeutic agents {{for a range}} of human malignancies. In particular, a subset of naturally occurring human C-cluster enteroviruses; Coxsackievirus A 13 (CVA 13), Coxsackievirus A 15 (CVA 15), Coxsackievirus A 18 (CVA 18) and Coxsackievirus A 21 (CVA 21) and the human B-cluster enterovirus, Echovirus 1 (EV 1), display promising pre-clinical oncolytic activity against a wide variety of neoplastic cells. CVA 21 is currently under clinical evaluation for the control of melanoma, breast, prostate and head/neck cancer. The preferential targeting of cancer cells by this subset of viruses is based on extracellular capsid interactions with specific viral receptors (intercellular adhesion molecule- 1 [ICAM- 1], decay-accelerating factor [DAF] or integrin α 2 β 1), on the surface of malignant cells. In the present study, the therapeutic potential of this subset of enteroviruses was evaluated as a novel treatment strategy for the control of human malignancies of the gastrointestinal system. In Chapter 3, the capacity of the aforementioned enteroviruses for oncolytic activity was assessed in a panel of in vitro human gastric cancer cell cultures. Flow cytometric analysis revealed low-to-medium levels of ICAM- 1, in addition to abundant α 2 β 1 and DAF expression on the surface of gastric cancer cell lines. Cell monolayer lytic infectivity assays demonstrated that, of the viruses under evaluation, EV 1 displayed the most potent and widespread in vitro lytic activity against the gastric cancer cell lines. Monoclonal antibody blockade confirmed the specific integrin α 2 β 1 -mediated route of EV 1 cell infection in the gastric cancer MKN- 45 cell line. Subsequently, an in vivo dose ranging study assessing the efficacy of oncolytic EV 1 was undertaken in an immune-compromised MKN- 45 -Luc mouse model of human gastric cancer peritoneal carcinomatosis (PC). In this model, an intra-peritoneal dose of as little as 1 x 103 TCID 50 EV 1 resulted in a significant reduction in peritoneal tumour burden. In Chapter 4, the oncolytic capacity of this enterovirus subset was further evaluated, as a potential therapeutic option for the control of colorectal cancer (CRC). Flow cytometric analysis of a panel of CRC cell lines demonstrated abundant levels of DAF and integrin α 2 β 1, and low-to-moderate levels of ICAM- 1 expression on the surface of CRC cells. Of the subset of viruses examined, a DAF-using variant of CVA 21 (CVA 21 -DAFv) displayed the most potent and widespread oncolytic activity against in vitro CRC cell cultures. Consequently, the potential in vivo oncolytic capacity of CVA 21 -DAFv and the wild-type CVA 21 was evaluated in three individual immune-compromised mouse sub-cutaneous xenograft models of human CRC. However, despite the immunohistochemical detection of ICAM- 1 /DAF on cells of the CRC xenografts, and the detection of infectious virus in the blood of treated tumour-bearing mice, a detectable reduction in tumour burden was not observed. On account of the varying degrees of oncolytic efficacy observed in colorectal and gastric cancers, global gene expression profiling was employed in Chapters 5 and 6, to further elucidate the molecular mechanisms of enterovirus-mediated tumour cell tropism and cell death. As the most extensively characterised virus in pre-clinical studies, and the only virus of this subset under current clinical evaluation, CVA 21 was selected as the challenge virus for analysis of the transcriptional response to enterovirus infection. Malignant cells that displayed reproducible susceptibility to in vitro and in vivo lytic CVA 21 challenge were necessary for extensive characterisation, therefore, melanoma SK-Mel- 28 and breast cancer MDA-MB- 231 -Luc cell lines, rather than CRC cell lines, were utilised. In Chapter 5, the response of SK-Mel- 28 and MDA-MB- 231 -Luc cell monolayers, and a <b>supporting</b> <b>panel</b> of malignant and normal cell lines, to in vitro CVA 21 challenge was assessed. In Chapter 6, the transcriptional response of immune-compromised mouse SK-Mel- 28 and MDA-MB- 231 -Luc xenograft cells to systemic CVA 21 administration was characterised. The transcriptional response of cells propagated as in vitro monolayers differed markedly when compared to that of in vivo xenografts generated from the same cell lines. In Chapter 5, a delayed rate of CVA 21 replication and cell lysis was observed in normal cell cultures, as compared to malignant cell lines. Gene expression profiling suggested that the normal human lung fibroblast cell line, MRC- 5, mounted an interferon (IFN) -mediated innate immune response against CVA 21 challenge, a phenomenon not observed following challenge of the malignant cell line panel. Such findings suggest a potential role for the functional status of the IFN-mediated innate immune system in the tumour cell tropism of oncolytic CVA 21. Somewhat surprisingly, in Chapter 6, an IFN-mediated transcriptional response was observed in the SK-Mel- 28 /MDA-MB- 231 -Luc xenograft cells, potentially attributed to the ‘priming’ effects of in vivo endogenous murine IFN activity. Furthermore, in Chapters 5 and 6, the potential contributions of transcriptionally regulated genes, in respect to their biological roles in cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, oxidative stress, stimulation of anti-tumoural immunity, and inhibition of angiogenesis in CVA 21 -mediated oncolysis were considered. Moreover, in Chapter 6, a distinct genetic signature of infection was identified, comprising a total of 9 individual genes, significantly upregulated in response to infection in each xenograft model at 24 and 72 h following the systemic administration of CVA 21. The identified genes involved in this core transcriptional response to infection may serve as effective molecular biomarkers for the evaluation of oncolytic CVA 21 efficacy...|$|E

The two cases of inside and outside stiffeners were considered. The complete cylinder buckling load was reached only for panels under classical simply supported boundary conditions. The prevention of circumferential displacement is found {{to be the most important}} in-plane boundary condition from the point of view of increasing the buckling load. Clamping is found more effective in increasing the buckling loads of panels with free circumferential edge displacement than of panels with zero edge displacement. When panel width is equal to or greater than 180 deg, the panel buckling loads are within 10 % of the complete cylinder load for all cases except one simply <b>supported</b> <b>panel</b> with outside stringers. Buckling loads were higher for outside stringers, except for very narrow panels that are restrained against circumferential edge displacement.
