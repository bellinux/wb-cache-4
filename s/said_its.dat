5|$|Palahniuk's {{novel was}} optioned by 20th Century Fox {{producer}} Laura Ziskin, who hired Jim Uhls {{to write the}} film adaptation. Fincher {{was one of four}} directors the producers considered, and was selected because of his enthusiasm for the film. Fincher developed the script with Uhls and sought screenwriting advice from the cast and others in the film industry. The director and the cast compared the film to Rebel Without a Cause (1955) and The Graduate (1967). They <b>said</b> <b>its</b> theme was the conflict between a generation of young people and the value system of advertising. The director copied the homoerotic overtones from Palahniuk's novel to make audiences uncomfortable and keep them from anticipating the twist ending.|$|E

The Daily Mirror Jane Simon praised Miller's portrayal of Hedren. Although she endorsed the film, Hedren <b>said</b> <b>its</b> length kept it from showing some of {{the positive aspects of}} her relationship with Hitchcock.
