The central line is often missing. This type is {{generally}} smaller than the prototype or square shoulder spades. Their inscriptions are clearer, and usually consist of two characters. They {{are associated with the}} Kingdom of Zhou and the Henan area. Their smaller size indicates that they are later in date than the square shoulder spades.|$|E
500|$|Standards for {{the breed}} are stipulated by the New Forest Pony Breeding and Cattle Society. The maximum height allowed is [...] Although {{there is no}} minimum height standard, in {{practice}} New Forest ponies are seldom less than [...] In shows, they normally are classed in two sections: competition height A, [...] and under; and competition height B, over [...] New Forest ponies should be of riding type, workmanlike, and strong in conformation, with a <b>sloping</b> <b>shoulder</b> and powerful hindquarters; the body should be deep, and the legs straight with strong, flat bone, and hard, rounded hooves. Larger ponies, although narrow enough in the barrel for small children to ride comfortably, are also capable of carrying adults. Smaller ponies may not be suitable for heavier riders, but they often have more show quality. The New Forest pony has free, even gaits, active and straight, but not exaggerated, and is noted for sure-footedness, agility, and speed.|$|E
500|$|The {{riding horse}} section Finnhorse is a capable and {{reliable}} mount. It lacks some traits required for competing {{at the highest}} levels of international riding sports, but its combination of size and good temperament makes it suitable for both adults and children. To qualify for the riding section, a horse must carry itself well, and have a long neck, small head, <b>sloping</b> <b>shoulder</b> and well-defined withers. The body must not be too long. The universal FInnhorse breeding goals have made the breed of a lighter build, with longer neck, better gaits and fewer faults in conformation, allowing modern riding-type Finnhorses to work more easily on the bit. Even the temperament of the riding section animals appears to have become more lively. To pass the studbook evaluation, a riding type horse must either have placed in a Grade IV dressage or combined driving competition, or pass a dressage test; must [...] pass a jumping evaluation and a ridability test, and possess clean gaits. Mares may be qualified solely on grounds of a ridability test and a movement evaluation.|$|E

40|$|A {{sporadic}} {{patient with}} OFC syndrome is described. Distinguishing features were a long face with narrow nose, high arched palate, prominent and dysmorphic ears, long neck, <b>sloping</b> <b>shoulders</b> and clavicles, winged, low, and laterally set scapulae, tetralogy of Fallot, and deafness secondary to cochlear malformation. Some features {{present in the}} original family, including lateral cervical fistulae, have suggested that OFC syndrome could be a variant of BOR syndrome. The absence of preauricular tags, lacrimal duct stenosis, and renal malformations, {{and the presence of}} distinct facial and radiographic findings and markedly downward <b>sloping</b> <b>shoulders</b> in the present patient support OFC syndrome being a unique, clinically recognisable entity...|$|R
60|$|Three or {{four minutes}} later {{they left the}} cothouse and struck across the heath. There was no track, but Andrew headed for a knoll on the mountain's <b>sloping</b> <b>shoulder.</b> After they left the level, the heather grew tall and strong, {{brushing}} about their knees and entangling their feet. Then there were awkward rabbit-holes and granite boulders scattered about, and they bruised their shins as they laboriously plodded upward. The light had almost gone, {{and there was nothing}} visible but the stretch of shadowy hillside in front.|$|E
60|$|There was a {{touch of}} frost in the still air and the light was fading. A yellow glow lingered in the {{southwest}} beyond Criffell's <b>sloping</b> <b>shoulder,</b> which ran up against it, tinged a deep violet.

60|$|The {{stranger}} assented, {{and they}} went down into the fen, and looked over the precious mare, whose feats were afterwards sung by many an English fireside, or in the forest, beneath the hollins green, by such as Robin Hood and his merry men. The ugliest, {{as well as the}} swiftest, of mares, she was, say the old chroniclers; and it was not till the stranger had looked twice at her, that he forgot her great chuckle head, greyhound-flanks, and drooping hind-quarters, and began to see the great length of those same quarters,--the thighs let down into the hocks, the arched loin, the extraordinary girth through the saddle, the <b>sloping</b> <b>shoulder,</b> the long arms, the flat knees, the large, well-set hoofs, and all the other points which showed her strength and speed, and justified her fame.|$|E

50|$|Shoulder pads are {{a type of}} fabric-covered padding used in men's and women's {{clothing}} to give the wearer the illusion of having broader and less <b>sloping</b> <b>shoulders.</b> In men's styles, shoulder pads are often used in suits, jackets and overcoats, usually sewn {{at the top of}} the shoulder and fastened between the lining and the outer fabric layer. In women's clothing, their inclusion depends by the fashion taste of the day. Although from a non-fashion point of view they are generally for people with narrow or <b>sloping</b> <b>shoulders,</b> there are also quite a few cases in which shoulder pads will be necessary for a suit or blazer in order to compensate for certain fabrics' natural properties, most notably suede blazers, due to the weight of the material. They were popular additions to clothing (particularly business clothing) during the 1940s, 1980s, and late 2000s/2010s.|$|R
