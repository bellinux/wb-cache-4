5|$|Alfred Baker {{lost much}} of his savings in the Panic of 1907 and could only afford to send {{one of his sons}} to college. Thornton agreed to let his talented younger brother {{continue}} his education, a sacrifice that Hobey Baker never forgot. Although an above-average student, Baker stayed an extra year at St. Paul's in 1909 to allow his father another year to <b>save</b> <b>money.</b> <b>By</b> the time Baker left St. Paul's, his sporting achievements had helped make him one of the school's most popular students.|$|E
5|$|Two high-powered {{parliamentary}} commissions in 1852 issued {{recommendations for}} Oxford and Cambridge. Archibald Campbell Tait, former headmaster of Rugby School, {{was a key}} member of the Oxford Commission; he wanted Oxford to follow the German and Scottish model in which the professorship was paramount. The Commission's report envisioned a centralised university run predominantly by professors and faculties, with a much stronger emphasis on research. The professional staff should be strengthened and better paid. For students, restrictions on entry should be dropped, and more opportunity given to poorer families. It called for an enlargement of the curriculum, with honours to be awarded in many new fields. Undergraduate scholarships should be open to all Britons. Graduate fellowships should be opened up to {{all members of the}} University. It recommended that Fellows be released from an obligation for ordination. Students were to be allowed to <b>save</b> <b>money</b> <b>by</b> boarding in the city, instead of in a college.|$|E
5|$|The Sinsen Line {{was among}} those {{proposed}} for closure in 2002 when the tram company attempted to <b>save</b> <b>money</b> <b>by</b> transferring the traffic to buses. A city grant of 25 million Norwegian krone (NOK) saved the line along with several others. The metro station was {{for many years in}} bad need of rehabilitation, with dim lighting at the platforms, grimy walls, and broken roof tiles leaving piping and wiring exposed. Architect Reiulf Ramstad, {{who was in charge of}} the renewal project, compared the station to the scenery of a horror movie. The 2006 renovation involved making the station brighter lit, and a new entrance was built which attempted to make the station more visible from outside. Upgrading of the station included letting parts of sculpture exhibitions by the Norwegian Sculpturer Society be placed inside the station area. From 20 August 2006, Carl Berners plass also started serving the Ring Line of the metro. The line branches off from the Grorud Line north of Carl Berners plass, and the station thereby became the transfer station between the Ring Line and the Grorud Line. From 2008, the square itself was rebuilt to become more pedestrian-friendly.|$|E
5000|$|In George Orwell's 1947 essay [...] "Such, Such Were the Joys," [...] {{recounting the}} miseries of his preparatory school education, St Cyprian's School <b>saves</b> <b>money</b> <b>by</b> serving distasteful {{unsweetened}} suet pudding {{as a first}} course to [...] "break the boys' appetites." ...|$|R
50|$|In late 2014 the King County Council (made up of {{the same}} members as the King County Ferry District) voted to assume {{governance}} of the King County Ferry District. The consolidation of the district into county government <b>saves</b> <b>money</b> <b>by</b> eliminating redundant functions.|$|R
50|$|The film, {{which was}} shot on 16mm film, {{originally}} cost only $28,000, essentially {{the cost of}} raw stock and processing. Burns <b>saved</b> <b>money</b> <b>by</b> placing an advertisement in Backstage magazine looking for Irish-American actors {{willing to work for}} free, though lunch would be provided.|$|R
5|$|Vampyr {{was filmed}} between 1930 and 1931. Everything being shot on location, as Dreyer {{believed}} {{it would be}} beneficial by lending the dream-like ghost world of the film as well as allowing them to <b>save</b> <b>money</b> <b>by</b> not having to rent studio space. Dreyer originally wanted Vampyr to be a silent film, as it uses many elements of the silent era such as title cards to explain the story. Dialogue in the film was kept to a minimum. For the scenes with dialogue, the actors mouthed their lines in French, German and English so their lip movements would correspond to the voices {{that were going to}} be recorded in post-production. There is no record of the English version being completed. The scenes in the chateau were shot in April and May 1930. The chateau also acted as housing for the cast and crew during the filming. Life in the chateau was unpleasant for them as it was cold and infested with rats. The church yard scenes were shot in August 1930. The church was not an actual church, but a barn with a number of tombstones placed around it. This set was designed by the art director Hermann Warm.|$|E
5|$|The programmers {{suggested}} using 3D Studio Max for art {{and level}} design, which would <b>save</b> <b>money</b> <b>by</b> allowing {{the company to}} license {{a single piece of}} software, but the lead artists successfully lobbied against this plan, believing that allowing the respective teams to choose the software would allow them to work most efficiently. Huebner said this saved the project more time than any other decision made during development. The level designers chose QERadiant to take advantage of their previous experience using the software while working on Id Software's Quake series. Id allowed Nihilistic to license QERadiant and modify it to create a customized tool for its 3D environments. Because QERadiant was a finished, functional tool, it allowed the level designers to begin developing levels from the project's start and then export them into the NOD engine, rather than waiting for up to six months for Nihilistic to develop a custom tool or learning a new 3D level editor. In twenty-four months, the three level designers built over 100 in-game environments for Redemption. They obtained blueprints and sketches of buildings from medieval Prague and Vienna to better represent that period and locations. The four-person art team led by Kraaijvanger used Alias Wavefront Maya to create 3D art. Nihilistic's management wanted Kraaijvanger to use a less expensive tool but relented when the cost was found to be lower than had been thought. Throughout the project, the art team built over 1,500 3D models.|$|E
25|$|After the {{collapse}} of property values, the district sought to <b>save</b> <b>money</b> <b>by</b> deferring maintenance. For example, instead of replacing each of its 409 buses every 12 years, it went to a 55-year replacement cycle.|$|E
25|$|Costco resumed selling Coca-Cola {{products}} on December 14, 2009. Costco also <b>saves</b> <b>money</b> <b>by</b> not stocking extra bags or packing materials; {{to carry out}} their goods, customers must use a shopping cart, bring their own bags or use empty merchandise shipping boxes from the company's vendors.|$|R
50|$|Our Lady Air is an Irish {{low cost}} airline, {{providing}} low cost routes across Europe. It <b>saves</b> <b>money</b> <b>by</b> flying to airports {{further away from}} the actual city centre, such as landing a flight to Barcelona in Ireland.

5000|$|Known {{for highly}} {{finished}} portraits in pencil, Taylor was from 1779 an intermittent exhibitor at the Royal Academy. Later in life he <b>saved</b> <b>money</b> <b>by</b> teaching in London, {{with the support}} of John Alexander Gresse and Paul Sandby. He invested in annuities to last him to the age of 100.|$|R
25|$|Breastfeeding {{represents}} an opportunity cost, {{as the mother}} must spend hours each day breastfeeding instead of other activities, such as paid work or home production (such as growing food). In general, the higher the mother's earning power, the less likely she is to <b>save</b> <b>money</b> <b>by</b> breastfeeding.|$|E
25|$|Even before {{dropping}} out of school, McCarty was taught to <b>save</b> <b>money</b> <b>by</b> her mother.

25|$|Although it {{does not}} fly to Canada, Allegiant advertises {{extensively}} there and flies from about a dozen small airports near the Canada–US border. Many of its customers at airports such as Bellingham, Washington (BLI), Niagara Falls, New York (IAG), Ogdensburg, New York (OGS), Grand Forks, North Dakota (GFK) and Plattsburgh, New York (PBG) are Canadians, who can <b>save</b> <b>money</b> <b>by</b> flying from U.S. airports.|$|E
25|$|Morris used a French loan in 1782 {{to set up}} {{the private}} Bank of North America to finance the war. Seeking greater efficiency, Morris reduced the civil list, <b>saved</b> <b>money</b> <b>by</b> using {{competitive}} bidding for contracts, tightened accounting procedures, and demanded the national government's full share of money and supplies from the confederated states.|$|R
50|$|RF-based {{meter reading}} usually {{eliminates}} the need for the meter reader to enter the property or home, or to locate and open an underground meter pit. The utility <b>saves</b> <b>money</b> <b>by</b> increased speed of reading, has less liability from entering private property, and has fewer missed readings from being unable to access the meter.|$|R
50|$|Cartel also <b>saved</b> <b>money</b> <b>by</b> {{doing his}} own {{dangerous}} stunts that included taking a shotgun blast {{to his chest}} while wearing a cheap bullet-resistant vest; crashing through a glass window door; having a ‘stunt’ bottle smashed across his face, then doing a barroom fight scene with a very large bar patron he met {{the morning of the}} improvised sequence.|$|R
25|$|The {{production}} {{expected to}} <b>save</b> <b>money</b> <b>by</b> reusing the Serenity ship interior set from the Firefly television series. However, the set {{had been built}} in pieces as episodes called for new rooms on the ship. Using DVD images of the television series as a guide, the set was rebuilt over fourteen weeks on Universal Studios' Stage 12 by twenty-three supervised crews working independently but in coordination with one another.|$|E
25|$|A {{quadruplex}} telegraph {{is a type}} {{of electrical}} telegraph which allows a total of four separate signals to be transmitted and received on a single wire at the same time. With two signals in each direction, quadruplex telegraphy thus implements a form of multiplexing. The quadruplex telegraph was invented by Thomas Alva Edison in 1874, which enabled Western Union to <b>save</b> <b>money</b> <b>by</b> greatly increasing the number of messages the company could send without building new lines. It also allowed the company to use its existing lines more efficiently to meet seasonal increases in message traffic and to lease excess capacity for private lines.|$|E
25|$|Australian {{authorities}} {{alleged that}} as Haneef left Britain he recklessly provided assistance to a terrorist organisation by leaving his relative, Sabeel Ahmed, a SIM card {{and the balance}} of a two-year mobile phone contract to use and pay off when he left Britain in July 2006. Relatives have said that he left the SIM card behind to <b>save</b> <b>money</b> <b>by</b> not surrendering the remaining value of the contract to the telephone company. The prosecutor claimed the SIM card was found inside the vehicle used in the Glasgow Airport attack. This allegation, central to the case, {{has proved to be}} false and investigating British police officers have concluded that the case is being driven by politics rather than policing.|$|E

Most were delivered in 1983 with a supplementary set of essentially identical cars being purchased in 1986 for the line expansion. The cars, marketed by Budd as the Universal Transit Vehicle, are {{identical to those}} used on the Miami Metrorail because the two agencies built their systems {{at the same time}} and <b>saved</b> <b>money</b> <b>by</b> sharing a single order.|$|R
25|$|Corbyn claims renationalisation would <b>save</b> <b>money</b> <b>by</b> both joining up a {{fragmented}} market, thereby reducing duplication in the privatised rail market (estimated by Ian Taylor as costing up to £1.2 billion in a 2012 report written for trade unions, but the Rail Delivery Group notes this amount includes {{the cost of}} leasing trains {{as well as the}} cost of Network Rail using private contractors, something which British Rail did as well, thus would be an inaccurate estimate of savings) and keeping what is currently profit for the energy and train operating companies. Both the energy and the train operating companies claim that they make a low return on their money (3.9% for the energy companies and 3.4% for the train companies).|$|E
25|$|The Van Halen {{brothers}} formed {{their very}} first band called The Broken Combs {{in the early}} 1970s. As they progressed and gained popularity, they started to play many backyard parties and changed {{the name of their}} band to The Trojan Rubber Co. In 1972, the Van Halen brothers formed a band called Genesis featuring Eddie as lead vocalist/guitarist, Alex on drums, and Mark Stone on bass. They initially rented a sound system from David Lee Roth but decided to <b>save</b> <b>money</b> <b>by</b> letting him join as lead vocalist even though his previous audition(s) had been unsuccessful. By 1974, the band decided to replace Stone, so Michael Anthony, bassist and lead vocalist from local band Snake was auditioned. Following an all-night jam session, he was hired for bass and backing vocals.|$|E
25|$|To reach a final {{conclusion}} on {{the choice}} for ruler Winston Churchill, then British colonial secretary, summoned {{a small group}} of Orientalists to Egypt for the famous Cairo Conference of March 1921. The British Empire’s best minds on the Middle East would determine the fate of Mesopotamia, Transjordan and Palestine. Churchill’s objectives were to <b>save</b> <b>money</b> <b>by</b> reducing Britain's overseas military presence; Find a way to maintain political control over Britain's mandate areas as identified in the Sykes-Picot Agreement; Protect what was then suspected to be substantial oil reserves in Iraq; and lastly preserve an open trade route to India, the Crown Jewel of the empire. Representing the Iraqis, two members of the Council were picked to join the delegation: Sassoon Eskell and Jafar Pasha al-Askari; with the disliked Sayid Talib left behind. It was at this conference, with Sassoon’s and Jafar Pasha’s approval that Emir Faisal was chosen for the throne of Iraq.|$|E
25|$|Often {{painters}} or clients <b>saved</b> <b>money</b> <b>by</b> using {{less expensive}} blues, such as azurite smalt, or pigments made with indigo, but this sometimes caused problems. Pigments made from azurite were less expensive, but tended to turn dark and green with time. An {{example is the}} robe of the Virgin Mary in The Madonna Enthroned with Saints by Raphael in the Metropolitan Museum in New York. The Virgin Mary's azurite blue robe has degraded into a greenish-black.|$|R
5000|$|Family {{planning}} {{is among the}} most cost-effective of all health interventions. [...] Costs of contraceptives include method costs (including supplies, office visits, training), cost of method failure (ectopic pregnancy, spontaneous abortion, induced abortion, birth, child care expenses) and cost of side effects. [...] Contraception <b>saves</b> <b>money</b> <b>by</b> reducing unintended pregnancies and reducing transmission of sexually transmitted infections. By comparison, in the US, method related costs vary from nothing to about $1,000 {{for a year or more}} of reversible contraception.|$|R

25|$|In most cases, Auxiliary Police {{vehicles}} are retired vehicles {{that were once}} used by regular officers. Once the vehicle attains {{a certain amount of}} mileage, it is taken out of service and is either redecaled and given to a command for the Auxiliary Police, or is sold. Auxiliary Highway Patrol RMPs are retired RMPs previously used by regular Highway Patrol officers. Most commands only have one Auxiliary vehicle, but some have 2 or more. The number of Auxiliary vehicles per command is based on how many Auxiliary officers are working there and how many extra vehicles the NYPD has available. It {{should also be noted that}} older Auxiliary {{vehicles are}} painted either dark blue or black with white decals in contrast to the vehicles used by regular officers, which are white with light blue decals. In 2008, the NYPD changed the paint and decal color of Auxiliary vehicles to white with light blue decals in order to look like vehicles used by regular officers and as an economy measure to <b>save</b> <b>money</b> <b>by</b> not having to repaint the vehicles.|$|E
25|$|Henry Baker Brown {{bought the}} American College of Medicine and Surgery from Northwestern University; he later {{changed the name}} to Chicago College of Medicine and Surgery. Students could <b>save</b> <b>money</b> <b>by</b> {{spending}} their first two medical college years in Valparaiso. In 1905 the university formed an affiliation with Chicago College of Dental Surgery to provide dental education for its students. For the next two decades, Valpo gained a national reputation as an economical institution of higher learning, earning its positive nickname The Poor Man’s Harvard. At the height of enrollment in 1907, it was the second-largest school in the nation, behind only Harvard University. In 1914, monthly literary magazine The Torch was founded; it became the university's weekly student newspaper in 1915. The university began intercollegiate athletic competition in 1916. Valpo's first game was a basketball game against the Chicago YMCA Training School, in which VU fielded players from intramural teams. In 1917, World War I {{and the death of}} President Brown took its toll, and the school was forced into bankruptcy. Valparaiso University sold the Chicago College of Medicine and Surgery to Loyola University Chicago. In 1923, a fire destroyed the original 1860 Old College Building, and VU could not afford to clean the site.|$|E
