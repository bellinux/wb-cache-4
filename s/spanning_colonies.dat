Asexual {{reproduction}} of H. petrosum, by stolonisation, occurred {{throughout the year}} except for July and August. Asexual {{reproduction of}} H. pusillum, by planktonic propagules, occurred throughout the year. Sexual reproduction {{was limited to the}} autumn in H. petrosum and spring in H. pusillum. The growth rates of colonies of both species were rapid but declined with increased size.

Mortality was estimated to be high for both species, especially in summer. The maximum life <b>span</b> of <b>colonies</b> (ramets) of both species was estimated to be only eight weeks. Consequently most colonies do not reproduce sexually. The absence of reproduction of H. petrosum in summer, when the turnover of algal thalli was greatest, probably contributed to the summer decline in its abundance.

Our setup consisted of fourteen sub-colonies, ten of which {{were randomly assigned to}} different levels of experimental dehydration with silica gel, whereas the remaining four were controls. The ten experimental sub-colonies were split into two groups, so that five of them had access to water. Diverse ant morphs searched for water in dehydrated colonies, but mainly a caste of small ants collected water after sources had been discovered. Size specialization for water collection was replicable in shorter experiments with three additional colonies.

40|$|Humboldt {{penguins}} (Spheniscus humboldti) are top predators {{endemic to}} the area influenced by the cold, nutrient-rich Humboldt current {{on the west coast}} of South America. Their breeding <b>colonies</b> <b>span</b> the range between 5 and 42 °S (Williams, 1995). Because of low population numbers (recent estimates indicate a world population of only approximately 13 000 birds), the species is considered to be vulnerable to endangered (Ellis et al., 1998; Bonn Convention on Migratory Species). One of the factors that severely affects the Humboldt penguin population is the recurring El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Breeding populations are reduced by 65 – 72 % during ENSO years (Hays, 1986), when upwelling of nutrient-rich, cold bottom water in the south-eastern Pacific Ocean is depressed.

They vary from monodomy, a colony occupies a single nest, via polydomy, a colony occupies multiple adjacent nests, to supercoloniality, a <b>colony</b> <b>spans</b> over large territories comprising dozen to thousands nests without having any boundaries. The population structure of the desert ant Cataglyphis niger, previously considered to form supercolonies, was studied using genetic, chemical and behavioral tools in plots of 50 x 50 meters at two distinct populations. At the Palmahim site, the plot comprised 15 nests that according to the genetic analysis constituted three colonies. Likewise at the Rishon Leziyyon site 14 nests constituted 5 genetic colonies. In both sites, both chemical analysis and the behavioral (aggression) tests confirmed the colony genetic architecture. The behavioral tests also revealed that aggression between colonies within a population was higher than that exhibited between colonies of different populations, suggesting the occurrence of the nasty neighbor phenomenon. In contrast to supercolony structure previously reported in another population of this species, the presently studied populations were composed of polydomous colonies. However, both the genetic and chemical data revealed that the inter-colonial differences between sites were larger than those within site, suggesting some within-site population viscosity. Thus, C. niger exhibits flexible nesting characteristics, from polydomy to supercoloniality, and can be considered at the brink of supercoloniality.

The potential mechanisms with which termites suppress Pseudoxylaria have remained unknown. Here we explore if Actinobacteria potentially play a role as defensive symbionts against Pseudoxylaria in fungus-growing termites. We sampled for Actinobacteria from 30 fungus-growing termite <b>colonies,</b> <b>spanning</b> the three main termite genera and two geographically distant sites. Our isolations yielded 360 Actinobacteria, from which we selected subsets for morphological (288 isolates, grouped in 44 morphotypes) and for 16 S rRNA (35 isolates, spanning the majority of morphotypes) characterisation. Actinobacteria were found throughout all sampled nests and colony parts and, phylogenetically, they are interspersed with Actinobacteria from origins other than fungus-growing termites, indicating lack of specificity. Antibiotic-activity screening of 288 isolates against the fungal cultivar and competitor revealed {{that most of the}} Actinobacteria-produced molecules with antifungal activity. A more detailed bioassay on 53 isolates, to test the specificity of antibiotics, showed that many Actinobacteria inhibit both Pseudoxylaria and Termitomyces, and that the cultivar fungus generally is more susceptible to inhibition than the competitor. This suggests that either defensive symbionts are not present in the system or that they, if present, represent a subset of the community isolated. If so, the antibiotics must be used in a targeted fashion, being applied to specific areas by the termites. We describe the first discovery of an assembly of antibiotic-producing Actinobacteria occurring in fungus-growing termite nests. However, due to the diversity found, and the lack of both phylogenetic and bioactivity specificity, further work is necessary for {{a better understanding of the}} putative role of antibiotic-producing bacteria in the fungus-growing termite mutualistic system...|$|R

Using geolocators, we identified winter habitat use patterns of 115 adult murres Uria spp. from 7 <b>colonies,</b> <b>spanning</b> the eastern Canadian coast from the high Arctic to Newfoundland, during 2007 to 2010. Thick-billed murres U. lomvia dispersed throughout the region (Davis Strait, Labrador Sea, Orphan Basin, Grand Bank) with 0 to 45 % overlap of core wintering areas (50 % kernel home range) among breeding populations. Common murres U. aalge concentrated on the Grand Bank and Orphan Basin, with 50 to 67 % overlap among breeding populations. For both species, most individuals (up to 70 %) wintered offshore, in shelf (≤ 500 m deep) and oceanic zones (> 500 m); fewer than one-third (30 %) of individuals used nearshore zones (≤ 50 km to shore). Tracked common murres representing > 80 % of the eastern Canadian breeding population converged in winter in areas of high risk from hydrocarbon exploration and extraction activity. In contrast, tracked thick-billed murres, representing ~ 34 % of the eastern Canadian population, dispersed over a larger area and displayed more variable wintering strategies. Thus population vulnerability to spatially constrained risks may be greater for common than thick-billed murres. Populations from several colonies of both species converged on the Grand Bank and Orphan Basin, with the implications for each breeding population depending on its particular dispersal pattern.

40|$|Two main {{hypotheses}} {{have been}} debated about the biogeography of the Southern Ocean: (1) the Antarctic Polar Front (APF), {{acting as a}} barrier between Antarctic and sub-Antarctic provinces, and (2) the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC), promoting gene flow among sub-Antarctic areas. The Gentoo penguin is distributed throughout these two provinces, separated by the APF. We analyzed mtDNA (HVR 1) and 12 microsatellite loci of 264 Gentoo penguins, Pygoscelis papua, from 12 <b>colonies</b> <b>spanning</b> from the Western Antarctic Peninsula and the South Shetland Islands (WAP) to the sub-Antarctic Islands (SAI). While low genetic structure was detected among WAP colonies (mtDNA Ф = 0. 037 – 0. 133; microsatellite F = 0. 009 – 0. 063), high differentiation was found between all SAI and WAP populations (mtDNA Ф = 0. 678 – 0. 930; microsatellite F = 0. 110 – 0. 290). These results suggest that contemporary dispersal around the Southern Ocean is very limited or absent. As predicted, the APF {{appears to be a}} significant biogeographical boundary for Gentoo penguin populations; however, the ACC does not promote connectivity in this species. Our data suggest demographic expansion in the WAP during the last glacial maximum (LGM, about 20 kya), but stability in SAI. Phylogenetic analyses showed a deep divergence between populations from the WAP and those from the SAI. Therefore, taxonomy should be further revised. The Crozet Islands resulted as a basal clade (3. 57 Mya), followed by the Kerguelen Islands (2. 32 Mya) as well as a more recent divergence between the Falkland/Malvinas Islands and the WAP (1. 27 Mya).

40|$|The Southern Ocean is {{undergoing}} rapid physical and biological {{changes that are}} likely to have profound implications for Antarctic fauna. One such change is a projected decline in the extent of the Antarctic sea ice field {{by the end of the}} century, and an associated shortening of the sea ice season. Fauna that are dependent on Antarctic sea ice for breeding or foraging habitat are likely to be vulnerable to climate change. The Weddell seal (Leptonychotes weddellii) and emperor penguin (Aptenodytes forsteri) both use Antarctic sea ice as a breeding platform, while the Adélie penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae) breeds on ice-free ground, but forages largely within the sea ice zone. In order to develop successful conservation plans for such at-risk taxa, an understanding of the likely impacts of climate change is essential. As the changes currently underway in the Southern Ocean represent a long-term, environmental regime shift (as opposed to a short-term fluctuation), it is prudent to consider the responses of species to similar climate regime shifts in the past. By examining changes in the abundance and distribution of taxa over tens of thousands of years and placing these changes into context with palaeoclimate records, valuable insights into species’ long-term responses to environmental change can be gained. When considered in combination with contemporary ecology, information on historical trends can give a more complete picture of species’ li ely responses to climate change in the future. For this thesis, changes in the abundance and distribution of Weddell seals, emperor penguins and Adélie penguins over millennia were examined using mitochondrial DNA and genome-wide SNPs. Genetic diversity and contemporary population structure were also assessed, in order to provide context for the historical findings and to better understand the resilience of these predators to environmental change. Two mitochondrial markers (the control region and cytochome b) were sequenced for extant colonies and radiocarbon dated sub-fossil remains of the three species. In total, 250 emperor penguins from nine <b>colonies</b> <b>spanning</b> the Ross Sea, Weddell Sea and East Antarctica, 96 Weddell seals from seven sites in East Antarctica, and 56 Adélie penguins from six colonies in East Antarctica, were sequenced. The East Antarctic Adélie penguin sequences were supplemented with existing datasets of 36 penguins from the Scotia Arc and 49 penguins from the Ross Sea, to allow for circum-Antarctic comparisons. Using mitochondrial DNA sequences, the population trends of all three species in East Antarctica during and since the last glacial maximum (LGM, 26 – 19. 5 kya) were reconstructed using coalescent Bayesian skyline methods. Phylogenies were also constructed for emperor and Adélie penguins from around the continent in order to identify genetic lineages associated with past refugia. It was hypothesised that the sea ice-breeding Weddell seal and emperor penguin may have prospered during the glacial period, due to an increase in breeding habitat and reduced competition from other, less cold-tolerant predators, whereas Adélie penguins were likely to have been reduced in number. However, findings indicated that both Adélie and emperor penguin populations were smaller during the last glacial period than they are today, and populations expanded in East Antarctica (135 -fold and 5. 7 -fold, respectively) during the glacial-interglacial transition and the Holocene. The timing and magnitude of the population expansions were different for the two penguin species, and appear to have had different environmental drivers. In the case of the Adélie penguin, expansion began ca. 14 kya, suggesting that deglaciation, and the associated increase in ice-free ground suitable for nesting, was the likely driver. Meanwhile, the emperor penguin expansion in East Antarctica occurred 4, 000 years later, coincident with reductions in sea ice that may have led to more favourable foraging conditions. The phylogenetic analyses indicated that both penguin species were restricted to refugia during the LGM. In the case of the Adélie penguin, there was evidence for two refugia, while for emperor penguins there were probably three refugia. Results strongly suggested that both species had a refuge in the Ross Sea, possibly associated with a polynya in the region which may have provided an oasis within the sea ice field. The location of other refugia were unable to be identified based on mitochondrial data analysis. Despite the similar ecological niches and overlapping distributions of emperor penguins and Weddell seals, findings indicated the two meso-predators responded very differently to historical climate change. While emperor penguin numbers increased rapidly in the Holocene, the size of Weddell seal populations was unchanged. Emperor penguins appear to possess a greater capacity to adapt to environmental change than Weddell seals. Emperor penguins prospered during the Holocene warming while Weddell seals did not, most likely due to a higher dispersal ability (and hence gene flow among colonies), higher evolutionary rate and fine-scale differences in their preferred foraging locations. The vastly different climate change responses of two ecologically equivalent predators suggests that differing adaptive capacities and/or fine-scale niche differences play a major role in species’ climate change responses. Meanwhile, the similarity in the responses of the ice-breeding emperor penguin and rock-breeding Adélie penguin to climate change was also surprising. Overall, the climate change responses of species are complex and may prove difficult to predict. The degree of dispersal among breeding colonies is an important component of understanding a species’ likely climate change response. This is because dispersal facilitates range shifts, and increases adaptive capacity by facilitating gene flow among breeding sites, thus replenishing the gene pool with new, potentially adaptive alleles. Delimiting breeding populations is also crucial for conservation planning, so that populations can be managed at an ecologically relevant spatial scale. A total of 114 individuals from eight emperor penguin colonies from the Ross Sea, Weddell Sea and East Antarctica were genotyped using 20, 005 genome-wide SNPs generated using restriction-site-associated DNA sequencing (RADSeq). Their genetic population structure was then assessed using STRUCTURE analysis, principal components analysis, and analyses of pairwise FST, revealing a total of six extant breeding populations among the eight emperor penguin colonies sampled. There was indications of ongoing gene flow between colonies located up to 550 km apart, providing evidence against strong philopatry in emperor penguins. This finding has important implications for forecasting studies for the species, which have previously considered each colony as an isolated unit. The demographic histories of emperor penguin breeding populations were assessed over the past 50, 000 years using RAD-Seq loci in combination with mitochondrial DNA sequences, via the coalescent Bayesian skyline method. This approach allowed for comparisons of the timing and magnitude of population expansions in different locations. The genetic evidence strongly indicated that there was an emperor penguin refuge at Cape Roget in the Ross Sea. This colony, unlike all other emperor penguin populations in this study, did not experience a population bottleneck during the LGM, and also had significantly high genetic diversity consistent with an older, ancestral population. The Cape Roget colony is proximate to the proposed location of an LGM polynya offshore from the Adare Peninsula that could have supported a refuge population of emperor penguins, by providing foraging access amidst the extensive sea ice field. This region in the north-western Ross Sea may have been an important penguin breeding habitat for at least 50, 000 years and should therefore be considered in any future management for conservation. While decadal monitoring studies provide invaluable data on the short-term environmental sensitivities of predator populations, given the long-term nature of projected climate change it is also prudent to consider the climate-driven responses of populations over longer time scales. This study suggests that interspecific differences, even for sympatric species with similar ecological niches, are likely to affect the future climate change responses of Southern Ocean marine predators and should be considered in future conservation plans. The findings also highlight the importance of protecting productive foraging grounds proximate to breeding locations, as well as the potential role of polynyas as future Southern Ocean refugia...|$|R
