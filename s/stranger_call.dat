30|$|Over {{the course}} of the experiments, each {{participant}} was presented with three sets of questions multiple times each week. The first set of question was generated based on participant’s own data. For example, a participant would receive a phone call question in the following format: “who did you call at 11 : 25 am on Wednesday?”. The second set of question was generated based on participant’s pair’s (e.g., close friend) data. In this case, the role of a strong adversary is played by the pair of each participant. For example, the participant would receive a phone call question about his/her partner in the following format: “who did your partner call at 4 : 20 pm on Friday?”. The third set of question was generated based on a randomly selected participant’s data whose identity was not revealed to the participant who answered the questions. In this case, participants played the role of a naive adversary. For example, the participant would receive a phone call question about a stranger in the following format: “who did a <b>stranger</b> <b>call</b> at 2 : 51 pm on Monday?”. In all cases, participants were not given any feedback regarding his/her performance throughout the study to avoid biasing them. Moreover, while participants were attempting to answer the challenge questions generated based on their close friend’s data or a random user’s data (i.e., playing the role of an adversary), the exact same questions and the exact same possible answer options (if a question has multiple answer choices such as app question—Fig.  1 c) that were presented to the legitimate user are presented to the adversarial users. Each participant was compensated with a $ 25 Amazon gift card for two weeks of participation. The study was approved by the University’s Institutional Review Board (IRB).|$|E

5000|$|When a <b>Stranger</b> <b>Calls</b> is a 1979 American {{psychological}} horror film. It {{was directed}} by Fred Walton and stars Carol Kane and Charles Durning. The film derives its story from the classic folk legend of [...] "The Babysitter and the Man Upstairs" [...] and the 1974 horror classic Black Christmas. The film was commercially successful, grossing $21,411,158 at the box office, though it received a mixed critical reception. It {{was followed by the}} 1993 made-for-television sequel When a <b>Stranger</b> <b>Calls</b> Back and a remake in 2006.|$|R

50|$|One of {{the most}} financially {{successful}} remakes was When a <b>Stranger</b> <b>Calls</b> (2006). Expanding the original film's first twenty minutes into a 90-minute feature that relied solely on {{the tale of the}} babysitter and the man upstairs, the film was a hit with younger audiences who could see it due to its PG-13 rating, bringing in a total of nearly $50 million at the box office. This was not the first, or the last, slasher film that attempted to capitalize on the PG-13 rating to lure the younger audience. In 2005 two PG-13 slashers were released, although neither were particularly successful critically or commercially. Cry_Wolf (2005), starring Jon Bon Jovi and Lindy Booth, arguably did not have the studio-backed marketing push to become as big a hit as When a <b>Stranger</b> <b>Calls,</b> but The Fog, a remake of John Carpenter's 1980 film, hailed from Sony Pictures and used the popularity of its TV stars Tom Welling and Maggie Grace to promote it. Following the success of When a <b>Stranger</b> <b>Calls,</b> the PG-13 slasher remake craze continued with Prom Night (2008), which was similar to the 1980 original only in title alone. It boasted a higher body count and was a more straightforward slasher film than When a <b>Stranger</b> <b>Calls,</b> yet its PG-13 restrictions led to negative reception from fans who did not find it gruesome enough to be a slasher. Still, it was a hit, pulling in nearly $44 million at the box office.|$|R
