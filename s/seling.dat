Compared to her other roles, which are very dramatic (particularly that of Mara in Mara Clara), her character in the film is seen as mellow and reserved. Numerous comediannes are also cast in the film, such as Gina Pareño (as Intang), Eugene Domingo (as Juaning), Ces Quesada (as Nieves), and Tessie Tomas (as <b>Seling),</b> whose dramatic performances seem weird in contrast to Santos'. The role of Celeste {{is supposed to have}} been given to Iza Calzado but Mylene Dizon took the role instead when scheduling conflicts between the film and Joaquin Bordado were not resolved. Other cast members include newcomers Lukas Agustin (as Siloy), Ogoy Agustin (as Veiling), Cedric Amit (as Digo), and Bodjong Fernandez (as Mou Sei) as well as established actors Ketchup Eusebio (as Badocdoc), Ronnie Lazaro (as Old Veiling), Jojit Lorenzo (as Basit), Tony Mabesa (as Susing), Spanky Manikan (as Tsuy), Crispin Piñeda (as Toting), Meryl Soriano (as Alma), Beth Tamayo (as Divina), and Joel Torre (as Mayor Siloy).|$|E

The following three year, formative evaluation closely watched {{the implementation of}} a program to integrate social emotional learning (<b>SEL)</b> curriculum into Lakeland Union High School. Like many other U. S. public schools, Lakeland Union High School is in need of addressing their student's poor academic achievement and negative behavioral actions. Lakeland Union chose <b>SEL</b> programming to focus their instructional efforts toward. <b>SEL</b> programming focuses on five specific competency areas specific to promoting prosocial skills to young learners. Integrative <b>SEL</b> programming designed for classroom instruction is fairly new to the educational field, yet is highly regarded for its instructional approach. Three rounds of data collected over three academic school years were utilized to investigate the school's experience with implementing <b>SEL</b> programming. A survey was used for round one, in exploring the relationship between <b>SEL</b> homeroom programming with the attitudes of students and teachers at Lakeland Union High. The second round of data collection interviewed several teachers concerning the implementation process to gain depth and to continue exploring <b>SEL</b> implementation. Data collected in the third round involved additional exploratory techniques of classroom observation, teacher focus groups and administrator interviews, and gained further insight into <b>SEL</b> programming integration. Teacher and student attitudes toward the <b>SEL</b> first round programming were not favorable. The homeroom <b>SEL</b> activity programming approach was dropped after a formal grievance was filed by the teacher's union. An integrated <b>SEL</b> classroom approach was inserted for the second round of programming. Teachers favored this approach to <b>SEL</b> programming, although reported issues and challenges with the school wide <b>SEL</b> initiative. The third round of <b>SEL</b> implementation continued with the <b>SEL</b> integrated classroom approach. It was determined that the <b>SEL</b> initiative at this point was still not fully thriving at the school. Findings in all three rounds provide information integral for program improvement, which leads to three primary recommendations for the school to address in their continuing efforts with <b>SEL</b> programming. Future programming recommendations include: 1) administration sets clear parameters for the <b>SEL</b> initiative, 2) professional development focused on <b>SEL</b> integrated curriculum programming, and 3) outline <b>SEL</b> integrative curriculum assessment for evidence-based practice...|$|R
40|$|<b>SEL</b> 1 L-A, a transmembrane {{glycoprotein}} {{residing in}} the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), is {{a component of the}} ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway. Alternative splicing generates two smaller <b>SEL</b> 1 L isoforms, -B and -C, that lack the <b>SEL</b> 1 L-A membrane-spanning region but retain some sel- 1 -like repeats, known to be involved in multi-protein interactions and signal transduction. In this study the functional characteristics of <b>SEL</b> 1 L-B and -C were investigated in human cell models. We show that these two isoforms are induced upon ER stress and activation of the unfolded protein response, together with <b>SEL</b> 1 L-A. Using transient transfection experiments (based on wild-type and mutant <b>SEL</b> 1 L constructs) combined with several biochemical tests we show that <b>SEL</b> 1 L-B and, more prominently, <b>SEL</b> 1 L-C are secreted glycoproteins. Although <b>SEL</b> 1 L-C is in monomeric form, <b>SEL</b> 1 L-B is engaged in intramolecular/intermolecular disulfide bonds. Both isoforms localize in secretory and degradative cellular compartments and in areas of cell-cell contact. However, whereas <b>SEL</b> 1 L-B is mainly associated with membranes, <b>SEL</b> 1 L-C shows the typical intralumenal localization of soluble proteins and is present in intercellular spaces. Furthermore, because of its peroxisomal domain, <b>SEL</b> 1 L-C localizes to peroxisomes. Both <b>SEL</b> 1 L-B and -C are involved in sorting and exporting unassembled Ig-μs but do not affect two other ERAD substrates, the null Hong Kong variant of α 1 -antitrypsin, and mutant α 1 -AT Z. Overall these findings suggest that <b>SEL</b> 1 L-B and -C participate to novel molecular pathways that, in parallel with ERAD, contribute to the disposure of misfolded/unfolded or orphan proteins through degradation or secretion...|$|R

40|$|Increasing {{evidence}} suggests that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress {{plays an important role}} in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes mellitus. <b>SEL</b> 1 L is an ER membrane protein that is highly expressed in the pancreatic islet and acinar cells. We have recently reported that a deficiency of <b>SEL</b> 1 L causes systemic ER stress and leads to embryonic lethality in mice. Here we show that mice with one functional allele of <b>Sel</b> 1 l (<b>Sel</b> 1 l+/−) are more susceptible to high fat diet (HFD) -induced hyperglycemia. <b>Sel</b> 1 l+/− mice have a markedly reduced β-cell mass as a result of decreased β-cell proliferation. Consequently, <b>Sel</b> 1 l+/− mice are severely glucose-intolerant and exhibit significantly retarded glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Pancreatic islets from <b>Sel</b> 1 l+/− mice stimulated with a high concentration of glucose in vitro express significantly higher levels of unfolded protein response genes than those from wild-type control mice. Furthermore, dominant-negative interference of <b>SEL</b> 1 L function in insulinoma cell lines severely impairs, whereas overexpression of <b>SEL</b> 1 L efficiently improves protein secretion. Taken together, our results indicate that haploid insufficiency of <b>SEL</b> 1 L predispose mice to high fat diet-induced hyperglycemia. Our findings highlight a critical and previously unknown function for <b>SEL</b> 1 L in regulating adult β-cell function and growth...|$|R

40|$|Terminally {{misfolded}} proteins are selectively {{recognized and}} cleared by the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway. <b>SEL</b> 1 L, {{a component of}} the ERAD machinery, {{plays an important role in}} selecting and transporting ERAD substrates for degradation. We have determined the crystal structure of the mouse <b>SEL</b> 1 L central domain comprising five <b>Sel</b> 1 -Like Repeats (SLR motifs 5 to 9; hereafter called <b>SEL</b> 1 Lcent). Strikingly, <b>SEL</b> 1 Lcent forms a homodimer with two-fold symmetry in a head-to-tail manner. Particularly, the SLR motif 9 plays an important role in dimer formation by adopting a domain-swapped structure and providing an extensive dimeric interface. We identified that the full-length <b>SEL</b> 1 L forms a self-oligomer through the <b>SEL</b> 1 Lcent domain in mammalian cells. Furthermore, we discovered that the SLR-C, comprising SLR motifs 10 and 11, of <b>SEL</b> 1 L directly interacts with the N-terminus luminal loops of HRD 1. Therefore, we propose that certain SLR motifs of <b>SEL</b> 1 L play a unique role in membrane bound ERAD machinery. ope...|$|R
