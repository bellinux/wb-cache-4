5|$|Clinton now faced a lesser-known {{candidate}} in Lazio. While a relative moderate among House Republicans, Lazio had frequently supported former House <b>Speaker</b> <b>Newt</b> Gingrich, a largely despised figure among many New Yorkers.

5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the 1998 midterm elections, where the GOP lost five House seats and failed to make a net gain of seats in the Senate, House <b>Speaker</b> <b>Newt</b> Gingrich of Georgia stood down for the speakership and declined to take his seat for an 11th term.

5|$|Clark {{set himself}} three initial goals in {{civilian}} life—to earn $40 {{million in the}} business world and practice philanthropy, to become an adjunct professor, and to become a professional golfer. Clark began a public speaking tour in the summer of 2000 and approached several former government officials for advice on work after life in government, including House <b>Speaker</b> <b>Newt</b> Gingrich, White House Chief of Staff Mack McLarty, and Richard Holbrooke. Clark took McLarty's advice to move back to Little Rock, Arkansas, and took a position with the Stephens Group, an investment firm headquartered there. He took several other board positions at defense-related firms, and in March 2003 he amicably left the Stephens Group to found Wesley K. Clark & Associates. Clark wrote two books, Waging Modern War and Winning Modern Wars. He also authored forewords for a series of military biographies and a series of editorials. He had amassed only about $3.1 million towards his $40 million goal by 2003, and he began considering running for public office instead of pursuing his business career.|$|E

25|$|In 1998, Clinton was impeached by the House of Representatives {{on charges}} of lying about a sexual {{relationship}} with White House intern Monica Lewinsky. He was acquitted by the Senate. The failure of impeachment and the Democratic gains in the 1998 election forced House <b>Speaker</b> <b>Newt</b> Gingrich, a Republican, to resign from Congress.|$|E
25|$|In 2005, Clinton {{was joined}} by former House <b>Speaker</b> <b>Newt</b> Gingrich, who once led the Republican {{opposition}} to her husband's administration, {{in support of a}} proposal for incremental universal health care.

25|$|In the House, Coburn {{earned a}} {{reputation}} as a political maverick due to his frequent battles with House <b>Speaker</b> <b>Newt</b> Gingrich. Most of these stand-offs stemmed from his belief that the Republican caucus was moving toward the political center and away from the more conservative Contract With America policy proposals that had brought the Republicans into power in Congress in 1994 {{for the first time in}} 40 years.|$|E
25|$|Unlike in Westminster style legislatures or as {{with the}} Senate Majority Leader, the House Majority Leader's duties and {{prominence}} vary depending upon the style {{and power of the}} Speaker of the House. Typically, the Speaker does not participate in debate and rarely votes on the floor. In some cases, Majority Leaders have been more influential than the Speaker; notably Tom DeLay who was more prominent than Speaker Dennis Hastert. In addition, <b>Speaker</b> <b>Newt</b> Gingrich delegated to Dick Armey an unprecedented level of authority over scheduling legislation on the House floor.|$|E
25|$|After {{leading a}} pack of minor {{candidates}} for much of 2010 and 2011, former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney, despite outmatching his opponents in both money and organization, struggled {{to hold on to}} his lead for the 2012 GOP nomination. As the presidential campaign season headed toward the voting stage in January 2012, one candidate after another surged past Romney, held the lead for a few weeks, then fell back. According to the RealClearPolitics 2012 polling index, five candidates {{at one time or another}} were the top choice of GOP voters: Texas Governor Rick Perry, motivational speaker Herman Cain, former <b>Speaker</b> <b>Newt</b> Gingrich, former Senator Rick Santorum and Romney himself.|$|E
25|$|As Congressman, Watts was {{assigned}} to the Armed Services Committee and the Financial Services Committee. Watts emphasized moral absolutes and was considered in line with Republican <b>Speaker</b> <b>Newt</b> Gingrich's agenda, the Contract with America, and at the time was the only African-American who did not join the Congressional Black Caucus. He initially supported ending affirmative action, declaring inadequate education the main obstacle for racial equality, but subsequently opposed legislation banning the practice for the federal government. Watts focused on promoting his party, attending NAACP meetings and meeting with representatives from historically black colleges. In 1995, Watts was named national co-chairman for the presidential campaign of Republican Bob Dole.|$|E
25|$|In late April 2003, Price {{formally}} {{announced his}} candidacy for Georgia's 6th congressional {{district in the}} United State House of Representatives. The seat was being vacated by Republican Johnny Isakson, who had decided to pursue {{an opening in the}} U.S. Senate. Bob Barr, a former U.S. Congressman, was considered an early frontrunner in the race to replace Isakson, but Barr withdrew his candidacy for personal reasons, shortly before Price entered the race. Price went onto run against two fellow state senators, Chuck Clay and Robert Lamutt, as well as two state representatives, Roger Hines and Mark Burkhalter. Also taking part in the race was John McCallum, a former aid to U.S. House <b>Speaker</b> <b>Newt</b> Gingrich.|$|E
25|$|Starting with Republican Nicholas Longworth in 1925, and {{continued}} through the Democrats' control of the House from 1931 to 1995, save for Republican majorities in 1947–49 and 1953–55, all majority leaders have directly ascended to the Speakership brought upon by the retirement of the incumbent. The only exceptions during this period were Charles A. Halleck who became Republican House leader and Minority Leader from 1959 to 1965, Hale Boggs {{who died in a}} plane crash, and Dick Gephardt who became the Democrats' House leader but as Minority Leader since his party lost control in the 1994 midterm elections. Since 1995, the only Majority Leader to become Speaker is John Boehner, though indirectly as his party lost control in the 2006 midterms elections. He subsequently served as Republican House leader and Minority Leader from 2007 to 2011 and then was elected Speaker when the House reconvened in 2011. In 1998, with <b>Speaker</b> <b>Newt</b> Gingrich announcing his resignation, both Majority Leader Dick Armey and Majority Whip Tom DeLay did not contest the Speakership which eventually went to Chief Deputy Whip Dennis Hastert.|$|E

Unopposed in the Democratic primary, he ran against Republican {{incumbent}} Peter Blute in the general election. His campaign slogan focused on unseating House <b>Speaker</b> <b>Newt</b> Gingrich: [...] "To dump Newt you have to dump Blute." [...] Blute was endorsed by The Boston Globe and five other local papers, but McGovern won the election with 53 percent of the vote.

500|$|On {{the day of}} shooting, Officer Chestnut {{and another}} officer were {{assigned}} to operate the X-ray machine and magnetometer at the Document Door entrance located on the East Front of the Capitol, which was open only to Members of Congress and their staff. Detective Gibson {{was assigned to the}} dignitary protection detail of Rep. Tom DeLay (R-TX) and was in his suite of offices near this door. Weston, armed with a [...]38 caliber Smith & Wesson six-shot revolver, entered the Document Door at 3:40p.m. At the same time, Officer Chestnut was providing directions to a tourist and his son while his partner escorted another tourist towards the restroom. Weston reportedly walked around the metal detector just inside the entrance; Chestnut requested he go back through the detector. Weston suddenly produced the gun and without warning, shot Chestnut {{in the back of the}} head at point-blank range. According to witnesses, he turned down a short corridor and pushed through a door which leads to a group of offices used by senior Republican representatives including then Majority Whip Tom DeLay and Representative Dennis Hastert, future Speaker of the House and a close protégé of then <b>Speaker</b> <b>Newt</b> Gingrich.|$|E

2500|$|But {{proponents of}} CDHC, such as former House <b>Speaker</b> <b>Newt</b> Gingrich, {{have pointed to}} the rise of the Internet and online {{comparative}} shopping health services as one reason they believe the CDHC model is viable.

2500|$|In the Western world, sharia {{has been}} called a source of [...] "hysteria", [...] "more {{controversial}} than ever", the one aspect of Islam that inspires [...] "particular dread".

2500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1997 several House Republicans, who saw <b>Speaker</b> <b>Newt</b> Gingrich's public image as a liability, {{attempted}} to replace him as Speaker. The attempted [...] "coup" [...] began July 9 with a meeting between Republican conference chairman Boehner and Republican leadership chairman Bill Paxon of New York. According to their plan, House Majority Leader Dick Armey, House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, Boehner and Paxon were to present Gingrich with an ultimatum: resign, or be voted out.

2500|$|Organizations {{such as the}} American Medical Association (AMA) and AARP {{support a}} [...] "fair and {{accurate}} valuation for all physician services". Very few resources exist, however, that allow consumers to compare physician prices (one exception is CostOfDoctors.com) The AMA sponsors the Specialty Society Relative Value Scale Update Committee, a private group of physicians which largely determine how to value physician labor in Medicare prices. Among politicians, former House <b>Speaker</b> <b>Newt</b> Gingrich has called for transparency in the prices of medical devices, noting {{it is one of}} the few aspects or U.S. health care where consumers and federal health officials are [...] "barred from comparing the quality, medical outcomes or price".|$|E
2500|$|The primary contest {{began in}} 2011 {{with a fairly}} wide field. Mitt Romney, former Governor of Massachusetts and the runner-up in the 2008 primaries, had been {{preparing}} {{to run for president}} ever since the 2008 election, and was from early on the favorite to win the nomination. However, he lacked support from the party's conservative wing and the media narrative became: [...] "Who will be the anti-Romney candidate?" [...] Several candidates rose in the polls throughout the year. However, the field was down to four candidates by February 2012: Former House <b>speaker</b> <b>Newt</b> Gingrich, U.S. Congressman Ron Paul, former Governor Romney and former U.S. Senator Rick Santorum. It was the first presidential primary to be affected by a Supreme Court ruling that allowed unlimited independent expenditures to support or oppose candidates through super PACs.|$|E
2500|$|With a {{majority}} of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents {{under the age of}} 49 supporting legal recognition of same-sex marriages versus the opposition remaining from those over 50, the issue remains a particular divide within the Party. Former House <b>Speaker</b> <b>Newt</b> Gingrich has remarked that the [...] "Party is going to be torn on this issue" [...] with some constituents [...] "going to flake off". A Reuters/Ipsos survey from April 2015 found that 68% of Americans overall would attend the same-sex wedding of a loved one, with 56% of Republicans agreeing. Reuters journalist Jeff Mason remarked that [...] "Republicans who stake out strong opposition to gay marriage could be on shaky political ground if their ultimate goal is to win the White House" [...] given the divide between the social conservative stalwarts {{and the rest of the}} U.S. that opposes them.|$|E
