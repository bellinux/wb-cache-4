40|$|A {{pilot scale}} {{simulation}} is performed for enhanced oil recovery by CO 2 injection to M field in Indonesia. CO 2 stimulation (Huff and Puff) method is {{considered as one}} of the most successful processes to increase oil recovery. Prior to the CO 2 injection, water is injected to support an additional reservoir pressure. 1, 000 tons of CO 2 are injected into M- 19 well for 50 days. After 30 days of soaking, production is resumed and continued for 10 years. Cumulative oil recovery from Huff and Puff process is increased by 2 % compared with primary production, mainly due to viscosity reduction observed near the well. The oil viscosity near the wellbore is reduced by 26 % due to the dissolved CO 2 gas. To maximize the oil recovery from CO 2 Huff and Puff process, the operating conditions are optimized. The design parameters include water injection rate, CO 2 injection rate, water injection time, and soaking time. Through optimization based on DECE, the oil recovery is increased by 12 % and 9. 8 % compared with primary production and stimulated case without optimization, respectively. The oil viscosity decreases by 70 % though CO 2 <b>soaking</b> <b>area</b> is smaller than that of non-optimized case. This study shows that CO 2 Huff and Puff method has a potential to improve oil recovery and optimized operating design is needed to produce more oil...|$|E

50|$|Symptoms on leaves {{initially}} occur {{where water}} droplets accumulate and eventually form small, brown spots surrounded by halos {{on the upper}} surface of leaves. These spots expand very quickly and form large brown lesions. The entire leaf can be destroyed {{within a few days}} of the initial appearance of symptoms under wet conditions.

2500|$|Urine {{spraying}} is {{a variable}} behaviour. It may consist of simply dribbling {{a few drops}} of urine, or, large rhythmic discharges from an erect penis. [...] A stream may be aimed at the mane on the neck, or, a fine mist might be [...] sprayed against the stomach. The bull usually rub/palpates during this process. The urine can be voided almost at right angles to the erect penis. When a large volume of urine is sprayed, it usually takes place at a wallow. [...] When urine spraying, the bull lowers his head towards the ground. [...] In this position, his mane becomes soaked as he sprays urine forwards, between his legs.

50|$|Botryotinia polyblastis {{is known}} to attack {{ornamental}} plants of the genus Narcissus. Plants in this genus {{are commonly known as}} daffodils, paper whites and jonquils. Botryotinia polyblastis generally attacks its host in three stages beginning with the flower and ending with an infection of the leaves. The disease first infects the flower through water <b>soaked</b> <b>areas</b> on petals and causes those petals to brown, wither and die. The disease then causes the formation of elliptical-shaped, tan leaf spots appear on the tips of the hosts leaves. The leaf spots typically start off small and can eventually grow to be greater than 5mm in length. Shortly after the appearance of leaf spots the leaves begin to exhibit chlorosis. Once the plant has lost the majority of its leaves to Botryotinia polyblastis the plant can no longer photosynthesize sufficiently and dies. The foliar symptoms caused by Botryotinia polyblastis, namely chlorosis, are often mistaken for natural senescence. However, the chlorosis of a leaf infected by Botryotinia polyblastis occurs much more rapidly and should not be mistaken for early senescence. These symptoms are also sometimes confused with those caused by Stagonospora curtisii, which is responsible for Narcissus Scorch.|$|R

40|$|<b>Soaks</b> (<b>areas</b> of mesotrophic/minerotrophic {{vegetation}} within acid bog) add to {{the overall}} heterogeneity and biodiversity of raised bog landscapes due {{to the presence of}} flora and fauna communities not typically associated with acid bog systems. A field experiment was set up to investigate the potential to restore the minerotrophic and aquatic communities that previously occurred within a soak of an oceanic raised bog in Ireland, which has recently undergone acidification with the expansion of acid bog type vegetation. Three different treatments, control (intact sphagnaceous raft), permeable (sphagnaceous raft removed), and enclosed (sphagnaceous raft removed and plots isolated from surrounding surface water influence) were applied to a total of six plots (each measuring 4 × 4 m), each treatment consisting of two replicates. Within 3 years a sphagnaceous raft with similar vegetation to the surroundings had developed in both permeable plots, while aquatic communities similar to those that occurred at the site in the past had established within the enclosed pots. Our results show that with manipulation of local hydrology it is possible to recreate conditions suitable for aquatic plant communities that once characterized the site. The results also give an insight into the likely processes responsible for the initial terrestrialization of the entire soak over the past century.

40|$|Oceanic {{juvenile}} loggerhead sea turtles, Caretta caretta, foraging in Azorean waters, are incidentally {{caught in}} drifting longlines that target swordfish, Xiphias gladius, and blue shark, Prionace glauca. Data were recorded during a longline gear modification experiment conducted in 2000. The {{results show that}} the captures are not uniformly distributed in relation to fishing effort, with 81 % of the loggerheads (N = 232) caught in one-third of the sets (N = 93). The highest turtle catch rates were around the eastern group of islands, an area characterized by the presence of mesoscale eddies induced by bathymetric features. High catch rates coincided with the presence of the thermohaline front, between August and October, and when targeting blue shark. To investigate the causes of these differences we fitted a general linear model to evaluate the influence of mean depth, minimum depth, sea surface temperature (SST), <b>soak</b> <b>area,</b> <b>soak</b> time, moon phase and wind force on turtle and target species catch rates. These results revealed that mean depth and SST were most important for loggerhead catch rates, while minimum depth was the only significant variable for swordfish and mean depth, SST, wind force, moon phase and soak time influenced blue shark catches. The distribution of loggerhead sea turtles can be predicted by monitoring fishing areas in relation to bathymetry and SST. The impact of longline fishing could be greatly and quickly reduced by regulating the blue shark fishery and by increasing fishermen awareness for sea turtle conservation...|$|R

The occurrence of <b>soak</b> systems (<b>areas</b> of mesotrophic/minerotrophic vegetation within acid bog) adds {{greatly to the}} scientific interest of Clara Bog. Recent research into the vegetation history of a soak system on Clara Bog known as Lough Roe indicates that major vegetation changes have occurred within the soak over the past century.
