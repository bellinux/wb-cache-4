5|$|After {{retiring}} from the IAEA, Smyth remained active. On the 40th anniversary of the Trinity test in 1985, he denounced President Ronald Reagan's <b>Strategic</b> <b>Defense</b> <b>Initiative</b> and called for joint arms reductions between the United States and the Soviet Union. He died September 11, 1986, in Princeton. The cause was cardiac arrest, though he had long battled cancer.|$|E
5|$|In {{his later}} years, Teller became {{especially}} {{known for his}} advocacy of controversial technological solutions to both military and civilian problems, including a plan to excavate an artificial harbor in Alaska using thermonuclear explosive in what was called Project Chariot. He was a vigorous advocate of Ronald Reagan's <b>Strategic</b> <b>Defense</b> <b>Initiative.</b>|$|E

5|$|In {{later life}} {{he was a}} critic of the <b>Strategic</b> <b>Defense</b> <b>Initiative.</b> He {{authored}} or co-authored a number of books critical of the Cold War and the nuclear arms race, including Winding Down: The Price of Defense (1979), The Nuclear Almanac (1984), Reason Enough to Hope (1998) Beyond the Looking Glass (1993).|$|E
5|$|On March 23, 1983, President Reagan {{announced}} the <b>Strategic</b> <b>Defense</b> <b>Initiative,</b> a ground and space-based weapons {{system designed to}} protect from nuclear attack. Matlock continued to advise the President on policy toward the Soviet Union and on September 1, 1983, when the Soviets shot down commercial flight KAL 007, Matlock returned to Washington to work with White House officials.|$|E
5|$|Hansell lectured on {{the theory}} of {{precision}} air attack throughout his life, particularly at the United States Air Force Academy and the Air War College. He authored three books on air strategy: The Air War Plan That Defeated Hitler (1972), The Strategic Air War Against Japan (1980), and Strategic Air War Against Germany and Japan: A Memoir (1986). Hansell continued to study modern weapons systems, becoming an advocate of the <b>Strategic</b> <b>Defense</b> <b>Initiative</b> and the B-2 Spirit bomber. However his main focus was in promoting technical advances in precision guided weapons to make precision bombing more practical and therefore more desirable as a military strategy.|$|E
50|$|The Arm Slave is a {{development}} of the Reagan Administration <b>Strategic</b> <b>Defense</b> <b>Initiative's</b> research in the 1980s into powered exoskeletal suits to increase the ground soldier's combat capability. Called the XM3, the first powered suit {{was nothing more than}} a powered exoskeleton sized around 2 meters tall. This proved to be of low combat effectiveness as it offered little advantage in protection in exchange for its limited mobility. This early prototype was hampered by the lack of a suitable power source that did not burden the unit past its useful load.|$|R
50|$|ODIN is {{an energy}} weapon which {{converts}} a small nuclear bomb into a directed incinerating beam (a weapon concept {{similar to the}} <b>Strategic</b> <b>Defense</b> <b>Initiative's</b> Project Excalibur). This {{has the power to}} exterminate cities (both traction and static) and provoke volcanic eruptions. Its beam can be seen for very long distances and seems to interfere with the mechanical minds of Stalkers. Only Shrike's Old-Tech Stalker brain has the mettle to withstand this, although he goes into a fit-like state and it is hinted he is saved by Dr Oenone Zero. Anna Fang is unaffected. Other Stalkers lose all power.|$|R

While Ferraro's pro-choice views conflicted with those of many of her constituents {{as well as the}} Catholic Church to which she belonged, her positions on other social and foreign policy issues were in alignment with the district. She broke with her party in favoring an anti-busing amendment to the Constitution. She supported deployment of the PershingII missile and the Trident submarine, although she opposed funding for the MX missile, the B-1B bomber, and the <b>Strategic</b> <b>Defense</b> <b>Initiative.</b>|$|E
5|$|Klaus Dodds {{has noted}} {{that there is a}} geopolitical aspect to the {{locations}} used, although this is often a pre-emption of an issue by the film. For example, in the first film, Dr. No, the title villain's disruption of the American Project Mercury space launch from Cape Canaveral with his atomic-powered radio beam mirrored claims that American rocket testing at Cape Canaveral had problems with rockets going astray. Similarly Bond's anti-heroin mission in Live and Let Die coincided with President Nixon's 1972 declaration of a War on Drugs, whilst GoldenEye played against the backdrop of Ronald Reagan's <b>Strategic</b> <b>Defense</b> <b>Initiative.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{particular}} {{influence was}} the speech made by President Ronald Reagan on 23 March 1983 announcing the <b>Strategic</b> <b>Defense</b> <b>Initiative</b> (SDI) which, using ground-based and space-based systems, proposed protecting the United States from attack by nuclear missiles. One of {{the supporters of}} SDI was one-time US presidential candidate Lyndon LaRouche, on whom Kennedy Martin based the character of Jerry Grogan, owner of the Fusion Corporation of Kansas. Kennedy Martin was also influenced by the culture of secrecy surrounding the UK's policy regarding nuclear power {{in light of the}} inquiry into the construction of the Sizewell B nuclear power station and the concerns about the safety record of the Sellafield nuclear reprocessing plant; this led him to conceive International Irradiated Fuels and its chief executive Robert Bennett.|$|E
40|$|The <b>Strategic</b> <b>Defense</b> <b>Initiative's</b> (SDI) {{investment}} in particle accelerator technology for its directed energy weapons program has produced breakthroughs {{in the size}} and power of new accelerators. These accelerators, in turn, have produced spinoffs in several areas: the radio frequency quadrupole linear accelerator (RFQ linac) was recently incorporated into {{the design of a}} cancer therapy unit at the Loma Linda University Medical Center, an SDI-sponsored compact induction linear accelerator may replace Cobalt- 60 radiation and hazardous ethylene-oxide as a method for sterilizing medical products, and other SDIO-funded accelerators may be used to produce the radioactive isotopes oxygen- 15, nitrogen- 13, carbon- 11, and fluorine- 18 for positron emission tomography (PET). Other applications of these accelerators include bomb detection, non-destructive inspection, decomposing toxic substances in contaminated ground water, and eliminating nuclear waste...|$|R
5000|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, Nozette, {{as part of}} the <b>Strategic</b> <b>Defense</b> <b>Initiative's</b> 'Brilliant Pebbles', {{conceived}} the idea (and then led the mission) of the Clementine spacecraft as a means to both provide a test bed for the development of lighter, more cost effective advanced space technology, as well as to obtain data for the Moon.Nozette and colleagues' bistatic radar results from Clementine claimed to support the discovery of water on the south pole of the moon. Although the significance of the result was questioned, measurements made by subsequent Lunar missions have supported the hypothesis that the Moon holds substantially greater reserves of water than had been thought based on Apollo program results and confirmed Nozette's original findings. [...] The engineering model of the Clementine spacecraft, which Nozette created and led the design of, hangs in the Air & Space Museum in Washington DC.|$|R
5000|$|The PAC-3 upgrade {{carried with}} it a new missile design, {{nominally}} known as MIM-104F and called PAC-3 by the Army. The PAC-3 missile evolved from the <b>Strategic</b> <b>Defense</b> <b>Initiative's</b> ERINT missile, {{and so it is}} dedicated almost entirely to the anti-ballistic missile mission. Due to miniaturization, a single canister can hold four PAC-3 missiles (as opposed to one PAC-2 missile per canister). The PAC-3 missile is also more maneuverable than previous variants, due to 180 tiny pulse solid propellant rocket motors mounted in the forebody of the missile (called Attitude Control Motors, or ACMs) which serve to fine align the missile trajectory with its target to achieve hit-to-kill capability. However, the most significant upgrade to the PAC-3 missile is the addition of a Ka band active radar seeker. This allows the missile to drop its uplink to the system and acquire its target itself in the terminal phase of its intercept, which improves the reaction time of the missile against a fast-moving ballistic missile target. The PAC-3 missile is accurate enough to select, target, and home in on the warhead portion of an inbound ballistic missile. The active radar also gives the warhead a [...] "hit-to-kill" [...] (kinetic kill vehicle) capability that completely eliminates the need for a traditional proximity-fused warhead. However, the missile still has a small explosive warhead, called Lethality Enhancer, a warhead which launches 24 low-speed tungsten fragments in radial direction to make the missile cross-section greater and enhance the kill probability. This greatly increases the lethality against ballistic missiles of all types.|$|R
5|$|In {{response}} to the Kremlin's military and political concessions, Reagan agreed to renew talks on economic issues and the scaling-back of the arms race. The first summit was held in November 1985 in Geneva, Switzerland. At one stage the two men, accompanied only by an interpreter, agreed in principle to reduce each country's nuclear arsenal by 50percent. A second summit, was held in October 1986, Reykjavík, Iceland. Talks went well until the focus shifted to Reagan's proposed <b>Strategic</b> <b>Defense</b> <b>Initiative,</b> which Gorbachev wanted eliminated. Reagan refused. The negotiations failed, but the third summit in 1987 led to a breakthrough with {{the signing of the}} Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF). The INF treaty eliminated all nuclear-armed, ground-launched ballistic and cruise missiles with ranges between 500 and 5,500kilometers (300 to 3,400miles) and their infrastructure.|$|E
5|$|In 1983, Cold War {{tensions}} between the United States and Soviet Union had escalated to a level {{not seen since the}} Cuban Missile Crisis because of several factors. These included the United States' <b>Strategic</b> <b>Defense</b> <b>Initiative,</b> its planned deployment of the Pershing II weapon system in Europe in March and April, and FleetEx '83, the largest naval exercise held to date in the North Pacific. The military hierarchy of the Soviet Union (particularly the old guard led by Soviet General Secretary Yuri Andropov and Minister of Defence Dmitry Ustinov) viewed these actions as bellicose and destabilizing; they were deeply suspicious of U.S. President Ronald Reagan's intentions and openly fearful he was planning a pre-emptive nuclear strike against the Soviet Union. These fears culminated in RYAN, the code name for a secret intelligence-gathering program initiated by Andropov to detect a potential nuclear sneak attack which he believed Reagan was plotting.|$|E
5|$|Kennedy easily {{defeated}} Republican businessman Ray Shamie to win {{re-election in}} 1982. Senate leaders granted him {{a seat on}} the Armed Services Committee, while allowing him to keep his other major seats despite the traditional limit of two such seats. Kennedy became very visible in opposing aspects of the foreign policy of the Reagan administration, including U.S. intervention in the Salvadoran Civil War and U.S. support for the Contras in Nicaragua, and in opposing Reagan-supported weapons systems, including the B-1 bomber, the MX missile, and the <b>Strategic</b> <b>Defense</b> <b>Initiative.</b> Kennedy became the Senate's leading advocate for a nuclear freeze and was a critic of Reagan's confrontational policies toward the Soviet Union. A 1983 memorandum from KGB chairman Viktor Chebrikov to general secretary Yuri Andropov noted this stance and asserted that Kennedy, through former Senator John Tunney's discussions with Soviet contacts, had suggested that U.S.-Soviet relations might be improved if Kennedy and Andropov could meet in person to discuss arms control issues and if top Soviet officials, via Kennedy's help, were able to address the American public through the U.S. news media. Andropov was unimpressed by the idea.|$|E
