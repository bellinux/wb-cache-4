50|$|Benzenesulfonic acid (conjugate base benzenesulfonate) is an {{organosulfur}} compound {{with the}} formula C6H5SO3H. It is the simplest aromatic sulfonic acid. It forms white deliquescent sheet crystals or a white waxy solid that is {{soluble in water}} and ethanol, slightly soluble in benzene and insoluble in nonpolar solvents like diethyl ether. It is often stored {{in the form of}} alkali metal salts. Its aqueous <b>solution</b> <b>is</b> <b>strongly</b> <b>acidic.</b>|$|R
50|$|Phenylsulfinic acid is an {{organosulfur}} compound {{with the}} formula C6H5SO2H. It is a colorless or {{white crystalline solid}} that is usually stored {{in the form of}} its sodium salt.

40|$|AISI 316 L {{metallic}} {{components of}} an industrial plant, producing tartaric acid as by-product of grape pressing, {{were subjected to}} a so severe corrosive attack to promote the search of alternative stainless steels for this specific application. The aggressive industrial <b>solution</b> <b>is</b> <b>strongly</b> <b>acidic</b> and it contains large amounts of chlorides and sulphates and it operates in the temperature range of 25 – 60 °C. As possible alternative materials to AISI 316 L, two super austenitic stainless steels, AISI 904 L and SanicroTM 28, and three duplex stainless steels, SAF 2707 HDTM, SAF 2507 TM and SAF 2205 TM, were tested. The steels were characterised by means of chemical analysis, metallographic observations and anodic polarisations in a tartaric acid saturated solution, both in presence and in absence of chlorides and sulphates. The AISI 316 L alloy showed the presence of ferrite δ at the austenitic grain boundaries, {{which is responsible for}} a selective attack and severe damage of this material. Among the tested steels, as alternative to AISI 316 L, Sanicro 28 TM and AISI 904 L can be considered promising, with a preference for Sanicro 28 TM. SAF 2707 HDTM showed a passive behaviour only with a mirror surface finishing, which is not acceptable for service conditions...|$|R

Much of the campground near the eastern boundary is supported by Morris gravelly silt loam, which is somewhat poorly drained due to a subsoil fragipan.

40|$|A {{glasshouse}} trial, {{in which}} maize (Zea mays L. cv.

50|$|Photoacids are {{molecules}} which {{become more}} acidic upon absorption of light. This is due {{either to the}} formation of strong acids upon photodissociation, or to the dissociation of protons upon photoassociation (e.g. ring-closing). There are two main types of molecules that release protons upon illumination: photoacid generators (PAGs) and photoacids (PAHs). PAGs undergo proton photodissociation irreversibly, while PAHs are molecules that undergo proton photodissociation and thermal reassociation. In this case the excited state <b>is</b> <b>strongly</b> <b>acidic,</b> but reversible.|$|R

500|$|A {{variety of}} soil types with differing {{physical}} properties are found at Level Mountain. Shallow, coarse, textured, steep to strongly sloping soils dominate {{peaks of the}} Level Mountain Range and owe their origin to weathering of volcanic bedrock.

30|$|On the contrary, {{chemical}} hydrolysis {{carried out}} under acidic or alkaline conditions and heat {{has the advantage}} that the waste matter is solubilised {{to a greater extent}} than under mild conditions [17, 20, 24].
