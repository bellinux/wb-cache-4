25|$|Murdoch and Moody {{oversaw the}} {{lowering}} of Boat 15 concurrently with Boat 13 and {{it reached the}} water only a minute later, at 1:41a.m. Fireman Frank Dymond {{was put in charge}} of what was the most heavily loaded boat at launching, with about 65 people aboard. It was so heavily loaded that the gunwales were reported to be far down in the water; one female passenger later said that when <b>she</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>against</b> the gunwale her hair trailed in the water. The boat {{was one of the last}} to be recovered by Carpathia, at about 7:30a.m.|$|E
2500|$|On May 29, Harlow was {{shooting}} {{a scene in}} which the character she was playing had a fever. Harlow was clearly sicker than her character, and when <b>she</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>against</b> co-star Gable between scenes, said, [...] "I feel terrible. Get me back to my dressing room." [...] Harlow requested that the assistant director telephone William Powell, who left his own set to escort Harlow back home.|$|E
60|$|His arm {{was about}} her shoulder. For a second <b>she</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>against</b> him.|$|E
50|$|In 1965, {{the team}} reached the semi-final Algeria Football Cup, where <b>she</b> <b>leans</b> <b>against</b> the Mostaganémois the ESM.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>leaned</b> heavily <b>against</b> the doorpost, shivering.... Holder saw Sally Grover {{coming down}} the stairs.|$|R
40|$|The tinted {{postcard}} {{depicts a}} young girl wearing a pale blue dress with a frilled skirt. <b>She</b> <b>leans</b> <b>against</b> a fallen log in the forest.; The back of the postcard has no handwriting on it. Printed in {{the margin of the}} correspondence section is "Les Pretres du Sacre-Coeur en Afrique" "Elle est belle ma robe!...|$|R
60|$|Again she stopped. <b>She</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>against</b> a tree, trembling, shuddering, and as pale as death.|$|E
60|$|But Columbine did not move, and Wade {{felt her}} shaking as <b>she</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>against</b> him.|$|E
60|$|Elizabeth {{paused for}} breath {{at the top}} of the third flight of stairs. <b>She</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>against</b> the iron balustrade.|$|E
6000|$|<b>She</b> had <b>leaned</b> <b>against</b> his shoulder, {{appearing}} {{to have lost}} all {{sense of right and}} wrong, and, out of her sobbing, gurgled: ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{shook her}} head slowly as <b>she</b> <b>leaned</b> lovingly <b>against</b> his shoulder. 'You are not sorry, Hester, that you have become my wife?' ...|$|R
60|$|They sit {{side by side}} on the sofa. <b>She</b> <b>leans</b> affectionately <b>against</b> {{him with}} her head on his {{shoulder}} and her eyes half closed.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>against</b> him comfortably. With that {{protecting}} arm about her, {{she felt}} capable of any fatigue. Dr Porhoët stopped.|$|E
60|$|Reaching it she turned, and {{her hands}} still {{pressing}} the coarse blue gown against her heart, <b>she</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>against</b> the door.|$|E
6000|$|... "And Lady Lufton--" [...] said Lucy, {{speaking}} hardly above a whisper, {{and still}} hiding {{her face as}} <b>she</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>against</b> her sister's shoulder.|$|E
60|$|Sir John frowned. Anna was unimpressed. Elegant, {{a little}} scornful, <b>she</b> <b>leaned</b> {{slightly}} <b>against</b> {{the back of}} a chair and looked him steadily in the eyes.|$|R
6000|$|... "St. John's!" [...] <b>She</b> <b>leaned</b> back <b>against</b> {{the piano}} and laughed unrestrainedly. [...] "That's a good one, to think how {{straight}} I've been talking to you." ...|$|R
60|$|She stood {{staring at}} him, as in terror, {{suddenly}} penetrated by a dismay that sapped her strength, and <b>she</b> <b>leaned</b> heavily <b>against</b> the fireplace, clutching the mantel-shelf.|$|R
60|$|Helen shuddered. Almost fainting, <b>she</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>against</b> the porch, too {{horrified to}} cry out, with {{contracting}} {{heart and a}} chill stealing through her veins.|$|E
60|$|He {{sprang up}} from his seat and whirled her round the room. <b>She</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>against</b> his arm and whispered in his ear. Ella watched her with darkening face.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{have worked}} {{yourself}} up {{to a fine}} pass," [...] said the doctor, patting the agitated girl fondly as <b>she</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>against</b> his knee. [...] "Remember, slow and steady." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not with me?" [...] ses Ginger, {{sitting down}} {{beside her on the}} sofa and putting ’is arm so that <b>she</b> could <b>lean</b> <b>against</b> it if <b>she</b> wanted to.|$|R
60|$|Her grip relaxed. Her hands dropped {{slowly to}} her side. <b>She</b> <b>leaned</b> back <b>against</b> {{the circle of}} his arms, {{and looked up at}} him--a strange look, full of a sweet humility.|$|R
60|$|But {{she looked}} pertly in his face, stood her guitar upright before her, {{and put her}} hands behind her back as <b>she</b> <b>leaned</b> saucily <b>against</b> the wall and shrugged her shoulders.|$|R
6000|$|... "Something {{tells me}} to stay here," [...] and <b>she</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>against</b> a tree and stayed, while Noie, who was tired, sat down between the jutting roots of the tree.|$|E
6000|$|... "What?" [...] said Estella, {{preserving}} {{her attitude}} of indifference as <b>she</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>against</b> the great chimney-piece and only moving her eyes; [...] "do you reproach {{me for being}} cold? You?" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>against</b> the tree-hole {{plaiting}} and unplaiting chance-plucked grass stems. The {{children in}} the wood had drawn nearer. I could see them with the tail of my eye frolicking like squirrels.|$|E
6000|$|But {{her feet}} seemed {{rooted to the}} floor, and <b>she</b> <b>leaned</b> weakly <b>against</b> a shift scene. The {{orchestra}} was beginning over again, and a lone voice from the house piped with startling distinctness: ...|$|R
6000|$|They pass; and ere the {{reflection}} of their joy has faded from his face, another spectacle throws a melancholy shadow over {{the spirit of the}} observing man. In a close carriage sits a fragile figure, muffled carefully, and shrinking even from the mild breath of summer. <b>She</b> <b>leans</b> <b>against</b> a manly form, and his arm infolds her, as if to guard his treasure from some enemy. Let but a few weeks pass, and when he shall strive to embrace that loved one, he will press only desolation to his heart! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{meant to}} get off, I suppose," [...] she said. [...] "I don't believe I'm going any farther." [...] <b>She</b> <b>leaned</b> back <b>against</b> {{the bars of}} the bench, and put up one of her slim arms along the top.|$|R
6000|$|... "I can't marry you," [...] said Lynde desperately. <b>She</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>against</b> a slim white bole {{of a young}} birch {{behind her}} {{and looked at him}} wretchedly. [...] "Won't you please go away and forget me?" ...|$|E
60|$|He obeyed. There was {{something}} changed about her, something {{which he did}} not recognise. She thrust her hands into a box of cigarettes, took one out and lit it. <b>She</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>against</b> the table, facing him.|$|E
60|$|She {{seemed to}} be {{collecting}} her scattered senses now, but great sobs of hysterical laughter still shook her from head to foot, and <b>she</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>against</b> her father's arm {{almost as if she}} feared to fall.|$|E
60|$|Her hand {{upon the}} door, {{laughter}} seized her again, so that for support <b>she</b> had to <b>lean</b> <b>against</b> the wall.|$|R
6000|$|... "No!--dear, brave Philip--but only so thankful {{and happy}} for your escape." [...] Yet, {{at the same}} moment the colour faded from her cheek, and even the sun-kissed line of her upper lip grew bloodless, as <b>she</b> <b>leaned</b> back <b>against</b> a tree.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> {{suddenly}} <b>leaned</b> <b>against</b> him, bowing {{her head}} until it rested lightly upon his breast. And so they stood while another squall, with flying leaves and scattered drops of rain, rattled past. With equal suddenness {{she lifted her}} head and looked at him.|$|R
