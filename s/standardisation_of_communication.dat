40|$|In {{the course}} of {{liberalisation}} of the electrical energy market, {{the pressure on the}} utilities to reduce their investment and maintenance costs is increasing. In order to lower these expenses {{and to be able to}} offer a more efficient supply with electrical energy, the utilities are increasingly using modern communication techniques. Control mechanisms that have been realized with a huge amount of hardware so far are more and more replaced by softwarebased solutions. Major points of concern in the near future are the <b>standardisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>communication</b> interfaces and protocols, as well as the implementation of autonomously acting entities performing vitally important actions like controlling protective systems...|$|E
40|$|Various authors from {{countries}} {{as diverse as}} South Africa, the Netherlands, Britain and the United States of America, reported the existence of constraints in corporate communication practitioner career advancement (Moss, 2000 : 1, 6; Moss, Warnaby&Newman, 2000 : 277, 302; Plowman, 1998 : 243; Spicer, 1997 : 84; Steyn, 1999 : 21; Steyn, 2000 a: 2; Steyn, 2000 b: 70; Steyn&Puth, 2000 : 3, 7, 10, 12; Van Ruler, 1997 : 263; Visagie, 1999 : 148). Their findings have prompted this exploratory phenomenological research. The primary objective {{of this research is}} to explore some corporate communication practitioners’ perceptions of the constraints experienced in advancing to more senior corporate communication roles in the South African banking industry. The research is approached from the excellence and feminist meta-theoretical perspectives. In particular {{it is based on the}} strategic contingency theory, organisational structure theory, power-control theory, interpersonal perception theory and corporate communication roles theory. The study focuses on two concepts, namely ‘constraints’ and ‘role’. The research reflected a snapshot in time of the current communication practitioner’s emotional, relational or situational experience of their efforts to advance their careers. The aim was not to support or validate any pre-selected model or theory, but rather to embrace the constraint in a non-assumptive manner as it unfolds from the perspective of the communication practitioner experiencing it (Callahan, 2000 : 105; Scannell-Desch, 2000). From the findings of the research, one could argue that there are various individual, organisational and professional career constraints that practitioners experience in trying to advance their careers. Over and above the constraints noted in literature, the study identified a few more constraints such as organisational politics, the time spent in the organisation, the practitioner’s lack of networking and relationship building skills, lack of knowledge of overseas practice and the lack of <b>standardisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>communication</b> practitioner deliverables.

40|$|Thesis (MTech (Electrical Engineering)) [...] Cape Peninsula University of Technology, 2016. Electricity {{substation}} {{monitoring and}} control systems have evolved over the years from simple systems capable of achieving minimalistic functions to autonomous, self-healing smart grid schemes (Farhangi, 2010). The migration of technology to networked smart grid systems was driven by the need for <b>standardisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>communication</b> networks, system configuration and also the reduction of system implementation costs and engineering time. Before {{the introduction of a}} uniform communication standard, legacy (non-standardised) communication protocols, for example, the Distributed Network Protocol (DNP 3) were used by Remote Terminal Units (RTUs) for information exchange (Luwaca, 2014). These communication protocols could not provide a standard naming convention or data semantics since the data/information was accessed using an address-based system. The implementation of automation systems based on legacy protocols and RTUs was expensive because of parallel copper wiring required to connect instrument transformers and circuit breakers to multiple RTUs for protection and monitoring functions (Iloh et al., 2014). Legacy systems refer to Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems implemented using RTUs and legacy communication protocols. Legacy systems tended to be vendor specific because devices from different vendors did not support the same communication protocol. These issues led to the introduction of the IEC 61850 standard. The IEC 61850 standard for “communication networks and systems in a substation” provides standardised naming convention, data semantics, standardised device configuration and also device interoperability and interchangeability in some instances. The IEC 61850 standard provides a solution to expensive parallel copper wiring and standardisation issues experienced with legacy protocols. In as much as the introduction of the IEC 61850 standard addresses problems experienced with legacy system there is still a need to provide inexpensive access to IEC 61850 -compliant devices and effective knowledge transfer to facilitate implementation of automation systems based on this standard. The development of an IEC 61850 -compliant device requires a specialised skillset and financial investment for research and industrialisation therefore only a few vendors manufacture these devices resulting in an increase in production and manufacturing costs. For this reason this research project develops VHDL modules for mapping IEC 61850 - 9 - 2 Sampled Value (SV) messages and IEC 61850 - 8 - 1 Generic Object Oriented Substation Event (GOOSE) messages on a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) platform. Sampled values are used for transmitting current and voltage transformer (CT and VT) measurements to protection devices while GOOSE messages exchange information/commands between primary equipment (CT, VT and circuit breaker) and protection devices over an Ethernet network known as the process bus...|$|E
40|$|While group {{communication}} system {{have been proposed}} for some time, they are still not used much in actual systems.

40|$|Abstract — the {{management}} of airport ground movements {{has to deal with}} the growing complexity of coordination to accomplish tied schedules without causing safety breaches. This is particularly true at the apron area where most of safety incidents occur. Indeed apron personnel are faced with airlines requesting a shortening of turnaround times while maintaining quality of service, including compliance with safety procedures. With the advent of mobile solutions and the <b>standardisation</b> <b>of</b> wireless <b>communication</b> technologies, airports start to search for alternative solutions to monitor ground movements in a more accurate and integrated way. The adoption of mobile devices as a network of sensors, providing location-based data, creates in fact a consistent view about ongoing ground operations in the airport, enabling stakeholders to take better operational decisions based on information that is continuously updated. Such approach can improve the detection of safety hazards within the exact spatio-temporal context they occur, together with a clear identification of the intervenient personnel and resources. This paper presents the LOCON system and how it helps achieving the up mentioned goals using standard wireless communication technologies...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Intensive care units (ICUs) {{are often}} under {{pressure}} for beds. Discharging patients {{is one way}} to relieve this pressure, but there has been limited examination of the ICU discharge process as a whole. Aim: This study described the ICU patient discharge process in an Australian metropolitan hospital. Method: Semi-structured observations and interviews were undertaken to track the information flows and decision making processes associated with ICU patient discharges. Written policies and other documents were analysed to determine critical information flows. Data triangulation techniques were used to enhance the rigour of the findings. Ethics approval was obtained and all participants gave written consent. Results: A total of 17 days with 8 – 14 h/day were spent in the field and 56 interviews were undertaken. Routine {{played a major role in}} the functionality of the ICU. The style and comprehensiveness of the medical handovers varied according to the on duty consultant’s preferences. ICU patient discharge decisions were made by ICU consultants, however, how these decisions were arrived at was not understood by all medical staff. Further, when nurses provided handover to the ward staff, the information was often lost in transition. Nursing documentation lacked clarity. There were conflicting objectives across departments. Conclusion: The results suggested that clarification <b>of</b> guidelines and <b>standardisation</b> <b>of</b> vital <b>communication,</b> such as medical handover, discharge decision making, documentation, and nursing handover from ICU to ward, are needed. Promoting shared objectives in discharging patients across departments, and reinforcement of using information technology are recommended to manage patient flow more efficiently. ...|$|R

40|$|SUMMARY In a {{trial of}} the Netherlands coupled external/internal quality control program a control serum and an enzyme {{standard}} were analysed {{over a period of}} eight weeks, five times each week. Five enzymes were determined: alkaline phosphatase, creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, alanine aminotransferase, and Y-glutamyltransferase. The measured values in the serum were converted to the standards. Those laboratories using the recommended methods also submitted their non-transformed serum values. The following standardisation techniques have been compared: (a) no <b>standardisation</b> <b>of</b> methodo-logy but use of enzyme standards; (b) <b>standardisation</b> <b>of</b> methodology; (c) <b>standardisation</b> <b>of</b> methodology combined with use of an enzyme standard. Results were submitted to analysis <b>of</b> variance. <b>Standardisation</b> <b>of</b> methodology did not yield smaller interlaboratory variation than the standardisation with enzyme standards. In this trial a combination <b>of</b> both <b>standardisation</b> techniques yielded generally better results. Results for y-glutamyltransferase indicate that stan-dardisation of substrate may be necessary apart from the use of an enzyme standard. The preparation of stable enzyme standards is stressed. The efforts to reduce interlaboratory variance of stated by Lott that 'enzyme standards may be serum enzyme measurements concentrate (mainly) utopian. but some start must be made towards on the <b>standardisation</b> <b>of</b> analytical rnethodology. l: " enzyme preparation for all clinically importan...|$|R
