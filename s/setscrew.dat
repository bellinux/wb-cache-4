5000|$|To {{ensure a}} ready mixture, the {{carburetor}} has a [...] "float chamber" [...] (or [...] "bowl") {{that contains a}} quantity of fuel at near-atmospheric pressure, ready for use. This reservoir is constantly replenished with fuel supplied by a fuel pump. The correct fuel level in the bowl is maintained {{by means of a}} float controlling an inlet valve, in a manner very similar to that employed in a cistern (e.g. a toilet tank). As fuel is used up, the float drops, opening the inlet valve and admitting fuel. As the fuel level rises, the float rises and closes the inlet valve. The level of fuel maintained in the float bowl can usually be adjusted, whether by a <b>setscrew</b> or by something crude such as bending the arm to which the float is connected. This is usually a critical adjustment, and the proper adjustment is indicated by lines inscribed into a window on the float bowl, or a measurement of how far the float hangs below the top of the carburetor when disassembled, or similar. Floats can be made of different materials, such as sheet brass soldered into a hollow shape, or of plastic; hollow floats can spring small leaks and plastic floats can eventually become porous and lose their flotation; in either case the float will fail to float, fuel level will be too high, and the engine will not run unless the float is replaced. The valve itself becomes worn on its sides by its motion in its [...] "seat" [...] and will eventually try to close at an angle, and thus fails to shut off the fuel completely; again, this will cause excessive fuel flow and poor engine operation. Conversely, as the fuel evaporates from the float bowl, it leaves sediment, residue, and varnishes behind, which clog the passages and can interfere with the float operation. This is particularly a problem in automobiles operated for only part of the year and left to stand with full float chambers for months at a time; commercial fuel stabilizer additives are available that reduce this problem.|$|E

40|$|In era of {{exploding}} {{energy consumption}} and thus equipment operating cost {{as well as}} the parallel environmental need to reduce the carbon footprint, energy efficient mobile radio is a very important issue and future challenge. Additionally, increased number of standards, frequency bands and applications require flexible and sustainable solutions.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{evaluate}} the structural properties of femur-patellar tendon graft complex in anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction using different femoral fixation devices. Type of study is biomechanical testing. An ACL reconstruction was performed on 40 cadaver porcine knees, using patellar tendon (PT) graft. Specimens were divided into four groups according to the femoral fixation: interference absorbable screw (Group A), metallic <b>setscrew</b> (Group B), absorbable pins (Group C), and a combination of metallic <b>setscrew</b> and pin (Group D). Other ten knees were used as controls. On each sample, a cyclic loading test, then a load-to-failure test were performed. Elongation after 1, 000 loading cycles, ultimate failure load, yield load, stiffness, deformation at the yield point, and mode of failure were recorded. Kruskal-Wallis test and Tukey test were used to compare the differences between groups. The lowest mean elongation after 1, 000 load cycles was observed for Group B (1. 7 +/- 1. 4 mm) and D (1. 2 +/- 0. 3 mm). Ultimate failure load of Group D (1, 021. 8 +/- 199. 4 N) was comparable with that of normal ACL (1, 091. 2 +/- 193. 3 N) and PT graft (1, 140. 6 +/- 285. 7 N). All other groups were lower than the controls. For mean stiffness, all the groups, excepting for Group D (172. 8 +/- 40. 4 N/mm), were significantly lower than PT control group (216 +/- 78. 4 N/mm). Mode of failure was graft pullout for Groups A and B, distal pin breakage for Group C, and midsubstance graft rupture in 80 % of the cases for Group D. Only combined compression and suspension fixation did not show significantly different structural properties in comparison with normal ACL and PT graft. Furthermore, it showed no risk of graft pullout or hardware breakdown in comparison with other fixation devices...|$|E
40|$|As is {{the case}} for {{traditional}} goods, information providers must consider which product they want to offer to their customers at what price. Product policy, i. e. the presentation of the service offer (Meffert, 2005, 327), and pricing policy (Diller, 2008, 21 et seq.) are two of the central <b>setscrews</b> in a company’s marketing mix. The close connection of these two entrepreneurial action parameters becomes clear in the economical price definition (Diller, 2008, 31), in which the price is represented as a quotient of remuneration and scope of services. This exemplifies on the one hand that the customer always considers the relation between the re-muneration for and service of an offer. In this sense, prices can only be too high when the corresponding service is inadequate. On the other hand, the quotient makes the diametrically opposed interests of suppliers and customer very clear. Suppliers are interested in a particularly high price quotient, customers in a par-ticularly low one. Here, too, the context of our considerations will allow us only the mention of product and pricing policy’s particularities as relevant for information providers...|$|R
40|$|International audienceFatty acid desaturases are {{metabolic}} <b>setscrews.</b> To study their {{systemic impact}} on growth in Drosophila melanogaster, we inhibited fatty acid desaturases using the inhibitor CAY 10566. As expected, {{the amount of}} desaturated lipids is reduced in larvae fed with CAY 10566. These animals cease feeding soon after hatching, and their growth is strongly attenuated. A starvation program is not launched, but the expression of distinct metabolic genes is activated, possibly to mobilize storage material. Without attaining the normal size, inhibitor-fed larvae molt to the next stage indicating that the steroid hormone ecdysone triggers molting correctly. Nevertheless, after molting, expression of ecdysone-dependent regulators is not induced. While control larvae molt a second time, these larvae fail {{to do so and}} die after few days of straying. These effects are similar to those observed in experiments using larvae deficient for the fatty acid desaturase 1 gene. Based on these data, we propose that the ratio of saturated to unsaturated fatty acids adjusts a sensor system that directs feeding behavior. We also hypothesize that loss of fatty acid desaturase activity leads to a block of the genetic program of development progression indirectly by switching on a metabolic compensation program.

5000|$|A natural mineral crystal {{forms the}} {{semiconductor}} {{side of the}} junction. The most common crystal used was galena (PbS, lead sulfide), a naturally occurring ore of lead, although many other minerals were also used including silicon, iron pyrite, molybdenite and carborundum. [...] Galena is a semiconductor with a small bandgap of about 0.4 eV and is used without treatment directly as it is mined. However, not all galena crystals would function in a detector; galena with good detecting properties was rare and had no reliable visual characteristics distinguishing it from galena samples with poor detecting properties. A rough pebble of detecting mineral {{about the size of}} a pea was mounted in a metal cup, which formed one side of the circuit. The electrical contact between the cup and the crystal had to be good, because this contact must not act as a second rectifying junction, which would prevent the device from functioning. To make good contact with the crystal, it was either clamped with <b>setscrews</b> or mounted in solder. Because the relatively high melting temperature of tin-lead solder can damage many crystals, a low-melting-point (well under 200 F) alloy such as Wood's metal was used. One surface was left exposed to allow contact with the cat's-whisker wire.|$|R
40|$|For {{a variety}} of applications, it is {{important}} to measure the sensitivity of the pointing of a beam emerging from a collimator, as a function of temperature changes. A straightforward method for carrying out this measurement is based on using interferometry for monitoring the changes in beam pointing, which presents its own problems. The added temperature dependence and complexity issues relating to using an interferometer are addressed by not using an interferometer in the first place. Instead, the collimator is made part of an arrangement that uses a minimum number of low-cost, off-the-shelf materials and by using a quad diode to measure changes in beam pointing. In order to minimize the influence of the test arrangement on the outcome of the measurement, several steps are taken. The collimator assembly is placed on top of a vertical, 1 -m-long, fused silica tube. The quad diode is bonded to a fused silica bar, which, in turn, is bonded to {{the lower end of the}} fused silica tube. The lower end of the tube rests on a self-aligning support piece, while the upper end of the tube is kept against two rounded <b>setscrew</b> tips, using a soft rubber string. This ensures that very little stress is applied to the tube as the support structure changes dimensions due to thermal expansion. Light is delivered to the collimator through a bare fiber in order to minimize variable bending torque caused by a randomly relaxing, rigid fiber jacket. In order to separate the effect of temperature on the collimator assembly from the effect temperature has on the rest of the setup, multiple measurements are taken with the collimator assembly rotated from measurement to measurement. Laboratory testing, with 1 -m spacing between the collimator and the quad diode, has shown that the sensitivity of the arrangement is better than 100 nm rms, over time spans of at least one hour, if the beam path is protected from atmospheric turbulence by a tube. The equivalent sensitivity to detecting changes in pointing angle is 100 nanoradians...|$|E
40|$|Since {{their market}} {{introduction}} in 1995, fiber Bragg gratings (FBGs) {{have emerged as}} excellent means of measuring such parameters as strain and temperature. Distributed-grating sensing is particularly beneficial for such structural-health monitoring applications {{such as those of}} 'smart' structures or integrated vehicle health management in aerospace vehicles. Because of the variability of their output wavelengths, tunable lasers have become widely used as means of measuring FBGs. Several versions of a lightweight assembly for strain-tuning an FBG and dampening its vibrations have been constructed. The main components of such an assembly are one or more piezoelectric actuators, an optical fiber containing one or more Bragg grating(s), a Bragg-grating strain-measurement system, and a voltage source for actuation. The piezoelectric actuators are, more specifically, piezoceramic fiber composite actuators and, can be, still more specifically, of a type known in the art as macro-fiber composite (MFC) actuators. In fabrication of one version of the assembly, the optical fiber containing the Bragg grating(s) is sandwiched between the piezoelectric actuators along with an epoxy that is used to bond the optical fiber to both actuators, then the assembly is placed in a vacuum bag and kept there until the epoxy is cured. Bonding an FBG directly into an MFC actuator greatly reduces the complexity, relative to assemblies, that include piezoceramic fiber composite actuators, hinges, ferrules, and clamp blocks with <b>setscrews.</b> Unlike curved actuators, MFC actuators are used in a flat configuration and are less bulky. In addition, the MFC offers some vibration dampening and support for the optical fiber whereas, in a curved piezoelectric actuator assembly, the optical fiber is exposed, and there is nothing to keep the exposed portion from vibrating...|$|R
40|$|A brass block., 3. 7 mm {{high and}} 10 mm in diameter, which has three {{openings}} to accommodate rivet-type or plain tubular specimen holders for {{scanning electron microscopy}} at low temperature, {{has been designed to}} fit the Hexland Cryotrans CT 1000 assembly in place of the original aluminum disc. Viscous food samples are placed in two-piece tubular holders (0. 9 mm inner diameter, 1. 2 mm outer diameter) made from sterling silver, and rapidly frozen. The holders are inserted into the brass block under 1 iquid nitrogen and tightened with individual <b>setscrews.</b> A handle screwed into the central hole of the block facilitates manipulation of the block. The samples are fractured inside the Cryotrans CT 1000 assembly by knocking off the part of the sample located in the upper tube. The subsequent operations are the same as those suggested by Hexland. A second simple type of holder has been developed for low-moisture foods, such as cheese, which are resistant to ice crystal formation during freezing. This holder consists of a Hexland aluminum sample disc drilled with a single opening (4. 0 mm in diameter) temporarily closed at the bottom with sticky tape. The food is sampled with a cork borer and the sample plug is then inserted into the 4. 0 rrm opening, with a rivet covering the part of the sample protruding from the disc. Thermal contact between the sample, the disc, and a rivet that is used to cover the part of the sample protruding from the disc, is provided by Tissue Tek. The sample with the disc is rapidly frozen in nitrogen slush, mounted in the Hexland Cryotrans CT 1000 assembly, and inserted into the prechamber of the cold stage attachment where the rivet is knocked off. From that point on, the regular procedure recommended by Hexland is followed...|$|R
40|$|Tutorialpg. 121 - 138 In {{rotating}} equipment, torque {{is usually}} transmitted from shafts to coupling hubs through keys, splines, friction, {{or a combination}} of these. Not covered in this tutorial are applications where the rotating equipment has integral flanges that bolt to the coupling. The type of interface, the fit, and materials used are dependent on the criticality of the equipment. Equipment can be classified into general purpose and special purpose. General purpose equipment includes machines such as pumps that are spared. If they fail or require maintenance the operation does not shut down or slow down. In contrast special purpose equipment (compressor, generator) is critical to the process and if it is unavailable the entire plant might slow down, shut down, or might incur a safety incident or environmental incidence. Generally special purpose equipment and more sophistication is justified {{in the design of the}} interface. The type of interface has also a lot to do with several other issues, including: ?	Ease of assembly/disassembly ?	Reliability of connection ?	How much torque can be transmitted ?	Field conditions Most commonly for general purpose equipment keys with <b>setscrews</b> are used on a small horsepower applications. For larger horsepower applications keys with interference bores are common. For critical equipment the most common interface is keys with interference. As the application gets more critical and power dense, keyless shrink drives and integral flanges become common. Tight fitted splines are common in aircraft derivative gas turbines. The various types are covered in some detail for general purpose and special purpose applications. Covered also is how to assemble some of the most common types. Other issues such as who should bore the couplings, how does one fit bores and keys, and what needs to be considered when specifying interfaces is discussed. They types of couplings that are used on general purpose applications versus special purpose applications are discussed first...|$|R
40|$|A simple, easy-to-use {{optoelectronic}} tool projects scale marks {{that become}} incorporated into photographic images (including film and electronic images). The sizes of objects {{depicted in the}} images can readily be measured by reference to the scale marks. The {{role played by the}} scale marks projected by this tool is {{the same as that of}} the scale marks on a ruler placed in a scene for the purpose of establishing a length scale. However, this tool offers the advantage that it can put scale marks quickly and safely in any visible location, including a location in which placement of a ruler would be difficult, unsafe, or time-consuming. The tool (see Figure 1) includes an aluminum housing, within which are mounted four laser diodes that operate at a wavelength of 670 nm. The laser diodes are spaced 1 in. (2. 54 cm) apart along a baseline. The laser diodes are mounted with <b>setscrews,</b> which are used to adjust their beams to make them all parallel to each other and perpendicular to the baseline. During the adjustment process, the effect of the adjustments is observed by measuring the positions of the laser-beam spots on a target 80 ft (approx. 24 m) away. Once the adjustments have been completed, the laser beams define three 1 -in. (2. 54 -cm) intervals and the location of each beam is defined to within 1 / 16 in. (approx. 1. 6 mm) at any target distance out to about 80 ft (approx. 24 m). The distance between the laser-beam spots as seen in an image is strictly defined only along an axis parallel to the baseline and perpendicular to the laser beam (also perpendicular to the line of sight of the camera, assuming that the camera-to-target distance is much greater than the distance between the tool and the camera lens). If a flat target surface illuminated by the laser beams is tilted with respect to the aforesaid axis, then the distance along the target surface between scale marks is proportional to the secant of the tilt angle. If one knows the tilt angle, one can correct for it. Even if one does not know the tilt angle precisely, it may not matter: For example, at a tilt of 10, the secant is approximately 1. 0154, so that the tilt error is only about 1. 54 percent, which is negligibly small for a typical application in which only approximate measurements are needed...|$|R
