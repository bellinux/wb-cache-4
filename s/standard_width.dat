25|$|Trouser width has varied {{considerably}} {{throughout the}} decades. In the 1920s, trousers were straight-legged and wide-legged, with a <b>standard</b> <b>width</b> at the cuff of 23inches. After 1935, trousers {{began to be}} tapered in at {{the bottom half of}} the leg. Trousers remained wide at the top of the leg throughout the 1940s. By the 1950s and 1960s, a more slim look had become popular. In the 1970s, suit makers offered a variety of styles of trousers, including flared, bell bottomed, wide-legged, and more traditional tapered trousers. In the 1980s these styles disappeared in favour of tapered, slim-legged trousers.|$|E
25|$|Shoe size is an {{alphanumerical}} {{indication of}} the fitting size of a shoe for a person. Often it just consists of a number indicating the length because many shoemakers only provide a <b>standard</b> <b>width</b> for economic reasons. There are several different shoe-size systems that are used worldwide. These systems differ in what they measure, what unit of measurement they use, and where the size 0 (or 1) is positioned. Only a few systems also take {{the width of the}} feet into account. Some regions use different shoe-size systems for different types of shoes (e.g., men's, women's, children's, sport, or safety shoes).|$|E

25|$|Panels. Panels are {{sheets of}} pre-profiled copper with lengths up to 4–5meters and <b>standard</b> <b>widths</b> up to 500mm. They are two-sided {{cladding}} elements {{that can be}} with or without an end base. Assembly is performed using the tongue and groove principle or by overlapping. Panels can be assembled vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. There are three basic forms: tongue and groove panels laid vertically as level surface facade cladding; tongue and groove panels laid horizontally as level surface facade cladding; and custom panels laid in different directions with visible or masked fastening, flush against the surface or overlapping. Links to representative photographs of golden-colored and patinated-green panels are available.|$|R

The highway heads through the remainder of the exit, passing over the left exit ramp from I-490 west to I-390 south heading northbound and under the ramp linking I-490 east to NY390 north southbound and crossing over I-490 westbound. North of the junction, the median narrows to a more <b>standard</b> <b>width</b> as NY390 widens to six lanes and connects to NY31 (Lyell Avenue).

2500|$|The {{road network}} {{was a popular}} {{addition}} to the park because it opened the valley to scenic carriage and automobile rides in most seasons, particularly south of Military Road. Opening the park to vehicular traffic provided increased public access {{on both sides of}} Rock Creek Park. The present road system continues to reflect their original purpose of providing public access to the enjoyment of extraordinary rural scenery. A comparison of a 1918 Olmsted Plan Map, a National Park Service annotated version of that base map prepared in 1941 indicating road conditions in the park, and a modern topography map prepared in 1989, illustrated that the alignment and width of the roads has not changed significantly since 1941. Similarly a comparison of a 1933 map of Rock Creek's facilities reveals that the reservation has retained a high degree of its historic integrity. Although adapted to the automobile, the designed alignment, width and the environmental surroundings of these scenic roads has not substantially changed since the 1920s. According to the 1985 Rock Creek management plan, the road system is [...] long and the <b>standard</b> <b>width</b> of roadway is [...] A major non-historic addition to the trail system of the park was the paving of bicycle routes in the 1960s and 1970s.|$|E

A variety of different cutting machines is available, hierarchical cuts may be necessary to produce small widths. The mill is capable of producing custom [...] made coils within certain bounds but there is a declared preference for <b>standard</b> <b>widths.</b> The task is to group the orders into coils which can be produced by the mill and slit by the machines.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the cut {{of a set of}} {{rectangular}} pieces, requested in large quantities and obtained with oriented guillotine cuts from a set of long rolls of material with <b>standard</b> <b>widths</b> in a way that minimises the total waste. For this class of problems, a heuristic based on three steps has been developed. First, an enumeration of all feasible non dominated patterns of the different widths with a pattern-generation procedure aims at constructing the constraints matrix. Second, a relaxation of the constraints of our problem is performed to obtain a linear formulation. Third a solution to the basic problem is generated through the solution of the associated problem with relaxed constraints. An example has been used to illustrate and clarify each step. The effectiveness of the algorithm has been tested by a set of random instances...|$|R
