5|$|Since June 2011, the E751 {{comprises}} the Croatian A8 and A9 tolled motorways of the Istrian Y. The tolls there {{are based on}} the vehicle classification in Croatia using a closed-toll system. Tolls charged along the A9 motorway toll plazas vary depending on the length of route traveled and range from 3.00 kuna (€0.40) to 26.00 kuna (€3.51) for passenger cars and 15.00 kuna (€2.02) to 185.00 kuna (€25.00) for semi-trailer trucks. Although A8 also employs a ticket system, usage of the road is free except for vehicles traversing the Učka Tunnel and the KanfanarRogovići section. A user of {{the entire length of the}} A8 is charged 36.00 kuna (€4.86) for passenger cars or up to 205.00 kuna (€27.70) for <b>semi-trailers,</b> depending on vehicle classification in Croatia. Ticket systems employed by the A9 and the A8 are unified; tolls are not charged when switching between the two roads. The toll is payable in either Croatian kuna or euros using major credit cards, debit cards and a number of prepaid toll collection systems. The latter includes various types of smart cards issued by the motorway operator and ENC, an electronic toll collection (ETC) system which is used by most motorways in Croatia and provides drivers with discounted toll rates for dedicated lanes at toll plazas.|$|E

5|$|Throughout {{the one and}} a {{half months}} after the start of ground tests, HB1001, the first of two demonstrators, {{underwent}} tests in preparations for the first flight. Flight instrumentation was checked first, followed by a thorough shakedown of the aircraft. In early November, two <b>semi-trailers</b> were parked parallel to each other outside Building 82; a camouflage net was thrown over the top to cover the demonstrator during outdoor engine runs. During the engine tests, a local resident complained about the noise, but Have Blue retained its secrecy. HB1001 received a layer of iron-coat paint; during the weekend of 12–13 November, the aircraft received a camouflage scheme devised by Alan Brown, Have Blues chief technical engineer. The scheme, consisting of three colors, each with three tones, was used to deceive any casual onlooker from recognizing the design's characteristic faceting. The aircraft was disassembled and loaded onto a C-5– on 16November, the aircraft was flown from Burbank Airport (since renamed Bob Hope Airport) to Area 51 at Groom Lake, Nevada. Upon touchdown, the aircraft was reassembled before undergoing another round of testing prior to the first flight. After four taxi tests, HB1001 was ready for test flights.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{presents}} the assumptions made and solutions {{used in a}} newly designed low-bed <b>semi-trailer</b> for the transportation of heavy and oversized loads, especially heavy self-propelled road machinery. During the design phase, special {{attention was paid to}} the versatility of the <b>semi-trailer.</b> The <b>semi-trailer</b> consists of 4 main modules: a hydraulic removable gooseneck allowing for coupling the <b>semi-trailer</b> to a tractor unit, an extendable low bed, a 2 -axle bogie and a 3 -axle bogie. The modules can be combined in different ways to create different configurations of the <b>semi-trailer.</b> Owing to that, the carrying capacity of the <b>semi-trailer</b> can be easily matched to the equipment carried. Depending on the current needs, the <b>semi-trailer</b> can have 2, 3 or 5 axles, a payload from 28 to 65 tons, and a length from 13. 2 to 20. 1 m. Wheeled and caterpillar vehicles can drive onto the lowbed from the front, after the gooseneck has been detached. The length and width of the bed can be adjusted within the range of 2 and 0. 6 m, respectively. An important advantage of this <b>semi-trailer</b> is the fact that in a 2 -axle configuration it meets the regulations for standard trailers and can be driven in public roads and carry normal loads without a special permission. Thanks to the fact that all its wheels are steered and controlled by a hydraulic steering system, the <b>semi-trailer</b> has very good manoeuvrability despite its long length. The <b>semi-trailer</b> meets rigorous safety demands – it is equipped with...|$|R

The precast concrete parts are transported using flatbed <b>semi-trailers</b> to the sites. The structural floor modules may need to be laid tilted during the transportation in order to cover as large floor area as possible while they can be easily transported on the roadways. The modules are lifted using precast concrete lifting anchor systems at the sites for assembly.

500|$|The tornado {{maintained}} EF2 intensity as {{it quickly}} tracked across the Mississippi [...] Tennessee state line and into southeastern portions of Memphis, where WREG tower cameras broadcast live {{footage of the}} tornado moving through the southeastern parts of Memphis, producing multiple bright blue power flashes along the way. By this point, the National Weather Service issued a Tornado Emergency (the first of five to be issued during the outbreak) {{for most of the}} Memphis metropolitan area. The tornado produced an extensive swath of damage as it moved through residential and commercial areas. Considerable damage was reported at Memphis International Airport, where a hangar lost its roof, the FedEx freight terminal's fire station suffered roof damage, airstair trucks were thrown 100yards (91m), and aircraft were moved around, including a Boeing 737 that was moved one foot. FedEx service was disrupted due to flight delays and closed roads, all because of the tornado damage in surrounding areas. The airport weather station's reporting equipment recorded a wind gust of 73knots (84mph, 135km/h). In the Clarke Road area, tractor trailers were tossed around, a power substation was severely damaged, and several warehouse structures sustained heavy damage. This included a DSC warehouse that was destroyed, killing three people inside. Numerous windows were shattered at the Willow Lake Business Park, and utility poles and trees were snapped in the area. Multiple homes along Maple Tree Drive and Pinbranch Court were damaged, five of which sustained major damage. The Hardy Bottling Company facility was also damaged, which released 120,000pounds (54,500kg) of anhydrous ammonia into the atmosphere, although no public health impacts were reported. Continuing northeast, the tornado weakened to EF1 strength and struck the Hickory Ridge Mall, resulting in total collapse of a large wall and much of the roof at the Sears department store. Damage surveyors noted very poor construction at this location, and six people in the mall were injured. Cars and <b>semi-trailers</b> near the mall were flipped and damaged as well. A Taco Bell and a few other businesses were damaged along Winchester Road before the tornado dissipated. Numerous trees and power poles were snapped along much of the tornado's path through Southaven and Memphis, and electricity supply to about 65,000 customers was briefly cut.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Handling {{behaviour}} of articulated vehicles {{combination is}} more complex and less predictable than that of non-articulated vehicles. It is usually difficult for drivers to maneuver a tractor <b>semi-trailer</b> during high speed emergency braking on split-mu road surface. Braking on this type of road surface, the conventional anti-lock braking systems will cause the vehicle deviate from the desired direction, or overmuch stopping distance. In this paper, a 3 -dof of tractor <b>semi-trailer</b> model was used to produce desired yaw rates which were compared with actual yaw rates. An active front steering control and four-channel ABS were integrated to improve the tractor <b>semi-trailer</b> lateral stability while braking on split-mu road surface, which will produce maximum braking force. A full function tractor <b>semi-trailer</b> model was built and assembled in multi-body dynamics software, and the dynamic analysis was performed on split-mu road surface.
