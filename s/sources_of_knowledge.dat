However, Jennifer Lackey has presented some counterexamples which show that one can actually come to know something through testimony {{that no one ever}} knew before. Yet, the intuitive idea can be preserved by the weaker claim that someone in a knowledge-constituting testimonial chain has to have access to some non-testimonial <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>knowledge</b> with regard to what is testified.

Pulakeshin II (610–642) is also said to have conquered Chera, Pandya and Chola kingdoms. Soon the three rulers made an alliance and marched against the Chalukyas.

25|$|The idea of {{holistic}} planned grazing {{began in}} the 1960s when Allan Savory, a wildlife biologist in his native Southern Rhodesia, set out to understand desertification. This {{can be seen in}} the context of the larger environmental movement. Heavily influenced by the work of André Voisin and the ineffectiveness of mainstream rangeland science of the time, Savory concluded that the spread of deserts, the loss of wildlife, and the human impoverishment that always resulted were related to the reduction of the natural herds of large grazers and even more, the change in behavior of those few remaining herds. Livestock could be substituted to provide important ecosystem services like nutrient cycling when mimicking those uniquely coevolved grasses and grazers. But managers had found that while rotational grazing systems can work for diverse management purposes, scientific experiments had demonstrated that they do not necessarily work for specific ecological purposes. An adaptive management plan was needed for the integration of the experiential with the experimental, as well as the social with the biophysical, to provide a more comprehensive framework for the management of rangeland systems. None of these <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>knowledge</b> could be understood except in the context of the whole. Holistic management was developed to meet that need.|$|E

40|$|For {{hundreds}} of years following the appearance of Dharmakīrti’s sattvānumāna i. e., the inference of momentariness from the existence of things, his successors were challenged to carefully analyze his argument. They did so by identifying its various parts and defending their formulation {{from a variety of}} opponents. Dharmottara is one such successor of Dharmakīrti. This paper focuses on Dharmottara’s contribution to the discussion of the inferential reason—existence (sattva) —and his attempts at resolving problems with it. In his Kṣaṇabhaṅgasiddhi and Pramāṇaviniścayaṭīkā, Dhamottara introduces and then argues against the view of his opponents that the inferential reason, ‘existence,’ is a pseudoreason. According to his opponents: 1) If this inferential reason were established by a <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>knowledge</b> (pramāṇa), it would be opposed (viruddha), since, according to them, existence has to be characterized by permanence (nityatva), which is opposed to the property to be proved i. e., momentariness. They argue that when a <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>knowledge</b> is used to ascertain that something is existent (sat), it also ascertains that that thing is permanent (nitya); 2) In contrast, if this inferential reason were not established by a <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>knowledge,</b> it would be unestablished (asiddha). Thus, in both cases, the inferential reason would be a pseudo-reason, since it would either be opposed or unestablished. Dharmottara responds to these objections by explaining the functioning <b>of</b> a <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>knowledge</b> (pramāṇavyāpāra). He argues that it is not possible for the same <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>knowledge</b> to be used to make two different judgments (adhyavasāya). This is because making a judgment can only consist in a single exclusion (ekavyāvr tti). Suppose that a <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>knowledge</b> e. g., perception is used to judge that something is existent. This <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>knowledge</b> leads to this judgment by excluding that thing from whatever is non-existent (asat) —that is, from things that do not fulfill a specific purpose (anarthakriyā) for the perceiver. The functioning <b>of</b> this <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>knowledge</b> is said {{to come to an end}} with this exclusion. Thus, it is impossible for this <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>knowledge,</b> which has already been used to judge, through exclusion, that something is existent, to itself generate the further judgment that this same thing is permanent. In his overall argument, Dharmottara explains the role that perception plays in ascertaining the existence of a thing, which then serves as the inferential reason from which a thing’s momentariness is inferred. In the intellectual history of the Buddhist logico-epistemological tradition, Dharmottara’s explanation appears to be influential. For example, it seems to have influenced Jñānaśrīmitra when he discusses the issue of how to establish the “inferential reason in the site of the inference (pakṣadharmatā) ” for the sattvānumāna. In concluding this paper, I explore Dharmottara’s influence on this aspect of Jñānaśrīmitra’s discussion...|$|R
