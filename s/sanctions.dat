5|$|In May 1998, the United States enacted <b>sanctions</b> upon India {{as a part}} of the {{international}} response to a series of nuclear weapons tests by India. , these <b>sanctions</b> effectively grounded India's Sea Kings because India could not purchase any US-supplied spare parts for the fleet. Westland also complied with the <b>sanctions</b> by refusing to maintain any US-made components. A limited number of Sea Kings were kept operational by cannibalising other aircraft and the manufacture of some components by Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL). In December 2000, President Bill Clinton permitted a relaxation of the <b>sanctions.</b> In the late 2000s, HAL and AgustaWestland signed an agreement to jointly maintain and perform upgrades to India's fleet of Sea Kings.|$|E

5|$|The {{decision}} came at {{a delicate}} time for relations between Iran and Western nations, which were removing <b>sanctions</b> on Iran after its compliance with an agreement for curtailing development of its nuclear enrichment program. The agreement stipulated that once Iranian compliance with {{the terms of the}} agreement was verified, most <b>sanctions</b> against Iran would be lifted, including all <b>sanctions</b> imposed by the United Nations Security Council as well as nuclear-related European Union and U.S. sanctions; U.S. <b>sanctions</b> against Iran for terrorism, human rights abuses, and ballistic missiles would not be affected. In mid-January 2016, most <b>sanctions</b> were lifted. In March, the District Court for the Southern District of New York found, by default, that Iran had provided support to certain terrorist groups and individuals responsible for the September 11 attacks and awarded $10.5billion in damages to the plaintiffs, which consisted of $3billion to reimburse insurance companies for paid claims and $7.5billion for victims and their families ($2million for pain and suffering and $6.88million in punitive damages per victim). The same judge ruled just six months earlier that there was insufficient evidence linking Saudi Arabia—which has sour relations with Iran—to the 9/11 attacks to overcome, under the terrorism exemption, Saudi Arabia's immunity under the FSIA.|$|E

5|$|Most churches {{used two}} acts to {{sanction}} its members: censure and excommunication. Censure was a formal reprimand for behavior {{that did not}} conform with accepted religious and social norms, while excommunication involved full removal from church membership. Many perceived social evils, from fornication to public drunkenness, were dealt with through church discipline rather than through civil punishment. Church <b>sanctions</b> seldom held official recognition outside church membership and seldom resulted in civil or criminal proceedings. Nevertheless, such <b>sanctions</b> were a powerful tool of social control.|$|E

40|$|<b>Sanctioned</b> supervision, {{sometimes}} referred to as mandated supervision or professional monitoring, is intended to protect the public, reduce further counselor ethical/legal violations, and improve the professional practice of the counselor adjudicated for unprofessional behavior. <b>Sanctioned</b> supervision is a common remediation intervention required by state regulatory boards.

A qualitative research approach was used to better understand the experiences of four supervisors who provided <b>sanctioned</b> supervision within the past year as part of a state regulatory board remediation process. The main themes from the qualitative study included the following: supervisors finding the supervision process to be unique from traditional supervision, and supervisors experiencing ambivalence about the <b>sanctioned</b> supervision process.
