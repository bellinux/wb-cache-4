40|$|Abstract — Fly ash or {{pulverized}} fuel ash is {{the residue of}} the combustion of finely ground coal used in thermal power plants. It is removed by the dust collection system as fine particle residue from the flue gases before they are discharged into the atmosphere. Use of Fly ash in concrete will not only {{solve the problem of}} disposal, but will also reduce the consumption of cement, which is a material whose production is energy intensive. Fly ash concrete has found extensive application in mass concrete, pre-cast concrete, concrete used for pavements, structural concrete and roller compacted concrete with the added advantages of increased workability, impermeability, resistance to chemical attack and increased durability in comparison to ordinary Portland cement concrete. Hence, this paper present the investigation of comparison between the flexural behavior of reinforced Fly ash concrete beams with that of reinforced normal concrete beams and increase the confidence levels of designers and other beneficiaries in using reinforced Fly ash concrete as a structural material. The flexural behavior of reinforced Fly ash concrete beams with different cement replacement levels (20 %, 35 % and 50 %) are compared with reinforced normal concrete beams (without containing Fly ash) under similar conditions. All the beams are reinforced as balanced <b>sections,</b> <b>cured</b> and tested at 28 days. These investigations were conducted with three grades of concrete i. e. M 30, M 40 and M 50. The flexural behaviour of these beams is discussed in terms of its cracking load and ultimate load carrying capacity.

Application of carbon nanotubes to the composite interfaces was then accomplished through two-step curing, using acetone as a dispersant. Mode II testing indicated significant improvement of the interface fracture toughness for both carbon fiber and glass fiber samples with carbon nanotubes. Because carbon nanotubes have very high electrical conductivity, the electrical resistance was measured across the interface during Mode II loading. As the interface crack grew, there was an increase in electrical resistance (approximately linear for carbon fiber specimens until final failure).

[...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Aerospace EngineeringThe cure-induced {{residual}} stresses {{in the vicinity}} of the free edge of an open hole in IM 7 / 977 - 2 carbon/epoxy laminates have been investigated. Holes in laminated structures are intended for fastener joints, access ports and as an equivalent damage size for damage tolerance evaluations. The hole in the laminate is commonly produced post cure by either drilling or grinding operations. Due to the residual thermo-mechanical and chemical strains in the laminate, a self-equilibrating free edge and in-plane stress field is generated upon drilling the hole. Use of strain gages is limited to measurement relative to the fully cured state and cannot accurately capture the strain gradients. Thus, this study was carried out using finite element model of an open-hole tension configuration. The finite element models were developed for 16 - ply unidirectional tape IM 7 / 977 - 2 [04 / 904]S and [0 / 90 / 45 /- 45] 2 S laminates. The simulations were used to highlight the in-plane and through- thickness stresses along critical <b>sections</b> resulting from <b>cure</b> induced mechanisms. The results indicated significant interlaminar stresses {{in the vicinity of}} the hole due to curing.

Previous {{studies have shown that}} Matricaria recutita L. have a series of physiological effects; for example spasmolytic, carminative, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory. In the present study, the effect of this herbal aqueous extract on a model of acute experimental colitis was evaluated. Methods: Experiments were performed on 5 groups (N= 7) of male NMRI rats (230 - 280 g). Three groups were administered orally different doses of extract (10, 20 and 30 mg/kg), fourth group received vehicle and the last considered as control group. For induction of colitis the rats were fasted for 36 hours and then anaesthetized with ether, at the last stage 2 ml of acetic acid 4 % was instilled via the anus. After 24 hours the macroscopic study showed the colitis indices. Results: The aqueous extract of M. recutita with doses of (20 and 30 mg/kg) significantly reduced colon weight/length ratio. Extract with the highest dose (30 mg/kg) was effective to decrease as well as inflammation severity and extent.

40|$|Background: Insulinomas are {{the most}} common {{pancreatic}} neuroendocrine neoplasms. In spite of adequate pre-operative localisation, conventional surgical methods rely on intraoperative palpation. Intraoperative ultrasonography (IOUS) is said to aid in accurate localisation, decreases morbidity. Laparoscopic removal of pancreatic endocrine neoplasms is beneficial due to magnification and minimal invasion; however, in the absence of IOUS, error of judgement may lead to conversion to open surgery, thereby relying on 'palpation method' to localise the tumour. We combined laparoscopic surgical removal of insulinomas using an innovative method of 'laparoscopic finger palpation' with intraoperative blood glucose monitoring and frozen <b>section</b> for surgical <b>cure.</b> Materials and Methods: Patients were evaluated and investigated by the department of endocrinology and referred for surgical management of insulinoma. Pre-operative localisation of insulinoma was done by either contrast-enhanced computerised tomography angiogram – arterial and venous phase, or endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) or DOTATATE scan. Intraoperative localisation was done by laparoscopic dissection and 'laparoscopic finger palpation'. After enucleation, the specimen was sent for frozen section, and in the interim period, serial monitoring of blood glucose was done by the anaesthetist. Maintenance of glucose levels for more than 45 min after enucleation and confirmation of neuroendocrine tumour on frozen section was the end point of surgical procedure. Results: A total of 19 patients were subjected to laparoscopic removal of solitary insulinomas. Enucleation was performed in 16 patients successfully. In three patients, laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy was performed. Three patients had pancreatic duct leak, of which two patients responded to conservative approach and the third patient required drainage by USG-guided pigtail catheter. All patients are cured of their disease and no patient has had recurrence so far.

40|$|Excerpt] Business {{leaders are}} {{complaining}} about the declining quality of entry level workers in the U. S. They and others argue correctly that the competitiveness of American companies is threatened by the poor educational background of our frontline workers. Some have responded to these complaints by saying that business should solve its own problems by improving management and beefing up training. Public education should not, it is argued, give business needs much consideration; student and public needs should come first. And indeed there is a grain of truth in the first response, the survival of a business is almost entirely determined by factors which schools, even excellent schools, cannot change. If schools do not improve, businesses must and will adapt to {{the capabilities of the}} workers that are available. Functionally illiterate workers are less productive,so domestic companies will survive by paying lower wages. Multinational companies will survive by transferring assets and activities overseas. There is no amount of union power or government regulation that can stop this from happening. When the pie shrinks, the slices shrink as well. The losers will be American workers and all who depend on their productivity including the least fortunate among us. Yes, public and student needs must come first. It is their need for higher wages and a better standard of living which drives the need for higher standards in secondary school. Like Cassandra, employers are warning the nation that its mediocre secondary education system is a Trojan Horse which if not repaired will eventually bring the city down. The warning needs to be heeded not because employers are the daughters of a king, but because their forecast is correct and none of us can escape the city. This paper proposes a strategy for banishing the mediocrity described above and building in its place an excellent American system of secondary education. Before a cure can be prescribed, however, a diagnosis must be made. The first three sections of the paper provide the diagnosis. The fourth and fifth <b>sections</b> propose the <b>cure...</b>|$|R
40|$|Composite is a {{combination}} of two or more constituent materials, when two materials with a different properties were combined, it produces a material which has superior properties than a single material. Natural fibers can be defined as a fiber that produces by a plant or animal, which is categorized as a renewable resource. Natural fibers are commonly used as a reinforced such as hemp, jute, kenaf, and sisal. Mostly, they contribute in a lot of sectors such as an automobile, furniture, packing construction and sport. This experiment used thermoplastic (Polypropylene) as matrix and natural bamboo from a “Gigantochloa Levis” species as the fiber of the composite. The first objective of this project is to design and fabricate a bamboo composite specimen by using a Polypropylene as a matrix. The second objective is to investigate the tensile and impact properties of the composite and lastly to characterize the bamboo specimen after fracture. Firstly, the process to extract the fiber from the raw bamboo is to separate the fiber from the raw bamboo culm. There are various extraction techniques, and for this experiment, mechanical extraction technique was implemented by using the Hammer Mill machine. Based on this technique, the raw bamboo was cut into a long strip before were put into the machine, and then the bamboo strip will be grinded to produce a bundle of fiber. After a bundle of fiber extracted, the next process is to mix up the matrix and reinforcement material. This mixing process is very crucial to ensure that the composites have a good bonding. For the mixing process, composite mixed into three different compositions which are 20 % BF + 80 % PP, 30 % BF + 70 % PP and 40 % BF + 60 % PP by using Internal Brabender Mixer machine. After that, Hot Press & Cold Press technique was used to form a composite. This technique started with installing a mixed composite into a mold, and then the mold will be transferred to the hot press section. Next, the hot mold was moved to the cold press <b>section</b> for the <b>curing</b> process. This process repeated for three different compositions as mentioned before. By using this fabricating technique, the composite was formed with a dimension of 3 mm x 150 mm x 150 mm sheet shape. Finishing process was required to obtain the desired specimen by referring to the ASTM D 638 for Tensile Test and ASTM D 256 standard for the impact test. Finally, the composite was cut manually by using Vertical Band saw machine to get the requirement shape specimen for Izod Impact Test and Tensile Test. For the prepared specimens, Impact Test and Tensile Test were conducted by using INSTRON 3369 test machine and CEAST 9050 test machine, respectively. In order to characterize the bamboo specimen, the broken specimens from the tests were collected and the characteristics of the composition are observed under Video Measuring System Machine. As a conclusion, based on the collected result, the increment of the bamboo fiber composition into the composite lead to lower tensile and impact properties. This occured because the interfacial bonding of composite became weak due to less amount of bonding agent. In this experiment, the one and only bonding agent for the composite is polypropylene. Thus, when the composition of polypropylene reduces, bonding agent of composite minimize. As a consequence, the interfacial bonding of composite became weak and easily to fail when force is applied...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} {{presented in}} this thesis studies the effects of foamed bitumen on the deformational behaviour and performance of pavement materials. The research was conducted in the laboratory and the field, using specific New Zealand materials. The aggregate used {{is a blend of}} a coarse aggregate imported from the Auckland region with a crushed dust from the Canterbury region. The bitumen selected for the study is an 80 / 100 bitumen grade, and the active filler was a Portland Cement, both commonly used for foamed bitumen stabilization in New Zealand. In the laboratory, samples of mixes with different foamed bitumen content were tested under various loading and stress conditions to investigate the effects of foamed bitumen on the deformational behaviour of the mix. The tests performed were: Indirect Tensile Strength (ITS), Indirect Tensile Resilient Modulus (ITM), Repeat Load Triaxial compression (RLT) and Monotonic Load Triaxial compression (MLT). Preliminary ITS and RLT tests conducted on mixes with 1 % and 0 % cement, at different foamed bitumen contents, indicated that mixes without cement performed poorly compared to the mixes with 1 % cement. Therefore, the rest of the laboratory study was on mixes with 1 % cement. ITS tests were conducted on 150 mm specimens prepared with 0 % 1 %, 2 %, 3 % and 4 % bitumen content, with a common 1 % cement. Results indicated that foamed bitumen increases the ITS values of the mix, up to an estimated optimum of 2. 8 % bitumen content. Similar trends were obtained with ITM tests, in which a diametrical load pulse was applied on 150 mm specimens, showing an estimated resilient modulus peak near to 2. 8 % bitumen content. RLT specimens were prepared at 0 %, 2 % and 4 % bitumen content, at two compaction efforts, creating specimens at low and high bulk density. Permanent deformation RLT tests involved the application of seven stages of 50, 000 load cycles each (4 Hz), with increasing deviator stress (from 75 kPa in the first stage, up to 525 kPa in the seventh stage) and at constant confining pressure of 50 kPa. Results of RLT permanent deformation tests indicated that the increase in the foamed bitumen content resulted in an increase in the permanent deformation of the material. MLT tests were conducted on specimens at 0 %, 2 % and 4 % bitumen contents, at two compaction efforts, creating specimens of low and high bulk density, at confining pressures ranging from 50 kPa to 300 kPa, with a deformation rate of 2. 1 % per minute. Results indicated that the effect of foamed bitumen was a reduction of the peak vertical stress, or a reduction in the peak strength. The peak stresses obtained in MLT tests were plotted in stress diagrams, and the failure was approximated as linear function of the confining stress. The fundamental shear parameters (angle of internal friction and apparent cohesion) were estimated, and results indicated that foamed bitumen has no apparent effect in cohesion but does reduce the angle of internal friction. The reduction of the angle of internal friction explains the general trends observed in the laboratory, that on one hand the compressive strength decreases with increasing bitumen content, but on the other hand, the tensile strength increases up to an optimum. A full-scale experiment was carried out using an accelerated testing of foamed bitumen pavements at the Canterbury Accelerated Pavement Testing Indoor Facility (CAPTIF). In the full-scale experiments, the same materials that were tested in the laboratory (aggregates, bitumen, cement) were used to construct six different pavement sections, each with different contents of bitumen and cement. Three were constructed using foamed bitumen contents of 1. 2 %, 1. 4 % and 2. 8 % respectively, plus a common active filler content of 1. 0 % cement. Two more pavements were constructed adding cement only (1. 0 %), and foamed bitumen only (2. 2 %). In addition, one control section with the untreated unbound material was tested. Strains were collected using a 3 D Emu soil strain system installed in each pavement <b>section.</b> The <b>curing</b> time between construction and pavement loading was approximately three months. The pavement response, such as surface deformation (rutting), surface deflections and strains were periodically recorded during the execution of the test. The strains were collected at different depths by using an array of Emu strain gauges. Deflections were recorded using both a Falling Weight Deflectometer (FWD) and CAPTIF Beam deflectometer, which is a modified Benkelmann beam. A total number of approximately 5. 6 million equivalent standard axles were applied on the pavement sections. The rutting measured in the sections stabilised with foamed bitumen and cement was the lowest, showing that the addition of foamed bitumen significantly improved the performance of materials with 1 % cement. The sections stabilised with cement only, foamed bitumen only, and the control untreated section showed large amounts of rutting and heaving {{by the end of the}} test. Deflection measurements showed that the effect of foamed bitumen content is a reduction of pavement deflections, with the lowest deflection measured in the section stabilised with 2. 8 % bitumen and 1 % cement. The elastic pavement strains showed that foamed bitumen reduced the tensile strains in the basecourse but did not have a significant effect on vertical compressive strains. During the construction of pavements, material samples were taken for ITS and RLT testing. Results indicated that the highest ITS was measured in the section with 2. 8 % foamed bitumen content and 1 % cement, and the ITS in the section without cement and foamed bitumen only was about 4 - 5 times lower than the ITS measured in specimens with cement. RLT specimens without cement performed poorly in comparison with the specimens with 1 % cement. The specimens with 1 % cement showed higher permanent deformation with increase in the foamed bitumen content, supporting the results from the previous laboratory study. To interpret and relate the results observed in the laboratory and the field, stress path analysis was used, in which the stress ratio of the foamed bitumen layers was calculated at different depths. The analysis showed that foamed bitumen content decreases the maximum stress ratio, hence reducing the proximity to failure and relative damage of the layer. Three-dimensional and two-dimensional finite element modelling of the CAPTIF pavements, were used to further investigate the stress and strain fields induced by the loading and to explain the pavement performance observed in the full-scale experiment...|$|R
