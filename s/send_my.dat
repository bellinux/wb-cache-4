500|$|In an {{interview}} with 100PercentRock.com, Yamano explained that her process for writing and recording has not changed substantially from the band's early days: [...] "I’m lazy and I don’t start writing songs until we book recording studio , but once we booked the studio, I can write songs quickly with concentration. Then I <b>send</b> <b>my</b> demo to our members and we rehearse. At the recording studio, we start to record from basic tracks then overdub." [...] On this album, {{every member of the}} band also sings a unique song about a food item; Yamano sings [...] "Fortune Cookie", the band's bassist Ritsuko Taneda lends her vocals to [...] "Ramen Rock", and drummer Emi Morimoto can be heard on [...] "Green Tea". The first song was inspired by Yamano fondness for eating a fortune cookie after a meal of Chinese food in America; after learning that the cookies were actually invented in Japan, Yamano decided to pen the song. [...] "Ramen Rock" [...] was inspired by Taneda's habit of eating ramen after every show. Finally, Yamano asked Morimoto to sing [...] "Green Tea" [...] because she is from Kyoto, which is known for its green tea.|$|E
500|$|In England in {{the spring}} of 1846, she met Giuseppe Mazzini, who had been in exile there from Italy since 1837. Fuller also met the Italian revolutionary Giovanni Angelo Ossoli, a marquis who had been disinherited by his family because of his support for Mazzini. Fuller and Ossoli moved in {{together}} in Florence, Italy, likely before they were married, though whether they ever married is uncertain. Fuller was originally opposed to marrying him, {{in part because of the}} difference in their religions; she was Protestant and he was Roman Catholic. Emerson speculated that the couple was [...] "married perhaps in Oct. Nov. or Dec" [...] of 1847, though he did not explain his reasoning. Biographers have speculated that the couple married on April 4, 1848, to celebrate the anniversary of their first meeting but one biographer provided evidence they first met on April 1 during the ceremony called [...] "Lavanda degli Altari" [...] (Altars Lavage). By the time the couple moved to Florence, they were referred to as husband and wife, though it is unclear if any formal ceremony took place. It seems certain that at the time their child was born, they were not married. By New Year's Day 1848, she suspected that she was pregnant but kept it from Ossoli for several weeks. Their child, Angelo Eugene Philip Ossoli, was born in early September 1848 and nicknamed Angelino. The couple was very secretive about their relationship but, after Angelino suffered an unnamed illness, they became less so. Fuller informed her mother about Ossoli and Angelino in August 1849 in a letter that explained that she had kept silent so as not to upset her [...] "but it has become necessary, on account of the child, for us to live publicly and permanently together." [...] Her mother's response makes it clear that she was aware that the couple was not legally married. Even so, she was happy for her daughter, writing: [...] "I <b>send</b> <b>my</b> first kiss with my fervent blessing to my grandson." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "Twenty Years on the Sufferbus" [...] was the {{original}} title of what eventually became the album's title track, originally composed by Dawayne Bailey as a demo song without lyrics during Chicago's 1989 tour. According to Bailey, Lee Loughnane {{would go on to}} receive cowriting credits on the song for having promoted Bailey's demo amongst the other band members. With the key word [...] "sufferbus" [...] already having been recently used on the 1992 album Sunrise on the Sufferbus by Masters of Reality, and rejecting the lyrical draft of [...] "I'm gonna <b>send</b> <b>my</b> love to the universe", the search for a similar-sounding word ultimately also yielded an accompanying ancient mythos. Robert Lamm's early suggestion was to title the album as Resolve, in order to depart once again from the band's standard numerical nomenclature of Chicago XXII due to the band's collective idea of this album's significance.|$|E
