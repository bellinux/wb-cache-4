5|$|King Louis XV honored Franklin {{after seeing}} {{some of the}} {{electrical}} experiments done in the royal palace at <b>St.</b> <b>Germain</b> near Paris, France. However physicist Jean-Antoine Nollet (1700–1770), a skeptic who had published his own theory on electricity, declared Franklin's ideas were wrong. He claimed in 1753 that Franklin's lightning rod was not only dangerous but useless and would attract lightning bolts to wooden buildings, causing them to be hit more often. Franklin in time proved to the scientific community that his lightning rod invention not only was a protective device, but it {{also served as a}} preventive way to divert destructive lightning bolts away from hitting buildings.|$|E
5|$|The UFA {{was in an}} {{uncertain}} position when Reid became Premier; besides Brownlee's resignation, longtime Minister of Public Works Oran McPherson {{was in the midst}} of a scandalous divorce and had also left cabinet, and UFA MLAs Peter Miskew and Omer <b>St.</b> <b>Germain</b> had crossed the floor to the Liberals. Additionally, the province's economic condition remained poor. Liberal leader William R. Howson tried to take advantage of this to undermine the government and position himself as the province's next Premier; he attacked Reid relentlessly for what he alleged were spendthrift habits, and suggested the province's tax rates were causing the confiscation of family homes. Reid asserted in response that Alberta's taxes had decreased since 1921, and criticised Howson for simultaneously attacking government spending and demanding new infrastructure projects.|$|E

The boat sank lower and lower in the water as they did so, but all crossed safely.|$|E

25|$|With the {{conclusion}} of World War I, the Treaty of Versailles, formally signed in June 1919, recognized the sovereignty of Kingdom of Romania over Transylvania as a historic fact. The Treaties of <b>St.</b> <b>Germain</b> (1919) and Trianon (signed on June 1920) further elaborated the status of Transylvania and defined the new border between the states of Hungary and Romania. As a result, the more than 1.5 million Hungarian minority of Transylvania found itself becoming a minority group within Romania.|$|E

25|$|The Congress {{elected the}} Romanian Bukovinian {{politician}} Iancu Flondor as chairman, and {{voted for the}} union with the Kingdom of Romania, {{with the support of}} the Romanian, German, and Polish representatives; the Ukrainians did not support this. The reasons stated were that, until its takeover by the Habsburg in 1775, Bukovina was the heart of the Principality of Moldavia, where the gropniţele domneşti (voivods' burial sites) are located, and dreptul de liberă hotărâre de sine (right of self-determination). Romanian control of the province was recognized internationally in the Treaty of <b>St.</b> <b>Germain</b> in 1919.|$|E

25|$|The {{independence}} of Czechoslovakia was officially proclaimed in Prague on 28 October 1918 in Smetana Hall of the Municipal House, a physical setting {{strongly associated with}} nationalist feeling.

Konami is voiced by Miki Haruse in the visual novel, by Tomoko Kawakami in the Japanese anime, and by Tabitha <b>St.</b> <b>Germain</b> in the English anime.|$|E
25|$|There {{was also}} {{continuing}} unrest in the camp. The voyageurs, {{led by the}} two interpreters Pierre <b>St</b> <b>Germain</b> and Jean Baptiste Adam, again rebelled. This time Franklin's threats were ineffective, St Germian and Adam insisting that as continuing into the wilderness would mean certain death, the threat of execution for mutiny was laughable. Negotiation by Willard Wentzel, the North West Company's representative, eventually restored an uneasy truce. The discord was {{not confined to the}} voyageurs; Back and Hood had fallen out over their rivalry for the affections of an first nations girl nicknamed Greenstockings, and would have fought a duel with pistold over her had John Hepburn not removed the gunpowder from their weapons. The situation was defused when Back was dispatched south. Hood subsequently fathered a child with Greenstockings.|$|E
25|$|The club {{have also}} {{featured}} on popular television. Due {{to the fact}} that it is a club based in Northern Ireland playing in the league of the Republic of Ireland, it often receives the attention of broadcasters in both jurisdictions. In the BBC documentary series Who Do You Think You Are? shown the night before Derry's clash with Paris <b>St.</b> <b>Germain</b> in the 2006–07 UEFA Cup first round, it was highlighted that Archie McLeod, the grandfather of Doctor Who actor David Tennant, was a Derry City player. Derry had supplied a lucrative signing-on fee and had enticed him over from Scotland. Likewise, features about the club were run by Football Focus prior to and after the same UEFA Cup game. Irish television has also featured the club. Derry City played in the first League of Ireland match ever to be shown live on television when it visited Tolka Park to play Shelbourne during the 1996–97 season. The game was broadcast on RTÉ's Network 2 and finished 1–1 with Gary Beckett scoring for Derry.|$|E
