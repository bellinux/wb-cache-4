50|$|Sodium {{incorporation}} {{is necessary}} for optimal performance. Ideal Na concentration {{is considered to be}} approximately 0.1%. Na is commonly supplied by the soda-lime glass substrate, but in processes that do not use this substrate the Na must be deliberately added. Na's beneficial effects include increases in p-type conductivity, texture, and average grain size. Furthermore, Na incorporation allows for performance to be maintained over larger stoichiometric deviations. Simulations have predicted that Na on an In site creates a <b>shallow</b> <b>acceptor</b> <b>level</b> and that Na serves to remove In on Cu defects (donors), but reasons for these benefits are controversial. Na is also credited with catalyzing oxygen absorption. Oxygen passivates Se vacancies that act as compensating donors and recombination centers. Alloying CIS (CuInSe2) with CGS (CuGaSe2) increases in the bandgap. To reach the ideal bandgap for a single junction solar cell, 1.5 eV, a Ga/(In+Ga) ratio of roughly 0.7 is optimal. However, at ratios above ~0.3, device performance drops off. Industry currently targets the 0.3 Ga/(In+Ga) ratio, resulting in bandgaps between 1.1 and 1.2 eV. The decreasing performance has been postulated to be a result of CGS not forming the ODC, which {{is necessary for}} a good interface with CdS.|$|E

Therefore, the incorporation of acceptors in ZnO was remarkably enhanced due to the presence of aluminum.

Hole concentrations in excess of 1018 cm- 3 at room temperature are observed.

The dependence of hole concentration and ionisation energy on Mn concentration indicates that the <b>shallow</b> <b>acceptor</b> <b>level</b> is not simply due to unintentional co-doping. Thermopower measurements on freestanding films, CV profilometry, and the dependence of conductivity on thickness and growth temperature, all show that the conduction is not due to diffusion into the substrate.

40|$|The {{insufficient}} data on {{a structure}} of the boron-doped diamond (BDD) has frustrated efforts to fully understand the fascinating electronic properties of this material and how they evolve with doping. We have employed X-ray diffraction and Raman scattering for detailed study of the large-sized BDD single crystals. We demonstrate a formation of boron-carbon (B-C) nanosheets and bilayers in BDD with increasing boron concentration. An incorporation of two boron atoms in the diamond unit cell {{plays a key role}} for the B-C nanosheets and bilayer formation. Evidence for these B-C bilayers which are parallel to { 111 } planes is provided by the observation of high-order, super-lattice reflections in X-ray diffraction and Laue patterns. B-C nanosheets and bilayers minimize the strain energy and affect the electronic structure of BDD. A new <b>shallow</b> <b>acceptor</b> <b>level</b> associated with B-C nanosheets at ~ 37 meV and the spin-orbit splitting of the valence band of ~ 6 meV are observed in electronic Raman scattering. We identified that the superconducting transitions occur in the (111) BDD surfaces only. We believe that the origin of Mott and superconducting transitions is associated with the two-dimensional (2 D) misfit layer structure of BDD. A model for the BDD crystal structure, based on X-ray and Raman data, is proposed and confirmed by density functional theoretical calculation...|$|E
30|$|In {{the present}} work, we {{demonstrate}} that the BDD has a complex structure. It is a conventional 3 D crystal with point defects at the low doping level. Raman spectra show the point-defect-induced bands. The X-ray diffraction analysis is not sensitive to point defects. B-C nanosheets start to form at the boron concentration ≥ 4 [*]×[*] 1018  cm− 3. These nanosheets have a small size and cannot be detected by X-ray diffraction. Raman bands at 480 and 1230  cm− 1 associated with the B-C nanosheets appear. Simultaneously {{with the appearance of}} these Raman bands, the 1 s[*]→[*]ns electronic transitions between the 1 s ground and ns excited acceptor states are observed in electronic Raman spectra of BDD that are also associated with the B-C nanosheets. The analysis of these Raman spectra indicates unambiguously on the appearance of the new <b>shallow</b> <b>acceptor</b> <b>level</b> at ~ 37  meV and the spin-orbit splitting of the valence band of ~ 6  meV. The B-C nanosheets are self-assembled into the B-C bilayers at the boron concentration ~ 2 [*]×[*] 1020  cm− 3. The dimensions and number of B-C bilayers are sufficient to observe satellite peaks and high-order reflections in the X-ray diffraction. The Mott transition occurs in the bulk BDD when the acceptor states merge with the top of the valence band and the 1 s[*]→[*]ns electronic transitions are not already observed in electronic Raman spectra of BDD while the superconducting transitions occur in the BDD surfaces only.|$|E
40|$|Gigantic photoionization was {{discovered}} on GaAs-oxide interfaces {{leading to the}} discharge of deep surface states with rates exceeding 1000 times those of photoionization transitions to the conduction band. It exhibits a peak similar to acceptor-donor transitions and is explained as due to energy transfer from photo-excited donor-acceptor pairs to deep surface states. This new process indicates the presence of significant concentrations of <b>shallow</b> donor and <b>acceptor</b> <b>levels</b> not recognized in previous interface models...|$|R
40|$|We {{report on}} the {{characterization}} of bulk and epitaxial ZnO films doped by nitrogen. The ZnO thin films were grown on GaN templates and on ZnO single crystals by vapor phase deposition using Zn and NO 2 / N 2 O as precursors. Nitrogen {{was introduced in the}} epitaxial films by a mixture of ammonia in the total N 2 flow and by ion implantation into the bulk crystals. The optical properties were investigated by steady state and time resolved photoluminescence (PL). We observed a well structured donor–acceptor-pair (DAP) band with a zero phonon line (ZPL) at 3. 235 eV. Time resolved PL measurements allowed to con-clude on the compensation. Diffusion of Ga from the GaN templates into the ZnO layers was detected by SIMS. © 2004 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim 1 Introduction ZnO as a wide gap semiconductor is almost exclusively n-type conducting, and it is not astonishing that p-type doping has been a challenge for many years up to nowadays. Whereas the group I elements Li and Na form <b>shallow</b> <b>acceptor</b> <b>levels</b> in all the other II–VI semiconductors they introduce deep acceptor states in ZnO with binding energies between 500 and 800 meV [1]. Out of the group V elements nitrogen might be the best candidate considering the success with ZnSe:N [2]. The purpose o...|$|R
40|$|The {{possibilities}} of turning intrinsically n-type oxide semiconductors like ZnO and Zn 1 -xMgxO into p-type materials are investigated. Motivated by recent experiments on Zn 1 -xMgxO doped with nitrogen, we analyze the electronic defect levels of point defects NO,vZn, and NO-vZn pairs in ZnO and Zn 1 -xMgxO {{by means of}} self-interaction-corrected density functional theory calculations. We show how the interplay of defects can lead to <b>shallow</b> <b>acceptor</b> defect <b>levels,</b> although the levels of individual point defects NO are too deep in the band gap {{to be responsible for}} p-type conduction. We relate our results to p-type conduction paths at grain boundaries seen in polycrystalline ZnO and develop an understanding of a p-type mechanism which is common to ZnO, Zn 1 -xMgxO, and related materials...|$|R
