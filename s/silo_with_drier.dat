40|$|The paper {{describes}} {{results of}} experimental investigations of confined granular flow in a <b>silo</b> <b>with</b> different inserts. Over 100 experiments {{were carried out}} <b>with</b> <b>dry</b> cohesionless sand in a large metal <b>silo</b> <b>with</b> and without inserts at Tel-Tek, dept. POSTEC, in Norway. Wall pressures and flow patterns were measured during both silo filling and emptying. Three different insert types {{were used in the}} silo: double cone, cone-in-cone and inverted cone. Different positions of inserts were also investigated. Experimental results with inserts were compared with those without inserts. Some design recommendations for <b>silos</b> equipped <b>with</b> inserts were worked out...|$|R
40|$|The silos {{are widely}} used in bulk {{material}} in many fields such as agriculture, mining, chemical, electric power storage, etc. Thin metal cylindrical silo shells are vulnerable to buckling failure caused by the compressive wall friction force. In this paper, the structural analysis of two types of steel <b>silo</b> <b>with</b> cylindrical-wall bearing and profile-steel bearing is implemented by Abaqus finite element analysis. The results indicate that under the same loading conditions, steel <b>silos</b> <b>with</b> profile-steel bearing and cylindrical-Wall bearing have similar values in Mises stress, but the steel <b>silo</b> <b>with</b> profile-steel bearing has a smaller radial displacement and a better capability of buckling resistance. Meanwhile, the total steel volumes reduced 8. 0 % comparing to the steel <b>silo</b> <b>with</b> cylindrical-wall bearing. Therefore, steel soil with profile-steel bearing not only has a less steel volumes but also a good stability...|$|R
40|$|For the silo flow of two {{materials}} with contrasting strengths, an automatic separation without mixing {{of the materials}} is observed during drawing. In the present paper, the writers observe that a columniform funnel flow will appear in a <b>silo</b> <b>with</b> a single opening while a uniform flow will occur for a <b>silo</b> <b>with</b> a double opening. The classical and popular Janssen equation is hence less suitable for a <b>silo</b> <b>with</b> a single opening than for a <b>silo</b> <b>with</b> a double opening. The development of the arch action arising from the contact force is investigated through the distinct element analysis for the {{two different types of}} silo. It is also found that there are significant differences in the velocity and stress fields between the two different types of silo, which are worth consideration {{in the design of the}} silo and the recovery of the mineral ore.

40|$|Contained within tight {{geographical}} margins, {{islands are}} places where memories are intensified and heightened. The antithesis of the dreamy palm-covered paradises of travel brochures are the urban islands that lurk in blind spots, dark and brooding. Spatially and socially marginalised, such islands become memorials to the shadowy dimensions of civilisation: prisons, landfills, military bases, lunatic asylums, and cemeteries. Hart Island, Cockatoo Island, and Ripapa Island are liminal zones {{at the edges of}} our consciousness. There are no permanent residents on them, yet they are replete with cultural memories. Hart Island, despite being the United States’ largest cemetery, is practically invisible. Out of bounds to the public, it is a cemetery for the nameless and the homeless, with graves dug by prisoners from Riker’s Island jail. The island’s ruins include a lunatic asylum, prison, amusement park, and Nike anti-missile base, all dissolving into the picturesque greenery. Cockatoo Island is a wholly transformed landscape <b>with</b> <b>silos,</b> <b>dry</b> docks, and buildings sculpted directly into the sandstone. The infrastructural modifications have housed prisons, reform schools, and shipyards. Ripapa Island is also highly modified, with its defensive opportunities realised in its long history as a pa¯, a military fort, and a prison, which {{in the late nineteenth century}} housed followers of Te Whiti from the passive protest at Parihaka. Bearing their weighty cargo of memories, each island presents a conundrum, a “what now?” dilemma that vexes those charged with their care: to be preserved in a reserve as at Ripapa, or gentrified as a recreational site like Cockatoo, or to remain resolutely off the map as with Hart Island...|$|R

40|$|A {{model for}} slow {{accumulation}} of granular matter in a silo is considered. For {{the case of}} a circular <b>silo</b> <b>with</b> central point source the profiles of the standing and rolling layers are explicitly computed. The computed shapes agree qualitatively with experimental observations and seem better justified than results with constant speed of the rolling layer. 1 Introduction: The model In a recent publication [1] (see also [2]) we have studied a model for slowly moving granular matter based on the BCRE concept of a standing layer u and a rolling layer v (some other authors use h and R instead). It connects the flow of the rolling layer to the gradient of the standing layer and it describes the exchange between the two layers in terms of deviation from the angle of repose. The model accommodates external sources with matter falling from "high up" down into the rolling layer. Here we apply the model to the problem of a circular <b>silo</b> <b>with</b> central source, and to the corresponding problem in 1 D [...] ...|$|R
