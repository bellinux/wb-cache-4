5|$|There {{are four}} game modes in Double Dash: Grand Prix, Time Trial, Versus, and Battle. Most of the modes {{can be played}} cooperatively, while <b>some</b> <b>can</b> only be played by {{themselves}} in single-player races.|$|E
5|$|At first sight, frogs seem rather defenceless {{because of}} their small size, slow movement, thin skin, and lack of {{defensive}} structures, such as spines, claws or teeth. Many use camouflage to avoid detection, the skin often being spotted or streaked in neutral colours that allow a stationary frog to merge into its surroundings. <b>Some</b> <b>can</b> make prodigious leaps, often into water, that help them to evade potential attackers, while many have other defensive adaptations and strategies.|$|E
5|$|Cockroaches {{are among}} the hardiest insects. Some species are capable of {{remaining}} active for a month without food {{and are able to}} survive on limited resources, such as the glue from the back of postage stamps. <b>Some</b> <b>can</b> go without air for 45 minutes. Japanese cockroach (Periplaneta japonica) nymphs, which hibernate in cold winters, survived twelve hours at −5°C to −8°C in laboratory experiments.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes: git a hunk o' bacon an' <b>some</b> <b>canned</b> corn, tomatoes, an' <b>some</b> <b>canned</b> salmon; if y' {{think we}} can stand the pressure, bring home a can o' peaches." ...|$|R
60|$|Deering pushed Peter, who {{woke up and}} grumbled. Deering {{open his}} pack awkwardly {{and pulled out a}} bannock and <b>some</b> <b>canned</b> meat.|$|R
5|$|Stannous {{chloride}} is {{also added}} {{as a food}} additive with E number E512 to <b>some</b> <b>canned</b> and bottled foods, where {{it serves as a}} color-retention agent and antioxidant.|$|R
5|$|Killer {{whales are}} apex predators, {{meaning that they}} {{themselves}} have no natural predators. They are sometimes called the wolves of the sea, because they hunt in groups like wolf packs. Killer whales hunt varied prey including fish, cephalopods, mammals, sea birds and sea turtles. However, different populations or ecotypes may specialize and <b>some</b> <b>can</b> have a dramatic impact on certain prey species. Specialization of prey species may be more common in whales that inhabit temperate areas due to higher food productivity.|$|E
5|$|Lynn {{serves as}} a major hub and {{transfer}} point for MBTA Bus routes serving the North Shore area. All routes pull into the station busway off Route 1A, though <b>some</b> <b>can</b> be caught at Central Square via the station's Exchange Street/Central Square entrance as well.|$|E
5|$|Some mammals are intelligent, {{with some}} {{possessing}} large brains, self-awareness and tool use. Mammals can communicate and vocalize {{in several different}} ways, including the production of ultrasound, scent-marking, alarm signals, singing, and echolocation. Mammals can organize themselves into fission-fusion societies, harems, and hierarchies, but can also be solitary and territorial. Most mammals are polygynous, but <b>some</b> <b>can</b> be monogamous or polyandrous.|$|E
50|$|Job {{setup is}} also {{facilitated}} by <b>canned</b> cycles. <b>Some</b> <b>canned</b> cycles exist which {{are designed for}} use by machine tool operators for simple job set-up and measuring tasks.|$|R

60|$|It was {{the sailor}} Wilbur, {{who had been}} sent to get <b>some</b> <b>canned</b> goods for cooking purposes. He came down the rope ladder with a lantern slung over one arm.|$|R
5|$|The Welsh Springer is {{generally}} a healthy breed, but <b>some</b> <b>can</b> suffer conditions common to many breeds such as hip dysplasia, Canine glaucoma and like other dogs with pendulous ears, they {{are prone to}} ear infections such as otitis externa. In a survey of over a hundred breeds of dog conducted in 1997, the Welsh Springer Spaniel was ranked 14th for worst hip score, with the average score of the breed being 18.45. The average lifespan is 12 to 15 years.|$|E
5|$|Twelve Knights are {{available}} from the start (including Arthur King), each with his own weapon, personality and statistics for life force, defense, strength and speed. Each boss of the game has a specific weakness against one of the Knights. Changing party members is done by visiting the Round Table room in Camelot. Each character has a life meter, and Arthur also has a power meter. Various items must be collected to complete quests and objectives, while <b>some</b> <b>can</b> be used to restore a character's life meter.|$|E
5|$|A cold usually {{begins with}} fatigue, {{a feeling of}} being chilled, sneezing, and a headache, {{followed}} {{in a couple of days}} by a runny nose and cough. Symptoms may begin within sixteen hours of exposure and typically peak two to four days after onset. They usually resolve in seven to ten days, but <b>some</b> <b>can</b> last for up to three weeks. The average duration of cough is eighteen days and in some cases people develop a post-viral cough which can linger after the infection is gone. In children, the cough lasts for more than ten days in 35–40% of cases and continues for more than 25 days in 10%.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{was busy}} {{when he came}} along and I told him to look around for himself. I think he took <b>some</b> <b>canned</b> stuff and {{there was quite a}} big loaf missing." ...|$|R
60|$|The rival campers {{looked over}} such {{provisions}} {{as they had}} left, and enumerated the articles---sugar, cocoa, flour, <b>some</b> <b>canned</b> goods, and <b>some</b> preserves. Snap and his chums went ashore and investigated.|$|R
60|$|But the {{conflagration}} {{had gained}} considerable headway, and <b>some</b> <b>cans</b> of paints and oils added ready {{fuel to the}} blaze. The smoke grew thicker and thicker, and presently a tongue of flame shot skyward.|$|R
5|$|Enemies {{can hear}} {{footsteps}} and other sounds. When Fiona is {{in a dangerous}} situation, she may fall into a panic. During panic mode, visibility gets worse, the menu can't be opened, and she will begin running on her own, tripping and falling into walls. Panic mode will elapse after some time, or certain items {{can be used to}} calm her down. If Fiona sustains a significant amount of damage, she will slow down and become unable to backstep. If she receives too much damage she can die. Damage heals with time or items can be used to bring her vitality back to normal. While some items are used to heal Fiona and Hewie, others are used to damage enemies. <b>Some</b> <b>can</b> be thrown while others are set like traps for the enemy to walk over. Some items are found by searching while others can be crafted in refining rooms.|$|E
5|$|Fungi have a {{worldwide}} distribution, and grow {{in a wide}} range of habitats, including extreme environments such as deserts or areas with high salt concentrations or ionizing radiation, as well as in deep sea sediments. <b>Some</b> <b>can</b> survive the intense UV and cosmic radiation encountered during space travel. Most grow in terrestrial environments, though several species live partly or solely in aquatic habitats, such as the chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, a parasite that has been responsible for {{a worldwide}} decline in amphibian populations. This organism spends part of its life cycle as a motile zoospore, enabling it to propel itself through water and enter its amphibian host. Other examples of aquatic fungi include those living in hydrothermal areas of the ocean.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{longevity}} of frogs and toads in the wild, but <b>some</b> <b>can</b> live for many years. Skeletochronology is a method of examining bones to determine age. Using this method, the ages of mountain yellow-legged frogs (Rana muscosa) were studied, the phalanges of the toes showing seasonal lines where growth slows in winter. The oldest frogs had ten bands, so their age was believed to be 14 years, including the four-year tadpole stage. Captive frogs and toads have been recorded as living for up to 40 years, an age achieved by a European common toad (Bufo bufo). The cane toad (Bufo marinus) has been known to survive 24 years in captivity, and the American bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana) 14 years. Frogs from temperate climates hibernate during the winter, and four species are known to be able to withstand freezing during this time, including the wood frog (Rana sylvatica).|$|E
50|$|<b>Some</b> {{languages}} <b>can</b> statically link data inline with instructions. These can {{be considered}} data-structured, in the most primitive way. <b>Some</b> Assembly languages <b>can</b> do this.|$|R
60|$|The {{prospect}} of a meal brightened up both lads, and they set {{to work with a}} will, and soon had coffee made. There were bread and butter and <b>some</b> <b>canned</b> beef and beans, and they ate heartily.|$|R
50|$|Most animals use limbs for locomotion, such as walking, running, or climbing. <b>Some</b> animals <b>can</b> {{use their}} front limbs (or upper limbs in humans) to carry and {{manipulate}} objects. <b>Some</b> animals <b>can</b> also use hind limbs for manipulation.|$|R
5|$|Many coins {{have been}} found in {{northern}} Ethiopia and Eritrea, the central region of Aksum, though Aksumite coins are reported to {{have been found}} in Arato and Lalibela. Many coins have been also found further afield. Numerous hoards of coins (always gold save one silver coin) {{have been found in}} Southern Arabia, much more than in Aksum itself, attesting perhaps to an Aksumite presence in parts of the region (perhaps supporting the use of titles claiming control over parts of South Arabia from GDRT's time). The hoards may be the remnants of hoards left in Kaleb's time (perhaps used to pay soldiers), when it was under an Aksumite governor. Outside of the Horn of Africa and Arabian Peninsula, coins have been found as far as Israel, Meroe, Egypt, and India. Silver and copper coins are mainly found in Aksum, though <b>some</b> <b>can</b> be traced to Palestinian pilgrim centers.|$|E
5|$|Melkhior the wizard's castle {{consists}} {{of a series of}} 128 rooms, each displayed on a single, non-scrolling screen. Sabreman must navigate the 3D maze of stone blocks in each room, usually to retrieve a collectible object, whilst avoiding spikes and enemies, which kill him on contact. The player begins with four lives, and loses one for each death; running out of lives ends the game. Stone blocks serve as platforms for the player to jump between; some fall under the player's weight, some move of their own accord, and <b>some</b> <b>can</b> be pushed by ghosts. Sabreman jumps higher when in werewolf form, which helps in specific puzzles. The player often needs to move blocks to reach distant objects, which are then used as platforms to reach areas in other puzzles. To complete the game, the player must return 14 sequential objects from throughout the castle to the wizard's cauldron room. At the end of the game, the player receives a final score based on the remaining time and amount of the quest completed.|$|E
5|$|Most millipedes are slow-moving detritivores, eating {{decaying}} {{leaves and}} other dead plant matter. Some eat fungi or suck plant fluids, {{and a small}} minority are predatory. Millipedes are generally harmless to humans, although <b>some</b> <b>can</b> become household or garden pests, especially in greenhouses where they can cause severe damage to emergent seedlings. Most millipedes defend themselves {{with a variety of}} chemicals secreted from pores along the body, although the tiny bristle millipedes are covered with tufts of detachable bristles. Reproduction in most species is carried out by modified male legs called gonopods, which transfer packets of sperm to females.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{know about}} these stores," [...] {{announced}} Spouter, who had been going over them carefully. [...] "It {{seems to me we}} had more canned stuff than this--some green corn and asparagus, and also <b>some</b> <b>canned</b> salmon and sardines." ...|$|R
50|$|In 2007 it was {{reported}} that <b>some</b> <b>canned</b> light tuna such as yellowfin tuna is significantly higher in mercury than skipjack, and caused Consumers Union and other activist groups to advise pregnant women to refrain from consuming canned tuna.|$|R
6000|$|... "You can let up," [...] he said. [...] "It's hardly likely we'll {{have any}} more trouble. There's a lamp and <b>some</b> <b>canned</b> stuff in the shack, and as we'll have to camp here I'll make some coffee. It's quite dark now." ...|$|R
5|$|One half of Code: Veronica {{places the}} player {{in control of}} Claire Redfield while the other half is spent with her brother, Chris. Basic {{character}} actions include running, attacking, as well as pushing and climbing objects. Items the player collects can be viewed on the status screen. From here, they can be examined to find clues to solve puzzles, and <b>some</b> <b>can</b> also be equipped. Also available in the status screen is a map and file menu. All notes found in the game are saved in game's files and may be essential to solve puzzles. The player can only hold {{a limited number of}} items at a given time; other items must stored in storage boxes located throughout the game.|$|E
5|$|Rapid {{progress}} in {{hardware and software}} development continued, including projects funded by the European Community. The first commercially available dynamic screen speech generating devices were developed in the 1990s. At the same time synthesized speech was becoming available in more languages. Software programs were developed that allowed the computer-based production of communication boards. High-tech devices have continued to reduce in size and weight, while increasing accessibility and capacities. Modern communication devices can also enable users to access the internet and <b>some</b> <b>can</b> be used as environmental control devices for independent access of TV, radio, telephone etc.|$|E
5|$|Sawtooth National Forest {{receives}} {{over one}} million visitors a year. Two visitor centers, one at the SNRA headquarters north of Ketchum and one at Redfish Lake, provide orientation, books, maps, and interpretive displays and are staffed by either forest service interpreters or volunteers. The forest's ranger stations also provide these services, but without interpretive displays. Along the roadways, exhibits showcase key parts of the forest, and there are plentiful day use and picnic areas. There are more than 81 campgrounds in the forest, with 12 in the Fairfield District, 6 in the Ketchum District, 25 in the Minidoka District, and 38 in the SNRA. Most of the campgrounds are on a first come first served basis, while <b>some</b> <b>can</b> be reserved.|$|E
