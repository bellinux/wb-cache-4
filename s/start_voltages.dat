40|$|Abstract:Under {{partially}} shaded conditions, the P-U {{characteristic of}} the photovoltaic (PV) array is characterized by multiple peaks. The presence of multiple peaks reduces {{the effectiveness of the}} existing maximum power point tracking (MPPT) schemes, which refers only to the tracking of a single peak on the P-U characteristic. This paper proposes a novel method for the global MPPT. The new method starts at the <b>starting</b> <b>voltage</b> which is 80 % of the open-circuit voltage of the PV array, and finds the first local maximum power point (MPP) using the perturb and observe (P&O) approach. Then the second search finds the next local MPP based on the P&O approach starting from the new <b>starting</b> <b>voltage,</b> which is determined by increasing the rate of slope of the current line at the first local MPP. The new algorithm follows this searching procedure until the global MPP is found. The new algorithm avoids searching the turning-point voltage between the two local MPP, and the voltage range swept is shortened significantly with the result of fast searching speed. Simulations validates that under partially shaded conditions the proposed new algorithm can track the global MPP with the fast tracking speed and the high precision.

30|$|In conclusion, ZnO {{nanowires}} {{were prepared}} by a low-pressure {{chemical vapor deposition}} process and bridged on the interdigitated Au electrodes. NDR in the I–V curves of ZnO nanowires bridging the interdigitated Au electrodes has been observed. NDR performance can be controlled by the bias voltage. The NDR peak voltage and peak current are influenced strongly by the value of <b>starting</b> <b>voltage.</b> The origin of this NDR is the charging and discharging effect between ZnO nanowires and metal electrodes rather than the conventional resonant tunneling mechanism. The weak nanoscale contact between ZnO nanowires and metal electrodes forms the parasitic capacitor. The frequency-dependent C–V measurements further demonstrated the charging and discharging processes. Such NDR effect in the metal/nanowires/metal structure has important potential applications in nanowire-based switches, oscillators, and resonators.|$|R
40|$|Pseudospark-sourced {{electron}} beam is a self-focused intense {{electron beam}} which can propagate without any external focusing magnetic field. This electron beam can drive a beam-wave interaction directly or after being post-accelerated. It is especially suitable for terahertz (THz) radiation generation {{due to the}} ability of a pseudospark discharge to produce small size in the micron range and very high current density and bright electron beams. In this paper, a single-gap pseudospark discharge chamber has been built and tested with several electrode gap separations to explore the dependence of the pseudospark-sourced electron beam current on the discharge voltage and the electrode gap separation. Experimental results show that the beam pulses have similar pulse width and delay time from the distinct drop of the applied voltage for smaller electrode gap separations but longer delay time for the largest gap separation used in the experiment. It has been found that the electron beam only starts to occur when the charging voltage is above a certain value, which is defined as the <b>starting</b> <b>voltage</b> of the electron beam. The <b>starting</b> <b>voltage</b> is different for different electrode gap separations and decreases with increasing electrode gap separation in our pseudospark discharge configuration. The electron beam current increases with the increasing discharge voltage following two tendencies. Under the same discharge voltage, the configuration with the larger electrode gap separation will generate higher electron beam current. When the discharge voltage is higher than 10 kV, the beam current generated at the electrode gap separation of 17. 0 mm, is much higher than that generated at smaller gap separations. The ionization of the neutral gas in the main gap is inferred to contribute more to the current increase with increasing electrode gap separation...|$|R

The ring type electrode or the strip type electrode, as the starting electrode, was positioned near the 20 W fluorescent lamp wall, and the starting characteristics of the discharge lamp were measured for the source frequency region between commercial frequencies and 500 Hz. For commercial frequencies and 500 Hz, the relation between the main restriking voltage and the ring location and also the preheating current of electrodes were obtaind.

When the reflector was earthed, the starting characteristics were not affected by the earthing effect for the strip electrode, but those were made random by the earthing effect for the ring electrode.
