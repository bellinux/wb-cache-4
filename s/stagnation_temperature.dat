40|$|AbstractHybrid {{photovoltaic-thermal}} (PVT) collectors co-generate {{solar electricity}} and heat in a single component with an optimum utilization of space. Spectrally selective but transparent low-emissivity (low-e) coatings are a proven method to reduce thermal losses. However, overheating and stagnation are critical issues for these collectors due to material degradation, thermal stress, and low electrical efficiency. This paper presents a PVT collector concept with variable film insulation as overheating protection. An inflatable glass-film cushion regulates thermal losses. Performance and stagnation tests were carried out with a prototype. During normal operation the collector achieves a high thermal efficiency. In periods of standstill, the deflated cushion has a high heat dissipation rate by deactivating the low-e coating. <b>Stagnation</b> <b>temperatures</b> are thus limited to 95 ̊C. To conclude, the PVT collector combines the advantages of glazed and unglazed PVT collectors which are a high thermal efficiency and low <b>stagnation</b> <b>temperatures...</b>|$|R

2500|$|Rayleigh flow {{refers to}} frictionless, non-Adiabatic flow through a {{constant}} area duct where {{the effect of}} heat addition or rejection is considered. [...] Compressibility effects often come into consideration, although the Rayleigh flow model certainly also applies to incompressible flow. [...] For this model, the duct area remains constant and no mass is added within the duct. [...] Therefore, unlike Fanno flow, the <b>stagnation</b> <b>temperature</b> is a variable. [...] The heat addition causes a decrease in stagnation pressure, which {{is known as the}} Rayleigh effect and is critical in the design of combustion systems. [...] Heat addition will cause both supersonic and subsonic Mach numbers to approach Mach 1, resulting in choked flow. [...] Conversely, heat rejection decreases a subsonic Mach number and increases a supersonic Mach number along the duct.

Achieving <b>stagnation</b> <b>temperatures</b> exceeding 200 [*]°C, pertinent to these technologies, with unconcentrated sunlight requires spectrally selective absorbers with exceptionally low emissivity in the thermal wavelength range and high visible absorptivity for the solar spectrum.

2500|$|The above {{equation}} can {{be manipulated}} to solve for M {{as a function of}} H. However, due to the form of the T/T* equation, a complicated multi-root relation is formed for M = M(T/T*). Instead, M can be chosen as an independent variable where ΔS and H can be matched up in a chart as shown in Figure 1. Figure 1 shows that heating will increase an upstream, subsonic Mach number until M = 1.0 and the flow chokes. [...] Conversely, adding heat to a duct with an upstream, supersonic Mach number will cause the Mach number to decrease until the flow chokes. [...] Cooling produces the opposite result for each of those two cases. The Rayleigh flow model reaches maximum entropy at M = 1.0 For subsonic flow, the maximum value of H occurs at M = 0.845. [...] This indicates that cooling, instead of heating, causes the Mach number to move from 0.845 to 1.0 [...] This is not necessarily correct as the <b>stagnation</b> <b>temperature</b> always increases to move the flow from a subsonic Mach number to M = 1, but from M = 0.845 to M = 1.0 the flow accelerates faster than heat is added to it.
