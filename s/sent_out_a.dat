5|$|With {{the support}} of an entire legion, other legionnaires, {{prompted}} by discontent over pay, deserted Macrinus and joined Elagabalus' ranks as well. In response to the growing threat, Macrinus <b>sent</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> cavalry force {{under the command of}} Ulpius Julianus to try and regain control of the rebel soldiers. Rather than capturing the rebel forces, the cavalry instead killed Ulpius and defected to Elagabalus.|$|E

5|$|After {{this the}} commandos came up against {{part of the}} Siegfried Line defences around Roermond. A short halt {{followed}} and during this time No. 6 Commando <b>sent</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> number of patrols mounted on the tanks of the 8th Hussars. In February, the snow thawed and the ground turned to mud which rendered the tanks useless {{and as a result}} the commandos carried out their patrols on foot.|$|E
5|$|For {{the next}} year, the {{different}} band members then worked part-time jobs {{along with the}} rest of their work with the band. After continuous gigging around the Midlands, it wasn't long until word of mouth helped them become a popular unsigned band. The band then <b>sent</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> one track demo cd of Bullets, earning them the interest of several British labels, with thirty A reps coming to see them play at Birmingham. In October 2004, the group signed to Newcastle based indie label Kitchenware Records. Upon signing to the record label they changed their band name to Editors.|$|E
5|$|ILM {{digitally}} recreated {{the vast}} majority of the New York cityscape used in the film. In total, ILM artists rendered an area of about ten city blocks by about four city blocks. To do this, ILM <b>sent</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> team of four photographers to take pictures of the area in a shoot that lasted 8 weeks. Disney and Sony Pictures agreed for OsCorp Tower from The Amazing Spider-Man to be included in the film, but the idea was dropped because much of the skyline had already been completed.|$|E

5|$|M. de Rouilly, {{the leader}} of the supply convoy Rogers had intercepted, {{returned}} to Carillon and alerted Paul-Louis de Lusignan, the fort's commander. According to Lusignan's report, he immediately <b>sent</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> party of about 90 regulars from the Languedoc regiment under the command of Capitaine de Basserode, accompanied by about 90 Canadian militia and Indians. The Indians were primarily Ottawa under the command of Charles Michel de Langlade, one of the French-Indian leaders at Braddock's defeat in 1755.|$|E
5|$|Muhammad and the Muslims {{buried the}} {{dead on the}} battlefield, {{returning}} home that evening. The Meccans retired for the evening {{at a place called}} Hamra al-Asad, a few miles away from Medina. The next morning, Muhammad <b>sent</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> small force to harass the Meccan army on their way home. According to Watt, this was because Muhammad realized that a show of force was required to speed the Meccans away from Medinan territory. The Meccans, not wanting to be perceived as being chased away, remained nearby for a few days before leaving.|$|E
5|$|On 3 December 1942, the USAAF <b>sent</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> Request for Proposals (RfP) for a {{diminutive}} piston-engined fighter. By January 1944, the Air Technical Service Command refined the RfP and in January1945, the specifications were further revised in MX-472 to specify a jet-powered aircraft. Although {{a number of}} aerospace companies studied the feasibility of such aircraft, McDonnell was the only company to submit a proposal to the original 1942 request and later revised requirements. The company's Model 27 proposal was completely reworked to meet the new specifications.|$|E

There were also threats of legal action against Nash and Camberwell, which did not eventuate, although for playing in another competition without a clearance, Nash was banned from playing in the VFL competition for three years – a suspension which meant {{he would have to}} sit out of all football (both VFA and VFL) for three years if he wished to return from the VFA to the VFL.|$|E
5|$|Starting in 1940, British {{aircraft}} {{were increasingly}} {{equipped with the}} IFF Mk. II system, which allowed radar operators {{to determine whether a}} blip on their screen was a friendly aircraft. IFF was a responder that <b>sent</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> pulse of radio signal immediately on reception of a radio signal from a radar system. The IFF's transmission mixed with the radar's own pulse, causing the blip to stretch out in time from a small peak to an extended rectangular shape.|$|E
5|$|The Athenians then <b>sent</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> {{force to}} assist in garrisoning Corinth, with Iphicrates {{commanding}} the peltasts. The Spartans and the exiles, meanwhile, raided Corinthian territory from Lechaeum, and in 391 BC King Agesilaus led a large Spartan army to the area and attacked a number of strongpoints, winning a number of successes. The Athenians and their allies were largely bottled up in Corinth, but eventually found {{an opportunity to take}} advantage of Spartan negligence.|$|E

5|$|The German {{invasion}} of Norway, Operation Weserübung, began on 9 April 1940. In {{order to prevent}} any disruption of the invasion by the British, the Kriegsmarine had previously dispatched a force under Vice Admiral Günther Lütjens to protect the troop convoy landing at Narvik. The German squadron consisted of the battleships Scharnhorst and Gneisenau, the heavy cruiser , and 10 destroyers. With intelligence suggesting that the Germans were massing ships, the British <b>sent</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> squadron under Admiral Sir William Whitworth to deny German access to neutral Norwegian waters by laying mines in Operation Wilfred and prevent any German naval movements into the Atlantic Ocean.|$|E
5|$|The jailer said that, after {{struggling}} for two hours, he escaped {{and raised the}} alarm at Moon's restaurant {{across the road from}} the jail. Sheriff Dunnegan <b>sent</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> search party to no avail. According to the Ledger, a fence post suspended on two chairs across a window was found in the jury room just after the lynching, near the cell where Laura had been held. It was thought that the men had intended to hang Laura out of the window, but were deterred by an electric light burning nearby.|$|E
5|$|After this, the Spartans <b>sent</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> new commander, Anaxibius, to Abydos. For a time, {{he enjoyed}} {{a number of}} successes against Pharnabazus, and seized a number of Athenian {{merchant}} ships. Worried that Thrasybulus's accomplishments were being undermined, the Athenians sent Iphicrates to the region to confront Anaxibius. For a time, the two forces merely raided each other's territory, but eventually Iphicrates succeeded in guessing where Anaxibius would bring his troops on a return march from a campaign against Antandrus, and ambushed the Spartan force. When Anaxibius and his men, who were strung out {{in the line of}} march, had entered the rough, mountainous terrain in which Iphicrates and his men were waiting, the Athenians emerged and ambushed them, killing Anaxibius and many others.|$|E

50|$|As {{the radio}} hut {{was among the}} {{equipment}} that fell into the sea, the rig never <b>sent</b> <b>out</b> <b>an</b> emergency signal.

5|$|Alarmed by this Spartan naval resurgence, the Athenians <b>sent</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> {{fleet of}} 40 triremes under Thrasybulus. He, judging {{that he could}} {{accomplish}} more by campaigning where the Spartan fleet was not than by challenging it directly, sailed to the Hellespont. Once there, he won over several major states to the Athenian side and placed a duty on ships sailing past Byzantium, restoring a source of revenue that the Athenians had relied on in the late Peloponnesian War. He then sailed to Lesbos, where, {{with the support of}} the Mytileneans, he defeated the Spartan forces on the island and won over a number of cities. While still on Lesbos, however, Thrasybulus was killed by raiders from the city of Aspendus.|$|E
5|$|Ament and Gossard were {{devastated by}} the death of Wood and the {{resulting}} demise of Mother Love Bone. Gossard spent his time afterwards writing material that was harder-edged than what he had been doing previously. After a few months, Gossard started practicing with fellow Seattle guitarist Mike McCready, whose band, Shadow, had broken up; McCready in turn encouraged Gossard to reconnect with Ament. After practicing for a while, the trio <b>sent</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> five-song demo tape in order to find a singer and a drummer. They gave former Red Hot Chili Peppers drummer Jack Irons the demo to see if he would be interested in joining the band and to distribute the demo to anyone he felt might fit the lead vocal position.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the issues}} that the Mint Bureau had to face in 1933 and 1934 was the calling-in of most gold coins. When the Treasury Department issued {{regulations}} allowing such coins to be surrendered at branches of the Federal Reserve Bank, O'Reilly <b>sent</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> memorandum over her signature as acting director noting that the Fed had no facilities to accept any gold other than bars with a government stamp. At the time, the Mint Bureau {{was one of the}} lowest-status branches of the Department of the Treasury, esteemed far less than the Secret Service and other law enforcement-related agencies that fell under the Treasury Secretary. Burdette points out that the gold regulations showed a lack of basic Mint knowledge both by Roosevelt's appointees and the holdover senior officials from the Hoover administration.|$|E
