5|$|Charlotte Shaw was a fourteen-year-old British schoolgirl who drowned while {{crossing}} a swollen stream on Dartmoor during training for Ten Tors in 2007. Her death, {{the first to}} occur in connection with Ten Tors or one of its training expeditions, made national news headlines in the United Kingdom. She was {{with a group of}} students from Edgehill College trekking the route of Ten Tors in training for the main event when the group got into difficulties {{crossing a}} stream. Shaw <b>slipped</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> water and was washed downstream. She was located 20 minutes later by a Royal Navy search and rescue helicopter and airlifted to Derriford Hospital in Plymouth, where she died {{in the early hours of}} the next morning.|$|E
5|$|Feth-i Bülend saw action {{during the}} Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878, where she battled the Russian steamer Vesta in an {{inconclusive}} engagement. The Ottoman fleet was laid up {{for most of}} the next twenty years, and Feth-i Bülend saw no activity during this period. Modernized in 1890, she was nevertheless still not in condition for active service at the outbreak of the Greco-Turkish War in 1897. She was therefore heavily rebuilt in Germany between 1903 and 1907. At the start of the First Balkan War in 1912, the ship was stationed in Thessaloniki; the ship was disarmed so the guns could be used to strengthen the port's fortifications. On the night of 31 October, a Greek torpedo boat <b>slipped</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> harbor and sank Feth-i Bülend, killing seven of her crew.|$|E
5|$|While the British {{proclaimed the}} Battle of the Atlantic open on 6 March 1941, {{attempts}} by the German Kriegsmarine to disrupt British trade routes had begun {{before the start of}} the war. The Graf Spee had <b>slipped</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Atlantic in August 1939, and had caused significant damage in the south Atlantic, before being eliminated as a threat in Montevideo harbour, in the aftermath of the Battle of the River Plate. Other operations were mounted by Admiral Scheer and Admiral Hipper into British waters in 1940 with various success. Although Coastal Command was tasked with shadowing German surface fleets, Coastal Command had not contributed to any effective engagements fought with German commerce raiders until 1941.|$|E

5|$|BuzzSaw is themed {{around a}} series of unexplainable occurrences in the Town of Gold Rush which {{date back to the}} late 1800s. In 1876, the Town of Gold Rush was formed. It was a prosperous town during the great gold rush. Eleven years later, in 1887, the town's Gold supply was {{completely}} gone. The town then established a sawmill and turned their focus to timber. On a clear moon-lit night, a sawmill worker named Jack Darke was killed by the buzz saw after he had a scuffle with some other workers who were attempting to set the building on fire. The circumstances leading up to his death were covered up by the town with the legend stating that Jack tried to burn down the sawmill and <b>slipped</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> path of the buzz saw. The sawmill has remained closed since with many people claiming encounters with the ghost of Jack on nights similar to that of his death.|$|E
5|$|The Earp party rode {{north to}} the Percy Ranch, but were not welcomed by Hugh and Jim Percy, who feared the Cowboys; after a meal and some rest, they left around 3:00 {{in the morning of}} March 27. The Earp party <b>slipped</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> area near Tombstone and met with supporters, {{including}} Hairlip Charlie Smith and Warren Earp. On March 27, the posse arrived at the Sierra Bonita Ranch owned by Henry Hooker, a wealthy and prominent rancher. That night, Dan Tipton caught the first stage out of Tombstone and headed for Benson, carrying $1,000 from mining owner and Earp supporter E. B. Gage for the posse. Hooker congratulated Earp on the killing of Curly Bill. Hooker fed them and Wyatt told him he wanted to buy new mounts. Hooker was known for his purebred stallions and ran over 500 brood mares that produced horses that became known for their speed, beauty, and temperament. He provided Wyatt and his posse with new mounts, but refused to take Wyatt's money. When Behan's posse was observed in the distance, Hooker suggested Wyatt make his stand there, but Wyatt moved into the hills about three miles (5km) distant near Reilly Hill.|$|E

In eighteen first-class matches, Fulton scored a total of 1892 runs, {{at an average of}} 75.68. His form over the season was noticed by the national selectors, who according to Nasser Hussain, originally selected him in place of Mark Butcher for the fourth Test against Australia, before having a change of heart and reinstating Butcher. Nonetheless, Fulton was named Player of the Year by the Professional Cricketers' Association {{at the end of the}} season.|$|E

That night Bragg, stunned by the defeat on Lookout Mountain, asked his two corps commanders whether to retreat from Chattanooga or to stand and fight. Hardee counseled retreat, but Breckinridge convinced Bragg to fight {{it out on the}} strong position of Missionary Ridge. Accordingly, the troops withdrawn from Lookout Mountain were ordered to the left flank of Bragg's army.|$|E
25|$|Clifton, {{realising}} {{that there}} were crucial holes in the concert footage, suggested that the entire show be recreated at Shepperton Studios in August 1974, on a mock-up of the Madison Square Garden stage.

When it was agreed that the band would meet at Shepperton Studios for filming, Jones had recently had his hair cut short, so he had to wear a wig. Robert Plant's teeth had also been fixed between the 1973 and 1974 filmings.|$|E
25|$|In 1968 Grimsby <b>slipped</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Fourth Division for {{the first}} time. The {{following}} season the club had to apply for re-election to the league having finished second from bottom. It was in this season that the lowest-ever attendance for a Football League match at Blundell Park was ever recorded; 1,833 saw a 2–0 defeat to Brentford. Arthur Drewry, a local businessman, married the daughter of Grimsby Town's chairman, and subsequently served as {{a director of the}} club before his own chairmanship. Drewry became President of the Football League and Chairman of the Football Association after Grimsby, before he was elected as the 5th President of FIFA.|$|E

25|$|In 1974 Dave Sexton joined {{as manager}} and, in 1975–76 led QPR to the runners-up {{spot in the}} First Division, missing out on the {{championship}} by one point with a squad containing seven England internationals and internationals from the home nations. After completing their 42-game season, QPR sat {{at the top of}} the league, one point ahead of Liverpool who went on to defeat Wolverhampton Wanderers to clinch the title. Wolves were relegated to the Second Division that same season. The late 1970s also saw some cup success with Rangers reaching the semi-finals of the League Cup and in their first entry into European football reached the quarter finals of the UEFA Cup losing to AEK Athens on penalties. Following Sexton's departure in 1977 the club eventually <b>slipped</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Second Division in 1979.|$|E

Räikkönen would need to win the next race with Schumacher not scoring any points. After qualifying 8th in Japan, Räikkönen finished 2nd while Michael Schumacher just <b>slipped</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> points to win his 6th World Championship. Montoya's retirement during the race also meant that Räikkönen finished 2nd in the championship, just two points behind Schumacher. The team also narrowly lost {{second place in the}} Constructors' Championship, finishing third, two points behind runners-up Williams, and 12 points behind Ferrari. Mathematically, Williams or McLaren could have won the championship at the very last race. The 2003 season was one of the closest in recent years.|$|E

The prince's dog managed to swim to land and went in search of his master. Failing to find him on Jura or Scarba he tried to leap across the strait to Lunga, but missed his footing on Eilean a' Bhealaich which sits {{in the middle of the}} channel between the two islands.
