5|$|The {{first four}} Vickers 6-Ton tanks {{arrived in the}} USSR {{at the end of}} 1930. The last tanks arrived in 1932, when <b>series</b> <b>production</b> of the T-26 was already in progress. The British tanks were sent to Soviet {{factories}} for study in preparation for <b>series</b> <b>production</b> and to military educational institutions and training units. Later, some tanks were given to military supply depots and proving grounds.|$|E
5|$|As the <b>series</b> <b>production</b> of the PS-2 gun was delayed, the Main Artillery Agency of the RKKA gave {{preference}} {{to a new}} gun. It {{was developed by the}} Artillery Design Office of the Bolshevik Factory, constructed from parts taken from the previously purchased German 37mm anti-tank gun developed by Rheinmetall and the PS-2 gun. This system was successfully tested and the Artillery Factory No. 8 named after M. Kalinin started its <b>series</b> <b>production</b> under the designator B-3 (5K). The B-3 gun had less recoil and a smaller breech compared to the PS-2, so it could be easily mounted in the normal machine gun turret of the T-26. The first twin-turreted T-26 was armed with a B-3 gun in the right turret in late 1931. Unfortunately, <b>series</b> <b>production</b> of the B-3 gun proceeded slowly due to poor production standards (none of 225 guns produced in 1931 were accepted by army representatives; it took until 1933 to complete the original order for 300 guns placed in August 1931). Completed B-3 guns were mounted on BT-2 light tanks after mid-1932. This meant that twin-turreted T-26 tanks continued to be equipped with old 37mm Hotchkiss (PS-1) guns. As production of the PS-1 gun had ended, some guns were taken from military supply depots and scrapped MS-1(T-18) tanks.|$|E

30|$|In {{the layer}} regrouping, supposing that the commingled {{reservoir}} of n layers comes to high water-cut stage, p sets of <b>production</b> <b>series</b> are divided {{according to the}} pseudo flow resistance of each layer. p single layers are randomly selected to be the initial center of the p sets of <b>production</b> <b>series,</b> {{and the rest of}} layers are assigned into the <b>production</b> <b>series</b> where the nearest <b>production</b> <b>series</b> center locates. This is the initial division of the p sets of <b>production</b> <b>series.</b> Calculation of new centers is done to the newly allocated <b>production</b> <b>series,</b> and then the allocation of other layers is continued. After several cycles of iteration, the centers of the p sets of <b>production</b> <b>series</b> do not change any more, which means that all single layers have been allocated to their own <b>production</b> <b>series.</b> Correct clustering leads to a convergence function; otherwise, the iteration continues. A program is made to realize the optimal process.|$|R

5|$|In 1941 the Soviet Union {{decided to}} cease {{production}} of the 152 mm howitzer M1938 (M-10). One of the reasons was the disbanding of the Rifle Corps between August and September 1941 and the consequent removal of the corps artillery. Moreover, all 152mm howitzers were excluded from divisional artillery. As a result, there was no <b>series</b> <b>production</b> of 152mm howitzers during 1942.|$|E
5|$|The Duesenberg Model A was {{the first}} {{automobile}} in <b>series</b> <b>production</b> to have hydraulic brakes and the first automobile in <b>series</b> <b>production</b> in the United States with a straight-eight engine. Officially known as the Duesenberg Straight Eight, the Model A was first shown in late 1920 in New York City. Production was delayed by substantial changes {{to the design of}} the car, including a change in the engine valvetrain from horizontal overhead valves to an overhead camshaft; also during this time, the company had moved its headquarters and factory from New Jersey to Indiana. The Model A was manufactured in Indianapolis, Indiana, from 1921 to 1925 by the Duesenberg Automobiles and Motors Company and from 1925 to 1926 at the same factory by the restructured Duesenberg Motor Company. The successors to the company began referring to the car as the Model A when the Model J was introduced.|$|E

The engine had a cast iron block, a {{detachable}} cast iron cylinder head, and an aluminum lower crankcase and oil pan. The crankshaft ran in three main bearings. While the prototype Straight Eight shown at the model's introduction had horizontal valves of the type used in earlier Duesenberg-designed marine and racing engines, the model that entered production had a shaft-driven single overhead camshaft which used rockers to operate two valves per cylinder in a hemispheric combustion chamber.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{originally}} directed by Tetsuya Nomura, who also created the story concept and main character designs. Nomura {{wanted to create}} a darker Final Fantasy title unsuitable for the main series. The initial development went slowly, and by 2007 the scale of the project generated discussions about rebranding the game as the next main entry in the <b>series.</b> <b>Production</b> on Versus XIII ended in 2012, when it was rebranded as Final Fantasy XV and transferred over to the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. The PlayStation 3 version, which was originally built using the company's proprietary Crystal Tools game engine, was abandoned due to concerns about the platform's shortening life cycle. Its engine was changed to Luminous Studio, Square Enix's custom-built engine for eighth-generation gaming hardware.|$|E

5|$|The Factory No. 174 {{produced}} {{its last}} T-26 tanks in February 1941. After that, the factory began retooling {{to produce the}} new and much more complex T-50 light tank. This work was slowed by delays {{in the delivery of}} new equipment and <b>series</b> <b>production</b> of the T-50 did not begin on schedule (planned for 1 June 1941). As a result, factory management decided to resume the production of the T-26, using T-26 hulls, turrets, and other parts already in stock. About 47 T-26 tanks were assembled and 77 were repaired in July–August 1941 before the factory was relocated from Leningrad to Chelyabinsk in the end of August 1941, and then to Chkalov in September 1941. The Factory No. 174 produced engines and spare parts for the T-26, installed additional armour plates on some T-26s, replaced flame-throwers with 45mm tank guns in turrets of 130 KhT-133 flame-throwing tanks, repaired tanks in army units (846 T-26s since the beginning of 1941) and mounted about 75 turrets from the T-26 and the T-50 as bunkers for the defence of Leningrad.|$|E
5|$|The T-26-4 {{with the}} KT tank gun passed tests {{successfully}} and five vehicles {{were built in}} 1933–1934 as pilot batch. Initially it was planned to arm three of these T-26-4 with the 76.2mm KT tank gun mod. 1927/32 {{and the other two}} tanks with the 76.2mm PS-3 tank gun. The PS-3 tank gun was developed at the Experimental Engineering-Mechanical Department (OKMO) of the Factory No. 174 by engineer P. Syachentov. The PS-3 had better specifications in comparison with the series-produced KT tank gun and also had several technical innovations (foot firing switch, original training gear, travelling position fixing, binocular optical sight). The T-26-4 armed with the PS-3 tank gun was tested in October 1933 but {{it was found that the}} PS-3 was too powerful for the T-26 light tank—turret's race ring and hull roof were deformed during gun fire, and the suspension springs were damaged. It was decided to arm the T-26-4 with the 76.2mm KT tank gun only. All five experimental T-26-4 artillery tanks were tested during military exercises near Leningrad in September 1934 before scheduled <b>series</b> <b>production</b> of 50 such vehicles in 1935. But on 19 September 1934 an incident with a T-26-4 took place: a blow-back because of shell case destruction during gun fire. Despite the fact that this defect was unrelated to turret design, the military representatives cancelled the order to produce the T-26-4. Also the work to design turretless AT-1 artillery tanks armed with the powerful 76.2mm PS-3 tank gun started at that time. The T-26-4's turret construction was the design used in the series-produced BT-7A artillery tank.|$|E
5|$|The <b>series</b> <b>production</b> of the T-26, {{equipped}} with new higher turrets with observation window, began in August 1931. Such turrets {{proved to be}} more suitable for mass production. The production of the T-26 encountered many problems: a lot of armoured hulls and turrets supplied by the Izhora Factory were of low quality (with cracks) and were 10mm thick instead of the planned 13mm. Poor production standards were the reason behind the frequent failures of tank engines, gear boxes, springs in suspension, tracks and rubber-covered road wheels of early T-26s. Thirty-five of the 100 T-26s produced by the Bolshevik Factory in 1931 had hulls and turrets made from mild steel. Later, it was planned to replace these hulls with ones built of armour plate as well as to mount engines of better quality. The business plan for 1932 called for 3,000 T-26s. For this, the tank workshop of the Bolshevik Factory was reorganised into the Factory No. 174 named after K.E. Voroshilov in February 1932. The director of the tank factory became K. Sirken and the chief engineer was S. Ginzburg. The problems with organizing the complicated new technological processes, poor production planning of parts suppliers, a great shortage of qualified engineers and technicians as well as of necessary equipment still resulted in many of the tanks being flawed, and they were not accepted by army representatives. On 26 October 1932, the Trust of Special Machine Industry, consisting of four factories, was established {{to solve the problem of}} tank production in the USSR. The planned production of T-26s for 1932 was decreased significantly and special attention was given to increasing the quality of the tanks. A production run of the new model single-turreted T-26 armed with the 45mm gun was launched in mid-1933.|$|E
