50|$|On {{the first}} step of the arm, full line voltage is applied across the <b>shunt</b> <b>field.</b> Since the field {{rheostat}} is normally set to minimum resistance, the speed of the motor will not be excessive; additionally, the motor will develop a large starting torque.|$|E

50|$|A <b>shunt</b> <b>field</b> (and any series {{resistor}} used for adjustment) may be directly connected across the armature terminals {{in parallel with}} the load. Where the machine has a series compounding winding, the field may be connected at the armature side (short shunt) or load side (long shunt). The different connections give different voltage regulation characteristics on load.So as it is connected in shunt it has constant characteristics.|$|E
50|$|The {{speed of}} a DC motor can be {{increased}} by field weakening. Reducing the field strength is done by inserting resistance in series with a <b>shunt</b> <b>field,</b> or inserting resistances around a series-connected field winding, to reduce current in the field winding. When the field is weakened, the back-emf reduces, so a larger current flows through the armature winding and this increases the speed. Field weakening is not used on its own but {{in combination with other}} methods, such as series-parallel control.|$|E
50|$|A {{compound}} DC motor {{connects the}} armature and fields windings in a shunt {{and a series}} combination to give it characteristics of both a shunt and a series DC motor. This motor is used when both a high starting torque and good speed regulation is needed. The motor can be connected in two arrangements: cumulatively or differentially. Cumulative compound motors connect the series field to aid the <b>shunt</b> <b>field,</b> which provides higher starting torque but less speed regulation. Differential compound DC motors have good speed regulation and are typically operated at constant speed.|$|E
40|$|We study a model {{describing}} electronic transport in a weakly-coupled semiconductor superlattice with a shunting side layer. Key parameters {{include the}} lateral {{size of the}} superlattice, the connectivity between the quantum wells of the superlattice and the shunt layer, and the conduction properties of the shunt layer. For a superlattice with small lateral extent and high quality <b>shunt,</b> static electric <b>field</b> domains are suppressed and a spatially-uniform field configuration is predicted to be stable, a result that may be useful for proposed devices such as a superlattice-based TeraHertz (THz) oscillators. As the lateral size of the superlattice increases, the uniform field configuration loses its stability to either static or dynamic field domains, regardless of shunt properties. A lower quality shunt generally leads to regular and chaotic current oscillations and complex spatio-temporal dynamics in the field profile. Bifurcations separating static and dynamic behaviors are characterized and found {{to be dependent on}} the shunt properties. Comment: 14 pages, 15 figures, submitte...|$|R
40|$|The {{rotating}} arc welding of the pipes (ROTARC) use a rotating electric arc for heating the extremities of two pipes, which turns {{due to the}} electromagnetic force created between the arc column (which is equivalent to a non-fixed wire through which an electric current passes along an axial direction) and a magnetic field having a constant intensity conducted along the radial direction. Within the “Pressure Welding Technologies ” laboratory in “Dunărea de Jos ” University- Galaţi both magnetising systems have been manufactured and tested, redesigned and experimented for several variants and original technical solutions have been found. First the work presents the principle of ROTARC welding and several original equipment developed by the team. Then, a classic longitudinal magnetising system and some results and conclusions of the experiments are presented. It is pointed out the classic displacement of the arc into {{the gap between the}} extremities; the only obvious disadvantage of this magnetising system is the pull out of the pipes into the fixing systems, which is only possible along the axial direction. The results lead to the conclusions that the transversal magnetising systems present both constructive and practical utility problems. The lateral displacement of the system against the gap is not enough due to the low value of the magnetic field. Beside the doubling of the transversal system (the symmetrical left-right arrangement against the gap) it is also necessary: to increase the magnetising current; and the number of the coil turns or to decrease the <b>shunt</b> magnetic <b>fields</b> through the fixing system which forms the support of the magnetising system. The solution is to use diamagnetic materials. The systems were designed, developed and experimented in the laboratories of the “Robotics an...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a thorough thermal study on {{a fleet of}} DC traction motors which were found to suffer from overheating after 3 years of full operation. Overheating of these traction motors is attributed {{partly because of the}} higher than expected number of starts and stops between train terminals. Another probable cause of overheating is the design of the traction motor and/or its control strategy. According to the motor manufacturer, a current shunt is permanently connected across the motor field winding. Hence, some of the armature current is bypassed into the current shunt. The motor then runs above its rated speed in the field weakening mode. In this study, a finite difference model has been developed to simulate the temperature profile at different parts inside the traction motor. In order to validate the simulation result, an empty vehicle loaded with drums of water was also used to simulate the full pay-load of a light rail vehicle experimentally. The authors report that the simulation results agree reasonably well with experimental data, and {{it is likely that the}} armature of the traction motor will run cooler if its <b>field</b> <b>shunt</b> is disconnected at low speed...|$|R

50|$|A Ward Leonard {{control is}} usually used for {{controlling}} a shunt or compound wound DC motor, and {{developed as a}} method of providing a speed-controlled motor from an AC supply, though it is not without its advantages in DC schemes. The AC supply is used to drive an AC motor, usually an induction motor that drives a DC generator or dynamo. The DC output from the armature is directly connected to the armature of the DC motor (sometimes but not always of identical construction). The <b>shunt</b> <b>field</b> windings of both DC machines are independently excited through variable resistors. Extremely good speed control from standstill to full speed, and consistent torque, can be obtained by varying the generator and/or motor field current. This method of control was the de facto method from its development until it was superseded by solid state thyristor systems. It found service in almost any environment where good speed control was required, from passenger lifts through to large mine pit head winding gear and even industrial process machinery and electric cranes. Its principal disadvantage was that three machines were required to implement a scheme (five in very large installations, as the DC machines were often duplicated and controlled by a tandem variable resistor). In many applications, the motor-generator set was often left permanently running, to avoid the delays that would otherwise be caused by starting it up as required. Although electronic (thyristor) controllers have replaced most small to medium Ward-Leonard systems, some very large ones (thousands of horsepower) remain in service. The field currents are much lower than the armature currents, allowing a moderate sized thyristor unit to control a much larger motor than it could control directly. For example, in one installation, a 300 amp thyristor unit controls the field of the generator. The generator output current is in excess of 15,000 amperes, which would be prohibitively expensive (and inefficient) to control directly with thyristors.|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1971 This thesis {{develops}} a simulation {{model for a}} cumulative connected compound direct-current generator to varify the operation of this machine under conditions of slowly and rapidly changing loads. The application of this simulation method will contribute to more exact modeling of power system components. The accuracy gained is {{in the area of}} magnitude and time of response of the d-c generator and other systems with which it is a component for simulation. The simulation uses a table look-up method for the representation of the series field and the armature winding. The first inductance is called subtransient and it represented the effective inductance over a specified length of time called the time of influence. " The second inductance is used after the time of influence has elapsed, and is called the transient inductance. The <b>shunt</b> <b>field</b> representation is in terms of a subtransient inductance, transient inductance and a time of influence of the subtransient inductance. The mathematical representation of these parameters is expressed as a linear function of the total resistance in the <b>shunt</b> <b>field</b> circuit, The simulation of the nonlinear generator was programmed in Fortran IV. The program for simulation was based upon an iterative solution to facilitate the integration procedures and the nonlinear component representations.

The articulated truck/bogie design allowed very smooth running {{with none of the}} horizontal movement characteristic of non-articulated equipment. Although they were streamlined, the sets were not permitted to run faster than conventional North Shore equipment. From the front passenger seat adjacent to the motorman's half cab, if the door was propped open, a passenger could see the speedometer pegged at 90 mph on the long stretch between Dempster Street and North Chicago Junction. When the sets were received in 1941, during one test run the traction motors were allowed full <b>field</b> <b>shunt</b> to determine absolute maximum speed. It reached just over 110 mph, but at that speed the train reached highway crossings before the crossing gates fully closed, a dangerous situation. Thereafter, the sets were limited to 90 mph.|$|R
40|$|Since 2000, a {{relatively}} new electric thruster concept has been in research, development, and production at Thales Electron Devices in Germany. This High Efficiency Multistage Plasma Thruster, or HEMPT, has promising lifetime capabilities due to its plasma confinement system. However, the permanent magnet system that offers this and other benefits also creates a hollow plume, where ions are accelerated at angles rather than up the thruster centerline, causing a dip in ion current along the centerline. A laboratory model, built at JPL, was run at Cal Poly to characterize this plume shape and implement a shield to restore a conical shape to the plume. A similar solution was used on {{a different type of}} thruster, a cylindrical hall thruster, at Princeton with excellent results. A shield was designed to <b>shunt</b> the magnetic <b>field</b> outside the thruster, where the Princeton experiments have identified a radial magnetic field as the cause for this hollow plume. The thruster was run with and without the shield, taking measurements of the ion current in the plume using a linear probe drive. The shield fixed the plume shape, increasing centerline current by 48 %, however it also had detrimental effects on thruster performance, causing a decrease in thrust, specific impulse, and cut the total efficiency in half. The shield design was reexamined and a new design has been suggested for future testing of the HEMPT to restore performance while still fixing the plume shape...|$|R

ICIS produces highly ionised metal-dominated plasma inside a high power pulsed RF-coil with a magnet free high voltage pulsed DC powered cathode. ICIS operation with magnetic target materials has not been attempted so far.

The normal Fe response is subtracted with the use of M-H loops taken above Tc and the remaining magnetization suppression of the MgB 2 is described in terms of <b>field</b> <b>shunting</b> in the Fe 2 ̆ 2 shield 2 ̆ 2. The level of Fe shielding, both of regions outside of the sample from the MgB 2, as well as the MgB 2 from the outside is discussed, the latter is quantified in terms of a M.

It is seen that this ^B effect can be phenomenologically modelled as a pseudo-Meissner effect. Direct measurements of hysteretic loss vs applied field sweep amplitude, Hm, give a pseudo-Meissner field, HPS 1, of 2 kOe for the round wire sample in reasonable agreement with calculation. The hysteretic loss above HpSl (and below the penetration field) was found to fit well to an expression proportional to (H-HPS 1) 3.

The curve following shows the external characteristic of the dynamo. In obtaining the data for this curve the dynamo was run at constant speed. The rheostat in the <b>shunt</b> <b>field</b> was adjusted so that a voltmeter placed across the terminals reads 110 volts when the dynamo is running without load. The position of the rheostat arm is not changed during the test. A variable resistance and an ammeter are placed in the external circuit. The resistance is decreased, thus increasing the load until the limit of the machine is reached. Readings are taken simultaneously of line amperes and terminal volts for a number of intermediate points. This data is plotted with terminal volts as ordinates and line amperes as abscissas. The object of compounding a dynamo is to maintain a constant voltage at some point on the circuit. The voltage of a shunt dynamo gradually falls as the load increases, therefore in order to maintain a constant potential regulation of the rheostat would be necessary. By compounding the regulation is automatic and no adjustment of the rheostat is necessary...|$|E
