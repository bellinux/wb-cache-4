40|$|Meat is an {{important}} part of human diet. However, health problems occur when meat consumption is excessive and if meat is processed and prepared in unhealthy way. The aim of the presented thesis is to determine the difference in habits of meat and meat products consumption of the Slovenian population in different geographical areas. The data were collected through the research Nutritional habits of the adult population in Slovenia, conducted by the National Institute of Public Health. The research comprised 1193 adult residents of Slovenia. In the empirical part of the thesis the frequency of different kind of meat and processed meat products consumption was studied in detail. The sample comprised Slovenian residents of 3 geographical regions of Slovenia: western, central and eastern. Differences on meat and meat products consumption have been noted, particularly due to geographic characteristics of meat production and processing. In western region people consume more fish, seafood and ham, while in the eastern region more pork meat is consumed. Furthermore, there were trends of more frequent meat consumption identified in the Central <b>region</b> of <b>Slovenia.</b> In <b>all</b> <b>regions</b> offal, rabbit and sheep meat are less often consumed. In eastern and central region also the consumption of fish meat is lowered. The unprocessed poultry, beef and veal are most commonly consumed in western region of Slovenia. Finally, to make recommendations regarding the consumption of meat and meat products, particularly in relation to the health risk, it is necessary to carry out more detailed studies on the intake of meat and meat products by the population of Slovenia. ...|$|R

5000|$|The {{existing}} Slovenian rails, {{which were}} mostly {{built in the}} 19th century, are out-of-date and can't compete with the motorway network. The maintenance and modernisation of the Slovenian railway network has been neglected {{due to the lack}} of financial assets, creating bottlenecks. Nevertheless, it has been gaining momentum with the completion of the motorway cross. The Slovenian Railways company operates 1229 km of [...] standard gauge tracks, 331 km as double track, and reaches <b>all</b> <b>regions</b> of the country. The network comprises main lines and regional lines. Electrification is provided by a 3 kV DC system, except at the junctions with railways of foreign countries, and covers 503.5 km. Due to the out-of-date infrastructure, the share of the railway freight transport has been in decline in Slovenia despite growing slightly in absolute terms. The railway passenger transport has been recovering after a large drop in the 1990s. The Pan-European railway corridors V and X, and several E-railways (E65, E67, E69, and E70) intersect in <b>Slovenia.</b> <b>All</b> international transit trains in Slovenia drive through the Ljubljana Railway Hub, and all international passenger trains stop there.|$|R
