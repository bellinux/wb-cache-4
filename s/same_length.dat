5|$|The son of Seti, Ramesses the Great, {{constructed}} a massive tomb, KV7, {{but it is}} in a ruinous state. It is currently undergoing excavation and conservation by a Franco-Egyptian team led by Christian Leblanc. The tomb is vast in size, about the <b>same</b> <b>length,</b> and a larger area, of the tomb of his father.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the area}} of a curve is reduced at a {{constant}} rate, and (by the isoperimetric inequality) a circle has the greatest possible area among simple closed curves of a given length, it follows that circles are the slowest curves to collapse to a point under the curve-shortening flow. All other curves take less time to collapse than a circle of the <b>same</b> <b>length.</b>|$|E

50|$|Let's call a map {{projection}} locally conformal {{in a small}} domain on the earth if any angle in the domain is preserved {{in the image of}} the projection. Then any figure in the domain are nearly similar to the image on the map. This means that <b>same</b> <b>lengths</b> in the small domain are drawn as <b>same</b> <b>lengths</b> on the map (regardless of directions). Thus the projection in the small domain can be approximated by an isometric transformation. The Tissot's indicatrix of the projection around the domain is a circle.|$|R

5|$|Decimal {{fractions}} can {{be added}} by a simple modification of the above process. One aligns two decimal fractions above each other, with the decimal point in the same location. If necessary, one can add trailing zeros to a shorter decimal {{to make it the}} <b>same</b> <b>length</b> as the longer decimal. Finally, one performs the same addition process as above, except the decimal point is placed in the answer, exactly where it was placed in the summands.|$|E
5|$|In 1953, {{efforts to}} remove the road from Mecca to the highway from Blythe to Indio, from the state highway system were met with {{community}} opposition, since it served as an alternate route for the other highway. State Senator Nelson Dilworth proposed legislation to require the road from Banning through Idyllwild to Mountain Center {{to be added to}} the state highway system if SR 195 was removed, as the two were of roughly the <b>same</b> <b>length,</b> but the latter remained in the system.|$|E
5|$|Long hair is a hairstyle {{where the}} head hair {{is allowed to}} grow to {{considerable}} length. Exactly what constitutes long hair can change from culture to culture, or even within cultures. For example, a woman with chin-length hair in some cultures {{may be said to}} have short hair, while a man with the <b>same</b> <b>length</b> of hair in some of the same cultures would be said to have long hair.|$|E

40|$|Bounds for {{discrete}} Chebychev functionals {{that involve}} means of sequences of different lengths are investigated {{in the current}} article. Earlier bounds for the Chebychev functional involving sums of sequences of the <b>same</b> <b>lengths</b> are utilised in the current development. Weighted generalised Chebychev functionals are also examined...|$|R

5|$|The luteal {{phase of}} the menstrual cycle is about the <b>same</b> <b>length</b> in most {{individuals}} (mean 14.13 days, SD 1.41 days) whereas the follicular phase tends to show much more variability (log-normally distributed with 95% of individuals having follicular phases between 10.3 and 16.3 days). The follicular phase also seems to get significantly shorter with age (geometric mean 14.2 days in women aged 18–24 vs. 10.4 days in women aged 40–44).|$|E
5|$|The many stamens are {{arranged}} in two series, which is a distinctive characteristic of the genus. The inner stamens are fused at the base to form a short tubular structure. The outer stamens arise from along the floral tube. The style is usually dark red and has a stigma with 6–8 lobes; the style plus stigma is roughly the <b>same</b> <b>length</b> as the stamens. If the flower is fertilized, a fleshy fruit forms, either smooth or with ribs. The brown or black seeds are about 1mm in diameter.|$|E
5|$|Though {{a myriad}} of bones was {{available}} by 1969, many important ones were missing or hard to interpret. There were few postorbital skull elements, no femurs, no sacrum, no furcula or sternum, missing vertebrae, and (Ostrom thought) only a tiny fragment of a coracoid. Ostrom's skeletal reconstruction of Deinonychus included a very unusual pelvic bone– a pubis that was trapezoidal and flat, unlike that of other theropods, but which was the <b>same</b> <b>length</b> as the ischium and which was found right next to it.|$|E
50|$|The {{overall length}} of a Model 1885 with a 28-inch barrel is the <b>same</b> basic <b>length</b> as a Winchester bolt-action Model 70 with a 24-inch barrel.

5|$|All {{terminals}} and hangars were on {{the square}} periphery. By the late 1970s, the shorter north–south and east–west runway pairs had been closed, though some were converted to taxiways. The other four runways remain in use, all strengthened and enhanced, but about the <b>same</b> <b>lengths</b> as always. A short runway (13R/31L) for light aircraft was added in 1989.|$|R
5|$|Art {{historian}} Robert Koch remarked in 1988 on {{the similarity}} of provenance, material, technique, tone and colour of the four works described by Eastlake. He proposed that they were intended as wings of a five-part polyptych altarpiece. Based on the format of Bouts' 1464–67 Altar of Holy Sacrament, whose four wing panels are the <b>same</b> <b>length</b> as The Entombment, he believes the altarpiece would have comprised a large central panel with four works half its length and width positioned two at either side. His speculative reconstruction places The Entombment on the upper right-hand wing, above the Adoration.|$|E
5|$|Both the Red Sox and Cardinals {{made the}} playoffs the {{following}} season. The Red Sox lost to the eventual champions the Chicago White Sox, in the American League Division Series. The Cardinals, in a repeat meeting of the previous season's National League Championship Series, lost to the Houston Astros. However, the city of Boston would see more success when the New England Patriots won Super Bowl XXXIX, {{three months after the}} Red Sox won the World Series, giving the greater Boston area its third championship in 12 months, making it the first time since 1980 that any city had two Super Bowl winners and a World Series winner in a period of the <b>same</b> <b>length.</b>|$|E
5|$|In road {{snow and}} ice control, brine is often used as an anti-icer rather than a de-icer. A vehicle carries a tank of brine, which is sprayed on the road surface before or {{at the onset of}} the storm. This keeps {{snow and ice}} from {{adhering}} to the surface and makes mechanical removal by plows easier. Solid salt is also wetted with brine or other liquid deicer. This speeds de-icing action and helps keep it from bouncing off the pavement into the gutter or ditch. Brine acts faster than solid salt and does not require compression by passing traffic to become effective. The brine is also more environmentally friendly, as less salt is required to treat the <b>same</b> <b>length</b> of road.|$|E

The main focus of this work is a comparison of three alternate proofs, to show the links between Toponogov’s Comparison Theorem, Legendre’s Theorem and Cauchy’s Arm Lemma. ...|$|R
50|$|Conformal maps {{containing}} large regions vary scales by locations, so it {{is difficult}} to compare lengths or areas. But there are some techniques such that a length of 1 degree on a meridian = 111 km = 60 nautical mile. In non-conformal maps, you can not use the techniques because <b>same</b> <b>lengths</b> at a point vary the lengths on the map by the directions.|$|R
5|$|The {{armoured}} belt {{consisted of}} face-hardened Krupp cemented armour (KC), arranged in three strakes. The main waterline belt was 12inches (305mm) thick between 'A' and 'Y' barbettes and thinned to 5 to 6inches (127 to 152mm) towards the ship's ends, {{but did not}} reach either the bow or the stern. The middle armour belt had a maximum thickness of 7inches (178mm) over the <b>same</b> <b>length</b> as the thickest part of the waterline armour and thinned to five inches abreast 'A' barbette. The upper belt was 5inches thick amidships and extended forward to 'A' barbette, with a short 4-inch (102mm) extension aft.|$|E
5|$|This is {{a variant}} of the special purpose weapon adopted by USSOCOM. The program, which led to both the Mk 46 and Mk 48, was headed by the US Naval Special Warfare Command (NAVSPECWAR). Like the SPW, the barrel {{changing}} handle, magazine insertion well, and vehicle mounting lugs have been removed to save weight. However, the Mk 46 retains the standard M249 plastic buttstock instead of the collapsible buttstock used on the SPW. The Picatinny rail forearm differs slightly from the SPW. The Mk 46 has the option of using the lighter SPW barrel or a thicker, fluted barrel of the <b>same</b> <b>length.</b>|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of the line's planning, Downtown Flushing was a quiet Dutch-colonial-style village; what is now Roosevelt Avenue in the area was known as Amity Street, a major {{commercial}} thoroughfare in the neighborhood. In late 1912, Flushing community groups were petitioning the Public Service Commission (PSC) to depress the proposed line in Flushing into a subway tunnel, rather than an elevated line. Unlike a subway, an el would cause disturbances to the quality of life and a loss in nearby property values, as well as a widening of Amity Street that would cause more changes to the already existing town. One Amity Street property owner compared the planned effect of an elevated Flushing Line on Amity Street to the degradation of Myrtle Avenue in Brooklyn after the Myrtle Avenue Elevated was built there. On the other hand, a subway would only require that the street be widened, even though it was more expensive than an elevated of the <b>same</b> <b>length.</b>|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{prove that the}} space of flat metrics (nonpositively curved Euclidean cone metrics) on a closed, {{oriented}} surface is marked length spectrally rigid. In other words, two flat metrics assigning the <b>same</b> <b>lengths</b> to all closed curves differ by an isometry isotopic to the identity. The novel proof suggests a stronger rigidity result for flat metrics. Comment: 18 pages, 6 figure...|$|R

The code resulting from numerically (re-)ordered input is sometimes called the canonical Huffman code and is often the code used in practice, due to ease of encoding/decoding. The technique for finding this code is sometimes called Huffman-Shannon-Fano coding, since it is optimal like Huffman coding, but alphabetic in weight probability, like Shannon-Fano coding.

5|$|Following the takeover, a new {{stationmaster}}'s {{house was}} built at Sea Mills, {{at a cost of}} £240. The stationmaster is recorded as having kept a variety of farm animals and sold eggs to passengers. Increased levels of traffic saw the line through Sea Mills doubled in the early 1900s, and the opportunity was taken to rebuild the station. A second platform opened on 6 January 1907 {{to the west of the}} tracks to serve northbound trains. The original platform now exclusively served southbound trains, and was lengthened to , the <b>same</b> <b>length</b> as the new platform. A station building was constructed on the original platform in a domestic style, with an arched terracotta entrance, spar-covered walls and a high-pitched tiled roof. The building contained a booking hall, booking office, toilets and a ladies' waiting room. A smaller building on the northbound platform contained a general waiting room. The subway under the bridge over the River Trym was also built at this time, with the porter's job being expanded to include washing the rubbish out of the subway after high tide, for which the railway provided a hosepipe and Wellington boots. By 1910 there were 17 trains from Bristol to Avonmouth and 15 back, increasing to 21 and 19 respectively by 1920, though not all stopped at Sea Mills. The station was completely closed on Sundays.|$|E
5|$|For {{the three}} {{sections}} of the ride where wrap-around projection is used, each robotic arm continues its steady movement on the track but is met by its own individual parabolic projection screen and projector traveling {{at exactly the same}} pace. Each projection section uses a huge turntable with six of these enormous screens mounted facing outwards - one for each robotic arm as they pass by - and each screen is large enough that when in front of each ride bench its edges cannot be seen. The screens appear and disappear behind the edges of the physical sets. The robotic arms can then freely dive, turn and pivot each ride bench within the curved area, giving the illusion of extreme movement when synchronized with the projection, whilst the base of the arm on the track simply follows the slow circular path that each screen takes as it revolves. This is why each projection section of the ride is approximately the <b>same</b> <b>length,</b> as each ride arm must follow each identically-sized projection screen turntable for a set period of time.|$|E
5|$|In frogs, the {{hind legs}} {{are larger than}} the fore legs, {{especially}} so in those species that principally move by jumping or swimming. In the walkers and runners the hind limbs are not so large, and the burrowers mostly have short limbs and broad bodies. The feet have adaptations for the way of life, with webbing between the toes for swimming, broad adhesive toe pads for climbing, and keratinised tubercles on the hind feet for digging (frogs usually dig backwards into the soil). In most salamanders, the limbs are short and {{more or less the}} <b>same</b> <b>length</b> and project at right angles from the body. Locomotion on land is by walking and the tail often swings from side to side or is used as a prop, particularly when climbing. In their normal gait, only one leg is advanced at a time in the manner adopted by their ancestors, the lobe-finned fish. Some salamanders in the genus Aneides and certain plethodontids climb trees and have long limbs, large toepads and prehensile tails. In aquatic salamanders and in frog tadpoles, the tail has dorsal and ventral fins and is moved from side to side as a means of propulsion. Adult frogs do not have tails and caecilians have only very short ones.|$|E
