5000|$|SPS at {{the time}} was a {{prominent}} maker of shaft hangers and collars, the latter of which were set in place with set screws. In pursuit of headless set screws with a better drive than a <b>straight</b> <b>slot,</b> Hallowell said, SPS had sourced set screws of square-socket drive from Britain, but they were very expensive. (This was only 2 years after Robertson's Canadian patent.) This cost problem drove SPS to purchase its first screw machine and make its screws in-house, which soon led to SPS's foray into fastener sales (for which it later became well known within the metalworking industries). Hallowell said that [...] "for a while we experimented with a screw containing a square hole like the British screw but soon found these would not be acceptable in this country U.S.. Then we decided to incorporate a hexagon socket into the screw …." [...] Hallowell does not elaborate on why SPS found that the square hole [...] "would not be acceptable in this country", but it seems likely that it would have to have involved licensing Robertson's patent, which would have defeated SPS's purpose of driving down its cost for internal-wrenching screws (and may have been unavailable at any price, as explained at [...] "List of screw drives > Robertson"). The story, if any, of whether SPS's methods required licensing of Allen's 1910 patent is not addressed by Hallowell's memoir. The book does not mention which method—cold forming or linear broaching—was used by SPS in these earliest years. If the latter was used, then Allen's patent would not have been relevant.|$|E
5000|$|Headless {{set screws}} {{have been around}} for a long time, with the <b>straight</b> <b>slot</b> being the oldest drive type (due to its ease of machining), but the demand for {{headless}} set screws experienced a marked increase in the first and second decades of the 20th century, when a penchant for better industrial safety, a campaign with the slogan [...] "safety first", swept the industrialized nations of North America and Europe as a part of the larger Progressive Movement. This surge in safety consciousness was a backlash against the often-atrocious industrial safety standards of the era. H.T. Hallowell, Sr., a U.S. industrialist whose corporation was one of several that pioneered the commercialization of the hex socket drive, noted in his memoir that line shafting, which was [...] in the industrial practice of the time, often had headed set screws (with external-wrenching square drive) holding the many pulleys to the line shafts, and collars holding the shafts from axial movement. Gear trains of exposed gears were also common at the time, and those, too, often used headed set screws, holding the gears to the shafts. His company's chief products at the time were shaft hangers and shaft collars of pressed-steel construction. The [...] "safety craze" [...] created a burgeoning demand for headless set screws on pulleys, gears, and collars to replace the headed ones, so that workers' clothing and fingers were less likely to catch on the exposed rotating screw head. It was this heightened demand that prompted Hallowell's firm to get into the screw-making business and to explore socket-head drive designs. With P.L. Robertson holding fresh patent rights on a practical-to-make square-socket drive, the firm soon pursued the hex socket drive.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—A {{technique}} {{for reducing the}} dimensions of the cavity of a cavity-backed slot antenna (CBSA) is presented, which facilitates proper fabrication and integration of miniaturized slot antennas on multilayer substrates. This is accomplished by replacing the solid metal around the traditional slot antennas with a specific metallic pattern that {{can be viewed as a}} series of parallel strip lines placed around the slot antenna. This metallic pattern is then modified by designing the parallel strips in a compact fashion to reduce the overall antenna dimensions and obtain a reduced-size CBSA. It is shown that, for a simple <b>straight</b> <b>slot</b> antenna, the overall occupied volume of the modified cavity backing the slot antenna can be reduced by more than 65 % without affecting the high radiation efficiency of the antenna. A number of traditional cavity backed slot antennas and the proposed modified CBSAs are designed, fabricated, and measured. The reduced-size CBSAs show a very low input VSWR, low cross-polarized radiation levels, and high radiation efficiency.

In this research, cutting force trends and tool wear effects in ramp cut machining are experimentally observed as machining progresses.;Ramp cuts are unique {{in the sense that}} the depth of cut is continuously changing. Traditionally, a series of <b>straight</b> <b>slot</b> cuts are used to machine a deep slot. Ramp cuts in which the depth of cut is continuously changing offers an alternative. Cutting force signals, table motor currents, spindle motor currents, and tool wear in ramp cuts are experimentally observed and compared to the results of straight cuts. Trends in X, Y, and Z cutting forces for straight and ramp cuts are compared.;Tool wear and its identification and estimation are a fundamental problem in machining. With tool wear there is an increase in cutting forces, and leads to deterioration in process stability, part accuracy, and surface finish. Cutting forces using new tools are compared with cutting forces obtained from a progressively wearing tool. The wavelet transform is used for signal processing and is found to be useful for observing cutting force trends.;The Root Mean Square (RMS) value of the wavelet transformed signal and linear regression are used for tool wear estimation.

40|$|Efforts {{to reduce}} the {{physical}} dimension of an antenna have been vigorously studied for many decades. Through the collection of such efforts, the effects of size reduction {{on the performance of}} an antenna are fairly well understood matters in present day. The fundamental limitations established by Wheeler and Chu have been referenced as theoretical guidelines for acquiring smaller antenna size at the expense of radiation resistance, antenna Q (bandwidth) and polarization. While performance degradation is inevitable using contemporary materials as a resonant antenna volume decreases, it is still possible to overcome this restriction by taking a different route. Techniques such as facilitation of mutual coupling effects of parasitic elements, utilization of transistors, capacitive and inductive loading methods and artificial materials are now employed to mitigate and curb the inverse relationship between antenna volume and performance. This dissertation continues the path of designing fully integrated, electrically small antennas in a controlled manner. The contributions of this dissertation include: A method {{to reduce the}} dimension of a cavity-backed slot antenna is synthesized. For a simple <b>straight</b> <b>slot</b> antenna, this technique can reduce the overall occupied volume of the modified cavity backing the slot antenna by more than 65 % without effecting the high radiation effciency of the antenna. This facilitates proper fabrication and integration of miniaturized slot antennas on multi-layer substrates. A platform-integrated low-profile antenna with high isolation levels to its environment is reported. Through this approach, complex package-level designs and simulations can be greatly simplified as the antenna exhibits similar behavior when integrated as it does in open-space. The method enables the realization of unidirectional cavity-backed slot antennas with heights less than lambda/ 100, minimizing surface intrusion or protrusion for platform antenna implementations. An infinitesimal electric dipole radiating vertical polarization with less than lambda/ 100 height is realized. The theoretical equivalence relation between a short electric dipole and a magnetic loop at resonance is valid under the following preconditions: 1) The existence of uniform in-phase magnetic current, 2) Impedance matching to the low radiation resistance of the magnetic loop.

40|$|Gas turbine {{development}} {{has been in the}} direction of increased turbine inlet temperatures to improve efficiency and power output. As a result the allowable metal temperatures of the alloys used for the turbine airfoils and endwalls are exceeded such that the surfaces have to be protected from the hot gases by cooling. Bypassed leakage flows emerging from a slot between the combustor and turbine component endwalls can be utilized for cooling purposes. In order to improve this cooling method the complex flow structures in a turbine have to be considered as they enhance the heat transfer and convect hot core flow gases onto component surfaces. In this thesis four film cooling configurations using this slot which differ from each other in terms of geometrical aspects are examined {{with the help of the}} flow solver TRACE (Turbomachinery Research Aerodynamics Computational Environment) developed at the Institute of Propulsion Technology of the German Aerospace Center. Furthermore, in the present study the amount of coolant ejected is varied by adjusting the blowing ratio. Additionally the shape of the leakage slot is tailored to take the pressure distribution in front of the leading edge into account. The results are analysed with respect to film cooling effectiveness and the surface heat transfer. The results are mainly influenced by the three-dimensional flow structures visualized with the streamwise vorticity. The results obtained for the <b>straight</b> <b>slot</b> show for all mass flow ratios an intensified ejection of coolant in the center of the passage due to the wall pressure distribution. Furthermore, the coolant is not only concentrated in the center of the passage but also “trapped” between the two legs of the horseshoe vortex, where the coolant air is scraped away from the endwall in the region of the separation lines. With increasing mass flow rate of the coolant one realizes a broader area of the endwall covered by the coolant. By adapting the contour of the slot concerning the pressure distribution in front of the leading edge the coolant is enabled to leave the slot in a much more uniform manner. This way a better cooling around the leading edge region and the juncture of the blade’s pressure side and the endwall is achieved. Thus, not only the need for complex cooling hole layouts next to the critical areas can be minimized but also the number of cooling holes and thus the amount of coolant can be reduced...|$|E

40|$|A nonlinear, four wall, {{post-test}} wall interference assessment/correction (WIAC) {{code was}} developed for transonic airfoil data from solid wall wind tunnels with flexibly adaptable top and bottom walls. The WIAC code was applied over {{a broad range of}} test conditions to four sets of NACA 0012 airfoil data, from two different adaptive wall wind tunnels. The data include many test points for fully adapted walls, as well as numerous partially adapted and unadapted test points, which together represent many different model/tunnel configurations and possible wall interference effects. Small corrections to the measured Mach numbers and angles of attack were obtained from the WIAC code even for fully adapted data; these corrections generally improve the correlation among the various sets of airfoil data and simultaneously improve the correlation of the data with calculations for a 2 -D, free air, Navier-Stokes code. The WIAC corrections for airfoil data taken in fully adapted wall test sections are shown to be significantly smaller than those for comparable airfoil data from <b>straight,</b> <b>slotted</b> wall test sections.

In one configuration, the Linear Slot Virtual Impactor (LSVI), the nozzle was a <b>straight</b> <b>slot</b> having a length of 89 mm (3. 5 "). In the second configuration, the Circumferential Slot Virtual Impactor (CSVI), the nozzle was curvilinear following a circular path having a diameter of 152. 4 mm (6. 0 ") and the resulting total slot length was 479 mm (18. 8 "). Multiple prototypes of the two configurations were constructed having nozzle widths that varied from 0. 508 mm (0. 015 ") to 0. 203 mm (0. 008 "). Optical and physical measurements were made of the nozzle dimensions in the critical region of the virtual impactor units. For the LSVI units the misalignment between the acceleration nozzle and the receiver nozzle was measured between 6 ?m (0. 00025 ") and 29 ?m (0. 00114 "). This represented a range of 2 % to 10 % misalignment relative to the acceleration nozzle width. The CSVI Unit 1 and 2 misalignments were measured to be 15 ?m (0. 00061 ") and 9 ?m (0. 00036 "), or 10 % and 1. 8 % relative misalignment, respectively. The virtual impactors were tested with liquid and solid monodisperse aerosol particles. For operation at flow rate conditions predicted from the literature to produce a cutpoint of 0. 8 ?m AD, an acoustic resonance was observed, corresponding to significant nozzle wall losses of particles and an absence of normal particle separation in the virtual impactor. The onset of the resonance phenomenon was observed to begin at a nozzle Reynolds number of approximately 500 for the LSVI configuration, and 300 for the CSVI configuration. For flow rates just below the onset of resonance, normal virtual impactor behavior was observed. The value of Stk 50 was 0. 58 for both devices, corresponding to a particle cutpoint size of 1. 1 ?m AD for the LSVI configuration and 2. 2 ?m AD for the CSVI. The collection efficiency was greater than 72 % for all particle sizes larger than twice the cutpoint up to the largest particle size tested (? 10 ?m AD).

Measurements of 0. 5 MHz shear wave levels propagated in 25 -mm-thick steel plate embedded in concrete showed 1. 4 - 1. 6 dB of signal loss for each centimeter of two-way travel in the steel plate (compared to previous numerical predictions of 3 - 4 dB), and 1. 3 dB of signal loss per centimeter of two-way travel in steel plates embedded in concrete prior to setting of the concrete (i. e., plastic). Negligible losses were measured in plates with a decoupling treatment applied between the steel and concrete to simulate the unbonded portions of the pressure boundary. Scattered signals from <b>straight</b> <b>slots</b> of different size and shape were investigated. The return from a 4 -mm-deep rectangular slots exhibited levels 23 dB down relative to incidence and 4 - 6 dB higher than those obtained from both ''v'' shaped and rounded slots of similar depth. The system displayed an input/output dynamic range of 125 dB and measurement variability less than 1 - 2 dB. Based on these results, a 4 -mm-deep, rounded degradation embedded 30 cm in concrete has expected returns of - 73 dB relative to the input and should therefore be detectable. Results of this and a prior study indicate that the technique has merit and should be developed more fully and demonstrated in the field...|$|R
40|$|We have {{developed}} a low temperature SuperConducting Quantum Interference Device - SQUID measurement system for detection of defects deep {{under the surface of}} aluminum structures using eddy current techniques. The system uses a two dimensional planar inducer with two different excitation frequencies to induce a current in the sample. We {{have developed}} a data analysis software program that enabled us to distinguish between round defects (holes), <b>straight</b> defects (<b>slots)</b> and slots close to holes simulating cracks starting from rivets in aluminum structures. We were able to detect defects that are 8 mm below the surface. We have also measured the change in phase of the detected signal as a function of depth of the defect. This relationship can be used to determine the depth of hidden flaws. Using this analysis software with the high temperature SQUID system at NASA Langley we were able to detect slots close to holes in layered aluminum sample...|$|R

The <b>slot</b> {{for the second}} finalist came down to wire being decided in the last league match between India and Zimbabwe. India had to beat Zimbabwe to equal their points tally. They also needed to chase down the target set by Zimbabwe within 40.5 overs to ensure a slot in the Finals {{on the basis of}} Net run rate. India managed to chase the target within 40 overs thereby, moving into the Finals. South Africa beat India in the Finals to clinch the trophy.|$|R
