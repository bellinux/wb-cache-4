40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to broaden current knowledge of the strength and buckling/collapse of shells, with special reference to steel silo structures on discrete supports, and thus to provide design guidance of practical value for future silo design and construction and to develop new research aspects for further investigation. A linear elastic solution of the cylindrical shell bending equations is presented for local loadings, with special attention to local longitudinal distributed loadings. Algebraic expressions for the displacements and stresses induced by a rectangular patch of longitudinal load on a simply supported cylindrical shell are derived using double Fourier series. The solution of this problem is general, and therefore {{can be applied to}} cylindrical shells under local I loadings in any direction and with different boundary conditions. Linear elastic analyses of discretely <b>supported</b> perfect <b>cylinders</b> under axial compression are presented using the finite element method. The pre-buckling meridional membrane stress distribution above the support centreline is examined in detail, and is followed by investigations of the linear bifurcation behaviour of the cylinders. The effects on the stress distribution and the buckling strength of different loading patterns and different geometric configurations are extensively examined. Geometrically nonlinear elastic buckling analyses are also performed using large deflection theory. Both perfect and imperfect cylinders are studied with various geometric configurations and under different loading conditions. The nonlinear elastic buckling behaviour, the buckling strength and the buckling configuration are thoroughly investigated for discretely <b>supported</b> <b>cylinders</b> Further studies extend the work into the plastic range. Discretely <b>supported</b> <b>cylinders</b> obeying the von Mises yield criterion are analysed. Limit analyses of perfect cylinders are first conducted using small deflection theory. Geometrically nonlinear elastic-plastic collapse analyses of both perfect and imperfect cylinders are performed next. Studies of different loading conditions and parametric studies of varying geometries and material strengths are presented in both types of analysis. The nonlinear elastic-plastic behaviour of discretely <b>supported</b> <b>cylinders</b> is thus explored. A complete silo which consists of a cylindrical shell, a conical roof hopper and a conical discharge hopper is briefly examined, with the aim of exploring the applicability of the established cylinder model in the elastic buckling analysis of silo structures.

40|$|Loosely <b>supported</b> <b>cylinders</b> {{subjected}} to cross-flow may undergo fluidelastic {{instability in the}} support inactive mode resulting in cylinder/support impacting. The cylinder/support interaction forces and, in turn, the resulting cylinder wear rates are strongly dependent on the detailed dynamical response. This Thesis examines the response of a loosely <b>supported</b> <b>cylinder</b> located in the third row of an otherwise rigid rotated triangular array. The feasibility and potential of a modern nonlinear dynamics approach {{to the understanding of}} the underlying dynamics is investigated. A nonlinear quasi-steady model was formulated to model the dynamical behaviour. The steady fluid force field, required as input to the model, was measured experimentally for a cylinder within a rotated triangular array. A lither stability analysis showed the cylinder stability behaviour to be strongly dependent on cylinder position. This result serves as a possible explanation for the rare occurrence of, theoretically predicted, multiple instability regions in experimental measurements. The nonlinear analysis uncovered two important transition routes to chaos. The first, a switching mechanism prevalent at the onset of impacting. The second and most important is the intermittency route to chaos. The theoretical model showed good agreement with experiments in predicting the bifurcation sequences and transitions to chaos [...] comparisons were quantified via fractal dimensions and saddle orbit distributions. The identification of type I intermittency leads to a quantitative estimate of the probability distribution of the length of laminar phases. It is shown that the duration of laminar phases and the associated frequency may provide better estimates of integration time and frequency for wear-rate computation...|$|R
