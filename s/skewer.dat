5|$|According to {{the classic}} recipe, shucked oysters are wrapped in bacon which is then broiled in the oven, about three minutes per side. An early recipe, from 1902, {{suggests}} frying the skewered oysters and bacon in butter. The dish is often served on toast, though if prepared on skewers and broiled, it can be eaten straight from the <b>skewer.</b>|$|E
5|$|The elite cavalry {{corps of}} the Persians was the Aswaran. The lance was {{probably}} their preferred weapon, having {{the power to}} <b>skewer</b> two men simultaneously. Their horses were covered in lamellar armor {{to protect them from}} enemy archers. Persian archers had a lethal range of about 175 meters and accurate range at about 50–60 meters.|$|E
5|$|Loss {{of habitat}} {{is the other}} major threat to the corn crake. Apart from the reduced {{suitability}} of drained and fertilised silage fields compared to traditional hay meadows, in western Europe the conversion of grassland to arable has been aided by subsidies, and further east the collapse of collective farming {{has led to the}} abandonment and lack of management of much land in this important breeding area. More localised threats include floods in spring, and disturbance by roads or wind farms. This bird is good eating; when they were common in England, Mrs Beeton recommended roasting four on a <b>skewer.</b> More significant than direct hunting is the loss of many birds, up to 14,000 a year, in Egypt, where migrating birds are captured in nets set for the quail with which they often migrate. Although this may account for 0.5–2.7% of the European population, the losses to this form of hunting are less than when the targeted species were more numerous and predictable.|$|E

5|$|Both the {{function}} {{and the appearance}} in life of the extremely elongated and bifurcated vertebral spines remain elusive. Salgado and Bonaparte (1991) suggested the spines represented defense weapons against predators, arguing that they tapered towards their tips. In a subsequent skeletal reconstruction drawing, Salgado (1999) depicted the neural spines supporting a keratinous sheath, which could have added significantly to the total length of the spines. The presence of a covering, either of keratin or skin, is shown by a striation pattern {{on the surface of}} the spines similar to the bony horn cores of today's bovids. American science writer Gregory Paul (2000) argued that the spines, if elongated by a keratinous sheath, could have been used as a weapon both against predators and members of the same species, as the animal might have been able to point its most anterior spines forward by bending its neck. He also hypothesized that the spines could have been clattered together to generate sound. In 2016, Mark Hallett and Mathew Wedel suggested that the backwards-directed spines might have been able to <b>skewer</b> predators when the neck was abruptly drawn backwards during an attack. A similar defense strategy is found in today's giant sable antelope and Arabian oryx, which can use their long, backwards directed horns to stab attacking lions. Apart from the possible function in defense, the spines may have been used for display, either for the intimidation of rivaling individuals or for courtship. Hallett and Wedel also hypothesized that rival males might have interlocked their spines for neck wrestling.|$|E

25|$|Creeling {{involved}} {{replacing the}} rovings bobbins {{in a section}} of the mule without stopping the mule. On very coarse counts a bobbin lasted two days but on fine count it could last for 3 weeks. To creel, the creeler stood behind the mule, he placed new bobbins on the shelf above the creel. As the bobbin ran empty he would pick it off its <b>skewer</b> in the creel unreeling 30cm or so of roving, and drop it into a skip. With his left hand, he would place on the new bobbin onto the <b>skewer</b> from above and with his right hand twist in the new roving into the tail of the last.|$|E

50|$|Metal <b>skewers</b> are {{typically}} stainless steel rods with a pointed tip {{on one end}} and a grip of some kind {{on the other end}} for ease of removing the food.

25|$|In {{the earlier}} {{part of the}} war, the U.S. used the bayonet mostly as a cooking <b>skewer</b> or tool {{rather than as a}} {{fighting}} instrument.

500|$|The Joker {{is portrayed}} as skilled in melee combat, from his initial {{appearances}} when he defeats Batman in a sword fight (nearly killing him), and others when he overwhelms Batman but declines to kill him. He is talented with firearms, although even his guns are theatrical; his long-barreled revolver often releases a flag reading [...] "Bang", and a second trigger-pull launches the flag to <b>skewer</b> its target. Although formidable in combat, the Joker's chief asset is his mind.|$|E

500|$|The Initiative's {{goals are}} {{gradually}} made clearer. A recurring character {{since the second}} season is Spike (James Marsters), a mercenary vampire who has fought both against and with Buffy in the past, depending on what suits his interests. Recently wanting to kill Buffy, Spike is captured by the Initiative before he can get to her and implanted with a chip in his brain that causes intense pain if he tries to attack humans to feed on them, or even to fight them. Buffy begins enthusiastically training with the Initiative, {{spending more time with}} Riley, and trying to impress Dr. Walsh. At different times, Willow, Xander, and Giles caution Buffy that she does not know the Initiative's true motives and there are questions about their mission that are unanswered. Buffy begins asking questions during [...] "The I in Team". After being sent after a Polgara demon, a being with a <b>skewer</b> in its arm, she wants to know why the demon must be captured alive and unharmed as she is used to killing demons. Her questions at first confound Dr. Walsh—who answers to no one—then cement Dr. Walsh's decision to remove Buffy from the Initiative. After a botched attempt to kill Buffy, Dr. Walsh consoles herself by going into laboratory room 314 and speaking to her pet project, Adam who is laying on a table, apparently unconscious. Adam rises and impales Dr. Walsh with the <b>skewer</b> in his arm—the one taken off the Polgara demon. His first word is [...] "Mommy", which he says as Dr. Walsh falls to the floor, dead.|$|E
500|$|When Light House was {{published}} in 2000 it was critically acclaimed, however, it had lackluster sales.

The Chicago Sun-Times construed the storyline as one that [...] "allows Monahan to indulge in wisecracks, lampoons and slurs of seemingly infinite variety" [...] with [...] "literary and artistic pretenders [...] heavy fire". Mark Rozzo of the Los Angeles Times praised Monahan's [...] "refreshing disregard for believability, making Light House [...] which contains asides on Freud, Emerson, race and fiction itself [...] a seriously adult cartoon".|$|E

50|$|There's a {{distinct}} range of street foods {{available in the}} Philippines. Some of these are <b>skewered</b> on sticks {{in the manner of}} a kebab. One such example is banana-cue which is a whole banana or plantain <b>skewered</b> on a short thin bamboo stick, rolled in brown sugar, and pan-fried. Kamote-cue is a peeled sweet potato <b>skewered</b> on a stick, covered in brown sugar and then pan-fried. Fish balls or squid balls are also pan-fried, then <b>skewered</b> on bamboo sticks and given to the customer, who then has a choice of dipping in a sweet or savory sauce.

50|$|The <b>skewers</b> {{that being}} used for sate kambing (lamb satay) are usually larger and thicker, and made from bamboo, {{compared}} to thinner <b>skewers</b> used for chicken satay that usually used mid-ribs of coconut leaf. This is corresponds to the thickness and texture of goat meat that is tougher than chicken. To avoid burning, the <b>skewers</b> are usually being soaked in water first prior of using. The <b>skewered</b> mutton/lamb is then marinated in spices before being placed on a charcoal grill. The marination seasoning would include puréed pineapple juice, sweet soy sauce, ground shallot and galangal. In restaurants or street stall warungs, sate kambing (lamb satay) are made to order and grilled right away after customer placed their order.|$|R

Each recipe has a heading in italics; some have an illustration, drawn by Hartley, or else a quotation or proverb. There is no list of ingredients. The first paragraph often describes the dish or its ingredients. Thus for sirloin, she advises [...] "This is the best beef joint and should be roasted. Never have the undercut taken out...". The instructions are given in a few paragraphs: [...] "Let the sirloin be well hung; dust it lightly with dry mustard, pepper and brown flour to give a crisp crust; bed the fat end well under the lean undercut, and secure in place with string or carefully placed <b>skewer.</b> Roast carefully, basting frequently." ...|$|E
