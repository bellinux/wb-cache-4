When performing <b>strain</b> <b>limiting,</b> our method acts on strain tensors to constrain the singular values of the deformation gradient matrix in a specified interval.

When performing treatment of simultaneous collisions, our method eliminates all detected collisions during each iteration, leading to higher efficiency and faster convergence than prior collision treatment methods.|$|R
40|$|Conference ABSTRACT: The New Zealand Structural Loadings Standard, {{until its}} latest revision, used the {{structural}} ductility factor {{as a measure}} of the deformation demand of all potential plastic hinges in a structure. In the new version of New Zealand Standard for Earthquake Actions (NZS 1170. 5 : 2004) the detailing of potential plastic regions is determined according to the local deformation demand in these regions. The change has been prompted by evidence that the structural ductility factor gives a poor indication of the demand on individual plastic regions.

40|$|The elastic <b>strain</b> <b>limit</b> of the tendon {{appears to}} be an omnipresent {{parameter}} in the literature in many of the problems described related to its pathologic conditions, which are often related to the repetitive loading tendons undergo during life. In other words, the study of the fatigue resistance of the tendons may provide information about the etiology of these pathologies. The elastic <b>strain</b> <b>limit</b> corresponds to the point after which micro-damage in the tendon starts. Thus, the prediction of this limit and its use in the design of fatigue loading protocols, may benefit the understanding of the onset and evolution of damage which is intimately related to the repair capacity of the cells. The variability of the elastic <b>strain</b> <b>limit</b> between different individuals makes it difficult to choose the applied load in these tests. This thesis shows a possible approach to predict the elastic <b>strain</b> <b>limit</b> based on a point-wise comparison of the sample’s stress- strain curve to a set of N number of failure curves from a database that was constructed for this purpose. The accuracy of the method proved to be statistically significantly (p < 0. 05) higher than other methods that were evaluated. It was also shown that it could be applied to predict the elastic <b>strain</b> <b>limit</b> of other species such as the horse’s superficial digital flexor tendon which together to the human Achilles tendon are the most injured between species. The main advantage of this method is that the higher accuracy comes along with a certainty that every prediction will be carried out, in contrast to other methods where some obstacles may render missing predictions. Finally, the smallest strain percentage up to which the sample’s stress-strain curve was used for the prediction, proved to be sufficient for obtaining similar accuracy as that with the highest strain percentage tested, with the only requirement of a moderately higher number of failure curves against to which it should be compared.

Emulsions without polymer, and polymer solutions alone, showed essentially viscous behavior, with dominant viscous modulus over the whole frequency range (0. 01 - 10 Hz). However, the emulsion containing polymer demonstrated a significant elastic modulus, dependent on the oil and polymer concentrations, attributable to interdroplet depletion interactions. Power-law relationships were observed between the elastic modulus, elastic <b>strain</b> <b>limit,</b> and oil volume fraction, but the indices were lower than those predicted by fractal models, giving unrealistic fractal dimensionalities.
