40|$|One of {{the major}} {{concerns}} for the aging Space Shuttle fleet is the stress rupture life of composite overwrapped pressure vessels (COPVs). Stress rupture life of a COPV {{has been defined as}} the minimum time during which the composite maintains structural integrity considering the combined effects of stress levels and time. To assist in the evaluation of the aging COPVs in the Orbiter fleet an analytical reliability model was developed. The actual data used to construct this model was from testing of COPVs constructed of similar, but not exactly same materials and pressure cycles as used on Orbiter vessels. Since no actual Orbiter COPV stress rupture data exists the Space Shuttle Program decided to run a <b>stress</b> <b>rupture</b> <b>test</b> to compare to model predictions. Due to availability of spares, the testing was unfortunately limited to one 40 " vessel. The <b>stress</b> <b>rupture</b> <b>test</b> was performed at maximum operating pressure at an elevated temperature to accelerate aging. The test was performed in two phases. The first phase, 130 F, a moderately accelerated test designed to achieve the midpoint of the model predicted point reliability. The more aggressive second phase, performed at 160 F was designed to determine if the test article will exceed the 95 % confidence interval of the model.

Fractographic evidence from uniaxial tensile <b>stress</b> <b>rupture</b> <b>testing</b> at 1200 0 C revealed limited presence of slow crack growth associated with surface connected porosity failure sites.

40|$|A {{program has}} been {{initiated}} to develop a material with superior properties at elevated temperatures for utilization in turbine blade applications. A nickel-base superalloy can provide the necessary high temperature strength by using the maximum capability of the three available strengthening mechanisms - intermetallic gamma prime precipitation (Ni 3 Al), solid solution strengthening with refractory and precious metals, and stable carbide formations through the addition of strong carbide forming elements.

40|$|Carbon fiber overwrapped {{pressure}} vessels {{are known to}} fail from stress rupture, which is a catastrophic failure mode. Because this failure mode {{is a function of}} time and sustained load, composite overwrapped {{pressure vessels}} (COPVs) launch vehicles and spacecraft are particularly susceptible because missions can be of long duration and the operating loads on the composite overwrap are typically high. Mitigation of this failure mode requires appropriate characterization of this stress rupture lifetime. The current state-of-the-art for stress rupture characterization is the stochastic modeling of phenomenological data. Such models are then applied to COPVs to obtain an estimate of stress rupture lifetime in the future. Currently no standards exist for the development of data needed to characterize COPV stress rupture lifetime.

40|$|AbstractIntergranular {{cracking}} {{behaviors in}} water quenched 2. 25 Cr- 1. 5 W heat-resistant steels are {{understood in the}} light of the formation of grain boundary carbides and the impurities segregation to grain boundaries or carbide interface at the grain boundaries. Before stress rupture tests, all materials were water-quenched after holding at 1050 °C for 1 h. The microstructure showed a typical lath martensite. Heating rate was 1200 °C/h to a testing temperature and <b>stress</b> <b>rupture</b> <b>test</b> was performed without any soaking. At a fixed temperature, time to failure increased as the applied stress decreased. Irrespective of the bulk contents of P, the fracture mode was intergranular except for a condition corresponding to a longer time to failure. From AES analyses, the crater interface where grain boundary carbides had existed showed a segregation concentration of P much higher than that at the carbide-free grain boundaries, resulting from the much higher interface energy. The phosphorus segregation at the carbide interfaces of the alloy containing the higher bulk content of phosphorus is mainly replaced by the segregation of nitrogen, tin and tellurium in the alloy containing a lower bulk content of phosphorus. These results suggest that the intergranular cracking follows the sequence from the crater interface to the carbide-free grain boundaries...|$|E

The investigation included dimensional, hardness and tensile measurements in addition to accelerated stress rupture tests between 650 Cº and 700 Cº and microstructural examination. Tube specimens were taken from two sections, the overheated side and the side which only saw the nominal operating temperature. The method employed involved the prediction {{of the increase in}} temperature with increasing sediment deposition during the operating life times using an FEM model. In addition the predicted temperatures are used to derive appropriate creep properties at relevant temperatures in a 3 D pipe FEM creep analysis to predict the pipe deformation rate. All compare well with the actual service exposed pipe measurements and layer deposition. The overheated side revealed a small loss of creep strength in a <b>stress</b> <b>rupture</b> <b>test.</b> A layer of sediment (appr. 10 mm thickness) consisting basically of sintered carbon (coke) spread over the inside of the tube was acting as a thermal barrier causing the temperature to rise above 650 Cº.

40|$|Extensive {{stress rupture}} studies on glass {{composites}} and Kevlar composites {{were conducted by}} the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory {{beginning in the late}} 1960 's and extending to about 8 years in some cases. Some of the data from these studies published over the years were incomplete or were tainted by spurious failures, such as grip slippage. Updated data sets were defined for both fiberglass and Kevlar composite stand test specimens. These updated data are analyzed in this report by a convenient form of the bivariate Weibull distribution, to establish a consistent set of design prediction charts that may be used as a conservative basis for predicting the stress rupture life of composite pressure vessels. The updated glass composite data exhibit an invariant Weibull modulus with lifetime. The data are analyzed in terms of homologous service load (referenced to the observed median strength). The equations relating life, homologous load, and probability are given, and corresponding design prediction charts are presented. A similar approach is taken for Kevlar composites, where the updated stand data do show a turndown tendency at long life accompanied by a corresponding change (increase) of the Weibull modulus. The turndown characteristic is not present in <b>stress</b> <b>rupture</b> <b>test</b> data of Kevlar pressure vessels. A modification of the stress rupture equations is presented to incorporate a latent, but limited, strength drop, and design prediction charts are presented that incorporate such behavior.

40|$|Composite Overwrapped Pressure Vessel (COPVs) {{that have}} survived a long service time under {{pressure}} generally must be recertified before service is extended. Flight certification {{is dependent on}} the reliability analysis to quantify the risk of stress rupture failure in existing flight vessels. Full certification of this reliability model would require a statistically significant number of lifetime tests to be performed and is impractical given the cost and limited flight hardware for certification testing purposes. One approach to confirm the reliability model is to perform a <b>stress</b> <b>rupture</b> <b>test</b> on a flight COPV. Currently, testing of such a Kevlar 49 ®/epoxy COPV is nearing completion. The present paper focuses on a Bayesian statistical approach to analyze the possible failure time results of this test and to assess the implications in choosing between possible model parameter values that in the past have had significant uncertainty. The key uncertain parameters in this case are the actual fiber stress ratio at operating pressure, and the Weibull shape parameter for lifetime; the former has been uncertain due to ambiguities in interpreting the original and a duplicate burst test. The latter has been uncertain due to major differences between COPVs in the database and the actual COPVs in service. Any information obtained that clarifies and eliminates uncertainty in these parameters will have a major effect on the predicted reliability of the service COPVs going forward. The key result is that the longer the vessel survives, the more likely the more optimistic stress ratio model is correct. At the time of writing, the resulting effect on predicted future reliability is dramatic, increasing it by about one “nine”, that is, reducing the predicted probability of failure by an order of magnitude. However, testing one vessel does not change the uncertainty on the Weibull shape parameter for lifetime since testing several vessels would be necessary. Nomenclatur...|$|E

40|$|Introducing {{composite}} vessels {{into the}} Space Shuttle Program represented a significant technical achievement. Each Orbiter vehicle contains 24 (nominally) Kevlar tanks for storage of pressurized helium (for propulsion) and nitrogen (for life support). The use of composite cylinders saved 752 pounds per Orbiter vehicle compared with all-metal tanks. The weight savings is significant considering each Shuttle flight can deliver 54, 000 pounds of payload to the International Space Station. In {{the wake of}} the Columbia accident and the ensuing Return to Flight activities, the Space Shuttle Program, in 2005, re-examined COPV hardware certification. Incorporating COPV data that had been generated over the last 30 years and recognizing differences between initial Shuttle Program requirements and current operation, a new failure mode was identified, as composite stress rupture was deemed credible. The Orbiter Project undertook a comprehensive investigation to quantify and mitigate this risk. First, the engineering team considered and later deemed as unfeasible the option to replace existing all flight tanks. Second, operational improvements to flight procedures were instituted to reduce the flight risk and the danger to personnel. Third, an Orbiter reliability model was developed to quantify flight risk. Laser profilometry inspection of several flight COPVs identified deep (up to 20 mil) depressions on the tank interior. A comprehensive analysis was performed and it confirmed that these observed depressions were far less than the criterion which was established as necessary to lead to liner buckling. Existing fleet vessels were exonerated from this failure mechanism. Because full validation of the Orbiter Reliability Model was not possible given limited hardware resources, an Accelerated <b>Stress</b> <b>Rupture</b> <b>Test</b> of a flown flight vessel was performed to provide increased confidence. A Bayesian statistical approach was developed to evaluate possible test results with respect to the model credibility and thus flight rationale for continued operation of the Space Shuttle with existing flight hardware. A non-destructive evaluation (NDE) technique utilizing Raman Spectroscopy was developed to directly measure the overwrap residual stress state. Preliminary results provide optimistic results that patterns of fluctuation in fiber elastic strains over the outside vessel surface could be directly correlated with increased fiber stress ratios and thus reduced reliability...|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} of the creep rupture of Kevlar@ 29, Twaron@ 1000, and Technora T 2000 aramid fibre yams {{was carried out in}} the temperature range 25 - 120 T in air and three other environments (Saudi/Iranian crude oil, pure water, and low pH water) at 65 T with the objective of characterising the long term failure behaviour of these fibres and determine if they can be used to replace the <b>stress</b> <b>rupture</b> <b>test</b> conducted on RTP for qualification purposes. The standard loglo-loglo ISO 9080 extrapolation procedure, the modified lin-logio ISO 9080 extrapolation procedure and the time temperature superposition method were used to model and interpret the results. When tested in air, the different yams showed similar but not identical regression parameters. The results of the standard logio-logio ISO 9080 and the modified lin-logio methods correlated well. The standard logio-logio form, however, gave slightly higher values for the 20 year mean stress and LPL. Its use is recommended because it is consistent with the model assumed in the regression of RTP. There was no evidence of any 'knee' in the relationships after long periods or at high temperatures. This suggests that there is no change in failure mechanism, and lends confidence to both the long term use of aramid fibre in air and the recommended qualification procedures. RTP regression curve constants and those of tested aramid fibre were similar indicating the validity of aramid fibre stress rupture tests as a replacement for RTP tests. Crude oil immersion produced a small but significant reduction in behaviour. At 650 C a suitable crude oil reduction factor applied to the long ten-n LPL would be 0. 9. Pure water produces a marked reduction in strength after short periods, at 65 C. Finally, water of low pH resulted in a large reduction in performance and considerable scatter with one fibre type. With the other, the effect appeared to be similar to that of pure water. Based on the understanding of the failure mechanism and the creep process in aramid fibres, a creep strain model is proposed for estimating the strain to failure based on the material's properties.

40|$|Each Orbiter Vehicle (Space Shuttle Program) {{contains}} up to 24 Kevlar 49 /Epoxy Composite Overwrapped Pressure Vessels (COPV) {{for storage}} of pressurized gases. In {{the wake of}} the Columbia accident and the ensuing Return To Flight (RTF) activities, Orbiter engineers reexamined COPV flight certification. The original COPV design calculations were updated to include recently declassified Kevlar COPV test data from Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) and to incorporate changes in how the Space Shuttle was operated as opposed to orinigially envisioned. 2005 estimates for the probability of a catastrophic failure {{over the life of the}} program (from STS- 1 through STS- 107) were one-in-five. To address this unacceptable risk, the Orbiter Project Office (OPO) initiated a comprehensive investigation to understand and mitigate this risk. First, the team considered and eventually deemed unfeasible procuring and replacing all existing flight COPVs. OPO replaced the two vessels with the highest risk with existing flight spare units. Second, OPO instituted operational improvements in ground procedures to signficiantly reduce risk, without adversely affecting Shuttle capability. Third, OPO developed a comprehensive model to quantify the likelihood of occurrance. A fully-instrumented burst test (recording a lower burst pressure than expected) on a flight-certified vessel provided critical understanding of the behavior of Orbiter COPVs. A more accurate model was based on a newly-compiled comprehensive database of Kevlar data from LLNL and elsewhere. Considering hardware changes, operational improvements and reliability model refinements, the mean reliability was determined to be 0. 998 for the remainder of the Shuttle Program (from 2007, for STS- 118 thru STS- 135). Since limited hardware resources precluded full model validation through multiple tests, additional model confidence was sought through the first-ever Accelerated <b>Stress</b> <b>Rupture</b> <b>Test</b> (ASRT) of a flown flight article. A Bayesian statistical approach was developed to interpret possible test results. Since the lifetime observed in the ASRT exceeded initial estimates by one to two orders of magnitude, the Space Shuttle Program deemed there was significant conservatism in the model and accepted continued operation with existing flight hardware. Given the variability in tank-to-tank original prooftest response, a non-destructive evaluation (NDE) technique utilizing Raman Spectroscopy was developed to directly measure COPV residual stress state. Preliminary results showed that patterns of low fiber elastic strains over the outside vessel surface, together with measured permanent volume growth during proof, could be directly correlated to increased fiber stress ratios on the inside fibers adjacent to the liner, and thus reduced reliability...|$|E

Specimens which had been embrittled by helium were found to contain numerous intercrystalline microcracks, which were orientated normal to the stress direction and eventually caused rupture. The elongation of the specimens resulted mainly from the widening of the microcracks; the grains themselves were not elongated to the same extent as found in unirradiated specimens.

40|$|Both {{aviation}} {{and land}} based turbine components such as vanes/nozzles, combustion chambers, liners, and transition pieces often degrade and crack in service. Rather than replacing with new components, innovative repairs {{can help reduce}} overhaul and maintenance costs. These components are cast from either Co-based solid solution superalloys such as FSX- 414 or Ni-based gamma prime precipitation strengthened superalloys such as IN 738. The nominal compositions of FSX- 414 and IN 738 are Co- 29. 5 Cr- 10. 5 Ni- 7 W- 2 Fe [max]- 0. 25 C- 0. 012 B and Ni- 0. 001 B- 0. 17 C- 8. 5 Co- 16 Cr- 1. 7 Mo- 3. 4 Al- 2. 6 W- 1. 7 Ta- 2 Nb- 3. 4 Ti- 0. 1 Zr, respectively. Diffusion brazing {{has been used for}} over 4 decades to repair cracks and degradation on these types of components. Typically, braze materials utilized for component repairs are Ni- and Co-based braze fillers containing B and/or Si as melting point depressants. Especially when repairing wide cracks typically found on industrial gas turbine components, these melting point depressants can form brittle intermetallic boride and silicide phases that affect mechanical properties such as low cycle and thermal fatigue. The objective of this work is to investigate and evaluate the use of hypereutectic Ni-Cr-Hf and Ni-Cr-Zr braze filler metals, where the melting point depressant is no longer B, but Hf and/or Zr. Typically, with joint gaps or crack widths less than 0. 15 mm, the braze filler metal alone can be utilized. For cracks greater than 0. 15 mm, a superalloy powder is mixed with the braze filler metal to enable wide cracks to be successfully brazed repaired. As a means of qualifying the diffusion braze repair, both metallurgical and mechanical property evaluations were carried out. The metallurgical evaluation consisted of optical and scanning electron microscopies, and microprobe analysis. The diffusion brazed area consisted of a fine-grained equiaxed structure with carbide phases, gamma dendrites, flower shaped/rosette gamma-gamma prime - eutectic phases, and Ni 7 Hf 2, Ni 5 HF, or Ni 5 Zr intermetallic phases dispersed both intergranularly and intragranularly. Hardness tests showed that the Ni-Hf and Ni-Zr intermetallic phase only has a hardness range of 250 - 400 HV, whereas, the typical Cr-boride phases have hardness ranges from 800 HV to 1000 HV. Therefore the hardness values of the Ni-Hf and Ni-Zr intermetallic phases are 2. 5 - 3. 2 times softer than the Cr-boride intermetallic phases. As a result the low cycle fatigue (LCF) properties of the wide gap Ni-Cr-Hf and Ni-Cr-Zr brazed joints are superior to those of the Ni-Cr-B braze filler metals. The mechanical property evaluations were tensile tests at both room temperature and elevated temperature, <b>stress</b> <b>rupture</b> <b>test</b> from 760 °C to 1093 °C, and finally LCF tests, the latter being {{one of the most important}} and severe tests to conduct since the cracks being repaired are thermal fatigue driven. At the optimum braze thermal cycle, the mechanical test results achieved were a minimum of 80 % and sometimes equivalent to that of the base metal properties...|$|E
40|$|Columbium, {{for which}} the United States is 100 percent import reliant, is of {{strategic}} importance to the U. S. aerospace industry. A major amount of the Cb is used in Inconel 718. Should Cb sources be disrupted, it may be desired to use a grade of Cb melting stock having greater Sn content then the preferred vacuum rade. Additions of Sn to Inconel 718 were varied from none added to 1 wt %. The Sn additions below 800 ppm had no detrimental effects on 650 C <b>stress</b> <b>rupture</b> behavior; however, 1 -wt % Sn severely degraded both life and ductility. Additions of Sn in excess of 200 ppm were slightly detrimental to the 425 C tensile yield strength and ductility.

40|$|The {{effects of}} crystal {{orientation}} on the mechanical properties of single crystals of the nickel-based superalloy Mar-M 247 are investigated. Tensile tests at temperatures from 23 to 1093 C and <b>stress</b> <b>rupture</b> <b>tests</b> at temperatures from 760 to 1038 C were performed for 52 single crystals at various orientations. During tensile testing between 23 and 760 C, single crystals with high Schmid factors {{were found to}} be favorably oriented for slip and to exhibit lower strength and higher ductility than those with low Schmid factors. Crystals which required large rotations to become oriented for cross slip were observed to have the shortest <b>stress</b> <b>rupture</b> lives at 760 C, while those which required little or no rotation had the longest lives. In addition, stereographic triangles obtained for Mar-M 247 and Mar-M 200 single crystals reveal that crystals with orientations near the - 111 had the highest lives, those near the 001 had high lives, and those near the 011 had low lives...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the effect of water grit-blasting and high temperature thermal exposure on the microstructures of DD 6 alloy with TBCs, DD 6 single crystal superalloy specimens were water grit-blasted with 0. 3 MPa pressure, then the specimens were coated with thermal barrier coatings by electron beam physical vapor deposition (EB-PVD). Specimens with TBCs were exposed at 1100 ℃ for 50 and 100 hours in the air respectively, and then these specimens were subjected to stress-rupture tests under the condition of 1100 ℃/ 130 MPa. The results show that grit-blasting doesn't lead into the recrystallization, thermal exposure can induce element interdiffusion between the bond coat and alloy substrate, the residual stress and element diffusion lead into the changes of γ' phase coarsing direction.
