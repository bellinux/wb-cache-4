50|$|South Africa has a 'hybrid' or 'mixed' legal system, {{formed by}} the {{interweaving}} {{of a number of}} distinct legal traditions: a civil law system inherited from the Dutch, a common law system inherited from the British, and a customary law system inherited from indigenous Africans (often termed African Customary Law, of which there are many variations depending on the tribal origin). These traditions have had a complex interrelationship, with the English influence most apparent in procedural aspects of the legal system and methods of adjudication, and the Roman-Dutch influence most visible in its <b>substantive</b> <b>private</b> <b>law.</b> As a general rule, South Africa follows English law in both criminal and civil procedure, company law, constitutional law and the law of evidence; while Roman-Dutch common law is followed in the South African contract law, law of delict (tort), law of persons, law of things, family law, etc. With the commencement in 1994 of the interim Constitution, and in 1997 its replacement, the final Constitution, another strand has been added to this weave.|$|E
40|$|This {{contribution}} advances {{the argument}} that global self-regulation through corporate social responsibility codes {{can and should be}} enforced under domestic private laws. Corporate social responsibility codes are defined as unilateral corporate commitments that indicate a corporation 2 ̆ 7 s willingness to take on a global regulatory role {{in the absence of a}} global political government-a phenomenon that is difficult to grasp from the perspective of traditional private law categories. The contribution thus starts by discussing the aspects in which private corporate codes and private law categories seem not to fit, and points to recent developments in <b>substantive</b> <b>private</b> <b>law</b> that could change this situation, namely case law, statutory reform, and the novel contract designs used by private actors to effectuate their corporate social responsibility codes, which private law can rely upon. This contribution argues that these developments provide sufficient ground to assume a gradually evolving readiness within <b>substantive</b> <b>private</b> <b>law</b> to provide for the enforcement of these corporate social responsibility codes. Subsequently, the contribution focuses on the normative side of the argument. From a sociolegal perspective, the main reason in favor of enforcement is identified in the specific social potential and the risks created through these corporate codes for a globalized society that private law has to help mitigate. Based on this argument, the contribution continues by discussing the possible actors that could realize enforcement. First, it identifies domestic courts as important actors to enforce this type of global self-regulation, and, in this context, analyzes how, in order for domestic courts to pursue such an enforcement strategy on the basis of <b>substantive</b> <b>private</b> <b>law,</b> private international law equally requires a transformation. Second, the contribution considers international arbitral tribunals as additional institutions that could be entrusted with the enforcement if related changes in domestic arbitration laws can safeguard the function of domestic courts to monitor this enforcement role of arbitrators...|$|E
40|$|Public policy {{exceptions}} arguably {{exist in}} all fields {{of private and}} commerciallaw, not only in private international law but also in substantive law. In <b>substantive</b> <b>private</b> <b>law,</b> the term 'public policy exception' {{could be used to}} indicate general illegality rules that make an act of private autonomy (a contract, a testament, etc.) invalid when it conflicts with public policy or good morals. In primary EU law, one may call 'public policy exceptions' the derogations from the four freedoms for reasons of public morality, public policy, public security, or public health. Like the ordre public exceptions in private international law, the public policy exceptions in substantive private and commercial laws can also be seen as conflict rules. In fact, the public policy exceptions in <b>substantive</b> <b>private</b> <b>law</b> address the conflict between state regulation and policy, on the one hand, and private (self-) regulation and policy, on the other hand. Moreover, the public policy derogations from the four freedoms regulate the conflict between EU and national law and policy. A long-term research project initiated in Groningen aims at a cross-cutting comparison of interpretations and applications of concepts that function as public policy exceptions in different branches of substantive, international, and EU private and commerciallaw. In particular, this project aims at discovering and comparing the governance aspects, the fundamental rights based aspects, and the social justice aspects of these interpretations and applications...|$|E

The impact of the 45 years of Actually Existing Socialism upon Polish legal culture is still significant. First of all, there has been an almost uninterrupted continuity of legal instiutions (courts, legal professions), and the system of legal education and judicial appointments furthers the continuity of legal culture. Secondly, ultra-formalism (‘hyperpositivism’) associated with the Socialist Legal Tradition in its post-Stalinist version remains the dominant working legal thought in Poland.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} about {{corporate}} attribution in <b>private</b> <b>law.</b> Unlike human persons, companies are artificial legal persons. They lack a physical body {{with which to}} act, and a mind with which to think. English law therefore developed the concept of attribution so that legal rules {{could be applied to}} companies. Attribution is the process of legal reasoning by which the acts and states of mind of human individuals acting for a company are treated as that of the company, so as to establish the company’s rights against and obligations owed to other parties. This thesis examines the rules of attribution across the <b>private</b> <b>law</b> of obligations, focusing on the law of contract, tort, unjust enrichment, and selected aspects of equitable liability. Three main arguments are made in this thesis. First, there is a sharp distinction between the rules of attribution and the <b>substantive</b> rules of <b>private</b> <b>law</b> to which they apply. The former belongs in the law of persons, and it concerns when the acts and states of mind of an individual can be attributed to a company. The latter belongs in the law of obligations. Second, the same rules of attribution should be, and have largely been used across the entire expanse of <b>private</b> <b>law.</b> Regardless of the area of <b>private</b> <b>law</b> in which the question of attribution arises, the same question is being asked, and so the law’s answer should be the same. Like should be treated alike. This is normatively desirable, because it ensures coherence across <b>private</b> <b>law.</b> Third, it is therefore possible to state the rules of attribution that apply in <b>private</b> <b>law.</b> The acts of an individual A will be attributed to the company C where they were (i) specifically authorised (‘specific authority’), (ii) where A performs an act within the class of acts that A has power to do on behalf of C, even if A is acting in breach of duty (‘actual authority’), or (iii) where A has either been placed in a position or been held out by C such that a reasonable person in the position of a third party would reasonably believe that A had the power to act for C (‘apparent authority’). A’s knowledge will be attributed to C where it is material to the class of acts that A had specific or actual authority to do on behalf of C. Although commonly thought to be a series of diverse, disparate rules found in different doctrines and different areas of law, the rules of attribution form a remarkably coherent, consistent whole across <b>private</b> <b>law...</b>|$|R

40|$|The diverse {{nature of}} <b>substantive</b> <b>private</b> <b>law</b> systems across Europe has amplified the {{development}} of an EU Civil Justice system based on harmonised EU private international law (PIL) mechanisms. However, the process of European integration and the free movement of people, goods, capital and services in an enlarged and diverse Union poses the question whether the current framework allows litigants to obtain an effective remedy in cross-border cases. The authors argue that the problems of jurisdiction, choice of law and recognition and enforcement of judgments will be recurrent for courts and litigants, and this may adversely affect the level of litigiousness. After analysing several types of cross-border cases brought before the English courts in the European context, the authors make a case {{that there is a need}} for an appropriately conducted comparative study to collect empirical evidence which explains the cross-border litigation pattern and assesses the effectiveness of the PIL instruments adopted at Union level. It is concluded that devising an appropriate institutional architecture for the interpretation and application of PIL legislative instruments is key to the creation of a genuine European area of justice as there cannot be rights without appropriate remedies...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Even {{though there}} exists an {{extensive}} Law and Economics {{literature on the}} topics of procedural law and harmonization of law, very little has been written on harmonization of procedural law as such. In this paper I first provide {{a brief overview of}} the economic approach to legal intervention, private enforcement and procedural law. Subsequently, I discuss the economics of harmonization of (<b>substantive)</b> <b>private</b> <b>law.</b> The traditional legal arguments in favor of harmonization (differences in legal rules between countries result in legal uncertainty and increased costs and therefore hinder cross-border trade, and harmonization would create a level playing field) turn out to be unconvincing. The economic analysis of law provides several arguments against harmonization (regulatory competition enables satisfying a larger number of preferences, it enables learning effects, (centralized) legislators suffer from limited information and the possible influence of interest groups should be taken into account) and in favor of it (the need to internalize interstate externalities, the desire to avoid a race to the bottom, decreasing transaction costs and profiting from economies of scale). These arguments have to be weighed in order to reach a conclusion on the desirability of harmonization Such a weighing shows that there is, at best, a limited scope for harmonization of procedural law (and then only as an additional option). Harmonization would remove the possible learning effects and does not allow satisfying a larger number of preferences. The possible arguments in favor of harmonization of procedural law seem week, especially now procedural law is closely connected to the underlying substantive law. The only potentially strong argument is the reduction of transaction costs. It is ultimately an empirical matter if this argument outweighs the arguments against harmonization. The 2008 Oxford Civil Justice Survey in my view suggests {{that this is not the}} case...|$|E
40|$|In its {{approach}} to the regulation of the internal market, the EU has never accepted the traditional conception of <b>private</b> <b>law</b> as it has evolved in national legal systems. Whilst national <b>private</b> <b>laws</b> have been primarily concerned with justice between market participants rather than the pursuance of specific public goals, the EU has viewed <b>private</b> <b>law</b> as an instrument for achieving the collective objectives of European integration. This contribution explores {{the implications of the}} on-going process of the Europeanisation of <b>private</b> <b>law</b> for the traditional <b>private</b> <b>law</b> discourse in national legal systems and the role of <b>private</b> <b>law</b> scholarship. My argument, in a nutshell, is that the Europeanisation of <b>private</b> <b>law</b> reinforces the role of policy considerations related to the common good within a <b>private</b> <b>law</b> discourse, not only in areas that fall within the scope of EU law but also far beyond, further putting the traditional idea of <b>private</b> <b>law</b> under pressure; whilst public goals pursued by the EU are often compatible with the traditional <b>private</b> <b>law</b> concerns of doing justice between the parties, at times the two may come into conflict with each other. In its turn, the tendency towards the instrumentalisation of <b>private</b> <b>law</b> presents new challenges for the <b>private</b> <b>law</b> scholarship, strengthening the need for legal scholars to play a more pro-active role in shaping (European) <b>private</b> <b>law</b> than in has played so far...|$|R

40|$|The communitarization of {{the private}} law of the Member States {{has been given a}} {{significant}} impetus by the transfer of EC competence regarding judicial cooperation in civil matters from the third to the first pillar of the European Union. That is to say, under a new title of the EC Treaty, a single judicial area will be established; in terms of private law, the fields of private international law is involved to a large extent, whereas the civil procedure of the Member States will be affected to a lesser extent. In particular, the Community {{is in the process of}} transforming a number of conventions into secondary EC law, the most important one is the conversion into a Regulation of the Brussels Jurisdiction and Judgement Convention. Although the measures (to be) adopted in this context are ‘real’ acts of Community law – being based on the EC Treaty rather than the Treaty of European Union, the ‘normal’ regime for references for preliminary rulings does not apply. A more restricted regime is applicable. Also, the unity of Community law has been fragmented in that the measures are not binding on Denmark (the UK and Ireland are also not bound by acts adopted under this new Title but have opted in insofar as civil law measures are concerned). Harmonisation of <b>substantive</b> <b>private</b> <b>law,</b> unlike the conflicts of law and civil procedure, has not been affected significantly by the Treaty of Amsterdam.

40|$|<b>Private</b> <b>law</b> {{subjects}} like tort, contract, and property are traditionally {{taken to be}} {{at the core of the}} common law tradition, yet statutes increasingly intersect with these bodies of doctrine. This Article draws on recent work in <b>private</b> <b>law</b> theory and statutory interpretation to consider afresh what courts should do with <b>private</b> <b>law</b> in statutory gaps. In particular, it focuses on statutes touching on tort law, a field at the leading edge of <b>private</b> <b>law</b> theory. This Article 2 ̆ 7 s analysis unsettles some conventional wisdom about the intersection of <b>private</b> <b>law</b> and statutes. Many leading tort scholars and jurists embrace a regulatory conception of <b>private</b> <b>law</b> while also advocating courts 2 ̆ 7 independent judgment in statutory gaps. Much public law theory on statutory interpretation, however, challenges this preference for background law over legislative policy, at least when <b>private</b> <b>law</b> is understood primarily as public regulation. By contrast, the more a court views <b>private</b> <b>law</b> as a coherent practice autonomous from public regulation, the more justification it has to develop that doctrine amid legislative silence. This space for creativity can be most pronounced for statutory formalists like textualists, a counterintuitive implication given the latter approach 2 ̆ 7 s association with judicial restraint. Finally, the analysis illuminates the larger question of whether <b>private</b> <b>law</b> adjudication and scholarship need an intervention from public law theory in statutory interpretation. If as much law and scholarship presumes, <b>private</b> <b>law</b> is simply public regulation by adjudicative means, most every question at the junction of <b>private</b> <b>law</b> and legislation concerns statutory interpretation broadly understood. In that case, <b>private</b> <b>law</b> scholars 2 ̆ 7 indifference about public law scholarship in legislation is difficult to defend. By comparison, <b>private</b> <b>law</b> 2 ̆ 7 s innocence of statutory interpretation theory is more easily justified on noninstrumental assumptions about background doctrine...|$|R

40|$|Primary EU <b>Law</b> and <b>Private</b> <b>Law</b> Concepts {{starts with}} the {{hypothesis}} that the European Court of Justice has developed concepts in <b>private</b> <b>law</b> cases which differ in substance from the concepts that exist in the <b>private</b> <b>law</b> systems of the Member States. It aims to present developments in the current law of which EU lawyers and private lawyers generally are unaware. It offers ground-breaking analyses of the main <b>private</b> <b>law</b> concepts (the person, property, contract and tort and remedies) as they are used, created or adjusted by the Court. Each analysis results from insights obtained from the substantive meaning of the concepts deployed in the Court’s case law, disconnected from the national meanings of such concepts. The direction of this analysis is from the cases to the concepts, not the other way around: the cases and the facts behind the <b>private</b> <b>law</b> relationships are the starting point. In this way the analyses show in detail how primary EU <b>law</b> influences <b>private</b> <b>law</b> relationships...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{critically}} {{engages with}} the European Regulatory <b>Private</b> <b>Law</b> thesis (ERPL). The main strength of ERPL {{is that it}} offers an entirely new perspective on European <b>private</b> <b>law.</b> However, as a complete theory of European <b>private</b> <b>law,</b> ERPL is too one-sided, both from a descriptive and from a normative point of view. With its strong focus on the <b>private</b> <b>law</b> locked up in regulatory silos for specific market sectors, it obscures {{the reality of the}} consumer acquis and its transformative force. A fuller picture would include the contours of a loosely coherent system of European <b>private</b> <b>law</b> that is currently emerging. The main pillars of that pragmatic system are (for now) the withdrawal rights, unfair term control, and remedies for nonconformity. Moreover, the contribution of European <b>private</b> <b>law</b> to access justice cannot be the only standard for its evaluation and critique; at least as important are interpersonal justice and democratic legitimacy...|$|R
