The building is climate controlled, and displays reptile species {{from around the world}} including examples of the black-headed python, dugite, frilled dragon, turtle, olive python, perentie, pygmy python, reticulated python, south-west carpet python, tiger snake, Merten's water monitor, blue-tongued skink, <b>spiny-tailed</b> <b>lizard,</b> and woma.|$|E
25|$|There {{are roughly}} 235 species of reptiles. Of these, almost half {{live in the}} {{northern}} areas. Reptiles endemic to Somalia include the Hughes' saw-scaled viper, the Southern Somali garter snake, a racer (Platyceps messanai), a diadem snake (Spalerosophis josephscorteccii), the Somali sand boa, the angled worm lizard (Agamodon anguliceps), a <b>spiny-tailed</b> <b>lizard</b> (Uromastyx macfadyeni), Lanza's agama, a gecko (Hemidactylus granchii), the Somali semaphore gecko, and a sand lizard (Mesalina or Eremias). A colubrid snake (Aprosdoketophis andreonei) and Haacke-Greer's skink (Haackgreerius miopus) are endemic species.|$|E
25|$|Lizards turn up {{with some}} {{regularity}} as prey {{in some of the}} hotter, drier portions of the golden eagle's range. In Europe, lizards made up to 13% of the prey remains in the French Pyrenees and 12.7% in the Italian Apennines. Fairly large lizards, including the monitor lizard, make the most significant contribution to the golden eagle diet. The most important lizard prey in Europe is the Lacerta genus, i.e. the ocellated lizard (Lacerta lepida). Spiny-tailed lizards of the genus Uromastyx are also of particular note in the golden eagle's diet; they are reportedly the single most important prey for golden eagles in Northeast Africa. In the particularly sparse Negev Desert of Israel, the Egyptian <b>spiny-tailed</b> <b>lizard</b> (Uromastyx aegyptia) apparently comprised 89% of the diet, the most a single species has been reported to dominate a golden eagle's diet locally.|$|E

50|$|Uromastyx is a genus of African and Asian agamid lizards, {{the member}} species {{of which are}} {{commonly}} called <b>spiny-tailed</b> <b>lizards,</b> uromastyces, mastigures, or dabb lizards. Lizards in the genus Uromastyx are primarily herbivorous, but occasionally eat insects and other small animals, especially young lizards. They {{spend most of their}} waking hours basking in the sun, hiding in underground chambers at daytime or when danger appears. They tend to establish themselves in hilly, rocky areas with good shelter and accessible vegetation.|$|R

50|$|A {{great belt}} of deserts, {{including}} the Arabian desert, separates the Palearctic, Afrotropic and true Asian ecoregions. This scheme includes these desert ecoregions in the palearctic ecozone; other biogeographers identify the ecozone boundary as the transition zone between the desert ecoregions and the Mediterranean basin ecoregions to the north, which places the deserts in the Afrotropic, while others place the boundary {{through the middle}} of the desert. Gazelles, oryx, sand cats, and <b>spiny-tailed</b> <b>lizards</b> are some of the desert-desert-adapted species that survive in this extreme environment. Many species, such as the striped hyena, jackal and honey badger have become extinct in this area due to hunting, human encroachment and habitat destruction. Other species have been successfully re-introduced, such as the endangered Arabian oryx and the sand gazelle.|$|R

40|$|Many lizards use femoral gland {{secretions}} in intraspecific chemical communication, but specific compounds {{have been}} identified in only a few species. Chemical composition of secretions may depend on phylogeny, but it may also evolve to maximize efficacy of signals in a given environment. In deserts, the extreme dry and hot environmental conditions are hostile for chemical signals and, therefore, we expected desert lizards to have secretions with highly stable compounds. Using GC–MS, we identified 74 lipophilic compounds in femoral secretions of male and female <b>spiny-tailed</b> <b>lizards,</b> Uromastyx aegyptia microlepis (Fam. Agamidae), from the Qatar desert. Compounds included mainly steroids and fatty acids, but also terpenoids, ketones, tocopherol, aldehydes and alcohols. We found differences between males and females; males had higher proportions of fatty acids and tocopherol, but lower proportions of ketones than females. Contrary to expectations, the most abundant compounds were not stable in the desert climatic conditions at the surface. However, secretions could be rather adapted to microclimatic conditions inside burrows where these lizards spend long periods of time. We suggest that in addition to phylogenetic and environmental characteristics, we should know the ecology of a lizard species before making generalizations on the potential characteristics of its chemical signals.

50|$|The Arabian Desert {{is located}} in Western Asia. It is a vast desert {{wilderness}} stretching from Yemen to the Persian Gulf and Oman to Jordan and Iraq. It occupies most of the Arabian Peninsula, with an area of 2,330,000 km2. It is the fourth largest desert in the world, and the largest in Asia. At its center is the Rub'al-Khali, {{one of the largest}} continuous bodies of sand in the world.Gazelles, oryx, sand cats, and <b>spiny-tailed</b> <b>lizards</b> {{are just some of the}} desert-adapted species that survive in this extreme environment, which features everything from red dunes to deadly quicksand. The climate is mostly dry (the major part receives around 100 mm of rain per year but some very rare places receives down to 50 mm), and temperatures oscillate between very high heat and seasonal night time freezes. It is part of the Deserts and xeric shrublands biome and the Palearctic ecozone.This ecoregion holds little biodiversity, although a few endemic plants grow here. Many species, such as the striped hyena, jackal and honey badger have become extinct in this area due to hunting, human encroachment and habitat destruction. Other species have been successfully re-introduced, such as the sand gazelle, and are protected at a number of reserves. Overgrazing by livestock, off-road driving, and human destruction of habitat are the main threats to this desert ecoregion.|$|R
