5|$|Michael and Dwight {{meet with}} Jan, {{who is now}} a fairly {{successful}} office manager for a hospital and single mother. After Jan gives Michael a brutal description of why their relationship failed and he watches her play with her daughter Astrid, Michael reveals that he has herpes. He meets with Helene, Pam's mother, who is playing with CeCe at a playground; after an awkward conversation in which she also points out his skewed memory, he insults her and walks off. He meets with Carol while she is conducting an open house. Carol attempts to be polite, but then abruptly points out his faults too. Finally, Michael calls Holly one last time, only to get her voicemail. He leaves her a heartfelt message that what she said hurt him and that when he saw all his other exes, he had not been happy to <b>see</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> them, but when he talked to her, he was happy. He says that does not understand why she wants to downplay what they had, but he remembers their relationship perfectly and considers it special. Before hanging up, he awkwardly adds that she should be tested for herpes.|$|E

25|$|Moulin {{made the}} call for {{reporting}} officers to retreat from the 71st and Normandie area entirely at approximately 5:50 pm. They were sent to an RTD bus depot at 54th and Arlington and told to await further instructions. The command post formed at this location was activated at approximately 6:00 pm, but once set up had no cellular phones or computers other than those in squad cars. It had insufficient numbers of telephone lines and handheld police radios to assess {{and respond to the}} situation. Finally, the site had no televisions, which meant that as live broadcasts of unrest began, command post officers did not <b>see</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> the coverage for themselves.|$|E
500|$|The {{requirements}} {{for a new}} class of dreadnoughts were in a state of flux during 1907, but Vickers Ltd submitted a design that met the latest specifications and was very nearly accepted by the Navy for a [...] ship with twelve [...] guns in triple, superimposed turrets. However rumors of a contract with Vickers raised a public outcry as they had some problems with the armored cruiser [...] then building in England. The Naval Ministry defused the situation on 30 December 1907 by announcing an international design contest with the ship built in Russia regardless of the nationality of the winning firm. By the deadline of 12 March 1908 a total of 51 designs had been submitted by 13 different shipyards. The winner of the competition was a design from the German firm of Blohm & Voss, but the French protested that {{they did not want to}} <b>see</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> the money that they had loaned Russia to build up its defenses in German pockets. The Russians bought the design for 250,000 rubles and shelved it to placate both sides. A design by the Baltic Works had been the runner-up and was revised for the Navy's updated requirements with a complete design to be presented by 22 March 1909. This was extended by a month to allow the Baltic Works to finalize its contract with the British firm of John Brown & Company for design assistance with the hull form and machinery.|$|E
500|$|In August 2012, Marvel signed Joss Whedon to an {{exclusive}} contract through June 2015 for film and television. With the deal, Whedon would [...] "contribute creatively" [...] on Phase Two of the MCU {{and develop the}} first television series set in the universe. In March 2013, Whedon expanded on his consulting responsibilities, saying, [...] "I understand what Kevin [...] is going for and where he's heading, and I read the scripts and watch cuts {{and talk to the}} directors and writers and give my opinion. Occasionally there could be some writing. But I'm not trying to get in anybody's soup, I'm just trying to be helpful." [...] Whedon later elaborated that [...] "Since the story has already been approved and everybody knows what we're doing with Avengers 2, we can really lay it out. It's not like anyone's saying [...] "well I don't know, what if I need that?" [...] It's like [...] "doing this is troublesome for us, whereas doing this will actually help us." ... You want to honor {{the events of the last}} movie but you don't want to be beholden to them, because some people will see Avengers who did not <b>see</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> the movies in between or even Avengers 1." [...] He also found working in television and script doctoring to be [...] "great training ground for dealing with this ... because you're given a bunch of pieces and told to make them fit—even if they don't." ...|$|E

500|$|Panelists for the {{programme}} {{were announced}} shortly before it aired, and included some Benefits Street participants, {{as well as}} Mike Penning, a minister from the Department of Work and Pensions, Chris Bryant from the opposition, Daily Telegraph columnist Allison Pearson, political editor of The Huffington Post Mehdi Hasan, and John Bird. Owen Jones, who also participated in the programme, described it as [...] "a rowdy, chaotic show, based on the formula of [...] "who shouts loudest"." [...] This view was echoed by Neil Midgley of The Telegraph, who felt that both follow-up programmes [...] "didn't live up to [...] standards" [...] of the series, and that the debate had [...] "sparked a lot of shouting and tumult, but very little new wisdom". The Independents Daisy Wyatt said the programme had [...] "proved as rambling and unfocused as the documentary that sparked the hour-long studio show, with 'neutral' host Richard Bacon veering across topics and adding his own opinions Jeremy Kyle-style." [...] Zoe Williams of The Guardian found the debate [...] "unsatisfactory", feeling the topics discussed were too broad, and that [...] Bacon was not an effective chair. However, Roz Laws of the Birmingham Mail described the debate as [...] "articulate" [...] and felt that [...] "interesting points were made, such {{as the fact that}} most people on benefits are pensioners yet we didn't <b>see</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> them on Benefits Street." [...] The debate was watched by an average audience of 3.2 million.|$|E
500|$|By 1792 Sophia and {{her sister}} Mary were being {{included}} in more family activities, and at age fourteen, Sophia debuted at court on her father's birthday, 4 June 1792. According to biographer Christopher Hibbert, in her young adulthood Sophia was a [...] "delightful though moody girl, pretty, delicate and passionate." [...] As within her childhood, Sophia was devoted to her father, though she occasionally found him exasperating. She wrote that [...] "the dear King is all kindness to me, and I cannot say how grateful I feel for it." [...] Prior to 1788, King George had told his daughters {{that he would take}} them to Hanover and find them suitable husbands despite misgivings he had, which stemmed from his sisters' own unhappy marriages. He remarked, [...] "I cannot deny that I have never wished to <b>see</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> them marry: I am happy in their company, and do not in the least want a separation." [...] However, the King suffered his first bout of madness that year, when Sophia was aged eleven. Sophia remarked of her father's behaviour, [...] "He is all affection and kindness to me, but sometimes an over kindness, if you can understand that, which greatly alarms me." [...] Further lapses into insanity occurred in 1801 and 1804, thus forestalling talk of marriage for his daughters. The question of matrimony was rarely raised; Queen Charlotte feared the subject, something which had always discomforted the King, would push him back into insanity. Furthermore, the queen, strained from her husband's illness, wanted the princesses to remain close to her.|$|E
500|$|Following the crew's wake up, {{they set}} to work {{preparing}} for the mission's first spacewalk. Grunsfeld and Feustel suited up {{with the assistance of}} their EVA counterparts, Massimino and Good, and the spacewalk officially began when the two switched their suits to battery power at 12:52 UTC. At the start of the spacewalk, Feustel provided managers on the ground with a visual inspection report on the particulate matter seen earlier around the WFC3 box, reporting to the ground team that [...] "I don't really <b>see</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> those particles...It's almost imperceivable. I can see some few particles {{on the front of the}} W-SIPE, little, whitish, grey looking, real small. It's low density, too." [...] After getting their tools and equipment for the EVA set up, Grunsfeld and Feustel removed the old Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2, which was installed in 1993 during the telescope's first servicing mission, and replaced it with the new Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3). Feustel initially had trouble removing the bolts from the old camera, which after over fifteen years in space required more torque to remove than expected. After multiple attempts, managers on the ground decided to have Grunsfeld get a contingency torque limiter from the airlock, which would allow Feustel to apply more force without exceeding a specific point, but the bolt would still not release. The concern was that the bolt would shear, and the camera would be unable to be removed should that happened. Finally, managers approved Feustel to remove the limiter, and apply as much force as he safely thought it would take to release the bolt, which was successful.|$|E

500|$|On December 2, 2003, Spears {{announced}} {{through her}} official website US concerts {{to support her}} fourth studio album, In the Zone (2003). The tour would kick off on March 2 in San Diego, California, at iPayOne Center. However, Spears released a statement saying, [...] "I'm especially looking forward to bringing my tour to new markets and performing in front of fans {{that may not have}} had the opportunity to <b>see</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> my previous tours." [...] On January 12, 2004, four dates were announced in Glasgow, Manchester, London and Birmingham, her first UK dates in four years. After the beginning of the North American leg, Spears announced a summer leg in the United States in June as well as a European leg starting on April 27 in London and ending on June 5 at Rock in Rio Lisboa. It was also rumored to visit Latin America and Asia later in the year. The Onyx Hotel Tour was originally going to be called In the Zone Tour. On February 17, 2004, a San Diego clothing manufacturer of the same name sued Spears for $10 million and banned her from using the trademark. On May 17, 2004, a hotel named Onyx Hotel opened in Boston, Massachusetts. Kimpton Hotels & Restaurant Group had come up with the name two years before the tour was developed. Spears and the Kimpton group decided to promote the hotel by featuring a room named The Britney Spears Foundation Room. It was designed by Spears's mother, Lynne, reflecting Spears's personality and taste. The room opened six weeks later and a portion of the fee was destined to the Britney Spears Foundation.|$|E

2500|$|In 1876, Balakirev slowly began reemerging {{into the}} music world, but without the {{intensity}} of his former years. Stasov wrote Rimsky-Korsakov in July that Balakirev was busy composing his symphonic poem Tamara but still {{did not wish to}} <b>see</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> his old musical circle, [...] "for there would be talks about music, which he would not have under any circumstances. Nevertheless he inquires about everything with interest..." [...] Balakirev also began sending individuals to Rimsky-Korsakov for private lessons in music theory. This paved the way for Rimsky-Korsakov to make occasional visits to Balakirev. By the autumn these visits had become frequent. Also, Lyudmilla Shestarova asked him to edit Glinka's works for publication, in consort with Anatoly Lyadov and Rimsky-Korsakov.|$|E

2500|$|Merezhkovsky {{insisted upon}} {{severing}} all the International PEN's contacts with Communist Russia and cancelling French {{help for the}} victims of mass hunger in Russian Volga Region arguing, not unreasonably, that those in need won't ever <b>see</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> the money or food sent. He criticised the exiled Russian Constituent Assembly's communique which was, in his opinion, too conciliatory in tone. In 1922 the collection of articles and essays of the four authors (Merezhkovsky, Gippius, Filosofov contacts with whom have been restored, and Zlobin) came out under the title The Kingdom of Antichrist, the general idea of the book being that the 'Russian fires', globalist in their nature and intent, promise [...] "either brotherhood in slavery or the end in a common grave" [...] for the European nations.|$|E
2500|$|Neither is {{criticism}} of global citizenship anything new.

2500|$|In Gillette's rented room, {{authorities}} confiscated Brown's {{love letters}} to Gillette as evidence. District attorney George Ward read the letters aloud {{to the court}} during the trial {{in the fall of}} 1906, and Brown's letters gave the trial national attention. Brown pleaded with Gillette in the letters to accept responsibility for her condition, the pregnancy. In her final letter, written July 5, Brown looked forward to her impending Adirondack trip with Gillette, and she said farewell to her childhood home of South Otselic, wishing she could confess her pregnancy to her mother: [...] "I know I shall never <b>see</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> them again. And mamma! Great heavens, how I do love Mamma! I don't know what I shall do without her (...) Sometimes I think if I could tell mamma, but I can't. She has trouble enough as it is, and I couldn't break her heart like that. If I come back dead, perhaps if she does not know, she won't be angry with me." ...|$|E

A few {{visitors}} cheered these days, but, toward the end, he was frequently too sick to <b>see</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> them. By September 1830, Hazlitt was confined to his bed, with his son in attendance, his pain so acute that his doctor kept him drugged on opium much of the time. His last few days were spent in delirium, obsessed with some woman, which in later years gave rise to speculation: was it Sarah Walker? Or was it, as biographer Stanley Jones believes, {{more likely to have}} been a woman he had met more recently at the theatre? Finally, with his son and a few others in attendance, he died on 18 September. His last words were reported to have been [...] "Well, I've had a happy life".|$|E
2500|$|In {{the fall}} of 1941, Ribbentrop worked {{for the failure of}} the Japanese-American talks in Washington and for Japan to attack the United States. In October 1941 Ribbentrop ordered Eugen Ott, the German {{ambassador}} to Japan, to start applying pressure on the Japanese to attack the Americans as soon as possible. Ribbentrop argued to Hitler that a war between the United States and Germany was inevitable given the extent of American aid to Britain and the increasingly frequent [...] "incidents" [...] in the North Atlantic between U-boats and American warships guarding convoys to Britain. He said that having such a war start with a Japanese attack on the United States {{was the best way to}} begin it. Ribbentrop told Hitler that because of his four years in Canada and the United States before 1914, he was an expert on all things American; he thought that the United States was not a serious military power. On 4 December 1941, the Japanese Ambassador General Hiroshi Ōshima told Ribbentrop that Japan was on the verge of war with the United States. In turn, Ribbentrop promised that Germany would join the war against the Americans. On 7 December 1941, Ribbentrop was jubilant at the news of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and did his utmost to support a declaration of war on the United States. He delivered the declaration to the American Chargé d'Affaires Leland B. Morris on 11 December 1941. In the winter and spring of 1942, following American entry into war, the United States successfully pressured all of the Latin American states, except for Argentina and Chile, to declare war on Germany. Ribbentrop considered the acceptance of declarations of war from small states such as Costa Rica and Ecuador to be deeply humiliating, and he refused to <b>see</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> the Latin American ambassadors. He had Weizsäcker accept their declarations of war instead.|$|E
2500|$|On 12 August Rev. Gribble, {{accompanied}} by Inspector E. C. Mitchell of the Western Australian Aborigines Department in Wyndham, visited {{two of the}} alleged massacre sites identified by Tommy Doort, Mowerie and Gotegotemerrie. Mitchell reported that he found considerable evidence of attempts {{to clean up the}} site, which included the chipping away of stone to remove dark stains from a rock ledge, and that he had recovered a quantity of intact human teeth and skull fragments from the ashes of a large fire nearby. Mitchell sent a telegram to the Chief Protector, A.O. Neville: [...] "Shocking revelations, saw place Forrest River, rocky higher bed where natives chained small tree killed there then bodies burnt improvised oven". Two weeks later Chief Inspector Douglas visited both sites and noted finding dark stains that had human hairs attached on a rock slab behind a tree near where the fire had been. In September Douglas returned with Sulieman, a tracker who had ridden with the patrol. Following tracks from Mowerie and Gotegotemerrie to police camp 3 Sulieman pointed out the remains of a fire. He claimed that the Aboriginal trackers had been sent to destroy another police camp while St Jack and O'Leary remained with six chained prisoners, and that, on returning the next morning, they found Constable St Jack and O'Leary at a large fire. He did not <b>see</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> the prisoners killed, but [...] "knew that the bodies were in the fire". Arriving at camp 3 Sulieman stated that Regan, O'Leary and Murnane led nine prisoners in chains into a ravine, returning the next morning alone. Douglas followed tracks from camp 3 into the ravine where he [...] "found the remains of a large fire and some thousands of fragments of bone in the ashes". Douglas' report to the police commissioner stated: [...] "sixteen natives were burned in three lots; one, six and nine; only fragments (of) bone not larger than one inch remain".|$|E
