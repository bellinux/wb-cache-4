40|$|When private {{goods are}} {{publicly}} provided at subsidized prices, government authorities {{have to determine}} the distribution of services on recipients. Such distributions are commonly based on legal regulations and professional guidelines. Thus governments are assumed to develop <b>service</b> <b>standards</b> that are incorporated in the preferences for allocation of services. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to analyse the behavior of local governments when they are allocating home-care services on elderly and disabled clients. Based on Norwegian data it is demonstrated that <b>service</b> <b>standards</b> as well as economic constraints have an impact on the supply of home-care. As expected the supply to individual clients increases with the degree of disablement. The model estimates also show that <b>service</b> <b>standards</b> vary substantially between different client groups. For instance, service levels for mentally retarded are rather high compared to elderly clients in non-single households. Individual <b>service</b> <b>standards</b> are derived from observed behavior by means of model simulation, where the standards are defined for an average level of municipal incomes and prices. The results are used to evaluate the degree of mismatch between service supply and common <b>service</b> <b>standards</b> in different local communities.

40|$|Software {{development}} projects rarely are started or proceed without risks involving the technologies used. Typically, many facets {{of a project}} such as system functionality and tool support depend {{on the availability of}} a specific technology. This dependency poses risks: the required technology can disappear within the project 2 Ì† 7 s life cycle or a promised technology may not be available when it 2 Ì† 7 s required. A popular software technology today, Web <b>services</b> <b>standards,</b> is a widely supported approach to implementing a service-oriented architecture. Because Web <b>services</b> <b>standards</b> promise system interoperability and flexibility to large projects, commercial and government organizations are including it as the cornerstone of future computer-based systems. In fact, many systems currently being architected and designed assume the availability of products built upon a stable and effective set of Web <b>services</b> <b>standards.</b> This assumption presents project stakeholders with a large technology availability risk. This technical note discusses some of the challenges of using Web <b>services</b> <b>standards</b> and presents the results generated by an assessment tool used to track the appropriateness of using this technology.

40|$|Several {{international}} studies conducted confirmed that substantial economic benefits {{can be derived}} by improving the water and sanitation <b>services</b> <b>standards</b> in developing countries. The current free basic water <b>services</b> <b>standard</b> of the South Africa Government is set at the provision of 6 kl of safe drinking water per household per month, at a point of service, not further than 200 m away from every home. The terms of reference {{of this study was}} defined as the determination of the value proposition of moving up the water ladder from basic to intermediary (yard connection) water <b>services</b> <b>standard.</b> Model outputs confirmed that substantial socio-economic benefits are attainable if the free basic water <b>services</b> <b>standard</b> is increased to that of a yard connection. Government and Society, as a whole, benefits extensively, with a benefit/cost ratio of more than 30, when providing a basic service level communal stand pipe connection (4 kl/m). However, optimal benefits (+ 40) can be derived when all households are provided with at least a low pressure, 6 kl/m yard connection. Furthermore, consideration could even be given to increase the standard to 12 kl/m high pressure yard connection, although the step wise benefits/cost ratio is only 2. 6. The respective capital costs for delivering the three water <b>services</b> <b>standard</b> options were respectively determined as R 7. 5 b illion (communal standpipe), R 11. 7 b (yard, low pressure) and R 14. 1 b (yard, high pressure). Findings concluded that increasing the minimum water <b>services</b> <b>standard</b> to that of a 6 kl/month yard connection and investing accordingly, will reduce poverty, increase economic development, is good socio-economic policy and will generate sustainab le benefits for Government and Community...|$|R
