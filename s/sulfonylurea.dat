5|$|Xenon induces robust cardioprotection and neuroprotection {{through a}} variety of mechanisms. Through its {{influence}} on Ca2+, K+, KATP\HIF, and NMDA antagonism, xenon is neuroprotective when administered before, during and after ischemic insults. Xenon is a high affinity antagonist at the NMDA receptor glycine site. Xenon is cardioprotective in ischemia-reperfusion conditions by inducing pharmacologic non-ischemic preconditioning. Xenon is cardioprotective by activating PKC-epsilon and downstream p38-MAPK. Xenon mimics neuronal ischemic preconditioning by activating ATP sensitive potassium channels. Xenon allosterically reduces ATP mediated channel activation inhibition independently of the <b>sulfonylurea</b> receptor1 subunit, increasing KATP open-channel time and frequency.|$|E

40|$|The {{adenohypophysis}} contains high-affinity binding {{sites for}} antidiabetic <b>sulfonylureas</b> that are specific blockers of ATP-sensitive K+ channels.

2500|$|Microbial cytochromes P450 {{are often}} soluble enzymes and are {{involved}} in diverse metabolic processes. In bacteria the distribution of P450s is very variable with many bacteria having no identified P450s (e.g. E.coli). Some bacteria, predominantly actinomycetes, have numerous P450s (e.g.,). Those so far identified are generally involved in either biotransformation of xenobiotic compounds (e.g. CYP105A1 from Streptomyces griseolus metabolizes <b>sulfonylurea</b> herbicides to less toxic derivatives,) or are part of specialised metabolite biosynthetic pathways (e.g. CYP170B1 catalyses production of the sesquiterpenoid albaflavenone in Streptomyces albus,).

40|$|Abstract. <b>Sulfonylureas</b> such as BS 4231 and HB 419 stimulate insulin {{secretion}} {{in pieces}} of rat pancreatic tissue. Their insulinotropic effect requires {{the presence of}} a sufficient amount of calcium in the incubation medium. Both <b>sulfonylureas</b> markedly stimulate calcium uptake by isolated islets of Langerhans, their stimulant action being more marked in the absence of glucose or at low glucose concentration than at higher glucose levels. Theophylline alone does not stimulate insulin secretion, but it significantly enhances insulin release in the presence of BS 4231. This finding is interpreted as another indication that <b>sulfonylureas,</b> like glucose or leucine, favour calcium accumulation in the beta cell by modifying the balance between calcium influx and efflux across the plasma membrane. Heavy water, a microtubules‐stabilizer, inhibits the insulinotropic action of <b>sulfonylureas,</b> but does not affect BS 4231 ‐induced calcium uptake. These data suggest that the insulinotropic action of <b>sulfonylureas</b> results from the accumulation of calcium in the beta cell, and the subsquent activation of the microtubular‐microfilamentous system involved in the emiocytosis of insulin secretory granules.
