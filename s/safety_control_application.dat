40|$|The {{use of a}} {{modified}} remote control (RC) model car as a vehicle dynamics testing and development platform is detailed. Vehicle dynamics testing is {{an important aspect of}} automotive engineering and it plays a key role during the design and tuning of active <b>safety</b> <b>control</b> systems. Considering the fact that such tests are conducted at great expense, scaled model cars can potentially be used to help with the process to reduce the costs. With this view, we instrument and develop a standard electric RC model car into a vehicle dynamics testing platform. We then implement 2 representative active <b>safety</b> <b>control</b> <b>applications</b> based on this platform, namely an antilock brake system using open-loop pulse brake control and a roll-over prevention system utilizing lateral acceleration feedback. Both applications are presented with sensor measurements and the effectiveness of the suggested control algorithms are demonstrated. © TÜBİTAK...|$|R

The verification tool uses an interval-based constraint solver for non-linear robust constraints to compute incrementally refined abstractions. Although the problem is undecidable, we prove termination of abstraction refinement based verification of such properties for the class of robust non-linear hybrid systems, thus significantly extending previous semi-decidability results. We argue, that <b>safety</b> critical <b>control</b> <b>applications</b> are robust hybrid systems.

40|$|The Controller Area Network (CAN) is {{a vehicle}} bus {{standard}} {{for over two}} decades. In recent times CAN finds application in industrial automation as well, CAN is mostly employed for safety critical applications where low response time is essential. With the advent of wireless technology, {{there is a possibility}} for CAN messages to be exchanged wirelessly; there are several applications where wireless exchange of CAN messages is preferred. The Wireless Controller Area Network (WCAN) is a new approach of using CAN message-based protocol in wireless network. Message with higher priority gets transmitted first into the medium. This work investigates the possibilities to wirelessly communicate Controller Area Network (CAN) messages using the radio protocol IEEE 802. 15. 4, which is a very quick protocol and so the delays and jitter can be ignored in a small network.

40|$|The {{promises}} of nanotechnology have been realized {{to deliver the}} greatest scientific and technological advances in several areas. The biocidal activity of Metal nanoparticles in general and silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) depends on several morphological and physicochemical characteristics of the particles. Many of the interactions of the AgNPs with the human body are still poorly understood; consequently, the most desirable characteristics for the AgNPs are not yet well established. Therefore, the development of nanoparticles with well-controlled morphological and physicochemical features for application in human body is still an active area of interdisciplinary research. Effects {{of the development of}} technology of nanostructured compounds seem to be so large and comprehensive that probably it will impact on all fields of science and technology.

40|$|There is an {{increasing}} emphasis {{on the use of}} software to <b>control</b> <b>safety</b> critical plants for a wide area of applications. The importance of ensuring the correct operation of such potentially hazardous systems points to an emphasis on the verification of the system relative to a suitably secure specification. However, the process of verification is often made more complex by the concurrency and real-time considerations which are inherent in many applications. A response to this is the use of formal methods for the specification and verification of <b>safety</b> critical <b>control</b> systems. These provide a mathematical representation of a system which permits reasoning about its properties. This thesis investigates the use of the formal method Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP) for the verification of a <b>safety</b> critical <b>control</b> <b>application.</b> CSP is a discrete event based process algebra which has a compositional axiomatic semantics that supports verification by formal proof. The application is an industrial case study which concerns the concurrent control of a real-time high speed mechanism. It is seen from the case study that the axiomatic verification method employed is complex. It requires the user to have a relatively comprehensive {{understanding of the nature of}} the proof system and the application. By making a series of observations the thesis notes that CSP possesses the scope to support a more procedural approach to verification in the form of testing. This thesis investigates the technique of testing and proposes the method of Ideal Test Sets. By exploiting the underlying structure of the CSP semantic model it is shown that for certain processes and specifications the obligation of verification can be reduced to that of testing the specification over a finite subset of the behaviours of the process...|$|R
40|$|A SIFT {{reliable}} aircraft control computer system, {{designed to}} meet the ultrahigh reliability required for <b>safety</b> critical flight <b>control</b> <b>applications</b> by use of processor replications and voting, was constructed for SRI, and delivered to NASA Langley for evaluation in the AIRLAB. To increase confidence in the reliability projections for SIFT, produced by a Markov reliability model, SRI constructed a formal specification, defining the meaning of reliability in the context of flight control. A further series of specifications defined, in increasing detail, the design of SIFT down to pre- and post-conditions on Pascal code procedures. Mechanically checked mathematical proofs were constructed to demonstrate that the more detailed design specifications for SIFT do indeed imply the formal reliability requirement. An additional specification defined some of the assumptions made about SIFT by the Markov model, and further proofs were constructed to show that these assumptions, as expressed by that specification, did indeed follow from the more detailed design specifications for SIFT.

The automobile sector is another new application area for acceleration sensors, e. g. as a colision sensor for airbags or for driving <b>safety</b> <b>control</b> systems. The <b>application</b> of acceleration sensors in heavy and large machines has not been researched yet. Silicon micromechanic delivers decisive advantages. Micromechanic acceleration sensors with on-chip readout circuits can detect small signals and translate them into an interference-proof signal, such as a digital data format.

In this work a sensor system has been developed that meets the special requirements of heavyload manipulation systems. The geometrical structure of the sensor has been adapted to the acceleration range of large manipulators. In addition, a new almost exclusively digital readout circuit has been developed. This special circuit allows the measurement of high precision accelerations during regular operation, but can also detect very high accelerations (shock), e. g. those generated by the collision of the manipulator with another object. First measurements of the fabricated sensorstructures and the readout circuit demonstrate the performance of the design...|$|R

Mobile wireless sensor networks are self-organising mobile networks where nodes exchange data without the need for an underlying infrastructure. In the road transport domain, schemes which are fully infrastructure-less and those which use a combination of fixed (infrastructure) devices and mobile devices fitted to vehicles and other moving objects are of significant interest to the ITS community as they have the potential to deliver a ‘connected environment’ where individuals, vehicles and infrastructure can co-exist and cooperate, thus delivering more knowledge about the transport environment, the state of the network and who indeed is travelling or wishes to travel.

40|$|In this thesis, we {{consider}} the <b>safety</b> <b>control</b> problem for Hidden Mode Hybrid Systems (HMHS), which are a special class of hybrid automata in which the mode is not available for control. For these systems, <b>safety</b> <b>control</b> {{is a problem with}} imperfect state information. We tackle this problem by introducing the notion of non-deterministic discrete information state and by then translating the problem to one with perfect state information. The perfect state information control problem is obtained by constructing a new hybrid automaton, whose discrete state is an estimate of the HMHS mode and is thus available for control. This problem is solved by computing the capture set and the least restrictive control map for the new hybrid automaton. Sufficient conditions for the termination of the algorithm that computes the capture set are provided. We show that the solved perfect state information control problemis equivalent to the original problemwith imperfect state information under suitable assumptions on the original HMHS. A multi-vehicle roundabout test-bed is developed that employs scaled vehicles that are designed to have longitudinal dynamical response similar to a full scale vehicle. The application of the proposed formal hybrid control approach to the collision avoidance problem between an autonomous vehicle and a human driven vehicle at a traffic intersection is experimentally illustrated in the multi-vehicle test-bed. We model the human driving behavior through a hybrid automaton, whose current mode is determined by the driver’s decisions. On the autonomous vehicle, we implement formal methods for <b>safety</b> <b>control,</b> in which a mode estimator identifies in real time the current human driving behavior and uses this information to update a hybrid feedback map. The experimental results demonstrate that the solution proposed in this thesis is substantially less conservative than solutions employing worst-case design.
