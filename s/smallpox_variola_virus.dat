40|$|Vaccinia fetalis, the {{vertical}} transfer of vaccinia virus from mother to fetus, {{is a relatively}} rare but often fatal complication of primary vaccinia virus vaccination during pregnancy. To date {{there has been no}} attempt to develop an animal model to study the pathogenesis of this acute viral infection in vivo. Here we report that infection of gestating BALB/c mice by either intravenous or intraperitoneal routes with the Western Reserve strain of vaccinia virus results in the rapid colonization of the placenta and vertical transfer of virus to the developing fetus. Systemic maternal infections during gestation lead to the death of all offspring prior to or very shortly after birth. Using in situ hybridization for vaccinia virus mRNA to identify infected cells, we show that the virus initially colonizes cells lining maternal lacunae within the trophospongium layer of the placenta. The study of this model will significantly enhance our understanding of the pathogenesis of fetal vaccinia virus infections and aid in the development of effective treatments designed {{to reduce the risk of}} vaccinia virus-associated complications during pregnancy.

RsaI digest electropherograms of the amplified DNAs of the former subgroup provided species differentiation, and TaqI digests differentiated the Eurasian-African orthopoxviruses, including vaccinia virus from the vaccinia virus subspecies buffalopox virus.

However, many of these processes require VACV replication to be tightly controlled. RNA interference (RNAi) is a powerful tool for in vitro silencing of mRNAs that are complementary to 19 - 21 base pairs (bp) of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). This project outlines the design and preliminary analysis of two inducible RNAi silencing constructs targeting multiple VACV essential genes during VACV replication.

40|$|Immunization against <b>smallpox</b> (<b>variola</b> <b>virus)</b> with Dryvax, a live {{vaccinia virus}} (VV), was effective, but now safety {{is a major}} concern. To {{overcome}} this issue, subunit vaccines composed of VV envelope proteins from both forms of infectious virions, including the extracellular enveloped virion (EV) protein B 5, are being developed. However, since B 5 has 23 amino acid differences compared with its B 6 variola virus homologue, B 6 {{might be a better}} choice for such a strategy. Therefore, we compared the properties of both proteins using a panel of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) to B 5 that we had previously characterized and grouped according to structural and functional properties. The B 6 gene was obtained from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the ectodomain was cloned and expressed in baculovirus as previously done with B 5, allowing us to compare the antigenic properties of the proteins. Polyclonal antibodies to B 5 or B 6 cross-reacted with the heterologous protein, and 16 of 26 anti-B 5 MAbs cross-reacted with B 6. Importantly, 10 anti-B 5 MAbs did not cross-react with B 6. Of these, three have important anti-VV biologic properties, including their ability to neutralize EV infectivity and block comet formation. Here, we found that one of these three MAbs protected mice from a lethal VV challenge by passive immunization. Thus, epitopes that are present on B 5 but not on B 6 would generate an antibody response that would not recognize B 6. Assuming that B 6 contains similar variola virus-specific epitopes, our data suggest that a subunit vaccine using the variola virus homologues might exhibit improved protective efficacy against smallpox...|$|E

Increased expression of inflammatory proteins was observed in response to both viruses. Although the increased expression resolved for a subset of proteins, such as C-reactive protein, S 100 A 8, and S 100 A 9, high expression levels persisted for other proteins, including vitamin D-binding protein and fibrinogen γ. Structural and metabolic proteins were substantially decreased in lung fluid exclusively during MPXV and not VV infection.

40|$|<b>Smallpox</b> (<b>variola</b> <b>virus)</b> is a {{bioweapon}} concern. Monkeypox is {{a growing}} zoonotic poxvirus threat. These problems have resulted in extensive efforts to develop potential therapeutics that can prevent or treat potentially lethal poxvirus infections in humans. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against smallpox are a conservative approach to this problem, as the licensed human smallpox vaccine (vaccinia virus, VACV) primarily works {{on the basis of}} protective antibody responses against smallpox. Fully human mAbs (hmAbs) against vaccinia H 3 (H 3 L) and B 5 (B 5 R), targeting both the mature virion (MV) and extracellular enveloped virion (EV) forms, have been developed as potential therapeutics for use in humans. Post-exposure prophylaxis was assessed in both murine and rabbit animal models. Therapeutic efficacy of the mAbs was assessed in three good laboratory practices (GLP) studies examining severe combined immunodeficiency mice (SCID) given a lethal VACV infection. Pre-exposure combination hmAb therapy provided significantly better protection against disease and death than either single hmAb or vaccinia immune globulin (VIG). Post-exposure combination mAb therapy provided significant protection against disease and death, and appeared to fully cure the VACV infection in ≥ 50 % of SCID mice. Therapeutic efficacy was then assessed in two rabbit studies examining post-exposure hmAb prophylaxis against rabbitpox (RPXV). In the first study, rabbits were infected with RPVX and then provided hmAbs at 48 hrs post-infection, or 1 hr and 72 hrs post-infection. Rabbits in both groups receiving hmAbs were 100 % protected from death. In the second rabbitpox study, 100 % of animal treated with combination hmAb therapy and 100 % of animals treated with anti-B 5 hmAb were protected. These findings suggest that combination hmAb treatment may be effective at controlling smallpox disease in immunocompetent or immunodeficient humans...|$|E

40|$|<b>Smallpox,</b> {{caused by}} <b>variola</b> <b>virus,</b> was a devastating disease in humans, but how the virus evolved a {{strategy}} to spread to tissue remains unknown. Through the use of microarrays, we identified the gene encoding the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP), {{one of the five}} known WASP family members, which has been induced in the course of infection of human cells with different strains of vaccinia virus (VV) (S. Guerra, L. A. López-Fernández, A. Pascual-Montano, M. Muñoz, K. Harshman, and M. Esteban, J. Virol. 77 : 6493 - 6506, 2003; S. Guerra, L. A. López-Fernández, R. Conde, A. Pascual-Montano, K. Harshman, and M. Esteban, J. Virol. 78 : 5820 - 5834, 2004). In a mouse model, we evaluated the role of WASP in infection with VV, a close relative of <b>variola</b> <b>virus.</b> WASP−/− (KO) mice infected intranasally and intraperitoneally with VV showed reduced weight loss and mortality compared to wild-type (WT) mice. WASP expression correlated with VV replication in the ovaries but not in the liver or spleen. WT mouse macrophages express WASP but not N-WASP; after VV infection, WASP levels increase threefold. KO macrophages lack N-WASP expression and, when VV infected, are incapable of inducing actin tails and producing extracellular virus. These functions were rescued in KO macrophages after ectopic WASP expression. Overall, our findings demonstrate that WASP has a role in orthopoxvirus infections.

40|$|<b>Smallpox</b> <b>virus</b> (<b>variola)</b> poses a {{significant}} threat {{as an agent}} of bioterrorism. To mitigate this risk, antiviral drugs and an improved vaccine are urgently needed. Satisfactory demonstration of protective efficacy against authentic variola will require development of an animal model in which variola produces a disease course with features consistent with human smallpox. Toward this end, cynomolgus macaques were exposed to several variola strains through aerosol and/or i. v. routes. Two strains, Harper and India 7124, produced uniform acute lethality when inoculated i. v. in high doses (109 plaque-forming units). Lower doses resulted in less fulminant, systemic disease and lower mortality. Animals that died had profound leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, and elevated serum creatinine levels. After inoculation, variola was disseminated by means of a monocytic cell-associated viremia. Distribution of viral antigens by immunohistochemistry correlated with the presence of replicating viral particles demonstrated by electron microscopy and pathology in the lymphoid tissues, skin, oral mucosa, gastrointestinal tract, reproductive system, and liver. These particles resembled those seen in human smallpox. High viral burdens in target tissues were associated with organ dysfunction and multisystem failure. Evidence of coagulation cascade activation (D dimers) corroborated histologic evidence of hemorrhagic diathesis. Depletion of T cell-dependent areas of lymphoid tissues occurred, probably as a consequence of bystander apoptotic mechanisms initiated by infected macrophages.

40|$|<b>Smallpox,</b> {{caused by}} <b>variola</b> <b>virus</b> (VARV), is a devastating human disease that {{affected}} millions worldwide until the virus was eradicated in the 1970 s. Subsequent cessation of vaccination {{has resulted in}} an immunologically naive human population that would be at risk should VARV {{be used as an}} agent of bioterrorism. The development of antivirals and improved vaccines to counter this threat would be facilitated by the development of animal models using authentic VARV. Towards this end, cynomolgus macaques were identified as adequate hosts for VARV, developing ordinary or hemorrhagic smallpox in a dose-dependent fashion. To further refine this model, we performed a serial sampling study on macaques exposed to doses of VARV strain Harper calibrated to induce ordinary or hemorrhagic disease. Several key differences were noted between these models. In the ordinary smallpox model, lymphoid and myeloid hyperplasias were consistently found whereas lymphocytolysis and hematopoietic necrosis developed in hemorrhagic smallpox. Viral antigen accumulation, as assessed immunohistochemically, was mild and transient in the ordinary smallpox model. In contrast, in the hemorrhagic model antigen distribution was widespread and included tissues and cells not involved in the ordinary model. Hemorrhagic smallpox developed only in the presence of secondary bacterial infections – an observation also commonly noted in historical reports of human smallpox. Together, our results support the macaque model as an excellent surrogate for huma...|$|R
40|$|Smallpox is a {{contagious}} {{and often}} fatal disease {{caused by the}} <b>variola</b> <b>virus,</b> an orthopox virus. Three other orthopox viruses (vaccinia, cowpox, and monkeypox) also can infect humans. <b>Variola</b> <b>virus</b> is fragile and can be killed with standard hospital disinfectants, heat, or ultraviolet light. In laboratory tests, 90 % of aerosolized smallpox virus died within 24 hours. There is no specific treatment for smallpox, although vaccination is effective as a preventive measure. The smallpox vaccine is made from vaccinia virus. Smallpox survivors have life-long immunity, but often are left scarred and sometimes blind. There are two variants of smallpox: variola major and variola minor. Variola major has a fatality rate of approximately 30 %; more than 90 % of variola major infections are “classic ” (or “ordinary”) <b>smallpox.</b> <b>Variola</b> minor is less virulent and has a fatality rate of less than 1 %. Two other rare forms of smallpox- hemorrhagic smallpox and flat smallpox- have fatality rates of> 90 %. Modified smallpox, which occurs in vaccinated individuals, generally has a mild course. Aggressive vaccination campaigns in the 1960 s and 1970 s led to the eradication of smallpox worldwide. The last reported case of smallpox in New Mexico occurred in 1949; the last naturally occurring case worldwide (a case of variola minor) occurred in Somalia in 1977. Routine smallpox vaccination in the United States stopped in 1972...|$|R
40|$|Smallpox, once {{a devastating}} disease caused by <b>Variola</b> <b>virus,</b> {{a member of}} the Orthopoxvirus genus, was {{eradicated}} in 1980. However, the importance of <b>variola</b> <b>virus</b> infections has been stressed widely in the last few years, particularly following recent social events in the world. Today, <b>variola</b> <b>virus</b> is considered {{to be one of the}} most significant agents with potential use as a biological weapon. In this study we developed an internally controlled real-time PCR assay for rapid detection and simultaneous differentiation of <b>variola</b> <b>virus</b> from other orthopoxviruses. The assay is based on TaqMan 3 ′-minor groove binder (MGB) chemistry and uses generic primers, designed in highly conserved genomic regions of the crmB gene, and three TaqMan MGB probes designed to identify orthopoxviruses, <b>variola</b> <b>virus,</b> and an internal control. The results obtained suggest that the assay is rapid, sensitive, specific, and suitable for the generic detection of orthopoxviruses and the identification of <b>variola</b> <b>virus</b> and avoids false-negative results in a single reaction tube...|$|R
