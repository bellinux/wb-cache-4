25|$|In the Quechua {{community}} of Highland Peru, {{there is no}} separation between adults and children. This allows for children to learn storytelling through their own interpretations of the given story. Therefore, children in the Quechua community are encouraged {{to listen to the}} <b>story</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> being told in order to learn about their identity and culture. Sometimes, children are expected to sit quietly and listen actively. This enables them to engage in activities as independent learners.|$|E
25|$|Several stories {{within the}} Mahābhārata took on {{separate}} identities {{of their own}} in Classical Sanskrit literature. For instance, Abhijñānaśākuntala by the renowned Sanskrit poet Kālidāsa (c. 400 CE), believed to {{have lived in the}} era of the Gupta dynasty, is based on a <b>story</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> the precursor to the Mahābhārata. Urubhaṅga, a Sanskrit play written by Bhāsa who is believed to have lived before Kālidāsa, is based on the slaying of Duryodhana by the splitting of his thighs by Bhīma.|$|E

25|$|Ironically, {{the current}} revival of her {{reputation}} rides {{on the work}} Oroonoko (1688), a <b>story</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> taken to promote modern, progressive views on gender, race and class. Todd maintains that the fiction has been co-opted by modern interests and that such views are not views that Behn clearly expressed. Her reputation is not helped {{by the fact that}} almost nothing is known of her first 27 years; and while she was a pioneer, she also faced debt for much of her life and was a propagandist and writer for hire. She was ambitious, desiring fame and literary prestige, which for a woman of the time and in times since, is often regarded as suspect.|$|E
25|$|The Sims Stories is {{a series}} of {{computer}} games from The Sims series released in 2007–2008 that is based on a modified version of The Sims 2 engine. This modified game engine is optimized for play on systems with weaker specifications such as laptops. As such, its system requirements are lower than that of The Sims 2, but it can still be played on desktops. One feature of this game, if played on a laptop, is the auto-pause function, which stops and starts the game when the lid is closed and opened, respectively. This series is introduced mainly for three segments of the market: those who wish to play The Sims 2 on their laptops (which usually have lower specifications); those who wish to engage in other activities such as instant messaging while playing the game, and; those who are new to the franchise. In addition to a Free Play mode with classic, open-ended game play, the games contain a structured, linear Story mode where players are required to complete a series of goals in order to progress in the storyline. While Life Stories and Pet Stories each contain two separate stories, Castaway Stories contains one <b>story</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> double the length of any one story in the first two games. As an introductory series, major features are removed or modified from those in The Sims 2. For example, fears are completely removed in all three games, and the elder life stage is completely removed in Pet Stories. Officially, the save files from this series are not compatible with the main The Sims 2 games. However, players have experienced success at adapting some files.|$|E

With [...] "Only the Lonely", co-written with Joe Melson and {{recorded}} by Bill Porter, Orbison's songs turned to introspective and plaintive ballads, and they fully employed his powerful three-octave vocal range backed by more orchestral accompaniment. A recurring musical theme in many of Orbison's songs is a climax in a <b>story</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> represented by a raw, emotionally vulnerable confession sung in an [...] "eerily high falsetto", according to author Peter Lehman.|$|E

Director Hirani has [...] compared this format to the films of Charlie Chaplin and Laurel and Hardy, {{as well as to}} the James Bond series. Others have also likened the series to the work of Laurel and Hardy. Some, however, have negated this comparison, stating that the series is more akin to the Road to...

500|$|Feige {{described}} the film's use of 3D as serving the storytelling, saying, [...] "hopefully it helps bend people’s minds {{even more than}} with just the flat screen." [...] He said that [...] "there are sequences of the film that 3D is actually necessary to tell the dimensional <b>story</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> happening through visuals". However, he noted that during visual effects reviews for the film {{it became apparent that}} these sequences were adversely affecting the story when viewed in 2D, which necessitated adjustments so the sequences would work in all formats. Over one hour of footage in the film was [...] "specially formatted" [...] for IMAX.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} the first of the series to be penned by Jandt, who said that the {{opportunity}} to work on the series was [...] "both thrilling and a bit daunting, primarily because of the elevated expectations of such a high-profile, established franchise."

[...] Writing for Dr. Octopus in particular was difficult for the first-time writer as he had [...] "such a range of character." ...|$|E

500|$|Reviews of [...] "White Tulip" [...] were {{overwhelmingly}} positive. Ken Tucker from Entertainment Weekly {{enjoyed the}} episode, writing [...] "Fringe is becoming ever more adroit at blending its mythology with its paranormal cases". He also praised guest star Peter Weller's performance. After initially expecting a [...] "filler" [...] episode, Ramsey Isler of IGN {{said he was}} [...] "pleasantly proven wrong", as the [...] "story {{turned out to be}} one of the best of the series". Isler continued that [...] "the writers really did a good job of integrating the overall mythology into a standalone <b>story</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> actually damn good... It's brilliant storytelling". Andrew Hanson of Los Angeles Times enjoyed the episode, but wished Astrid got more screen time.|$|E
500|$|The {{monologue}} {{segment is}} often {{followed by a}} segment featuring an exchange with a correspondent—typically introduced as the show's [...] "senior" [...] specialist in the subject at hand—either at the anchor desk with the host or reporting from a false location {{in front of a}} greenscreen showing stock footage. Their stated areas of expertise vary depending on the news <b>story</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> being discussed, and can range from relatively general (such as Senior Political Analyst) to absurdly specific (such as Senior Religious Registry Correspondent). The cast of correspondents is quite diverse, and many often sarcastically portray extreme stereotypes of themselves to poke fun at a news story, such as [...] "Senior Latino Correspondent", [...] "Senior Youth Correspondent" [...] or [...] "Senior Black Correspondent". They typically present absurd or humorously exaggerated takes on current events against the host's straight man.|$|E
500|$|In , Mason Templar {{states that}} the series is not [...] "just {{one of the best}} kids' manga in translation, it's one of the very best manga {{available}} in English, period."

500|$|Likewise, several reviewers {{expressed}} {{frustration with}} the lack of a full-body shot of Clark in the Superman suit, as well as the way in which Superman was presented as flying through the use of CGI. TV Line ranked the fact that Clark Kent [...] "barely suits up" [...] in the finale as one of [...] "TV's 20 Biggest Disappointments of 2011", writing that [...] "we never quite were treated to seeing the series star clad in the full costume, in flying mode", although they wrote that it was [...] "a super-nitpick". Carabott called the CGI effects [...] "a little shoddy", but that they made up [...] "one of the most important moments of the series". Peterson and Souders, however, were reportedly [...] "thrilled" [...] by the [...] "great debate", noting that [...] "what [...] wanted to do all along was show hints at where he was going, because [...] is a whole different <b>story</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> yet to be told." ...|$|E
500|$|In the 1970s Carlos Baker {{wrote of}} the stories from In Our Time, and {{specifically}} [...] "Indian Camp", {{that they were a}} remarkable achievement. Hemingway scholars, such as Benson, rank [...] "Indian Camp" [...] as one of Hemingway's [...] "greatest short stories," [...] a <b>story</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> described as [...] "best known", [...] "violent" [...] and [...] "dramatic". In 1992, Frederick Busch wrote in The New York Times that Hemingway had gone out of fashion. While his antisemitism, racism, violence, and attitudes toward women and homosexuals made him objectionable by current standards, he turned violence into art unlike any other American writer of his time by showing that [...] "the making of art is a matter of life or death, no less". Busch believes Hemingway's characters either faced life or chose death, a choice shown most starkly in [...] "Indian Camp". The saving of a life in [...] "Indian Camp" [...] {{is at the center of}} much of Hemingway's fiction, Busch writes, and adds power to his fiction.|$|E
500|$|God of War {{received}} {{praise for}} its voice acting.

[...] Eric Blattberg of PlayStation Universe stated that the voice acting is a great feature of the game, that narrator Linda Hunt's [...] "authentic voice really helps set the attitude during the unbelievable ’s", and that Kratos [...] "acts and sounds like a badass." [...] Kristan Reed of Eurogamer wrote, [...] "Even the straight-laced voice work is handled with an expertise so sadly lacking in most other videogames." [...] Raymond M. Padilla of GameSpy, wrote {{that some of the}} voice acting and music tracks are overstated; one of his few dislikes in the game. Matt Leone of 1UP wrote that [...] "There's a mixture of in-game characters that speak to you and extremely nice CG sequences that show moments such as flashbacks, and it all blends together surprisingly well." ...|$|E
