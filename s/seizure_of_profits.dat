50|$|Despite some criticism, Operation Strong Safety {{and similar}} efforts have seen several large <b>seizures</b> <b>of</b> illegal drugs being trafficked from Mexico. In many cases, <b>seizures</b> <b>of</b> drug <b>profits</b> and weapons being transported south {{across the border}} have also been recovered, along with {{numerous}} vehicles, many of them stolen. Law enforcement presence in many border counties has dramatically increased as well. Hidalgo County, for example, tripled its DPS station from 20 to 60 permanently assigned troopers during Operation Border Star, the predecessor to OSS. No troopers or other DPS officers have been killed while participating in the operations.|$|R

60|$|XXXIV. That, towards {{providing}} for these extravagant demands, he, the said Warren Hastings, did direct and authorize another {{breach of the}} public faith given in the treaty of Chunar. For whereas, by the second article of the treaty aforesaid, {{it was left to}} the Nabob's discretion whether or not he should resume the landed estates, called jaghires, within his dominions, and notwithstanding the said Hastings, in defence of the said article, did declare that the Nabob should be left to the exercise of his own authority and pleasure respecting them, yet he, the said Hastings, did authorize a violent compulsion to be used towards the said Nabob for accomplishing an universal confiscation of that species of landed property; and in so doing he did also compel the Nabob to break his faith with all the landholders of that description, not only in violating the assurance of his own original grants, but his assurance recently given, when, being pressed by the Company, he, the Nabob, had made a temporary <b>seizure</b> <b>of</b> the <b>profits</b> <b>of</b> the lands aforesaid, {{in the manner of a}} compulsory loan, for the repayment of which he gave his bonds and obligations; and although he had at the same time solemnly pledged his faith that he never would again resort to the like oppressive measure, yet he, the said Warren Hastings, did cause him to be compelled to confiscate the estates of at least sixty-seven of the principal persons of his country, comprehending therein his own nearest relations and the ancient friends and dependants of his family: the annual value of the said estates thus confiscated amounting to 435,000l. sterling, or thereabouts, upon an old valuation, but stated by the Resident, Middleton, as being found to yield considerably more.|$|R

500|$|The Fourth Amendment proscribes {{unreasonable}} <b>seizure</b> <b>of</b> any person, person's home (including its curtilage) {{or personal}} property without a warrant. A <b>seizure</b> <b>of</b> property occurs {{when there is}} [...] "some meaningful interference with an individual's possessory interests in that property", such as when police officers take personal property away from an owner to use as evidence, or when they participate in an eviction. The amendment also protects against unreasonable <b>seizure</b> <b>of</b> persons, including a brief detention.|$|R
30|$|Finally, {{we examine}} the {{relationship}} between Colombian cocaine <b>seizures</b> and <b>seizures</b> <b>of</b> opium and marijuana by Mexican authorities, using data obtained from the Mexican Ministry of Defense (SEDENA). The results of this analysis are shown in panel C in Table 10 in Appendix. We find no significant correlation between Colombian cocaine <b>seizures</b> and <b>seizures</b> <b>of</b> either opium or marijuana. This suggests a reduction in cocaine arriving in Mexico did not coincide with increased <b>seizures</b> <b>of</b> other drug cartel transport.|$|R
