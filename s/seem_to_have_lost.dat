5|$|As Tikal and its {{hinterland}} reached peak population, {{the area}} suffered deforestation, erosion and nutrient loss {{followed by a}} rapid decline in population levels. Tikal and its immediate surroundings <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>lost</b> most of their population between 830 and 950 and central authority seems to have collapsed rapidly. There is not much evidence from Tikal {{that the city was}} directly affected by the endemic warfare that afflicted parts of the Maya region during the Terminal Classic, although an influx of refugees from the Petexbatún region may have exacerbated problems resulting from the already stretched environmental resources.|$|E
25|$|The {{power of}} Athens {{declined}} following its {{defeat in the}} Peloponnesian War against the Spartans. From that time on, the theatre started performing old tragedies again. Although its theatrical traditions <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>lost</b> their vitality, Greek theatre continued into the Hellenistic period (the period following Alexander the Great's conquests {{in the fourth century}} BCE). However, the primary Hellenistic theatrical form was not tragedy but 'New Comedy', comic episodes about the lives of ordinary citizens. The only extant playwright from the period is Menander. One of New Comedy's most important contributions was its influence on Roman comedy, an influence that {{can be seen in the}} surviving works of Plautus and Terence.|$|E
25|$|Eugene left Vienna {{in early}} June 1716 with a field army of between 80,000–90,000 men. By early August 1716 the Ottoman Turks, some 200,000 men under the sultan's son-in-law, the Grand Vizier Damat Ali Pasha, were marching from Belgrade towards Eugene's {{position}} {{west of the}} fortress of Petrovaradin on the north bank of the Danube. The Grand Vizier had intended to seize the fortress; but Eugene gave him no chance to do so. After resisting calls for caution and forgoing a council of war, the Prince decided to attack immediately {{on the morning of}} 5 August with approximately 70,000 men. The Turkish janissaries had some initial success, but after an Imperial cavalry attack on their flank, Ali Pasha's forces fell into confusion. Although the Imperials lost almost 5,000 dead or wounded, the Turks, who retreated in disorder to Belgrade, <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>lost</b> double that amount, including the Grand Vizier himself who had entered the mêlée and subsequently died of his wounds.|$|E

25|$|Mercian {{military}} {{success was}} {{the basis of their}} power; it succeeded not only 106 kings and kingdoms by winning set-piece battles, but by ruthlessly ravaging any area foolish enough to withhold tribute. There are a number of casual references scattered throughout the Bede's history to this aspect of Mercian military policy. Penda is found ravaging Northumbria as far north as Bamburgh and only a miraculous intervention from Aidan prevents the complete destruction of the settlement. In 676 Æthelred conducted a similar ravaging in Kent and caused such damage in the Rochester diocese that two successive bishops gave up their position because of lack of funds. In these accounts there is a rare glimpse of the realities of early Anglo-Saxon overlordship and how a widespread overlordship could be established in a relatively short period. By the middle of the 8th century, other kingdoms of southern Britain were also affected by Mercian expansionism. The East Saxons <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>lost</b> control of London, Middlesex and Hertfordshire to Æthelbald, although the East Saxon homelands do not seem to have been affected, and the East Saxon dynasty continued into the ninth century. The Mercian influence and reputation reached its peak when, in the late 8th century, the most powerful European ruler of the age, the Frankish king Charlemagne, recognised the Mercian King Offa's power and accordingly treated him with respect, even if this could have been just flattery.|$|E

500|$|During the 15th century Bristol was the second-most {{important}} port in the country, {{trading with}} Ireland, Iceland and Gascony. It was {{the starting point}} for many voyages, including Robert Sturmy's (1457–58) unsuccessful attempt to break the Italian monopoly of Eastern Mediterranean trade. [...] New exploration voyages were launched by Venetian John Cabot, who in 1497 made landfall in North America. A 1499 voyage, led by merchant William Weston of Bristol, was the first expedition commanded by an Englishman to North America. During {{the first decade of the}} 16th century Bristol's merchants undertook a series of exploration voyages to North America and even founded a commercial organisation, 'The Company Adventurers to the New Found Land', to assist their endeavours. However, they <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>lost</b> interest in North America after 1509, having incurred great expenses and made little profit.|$|E

500|$|Notwithstanding the {{rebellion}} {{and death in}} battle against the king of Suffolk's son and heir, the duke does not <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>lost</b> the trust of King Henry. He was once again appointed trier at the 1487 parliament, and mustered men for Henry's expedition the next year. Around {{the same time he}} also lost the constableship of Wallingford again. Although Suffolk did not actually lose much under Henry Tudor, his heirs were to suffer. At the 1487 parliament that Suffolk attended, Lincoln was attainted for treason; Suffolk kept his own lands and also those he had granted Lincoln; but this was only for his life, and on de la Pole's death, these estates were to revert to the crown. This was not long to be effected. Although Suffolk seems still to have been alive on 14 May 1492, when he sat as county JP he was certainly dead six days later. He was buried, wearing the mantle of the Order of the Garter, in the college he founded at Wingfield in Suffolk in a 'splendid' tomb which belied the [...] "discreet obscurity" [...] in which he had spent his final years. His effigy portrays him as being bearded, [...] "with wavy hair bound with a jewelled fillet and ear ring in the right ear." [...] Elizabeth, who died later, was buried next to him wearing a widow's barbe.|$|E
500|$|More {{negative}} reception {{came from}} the magazine Empire, where reviewer Ian Nathan compared the film to New Coke, saying that [...] "it utterly failed". Phil Villarreal believed that there were [...] "too few laugh-worthy moments" [...] and that [...] "instead of stretching to new frontiers, the film rests on the familiar". Sheila Johnston criticized the pacing of the film and its joke level saying that [...] "the overall momentum flags at times" [...] {{and that it was}} [...] "a salvo of comic squibs, some very funny, others limp". David Edwards agreed with this, writing that although [...] "there's a great half-hour show rattling around...the rest is padding at its very dullest", concluding that it [...] "isn't a terrible film, just a terribly disappointing one." [...] Cosmo Landesman believed, [...] "the humour <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>lost</b> its satirical bite and wit" [...] and that [...] "much of the comedy is structured around the idiocy of Homer". This assessment was shared by Carina Chocano of the Los Angeles Times, who felt that [...] "once the movie wanders into its contemplation of mortality and meaning, the trenchancy kind of creaks and falls off." [...] She negatively compared it to [...] (1999), a film similarly adapted from an animated television series, saying that, in terms of satire, it offers [...] "nothing we don't hear every night on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart." [...] Bruce Newman criticized the fleeting appearances of many of the show's secondary characters, and found the film to be [...] "a disappointment".|$|E
2500|$|A century later, {{according}} to various documents, the Grignan family {{appears to have}} become well established.

2500|$|The {{survival}} of the Confederacy depended on a strong base of civilians and soldiers devoted to victory. The soldiers performed well, though increasing numbers deserted {{in the last year}} of fighting, and the Confederacy never succeeded in replacing casualties as the Union could. The civilians, although enthusiastic in 1861–62, <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>lost</b> faith in the future of the Confederacy by 1864, and instead looked to protect their homes and communities. As Rable explains, [...] "This contraction of civic vision was more than a crabbed libertarianism; it represented an increasingly widespread disillusionment with the Confederate experiment." ...|$|E
2500|$|At 8:23 pm (20:23) local time, the Italian Conference of Bishops {{released}} a statement congratulating Cardinal Angelo Scola of Milan on his election as pope. A corrected statement was {{released a}}t 9:09 pm (21:09). As cardinals described the voting process, carefully suppressing details {{so as not to}} violate their oath of secrecy, one offered this assessment, that [...] "Scola might have won" [...] and [...] "is obviously qualified to be pope", but there was [...] "a very strong bias against the Italians." [...] He added: [...] "There was a sense that the Italians aren't up to the job anymore. They used to be so good, but lately they <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>lost</b> control of things." ...|$|E

2500|$|While {{working on}} his {{graduate}} thesis in geography in the Sierra Nevada, Ish is bitten by a rattlesnake. As he heals from the bite, he gets sick with a disease that looks like measles and he moves {{in and out of}} consciousness. He recovers and makes his way back to civilization, only to discover that most people died from the same disease. He goes to his home in Berkeley. In the city near his home Ish meets few human survivors – a man drinking himself to death, a couple who <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>lost</b> their sanity, and a teenage girl who flees from him as someone dangerous. He comes across a dog (a beagle bitch), friendly and eager to join him. [...] The dog, which he names Princess, swiftly adopts Ish as her new master and sticks by him for much of the book. He sets out on a cross-country tour, traveling all the way to New York City and back, scavenging for food and fuel as he goes. As he travels, he finds small pockets of survivors, but has doubts about humanity's ability to survive the loss of civilization.|$|E
