40|$|Background: In {{minimally}} invasive surgery, force feed-back information on tissue manipulation is altered by {{friction between the}} instrument and the sealing mecha-nism of the trocar. It is unknown how the different sealing mechanisms of currently available trocars influ-ence the friction forces. The current study investigated the dynamic changes in friction for various trocars at different instrument velocities. Methods: The friction characteristics for six common types of trocars were determined. A force sensor {{was attached to the}} shaft of a standard 5 -mm disposable grasper to measure the forces required to move it through the trocars. Movement velocity and direction of the shaft were controlled by a servomotor. In addition, whether moistening the shaft reduced friction was tes-ted. Results: The friction depended on the type of trocar, the movement velocity, and the movement direction, and varied between 0. 25 and 3. 0 N. Specifically, trocars with narrow <b>sealing</b> <b>caps</b> (i. e., high normal force onto the shaft) and trocars with thick <b>sealing</b> <b>caps</b> (i. e., large contact area) generate a high amount of friction. Moistening the shaft reduced friction 15 % to 45 %. For most trocars, large fluctuations in forces occur when the movement starts or when the direction reverses. The magnitude of these fluctuations varied between 0. 2 and 2. 5 N. Conclusions: For some trocars, friction can be as great as the forces associated with instrument–tissue interac-tion. At movement reversals, friction fluctuates due to deformations of the rubber and silicon parts of the sealing mechanism. Such high variance can deteriorate surgical performance during high precision tasks (e. g., tissue manipulation) that typically involve many chan-ges in movement direction. Comparisons of the inves-tigated trocars indicate that the friction magnitude and variance can be reduced easily by changing the proper-ties of the <b>sealing</b> <b>cap</b> or by lubricating the instruments...|$|R

40|$|The {{resonant}} {{shells of}} vibratory cylinder gyroscopes are commonly packaged in metallic caps. In order {{to lower the}} production cost, a portion of vibratory cylinder gyroscopes do not employ vacuum packaging. However, under non-vacuum packaging conditions there can be internal acoustic noise leading to considerable acoustic pressure which is exerted on the resonant shell. Based on {{the theory of the}} structural-acoustic coupling, the dynamical behavior of the resonant shell under acoustic pressure is presented in this paper. A finite element (FE) model is introduced to quantitatively analyze the effect of the structural-acoustic coupling. Several main factors, such as <b>sealing</b> <b>cap</b> sizes and degree of vacuum which directly affect the vibration of the resonant shell, are studied. The results indicate that the vibration amplitude and the operating frequency of the resonant shell will be changed when the effect of structural-acoustic coupling is taken into account. In addition, an experiment was set up to study the effect of structural-acoustic coupling on the sensitivity of the gyroscope. A 32. 4 mV/°/s increase of the scale factor and a 6. 2 Hz variation of the operating frequency were observed when the radial gap size between the resonant shell and the <b>sealing</b> <b>cap</b> was changed from 0. 5 mm to 20 mm...|$|R
