40|$|ABSTRACT. In August 2012, A/chicken/Vietnam/OIE- 2215 / 2012 (H 5 N 2) was {{isolated}} from a {{chicken in a}} live bird market (LBM) in Northern Vietnam. Intravenous pathogenicity test revealed that this virus is highly pathogenic in chickens. The PA, HA, NP and M, PB 2 and NA, and PB 1 and NS genes of the isolate were phylogenetically closely related to those of A/duck/Vietnam/OIE- 2202 / 2012 (H 5 N 1) of clade 2. 3. 2. 1, A/chicken/Vietnam/OIE- 1611 / 2012 (H 9 N 2) and A/chicken/Vietnam/OIE- 2468 / 2012 (H 9 N 2), respectively. All of these viruses were isolated from birds in LBMs in the same province. These results indicate that A/chicken/Vietnam/OIE- 2215 / 2012 (H 5 N 2) is a genetic reassortant and that surveillance of avian influenza in LBMs and <b>stamping</b> <b>out</b> <b>policy</b> are essential for the eradication of highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses from Asia...|$|E
40|$|Peste des petits {{ruminants}} virus (PPRV) causes {{an acute}} and highly contagious disease and {{belongs to the}} family Paramyxoviridae and genus Morbillivirus. The control of animal diseases {{is one of the}} primary objectives of government livestock departments in Pakistan. Control of any viral disease requires rapid, specific and sensitive diagnostic tests and efficacious vaccines. Small ruminants infected with PPRV are routinely diagnosed on the basis of clinical examination, gross pathology, histological findings and laboratory confirmation. A number of serological and molecular diagnostic tests are used for the detection of PPRV. Control of PPRV may be attained using measures including movement control of sheep and goats from affected areas, quarantine of infected animals, removal of potentially infected fomites and a restriction on the importation of sheep and goats from infected areas. The effective way to control PPR in Pakistan is by mass immunization of small ruminants as strict sanitary control measures, including the <b>stamping</b> <b>out</b> <b>policy</b> are not economically viable. Therefore, the control of PPR requires an effective vaccine and for this purpose several vaccines such as homologous and recombinant vaccines have been developed...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe genus Pestivirus {{contains}} four recognized species: classical {{swine fever}} virus, Border disease virus, bovine viral diarrhoea virus types 1 and 2. All are economically important and globally distributed but {{classical swine fever}} is the most serious, concerning losses and control measures. It affects both domestic pigs and wild boars. Outbreaks of this disease in domestic pigs call for the most serious measures of disease control, including a <b>stamping</b> <b>out</b> <b>policy</b> in Europe. Since {{all the members of}} the Pestivirus genus can infect swine, differential diagnosis using traditional methods poses some problems. Antibody tests may lack specificity due to cross-reactions, antigen capture ELISAs may have low sensitivity, and virus isolation may take several days or even longer time to complete. PCR-based tests overcome these problems for the most part, but in general lack the multiplexing capability to detect and differentiate all the pestiviruses simultaneously. The assay platform described here addresses all of these issues by combining the advantages of real-time PCR with the multiplexing capability of microarray technology. The platform includes a TaqMan real-time PCR designed for the universal detection of pestiviruses and a microarray assay that can use the amplicons produced in the real-time PCR to identify the specific pestivirus...|$|E

40|$|Avian Influenza {{disease has}} been {{spread out in}} Indonesia since August 2003 and every year Avian Influenza {{patients}} prevalence has increased. Until August 2007, Avian Influenza cases in Indonesia had cumulated to 105 cases, and 84 people had died. Avian Influenza cases of 70 people died, had been occured in Java Island. The policy on stamping outbird races at certain radius in regions which Avian Influenza virus has been detected, and bird compensation policy that cost low for a bird have many feedbacks from the community who owns birds, as denies these cases. In Indonesian culture, especially the Javanese, people live {{very close to the}} bird races. The Javanese culture see that the bird races are not just an ordinary herd, but they are taking care bird races because they like very much and as a social symbol status in the social life. The bird races have a lighest point in economic and social status. The condition shows that there are dilemma in health point of view that the bird races could be the source of avian influenza virus spread out. In the other hand the economic and social status on bird races have a precious point in the Javanese culture.   Key words: Avian influenza, the <b>stamping</b> <b>out</b> <b>policy,</b> the compensation policy, Javanese culture, bird races</p...|$|E
40|$|H 5 N 2 viruses were {{isolated}} from cloacal swab samples of apparently healthy chickens in Taiwan in 2003 and 2008 during surveillance of avian influenza. Each of the viruses was eradicated by stamping out. The official diagnosis report {{indicated that the}} Intravenous Pathogenicity Indexes (IVPIs) of the isolates were 0. 00 and 0. 89, respectively, indicating that these were low pathogenic strains, although the hemagglutinin of the strain isolated in 2008 (Taiwan 08) had multibasic amino acid residues at the cleavage site (PQRKKR/G). In the present study, these H 5 N 2 viruses were assessed for their intravenous and intranasal pathogenicity for chickens. It was examined whether Taiwan 08 acquires pathogenicity through consecutive passages in chickens. Intravenous pathogenicity of Taiwan 08 depended upon {{the age of the}} chickens used for the IVPI test; all of the eight-week-old chickens intravenously inoculated with Taiwan 08 showed clinical signs but survived for ten days post inoculation (IVPI= 0. 68), whereas all the six-week-old chickens died (IVPI= 1. 86). Taiwan 08 -P 8, which were passaged in chickens for eight times, killed all the eight-week-old chickens (IVPI= 2. 36). The four-week-old chickens died after intranasal inoculation of Taiwan 08 -P 8, indicating that Taiwan 08 must have become highly pathogenic during circulation in chicken flocks. These results emphasize the importance of a <b>stamping</b> <b>out</b> <b>policy</b> for avian influenza even if the IVPI of the causal virus is low...|$|E
40|$|Transmission of infl uenza (H 5 N 1) {{virus from}} birds to humans {{is a serious}} public health threat. In South Korea, serologic {{investigation}} among 2, 512 poultry workers exposed during December 2003 –March 2004 to poultry with confi rmed or suspected infl uenza (H 5 N 1) virus infection found antibodies in 9. Frequency of bird-to-human transmission was low. The highly pathogenic avian influenza (H 5 N 1) virus has posed a serious public health threat since 1997, when the first transmission of the virus from birds to humans was reported in Hong Kong (1, 2). In South Korea, during December 2003 –March 2004, this virus caused 19 outbreaks in 7 provinces (10 outbreaks on chicken farms and 9 on duck farms), which prompted a massive mobilization to cull birds and contain the outbreak (3). Vaccination of poultry against influenza (H 5 N 1) virus was legally prohibited, and a <b>stamping</b> <b>out</b> <b>policy</b> was considered as a control option. Culling of ≈ 5 million birds was conducted on all farms with infected poultry and all poultry farms within a 3 km–radius protection zone. All persons {{who participated in the}} culling operations were equipped with World Health Organization (WHO) – recommended personal protective equipment (PPE) (4).

40|$|Outbreaks {{of highly}} {{pathogenic}} Avian Influenza occurred previously for 3 consecutive years, 2006, 2007 and 2008, in Kano State, Nigeria, causing heavy economic losses to farmers and the government. It was {{against this background}} that Avian Influenza (AI) surveillance study in commercial poultry farms in the State was conducted. Haemagglutination Inhibition (HI) test was conducted to determine the presence of AI H 5 antibodies in 1, 160 sera obtained from flocks in 33 Avian influenza affected (AF) and 25 Non Avian influenza-affected (NAF) farms. To complement the study, 320 cloacal swabs obtained from flocks in farms that were serologically positive for AI H 5 antibodies, were further subjected to Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR), {{to determine if the}} chickens were shedding AI viruses. Of the 1, 160 sera tested, 150 (12. 9 %) were positive for AI H 5 antibodies, with flocks in 16 (27. 6 %) of the farms being positive. Prevalence rates of 14. 1 and 11. 4 % and mean antibody titres of 5. 4 ± 0. 2 and 4. 6 ± 0. 1 log 2 for AI H 5 antibodies were obtained for AF and NAF farms, respectively. The RT-PCR results showed that all the 320 cloacal swabs tested were negative for AI H 5 viruses. The antibodies detected between flocks in the AF and NAF farms might be attributed to vaccination and the titres determined were above the minimum protection level recommended by the OIE. It was recommended that vaccination of chickens against AI should be discouraged because it may interfere with the <b>stamping</b> <b>out</b> <b>policy</b> adopted by Nigeria in the control and eradication of the disease...|$|E
40|$|Pre-print to the {{original}} available via the link: [URL] cross sectional {{study was conducted to}} investigate seroprevalence of brucellosis and the associated risk factors in cattle from smallholder dairy farms in Gokwe, Marirangwe, Mushagashe, Nharira, Rusitu and Wedza areas of Zimbabwe. A total of 1440 cattle from 203 herds were tested serially for Brucella antibodies using Rose Bengal test (RBT) and the competitive ELISA (c-ELISA). Weighted seroprevalence estimates were calculated and risk factors in individual cattle investigated using logistic regression analysis. The overall individual animal brucellosis seroprevalence was low, with mean of 5. 6 % (95 % CI: 4. 4 %, 6. 8 %). Gokwe had the highest individual (12. 6 %; 95 % CI: 3. 9 %, 21. 4 %) and herd-level (40. 0 %; 95 % CI: 22. 1 %, 58. 0 %), while Wedza had the lowest individual (2. 3 %; 95 % CI: 0 %, 5. 3 %) and herd-level (8. 0 %; 95 % CI: 0. 0 %, 18. 9 %) brucellosis seroprevalence, respectively. In individual cattle, the area of origin, age and history of abortion were independently associated with brucellosis seroprevalence. While the seroprevalence was independent of sex, it decreased with increasing age. Cattle 2 - 4 years old had higher odds (OR = 3. 2; 95 % CI: 1. 1, 9. 1) of being seropositive compared to those > 7 years. Cows with a history of abortion {{were more likely to be}} seropositive (OR= 7. 9; 95 % CI: 3. 1, 20. 1) than controls. In conclusion, the area-to area variation of brucellosis may be linked to ecological factors and differences in management practices. The implementation of <b>stamping</b> <b>out</b> <b>policy,</b> bleeding and testing animals before movement and promoting the use self-contained units are likely to significantly reduce the public health risks associated with Brucella infections in cattle...|$|E
40|$|Two highly {{contagious}} diseases, Peste des Petits Ruminants and Sheep and Goat Pox, constitute main constraints {{to small}} ruminants production {{in many countries}} in Asia, the Near and Middle East and Africa. Peste des Petits Ruminants (PPR), also known {{in the past as}} goat plague, is a highly contagious viral disease affecting domestic and wild small ruminants. It is caused by a virus which belongs to the Morbillivirus genus of Paramyxoviridae family: the Peste des Petits Ruminants Virus (PPRV). It is a rinderpest-like infection of goats and sheep characterized by erosive stomatitis, enteritis, pneumonia and death. Economically, it is the most important small ruminant disease in areas where it is endemic. In the same regions, there is a second contagious viral disease, Sheep and goat pox. The responsible pathogens, the sheeppox virus (SPPV) and goatpox virus (GTPV), cause acute to sub acute disease of infected sheep and goats respectively. The clinical signs of infection may include generalized pox lesions throughout the skin and mucous membranes, persistent fever, lymphadenitis, and often a focal pneumonia and nodules lesions distributed uniformly throughout the lungs. There is no curative medical treatment against these two viral diseases. Therefore, the only way of tackling them is by means of sanitary and medical prophylaxis. Sanitary prophylaxis to be effective needs the existence of efficient veterinary services, the implementation of animal movement controls with sometimes the <b>stamping</b> <b>out</b> <b>policy.</b> The cost needed for the effective implementation of these means in a short period is too high for most of countries where these diseases are endemic. Therefore the only way for effective control of PPR and sheep and goat pox in those countries is the medical prophylaxis, i. e. the vaccination. Currently, efficient attenuated vaccines exist against each of these diseases. Unfortunately, in most cases they are used only in case of outbreaks to limit their extension. The cost of the logistic needed for systematic vaccination campaigns of small ruminants against either PPR or capripox may be too high for countries if only the individual economic value of goat or sheep, excluding their social value, is considered. The way to cut down this cost is the use of polyvalent vaccine which would enable, in one shot, the protection of animals against more than one economic important disease. The objective of our thesis work was to develop a recombinant thermostable (a characteristic linked to capripoxes) vaccine {{that could be used to}} protect sheep and goats against both PPR and capripox and thereby that would contribute to cut down the cost of vaccination campaigns. For that, the complementary DNA, cDNA, corresponding to the gene of PPRV immune protective proteins, the fusion (F) and the haemagglutinin (H) proteins were inserted into the genome of the attenuated strain capripox virus strain KS 1. Such a recombinant vaccine may be thermotolerant, a characteristic of poxviruses and this may improve the quality of the vaccine for its use in hot climate conditions. Capripox viruses are highly host-specific microorganisms. They are not pathogenic to human and their host range is limited to cattle and small ruminants and possibly buffaloes. Therefore they constitute an ideal and safe vector for the development of recombinant vaccines for use against ruminant diseases. The present manuscript in which we report on the results we have obtained during our thesis work is composed of the following different parts: a general introduction, a literature review of PPR and capripox viruses, the construction of two recombinant vaccines FPPR/Capripox and HPPR/Capripox, the comparison of efficacy of three poxvirus promoters in HPPR...|$|E
