You have to try, at least. I was so embarrassed by just everything. I just didn’t {{want to be that}} person that just went down after all of that. A lot of the time in the sessions, they weren’t letting me write. They were giving me tracks and doing it all. I was like, Why am I here? Then I got the perfect {{combination}} of people to really <b>support</b> <b>me</b> and make me feel confident. It was an amazing awakening. I walked into the session and I was like, You gotta know, I don’t care about anything except the truth right here.|$|E

25|$|The {{good news}} is, I'm finally {{working on my}} debut retail album. It sounds amazing so far. Everyone is excited about it. The bad news is, no more free music. Odds are, ever. No loopholes. Which means, Vampire Sunlight {{might be the last}} free release, and The Evil Microchip will not drop. Not even on YouTube. Sorry, Markus. But a major thank you is in order for {{everyone}} who's helped me this far. Everyone from Boe and Dre to Jimmy Iovine. All the graphic designers who have made covers, all the fans who uploaded my music, everyone. Thank you. My digital revolution has taken the Galaxy by storm, and I'm proud of it. It's just time to take things to a higher level. Hopefully, yall will <b>support</b> <b>me.</b> I'm not gonna throw the fact you've heard all my secrets for free in your face. But honestly, I would personally appreciate it if you went out and supported whatever I put in stores. More news to come, but once again, no free music indefinitely. Hold your head, kids...|$|E

500|$|The barons {{captured}} Ladislaus in the Szepesség in January 1288. Although his partisans soon liberated him, he acquiesced in concluding {{an agreement}} with Archbishop Lodomer. The archbishop absolved Ladislaus on condition that the king would live in accordance with Christian morals. However, Ladislaus broke his promise. He abducted his sister, Elizabeth, prioress of the Dominican Monastery of the Blessed Virgin on Rabbits' Island, and gave her in marriage to a Czech aristocrat, Zavis of Falkenstein. According to Archbishop Lodomer, Ladislaus even stated, [...] "If I had 15 or more sisters in as many cloistered communities as you like, I would snatch them from there to marry them off licitly or illicitly; in order to procure through them a kin-group who will <b>support</b> <b>me</b> by all their power in the fulfillment of my will".|$|E

500|$|Anti-German {{sentiment}} rose {{among the}} British public, in newspapers, and in elite gentlemen's clubs, where resentment was inflamed by Admiral Lord Charles Beresford despite Churchill's remonstrances. Driven by public opinion, Churchill asked Prince Louis to resign as First Sea Lord on 27 October 1914. When acceptance of Battenberg's resignation was delayed by the King's {{opposition to the}} appointment of Fisher in his place, Louis wrote to Churchill, [...] "I beg of you to release me. I am {{on the verge of}} breaking down & I cannot use my brain for anything". On 13 November he wrote to Churchill's Naval Secretary, Rear-Admiral Horace Hood, [...] "It was an awful wrench, but I had no choice from the moment it was made clear to me that the Government did not feel themselves strong enough to <b>support</b> <b>me</b> by some public pronouncement." ...|$|E
500|$|Although {{both were}} {{committed}} O.T.O. members, Northrup's usurpation of Helen's role led to {{conflict between the}} two sisters. The reactions of Parsons and Helen towards Northrup were markedly different. Parsons told Helen to her face that he preferred Northrup sexually: [...] "This {{is a fact that}} I can do nothing about. I am better suited to her temperamentally – we get on well. Your character is superior. You are a greater person. I doubt that she would face what you have with me – or <b>support</b> <b>me</b> as well." [...] Some years later, addressing himself as [...] "You", Parsons told himself that his affair with Northrup (whom he called Betty) marked a key step in his growth as a practitioner of magick: [...] "Betty served to affect a transference from Helen at a critical period ... Your passion for Betty also gave you the magical force needed at the time, and the act of adultery tinged with incest, served as your magical confirmation in the law of Thelema." ...|$|E
500|$|Later that year, Górecki {{learned of}} an {{inscription}} scrawled {{on the wall}} of a cell in a German Gestapo prison in the town of Zakopane, which lies {{at the foot of the}} Tatra mountains in southern Poland. The words were those of 18-year-old Helena Wanda Błażusiakówna, a highland woman incarcerated on 25 September 1944. It read O Mamo, nie placz, nie. Niebios Przeczysta Królowo, Ty zawsze wspieraj mnie (Oh Mamma do not cry, no. [...] Immaculate Queen of Heaven, you <b>support</b> <b>me</b> always). The composer recalled, [...] "I have to admit that I have always been irritated by grand words, by calls for revenge. Perhaps in the face of death I would shout out in this way. But the sentence I found is different, almost an apology or explanation for having got herself into such trouble; she is seeking comfort and support in simple, short but meaningful words". He later explained, [...] "In prison, the whole wall was covered with inscriptions screaming out loud: 'I'm innocent', 'Murderers', 'Executioners', 'Free me', 'You have to save me'—it was all so loud, so banal. Adults were writing this, while here it is an eighteen-year-old girl, almost a child. And she is so different. She does not despair, does not cry, does not scream for revenge. She does not think about herself; whether she deserves her fate or not. Instead, she only thinks about her mother: because it is her mother who will experience true despair. This inscription was something extraordinary. And it really fascinated me." ...|$|E

2500|$|Sundaygar Dearboy {{was born}} in District 2, Grand Bassa County, Liberia. He {{is the father of}} two and the {{guardian}} of several others. Dearboy graduated with a degree in Criminal Justice from AME Zion College. He is the Project Manager for Liberia Trading & Investment Company (LINTRACO), one of Liberia's newest trading groups. Dearboy has a huge following among Liberians in the diaspora, particularly in the United States. In an interview posted on Oberia.net, Sundaygar said: [...] "Outside Liberia, my music is highly appreciated and supported by those who think my music helps virtually transport and reconnect them with their homeland. I find it gratifying that they <b>support</b> <b>me.</b> However, it is very disappointing that such support is not given to my music or artists locally. I also think that my music comes fore front as we rebuild our lives and try to reconsolidate our culture and tradition." [...] Speaking on the challenges currently facing the Liberian Music Industry, Dearboy said: [...] "Not many local artists listen to other music and try to emulate or learn from them. Plus, the local market is not accustomed to promoting what belongs to them. They prefer something from outside. Perhaps, the generally quality of production does not meet the standard as those produced in other countries." ...|$|E
2500|$|In late 1975, he {{audition}}ed for the Broadway play A Matter of Gravity. Katharine Hepburn watched his audition and cast him as her character's grandson in the play. With Hepburn's {{influence over the}} CBS network, Reeve worked out the schedules of Love of Life and the play {{so that he would}} be able to do both. Because of his busy schedule, he ate candy bars and drank coffee in place of meals, and suffered from exhaustion and malnutrition. On the first night of the play's run, Reeve entered the stage, said his first line, and then promptly fainted. Hepburn turned to the audience and said, [...] "This boy's a goddamn fool. He doesn't eat enough red meat." [...] The understudy finished the play for him, and Reeve was treated by a doctor who advised him to eat a more healthy diet. He stayed with the play throughout its year-long run and was given very favorable reviews. He and Hepburn became very close. She said, [...] "You're going to be a big star, Christopher, and <b>support</b> <b>me</b> in my old age." [...] He replied, [...] "I can't wait that long." [...] A romance between the two was rumored in some gossip columns. Reeve said, [...] "She was sixty-seven and I was twenty-two, but I thought that was quite an honor...I believe I was fairly close to what a child or grandchild might have been to her." [...] Reeve said that his father, who was a professor of literature and came to many of the performances, was the man who most captivated Hepburn. When the play moved to Los Angeles in 1976, Reeve— to Hepburn's disappointment— dropped out. They stayed in touch for years after the play's run. Reeve later regretted not staying closer instead of just sending messages back and forth.|$|E
