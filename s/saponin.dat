25|$|In 1939, Russell Marker, a {{professor}} of organic chemistry at Pennsylvania State University, developed a method of synthesizing progesterone from plant steroid sapogenins, initially using sarsapogenin from sarsaparilla, which proved too expensive. After three years of extensive botanical research, he discovered a much better starting material, the <b>saponin</b> from inedible Mexican yams (Dioscorea mexicana and Dioscorea composita) found in the rain forests of Veracruz near Orizaba. The <b>saponin</b> could be converted in the lab to its aglycone moiety diosgenin. Unable to interest his research sponsor Parke-Davis in the commercial potential of synthesizing progesterone from Mexican yams, Marker left Penn State and in 1944 co-founded Syntex with two partners in Mexico City. When he left Syntex a year later the trade of the barbasco yam had started and {{the period of the}} heyday of the Mexican steroid industry had been started. Syntex broke the monopoly of European pharmaceutical companies on steroid hormones, reducing the price of progesterone almost 200-fold over the next eight years.|$|E
500|$|Protein {{molecules}} {{that do not}} bind to cell membranes or the cytoskeleton are dissolved in the cytosol. The amount of protein in cells is extremely high, and approaches 200mg/ml, occupying about 20-30% {{of the volume of}} the cytosol. However, measuring precisely how much protein is dissolved in cytosol in intact cells is difficult, since some proteins appear to be weakly associated with membranes or organelles in whole cells and are released into solution upon cell lysis. [...] Indeed, in experiments where the plasma membrane of cells were carefully disrupted using <b>saponin,</b> without damaging the other cell membranes, only about one quarter of cell protein was released. These cells were also able to synthesize proteins if given ATP and amino acids, implying that many of the enzymes in cytosol are bound to the cytoskeleton. However, the idea {{that the majority of the}} proteins in cells are tightly bound in a network called the microtrabecular lattice is now seen as unlikely.|$|E

Modern works treat it in detail, discussing chemical constituents, how to identify the product and its pharmaceutical uses.

It is only prescribed in amounts between 4 and 10grams, so as not to poison the patients. Li's Compendium has 18 recipes that call for the bark. Asian and European chemists have found some justification for its medical use as it contains a long list of active chemicals that include quassin and <b>saponin,</b> while ailanthone, the allelopathic chemical in the tree of heaven, is a known antimalarial agent.

40|$|Covering: up to September 2012. <b>Saponins</b> are an {{important}} class of plant natural products that consist of a triterpenoid or steroidal skeleton that is glycosylated by varying numbers of sugar units attached at different positions. Steroidal <b>saponins</b> are usually divided into two broad structural classes, namely spirostanol and furostanol <b>saponins.</b> A third, previously unrecognized structural class of plant <b>saponins,</b> the open-chain steroidal <b>saponins,</b> is introduced in this review; these possess an acyclic sidechain {{in place of the}} heterocyclic ring/s present in spirostanols and furostanols. Open-chain steroidal <b>saponins</b> are numerous and structurally diverse, with over 150 unique representatives reported from terrestrial plants. Despite this, they have to date been largely overlooked in reviews of plant natural products. This review catalogs the structural diversity of open-chain steroidal <b>saponins</b> isolated from terrestrial plants and discusses aspects of their structure elucidation, biological activities, biosynthesis, and distribution in the plant kingdom. It is intended that this review will provide a point of reference for those working with open-chain steroidal <b>saponins</b> and result in their recognition and inclusion in future reviews of plant <b>saponins...</b>|$|R
