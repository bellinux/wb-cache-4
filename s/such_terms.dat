The Board is entitled to appoint employees and officers on <b>such</b> <b>terms</b> as to remuneration or otherwise as it may determine, and to engage other persons and pay for their services as it considers necessary for carrying out its functions and duties.|$|E
5|$|If a {{mandatory}} order, prohibiting order or quashing order is sought, the applicant must follow the procedure {{set out in}} Order 53 of the Rules of Court. In general, there are two stages. At the first stage, an applicant must obtain leave {{to apply for the}} prerogative order. This requirement prevents unmeritorious applications from being taken against decision-makers by filtering out groundless cases at an early stage to prevent wastage of judicial time, and protects public bodies from harassment, intentional or otherwise. An application for such leave must be made by ex parte originating summons and must be supported by a statement setting out the name and description of the applicant, the relief sought and the grounds on which it is sought; and by an affidavit, to be filed when the application is made, verifying the facts relied on. In granting leave, the judge hearing the application for leave may impose <b>such</b> <b>terms</b> as to costs and as to security as he or she thinks fit.|$|E
5|$|Sentiments {{changed with}} the XYZ Affair. Adams {{appointed}} a three-member commission to represent the United States to negotiate with France. The commission consisted of John Marshall, Charles Cotesworth Pinckney and Elbridge Gerry. However, when the envoys arrived in October 1797, they were kept waiting for several days, and then granted only a 15-minute meeting with French Foreign Minister Talleyrand. After this, the diplomats were met by three of Talleyrand's agents. Each refused to conduct diplomatic negotiations unless the United States paid enormous bribes, one to Talleyrand personally, and another to the Republic of France. Supposedly this was {{to make up for}} offenses given to France by Adams in his speech. The Americans refused to negotiate on <b>such</b> <b>terms.</b> Marshall and Pinckney returned home, while Gerry remained.|$|E

5|$|Once leave is granted, an {{applicant}} {{moves on to}} the second stage and applies for a prerogative order by filing in the High Court a document called a summons within the legal proceedings already started earlier. This must be done between eight and 14 days after leave {{to do so is}} granted by the Court; beyond that, the leave lapses. The applicant must serve the ex parte originating summons, the statement, the supporting affidavit, the order granting leave, and the summons by which the prerogative order is actually applied for, on all persons directly affected. Where the application relates to court proceedings and is intended to compel the court or a court official to do an act relating to the proceedings, or to quash the proceedings or any order made in them, the documents must be served on the registrar of the court and the other parties to the proceedings. The documents must also be served on the judge if his or her conduct is being objected to. If the Court is of opinion that any person who ought to have been served with the documents has not been served, the Court may adjourn the hearing on <b>such</b> <b>terms</b> as it may direct in order that the documents may be served on that person.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Albulena was {{significant}} for the southern resistance against the Ottoman Empire. Franz Babinger, a historian of the Ottoman Empire, describes the battle as Skanderbeg's most brilliant victory. The battle of Albulena strengthened the morale of Skanderbeg's men who afterwards rarely, if at all, deserted his army as Hamza had. Hamza himself was sent as a prisoner to Naples in Alfonso's realm after being captured. An Ottoman envoy was sent to ransom the standard bearers and forty of the distinguished prisoners. The envoy also tried {{to settle for a}} truce between Mehmed and Skanderbeg, but the latter responded that he would only accept if Svetigrad and Berat, which had been lost in 1448 and 1450 respectively, were restored to his state. Seeing that Mehmed would not accept <b>such</b> <b>terms,</b> Skanderbeg strengthened his garrisons in the area around Svetigrad. The victory still bought Albania and Italy time; in 1460, Mehmed and Skanderbeg signed an armistice that lasted three years. This gave Skanderbeg the opportunity to land in Italy and help out Alfonso's son, Ferdinand I of Naples, who had been crowned after his father had died. The battle thus opened a new phase in the Ottoman-Albanian war which saw the high-water mark of the Albanian resistance and the fiercest Ottoman invasions of Albania in the war. The war would last until the fall of Krujë in 1478.|$|E

25|$|Imitation rubies {{are also}} marketed. Red spinels, red garnets, and colored glass have been falsely {{claimed to be}} rubies. Imitations go back to Roman times and already in the 17th century {{techniques}} were developed to color foil red—by burning scarlet wool in the bottom part of the furnace—which was then placed under the imitation stone. Trade terms such as balas ruby for red spinel and rubellite for red tourmaline can mislead unsuspecting buyers. <b>Such</b> <b>terms</b> are therefore discouraged from use by many gemological associations such as the Laboratory Manual Harmonisation Committee (LMHC).|$|E
25|$|Parliament {{revised and}} {{expanded}} the Militia Ordinance, {{replacing it with}} the Militia Act 1858. Some of the main changes were clauses enabling volunteers to be included under <b>such</b> <b>terms</b> and conditions as the Governor may specify. The act also outlined the purposes under which Militia could be called upon, including invasion. Debates in Parliament had included expressions of concern about Russian naval expansion in the northern Pacific, {{pointed out that the}} sole naval defence consisted of one 24-gun frigate, and the time it would take for Britain to come to the colony's aid.|$|E

25|$|Anti-clericalism, and {{attempting}} to divide religions by pitting laity against their hierarchy was still encouraged. Most of the clergy arrested and imprisoned in the 1920s and onwards never had trials.

As {{there is no room}} for a middle between the comparative adjectives, they were later modified to early and late. The scheme created a problem for further bipartite subdivisions, which would have resulted in <b>such</b> <b>terms</b> as early early stone age, but that terminology was avoided by adoption of Geikie's upper and lower Paleolithic.|$|E
25|$|LNG is shipped {{around the}} world in {{specially}} constructed seagoing vessels. The trade of LNG is completed by signing an SPA (sale and purchase agreement) between a supplier and receiving terminal, and by signing a GSA (gas sale agreement) between a receiving terminal and end-users. Most of the contract terms used to be DES or ex ship, holding the seller responsible for the transport of the gas. With low shipbuilding costs, and the buyers preferring to ensure reliable and stable supply, however, contracts with FOB terms increased. Under <b>such</b> <b>terms</b> the buyer, who often owns a vessel or signs a long-term charter agreement with independent carriers, is responsible for the transport.|$|E
