40|$|Three {{hypotheses}} {{have been}} offered to explain the historical specialty selection by women physicians. They are: (1) women choose the specialty for which the training requirements and working conditions interfere least with their commitments to marriage and children; (2) women tend to select the more 2 ̆ 2 feminine 2 ̆ 2 specialties such as pediatrics and psychiatry, and to avoid the 2 ̆ 2 masculine 2 ̆ 2 fields such as surgery; and (3) women have been deliberately excluded from male-dominated fields such as surgery. While the above hypotheses may be true {{to a greater or}} lesser degree, none of them has been adequately tested. ^ The major study hypotheses are as follows: (1) <b>female</b> physicians <b>2</b> ̆ 7 choice of specialty is influenced by the following reasons: (a) family responsibilities; (b) sex role expectations; and (c) <b>sex</b> discrimination; (<b>2)</b> <b>female</b> physicians <b>2</b> ̆ 7 choice of specialty is also influenced by their age and ethnicity; and (3) the primary reasons for choosing a given specialty vary by type of specialty. ^ The reasons for specialty selection will be explored based on a survey of women graduates of one of the oldest medical schools in the United States, The University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB) in Galveston, Texas (n = 930).

To find the prevalence of cardiac dysrhythmias in different sexes and ages, the horses were divided into <b>2</b> <b>sexes</b> (63 <b>females</b> and 42 males) and three age groups (0 - 4, 4 - 8, > 8 years old). After taking the history and performing clinical examination, ECG was obtained on a base apex lead system with the paper speed of 25 mm sec 1 and sensitivity of 10 or 5 mm mv 1 at rest. The electrocardiograms were evaluated according to the criteria of normal cardiac rate and rhythm. Analysis variance, tuckey test, independent samples t-test and chi-square were used for Statistical analysis. The results showed that, 36. 2 % of the horses were affected with some types of dysrhythmias. The most frequent dysrhythmias were sinus tachycardia, sinus arrhythmia and heart blocks respectively. After exercise, many cardiac dysrhythmias were disappeared (physiologic dysrhythmias). Although the prevalence of cardiac dysrhythmias in mares and 4 to 8 years old horses were more than stallions and other age groups, respectively, but the differences were not significant (p> 0. 05). There were {{significant differences between the}} heart rate of <b>2</b> <b>sexes</b> and one age group (less than 1. 5 years old) with other groups (p< 0. 05) ...|$|R

40|$|Background: Age at onset modifies {{prognosis}} in multiple sclerosis (MS) {{and may also}} exert {{an effect on the}} characteristics of disease ignition. Understanding how age influences presentation informs disease management and may allow differentiation of distinct clinical sub-groups. Objectives: To determine the nature of age-specific presentations of relapsing–remitting MS (RRMS) with respect to onset symptoms, gender ratios and index event outcomes. Methods: In a prospective, population-based sample of 1424 patients in South-East Wales we examined associations between age at onset, clinical features and outcome of the onset event, making specific comparisons between paediatric, adolescent and late-onset MS. Results: Age at onset varied significantly between <b>sexes</b> (Male 31. <b>2,</b> <b>Female</b> 29. 3, p = 0. 002), 0. 7 % had paediatric onset, 2. 7 % adolescent onset and 2. 8 % late-onset MS (> 50 years). Optic neuritis was common in younger patients and declined after age 30. Lower limb motor, facial sensory, sexual and sphincteric symptoms rose with age independent of sex and disease course. F:M ratios were highest < 16 years of age and declined with increasing age, with a male excess in those over 50. Probability of complete recovery from index event declined with age from 87. 4 % in the youngest group to 68 % in the eldest (p = 0. 009). Conclusions: Age at disease onset in RRMS exerts a significant effect on gender ratios and presenting phenotype, and allows identification of specific clinical sub-groups. In addition, ability to recover from initial relapse declines with age, suggesting accumulation of disability in MS is an age-dependent response to relapse...|$|R
