40|$|Effective entomological <b>surveillance</b> <b>planning</b> {{stresses}} {{a careful}} consideration of methodology, trapping technologies, and analysis techniques. Herein, {{the basic principles}} and technological components of arthropod <b>surveillance</b> <b>plans</b> are described, as promoted in the symposium "Advancements in arthropod monitoring technology, techniques, and analysis" presented at the 58 th {{annual meeting of the}} Entomological Society of America in San Diego, CA. Interdisciplinary examples of arthropod monitoring for urban, medical, and veterinary applications are reviewed. Arthropod surveillance consists of the three components: 1) sampling method, 2) trap technology, and 3) analysis technique. A sampling method consists of selecting the best device or collection technique for a specific location and sampling at the proper spatial distribution, optimal duration, and frequency to achieve the surveillance objective. Optimized sampling methods are discussed for several mosquito species (Diptera: Culicidae) and ticks (Acari: Ixodidae). The advantages and limitations of novel terrestrial and aerial insect traps, artificial pheromones and kairomones are presented for the capture of red flour beetle (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae), small hive beetle (Coleoptera: Nitidulidae), bed bugs (Hemiptera: Cimicidae), and Culicoides (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae) respectively. After sampling, extrapolating real world population numbers from trap capture data are possible with the appropriate analysis techniques. Examples of this extrapolation and action thresholds are given for termites (Isoptera: Rhinotermitidae) and red flour beetles.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was three-fold: (a) to present a <b>surveillance</b> <b>plan</b> for {{colorectal}} cancer prevention with colonoscopy, focused on first-degree relatives of colorectal cancer patients in the province of Ferrara (Italy); (b) to analyse the cost of colonoscopy at the University Hospital of Ferrara; and (c) to analyse the cost of the <b>surveillance</b> <b>plan</b> in our province. In January 2000, in the province of Ferrara, following a campaign of public sensitization, a plan of surveillance with colonoscopy was started, addressing the population at an increased risk for colorectal cancer (i. e. over 45 -year-old first-degree relatives of patients with either colorectal cancer or adenomatous polyps revealed before 60 years of age). In addition, we estimated the cost of colonoscopy both at the University Hospital of Ferrara and of the <b>surveillance</b> <b>plan.</b> Between January 2000 and October 2003, 585 individuals at increased risk were interviewed. Five hundred and forty-four (94 %) accepted to undergo a colonoscopy. By October 2003, 439 (81 %) colonoscopies had been performed. Colonoscopy was normal in 330 individuals (75 %). In 109 individuals (25 %), 144 lesions were found: 35 patients (32 %) had hyperplastic polyps, 66 (61 %) had adenomas, and eight (7 %) adenocarcinomas (six Dukes A, one Dukes B, and one Dukes C stage). Out of a total of 101 adenomas, 68 were tubular adenomas (67 %), 24 tubulo-villous adenomas (24 %), and nine adenomas with high-grade dysplasia (9 %). The cost of colonoscopy at our hospital and the costs of the <b>surveillance</b> <b>plan</b> amounted to euro 130. 84 (euro 169. 57 with single biopsy) and euro 43, 103. 66 (euro 42 310. 34 /year), respectively. These data show (a) the efficacy of colonoscopy in the early diagnosis of colorectal cancer and premalignant lesions in first-degree relatives of colorectal cancer patients; (b) the low cost of colonoscopy at the centre performing the surveillance; and (c) the feasibility of screening and surveillance programmes for colorectal cancer prevention...|$|E

40|$|Over {{the past}} decades, many {{technological}} advances have unlocked new opportunities to boost efficiency {{in the oil}} and gas industry (e. g., complex well drilling, injection of advanced chemicals, sophisticated instrumentation). The real engineering challenge is to apply these technologies in the best possible way for each particular case. This leads to very difficult decisions to be made, mainly because every oil and gas field is one of its kind and our knowledge of the subsurface is very limited. Many efforts have been made to develop tools to support these decisions by applying a more systematic approach to determine smart exploitation strategies. Yet, very little has been done on the optimization of reservoir <b>surveillance</b> <b>plans</b> to establish the best observations to monitor de field response to the exploitation strategies, which, in turn, can also contribute to a better exploitation of the reservoir. In this thesis we propose a methodology to assess the value of future measurements as a first step towards the development of a framework to optimize the design of reservoir <b>surveillance</b> <b>plans.</b> We also investigate alternatives to improve current reservoir management approaches by recommending actions which anticipate the availability of future information and account for the impact of immediate decisions on the decisions to be made in the future. Throughout the chapters, we discuss how to combine a variety of topics (e. g., model-based optimization, data assimilation, uncertainty quantification) with other unusual ingredients (e. g., plausible truths, clairvoyance, flexible plans) to develop a methodology which can be applied in many problems involving decision making and learning. Despite being motivated by a real application, this research addresses abstract concepts such as value and information, but always from an engineering perspective. This makes us approach the problem in a different way, which, we hope, will inspire innovative solutions in the future. Petroleum Engineerin...|$|R

40|$|An {{intelligent}} <b>surveillance</b> <b>planning</b> {{system must}} allocate available resources to optimize data collection {{with respect to}} a variety of operational requirements. In addition, these requirements often vary temporally (i. e., targets of interest move, priorities change, etc.), requiring dynamic reoptimization onthe -fly. Allocation of surveillance resources has typically been accomplished either by human planners, (for small problems of very limited complexity) or by deterministic methods (typically producing suboptimal solutions which are incapable of adapting to dynamic changes in the environment). The method presented here solves these problems by using evolutionary programming to optimize the simultaneous and coordinated scheduling of multiple surveillance assets. The problem of allocating unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to acquire temporally variable, time-differential intelligence data is addressed.
