50|$|In the {{milkweed}} and <b>spurge</b> <b>families,</b> on {{the other}} hand, the laticiferous system is formed quite differently. Early {{in the development of}} the seedling latex cells differentiate, and as the plant grows these latex cells grow into a branching system extending throughout the plant. In many euphorbs, the entire structure is made from a single cell - this type of system is known as a non-articulated laticifer, to distinguish it from the multi-cellular structures discussed above. In the mature plant, the entire laticiferous system is descended from a single cell or group of cells present in the embryo.|$|R
