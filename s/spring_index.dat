Regular starch foams had significantly lower water solubility index than did the waxy starch foams. PLA-starch foams had the lowest compressibility and Young 2 ̆ 7 s modulus. MBI-starch foams were the most rigid. All foams had excellent spring indices and bulk spring indices which were comparable to the <b>spring</b> <b>index</b> of commercial expanded polystyrene foam. ^ Correlations were established between the foam mechanical properties and the physical characteristics.

No correlation was observed between <b>spring</b> <b>index</b> and bulk <b>spring</b> <b>index</b> and foam physical characteristics. ^ MBI-starch foams had the highest equilibrium moisture content. EBC-starch and PLA-starch foams had similar water absorption characteristics. No significant difference existed in water absorption characteristics between foams made of regular and waxy starches.

This study investigated oceanographic drivers of winter habitat choice and regional differences between populations of juvenile and adult black sea bass. Trends in cohort strength, as a result of juvenile survival, were also identified. Oceanographic and fisheries survey data were analyzed using generalized additive models. Among the oceanographic variables investigated, salinity was the main driver in habitat selection with an optimal range of 33 - 35 practical salinity units (PSU) for both juveniles and adults. Preferred temperature ranges varied between juveniles and adults, but held a similar minimum preference of > 8 °C. Salinity and temperature ranges also differed by regions north and south of Hudson Canyon. Shelf water volume had less of an effect than temperature or salinity, but showed an overall negative relationship with survey catch. The effect of winter conditions on juvenile abundance was also observed across state and federal survey index trends.

40|$|Abstract-Carbon dioxide (CO 2) {{exchange}} between {{the atmosphere and}} the Wadden Sea, a shallow coastal region along the northern Netherlands, has been measured from April 2006 onwards on a tidal flat and over open water. Tidal flat measurements were done using a flux chamber, and ship borne measurements using an equilibrator to determine the partial pressure of CO 2 in the water. A strong response of CO 2 exchange rate on irradiance changes was observed at the tidal flat surface, with generally strong uptake of CO 2 during daylight conditions and release, presumably due to respiration, during dark conditions. The rate of respiration appeared to increase with temperature. Daytime CO 2 uptake tended {{to be higher than}} nighttime release all year round. Apparently, tidal flats in temperate regions of the globe may be a sink for CO 2 on an annual basis. In contrast to terrestrial CO 2 exchange, uptake by processes active on and in tidal flats responds only slowly to changing irradiance. This slow reaction is attributed to CO 2 storage in wet soil. Measurements in the water between tidal flats suggest that the estuarine, open water part of the Wadden Sea is a source of CO 2 in <b>spring.</b> <b>Index</b> Terms-Carbon dioxide, Flux chamber, Tidal flat.

The temporal dynamics of these phenological patterns indicate that {{the first years of the}} study period tend to have late spring onsets and the recent years have early spring onsets. Our results also show that the study period exhibits 12 main temporal phenological patterns of spring onset. The spatial distributions of these temporal phenological patterns show that western Turkey tends to have the most variable spring onsets. Changes in the boundaries of other phenoregions can also be observed. These results indicate that this co-clustering based analytical workflow effectively enables the simultaneous study of both spatial patterns and their temporal dynamics and of temporal patterns and their spatial dynamics in spring phenology...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This {{paper is}} focused on {{developing}} fatigue-load model for highway bridges based on the measurements data of WIM (Weigh-in-Motion) in China. In this paper, based on the analysis of vehicle flow data collected from six toll stations on Jing-Fu Highway {{which is one of}} the busiest highways in China, <b>spring</b> festival <b>index</b> and month index of vehicle flow are obtained. The finite element models are established, and the vehicle flows are modelled by using Monte Carlo method as dynamic load applied on the nodes of the models. This paper presents a fatigue truck model for Jing-Fu Highway bridges, which may also be used for other highway bridges in China. In order to validate the model, strain time histories were obtained through field strain measurements for 3 existing bridges on this highway. In addition, comparison among the model introduced in this paper and the models in foreign codes as well as the models developed by other researchers is presented...|$|R

(Aeronutronic had been hired to do a system analysis of the control center on 1 October 1959. Detailed reports of this and other Aeronutronic support of Project Space Track are on file at the offices of Lockheed Martin (formerly Loral Corporation) in Colorado <b>Springs,</b> Colorado.

40|$|To {{study the}} Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) volume {{transport}} several cruises have taken place. The {{results of these}} cruises show snapshots without information about the time variability. To investigate the time variability of the ACC the Alfred Wegener Institute operates an array of Pressure Inverted Echo Sounders (PIES) along a satellite altimeter ground track south of Africa. PIES monitor ocean bottom pressure and acoustic travel time across the water column. A Gravest Empirical Mode (GEM, Meinen and Watts 1998) was applied to determine the geostrophic transport between the PIES. These time series were used to compute a transfer function between satellite Sderived transport and geostrophic transport. Satellite altimetry offers the possibility to calculate ACC transport between 1992 and 2010. A mean transport of 115 Sv and a variability of 7 Sv were derived for the Topex/Poseidon, Jason 1 and Jason 2 time period. A wavelet analysis shows that the ACC transport highly correlates with the winter and <b>spring</b> SAM <b>index,</b> whereas a direct correlation on a monthly scale could not be shown. ...|$|R
