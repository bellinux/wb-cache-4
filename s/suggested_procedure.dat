50|$|The {{following}} three families of cyanophages {{have been recognized}} by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV): Myoviridae, Siphoviridae and Podoviridae; all contain double-stranded DNA. Initially, cyanophages were named after their hosts. However, the ability of cyanophages to infect multiple hosts and lack of a universal naming system can cause difficulties with their taxonomic classification. Many other classification systems used serological, morphological, or physiological properties. Currently, the <b>suggested</b> <b>procedure</b> of naming strains is as follows: Cyanophage Xx-YYZaa, where Xx is the first two letters of the genus and species names of the host that the type specimen phage is found in, YY is {{the origin of the}} specimen, Z is the virus family, and aa is the reference number of the virus.|$|E
40|$|In {{discriminant}} analysis involving continuous and categorical variables, {{the simplest and}} conventional procedure is to assign an arbitrary numerical score to each possible state of the categorical variables and proceed as if all variables are continuous. A discrimination procedure is suggested {{for use in a}} situation where the discriminating variables are mixtures of more than one Continuous variable and one Dichotomous variable. The performance of the <b>suggested</b> <b>procedure</b> is compared alongside that of the conventional Fisher’s Linear Discriminant and Logistic Discrimination procedures based on their error rates.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we examine {{aggregate}} network traffic for deviation detection. The precise and fast detection of network traffic deviation {{is crucial to}} improve the efficient operation of a network. It {{is often difficult to}} detect the time when the defects occur in a network. In this article, a new algorithm is bestowed to supervise the aggregate network traffic to fast detect the time deviation transpires in a network. This is performed by supervising the statistical attributes of the time series depicting the network conduct. The procedure examines the network conduct using fractal dimension and discrete stationary wavelet transform. In the <b>suggested</b> <b>procedure,</b> after implementing discrete stationary wavelet transform on the signal depicting the network traffic, the fractal dimension of the disintegrated signal is computed in a sliding window. Then, variations of signal fractal dimension are regarded for deviation detection. Performance of the <b>suggested</b> <b>procedure</b> is compared with that of three other existent procedures using artificial substance signal. The results show superiority of the <b>suggested</b> <b>procedure</b> in terms of preciseness compared to existent procedures...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{coefficient}} of the acoustic absorption {{of the materials}} can be determined using two standard methods: the standing wave method and the reverberation room method. In this paper, starting {{from the fact that}} the sound intensity as vector quantity describes, beside the amount of the sound energy its direction as well and that intensity vector distribution on the floor of the rectangular rooms is rather uniform, a procedure of the absorption characteristics determination of the absorber specimen by measuring of the sound intensity is suggested. The comparative results of the absorption coefficient determination of the glass wool, obtained by reverberation room method and <b>suggested</b> <b>procedure,</b> are given. The first results point out to the possibility of the absorbed energy determination in the rectangular parallelepiped rooms, using <b>suggested</b> <b>procedure</b> on the basis of the sound intensity measurement. 1...|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} geoelectrical problem of picking out the useful signal from voltage time series, {{monitored}} {{under conditions of}} a low signal-to-noise ratio and non-stationary noise. Statistical tests performed at different sites show that geoelectrical noise often belongs to the class of non-stationary phenomena with non-Gaussian probability distributions. In such cases, the application of conventional methods of geoelectrical useful signal extraction, based on the stationary white-noise assumption, gives biased estimates. For the on-line processing of geoelectrical recordings, we recommend {{the use of the}} periodogram technique combined with the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test, a suitable algorithm of which is described in detail. The <b>suggested</b> <b>procedure</b> allows data acquisition to stop as soon as the useful signal power is estimated with a relative error smaller than a predetermined value. Finally, we compare the <b>suggested</b> <b>procedure</b> with the autoregressive approach. The previously used and simpler periodogram method, applied to the solution of problems of this kind, appears to give better performances than the autoregressive analysis...|$|E

40|$|Replicability {{analysis}} aims {{to identify}} the findings that replicated across independent studies that examine the same features. We provide powerful novel replicability analysis procedures for two studies for FWER and for FDR control on the replicability claims. The <b>suggested</b> <b>procedures</b> first select the promising features from each study solely based on that study, and then test for replicability only the features that were selected in both studies. We incorporate the plug-in estimates of the fraction of null hypotheses in one study among the selected hypotheses by the other study. Since the fraction of nulls in one study among the selected features from the other study is typically small, the power gain can be remarkable. We provide theoretical guarantees for {{the control of the}} appropriate error rates, as well as simulations that demonstrate the excellent power properties of the <b>suggested</b> <b>procedures.</b> We demonstrate the usefulness of our procedures on real data examples from two application fields: behavioural genetics and microarray studies...|$|R
