40|$|AbstractThe {{performance}} of five different <b>smoke</b> extraction modes for an underground channel fire was numerically investigated originally in this paper. Results {{have shown that}} mechanical air supplying from adjacent <b>smoke</b> bays will intensify the air entrainment and increase the <b>smoke</b> production, which lead to a reduction of <b>smoke</b> temperature and buoyancy so that it's easier for <b>smoke</b> to descend to the lower level of the building space. The <b>smoke</b> exhausting process is not effective while using the <b>smoke</b> vents remote to the fire region as the fresh air is strongly sucked into the vents instead of <b>smoke.</b> Compared with the commonly used <b>smoke</b> extraction mode with all the <b>smoke</b> bays together, exhausting the fire-induced <b>smoke</b> with relatively high velocity by using the vents inside of or close to the fire is able to achieve a more effective <b>smoke</b> exhausting process. The most effective <b>smoke</b> extraction mode has also been validated by simulating a platform fire scenario in a full-scale subway station...|$|R

Velocity of <b>smoke</b> venting has shown to decrease as the operating pressure increases. <b>Smoke</b> venting logging, which represents the failure of <b>smoke</b> venting, was experimentally found from certain operating pressure called initial logging pressure. The CO concentration was found to increase after sprinkler was operated as the <b>smoke</b> is constrained in the spray region with horizontal momentum decreased.

5|$|Clam dip is {{typically}} prepared using chopped or minced clams, sour cream or cream cheese, and various seasonings, and usually served chilled. It {{is used as}} a dip for potato chips, bread, crackers, and crudités. It has a creamy texture and mouthfeel.

Canned clams can be drained, or the liquid can be retained and used as an ingredient. After refrigeration, the dip may thicken, and the liquid from canned clams can be used to thin the dip. Milk or cream is also sometimes used to thin clam dip. When refrigerated overnight, the flavors of the ingredients intermingle more greatly, resulting in a more flavorful dip. <b>Smoked</b> clams are sometimes used, which imbues a distinct smoky flavor to the dip.
