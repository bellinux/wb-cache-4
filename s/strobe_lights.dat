5|$|Butthole Surfers {{began to}} take the {{collection}} of visual equipment seriously following Coffey's recruitment in 1983, when he added a clear plastic drum fitted with a strobe light to their show. Shortly afterwards, the band purchased what was reported as several thousand dollars worth of stolen <b>strobe</b> <b>lights</b> at a bargain rate, and their visual equipment soon took up more space than their instruments. Smoke machines were later added. Equally memorable was the band's propensity for projecting a variety of films behind them as they played, beginning with one 16-millimeter projector, before adding others. This set-up allowed them to play a number of overlapping movies {{at the same time}} which were often strangely angled, upside down or played in reverse. Combined with the increasing number of <b>strobe</b> <b>lights,</b> the effect created a visually disorienting atmosphere, which occasionally caused epileptic seizures in audience members.|$|E
5|$|IMAX {{screenings}} {{began on}} April 25, 2013 internationally and May 3 in the United States. The film {{was shown in}} the 4DX format, featuring <b>strobe</b> <b>lights,</b> tilting seats, blowing wind and fog and odor effects in selected countries. In Japan, the technology opened its first room at the Korona World theatre in Nagoya, Japan {{with the release of}} the film.|$|E
5|$|The {{video of}} the {{performance}} was recorded using six cameras. At brief times during the performance, the video recorded a moment of white on camera or a dark screen, {{both of which were}} related to the use of <b>strobe</b> <b>lights.</b> An individual dressed in costume as Friday the 13th character Jason Voorhees made an appearance on-stage at one point during the performance.|$|E

50|$|For example, a {{tachometer}} may use a <b>strobe</b> <b>light</b> with {{an adjustable}} PRF to measure rotational velocity. The PRF for the <b>strobe</b> <b>light</b> is adjusted upward {{from a low}} value until the rotating object appears to stand still. The PRF of the tachometer would then match {{the speed of the}} rotating object.|$|R
5|$|By {{the time}} Lynch left in 1989, Butthole Surfers' stage show {{had become more}} predictable, with {{previously}} random shockers being done {{at the same point}} in each night's performance. Teresa Nervosa quit for good around the same time, and King Coffey became the band's sole percussionist. <b>Strobe</b> <b>lights,</b> smoke machines, and even Gibby Haynes' burning cymbal are still part of the presentation, but the chaotic spontaneity of their 1980s performances is no longer on display.|$|E
5|$|On January 6, 2010, Disney {{announced}} that the film would be released in the United States and Canada on May 20, 2011, following Columbia Pictures' announcement of a delay in the Spider-Man reboot and Paramount Pictures slating Thor for May 6, 2011. The film was released in IMAX 3D, as well as traditional 2D and IMAX format, with Dolby 7.1 surround sound. This film {{was also the first}} film to be released in the 4DX motion theaters in Mexico and in the Western Hemisphere, featuring <b>strobe</b> <b>lights,</b> tilting seats, blowing wind and fog and odor effects. It is available exclusively at select Cinépolis cinemas.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} {{technologies}} in use {{to achieve the}} flashing effect. These include flashing a light bulb or LED, flashing or rotating halogen, and <b>strobe</b> <b>lights,</b> which are usually brighter than incandescent lights. Each of these can be programmed to flash singly or in groups, and can be programmed to flash in patterns (such as a left -> right pattern for use when the ambulance is parked on the left hand side of the road, indicating to other road users that they should move to the right (away from the ambulance)). Incandescent and LED lights may also be programmed to burn steadily, without flashing, which is required in some provinces.|$|E

5|$|The {{stage and}} {{associated}} props took twenty-four semi-trailer trucks to transport. The setup {{consisted of a}} main stage with three elevators and a turntable (which rose and lowered), a central runway with LED and <b>strobe</b> <b>lights</b> connected to a central stage with a LED view screen in the construction and an elevator. The two secondary runways were raised up into the stands and also had view screens inside the construction. Two projection screens were raised above the audience so those who couldn't get {{a clear view of}} the stage could still see the performance. There were also 3 LED screens that moved around during the performance, including one semicircular transparent screen lowered onto the stage during the video interludes.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} mainly shot on Kodak Vision3 250D film stock. Scenes where Oscar is alive were {{shot in the}} super 35 format with Arricam LT cameras, and the rest in super 16 with an Aaton XTR Prod. The cinematographer was Benoît Debie, who also shot Irréversible. As in Irréversible, Noé was {{reluctant}} to use artificial lighting that would destroy the illusion if the camera was turned around. Thanks to Tokyo's many neon signs, very little additional lighting was required for the exterior scenes, {{despite the fact that}} many were shot late at night. For the interior scenes Debie mainly used practical, in-frame light sources. Some exceptions were made. One was that the moods of the characters were meant to be indicated by different colours, ranging from orange to purple with occasional greens. For this, Debie used a set of red, green, and blue programmable disco lights, which allowed for all different hues. The disco lights were easy to hide. They were also used for simulation of neon flashes, and to add a tint of red to the dressing-room scenes. Another exception was the use of <b>strobe</b> <b>lights,</b> which were programmed together with the coloured lights. Blue colour was avoided throughout, since the filmmakers did not associate it with dreams. Noé was the film's camera operator, except for a few shots of Oscar running in the streets, as they required a taller cameraman. In those scenes, the camera was held by Debie.|$|E

50|$|Doppler systems involve {{velocity}} measurements {{similar to}} the kind of measurements made using a <b>strobe</b> <b>light.</b>|$|R
50|$|For example, a <b>strobe</b> <b>light</b> {{can be used}} as a {{tachometer}} {{to measure}} rotational velocity for rotating machinery. <b>Strobe</b> <b>light</b> measurements can be inaccurate because the light may be flashing 2 or 3 times faster than shaft rotation speed. The user can only produce an accurate measurement by increasing the pulse rate starting near zero until pulses are fast enough to make the rotating object appear stationary.|$|R
25|$|Most <b>strobe</b> <b>lights</b> on sale to {{the public}} are factory-limited to about 10–12Hz (10–12 flashes per second) in their {{internal}} oscillators, although externally triggered <b>strobe</b> <b>lights</b> will often flash as frequently as possible. Studies {{have shown that the}} majority of people that are susceptible to the strobing effects can have symptoms at 15Hz-70Hz, albeit rare. Other studies have shown epileptic symptoms at the 15Hz rate with over 90 seconds of continuous staring at a strobe light. There have been no known seizures at or below the 8Hz (or 8 flashes per second) level. Many fire alarms in schools, hospitals, stadiums, etc. strobe at a 1Hz rate.|$|E

25|$|LED {{lights are}} often used in a mode similar to {{conventional}} <b>strobe</b> <b>lights,</b> however they can be programmed with {{a wider variety of}} flash patterns because of their ability to be switched directly by electronics, as opposed to discharging a capacitor through a gas-filled tube.|$|E

25|$|A typical {{commercial}} {{strobe light}} has a flash {{energy in the}} region of 10 to 150 joules, and discharge times as short as a few milliseconds, often resulting in a flash power of several kilowatts. Larger <b>strobe</b> <b>lights</b> can be used in “continuous” mode, producing extremely intense illumination.|$|E
25|$|Iwai {{contributed to}} the {{construction}} of the Bouncing Totoro 3-dimensional zoetrope at the Ghibli Museum in Mitaka, Tokyo. He helped conceive an LED strobe device to be used in place of conventional <b>strobe</b> <b>lights,</b> softening the lighting as a result. He also made a layout plan for the positioning of the figures using a computer.|$|E
25|$|<b>Strobe</b> <b>lights</b> usually use flashtubes {{with energy}} {{supplied}} from a capacitor, an energy storage device {{much like a}} battery, but capable of charging and releasing energy much faster. Recently, some <b>strobe</b> <b>lights</b> {{have been found to}} use rectified mains electricity and no capacitors at all. In a capacitor-based strobe light, the capacitor is charged up to around 300 V. Once the capacitor has been charged, a small amount of power is diverted into a trigger transformer, a small transformer with a high turns ratio. This generates the weak but high voltage spike required to ionize the xenon gas in a flash tube. An arc is created inside the tube, which acts as a bridge for the much bigger pulse to flow down later. Arcs present almost a direct short circuit, allowing the capacitors to quickly release their energy into the arc. This rapidly heats the xenon gas, creating an extremely bright plasma discharge, which is seen as a flash.|$|E
