5|$|After Yogesh has met {{most of the}} girls, one of them, Sanjana (Priyanka Chopra), asks {{to talk to him}} privately. She <b>says</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> that a boy {{has agreed}} to marry her, but she is reluctant. She asks Yogesh to give her time {{to decide what to do}} about her boyfriend. He agrees, telling her about his {{problems}} with Jitu. Sanjana, touched that Yogesh will help her despite his own problems, hugs him. Devu walks in, and thinks he has interrupted them; Sanjana chases him, trying to explain. Tailing Devu, the detective is unaware that he had been with Anila at a hotel and sees him with Sanjana. Sanjana shows Devu a picture; when he says something supposedly demeaning, she becomes angry and tries to leave. Devu stops her, holding her while she cries before they leave in his car. The detective convinces Yogesh and his father that Devu is having an affair with Sanjana. Anila then comes downstairs, looking for Devu. Yogesh shows her the photos, telling her that Devu and Sanjana went to Khandala, a hill station near Mumbai. The detective tells Devu's wife this story, and they find Devu at a hotel with Sanjana. Devu thinks Yogesh betrayed him, and Yogesh thinks Devu is having an affair with Sanjana.|$|E
25|$|A highly fictionalized {{version of}} Balian {{is the main}} {{character}} of the 2005 film Kingdom of Heaven, played by Orlando Bloom {{as a young man}} with a questioning sensibility regarding religion and social attitudes. In the film, Balian's father, a fictional character named Godfrey the Baron of Ibelin (played by Liam Neeson), returns to Europe to find Balian, his long-lost illegitimate son, who is a blacksmith in France, and encourages him to come to the Holy Land as his heir. Balian is portrayed as having a love affair with Sibylla (this is possibly derived from the Old French Continuation of William of Tyres claims about her and Baldwin). The film depicts Balian as the sole commander of the defence of Jerusalem, and instead of working in close alliance with Patriarch Eraclius, Balian is depicted as his rival. In the film's coda, Balian returns to France (with Sibylla) where he meets Richard I of England, who rides up to Balian and <b>says</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> that he is looking for Balian, the defender of Jerusalem, to which Balian replies that he is a blacksmith. After some time passes Balian and Sibylla are seen to be riding up the crossroads his father had used when returning from Jerusalem.|$|E
500|$|Berger gives a joint to Claude that is {{laced with}} a hallucinogen. [...] Claude starts to trip as the tribe acts out his visions ("Walking in Space"). [...] He hallucinates {{that he is}} skydiving from a plane into the jungles of Vietnam. [...] Berger appears as General George Washington and is told to retreat because of an Indian attack. The Indians shoot all of Washington's men. [...] General Ulysses S. Grant appears and begins a roll call: Abraham Lincoln (played by a black female tribe member), John Wilkes Booth, Calvin Coolidge, Clark Gable, Scarlett O'Hara, Aretha Franklin, Colonel George Custer. [...] Claude Bukowski is called in the roll call, but Clark Gable says [...] "he couldn't make it". [...] They all dance a minuet until three African witch doctors kill them – all except for Abraham Lincoln who says, [...] "I'm one of you". [...] Lincoln, after the threeAfricans sing his praises, recites an {{alternate}} version of the Gettysburg Address ("Abie Baby").

500|$|The main {{theme of}} Xander's dream is {{his sense of}} failure and of being left behind as his friends move ahead in life. His fear that he is stuck is reiterated {{throughout}} his dream by his inability to escape his basement bedroom in his parents' home. No matter where his dream takes him, he ends up back in the basement. As {{the only one of}} the Scoobies not in college, he feels anxiety about his ability to understand and keep up with ideas and conversations, a fear which is realized when he goes to the university, a place he already feels excluded from, and finds that he cannot understand what people say to him. Aware that he is being chased and is in danger, he asks Giles what is happening but cannot understand his answer, nor what Anya <b>says</b> <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> as they are both inexplicably speaking French. He exclaims, [...] "I don't understand!" [...] During his dream both Buffy and Willow tell him, [...] "I'm way ahead of you," [...] and Giles tells him [...] "the others have gone on ahead," [...] underscoring his fear that this is really the case.|$|E
500|$|... "Pink Matter" [...] is a bluesy lament with {{themes of}} sex and betrayal, as its narrator struggles between {{pleasure}} and universal meaning. Its lyrics allude to philosophical conundrums, extraterrestrial life, Japanese manga comics, and cotton candy. The playful [...] "Forrest Gump" [...] likens the titular film character to an adolescent crush, with homoerotic, tongue-in-cheek lyrics, and allusions to scenes in the film. It has a bright, Motown-inspired chorus, a simple rhythmic cadence, gently strummed guitar, wistful vocals, and a perkily whistled coda. The skit [...] "End" [...] depicts an exchange between Ocean and a woman as they make love {{in the backseat of}} a car with his 2012 song [...] "Voodoo" [...] playing over the stereo. She <b>says</b> <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> [...] "You're special. I wish you could see what I see", repurposing a line from the 2006 film ATL, and Ocean leaves the car in response, walks home through the rain, and sets his keys down with a sigh. The lighthearted, lovelorn [...] "Golden Girl" [...] has up-tempo synths, gradual fades, and Tyler, The Creator rapping in a low-pitched, demonic voice. It is about a girl that provides salvation and peace of mind for the narrator, who likens her to an island.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{this might}} have just been dirty talk, a similar {{continuity}} error exists regarding the rank of Mack Gerhardt. In the season-one episode [...] "True Believers", his wife <b>says</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> [...] "come here sergeant major, {{and give me a}} report", but his rank is later established as master sergeant. In the final wedding scene of season four, however, Mack is shown with E-7, or sergeant first class, rank on his uniform.|$|E

2500|$|In Act 3, Scene 3, after Warwick {{has joined}} the Lancastrians, he vows to Margaret [...] "to force the tyrant from his seat by war" [...] (l.206), and {{promises}} [...] "I'll uncrown him ere't be long" [...] (l.232). He also muses to himself [...] "I was the chief that raised him to the crown,/And I'll be chief to bring him down again" [...] (ll.263–264). In Act 4, Scene 6, after Warwick has successfully deposed Edward, Henry <b>says</b> <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> [...] "Warwick, although my head still wear the crown,/I here resign my government to thee" [...] (l.24). Finally, upon meeting Richmond (the future Henry VII), Henry proclaims, [...] "His head by nature framed to wear a crown,/His hand to wield a sceptre, and himself/Likely in time to bless a regal throne" [...] (ll.72–74).|$|E
2500|$|In the Director's Cut, {{police officer}} Gaff (played by Edward James Olmos) leaves Deckard an origami unicorn {{the day after}} Deckard had dreamed of one. Just before Deckard finds the unicorn, Gaff <b>says</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> in passing (about Rachael), [...] "It's too bad she won't live... then again, who does?" [...] A unicorn {{can also be seen}} briefly in a scene in J. F. Sebastian's home, amongst {{scattered}} toys (to the right of Sebastian, who is asleep, while Pris snoops around his equipment). Furthermore, a unicorn appears in a dream of Deckard's in the Director's Cut. Finally, as explained in the film, Rachael's memories are known by her creators, such as the memory Rachael has of spiders hatching; that Gaff leaves an origami unicorn at Deckard's house may imply that he knows of Deckard’s implanted dream.|$|E
2500|$|And {{they come}} into Bethany. And a certain woman whose brother had died was there. And, coming, she prostrated herself before Jesus and <b>says</b> <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> [...] "Son of David, have mercy on me." [...] But the disciples rebuked her. And Jesus, being angered, went off with her into the garden where the tomb was, and {{straightway}} a great cry was heard from the tomb. And going near Jesus rolled away the stone from {{the door of the}} tomb. And straightway, going in where the youth was, he stretched forth his hand and raised him, seizing his hand. But the youth, looking upon him, loved him and began to beseech him that he might be with him. And going out of the tomb they came into the house of the youth, for he was rich. And after six days Jesus told him what to do and in the evening the youth comes to him, wearing a linen cloth over his naked body. And he remained with him that night, for Jesus taught him the mystery of the kingdom of God. And thence, arising, he returned {{to the other side of}} the Jordan.|$|E

2500|$|References to the Doctor's {{family are}} {{rare in the}} programme. During the first two seasons he {{travelled}} with his granddaughter, Susan Foreman, who has since been referred to occasionally and who returned in The Five Doctors. In [...] "Smith and Jones", he mentioned having a brother. During his second incarnation, {{when asked about his}} family, the Doctor says his memories of them are alive when he wants them to be and otherwise they sleep in his mind (The Tomb of the Cybermen). In The Curse of Fenric, when asked if he has family, the Seventh Doctor replies that he does not know. In the 1996 television movie, the Eighth Doctor remarks that he is half-human on his mother's side. Throughout the revival, the Doctor routinely attempts to change the topic when questioned about being a parent or his family life, as in [...] "Fear Her", [...] "The Beast Below" [...] and [...] "A Good Man Goes to War". In [...] "The Empty Child", Dr. Constantine <b>says</b> <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> [...] "Before this war began, I was a father and a grandfather. Now I'm neither. But I'm still a doctor." [...] The [...] Ninth Doctor's reply is, [...] "Yeah. I know the feeling." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{third time}} Enki succumbs to temptation, and {{attempts}} seduction of Uttu. Upset about Enki's reputation, Uttu consults Ninhursag, who, {{upset at the}} promiscuous wayward nature of her spouse, advises Uttu to avoid the riverbanks, the places likely {{to be affected by}} flooding, the home of Enki. In another version of this myth Ninhursag takes Enki's semen from Uttu's womb and plants it in the earth where eight plants rapidly germinate. With his two-faced servant and steward Isimud, [...] "Enki, in the swampland, in the swampland lies stretched out, 'What is this (plant), what is this (plant). His messenger Isimud, answers him; 'My king, this is the tree-plant', he <b>says</b> <b>to</b> <b>him.</b> He cuts it off for him and he (Enki) eats it". And so, despite warnings, Enki consumes the other seven fruit. Consuming his own semen, he falls pregnant (ill with swellings) in his jaw, his teeth, his mouth, his hip, his throat, his limbs, his side and his rib. The gods are at a loss to know what to do, chagrinned they [...] "sit in the dust". As Enki lacks a womb with which to give birth, he seems to be dying with swellings. The fox then asks Enlil King of the Gods, [...] "If I bring Ninhursag before thee, what shall be my reward?" [...] Ninhursag's sacred fox then fetches the goddess.|$|E
