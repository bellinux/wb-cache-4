The results showed that when the cue was 50 % valid in one experiment, the participants adopted a parallel self-terminating processing strategy, indic-ative of a diffuse attentional focus on both target locations. When the cue was 100 % valid in the second experiment, all of the participants switched to a serial self-terminating process-ing strategy, which in our study indicated focused attention to a single target location.

However, metamaterials offer the potential to limit radiation exchange to a proscribed range of angles and wavelengths, which has the potential to dramatically boost performance. After globally optimizing one particular class of such designs, we find thermal transfer efficiencies of 78 % at temperatures over 1, 000 &# 176;C, with overall system energy conversion efficiencies of 37 %, exceeding the Shockley-Quiesser efficiency limit of 31 % for photovoltaic conversion under unconcentrated sunlight.

Regulatory regions of genes that are preferentially expressed in tumors have been examined. The regions of the survivin gene exhibited the greatest activity in human hepatocellular carcinoma cells. Deletion of the survivin regulatory region from the 5 '-side demonstrated that the 0. 5 kb and the 1. 4 kb fragments possessed a strong promoter activity with relative tumor specificity. Human tumors transfected with the herpes simplex virus-thymidine kinase gene, that was powered by the survivin region, became susceptible to a prodrug, ganciclovir.

The spacing of these structures is 360 nm. The structural perfection of the deposited Ge is investigated by transmission electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction. It is found that SiO 2 used as masking material is responsible for the suppression of the desired strain partitioning effect according to NHE. Even for 10 nm oxide thickness, the lattice of Ge layers deposited on Si nano-islands relaxes completely by generation of misfit dislocations at the interface.

It is found that W film grows by preheating on the wet-cleaned substrate after an incubation period, which becomes shorter on the Si surface {{which has a}} lower hydrogen concentration. W nucleus formation before the film growth is also enhanced and the nuclei on the Si surface which has a lower hydrogen concentration are of a higher density and a smaller size. Even before the nucleus formation, the W atom is adsorbed and the adsorption rate on the Si surface which has a lower hydrogen concentration is higher than that which has a higher one. Consequently, hydrogen desorption from the Si surface enhances the W atom adsorption, and after adsorption of a certain concentration of W atoms, the W nucleus formation and growth start. 1...|$|R

The SPRM asoprisnil is being studied in women with symptomatic uterine leiomyomata and endometriosis. Asoprisnil shows a high degree of uterine selectivity as compared to effects on ovulation or ovarian hormone secretion in humans. It induces amenorrhea and decreases leiomyoma volume in a dose-dependent manner in the presence of follicular phase estrogen concentrations. It also has endometrial antiproliferative effects. In pregnant animals, the myometrial, i. e. labor-inducing, effects of asoprisnil are blunted or absent. Studies in non-human primates played a key role during the preclinical development of selective progesterone receptor modulators.
