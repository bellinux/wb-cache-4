40|$|PhD (Chemical Engineering), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2014 The world {{energy supply}} and demand, {{together}} with limited available resources {{have resulted in}} the need to develop alternative energy sources to ensure sustainable and expanding economies. Hydrogen is being considered a viable option with particular application to fuel cells. The Hybrid Sulphur cycle has been identified as a process to produce clean hydrogen (carbon free process) and can have economic benefits when coupled to nuclear reactors (High Temperature Gas Reactor) or solar heaters for the supply of the required process energy. The <b>sulphur</b> <b>trioxide</b> decomposition reactor producing sulphur dioxide for the electrolytic cells in a closed loop system has been examined, {{but it is clear that}} development with respect to a more durable active catalyst in a reactor operating under severe conditions needs to be investigated. A suitable <b>sulphur</b> <b>trioxide</b> reactor needs to operate at a high temperature with efficient heating in view of the endothermic reaction, and has to consist of special materials of construction to handle the very corrosive reactants and products. This investigation was undertaken to address (1) the synthesis, characterisation, reactivity and stability of a suitable catalyst (2), determination the reaction rate of the chosen catalyst with a suitable micro reactor (3) construction and evaluation of a packed bed reactor for the required reaction, and (4) the development and validation of a reactor model using computational fluid dynamics with associated chemical reactions. A supported catalyst consisting of 0. 5 wt% platinum and 0. 5 wt% palladium on rutile (TiO 2, titania) was prepared by the sintering of an anatase/rutile supported catalyst with the same noble metal composition, synthesized according to an incipient impregnation procedure using cylindrical porous pellets (± 1. 7 mm diameter and ± 5 mm long). Characterization involving: surface area, porosity, metal composition, - dispersion, - particle size, support phase and sulphur content was carried out and it was found from reactivity determinations that the sintered catalyst, which was very different from the synthesized catalyst, had an acceptable activity and stability which was suitable for further evaluation. A micro pellet reactor was constructed and operated and consisted of a small number of pellets (five) placed apart from each other in a two-stage quartz reactor with <b>sulphur</b> <b>trioxide</b> generated from sulphuric acid in the first stage and the conversion of <b>sulphur</b> <b>trioxide</b> in the second stage, respectively. Attention was only confined to the second stage involving the conversion of <b>sulphur</b> <b>trioxide</b> with the supported catalyst. The overall reaction kinetics of the pellets involving momentum, heat and mass transfer and chemical reaction was evaluated and validated with constants obtained from literature and with an unknown reaction rate equation for which constants were obtained by regression. As result of the complexity of the flow, mass and heat transfer fields in the micro pellet reactor it was necessary to use a CFD model with chemical reactions which was accomplished with a commercial code COMSOL MultiPhysics® 4. 3 b. A reversible reaction rate equation was used and a least squares regression procedure was used to evaluate the activation energy and pre-exponential factor. The activation energy obtained for the first order forward reaction was higher than values obtained from literature for a first order reaction rate (irreversible reaction) for the platinum group metals on titania catalysts. Detailed analyses of the velocity, temperature and concentration profile revealed the importance of using a complex model for determination of the reaction parameters. A fixed bed reactor system consisting of a sulphuric acid vaporizer, a single reactor tube (1 m length, 25 mm OD) heated with a surrounding electrical furnace followed, by a series of condensers for the analysis of the products was constructed and operated. Three process variables were investigated, which included the inlet temperature, the weight hourly velocity and the residence time in order to assess the performance of the reactor and generate results for developing a model. The results obtained included the wall and reactor centreline temperature profiles together with average conversion. As a result of the complexity of the chemistry and the phases present containing the products from the reactor a detailed calculation was done using vapour/liquid equilibrium with the accompanying mass balance (Aspen-Plus®) to determine the distribution of <b>sulphur</b> <b>trioxide,</b> sulphur dioxide, oxygen and steam. A mass balance was successfully completed with analyses including SO 2 with a GC, O 2 with a paramagnetic cell analyser, acid/base titrations with sodium hydroxide, SO 2 titrations with iodine and measurement of condensables (mass and volume). The results obtained showed that a steady state (constant conversion) was obtained after approximately six hours and that it was possible to obtain <b>sulphur</b> <b>trioxide</b> conversion approaching equilibrium conditions for bed lengths of 100 mm with very low weight hourly space velocities. A heterogeneous 2 D model consisting of the relevant continuity, momentum, heat transfer and mass transfer and the reaction rate equation determined in this investigation was developed and solved with the use of the commercial code COMSOL MultiPhysics® 4. 3 b with an appropriate mesh structure. The geometry of the packed bed (geometry) was accomplished by generating a randomly packed bed with a commercial package DigiPac™. The model predicted results that agreed with experimental results with conversions up to 56 %, obtained over the following ranges: weight hourly space velocity equal to 15 h- 1, temperatures between 903 K and 1053 K and residence times between 0. 1 and 0. 07 seconds. The post-processing results were most useful for assessing the effect of the controlling mechanisms and associated parameters. Doctora...|$|E

40|$|The {{mechanism}} of formation of <b>sulphur</b> <b>trioxide</b> in combustion gases {{has been investigated}} using liquid fuel firing combustor with laminar pre-mixed flame. The combustion chamber was constructed from a stainless steel tube for minimizing any affect of catalysis. A temperature controlled evaporating chamber was designed where liquid fuel was evaporated and mixed with total combustion air prior to entering the combustion zone. The vapour mixture then passed through a silica sintered disc and a flat flame was produced. Six sampling ports at 0. 304 m (1 ft) intervals along the combustion tube were used for sampling the gases for analysis and for the measurement of <b>sulphur</b> <b>trioxide</b> with respect to residence time. Diesel oil, Kerosine, Cyclohexane, n-hexane, and n-Pentane {{were used in the}} investigation: Sulphur content of these fuels were raised to 3. 4 % (wt.) by addition of appropriate amount of carbon disulphide (CS 2) in each fuel. It was found that SO 3 was only formed when there was an excess oxygen in the combustion gases and under sub-stoichiometric conditions, no SO 3 could be detected. An increase in the quantity of combustion air in excess of stoichiometric requirement lead to an increase in the concentration of SO 3 in the combustion gases. However, the level of SO 3 content in the flue gases reached a maximum at about 4 % excess oxygen concentration in the flue gases. It was established that ignition properties of fuels {{have an effect on the}} oxidation of S 02. Ignition delay v temperature curves for the fuels employed in the research programme were determined. This was done with the help of Ignition-Delay apparatus (PART II). It was found that fuels having shorter ignition delay times at. temperatures. prevailing near flame zone produced less SO 3 under identical combustion conditions. The results of the effect of residence time of combustion gases in the high temperature zone showed that in the first instance amount of SO 3 formed was in excess of those predicted from thermodynamic considerations involving molecular oxygen. <b>Sulphur</b> <b>trioxide</b> thus formed began to dissociate back into sulphur dioxide and oxygen as the gases continued to pass along the combustion chamber.

The Shankodi-Jangwa coal sample had the highest sulphur content of 1.63 %, which is above the maximum acceptable limit of 1.5 % to 1.60 %[17]. High sulphur must be reduced during iron and steel making either by modifying the blast furnace burden with a consequence reduction in iron output or by external desulphurizing technique which are both money- and time-consuming[17]. Even though sulphur contributes to the heating value of coal, on combustion, it produces acids of sulphur dioxide (SO 2) and <b>sulphur</b> <b>trioxide</b> (SO 3) which corrode the equipment and also cause atmospheric pollution.

This highly endothermic reaction requires a catalyst to lower the reaction temperature. This reaction forms part of the HyS (Hybrid Sulphur) cycle, a proposed thermochemical process for the industrial scale production of hydrogen and oxygen from water. The study aimed at obtaining reaction kinetics for this reaction employing pure, unsupported iron (III) oxide as catalyst as a cheaper alternative compared to supported iron catalysts. It {{was found that the}} SO 3 conversion was carried out in the absence of diffusion limitations and that the reverse reaction did not play a significant role. By assuming plug flow conditions in the reactor and 1 st order kinetics, the kinetic parameters of the reaction were obtained. These parameters that form part of the Arrhenius law in describing the reaction rate constant, were determined to be 118 (± 23) kj / mol for the activation energy (Ea), and a value of 3 (± 0. 5) x 108 hr- 1 was obtained for the Arrhenius frequency factor (A). Both values correspond to literature, although in general larger activation energies were published for iron (III) oxide derived supported catalysts. A comparison of {{the performance of}} the pure, unsupported iron (III) oxide catalyst with other iron (III) oxide derived supported catalysts (or pellets) has shown that the pure iron (III) oxide catalyst exhibit similar activities. Avoiding expensive catalyst preparation will be an initial step in the direction of developing a cost effective catalyst for the decomposition of <b>sulphur</b> <b>trioxide.</b> It is, however, recommended to investigate different particle sizes as well as purity levels of the unsupported iron (III) oxide to find an optimum cost to performance ratio, as the degree of fineness and the degree of purity will largely influence the final catalyst cost. A qualitative investigation with various reaction product species as well as water in the reactor feed was conducted to assess the influence of these species on the reaction rate. The addition of these species seems to have a larger influence on the reaction rate at low reaction temperatures around 700 °C than at higher reaction temperatures (i. e. 750 °C and 825 °C). This can be attributed to adsorption rates of such species that reduce at higher temperatures. Observations at higher reaction temperatures also suggest that the reaction is of a first-order nature.

40|$|The {{sulphur cycle}} plays {{fundamental}} {{roles in the}} chemistry and climate of Venus. Thermodynamic equilibrium chemistry at the surface of Venus favours the production of carbonyl sulphide {{and to a lesser}} extent sulphur dioxide. These gases are transported to the middle atmosphere by the Hadley circulation cell. Above the cloud top, a sulphur oxidation cycle involves conversion of carbonyl sulphide into sulphur dioxide, which is then transported further upwards. A significant fraction of this sulphur dioxide is subsequently oxidized to <b>sulphur</b> <b>trioxide</b> and eventually reacts with water to form sulphuric acid. Because the vapour pressure of sulphuric acid is low, it readily condenses and forms an upper cloud layer at altitudes of 60 – 70 [*]km, and an upper haze layer above 70 [*]km (ref. 9), which effectively sequesters sulphur oxides from photochemical reactions. Here we present simulations of the fate of sulphuric acid in the Venusian mesosphere based on the Caltech/JPL kinetics model, but including the photolysis of sulphuric acid.

The C—Si bond is fairly stable towards homolytic fission, and under free radical conditions the C—H bonds of organosilicon compounds are usually more readily attacked than the C—Si bonds 1. The C—Si bond is moderately polar, however, (Pauling electronegativities indicate that there is 12 % ionic character in the direction CSi+), and is relatively easily attacked by ionic reagents. Since C—H bonds break heterolytically in the same direction, C-Hf, a good indication of the behaviour of an R—Si bond {{can be obtained by}} considering the reactions of the corresponding R—H bond 2. For example, just as the C—H bond of chloroform, HCC 13, is readily broken by attack of hydroxide ion on the hydrogen atom, so the Si—C bond of the compound Me 3 SiCC 13 is broken, even more readily, in alkali, by nucleophilic attack at silicon. Again, just as aryl—H bonds are broken readily by electrophilic reagents such as bromine or <b>sulphur</b> <b>trioxide,</b> so aryl—SiMe 3 bonds are also broken readily by these reagents. It is usually but not always true that an R—SiMe 3 bond is more reactive than the corresponding R—H bond towards ionic reagents...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The present work {{investigates the}} {{physical}} and chemical characteristics of some local gypsum minerals and to develop an appropriate process technology for their exploitation, refining and utilization in Nigeria. Though a number of gypsum deposits {{have been found in}} Nigeria, three varieties were studied in this work. The gypsum samples from lgbokotor and lbeshe villages in ogun state were observed via a manual pitting method while the third variety was procured from Potiskum in Borno state. The raw gypsum were beneficiated to remove obvious physical impurities and air-dried. In this experiment, the raw gypsum were analysed to determine their chemical constituents using the conventional wet silicate technique. The six major significant constituents, Carbon Dioxide (CO 2); Calcium Oxide (CaO); Magnesium Oxide (MgO); <b>Sulphur</b> <b>Trioxide</b> (SO 3); Ferrous Oxide (Fe 203) and combined matter (Loss-on-ignition) were determined. Using an electrical Kiln with digital control, a calcinations sequence of 160 °c — 30 'c (temperature) range against 60 minutes — 300 minutes (time) was used during the heat treatment procedure. The results of the experiment showed that the optimum water — plaster ratio was 3 : 2 while the setting or hardening time was between 3. 0 — 8. 0 minutes. Other physical properties such as the density, colour, particle size were found to be in agreement with literature. Consequent upon the investigation reported here, an adaptive refining process technology for Nigerian Gypsum mineral has been developed and the process development and description are presented...|$|E
