The guarantor should know the entrepreneur reasonable well and should preferable live in the same community. SME loan can be repaid in two ways, 1) in equal monthly loan installment with monthly interest payment. 2) By one single payment at maturity, with interest repayable a quarter ends residual on maturity. Customer relation officers search new potential customer by providing door-to-door service. They talk with clients and monitor their manners, activities of their business and provide the loan to the potential customers. SME, BRAC Bank may provide 100 % of net required working capital but not exceeding 75 % of the aggregate value of the inventory and account receivable. Normally, organizations meet their working capital from over draft loan but BRAC Bank designed the loan to meet working capital but as term loan which is repaid in installment. The customer relation officers also monitor the borrowers’ activities after the loan disbursement. Monitoring also facilitates the buildup of an information base for future reference. Asset Operation Department acts as the last line defense of the bank. This division is responsible for the complete disbursement, recovery and closing procedures. The procedures start from the sanction of the SME loan. The respective select potential enterprise, collect confidential information about the enterprise, open clients account is the respective bank where BRAC Bank has its own account, filled up CIB form and send it to the Asset Operation Department. Then the Asset Operation Department starts its activities. The Asset Operation Department sends the CIB form to the Bangladesh Bank to know the CIB status of the applicant. If the report found clean then it send back to the unit office for send proposal for the loan. Then the unit office sanction loan and send it again in Asset Operation Department for disbursement. The Asset Operation Department then prepare a loan file and checks all necessary documents, prepare a list and disburse it. Then the Asset Operation Department starts enter all information regarding the loan in the banking software “Millennium Banking System (MBS) ” which includes initial ID generation, loan account opening, risk fund collection, activation of the loan.

SME plays {{a very important role}} in economic advancement of Bangladesh. As major business of IDLC Finance Limited is providing <b>SME</b> loan <b>facilities</b> to the business along with various types of loan to individual and organizations therefore risk is associated with each and every product they are offering. Risk is the element of uncertainty or possibility of loss that prevail in any business transaction in any place, in any mode and at any time. In the financial arena, enterprise risks can be broadly categorized as Credit Risk, Operational Risk, Market Risk and Other risk. Credit risk is the possibility that a borrower or counter party will fail to meet agreed obligations. Thus managing credit risk for efficient management of a FI has gradually become the most crucial task. IDLC finance has its own process to mitigate credit risk. They make an appraisal report which shows the strength of the borrower and possible risk related to the loan how the risk can be mitigate. Besides the appraisal report IDLC maintain information about past borrower in a software named “Flexccube”. So whenever these past borrower come to collect refinance, IDLC cross check the information with “Flexccube “information. Moreover IDLC gives highest priority to the CIB (Credit information bureau) report. If the report is not good and does not reflect the strength of the business than IDLC does not finance in that business.

As major business of IDLC Finance Limited is providing <b>SME</b> loan <b>facilities</b> to the business along with various types of loan to individual and organizations therefore risk is associated with each and every product they are offering. The trend of SME loan disbursement in context of IDLC Financing is highest at trading sector, followed by manufacturing sector and then service sector. The trend of the segment- wise disbursement is same for IDLC. IDLC distribute more than half of their SME portfolio in trading industry because collecting data in the trading sector is easily available and sales verification is simpler than other sectors. Nonperforming loans is common phenomena for banking industry in Bangladesh. A Nonperforming loan is a loan that is in default or close to being in default. Many loans become nonperforming after being in default for 90 days, but this can depend on the contract terms. In the financial arena, enterprise risks can be broadly categorized as Credit Risk, Operational Risk, Market Risk and Other risk.

With the clear mission to provide efficient banking services and to contribute socio-economic development of the country, Mercantile Bank Ltd emerged as a new commercial bank and inaugurated its operation on 2 nd June, 1999. The bank stood 47 branches {{all over the country}} up to 2009. There are 30 sponsors involved in creating Mercantile Bank Limited. The sponsors of the bank have a long heritage of trade, commerce and industry. They are highly regarded for their entrepreneurial competence. The banking philosophy of Mercantile Bank Limited is not to ‘carry coal to the new castle'. The main target is to make credits available to the poor people & their activities are aimed at multifaceted growth where people from all economic strata will enjoy the benefits of better living standard, dignity of labor and self worth. Mercantile Bank Limited provide Small and Medium Enterprise (<b>SME)</b> loan <b>facilities</b> to experienced and inexperienced entrepreneurs located in the urban and sub-urban areas to encourage new and educated young entrepreneurs to undertake productive ventures, to assist them {{to take part in the}} economic activities. To achieving the profit target, Mercantile Bank Ltd. is more interested for big and corporate loans than Small and Medium Enterprise (SME) Loan. However, they keep constant persuasion with the Heads of Branches to increase exposure in Small and Medium Enterprise (SME) Loan, but they are always handicapped with shortage of manpower in the branches. Small and Medium Enterprise (SME) is a supervised credit and needs more manpower for constant follow up, monitoring and recovery. And as such, branches ask for posting of additional manpower exclusively for Small and Medium Enterprise (SME). In this situation, it is necessary to increase substantial exposure in Small and Medium Enterprise (SME), open separate desk in the branches with adequate manpower. The bank must make a positive attempt to be more outward looking in their goals and aware of what is happening. They should have to emphasize on the domestic scenario more closely and analyze any certain trends and strategies of their competitors. By this way the Bank will be able to keep on playing its important roles in our economy. Shetu GuptaB. Business Administratio...|$|R
40|$|The vast {{majority}} of businesses in Ireland are small and medium sized enterprises. The importance of the SME contribution to the Irish economy in general, and export earnings in particular, is therefore clear. However, small business survival rates are unacceptably low and {{in the struggle for}} survival, growth is clearly an important element. Exporting {{is one of the most}} important forms of such growth. Therefore, success in export markets is crucial to the long term growth of Irish business and the Irish economy. In response to the above an extensive amount of research has been conducted with the object of tracing factors impeding export activity. In light of certain gaps in the relevant literature, this study attempts to improve our understanding of some of the factors that encourage and discourage SMEs to export. The study examines the characteristics of both exporting and non-exporting SMEs and how they differentiate from each other in regard to the background of the owner-manager, company background, and the barriers they face in relation to exporting. Following a review of extant literature certain organisational and managerial elements along with external factors were identified as potentially important discriminators between exporting and non-exporting. The methodology adopted in the study is outlined and justified. Both quantitative and qualitative methods were employed to extract statistics. Thereafter, findings are presented and discussed. The results suggest that exporters and non-exporters differ in many ways. The main barriers appear to be within the domestic country. The report recommends that the Irish government must do more to <b>facility</b> <b>SMEs</b> exporters and non-exporters...|$|R
40|$|The {{hypothesis}} {{of this research}} study is {{that the level of}} energy consumption within a commercial building is associated with the quality of the facility management function. The constraints of this study are limited to the Small to Medium Sized Enterprise (SME) which includes most businesses and building types in the United States. There is little available literature on facility management functions within the SME. Most literature related to facility management is directed towards larger organizations that would most likely support a facility management department. To evaluate the association between energy use and facility management quality a comparison was made by graphing energy performance against the quality of the facility management function (FM Quality). The energy metric used is the United States Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) Energy Star rating system. Energy Star is a building rating platform created to allow building operators a means for tracking performance and performance improvements. The Energy Star score is derived for each facility in this study. The inputs for arriving at a score include building type, size, climate zone, past energy bills, and quantity of computers in the building. The FM Quality metric was developed as part of this research and was derived through literature review, peer review, field study, and observation. The FM Quality metric is based on four primary factors that include corporate organizational structure, facility management expertise, facility condition, and data management practices. Within each primary factor are five individual performance, or “Quality” indicators which are graded on a 1 - 5 point scale from poor to excellent. In developing the FM Quality score, both quantitative and qualitative methods were used. Data was collected by visiting each of the small businesses and conducting an on-site walkthrough to observe conditions and, at the same time, conduct interviews with the building operators and/or managers to understand their facility management practices and organizational culture. Upon completion of the walkthrough and interviews, the data for each building was compiled into the Energy Star and FM Quality score and then transferred to a graphical format for analysis and display. The eleven subject buildings were all located in the Southeast United States (Climate Zone 3 A). The conclusions of this study confirm the fundamental aspects of the hypothesis; namely, that there is a positive association with building energy use and the quality of facility management practices. However, a larger number of subject properties would be necessary to determine this association with certainty. The development of the FM Quality metric, a direct result of this study, is an important foundation for measuring the FM function and can form a basis for future studies. This metric will help to increase understanding of how <b>SMEs</b> manage their <b>facilities</b> and can facilitate further research intended to improve the performance of facility management. Furthermore, this line of research would help to raise awareness, especially among upper level managers, that quality facility management practices {{have a significant impact on}} operation costs, energy use and facility condition.

40|$|This study, {{the role}} of small and medium sized {{enterprises}} for economic growth, was undertaken {{to find out how}} SME sub-sector in Nigeria has performed {{and its impact on the}} economic growth of the country. Small and Medium Scale Enterprises (SMEs) is accepted globally as a tool for empowering the citizenry and economic growth. It has been associated with the rapid economic growth of countries in Asia and North America. In Nigeria efforts have been made by successive governments to reduce poverty and accelerate economic growth by increasing foreign direct investment, diversifying the economy, enacting policy frameworks which favour small business ownership and sometimes initiating employment and entrepreneurship programmes. Specifically this study tends to figure out: how profitable SME business is; whether infrastructural development could be attributed to the presence of SMEs; if significant number of people are employed within the SME sector; whether the SME market has attracted banks and financial institutions with increase in loans and incentives; whether there is increase in information Technology related businesses due to presence of SMEs and if there is need for the government to encourage and develop more opportunities for SMEs. A total of 200 SMEs were randomly selected from Matori, a city in Lagos state Nigeria. A questionnaire was constructed and distributed to the selected SMEs. The responses were collated and analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) analytical tool. The study reveals that while SME businesses are profitable problems of policy inconsistency and poor infrastructural development continuously undermine the potentials of the market. Though the presence of SMEs has attracted infrastructural development, such developments in most cases are community effort or privately driven which limits the amount of developments achieved. For example their efforts could be limited to patching and maintaining existing bad road networks but not expanding or creating new road networks. The study also revealed that financial institutions like banks are attracted to areas where SMEs are established but getting funds through these institutions via loans has not been easy due to high interest rates and harsh conditions like types of collateral to present. It was also established that SMEs are good employers of labor but not without required support and <b>facilities.</b> <b>SMEs</b> will not engage more people to work for them when their businesses do not thrive. For their businesses to thrive they need government to encourage them and develop more opportunities such opportunities could be in terms of providing infrastructures like stable power supply and good transport networks (rails and roads), easy access to finance (low interest rates), stable government policies, reducing multiple taxations, ensuring availability and access to modern technology and raw materials locally etc. The result of the study confirms existing theories in the field which support the belief that SMEs remains a tool for economic growth in Nigeria. There are enormous potentials and opportunities for SMEs in Nigeria to mature and play the crucial role of economy growth, poverty reduction, employment and wealth creation. This will entail having the government provide required supports and addressing identified problems. While the SMEs also need to change their attitudes relating to entrepreneurship development, government needs to involve the SMEs in policy formulation and execution for maximum effect. There is also need to introduce entrepreneurial studies in our Universities in Nigeria in addition to emphasizing practical and technological studies at all levels of our educational system. + 234803200153...|$|R
