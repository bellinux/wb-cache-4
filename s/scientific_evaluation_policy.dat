(1) Microeconometricians developed new tools to respond to econometric problems raised by {{the analysis of the}} new source of microdata produced after the Second World War. (2) Microeconometrics improved on aggregate time series methods by building models that linked economic models for individuals to data on individual behaviour. (3) An important empirical regularity detected by the field is the diversity and heterogeneity of behaviour. This heterogeneity has profound consequences for economic theory and for econometric practice. (4) Microeconometrics has contributed substantially to the <b>scientific</b> <b>evaluation</b> of public <b>policy.</b> Microeconometrics...|$|R
40|$|Scientific {{insights}} about {{the places where}} the greatest environmental costs (and human welfare losses) might be avoided has too frequently been misperceived as knowledge about which policy interventions are effective in the extremely varied contexts where these losses can occur. This forum demonstrates the behavioral consequences that can occur when protected areas are expanded to slow deforestation and highlights a need to better understand the behavioral changes that deforestation, infrastructure development, and malaria emergence prompt in tropical areas. Facilitation of this awareness will require the integration of rigorous social and ecological science in an interdisciplinary context. This work should be aimed at understanding the opportunity costs of economic drivers, such as soybean expansion, logging, mining, hunting, and wildlife trade, in order to scale the countervailing incentives that are incorporated into common property institutions or economic instruments. To get ahead of the curve of worsening environmental degradation and the poverty traps that occur at the forest edge requires special attention to the <b>scientific</b> <b>evaluation</b> of <b>policies</b> that create incentives for environmental stewardship in the varied contexts of the tropical forest frontier...|$|R

Two country visits {{to each of the}} countries were involved. On the basis of information supplied by experts met during these visits and a review of published sources, the Regional Programme EHAP was prepared. The overall aim of the Programme was to strengthen the capacity of the individual Central and Eastern European Countries to undertake high quality studies on EHAP, in order to better inform the <b>scientific</b> <b>evaluation</b> of <b>policies</b> for the protection of human health. The programme, which will be carried out during the period 1994 - 1996 on a budget of 2, 8 million ECU, includes the following three projects: 1. A study on air pollution and respiratory disease in children. 2. A quality assurance activity. 3. A risk perception and communication study. The outline of the Programme has been reviewed by CEC DG-I and DG- 12, representatives of the Ministry of Environment and the Ministry of Health of the countries involved and by consultants of RIVM/LSHTM on a one-day workshop on September 24 1993 at the RIVM, Bilthoven. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to {{describe}} several chronological milestones in institutionalizing the evaluation of public programs and policies in France from a governmental perspective and in the health sector, situating such references in the international context.

The decision making process followed in these case studies is explored {{and the extent to which}} caution {{on the part of}} policy makers may be considered reasonable or unreasonable is discussed. Each of these cases illustrates distinct aspects of the interplay between technical and societal responses to risk that are summarized by: a ban on the perceived risk agent; implementation of the best available technology; and risk assessment and communication.

40|$|Despite the {{military}} {{efforts of the}} Kenyan, Ethiopian, and Somali Federal governments, the collaboration of the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) forces with US and coalition forces, and despite the enormous tactical and strategic set-backs that al-Shabaab has faced {{over the last five}} years, its insurgency in Horn of Africa (HoA) remains resilient. The Kenyan government’s approach to stemming domestic recruitment to al-Shabaab remains fixated on law enforcement control and surveillance. As a result, many Somali communities are subject to daily crackdowns, interrogations, and discriminatory profiling practices whose negative effects are only heightened by current tribal and clan-based tensions in the country. Current scholarly evaluations of Kenya’s countering violent extremism (CVE) policies tend to adhere to three major approaches: top-down evaluations by elites repeatedly locating the protection of national security in inter-agency cooperation; bottom-up CVE evaluations placing primacy on the voices of Muslim community elders, such as imams, social workers, parents, and community leaders for interventions with at-risk youth; and social <b>scientific</b> <b>evaluations</b> of CVE <b>policy</b> through empirical exploration of the push and pull factors of youth recruitment into militancy. To date, there is a dearth of studies asking what Kenyan youth leaders think about CVE policies {{especially in light of the}} fact that they are often the main targets of al-Shabaab attacks. This study has one key objective: to use input from Kenyan youth to evaluate the effectiveness, suitability, and appropriateness of Kenya’s current CVE policies in order to dissect their utility, inefficiencies, and possible harms, and contribute to the academic and policy discussions on the best CVE policy mix. ...|$|R
40|$|Although {{in several}} EU Member States many public {{interventions}} {{have been running}} for the prevention and/or management of obesity and other nutrition-related health conditions, few have yet been formally evaluated. The multidisciplinary team of the EATWELL project will gather benchmark data on healthy eating interventions in EU Member States and review existing information {{on the effectiveness of}} interventions using a three-stage procedure (i) Assessment of the intervention's impact on consumer attitudes, consumer behaviour and diets; (ii) The impact of the change in diets on obesity and health and (iii) The value attached by society to these changes, measured in life years gained, cost savings and quality-adjusted life years. Where evaluations have been inadequate, EATWELL will gather secondary data and analyse them with a multidisciplinary approach incorporating models from the psychology and economics disciplines. Particular attention will be paid to lessons that can be learned from private sector that are transferable to the healthy eating campaigns in the public sector. Through consumer surveys and workshops with other stakeholders, EATWELL will assess the acceptability of the range of potential interventions.

40|$|Program {{evaluation}} plays {{a significant}} role in aiding our understanding of the effectiveness of interventions. Evaluations operate under the auspices of <b>evaluation</b> <b>policies,</b> which shape aspects of evaluation design including research questions, data collection and analysis procedures, and reporting of findings. Despite considerable speculation about the influence that <b>evaluation</b> <b>policy</b> has over <b>evaluation</b> practice, we do not yet have any empirical evidence to support these ideas. Through document analysis, interviews, and an instrumental multiple case study, this study examines both the explicit and implicit policies that overarch the research and evaluation work commissioned by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF), the nation's largest philanthropy devoted to our public health. The primary objectives of the current study were to: 1) detail and describe RWJF's <b>evaluation</b> <b>policies</b> (including their development and communication to relevant parties); and 2) describe how the implementation of those <b>evaluation</b> <b>policies</b> happens in the field. Findings suggest the existence of two main policy distinctions [...] policies that are goal statements (which describe the desired outcomes of evaluation activities) and operationalized policies (which describe the specific processes that take place during the course of evaluations). This dichotomy serves as the basis for an argument that <b>evaluation</b> <b>policies</b> function as a system, rather than existing in silos as previously described in the extant literature. Furthermore, this study sheds light on the ways <b>evaluation</b> <b>policies</b> relate to organizational and shared learning within the Foundation. Finally, it is argued that the development of specific and directed policies to promote innovation are a necessary step to take to advance <b>evaluation</b> practice. <b>Evaluation</b> <b>policy</b> {{is one of the most}} critical issues facing the field of evaluation today. This study was designed to shed light on a Foundation's <b>evaluation</b> <b>policies</b> in an effort to draw connections about how <b>evaluation</b> <b>policies</b> influence <b>evaluation</b> practice.

40|$|In the United States policymakers, states, and {{researchers}} are increasingly reliant on teacher evaluations {{as a means}} for identifying high-quality teachers. School principals are the primary school-based actors responsible for implementing teacher <b>evaluation</b> <b>policies</b> at the school level and must make sense of these policies at an ever-increasing pace. These sensemaking processes have great implications for how teacher <b>evaluation</b> <b>policies</b> play out in practice. In this paper I ask (a) what factors influence principals’ sensemaking of changing teacher <b>evaluation</b> <b>policies</b> and (b) how these factors influence both decision-making by principals, as well as the ways the policies are implemented. I use an exploratory case study approach, drawing on interviews and district specific documents from six public school principals in the U. S. state of Michigan. Findings suggest that, because teacher <b>evaluation</b> <b>policies</b> were tied to the employment of their teachers, principals made sense of and implemented these policies in very specific ways.

40|$|There is {{no doubt}} that having <b>evaluation</b> <b>policies</b> makes the evaluator's job easier, by {{providing}} more transparency to the evaluation process and more security to those involved. However, this can only happen when policies are presented to potential stakeholders in clear language, as they are disseminated and utilized for guiding practice. This suggests that building an evaluation culture is necessary in order to effectively implement an <b>evaluation</b> <b>policy,</b> so it can be fully utilized. This paper briefly introduces and presents what the authors understand as the concept of " evaluation culture" and " evaluation policy". Then, it discusses the importance of <b>evaluation</b> <b>policies</b> for practice of both evaluation and meta-evaluation, and points out the possible consequences of absence of policies. Recommendations are derived from these considerations in order to inspire procedures to build and implement <b>evaluation</b> <b>policies.</b> Finally, reflections are presented based on the Brazilian experience about " culture-policy-practice" inter-relations in evaluation...|$|R
40|$|The {{implementation}} process of teacher <b>evaluation</b> <b>policy</b> is often problematic. In this regard, {{it is crucial}} to understand principals' sensemaking of teacher <b>evaluation</b> <b>policy</b> since their understandings influence the {{implementation process}}. While {{a growing body of research}} shows that principals strongly shape teachers' policy understanding, little is known about the way principals' sensemaking is influenced by teacher expectations about new policy. This qualitative study, drawn from interviews with principals and teachers in 13 secondary schools, indicates that the new teacher <b>evaluation</b> <b>policy</b> in Flanders (Belgium) is implemented by principals and supported by teachers in various ways. The findings of this study show this was the result of the process of discrepancy reduction between the initial standards principal set and the expectations that teachers had for the implementation of the policy. These findings underscore the complexity of teacher <b>evaluation</b> and help <b>policy</b> makers to understand that "the best" implementation of the teacher <b>evaluation</b> <b>policy</b> probably does not exists. Moreover, this offers important insights for principals in how they best lead the implementation of teacher evaluation...|$|R
40|$|Efforts are {{currently}} underway in the US federal context {{to improve and}} strengthen evaluation practice and increase the use of evaluation results to inform policies and programs. However, these efforts remain unrealized, due partly {{to the lack of}} a comprehensive theoretical framework that views evaluation and related organizational processes and institutions {{as part of a larger}} system. Early intuitive theoretical taxonomies of <b>evaluation</b> <b>policy</b> suffer from the lack of connection to specific examples and instances, and are missing clear classification criteria that would allow practical application. To generate a grounded taxonomy of <b>evaluation</b> <b>policy,</b> this study surveyed members of the American Evaluation Association in 2009, asking them to generate examples of <b>evaluation</b> <b>policy,</b> and then to sort and rate these suggested policies. Results are analyzed using the concept mapping method of Trochim (1989), which first translates aggregate sorting decisions into conceptual "distances" on a two-dimensional dot map, then uses hierarchical cluster analysis to generate groupings of ideas. These groupings become the foundation for categories in a theoretical taxonomy. Findings reveal several different dimensions by which participants grouped <b>evaluation</b> <b>policies,</b> including the dimensions of "value" and "policy mechanism.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the extent to which new teacher <b>evaluation</b> <b>policies</b> and practices in Japan are about controlling teachers or represent opportunities for authentic professional development. It seeks to examine how the new teacher <b>evaluation</b> <b>policies</b> are embedded within the wider policy formation, what perspectives teachers have on the new policies and what their experiences are, and how the new teacher <b>evaluation</b> <b>policies</b> are actually being enacted in schools. The thesis uses a range of methods to explore these concerns. For the purpose of macro analysis of the new teacher <b>evaluation</b> <b>policies,</b> it examines both primary and secondary documentation around policy development. For studying the impact of the policy in schools, it draws on data from a national survey and in-depth interviews with a sample of teachers and head teachers. In this way, it employs a mixed methods approach in which quantitative data is used to provide a general picture of how teachers experience and perceive the new teacher <b>evaluation</b> <b>policies</b> and practices and qualitative data is used to provide the depth of analysis required to look at the nature of performativity in schools. The concept of performativity has been central to the overall investigation. The study argues for a particular reading of performativity — a work through, as opposed to work upon, perspective. This analytical lens illustrates how the new teacher <b>evaluation</b> <b>policies</b> {{have played a role in}} producing or reinforcing the mutually policing relations that lead to destabilisation of teacher’s identities. This thesis concludes that the enactment of new teacher <b>evaluation</b> <b>policies</b> has had significant indirect impacts on teachers and teachers’ work by affecting modes of school management and teachers’ relationships. By illustrating the usefulness of the work through perspective of performativity, it has enabled theorizing of performativity to advance. It also illuminates both congruence and variance between teacher <b>evaluation</b> <b>policies</b> as enacted in Japan and other countries. Japan’s teacher evaluation is no less effective as a measure of political control than its counterparts in other countries, but it can work in a more subtle way: teacher evaluation affects, repositions, and reconstructs teachers’ work and identities through affected relationships as mentioned above. This implies that teachers as well as policymakers should develop a more broad, macro-political and critical perspective on teacher evaluation...|$|R
