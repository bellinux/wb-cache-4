By this protocol, each player sends its own action to the other player and also sends its hash to the nearest time-stamp server.

40|$|A cheat-proof {{protocol}} for real-time gaming is proposed {{under the assumption}} that time-stamp servers issue <b>serially</b> <b>numbered</b> time stamps honestly and are available near every player, i. e., they exist everywhere in the Internet. With this protocol, each player sends its action to the other player and also sends its hash to the nearest time-stamp server.

The actions are checked to verify that they are compatible with the hashes, and the signed hashes are checked to verify that they have the correct time and the serial numbers are contiguous. The only latency in this protocol is the travel time of the packet from one player to another. In comparison with other existing protocols, we confirm that the proposed protocol is as fast as and more secure than the fair synchronization protocol, the fastest existing protocol.

50|$|In {{response}} to growing interest by wealthy and great patrons, including {{several of the}} royal families of Europe, two great works on the art and science of turning were published in France:. Meanwhile, turning technology was being developed in England where the practice of arresting the work from point to point (by a division plate) and applying a revolving cutter (held in an improved slide rest) was employed. By {{the beginning of the}} 19th century John Jacob Holtzapffel had established his workshop in London and built a reputation as a maker of high-class lathes and tools. Many of his customers were among the monarchs and nobility of Europe and England became the world centre for the pastime of ornamental turning. The Holtzapffel firm continued to make lathes until 1927 by which time they had produced a total of 2557, <b>serially</b> <b>numbered,</b> many of which were equipped for ornamental turning.

50|$|In 1924 the {{auditors}} of Touche Niven (Touche, Niven & Company) gave the rubber importer, Fred Stern and Company, an unqualified audit certificate, {{having failed to}} discover that management had falsified entries to overstate accounts receivable.

On the faith of one of those copies, given to it on its demand, the plaintiff, Ultramares Corporation, lent Fred Stern and Company money. Stern declared bankruptcy in 1925. Ultramares sued Touche Niven for the amount of the Stern debt, declaring that a careful audit would have shown Stern to be insolvent. The audit was found to be negligent, but not fraudulent. The judge set this finding aside based on the doctrine of privity, which protects auditors from third party suits. An intermediate appellate court reinstated the negligence verdict. The case then went to the New York Court of Appeals, Judge Benjamin Cardozo presiding.|$|R

50|$|The authors {{explain to}} {{have adopted a}} {{three-fold}} scheme for translating and interpreting the Arabic words and expressions. First, interpreting an expression {{in the light of}} a corroborative testimony of the Quranic idiom itself. Secondly, the ‘context’ of a word or expression, which determines the meaning. Thirdly, meanings and explanations in the standard lexicons of the Arabic language, such as the Lisan al-Arab, the Taj al-'Arus, the Mufradat of Imam Raghib, the Arabic English Lexicon by E. W. Lane and the Aqrab al-Mawarud etc. Words in italics have been placed to further explain/qualify the meaning of the text. The verses have been interpreted by appending notes to them which are <b>serially</b> <b>numbered</b> throughout the Commentary. It is claimed these notes derive their authority from the spirit and tenor of the Holy Quran. A concordance has been created to enable search for the same or similar expressions/concepts at other places of the Holy Quran.

The 31st Bde was broken up and personnel from the 57th Arty were reassigned to the 55th Arty and to the 59th Arty slated for the Philippines. This enabled the 55th to activate HHD&CTs of the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Bns, {{as well as to}} moderately reinforce the firing batteries. In addition, Service Btry was activated. The 55th Arty arrived in Honolulu 5-12-21 and was posted to Fort Kamehameha. The regiment was soon reorganized. The three battalions were restructured with three batteries each by reassigning personnel from three companies manning fixed seacoast armament. This resulted in the activation of Btrys G, H, & I and the relocation of 1st Bn to Fort Shafter and 2nd Bn to Ft. Ruger.

40|$|OBJECTIVES. This paper {{describes}} {{the principles and}} first results of the newly implemented anonymous mandatory human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) reporting system in Denmark. METHODS. The system {{is based on a}} <b>serially</b> <b>numbered</b> form that is circulated among the laboratories, the physicians, and the national surveillance unit. All laboratories doing confirmatory tests for HIV antibodies must send a report form along with any positive test results. Before forwarding the form, the laboratory is to fill in the top part with the name and address of the requesting physician and send the back copy to the surveillance unit. The physicians are mandated by law to fill in the form with data on the patient and to keep two copies for their own files before sending the original to the surveillance unit. RESULTS. After a revision of the system, a response rate of 95 % was obtained. CONCLUSIONS. We have established an anonymous mandatory HIV surveillance system in Denmark that enables routine evaluation of the completeness of reporting and nonresponding physicians to be reminded of their duty to report. Also, the physicians can act as mediators between patients and researchers; therefore, nested studies can be done without breaking the anonymity of the patient...|$|R
