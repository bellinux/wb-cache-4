The [...] "relic chapel" [...] {{is connected to}} a larger chapel that in turn is the central feature of an interesting 19th century brick convent. A 2007 segment on National Public Radio describes this unique collection of relics.

40|$|Bleeding is {{a common}} sequela of oral and {{periodontal}} surgery. Generally, bleeding is self-limiting. Following traumatic injury or surgical procedures, hemorrhage can range from a minor leakage or oozing at the site, to extensive bleeding leading to complete exsanguinations. Significant postsurgical hemorrhage following periodontal surgery is uncommon due to the primary closure of the soft tissues. This case report describes the unique formation of a "liver clot" or "currant jelly clot" following periodontal flap surgery. The likelihood of this {{may be attributed to}} many factors, like infection, intrinsic trauma, presence of foreign bodies like <b>splinter</b> <b>of</b> <b>bone,</b> a fleck of enamel, or a piece of dental restorative dressing material that may cause repeated, delayed organization of blood coagulum...|$|E

40|$|In this Bachelor Thesis, {{the animal}} (mammal) <b>bone</b> remains <b>of</b> the Merovingian site of Oegstgeest were discussed. The Merovingian {{settlement}} at Oegstgeest was located along the Old River Rhine and was possibly {{part of a}} (inter) regional trade network. Agriculture and animal husbandry were important parts of its economy. A comparison was made between three different contexts; the waste pits, wells and the channel. The goal of this Bachelor Thesis was to show {{whether there are differences}} between the composition of these assemblages (age data, fragmentation, representation of elements etc.) and how these might be explained. Taphonomy was important for the interpretation of these differences. There are not many differences between the assemblages and the general patterns in these assemblages are largely the same. The archaeological features (waste pits, wells and the channel) probably had the same function; waste disposal. One of the most notable differences is that primarily the waste pit material are more fragmented, which can indicate worse preservation conditions or the extraction <b>of</b> <b>bone</b> marrow (leads to <b>splintering</b> <b>of</b> <b>bones).</b> Another notable difference is the large amount <b>of</b> pig <b>bones</b> in the channel assemblage, compared to the other assemblages. This can be partially explained by the influence of post-depositional taphonomic processes, but the differences are too big to solely ascribe them to taphonomic processes. It is hard to identify, which taphonomic processes took place and how large of an impact they had on the assemblage. Thus the conclusions presented in this research are indications of what could have underlain the observed patterns. Future research should focus on identifying taphonomic signatures (preservation <b>of</b> the <b>bones</b> etc.) and try to establish the influence of post-depositional processes on the formation of the assemblages. Furthermore larger datasets would give a more representative picture of the assemblages...|$|R

Accustomed to a hard life as these men were, they were almost as insensible to pain as the Indians themselves. After the <b>splinters</b> <b>of</b> <b>bone</b> had been removed, the wound was washed with warm water and then carefully bandaged. A fire had by this time been lit a short distance in the forest {{in a position where}} its light could not be observed by any passing canoe. Here the men bivouacked, taking it by turns to keep watch. For four days they remained here; then one of them started {{as soon as it was}} dark, in Mary's canoe, to examine the clearing. He returned in little over an hour. The cabin and outbuildings had all been burnt, and the place was absolutely deserted. It was agreed that there was not the slightest chance of the Indians returning there, and the settler and three of the men at once began to fell trees; while the fourth, who could not assist in active work for some time, went down in the canoe to the village, which he found had been entirely destroyed, but that a body of the State militia had arrived there. From them he learned that another village had been destroyed; but in an attack on a third the Indians had been repulsed with great loss, and had not since been heard of, and it was believed that they had retired to their own villages.|$|R
60|$|Wednesday, February 4th.--Visited Armory-square hospital, went pretty {{thoroughly}} through wards E and D. Supplied {{paper and}} envelopes {{to all who}} wish'd--as usual, found plenty of men who needed those articles. Wrote letters. Saw and talk'd {{with two or three}} members of the Brooklyn 14th regt. A poor fellow in ward D, with a fearful wound in a fearful condition, was having some loose <b>splinters</b> <b>of</b> <b>bone</b> taken from the neighborhood of the wound. The operation was long, and one of great pain--yet, after it was well commenced, the soldier bore it in silence. He sat up, propp'd--was much wasted--had lain a long time quiet in one position (not for days only but weeks,) a bloodless, brown-skinn'd face, with eyes full of determination--belong'd to a New York regiment. There was an unusual cluster of surgeons, medical cadets, nurses, &c., around his bed--I thought the whole thing was done with tenderness, and done well. In one case, the wife sat by the side of her husband, his sickness typhoid fever, pretty bad. In another, by the side of her son, a mother--she told me she had seven children, and this was the youngest. (A fine, kind, healthy, gentle mother, good-looking, not very old, with a cap on her head, and dress'd like home--what a charm it gave to the whole ward.) I liked the woman nurse in ward E--I noticed how she sat a long time by a poor fellow who just had, that morning, in addition to his other sickness, bad hemorrhage--she gently assisted him, reliev'd him of the blood, holding a cloth to his mouth, as he coughed it up--he was so weak he could only just turn his head over on the pillow.|$|R

6000|$|Not all of {{this did}} the child note; it is {{what would have been}} noted by an elder observer; he saw little but that these were men, yet crept like babes. Being men, they were not terrible, though unfamiliarly clad. He moved among them freely, going from one to another and peering into their faces with childish curiosity. All their faces were {{singularly}} white and many were streaked and gouted with red. Something in this-- something too, perhaps, in their grotesque attitudes and movements-- reminded him of the painted clown whom he had seen last summer in the circus, and he laughed as he watched them. But on and ever on they crept, these maimed and bleeding men, as heedless as he of the dramatic contrast between his laughter and their own ghastly gravity. To him it was a merry spectacle. He had seen his father's negroes creep upon their hands and knees for his amusement--had ridden them so, [...] "making believe" [...] they were his horses. He now approached one of these crawling figures from behind and with an agile movement mounted it astride. The man sank upon his breast, recovered, flung the small boy fiercely to the ground as an unbroken colt might have done, then turned upon him a face that lacked a lower jaw--from the upper teeth to the throat was a great red gap fringed with hanging shreds <b>of</b> flesh and <b>splinters</b> <b>of</b> <b>bone.</b> The unnatural prominence of nose, the absence of chin, the fierce eyes, gave this man the appearance of a great bird of prey crimsoned in throat and breast by the blood of its quarry. The man rose to his knees, the child to his feet. The man shook his fist at the child; the child, terrified at last, ran to a tree near by, got upon the farther side of it and took a more serious view of the situation. And so the clumsy multitude dragged itself slowly and painfully along in hideous pantomime--moved forward down the slope like a swarm of great black beetles, with never a sound of going--in silence profound, absolute.|$|R

25|$|By 10–12 {{million years}} ago, the hyena family had {{split into two}} {{distinct}} groups: dog-like hyenas and bone-crushing hyenas. The arrival of the ancestral bone-crushing hyenas coincided with {{the decline of the}} similarly built family Percrocutidae. The bone-crushing hyenas survived the changes in climate and the arrival of canids, which wiped out the dog-like hyenas, though they never crossed into North America, as their niche there had already been taken by the dog subfamily Borophaginae. By 5 million years ago, the bone-crushing hyenas had become the dominant scavengers of Eurasia, primarily feeding on large herbivore carcasses felled by sabre-toothed cats. One genus, Pachycrocuta, was a 200kg (440lb) mega-scavenger that could <b>splinter</b> the <b>bones</b> <b>of</b> elephants. With the decline of large herbivores by the late ice age, Pachycrocuta was replaced by the smaller Crocuta.|$|R
5000|$|About {{this time}} a priest of the Diocese of Augsburg, named Tozzo or Toto, came as a pilgrim to the grave of Saint Gall and invited Magnus to {{accompany}} him to {{the eastern part of}} the Allgäu. Magnus proceeded to Eptaticus (Epfach), where Wichbert, Bishop of Augsburg received him and entrusted him with the Christianization of the eastern Allgäu. He penetrated into the wilderness, then crossed the Lech River at a place still known as St. Mangstritt ("footstep of Saint Magnus") and built a cell, where afterwards the monastery of Füssen was erected, and where he died. He was buried in the church he had constructed. In 851 he was reburied in the newly erected church. One <b>of</b> his <b>bones</b> was sent to St Gallen in Switzerland. Around the year 1100 all his bones were found to be missing. The burial place can be seen in the crypt of St Mang Basilica, Füssen.

40|$|During {{the archaeological}} {{excavations}} {{conducted in the}} 13 th century cemetery of the Church of S. Agostino in Poggibonsi, Tuscany (Italy), a skull with evidences of neurosurgical intervention was brought to light. The skull, belonging to an adult male, shows two traumatic lesions produced by bladed instruments. The first lesion, located on the anterior part <b>of</b> the parietal <b>bones,</b> involved only the outer cranial table; bone remodeling indicates that the individual survived the injury for a long time. The second lesion, located on the frontal bone, involved all {{the thickness of the}} bone; the absence of reparative processes allows a diagnosis of peri mortem lesion. In order to treat this wound the patient was submitted to a surgical intervention. In fact, in correspondence to the lesion, an oval bone loss, with clean and well-defined cutting-edges, can be interpreted {{as the result of a}} trepanation, probably performed to clean the wound and to remove any <b>bone</b> <b>splinters.</b> Half <b>of</b> the <b>bone</b> "rondella" was found in situ; it can be hypothesized that the surgeon decided to replace the bony piece to protect the brain. However, the surgical intervention failed and the patient died soon afterwards.

60|$|Bone.--Small smooth bits of {{the dried}} hyoidal <b>bone</b> <b>of</b> a fowl {{moistened}} with saliva were placed on two leaves, and a similarly moistened <b>splinter</b> <b>of</b> an extremely hard, broiled mutton-chop bone on a third leaf. These leaves soon became strongly inflected, and remained so for an unusual length of time; namely, one leaf for ten {{and the other two}} for nine days. The bits <b>of</b> <b>bone</b> were surrounded all the time by acid secretion. When examined under a weak power, they were found quite softened, so that they were readily penetrated by a blunt needle, torn into fibres, or compressed. Dr. Klein was so kind as to make sections <b>of</b> both <b>bones</b> and examine them. He informs me that both presented the normal appearance <b>of</b> decalcified <b>bone,</b> with traces <b>of</b> the earthy salts occasionally left. The corpuscles with their processes were very distinct in most parts; but in some parts, especially near the periphery <b>of</b> the hyoidal <b>bone,</b> none could be seen. Other parts again appeared amorphous, with even the longitudinal striation <b>of</b> <b>bone</b> not distinguishable. This amorphous structure, [page 106] as Dr. Klein thinks, may be the result either of the incipient digestion of the fibrous basis or of all the animal matter having been removed, the corpuscles being thus rendered invisible. A hard, brittle, yellowish substance occupied the position of the medulla in the fragments <b>of</b> the hyoidal <b>bone.</b>|$|R
