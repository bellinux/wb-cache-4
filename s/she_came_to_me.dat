5|$|That night I {{asked the}} Mother of God {{what was to}} become of me. Then <b>she</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> holding two crowns, one white, the other red. She asked me if I was willing to accept either of these crowns. The white one meant that I should persevere in purity, and the red that I should become a martyr. I said that I would accept them both.|$|E
500|$|In January 1896 Yeats moved again, {{into a small}} flat in Woburn Place, {{so as to be}} {{nearer to}} her. Finally after a charged bed-buying session, with Yeats {{describing}} [...] "an embarrassed conversation upon the width", and his nervousness preventing them at first from becoming lovers, he eventually wrote in January 1896, [...] "at last <b>she</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> in my thirtieth year.... and we had many days of happiness". Yeats' happiness is apparent in the poems he wrote at that period, and for the duration of their affair, Olivia appears to have acted as a muse to the poet.|$|E
6000|$|Cecily relapsed into anxious thought, {{and care}} sat visibly on her brow {{for the rest}} of the day. Next morning <b>she</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> and said: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not quite," [...] Arthur replied, with a {{confident}} smile, {{which seemed to}} say, I have but <b>to</b> ask, and <b>she</b> <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that instant.|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{brought it}} on herself," [...] said Dame Scratchard. [...] "Why didn't <b>she</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> before <b>she</b> sat? She {{was always an}} upstart, self-conceited thing; but I'm sure I pity her." ...|$|R
6000|$|I am {{lost in the}} {{recollection}} of this delicious interview, and the waltz, when <b>she</b> <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> again, with a plain elderly gentleman who has been playing whist all night, upon her arm, and says: ...|$|R
6000|$|She turn'd me into an ugly worm, And gar'd me toddle {{about the}} tree; And aye on ilka Saturday night, Auld Alison Gross <b>she</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But that's not all. <b>She</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> in her difficulty, {{and said}} that if I didna promise her this {{privilege}} she would nurse Ballingall no more." ...|$|E
6000|$|MRS TARLETON. And why didnt {{you come}} to me? I didnt {{turn my back on}} your mother when <b>she</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> in her trouble. Didnt you know that? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I often do," [...] he confessed. [...] "Till {{something}} goes wrong. Then <b>she</b> <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> As <b>she</b> did {{on that first}} evening, six years ago. You see, I have been more or less living with her since then," [...] he added with a smile.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>came</b> quickly <b>to</b> <b>me</b> {{and took}} me by the shoulders, looking into my face.|$|R
60|$|AUGUSTA (bridling). The leopard doesn't {{change his}} spots. And has she shown {{any sign of}} repentance? Has <b>she</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> and asked my pardon for {{the way in which}} she treated me? Has she gone to church and asked God's forgiveness? But I know you are an agnostic, Jonathan,--it grieves me. I couldn't expect you to see the {{necessity}} of that.|$|R
6000|$|... "Young! Is {{not that}} your mother's teaching? Why, those were her very words when <b>she</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> at my house. I {{did not know}} that youth was any excuse for falsehood." ...|$|E
60|$|Phillippa was crying, {{with her}} head on Owen's shoulder. Isabella Clark waited to see the {{mortgage}} burned up, and then <b>she</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> in the hall, all smooth and smiling again.|$|E
6000|$|... "And you spoilt {{her after}} she was found, sir. She told me part of her story that night <b>she</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> I know it is true, Barnes. You have treated her dreadfully, sir." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "She May Be Yours (But <b>She</b> <b>Comes</b> <b>to</b> See <b>Me</b> Sometimes)" [...] - Joe Hill Louis - 3:03 ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes. Tell {{her that}} you have thought the whole matter over; that you have {{realized}} that nothing but unhappiness can come from your union together. She would feel a little humiliated at first, perhaps, but <b>she</b> would <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> if you would let her go. I can deal with Irma n√©ni after that. If you will release Elsa yourself of her promise <b>she</b> would <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> I know." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>came</b> up <b>to</b> <b>me</b> with outstretched {{hands and}} a wistful look in her sweet, womanly face.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, indeed. She think him guilty! Nothing on earth,--or {{from heaven}} either, as I take it, {{would make her}} suppose it to be possible. <b>She</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> simply {{to tell me how}} good he was." ...|$|E
6000|$|Not {{long after}} this <b>she</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> with a supposition. [...] "Supposing," [...] she said, [...] "that those {{people find it}} {{impossible}} to dematerialize him, they might do something {{which would be a}} great deal worse." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "O it's true I made a {{bride of}} your daughter, But she's neither the better nor {{the worse for}} me; <b>She</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> with a horse and saddle, But she may go home in a coach and three." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>came</b> closer <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> and I can see {{the look}} in her eyes yet as she spoke.|$|R
6000|$|Then Miss Mackenzie {{could not}} {{restrain}} herself, and told Miss Baker everything. And {{she told her}} story, not with whines and lamentations, as she had thought of it herself while lying awake during the past night, but with spirited indignation. [...] "What right had <b>she</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> and accuse me?" ...|$|R
60|$|I {{could neither}} move nor speak. <b>She</b> <b>came</b> up <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> as composedly as ever, with her flowers in her hand.|$|R
6000|$|At length {{the door}} opened, and I heard the eager, bustling step of Politian, also another gliding step, which I knew {{for that of}} Martina. <b>She</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> she {{kissed me on the}} brow, and whispered into my ear, ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It isn't," [...] {{the woman}} interrupted. [...] "It's my sitting-room. Miss Montague has only an attic, and <b>she</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> {{and said that}} she couldn't receive a visitor there, and asked me to lend her my room for a few minutes." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There was one I loved once: the cry {{you heard}} was her cry: <b>She</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> to-night, and her plight was passing sore, As no woman [...] . Yea, {{and it was}} e'en the cry you heard, wife, [...] But she will cry no more! ...|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>came</b> nearer <b>to</b> <b>me</b> with timid {{pleasure}} in her eyes--with the first faint {{light of a}} smile playing round her lips.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>came</b> {{straight}} <b>to</b> <b>me</b> in a moment--just {{as easily}} as I {{could have gone to}} her myself if I had tried.|$|R
6000|$|Zul. By {{my desire}} <b>she</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> find <b>me</b> here. [...] [ZULEMA and LYNDARAXA whisper; then ZUL. [...] goes out, and LYNDAR. is going after.|$|R
6000|$|... "No {{one knows}} but ourselves. <b>She</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> because I was a {{comparative}} stranger, {{and it would}} cost her less to confess her trouble to me than to them, and she allowed me {{to speak to you}} for very much the same reason." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{thought of}} my little sister, far away in Alabama, fancied <b>she</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> and muttered, 'Amy, kiss me good-by.' The women sobbed at that; but the girl bent her sweet {{compassionate}} face to mine, and {{kissed me on the}} forehead. That was my wife." ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> unexpectedly.

[...] "Can you speak," [...] she asked, [...] "to Lady Mary Justin?" ...|$|E
60|$|I hesitated--not in the {{interests}} of propriety; only in the interest of her night's rest. <b>She</b> <b>came</b> close <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> and took my hand.|$|R
60|$|This was so {{absolutely}} true, that I had no remark <b>to</b> make. <b>She</b> <b>came</b> up <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> and put {{her hand}} on my arm.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>came</b> home <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> however, {{about an}} hour and a half after we were home, to my great delectation. Our {{visitors}} dined with us.|$|R
