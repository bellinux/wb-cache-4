40|$|Construction of a beam builder for {{producing}} triangular truss aluminum beams {{for use on}} large space structures is described. The machine will fabricate 0. 04 cm thick 2024 -T 3 aluminum alloy into beams weighing 1. 265 kg-m with side braces spot-welded to end caps to fabricate a triangular truss configuration up to 305 m long. The design characteristics, the electrical subsystems, the power requirements of the spot welding equipment, and the computer system for coordinating {{the motion of the}} Yoder rolling mills for forming caps from aluminum coils are described. Spot welding was compared with ultrasonic welding, stapling, wire <b>stitching,</b> <b>riveting,</b> grommets, stamp-lok, and pierce and fold joining methods with respect to ease of operation, safety, practicality, and ease of energy consumption. The beam builder will be evaluated to identify design requirements which can be utilized for the space flight version of its concept...|$|R
50|$|Most infantrymen wore {{lamellar}} or coat {{of plates}} cuirasses. The lamellar cuirass worn by these men {{was made of}} hundreds of small overlapping metal and/or leather plates laced {{together to make a}} flexible and light coat of armour. Coat of plates consisted of hundreds of small non-overlapping metal or leather plates <b>stitched</b> or <b>riveted</b> together. Shoulder guards and helmets were often used, but leather caps seem to have been more common for ground infantry.|$|R
5|$|Helmets made {{entirely of}} bronze were also used, {{while some of}} them had large cheek guards, {{probably}} <b>stitched</b> or <b>riveted</b> to the helmet, as well as an upper pierced knot to hold a crest. Small holes all around the cheek guards and the helmet's lower edge were used for the attachment of internal padding. Other types of bronze helmets were also used. During the late Mycenaean period, additional types were also used such as horned helmets made of strips of leather.|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{presents}} didactical {{approach and}} strategies, including didactical {{work out of}} foam rubber products suitable for lower elementary school. Foam rubber is relatively new material and is usually available only in specialized shops with products for creative work. That is why teachers rarely include foam rubber in their teaching program, even though it offers wide variety of technical creativity and opportunities for design and construction. In the thesis are presented three most common types of class work out at design and technology class and those are work, construction and project assignment. It is followed with a chapter of appropriateness and usefulness of synthetic materials in schools, with focus on foam rubber (technically is this EVA material, made from foamed polyethylene) and description of tools (scissors, scalpel blade, the ear tag pliers, punches, etc.), accessories and techniques of merging foam rubber (sticking with glues and double sided tape, <b>stitching,</b> <b>riveting,</b> etc.) that we need while making new products. The following chapter describes different options of work out based on celebrating and tradition theme, with pre-made/defines criteria that helps teacher decide with which product the students will reach their learning goal. The thesis presents 14 relevant foam rubber products with a goal to improve learning and teaching of design and technology. Because of its content the thesis targets on lower level elementary school teachers as a didactical manual while making foam rubber products at technical contents in classes of environmental sciences and natural sciences and technique, on technical days, art and technology class or during extra-curricular-activities and extra time activities. As well as for those who enjoy in technical creativity with new materials. Class work with foam rubber gives students many new ideas and develops their technical creativity which brings technique and technology of everyday life even closer to school curriculum. ...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: This study {{investigated}} the joining force of assembled composite beams. Two identical composite laminates made of cross-ply glass/epoxy were joined via various joining techniques such as adhesive bonding, mechanical <b>riveting,</b> <b>stitching</b> joining and combinations of these techniques. The assembled two-laminate composite beams were loaded by four-point bending. The corresponding normal strains were identified by moire in-terferometry. Depending on the joining condition between the laminates, the moire patterns of u-fringes and v-fringes may be continuous or discontinuous across the joining interface. To quantify the joining condition, two analytical models based on the Classical Beam The-ory, the interface model and the interphase model, were presented. The joining forces of the assembled composite beams were identified. Mechanical riveting {{was found to be}} an effi-cient joining technique for assembling the thin composite laminates...|$|R
