40|$|Summary. A {{detailed}} {{investigation of}} the stresses in the early stator blade rows of an axial-flow compressor, which had previously suffered blade failures during its initial performance tests, is described. These vibration tests show that stall cell excitation {{is present in the}} first and second blade rows and causes blade resonances over a fairly wide part-load condition. Resonances of the fundamental flexural modes of first and second row stator blades with the fourth and fifth stall cell harmonics give rise to stress peaks in the region of + 10 to + 20 tons/sq in. The inlet guide row also has a stress peak of about _+ 10 tons/sq in. attributable to excitation associated with the fifth stall cell harmonic. Away from these resonant conditions <b>stalling</b> <b>flutter</b> (of moderate stress) occurs in the first and second stator row blades over about 30 per cent to 70 per cent design speed range, the compressor design being such that these stages are stalled up to about 80 per cent design speed. Under the forced vibration conditions, the blade phasing, in a row, is consistent with anti-phase vibration of adjacent blades indicating the effect of mechanical coupling. Analysis of the initial test conditions indicates agreement between the distribution failures and the number of cycles of high stress probably experienced by the blades. 1. Introduction. Blad...|$|R

40|$|Stall induced {{vibrations}} place fundamental {{limitations on}} a fan stage performance and remains a persistent {{problem in the}} development of axial compressor and fan stages. Rotating stall is purely a fluid mechanic instability, whilst blade <b>flutter,</b> <b>stall</b> and surge <b>flutter,</b> and their variants, are aeroelastic instabilities that involve coupled fluid-structure interaction. Stall oscillation frequency lays in a relatively low-frequency band (less than 0. 7 - 0. 5 shaft frequency), whilst mild surge oscillation frequency occurs usually in a much lower-order of frequency (typically < 0. 25 - 0. 30) in high solidity industrial power fans. These mild surge oscillations can couple with fan blade aeroelastic modes. A loss in efficiency and high aeroelastic blade vibrations characterises fan performance in stall that can significantly increase stress levels in the blade. In this paper, the authors conducted an experimental study to investigate rotating stall recovery patterns in a high solidity axial power fan using different strategies. The authors drove the fan to stall at the design stagger-angle setting and then: i) operated a variable pitch mechanism in order to recover the unstable operation or recover from stall by increasing rotational speed. In both cases the recovery patterns entails the modification of the operating point of the fan along the throttle line of the system. They measured pressure fluctuations in the fan tip region using flush-mounted probes. The authors studied the flow mechanisms for the stall recovery associated with the two proposed methods.

40|$|The {{authors have}} {{attempted}} to develop a theoretical means of determining the amount of aerodynamic damping, positive or negative, existing on a symmetrical airfoil having freedom to oscillate only about an axis parallel to the span and on the zero camber line. Variables considered were oscillating frequency, wind speed, and hinge position (location of axis of oscillation.) Having developed what they considered a proper theoretical criterion for determining the value of aerodynamic damping, the authors have conducted an experimental investigation of an airfoil oscillating system having one degree of freedom, {{in an attempt to}} verify the theoretical criterion. It was concluded that for small oscillations the theoretical values of aerodynamic damping moment are correct except for hinge positions near the leading edge. Contrary to the theory, it was considered that the experimental investigation established the fact that negative damning does not occur for hinge positions at or near the leading edge. A general conclusion was made by the authors that an airfoil oscillating with only one degree of freedom will always have a positive aerodynamic damping moment provided the oscillations are small. It was found that an airfoil restricted to one degree of freedom (rotation) and pivoted about the 0. 75 chord line will flutter when deflected to an amplitude approximating the <b>stall</b> angle. <b>Flutter</b> will be self-induced when the aerodynamic forces are sufficient to deflect the airfoil to the stall angle. ...|$|R
40|$|An {{analytical}} model is developed for predicting {{the onset of}} supersonic <b>stall</b> bending <b>flutter</b> in axial flow compressors. The analysis {{is based on a}} modified two dimensional, compressible, unsteady actuator disk theory. It is applied to a rotor blade row by considering a cascade of airfoils whose geometry and dynamic response coincide with those of a rotor blade element at 85 percent of the span height (measured from the hub). The rotor blades are assumed to be unshrouded (i. e., free standing) and to vibrate in their first flexural mode. The effects of shock waves and flow separation are included in the model through quasi-steady, empirical, rotor total-pressure-loss and deviation-angle correlations. The actuator disk model predicts the unsteady aerodynamic force acting on the cascade blading {{as a function of the}} steady flow field entering the cascade and the geometry and dynamic response of the cascade. Calculations show that the present model predicts the existence of a bending flutter mode at supersonic inlet Mach numbers. This flutter mode is suppressed by increasing the reduced frequency of the system or by reducing the steady state aerodynamic loading on the cascade. The validity of the model for predicting flutter is demonstrated by correlating the measured flutter boundary of a high speed fan stage with its predicted boundary. This correlation uses a level of damping for the blade row (i. e., the log decrement of the rotor system) that is estimated from the experimental flutter data. The predicted flutter boundary is shown to be in good agreement with the measured boundary...|$|R
40|$|The {{steady and}} {{unsteady}} flow characteristics typically vary along {{and across the}} axial compressor stage. This coupled with asymmetric rotor tip clearance that occurs in practice makes flow even more complex. Understanding the complex flow behavior inside the transonic compressor stage will aid in developing flow control devices that are meant for purposes such as improving the rotating <b>stall</b> margin, <b>flutter</b> margin, etc. Here, a detailed time averaged numerical analysis is performed on the single stage transonic axial compressor with averaged rotor tip clearance (1. 75 % of rotor tip axial chord). An attempt is made to study the compressor stall phenomenon. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) helps in resolving the complex flow features involved in a turbomachinery component and at transonic Mach numbers fairly well. Commercial tool ANSYS CFX is used for solving the 3 D compressible Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equation with Shear Stress Transport (SST) turbulence model. Grid independency is carried out for three different mesh size models. All mesh models chosen have fine mesh near wall boundary regions to capture the boundary layer effects. Overall performance maps of the compressor are generated for 50 % to 100 % rated design speeds in steps of 10 % for the chosen optimum grid. Flow variations along the blade annulus are studied for three different operating conditions: choke/free flow, peak efficiency and near stall flow conditions and for different speeds. Flow parameters such as Mach number, static and total pressure variations, etc. are studied at the inlet to rotor, exit to rotor and exit to stator for the various flow conditions and speeds. The boundary layer growth is clearly captured when the flow is throttled from choke/free flow conditions to near stall condition for all the speeds investigated. Mach number variation along blade height clearly shows decrease in Mach number as stall is approached. Blade loading distribution of the rotor at hub, mean and tip sections are clearly captured. Shock motion from around mid-chord region at free flow condition to towards the leading edge at near stall condition is clearly highlighted. Velocity streamlines near the tip section show the complex interaction of the tip leakage and clearance flows. Velocity vectors near the blade tip shows, the backflow near the trailing edge and tendency for leading edge spillage as the back pressure is increased. The flow blockage region is captured in the meridional plot and the motion of vortex core region as stall is approached is demarcated in the of plots. Tangential velocity variation across the annulus for the two flow conditions investigated shows stall initiating from the tip section of the blade as compressor is throttled.

Thrust and power measurements were made for all test conditions.

Stress measurements were made simultaneously to obtain the propeller flutter and bending response. It was found when operating both in the positive and negative thrust regions that, for most cases after the onset of flutter, the magnitude of the flutter stresses at first increased rapidly with section blade angle P, after which further increases in 0 resulted in only a moderate increase or a reduction in stress. Thrust-axis inclination up to the limit of the tests (angle of attack of 15 deg and dynamic pressure of 40 psf) appeared to have no effect on <b>stall</b> <b>flutter.</b> The <b>stall</b> <b>flutter</b> stresses were found to be directly associated with the section thrust characteristics of the blades.

In an attempt to correlate two-dimensional airfoil data with three-dimensional data to predict the stall angle of attack (divergence of the section thrust) of the blade sections, it was found that no consistent correlation could be obtained.

There is a volume [...] "Voyages Litteraires sur les Quais de Paris" [...] (Paris, Durand, 1857), by M. de Fontaine de Resbecq, which might convert the dullest soul to book-hunting. M. de Resbecq and his friends had the most amazing good fortune. A M. N- found six original plays of Moliere (worth perhaps as many hundreds of pounds), bound up with Garth's [...] "Dispensary," [...] an English poem which has long lost its vogue. It is worth while, indeed, to examine all volumes marked [...] "Miscellanea," [...] "Essays," [...] and the like, and treasures may possibly lurk, as Snuffy Davy knew, within the battered sheepskin of school books. Books lie in out of the way places. Poggio rescued [...] "Quintilian" [...] from the counter of a wood merchant. The best time for book-hunting in Paris is the early morning. [...] "The take," [...] as anglers say, is [...] "on" [...] from half-past seven to half-past nine a.m. At these hours the vendors exhibit their fresh wares, and the agents of the more wealthy booksellers come and pick up everything worth having. These agents quite spoil the sport of the amateur. They keep a strict watch on every country dealer's catalogue, snap up all he has worth selling, and sell it over again, charging pounds in place of shillings. But M. de Resbecq vows that he once picked up a copy of the first edition of La Rochefoucauld's [...] "Maxims" [...] out of a box which two booksellers had just searched. The same collector got together very promptly all the original editions of La Bruyere, and he even found a copy of the Elzevir [...] "Pastissier Francais," [...] at the humble price of six sous. Now the [...] " [...] Pastissier Francais," [...] an ill-printed little cookery-book of the Elzevirs, has lately fetched 600 pounds at a sale. The Antiquary's story of Snuffy Davy and the [...] "Game of Chess," [...] is dwarfed by the luck of M. de Resbecq. Not one amateur in a thousand can expect such good fortune. There is, however, a recent instance of a Rugby boy, who picked up, on a <b>stall,</b> a few <b>fluttering</b> leaves hanging together on a flimsy thread. The old woman who kept the stall could hardly be induced to accept the large sum of a shilling for an original quarto of Shakespeare's [...] "King John." [...] These stories are told that none may despair. That none may be over confident, an author may recount his own experience. The only odd trouvaille that ever fell to me was a clean copy of [...] "La Journee Chretienne," [...] with the name of Leon Gambetta, 1844, on its catholic fly-leaf. Rare books grow rarer every day, and often 'tis only Hope that remains at the bottom of the fourpenny boxes. Yet the Paris book-hunters cleave to the game. August is their favourite season; for in August there is least competition. Very few people are, as a rule, in Paris, and these are not tempted to loiter. The bookseller is drowsy, and glad not to have the trouble of chaffering. The English go past, and do not tarry beside a row of dusty boxes of books. The heat threatens the amateur with sunstroke. Then, says M. Octave Uzanne, in a prose ballade of book-hunters--then, calm, glad, heroic, the bouquineurs prowl forth, refreshed with hope. The brown old calf-skin wrinkles in the sun, the leaves crackle, you could poach an egg on the cover of a quarto. The dome of the Institute glitters, the sickly trees seem to wither, their leaves wax red and grey, a faint warm wind is walking the streets. Under his vast umbrella the book-hunter is secure and content; he enjoys the pleasures of the sport unvexed by poachers, and thinks less of the heat than does the deer-stalker on the bare hill-side.|$|R
40|$|Results {{of static}} {{stability}} wind tunnel tests of three 62. 2 cm (24. 5 in) diameter {{models of the}} Prop-Fan are presented. Measurements of blade stresses were made with the Prop-Fans mounted on an isolated nacelle in an open 5. 5 m (18 ft) wind tunnel test section with no tunnel flow. The tests were conducted in the United Technology Research Center Large Subsonic Wind Tunnel. <b>Stall</b> <b>flutter</b> was determined by regions of high stress, which were compared with predictions of boundaries of zero total viscous damping. The structural analysis used beam methods for the model with straight blades and finite element methods for the models with swept blades. Increasing blade sweep tends to suppress <b>stall</b> <b>flutter.</b> Comparisons with similar test data acquired at NASA/Lewis are good. Correlations between measured and predicted critical speeds for all the models are good. The trend of increased stability with increased blade sweep is well predicted. Calculated flutter boundaries generaly coincide with tested boundaries. <b>Stall</b> <b>flutter</b> is predicted {{to occur in the}} third (torsion) mode. The straight blade test shows third mode response, while the swept blades respond in other modes...|$|E
40|$|Due to the {{requirements}} for high blade loading, modern turbo‐machine blades operate {{very close to the}} stall regime. This can lead to flow separation with periodic shedding of vortices, which could lead to self induced oscillations or <b>stall</b> <b>flutter</b> of the blades. Previous studies on <b>stall</b> <b>flutter</b> have focused on flows at high Reynolds number (Re ~ 106). The Reynolds numbers for fans/propellers of Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs), high altitude turbofans and small wind turbines are substantially lower (Re < 105). Aerodynamic characteristics of flows at such low Re is significantly different from those at high Re, {{due in part to the}} early separation of the flow and possible formation of laminar separation bubbles (LSB). The present study is targeted towards study of <b>stall</b> <b>flutter</b> in a cascade of blades at low Re. We experimentally study <b>stall</b> <b>flutter</b> of a cascade of symmetric NACA 0012 blades at low Reynolds number (Re ~ 30, 000) through forced sinusoidal pitching of the blades about mean angles of incidences close to stall. The experimental arrangement permits variations of the inter‐blade phase (σ) in addition to the oscillation frequency (f) and amplitude; the inter‐blade phase angle (σ) being the phase difference between the motions of adjacent blades in the cascade. The unsteady moments on the central blade in the cascade are directly measured, and used to calculate the energy transfer from the flow to the blade. This energy transfer is used to predict the propensity of the blades to undergo self‐induced oscillations or <b>stall</b> <b>flutter.</b> Experiments are also conducted on an isolated blade in addition to the cascade. A variety of parameters can influence <b>stall</b> <b>flutter</b> in a cascade, namely the oscillation frequency (f), the mean angle of incidence, and the inter‐blade phase angle (σ). The measurements show that there exists a range of reduced frequencies, k (=πfc/U, c being the chord length of the blade and U being the free stream velocity), where the energy transfer from the flow to the blade is positive, which indicates that the flow can excite the blade. Above and below this range, the energy transfer is negative indicating that blade excitations, if any, will get damped. This range of excitation is found to depend upon the mean angle of incidence, with shifts towards higher values of k as the mean angle of incidence increases. An important parameter for cascades, which is absent in the isolated blade case is the inter‐blade phase angle (σ). An excitation regime is observed only for σ values between ‐ 450 and 900, with the value of excitation being maximum for σ of 900. Time traces of the measured moment were found to be non‐sinusoidal in the excitation regime, whereas they appear to be sinusoidal in the damping regime. <b>Stall</b> <b>flutter</b> in a cascade has differences when compared with an isolated blade. For the cascade, the maximum value of excitation (positive energy transfer) is found to be an order of magnitude lower compared to the isolated blade case. Further, for similar values of mean incidence angle, the range of excitation is at lower reduced frequencies for a cascade when compared with an isolated blade. A comparison with un‐stalled or classical flutter in a cascade at high Re, shows that the inter‐blade phase angle is a major factor governing flutter in both cases. Some differences are observed as well, which appear to be due to stalled flow and low Re...|$|E
