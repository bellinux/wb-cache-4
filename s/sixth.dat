5|$|Arches 4 and 6 {{produce the}} {{laryngeal}} cartilages. The nerve of the <b>sixth</b> arch becomes the recurrent laryngeal nerve. The nerve {{of the fourth}} arch {{gives rise to the}} superior laryngeal nerve. The arteries of the fourth arch, which project between the nerves of the fourth and <b>sixth</b> arches, become the left-sided arch of the aorta and the right subclavian artery. The arteries of the <b>sixth</b> arch persists as the ductus arteriosus on the left, and is obliterated on the right.|$|E
50|$|Two regular-tunings {{based on}} <b>sixths,</b> having {{intervals}} of minor <b>sixths</b> (eight semitones) and of major <b>sixths</b> (nine semitones), have received scholarly discussion. The chord charts for minor-sixths tuning {{are useful for}} left-handed guitarists playing in major-thirds tuning; the chord charts for major-sixths tuning, for left-handed guitarists playing in minor-thirds tuning.|$|R
50|$|These {{intervals}} are {{all within}} about 12 cents {{of each other}} and are difficult for most people to distinguish. Neutral <b>sixths</b> are roughly a quarter tone sharp from 12 equal temperament minor <b>sixths</b> and a quarter tone flat from 12-ET major <b>sixths.</b> In just intonation, as well as in tunings such as 31-ET, 41-ET, or 72-ET, which more closely approximate just intonation, the intervals are closer together.|$|R

5|$|In {{addition}} to connecting the BMT Nassau Street and IND <b>Sixth</b> Avenue Lines, {{as well as}} the <b>Sixth</b> Avenue Line to the Manhattan Bridge, the Chrystie Street Connection {{is one of the few}} completed sections of the SAS. The Grand Street station was built to serve as a transfer point between the <b>Sixth</b> Avenue and Second Avenue lines. The connection was built this way because the original 1960s plans for the SAS had Second Avenue and <b>Sixth</b> Avenue Line trains sharing two island platforms in a four-track layout, with connections from the Second Avenue Line to the <b>Sixth</b> Avenue Line and the Manhattan Bridge. Because Second Avenue Subway construction was halted in 1975, this station has only served <b>Sixth</b> Avenue Line trains since its opening. As part of the contemporary Second Avenue Subway construction, a new station is planned for construction below the current station during the fourth and final phase of the project; Phase 1 of the project on the Upper East Side opened on January 1, 2017, with Phase 2 in planning and two other phases with no funding commitments.|$|E
5|$|Kim Raver, who {{was cast}} as {{recurring}} character Dr. Teddy Altman in the <b>sixth</b> season, was given star billing {{later in the}} season.

50|$|One-handed double glissandi are {{sometimes}} executed at intervals {{other than an}} octave, the most common being <b>sixths.</b> Franz Liszt's piano transcription of Hector Berlioz's Symphonie fantastique contains, in an ossia (optional replacement measure) in the finale, a glissando in <b>sixths</b> played upward with the right hand. The Alborada del gracioso from Maurice Ravel's Miroirs contains glissandi in thirds and fourths in one hand.|$|R
50|$|Étude Op. 25, No. 8, in D-flat major, is a {{technical}} piano study composed by Frédéric Chopin. This etude is composed with <b>sixths</b> being played in both hands. The technical skill required {{to play it}} makes this etude {{one of the most}} difficult in Op.25. Its unusual sound is due to the uninterrupted succession of ascending, descending and chromatic <b>sixths.</b>|$|R

5|$|The Judd School <b>sixth</b> form {{can be said}} to {{have been}} {{established}} as early as 1903in the wake of the Education Act of 1902when the Pupil Teachers Scheme was born and The Judd School was used a training centre for young teachers. However, normal pupils above the age of 16 were not permitted until 1919; previously special permission from the governors was required to stay on beyond this age. A 1952 government inspection stated that 42 students were in the <b>sixth</b> form. Judd's <b>sixth</b> form has significantly grown over the last decade, consisting of 308 students at the last Ofsted inspection in 2007. A minimum of 40 offers per year will be made to external applicants; girls are admitted in Year Twelve (aged 16) and make up about 16 percent of the <b>sixth</b> form. The <b>sixth</b> form has its own Common Room in the main school building, including a dedicated cafeteria and study area.|$|E

Other common update content includes thematic fights against specific villains, such as Jack O'Lantern, Hydro-Man, and Silver Sable. The <b>sixth</b> improved objective counters for events, while the seventh added short mission-style events.
