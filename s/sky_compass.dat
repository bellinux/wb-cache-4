40|$|The present {{investigation}} {{was aimed at}} testing whether the lizard <b>sky</b> polarization <b>compass</b> is time compensated. For this purpose, ruin lizards, Podarcis sicula, were both trained and tested for orientation inside a Morris water maze under clear skies with the sun not in view. During training, lizards showed a striking bimodal orientation along the training axis, demonstrating their capability of determining the symmetry plane of the sky polarization pattern and thus the use of polarization information in orientation. After reaching criteria, lizards were kept 7 days in a 6 -h fast clock-shift treatment and then released with the sun not in view. Six-hour clock-shifted lizards showed a bimodal distribution of directional choices, which was oriented perpendicularly to the training axis, as it was expected {{on the basis of}} the clock-shift. The results show that the only celestial diurnal compass mechanism that does not need a direct vision of the sun disk (i. e., the <b>sky</b> polarization <b>compass)</b> is a time-compensated compass...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} first {{examined}} whether ruin lizards Podarcis sicula {{are able to}} orientate using the e-vector direction of polarized light. Ruin lizards were trained and tested indoors, inside a hexagonal Morris water maze, positioned under an artificial light source producing plane polarized light with a single e-vector, which provided an axial cue. Lizards were subjected to axial training by positioning two identical goals {{in contact with the}} centre of two opposite side walls of the Morris water maze. Goals were invisible because they were placed just beneath the water surface, and water was rendered opaque. The results showed that the directional choices of lizards meeting learning criteria were bimodally distributed along the training axis, and that after 90 deg rotation of the e-vector direction of polarized light the lizards directional choices rotated correspondingly, producing a bimodal distribution which was perpendicular to the training axis. The present results confirm in ruin lizards results previously obtained in other lizard species showing that these reptiles can use the e-vector direction of polarized light {{in the form of a}} <b>sky</b> polarization <b>compass.</b> The second step of the study aimed at answering the still open question of whether functioning of a <b>sky</b> polarization <b>compass</b> would be mediated by the lizard parietal eye. To test this, ruin lizards meeting learning criteria were tested inside the Morris water maze under polarized light after their parietal eyes were painted black. Lizards with black-painted parietal eyes were completely disoriented.

40|$|My PhD {{research}} activity {{focused on the}} investigation of the role of polarized light in the directional orientation of the lacertid lizard Podarcis sicula. In particular, the aim of this work was to systematically analyze P. sicula orientation behaviour and to lay the foundation for future electrophysiological and molecular investigations of anatomical structures assigned to sky polarization perception. Another goal was to understand the evolutionary meaning of these structures and the mechanisms of polarization perception. For this purpose, the first experimental section (EXPERIMENT 1 : Beltrami et al., 2010) examined whether ruin lizards P. sicula are able to orientate using the E-vector direction of polarized light. Lizard orientation was tested indoors, under an artificial light source: this device produced plane polarized light with a single E-vector, that provided an axial cue. These results showed that lizards can learn a training axis and that after 90 ° rotation of the E-vector direction of polarized light the lizards’ directional choices rotated correspondingly. The following step of the study aimed at elucidating whether the functioning of a <b>sky</b> polarization <b>compass</b> would be mediated by the lizard parietal eye. To test this, ruin lizards that met learning criteria were tested under polarized light after their parietal eyes were painted black. Lizards with black-painted parietal eyes were completely disoriented. These data showed {{for the first time that}} the parietal eye plays a central role in mediating the functioning of a putative <b>sky</b> polarization <b>compass</b> of lizards. Furthermore, the experimental apparatus used in this experiment emitted light that did not include wavelengths in the UV range. Thus, the UV range is not necessary for perceiving polarized light in ruin lizards, unlike other species as, for example, honey bees and desert ants that in the absence of UV are unable to use a <b>sky</b> polarization <b>compass.</b> That being so, the second experimental part (EXPERIMENT 2) was aimed at testing whether there is a preferential region of the light spectrum to perceive the E-vector direction of polarized light. The results showed that lizards can learn a training direction when trained under white light produced by an LCD and E-vector parallel to the training axis. Lizards that met the learning criteria were then tested under white light and E-vector perpendicular to the training axis, just to validate the new LCD equipment: as expected, lizards followed a 90 ° rotation of the Evector direction, confirming once again that they can use the polarized light for orientation. Thereafter, lizards were tested under coloured polarized light (blue, green, red and turquoise), initially with E-vector parallel to the training axis and then with E-vector perpendicular to the training axis, to examine whether P. sicula can perceive polarized light of a particular wavelength range and use it in orientation. Under both blue light and turquoise light lizards were able to orient in both E-vector’s conditions, otherwise under red light lizards were completely disoriented; under green light lizards were able to orient themselves only when the direction of the E-vector was the same as in training, whereas after a 90 ° rotation of the E-vector lizards were disoriented, in both spectral radiance level (high and low). Incorrect orientation after E-vector rotation under Green light was independent of (high or low) spectral radiance and one hypothesis to interpret these data is that the green stimuli could be barely discernible. These results, combined with the data under Green light previously discussed, demonstrate that the blue-turquoise part of the light spectrum is crucial for a correct functioning of <b>sky</b> polarization <b>compass,</b> whereas red wavelengths do not mediate perception of the E-vector. The third experimental section (EXPERIMENT 3) was performed outdoors. The first part of this experiment was aimed to validate the new set-up outdoors. Inside the experimental apparatus lizards had only the sky polarization pattern available for orientation. As expected, the results demonstrated that lizards can learn a training direction and the new set-up is well suited to investigate orientation mechanisms in lizards. The second part of this experiment was aimed at testing the time-compensated nature of the <b>sky</b> polarization <b>compass.</b> The results demonstrated that lizards can learn a training direction under blue sky with no sun’s disc, but surprisingly, they cannot retain the spatial information. Indeed, after 6 days without training, both control group and fast-shifted group, were disorientated. A possibility is that some aspects of the information necessary for the normal functioning of the <b>sky</b> polarization <b>compass</b> is not retained for a week with no training. Alternatively, it is possible that the <b>sky</b> polarization <b>compass</b> needs to be recalibrated almost daily by external cues, such as exposure of the lizards to the sun’s disc. Clearly, other explanations are possible, and further experiments outdoors are necessary to answer this important question. Results relating to my three year of PhD course show the way forward to new interesting questions and so to new possible experimental applications to finally clarify the evolutionary role of the <b>sky</b> polarization <b>compass</b> and its interactions with other orientation mechanisms (for example the sun compass or the magnetic compass). It should be very interesting to deepen the knowledge of the nature of the sky polarization pattern’s information, to elucidate the time-compensated mechanisms that set the information retention...|$|R

40|$|Honeybees {{are known}} for their ability to use the sun’s azimuth and the sky’s {{polarization}} pattern for spatial orientation. <b>Sky</b> <b>compass</b> orientation in bees has been extensively stud-ied at the behavioral level but our knowledge about the underlying neuronal systems and mechanisms is very limited. Electrophysiological studies in other insect species suggest that neurons of the <b>sky</b> <b>compass</b> system integrate information about the polarization pattern of the sky, its chromatic gradient, and the azimuth of the sun. In order to obtain a stable directional signal throughout the day, circadian changes between the sky polarization pat-tern and the solar azimuth must be compensated. Likewise, the systemmust be modulated in a context specific way to compensate for changes in intensity, polarization and chromatic properties of light caused by clouds, vegetation and landscape. The goal {{of this study was to}} identify neurons of the <b>sky</b> <b>compass</b> pathway in the honeybee brain and to find potential sites of circadian and neuromodulatory input into this pathway.

40|$|Mass {{migration}} of desert locusts {{is a common}} phenomenon in North Africa and the Middle East but how these insects navigate is still poorly understood. Laboratory studies suggest that locusts are able to exploit the sky polarization pattern as a navigational cue. Like other insects locusts detect polarized light through a specialized dorsal rim area (DRA) of the eye. Polarization signals are transmitted through the optic lobe to the anterior optic tubercle (AOTu) and, finally, to the central complex in the brain. Whereas neurons of the AOTu integrate sky polarization and chromatic cues in a daytime dependent manner, the central complex holds a topographic representation of azimuthal directions suggesting a role as an internal <b>sky</b> <b>compass.</b> To understand further the integration of <b>sky</b> <b>compass</b> cues we studied polarization-sensitive (POL) neurons in the medulla that may be intercalated between DRA photoreceptors and AOTu neurons. Five types of POL-neuron were characterized and four of these in multiple recordings. All neurons had wide arborizations in medulla layer 4 and most, additionally, in the dorsal rim area of the medulla and in the accessory medulla, the presumed circadian clock. The neurons showed type-specific orientational tuning to zenithal polarized light and azimuth tuning to unpolarized green and UV light spots. In contrast to neurons of the AOTu, we found no evidence for color opponency and daytime dependent adjustment of <b>sky</b> <b>compass</b> signals. Therefore, medulla layer 4 is a distinct stage in the integration of <b>sky</b> <b>compass</b> signals that precedes the time-compensated integration of celestial cues in the AOTu...|$|E
40|$|It {{has long}} been known that bees can use the pattern of {{polarized}} light in the <b>sky</b> as a <b>compass</b> cue even if they can see {{only a small part of}} the whole pattern. How they solve this problem has remained enigmatic. Here we show that the bees rely on a generalized celestial map that is used invariably throughout the day. We reconstruct this map by analyzing the navigation errors made by bees to which single e-vectors are displayed. In addition, we demonstrate how the bee's celestial map can be derived from the e-vector patterns in the sky...|$|R

40|$|Locusts are {{long-range}} migratory insects. At high population density, immature animals form marching hopper bands while adults {{take off}} and form huge swarms of millions of animals. At low population densities animals are solitarious, but likewise migrate, mostly during the night. Numerous studies aimed at predicting locust infestations showed that migrations both as hopper bands and as adults are largely downwind following seasonal shifts of the tropical convergence zone taking the animals to areas of rainfall. Only a few studies provided evidence for active orientation mechanisms, including the involvement of a sun compass. This scarcity of evidence stands in contrast to recent neurobiological data showing sophisticated neuronal adaptations suited for <b>sky</b> <b>compass</b> navigation. These include a special dorsal eye region with photoreceptors suited to analyze the polarization pattern {{of the sky and}} a system of topographically arranged <b>sky</b> <b>compass</b> neurons in the central complex of the brain. Laboratory experiments, moreover, demonstrated polarotaxis in tethered flying animals. The discrepancy of these findings call for more rigorous field studies on active orientation mechanisms in locusts.

40|$|Animals {{relying on}} a {{celestial}} compass for spatial orientation may use {{the position of the}} sun, the chromatic or intensity gradient of the sky, the polarization pattern of the sky, or a combination of these cues as compass signals. Behavioral experiments in bees and ants, indeed, showed that direct sunlight and sky polarization play a role in <b>sky</b> <b>compass</b> orientation, but the relative importance of these cues are species-specific. Intracellular recordings from polarization-sensitive interneurons in the desert locust and monarch butterfly suggest that inputs from different eye regions, including polarized-light input through the dorsal rim area of the eye and chromatic/intensity gradient input from the main eye, are combined {{at the level of the}} medulla to create a robust compass signal. Conflicting input from the polarization and chromatic/intensity channel, resulting from eccentric receptive fields, is eliminated at the level of the anterior optic tubercle and central complex through internal compensation for changing solar elevations, which requires input from a circadian clock. Across several species, the central complex likely serves as an internal <b>sky</b> <b>compass,</b> combining E-vector information with other celestial cues.

Solitary foraging ant species can employ an array of navigational tools to successfully return to the nest from foraging trips, including path integration and vision-based navigation. Species inhabiting cluttered environments that are visually rich, like Melophorus bagoti and multiple Myrmecia species, rely heavily on cues from these visual landmarks and the surrounding panorama. Additionally, these ant species can utilise the <b>sky</b> <b>compass</b> to orient by detecting both the sun’s position and the sky’s UV and polarised light gradients. Multiple characteristics of landmarks, the surrounding panorama and the <b>sky</b> <b>compass</b> cannot be realistically manipulated in the natural environment but can be readily manipulated by using a virtual reality (VR) environment under laboratory conditions. Here we present a novel virtual reality system that projects a visual panorama using commercially available projectors. This system provides a 300 ° visual panorama and includes a spherical treadmill system to record the individual’s movement and orientation. We present a thorough description of the virtual reality system and demonstrate the system’s performance by comparing the orientation in the virtual reality system and the natural environment. Individuals in virtual reality conditions did not orient towards the nest, suggesting the VR system is missing some crucial component for navigation.

The accuracy of CtlgM proper motions, at about 0. 3 - 0. 5 mas yr− 1 for well-measured stars, permits an excellent segregation between the cluster and field stars. The vector-point diagram of proper motions indicates an estimated total of ∼ 165 cluster members among the stars in our sample, while 314 stars with σμ < 2. 5 mas yr− 1 have membership probabilities Pμ≥ 1 per cent. We also explored the astrometric potential of the Catalogue of Objects and Measured Parameters from All <b>Sky</b> Surveys (<b>COMPASS)</b> data base in order to obtain additional proper motions for fainter stars {{in the area of}} Blanco 1.

40|$|Migrating desert locusts, Schistocerca gregaria, {{are able}} to use the {{skylight}} polarization pattern for navigation. They detect polarized light with a specialized dorsal rim area in their compound eye. After multistage processing, polarization signals are transferred to the central complex, a midline-spanning brain area involved in locomotor control. Polarization-sensitive tangential neurons (TB-neurons) of the protocerebral bridge, a part of the central complex, give rise to a topographic arrangement of preferred polarization angles in the bridge, suggesting that the central complex acts as an internal <b>sky</b> <b>compass.</b> TB-neurons connect the protocerebral bridge with two adjacent brain areas, the posterior optic tubercles. To analyze the polarotopic organization of the central complex further, we investigated the number and morphologies of TB-neurons and the presence and colocalization of three neuroactive substances in these neurons. Triple immunostaining with antisera against Diploptera punctata allatostatin (Dip-AST), Manduca sexta allatotropin (Mas-AT), and serotonin (5 HT) raised in the same host species revealed three spatially distinct TB-neuron clusters, each consisting of 10 neurons per hemisphere: cluster 1 and 3 showed Dip-AST/ 5 HT immunostaining, whereas cluster 2 showed Dip-AST/Mas-AT immunostaining. Five subtypes of TB-neuron could be distinguished based on ramification patterns. Corresponding to ramification domains in the protocerebral bridge, the neurons invaded distinct but overlapping layers within the posterior optic tubercle. Similarly, neurons interconnecting the tubercles of the two hemispheres also targeted distinct layers of these neuropils. From these data we propose a neuronal circuit that may be suited to stabilize the internal <b>sky</b> <b>compass</b> in the central complex of the locus...|$|E
40|$|The central {{complex of}} the insect brain {{comprises}} {{a group of}} neuropils involved in spatial orientation and memory. In fruit flies it mediates place learning based on visual landmarks and houses neurons that encode the orientation for goal-directed locomotion, based on landmarks and self-motion cues for angular path-integration. In desert locusts, the central complex holds a compass-like representation of head directions, based on the polarization pattern of skylight. Through intracellular recordings from immobilized locusts, we investigated whether <b>sky</b> <b>compass</b> neurons of the central complex also represent the position or any salient feature of possible landmarks, in analogy to the observations in flies. Neurons showed strongest responses to the novel appearance of a small moving square, but we found no evidence for a topographic representation of object positions. Responses to an individual square were independent of direction of motion and trajectory, but showed rapid adaptation to successive stimulation, unaffected by changing the direction of motion. Responses reappeared, however, if the moving object changed its trajectory or if it suddenly reversed moving direction against the movement of similar objects {{that make up a}} coherent background-flow as induced by ego-motion. Response amplitudes co-varied with the precedent state of dynamic background activity, a phenomenon that has been related to attention-dependent saliency coding in neurons of the mammalian primary visual cortex. The data show that neurons of the central complex of the locust brain are visually bimodal, signaling <b>sky</b> <b>compass</b> direction and the novelty character of moving objects. These response properties might serve to attune compass-aided locomotor control to unexpected events in the environment. The difference to data obtained in fruit flies might relate to differences in the lifestyle of landmark learners (fly) and compass navigators (locust), point to the existence of parallel networks for the two orientation strategies, or reflect differences in experimental conditions...|$|E
40|$|Although insect {{brains are}} small in {{comparison}} to those of vertebrates, some species show astonishing navigational abilities. Desert locusts (Schistocerca gregaria) are well-known for forming huge swarms consisting of millions of animals and their long-range migrations throughout North Africa and the Middle East. Experiments on tethered flying locusts showed that the animals respond with a 180 °-periodicity of yaw-torque to a dorsally rotating polarizer. This suggests that locusts are able to use celestial polarized light as navigational cue during spatial orientation and navigation. A number of recent studies have explored the neural basis of <b>sky</b> <b>compass</b> orientation in locusts {{by focusing on the}} processing of polarized light signals in the brain. In contrast, (1) the mechanisms of compensation for changes of solar position {{over the course of the}} day and (2) the integration of different signals from the sky (polarization pattern, solar position, chromatic gradient) are poorly understood, particularly at the level of the optic lobe. Finally, (3) no data exist comparing the <b>sky</b> <b>compass</b> system in diurnal gregarious locusts with that of nocturnal solitarious locusts. Towards these goals, polarization-sensitive neurons at different levels of the polarization vision pathway were analyzed physiologically through intracellular recordings and anatomically by means of detailed three-dimensional reconstructions of neuronal arborizations. First, neurons of the medulla in the optic lobe were analyzed and characterized to understand the combination and integration of <b>sky</b> <b>compass</b> information in the locust brain. These experiments showed that neurons of a distinct layer of the medulla (layer 4) integrate polarized light information from the dorsal rim area of the compound eye in the locust brain. In addition, all polarization-sensitive neurons responded also to an unpolarized green/UV light spots that moved around the locust head. Taken together, this chapter shows that neurons of medulla layer 4 combine polarized light information of the sky with azimuth-dependent unpolarized light input that might represent celestial chromatic contrast information. In the next chapter, receptive field properties and responses of neurons to different light intensity conditions were studied. These investigations focused on neurons of the anterior optic tubercle – the next processing stage of the polarization pathway – and compared the physiology of these neurons in gregarious and solitarious locusts. The data showed that both locust phases rely on the same sky navigation system, although they have strikingly different life styles. The experiments revealed novel aspects of the response characteristics of intertubercle neurons and a possible modulatory role of the LoTu 1 neuron in the anterior optic tubercle in both locust phases. In the third chapter, evidence for a second polarization vision pathway in the brain is presented. This pathway connects the dorsal rim area of the medullae via the accessory medullae to the central complex and might provide time-compensated polarized light signals to the central complex. Finally, chapter four presents a standardized three-dimensional atlas of the central complex and reveals a possible connection between a particular type of polarization-sensitive columnar neuron and a neuron that is modulated during flight. This chapter illustrates how the polarization-vision network of the central complex might be modulated in a context-dependent manner...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} first {{examined}} whether ruin lizards, Podarcis sicula, {{are able to}} orientate using plane-polarized light produced by an LCD screen. Ruin lizards were trained and tested indoors, inside a hexagonal Morris water maze positioned under an LCD screen producing white polarized light with a single E-vector, which provided an axial cue. White polarized light did not include wavelengths in the UV. Lizards orientated correctly either when tested with E-vector parallel to the training axis or after 90 deg rotation of the E-vector direction, thus validating the apparatus. Further experiments examined {{whether there is a}} preferential region of the light spectrum to perceive the E-vector direction of polarized light. For this purpose, lizards reaching learning criteria under white polarized light were subdivided into four experimental groups. Each group was tested for orientation under a different spectrum of plane-polarized light (red, green, cyan and blue) with equalized photon flux density. Lizards tested under blue polarized light orientated correctly, whereas lizards tested under red polarized light were completely disoriented. Green polarized light was barely discernible by lizards, and thus insufficient for a correct functioning of their compass. When exposed to cyan polarized light, lizard orientation performances were optimal, indistinguishable from lizards detecting blue polarized light. Overall, the present results demonstrate that perception of linear polarization in the blue is necessary – and sufficient – for a proper functioning of the <b>sky</b> polarization <b>compass</b> of ruin lizards. This may be adaptively important, as detection of polarized light in the blue improves functioning of the polarization <b>compass</b> under cloudy <b>skies,</b> i. e. when the alternative celestial compass based on detection of the sun disk is rendered useless because the sun is obscured by clouds...|$|R
40|$|Many insects use the {{polarization}} {{pattern of the}} <b>sky</b> for obtaining <b>compass</b> information during orientation or navigation. E-vector information is collected by a specialized area in the dorsal-most part of the compound eye, the dorsal rim area (DRA). We tested honeybees' capability of learning certain e-vector orientations by using a classical conditioning paradigm with the proboscis extension reflex. When one e-vector orientation (CS+) was associated with sugar water (US), while another orientation (CS-) was not rewarded, the honeybees could discriminate CS+ from CS-. Bees, whose DRA was inactivated by painting, did not learn CS+. When ultraviolet polarized light (350 nm) was used for CS, the bees discriminated CS+ from CS-, but no discrimination was observed in blue (442 nm) or green light (546 nm). Our data indicate that honeybees can learn and discriminate between different e-vector orientations, sensed by the UV receptors of the DRA, suggesting that bees can determine their flight direction from polarized UV skylight during foraging. Fixing the bees' heads during the experiments did not prevent learning, indicating that they use an "instantaneous" algorithm of e-vector detection; i. e. the bees {{do not need to}} actively scan the sky with their DRAs ("sequential" method) to determine e-vector orientation...|$|R
40|$|Although it {{is widely}} {{accepted}} that honeybees use the polarized-light pattern of the <b>sky</b> as a <b>compass</b> for navigation, there is little direct evidence that this information is actually sensed during flight. Here, we ask whether flying bees can obtain compass cues derived purely from polarized light, and communicate this information to their nest-mates through the 2 ̆ 7 waggle dance 2 ̆ 7. Bees, from an observation hive with vertically oriented honeycombs, were trained to fly to a food source {{at the end of}} a tunnel, which provided overhead illumination that was polarized either parallel to the axis of the tunnel, or perpendicular to it. When the illumination was transversely polarized, bees danced in a predominantly vertical direction with waggles occurring equally frequently in the upward or the downward direction. They were thus using the polarized-light information to signal the two possible directions in which they could have flown in natural outdoor flight: either directly towards the sun, or directly away from it. When the illumination was axially polarized, the bees danced in a predominantly horizontal direction with waggles directed either to the left or the right, indicating that they could have flown in an azimuthal direction that was 90 ° to the right or to the left of the sun, respectively. When the first half of the tunnel provided axial illumination and the second half transverse illumination, bees danced along all of the four principal diagonal directions, which represent four equally likely locations of the food source based on the polarized-light information that they had acquired during their journey. We conclude that flying bees are capable of obtaining and signalling compass information that is derived purely from polarized light. Furthermore, they deal with the directional ambiguity that is inherent in polarized light by signalling all of the possible locations of the food source in their dances, thus maximizing the chances of recruitment to it...|$|R

In addition to the Sun, insects also exploit the polarization pattern and chromatic gradient of the sky for estimating navigational directions. Analysis of polarization-vision pathways in locusts and crickets has shed first light on brain areas involved in <b>sky</b> <b>compass</b> orientation. Detection of sky polarization relies on specialized photoreceptor cells in a small dorsal rim area of the compound eye. Brain areas involved in polarization processing include parts of the lamina, medulla and lobula of the optic lobe and, in the central brain, the anterior optic tubercle, the lateral accessory lobe and the central complex. In the optic lobe, polarization sensitivity and contrast are enhanced through convergence and opponency. In the anterior optic tubercle, polarized-light signals are integrated with information on the chromatic contrast of the sky. Tubercle neurons combine responses to the UV/green contrast and e-vector orientation {{of the sky and}} compensate for diurnal changes of the celestial polarization pattern associated with changes in solar elevation. In the central complex, a topographic representation of e-vector tunings underlies the columnar organization and suggests that this brain area serves as an internal compass coding for spatial directions...|$|E
40|$|The {{polarization}} {{pattern of}} the blue sky serves as an important reference for spatial orientation in insects. To understand the neural mechanisms involved in <b>sky</b> <b>compass</b> orientation we have analyzed the polarization vision system in the locust Schistocercagregaria. As in other insects, photoreceptors adapted {{for the detection of}} sky polarization are concentrated in a dorsal rim area (DRA) of the compound eye. Stationary flying locusts show polarotactic yaw-torque responses when illuminated through a rotating polarizer from above. This response is abolished after painting the DRAs. Central stages of the polarization vision system, revealed through tracing studies, include dorsal areas in the lamina and medulla, the anterior lobe of the lobula, the anterior optic tubercle, the lateral accessory lobe, and the central complex. Physiological analysis of polarization-sensitive (POL) neurons has focussed on the optic tubercle and on the central complex. Each POL neuron was maximally excited at a certain e-vector (F max) and was maximally inhibited at an e-vector perpendicular to F max. The neurons had large visual fields, and many neurons received input from both eyes. The neuronal organization of the central complex suggests a role as an spatial compass within the locust brain...|$|E
40|$|When {{performing}} foraging trips desert ants of {{the genus}} Cataglyphis continuously process and update a;home vector' {{that enables them to}} return to their nest on the shortest route. This capacity of path integration requires two types of information: (i) information about the travelling directions, and (ii) odometric information about the distances travelled in a particular direction. We have investigated how these two necessary pieces of information interact within the path integration processor. The specific question is: how do the ants process distance information if there is no simultaneous input from the <b>sky</b> <b>compass</b> available. Ants were trained to forage in a;Z'-shaped channel system, the three segments of which joined at right angles. Individual animals were transferred from the feeder to a test field where their homing paths could be observed. In the crucial tests the middle segment of the maze was covered by orange Perspex that did not transmit the UV part of the spectrum, and thus precluded the perception of polarization patterns. Changes of the ant's processing of odometric information within this channel segment directly translate into a change in homing direction on the test field. The results indicate that the odometric information about travelling distance is largely ignored for path integration if there is no simultaneous input from the sky-view-based compass. They further show that idiothetic information cannot adequately substitute for the polarization compass to infer travelling directions...|$|E
40|$|The central {{complex is}} a group of neuropils {{in the center of the}} insect brain. It {{consists}} of four major subunits: the upper and lower divisions of the central body (CBU, CBL), the protocerebral bridge (PB), and the paired noduli. A distinctive feature of the central complex is a modular architecture characterized by rows of 16 columns, intersected in the central body by stacks of layers. Evidence from locusts suggests that the central complex plays a major role in <b>sky</b> <b>compass</b> orientation. To understand signal processing in this brain area further, we have analyzed the morphologies of columnar neurons of the central complex of the locust Schistocerca gregaria. Intracellular dye fills revealed 21 types of columnar neurons that connect columns of different subunits, three types of pontine neurons linking pairs of columns within the CBU, and one amacrine cell. Most neurons appeared to be part of isomorphic sets with cell type-specific heterolateral projection patterns. Evaluation of arborization areas and neuron polarity suggests that these neurons are either intrinsic to the central complex or provide output to the lateral accessory lobes (LALs) or anterior lip region. No direct connections were found between the CBU and CBL. Instead, neurons of either subdivision were connected with the PB, but projected to non-overlapping regions in the LALs and to different layers of the noduli. This study provides novel insights into the functional organization of the central complex, especially with respect to its likely role in right-left signal matching and decision making...|$|E
40|$|Papilio {{butterflies}} depend highly on {{visual information}} in their flower-foraging behavior. The retina of Papilio xuthus {{has been studied}} well, whereas the visual system in the brain is poorly understood. By investigating outputs from the optic lobe to the central brain, {{we found that the}} mushroom body of P. xuthus receives prominent direct inputs from the optic lobe in addition to olfactory inputs. The mushroom body consists of three components: the calyx, the pedunculus, and the lobes. The calyx is further subdivided into two cup-shaped primary calyces and an accessory calyx. Each primary calyx consists of three concentric subareas, the inner zone, the outer zone, and the rim of the outer zone. Dextran injections into the optic lobe, the calyx, or the antennal lobe revealed three visual inputs and one olfactory input into the calyx. The visual inputs originate from the medulla, the lobula, and a newly identified neuropil, the ventral lobe of the lobula. All visual inputs first innervate the accessory calyx, and the two lobula inputs further spread their processes through the inner zone and the rim of the outer zone of the primary calyces. Visual inputs from the medulla and the ventral lobe of the lobula collect light information from ventral eye regions, suggesting a role in visual target detection rather than <b>sky</b> <b>compass</b> orientation. In contrast to visual inputs, olfactory inputs innervate only the calycal outer zone. The multisensory inputs to the mushroom bodies in P. xuthus are probably related to their flower-foraging behavior...|$|E
40|$|Polarized {{light is}} a key feature of the blue sky, used by many animals as a sensory cue for compass navigation. Like other insects, locusts {{perceive}} the E-vector orientation of polarized light with a specialized region of their compound eye, the dorsal rim area. Neurons in the brain relay this information through several processing stages to the central complex. The central complex has a modular neuroarchitecture, composed of vertical columns and horizontal layers. Several types of central-complex neurons respond to dorsally presented, rotating E-vectors with tonic modulation of their firing frequency. These neurons were found at the input stage of the central complex, as well as near the proposed output stage, where neurons are tuned to form a compass-like representation of E-vector orientations underlying the columnar organization of the central complex. To identify neurons suited to link input and output elements, we recorded intracellularly from 45 neurons of the central complex. We report several novel types of polarization-sensitive neurons. One of these is suited {{to fill the gap}} between input and output stages of the central-complex polarization vision network. Three types of neurons were sensitive to polarized light in only 50 % of experiments suggesting that they are recruited to the network depending on behavioral context. Finally, we identified two types of neurons suited to transfer information toward thoracic motor circuits. The data underscore the key role of two subunits of the central complex, the lower division of the central body and the protocerebral bridge, in <b>sky</b> <b>compass</b> orientation...|$|E
40|$|Magnetoreception of the light-dependent {{magnetic}} compass in birds is suggested to be mediated by a radical-pair mechanism {{taking place in}} the avian retina. Biophysical models on magnetic field effects on radical pairs generally assume that the light activating the magnetoreceptor molecules is nondirectional and unpolarized, and that light absorption is isotropic. However, natural skylight enters the avian retina unidirectionally, through the cornea and the lens, and is often partially polarized. In addition, cryptochromes, the putative magnetoreceptor molecules, absorb light anisotropically, i. e., they preferentially absorb light of a specific direction and polarization, implying that the light-dependent {{magnetic compass}} is intrinsically polarization sensitive. To test putative interactions between the avian magnetic compass and polarized light, we developed a spatial orientation assay and trained zebra finches to magnetic and/or overhead polarized light cues in a four-arm "plus" maze. The birds did not use overhead polarized light near the zenith for <b>sky</b> <b>compass</b> orientation. Instead, overhead polarized light modulated light-dependent magnetic compass orientation, i. e., how the birds perceive the magnetic field. Birds were well oriented when tested with the polarized light axis aligned parallel to the magnetic field. When the polarized light axis was aligned perpendicular to the magnetic field, the birds became disoriented. These findings are the first behavioral evidence to our knowledge for a direct interaction between polarized light and the light-dependent magnetic compass in an animal. They reveal a fundamentally new property of the radical pair-based magnetoreceptor with key implications for how birds and other animals perceive the Earth's magnetic field...|$|E
40|$|Animal {{species from}} nearly all major taxa show migratory behavior, {{and some of}} these animals cover {{remarkable}} distances. Well studied examples are migratory birds like the arctic tern Sterna paradisaea that migrates from boreal and high Arctic breeding grounds to the Southern Ocean (Egevang et al., 2009). Insects also attain excellent achievements in annual migration as shown by the monarch butterfly Danaus plexippus which changes its habitat between eastern North America and central Mexico (Kyriacou, 2009). How can these animals perform such remarkable migrations? Which mechanisms underlie such a performance? Foraging ants and bees use navigational strategies similar to those of birds and mammals to reach a goal. To navigate through familiar terrain, all of these species use path integration and memories of visual landmarks (Collett & Collett, 2002). During path integration, an animal permanently updates a homing vector resulting from all angular and translational movements so that it can always take a direct path back to its starting point (Collett & Collett, 2000). To compute resulting novel routes out of several single homing flights, bees use a map-like navigation strategy that allows targetoriented decisions at any place and toward any intended location within the familiar terrain (Menzel et al., 2006). These mechanisms are used for near-range navigation, termed as "homing", rather than for long-distance navigation tasks. Animals that navigate through unknown space are forced to use cues of a global nature, such as the geomagnetic field, the stars, and cues related to the position of the sun (Frost & Mouritsen, 2006). Like diverse marine animals, e. g. marine turtles, lobsters, and molluscs, the green sea-turtle Chelonia mydas has a magnetic map sense for navigation to specific targets (Cain et al., 2005; Lohmann et al., 2004). Many diurnal species use a time-compensated sun-compass, other <b>sky</b> <b>compass</b> cues like polarized light, or stars for steering toward distant targets (Wehner, 1984; Homberg, 2004; Frost & Mouritsen, 2006) ...|$|E
