40|$|Drawing upon {{a recent}} study of felony jury <b>sentencing</b> <b>in</b> Kentucky, Virginia, and Arkansas, this essay {{highlights}} some of the similarities and differences between jury <b>sentencing</b> <b>in</b> capital cases and jury <b>sentencing</b> <b>in</b> non-capital cases. Unlike jury <b>sentencing</b> <b>in</b> capital cases, jury <b>sentencing</b> <b>in</b> non-capital cases includes functional differentials in judge and jury options for sentencing, and fewer controls on arbitrary decision-making. Jury <b>sentencing</b> <b>in</b> both contexts shares the potential for reluctance on the part of elected judges to reduce jury sentences, information gaps on the part of jurors <b>in</b> setting <b>sentences,</b> and, above all, service as a tool in negotiating settlements...|$|R

50|$|In {{computational}} linguistics, the Gale-Church {{algorithm is}} a method for aligning corresponding <b>sentences</b> <b>in</b> a parallel corpus.

50|$|Tim Crane, in {{his book}} The Mechanical Mind, states that, while he agrees with Fodor, his reason is very different. A logical {{objection}} challenges LOTH’s explanation of how <b>sentences</b> <b>in</b> natural languages get their meaning. That is the view that “Snow is white” is TRUE {{if and only if}} P is TRUE in the LOT, where P means the same thing in LOT as “Snow is white” means in the natural language. Any symbol manipulation is in need of some way of deriving what those symbols mean. If the meaning of <b>sentences</b> is explained <b>in</b> terms of <b>sentences</b> <b>in</b> the LOT, then the meaning of <b>sentences</b> <b>in</b> LOT must get their meaning from somewhere else. There seems to be an infinite regress of sentences getting their meaning. <b>Sentences</b> <b>in</b> natural languages get their meaning from their users (speakers, writers). Therefore, <b>sentences</b> <b>in</b> mentalese must get their meaning from {{the way in which they}} are used by thinkers and so on ad infinitum. This regress is often called the homunculus regress.|$|R

Two years later, Leaf pleaded guilty to felony burglary and drug possession in Montana. After a suspended sentence with a stint in drug rehabilitation, Leaf began serving a seven-year <b>sentence</b> <b>in</b> state prison in December 2012. In 2014, Leaf was sentenced {{to five years in}} prison for breaking into a home in Montana to steal prescription drugs, which violated his Texas probation.

5|$|Citing Hirabayashi, Chief Justice Stone {{wrote the}} opinion of the court, and {{determined}} that the curfew and exclusion orders were valid, even as applied to citizens of the United States. Stone’s opinion was three pages and did not contain any concurring opinions or dissents, while the Hirabayashi decision had thirty-four pages and two concurring opinions. In Yasui the court affirmed his conviction of the misdemeanor, but ordered re-sentencing since the lower court had determined that the curfew was not valid, and that Yasui had forfeited his citizenship. The Supreme Court remanded (returned) the case back to the district court to determine a <b>sentence</b> <b>in</b> light of these circumstances.|$|E
5|$|Debs {{was noted}} for his oratory, and his speech denouncing American {{participation}} in World War I {{led to his}} second arrest in 1918. He was convicted under the Sedition Act of 1918 and sentenced to a term of 10 years. President Warren G. Harding commuted his <b>sentence</b> <b>in</b> December 1921. Debs died in 1926, not long after being admitted to a sanatorium due to cardiovascular problems that developed during his time in prison. He has since been cited as the inspiration for numerous politicians.|$|E

Wilson had refused to pardon him before leaving office. Daugherty met with Debs, and was deeply impressed. There was opposition from veterans, including the American Legion, and also from Florence Harding. The president did not feel he could release Debs until the war was officially over, but once the peace treaties were signed commuted Debs' sentence on December 23, 1921. At Harding's request, Debs visited the president at the White House before going home to Indiana.|$|E

Griffin has been criticised for many of his comments on political, social, ethical and religious matters, but after becoming leader of the BNP he sought {{to distance himself from}} some of his previously held positions, which include Holocaust denial. In recent years, events where Griffin has been invited to participate in public debates or political discussions have proven controversial and often resulted in protests and cancellations.|$|E

Appealing the case on grounds of ineffective counsel at the first trial, Celestin's initial conviction was overturned in 2005 and he was granted a new trial to rehear the charges.
