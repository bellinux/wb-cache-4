25|$|Poor old Keeper, Emily's {{faithful}} {{friend and}} worshipper, <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> {{her like a}} human being. One evening, when the four friends were sitting closely round {{the fire in the}} sitting-room, Keeper forced himself in between Charlotte and Emily and mounted himself on Emily’s lap; finding the space too limited for his comfort he pressed himself forward on to the guest’s knees, making himself quite comfortable. Emily’s heart was won by the unresisting endurance of the visitor, little guessing that she herself, being in close contact, was the inspiring cause of submission to Keeper’s preference. Sometimes Emily would delight in showing off Keeper—make him frantic in action, and roar with the voice of a lion. It was a terrifying exhibition within the walls of an ordinary sitting-room. Keeper was a solemn mourner at Emily’s funeral and never recovered his cheerfulness.|$|E
500|$|Sabadino Parker from PopMatters wrote {{negatively}} {{about the}} mythology {{of the last two}} seasons, noting that [...] "story itself became even more convoluted" [...] and that [...] "the past two seasons should never have happened." [...] Entertainment Weekly reviewer Ken Tucker speculated that Chris Carter {{was the only one who}} <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> the show's complex mytharc. Joyce Millman from The New York Times called the storyline involving Scully's child—which left her [...] "haunted and irritable"—"a sad misuse of the radiant Anderson". The A.V. Club was highly critical of the final season and its mythology story, calling them a [...] "clumsy mish-mash of stuff that had once worked and new serialized storylines about so-called 'super soldiers'".|$|E
500|$|Sabadino Parker from PopMatters, when {{commenting on}} the series finale, said, [...] "It's also for the good, because The X-Files has long been but a pale {{reflection}} of the show it once was." [...] Brian Linder from IGN was more positive to the ninth season, saying that the series could still have aired if the writers created a new storyline for Robert Patrick and Annabeth Gish's character, which The X-Files crew did not do and continued what was seen by many critics as tiresome. Aaron Kinney from Salon magazine was more negative to the new season, even joking about the new female lead, calling her a [...] "peppy new female presence." [...] Entertainment Weekly reviewer Ken Tucker said the show operated in what he called [...] "quaint territory", speculating that Chris Carter {{was the only one}} who <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> the complex mytharc. Elizabeth Weinbloom from The New York Times concluded with, [...] "shoddy writing notwithstanding, it was this halfhearted culmination of what was once a beautifully complicated friendship", between Mulder and Scully, ended remaining interest in what was a [...] "waning phenomenon". Another review from The New York Times said of the show, [...] "The most imaginative show on television has finally reached the limits of its imagination." [...] The A.V. Club listed the ninth season and the 2008 film [...] as the [...] "bad apple" [...] of The X-Files, describing the ninth season as [...] "clumsy mish-mash of stuff that had once worked and new serialized storylines about so-called 'super soldiers'". [...] M.A. Crang, in his book Denying the Truth: Revisiting The X-Files after 9/11, noted that season nine [...] "does not have a great reputation among viewers". However he argued that the season contains a few [...] "hidden gems" [...] and praised those episodes which dealt with new material, while criticising other entries for focusing too heavily on [...] "plotlines and characters from years gone by".|$|E

2500|$|Berlin's {{daughter}} {{wrote in}} her memoir that {{her father was a}} loving, if workaholic, family man who was [...] "basically an upbeat person, with down periods." [...] In his final decades he retreated from public life. Her parents liked to celebrate every single holiday with their children, and [...] "They <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> the importance, particularly in childhood, of the special day, the same every year, the special stories, foods, and decorations and that special sense of well-being that accompanies a holiday." [...] Although he did comment to his daughter about her mother's lavish Christmas spending, [...] "I gave up trying to get your mother to economize. It was easier just to make more money." ...|$|E
2500|$|HyperCard was a {{huge hit}} almost instantly. Many people who thought they {{would never be able}} to program a {{computer}} started using HyperCard for many automation and prototyping tasks, a surprise even to its creator. Apple never <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> what HyperCard's target market for users should be. Project managers found it was being used by a huge number of people, internally and externally. Bug reports and upgrade suggestions continued to flow in, demonstrating it had a wide variety of users. Since it was also free, it was difficult to justify dedicating engineering resources to improvements in the software. [...] It was not lost on Apple or its mainstream developers that the power HyperCard gave to people could cut into the sales of ordinary shrink-wrapped products.|$|E

2500|$|In 1950, {{while working}} at Los Alamos National Laboratory, Fermi had a casual {{conversation}} while walking to lunch with colleagues Emil Konopinski, Edward Teller and Herbert York. The men discussed a recent spate of UFO reports and an Alan Dunn cartoon facetiously blaming the disappearance of municipal trashcans on marauding aliens. [...] The conversation shifted to other subjects, until during lunch Fermi suddenly exclaimed, [...] "Where are they?" [...] (alternatively, [...] "Where is everybody?"). [...] Teller remembers, [...] "The result of his question was general laughter because of the strange fact {{that in spite of}} Fermi's question coming from the clear blue, everybody around the table <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> at once that he was talking about extraterrestrial life." [...] Herbert York recalls that Fermi followed up on his comment with a series of calculations on the probability of Earth-like planets, the probability of life, the likely rise and duration of high technology, etc., and concluded that we ought to have been visited long ago and many times over.|$|E
