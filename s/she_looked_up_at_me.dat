60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> defensively and for {{a moment}} neither of us spoke.|$|E
60|$|She {{broke the}} seal, {{went to the}} table, and read. Then <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b>|$|E
60|$|In {{surprise}} <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> {{and then}} down at the pearls upon her satin slippers.|$|E
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> him; it was {{the very}} spot on which a couple of hours before <b>she</b> had <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> her mother. [...] "You're free--you're free." ...|$|R
60|$|Her eyebrows were faintly contracted. <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> him pathetically.|$|R
60|$|Wingate laughed softly. <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> {{him with}} {{twinkling}} eyes.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> {{as though}} asking for {{confirmation}} of her views. I shook my head.|$|E
60|$|I set {{more food}} before the famished child and kissed her. <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> with {{wondering}} eyes.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> with {{a little}} smile. I think she must have {{forgotten}} {{the pain in her}} foot.|$|E
60|$|He obeyed mutely. <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> {{him with}} bright, unquailing eyes.|$|R
60|$|And <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> him, half smiling, half pouting; {{altogether}} bewitching.|$|R
60|$|She {{had been}} brooding. <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> him {{suddenly}} in surprise.|$|R
60|$|She {{was leaning}} back in her chair, her hands behind her head, a posture she often assumed. <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> amusedly.|$|E
60|$|A faint blush {{came over}} her cheeks, {{and a smile}} broke out on her lips; <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> with a pretty reproachful air.|$|E
60|$|Later, I sought her out. <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> amusedly {{from the}} window-seat in our living-room, {{where she had}} been talking to the Scherer girls.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> Mr. Britling {{as if she}} {{measured}} his understanding.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> {{him with}} her grey eyes, humiliated and lonely.|$|R
60|$|The woman hesitated. <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> {{the clock}} and down again.|$|R
60|$|Presently {{the woman}} came forward again, her head rather ducked. But <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> and smiled, with that odd, {{immediate}} intimacy, something witch-like and impossible.|$|E
6000|$|... "Poor Antoinette!" [...] she said, [...] "I wish {{we might}} have saved her this." [...] <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> [...] "How she defended him!" [...] she exclaimed.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> quite kindly for a moment. Then {{suddenly}} her manner completely--changed. She withdrew {{her eyes}} from my face, with a slight flush in her cheeks, and turned abruptly away.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> {{him almost}} {{for the first}} time since her entrance.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> him shyly, {{yet with}} unmistakable love transfiguring her countenance.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> {{him with}} a little grimace and patted his hand.|$|R
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> eagerly with {{a sudden}} look of hushed inquiry. [...] "You mean it?" [...] she asked, {{trembling}} visibly. [...] "You mean it, Mr. Tristram? You {{know what you are}} saying?" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> questioningly yet gratefully, {{through a}} mist of tears. But her reply--whatever {{it might have}} been--was forestalled {{by the sound of}} shouts and {{laughter}} in the hallway. She sprang up and ran to the door.|$|E
60|$|I stood {{close to}} the instrument-covered wall--Dejah Thoris at my side. <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> wonderingly as the warriors {{advanced}} upon us with drawn swords, for mine still hung within its scabbard at my side, {{and there was a}} smile upon my lips.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> {{him with}} an {{expression}} of pleading in her eyes.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> him, and answered, not him, but her own thoughts.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> him, {{and to his}} amazement {{her eyes}} were swimming.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> {{with eyes}} clear and transcendent as the heavens. But she was {{slightly}} roused. There was the slight {{motion of the}} eagle in her turning to look at me, a faint gleam of rapt light in her eyes. It was my unaccustomed Italian.|$|E
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> {{and with}} her eyes she said, [...] "How could I help knowing?" [...] She might have {{intended}} to say something with her lips, but I took my answer from her eyes, and with the quick impulse of a lover I stopped her speech.|$|E
60|$|The Countess {{had a very}} beautiful, cream-tinted {{complexion}} of a sort which I particularly admire, but {{she grew}} whiter and whiter as <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> Harsh lines deepened upon her face until she seemed, even as I looked at her, to turn from youth into age.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> him. He stood {{a shadowy}} {{presence}} beyond the light.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> a {{sound and}} saw her father {{standing}} in the doorway.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> him, and {{a slight}} {{sinister}} smile contracted her white face.|$|R
