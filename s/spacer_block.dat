50|$|Shearleg derrick {{is similar}} to breast with an {{exception}} that instead of fixed guy wires that secure {{the top of the}} mast, it is secured by multiple reeved guy to permit handling loads at various radii by means of load tackle pulley system suspended from the mast top. In a simpler construction, a shearleg derrick can be assembled from two posts to form A-frame shear legs without any crossbar. The bottom of the legs are set in two holes on the ground spreading them apart. There is a rope to tie the two legs together near the bottom to prevent them from spreading apart further. On the top side, the two legs are connected together by a lashing but with a small <b>spacer</b> <b>block</b> placed between the legs. A sling, which may be made from ropes, is placed around the area that two legs meet to be used to put a tackle pulley system for lifting the load. There are two guy wires, front and rear, to support the shear legs. The rear guy may be reeved to allow adjustment of the angle of the shear legs.|$|E
50|$|As {{the planks}} reached the desired height, the {{interior}} frame (futtocks) and cross beams were added. Frames were placed close together, {{which is an}} enduring feature of thin planked ships, still used today on some lightweight wooden racing craft such as those designed by Bruce Farr. Viking boat builders used a spacing of about 850 mm. Part {{of the reason for}} this spacing was to achieve the correct distance between rowing stations and to create space for the chests used by Norse sailors as thwarts (seats). The bottom futtocks next to the keel were made from natural L-shaped crooks. The upper futtocks were usually not attached to the lower futtocks to allow some hull twist. The parts were held together with iron rivets, hammered in from the outside of the hull and fastened from the inside with a rove (washers). The surplus rivet was then cut off. A ship normally used about 700 kg of iron nails in a 18 m long ship. In some ships the gap between the lower uneven futtock and the lapstrake planks was filled with a <b>spacer</b> <b>block</b> about 200 mm long. In later ships spruce stringers were fastened lengthwise to the futtocks roughly parallel to the keel. Longships had about five rivets for each yard (90 cm) of plank. In many early ships treenails (trenails, trunnels) were used to fasten large timbers. First, a hole about 20 mm wide hole was drilled through two adjoining timbers, a wooden pegs inserted which was split and a thin wedge inserted to expand the peg. Some treenails have been found with traces of linseed oil suggesting that treenails were soaked before the pegs were inserted. When dried the oil would act as a semi-waterproof weak filler/glue.|$|E
50|$|The {{position}} {{and length of}} oars is critical to rowboat performance. Generally, short boats have short oars. A 8 ft dinghy uses oars about 6+1/2 ft. A short oar makes quick but short strokes possible. A short oar is easier to use in a narrow creek or a crowded anchorage. This is important in a small tender which may be heavily laden with passengers, limiting the swing of the oars. A short, quick stroke prevents the bow being driven under in choppy waters while heavily laden. Longer oars {{can be used to}} produce longer, slower strokes, which are easier to maintain over long distances. Designers may match oar length to the amount of space provided for oar storage in the boat. Wooden oars are generally made of a light, strong wood, such as fir or ash. The blades can either be flat for general use, or spooned for faster propulsion.Utility oars are often unbalanced. Rowers looking for performance and ease of use over long distances often use balanced oars, where the inboard (handle) end uses either heavy shoulders(button/collar) or lead weights inside the handle. Generally the oar is weighted so it is balanced about 11 in outboard of the rowlock in a 7 ft oar so the oar is slightly blade heavy. Most designers position rowlocks about 12 in aft of the rowing thwart and about 6 in above the thwart. Short rowers—5 ft and under—can shorten these distances by 1 in and taller rowers—6 ft plus—can extend the distance 1 - 2 in. In a short rowing boat the distance is often shortened to 9 in and 4 in. The height of the rowlock plate is adjusted by the height of the wooden <b>spacer</b> <b>block.</b> Rowboat used as tenders should have U shaped rowlocks so oars can quickly be unshipped when coming alongside.|$|E

The report has been performed according to Lulea University of Technology (LTU) guidelines for a thesis work á 15 HP. The results of the thesis presents a multi designed prototype solution of a <b>spacer</b> <b>block</b> which is designed to be highly flexible and solve an ergonomically complex work moment. The solution for example solves heavy lifts by reducing weight and introduces more ergonomically work position and movements. The results should still continue to be verified before going into the live work process, this to reduce risks and pass validations which is not within the scope of this thesis. Three concept solutions have been evaluated after research and identification of the problem. Theoretical studies, work experiences, sketches, available solutions and limitations have been applied to analyze three prototype solutions. Each of the selected prototypes have been designed to a 3 D CAD model and produced to be tested and evaluated in a live working environment with a concept selection matrix. Integrations to find the best applicable solutions have been performed in coherence with design and production personel at Scania Ferruform, but also discussed with supervisors at LTU.

In the herein presented work the folding of different distinct domains within a single macromolecule is demonstrated. RAFT polymerization was used to produce multiblock copolymers, which are decorated with pendant hydroxyl groups in foldable sections, separated by nonfunctional spacer blocks in between. OH-bearing blocks were folded using an isocyanate cross-linker prior to chain extension to form single chain nanoparticles (SCNP). After addition of a <b>spacer</b> <b>block</b> and a further OH decorated block, folding was repeated to generate individual SCNP within a polymer chain. Control experiments were performed indicating the absence of interblock cross-linking. SCNP were found to be condensed by a combination of covalent and supramolecular (hydrogen bonds) linkage.

40|$|Abstract: Based on turnout/bridge {{interaction}} {{principle and}} {{finite element method}} (FEM), an integrated turnout/beam/pier model of jointless turnout on ballasted track was established to analyze the influences of expansion joint on stress and deformation of the turnout. The results are concluded as follows: whether the rail expansion joint is set in front of or behind the turnout, expansion additional force of stock rail will be reduced greatly {{at the end of}} the beam; so do the expansion displacement of switch rail and nose rail, the stress of displacement restrictor and <b>spacer</b> <b>block,</b> rail break gap and the longitudinal force of one rail after the other rail broke. But when the expansion joint is set in front of the turnout, the pier’s longitudinal force of continuous beam bridge and the simply supported beam bridge (within the expansion range of the device) increase greatly. When the device is close to the turnout, longitudinal relative displacement of the stock rail to the girder also increases a lot. By comparison, it is more favorable to set the expansion joint behind the turnout, or to set the device at the both ends of the continuous beam, or to set the device at the ends of continuous beam rather than in the center of the span...|$|E

40|$|Purpose - Maintaining air {{circulation}} between the wearer and garment layer {{is crucial for}} activating heat and moisture transfer from the body. If an air gap is trapped, {{air circulation}} may become ineffective and the ventilation of the garment is, thus, hindered. To maintain and extend the air gap, this study aims to propose a design method that involves placing <b>spacer</b> <b>blocks</b> underneath the garment to prevent the fabric from clinging directly to the skin. Design/methodology/approach - To study the application of this design method, a series of T-shirts were produced and tested using a thermal manikin in standing and walking postures. All the T-shirts were made of fabric ostensibly manufactured to have high air permeability. Porous mesh fabric was used to construct the vented panels on the T-shirts. The test was conducted in a chamber with controlled temperature, relative humidity and wind velocity. Total thermal insulation (R-t) and moisture vapour resistance (R-et) were measured. Findings - The test results showed that extension of the air gap between wearer and fabric provided higher ventilation to the wearer if the vented panels were also present on the T-shirts. Different placements of the vented panels on the T-shirts also affected the heat and moisture transfer from the thermal manikin. Research limitations/implications - Due to limited resources, the evaluation of total thermal insulation and moisture vapour resistance {{was based on the}} testing result from a thermal manikin instead of any subjective wearer trial. Practical implications - This research can contribute to the clothing designer who is developing function wear for a better ventilation. Social implications - This research can contribute to the clothing designer who is developing function wear for a better ventilation. Originality/value - This study aimed to further develop a new design concept in T-shirt design by improving the construction of the <b>spacer</b> <b>blocks.</b> Fabric with higher air and water vapour permeability was used to determine to what extent this design method is applicable to higher performance on heat and moisture transfer.

40|$|Layered superconductors have {{provided}} some interesting fields in {{condensed matter physics}} owing to the low dimensionality of their electronic states.

30|$|Positioning {{of the six}} {{reinforcement}} bars and the centre cathode bar {{was done with the}} help of a wooden base, where bars were slotted in pre-drilled holes. The specimens were cast in the inverted position such that each bar protruded out of one end of the specimen by 15  mm when in the upright position. The protrusions of the bars were meant to allow connection of the electric circuit from the power supply to the specimens. After the main bars were put in place, spiral reinforcements were then tied to the main bars. Subsequently, epoxy coating was applied to both ends of the region of each specimen to prevent corrosion to these regions. <b>Spacer</b> <b>blocks</b> were also put along the spiral reinforcements to ensure required concrete cover. Large pipes of 208  mm diameter were also cut which formed the moulds of the specimens. A slit was made along the longitudinal direction of each pipe to facilitate the removal of the formwork upon demoulding. The slit was then closed by tying wires around the pipe. After that, the pipes were placed onto the wooden base and sealed along the circumference using silicone. Silicone was also applied along the slit to close up the gap.|$|R

To do so, colloidal solutions of oleic acid-capped γ-Fe 2 O 3 and long-chain alkylammonium-encapsulated {Mo 132 } dispersed in chloroform are mixed together and supported self-organized binary superlattices are obtained upon the solvent evaporation on immersed substrates. Both electronic microscopy and small angles X-ray scattering data reveal an AB-type structure and an enhanced structuration {{of the magnetic}} nanocrystals (MNCs) assembly with POMs in octahedral interstices. Therefore, {Mo 132 } acts as an efficient binder constituent for improving the nanocrystals ordering in 3 D films. Interestingly, {{in the case of}} didodecyldimethylammonium (C 12) -encapsulated POMs, the long-range ordered binary assemblies are obtained while preserving the nanocrystals magnetic properties due to weak POMs–MNCs interactions.

40|$|Reverse {{electrodialysis}} (RED) is {{a sustainable}} energy source that converts the free energy of mixing of two solutions with different salinity directly into electrical energy. High power outputs are predicted theoretically, but the practical power output and {{the efficiency of}} the process are still relatively low.

We combined theoretical calculations with direct current and alternating current experimental stack characterization methods to quantify this effect on stack resistance and power output in RED process under different hydrodynamic conditions. The use of ion conductive spacers led to a decrease in stack resistance and an increase in power density of a factor 3 compared to the use of non-conductive spacers made of PVC with the same open area and shape. This result increases the impact of RED as renewable energy source and brings it closer to economical viability and practical implementation...|$|R
40|$|Track {{stiffness}} in railway turnouts is variable due {{to differences}} in structural composition along the longitudinal direction, which will lead to severe dynamic interaction between train and turnout. In this paper, a transient analysis model is presented to investigate the stiffness characteristics of high-speed railway turnouts based on the finite element method and is applied to optimise the stiffness of railway turnouts. Furthermore, the effect of the stiffness variations on the dynamic train-turnout interaction is analysed. The calculation results show that the track stiffness characteristics are similar in the main and diverging line of railway turnout, except for the check rail sections. Due to the existence of shared baseplates and <b>spacer</b> <b>blocks</b> between different rails, the stiffness variations in the crossing panel are most severe in high-speed railway turnouts. The stiffness differences (calculated as the ratio of the maximum and minimum stiffness) of the longitudinal and lateral direction for Chinese number 18 ballasted turnout are 216 % and 229 %, respectively. The graded stiffness of the tie pads has been redesigned to optimise the stiffness of railway turnout based on the transient analysis model and the stiffness differences of the turnout are decreased.

40|$|International audienceBackground: During total knee {{arthroplasty}} (TKA), femoral rotation can {{be adjusted}} either in relation to bony landmarks or by tensioning the ligaments with the knee in 90 degrees of flexion. The primary objective {{of this study was}} to compare femoral rotations achieved using various ligament-tensioning devices. The secondary objective was to compare these femoral rotations to that indicated by the transepicondylar axis (TEA). Material and methods: We performed 13 posterior-stabilised TKA procedures using HiFit (Ceraver (R)) on cadaver knees. Before performing the posterior condyle cut, we used an original method to measure the femoral rotation induced by five different ligament-tensioning devices (2 with a ratchet mechanism, 1 with screws, 1 force-sensing device, and 1 with <b>spacer</b> <b>blocks)</b> and the central tibio-femoral distance(CTFD). Results: Both ratchet tensioners provided significantly greater mean external rotation values (P= 0. 002), of 4. 94 degrees and 4. 46 degrees, respectively, compared to the force-sensing and spacer tensioners. Significant differences were found across devices for CTFD, with a mean difference of about 2 mm between the ratchet and screwtensioners versus the force-sensing and spacer tensioners. The mean differences in rotations obtained using the tensioners versus the TEA were close to 0 degrees but with standard deviations greater than 4 degrees. Conclusion: Femoral rotation was dependent on the distraction force applied to the joint. Tensioners that did not measure the distraction force were associated with greater distraction force and external rotation values. The TEA criterion did not reliably indicate good ligament balance.

40|$|Exotic {{superconductivity}} {{has often}} been discovered in materials with a layered (two-dimensional) crystal structure. The low dimensionality can affect the electronic structure and can realize high transition temperatures (Tc) and/or unconventional superconductivity mechanisms. As standard examples, we now have two types of high-Tc superconductors. The first group is the Cu-oxide superconductors whose crystal structure is basically composed of a stacking of <b>spacer</b> (<b>blocking)</b> layers and superconducting CuO 2 layers. 1 - 4 The second group is the Fe-based superconductors which also possess a stacking structure of spacer layers and superconducting Fe 2 An 2 (An = P, As, Se, Te) layers. 5 - 13 In both systems, dramatic enhancements of Tc are achieved by optimizing the spacer layer structure, for instance, a variety of composing elements, spacer thickness, and carrier doping levels {{with respect to the}} superconducting layers. In this respect, to realize higher-Tc superconductivity, other than Cu-oxide and Fe-based superconductors, the discovery of a new prototype of layered superconductors needs to be achieved. Here we show superconductivity in a new bismuth-oxysulfide layered compound Bi 4 O 4 S 3. Crystal structure analysis indicates that this superconductor has a layered structure composed of stacking of Bi 4 O 4 (SO 4) 1 -x and Bi 2 S 4 layers; the parent compound (x = 0) is Bi 6 O 8 S 5. Band calculation suggests that Bi 4 O 4 S 3 (x = 0. 5) is metallic while Bi 6 O 8 S 5 (x = 0) is a band insulator with Bi 3 +. Furthermore, the Fermi level for Bi 4 O 4 S 3 is just on the peak position of the partial density of states of the Bi 6 p orbital within the BiS 2 layer. The BiS 2 layer is a basic structure which provides another universality class for layered superconducting family, and this opens up a new field in the physics and chemistry of low-dimensional superconductors.

40|$|The {{simulation}} of flow in naturally fractured reservoirs commonly divides the reservoir into two continua - the matrix {{system and the}} fracture system. Flow equations are written presuming that the primary flow between grid blocks occurs through the fracture system and that the primary fluid storage is in the matrix system. The dual porosity formulation of the equations assumes {{that there is no}} flow between matrix blocks while the dual permeability formulation allows fluid movement between matrix blocks. Since most of the fluid storage is contained in the matrix, recovery is dominated by the transfer of fluid from the matrix to the high conductivity fractures. The physical mechanisms influencing this transfer have been evaluated primarily through numerical studies. Relatively few experimental studies have investigated the transfer mechanisms. Early studies focused on the prediction of reservoir recoveries from the results of scaled experiments on single reservoir blocks. Recent experiments have investigated some of the mechanisms that are dominant in gravity drainage situations and in small block imbibition displacements. The mechanisms active in multiphase flow in fractured media need to be further illuminated, since some of the experimental results appear to be contradictory.

These spacers can be relatively thick compared to the membrane, and thus they increase internal stack resistance due to high solution (ohmic) resistance associated with a thick spacer. New types of patterned anion and cation exchange membranes were developed by casting membranes to create hemispherical protrusions on the membranes, enabling fluid flow between the membranes {{without the need for}} a non-conductive spacer. The use of the patterned membrane decreased the MRC stack resistance by ∼ 22 Ω, resulting in a 38 % increase in power density from 2. 50 ± 0. 04 W m- 2 (non-patterned membrane with a non-conductive spacer) to 3. 44 ± 0. 02 W m- 2 (patterned membrane). The COD removal rate, coulombic efficiency, and energy efficiency of the MRC also increased using the patterned membranes compared to the non-patterned membranes. These results demonstrate that these patterned ion exchange membranes can be used to improve performance of an MRC. © 2014 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Reversible {{addition}} fragmentation {{chain transfer}} (RAFT) polymerization {{is a very}} versatile way to generate synthetic polymeric materials. Multiblock copolymers have received enormous scientific interest recently due {{to the ability to}} mimic the sequence-regulated microstructure of biopolymers. The objective of this thesis was to investigate RAFT polymerization and explore its potential in the synthesis of sequence-controlled multiblock polymeric chains, and their use to tune the micro-structure of the polymers, engineer single chain polymeric nanoparticles, and fabricate functional polymeric nanomaterials. This work firstly addresses the investigation of the enormous ability of sequence-controlled multiblock copolymer to tune the physical properties by altering their microstructure. A series of sequence controlled multiblock copolymers were synthesized by RAFT polymerization using ethylene glycol methyl ether acrylate and tert-butyl acrylate as monomers. These block copolymers were synthesized with an alternating order of the two monomers with a similar total degree of polymerization. The number of blocks was varied by decreasing the length of each block while keeping the ratio of monomers constant. Their microphase separation was studied by investigating the glass transition temperature utilizing differential scanning calorimetry analysis. Small angel X-ray scattering analysis was also applied to investigate the transition of the microphase separation with the variation of the segmentations of these multiblock copolymers. The study found the microstructure was significantly affected by the number of segments of the polymer chain whilst keeping the total length constant. Having demonstrated the enormous potential of sequence controlled multiblock copolymers to access defined microstructures, further studies were focused on mimicking the controlled folding process of the peptide chain to a secondary and tertiary structure using sequence controlled multiblock copolymers. RAFT polymerization was used to produce multiblock copolymers, which are decorated with pendant cross-linkable groups in foldable sections, separated by non-functional <b>spacer</b> <b>blocks</b> in between. An external cross linker was then used to cause the folding of the specific domains. A chain extension-folding sequence was applied to create polymer chains having individual folded subdomains. In order to achieve a further step on the way to copy nature’s ability to synthesize highly defined bio-macromolecules with a distinct three dimensional structure, linear diblock copolymer precursors were synthesized by RAFT polymerization. One block of the precursor with pendant functional groups was folded using an external cross-linker to form tadpole-like single chain nanoparticles (SCNPs). These tadpole-like SCNPs could then self-assemble into a more complex stimuli responsive 3 D structure by adaptation to environmental pH changes. The stimuli responsive assemblies were found to be able to dissociate responding to low pH or exposure to glucose...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} {{self-assembly}} of an asymmetric triblock {{copolymer consisting of}} an elastin-like and a silk-like block bridged by a hydrophilic <b>spacer.</b> The elastin-like <b>block</b> aggregates at high temperature, leading to thermo-reversible micellization. The silk-like block self-assembles at low pH, and forms long fibrils, which dissociate again at high pH. The self-assembly of both blocks is strongly enhanced by increasing the salt concentration. When two blocks are sequentially triggered to self-assemble, the reversibility is lost; the final morphology and mechanical properties depend on the pathway that is chosen. A micellar solution formed at high temperature transforms into a gel network of sticky fibrils when the pH is lowered. Heating a solution of fibrils, formed at low pH, leads to the irreversible formation of bundles and large aggregate...|$|R
40|$|Glyco-functionalized gold {{nanoparticles}} {{have great}} potential as biosensors and as inhibitors {{due to their}} increased binding to carbohydrate-recognizing receptors such as the lectins. Here we apply previously developed solid phase polymer synthesis to obtain a series of precision glycomacromolecules that allows for straightforward variation of their chemical structure as well as functionalization of gold nanoparticles by ligand exchange. A novel building block is introduced allowing for the change of <b>spacer</b> building <b>blocks</b> within the macromolecular scaffold going from an ethylene glycol unit to an aliphatic spacer. Furthermore, the valency and overall length of the glycomacromolecule is varied. All glyco-functionalized gold nanoparticles show high degree of functionalization along with high stability in buffer solution. Therefore, a series of measurements applying UV-Vis spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering (DLS) and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) were performed studying the aggregation behavior of the glyco-functionalized gold nanoparticles in presence of model lectin Concanavalin A. While the multivalent presentation of glycomacromolecules on gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) showed a strong increase in binding compared to the free ligands, we also observed an influence of the chemical structure of the ligand such as its valency or hydrophobicity on the resulting lectin interactions. The straightforward variation of the chemical structure of the precision glycomacromolecule thus gives access to tailor-made glyco-gold nanoparticles (glyco-AuNPs) and fine-tuning of their lectin binding properties...|$|R
40|$|Spacer-less RED stacks using {{membranes}} with integrated spacer profiles {{have been}} investigated during the last years to eliminate the spacer shadow effect. The presence of <b>spacers</b> partially <b>blocks</b> the membrane surface and creates a tortuous and thus longer path for ions in the channel, meaning higher ohmic resistance. Consequently, power outputs are reduced. Profiled membranes may solve this problem as they provide flow channels for the feed streams, while the relief formed on their surfaces keeps the membranes separated. Although the geometry and arrangement of so far used profiles led to lower ohmic resistance, it did not grant an efficient fluid mixing. Recently, so-called chevron profiles, with enhanced mixing, were proposed based on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. In the present study, the performance of such chevron-profiled membranes, prepared by thermal pressing, was experimentally validated in a reverse electrodialysis (RED) stack. According to the obtained experimental values of non-ohmic resistance and total pressure drop across the RED stack, the chevron-profiled membranes assure efficient fluid mixing at comparatively low hydraulic losses. The net power density obtained with chevron-profiled membranes was the highest obtained for the present stack design. It outperformed the alternative RED stack configurations investigated in this study, such as channels with optimized spacers and channels formed by pillar-profiled membranes. To allow for an even more straightforward and efficient RED stack assembling with chevron-profiled membranes, recommendations for a further simplified design, consisting of diagonal ridges that are assembled perpendicularly, are provided...|$|R
40|$|The fluid {{transfer}} parameters between {{rock matrix}} and fracture {{are not well}} known. Consequently, simulation of fractured reservoirs uses, in general, very crude and unproven hypotheses such as zero capillary pressure in the fracture and/or relative permeability linear with saturation. In order to improve the understanding of flow in fractured media, an experimental study was conducted and numerical simulations of the experiments were made. A laboratory flow apparatus was built to obtain data on water- air imbibition and oil-water drainage displacements in horizontal single-fractured block systems. For this purpose, two configurations have been used: a two-block system with a 1 mm <b>spacer</b> between the <b>blocks,</b> and a two-block system with no spacer. During the experiments, porosity and saturation measurements along the cores have been made utilizing an X-ray Computerized Tomography (CT) scanner. Saturation images were reconstructed in 3 -D to observe matrix-fracture interactions. Differences in fluid saturations and relative permeabilities caused by changes in fracture width have also been analyzed...|$|R
