40|$|We {{describe}} the antigenic properties of an anti-idiotypic single chain fragment variable (scFv) recombinant antibody mimicking the type III capsular polysaccharide of group B streptococci (GBS), an important cause of neonatal sepsis. This scFv could {{compete with the}} nominal antigen for binding to specific mouse or rabbit antibodies. Moreover, the scFv elicited, in mice, the production of antibodies which reacted against the type IlI polysaccharide and passively protected neonatal pups from GBS disease. Maternal immunization with the scFv also protected neonatal mice against GBS infection. Next, the scFv was expressed {{on the surface of}} the commensal bacterium Streptococcus gordonii. Intravaginal inoculation of mice with these recombinant bacteria induced significant elevations in serum titers of anti-GBS type III antibodies. Therefore, the expression scFv in commensal bacteria may be a convenient and effective way of delivering <b>anti-idiotypic</b> <b>vaccines...</b>|$|R
40|$|Syngeneic {{monoclonal}} anti-idiotope antibody Ab 2, 2 - 17 C 3 SCC {{was raised}} against an idiotope on a protective monoclonal antibody with specificity for poliovirus type II. Ab 2, 2 - 17 C 3 SCC detects a paratope-related interspecies IdX. Ab 2, 2 - 17 C 3 SCC purified from supernatant fluids of hybridoma cells by protein A-Sepharose was injected into 4 - to 6 -wk-old BALB/c mice. The sera of the mice were screened for {{the expression of}} antibodies bearing the corresponding idiotope. Immunization of mice with Ab 2, 2 - 17 C 3 SCC induced antibodies of complementary specificity. Furthermore, micro VN tests suggest that Ab 2, 2 - 17 C 3 SCC can substitute for antigen in the induction of anti-polio neutralizing antibodies, and hence can function as a monoclonal <b>anti-idiotypic</b> <b>vaccine...</b>|$|R
5000|$|In {{one example}} of {{producing}} an <b>anti-idiotypic</b> <b>vaccine,</b> antibodies that bind tumor-associated antigens (TAA) are isolated and injected into mice. To the murine immune system, the TAA antibodies are antigens and cause an immunogenic reaction producing murine antibodies that can bind to the [...] "TAA idiotype" [...] and {{is said to be}} [...] "anti-idiotypic". The resulting murine antibodies are harvested and used to vaccinate other mice. The resulting antibodies in the second set of mice have a three-dimensional binding site that mimics the original antibodies that bind tumor-associated antigens. These antibodies are combined with an adjuvant and given as a vaccine. The murine immune system essentially [...] "amplifies" [...] a small mass of TAA antibodies into a much larger mass used to vaccinate humans. Because the antibody produced using the [...] "anti-idiotypic" [...] process closely resembles the original epitope of the antigen, these antibodies can be used to induce immune responses from cellular to antibody-antigen for a given antigen, e. g., TAA, when administered as a vaccine to a human. They are mainly used for high risk cancer patients.|$|R
40|$|Conventional {{vaccination}} {{with the}} cocaine molecule conjugated to a protein carrier {{is a new}} approach {{in the treatment of}} addiction. Experimentally, this strategy has been shown to alter the pharmacokinetics as well as the psychostimulant effect of a cocaine challenge. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate whether a more stable and less controversial molecule, an anti-idiotypic antibody, which mimics the configuration of the cocaine molecule (Ab 2 β), could be successfully used instead of cocaine. Two cocaine conjugates that presented different areas of the cocaine molecule to the immune system were used to produce monoclonal antibodies specific for cocaine (Ab 1). Several anti-idiotypic antibodies were then produced. Four were identified as Ab 2 β, or internal images of the antigen; when injected into BALB/c mice, they elicited an anticocaine response. The anticocaine response elicited by one of the four Ab 2 β (K 1 – 4 c) was sufficient to significantly reduce the level of cocaine that targeted the brain following cocaine challenge, compared with the level of cocaine found in the brain of control animals immunized with irrelevant antibody. In conclusion, the possibility of an <b>anti-idiotypic</b> <b>vaccine</b> seems to be worth pursuing...|$|R
40|$|MUC 1 is a {{membrane}} bound, polymorphic epithelial mucin expressed at the luminal {{surface of}} glandular epithelium. It is highly expressed in an underglycosylated form on carcinomas and metastatic lesions and is, therefore, a potential target for immunotherapy of cancer. The monoclonal antibody HMFG 1 binds the linear core protein sequence, PDTR, {{contained within the}} immunodominant domain of the tandem repeat of MUC 1. The efficacy of murine and humanized HMFG 1 (Ab 1) used as an <b>anti-idiotypic</b> <b>vaccine</b> was examined in mice transgenic for human MUC 1 (MUC 1. Tg) challenged with murine epithelial tumour cells transfected with human MUC 1. Humoral idiotypic cascade through Ab 2 and Ab 3 antibodies was observed in MUC 1. Tg mice following multiple antibody inoculations {{in the presence of}} adjuvant. Impaired tumour growth at day 35 and highest Ab 3 levels were found in mice that had received mHMFG 1 with RAS adjuvant. However, comparison of Ab 3 levels in individual mice with tumour size in all treatment groups did not show a correlation between smaller tumours and increased levels of anti-idiotype antibody. This suggests that the anti-tumour effects of anti-idiotype vaccination are not solely related to the induction of idiotypic antibody cascades and probably involve other mechanisms. © 2000 Cancer Research Campaig...|$|R
40|$|<b>Synthetic</b> <b>anti-idiotypic</b> {{antibodies}} {{represent a}} potentially valuable {{tool for the}} isolation and characterization of B cells that produce xenoantibodies. An anti-idiotypic antibody that binds to a subset of B cells producing antibodies encoded by the variable-region heavy chain 3 (VH 3) germline genes DP 35 [immunoglobulin variable-region heavy chain 3 - 11 (IGHV 3 - 11) ], DP- 53 and DP- 54 plus {{a small number of}} VH 4 gene-encoded antibodies in humans has recently been identified. These germline progenitors also encode xenoantibodies in humans. We tested whether the small, clearly defined group of B cells identified with this anti-idiotypic antibody produce xenoantibodies in non-human primates mounting active immune responses to porcine xenografts. Peripheral blood B cells were sorted by flow cytometry on the basis of phenotype, and cDNA libraries were prepared from each of these sorted groups of cells. Immunoglobulin VH gene libraries were prepared from the sorted cells, and the VH genes expressed in each of the sorted groups were identified by nucleic acid sequencing. Our results indicate that xenoantibody-producing peripheral blood B cells, defined on the basis of binding to fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) -conjugated galactose α(1, 3) galactose–bovine serum albumin (Gal-BSA) and the anti-idiotypic antibody 2 G 10, used the IGHV 3 - 11 germline gene to encode xenoantibodies and were phenotypically CD 11 b+ (Mac- 1 +) and CD 5 –. This novel reagent may be used in numerous applications including definition of xenoantibody-producing B-cell subsets in humans and non-human primates and immunosuppression by depletion of B cells producing anti-Gal xenoantibodies...|$|R
40|$|Antibodies against conserved epitopes on HIV- 1 {{envelope}} glycoproteins (Env), {{such as the}} gp 120 CD 4 -binding site (CD 4 bs), {{could contribute}} to protection against HIV- 1. Env-based immunogens inducing such a response could be {{a major component of}} future anti-HIV- 1 strategies. In this proof-of-concept study we describe the generation of two anti-idiotype (AI) murine antibodies mimicking the CD 4 bs epitope. Sera were collected from long-term non-progressor patients to obtain CD 4 bs-directed IgG, through sequential purification steps. The purified IgG were then used as Fab fragments to immunize mice for hybridoma generation. Two hybridomas (P 1 and P 2), reacting only against the CD 4 bs-directed IgG, were identified and characterized. The P 1 and P 2 antibodies were shown to recognize the idiotype of the broadly neutralizing anti-CD 4 bs human mAb b 12. Both P 1 and P 2 Fabs were able to induce a strong anti-gp 120 response in rabbits. Moreover, the rabbits' sera were shown to neutralize two sensitive tier 1 strains of HIV- 1 in an Env-pseudotype neutralization assay. In particular, 3 / 5 rabbits in the P 1 group and 1 / 5 in the P 2 group showed greater than 80 % neutralizing activity against the HXB 2 pseudovirus. Two rabbits also neutralized the pseudovirus HIV-MN. Overall, these data describe the first <b>anti-idiotypic</b> <b>vaccine</b> approach performed to generate antibodies to the CD 4 bs of the HIV- 1 gp 120. Although future studies will be necessary to improve strength and breadth of the elicited neutralizing response, this proof-of-concept study documents that immunogens designed on the idiotype of broadly neutralizing Abs are feasible and could help in the design of future anti-HIV strategies...|$|R
40|$|Background: 1 E 10 {{monoclonal}} antibody is a murine anti-idiotypic antibody that mimics N-glycolyl-GM 3 gangliosides. This antibody {{has been tested}} as an <b>anti-idiotypic</b> cancer <b>vaccine,</b> adjuvated in Al(OH) 3, in several clinical trials for melanoma, breast, and lung cancer. During early clinical development this mAb was obtained in vivo from mice ascites fluid. Currently, the production process of 1 E 10 is being transferred from the in vivo to a bioreactor-based method. Results: Here, we present a comprehensive molecular and immunological characterization of 1 E 10 produced by the two different production processes {{in order to determine}} the impact of the manufacturing process in vaccine performance. We observed differences in glycosylation pattern, charge heterogeneity and structural stability between in vivo-produced 1 E 10 and bioreactor-obtained 1 E 10. Interestingly, these modifications had no significant impact on the immune responses elicited in two different animal models. Conclusions: Changes in 1 E 10 primary structure like glycosylation; asparagine deamidation and oxidation affected 1 E 10 structural stability but did not affect the immune response elicited in mice and chickens when compared to 1 E 10 produced in mice.

40|$|Since the {{discovery}} of tumor-associated antigens (TAA), researchers have tried to develop immune-based anti-cancer therapies. Thanks to their specificity, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) offer the major advantage to induce fewer side effects than those caused by non-specific conventional treatments (eg. chemotherapy, radiotherapy). Passive immunotherapy by means of mAbs or cytokines has proved efficacy in oncology and validated the use of immune-based agents as part of anti-cancer treatment options. The {{next step was to}} try to induce an active immune protection aiming to boost own’s host immune defense against TAAs. Cancer vaccines are thus developed to specifically induce active immune protection targeting only tumor cells while preserving normal tissues from a non-specific toxicity. But, as most of TAAs are self antigens, an immune tolerance against them exists representing a barrier to effective vaccination against these oncoproteins. One promising approach to break this immune tolerance consists in the use of anti-idiotypic mAbs, so called Ab 2, as antigen surrogates. This vaccination strategy allows also immunization against non-proteic antigens (such as carbohydrates). In some clinical studies, <b>anti-idiotypic</b> (anti-Id) cancer <b>vaccines</b> indeed induced efficient humoral and/or cellular immune responses associated with clinical benefit. This review article will focus on recent achievements of anti-Id mAbs use as cancer vaccines in solid tumors...|$|R
40|$|Targeting of {{antibodies}} {{has found}} a number of applications in assays, <b>anti-idiotypic</b> therapies and <b>vaccine</b> design {{with a number of}} anti-idiotypic Abs generated and used in clinical applications, and some currently in clinical trials. Meanwhile, aptamers are a novel and particularly interesting targeting modality, with a unique ability to bind to a variety of targets. Aptamers offer unique benefits compared to other targeting agents, due to their high affinity and selectivity, relatively small size and in vitro synthesis, making them attractive alternatives to Abs and peptides. Aptamers have already been selected against a number of Abs for various applications. We now present a novel methodology for the selection of aptamers against Abs, which minimises the number of steps used and results in molecules that bind to the target Ab with high affinity and specificity. We have used the well-characterised anti-MUC 1 monoclonal Ab C 595 as an exemplar for raising aptamers against Abs. The methodology is based on the adsorption of the Ab to the surface of a PCR tube and the performance of SELEX selections in the PCR tube, based on elution steps resulting from the denaturation of the Ab on the first PCR amplification cycle. After 10 rounds of selection and amplification, selected aptamers have been characterised using a number of techniques, including fluorescence quenching, ELISA and competition ELISA procedures and a FRET type assay. Aptamers were found to bind their target Ab with a higher affinity than its natural antigenic peptide, as observed in fluorescent quenching and FRET experiments. Furthermore, they were able to displace the antigens from the antibody binding pocket in competition assays. This methodology offers the possibility of rapidly selecting aptamers for antibody targeting that could be used as diagnostic, imaging or therapeutic agents, or as recognition units in immunoassays, and can be potentially useful in raising aptamers against other protein targets...|$|R
