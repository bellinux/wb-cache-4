5|$|The {{pectoral}} girdle is well known. Both {{the left and}} right scapulae and coracoids are known, though incomplete. The scapulae are large, and robust, and thicken as they near the glenoids. The <b>scapular</b> blades are flat, although they are both convex along the anterior edge. Where the scapulae and coracoids articulate, the coracoids are thickest, and they become gradually thinner as they gain distance from the scapulae. The younger specimen of Patagosaurus possesses a slightly different morphology of the {{pectoral girdle}}, with slightly differing proportions, such as a slightly smaller <b>scapular</b> blade. The coracoids resemble Barapasaurus in shape, and differ from Camarasaurus, although they cannot be directly compared with those of Cetiosaurus.|$|E
5|$|Five Maryland {{players were}} {{selected}} by postseason all-star games. Defensive lineman Jeremy Navarre {{appeared in the}} Texas vs. The Nation Game. Offensive linemen Edwin Williams and Jaimie Thomas participated in the East-West Shrine Game. Linebacker Moise Fokou played in the Under Armour Senior Bowl. Kevin Barnes was also selected {{to participate in the}} Senior Bowl very early in the season before he suffered a <b>scapular</b> fracture. He attended the game, but did not play due to his injury.|$|E
5|$|House sparrows {{sleep with}} the bill tucked {{underneath}} the <b>scapular</b> feathers. Outside of the reproductive season, they often roost communally in trees or shrubs. Much communal chirping occurs {{before and after the}} birds settle in the roost in the evening, as well as before the birds leave the roost in the morning. Some congregating sites separate from the roost may be visited by the birds prior to settling in for the night.|$|E

5|$|The artery has a {{variable}} origin. It mostly {{arises from the}} brachiocephalic trunk, but may also originate from the aortic arch, the right common carotid, the subclavian, the pericardiacophrenic artery, the thyrocervical trunk, the transverse <b>scapular</b> or the internal thoracic artery. It ascends {{in front of the}} trachea in the superior mediastinum to {{the lower part of the}} thyroid gland.|$|E
5|$|However, the {{proximal}} series {{can be directly}} compared to the ulnare and intermedium of tetrapods. The fin was clearly weight bearing, being attached to a massive shoulder with expanded <b>scapular</b> and coracoid elements and attached to the body armor, large muscular scars on the ventral surface of the humerus, and highly mobile distal joints. The bones of the forefins show large muscle facets, suggesting that the fin was both muscular and {{had the ability to}} flex like a wrist joint. These wrist-like features would have helped anchor the creature to the bottom in fast moving current.|$|E
5|$|The forehead, lores, crown, mantle, and <b>scapular</b> {{area are}} a neutral grey colour. There is a brown {{spot on the}} nape. The top of the tail is brown, and the bottom is faintly striped brown. The bird's back and rump are striped brown-sepia, and the throat, breast, and belly are grey-white. Its lower belly and flanks are tawny. The iris is dark brown. Male {{specimens}} are distinguished by having less sharp brown spots on their napes, and {{the bottom of their}} breasts are mixed with a pale buff colour. The legs are brown on the back and whitish on the front. Young birds have a yellowish appearance with striped brown flanks.|$|E

5|$|This set of {{characters}} was identified by Le Loeuff in {{his description of}} Ampelosaurus to distinguish it from all other genera: teeth that weakly spatulate; a laterally widening distal extremity of neural spines on the dorsal vertebrae; neural arch of the dorsal vertebrae inclining strongly towards the rear; {{the lack of a}} distal expansion on the <b>scapular</b> blade; the presence of a light, ventral crest on top of the scapula; the presence of plate, bulb, and spine shaped osteoderms; and, in 2005, Le Loeuff added that the constriction of the neural spine on the dorsal and cervical vertebrae was also probably a characteristic of Ampelosaurus.|$|E
5|$|Injuries had {{devastated the}} Maryland roster the {{previous}} year, and while 2008 was more forgiving by comparison, several key players were injured. Starting cornerback Kevin Barnes suffered a season-ending <b>scapular</b> fracture against Wake Forest {{and missed the}} last six games. Sophomore LaQuan Williams and true freshman Kevin Dorsey, both wide receivers, sat out the entire season due to leg and foot injuries, respectively. Leading receiver Darrius Heyward-Bey sat out the Boston College game due to a calf injury, and leading rusher Da'Rel Scott suffered a left shoulder injury in the third game against California, which plagued him throughout the season, although he missed just one game. Running back Morgan Green, who had contended for the starting position during summer camp, had an injury-riddled season, before seeing his first real action in the bowl game. Starting quarterback Jordan Steffy was put {{out for the season}} by a thumb injury on his throwing hand in the first game.|$|E
5|$|Ironically, the {{original}} specimen {{was of the}} black-plumaged subspecies from Dirk Hartog Island, which was not recorded again for 80years. Meanwhile, the widespread blue-plumaged subspecies was discovered and described as two separate species by John Gould in 1865. He called one specimen collected from inland New South Wales the white-winged superb warbler, M. cyanotus, while another, which appeared to have a white back and wings, was described as M. leuconotus, the white-backed superb warbler. It {{was not until the}} early 20th century that both of these blue-plumaged mainland forms were found to be of a single species. George Mack, ornithologist of the National Museum of Victoria, considered the specific name leuconotus to take precedence in his 1934 revision of the genus, and more recent studies have followed suit. The back region between the shoulders is in fact bare, with feathers that arise from the shoulder (<b>scapular)</b> region and sweep inwards in different patterns. This variation confused the early naturalists who described the white-backed and blue-backed species.|$|E
5000|$|The black baza is a {{small and}} distinctively {{coloured}} raptor; it ranges from 30 to 35 cm in length, a 66 to 80 cm wingspan and a weight of 168 to 224 g.

5000|$|The [...] "monastic scapular" [...] {{appeared}} first, {{perhaps as}} early as the 7th century in the Order of Saint Benedict. It is a somewhat large length of cloth suspended both front and back from the shoulders of the wearer, often reaching to the knees. It may vary in shape, color, size and style. Monastic <b>scapulars</b> originated as aprons worn by medieval monks, and were later extended to habits for members of religious organizations, orders or confraternities. Monastic <b>scapulars</b> now form part of the habit of monks and nuns in many Christian orders.|$|R
5|$|The {{skull of}} the bowfin {{is made of}} two layers of skull, the dermatocranium and the chondrocranium. The chondrocranium layer cannot be seen because it is located below the dermal bones. The bowfin skull {{is made up of}} 28 fused bones, which compose the dermatocranium. The roof of the mouth is made up of 3 bones, the ectopterygoid, the palantine, and the vomer. The teeth are on two bones, the premaxillae and the maxillae. Another three bones make up the lower jaw the dentary, the angular, and the surangular. The cranial surface of the skull is made up of the nasals, the antorbital, the lacrimal, the parietal, the intertemporal, the post parietal, the supratemporal, the extra <b>scapular,</b> the post temporal, and the opercular. The {{entirety}} of the skull is attached to the girdle through another set of bones.|$|E
5|$|Apart from Du Tertre's crude 1667 {{drawing and}} Labat's 1722 derivative, a few {{contemporary}} paintings depict red macaws {{that may be}} the Lesser Antillean macaw. A color plate accompanying a 1765 volume of Buffon's encyclopaedia Histoire Naturelle (no. 12 in Planches Enluminées, entitled L'Ara Rouge) shows a red macaw with entirely red tail feathers and more red on the tertial and <b>scapular</b> feathers of the wing than are present on the scarlet macaw. Copies of the plate differ in the nuances used, but are identical in pattern. The painting suggests that a specimen may have been present in Europe at the time. The Swedish zoologist Carl Linnaeus cited the plate in his 1766 description of the scarlet macaw, but his description does not match the bird shown. A 1626 painting by the Dutch artist Roelant Savery, which also includes a dodo, shows a red macaw that agrees with the descriptions of the Lesser Antillean macaw. A second macaw in the painting may be the hypothetical extinct Martinique macaw (A. martinicus), but though many parrots were imported into Europe at the time from all over the world, it is impossible to determine the accuracy of such paintings today.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, McDonald {{conducted}} a phylogenetic analysis of iguanodonts incorporating data from new Eolambia specimens. Contrary to previous authors, he found instead that Eolambia was the sister group of Probactrosaurus. This close relationship {{was based on}} two shared characteristics: the quadrate being straight save for the top end, which is curved backwards; and {{the top and bottom}} margins of the <b>scapular</b> blade being nearly parallel. Wenjie Zheng and colleagues added Jintasaurus to the group in 2014, while José Gasca and colleagues recovered the original group in 2015. However, McDonald extensively revised his phylogenetic dataset further in preparation for the 2017 description of the FMNH specimens. As with Horner and colleagues, as well as Prieto-Márquez and Norell, McDonald and colleagues found that Eolambia was the sister group of Protohadros, with both of them being placed as basal hadrosauromorphs (results reproduced below). Using the 2012 version of the McDonald dataset, Francisco Verdú and colleagues independently recovered a similar result, with Eolambia being closely related to Protohadros and Jeyawati; however, McDonald and colleagues found the latter to be more derived in 2017.|$|E

5|$|In Kirkland's initial {{description}} of Eolambia, he considered {{it to be}} a member of the Hadrosauridae, as defined by David B. Weishampel, David B. Norman, and Dan Grigorescu in 1993. Weishampel and colleagues used seven unifying characteristics to define the Hadrosauridae: the upward expansion of the ascending process of the maxilla; the absence of the paraquadrate foramen, which separates the quadrate and quadratojugal; the location of the angular on the inner surface of the lower jaw; the absence of the surangular foramen on the surangular; the narrow teeth of the maxilla; the presence of three or more teeth in each dentary tooth position; and the reduction of the top margin of the <b>scapular</b> blade. The first, fifth, sixth, and seventh of these traits were recognized in Eolambia, with the rest being unknown due to missing material. Kirkland further assigned Eolambia to the Euhadrosauria, defined by Weishampel and colleagues to include the common ancestor of Hadrosaurinae (now the Saurolophinae) and Lambeosaurinae – the two primary branches of hadrosaurids – and all of its descendants. This assignment was based on five characteristics, all present in Eolambia: the presence of denticles on the premaxilla; the quadrate's narrow joint with the lower jaw; the narrow dentary teeth; the presence of a single edge, or carina, on each dentary tooth; and the angled deltopectoral crest on the humerus.|$|E
5|$|The bill of the {{specimen}} is black with a yellowish tip, and the cere is also black, with feathers {{on the upper}} side, almost to the nostrils. The lores are naked, and {{the upper part of}} the head is sooty black. The rest of the head is mostly brownish-black. The feathers of the nape and the neck are slightly bifurcated and have a dark green gloss, the latter with coppery reflections. The feathers of the neck are elongated (sometimes referred to as hackles), and some of those on the sides and lower part have paler spots near the tips. Most of the feathers on the upperparts and wings are dark brown or brownish-black with a dark green gloss. Almost all of these feathers have a triangular, yellowish-buff spot at their tips. The spots are almost whitish on some of the <b>scapular</b> feathers, vague and dark on the primary feathers. The underside of the wings is black with browner flight feathers, which have a pale spot or band at the tips. The breast is brownish-black with a faint green sheen. The tail is blackish with a dark green sheen, brownish-black on the underside, with a narrow, cinnamon-coloured band at the end. This differs from the rust-coloured tail-tip apparently shown in the drawing owned by Lever, and Latham's own illustration. The legs are small and slender, have long toes, large claws, and a comparatively short tarsus, whereas the Nicobar pigeon has shorter claws and a longer tarsus.|$|E
