For the first rotor (1), which to the operator is the right-hand rotor, the ratchet (red) is always engaged, and steps with each keypress. Here, the middle rotor (2) is engaged because the notch in the first rotor is aligned with the pawl; it will <b>step</b> (<b>turn</b> over) with the first rotor. The third rotor (3) is not engaged, because the notch in the second rotor is not aligned to the pawl, so it will not engage with the rachet.|$|E
5000|$|At 12:00 pm of 16 January 1958, the Brazilian ship Almirante Saldanha, {{taking part}} in {{projects}} of the Ano Geofísico Internacional, was preparing to sail away from Ilha de Trindade, {{off the coast of}} Espírito Santo. Captain Viegas was on the deck with several scientists and members of the crew when he suddenly noticed a flying object, which had a “ring” around it, just like Saturn. Everyone reportedly saw the UFO at the same time. It came to the island from the east, flew towards the Pico Desejado (Wished Peak), made a <b>step</b> <b>turn</b> and went away very quickly to the northwest. As soon as the object was noticed Almiro Baraúna was requested for photographing. After getting the camera and going up the quarter-deck, he stated that he managed to take pictures of the object.|$|E

30|$|Ankle {{rotations}} during straight {{walk and}} <b>step</b> <b>turn</b> were measured using a camera system {{to study the}} ankle function in the frontal plane during the turn. The ankle rotations in the frontal plane during straight walk in both slow and fast speeds were close; however, {{there was a significant}} increase in the ankle’s rotation in the IE direction during the <b>step</b> <b>turn.</b> The ankle angles in IE during the push-off increased from 2.8 ° eversion during straight walk at low speed to 10.5 ° inversion during the <b>step</b> <b>turn</b> at slow speed. These values were 2.5 ° eversion and 14.3 ° inversions during the <b>step</b> <b>turn</b> for straight walk and <b>step</b> <b>turn,</b> respectively. These changes were equivalent to 248 % and 312 % of the straight step average ROM in the frontal plane for the slow and fast speed tests, respectively. The changes observed in the angular displacement of the ankle in the frontal plane during <b>step</b> <b>turn,</b> when compared to straight walk, showed the importance of the IE rotation during turning.|$|E

30|$|Ankle {{kinematics}} in {{the frontal}} plane {{for the right}} ankle during the straight steps (Figure  2 A) in both slow and fast speeds did not differ; however, during a <b>step</b> <b>turn</b> (Figure  2 B), {{there was a significant}} increase in the ankle inversion. At straight step and low speed, the ankle was in 2.8 ° eversion during terminal stance, while during the <b>step</b> <b>turn,</b> it changed to 10.5 ° inversion. By increasing the speed, 2.5 ° eversion and 14.3 ° inversion were observed for straight step and <b>step</b> <b>turn,</b> respectively. The changes were equivalent to 248 % and 303 % of the straight step average range of motion (ROM) in the frontal plane for the slow and fast speed tests (5.37 ° ± 0.6 ° and 5.52 ° ± 0.8 °, respectively). Additionally, the average maximum angular velocities among the participants during the fast speed tests were 120 °/s in the sagittal plane and 101 °/s in the frontal plane. The maximum angular displacements were 22 ° in plantarflexion and 20 ° in inversion. These values are important since an anthropomorphic ankle-foot mechanism should be able to reproduce them. There was also an increased rotation of the ankle in IE during turning. This demonstrated the significance of controllable frontal plane rotations in an ankle-foot mechanism for improved maneuverability.|$|E
30|$|This paper {{describes}} a novel cable-driven ankle-foot mechanism with two controllable {{degrees of freedom}} (DOF) in dorsiflexion-plantarflexion (DP) and inversion-eversion (IE). The presented mechanism is a proof of concept to demonstrate feasibility. Ankle kinematic measurements demonstrate that ankle IE rotations during a <b>step</b> <b>turn</b> are significantly different from walking on a straight path. This suggests that the ankle-foot mechanisms used in prostheses, exoskeletons, and bipedal robots can be improved by controlling a second degree of freedom in the frontal plane. The proposed prototype mechanism is described in detail, and its design considerations and parameters are presented. The mechanism is capable of producing trajectories similar to the human ankle during a <b>step</b> <b>turn.</b> The device shows passive mechanical impedance close to the human ankle mechanical impedance, allowing its mechanical impedance to be controlled using an impedance controller. The presented mechanism is capable of providing key mechanical characteristics similar to the human ankle, including power, range of motion, and weight, suggesting the feasibility of this design concept.|$|E

30|$|The {{paper is}} {{structured}} as follows: first, the mechanism design {{is described in}} details. Next, a trajectory control and instrumentation necessary for a torque feedback is described. Finally, the evaluation experiments are described showing the mechanism capability for reproducing the human ankle kinematics during a <b>step</b> <b>turn.</b> Additionally, {{a comparison of the}} passive mechanical impedance of the mechanism’s ankle with the human ankle is provided.|$|E
30|$|The current {{prototype}} {{was developed}} as a proof of concept to validate the design kinematics. It uses low-cost brushed DC motors and compatible gear boxes, resulting in low bandwidth of the motors and gear box, limited efficiency and {{power to weight ratio}} of the mechanism. Even so, the mechanism was capable of reproducing the ankle rotations of a human subject during <b>step</b> <b>turn,</b> adequate torques, and desirable mechanical impedance similar to a human ankle, while weighing 3  kg. Therefore, using faster, brushless motors and sensors with lower noise levels in future designs will increase the efficiency, power, and bandwidth, while decreasing the device’s weight.|$|E
40|$|The {{ability to}} change {{directions}} while walking is an integral component of adaptive locomotor behavior. Patients with hip osteoarthritis (OA) experience prolonged hip dysfunction. Gait compensation adopted by the patients with hip OA may become more pronounced while they turn. The {{purposes of this study}} were to identify the turning strategy while walking in patients with hip OA, and {{to examine the relationship between}} the turning strategy and the patient's functional level. Fourteen patients with hip OA and 13 age-matched healthy controls were recruited. The hip, knee, and ankle joint angles and moments, and the foot progression angle were measured under three walking conditions (straight walking, 45 ° <b>step</b> <b>turn,</b> and 45 ° crossover turn), and the gait variables for each walking condition were compared between the 2 groups. The relationship between the increasing rate of knee and ankle joint moments in the turning to the straight walking and the functional point in the Harris hip score (HHS) was examined. The OA group showed decreased hip flexion, extension, and abduction angles, and hip flexion moment during the <b>step</b> <b>turn,</b> and decreased hip flexion, extension, and adduction angles, and hip abduction moment during the crossover turn. Furthermore, the ankle plantarflexion moment and the change in the foot angle during the stance phase were significantly increased during the crossover turn in the OA group. The increasing rate of the ankle plantarflexion moment correlated significantly with the functional point in the HHS. Patients with hip OA rely primarily on the ankle plantarflexors to compensate for the hip dysfunction while changing the walking direction...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} improve the speed and {{reproducibility}} of restoring the beam in the Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility (CEBAF) 45 MeV injector [1] after a full or partial shutdown of the accelerator, a program has been written using the Tcl/Tk [2] scripting language to automate most of the required steps. The procedure is separated into four main parts. The first part performs preliminary checks that verify that the hardware is set correctly and then turns on the main interlocked systems including high power magnets and RF. The second <b>step</b> <b>turns</b> on the gun high voltage. The final <b>steps</b> <b>turn</b> on the beam and verify that the beam quality is satisfactory by measuring the transmission, orbit, transverse beam size, and bunch length. Minor corrections for phasing are also performed in the program.

This paper describes the software implementation, the logic to achieve a successful startup, and efficiency results. ...|$|R
