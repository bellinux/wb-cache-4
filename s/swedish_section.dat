25|$|In February 1945, {{the head}} of the Swedish office of the WJC, Hilel Storch, {{established}} contact through an intermediary with SS chief Heinrich Himmler. In April, Norbert Masur of the <b>Swedish</b> <b>Section</b> of the WJC secretly met with Himmler at Harzfeld, around 70 kilometers north of Berlin. Masur had been promised safe conduct by Himmler. Through negotiations with the Nazi leader and the subsequent talks with {{the head of}} the Swedish Red Cross, Folke Bernadotte, the WJC was allowed to save 4,500 inmates from the women's concentration camp at Ravensbrück. Approximately half of these women, who had been deported to Germany from over forty countries, were Jewish.|$|E

40|$|Which factors best {{explain the}} {{regional}} variation in sick-listing and early retirement? Data from the Swedish Social Insurance Agency is fitted against variables describing different regional characteristics {{that have been}} linked to sickness insurance consumption in the literature. Results, in line with earlier empirical investigation, suggest that particularly the employment rate, the populations‟ age, and its wealth are strong determinants of regional insurance usage. Two further factors, though less discussed in the literature, appear to have some relevance as well: A high share of large workplaces is found to predict higher rates of early retirement, while a large share of foreign-born predict lower sick-listing rates. Both effects have been found before, though the first one perhaps not in <b>Swedish</b> cross <b>section</b> analysis and the latter {{does not appear to be}} well understood in the literature. A tentative explanation for it is given here...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{studies of}} {{limestone}} beds of mid-Ordovician age from both Sweden and China {{show that the}} Earth saw an at least two orders of magnitude increase in the influx of extraterrestrial material approximately 470 Ma, following the disruption of an L-chondrite parent body in the asteroid belt. Recovered extraterrestrial material consists of fossil meteorites and sediment-dispersed extraterrestrial chromite (SEC) grains, both with L-chondritic origin. Ne isotope analysis of SEC grains {{from one of the}} <b>Swedish</b> limestone <b>sections</b> revealed {{that the vast majority of}} the grains were delivered to Earth as micrometeorites. In this study, we extend the previous work, both in time and geographically, by measuring concentrations and isotopic ratios of Ne in individual SEC grains (60120 mu m in diameter) from three different beds from a contemporary Middle Ordovician limestone section in China. All of the Chinese SEC grains, 44 in total, contain surface-implanted Ne of fractionated solar wind composition, implying that these grains were, as in the case of the Swedish SEC grains, delivered to Earth as micrometeorites. This gives further compelling evidence that the two to three orders of magnitude increase in the influx of micrometeoritic material following the breakup of the L-chondrite parent body was indeed a global event. The rain of micrometeorites prevailed for at least 2 Myr (the estimated time of the deposition of the topmost Chinese bed) after the breakup event...|$|R

40|$|Mathematical and {{simulation}} models of systems {{lay at the}} core of decision support systems, and their role become more critical as more complex is the system object of decision. The decision process usually encompasses the optimization of some utility function that evaluates the performance indicators that measure the impacts of the decisions. An increasing difficulty directly related to the complexity of the system arises when the associated function to be optimized is a not analytical, non-differentiable, non-linear function which can only be evaluated by simulation. Simulation-Optimization techniques are especially suited in these cases and its use is increasing in traffic models, an archetypic case of complex, dynamic systems exhibiting highly stochastic characteristics. In this approach simulation is used to evaluate the objective function, and a non-differentiable optimization technique to solve the optimization problem is used. Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation (SPSA) {{is one of the most}} popular of these techniques. This thesis analyzes, discusses and presents computational results for the application of this technique to the calibration of a traffic simulation model of a <b>Swedish</b> highway <b>section.</b> Variants of the SPSA, replacing the usual gradient approach by a combination of normalized parameters and penalized objective function, have been proposed in this study due to an exhaustive analysis of the behavior of classical SPSA where problems arose from different magnitude variables. In this work, a varied set of Software environments have been used, combining RStudio for the analysis, Python and MATLAB for the SPSA implementation, AIMSUN as a Traffic Model Simulator, and SQLite for obtaining of simulated data and Tableau for visualizing data and results...|$|R
50|$|After {{stays in}} Zwickau, Hof, Karlsruhe and Strasbourg, Semper {{eventually}} ended {{up back in}} Paris, like many other disillusioned Republicans from the 1848 Revolutions (such as Heinrich Heine and Ludwig Börne). In the fall of 1850, he travelled to London, England. But while {{he was able to}} pick up occasional contracts — including participation {{in the design of the}} funeral carriage for the Duke of Wellington and the designs of the Canadian, Danish, <b>Swedish,</b> and Ottoman <b>sections</b> of the 1851 Exhibition in the Crystal Palace — he found no steady employment. If his stay in London was disappointing professionally, however, it proved a fertile period for Semper's theoretical, creative and academic development. He published Die vier Elemente der Baukunst (The Four Elements of Architecture) in 1851 and Wissenschaft, Industrie und Kunst (Science, Industry and Art) in 1852. These works would ultimately provide the groundwork for his most widely regarded publication, Der Stil in den technischen und tektonischen Künsten oder Praktische Ästhetik, which was published in two volumes in 1861 and 1863.|$|R

Six fireworks were launched, forcing referee Martin Hansson to abandon the match. According to Canal+, one of the fireworks was close to hitting a photographer. There were different opinions as to where the fireworks came from: Canal+ believed that the fireworks came from the section above the Djurgården terrace while the police believed that the fireworks came from within the Djurgården <b>section.</b> <b>Swedish</b> Discipline Committee chairman Khennet Thallinger stated that they [...] "want to preserve the due process".

40|$|Mid-Ordovician fossil meteorites {{found in}} the Thorsberg quarry, {{southern}} Sweden, {{are believed to have}} been deposited during a period of enhanced meteorite flux following the fragmentation of the L chondrite parent body. During diagenesis, the fossil meteorites were largely replaced by a secondary mineral assemblage. However, primary chromite grains have been preserved. High-precision oxygen isotope analysis by laser-assisted fluorination has been undertaken in order to confirm the chemical group (11, L or LL) to which the fossil meteorites belong. To test our methodology, chromites extracted from recent ordinary chondrite falls (Holbrook L 6, Appley Bridge LL 6 and Kernouve H 6) have been analyzed and these show that ordinary chondrites can be classified into their respective groups (H, L, or LL) using the oxygen isotopic composition of chromite alone. Results from the Golvsten 001 meteorite demonstrate that this sample is an equilibrated L chondrite. The uniform major and minor element composition of chromites throughout the southern <b>Swedish</b> fossil meteorite <b>section</b> means that it is highly probable that all are L chondrites. High-precision oxygen isotope analysis of relict chromites thus further strengthens the link between the fossil meteorites and the disruption of the L chondrite parent body. The evidence presented here demonstrates that relict chromite grains survive diagenesis and can be used to classify ancient meteoritic material. Analysis of such fossil grains may prove to be a powerful tool, not only {{in the case of the}} mid-Ordovician event, but also in examining changes in the relative distribution of meteorite groups throughout geological time.
