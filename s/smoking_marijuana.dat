40|$|The Author(s) 2014. This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Abstract Habitual <b>smoking</b> of <b>marijuana</b> {{is associated with}} multiple respiratory symptoms such as cough, sputum pro-duction, and wheezing. These symptoms are {{not significantly different from}} those exhibited by tobacco smokers. Further-more, endobronchial biopsies of habitual smokers of marijua-na and /or tobacco have shown that both <b>marijuana</b> and cigarette <b>smoking</b> cause significant bronchial mucosal histo-pathology and that these effects are additive. Although mari-juana smokers have minimal changes in pulmonary function studies as compared to tobacco smokers, they may develop bullous disease and spontaneous pneumothoraces. The rela-tionship between <b>marijuana</b> <b>smoking</b> and lung cancer remains unclear due to design limitations of the studies published so far. These findings should warn individuals that <b>marijuana</b> <b>smoking</b> may result in serious short-term and long-term respi-ratory complications, and habitual marijuana use should be viewed with caution. The medical literature so far does not support routine evaluation by pulmonary function tests or imaging studies; until more definitive data is available, we do not recommend the regular use of these tests in the evalu-ation of habitual marijuana smokers...|$|R

40|$|Background: The active {{ingredients}} of marijuana may have beneficial {{properties in the}} treatment of chronic pain and inflammation and is being used by sufferers of chronic pain and arthritis in some settings. Anecdotally, marijuana is believed by some sickle cell disease (SCD) patients to improve their health. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of <b>marijuana</b> <b>smoking</b> in the Jamaica Sickle Cell Cohort Study (JSCCS) in the years 2000 and 2004. The perception that marijuana use ameliorated the complications of SCD was also investigated. Methods: All patients in the JSCCS were invited to attend an annual review, and during the 2000 and 2004 reviews, participants with homozygous sickle cell (SS) disease and sickle cell haemoglobin-C (SC) disease were asked whether they smoked marijuana, and if they smoked, whether it was used for medicinal purposes related to SCD. The authors compared smoking prevalence by gender, disease, and year of review. The association of smoking with a measure of pain frequency was also examined. Results: The prevalence of <b>marijuana</b> <b>smoking</b> was higher among men and among SC participants. The proportion of either gender reporting <b>smoking</b> of <b>marijuana</b> increased in 2004 compared to 2000, and this use was not related to a simple measure of clinical severity of SCD.
