In addition to Vice Mayor Vidrașcu, it included old unionist combatants (Vladimir Chiorescu, Elefterie Sinicliu) and Odessan notabilities (Dr. M. Zaevloshin, architect Vladimir Cundert). Reportedly, City Hall did not exercise political repression against known communists, who were merely required to register on a <b>special</b> <b>list.</b> The Romanian Mayor was also careful to preserve contacts with the two most powerful forces battling each other for control, namely the Germans and the Soviet partisans.

500|$|The game {{received}} strong {{reviews and}} publicity from other video gaming magazines at the time. In a review from VideoGames & Computer Entertainment, the presentation and gameplay {{was compared to}} Castlevania, while the cinematic cutscenes were compared favorably to Karateka and other computer games by Cinemaware. The review praised the game's animation in these cutscenes and noted Tecmo's usage of close-ups and body movements. The reviewer {{said that while the}} cutscenes were not fluid, they were effective and entertaining and gave important information as to what the player was supposed to do. He appreciated that the game had unlimited continues which slightly offset its difficulty, but he criticized it for having overdetailed background graphics especially in the indoor levels, saying that some bottomless pits and items in these levels become slightly camouflaged. From July to October 1989, the game was listed at No. 1 on Electronic Gaming Monthlys [...] "Top Ten Video Games" [...] list; it fell to No. 2 on the list behind Mega Man 2 in the following November issue. In their [...] "Best and Worst of 1989", it received awards for [...] "Best Game of the Year" [...] for the NES and [...] "Best Ending in a Video Game" [...] for all consoles. The staff said that Ninja Gaiden [...] "proved to be an instant winner" [...] with its cinematic cutscenes and unique gameplay. They added that the game's climax was better than some movies' climaxes at the time and that it established continuity for a sequel, which would be released the following year. Later in June 1994, the magazine ranked it at No. 4 in a <b>special</b> <b>list</b> of [...] "Top Ten Most Difficult Games" [...] of all time for all consoles.|$|E

40|$|This article {{examines}} whether enhanced corporate governance practices, auditing {{by one of}} the Big Four and qualified auditors’ opinions, are associated with the propensity to engage in earnings management through accounting choices or operational decisions in Brazil. Although there are some studies on earnings management by Brazilian companies, very few have examined the presence of operational decisions in this practice and none has addressed how to minimize this. In order to infer earnings manipulation by accounting choices and operational decisions, we investigate if firms that manage earnings through discretionary accruals also make operational decisions for the same purpose. The evidence from a sample of Brazilian firms suggests that listing on the São Paulo Stock Exchange´s Corporate Governance <b>Special</b> <b>Listing</b> Segments, which requires enhanced corporate governance practices, among other requirements, and auditing {{by one of the}} Big Four firms reduce in general earnings management by accounting choices, and that qualified opinion from auditor  is an indicator of earnings management.
