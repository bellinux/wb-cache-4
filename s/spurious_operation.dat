40|$|Abstract — Standby {{redundant}} systems are often adopted in critical {{applications such as}} the Emergency Shutdown Systems (ESDS) in Nuclear Power Plants (NPPs). One failure mode of the standby {{redundant systems}} {{is that they are}} not available when there is a demand. This is a serious safety issue. Another failure mode of the standby safety critical systems is that they function spuriously when there is actually no need. Once this occurs, the normal plant operation will be interrupted; certain equipment could be damaged; and restarting the plant could be very costly. The objective {{of this paper is to}} evaluate the unavailability and the probability of <b>spurious</b> <b>operation</b> of k-outof-n systems when they are subjected to both independent and Common Cause Failures (CCFs). A load-strength interference model is adopted for CCF analysis. A data mapping technique is utilized when there is no data available for a specific system. It is concluded quantitatively that the k-out-of-n system has a lower unavailability but a higher probability of <b>spurious</b> <b>operation</b> than the k-out-of-(n − 1) system, under both independent failure and CCFs. This result complies with common sense and practical experience. The two different configurations adopted in different types of NPPs, the 2 -out-of- 3 system and the 2 -out-of- 4 system, are used to demonstrate the theoretical analyses that are developed in this paper. However, due to the lack of lack of relevant data, the analysis of probability of <b>spurious</b> <b>operation</b> under CCFs are only explained in a qualitative manner...|$|E

Safety relevant operating experiences and accident information are discussed. Quantitative order-of-magnitude estimates of fire protection system component failure rates and fire accident initiating event frequencies are presented for use in risk assessment, reliability, and availability studies.

40|$|The {{research}} investigates {{reactive power}} compensation and protection of shunt capacitor banks. The characteristics of capacitors including, formulae, design, manufacturing, and testing is presented. Capacitor units using extended foil solder type elements have losses as low as 0. 1 watt/kVAr. Failure of capacitors generally occurs due to overvoltage stress. The type and aging properties of the dielectric determines the lifespan of the capacitor. Polypropylene film is commonly used as the dielectric. Basic capacitor bank design calculations are presented. A detailed discussion on the configurations and protection philosophies is described for single star earthed, single star H-bridge, double star, and C-type filter H-bridge capacitor banks. A novel approach to unbalance voltage detection {{and the protection of}} fuseless single star earthed shunt capacitor banks is investigated, engineered and tested. This methodology explores the potential evolution towards distributed protection. This involves two programmed multifunction protection relays communicating via the IEC 61850 Ethernet protocol. One relay receives voltage measurements from the high voltage busbar. The other relay receives voltage measurements from the low voltage capacitor tap point. The two relays share their measurements via the Ethernet link. The difference in measurements is used to initiate alarm and trip operations. The relay protection function satisfies criterion for reset-ability, selectivity, stability, accuracy, and loss of potential blocking. <b>Spurious</b> <b>operation</b> occurs when the Total Harmonic Distortion level is above 8...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — In this paper, 1 {{we present}} a power-management {{methodology}} targeted toward high-level synthesis of data-dominated behavioral descriptions. It is founded on the observation that variable assignment can significantly affect power-management opportunities in the synthesized architecture, i. e., variable assignment determines whether or not <b>spurious</b> <b>operations</b> get executed by functional units in the architecture. We introduce perfectly power managed architectures, whose functional units do not execute any <b>spurious</b> <b>operations.</b> We present a variable assignment technique which, when used in high-level synthesis, produces architectures which are perfectly power-managed. Unlike many previously proposed power-management techniques, our method does not add latches or any other circuitry in front of functional units or registers and is, therefore, free of the attendant performance penalty. Experimental results indicate savings of up to 52. 5 % (average 23. 0 %) in power consumption over already power-optimized architectures. The area overheads due to our technique are also low and averaged 2. 5 % for our examples. Index Terms—Digital system design, high-level synthesis, power management, register sharing. I...|$|R
40|$|Under {{existing}} probabilistic {{risk assessment}} (PRA) methods, {{the analysis of}} fire-induced circuit faults has typically been conducted on a simplistic basis. While exceptions do exist, a typical fire PRA will assume that given damage to any power or control cables, the associated circuits simply become unavailable. This approach does not address, for example, the potential that certain failures might cause spurious component actuations. In particular, certain cable failure modes, referred to as hot shorts, might lead to <b>spurious</b> <b>operations.</b> Those fire PRAs that have considered potential <b>spurious</b> <b>operations</b> have relied on methodologies that have significant uncertainties {{with regard to the}} scope of the assessments, the underlying methods, and the assumptions employed. Nonetheless, some of these fire PRAs have shown that cable hot shorts can be a significant risk contributor. This report describes the results of a task to address weaknesses in existing fire PRA circuit analysis methods. An extensive review of available cable failure data has been performed and the current state of knowledge regarding cable failure modes and likelihood is characterized. A framework for advanced methods of cable failure mode and likelihood analysis is also presented. Advanced tools for performing PRA circuit analysis that explicitly treat different cable failure modes and the resulting circuit and system impac...|$|R
40|$|The k-out-of-n {{configuration}} is {{a widely}} adopted structure for partially redundant safety systems. This configuration ensures {{a high level of}} reliability and safety with limited financial and space resources. It also facilitates on-line Test and Maintenance (T&M) without having to shut the system down. One question a decision maker needs to answer when adopting k-out-of-n systems is: what is the best configuration for the application, i. e., how many channels in total need to be utilized and among these channels, how many channels need to function simultaneously in order for the system to function. There are various factors to consider in order to make this decision. This paper looks at this problem from a reliability engineers point of view. A quantitative analysis is performed for both unavailability and probability of <b>spurious</b> <b>operation</b> due to independent failure. In particular, the relative gain Preprint submitted to Elsevier Science 2 October 2006 and/or loss of these quantities that occurs due to changing from one configuration to another are compared through rigorous mathematical analysis. The results provide important information that can be used when choosing system configurations to meet regulatory requirements and financial constraints. The two different configurations for shutdown systems in Nuclear Power Plants, the 2 -out-of- 3 system and the 2 -out-of- 4 system, are utilized as an example to illustrate the theoretical results...|$|E

40|$|In this {{dissertation}} {{the feasibility}} of creating a page-cache efficient storage- and messaging solution with integrity geared access control for a scalable forensic framework is researched. The Open Computer Forensics Architecture (OCFA),a lab-side scalable computer forensics framework, introduced {{the concept of a}} message passing concurrency based forensic framework. Since then, the amount of per-investigation data to be processed in a lab environment has continued to grow significantly while available RAM and CPU processing power combined with prohibitive cost and limited capacity of SSD solutions have shifted processing from being largely CPU constrained to being much more IO constrained. OCFA suffered from several page-cache-miss related performance issues that have grown more significant {{as a result of this}} shift. In the light of anti-forensics and general issues related to process integrity, OCFA did not leverage the power of its message passing based design to address integrity concerns. The main purpose of this dissertation is to analyze and evaluate a number of page-cache friendly technologies that could contribute to the creation of a computer forensics lab-geared scalable message-passing-concurrency based forensic framework with a significantly reduced quantity of page-cache-miss induced <b>spurious</b> IO <b>operations,</b> taking into account integrity related issues. Provenance logs from historic investigations conducted using the Open Computer Forensics Architecture were thoroughly analyzed in this study, during which several bottlenecks and design flaws in OCFA were identified. A number of strategies were devised to address these bottlenecks in future computer forensic frameworks. Finally, the most prominently page-cache related strategies were consolidated with access-control measures into a user-space file-system and low-level API prototype.
