40|$|Most <b>soft</b> <b>drinks</b> are acidic in nature. Regular {{consumption}} of these drinks {{may result in}} dental erosion. The aim of this in vitro study was to evaluate the erosive potential of different <b>soft</b> <b>drinks</b> in Taiwan by a novel multiple erosive method. Methods: Four commercially available <b>soft</b> <b>drinks</b> in Taiwan were selected for this study. The properties of each product were analyzed to measure their pH, titratable acidity, and ion contents. The erosive potential of the <b>soft</b> <b>drinks</b> was measured based {{on the amount of}} loss of human enamel surface following its exposure to the <b>soft</b> <b>drinks</b> tested for different periods (20 minutes, 60 minutes, and 180 minutes). The enamel loss was measured using a confocal laser scanning microscope. Results: The pH values of the <b>soft</b> <b>drinks</b> were below the critical pH value (5. 5) for enamel demineralization, and ranged from 2. 42 to 3. 46. The drink with ingredients of citric acid and ascorbic acid had the highest titratable acidity (33. 96  mmol OH–/L to pH 5. 5 and 71. 9  mmol OH–/L to pH 7). Exposure to all the <b>soft</b> <b>drinks</b> resulted in loss of human enamel surface (7. 28 – 34. 07  μm for 180 -minute exposure). The beverage with the highest calcium content had the lowest erosive potential. Conclusion: All tested <b>soft</b> <b>drinks</b> were found to be erosive. <b>Soft</b> <b>drinks</b> with high calcium contents have significantly lower erosive potential. Low pH value and high citrate content may cause more surface enamel loss. As the erosive time increased, the titratable acidity to pH 7 may be a predictor of the erosive potential for acidic <b>soft</b> <b>drinks.</b> The erosive potential of the <b>soft</b> <b>drinks</b> may be predicted based on the types of acid content, pH value, titratable acidity, and ion concentration...|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigated}} whether the Portuguese population {{is at risk}} of exceeding ADI levels for acesulfame-K, saccharin, aspartame, caffeine, benzoic and sorbic acid through an assessment of dietary intake of additives and specific consumption of four types of beverages, traditional <b>soft</b> <b>drinks</b> and <b>soft</b> <b>drinks</b> based on mineral waters, energetic drinks, and nectars. The highest mean levels of additives were found for caffeine in energetic drinks, 293. 5 mg/L, for saccharin in traditional <b>soft</b> <b>drinks,</b> 18. 4 mg/L, for acesulfame-K and aspartame in nectars, with 88. 2 and 97. 8 mg/L, respectively, for benzoic acid in traditional <b>soft</b> <b>drinks,</b> 125. 7 mg/L, and for sorbic acid in <b>soft</b> <b>drinks</b> based on mineral water, 166. 5 mg/L. Traditional <b>soft</b> <b>drinks</b> presented the highest acceptable daily intake percentages (ADIs%) for acesulfame-K, aspartame, benzoic and sorbic acid and similar value for saccharin (0. 5 %) when compared with <b>soft</b> <b>drinks</b> based on mineral water, 0. 7 %, 0. 08 %, 7. 3 %, and 1. 92 % versus 0. 2 %, 0. 053 %, 0. 6 %, and 0. 28 %, respectively.

5|$|The soft fins, skin, and {{musculature}} of {{the false}} catshark suggest a sluggish lifestyle. An enormous oil-filled liver makes up 18–25% of its total weight, allowing it to maintain near-neutral buoyancy and hover off the bottom with little effort. This species likely captures prey via quick bursts of speed, with its large mouth allowing it to consume food of considerable size. It feeds mainly on bony fishes such as cutthroat eels, grenadiers, and snake mackerel, and also takes lanternsharks, squids, octopodes, and Heterocarpus shrimp. It likely also scavenges, as examination of stomach contents have found surface-dwelling fishes such as frigate mackerel, needlefishes, and pufferfishes.

5|$|The cuisine of Rwanda {{is based}} on local staple foods {{produced}} by subsistence agriculture such as bananas, plantains (known as ibitoke), pulses, sweet potatoes, beans, and cassava (manioc). Many Rwandans do not eat meat {{more than a few}} times a month. For those who live near lakes and have access to fish, tilapia is popular. The potato, thought to have been introduced to Rwanda by German and Belgian colonialists, is very popular. Ubugari (or umutsima) is a paste made from cassava or maize and water to form a porridge-like consistency that is eaten throughout the African Great Lakes. Isombe is made from mashed cassava leaves and served with dried fish. Lunch is usually a buffet known as mélange, consisting of the above staples and sometimes meat. Brochettes are the most popular food when eating out in the evening, usually made from goat but sometimes tripe, beef, or fish. In rural areas, many bars have a brochette seller responsible for tending and slaughtering the goats, skewering and barbecuing the meat, and serving it with grilled bananas. Milk, particularly in a fermented yoghurt form called ikivuguto, is a common drink throughout the country. Other drinks include a traditional beer called urwagwa, made from sorghum or bananas, which features in traditional rituals and ceremonies. The major drinks manufacturer in Rwanda is Bralirwa, which was established in the 1950s and is now listed on the Rwandan Stock Exchange. Bralirwa manufactures <b>soft</b> <b>drink</b> products from The Coca-Cola Company, under license, including Coca-Cola, Fanta, and Sprite, and a range of beers including Primus, Mützig, Amstel, and Turbo King.

40|$|Background: High {{intake of}} fruit juices and <b>soft</b> <b>drinks</b> {{contributes}} to excessive weight gain and obesity in children.

Objectives: To study the associations: (1) of both fruit juices and <b>soft</b> <b>drinks</b> consumption with water consumption of children and (2) The associations between parenting practices towards fruit juices and <b>soft</b> <b>drinks</b> and water consumption of children. Design: Cross-sectional data from 6 to 8 year old children from seven European communities (n = 1187) were collected. Associations among fruit juices, <b>soft</b> <b>drinks,</b> the respective parenting practices and the child’s water consumption were assessed by parental questionnaires. Results: The consumption of water was inversely associated with that of <b>soft</b> <b>drinks</b> but not with the consumption of fruit juices. The child’s water intake was favorably influenced when stricter parenting practices towards <b>soft</b> <b>drinks</b> were adopted (e. g., less parental allowance, low home availability and high parental self-efficacy in managing intake). There was less influence observed of parenting practices towards fruit juices. Fruit juices were consumed more often than <b>soft</b> <b>drinks.</b> Conclusions: Low consumption of soft drinks—and not of fruit juices—was associated with high water consumption in children in the current study.
