40|$|Abstract—As the Internet {{been widely}} {{accepted}} and used, {{more and more}} critical personal information are stored on computers, security became the most significant concerns for people surfing on the Internet. Software vulnerabilities are common in computer platforms and the software flaws are often exploited to gain controls of a computer. Attacks on computers can be limited by firewall and anti-virus software. However, there is increasing ineffectiveness of these traditional malicious code detection technologies to detect and block new attacks, such as rootkits, keyboard sniffers and screen <b>scapers.</b> In this paper, we propose the idea of virtual machine monitor based system integrity checking, an approach to enforce system software assurance and increase system security. Our system demonstrated the advantages of implementing runtime integrity checking on VMM over traditional anti-virus software running on the potentially infected host and searching for specific symptoms of known virus. Our prototype {{has proven to be}} an effective kernel integrity monitor through experiments of all different types of rootkits and attacks, as the same time the overhead on both the memory bandwidth and CPU is remained low...|$|R

From the analysis of diet and of changing patterns in land use and it was concluded that the nature of stock work provided most Traditional Owners with continuous access to their traditional country and to bush foods throughout the station times. Stock work also ensured that hunting and gathering skills continued to be maintained. The analysis of material culture across the four periods demonstrates the extent to which metal and glass manufactured artifacts were recycled and utilized, particularly for the manufacture of traditional-type points and <b>scapers.</b> The number of traditional-type artefacts (including glass and metal) associated with food functions decreased across the four periods some remained in the archaeological record until the 1970 s, the end of the "station times". Artefacts believed to be associated with ceremonial activities also decreased, although the decrease was less sharp than for those associated with food, and demonstrates that cultural activities associated with ceremony and ritual also continued {{until the end of the}} "station times"...|$|R

(PDF: [URL] A summary is provided here: 	The dataset includes 10, 000 soundscapes, totals almost 30 hours and includes close to 50, 000 annotated sound events 	Complete annotations are provided in JAMS format, and simplified annotations are provided as tab-separated text files 	Every soundscape is 10 seconds long and has a background of Brownian noise resembling the typical "hum" often heard in urban environments 	Every soundscape contains between 1 - 9 sound events from the following classes: 	 		air_conditioner, car_horn, children_playing, dog_bark, drilling, engine_idling, gun_shot, jackhammer, siren and street_music 	 	 	The source material for the sound events are the clips from the UrbanSound 8 K dataset ([URL] 	URBAN-SED comes pre-sorted into three sets: train, validate and test: 	 		There are 6000 soundscapes in the training set, generated using clips from folds 1 - 6 in UrbanSound 8 K 		There are 2000 soundscapes in the validation set, generated using clips from folds 7 - 8 in UrbanSound 8 K 		There are 2000 soundscapes in the test set, generated using clips from folds 9 - 10 in UrbanSound 8 K 	 	 	Further details about how the soundscapes were generated including the distribution of sound event start times, durations, signal-to-noise ratios, pitch shifting, time stretching, and the range of sound event polyphony (overlap) can be found in Section 3 of the <b>scaper</b> paper: [URL] 	The scripts used to generated URBAN-SED using <b>scaper</b> can be found here: [URL] AUDIO FILES INCLUDED * 10, 000 synthesized soundscapes in single channel (mono), 44100 Hz, 16 -bit, WAV format. * The files are split into a training set (6000), validation set (2000) and test set (2000). ANNOTATION FILES INCLUDED The annotations list the sound events that occur in every soundscape. The annotations are "strong", meaning for every sound event the annotations include (at least) the start time, end time, and label of the sound event. Sound events come from the following 10 labels (categories) : * air_conditioner, car_horn, children_playing, dog_bark, drilling, engine_idling, gun_shot, jackhammer, siren, street_music There are two types of annotations: full annotations in JAMS format, and simplified annotations in tab-separated txt format. JAMS Annotations [...] - * The full annotations are distributed in JAMS format ([URL] * There are 10, 000 JAMS annotation files, each one corresponding to a single soundscape with the same filename (other than the extension) * Each JAMS file contains a signle annotation in scaper's custom sound_event namespace - installing <b>scaper</b> (pip install <b>scaper)</b> and importing it (import <b>scaper)</b> is required in order to load the annotation into python with jams (import jams) : jam = jams. load('soundscape_train_bimodal 0. jams'). * The value of each observation (sound event) is a dictionary storing all scaper-related sound event parameters: * label, source_file, source_time, event_time, event_duration, snr, role, pitch_shift, time_stretch. * Note: the event_duration stored in the value dictionary represents the specified duration prior to any time stretching. The actual event durtation in the soundscape is stored in the duration field of the JAMS observation. * The observations (sound events) in the JAMS annotation include both foreground sound events and the background(s). * The probabilistic <b>scaper</b> foreground and background event specifications are stored in the annotation's sandbox, allowing a complete reconstruction of the soundscape audio from the JAMS annotation (assuming access to the original source material) using <b>scaper.</b> generate_from_jams('soundscape_train_bimodal 0. jams'). * The annotation sandbox also includes additional metadata such as the total number of foreground sound events, the maximum polyphony (sound event overlap) of the soundscape and its gini coefficient (a measure of soundscape complexity). Simplified Annotations [...] * The simplified annotations are distributed as tab-separated text files. * There are 10, 000 simplified annotation files, each one corresponding to a single soundscape with the same filename (other than the extension) * Each simplified annotation has a 3 -column format (no header) : start_time, end_time, label. * Background sounds are NOT included in the simplified annotations (only foreground sound events) * No additional information is stored in the simplified events (see the JAMS annotations for more details).

" In Proceedings of the ACM on Human-Computer Interaction, 1 (1), 2017. [URL] which investigates the effects of soundscape complexity and sound visualizations on the quality and speed of annotations of sound events (i. e. start time, end time, sound class, and proximity). In this dataset, we varied the soundscape complexity along two dimensions: maximum polyphony (3 levels) and Gini polyphony (2 levels). Maximum polyphony is {{the maximum number of}} sound events that occurred simultaneously in the soundscape. Gini polyphony {{is a measure of the}} concentration of sound events. For each of the 6 (3 x 2) combinations of complexity levels, we synthesized 10 soundscapes using <b>Scaper,</b> each of which was 10 seconds long, for a total of 60 soundscapes. Each soundscape was annotated by 90 participants from Amazon's Mechanical Turk.

40|$|The {{detection}} of epistatic interactive effects of multiple genetic variants on the susceptibility of human complex diseases {{is a great}} challenge in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Although methods have been proposed to identify such interactions, {{the lack of an}} explicit definition of epistatic effects, together with computational difficulties, makes the development of new methods indispensable. In this paper, we introduce epistatic modules to describe epistatic interactive effects of multiple loci on diseases. On the basis of this notion, we put forward a Bayesian marker partition model to explain observed case-control data, and we develop a Gibbs sampling strategy to facilitate the {{detection of}} epistatic modules. Comparisons of the proposed approach with three existing methods on seven simulated disease models demonstrate the superior performance of our approach. When applied to a genome-wide case-control data set for Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD), the proposed approach successfully identifies two known susceptible loci and suggests that a combination of two other loci [...] one in the gene SGCD and the other in <b>SCAPER</b> [...] is associated with the disease. Further functional analysis supports the speculation that the interaction of these two genetic variants may be responsible for the susceptibility of AMD. When applied to a genome-wide case-control data set for Parkinson's disease, the proposed method identifies seven suspicious loci that may contribute independently to the disease...|$|E
40|$|Stridulatory organs in the {{myrmecophilous}} carabid beetle tribe Paussini {{have long}} been recognized and used as a defining character of some genera and higher level taxa, however their morphology has only roughly been described. Here, we describe the fine morphology of Paussini stridulatory organs using scanning electron (SEM) and focused ion beam (FIB) microscopy. Within this tribe, there are three types of stridulatory organs, each with different positions of the scraper (plectrum) and file (pars stridens). Type I (abdomen-femur type) {{is located on the}} abdomen (scraper) and metafemur (file) in the subtribe Paussina (sensu Geiselhardt et al., 2007, Naturwissenschaften 94 : 871 – 894). Type II (thorax-femur type) and Type III (femur-thorax type) are located on the mesothorax and mesofemur in two different genera of the subtribe Platyrhopalina, however in Euplatyrhopalus the scraper is located on the mesothorax and the file is located on the mesofemur (Type II), whereas in the genus Platyrhopalopsis the structures are reversed in that the file is located on the mesothorax and the <b>scaper</b> is located on the mesofemur (Type III). The independent evolution of three types of stridulatory organs in three lineages of Paussini suggests that acoustical communication has {{played an important role in}} the evolution of ant nest beetles. While the roles of stridulation in this group remain speculative, we verified that all three types of stridulatory organs are present in both sexes and are similar to stridulatory organs known in their host ants which also use stridulation as a method of communication. We discuss the possibility that the beetles’ stridulation could (1) facilitate their exploitation of ant colonies, and (2) be involved in mate recognition and courtship...|$|E
