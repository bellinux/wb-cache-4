5|$|Manchester City manager Brian Horton, {{his former}} captain at Luton, paid Portsmouth £750,000 for Walsh's {{services}} in March 1994. With star striker Niall Quinn out injured, City were fourth from bottom with eleven Premier League games left {{to play and}} Walsh's strike partner Uwe Rösler was also a new signing – and had yet to learn English. The pair soon built an understanding however, {{and the arrival of}} wingers Peter Beagrie and Nicky Summerbee gave City the attacking firepower to <b>steer</b> <b>clear</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> relegation zone as Walsh and Rösler scored nine goals between them in the final ten games.|$|E

25|$|Governor General the Viscount Monck had {{originally}} {{pushed for a}} distinct Canadian order of knighthood in 1867, {{to be called the}} Order of St. Lawrence. The idea was revived by Vincent Massey in 1935 and again in 1951, in between which he also suggested in 1940 a Royal Order of Canada. The Canadian Cabinet, however, never accepted these proposals, generally wishing instead to <b>steer</b> <b>clear</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> controversial topic of orders. Still, the beginnings of a distinct Canadian honours system came in March 1934, with the creation of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Long Service Medal by royal warrant of King George V, issued on the advice of the Cabinet of R. B. Bennett; {{this was the first time}} an honour specific to Canada and for service in Canada had been established by the monarch of Canada (as opposed to earlier campaign and service medals that had been issued to Canadians and British personnel alike by the British monarch). There was uncertainty amongst officials in Canada and Britain alike around how to go about creating such an honour, and delays were incurred not only as Canadian bureaucrats interpreted the Nickle Resolution as applying to medals, but also because the King himself was widening the project to consider all the Commonwealth and Empire police forces.|$|E

500|$|Stephen Thomas Erlewine and Heather Phares {{wrote in}} Allmusic's {{biography}} of Pavement that, with Demolition Plot J-7, Pavement [...] "had begun to forge [...] influences {{into its own}} signature sound." [...] A review in the Baltimore City Paper likened the EP's sound to [...] "a cross between The Fall (circa Frenz Experiment) and Half Japanese". A review in LA Weekly stated that [...] "The guitar on 'Internal K-Dart' and 'Fork Lift' is patently similar to Big Black and , but Pavement <b>steer</b> <b>clear</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> former's pretentiously bleak posturing and the latter's dreary self-pity". Malkmus noted the influence that jazz musicians had on the EP's recording, and acknowledged jazz albums Interstellar Space by John Coltrane and Andrew!!! by Andrew Hill as two of his favorite records. The EP is Pavement's first to incorporate keyboards.|$|E
500|$|Prior to {{the season}} premieres of most {{television}} series in September, a common practice by television networks would be to send screeners of pilots of new shows to critics. On August 18, The CW notified critics {{that they would not}} be releasing the premiere episodes, saying, [...] " [...] have made the strategic marketing decision not to screen 90210 for any media in advance of its premiere. We're not hiding anything... simply keeping a lid on 90210 until 9.02, riding the curiosity and anticipation into premiere night, and letting all our constituents see it at the same time." [...] Oscar Dahl of BuddyTV speculated that the decision was an indication of the low quality of the episodes, but pointed out that the pilot may not have been finished in time for a screener release, which was later confirmed to be the case. Despite not having watched the episode, the Parents Television Council said in a statement that [...] "if Gossip Girl is any indication of what 90210 will look like, advertisers have plenty of reason to <b>steer</b> <b>clear</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> show... No reputable advertiser should even consider sponsoring the show without viewing the content in advance." [...] "We're Not in Kansas Anymore", along with the following episode, averaged 4.9 million viewers throughout the two-hour broadcast on September 2. This gave The CW its highest-rated premiere ever in the adults 18-49 demographic with a 2.6. By comparison, the series finale of the original series was watched by 25 million viewers on its original broadcast in May 2000.|$|E

Carena Crawford from All About Soap questioned {{whether or not the}} character was stupid.

2500|$|Upon {{his defeat}} for reelection to Congress, Richard {{returned}} to [...] "Sully" [...] {{and took over}} primary operation of his estate. Determined to <b>steer</b> <b>clear</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> untenable practices characteristic of the tobacco monoculture which predominated in Virginia, Richard, like George Washington whom he idolized, applied modern methods of farming designed to diversify production and to halt depletion of the soil. To the end he switched to growing staple crops - wheat, rye, barley, corn and timothy, fruit trees - apple to produce cider, and peach for the making of peach brandy. He planted clover to help replenish the soil and he [...] "tried crop rotation {{and the application of}} nutrients, especially crushed limestone, to fields where productivity was decreasing." [...] During this period he either abandoned or severely limited the growing of tobacco at [...] "Sully." [...] He planted large vegetable gardens and in 1801 Richard built a dairy house constructed with red Seneca stone.|$|E
2500|$|The Inquisition {{was created}} through papal bull, Ad Abolendam, issued {{at the end}} of the twelfth century by Pope Lucius III as a way to combat the Albigensian heresy in {{southern}} France. There were a huge number of tribunals of the Papal Inquisition in various European kingdoms during the Middle Ages. In the Kingdom of Aragon, a tribunal of the Papal Inquisition was established by the statute of Excommunicamus of Pope Gregory IX, in 1232, during the era of the Albigensian heresy. Although not an inquisitor, as canon lawyer and an advisor to James I of Aragon, Raymond of Penyafort was often consulted regarding questions of law regarding the practices of the Inquisition in the king's domains. [...] "...he lawyer's deep sense of justice and equity, combined with the worthy Dominican's sense of compassion, allowed him to <b>steer</b> <b>clear</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> excesses that were found elsewhere in the formative years of the inquisitions into heresy." [...] With time, its importance was diluted, and, by the middle of the fifteenth century, it was almost forgotten although still there according to the law.|$|E
