5|$|Although the Robbins Report did {{not receive}} the same {{recognition}} as the Leopold Report, it reached similar conclusions. However, unlike the Leopold Report, the Robbins Report criticized the NPS for its lack of scientific research and made recommendations for sweeping changes {{in the structure of}} the NPS, with a proposal for a strong focus on a science-based approach. In 1972, the far more detailed Cain Report was released; amounting to 207 pages in comparison to the Leopold Report's scant 28, its committee was chaired by Stanley A. Cain, who also worked on the Leopold Report. Although this report made similar recommendations to the one primarily written by Leopold, it stated that little had been done to advance the previous report's findings, especially in terms of predator control. As a result of the Cain Report's recommendations, President Richard Nixon signed Executive Order 11643, which restricted the usage of poisons such as strychnine and <b>sodium</b> <b>cyanide</b> for predator control.|$|E

40|$|The uptake and {{intracellular}} {{activity of}} AM- 1155 in murine J 774. 1 macrophages and human polymorphonuclear leukocytes were investigated. AM- 1155 penetrated phagocytic cells rapidly and reversibly, although the penetration process was {{not affected by}} metabolic inhibitors such as <b>sodium</b> fluoride, <b>cyanide</b> m-chlorophenylhydrazone, or ouabain or by nucleoside transport system inhibitors such as adenosine. The intracellular concentration-to-extracellular concentration ratio of AM- 1155 in both cell types of phagocytes ranged from 5 to 7. These ratios were almost equal to those for sparfloxacin. The intracellular activity of AM- 1155 in J 774. 1 macrophages, examined with Staphylococcus aureus 209 P as a test bacterium, was dependent on the extracellular concentration.

The intracellular activity of AM- 1155 was more potent than those of sparfloxacin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, flomoxef, and erythromycin.

25|$|Potassium cyanide is {{a potent}} {{inhibitor}} of cellular respiration, acting on mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase, hence blocking oxidative phosphorylation. This prevents the body from oxidizing food to produce useful energy. Lactic acidosis then occurs {{as a consequence of}} anaerobic metabolism. Initially, acute cyanide poisoning causes a red or ruddy complexion in the victim because the tissues are not able to use the oxygen in the blood. The effects of potassium and <b>sodium</b> <b>cyanide</b> are identical, and symptoms of poisoning typically occur within a few minutes of ingesting the substance: the person loses consciousness, and brain death eventually follows. During this period the victim may suffer convulsions. Death is caused by cerebral hypoxia.|$|E
25|$|Poisonous {{compounds}} may {{be useful}} either for their toxicity, or, more often, because of another chemical property, such as specific chemical reactivity. Poisons are widely used in industry and agriculture, as chemical reagents, solvents or complexing reagents, e.g. carbon monoxide, methanol and <b>sodium</b> <b>cyanide,</b> respectively. They are less common in household use, with occasional exceptions such as ammonia and methanol. For instance, phosgene is a highly reactive nucleophile acceptor, which makes it an excellent reagent for polymerizing diols and diamines to produce polycarbonate and polyurethane plastics. For this use, millions of tons are produced annually. However, the same reactivity makes it also highly reactive towards proteins in human tissue and thus highly toxic. In fact, phosgene {{has been used as}} a chemical weapon. It can be contrasted with mustard gas, which has only been produced for chemical weapons uses, as it has no particular industrial use.|$|E
500|$|Assessing {{the hazard}} {{associated}} with an acid or base may require a knowledge of pKa values. For example, hydrogen cyanide is a very toxic gas, because the cyanide ion inhibits the iron-containing enzyme cytochrome c oxidase. Hydrogen cyanide is a weak acid in aqueous solution with a pKa of about 9. In strongly alkaline solutions, above pH11, say, it follows that <b>sodium</b> <b>cyanide</b> is [...] "fully dissociated" [...] so the hazard due to the hydrogen cyanide gas is much reduced. An acidic solution, on the other hand, is very hazardous because all the cyanide is in its acid form. Ingestion of cyanide by mouth is potentially fatal, independently of pH, because of the reaction with cytochrome c oxidase.|$|E
40|$|A {{particulate}} subcellular fraction from Escherichia coli K- 12 induced in anaerobic sn-glycerol 3 -phosphate (G 3 P) dehydrogenase and fumarate reductase can catalyze under {{anaerobic conditions}} {{the transfer of}} hydrogens from G 3 P to fumarate, with attendant generation of high-energy phosphate. The phsophorylation process is more sensitive than the transhydrogenation process to inhibition by the detergent Triton X- 100. The same is true with respect to sensitivity to <b>sodium</b> azide, carbonyl <b>cyanide</b> m-chlorophenylhydrazone and N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide. Such a preparation derived from cells with beta-galactoside permease can accumulate thiomethyl beta-D-galactoside anaerobically, and the accumulation can be stimulated twofold by adding G 3 P and fumarate. Mutants lacking the membrane-associated Mg 2 +-dependent adenosine triphosphatase cannot grow anaerobically on glycerol with fumarate as the hydrogen acceptor, although they can grow aerobically on glycerol alone...|$|R
40|$|Effects of {{respiratory}} inhibitors on the circadian clock, respiratory activity, and ATP content {{were examined in}} Neurospora crassa. All inhibitors, potassium <b>cyanide,</b> <b>sodium</b> azide, antimycin A, and carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone (CCCP), shifted the phase of the conidiation rhythm. All the phase response curves were similar and resembled that for cycloheximide, but were different from the phase response curve for light. Phase shifting by azide and CCCP was proportional to the lowering {{of respiratory}} activity and ATP content, but such a correlation was not observed for cyanide and antimycin A. In particular, cyanide at a concentration of 0. 5 millimolar completely depleted ATP of the cultures but did not significantly shift their phase. Their results suggest that large shifts caused by these inhibitors are not due to a decrease in energy from respiratory activity...|$|R

40|$|Mature, dormant spores of {{a marine}} bacillus, SG- 1, bound and {{oxidized}} (precipitated) manganese on their surfaces. The binding and oxidation occurred under dormant conditions, with mature spores suspended in natural seawater.

Kynurenine, anthranilic acid, and catechol are metabolic intermediates, suggesting that this organism used the anthranilic acid pathway for tryptophan degradation. Cells that grow on L-tryptophan oxidize kynurenine, alanine, and anthranilic acid {{and the presence of}} tryptophan oxygenase (EC 1. 13. 1. 12), kynureninase (EC 3. 7. 1. 3), and catechol oxygenase (EC 1. 13. 1. 1) in cell extracts provide additional evidence for the degradative pathway in B. megaterium.

Cyanide, azide, and cupferron, which strongly inhibited respiration, also increased the frequencies of chromosome aberrations produced by x-rays at low oxygen pressures. The relation between oxygen concentration and radiosensitivity was determined both in the presence and the absence of the respiratory inhibitor cupferron. When cupferron was present, the radiosensitivity was influenced by oxygen concentrations 30 times lower than those effective {{in the absence of the}} inhibitor.
