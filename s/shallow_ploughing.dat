60|$|From {{this village}} to Attegrat the road keeps {{in the bottom}} of a broad valley, the great part of which is {{ploughed}} up and ready for the seed, which is, I suppose, sown before the June rains. The soil is light and good, in many places a rich light loam, which would delight an English gardener’s heart. The ploughs are drawn by oxen, and are exactly similar to those I have seen in parts of Italy, except that the share of this is broader and does certainly more work. Indeed, it is by no means badly adapted for <b>shallow</b> <b>ploughing</b> on a light ground. A ride of about five miles down the valley brought us to a slight rise in the ground, and on surmounting this, Attegrat lay before us. My first impression was that of disappointment, for, with the exception of its containing two or three larger buildings, it differed in nothing from the other villages we have seen. The valley, at the point where Attegrat lies, is about two miles wide, and the twenty or thirty flat-roofed huts, which, with the church and a ruined palace, constitute the city, stand on rising ground nearly in its centre. On the left of this valley, near the slope, is the British camp. Behind it the ground rises gradually, affording camping-ground, if necessary, for a considerable force. Indeed, with the exception of some ploughed fields round the town, the whole valley is well suited for a camp. The force at present here are the five companies of the 33d regiment, whose camp, with that of Penn’s mountain battery of steel guns and the Royal Engineers, is the first we arrive at. Next to the 33d lines are the commissariat stores. A few hundred yards farther down in the valley is the camp of the six companies of the 10th Native Infantry. Their tents, like those of the European troops, are upon the slope. Beyond them this slope becomes much steeper, and accordingly the 3d Native Cavalry are camped in the bottom. Next to them come the Mule Train. The divisions here are the Lahore Mule Train and the A Division under Captain Griffiths. It was this division which first landed, and brought up the pioneer force. It has been ever since in the front, and is now in admirable condition. The Egyptian, Arab, Italian, and, in fact, all the drivers, except only the Hindoostanee drivers, have been during the last few days sent down to the coast to be returned to their own countries, and their places have been filled with the Hindoo dhoolie bearers, and others whose services will be no longer required, now that the regiments have all to march without followers. It need hardly be said that this will very greatly improve the efficiency of the division, for the Hindoo, if he has less strength than the Arab, Egyptian, or Persian, is yet amenable to discipline, and will, to the best of his power, carry out the orders he receives; whereas the other men were utterly reckless and disobedient, and could not be trusted out of reach of the eye of their officers. The camp of the Scinde Horse is still farther down the valley, beyond the transport lines. Sir Robert Napier arrived yesterday afternoon. His camp had been pitched for him on some slightly-rising ground in front of the 33d lines, and distant three or four hundred yards. To-day, however, the tents are being struck, and will be pitched in a line with the 33d tents, and forming a connection between them and the artillery. His tent, therefore, is in the exact centre of the European line, with the artillery on his right, the 33d on his left flank.|$|E

40|$|The {{reduction}} of soil tillage depth is {{of special interest}} in organic farming. However, <b>shallow</b> <b>ploughing</b> often results in higher weed abundances in comparison to deep ploughing. Thus, {{the objective of this}} study was to evaluate whether the high weed suppressive ability of spring and winter pea-cereal intercrops can compensate for the higher weed growth in <b>shallow</b> <b>ploughing</b> compared to deep ploughing in organic farming. Peas and cereals were grown as sole crops and intercrops under shallow and deep ploughing in experiments on a sandy loam soil in Northern Germany in 2009, 2010 and 2011. Semi-leafless spring peas-oats, semi-leafless winter peas-triticale and regular-leaf type winter peas-triticale intercrops were examined. At harvest, weed shoot biomass in semi-leafless spring and winter pea sole crops under deep ploughing were slightly higher than those of the corresponding intercrops under <b>shallow</b> <b>ploughing.</b> Whereas weed shoot biomass in semi-leafless winter peas-triticale intercrops under deep ploughing was comparable to <b>shallow</b> <b>ploughing,</b> the cultivation of spring peas-oats intercrops under <b>shallow</b> <b>ploughing</b> led to a significantly higher weed growth than did deep ploughing. The regular-leaf type winter pea grown as a sole crop, or an intercrop with triticale, showed a higher weed suppressive ability than the semi-leafless peas. The tillage system had no significant influence on the weed infestation of sole and intercropped regular-leaf type winter peas. Semi-leafless spring peas-oats and winter peas-triticale intercrops could compensate for weed infestation differences under <b>shallow</b> <b>ploughing</b> compared to the corresponding pea sole crops under deep ploughing.

40|$|Abstract. Cost {{reduction}} in plant production, {{as well as}} ecological aspects, force farmers to apply numerous modifications in tillage. Usually, they consist in <b>shallowing</b> <b>ploughing</b> {{and replacing it with}} cultivating measures not overturning the soil. The aim of the study was determination of the effect of conventional and reduced tillage systems as well as of two levels of mineral fertilization on the yield of spring wheat in the second cycle of crop rotation: potato spring wheat field pea (edible form) winter wheat. The research was carried out in the years 2003 - 2006 on lessive soil formed from loess included in the good wheat complex. Autumn tillage under spring wheat, cultivar Helia, included the following cultivation measures: A pre-winter ploughing (18 - 22 cm), B cultivatoring (10 - 15 cm), C heavy harrowing (8 - 10 cm). In spring, harrowing was conducted on all plots as well as cultivatoring, harrowing, seeding and harrowing. The second experimental factor was mineral fertilization on two levels: 117. 3 kg NPK (50 kg N, 17. 5 kg P, 49. 8 kg K) and 175. 9 kg NPK (75 kg N, 26. 2 kg P, 74. 7 kg K). The conducted research indicated that replacing pre-winter ploughing with cultivatoring (B) or heavy harrowing (C) resulted in a statistically insignificant yield decrease, by 4. 3 % and 7. 1 % respectively, as well as i...|$|R
40|$|In two {{long-term}} experiments (started in 1978) on day loam soils {{each with}} four randomized blocks, four different ploughing depths had been compared during a fifteen year period on sites previously ploughed {{to a depth}} of ab out 25 cm. During the whole experimental period, fertilizing, crop residue management and other treatments had been equal for all ploughing depths. Deep ploughing had resulted in a few percent higher accumulated yields than <b>shallow</b> <b>ploughing,</b> probably because of higher weed infestation (Elymus repens, (L.) Gould) for <b>shallow</b> <b>ploughing.</b> In two treatments (mouldboard ploughing to about 31 cm and 16 cm) an investigation was made in 1993 on bulk soil properties and penetration resistance and on concentration and total amount of organic matter and nitrogen. Depending on the ploughing depth used, sampling was done in two layers for deep ploughing and three layers for <b>shallow</b> <b>ploughing.</b> The first layer from the ground surface to present ploughing depth and the second layer (<b>shallow</b> <b>ploughing)</b> from present to previous ploughing depth. The bottom layer is a shallow transition layer between topsoil and subsoil. Bulk density and degree of compactness were higher and porosity lower in deeper layers. There was a plough pan in both treatments but at different depths. Total amount of organic matter in the soil was equal for both treatments, but the vertical distribution of organic matter differed between the ploughing depths.

40|$|The {{structure}} of the soil in the arable layer is controlled by tillage, soil biota activities and weathering, whereas the structure below this layer is mainly {{the result of the}} activities of soil biota. Organic farmers tend to minimise the depth of the main tillage operation to encourage soil biota to create a soil structure with continuous biopores and a well crumbled topsoil. The best main tillage operation for preventive weed control, especially important in organic farming, is mouldboard ploughing. The <b>shallow</b> <b>ploughing</b> experiments described in this paper were conducted to ascertain the minimum ploughing depth for an ecologically accountable, sustainable tillage system with good weed control, good land qualities (in terms of workable days, aeration and soil moisture conditions) and finally with good yields. The "ecoplough" used for <b>shallow</b> <b>ploughing</b> was developed by Rumptstad Industries to meet the requirements of relatively <b>shallow</b> <b>ploughing</b> with good soil inversion for weed control. The plough has seven or eight bottoms for ploughing depths of 0. 12 – 0. 20 m, a working width of 2. 1 m and a working speed of 1. 7 m s- 1. Its width is such that the tractor with wide low-pressure tyres runs on top of the land. After using the plough for 6 years on Luvisols (> 200 gkg- 1 200 g kg- 1 < 2 m), <b>shallow</b> <b>ploughing</b> seems to be the best reduced tillage system. It has several advantages.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{ploughing}} depth and mechanical soil loading {{on the performance}} of pea sole crops, oat sole crops and pea–oat intercrops was investigated in field experiments under organic farming conditions at two sites in Germany in 2009 and 2010. The two ploughing depths were short-term <b>shallow</b> <b>ploughing</b> to a soil depth of 7 – 10 cm and deep ploughing to 25 – 30 cm. Wheel loads of 26 and 45 kN, which correspond to typical rear wheel loads of field machinery used during sowing operations, were compared to an uncompacted control. <b>Shallow</b> <b>ploughing</b> resulted in a greater penetration resistance in the 14 – 28 cm soil layer compared to deep ploughing. An increase in mechanical soil loading intensity increased the bulk density and decreased the air capacity in the 10 – 15 cm soil layer, whereas the penetration resistance was not affected. The annual weed infestation in pea sole crops was higher after shallow than after deep ploughing at both sites. Pea–oat intercrops compensated for the higher weed infestation after <b>shallow</b> <b>ploughing</b> at one site due to their excellent weed suppressive ability. Dependent on oat productivity, pea–oat intercrops produced comparable or higher grain and protein yields than pea sole crops. Intercropped pea yield components and grain protein yields were significantly lower than those of sole cropped peas. The ploughing depth did not affect pea grain yields in either year and oat yields in 2009. Due to a better emergence, the grain and protein yield of sole and intercropped oats were significantly higher after <b>shallow</b> <b>ploughing</b> in 2010. Mechanical soil loading did not have any effect on the yield performance of pea sole crops, oat sole crops and pea–oat intercrops in 2009.

40|$|A tension {{infiltrometer}} {{for field}} use, where both water level changes measurement and tension settings could be automated, was built in-house. Differential pressure transducers {{were used to}} automate the water level measurement in the reservoir. The Mariotte bottle was automated {{by a set of}} solenoid valves which were connected via tubing to pre-defined depths in the Mariotte bottle. Based on design parameters tested in the laboratory (sensor sensitivity, water reservoir diameter, and bubbling rate) three identical tension infiltrometers connected to a single Mariotte bottle were built. A new reservoir system made of two plexiglass tubes of different diameter slotted in each other was found to reduce the measurement fluctuations caused by the disturbance created to rising bubbles in the reservoir. The new system was tested on a uniform sandy loam profile prepared in the soil bin laboratory and different analytical and numerical data analysis methods were compared. The measured steady state data were used to determine K(h) at different suctions using the analytical method proposed by Reynolds and Elrick (1991). The K(h) points obtained were fitted with the van Genuchten’s equation (van Genuchten, 1980) using the RETC program to calculate the best fit parameters Ks,  and n. These parameters were used as initial estimates of the soil hydraulic parameters in the numerical models HYDRUS 1 D and 2 D, in which transient cumulative flow data was used to determine the soil hydraulic functions via inverse modelling. The analysis of variance determined significantly higher K(h) values calculated by HYDRUS 1 D while the other methods did not differ from each other. Finally, the tension infiltrometer was used in the field on a sandy loam soil to characterise five different tillage treatments (conventional <b>plough,</b> <b>shallow</b> <b>plough,</b> minimum tillage, direct drill, and no-tillage).

40|$|Canada Thistle (Cirsium arvense) is a {{widespread}} weed in organic farming. It is difficult to control and in many farming enterprises {{there is a tendency}} of increase. Reduced frequency and intensity of tillage may be one reason for increasing problems. We studied the impact of stubble tillage and primary tillage on population-dynamics of C. arvense. In this paper results are presented of two field experiments at the ‘Experimental Station for Organic Farming Kleinhohenheim’, one field experiment on ‘Goldener Acker’ at Hohenheim and 19 experiments on organic farms south of Stuttgart. The experiments were carried out between 1998 and 2003. Results show that inversion in autumn or winter is vital for the control of C. arvense. In an experiment testing various ploughing options plus non inversion tillage C. arvense rapidly increased in plots with yearly non inversion tillage but was kept at a low level in ploughed plots, with lower densities of C. arvense shoots in plots with deep ploughing compared to <b>shallow</b> <b>ploughing.</b> Experiments on stubble tillage showed that tillage in summer effectively can reduce growth of C. arvense. However, <b>shallow</b> <b>ploughing</b> which was seen as the optimal option before the widespread introduction of herbicides appears to have no advantages compared to stubble tillage operations by a cultivator, rototiller or other machines. So, modern machinery adequately controls C. arvense and {{there is no need for}} a renaissance of the old fashioned shallow plough. We conclude that tillage during summer and autumn is vital to control C. arvense and therefore to achieve adequate yields. Another important component for keeping C. arvense and other perennial weeds on a reasonable level is an adequate proportion of perennial fodder crops within the rotation. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{cultivation}} of weak weed competitive pea sole crops after reduced ploughing depth {{may result in}} weed problems in organic farming. Intercropping peas and cereals is one option to manage weed problems. However, little evidence exists on the weed suppressive ability of pea-cereal intercrops after differing ploughing depths. The effect of crop stand (pea sole crop, pea-oat intercrop and oat sole crop) and ploughing depth (10 – 12 vs. 25 – 27 cm) on the annual weed infestation, PAR transmission and weed nitrogen as well as water supply was investigated in field experiments in Northern Germany. In order to determine causes for the differing weed suppressive ability in pea and oat sole or intercrops, a pot experiment and a bioassay were conducted complementary to the field experiments. Crop stand and ploughing depth did not interact with regard to weed infestation. The weed suppressive ability increased from pea sole crops to oat sole crops, whereas <b>shallow</b> <b>ploughing</b> resulted in a significantly higher weed infestation than deep ploughing. While cropweed competition for light was not essential for the differing weed suppressive ability, competition for water and nitrogen were detected to be key factors. As root exudates of the examined oat cultivar showed a growth inhibiting potential, allelopathy may {{also contribute to the}} weed suppression in oat sole and pea-oat intercrops. Results from this study indicate that pea-oat intercropping is not able to compensate for the higher annual weed infestation after <b>shallow</b> <b>ploughing.</b> Nevertheless,owing to their good weed suppressive ability, intercrops with cereals are of particular suitability for the {{cultivation of}} weak weed suppressive semi-leafless peas in reduced tilled soils in organic farming...|$|E

40|$|Soil is {{the largest}} {{terrestrial}} carbon (C) store, containing an estimated 1500 Gt C in the upper 1 m of soil. The long term storage of soil organic C (SOC) requires that it is somehow protected from microbial decomposition – or ‘stabilised’ – in the soil matrix. Three mechanisms are commonly identified as factors controlling the stability of SOM: chemical recalcitrance, physical protection in aggregates and adsorption to soil mineral surfaces. The stability of SOC in the soil matrix can be influenced by management practices and changes in soil structure can lead to loss of SOC and increases in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. It is, therefore, {{important to understand the}} impact that management practices have on SOC stability and to manage soils {{in such a way as}} to optimise the volume of SOC which is locked away for climatically significant periods of time. Two methods are generally used to estimate SOC stability: indirectly by measuring CO 2 fluxes as a proxy for SOC microbial decomposition, or directly through physical fractionation of soil in to pools with different levels of physical and chemical protection. Both methods were employed in this thesis. Arable and grassland soils which represent the range of soil textures and climatic conditions of the main agricultural areas in the UK were incubated at two different moisture contents and with or without inorganic fertiliser application and GHG fluxes from them were monitored. Soil texture, mineral N concentration and soil C concentration were found to be the most important measured variables controlling GHG fluxes of the UK agricultural soils in this study. The results were generally in support of those found in the literature for a wide range of soils, conditions and locations; however, N 2 O emissions from the two Scottish soils appeared to be more sensitive to inorganic N fertilisation at the higher moisture content than the other soils, with the N 2 O emissions being exceptionally high in comparison. Although incubations of whole soils are useful in measuring the impacts of soil management practices on GHG emissions under controlled conditions they do not identify the mechanisms controlling the stability of SOC. Dividing SOM into functional pools may identify different C stabilising mechanisms and improves soil C models. A large number of operationally defined separation methods have been used to fractionate SOM into biologically meaningful pools of different stability. Direct comparisons of different fractionation methods using radiocarbon (14 C) dating and spectroscopic analyses has not previously been undertaken. Average 14 C ages and chemical composition of SOM fractions isolated from a grassland soil using three published and frequently applied fractionation methods were compared. (1) a density separation technique isolating three fractions (2) a combined physical and chemical separation isolating five fractions (3) a hot-water extraction method isolating two fractions. The fractions from Method 1 had the most distinct average 14 C ages, the fractions from Method 2 fell into two age groups, and both Method 3 fractions were dominated by modern C. The average 14 C ages of the labile fractions from Method 1 and 2 were higher than the mineral bound fractions, although they made up a relatively small proportion of the total SOC. This was a surprising result, and spectroscopic analysis confirmed that these fractions had greater relative contents of aliphatic and aromatic characteristics than the mineral bound fractions. The presence of black C in a whole soil sample and one of the labile fractions from Method 2 was confirmed by hydrogen pyrolysis. The availability of archived soils from an abandoned long term tillage treatment experiment and the ability to relocate the plots provided a unique opportunity to assess the resilience of SOC stocks to land management practices several years after the conversion from arable to grassland. SOC stability was assessed by soil fractionation of archived (1975) and freshly collected (2014) soil samples. The mass corrected SOC stocks from the four different treatments (deep <b>plough,</b> <b>shallow</b> <b>plough,</b> chisel plough and direct drill) were higher in 2014 than 1975 across the whole profile (0 – 36 cm). Reductions were observed at some depths for some treatments but the overall effect was an evening out of SOC stocks across all plots. The fractionations (using Method 2), revealed that there was a relative increase in the mass of the sand and aggregate fraction but a decrease in the relative proportion of SOC stored in this fraction (physically protected). There was also a significant increase in the C:N ratio of the silt and clay fraction (chemical adsorption). This suggests that reduced disturbance of agricultural soils leads to preferential physical stabilisation of fresh SOM but also increased adsorption of older material to mineral surfaces. The labile fractions were sensitive to land-use change in all tillage treatment plots, but were more sensitive in the low impact tillage plots (chisel plough and direct drill) than the inversion tillage plots (deep <b>plough</b> and <b>shallow</b> <b>plough).</b> It is well established that tillage disrupts aggregation. However, a direct measurement of the level of SOM physical protection in the soil matrix due to aggregation has not previously been undertaken. The soil was fractionated using Method 1 (fractions with distinctly different 14 C ages) and isolated soil fractions were incubated separately, recombined and mixed in to whole soil at three different temperatures. The C respiration rate of the isolated intra-aggregate fraction was generally consistently as high as the whole soil. This supports the theory that there is a labile component of soil which is protected from decomposition by physical protection within aggregates. Therefore, the lack of any priming effect with the addition of labile fractions to the whole soil, and indeed the suppression of emissions relative to the whole soil, was unusual. Fractions and whole soils incubated at 25 and 35 °C had a wider range of Q 10 (temperature sensitivity) values than those incubated at 15 and 25 °C, however, median values were surprisingly similar (range from 0. 7 to 1. 9). Overall, the results from this thesis highlight the importance of the soil structure in stabilising C. Disrupting aggregates leaves a proportion of otherwise stable C susceptible to loss through microbial decomposition, particularly when the entire soil matrix is disrupted. It also provided some unexpected results which warrant future investigation; in particular, further direct measurement of physical stabilisation of SOM in soils of different type, from different climates and different land uses would be useful...|$|R
40|$|Before {{introduction}} of herbicides <b>shallow</b> <b>ploughing</b> was a widespread method of stubble tillage. In June 1999 25 trials on 7 organic farms {{were set up}} in South Germany. Three treatments of stubble tillage were compared: 1. “Stoppelhobel” (shallow ploughing); 2. “non inversion” stubble tillage (mostly chisel); 3. “control” (no stubble tillage). Results are shown for the first 16 months after initiating the experiments. In spring 2000 significant differences were assessed between the treatments “control” {{on one hand and}} “Stoppelhobel” and “non inversion” on the other with respect to perennial weeds. The same results were recorded on the stubble 2000. For annual weeds treatments never differed significantly.

The ice grows out to sea-ward for more than a mile sometimes, about one-eighth of it being above water, and seven-eighths below, so that an ice-cliff one hundred feet high may project into water eight hundred feet deep. At last, when it gets out of its depth, the buoyancy of the water breaks it off in icebergs, which float away, at the mercy of tides and currents, often grounding again in <b>shallower</b> water, and <b>ploughing</b> the sea-bottom as they drag along it. These bergs carry stones and dirt, often in large quantities; so that, whenever a berg melts or capsizes, it strews its burden confusedly about the sea-floor.|$|R

In a second stage, the effect of earthworm activity on soil porosity under the four tillage systems was assessed at sites A and B. Earthworm abundance, biomass and diversity were measured over a 2 – 3 -year period at the 3 sites. During the same period, soil structure (soil profile description and soil bulk density) and open worm burrows in the soil were assessed at sites A and B. After 3 years of experiments, {{it was found that}} at 2 sites earthworm abundance and biomass were higher in NT than with ploughing or reduced tillage. The increase of earthworms in NT is mainly due to anecic species increase. Earthworm abundance and biomass tend to decrease regardless of the tillage techniques employed at sites with a ley, and conversely, tend to increase in NT and RT at sites initially ploughed. In the short term, the increase of anecic species in NT has no effect on soil porosity evolution: NT soils were more compacted than those which were ploughed.

40|$|Grain {{yield of}} maize {{cultivated}} {{in the years}} 1997 - 2009 in monoculture and with annual tillage simplifications was assessed in energy and economy terms. Effects of no-tillage system and direct sowing (D) with cultivation with autumn deep (A) and <b>shallow</b> (B) <b>ploughing</b> and cultivation with spring pre-sowing ploughing (C) were compared. It was demonstrated that the 13 -year maize grain yield in no-tillage system and direct sowing was lower by 10. 4 % than the yield obtained in conventional tillage system. The depth of autumn ploughing and its replacement with spring pre-sowing ploughing did not significantly affect the level of grain yield. Direct sowing compared to conventional tillage system reduced costs by on average 11. 6 %, and energy inputs only by 0. 9 %. The energy inputs of 100 kg grain production in direct sowing were higher by over 10 % than the inputs of cultivations based on both autumn ploughing, irrespective of its depth, and of pre-sowing ploughing in the spring. The negative effect of direct sowing on grain yield was compensated by lower costs, which caused that the mean cost of 100 kg grain production for 13 years in direct sowing did not significantly differ from the costs of ploughing cultivations. Energy effectiveness of maize grain production in direct sowing was significantly lower than in the examined ploughing tillage cultivations. The soil tillage systems under study {{did not have a}} significant influence on economic effectiveness of maize cultivation evaluated with mean costs of production of 100 kg grain for 13 years...|$|R

Intercroppingwinter peas and cereals {{may be a}} beneficial way to improve lodging resistance in normal-leafed andweed suppression in semi-leafless winter peas. At the same time, there is an increasing interest in areduction in tillage intensity, e. g. <b>shallow</b> <b>ploughing.</b> A normal-leafed, coloured-flowered (cv. E. F. B. 33) and a semi-leafless, white-flowered winter pea (cv. James) were cultivated as sole crops or in intercropswith triticale (Triticosecale Wittmarck) on a loam soil under Northern German conditions during twoseasons (2009 / 2010, 2010 / 2011) and compared for winter survival, lodging resistance, yield performance,grain quality and succeeding winter wheat yield. The two ploughing depths were short-term shallowploughing to 10 – 12 cm and continuous deep ploughing to 25 – 27 cm. Intercropping did not improvewinter survival, which depended on pre-winter development. Owing to the low lodging resistance ofnormal-leafed winter pea E. F. B. 33, sole cropping is not advisable. Intercropping normal-leafed winterpea E. F. B. 33 and triticale resulted in a better yield performance (2. 54 – 3. 39 t d. m. ha− 1) than the semi-leafless winter pea James sole (0. 97 – 1. 79 t d. m. ha− 1) or intercrops (2. 05 – 2. 86 t d. m. ha− 1). E. F.

The treatments being compared, were expected to have altered the soil’s physical and chemical properties, and consequently, its biological properties.

40|$|Tillage modifies soil {{structure}} and crop residue distribution {{and in turn}} affects the ability of soil micro-organisms to degrade soil organic matter and release nutrients for crop growth. In organic farming, soil microbiological activity is of primary importance as nutrient supply is mainly dependent {{on the degradation of}} soil organic matter by soil micro-organisms. The aim of this work was therefore to study, in organic farming, the effects of four tillage systems [mouldboard <b>ploughing</b> (MP), <b>shallow</b> mouldboard <b>ploughing</b> (SMP), reduced tillage (RT) and shallow soil tillage (ST) ] on {{soil structure}}, soil microbial biomass (SMB) and its potential activity (Cmin) during the first year following the treatments. To study simultaneously the effects of soil structure modifications and crop residue distribution on SMB and Cmin, we adopted a sampling scheme based on a morphological description of soil profiles. We distinguished and sampled compacted and non-compacted clods (D and G clods) at three depths (0 – 5, 5 – 15 and 15 – 30 cm). This method enabled us to have a precise estimation of the effects of tillage treatments on SMB and Cmin. MP reduced compacted zones and limited unfavourable conditions for microbial growth and enabled a homogenous distribution of SMB in the soil profile. At the opposite, the ST increased compacted zones in the soil profile and limited SMB development below the top few centimetres. The SMP and the RT systems appeared as intermediate techniques. RT seemed to be a conservation tillage technique which could be used in organic farming...|$|R
40|$|It {{has become}} commonplace to {{consider}} ploughing as an agricultural practice that destroys soil fertility. Organic farmers have traditionally used the plough to till their soil and control weeds. However, {{there is a}} growing interest in adopting tillage practices without ploughing to preserve long-term soil fertility and in the hope, subsequently, of increasing crop yields. The aim {{of this paper is to}} assess if conservation tillage treatments in organic farming did in fact improve long-term soil fertility, wheat rooting and yield in a long term field experiment (2004 – 2015). We compared the effects of conservation tillage treatments (superficial tillage – ST- with chisel at 15 cm depth and very superficial tillage – VST- at 5 – 7 cm depth) and conventional tillage treatments (traditional mouldboard ploughing- MP at 30 cm depth and <b>shallow</b> mouldboard <b>ploughing</b> – SMP- at 18 cm depth without skim coulter) during 10 years on a sandy loam soil in France. To assess soil fertility, physical (soil penetration resistance, visual soil profile observation), chemical (organic carbon – Corg, total nitrogen – Ntot and available phosphorus – OlsenP) and biotic (earthworms biomass, density and diversity) soil properties were measured in 2004 - 5 and 2015. The effect of soil fertility on wheat roots and crop growth was also measured in 2015. VST, and to a lesser extent ST, increased Corg, Ntot and OlsenP in the upper soil layer (from 0 to 15 cm) compared to ploughing treatments. On the contrary, soil compaction increased using conservation tillage treatments (VST and ST) during the 10 years of experiment, especially in the layers between 15 and 30 cm depth in comparison with ploughing treatments. This effect is not offset by an increase in earthworm abundance and activities in conservation treatments. Earthworm biomass and endogeic abundance were even higher in SMP compared to ST. Soil compaction limits roots, with less roots in depth with VST (from 12 to 30 cm and 48 to 70 cm) and ST (from 24 to 30 cm) compared to ploughing treatments. Conservation tillage treatments had positive effects on soil chemical components in the upper soil layer and contributed to the increase of wheat biomass until tillering stage. However, no wheat yield difference was found between treatments. Physical and biotic soil properties had not significantly improved after 10 years of conservation tillage. This could be due either to the insufficient duration of the experiment to foster a positive earthworm effect on soil porosity, or to the sandy soil, too sensitive to soil compaction in this organic cropping system (intensive mechanical weeding) and unfavourable for the development of the earthworm population...|$|R
