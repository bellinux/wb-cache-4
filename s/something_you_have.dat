We can take heat if there's {{something}} wrong {{and people can}} review shows badly– that's <b>something</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to live with– but to say people {{stormed out of the}} show was an absolute fabrication. Britney is aware of all this and she's extremely upset by it. She's a human being. I'm embarrassed, with such a big international entourage here with Britney, {{to be part of the}} Australian media when I see that kind of totally inaccurate reporting. It's been all over the internet for nine months, the inference is that we tried to hide this. It's been the opposite. This show is about an incredible spectacle, which it is".|$|E
500|$|The {{challenge}} of coordinating these projects took an artistic toll on Pei. He found himself responsible for acquiring new building contracts and supervising {{the plans for}} them. As a result, he felt disconnected from the actual creative work. [...] "Design is <b>something</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to put your hand to," [...] he said. [...] "While my people {{had the luxury of}} doing one job at a time, I had {{to keep track of the}} whole enterprise." [...] Pei's dissatisfaction reached its peak at a time when financial problems began plaguing Zeckendorf's firm. I.M. Pei and Associates officially broke from Webb and Knapp in 1960, which benefited Pei creatively but pained him personally. He had developed a close friendship with Zeckendorf, and both men were sad to part ways.|$|E
500|$|Several of {{the songs}} on the album drew their lyrics from real life relationships. [...] "Peachy" [...] {{documents}} the permanent breakup of a relationship that had inspired her 2004 single [...] "Ten Days". [...] "Where I Stood", which Higgins calls [...] "a pretty sad love song", describes the end of another relationship. She said it portrays [...] "one of those situations where you just feel that leaving this person is <b>something</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> {{to do to get}} to know yourself again." [...] "Secret" [...] was about an ex-girlfriend who was uncomfortable about going public with their relationship; [...] "I was so head over heels in love with her I kind of wanted to shout it out to the world, so it was just a song about keeping something under the covers ... keeping it away locked in a little room." ...|$|E

2500|$|While Ivey {{was gaining}} recognition, {{and was able}} to quit his day job, he was notorious for his {{reluctance}} to attend opening parties, do publicity, or seek out commissions, and for his gruff, workmanlike approach to painting. [...] "Painting is <b>something</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to do all the time," [...] he told arts journalist Regina Hackett in a 1992 interview. [...] "If you don't, it becomes too important, too charged with meaning, and you can't bring yourself to do it. For me, it's like tying my shoes in a way." ...|$|E
2500|$|Academy Award-winning costume {{designer}} Catherine Martin did extensive {{research for the}} film's outfits, studying archival images and newspapers from the 1930s and 1940s Australia. She also interviewed descendants of the original Darwin stockmen {{in order to find}} out if they [...] "wore socks with his boots when he rode a horse, that's something you either get through a snapshot, or <b>something</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to go talk to the people who lived there about". The Asian-inspired costumes of the film were intended to evoke the romanticism of the era, and one of the centrepieces of the film's costuming is a red chrysanthemum-printed Chinese cheongsam or qipao that was made for Nicole Kidman's character. [...] The film received an Academy Award nomination for Best Costume Design.|$|E
2500|$|Ruslan Obiang, {{a son of}} the President, is Equatorial Guinea's sports {{minister}} and president of a top soccer club, the [...] "Panthers". He has lived in Spain, where he encouraged firms {{to do business in}} his country. Several Spanish businessmen have complained about the consequences of these deals. One Spaniard who had paid $200,000 to secure a contract to build soccer stadiums described a system that involved bribes at every turn. After paying bribes for years, however, his deal eventually fell apart when he refused to pay any more in bribes to Ruslan Obiang and his associates. The businessman was critical of business in the country, saying officials exploit as much money as possible until moving on to another contractor. The businessman also noted that he had been threatened on several occasions, both with violence, and trumped-up rape charges that could have resulted in him being imprisoned. His report claimed that there is no avenue for justice in the nation, since [...] "he corruption is absolute and endemic; there is nobody you can turn to." [...] After the deal collapsed, one of his business partners was visited at his Portugal home by men in dark suits who staked outside his home for several days as a threat and then visited him in his office. Herein they warned him that if he reported his story to the media or any authorities there would be consequences. He concluded: [...] "You sign a contract with the son of the president and you believe it is worth <b>something.</b> <b>You</b> <b>have</b> no idea {{what is going to happen}} to you. We had to flee the country. We were afraid for our lives." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Why do you {{attribute}} to me a wish {{for anything that}} would annoy you? You speak {{to me as if}} I were <b>something</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> to contend against. Wait at least till I appear to consult my own pleasure apart from yours." ...|$|R

6000|$|Mrs. Starbottle {{winced at}} the last sentence.

6000|$|The girl showed faint {{signs of}} temper. [...] "You {{have told me}} that before.

It was seven o'clock when we <b>had</b> breakfast. Can't <b>you</b> even make a fire?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{never get}} to speak to you, said Val. 'I did think I would that first time, and ask you what to do, but then you came in late, and when I began <b>something,</b> <b>you</b> said <b>you</b> <b>had</b> your Greek to do, {{and told me to}} hold my tongue.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Eugène," [...] she expostulated, [...] "we are too {{old friends}} to talk always in veiled phrases. There is <b>something</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> {{to say to}} me. I am listening." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, {{there is}} a good deal in that, as you say,' Logan admitted. 'But decent people will think the whole {{speculation}} shady. How are you to get round that? There is <b>something</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> forgotten.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah! {{you have}} overworked yourself, {{but it was}} for <b>something.</b> <b>You</b> <b>have</b> given papa such {{pleasure}} and comfort, as you can't help being glad of. That {{is very different from}} us foolish young ones and our trumpeting." ...|$|E
5000|$|Gallant {{was born}} Ira Gallantz in the Bronx, New York into a Russian Jewish family. [...] He {{had a brother}} who was murdered in the 1980s.

6000|$|... "I'm not cold," [...] she said. [...] "I {{was just}} thinking. I ought {{to tell you}} <b>something.</b> <b>You</b> <b>have</b> {{selected}} a strange confidante. But you cannot expect a chance acquaintance, picked up in a doubtful restaurant, to be an angel." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Animus?" [...] Watson replied. [...] "Certainly not. I haven't such a {{thing in}} my nature. And to prove it, {{let me show you}} {{something}} curious, <b>something</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> never seen before." [...] Casting about him, Watson picked up a rough stone the size of his fist.

6000|$|Mr. Knight, {{when you}} are gone, will you send me <b>something</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> written?
