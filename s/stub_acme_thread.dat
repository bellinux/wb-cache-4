40|$|On {{behalf of}} Petroleum Technology Company AS (PTC), an {{experimental}} study regarding {{one of their}} safety valves has been conducted. The respective safety valve is called a Modular Surface Annulus Safety (MSAS) valve. This valve functions as a primary barrier against dangerous blow-outs from the annulus in an oil and gas-producing well. It is a back check valve, where a piston moves inside a valve housing. In the past {{there has been some}} issues regarding what torque values these valves are to be installed with. Too high torque values could lead to insufficient clearance between the moving piston and the valve housing. Insufficient clearance would lead to malfunctioning of the valve, and potential dangerous blow-outs from the well, due to a primary barrier not functioning properly. The goal of this thesis has been {{to come up with a}} method for determining the appropriate installation torque that is to be used during installation of such valves. In order to determine the appropriate installation torque there are three things that have to be accounted for. The first is achieving sufficient pre-tensioning of the valve so that the valve does not loosen due to vibrations. The second is to ensure that there is sufficient clearance between the valve housing and piston after installation. The third is to determine whether lubrications are necessary or not. In order to account for these things two different tests have been designed, Torque test 1 and Torque test 2 (TT 1 and TT 2). The previous tests totaled 118 measurements. In addition to these tests there have been performed finite element analysis (FEA) via SolidWorks Simulations. These tests and simulations are briefly described in the following. TT 1 was designed to measure the relationship between applied torque, corresponding axial force and the coefficient of friction between the valve and the VR-profile that it is inserted into. The relationship between the applied torque and corresponding axial force was measured via an electronic load cell. This was possible due to the design of the test setup. The coefficient of friction at different lubrication conditions was possible to calculate due to specially machined test parts, as well as engineering equations from threaded bolt theory. TT 2 was designed to measure the radial displacement that takes place in the valve housing when exposed to the installation torque, due to the angled contact surface in front of the valve. The purpose of the test was to calculate the torque that would lead to insufficient clearance between the valve housing and piston at given frictional conditions, calculated from the results from TT 1. This test was performed via strain gauges as well as manual measurements via a micrometer. Both of the previous tests were conducted in pit one, in PTC’s workshop. Two different valve housings were studied. A 2. 0 ” valve, and a 2. 5 ” valve, both with Xylan coating and 8 TPI <b>Stub</b> <b>Acme</b> <b>threads...</b>|$|R

Although metric screw threads are generally more prevalent worldwide than imperial <b>threads,</b> the <b>Acme</b> <b>thread</b> is very common worldwide, and may be more widely used than the trapezoidal metric thread. This is not surprising, as manufacturers today are usually capable of making whichever threads (metric or imperial) are best for any given application (based on customer expectations or tooling availability). It may be that the tooling for <b>Acme</b> <b>threads</b> has been so dominant (compared to trapezoidal metric) that customers tend to want <b>Acme</b> <b>threads</b> for power screws regardless of metric standards used elsewhere in the product.|$|R
50|$|<b>Acme</b> <b>threads</b> have a 29° thread angle, {{which is}} easier to machine than square threads. They are not as {{efficient}} as square threads, due to the increased friction induced by the <b>thread</b> angle. <b>ACME</b> <b>Threads</b> are generally also stronger than square threads due to their trapezoidal thread profile, which provides greater load-bearing capabilities.|$|R
25|$|When created {{prior to}} 1895, <b>Acme</b> screw <b>threads</b> were {{intended}} to replace square threads {{and a variety of}} threads of other forms used chiefly for the purpose of traversing on machines, tools, etc. <b>Acme</b> screw <b>threads</b> are now extensively used for a variety of purposes. Long-length <b>Acme</b> <b>threads</b> are used for controlled movements on machine tools, testing machines, jacks, aircraft flaps, and conveyors. Short-length threads are used on valve stems, hose connectors, bonnets on pressure cylinders, steering mechanisms, and camera lens movement.|$|R
25|$|Compared {{to square}} threads, {{disadvantages}} of the <b>Acme</b> <b>thread</b> form are lower efficiency due to higher friction and some radial {{load on the}} nut (angular offset from square).|$|R

The <b>Acme</b> <b>thread</b> was developed in 1894 as a profile well suited to power screws that has various advantages over the square thread, which had been the form of choice until then. It is easier to cut via either single-point threading or die than the square thread is (because the latter's shape requires tool bit or die tooth geometry that is poorly suited to cutting); it wears better than square (because the wear can be compensated for); it is stronger than a comparably sized square thread; and it makes for smoother engagement of the half nuts on a lathe leadscrew than square does.|$|R
40|$|A {{screw jack}} is a device used {{to lift the}} vehicle above the ground level in order to ease repairs. A power screw is {{designed}} to translate radial motion to linear motion. Many users are familiar with manually operated car jack which still included as standard equipment in cars. A car jack is an important device in vehicle to change flat tire in our journey. Every year near about 160 injuries are associated with car jacks. The correct use of jacks can prevent the accidents and injuries. Improvement in Design of car jack is really important to make the tool more efficient and user friendly with high safety features. The objectives of this project work is to critically analyze and compare between <b>ACME</b> and SQUARE <b>threads</b> from stress and strain perspective {{in order to improve}} the performance from safety and durability point of view for developments in the field of thread design. In this project selection of two different types of screw threads namely Square and <b>Acme</b> <b>threads.</b> The square threads are named after their square geometry. They are the most efficient power screw, but also the most difficult to machine, thus most expensive. The <b>Acme</b> <b>threads</b> are machining with multipoint cutting tool on thread milling machine, it is an economical operation. <b>Acme</b> <b>threads</b> have more thickness at core diameter than of Square threads therefore a screw with <b>Acme</b> <b>threads</b> is stronger than equivalent screw with Square threads.

40|$|Aim: The aim of {{the study}} is to {{evaluate}} the influence implant length on stress distribution at bone implant interface in single immediately loaded implants when placed in D 4 bone quality. Materials and Methods: A 2 -dimensional finite element models were developed to simulate two types of implant designs, standard 3. 75 mm-diameter tapered body implants of 6 and 10 mm lengths. The implants were placed in D 4 bone quality with a cortical bone thickness of 0. 5 mm. The implant design incorporated microthreads at the crestal part {{and the rest of the}} implant body incorporated <b>Acme</b> <b>threads.</b> The <b>Acme</b> <b>thread</b> form has a 29 ° thread angle with a thread height half of the pitch; the apex and valley are flat. A 100 N of force was applied vertically and in the oblique direction (at an angle of 45 °) to the long axis of the implants. The respective material properties were assigned. Micro-movements and stresses at the bone implant interface were evaluated. Results: The results of total deformation (micro-movement) and Von mises stress were found to be lower for tapered long implant (10 mm) than short implant (6 mm) while using both vertical as well as oblique loading. Conclusion: Short implants can be successfully placed in poor bone quality under immediate loading protocol.

2500|$|The line of General Purpose (GP) <b>Acme</b> <b>threads</b> (ASME/ANSI B1.5-1997) are not {{designed}} to sustain external radial loads and both the nut and bolt are, ideally, independently supported, the nut by a linear guide and the screw by shaft bearings. This {{is due to the}} need to avoid [...] "wedging" [...] of the thread flanks when subjected to radial loads, which would contribute substantially to friction forces and thread wear. However, there is a centralizing Acme-thread standard (also specified in ASME/ANSI B1.5-1997) which caters to applications where the threads are not radially supported, where the roots and crests of opposing threads are designed to come into contact before the flanks do, under radial loads. This adds the requirement that the sum of the allowances and tolerances on the major diameters of nut and bolt be less than the sum of the allowances on the pitch diameters (PD); the drawback is that, for a given amount of end play (axial clearance, due solely to PD deviations), closer tolerances and cleaner work environment are necessitated in the application of a centralizing <b>Acme</b> <b>thread.</b>|$|R

40|$|Having {{the ability}} to change a dining table between a sitting and {{standing}} position is a niche feature. This feature was created for people that play board games regularly at a table, or for people who require use of a dining table as a standing work area. The mechanism that the table works by is using an <b>acme</b> <b>threaded</b> rod as a lead screw, with two timing belt pullies driving the shafts up and down which cause the raising and lowering of the table. These pullies were machined to incorporate an <b>ACME</b> <b>threaded</b> bolt which was welded into each pully. Due to the lead angle on the acme shafts they are self-locking which means that there {{does not need to}} be a secondary holding mechanism to prevent the table from falling once it is raised. It was designed to hold a 600 pound distributed load across the surface of the chassis with a designated factor of safety of 1. 3, which through nondestructive testing the chassis was able to support. The result is a table which can be used as a normal sit down dining table, with as little interference to comfort as possible, and can then be raised up a total of 2 feet to become a standing work table...|$|R

In the experiments, measured data are taken at Reynolds number in range of 7, 000 to 14, 000 with air as the test fluid. The experiments were conducted on circular tube with three different types of internal <b>threads</b> viz. <b>acme,</b> buttress and knuckle threads of constant pitch. The heat transfer and friction factor data obtained is compared with the data obtained from a plain circular tube under similar geometric and flow conditions. The variations of heat transfer and pressure loss {{in the form of}} Nusselt number (Nu) and friction factor (f) respectively is determined and depicted graphically. It is observed that at all Reynolds number, the Nusselt number and thermal performance increases for a circular tube with buttress threads as compared with a circular tube with <b>acme</b> and knuckle <b>threads.</b> These are because of increase in strength and intensity of vortices ejected from the buttress threads.
