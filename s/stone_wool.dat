50|$|A 2011 {{study of}} fire {{toxicity}} of insulating materials at the University of Central Lancashire's Centre for Fire and Hazard Science studied PIR and other commonly used materials under more realistic and wide-ranging conditions {{representative of a}} wider range of fire hazard, observing that most fire deaths resulted from toxic product inhalation. The study evaluated the degree to which toxic products were released, looking at toxicity, time-release profiles, and lethality of doses released, in a range of flaming, non-flaming, and poorly ventilated fires, and concluded that PIR generally released a considerably higher level of toxic products than the other insulating materials studied (PIR > PUR > EPS > PHF; glass and <b>stone</b> <b>wools</b> also studied). In particular, hydrogen cyanide is recognised as a significant contributor to the fire toxicity of PIR (and PUR) foams.|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the potential carcinogenic hazard of five man-made vitreous fibers (MMVF) following the recommendations of the dust subgroup of the German Maximale Arbeitsplatz Konzentration (MAK) Commission. This was done by rating the tumors arising from intraperitoneal injection in the rat, relative to the number of injected fibers with length (L) > 5 mu m, diameter (Di 5 contained in the sample. Fibers from glass and <b>stone</b> <b>wools</b> were selected for this evaluation. At the outset of this study, because of their chemical composition, the substances tested were considered new-generation insulation wool fibers. As an example, their "solubility" as measured in vitro at pH 7. 4 was higher than those of insulation wool fibers used at that time. The samples have been specially manufactured and processed in order to improve their concentration in fibers fitting the criteria of length and diameter required by the protocol of this study. This was done for several purposes. The first one was to test fibers that are as similar as possible to those encountered at the workplace (median diameter below I mu m and median length between 10 and 15 mu m), in order to facilitate extrapolation to the human situation. The second one was to allow injection of the highest possible dose of fibers under a tolerable volume, since too large a volume and/or too high a number of injections may increase the risk of artifactual responses. In addition, the highest doses were selected on the basis of the recommendations of the dust subgroup of the German MAK Commission along with our decision to limit the number of injections to two. Female Wistar rats were used as a model. They received an intraperitoneal injection of various masses (from 0. 7 to 55 mg) of sample, and then were followed during an observation period of 130 wk. The positive controls (long-fiber crocidolite from 0. 005 to 0. 5 mg) exhibited a significant dose-related occurrence of mesotheliomas. According to the MAK Commission criteria, a carcinogenic potential was demonstrated for fiber H (at the highest dose, 55 mg). The other fibers (A, C, F, and C) did not show any statistically significant carcinogenic potential at the tested doses...|$|R

This insulation product isused for fire and thermal insulation of technical installations. The insulation consists of stoneor glass wool with a sewn on steel wire netting on the out facing side. This netting has thepurpose to enable fastening to e. g. ventilation ducts and to provide bounding of joints. Thiswire netting makes regular methods for fitting <b>stone</b> or glass <b>wool</b> non applicable.

40|$|For this New York {{exhibition}} in which I showed 3 pieces the international artist and curator Matthew Higgs brought 19 emerging and established artists together. Citing contradictory and deconstructive impulses in recent art, Higgs referenced artists whose work plays with or otherwise upsets the modernist art historical canon, citing, for example, Bataille’s 'informe', a contemporary sense of unease, and {{a tension between}} the organic and inorganic. My own work makes a contribution in all these areas, particularly in its use of vernacular materials, its references to craft and to imperfection, {{and the way it}} provides evidence of gesture and the work of the hand. It reframes and rearticulates the concerns of an earlier generation of artists such as Dubuffet in a post-modern context. My largest piece, ‘Zusammenhang’, was a web-like installation using organic materials such as <b>wool,</b> <b>stones</b> and paint, assembled by crochet, knitting and knots. Its tensile structure was fragile: twigs were often precariously balanced in leather. The work was predicated on both literal and metaphysical balance, and the possibility of its opposite. ‘Gelände’ used flesh coloured wool crocheted into an abstract, mountain-like landscape linked with twigs and bits of copper mounted on a blue plaster plinth on an ironing board. ‘Frau mit Kopftuch’, in plaster, paint, wood and leather depicted an ambiguous creature, neither human nor animal, hatching eggs. All 3 pieces were bought by well-known US collectors, the largest, ‘Zusammenhang’, by DIA, a multi-disciplinary contemporary arts foundation based in New York that owns {{one of the most influential}} collections in the USA and, arguably, the world.

40|$|Thermal {{insulation}} materials for buildings provide thermal energy cost savings, hence much attention is directed towards improving their performances {{and construction of}} new ones. Inorganic fibrous materials - <b>stone</b> and glass <b>wool</b> and organic foamy materials- expanded and extruded polystyrene are dominant on the European market. However, the EU priorities of creating products with improved ecological footprint have led towards research for developing new {{insulation materials}}. Evaluation {{of the performance of}} insulation materials is a multi-criteria problem, which has to be carried out with respect to: physical properties, health and environmental protection, applicability as building elements and their cost. Recycled textile waste has already found commercial application as insulation material but so far only waste that is easy to open down to fibers has been used. This paper proposes an alternative solution of a new textile structure that will be used for thermal insulation of buildings’ internal walls in order to prevent the loss of a valuable resource, pre-consumer apparel cutting waste. The designed textile structure is composed of polyester fabric apparel cutting waste which is shredded, rather than opened. Thermal conductivity - λ(W/mK) of the textile structure was measured with the Heat flow meter FOX 600 instrument. The main goal was to determine the thermal insulation of the structure compared to the standard insulation structures, as well as textile insulating structures in form of fibers. The results of the 10 samples showed thermal conductivity coefficient (λ= 0, 052 - 0, 060 W/mK), comparable to the values of standard insulation materials (λ= 0, 030 - 0, 045 W/mK) and the values of insulation materials made from recycled textile fibers (λ= 0, 039 - 0, 041 W/mK). In addition to the economic benefits, production of this kind of insulation material will have an ecologic benefit by decreasing environmental pollution arising from polyester apparel cutting waste. ...|$|R
50|$|Information in Eisen {{folklore}} poetry collection {{dating back}} to 1915:In Vastseliina parish, near Meeksi village (a Seto village near Pihkva border) by a small stream, that separates Liivi province from Pihkva province, there is a stone, where Seto people still bring sacrifices. The stone stands in Liivi province. It is called St John’s Stone. People say: St John used {{to sleep on the}} stone. Every St John’s Day, a Russian priest comes to the stone and Seto people from every corner of Setumaa come to the stone and bring sacrifice to St John. The sacrifices are mostly butter and eggs. If Servitude of God be ended, the priest takes half the sacrifice and the other half is for the poor. When Servitude of God is held, the river is said to have holy water in it and if the ill wash themselves in the water, the illness disappears. At one time, when a cow-shelter was made in Meeksi village, a piece was taken from St John’s stone and laid in the wall, so that cows would not die. When the shelter was finished, every year two-three cows still died. Then the piece of St John’s stone was taken from the wall and there were no deaths among the animals anymore. (E 49367 (1) < Vastseliina region — R. Tamm (1915))According to the lore originating from 1953, cottage cheese and wool made exactly for this purpose were taken to the St John’s stone:A week before St John’s Day, St John’s milk was taken: the milk was skimmed and cottage cheese was made. It was taken to Meeksi and placed on the St John’s <b>stone.</b> <b>Wool</b> was also placed on the stone. Whatever was taken on the stone, the poor got for their own after.
