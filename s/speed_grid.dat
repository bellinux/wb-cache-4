Matrix converter {{is an attractive}} option for such applications. Variable speed of the wind generator demands variable voltage variable frequency at the generator terminal. Matrix converter is used in this work to generate such a supply. Also, matrix converter can be appropriately controlled to compensate the grid for non-linear, reactive loads. However, any change of power factor on the grid side reflects on the voltage magnitude on the wind generator side. It is highlighted that this may contradict the {{maximum power point tracking}} control requirements. All the results of this work are presented...|$|E
40|$|An {{approach}} is presented for {{the generation of}} two-dimensional, structured, dynamic grids. The grid motion {{may be due to}} the motion of the boundaries of the computational domain or to the adaptation of the grid to the transient, physical solution. A time-dependent grid is computed through the time integration of the <b>grid</b> <b>speeds</b> which are computed from a system of <b>grid</b> <b>speed</b> equations. The <b>grid</b> <b>speed</b> equations are derived from the time-differentiation of the grid equations so as to ensure that the dynamic grid maintains the desired qualities of the static grid. The grid equations are the Euler-Lagrange equations derived from a variational statement for the grid. The dynamic grid method is demonstrated for a model problem involving boundary motion, an inviscid flow in a converging-diverging nozzle during startup, and a viscous flow over a flat plate with an impinging shock wave.

MFTF used accurate information about resources, something difficult to be obtained in the real world.

30|$|A WTG {{possesses}} {{a significant amount}} of kinetic energy in the rotating masses, which can be utilized to provide a short-term frequency support in the event of large power imbalance [76]. In general, wind turbines can be divided into two main groups: fixed-speed WTs (FSWT) and variable-speed WTs (VSWT). Each group has distinctive benefits and drawbacks in terms of their contributions to system frequency support. The FSWT can inherently provide a limited inertial response to mitigate the ROCOF. In contrast, VSWTs cannot naturally deliver any inertial power into the electrical grid due to partial or full decoupling between rotor <b>speed</b> and <b>grid</b> frequency via the power converter. Nevertheless, modern VSWTs are capable of providing an emulated inertial response that is superior to that of conventional generators, due to their faster, more accurate and flexible active power controls and the wide range over which the wind turbine rotor speed can vary [17, 23, 26, 33, 51]. Last but not least, a novel type of VSWT based on the electromagnetic coupler (WT-EMC) can provide frequency support through emulated inertial response and droop frequency regulation [19].|$|R
