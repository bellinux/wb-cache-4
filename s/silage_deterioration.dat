40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the effects of}} the predominant lactic acid bacteria (LAB) on the fermentation characteristics and aerobic stability of total mixed ration (TMR) silage containing soybean curd residue (SC-TMR silage). The SC-TMR materials were ensiled in laboratory silos for 14 or 56 days. LAB predominant in SC-TMR silage were identified (Exp. 1). Lactobacillus fermentum (L. fermentum) and Streptococcus bovis (S. bovis) were found in the untreated materials, Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides (L. pseudomesenteroides) in 14 -day silage and Lactobacillus plantarum (L. plantarum) in all silages. Pediococcus acidilactici (P. acidilactici), Lactobacillus paracasei (L. paracasei), and Lactobacillus brevis (L. brevis) formed more than 90 % of the isolates in 56 -day silage. Italian ryegrass and whole crop maize were inoculated with P. acidilactici and L. brevis isolates and the fermentation and aerobic stability determined (Exp. 2). Inoculation with P. acidilactici and L. brevis alone or combined improved the fermentation products in ryegrass silage and markedly enhanced its aerobic stability. In maize silage, P. acidilactici and L. brevis inoculation caused no changes and suppressed deterioration when combined with increases in acetic acid content. The results indicate that P. acidilactici and L. brevis may produce a synergistic effect to inhibit SC-TMR <b>silage</b> <b>deterioration.</b> Further studies are needed to identify the inhibitory substances, which may be useful for developing potential antifungal agents...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: As an {{alternative}} system to glass jars, mini-silo consisting of polypropylene (PP) container for laboratory studies of fermentation dynamics in silage was proposed {{in our previous}} study. However, suitability of this mini-silo was questioned, as {{there was a slight}} probability of air penetration into container, which would lead to <b>silage</b> <b>deterioration.</b> In this study, an improvement of the original mini-silo system for ensiling was undertaken. A non-transparent PP container was replaced with a see-through container made of co-polymer poly-propylene (PP), which had a lid with layer of silicon on its edge, which made this mini-silo practically air-proof. The lid was equipped with a special water valve, for releasing of gas products of the fermentation from the silage. Moreover, the see-through container made a provision for monitoring of micro-organisms growth and thus better explanation of the obtained results on silage microbiological status. The improved silage system was tested in an experiment in which alfalfa was compacted into transparent containers with addition of two bacterial inoculants. On day 50, percentage of silage surface covered with moulds was visually estimated and samples were taken for determination of total number of moulds and volatile fatty acids. Improved mini-silo system for silage laboratory studies proposed in this paper is simple, economical, practical and capable of preventing air penetration into the silage...|$|E
40|$|Wet {{brewers grains}} and soybean curd residue were stored in laboratory-scale silos without (BG and SC silages, respectively) or with other {{ingredients}} as total mixed rations (BGT and SCT silages, respectively). Silages were opened after 14 and 56 d, and microbial counts, fermentation products, and aerobic stability were determined. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis {{was carried out}} to examine bacterial communities, and several bacteria {{that appeared to be}} involved in fermentation were identified. Lactic acid content was greater in SCT than in BGT silage, but lower in SC than in BG silage. Ethanol content was greater in BG than in SC regardless of <b>silage</b> type. Aerobic <b>deterioration</b> occurred promptly in ensiling materials (nonensiled by-products and total mixed ration mixtures) and in silages stored alone; however, SCT and BGT <b>silages</b> resisted <b>deterioration</b> and no heating was found for more than 5. 5 d regardless of storage period. Silages were stable even with high yeast populations at silo opening, whereas prolonged ensiling decreased yeast counts in the 2 total mixed ration silages. The denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis profiles appeared similar between SCT and BGT silages but not between SC and BG silages. Weissella spp. and Lactobacillus brevis were common in aerobically stable SCT and BGT silages, and Lactobacillus buchneri was detected only in BGT silage. Both L. brevis and L. buchneri were found in silage but not in ensiling materials. Several other lactic acid bacteria were also identified in SCT and BGT silages, but {{did not appear to be}} related to fermentation and aerobic stability. </p...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the dynamics associated with prolonged ensiling and aerobic deterioration of whole crop corn (WCC) silages and total mixed ration (TMR) silages containing WCC (C-TMR silages) to clarify the differences that account for the enhanced aerobic stability of TMR silages. Laboratory-scale barrel silos were randomly opened after 7, 14, 28, and 56 d of ensiling and were subjected to analyses of fermentation quality, microbial and temperature dynamics during aerobic exposure. WCC and C-TMR silages were both well preserved and microorganisms were inhibited with prolonged ensiling, including lactic acid bacteria. Yeast were inhibited to below the detection limit of 500 cfu/g fresh matter within 28 d of ensiling. Aerobic stability of both silages was enhanced with prolonged ensiling, whereas C-TMR silages were more aerobically stable than WCC silages for the same ensiling period. Besides the high moisture content, the weak aerobic stability of WCC silage is likely attributable to the higher lactic acid content and yeast count, which result from the high water-soluble carbohydrates content in WCC. After silo opening, yeast {{were the first to}} propagate and the increase in yeast levels is greater than that of other microorganisms in <b>silages</b> before <b>deterioration.</b> Besides, increased levels of aerobic bacteria were also detected before heating of WCC silages. The temperature dynamics also indicated that yeast are closely associated with the onset of the aerobic <b>deterioration</b> of C-TMR <b>silage,</b> whereas for WCC silages, besides yeast, aerobic bacteria also function in the aerobic deterioration. Therefore, the inclusion of WCC might contribute to the survival of yeast during ensiling but not influence the role of yeast in <b>deterioration</b> of C-TMR <b>silages...</b>|$|R
40|$|We {{observed}} the infl uence of silage additives for choice qualitative parameters at 109 samples of clovergrass silages in working conditions. We evaluated total classifi cation and categorization to quality classes according to fermentation process. It {{has been found}} out positive effect of the silage additives for fermentation class and for total silage quality of silages. This positive effec t has been more considerable at classifi cation to the fermentation classes at clover-grass silages. The high content of crude fi bre decreased fermentation results and total silage quality at test clover-grass <b>silages.</b> The greatest (<b>deterioration)</b> infl uence for clasifi cation to total quality class has crude fi bre content. It is see from correlation coefi cient at clover-grass silages – r = 0, 75 (P < 0, 05). The weak dependence r = 0, 37 (P < 0, 05) was detected between fermentation class and acetic acid content. It was detected large dependence between fermentation class and butyric acid content r = 0, 73 (P < 0, 05) ...|$|R
40|$|Corn and forage sorghum silages {{were stored}} in small (simulated), farm-scale, bunker silos for 180 days, and dry matter (DM) and organic matter (OM) losses; {{fermentation}} characteristics; and temperatures were measured at 10, 20, and 30 {{inches from the}} original silage surface. Sealing the exposed surface significantly increased DM and OM recoveries in both crops, regardless of depth. Immediate sealing preserved more DM and OM than delayed sealing, particularly at the 10 -in. depth. The unsealed silages from both crops maintained dramatically higher temperatures within the top 3 ft. than sealed silages. As expected, the unsealed silages deteriorated completely at 10 - and 20 -in. depths, and the delayed-seal, forage sorghum <b>silage</b> showed considerable <b>deterioration</b> at the 10 -in. depth. The immediately sealed corn silages had better fermentation profiles than their forage sorghum counterparts. A mold inhibitor, Top Savor®, increased OM recovery by about 2 percent in the forage sorghum silage, but {{had no effect on}} corn silage. These results indicate that sealing (covering) silos immediately after filling greatly improves storage efficiency and silage quality in the top 3 ft...|$|R
40|$|Fully {{fermented}} whole-plant {{corn silage}} is often sold in small quantities to cattle producers. The {{purpose of this}} experiment {{was to determine if}} adding a bacterial-based silage inoculant to corn <b>silage</b> would reduce <b>deterioration.</b> A total of 18, 000 kg of fully fermented corn silage was removed from a bunker silo and placed into a pile. The pile was subdivided into 8 sections with an inoculant top-dressed to alternating sections. Samples from the top 15 cm were collected at 0, 24, 48, 72, 120, 240, and 336 h after top-dressing the inoculant to the pile. Results indicated that there were no effects of inoculant on DM, NDF, ADF, CP, and ash content of the corn silage. There were no differences between treatments for lactic acid and pH over time. Acetic acid concentration was similar between treatments except the control treatment was higher at 120 h. Mold counts were higher in the control corn silage at 336 h compared with the silage that had inoculant applied. Yeast counts were higher at 24, 48, and 72 h for the control corn silage than for the inoculated corn silage. Deoxynivalenol and zearalenone were not affected by treatment. Top-dressing an inoculant did not overwhelmingly reduce spoilage when fully fermented corn silage was purchased in small quantities. Corn silage appears to maintain its nutrient concentration during the winter for up to 240 h...|$|R
40|$|Germination {{and growth}} of spores of butyric acid {{bacteria}} (BAB) may cause severe defects in semihard cheeses. Silage is {{the main source of}} BAB spores in cheese milk. The objectives of the study were to determine the significance of grass silages and corn silages as sources of BAB spores and to investigate the relationships between high concentrations of BAB spores in corn <b>silage</b> and aerobic <b>deterioration.</b> In the first survey, samples were taken from various locations in silos containing grass and corn silages and from mixed silages in the ration offered to the cows on 21 farms. We demonstrated that the quantity of BAB spores consumed by cows was determined by a small fraction of silage with a high concentration of spores (above 5 log(10) BAB/g). High concentrations were most often found in corn silage within areas with visible molds (69 % of the samples). Areas with visible molds in grass silage and surface layers of corn silage contained, respectively, 21 and 19 % of the cases of concentrations above 5 log 10 BAB spores/g. Based on these results, we concluded that currently in the Netherlands, corn silage is a more important source of BAB than is grass silage. In a second survey, 8 corn silages were divided into 16 sections and each section was studied in detail. High concentrations of BAB spores were found in only the top 50 cm of these 8 silages. Elevated concentrations of BAB spores were associated with different signs of aerobic deterioration. In 13 % of the sections in corn silage with more than 5 log 10 yeasts and molds/g, more than 5 log 10 BAB spores/g were found. Sections with a temperature of more than 5 C above ambient temperature contained, in 21 % of the cases, more than 5 log 10 BAB spores/g. Concentrations above 5 log 10 BAB spores/g were measured in 50 % of the sections with a pH above 4. 4. All sections with a pH above 4. 4 also showed a temperature that was more than 5 C above ambient temperature and a concentration of yeasts and molds above 5 log 10 cfu/g. Based on these results, we postulated that high concentrations of BAB spores in corn silage are the result of oxygen penetration into the silage, resulting in aerobic deterioration and the formation of anaerobic niches with an increased pH just below the surface. Growth of BAB in these anaerobic niches with an increased pH caused the locally high concentrations of BAB in corn silage...|$|R
