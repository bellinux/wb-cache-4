25|$|Ore {{was brought}} to the surface up a winding shaft outside the coe. The miners' {{equipment}} included picks, hammers and wedges to split the rock, wiskets or baskets to contain it, corves or sledges to drag it to the <b>shaft</b> <b>bottom,</b> and windlasses or stows, to lift it to the surface. In later years underground transport was improved by replacing corves by wagons, often running on wooden or metal rails. A good example of an 18th-century wooden railway {{can be found in the}} Merry Tom mine, near Via Gellia. The miners avoided the need to excavate hard rock whenever they could and where it was unavoidable sometimes resorted to fire-setting. A fire was built against the rock face after mining had finished for the day and allowed to burn through the night. Fragmentation of the heated rock was increased by throwing water on to it. The rule about fire-setting only after the end of the day's work was important because in the confined mines the smoke was deadly. Fire-setting was a skilled technique and was used sparingly for that reason as well as because of the disruption caused by the smoke and the danger from splintering rock.|$|E
500|$|At 3:00am on 14 October 1913, the day firemen {{descended the}} pit {{to conduct the}} daily checks for gas; they had three hours to {{complete}} their investigations. The firemen for the Mafeking return had to travel more than {{two miles from the}} <b>shaft</b> <b>bottom</b> to the workface. It left insufficient time in which to make a thorough check of the workings—which involved placing a naked flame into cavities to see if the flame lengthened—although the historian Michael Lieven states that [...] "the company considered any other form of inspection to be too time-consuming". Between 5:10 and 6:00am 950 men descended the shaft for a shift that was due to last until 2:00pm.|$|E

5000|$|The deepest {{hard rock}} mine in North America is Agnico-Eagle's LaRonde mine, which mines gold, zinc, copper and silver ores roughly 45 km east of Rouyn-Noranda in Cadillac, Quebec. LaRonde's Penna shaft (#3 shaft) is {{believed}} to be the deepest single lift shaft in the Western Hemisphere. The new #4 <b>shaft</b> <b>bottoms</b> out at over 3000 m down. Their LaRonde mine expansion sees open stopes down to a depth of over 3000 m, the deepest longhole open stopes in the world.|$|R
5000|$|In 1933, Abram Colliery {{closed and}} its shafts to the Arley mine were {{taken over by}} Bickershaw. [...] This {{consolidation}} resulted in a modernisation scheme {{to open up the}} Peacock and Plodder mines, and an additional area of Wigan seam. Nos. 3 and 4 shafts were deepened to 779 yd yards and 787 yd yards respectively, taking the <b>shaft</b> <b>bottoms</b> just below the Plodder seam. By 1937 an electric winder was installed on both shafts, with cages to accept ten-ton capacity skips in No.4.|$|R
50|$|Balanced {{friction}} hoists are {{not suitable}} for hoisting from multiple loading pockets on different horizons within a shaft, and are generally {{not suitable for}} deep shafts. Friction hoists can not operate at normal speeds if the <b>shaft</b> <b>bottom</b> is flooded and water reaches the tail ropes.|$|E
50|$|Some shafts {{do not use}} guide beams {{but instead}} utilize steel wire rope (called Guide ropes) kept in tension by massive weights at <b>shaft</b> <b>bottom</b> called cheese weights (because of their {{resemblance}} to a truckle or wheel of cheese) as these are easier to maintain and replace.|$|E
50|$|For this reason, and to {{minimise}} {{the number}} of persons on the <b>shaft</b> <b>bottom</b> a number of projects have successfully switched to shotcrete for this temporary lining. Research and development {{in this area is}} focusing on the robotic application of shotcrete and the commercialisation of thin sprayed polymer liners.|$|E
50|$|Hope Pit was sunk {{close by}} in 1827 and the Blossom Pit on the {{opposite}} side of the Wakefield to Austerlands turnpike road, the A642, was sunk by 1840. Hope Pit's shaft descends 215 yards and produced coal after 1829. The coal was wound by horse gins until the 1920s. It was one of the earliest Yorkshire coal mines to use electrical coal cutters. The Inman Water Shaft was sunk to 97 yards in about 1840 to pump water from Hope Pit and its beam engine house survives. The shaft was later deepened to the New Hards Seam. The pits were originally ventilated by furnaces at the <b>shaft</b> <b>bottoms.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Raise bore, a {{circular}} <b>shaft</b> mined <b>bottom</b> up using mechanical rollers to achieve shaft profile. This method works well in larger stopes however requires both access to {{top and bottom}} of stoping block. Raise bores work most effectively between 45 and 90 deg.|$|R

50|$|Due {{to higher}} levels of water ingress as the mine shafts were {{developed}} under the North Sea, and resultant higher costs of operation and coal extraction, it was decided to close the mine in the mid-1960s. The final shift came up from <b>shaft</b> <b>bottom</b> on 8 June 1968.|$|E
50|$|Beneath {{the lowest}} Shaft Station the shaft {{continues}} {{on for some}} distance, this area {{is referred to as}} the <b>Shaft</b> <b>Bottom.</b> A tunnel called a Ramp typically connects the bottom of the shaft with the rest of the mine, this Ramp often contains the mine's water handling facility, called the Sump, as water will naturally flow to the lowest point in the mine.|$|E
50|$|The {{colliery}} {{was originally}} opened as Arael Griffin {{on the site}} of an earlier balance shaft which had been sunk in 1863 by Thomas Phillips Price at Hafod Van. In 1892 John Lancaster and Co. began sinking two 352 yd shafts {{on the opposite side of}} the Ebbw Fach River. On 9 February 1895 four men lost their lives during the shaft sinking, when the boat in which they were riding capsized, and they fell to the <b>shaft</b> <b>bottom.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Among {{the deadliest}} {{incidents}} was the horrendous Central Shaft accident. On October 17, 1867, workers were digging the tunnel's [...] vertical exhaust shaft when a {{candle in the}} hoist building ignited naphtha fumes that had leaked from a [...] "Gasometer" [...] lamp. The ensuing explosion set the hoist on fire, and it collapsed into the shaft. Four men {{near the top of}} the shaft escaped, but 13 men working [...] below were trapped by falling naphtha and pieces of iron. The pumps were also destroyed, and the shaft began to fill with water. A worker named Mallory was lowered into the shaft by rope the next day; he was overcome by fumes and reported no survivors, and no further rescue attempts were made. Several months later, workers reached the <b>shaft's</b> <b>bottom</b> and found that several victims had survived long enough to fashion a raft before suffocating.|$|R
40|$|Speleogenesis {{of narrow}} and {{relatively}} deep karst shafts (avens) was {{studied in the}} Slovak part of the Dolný Vrch Plateau (the Slovak Karst Biosphere Reserve, SE Slovakia). Most of the 211 shafts and shaft-related depressions located on the plateau have similar characteristics and no shaft has a known accessible connection to an active horizontal cave system. Dominant tectonic fractures are sub-vertical (sloping 70 - 90 °) {{in most of the}} shafts. Several microforms, e. g. scallop-like forms, wall troughs or networks of protruding veins, evidence the main speleogenetic processes. Water film dissolution extends the fractures, usually {{at the base of the}} epikarstic zone (Klimchouk, 1995), while the scallop-like forms develop. Then corrosive and erosive action of dripping water takes place and the wall troughs develop downwards - the shaft develops progressively now. Increased carbon dioxide concentration makes the solutions more aggressive and enables the processes working on the <b>shaft</b> <b>bottoms.</b> Water film action and selective condensation corrosion are responsible for upward shaft development. Later, shafts open to the surface, interacting with the effects of surface denudation...|$|R
50|$|On 3 October 2007 3,200 {{employees}} were trapped underground when a 15 metre compressed air pipe broke away just below {{surface in the}} men and material shaft {{and fell to the}} <b>shaft</b> <b>bottom,</b> severely damaging both the shaft steelwork and the electricity supply to the sub men and material shaft. The trapped workers were all brought to surface by 4.00 p.m. the following day after cages had been installed in the rock shaft. 48 days of production were lost.|$|E
50|$|Drum hoists {{require less}} routine {{maintenance}} than a friction hoist, because the haulage cable is {{fixed to the}} drum, and therefore have less downtime, and the maintenance regime is less sophisticated. Drum hoists can continue to operate if the <b>shaft</b> <b>bottom</b> gets flooded and less shaft depth is required below the loading pocket, unlike friction hoists where such flooding could cover the tail ropes and so on. Because drum hoists do not have tail ropes, the hoisting system is more suited to slinging beneath a conveyance.|$|E
50|$|The shaft liner {{does not}} reach {{right to the}} bottom of the shaft during sinking, but lags behind by a fixed {{distance}}. This distance is determined by the methodology of excavation and the design thickness of the permanent liner. To ensure the safety of persons working on the <b>shaft</b> <b>bottom</b> temporary ground support is installed, usually consisting of welded mesh and rock bolts. The installation of the temporary ground support (called bolting) is among the most physically challenging parts of the shaft sinking cycle as bolts must be installed using pneumatic powered rock drills.|$|E
60|$|They {{were still}} busily {{discussing}} {{the matter of}} remaining in the mine all night, {{when they heard the}} kibble descending the <b>shaft,</b> near the <b>bottom</b> of which they sat, and next moment a man came to the ground with considerable violence.|$|R
50|$|On 3 October 2007, 3,200 mine {{workers were}} trapped in the gold mine after an {{accident}} blocked a deep (2.2 km) <b>shaft</b> near the <b>bottom.</b> Rescuers used an adjacent shaft to rescue the miners, {{a spokeswoman for the}} mine's owner, Harmony Gold Mining, said.|$|R
50|$|Short Long Drop is an {{alternative}} entrance located 10 m from the main entrance. A tight rift leads {{to the top of}} an 8 m <b>shaft.</b> At the <b>bottom,</b> a tight crawl connects with the bottom of the first pitch in the main cave.|$|R
5000|$|Nationalisation {{brought about}} a review of pre-war {{development}} plans, which resulted in re-organisation of the pits in the area. After abandoning No.5 shaft in 1950, in 1951 two horizontal 16 ft wide by 13 ft high tunnels were driven 2750 yd in a southerly direction from No's 3 and 4 shafts. In 1960 these tunnels intersected the Crombouke seam, allowing and two more faces to be opened for production. An endless rope haulage was installed and [...] capacity tubs were introduced to take coal to the skip pockets in No.4 <b>shaft</b> <b>bottom.</b>|$|E

Before he could go underground he had three weeks training at the Morrison Busty Colliery in Annfield Plain {{as well as being}} given the equipment he would later need to use. Lamb then started work at the Busty Pit at Craghead Colliery, his 'first job was on the landing as a datal hand and was to send sets of four full tubs outbye (to the <b>shaft</b> <b>bottom)</b> on the haulage rope and then to make sure the putters had plenty of chumins (empty tubs) that came back on the haulage rope' ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{explosion}} {{occurred within}} the Main seam of Dennis. This section, which began more than 1.3 mi from the <b>shaft</b> <b>bottom,</b> was mined down a shallow gradient. Dennis {{was divided into}} six [...] "districts": 20's, 61's, 109's, 14's and 29's. The sixth district was a very deep area known collectively as the [...] "95's and 24's". All the districts in Dennis were worked by the longwall system where the coal face was mined in single blocks. Most districts in the Dennis section were mechanised except 20's and 61's, which were still worked by hand, because they were furthest from the main shaft (approximately 2.75 mi).|$|E
40|$|The Bureau of Mines {{conducted}} research {{to determine the}} effectiveness of long holes drilled in solid virgin coal in degasifying {{an area of the}} Pitts- burgh coalbed showing that horizontal holes drilled into a virgin coalbed from the <b>bottom</b> of any <b>shaft</b> will effectively remove methane gas in commercial quantities from the Pittsburgh coalbed. The in situ pressure at a depth of 214 feet into the coalbed and the average gas and water flows from the five degasification holes were 3 lb/in 2 gage and 860, 000 ft 3 /d and 1. 7 gal/min, respectively. On June 19, 1975, after 593 days of degasification, a compressor was installed and pipeline quality gas was introduced into a commercial pipeline. As of June 1, 1976, after 1, 022 days of degasification, over 753 million cubic feet of gas had been drained and 117 million cubic feet of gas had been purchased by the gas company for use in the local community of Wadestown, W. Va. The gas drained to date is six times the gas estimated to be in the area subtended by the holes. Methane emissions at the working face of 1 West mains, Federal No. 2 mine has been reduced by 50 pct, proving the value of methane drainage by horizontal degasification holes drilled from <b>shaft</b> <b>bottoms</b> ahead of mining...|$|R
5000|$|Temple pillars {{often have}} {{engravings}} of charging horses or hippogryphs (Yali) [...] - [...] horses standing on hind legs with their fore legs lifted and riders on their backs. The horses on some pillars stand {{seven to eight}} feet tall. On {{the other side of}} the pillar are usually carvings from Hindu mythology. Pillars that do not have such hippogryphs are generally rectangular with mythology themed decoration on all sides. Some pillars have a cluster of smaller pillars around a central pillar <b>shaft.</b> The <b>bottom</b> supports of these pillars have engravings of Gods and Goddesses. Carvings of hippogryphs clearly show the adroitness of the artists who created them.|$|R

The disaster led to a public outcry and subsequent Royal Commission led by Anthony Ashley Cooper. Until the Mines and Collieries Act 1842 was passed prohibiting boys under ten {{years of age and}} all women and girls from working underground in coal mines, it was common for women and children to work shifts of 11 or 12 hours underground.
