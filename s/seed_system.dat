40|$|A {{decade of}} {{economic}} and political turmoil in Zimbabwe, as well as a period of radical land reform which reconfigured the country’s agricultural sector, dramatically affected its <b>seed</b> <b>system,</b> reducing supply of quality seeds and undermining regulatory control. This paper aims to understand how Zimbabwe can rebuild a <b>seed</b> <b>system</b> appropriate to the post-land reform context by asking questions about the underlying political economy of this process, exploring the important but often overlooked angle of politics of policymaking and identifying the broader political, economic and institutional factors that affect the way the <b>seed</b> <b>system</b> is structured. As Zimbabwe tries to re-establish its formerly vibrant agricultural sector following land reform, perspectives focus on technical and market solutions, with an absence of concrete analysis and debate about political economic aspects. Yet it is these wider dimensions of policy processes, and particularly the politics underlying these, which inevitably carry the day. Therefore, this study maps the national <b>seed</b> <b>system,</b> examines its historical origins and identifies key policy narratives, actors and networks and political interests shaping the Zimbabwean <b>seed</b> <b>system.</b> It highlights how a number of competing narratives co-exist in the current national policy debate, each suggesting a different route to revitalising the <b>seed</b> <b>system.</b> The dominant narrative, supported by powerful national and international actors and associated interests, has been excluding, obscuring and silencing two important alternative narratives. These alternatives highlight the need to rebuild the private sector with all its ancillary structures for input distribution and the importance of agricultural diversification, non-maize pathways and the need to build from the grassroots. The suppressing of alternatives was done through different political economic processes, justified by particular technical arguments that were supported by clear interests. This potentially undermines longer term recovery based on rebuilding the <b>seed</b> <b>system</b> through the private sector and strengthening formal and informal farmer-based seed systems.

40|$|Some {{decades ago}} {{it became clear}} that formal {{agricultural}} research institutions - and hence formal interventions in agriculture - were somehow missing their targets for African farmers, mainly because their proposed solutions, and the ways these solutions were developed and introduced to African farming communities, did not match the realities of peasant life. It was recommended that the formal research should consider the wider contexts within which farmers operated to formulate better solutions. These solutions are essential for low-resource farmers facing many (socio-economic and cultural) constraints and having to cope with uncertainties (climate change, market variations, soil degradation, political and social unrest). The research presented in this thesis analyses the functioning of West African rice seed systems with regards to this recommendation. It starts with a regional focus (seven West African coastal countries) and then focuses on specific in-depth field studies undertaken in Guinea (with some comparison from neighbouring Sierra Leone). The study is based on an interdisciplinary approach combining methods from social and natural sciences. Findings show that despite efforts from governments, policy makers and formal agricultural research, the informal <b>seed</b> <b>system</b> still predominates, largely because it is the <b>seed</b> <b>system</b> closest to low-resource farmers. The objective of replacing the informal <b>seed</b> <b>system</b> by a formal <b>seed</b> <b>system</b> exclusively promoting improved varieties is a distant prospect. The research shows that local varieties are, to a large extent, superior to improved varieties in the sub-optimal conditions facing most farmers. It is also shown that even when improved varieties suit farmers’ conditions they are often channeled through inappropriate institutional arrangements that block access by low-resource farmers. Formal seed projects often lack follow-up to sustain actions. Innovations are lost between research planning, donor requirements to demonstrate adoption and the realities of peasant coping strategies. It is argued that success indicators in the formal <b>seed</b> <b>system</b> need to be redefined based on a clear conceptual divide between variety dissemination and bulk seed supply. The formal <b>seed</b> <b>system</b> merges these two activities whereas the informal <b>seed</b> <b>system</b> pursues a different path and addresses different procedural constraints. We suggest seed projects should concentrate on variety dissemination and leave bulk seed supply to local seed dealers. The thesis demonstrates that local dealers are effective and more closely in tune with farmer needs. The major finding of this thesis is that the informal <b>seed</b> <b>system</b> is closer to farmers, and works well, because it reflects (and is integrated with) local ideas about food security and social solidarity. This social dimension is missing in the formal system, designed and funded by experts who neither live by planting rice nor share in the local sets of assumptions about social reciprocity and obligation. Guinea may be undermining its long-term food security if it continues to seek to replace a social <b>seed</b> <b>system</b> with one driven solely by abstract ideas of economic rationality. The better option, supported by the weight of evidence in this thesis, is to seek complementarity and synergy between the two systems.

40|$|In Ethiopia, use of low-quality seed {{potatoes}} {{by the majority}} of potato growers is associated with underdevelopment of the seed potato value chains. Three seed potato systems are present in Ethiopia: the informal <b>seed</b> <b>system,</b> the alternative <b>seed</b> <b>system</b> and the formal <b>seed</b> <b>system.</b> This chapter analyses the performance of seed potato value chains with respect to their ability to supply quality seed tubers to seed potato systems, by using the chain performance drivers enabling environment, technology, market structure, chain coordination, farm management, and inputs. Information obtained from literature review, secondary data and key informants’ interviews were used for the analysis. In the informal <b>seed</b> <b>system,</b> seed potato value chains suffered from a poor enabling environment such as a low quality technical support and lack of a seed quality control system; use of sub-optimal storage and transportation technologies, sub-optimal farm management practices; and little use of inputs. In the alternative <b>seed</b> <b>system,</b> main constraints were the lack of a seed potato quality control system, poor farm management practices, little use of inputs by seed potato growers, and a distorted seed potato market that resulted from involvement of institutional buyers.

40|$|The {{threats of}} climate change and rising food prices have stirred renewed {{attention}} for seed and food security in Africa, inviting new thinking {{on the role of}} seed sector development in coping with these concerns. One conceptual framework that has gained attention is the Integrated Seed Sector Development (ISSD) approach. The ISSD approach has evolved {{as a response to the}} almost exclusive focus on formal <b>seed</b> <b>systems</b> in <b>seed</b> sector development programs.

An analysis of the evolution of seed policies and regulatory frameworks in Kenya since independence indeed exposes a continuous support for the formal seed sector while support given to the informal sector has merely been intended to transform it into formal.

Approximately 80 % of the smallholder farmers in Africa depend for their seed on the informal <b>seed</b> <b>system,</b> consisting of farmers involved in selection, production and dissemination of seed. The lack of overhead, distribution and seed testing costs enables seed-producing farmers to offer seed for low prices, but seed quality is not always good. Seed-producing farmers multiply their seed on-farm without frequent seed renewal, referred to as seed recycling, which may lead to low seed quality. This research analysed the effect of seed recycling on physiological quality and seed health of cowpea and maize, and compared seed quality of the formal and informal <b>seed</b> <b>system.</b>   We tested the physical and physiological quality of cowpea seeds produced by the formal and informal <b>seed</b> <b>system.</b> Five out of six foundation seed samples, 79 out of 81 samples of farmers’ seed, and six out of six seed company samples failed to meet standards for foundation and certified seeds of the National Agriculture Seed Council (NASC), the seed industry regulatory agency in Nigeria. No evidence was found for a negative effect of seed recycling on physiological quality of cowpea seeds. We analysed 45, 500 cowpea seeds for seed-borne bacteria and fungi to compare the performance of formal and informal seed systems. All samples were heavily infected with seed-borne pathogens, including  Fusarium oxysporum (69 % of the samples) and Macrophomina phaseolina (76 %). No evidence was found that seed recycling in the informal <b>seed</b> <b>system</b> did lead to increased levels of seed-borne pathogens. We also analysed seed quality of farmer-produced maize seed to compare it with the formal <b>seed</b> <b>system.</b> The seed company samples had significantly higher germination (99. 3 %) than farmer-produced seed (97. 7 %), but not a single sample passed the requirements for certified seed of the NASC. Twelve seed-borne pathogens were identified including Bipolaris maydis (found in 45 % of the farmer-produced samples), Botryodiplodia theobromae (97 %) and Fusarium verticillioides (100 %). Seed recycling had no {{negative effect on the}} physiological quality or seed health of maize seed. We analysed formal and informal seed systems to assess the opportunities to prevent mycotoxigenic fungi infection in maize seeds. A range of control methods to avoid fungal infection and mycotoxin production is discussed in relation to three criteria for sustainable implementation in developing countries. An integrated approach is recommended, with special attention towards the local <b>seed</b> <b>system.</b> As an overall conclusion of the work it can be stated that the informal <b>seed</b> <b>system</b> did not underperform compared to the formal <b>seed</b> <b>system</b> for cowpea, but did underperform in relation to seed company samples of maize. There was no evidence that seed recycling reduces seed quality of cowpea and maize seed samples, so frequent seed renewal will not improve seed quality of the informal <b>seed</b> <b>system.</b> We recommend a new quality assurance system for the informal <b>seed</b> <b>system</b> based on seed quality testing by farmers themselves, without interference by government or external laboratories. Farmers publish their seed testing results on the bag, while buyers can retest the seed to verify the quality. Further research is required to develop and implement this system in different countries, agro-ecologies and crops, and to develop methods that enable farmers to test seed health quality themselves...|$|E
