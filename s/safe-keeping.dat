5|$|Lord Herbert {{left the}} castle {{to join the}} {{campaign}} against Parliament, returning at intervals to acquire more funds for the war. Charles I himself visited the castle twice, first in June 1645 after the battle of Naseby and again in 1646, when he enjoyed playing bowls on the castle's green. The Royalist cause was now close to military collapse, and the Marquess started to send some valuables, including the oak panelling from the parlour, some plaster ceiling and many pictures, to his brother at nearby Troy House for <b>safe-keeping.</b> Lord Herbert was captured in Ireland, and an attack on Raglan itself appeared imminent.|$|E
5|$|When {{civil war}} broke out in 1642 between the {{supporters}} of Charles and those of Parliament, Camber Castle had not been entirely closed and was {{being used as a}} royal munitions store. The citizens of Rye sided with Parliament, which agreed that the weapons and stores in the castle should be removed and taken to the town for <b>safe-keeping.</b> Concerned that it might be seized by Royalist forces, Parliament went on to dismantle the castle over the next year, stripping the lead from the roof, blocking up the gunports and demolishing the living accommodation. As a result, Camber Castle was not used by the Royalists during the Second English Civil War in 1648, despite several other of the Device Forts along the south coast being occupied.|$|E
5|$|Doom and his toon henchmen {{discover}} Roger, {{but he and}} Valiant escape with Benny, an anthropomorphic taxicab. They flee to a theater, where Valiant {{explains to}} Roger that a toon killed Teddy when they were investigating a crime in Toontown. As they leave with Dolores, Valiant sees a newsreel detailing the sale of Maroon Cartoons to Cloverleaf, a mysterious corporation that bought the city's trolley network shortly before Acme's murder. Valiant goes to the studio to confront Maroon, leaving Roger to guard outside, but Jessica knocks Roger out and puts him in the trunk. Maroon tells Valiant that he blackmailed Acme into selling his company {{so that he could}} then sell the studio, but is killed before he can explain the consequences of the missing will. Valiant spots Jessica fleeing the scene and, assuming she is the culprit, follows her into Toontown. Jessica reveals that Doom killed Acme and Maroon and that the former had given her his will for <b>safe-keeping,</b> but she discovered that the will was blank. She and Valiant are soon captured by Doom and the weasels.|$|E

25|$|The University {{has been}} without its {{original}} Bull since the mid-sixteenth century. In 1560, during the political unrest accompanying the Scottish Reformation, the then chancellor, Archbishop James Beaton, {{a supporter of}} the Marian cause, fled to France. He took with him, for <b>safe-keeping,</b> many of the archives and valuables of the Cathedral and the University, including the Mace and the Bull. Although the Mace was sent back in 1590, the archives were not. Principal Dr James Fall told the Parliamentary Commissioners of Visitation on 28 August 1690, that he had seen the Bull at the Scots College in Paris, together with the many charters granted to the University by the monarchs of Scotland from James II to Mary, Queen of Scots. The University enquired of these documents in 1738 but was informed by Thomas Innes and the superiors of the Scots College, that the original records of the foundation of the University were not to be found. If they had not been lost by this time, they certainly went astray during the French Revolution when the Scots College was under threat. Its records and valuables were moved for <b>safe-keeping</b> out of the city of Paris. The Bull remains the authority by which the University awards degrees.|$|E
25|$|In {{the brutal}} coastal weather, the figurehead {{gradually}} became weathered and eroded. Then, during Hurricane Barbara in 1953, it was significantly damaged and was removed to a city-owned building for <b>safe-keeping.</b> Subsequently, {{a few years}} later, city officials could not locate it, speculating {{that it had been}} stolen, or destroyed by accident. Figureheads had long-since been discontinued as a feature of most ships, but the Norwegian Lady had become more than a mere ship's figurehead to the people of Virginia Beach; she was a memorial and a community icon.|$|E
25|$|Israel Shahak {{was born}} Israel Himmelstaub, in 1933, in Warsaw, Poland, {{and was the}} {{youngest}} child of a cultured, Zionist family of Ashkenazi Jews. During the Second World War, the Nazi Occupation of Poland (1939–45) interned the Shahak family to the Warsaw Ghetto; yet his elder brother escaped Poland to Britain, where he joined the Royal Air Force. Meanwhile, life in occupied Poland forced Shahak's mother to pay a Roman Catholic family to hide Israel, whom they returned when she could not afford their <b>safe-keeping</b> him from the Nazis.|$|E
25|$|In April 1975, in {{settlement}} of a royalties suit between Time Inc. and Zapruder's heirs that {{arose from the}} ABC showing, Time Inc. sold the original film and its copyright back to the Zapruder family for the token sum of $1. Time Inc. wanted to donate the film to the U.S. government. The Zapruder family initially refused to consent, but in 1978 the family transferred the film to the National Archives and Records Administration for appropriate preservation and <b>safe-keeping,</b> while still retaining ownership of the film and its copyright. Director Oliver Stone paid approximately $85,000 to the Zapruder family {{for use of the}} Zapruder film in his motion picture JFK (1991).|$|E
25|$|These interests, {{as much as}} his {{aspirations}} to the titles and the lifestyle of the English landed gentry were influential in the formation of his personal art collection. This collection was mostly displayed in his London home and moved for <b>safe-keeping</b> to the north of England during the Second World War (1939–1945). On his death in 1940 the terms of his will placed his collection under the protection of a special trust established in his name and bequeathed it to the South African nation. Bailey was {{one of the very few}} South African Randlords to leave a bequest of this nature to South Africa.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the units}} which was later to be {{involved}} in the ill-fated attack on Gallipoli arrived in the town in December: the 1,100 men of the Royal Dublin Fusiliers had been relocated from the naval port of Plymouth and before they left the town for the front lines, their commanding officer, Lieutenant-Colonel Rooth, handed over the regimental colours to the town Mayor for <b>safe-keeping.</b> They did not go to France as was expected, but were reassigned to be part of the attack against the Ottoman Empire. During this period recruits for Lord Kitchener's New Army (Men of the Royal Army Medical Corps) had been flooding into the town and were a large presence during the Christmas of 1914.|$|E
25|$|The first paper bank {{notes were}} gold certificates. They were first issued in the 17th century {{when they were}} used by goldsmiths in England and the Netherlands for {{customers}} who kept deposits of gold bullion in their vault for <b>safe-keeping.</b> Two centuries later, the gold certificates began being issued in the United States when the US Treasury issued such certificates that could be exchanged for gold. The United States Government first authorized {{the use of the}} gold certificates in 1863. On April 5, 1933 the US Government restricted the private gold ownership in the United States and therefore, the gold certificates stopped circulating as money (this restriction was reversed on January 1, 1975). Nowadays, gold certificates are still issued by gold pool programs in Australia and the United States, as well as by banks in Germany, Switzerland and Vietnam.|$|E
25|$|By {{the end of}} the month, {{arrangements}} for Freud's own departure for London had become stalled, mired in a legally tortuous and financially extortionate process of negotiation with the Nazi authorities. The Nazi-appointed Kommissar put in charge of his assets and those of the IPA proved to be sympathetic to Freud's plight. Anton Sauerwald had studied chemistry at Vienna University under Professor Josef Herzig, an old friend of Freud's, and evidently retained, notwithstanding his Nazi Party allegiance, a respect for Freud's professional standing. Expected to disclose details of all Freud's bank accounts to his superiors and to follow their instructions to destroy the historic library of books housed in the offices of the IPA, in the event Sauerwald did neither, removing evidence of Freud's foreign bank accounts to his own <b>safe-keeping</b> and arranging the storage of the IPA library in the Austrian National Library where it remained until {{the end of the}} war.|$|E
25|$|The Priory (or Frescati in this vicinity) Stream is now culverted {{under the}} car park but visible again {{as it passes}} a {{neighbouring}} apartment development and then passes under the main road to emerge again in Blackrock Park. The original tunnel which Emily had built to carry seawater to Frescati remains to this day; its whereabouts secret, {{and it has been}} blocked off. In time of threat from unexpected raids by the Crown Militia from Dublin Castle, the course of the stream could well have formed an escape route. One may notice stray cut-granite blocks which look out of place in the car park. These once belonged to the house. The remnants of Frescati are scattered now and hard to trace. The cast-iron railings were stolen, but a few fragments of plasterwork remain in <b>safe-keeping</b> by the conservationists. Ironically for the conservationists, more of the house would have survived if Roches had been allowed go ahead with the demolition in 1971. The stuccoed ceiling which they originally offered to retain is now destroyed.|$|E
25|$|After Phil {{is treated}} at a clinic, Alan confesses {{that he had}} drugged some of the marshmallows from the {{previous}} night with muscle relaxers and ADHD medication in order to sedate Teddy but accidentally mixed up the bags. Phil and Stu become furious that Alan drugged them again. Stu blames Alan for ruining his life and attacks him. Phil breaks it up and tells them {{that they have to}} stick together. They notice something on Alan's stomach: an address and a time for a meeting. They meet a gangster named Kingsley, who demands Chow's bank account password by the next morning in exchange for Teddy. They return to the hotel to try to find Chow's password, only to discover that he is still alive. They steal the monkey (who had the code given to him and put inside his jacket for <b>safe-keeping</b> by Chow) back from the Russian mobsters through a violent car chase, during which the monkey is shot and injured. After taking the code and leaving the monkey at a veterinary clinic, the group completes the deal with Kingsley. Suddenly, Interpol agents appear and arrest Chow. Kingsley turns out to be an undercover agent, who tells the trio that the police had used the information that Teddy had disappeared to arrest Chow and Kingsley actually does not know where Teddy is.|$|E
500|$|This missal {{had been}} {{owned by the}} Legh family since at least 1508. [...] It is the only known nearly {{complete}} copy of the earliest edition of a missal according to the Sarum Rite still in existence. [...] When the family moved from the house in 1946, the missal went with them, and was held for <b>safe-keeping</b> in the John Rylands Library in Manchester. [...] In the late 2000s the National Trust acquired it, and {{it was decided to}} return it to Lyme Park. [...] To celebrate this the décor of the library was restored to the way it had been during the 19thcentury. [...] This included re-graining of its ceiling, reproducing velvet for the upholstery and curtains, and re-papering the room with replica wallpaper, based on its original design.|$|E

On 21 May, Keith was one of three destroyers that evacuated 468 civilians from France. Two days later the ship was in Boulogne-sur-Mer, loading British troops to be evacuated, when she was attacked by German troops. She was hit by a mortar bomb and machine gun fire that killed her captain and wounded many others. Keith sailed for the UK immediately afterwards.|$|E
500|$|One of {{the most}} generous {{donations}} came from Pinchas Rosenberg, the Imperial Court tailor of Saint Petersburg. In the diary of Rabbi Chaim ha-Levy, the emissary who had been sent from Jerusalem to collect funds for the synagogue, Rosenberg set out in details what his money was intended for. Among the items that were bought with his money were two big bronze candelabras; a silver menorah that [...] "arrived miraculously on the 1st Tevet [...] precisely in time to light the last eight Hanukah candles" [...] and an iron door made under the holy ark for <b>safe-keeping</b> of the candlestick. He also earmarked funds towards the building of an [...] "artistically wrought iron fence around the roof under the upper windows so {{that there be a}} veranda on which may stand all our brethren who go up in pilgrimage to behold our desolate Temple, and also a partition for the womenfolk on the Feast of Tabernacles and Simchat Torah".|$|E
500|$|Conditions {{within the}} keep worsened {{by the day}} and the {{garrison}} were reduced to eating horse flesh. In an attempt to reduce the demand on limited provisions, some members were sent out of the keep, beginning with those least capable of fighting. Some sources record that they had their hands and feet amputated by the besiegers. On 30November the garrison eventually surrendered and were taken captive. Initially John wanted to execute them all as was the custom of the time when a garrison had forced a long and bloody conflict. Savaric de Mauléon, one of John's captains, persuaded the king otherwise, concerned that similar treatment would be shown to royal garrisons by the rebels. Only one person was executed: a crossbowman who had previously been {{in the service of the}} king since childhood was hanged. Many of the rebels were imprisoned, sent to royal castles such as Corfe for <b>safe-keeping.</b> Of the siege the Barnwell chronicler wrote, [...] "Our age has not known a siege so hard pressed nor so strongly resisted... Afterwards few cared to put their trust in castles". Prince Louis of France, son of PhilipII, was invited by the barons to become the new leader of the rebellion and become king in the event of their victory. In 1216 he arrived in England and captured Rochester Castle; it is not known how, however, as no documentary evidence recording the event survives.|$|E
500|$|On the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War in 1939 the castle was readied for war-time conditions. Many of the staff from Buckingham Palace were moved to Windsor for safety, security was tightened and windows were blacked-out. There was significant concern that the castle might be damaged or destroyed during the war; the more important art works were removed from the castle for <b>safe-keeping,</b> the valuable chandeliers were lowered to the floor in case of bomb damage and a sequence of paintings by John Piper were commissioned from 1942–4 to record the castle's appearance. The king and queen and their children Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret lived for safety in the castle, with the roof above their rooms specially strengthened in case of attack. The king and queen drove daily to London, returning to Windsor to sleep, although at the time this was a well-kept secret, as for propaganda and morale purposes it was reported that the king was still residing full-time at Buckingham Palace. The castle was also used as a storage facility; for example, the only purified heavy water at the time was rescued from France {{in the face of the}} imminent French defeat in 1940, and most of it was sent to the castle to be stored in the basement alongside the Crown Jewels. After the war the king revived the [...] "dine and sleep" [...] events at Windsor, following comments that the castle had become [...] "almost like a vast, empty museum"; nonetheless, it took many years to restore Windsor Castle to its pre-war condition.|$|E
500|$|The {{murder of}} Nicholas Radford, says R. L. Storey, was only [...] "the curtain raiser" [...] for further {{military}} activities. Devon proceeded {{to raise a}} force and occupy Exeter – [...] "as {{if they were the}} city's lawful garrison" [...] – until just before Christmas, seizing the keys of the city; various houses in the city belonging to Bonville and his supporters were ransacked, and members of the Cathedral were arrested and forced to buy their freedom. In one case, a man was bodily removed from the choir whilst celebrating Mass. Both Bonville and Courtenay had 'extensive relations' with the Cathedral, dating back to the 1430s, but the Courtenays had greatly contributed to its expansion in the previous century. Their actions in 1455 were probably inspired by the fact that Radford had entrusted much of his wealth to the <b>safe-keeping</b> of the church, and Devon saw an opportunity to enrich himself; possibly, says Storey, he was forced to take such action to be able to pay his men. Martin Cherry has pointed to the lack of references to any martial expenses on the earl's behalf in the extant accounts, as indicating that his campaign effectively paid for itself. During the same period, Devon, [...] "in warlike fashion and like an insurrection" [...] also besieged Powderham Castle, which belonged to his distant cousin and Bonville ally, Sir Philip Courtenay; the latter resisted, and Bonville came to his assistance. Prior to doing this, however, he raided the Earl of Devon's house at Colcombe Castle and proceeded to ransack it. Bonville attempted to lift the siege at Powderham on 19 November, but was repulsed by Devon, and lost two men in the fight, which may have involved up to a thousand men. Meanwhile, Devon continued his attempts to persuade the city of Exeter to raise a force on his behalf – which they refused to do – before leaving Exeter on 15 December, as Bonville approached, on his way to Powderham. The two forces met at Clyst, just south west of Exeter.|$|E

2500|$|This calvary {{is part of}} the Plougonven [...] "enclos paroissial". On an {{octagonal}} base, {{the structure}} is 4 metres high and on the two corniches running around this base are a series of sculptural groups which depict scenes from {{the life and death of}} Jesus Christ. Erected in 1554, the sculptural work was executed by the workshop of the [...] "ymageurs", Bastien and Henry Prigent (see note 1) who also worked on the calvary at Pleyben. [...] The calvary suffered considerable damage in 1794 during the aftermath of the French revolution after which the statues were hidden away in the cemetery grounds by the local people for <b>safe-keeping.</b> In 1810 the calvary was re-erected but with a wooden cross, this replaced in 1836 by a cross in stone. Then from 1897 to 1898, the sculptor Yann Larhantec carried out a substantial restoration, taken further in 2009 by Pierre Floc'h. The Calvary is dedicated to St Yves the parish's patron. The enclosure church itself dates to 1523 and is designed in the shape of a Latin cross with a nave and eight side chapels. It contains many sculptures and interesting features.|$|E
2500|$|During the Second Bulgarian Empire {{the churches}} {{did not have}} large or {{complicated}} designs because they were {{intended to be a}} place of penance. Typical of the Tarnovo School of Architecture were relatively small cruciform dome churches or basilicas. At the expense of its small length and width, the churches rose to height. They were often built over a stone base around one meter high. As a principle the main entrance was located to the west. After the doorway followed the pritvor (narthex), the naos and the altar. A small rectangular bell-tower sometimes rose above the narthex ("St Dimitar of Solun" [...] in Tarnovo, the Church in the Asenova krepost in Asenovgrad, [...] the Church of Christ Pantocrator in Nessebar and others). [...] The naos could be separated into naves (in the basilicas) with columns or pillars. [...] According to the number of naves the churches were one-naved ("St Dimitar of Solun" [...] in the Asen's Neighbourhood, Tarnovo, Boyana Church), two-naved ("St Ivan of Rila" [...] in Trapezitsa, Tarnovo) and three-naved (SS. Forty Martyrs Church in Tarnovo, [...] "St Nicola" [...] in Melnik). In the cruciform dome churches (Church of St John Aliturgetos and Church of Christ Pantocrator, both in Nessebar) the dome lied over four columns which were connected to the walls with arches. The altar was formed by a semicircular or polygonal apse. In some churches the altar was separated into three parts and the external ones (called bema and diakonnik) were used for <b>safe-keeping</b> of the church plates, garments and books. In that case there was usually a triple apse. The design was complicated by a pre-apse space. The vaults were semicircular and built of bricks. Some churches had outhouse parts such as galleries (SS. Forty Martyrs Church and [...] "St Peter and Pavel" [...] in Tarnovo), chapels (Boyana Church), ossuaries and others. The Church [...] "St Virgin Maria of Petrich" [...] in the Asenova krepost has two stories and the lower one served as an ossuary.|$|E
