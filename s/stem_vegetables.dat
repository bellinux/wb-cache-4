40|$|Abstract: Galactolipids are a {{class of}} {{compounds}} widely found in the plant kingdom, including edible plants, and {{are an important part}} of the cell membranes. Galactolipids in plants consists mainly of monogalactosyldiacylglycerols and digalactosyldiacylglycerols containing one or two saturated and/or unsaturated fatty acids linked to the glycerol moiety. Several galactolipids have been shown to possess in vitro and/or in vivo anti-tumor promoting activity and anti-inflammatory activity. Recently, it has been demonstrated that the galactolipid, 1, 2 -di-O [...] linolenoyl- 3 -O [...] D-galactopyranosyl-sn-glycerol (1), may be important for the anti-inflammatory activity of dog rose (Rosa canina), a medicinal plant with documented effect on anti-inflammatory diseases such as arthritis. This galactolipid also occurs in relative high concentrations in certain legumes (e. g., common bean, pea), leaf vegetables (e. g., kale, leek, parsley, perilla and spinach), <b>stem</b> <b>vegetables</b> (e. g., asparagus, broccoli, brussels sprouts), and fruit vegetables (e. g., chilli, bell pepper, pumpkin). Furthermore, compound 1 has been isolated from spinach and several medicinal plants by bioassay-guided fractionation as a galactolipid with possible cancer preventive effects. In this review, the bioactivity of galactolipids is discussed and their potential role in human diet as important nutraceuticals. Moreover, recent patents on the bioactivity of specific galactolipids and inventions making use of this knowledge are presented and discussed...|$|E

The vegetable and fruit intake of 542 healthy male and female adults was analyzed. Then, by selecting 51 targets from the subjects, the relation of vegetable and fruit intake with serum calcium, osteocalcin and deoxypyridinoline (DPD) excretion in urine was examined. The total vegetable intake per day was 397. 7 g and 333. 5 g by men and women respectively for the age group of 20 - 29, 366. 9 g and 309. 2 g respectively for the age group of 30 - 49, 378. 4 g and 325. 9 g respectively for the age group of 50 - 64. Of vegetable varieties, leafy and <b>stem</b> <b>vegetables</b> displayed the highest intake. The order of major intake items of vegetables and fruits was found to be Chinese cabbage kimchi, onion, radish, cucumber, and welsh onion for the age group of 20 - 29, watermelon, Chinese cabbage kimchi, peach, potato, and onion for the age group of 30 - 49 and watermelon, Chinese cabbage kimchi, tomato, potato, and peach for the age group of 50 - 64.

40|$|Food of non-animal origin (FoNAO) is {{consumed}} {{in a variety}} of forms, and a major component of almost all meals. These food types have the potential to be associated with large outbreaks as seen in 2011 associated with VTEC O 104. A comparison of the incidence of human cases linked to consumption of FoNAO and of food of animal origin (FoAO) was carried out to provide an indication of the proportionality between these two groups of foods. It was concluded that outbreak data reported as part of EU Zoonoses Monitoring is currently the only option for EU-wide comparative estimates. Using this data from 2007 to 2011, FoNAO were associated with 10 % of the outbreaks, 26 % of the cases, 35 % of the hospitalisations and 46 % of the deaths. If the data from the 2011 VTEC O 104 outbreak is excluded, FoNAO was associated with 10 % of the outbreaks, 18 % of cases, but only 8 % of the hospitalisations and 5 % of the deaths. From 2008 to 2011 there was an increase in the numbers of reported outbreaks, cases, hospitalisations and deaths associated with food of non-animal origin. In order to identify and rank specific food/pathogen combinations most often linked to human cases originating from FoNAO in the EU, a model was developed using seven criteria: strength of associations between food and pathogen based on the foodborne outbreak data from EU Zoonoses Monitoring (2007 - 11), incidence of illness, burden of disease, dose-response relationship, consumption, prevalence of contamination and pathogen growth potential during shelf life. Shortcomings in the approach using outbreak data were discussed. The top ranking food/pathogen combination was Salmonellaspp. and leafy greens eaten raw followed by (in equal rank) Salmonellaspp. and bulb and <b>stem</b> <b>vegetables,</b> Salmonellaspp. and tomatoes, Salmonellaspp. and melons, and pathogenic Escherichia coli and fresh pods, legumes or grain...|$|E
40|$|In total 1216 {{vegetables}} {{obtained from}} Dutch stores during 2012 and 2013 were analysed {{to determine the}} prevalence of 3 rd-generation cephalosporin (3 GC) resistant bacteria on soil-grown fresh produce possibly consumed raw. Vegetables grown conventionally and organically, from Dutch as well as foreign origin were compared. Included were the following vegetable types; blanched celery (n= 192), bunched carrots (n= 190), butterhead lettuce (n= 137), chicory (n= 96), endive (n= 188), iceberg lettuce (n= 193) and radish (n= 120). Overall, 3 GC-resistant Enterobacteriaceae were detected on 5. 2 % of vegetables. Based on primary habitat and mechanism of 3 GC-resistance, these bacteria could be divided into four groups: ESBL-producing faecal species (Escherichia coli, Enterobacter spp.), AmpC-producing faecal species (Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter spp.), ESBL-producing environmental species (Pantoea spp., Rahnella aquatilis, Serratia fonticola), and AmpC-producing environmental species (Cedecca spp., Hafnia alvei, Pantoea spp., Serratia plymuthica), which were detected on 0. 8 %, 1. 2 %, 2. 6 % and 0. 4 % of the vegetables analysed, respectively. Contamination with faecal 3 GC-resistant bacteria was most frequently observed in root and bulb vegetables (average prevalence 4. 4 %), and less frequently in <b>stem</b> <b>vegetables</b> (prevalence 1. 6 %) and leafy greens (average prevalence 0. 6 %). In Dutch stores, only four of the included vegetable types (blanched celery, bunched carrots, endive, iceberg lettuce) were available in all four possible variants: Dutch/conventional, Dutch/organic, foreign/conventional, foreign/organic. With respect to these vegetable types, {{no statistically significant difference}} was observed in prevalence of 3 GC-resistant Enterobacteriaceae between country of origin or cultivation type (5. 2 %, 5. 7 %, 5. 7 % and 3. 3 %, respectively). Vegetables consumed raw may be a source of dissemination of 3 GC-resistant Enterobacteriaceae and their resistance genes to humans. The magnitude of the associated public health risk presumably depends on the types of bacteria that are ingested, i. e., faecal or environmental species, and may therefore be higher for root and bulb vegetables compared to leafy greens...|$|E

This study aimed {{to assess the}} concentration of As, Cu, Cd, Pb, Cr and Hg in common vegetables and cereals in urban open markets in Varanasi district, India 			Materials & Methods: Total 260 edible portions of vegetable samples of 13 species were collected in March to October, 2016 from predefined market sites. These samples classified into roots, <b>stems,</b> leafy <b>vegetables,</b> fruits, and legumes. These samples (unwashed, acetic acid washed and boiled) were assessed using atomic absorption spectrophotometer. The statistical evaluations were carried out using the IBM SPSS 21. 			Results: The results obtained reveal that unwashed vegetables and cereals as compared to washed and boiled samples contain higher trace metal concentration. The order of heavy metal concentration was observed in Cu>Pb>Cd>As in vegetable and cereals samples. Hg and Cr were not detected in any samples. The mean value of Cu, Cd and Pb in unwashed and washed vegetables and cereals were lower than PFA standard except As, whereas in boiled vegetables and cereals are lower than PFA standard but the mean value of Cd and Pb were many folds higher than the EU standard at all the market site samples. Leafy vegetables were found to contain the highest metals values especially Spinacia oleracea followed by roots vegetable like Brassica rapa, at all the studied sites.

During the 81–96 AD reign of Domitian, the tradition of serving a lettuce salad before a meal began. Post-Roman Europe continued the tradition of poaching lettuce, mainly with large romaine types, {{as well as the}} method of pouring a hot oil and vinegar mixture over the leaves. Today, the majority of lettuce is grown for its leaves, although one type is grown for its stem and one for its seeds, which are made into an oil.

Lettuce leaves can also be found in soups, sandwiches and wraps, while the stems are eaten both raw and cooked. The consumption of lettuce in China developed differently from in Western countries, due to health risks and cultural aversion to eating raw leaves.

The research methodology done by the expert of design and marketing empowerment through the motivation and alternatives to the craftsmen. Experimental design done by making many kinds of new and innovative bamboo craft design. The process of pilot testing done by joining the exibition and through the web design. The evaluation of pilot testing through the focus group discussion required to identify the strength and weaknesses of the products. The products innovation then registered to the HKI. The dissemination by the journal and book was to socialize the result of the research to the public, particularly to the institution which is respectable to the bamboo craftsmen at Jambukulon Ceper Klaten. Based on the result of the study, we can conclude that: 1. 	The design advisory started by apreciating bamboo craft product design by the craftsmen at Jambukulon to find out the strength and weaknesses to each product. The illustration of many kind of raw material made of bamboo, technique and design would inspire the imagination and creativity of the craftsmen. The craftsmen required to adopt many techniques, contour, or the way of handling bamboo material, thereby generate variety, creativity, and innovative products. 2. 	The marketing advisory was presented with the theory of marketing management, so the craftsmen would understand how to get a beneficial marketing. The marketing advisory was done by creating web design program, even though there were some limitation, which were almost all of the craftsmen can not operate the computer and low connectivity at Jambukulon. The reasercher suggession was training the son of the craftsmen which could operate the computer to join this program, we use “warung internet” to get better connection, and creating web design so they can keep them for the rest. Finally the training program followed by few volunteer. 3. 	Reasercher made many alternatives of design dealing with the craftsmen, and then we choose one to two products to make the prototype. We discuss the result of the products and they can give their opinion to the products, whether they don’t agree with. 4. 	The prototype process product at two location. The product made of the root of the bamboo, black apus bamboo produce at Mr Yana’s and Mr Daryono’s studio, and the product made of betung bamboo produce at Pendidikan Seni Rupa FKIP UNS laboratory. After finishing the production, the reasearcher check the quality of the product. 5.
