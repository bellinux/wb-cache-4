At times, he used his high <b>school</b> <b>experience</b> as a long jumper to leap over his opponents, landing on his head in the end zone to gain a touchdown in a game against the Buffalo Bills. His running gait was somewhat unusual, as his knees were minimally bent, and the motion was largely powered from the hip. This may have given his knees, a football player's most vulnerable joints, some protection, although he underwent arthroscopic surgery on both knees in 1983. He referred to this procedure as an 11,000-yard checkup.|$|E

The image of Kenny sitting on a toilet in [...] "Death" [...] became a popular South Park poster. [...] "Death" [...] included a consistency error in that Mr. Garrison's classroom had its own separate bathroom, which was never again seen in future South Park episodes. During one scene, Cartman moons Kyle while making fun of Kyle's mother. Comedy Central censors forced Parker and Stone to remove the image of Cartman's bare bottom, although such images would be allowed in future episodes. A man named Mr. McCormick was killed in [...] "Death" [...] after he was flung via slingshot into the Cartoon Central building. The character's name led many to mistakenly believe it was Kenny's father, Stuart McCormick, but Parker denied this and said the similar character names were just a coincidence.

His father's will provided him with a modest trust income, sufficient to allow him to pursue his literary ambitions for the time, and The Spice-Box of Earth was successful in helping to expand the audience for Cohen's poetry, helping him reach out to the poetry scene in Canada, outside the confines of McGill University. The book also helped Cohen gain critical recognition as an important new voice in Canadian poetry.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the impact of}} and relationship among several factors that shape the <b>school</b> <b>experiences</b> of Nepali Dalit students. In Nepal, caste {{is at the center}} of people’s conversations about themselves and their <b>experiences</b> at <b>school.</b> Regrettably, Dalit students’ position at the bottom of the caste hierarchy continues to frame their educational experience. While there is an emerging literature on this issue, only a handful of studies consider the <b>school</b> <b>experiences</b> of Dalits from their own perspectives, and the research tends to have a narrow geographical focus. As a result, the scholarly work fails to adequately emphasize and analyze the heterogeneity of Dalit students' <b>school</b> <b>experiences.</b> This thesis addresses these gaps in the existing research in order to articulate a more nuanced understanding of Dalit students' <b>school</b> <b>experiences.</b> During the summer of 2014, I conducted interviews with 61 Dalit children from various geographical regions (Sindhupalchok in Mountain region, Lalitpur in Hilly region, and Nawalparasi in Terai region) and with different levels of socio-economic status. Informed by current educational theory and recent studies focused on Nepal, my analysis of the interview transcripts identified three social context factors (Family Educational Background, Economic Status, and Neighborhood Effects) and five school-related factors (Caste of Teachers, Teachers’ Expectations, School Curriculum, Dalit Scholarship Programs, and Relationship with Peers) that all significantly affect Dalit students’ <b>school</b> <b>experiences.</b> Moreover, I discovered that these factors do not operate in isolation but that, rather, they interact in powerful ways to shape and influence the <b>school</b> <b>experiences</b> of Dalit students. While further studies on an even larger scale are necessary in order to better understand and enhance the quality of Dalit education, my research shows decisively that any policy designed to improve Dalit education must, in order to be effective, form part of a broader initiative to identify and address the ways in which multiple factors come together to shape their <b>school</b> <b>experiences.</b> honors thesis; awarded high honors; winner of Winfred Quinton Holton Prize for Innovative Work in the Field of Educatio...|$|R

While the exact effectiveness of the British attempts at infecting Native Americans is unknown, the outbreak of smallpox among the Indians has been documented.
