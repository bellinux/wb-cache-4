5|$|The plan of <b>Salisbury</b> Cathedral is {{that most}} often {{reproduced}} in architectural histories {{for the purpose of}} comparing English Gothic architecture with that of France, Italy and other countries. It has many features that, on paper at least, are typical. The plan of Worcester Cathedral, for example, closely resembles that of <b>Salisbury.</b> Both have two transepts, a large central tower, a large porch to {{the north side of the}} nave, a cloister to the south, off which opens a polygonal chapter house. Internally, there are also strong visual similarities in the simple lancet windows of the east end and the contrasting profusion of Purbeck marble shafts. But the histories of the two buildings are very different. <b>Salisbury</b> Cathedral took 160 years to complete, from its foundations in 1220 to the top of its massive spire in 1380. Worcester took 420 years from its Norman crypt of 1084 to its chapel in memory of Prince Arthur in 1504. The history of Worcester is much more representative of the history of most of England’s medieval cathedrals than is that of <b>Salisbury.</b>|$|E

5|$|While Edward was away, <b>Salisbury</b> was {{captured}} by the French at Lille in April 1340, and imprisoned in Paris.

Philip was, however, dissuaded by John of Bohemia, who argued that the earls could come in handy in an exchange, should any French noblemen be captured. Though released on parole in September, {{it was not until}} May 1342 that he reached a final settlement with the French. <b>Salisbury</b> was freed in a prisoner exchange, but only on the condition that he never fight in France again.|$|E

50|$|If it was Smith's {{intention}} to replace <b>Salisbury's</b> name, {{as has been}} suggested, it was partly successful, since although <b>Salisbury's</b> Hookera coronaria has priority over Smith's Brodiaea grandiflora, names as similar as Hookera and Hookeria {{are considered to be}} confusing and a formal proposal to conserve the names Brodiaea and Hookeria over the name Hookera was accepted. However, <b>Salisbury's</b> epithet coronaria still stands since Smith's Brodiaea grandiflora is now considered to have been an illegitimate name when published. In 1917, after the Kew Rule had vanished from botanical nomenclature, Willis Jepson formally published the combination Brodiaea coronaria, now accepted as the botanical name for this species.|$|R
