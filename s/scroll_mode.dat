50|$|Due to the {{restrictive}} screen {{resolution of}} the Game Boy Advance, the player is given the choice of two methods for viewing the playfield in Pac-Man: <b>scroll</b> <b>mode,</b> where the playfield automatically scrolls to follow Pac-Man, or full-screen, where the entire playfield is displayed in miniature form. Same goes to Ms. Pac-Man in Namco Museum for Game Boy Advance.|$|E
50|$|There are {{two main}} {{gameplay}} modes: Scroll and Spin. In <b>Scroll</b> <b>mode,</b> the player steps on four different directions on the game pad (right, up, down and left) as the arrows scroll towards four icons {{at the top of}} the screen. Spin mode adds four additional directions. Its songs are also longer than other dance games, often lasting around seven minutes.|$|E
50|$|Some of the game's {{vehicles}} {{can transform}} in certain situations. For example, the Arwing can transform into the Walker which was first {{seen in the}} unreleased Super NES video game Star Fox 2, which lets the player freely walk around on platforms. The Landmaster can transform into the Gravmaster, which can perform extended aerial maneuvers. A new vehicle introduced to the series is the Gyrowing, a drone-like helicopter which can lower a small robot that can enter small spaces and hack into computers. Players can also add laser upgrade and smart bombs to their ships. Special techniques, such as charge shot, barrel roll, Somersaults, U-Turns and rapid turn, can be performed. Two gameplay modes are featured in the game. The <b>Scroll</b> <b>Mode</b> puts the player in a predetermined path, while the All-Range Mode allows the player to move freely in a mission. If players lose all their ships in a mission, they must restart the entire mission in order to proceed.|$|E
5000|$|Unlike Pico, nano uses meta keys {{to toggle}} its behavior. For example, [...] toggles smooth <b>scrolling</b> <b>mode</b> on and off. Almost all {{features}} {{that can be}} selected from the command line can be dynamically toggled. On keyboards without the meta key it is often mapped to the escape key, , such {{that in order to}} simulate, say, [...] one has to press the [...] key, then release it, and then press the [...] key.|$|R
5000|$|The mobile Android app {{has seen}} several {{significant}} updates since its introduction, including different reading modes with color contrasts, support for text highlighting and note-taking, a zoomed-out view with easy page sliding {{in an effort}} to improve reading experiences for books not read cover-to-cover, a vertical <b>scrolling</b> <b>mode</b> for comic books, a [...] "Night Light" [...] feature that gradually filters blue light to reduce eye strain after sunset, and using machine learning imaging technologies to expand speech bubbles in comics.|$|R
50|$|There are few bosses in the game. The arcade {{original}} only {{features a}} single boss {{in the middle}} of the game that has three distinct forms. This boss is repeated as common enemy near the end of the last mission. The Mega Drive port has two of these forms as two separate bosses. At the end of each mission, the side-scrolling gameplay shifts to either a shooting gallery perspective where the player must take out the aliens that pop out of various locations, similar to the bonus stages of Shinobi and Shadow Dancer, both also by Sega, or a running section that is similar to the side <b>scrolling</b> <b>mode</b> but plays like a horizontal shooter instead with projectile weapons.|$|R
5000|$|The MCC-16 {{supported}} {{both the}} Univac standard terminal (from RCA) renamed to the Uniscope Video Display Terminal or VDT, {{as well as}} ordinary ASCII dumb terminals. Univac's Uniscope VDT provided sophisticated (for the time) editing capability including the ability to edit text on screen and make changes a line at a time or a page at a time, then transmit the text back to the computer. The VDT also supported direct cursor positioning and input protection through a cursor which indicated that only text after the cursor was to be recognized. It also supported special <b>scroll</b> <b>mode</b> in {{a subset of the}} screen, or [...] "window" [...] in which, instead of the entire screen scrolling upward when the last line is displayed, it was possible to make the scroll area only {{the bottom half of the}} screen. (The same feature for [...] "split screen scroll" [...] would become available about 20 years later in the Apple II microcomputer.) ...|$|E
25|$|Roll-up or {{scroll-up}} or paint-on or scrolling: Real-time words sent in paint-on or <b>scrolling</b> <b>mode</b> {{appear from}} left to right, up to one line at a time; when a line is filled in roll-up mode, the whole line scrolls up {{to make way for}} a new line, and the line on top is erased. The lines usually appear at the bottom of the screen, but can actually be placed on any of the 14 screen rows to avoid covering graphics or action. This method is used when captioning video in real-time such as for live events, where a sequential word-by-word captioning process is needed or a pre-made intermediary file isn't available. This method is signaled on EIA-608 by a two-byte caption command or in Teletext by replacing rows for a roll-up effect and duplicating rows for a paint-on effect. This allows for real-time caption line editing.|$|R
40|$|OASIS, the Open Analogue Signal Information System, is the LHC era {{system for}} the {{acquisition}} and display of analogue signals in the accelerator domain. OASIS {{is based on a}} three-tier architecture. The upper layer is an application written in Java. It is responsible for waveform display and user interaction. The application server, in the middle tier, uses the OC 4 J J 2 EE container and is based on the Enterprise Java Beans. This part takes care, among other things, of the signal connection and the management of the connection settings. The front-end tier is implemented within the FESA framework and controls oscilloscopes and analogue matrices in CompactPCI and VXI format. Today, most of the performance critical features such as the mountain range <b>mode</b> or the <b>scrolling</b> <b>mode</b> have been implemented. However, the problem of remote trigger has still to be addressed. The system was successfully put in production for the TT 40 /TI 8 tests with a small configuration. The next, and bigger, installation is the LEIR machine where OASIS has to be available twenty four hours a day for a longer period and has to handle more than 200 signals...|$|R
50|$|The Galaxy S6 series removes several {{features}} {{from its}} predecessors, {{such as the}} microSD slot, a removable battery, Air Gesture, Air View, Smart Pause, Smart Rotation, Smart <b>Scroll,</b> the one-handed <b>mode,</b> Sensitivity, and USB 3.0 support. In addition, the batteries in the Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 edge are smaller than the battery in the Galaxy S5.|$|R
50|$|When {{the fine}} {{scrolling}} limit is reached, continue scrolling by resetting the HSCROL value and performing a coarse horizontal scroll of the scrolling region. Note that ANTIC's 16 color clock range permits fine <b>scrolling</b> multiple Text <b>Mode</b> characters {{or more than}} one byte worth of Map mode pixels. Therefore, the update to the LMS addresses may add or subtract multiple bytes.|$|R
5000|$|Popular Mechanics {{refers to}} the large display of the watch which {{makes it easy to}} read {{multiple}} outputs without having to <b>scroll</b> using the <b>mode</b> button and adds that [...] "While this may be useful for climbers who have their hands full gripping cliff faces, it could be just as practical for strap-hanging subway riders who are jammed between fellow commuters".|$|R
5000|$|Vertical Fine Scrolling allows single {{scan line}} {{movement}} of the scrolling region for Text and Map modes which are greater than one scan line tall. Vertical Fine <b>Scrolling</b> for Map <b>modes</b> only one scan line tall is logically not practical. The effect of vertical [...] "fine" [...] scrolling for single scan line Map modes can be performed using the easier coarse scrolling method.|$|R
50|$|The game makes great use of many Amiga {{features}} such as scales of colors done with raster lines, halfbrite graphics mode for the between-level pictures, three layers of parallax <b>scrolling</b> using dual-playfield <b>mode,</b> in-game palette swapping and continuous flashing of the background palette to simulate additional colors. Featuring three floppies, the game ran on all Amiga computers. In common with other Amiga titles, the music was created with sampled sounds.|$|R
50|$|Most of {{the levels}} are side-scrolling, {{but there are}} some levels {{involving}} flight, either automatically <b>scrolling</b> or in <b>Mode</b> 7, where the player can grab crystals towards extra lives but will exit the level upon touching a spike and falling. Also, some levels expand on the usual platform structure by including waterways whose paths can be varied with switches, and there are areas with rotating towers. Two of the bosses also use extensive Mode 7, expanding and rotating around the screen or coming in the form of rotating walls.|$|R
50|$|Pocky & Rocky was {{licensed}} by Taito to Natsume, who developed and published {{the game for}} release in Japan in 1992 {{and the rest of}} the world in 1993, it is the sequel to the 1986 arcade game KiKi KaiKai (unofficially released in North America as Knight Boy). Pocky & Rocky was generally well received by critics, some calling the gameplay addictive. The two-player mode was considered by some reviewers to add a lot of value to the game. In addition, the controls were considered easy to pick up and play. On the other hand, some reviewers experienced slowdowns in frame rate. The graphics of the game, especially the backgrounds and enemies, received praise for being colorful and well-animated, many comparing it to The Legend of the Mystical Ninja in graphical style. The special effects and weather effects in the game were also well received by reviewers. However, some critics commented the lack of parallax <b>scrolling</b> and <b>Mode</b> 7 effects. The music and sound was positively received, and many critics thought it fit the theme and setting of the game well.|$|R
50|$|ANTIC's {{process of}} {{vertical}} fine scrolling works by simply directing ANTIC to skip {{a number of}} scan lines for the first mode line of the <b>scrolling</b> region. Subsequent <b>Mode</b> lines in the scrolling region are not affected. The last line of the region supplies the bottom border of the scrolling region displaying the number of scan lines that {{were removed from the}} first line. This number of scan lines is controlled with the VSCROL register. The value ranges from 0 to the ANTIC Mode line's scan line height - 1. The maximum value range covers fine scrolling 16 scan lines from 0 to 15.|$|R
40|$|In {{the past}} two decades, an {{appreciation}} of the extraordinary properties of nanotubular materials has led to the discovery and investigation of many different nanotubes. A wide variety of nanotubes can be synthesised using scalable hydrothermal techniques, but understanding of the synthesis mechanisms is often limited. This research is concerned with manipulating the synthesis conditions of metal oxide and silicate nanotubes in order to improve understanding of the underlying synthesis mechanism, and investigating the properties of the nanotubes as hydrogen storage materials. This thesis presents experimental results for the syntheses of aluminium silicate, nickel silicate and vanadium oxide multiwalled nanotubes under controlled hydrothermal conditions. A novel synthesis method at 220 ºC, pH 2 was developed for Al 2 Si 2 O 5 (OH) 4 nanotubes through substitution of a mole fraction of SiO 2 with GeO 2 in the precursor SiO 2 + Al(OH) 3 suspension. An ideal Ni/Si molar ratio of 1. 5 was demonstrated in the synthesis of Ni 3 Si 2 O 5 (OH) 4 nanotubes at 195 ºC. It was shown that increasing the concentration of NaOH widens the length distribution and increases the average length of the nanotubes. Variable temperature experiments with vanadium oxide nanostructures revealed a low temperature route for the synthesis of flexible elongated VOx nanosheets under reflux (90 ºC) in an ethylenediamine-water mixture. The hydrothermal experiments revealed important details about the nanotube formation mechanisms, including the <b>scrolling</b> <b>mode</b> of nanosheets into nanotubes, which occurs in a specific crystallographic direction relative to the nanosheet growth axis. Subsequent investigations into the room temperature stability of Al 2 Si 2 O 5 (OH) 4 nanotubes under aqueous acidic and alkaline conditions revealed significant dissolution within 10 days in 1 mol dm- 3 NaOH, H 2 SO 4 and HCl solutions, initiated at the inner surface. The effect of acid or alkali concentration on the initial dissolution rate was measured, and the dissolution mechanism discussed. Acid treatment was shown to be an effective method for increasing nanotube surface area. Investigations into the hydrogen adsorption properties of metal oxide nanotubes revealed weak adsorption of hydrogen at 77 – 298 K up to 150 bars (15 MPa) pressure. Temperature-corrected adsorption isotherms for adsorbing H 2 TinO 2 n+ 1 (titanate), Ge-Al 2 GeO 3 (OH) 4 and Ni 3 Si 2 O 5 (OH) 4 nanotubes were compared with M 3 [Fe(CN) 6] 2 Prussian-blue analogues, and dimensions of the adsorbed hydrogen layer were derived using the Langmuir-Freundlich model.

50|$|In this mode, {{the player}} {{is given a}} time limit and an endless sheet of paper to cut into boxes that may be {{scrolled}} {{down from the top}} of the screen as it is used up. Periodically, bombs will fall onto the playing field, and the player may form a box around the bomb to earn a bonus, but if the bomb is allowed to explode, it will burn away adjacent squares of paper. The player is penalized for stray squares left behind and/or any paper that falls off of the screen as it is <b>scrolled</b> downward. Factory <b>Mode</b> allows the player character to earn money, and upon reaching certain amounts the character will gain new items for its miniature garden on the top screen.|$|R
40|$|Three {{interaction}} techniques were evaluated for <b>scrolling</b> stack <b>mode</b> displays of volumetric data. Two used a scrollwheel mouse: one used only the wheel, while another used a “click and drag ” technique for fast scrolling, leaving the wheel for fine adjustments. The third technique used a Shuttle Xpress jog wheel. In a within-subjects design, nine radiologists searched stacked images for simulated hyperintense regions on brain, knee, and thigh MR studies. Dependent measures were speed, accuracy, navigation path, and user preference. The radiologists considered the task realistic. They had high inter-subject variability in completion times, far {{larger than the}} differences between techniques. Most radiologists (eight out of nine) preferred familiar mouse-based techniques. Most participants scanned the data in two passes, first locating anomalies, then scanning for omissions. Participants spent a mean 10. 4 s/trial exploring anomalies, with only mild variation between participants. Their rates of forward navigation searching for anomalies varied much more. Interaction technique significantly affected forward navigation rate (scroll wheel 5. 4 slices/s, click and drag 9. 4, and jog wheel 6. 9). It {{is not clear what}} constrained the slowest navigators. The fastest navigator used a unique strategy of moving quickly just beyond an anomaly, then backing up. Eight naïve students performed a similar protocol. Their times and variability were similar to the radiologists, but more (three out of eight) students preferred the jog wheel. It may be worthwhile to introduce techniques such as the jog wheel to radiologists during training, and several techniques might be provided on workstations, allowing individuals to choose their preferred method.

40|$|Conventional {{scrolling}} {{methods for}} small sized display in PDAs, mobile phones or smal pen computers {{are difficult to}} use when frequent switching of scrolling and editing operations are required, for example, browsing and operating large sized WWW pages. In this paper, we propose a new user-interface method to provide seamless switching between scrolling and other operations such as editing, based on “Paperweight Metaphor”. A sheet of paper that {{has been placed on}} a slippery table is difficult to draw on. Therefore, in order to write or draw something on the sheet of paper, a person must secure the paper with his/her palm to avoid the paper from moving. This will be a good metaphor to design switching operation of <b>scroll</b> and editing <b>modes.</b> We have made prototype systems by placing a touch sensor under each PDA and pen computer display where user’s palm will be hit. We also have developed application programs to browse maps, WWW pages and photographs, which switch scrolling and other operation mode by the sensor output, and have evaluated them...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} {{a study on}} image grid display with automatic vertical scrolling. While scroll operations are normally carried out manually by the user, {{in the context of}} RSVP (Rapid Serial Visual Presentation) techniques this work considers a presentation mode in which the image grid is automatically scrolled. Through experiments carried out with 50 testers, we have investigated user performance while looking for specific target subjects within large collections of images. Different numbers of columns and scrolling speeds have been considered. The search task implied both clicking on the identified target pictures and simply vocally stating their visual recognition. To this purpose, and to identify possible specific gaze behaviours, eye tracking technology has been exploited. The obtained results show that number of columns and scroll speed do affect search performance. Moreover, the userâs gaze tends to focus on different screen areas depending on the values of these two parameters. Although {{it is not possible to}} definitely find an optimal columnsâspeed combination that is valid in all cases, the particular context of use can suggest feasible solutions according to oneâs needs. To the best of our knowledge, image grid display with automatic scrolling has never been studied to date.
