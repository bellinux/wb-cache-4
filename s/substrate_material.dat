25|$|Like ink jet {{material}} depositioning, inkjet etching (IJE) deposits precise {{amounts of}} solvent onto a substrate designed to selectively dissolve the <b>substrate</b> <b>material</b> and induce a structure or pattern. Inkjet etching of polymer layers in OLED's {{can be used}} to increase the overall out-coupling efficiency. In OLEDs, light produced from the emissive layers of the OLED is partially transmitted out of the device and partially trapped inside the device by total internal reflection (TIR). This trapped light is wave-guided along the interior of the device until it reaches an edge where it is dissipated by either absorption or emission. Inkjet etching {{can be used to}} selectively alter the polymeric layers of OLED structures to decrease overall TIR and increase out-coupling efficiency of the OLED. Compared to a non-etched polymer layer, the structured polymer layer in the OLED structure from the IJE process helps to decrease the TIR of the OLED device. IJE solvents are commonly organic instead of water based due to their non-acidic nature and ability to effectively dissolve materials at temperatures under the boiling point of water.|$|E

40|$|Shelf {{cultivation}} of oyster mushrooms {{is a unique}} Korean production method. This method was adapted by Korean scientists in the early 1980 ’s from button mushroom (Agaricus bisporous) growing on shelves. Button mushroom cultivation can be summarized as follows: Phase I (outdoor fermentation), Phase II (pasteurization and conditioning), Phase III (spawning and incubation), fruiting, harvesting and emptying. The unique characteristics of shelf {{cultivation of}} oyster mushroom in Korea include {{the fact that the}} substrate is fermented in three steps (pre-fermentation, pasteurization, and post-fermentation) rather than on the shelf itself. Unlike the pasteurization process that lasts for 2 - 6 hours in most countries, shelf cultivation requires the <b>substrate</b> <b>materials</b> to be pre-fermented outdoors for 2 - 3 days, then pasteurized at 60 - 65 ℃ for 8 - 10 hours, and finally post-fermented at 45 - 55 ℃ for 3 - 4 days. This process requires considerable time and generates significant expenses. In Korea, the main methods of oyster mushroom growing are shelf cultivation, bag cultivation and bottle cultivation. Korean oyster mushroom growers ferment the <b>substrate</b> <b>materials</b> in shelf cultivation while they sterilize <b>substrate</b> <b>materials</b> in the cases of bag and bottle cultivation. Button mushroom (A. bisporus) is a secondary decomposer requiring the previous degradation of substrates by bacteria or other fungi {{in order to be able}} to absorb nutrients from the substrate.
