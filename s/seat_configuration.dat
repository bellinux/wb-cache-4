5|$|The {{prototype}} and series trains have various differences. The {{number of}} seats was increased from 264 to 309 by changing the <b>seat</b> <b>configuration</b> in second class from 2+1 to 2+2. The information screens {{on the outside of}} the carriages were moved from the center of the carriages to next to the doors. There are also differences with the light switch logic, which often leads to the trains running with both front and tail lights on at the same end. The prototypes differed also originally by their restaurant car and Extra class features. They were modified in the mid-2000s to be similar to the series trains.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examined}} {{the performance of a}} booster seat in different <b>seating</b> <b>configurations</b> in side-impact hyGe sled tests (crash severity 30 km/h) with two attachment systems: a standard seatbelt and ISOfix (rigid). The objectives of the study were twofold: (i) to identify the relative benefits of ISOfix attachment compared with seatbelt attachment of a near-side booster seat in a 3 -abreast <b>seating</b> <b>configuration</b> with adjacent occupants in child restraints (CRS); and (ii) {{to examine the effects of}} 3 -abreast <b>seating</b> <b>configurations</b> compared with no adjacent passengers on booster seat crash protection characteristics. Overall, the findings confirmed the superior performance of the rigid anchorages in reducing lateral motion of the booster as well as the two adjacent CRS. However, the expected benefits of the rigid attachment in reducing head accelerations were not uniformly observed across the three occupants/seating positions and also appeared to be influenced by <b>seating</b> <b>configuration</b> (3 -abreast versus no adjacent occupant). Further research is warranted to explore the applicability of the findings for different CRS types and <b>seating</b> <b>configurations...</b>|$|R

2500|$|The new [...] "Space-Flex" [...] {{optional}} cabin configuration increases space-efficiency {{by a new}} rear galley configuration and a [...] "Smart-Lav" [...] modular lavatory design [...] allowing an in-flight {{change of}} two lavatories into one accessible toilet. With larger, [...] "Cabin-Flex" [...] relocated exit doors, it allows up to 20 more passengers for the A321neo without [...] "putting more sardines in the can", and up to 9 more passengers for the A320neo. For the A321neo, the additional passenger count is enabled through a rearrangement of the exits. While initial A321neo examples share the same exit door configuration as the A321ceo (four exit doors on each side), future examples will permanently delete doors R2 and L2 (forward of the wings) to permit a maximum configuration of 240 seats with two overwing exits replacing doors R2 and L2, and a relocation of doors R3 and L3 (aft of the wings) four frames back. Less dense configurations will also permit the deactivation of either doors R3 and L3 (replaced with a plug; maximum 195 <b>seat</b> <b>configuration)</b> or both doors R3 and L3 and one overwing exit (replaced with plugs; maximum 165 <b>seat</b> <b>configuration).</b> The A321LR, described below, will only be available in a [...] "cabin flex" [...] configuration.|$|E

2500|$|The Gremlin X {{version was}} added in 1976 as a {{separate}} model rather than an optional package. The X models included VAM's larger [...] I6, a 6000 RPM tachometer, sports steering wheel, 7.00X14 radial tires, Hurst linkage with T-shaped shifter for the manual transmissions, courtesy lights on parcel shelf, heater, power steering, tinted windshield, bright molding package (drip rails, wheel arches, rocker panels), wheel trim rings, and an in-house two-color rally stripe that was unique to the Mexican market. The 1976 VAM Gremlin X also came with an interior featuring the [...] "Navajo" [...] pattern cloth upholstery that was optional on AMC's Pacer DL models built for the Canadian and U.S. markets. The base VAM Gremlin now also included luxurious seating with a center armrest that was never available in the U.S. models. Due to the debut of the Gremlin X and its sportier focus, the base Gremlin switched back to the standard column-mounted shifters for either transmission, but keeping the individual <b>seat</b> <b>configuration.</b> Both versions included revised gauges with a 160km/h speedometer, new side panel designs, longer folding sun visors, and a styled round dome light lens.

A lighted vanity mirror was now standard equipment for the three top end models. All three base models included the heater as standard equipment regardless of transmission type, as well as high back front seats with adjustable headrests.
