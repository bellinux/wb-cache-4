40|$|Abstract Background The {{cultivated}} potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) is {{an important}} food crop, but highly susceptible to many pathogens. The major threat to potato production is the Irish famine pathogen Phytophthora infestans, which causes the devastating late blight disease. Potato breeding makes use of germplasm from wild relatives (wild germplasm) to introduce resistances into cultivated potato. The Solanum section Petota comprises tuber-bearing species that are potential donors of new disease resistance genes. The {{aim of this study}} was to explore Solanum section Petota for resistance genes and generate a widely accessible resource that is useful for studying and implementing disease resistance in potato. Description The <b>Sol</b> <b>R</b> gene database contains data on resistance to P. infestans and presence of R genes and R gene homologues in Solanum section Petota. We have explored Solanum section Petota for resistance to late blight in high throughput disease tests under various laboratory conditions and in field trials. From resistant wild germplasm, segregating populations were generated and assessed for the presence of resistance genes. All these data have been entered into the <b>Sol</b> <b>R</b> gene database. To facilitate genetic and resistance gene evolution studies, phylogenetic data of the entire <b>Sol</b> <b>R</b> gene collection are included, as well as a tool for generating phylogenetic trees of selected groups of germplasm. Data from resistance gene allele-mining studies are incorporated, which enables detection of R gene homologs in related germplasm. Using these resources, various resistance genes have been detected and some of these have been cloned, whereas others are in the cloning pipeline. All this information is stored in the online <b>Sol</b> <b>R</b> gene database, which allows users to query resistance data, sequences, passport data of the accessions, and phylogenic classifications. Conclusion Solanum section Petota forms the basis of the <b>Sol</b> <b>R</b> gene database, which contains a collection of resistance data of an unprecedented size and precision. Complemented with R gene sequence data and phylogenetic tools, <b>Sol</b> <b>R</b> gene can be considered the primary resource for information on R genes from potato and wild tuber-bearing relatives. </p...|$|E

40|$|A {{serious problem}} {{experienced}} by astronauts during long-duration space flight is muscle atrophy. In {{order to develop}} countermeasures for this problem, a simple method for monitoring in vivo function of specific muscles is needed. Previous studies document that both intramuscular pressure (IMP) and electromyography (EMG) provide quantitative indices of muscle contraction force during isometric exercise. However, at present there are no data available concerning the usefulness of IMP versus EMG during dynamic exercise. Methods: IMP (Myopress catheter) and surface EMG activity were measured continuously and simultaneously in the tibalis anterior (TA) and soleus (SOL) muscles of 9 normal male volunteers (28 - 54 years). These parameters were recorded during both concentric and eccentric exercises which consisted of plantarflexon and dorsiflexon of the ankle joint. A Lido Active Isokinetic Dynamometer concurrently recorded ankle joint torque and position. Results: Intramuscular pressure correlated linearly with contraction force for both <b>SOL</b> (<b>r</b> exp 2 = 0. 037) and TA (R exp 2 = 0. 716 and r exp 2 = 0. 802, respectively). During eccentric exercises, SOL and TA IMP also correlated linearly with contraction force (r(exp 2) = 0. 883 and r(exp 2) = 0. 904 respectively), but SOL and TA EMG correlated poorly with force (r(exp 2) = 0. 489 and r(exp 2) = 0. 702 respectively). Conclusion: IMP measurement provides a better index of muscle contraction force than EMG during concentric and eccentric exercise. IMP reflects intrinsic mechanical properties of individual muscles, such as length tension relationships. Although invasive, IMP provides a more powerful tool and EMG for developing exercise hardware and protocols for astronauts exposed to long-duration space flight...|$|E

We retrospectively analyzed the presence, location, size and contractile properties of accessory LAAs using multiphasic cardiac 64 -slice CT in 102 consecutive patients (63 males, 39 females, mean age 57). Multiplanar reformats {{were used to}} create image planes in axial oblique, sagittal oblique and coronal oblique planes. For all appendages with an orifice diameter >or= 10 mm, axial and sagittal diameters and appendage volumes were recorded in atrial diastole and systole. Regression analysis was performed to assess which imaging appearances best predicted accessory appendage contractility. Twenty-three (23 %) patients demonstrated an accessory LAA, all identified along the anterior LA wall. Dimensions for axial oblique (AOD) and sagittal oblique (SOD) diameters and sagittal oblique length (SOL) were 6. 3 - 19, 3. 4 - 20 and 5 - 21 mm, respectively. All appendages (>or= 10 mm) demonstrated significant contraction during atrial systole (greatest diameter reduction was AOD [3. 8 mm, 27 %]). Significant correlations were noted between AOD-contraction and AOD (R = 0. 57, P < 0. 05) and SOD-contraction and AOD, SOD and <b>SOL</b> (<b>R</b> = 0. 6, P < 0. 05). Mean diverticulum volume in atrial diastole was 468. 4 +/- 493 mm(3) and in systole was 171. 2 +/- 122 mm(3), indicating a mean change in volume of 297. 2 +/- 390 mm(3), P < 0. 0001. Stepwise multiple regression analysis revealed SOL to be the strongest independent predictor of appendage contractility (R(2) = 0. 86, P < 0. 0001) followed by SOD (R(2) = 0. 91, P < 0. 0001). Accessory LAAs show significant contractile properties on cardiac CT.

Also, in vitro nitrogen (N) digestion study was conducted with these samples using the two-step enzymatic method. The coefficient of apparent ileal digestibility (CAID) of the SBM, independent of the origin, varied from 0. 820 to 0. 880 for CP, 0. 850 to 0. 905 for lysine (Lys), 0. 859 to 0. 907 for methionine (Met) and 0. 664 to 0. 750 for cysteine (Cys). The corresponding CSID values varied from 0. 850 to 0. 966 for CP, 0. 891 to 0. 940 for Lys, 0. 931 to 0. 970 for Met and 0. 786 to 0. 855 for Cys. The CSID of CP and Lys of the SBM were positively correlated with CP (r = 0. 514; P menor que 0. 05 and r = 0. 370; P = 0. 09, respectively), KOH solubility (KOH <b>sol.)</b> (<b>r</b> = 0. 696; P menor que 0. 001 and r = 0. 619; P menor que 0. 01, respectively), trypsin inhibitor activity (TIA) (r = 0. 541; P menor que 0. 01 and r = 0. 416; P = 0. 05, respectively) and reactive Lys (r = 0. 563; P menor que 0. 01 and r = 0. 486; P menor que 0. 05) values, but no relation was observed with neutral detergent fiber and oligosaccharide content. No relation between the CSID of CP determined in vivo and N digestibility determined in vitro was found. The CSID of most key AA were higher for the USA and the BRA meals than for the ARG meals.

40|$|Abstract [...] The {{swelling}} of n-butylammonium vermiculite in water was investigated {{as a function}} of the <b>sol</b> concentration (<b>r),</b> the salt concentration (c) and the temperature (T). The interlayer spacing in the gel phase was investigated {{as a function of}} r and c by neutron diffraction and by laboratory experiments which measured how many times its own volume a crystal would absorb. The salt concentration was found to be the stronger variable with the interlayer spacing decreasing proportional to c ~ which is consistent with previous results and with the Coulombic attraction theory. The sol concentration was found to affect he swelling for two reasons, the salt fractionation effect and the trapped salt effect. Both of these cause the salt concentration i the supernatant fluid to be greater than that originally added to the crystals and so reduce the swelling. A new method was used for extracting the solution from inside the gels by collapsing the gels by the addition of potassium hydrogen carbonate. The Volhardt itration was carried out on the extracted and supernatant solutions from about 250 gels. The ratio of the external to the internal chloride concentration was found to be approximately constant across the range of salt concentrations.

In the infusion protocol, 12 healthy male subjects underwent a 6 -h hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic glucose clamp with concomitant infusion of Intralipid plus heparin.

In parallel, the glucose infusion rate (GIR) decreased progressively, reaching a minimum of 60. 4 5. 4 % of baseline after 6 h.

In the diet protocol, 12 male subjects ingested both a high-fat and low-fat diet for 3 days each. Before and after completion of each diet, IMCL levels and insulin sensitivity were assessed. After the high-fat diet, IMCL levels increased significantly in TA muscle (to 148. 0 16. 9 % of baseline; P 0. 005), but not in SOL muscle (to 114. 4 8. 2 % of baseline; NS).

It is a well-known fact that water, when it freezes, expands, usually with destructive consequences for the wa-terworks, that is to say, if we have forgotten to empty them. The freezing of water is a typical example of a phase transition. When water turns into ice, the so-called chemical potential of the water molecules changes, causing fewer molecules to occupy the same amount of space. Electrons in a metal usually form some kind of liquid. Unlike water molecules, each electron carries a small amount of charge and, due to the spin, also a small amount of magnetic moment. The charge and the spin allow the electrons to order in a large diversity of states of matter, such as ferromagnets, super-conductors, antiferromagnets, etc. Electrons can even crystallize, thus prohibiting the conduction o...|$|R
40|$|Whenever a soil of {{suitable}} {{texture and}} structure and with sufficient water content freezes slowly, the equilibrium between {{the amount of}} water in the film and the boundary- surface forces are disturbed in the film situated between the ice and the soil substance. The disturbance results in the loss of liquid water by the film to the ice and this increases the size of the ice lens. The disturbance in the film is immediately compensated, because the boundary- surface forces keep the amount of water in the film constant. The compensation is brought about by the movement of water from the unfrozen soil to the film. Because the liquid film, as such, retains a constant thickness the part which becomes ice must be displaced. Thus ice lens formation and growth, water displacement and ground heaving come about as different aspects of a single event. The mechanical work performed during this event is done substantially by the boundary-surface forces of the two boundary surfaces, that between the ice and the water film and that between the water film and the soil particles.

40|$|The {{source of}} Galactic cosmic rays (with {{energies}} up to 1015 eV) remains unclear, {{although it is}} widely believed that they originate in the shock waves of expanding supernova remnants. At present the best way to investigate their acceleration and propagation is by observing the γ-rays produced when cosmic rays interact with interstellar gas. Here we report observations of an extended region of very-high-energy (> 1011 eV) γ-ray emission correlated spatially with a complex of giant molecular clouds in the central 200 parsecs of the Milky Way. The hardness of the γ-ray spectrum and the conditions in those molecular clouds indicate that the cosmic rays giving rise to the γ-rays are likely to be protons and nuclei rather than electrons. The energy associated with the cosmic rays could have come from a single supernova explosion around 104 years ago. F. Aharonian, A. G. Akhperjanian, A. R. Bazer-Bachi, M. Beilicke, W. Benbow, D.

40|$|Bacterial wilt, {{caused by}} the soilborne betaproteobacterium Ralstonia solanacearum, is a major disease of solanaceous crops, {{throughout}} tropical and subtropical areas, and emerging in temperate regions. If genetic resistance is still considered as the most promising control measure, breeding for resistance to Ralstonia solanacearum (Rsol}, has been hindered for decades by the scarcity of high level resistance sources, strong genotype x environment interactions, and the huge genomic and phenotypic plasticity of the pathogen. Ralstonia solanacearum is a species complex composed of four phylotypes related to geographical origins (1 : Africa-Asia, Il: American, III: Africa, IV: Indonesia). Solanaceae-pathogenic strains belong to ail four phylotypes, but most epidemiologically active strains belong to phylotype l, liA, IIB, and III, phylotype 1 being the most widespread lineage. Extensive screenings of resistant accessions of tomate, eggplant and pepper towards a worldwide <b>R.</b> <b>sol</b> core-collection, lead to formalize grain Solanaceae-Rsol interactions into six main virulence profiles, and allowed to identify highly resistant accessions, mainly in eggplant and pepper. Among the rn, the eggplant MM 960 was demonstrated to carry a phylotype I-resistance major dominant gene (Ersl) and two partial resistance QTLs with strain-specific expression. We identified patterns of strain -specificity, but {{found no evidence of}} phvlotvpe-specificltv. 'phvlotvpe 1 containing four of the six pathopprofiles. Searching for durable resistance implies both the identification of bacterial genes responsible for avirulence and virulence, and assessment of the pathogen evolutionary potential. Considering "immune" accessions (five eggplants, two peppers, one tomato) giving true incompatible interactions (no wilt and no colonization), we then searched for genetic factors associated with bacterial virulence and avirulence using comparative genomics hybridization (CGH) data. We thus identified 61 type III effectors fairly to highly associated to avirulence to eggplants Dingras, SM 6, Ceylan, Surya, and MM 960, peppers CA 8 and Perennial, and tomate HW 7996. Interestingly, some of these effectors were elsewhere shown to contribute to bacterial fitness. Focusing on the accessions MM 960 and Dingras, less than 10 genes were highly associated with avirulence, among which popP 2, avirulence gene interacting with the RRS 1 -Rresistance gene in Arabidopsis thaliana. We inferred evolutionary dynamics of the R. solanacearum species complex (RSSC) at a global scale, performing multi-Iocus sequence analysis (MLSA) and gene genealogies on a worldwide collection. Although recombination was found ubiquitous within the RSSC, we observed phylotype-specific recombination rates and demographic histories. Phylotype 1 (and, to a lesser extent, phylotype III) is highly recombinogenic, and carries molecular signatures of a recent and rapid demographic expansion. Phylotype Il is actually composed of two evolutionary lineages, one (liA) being moderately recombinogenic and expanding, and the other (IIB) being clonai and poorly expanding. Taken together, these findings strongly suggest that phylotype 1 is the most prone to adapt rapidly to new hosts and varieties, thank to its recombination and mutation rates, capacity to disseminate, and large virulence range. To decipher evolutionary dynamics leading to adaptation at the local, field scale, an experimental evolution trial is in course to monitor the impact of Ersl-carrying eggplant MM 960 successive craps on the population structure and putative avirulence genes evolution...|$|R
