500|$|Due to its {{relatively}} long half-life of about 80million years, {{it was suggested}} that plutonium-244 occurs naturally as a primordial nuclide, but early reports of its detection could not be confirmed. However, its long half-life ensured its circulation across the solar system before its extinction, and indeed, evidence of the spontaneous fission of extinct 244Pu has been found in meteorites. The former presence of 244Pu in the early Solar System has been confirmed, since it manifests itself today as an excess of its daughters, either 232Th (from the alpha decay pathway) or xenon isotopes (from its spontaneous fission). The latter are generally more useful, because the chemistries of thorium and plutonium are rather similar (both are predominantly tetravalent) and hence an excess of thorium would not be strong evidence that some of it was formed as a plutonium daughter. 244Pu has the longest half-life of all transuranic nuclides and is produced only in the r-process in supernovae and colliding neutron stars; when nuclei are ejected from these events at high speed to reach Earth, 244Pu alone among transuranic nuclides has a long enough half-life to survive the journey, and hence tiny traces of live interstellar 244Pu have been found in the deep sea floor.

Nevertheless, {{by means of a}} sufficient criterion for <b>secular</b> instability, <b>equilibrium</b> sequences {{can be used as a}} computationally inexpensive way to estimate the onset of dynamical instability, which, in general, is close to the secular one. This method works well for uniform rotation and relies on the location of turning points: stellar models that are stationary points in a sequence of equilibrium solutions with constant rest mass or angular momentum. Here, we investigate differentially rotating models (using a large number of equations of state and different rotation laws) and find that several universal relations between properly scaled gravitational mass, rest mass and angular momentum of the turning-point models that are valid for uniform rotation, are insensitive to the degree of differential rotation, to high accuracy.

40|$|Retardation of {{radionuclides}} by sorption on minerals in {{the rocks}} along downgradient groundwater flow paths is a positive attribute of the natural barrier at Yucca Mountain, Nevada, {{the site of a}} proposed high-level nuclear waste repository. Alteration of volcanic glass in nonwelded tuffs beneath the proposed repository horizon produced thick, widespread zones of zeolite- and clay-rich rocks with high sorptive capacities. The high sorptive capacity of these rocks is enhanced by the large surface area of tabular to fibrous mineral forms, which is about 10 times larger in zeolitic tuffs than in devitrified tuffs and about 30 times larger than in vitric tuffs. The alteration of glass to zeolites, however, was accompanied by expansion that reduced the matrix porosity and permeability. Because water would then flow mainly through fractures, the overall effectiveness of radionuclide retardation in the zeolitized matrix actually may be decreased relative to unaltered vitric tuff. Isotope ratios in the decay chain of {sup 238 }U are sensitive indicators of long-term water-rock interaction. In systems older than about 1 m. y. that remain closed to mass transfer, decay products of {sup 238 }U are in <b>secular</b> radioactive <b>equilibrium</b> where {sup 234 }U/{sup 238 }U activity ratios (AR) are unity. However, water-rock interaction along flow paths may result in radioactive disequilibrium in both the water and the rock, the degree of which depends on water flux, rock dissolution rates, {alpha}-recoil processes, adsorption and desorption, and the precipitation of secondary minerals. The effects of long-term water-rock interaction that may cause radionuclide retardation were measured in samples of Miocene-age subrepository zeolitized tuffs of the Calico Hills Formation (Tac) and the Prow Pass Tuff (Tcp) from borehole USW SD- 9 near {{the northern part of the}} proposed repository area (sampled depth interval from 451. 1 to 633. 7 m; Engstrom and Rautman, 1996).

U concentrations and isotopic compositions also were measured in samples of pore water obtained by ultracentrifugation or by leaching rock samples with deionized H{sub 2 }O.

We include both the gravitational perturbations of the secondary star and a non-linear gas drag stemming from an eccentric gas disk with a finite precession rate. We consider several precession rates and eccentricities for the gas, and compare the results with a static disk in circular orbit. The disk precession introduces three main differences {{with respect to the}} classical static case: (i) The <b>equilibrium</b> <b>secular</b> solutions generated by the gas drag are no longer fixed points in the averaged system, but limit cycles with frequency equal to the precession rate of the gas. The amplitude of the cycle is inversely dependent on the body size, reaching negligible values for ∼ 50 km size planetesimals. (ii) The maximum final eccentricity attainable by small bodies is restricted to the interval between the gas eccentricity and the forced eccentricity, and apsidal alignment is no longer guaranteed for planetesimals strongly coupled with the gas. (iii) The characteristic timescales of orbital decay and secular evolution decrease significantly with increasing precession rates, with values up to two orders of magnitude smaller than for static disks. Finally, we apply this analysis to the γ-Cephei system and estimate impact velocities for different size bodies and values of the gas eccentricity. For high disk eccentricities, we find that the disk precession decreases the velocity dispersion between different size planetesimals, thus contributing to accretional collisions in the outer parts of the disk. The opposite occurs for almost circular gas disks, where precession generates an increase in the relative velocities. Comment: 11 pages, 9 figures. Accepted in MNRA...|$|R

40|$|El Chichón is {{the only}} active volcano within the Chiapanecan Volcanic Arc, Southern Mexico, which is located between the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt and the Central America Volcanic Arc. Remote sensing, fieldwork, geochronology, and {{petrology}} {{studies have shown that}} at least 11 eruptions have occurred in El Chichón within the last 8000 years, forming a complex of lava domes with a central crater and surrounding pyroclastic deposits. This paper contributes to a new understanding of El Chichón’s eruptive history and magmatic evolution through dating crystallization ages of zircon, which originate within the intrusive complex underneath the volcano. Zircon dating focused on the most recent eruption of 1982 and the antecedent AD 1450 eruption. U-Th disequilibrium zircon ages range from 9. 3 ± 2. 7 ka to 734 +∞/- 511 ka in composite pumice samples from a pyroclastic flow and lava from an intracrater dome (errors 1 σ; ∞ indicating <b>secular</b> <b>equilibrium).</b> Overlapping U-Th zircon ages between 5. 8 + 4. 7 /- 4. 5 ka and <b>secular</b> <b>equilibrium</b> were obtained for a composite pumice sample from the AD 1450 eruption. Because many older ages overlap within uncertainty with <b>secular</b> <b>equilibrium</b> for 230 Th/ 238 U, reconnaissance U-Pb dating was performed of the same crystals. The U-Pb ages range between ca. 290 Ma and 1. 2 Ga and indicate xenocrystic origins for these crystal domains. This is the first evidence for zircon recycling from crustal rocks, and the generation of young zircon crystals and overgrowths in a long-lived magma system underneath El Chichón. This new application of zircon dating for El Chichón determines ages of zircon crystallization in a subterranean magma reservoir, which significantly predates what is recorded in eruptive stratigraphy. ...|$|E
