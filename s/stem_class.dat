50|$|There are six stem classes {{defined by}} unique sets of inflectional affixes {{with which they}} may occur. The unique set for each <b>stem</b> <b>class</b> may be {{increased}} by up to four affixes. Although the total set representing each <b>stem</b> <b>class</b> is unique, certain subsets of affixes are shared by multiple stem classes. Kaufman describes six stem classes, followed by his abbreviations: nouns (n), adjectives (aj), transitive verbs (tv), intransitive verbs (iv), affect verbs (av), and inflectible particles (ip). A seventh class, particles, exists but is never inflected; they are radical or derived stems that function as words in syntactic constructions.|$|E

40|$|Females {{have been}} {{discouraged}} from taking science, technology, engineering, and math (<b>STEM)</b> <b>classes</b> {{during high school}} and college, resulting in limited access to high-paying STEM careers. Therefore, these females could miss opportunities for these high-paying careers. The rationale {{of this research was}} to quantify the relationship between the number of <b>STEM</b> <b>classes</b> the sampled females took, the number of female role models they had during high school and college, their career choices, and salaries. The theoretical construct was based on Erikson 2 ̆ 7 s social developmental theory, which postulates a relationship between earlier life events and later life events, and Acker 2 ̆ 7 s masculinity theory, which postulates that females in traditionally male fields may be uneasy performing functions opposite to what they naturally perform. Key questions examined the relationships between <b>STEM</b> <b>classes,</b> role models, career choices, and salaries. The sample was a stratified random sample (n = 48) of female alumnae of 4 universities, born after 1980. Data were collected from a designed online instrument, validated by a pilot. The data were analyzed with a multiple regression and an analysis of variance. The findings revealed a significant relationship between the number of <b>STEM</b> <b>classes,</b> career choices and salary. However, there was no significance found between the numbers of role models, career choices and salary The implication for social change is that by making scholars in the fields of education and management aware about the relationship between the number of <b>STEM</b> <b>classes</b> taken, career choices, and salaries, females can be more encouraged to become interested in STEM courses earlier in life, making it more likely they will choose STEM careers This can be accomplished through scholarly journals, which hopefully will improve perceptions of the STEM abilities of females...|$|R

50|$|Forsyth Central High School {{offers an}} {{extensive}} assortment of Advanced Placement (AP) courses, dual enrollment options, an honors mentorship program, {{and a state}} certified STEM program. Forsyth Central High was certified during the 2014-2015 school year {{and is the only}} school in Forsyth County to offer a legitimate STEM program. The STEM program is currently working towards national certification. The program requires students to fulfill several strict requirements each year. They must maintain a minimum of a 3.5 overall GPA, and a 3.5 GPA in all <b>STEM</b> <b>classes.</b> <b>STEM</b> <b>classes</b> are separate and specialized relative to other AP or honor level courses. All STEM students must also complete a research project by their senior year in order to graduate. An acceptable research project is conducted exactly as a professional research project, complete with a grant proposal and full documentation of all results and procedures. Another requirement of earning a STEM diploma is competing in an authorized co-curricular activity or competition each semester.|$|R
50|$|One {{main feature}} of weak nouns {{is that they}} do not {{distinguish}} the non-nominative singular cases from each other. This effectively forms a nominative-oblique case dynamic confined to the weak singulars. Historically, the Proto-Germanic weak nouns were characterized by a nasal suffix applied as a case marker. These were mostly absorbed by their preceding vowels by the time Old Norse developed, with the main exceptions being those suffixes in the weak feminine and neuter declensions' genitive plurals.:1 As a result, weak nouns are referred to as the n stems, a consonant <b>stem</b> <b>class.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Weak {{adjectival}} endings {{are taken}} from the corresponding endings of masculine, feminine and neuter n-stems, e.g. masculine guma [...] "man", feminine tuggō [...] "tongue", neuter haírtō [...] "heart". All adjectives have the same endings, regardless of the underlying <b>stem</b> <b>class</b> of the adjective. The {{only difference is that}} ja-stems, i-stems and u-stems have a -j- {{at the end of the}} stem, e.g. masculine singular nominative weak niuja [...] "new", wilþja [...] "wild", hráinja [...] "clean", hardja [...] "hard", corresponding to the strong forms niujis (short ja-stem), wilþeis (long ja-stem), hráins (i-stem), hardus (u-stem).|$|E

50|$|The verbs {{classified}} as Class I in this table {{end in a}} or i {{in the present and}} subjunctive, but that vowel is lost in the past (which ends in -ki in this class) and in the perfect (all perfects are in -tuk). Class II verbs, which end in a, i or u, retain this in all forms, and form their past in -k. Class III differs from Class I only in that there is no past suffix at all, only the bare <b>stem.</b> <b>Class</b> IV verbs end in -ia or -ua in the present, but lose their final a in all the other tenses (including the subjunctive), and add a j in the past and perfect.|$|E
5000|$|In class A, the accented {{syllable}} {{always had the}} acute tone, and therefore was always long, because short syllables did not have tonal distinctions. Thus, single-syllable words with an originally short vowel (*e, *o, *ь, *ъ) in the stem could not belong to accent class A. If the stem was multisyllabic, the accent could potentially fall on any stem syllable (e.g. *ję̄zū́k- [...] "tongue"). These restrictions were caused by Dybo's law, which moved the accent one syllable to the right, but only in originally barytonic (stem-accented) nominals {{that did not have}} acute accent in the <b>stem.</b> <b>Class</b> A thus consists of the [...] "leftover" [...] words that Dybo's law did not affect.|$|E
5000|$|The {{new school}} officially opened on August 15, 2011 with an {{enrollment}} of 180 students.

It cost $5.6 million to open the school with the money being used for renovations of the building, upgrades, and technology equipment. Students were still required to meet the academic standards presented by Knox County Schools but the material was delivered {{through the use of}} iPads, block scheduling, and cross planning through departments. Students were also required to take a <b>STEM</b> <b>class,</b> which is a project based learning course. The school partners with over 215 business and organizations.|$|E
50|$|The partner school {{requires}} {{a student to}} take courses in calculus, physics, chemistry, and computer science before transferring. Some of the more established programs ensure admission given that the student fulfills grade, GPA, and course requirements. Other partner schools have students apply as transfer students.

5000|$|Kathlamet {{has four}} major word classes: pronouns, nouns, verbs, and articles. Pronoun words are always {{members of the}} pronominal <b>stem</b> <b>class.</b> And there are two {{subclass}}es of pronoun stems. The first stems of subclass occur with prefixes marking 1st, 2nd and 3rd person. The second stems of subclass occur with prefixed only marking 3rd person. Nouns can be inflected for the initial prefixes, possessive pronominal prefixes and initial prefixes (as nominalizers), in which in similar in form to the prefixes of demonstratives prefixes of verbs. Possessive pronominal prefixes may be inflected for person and number for gender and number prefixes. Verbs may contain initial tense prefixes. Unlike noun and pronoun words, verb may show more than one occurrence of the paradigm. The number of occurrences ranges from one to three mostly by relative order position, partly by special forms. Nouns may be used with the pronominal prefix as an absolutive. Verbs also are used as nominal. Nouns stem belonging to a joint class, such as VN, NP and VNP. Nouns can come in two different types; a simple noun, which is a single stem morpheme; and complex nouns, which have an apparent sequence. Similar to English, adverbials in Kathlamet {{may be used to}} indicate directional relations, such as “with” “for” “near” “toward” “out”.(Mithun 1999) ...|$|E
