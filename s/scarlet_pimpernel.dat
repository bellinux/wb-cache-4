In 1982, {{she appeared}} in The <b>Scarlet</b> <b>Pimpernel</b> with Anthony Andrews and her Amadeus costar Ian McKellen. In 1984, Seymour appeared nude in the film Lassiter, co-starring Tom Selleck, but the film was a box office flop. In 1987, Seymour {{was the subject of a}} pictorial in Playboy magazine, although she did not pose nude.|$|E
50|$|A {{series of}} novels by Lauren Willig, {{beginning}} with The Secret History of the Pink Carnation (2005), chronicle {{the adventures of}} the <b>Scarlet</b> <b>Pimpernel's</b> associates, including the Purple Gentian (alias of Lord Richard Selwick), spies in the Napoleonic era.|$|R

60|$|Their large {{travelling}} chaise {{took them}} some distance on the North Road, {{where they were}} to meet Lord Hastings and Lord Anthony Dewhurst, two of The <b>Scarlet</b> <b>Pimpernel's</b> most trusted lieutenants, who were to escort them {{as far as the}} coast, and thence see them safely aboard the English yacht.|$|R
25|$|However, most major-market 21st-century {{productions}} {{have taken}} a safe route, with revivals of familiar fare, such as Fiddler on the Roof, A Chorus Line, South Pacific, Gypsy, Hair, West Side Story and Grease, or with adaptations of other proven material, such as literature (The <b>Scarlet</b> <b>Pimpernel,</b> Wicked and Fun Home), hoping that the shows would have a built-in audience as a result. This trend is especially persistent with film adaptations, including (The Producers, Spamalot, Hairspray, Legally Blonde, The Color Purple, Xanadu, Billy Elliot, Shrek, Waitress, and Groundhog Day). Some critics {{have argued that the}} reuse of film plots, especially those from Disney (such as Mary Poppins and The Little Mermaid), equate the Broadway and West End musical to a tourist attraction, rather than a creative outlet.|$|E
500|$|The film's concept {{designer}} Brian Froud {{has stated}} that the character of Jareth was influenced by a diverse range of literary sources. In his afterword to The Goblins of Labyrinth, Froud wrote that Jareth references [...] "the romantic figures of Heathcliff in Wuthering Heights and a brooding Rochester from Jane Eyre" [...] and the <b>Scarlet</b> <b>Pimpernel.</b> Bowie's costumes were intentionally eclectic, drawing on the image of Marlon Brando's leather jacket from The Wild One {{as well as that}} of a knight [...] "with the worms of death eating through his armour" [...] from the fairy tales of the Brothers Grimm.|$|E
500|$|The Bulldog Drummond {{stories of}} H. C. McNeile follow Captain Hugh [...] "Bulldog" [...] Drummond, DSO, MC. Drummond {{is a member}} of [...] "the Breed", a class of Englishman who were patriotic, loyal and [...] "physically and morally intrepid". Drummond is a wealthy gentleman, {{formerly}} an officer in the fictional [...] "Royal Loamshire Regiment", who, after the First World War, spends his new-found leisure time looking for adventure. McNeile first wrote the Drummond character as a detective for a short story in The Strand Magazine, but the portrayal was not successful and was changed for the novel Bull-dog Drummond, which was a thriller. The character was an amalgam of McNeile's friend Gerard Fairlie, and his idea of an English gentleman, although writer J.D. Bourn disputes Fairlie's claim to be a model for the character, noting that [...] "he was still at school when Sapper created his... hero". Drummond also had roots in the literary characters Sherlock Holmes, Sexton Blake, Richard Hannay and The <b>Scarlet</b> <b>Pimpernel.</b>|$|E
50|$|At the 35th Primetime Emmy Awards, The <b>Scarlet</b> <b>Pimpernels</b> costume {{designer}} Phyllis Dalton won the Emmy Award for Outstanding Costume Design for a Limited Series or a Special. The film also received nominations for Outstanding Drama Special (for producer David Conroy {{and executive producer}} Mark Shelmerdine) and Outstanding Art Direction for a Limited Series or a Special (for production designer Tony Curtis and set decorator Carolyn Scott).|$|R
60|$|He {{even made}} her smile quite merrily by telling {{her of the}} <b>Scarlet</b> <b>Pimpernel's</b> quaint and many disguises, through which he had baffled the strictest watch set against him at the {{barricades}} of Paris. This last time, the escape of the Comtesse de Tournay and her children had been a veritable masterpiece--Blakeney disguised as a hideous old market-woman, in filthy cap and straggling grey locks, was a sight fit to make the gods laugh.|$|R
50|$|Through {{his network}} of spies, Chauvelin discovers that Armand St. Just, Marguerite's brother {{is one of}} the <b>Scarlet</b> <b>Pimpernel's</b> agents. Chauvelin orders Armand's arrest, then uses the threat of his {{execution}} to force Marguerite into helping him discover the identity of the Pimpernel, who he knows will be at an upcoming ball. At the ball, Marguerite intercepts a message given to Sir Andrew Ffoulkes, a member of the Pimpernel's band, stating that the Pimpernel will be in the library at midnight. She passes the information along to Chauvelin, who goes to the library to find only Percy, apparently asleep. While waiting, Chauvelin falls asleep; when he wakes up, he finds a message from the Pimpernel mocking him.|$|R
500|$|Tim McInnerny, who had {{starred in}} The Black Adder and Blackadder II as Lord Percy Percy, {{was afraid to}} be typecast in comedic roles and decided not {{to appear in the}} third {{instalment}} of Blackadder, though he did appear in the episode [...] "Nob and Nobility", as Lord Topper, a snobby aristocrat who claims to be The <b>Scarlet</b> <b>Pimpernel,</b> and returned in the fourth series playing Captain Kevin Darling. The Prince George character was created as a new [...] "incompetent sidekick" [...] for the title character. He was modelled after George IV of the United Kingdom, who served as Prince Regent between 1811 and 1820. Laurie had previously guest starred in the final two episodes of Blackadder II, and the producers decided to cast him in the role of Prince George. Laurie's physical appearance differed significantly from George IV's appearance, who was obese during the time of his regency. Writers Ben Elton and Richard Curtis were unfazed by this, referring to George as [...] "a fat, flatulent [...] ", an appropriate description for the real Prince rather than Laurie.|$|E
500|$|In 1920 McNeile {{published}} Bull-Dog Drummond, whose eponymous hero—a {{member of}} [...] "the Breed"—became {{his most famous}} creation. He had first written Drummond as a detective for a short story in The Strand Magazine, but the character was not successful and was changed for the novel, which was a thriller. Captain Hugh [...] "Bulldog" [...] Drummond DSO, MC was described in the novel's sub-title as [...] "a demobilised officer who found peace dull" [...] after service during the First World War with the fictional Loamshire Regiment. Drummond went on to appear in ten full-length novels by McNeile and a further seven by his friend Gerard Fairlie. The character was an amalgam of Fairlie, himself, and his idea of an English gentleman. Drummond also had roots in the literary characters Sherlock Holmes, Sexton Blake, Richard Hannay and The <b>Scarlet</b> <b>Pimpernel.</b> Drummond was characterised as large, very strong, physically unattractive and an [...] "apparently brainless hunk of a man", {{who was also a}} gentleman with a private income; he could also be construed as [...] "a brutalized ex-officer whose thirst for excitement is also an attempt to reenact [...] the war". The character was later described by Cecil Day-Lewis, author of rival gentleman detective Nigel Strangeways, as an [...] "unspeakable public school bully". Drummond's main adversary across four novels is Carl Peterson, a master criminal with no national allegiance, who is often accompanied by his wife, Irma. Irma is described by Jonathon Green as [...] "the slinky epitome of a twenties 'vamp, and by Lawrence Treadwell as dark, sexy and from an oriental background, [...] "a true femme fatale". After Carl Peterson's death in The Final Count, Irma swears revenge on Drummond and kidnaps his wife—whom he had met in Bull-Dog Drummond—with the intent of killing him in the ensuing chase. Irma Peterson appears in six of McNeile's books, and in a further five by Fairlie.|$|E

5000|$|In 1792, at {{the bloody}} {{height of the}} French Revolution's Reign of Terror, vengeful French mobs are outraged when again and again French aristocrats are saved from death by the audacious [...] "Band of the Scarlet Pimpernel", a secret society of 20 English noblemen, [...] "one to command, and {{nineteen}} to obey". Among the latest scheduled for execution are the Count de Tournay, former ambassador to Great Britain, and his family. However, one of the <b>Scarlet</b> <b>Pimpernel's</b> men visits them in prison disguised as a priest and gives them a message of hope. As the prisoners are being escorted to the cart {{to be taken to}} the guillotine, the guards take the count away; French leader Maximilien Robespierre wishes to question him further. The countess and her daughter are rescued and spirited away to England.|$|R
60|$|He {{himself had}} never felt so calm. The only thing he could regret {{was that he was}} alone. Half a dozen men now, and this impudent foe could indeed be brought to his knees. And this time there would be no risks taken, no chances for escape. Somehow it seemed to Chauvelin as if {{something}} of the <b>Scarlet</b> <b>Pimpernel's</b> audacity and foresight had gone from him. As he stood there, looking broad and physically powerful, there was something wavering and undecided in his attitude, as if the edge had been taken off his former recklessness and enthusiasm. He had brought the compromising papers here, had no doubt helped the Montorgueils to escape; but while Lucile Clamette and her family were under the eye of Lebel no amount of impudence could force a successful bargaining.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is, of course, {{the case}} of the Comte de Tournay, this time; a {{dangerous}} task, for the Comte, whose escape from his chateau, after he had been declared a 'suspect' by the Committee of Public Safety, was a masterpiece of the <b>Scarlet</b> <b>Pimpernel's</b> ingenuity, is now under sentence of death. It will be rare sport to get HIM out of France, and you will have a narrow escape, if you get through at all. St. Just has actually gone to meet him--of course, no one suspects St. Just as yet; but after that [...] . to get them both out of the country! I'faith, 'twill be a tough job, and tax even the ingenuity of our chief. I hope I may yet have orders to be of the party." ...|$|R

2500|$|His {{heroes are}} the highwayman [...] "The Shadow" [...] and The <b>Scarlet</b> <b>Pimpernel,</b> (or the [...] "Scarlet Pimple" [...] as Baldrick {{believes}} {{his name to}} be). The former was executed {{as a result of}} Blackadder's informing, and the latter was poisoned by him.|$|E
2500|$|The symbols on a Jolly Roger {{are used}} to {{indicate}} {{the achievements of the}} submarine. Bars represented ships torpedoed, although post-war flags have sometimes used the silhouette of the target ship instead. Mines indicated minelaying operations, while torches or lighthouses meant the boat had been used as a navigation marker for an operation. More unusual symbols have also been used, with comic character Eugene the Jeep marking the recovery of a Chariot manned torpedo, and a dog used for submarines involved in Operation Husky. Some icons are unique to a submarine: [...] bears a <b>scarlet</b> <b>pimpernel</b> flower, marking the time a French spy forgot the recognition password and instead quoted from the play The <b>Scarlet</b> <b>Pimpernel</b> to prove herself, while a stork and baby was added to the Jolly Roger of [...] when news of the birth of the captain's first child arrived while on patrol.|$|E
40|$|We discuss {{explanation}} {{of an earlier}} event by a later event, and argue that prima facie cases of backwards event explanation are ubiquitous. Some examples: (1) I am tidying my flat because my brother is coming to visit tomorrow. (2) The <b>scarlet</b> <b>pimpernels</b> are closing because it is about to rain. (3) The volcano is smoking because {{it is going to}} erupt soon. We then look at various ways people might attempt to explain away these prima facie cases by arguing that in each case the 2 ̆ 7 real 2 ̆ 7 explanation is something else. We argue that none of the explaining-away strategies are successful, and so any plausible account of explanation should either make room for backwards explanation, or have a good story to tell about why it doesn 2 ̆ 7 t have to...|$|R
5000|$|Legend says Saint Urith {{was born}} at East Stowford in Swimbridge parish, in the English county of Devon. She was {{converted}} to Christianity by St Kea, lived as a hermit in nearby Chittlehampton, where she founded a church. At the urging of an allegedly jealous, and perhaps pagan, stepmother, some female haymakers beheaded the girl with a scythe, {{during a period of}} severe drought. When she fell to the ground, a spring of water burst from the spot and flowers, thought to be <b>scarlet</b> <b>pimpernels,</b> sprang forth wherever a drop of her blood was sprinkled. [...] These last elements of her legend are the same as those found in the Lives of Sidwell and Juthwara. Urith was buried near the site of her martyrdom and a church was later built above her grave. A more likely version of her death suggests she was killed by invading Saxons, although if the traditional 8th century date is correct, this may, in reality, have been an early Viking raid.|$|R
60|$|The cheerful voice {{seemed to}} ease the tension. Marguerite sighed a sigh of relief. After all, what was more natural than that Percy with his amazing fund of {{pleasant}} irresponsibility should thus greet {{the man who had}} once vowed to bring him to the guillotine? Chauvelin, himself, accustomed by now to the audacious coolness of his enemy, was scarcely taken by surprise. He bowed low to His Highness, who, vastly amused at Blakeney's sally, was inclined to be gracious to everyone, even though the personality of Chauvelin as a well-known leader of the regicide government was inherently distasteful to him. But the Prince saw in the wizened little figure before him an obvious butt for his friend Blakeney's impertinent shafts, and although historians have been unable to assert positively whether or no George Prince of Wales knew aught of Sir Percy's dual life, yet {{there is no doubt that}} he was always ready to enjoy a situation which brought about the discomfiture of any of the <b>Scarlet</b> <b>Pimpernel's</b> avowed enemies.|$|R
2500|$|Fred (1863–1933) was the {{youngest}} of the eleven children of Benjamin and Sarah Terry. Fred had a long and successful career on the stage. [...] He was known as a leading man in classic plays but achieved his greatest fame in swashbuckling parts such as the title role in The <b>Scarlet</b> <b>Pimpernel.</b> [...] He married the actress Julia Neilson, with whom he regularly co-starred. Their children, Phyllis and Dennis Neilson-Terry, followed them into acting careers.|$|E
2500|$|Rowland Brown (November 6, 1900 – May 6, 1963), born Chauncey Rowland Brown in Canton, Ohio, was an American screenwriter {{and film}} {{director}}, whose {{career as a}} director ended in the early 1930s after he started many more films than he finished. He walked out of State's Attorney (1932), starring John Barrymore. He was abruptly replaced as director of The <b>Scarlet</b> <b>Pimpernel.</b> As a writer, he was credited with twenty or so films [...] including two Academy Award nominations, one in the 11th Academy Awards for Best Original Story Angels with Dirty Faces and another in the 4th Academy Awards for Doorway to Hell.|$|E
2500|$|The most {{consequential}} walk-off of {{his career}} {{was the one that}} left him unemployed and stranded in England. The legendary Hungarian director, Alexander Korda, was attempting to make British films distinguishable from American films, and in 1934 he invited the image-oriented Brown to direct The <b>Scarlet</b> <b>Pimpernel.</b> The invitation was a huge opportunity for the young director. Not long after the filming had begun, Korda arrived on the set to observe Brown at work. He told Brown that he was directing the classic like a gangster film. Raymond Massey, who witnessed the scene, wrote [...] "Brown announced he would direct the way he liked or walk out. Alex said very sweetly, 'Please walk.'" [...] Korda, himself, an enormously successful director was known for his outbursts and the ill treatment of subordinates, Brown was known for walkouts related to autonomy.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the season}} eleven episode [...] "E-I-E-I-(Annoyed Grunt)", The Simpsons go to a {{screening}} of The Poke of Zorro, which is largely a parody of the Zorro film The Mask of Zorro (1998). Jonathan Gray wrote in Watching with The Simpsons: Television, Parody, and Intertextuality that The Poke of Zorro [...] "ridicules the outlandishness of Hollywood blockbuster fare," [...] especially its [...] "blatant historical inaccuracies" [...] which sees the film feature Zorro, King Arthur, the Three Musketeers, the <b>Scarlet</b> <b>Pimpernel,</b> [...] "the Man in the Iron Mask and ninjas in nineteenth century Mexico". The Buzz Cola advertisement shown before The Poke of Zorro is a parody of the opening Normandy invasion sequence from the film Saving Private Ryan (1998). Gray writes that it [...] "scorns the proclivity of ads to use any gimmick to grab attention, regardless of the ethics: as an indignant Lisa asks incredulously, 'Do they really think cheapening the memory of our veterans will sell soda?'" ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1934, Matsumoto {{drew his}} first {{full-fledged}} manga, a 16-page story titled [...] Printed as an over-sized pamphlet with a sturdy cardboard cover, and {{included as a}} premium in the April issue of Shōjo no tomo, The Mysterious Clover was a variation on The <b>Scarlet</b> <b>Pimpernel</b> and Zorro. The protagonist of The Mysterious Clover is a young girl who protects the poor peasants from the cruel and greedy nobles. This work is remarkable for its use of varying angles, including bird's-eye views, and variation {{in the size of}} panels. Sakō Shishido (...) , influenced by American newspaper strips, had used similar techniques in his 1930 , but in a far cruder drawing style than Matsumoto's. The Mysterious Clover had been neglected for decades by manga scholars until it was displayed at a 2006 exhibition at the Yayoi Art Museum, where it caught the eye of Fusanosuke Natsume, who then wrote about it on his blog and in a newspaper column.|$|E
