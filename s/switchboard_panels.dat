50|$|Attached to {{the south}} side of the plinth is a small, wood framed shed with a gabled roof; it is clad with {{corrugated}} iron. This contains a concrete footing, <b>switchboard,</b> control <b>panel</b> <b>switchboard,</b> and a vacuum gauge.|$|R
40|$|This project {{entails the}} design and {{assembly}} of the photovoltaic system, <b>switchboard</b> <b>panel</b> enclosure, and battery enclosure for the DC Houseâ€™s main electrical system. The intended purpose of this project is to provide the electrical framework necessary for future students to easily modify and add to this rendition of the DC House. The principle design implements a variety of renewable energy sources, however this senior project only uses solar power {{in order to maintain}} a manageable scope. Each of these renewable energy sources are stepped down to a voltage of 24 V and input to a Multi Input Single Output DC to DC converter (MISO) located within the <b>switchboard</b> <b>panel</b> enclosure. The MISO then connects to a set of batteries which power the loads of the DC House operating at 48 V. The finished assembly of the photovoltaic array and panel enclosure will then be retrofitted to a small house located at the Student Experimental Farm (SEF). After the retrofit, the electrical system will be tested at the source and load sides to ensure proper system functionality...|$|R
25|$|For {{compatibility}} with manual offices, {{two types of}} signaling were supported. In areas with mostly machine switches and a few manual <b>switchboards,</b> <b>Panel</b> Call Indicator (PCI) signaling lit lamps on the B operator's desk at the terminating manual office. The lamps illuminated digits on a display panel corresponding to the number dialed. The manual operator connected the call to the appropriate jack, and then repeated the process for the next incoming call. In areas with mostly manual switches, the Call Annunciator signaling system was used to avoid installing lamp panels at every operator station. The Call Annunciator used speech recorded on strips of photographic film to verbally announce the called number to the answering operator.|$|R
50|$|The 111 service {{began on}} 29 September 1958 {{in the two}} towns. When a {{subscriber}} dialled 111 at either exchange, the call was routed by the automatic exchange onto one of three dedicated lines to the toll switchboard at the Masterton exchange (although the exchange connected calls automatically, long-distance (toll) calls still had to be connected manually through an operator). A red light glowed on the <b>switchboard</b> <b>panel,</b> and another red light would glow {{on top of the}} switchboard. Two hooters also sounded, one in the exchange and the other in the building passage. The first operator to plug into the line took the call, and a supervisor would plug into the line to help if the situation became difficult.|$|R
50|$|The {{company went}} {{underground}} {{in a big}} way in the 1920s, creating expensive new outside plant that fixed its geometry for the century to come. New cable ducts brought more reliable service to customers. They converged at approximately twenty wire centers, which were connected by larger trunk cable ducts running along the East and West Sides of Manhattan. The locations were a mile or two apart (2-3 km), close to concentrations of office workers without paying prime prices for land. At each wire center a new central office arose to house telephone <b>switchboards,</b> <b>panel</b> switches and other inside plant, and technicians, clerks, operators and other workers. The largest of these was also the corporate headquarters, at 140 West Street on the Lower West Side, about a kilometer (half mile) from AT&T HQ at 195 Broadway.|$|R
5000|$|As {{a partner}} with his brother, Henry and one other man, Frank T. Wheeler, in 1891, he formed the Trumbull Electric Company, which {{produced}} electrical supply parts including porcelain fixtures, <b>switchboards</b> and <b>panels.</b> He served as President of that company from 1911 to 1944. [...] It later became part of General Electric. He also was board chairman of Colonial Air Transport, Incorporated; director and treasurer of Plainville Realty Company; president of Plainville Trust Company; and director of Connecticut Light & Power Company. Trumbull joined the First Connecticut Infantry in 1891, finally reaching the rank of colonel in the State Guard. He was a Republican. Trumbull served in the Connecticut Senate. He served as President pro tempore of the Connecticut Senate.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the improvement of}} power factor of an induction motor by using capacitor bank. When power factor is improved, automatically energy will be saved A power factor {{is the goal of}} any electrical utility company since if the power factor is less than one, they have to supply more current to the user for a given amount of power use. In so doing they occur more line losses. Induction motors are the most widely used electrical motors due to their reliability, low cost and robustness. For industrial and mining applications, 3 -phase AC induction motors are the prime movers {{for the vast majority of}} machines. It has been estimated that 70 % to 80 % of all electricity in the world is consumed by these motors. At no load induction motor has very low power factor. It improves at increasing load from no load to full load. Power factor correction is achieved by the addition of capacitors in parallel with the connected motor circuits and can be applied at the starter, or applied at the <b>switchboard</b> or distribution <b>panel...</b>|$|R
