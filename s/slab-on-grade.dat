50|$|A shallow {{foundation}} {{is a type}} of foundation which transfers building loads to the earth very near to the surface, rather than to a subsurface layer or a range of depths as does a deep foundation. Shallow foundations include spread footing foundations, mat-slab foundations, <b>slab-on-grade</b> foundations, pad foundations, rubble trench foundations and earthbag foundations.|$|E
50|$|<b>Slab-on-grade</b> or {{floating}} slab foundations are a structural engineering practice whereby the concrete slab {{that is to}} serve as the foundation for the structure is formed from a mold set into the ground. The concrete is then placed into the mold, leaving no space between the ground and the structure. This type of construction is most often seen in warmer climates, where ground freezing and thawing is less of a concern and where {{there is no need for}} heat ducting underneath the floor.|$|E
50|$|Environmental {{engineers}} note reduced {{carbon emissions}} and air quality emissions are usually {{of the same}} magnitude as the reduction in concrete needed for any foundation project. Since use of an on-grade mat foundation typically results in a 20% - 30% reduction in concrete, a similar or even greater reduction in carbon emissions and air emissions will also occur. Because a waffle slab uses less raw materials (cement, iron, fuel, water, aggregate, and sand) than traditional <b>slab-on-grade</b> foundations, the system is also more environmentally sustainable.|$|E
50|$|Traditionally, housing {{consisted}} {{primarily of}} single-family detached homes. <b>Slab-on-grade</b> foundations are the common base for residential {{buildings in the}} valley. Apartments generally were two story buildings. Until the 1990s, there were exceptions, but they were few and far between. In the 1990s, Turnberry Associates constructed the first high rise condominium towers. Prior to this, {{there were only a}} handful of mid-rise multi-family buildings. By the mid-2000s, there was a major move into high rise condominiums towers, which affected the region's skyline around the Strip.|$|E

This project was custom {{designed to meet}} the needs for the use by a minor league baseball team as well as for accommodating other sporting and festival type events. The structure and <b>slab-on-grade</b> was pile supported due to poor soil conditions and concern over scour from hurricanes.|$|E
5000|$|A {{strategy}} for group housing was followed, {{the result of}} questionnaires distributed to potential inhabitants, as well as considerations of the economy of attached units. Units are typically two stories tall, with one-story units {{at the ends of}} rows, initially called [...] "honeymoon units." [...] All units are <b>slab-on-grade,</b> with basements omitted {{as a result of the}} high local water table. Central utilities are provided. The concrete block units were built by unskilled labor, with the concrete first floor structure employed as the ceiling finish for the ground floor. Pitched-roof units were built using balloon frame construction.|$|E
5000|$|For the 40% {{of homes}} built with a <b>slab-on-grade</b> foundation, the zero-step {{entrance}} is typically extremely easy. The methods for homes are virtually {{identical to those}} used for slab-built commercial buildings such as banks and restaurants. For homes with basements or crawlspaces, several solutions can provide low-cost, attractive zero-step entrances. Among these are using a porch as a bridge to the sidewalk; lowering the first-floor rim joist into a notch in the foundation wall {{at the time of}} construction; a short, conventional ramp tied into a side or back deck or porch; creative use of a small retaining wall; and constructing the zero-step entrance from the garage.|$|E

40|$|Vapor {{intrusion}} is the vapor-phase {{migration of}} {{volatile organic compounds}} (VOCs) into buildings due to subsurface soil or groundwater contamination. Oxygen replenishment rates beneath a building are significant for quantifying potential contaminant degradation rates within the vadose zone. Additionally, the migration of VOC soil gas vapors into buildings {{is partly due to}} pressure differences between the building and the subsurface. This study addresses these issues through two laboratory scale experiments. The Wind Experiment quantifies oxygen replenishment rates as a function of above ground wind speed, while the Depressurization Experiment examines the flow rate of air into a model building as a function of decreased building pressure. For the Wind Experiment, tests were run for basement and <b>slab-on-grade</b> building configurations, as well as with and without a simulated sidewalk. Results show that increased above ground wind speed increases the oxygen replenishment rate and that the presence of a simulated sidewalk inhibits the oxygen replenishment rate. For the Depressurization Experiment, tests were again run for basement and <b>slab-on-grade</b> building configurations, as well as for two different foundation crack percentages. Results of the experiment indicate that increased building vacuum increases the flow rate of air into the building. In addition, basement configuration, increased foundation crack percentage, or some combination of the two results in increased airflow into the building. Additional research is needed for both experiments in order to obtain statistically significant results and resolve remaining uncertainties. Specific research needs include an improved wind source, additional monitoring locations, various sidewalk sizes and shapes, and different foundation crack configurations. by Joseph William Corsello.

40|$|A set {{of eight}} houses were studied {{throughout}} their construction in north central Florida. Each {{house was built}} in compliance with a proposed radon resistant construction standard being developed by the Florida Department of Community Affairs. Post-construction monitoring was performed over a minimum six day period for each structure during which each house was operated in three different heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) system configurations. Continuous measurements of indoor radon concentrations, house ventilation rate, across slab differential pressures and interzone differential pressures provide time resolved radon entry rates and a performance index for passive radon barriers. The study demonstrates that; 1) passive radon barriers can provide acceptable indoor radon concentrations for <b>slab-on-grade</b> structures built over soils having soil gas radon concentrations as high as 3. 1 x lo 5 Bq m 4 and 2) with an effective passive barrier, HVAC operational configurations have no detectable effect on indoor radon concentrations...|$|E
40|$|Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) is a {{geophysical}} {{imaging technique}} used for subsurface exploration and monitoring.

40|$|This Measure Guideline {{presents}} {{the steps to}} implement a compact duct system inside an attic bulkhead (plenum truss) of a one-story, <b>slab-on-grade</b> (SOG) home. In a compact duct design, ductwork runs are reduced in length to yield a smaller and more compact duct system. Less energy will be lost through ductwork if the ducts are contained within the thermal enclosure of the house. These measures are intended for the production builder working to meet the 2012 International Energy Conservation Code (IECC) requirements and keep the ductwork within the thermal enclosure of the house. This measure of bringing the heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) equipment and ductwork within the thermal enclosure {{of the house is}} appropriate for the builder wishing to avoid cathedralizing the insulation in the attic space (i. e., locating it at the underside of the roof deck rather than along the attic floor) or adding dropped soffits...|$|E
40|$|Exterior {{rigid foam}} {{insulation}} {{at the edge}} of the slab foundation was a unique feature for this low-load, unoccupied test house in a hot-dry climate and may be more appropriate for climates with higher heating loads. U. S.

One challenge during installation of the system was the attachment of the butyl flashing to the open framing. To solve this constructability issue, the team added a nailer to the base of the wall to properly attach and lap the flashing.

40|$|The use of Fiber Reinforced Concrete (FRC) {{has gained}} {{considerable}} {{attention in the}} last few years, particularly when crack propagation control is of primary importance, such as in <b>slab-on-grade</b> applications or in beams when shear reinforcement is partly or totally absent.

Fibers limit the growth of shear inclined crack, give visible warning prior the structure collapse and also provide a stable and diffused crack pattern within the shear critical area. However, the issue of size effect in members containing steel fibers, has not been deeply investigated and evaluated yet. This paper studies the beneficial influence of fibers on the size effect in members without conventional shear reinforcement.

40|$|Six <b>slab-on-grade</b> {{houses in}} Polk County, Florida, with indoor radon levels between 19 and 80 pCi/ 1 were mitigated using sub-slab {{depressurization}} systems. With the compacted, moist soil fill under the slabs, sufficient sub-slab communications {{were difficult to}} establish. Increasing the suction pit size and using more powerful fans improved {{the strength of the}} pressure fields within 3 to 8 m of the suction holes but did little to extend them beyond this radius. The most effective means for extending the field was found to be installing additional suction holes (depressurized by the same fan) in locations where the pressure field was the weakest. Suction holes were placed both in centralized and in near-perimeter locations reached either by interior slab holes or through holes in the exterior stem wall. Indoor radon levels were measured using 2 -day charcoal canisters, continuous radon monitors, and long-term (3 mo- 1 yr) alpha track detectors. This paper has been reviewed in accordance with the U.

40|$|We {{report a}} field study of soil gas {{transport}} of {{volatile organic compounds}} (VOCs) into a <b>slab-on-grade</b> building found at a site contaminated with gasoline. Although the high VOC concentrations (30 - 60 g m{sup - 3 }) measured in the soil gas at depths of 0. 7 m below the building suggest a potential for high levels of indoor VOC, the measured indoor air concentrations were lower {{than those in the}} soil gas by approximately six orders of magnitude ({approx} 0. 03 mg m{sup - 3 }). This large ratio is explained by (1) the expected dilution of soil gas entering the building via ambient building ventilation (a factor of {approx} 1000), and (2) an unexpectedly sharp gradient in soil gas VOC concentration between the depths of 0. 1 and 0. 7 m (a factor of {approx} 1000).

40|$|Explicit {{algebraic}} equations for {{calculation of}} wind and stack driven ventilation were developed by parametrically matching exact solutions to the flow equations for building envelopes. These separate wind and stack effect flow calculation procedures were incorporated in a simple natural ventilation model, AIM- 2, with empirical functions for superposition {{of wind and}} stack effect and for estimating wind shelter. The major improvements over previous simplified ventilation calculations are: a power law pressure-flow relationship is used to develop the flow equations form first principles, the furnace or fireplace flue is included as a separate leakage site and the model differentiates between houses with basements (or <b>slab-on-grade)</b> and crawlspaces. Over 3400 hours of measured ventilation rates from the test houses at the Alberta Home Heating Research Facility were used to validate the predictions of ventilation rates and to compare the AIM- 2 predictions {{to those of other}} ventilation models.
