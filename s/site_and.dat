5|$|In 1988 Regalian Properties {{purchased}} the <b>site,</b> <b>and</b> appointed Terry Farrell as architect.

The government then bought the <b>site</b> <b>and</b> design {{as a future}} headquarters for the Secret Intelligence Service, and the design was accordingly modified to increase security.

For the two novel data sources, we also compared their CDFs after shifting {{with the original}} ones as shown in Figure 3. The Kolmogorove-Smimov statistic (KS statistic) for CDFs of DNA duplex stability scores at random <b>sites</b> <b>and</b> double strand binding <b>sites</b> is 0.3097, <b>and</b> that of random <b>sites</b> <b>and</b> single strand binding sites is 0.3641 (as depicted in Figure 3 (a)). However, after shifting, the KS statistics between random locations and double strand binding <b>sites</b> <b>and</b> between random <b>sites</b> <b>and</b> single strand binding <b>sites</b> become 0.1905 <b>and</b> 0.1168, respectively, (see Figure 3 (c)). Similarly, the KS statistic between the CDFs of nucleosome positioning data at random <b>sites</b> <b>and</b> nucleosome binding <b>sites</b> is 0.1699 (Figure 3 (b)) and drops to 0.0379 after shifting (Figure 3 (d)). We also measured the Kullback-Leibler divergence (KL divergence) between each density pair. The KL divergence between PDFs of DNA duplex stability scores at random <b>sites</b> <b>and</b> double and single strand binding <b>sites</b> are 0.1868 <b>and</b> 0.6617 (Figure 3 (a)), which decreases to 0.1037 and 0.1065, respectively, after shifting (Figure 3 (c)). Likewise, the KL divergence between PDFs of nucleosome positioning data at random <b>sites</b> <b>and</b> nucleosome occupied <b>sites</b> drops from 0.1830 to 0.0330 after shifting, as represented by Figures 3 (b) and 3 (d), respectively. These results show that no information is gained from the shifted data sources. Taken together with the cross-validation results shown above, this demonstrates that the improved binding prediction accuracy is not an artifact of overfitting.|$|R
