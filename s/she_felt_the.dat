5|$|In 2002 {{producers}} asked Barlow {{to return}} as Mavis, {{but she was}} too busy. In 2006 Barlow claimed that she had again been asked to return to Coronation Street, but had refused as <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> storylines were not good enough for Mavis. Barlow stated in 2007 that she is unlikely to return, because she would be unable to cope with the accelerated production schedule of one more episode a week since her last appearance in 1997. Executive producer Kim Crowther said in 2009 that she would have liked Mavis to return to the serial.|$|E
5|$|Kukunoor had not visited Rajasthan or Himachal Pradesh before, but he {{felt that}} he would find great {{locations}} there. Salooni in Chamba district is considered for shooting in Himachal Pradesh. In spite of this geographical inexperience, all went as per the plans while shooting in Rajasthan. However, minor modifications in the script were allowed for the surroundings. Though Panag had been in Rajasthan, <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> scorching summer heat unbearable at times. She liked the only continuous shooting schedule and said that it provided consistency in look and performance. In Himachal, it was slightly different when the crew had hard time framing the mountains correctly. On seeing the captured frames, they shifted all the interior shots to outside.|$|E
5|$|The Jackson-Rowe {{friendship}} {{would last}} for several years, {{during which time}} Rowe married and divorced Richard Edelman, a man she claimed to have felt trapped by. Rowe and the musician would both {{talk to each other}} about their unhappy marriages; his with Presley and hers with Edelman, a teacher at Hollywood High School. Like Jackson's first wife, Rowe supported the entertainer when he was accused of child sexual abuse. Jackson kept his friendship with Rowe a secret from his wife, who eventually found out but thought nothing of it; <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> dermatologist's assistant was not her husband's type because she was not glamorous enough.|$|E

5|$|Williams {{had wanted}} to make a horror game for eight years prior to Phantasmagoria, and had started to design one on several occasions, but none came to fruition. <b>She</b> <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> {{computer}} game industry and software technology had not yet reached the point where an effective and frightening computer game could be made. As a result, she decided to wait until CD-ROMs were faster and could handle real actors, which she believed was crucial for a horror game because <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> player {{had to be able to}} empathize with the character to fear for them. Williams had been considering several horror story ideas for years before making the game. In one, the heroine answers a magician's advertisement for an assistant and gets the job, but the magician turns out to be insane. Another was set in the past, with the female protagonist getting involved in the supernatural life of a magician character. That idea evolved into a woman being married to a man who is drawn to a bizarre house that previously belonged to illusionists and is haunted by ghosts. The final story as it appears in the game has a contemporary setting, but combines elements from modern fiction, 19th century literature, and classic horror films of the 1950s.|$|E
5|$|Nina Tucker is {{a fictional}} {{character}} from the Australian soap opera Neighbours, played by Delta Goodrem. She made her first screen appearance during the episode broadcast on 11 June 2002. Goodrem {{was approached by}} producers after they saw her video for her debut single. Goodrem, who had just signed a record deal, almost turned down the role of Nina as <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> character did not suit her style of music. The role was rewritten for her and she joined the cast. A year later, {{she was diagnosed with}} Hodgkin's lymphoma and had to leave the show for treatment. Once her health improved, she made a return to Neighbours in 2004 to tie up Nina's storylines. In 2005, Neighbours celebrated its 20th anniversary with an episode that featured many ex-cast members, in which Goodrem reprised her role as Nina once more. She returned again in March 2015 for the show's 30th anniversary.|$|E

She canvassed in support of abortion reform bills before becoming dissatisfied with what <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> was <b>the</b> prioritization of medical professionals over women. [...] By 1963, Maginnis had adopted a radical ideology which supported the repeal of all abortion laws which <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> diminished <b>the</b> rights of women and would hinder access to abortion for all women.|$|R
25|$|On April 14, 2011, {{the show}} began a 30-day {{countdown}} to the finale. The countdown displayed {{the number of}} shows left {{at the beginning of}} every episode and concluded each episode with notable pop-culture figures thanking Winfrey for her contribution to the world and wishing her luck on all future endeavors. The countdown also featured exclusive videos from Winfrey on Oprah.com recorded after every show in which she expressed how <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> taping that day went.|$|E
25|$|Churchill first {{sought the}} opinion of friends and {{relations}} about the book. He asked his grandmother, Frances, Duchess of Marlborough, to comment, with particular reference {{to the character of}} Lucile. She responded that <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> book was worthy of publication, particularly since it already had the prospect of a reasonable financial return, but felt the plot might be improved. She was impressed by the descriptions of fighting, but agreed with Churchill's concerns about Lucile, suggesting that the character betrayed his lack of experience of women. However, an offer of £100 from the Morning Post for the right to serialise the book left Churchill no time for amendments, and it was published as it stood.|$|E
25|$|In Tekken 5, Nina {{decides to}} make contact with Anna in hopes of {{restoring}} her memory, but their meeting triggers Nina's lost feelings of hostility towards her sister, and she immediately opens fire. Anna retaliates, and the reunion descends into a gunfight which lasts for days. The sisters eventually reach a stalemate and agree to settle things for good and a portion of their battle {{can be seen in the}} introductory sequence of the game. During their battle in the tournament, both sisters agreed that only one would walk away from their battle alive. However, when Nina defeats Anna, she refuses to take Anna's life as <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> fight was not satisfactory.|$|E

25|$|In 1993, she {{starred in}} a limited run at the Manhattan Theatre Club in the American premiere of Stephen Sondheim's revue, Putting It Together. Between 1994 and 1995 Andrews {{recorded}} two solo albums– the first saluted the music of Richard Rodgers and the second paid tribute {{to the words of}} Alan Jay Lerner. In 1995, she starred in the stage musical version of Victor/Victoria. It was her first appearance in a Broadway show in 35 years. Opening on Broadway on 25 October 1995 at the Marquis Theatre, it later went on the road for a world tour. When she was the only Tony Award nominee for the production, she declined the nomination saying that she could not accept because <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> entire production was snubbed.|$|E
25|$|In late 2005 <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> urge {{to return}} athletics, juggling her {{training}} {{and caring for}} her son. A loss to Nataliya Tobias at the 2006 national championships inspired her to restart her professional career and she began training with Iryna Lishchynska. She was happy with her improving times but suffered a narrow exit in the semi-finals at the 2007 European Athletics Indoor Championships. The outdoor season in 2007 {{proved to be a}} turning point however; she took the silver medal at the 2007 European Cup and set new 400 metres and 800metres personal bests. She ran the 800m under two minutes {{for the first time at}} the national championships, winning in 1.59.60seconds. Further improvements came shortly afterwards at the 2007 Summer Universiade where she won the gold medal, setting a world-leading time of 1.57.63seconds. The pressure to compete at the 2007 World Championships as world-leader proved too much for Krevsun, and she was knocked out in the heats with a below-par 2.02.45minutes. However, at the end of the season she was still the fifth fastest 800m athlete that year.|$|E

500|$|Lorde chose her stage {{name because}} she was fascinated with [...] "royals and aristocracy".
