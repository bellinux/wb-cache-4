25|$|Pulsed laser {{deposition}} is {{only one}} of many thin film deposition techniques. Other methods include molecular beam epitaxy (MBE), chemical vapor deposition (CVD), <b>sputter</b> <b>deposition</b> (RF, magnetron, and ion beam). The history of laser-assisted film growth started soon after the technical realization of the first laser in 1960 by Maiman. Smith and Turner utilized a ruby laser to deposit the first thin films in 1965, three years after Breech and Cross studied the laser-vaporization and excitation of atoms from solid surfaces. However, the deposited films were still inferior to those obtained by other techniques such as chemical vapor deposition and molecular beam epitaxy. In the early 1980s, a few research groups (mainly in the former USSR) achieved remarkable results on manufacturing of thin film structures utilizing laser technology. The breakthrough came in 1987 when Dijkkamp, Xindi Wu and Venkatesan were able to laser deposit a thin film of YBa2Cu3O7, a high temperature superconductive material, which was of superior quality to that of films deposited with alternative techniques. Since then, the technique of pulsed laser deposition has been utilized to fabricate high quality crystalline films, such as doped garnet thin films for use as planar waveguide lasers. The deposition of ceramic oxides, nitride films, metallic multilayers and various superlattices has been demonstrated. In the 1990s the development of new laser technology, such as lasers with high repetition rate and short pulse durations, made PLD a very competitive tool for the growth of thin, well defined films with complex stoichiometry.|$|E
40|$|Microscale to {{nanoscale}} {{carbon and}} carbon nitride particles and films were synthesized by using plasma discharge <b>sputtering</b> <b>deposition</b> techniques. Experimental {{results indicated that}} sizes and distributions of the particles were directly determined by both discharge voltage and bias voltage. <b>Sputtering</b> <b>deposition</b> at high discharge voltages yielded large sizes (micrometer order) of particles with a high disorder of distribution. Whereas <b>sputtering</b> <b>deposition</b> at low discharge voltages yielded nanoscale of particles that uniformly distributed {{on the surface of}} the substrate. Ar laser beam in combination with an optical microscope has been used, enabling one to remove these particles and to achieve preferred distributions of the particles. Low growth rate of the films was found at the low voltage discharge <b>sputtering</b> <b>deposition.</b> Bias voltage was employed during the experiments in order to speed up the growth rate and increase nitrogen content inside the carbon nitride film. With an increase of the bias voltage up to 5 kV, nanoparticles appeared in two-dimensional, sunflower type of cluster distributions.

40|$|Various {{high quality}} {{epitaxial}} films, especially oxides, have been synthesized using off-axis <b>sputtering</b> <b>deposition.</b> In this presentation, we report the experiment results of ZnO films grown by the off-axis <b>sputtering</b> <b>deposition.</b> Films were synthesized in temperatures ranged from room temperature to 600 C, and pressures from 5 mTorr to 150 mTorr. Film growth rate {{was measured by}} surface profilometer, ellipsometer, and wavelength dispersive spectrometry. Due to the collisions between the sputtered species and the residue gases, the kinetic energy of species was reduced and the transport of depositing species changed from a ballistic movement for low pressure to a diffuse drift for high pressure in which the transport species were almost thermalized. The measurements show an increase of growth rates along the gravity vector when the Knodson (Knudsen??) number of transport species is less than 0. 05, which suggests that gravity affected the transport characterization in off-axis <b>sputtering</b> <b>deposition.</b> Because the product of pressure (p) and travel distance (d) of sputtered species, p exceeds several mTorr-cm during film deposition, the classical simulations for sputtering process in high vacuum system may not be applied.
