40|$|The {{title of}} this thesis is: The Customary Law of <b>Intestate</b> <b>Succession.</b> The African {{customary}} law relating to <b>intestate</b> <b>succession</b> has always been known to discriminate against women. The thesis therefore focuses on the customary law of <b>intestate</b> <b>succession</b> in the countries of South Africa, Ghana and Swaziland and the inroads they have made in improving {{the rights of women}} in this discriminatory field of African customary law. This thesis consists of six chapters. Chapter 1 introduces the reader to the topic of the research. It highlights the organisation of the intended research which comprises: a statement of the problem, the legal framework, research methodology and a summary of the chapter. Chapter 2 defines the general terms and concepts used in the customary law of <b>intestate</b> <b>succession.</b> This facilitates an understanding of the general principles comprising the body of law known as the customary law of <b>intestate</b> <b>succession</b> and lays the foundation for the country specific issues that are investigated in the following chapters. Chapter 3 discusses the recognition, application and development of the customary law of <b>intestate</b> <b>succession</b> in the country of South Africa. Chapter 4 considers the rules and laws of the customary law of <b>intestate</b> <b>succession</b> in the West African country of Ghana. Chapter 5 explains the current rules and laws of the customary law of <b>intestate</b> <b>succession</b> prevailing in the Kingdom of Swaziland. Finally, chapter 6 brings the thesis to a meaningful end, by criticizing the approaches adopted by the countries of South Africa, Ghana and Swaziland in improving the rights of women as far as the customary law of <b>intestate</b> <b>succession</b> is concerned. The chapter also presents various recommendations for improving the rights of women in this discriminatory field of the law. Public, Constitutional, and InternationalLL. D...|$|R

50|$|The <b>Intestate</b> <b>Succession</b> Act of 1987 {{instituted a}} much simpler system of <b>intestate</b> <b>succession,</b> revoking common-law rules and all {{statutory}} adaptations in their entirety. The <b>Intestate</b> <b>Succession</b> Act, {{together with the}} Children’s Act, extended the categories of persons who may be heirs who take in intestacy. For example, all natural persons, irrespective of whether they are adopted or extra-marital, or conceived by artificial insemination, or born {{as a result of}} a surrogacy arrangement, nowadays have the capacity to inherit.|$|R
50|$|The law of {{intestacy}} {{was virtually}} codified by the <b>Intestate</b> <b>Succession</b> Act, which came into force on 18 March 1988. Before that, the South African system of <b>intestate</b> <b>succession</b> {{had to be}} construed {{from a variety of}} common-law and statutory rules. The law of <b>intestate</b> <b>succession</b> is rooted in the legislation of the States of Holland: the Political Ordinance of 1 April 1580, as clarified and amended by the Interpretation Ordinance of 13 May 1594 and Section 3 of the Placaat of 18 December 1599.|$|R

40|$|When {{a person}} dies without a will, the State {{effectively}} supplies a will by default via {{the laws of}} <b>intestate</b> <b>succession.</b> The laws of <b>intestate</b> <b>succession</b> may trigger a transfer of real property – “Land, and generally whatever is erected or growing upon or affixed to land ” (Black 1983, 636) – {{in the form of}} tenancy in common. Tenancy in common is a form of joint ownership in which cotenants have an undivided partial interest in property. If a cotenant dies intestate, any interest in property passes to his heirs (Black). An undivided partial interest allows a cotenant (subject to the rights of other cotenants) to use the entire property as if it were his own regardless of the size of his partial interest in the property. Tenancy in common that is the result of an inter-generational transfer of property through <b>intestate</b> <b>succession</b> {{is often referred to as}} heir property (Mitchell 2001). Tenancy in common is a legal form of real property and is not necessarily the result of the laws of <b>intestate</b> <b>succession.</b> Some people choose to hold property as tenants in common. Some purposefully will their property to their heirs as tenants in common. In this paper, I use the term heir property to refer to property that is held in tenancy in common as a result of the laws of <b>intestate</b> <b>succession.</b> My focus on <b>intestate</b> <b>succession</b> results in part from the fact that poor people are more likely than others to die without a valid will (AARP 2000). Hence, any economic consequences associated with the laws of <b>intestate</b> <b>succession</b> will be of greater significance to low income people and the regions where they live. The prevalence of poverty is not evenly distributed across rural America. Pockets of poverty persist. The Appalachian Region, Indian Reservations and the Ozarks are notable rural examples. Since <b>intestate</b> <b>succession</b> may be endemic to these areas, it is important to further examine its influence on property ownership and any subsequent economic consequences...|$|R

5000|$|Until recently, the {{application}} of the <b>Intestate</b> <b>Succession</b> Act was regulated on a racial basis. Certain intestate estates of African people were distributed according to the [...] "official customary law," [...] as entrenched in the Black Administration Act and its regulations, while the <b>Intestate</b> <b>Succession</b> Act applied {{to the rest of the}} population. The Black Administration Act, and the Regulations passed thereunder, provided that the estates of black people who died without leaving a valid will sometimes devolved according to “Black law and custom.” This meant, inter alia, that the reforms introduced by the <b>Intestate</b> <b>Succession</b> Act did not apply to spouses married in terms of African customary law. As far as children were concerned, the parallel system of African customary law of succession perpetuated discrimination against adopted, extra marital and even female children.|$|R

To rectify the unconstitutionality, the court read the words [...] "or partner in a permanent same-sex life partnership in which the partners have undertaken reciprocal duties of support" [...] into section 1(1) of the Act after the word [...] "spouse." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{manner in}} which assets are {{distributed}} depends on whether the deceased has left a valid will or other valid document containing testamentary provisions, such as an antenuptial contract. If the deceased has not left a valid will or valid document containing testamentary provisions, the deceased dies intestate; similarly, if the deceased leaves a valid will which does not dispose of all property, there is an intestacy as to the portion not disposed of. In the event of intestacy, the assets are distributed in a definite order of preference among the heirs, as stipulated by the <b>Intestate</b> <b>Succession</b> Act. Until recently, the Act (and its common-law precursor) existed side-by-side with a statutorily-regulated customary-law regime of <b>intestate</b> <b>succession,</b> applied on a racial basis, but this was brought to an end when the Constitutional Court, in Bhe v Magistrate, Khayelitsha, made the <b>Intestate</b> <b>Succession</b> Act applicable to all.|$|R

50|$|Under Roman-Dutch law, {{an illegitimate}} or extra-marital child {{inherited}} upon the intestacy of its mother, {{but not of}} its father. This limitation on {{the capacity of the}} extra-marital child to inherit on intestacy has been swept away by the <b>Intestate</b> <b>Succession</b> Act, which provides that, in general, illegitimacy shall not affect the capacity of one blood relation to inherit the intestate estate of another blood relation. Illegitimacy arising from incest, too, no longer presents a problem. Furthermore, as noted earlier, the tenuous position of extra-marital children under African customary law of succession, too, has been removed by making the <b>Intestate</b> <b>Succession</b> Act applicable to all children.|$|R
