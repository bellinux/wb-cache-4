The harvester {{was used in}} bark beetle calamity and <b>secondary</b> <b>felling</b> in mixed forest (spruce, fir, beech) stand with average incline of 70 %. Assisting its movement in these extreme conditions were two supporting bases, which were used to stabilize it in the stand. Our aim {{was to determine the}} damage to the trees, underwood and stand soil. The resulting damage of remaining stand was 6. 19 %, which is, considering the demanding terrain conditions and in comparison with the outcomes of other research, a relatively acceptable value. Damage to the underwood was not found, due to its insufficient height and low representation. Measurements of damage to the soil by its compression indicated that the heaviest damage was under the supporting bases, where a heavy surface damage was found by creation of holes up to 15 [*]cm deep. This type of damage is not dangerous, because it does not create a continuous track dangerous in storm rainfall and subsequent soil erosion. Soil compression in the track and on unimpaired soil reached lower levels. All of the measurements of compression by static penetration were carried out only to the depth of 15 [*]cm due to high soil skeleton. This also negatively affected the measurements, which had to be repeated in many cases...|$|E

40|$|We analyze large nationally {{representative}} {{surveys of the}} labor force from three developing Asian economies (India, the Philippines and Thailand) at two points in time separated by a decade or more. Secondary and tertiary education attainment rose in the interim while the Mincerian education-wage profile became more convex. We document these shifts, allowing for inter-cohort dynamics. Returns to <b>secondary</b> education <b>fell.</b> Returns to college rose for older workers everywhere and for young workers in India, but fell for young Thais and Filipinos. We develop a new decomposition that permits us to attribute the shifting returns to education to the evolving structure of employment and inter- and intra-industry wage patterns. <b>Secondary</b> returns <b>fell</b> sharply in every sector as secondary-educated workers rapidly became available, while employment structures shifted slowly to absorb them. Conversely, rising returns within modern services were instrumental in lifting the returns to tertiary education. More manufacturing jobs will enable the Philippines to leverage higher growth from its human capital stock. Returns to secondary education in India have come to depend less on the manufacturing sector as manufacturing employment growth has been concentrated in low-skill sub-sectors. The intercohort divergence in returns to college arises in the Philippines and Thailand because excess young college-educated workers are pushed into low-wage or low-return jobs, while older college graduates are more likely to work in modern services. As modern service employment grows slowly, the largest and growing share of services employment has been in low-wage traditional services. From an employment perspective, “services-led development” therefore appears to be a red herring...|$|R

40|$|Objective To {{investigate}} {{factors associated}} with variations in diagnoses of primary, secondary and early latent syphilis in England and Wales. Methods Data were derived from two sources: diagnoses made in genitourinary medicine clinics reported on form KC 60, and information collected through National Enhanced Syphilis Surveillance (NESS). Multinomial regression modelling was used for data analysis. Results Between 1999 and 2008, 12 ? 021 NESS reports were received, 54 % of KC 60 reports. The dominant profile of the epidemic was one of white {{men who have sex}} with men aged 35 – 44, often co-infected with HIV, centred in larger cities. During this period, the proportion of primary cases increased over time, while the proportion of <b>secondary</b> cases <b>fell.</b> Primary cases exceeded secondary cases by 2004. The proportion of early latent cases remained relatively stable over time and tended to be lower than that of primary and secondary infection. Patients who attended because they had symptoms of infection, had been identified through partner notification, were HIV positive, and were UK born were more likely to present with primary or secondary infection than with early latent infection. A higher proportion of early latent cases were seen among patients who were Asian, had contacted sexual partners through saunas, bars and the internet, had untraceable partners, and had acquired infection in Manchester.

Complete cardiopulmonary profiles were obtained in a subset of 28 consecutive cases. During the anhepatic phase while on bypass, mean arterial pressure, central venous pressure, and pulmonary arterial wedge pressure were maintained at prehepatectomy levels. Oxygen consumption <b>fell</b> <b>secondary</b> to a decrease in temperature and the removal of the liver. Consequently, cardiac index fell without an increase in arterial-venous O 2 content difference, reflecting adequate tissue oxygenation. Compared with 63 patients in a previous series given LT without bypass (NBP), the 57 total BP patients experienced better postoperative renal function (p < 0. 001), required less blood use during surgery (p < 0. 01), and had better survival 30 days after LT. The equivalency of 90 -day survival in these groups results from the lack of effect of BP on the long-term survival of patients considered at high risk for metabolic reasons.

Between 1990 and 2010, the proportion of the labor force in the region with at least secondary education increased from 40 to 60 percent. Concurrently, returns to <b>secondary</b> education completion <b>fell</b> throughout the past two decades, while the 2000 s saw a reversal in the increase in the returns to tertiary education experienced in the 1990 s. This paper studies the evolution of wage differentials and the trends in the supply of workers by educational level for 16 Latin American countries between 1990 and 2000. The analysis estimates the relative contribution of supply and demand factors behind recent trends in skill premia for tertiary and secondary educated workers. Supplyside factors seem to have limited explanatory power relative to demandside factors, and are only relevant to explain part of the fall in wage premia for highschool graduates. Although there is significant heterogeneity in individual country experiences, on average the trend reversal in labor demand in the 2000 s can be partially attributed to the recent boom in commodity prices that could favor the unskilled (nontertiary educated) workforce, although employment patterns by sector suggest that other withinsector forces are also at play, such as technological diffusion or skill mismatches that may reduce the labor productivity o...|$|R

The {{results show that the}} rates of return have in general declined by one percentage point on average between the periods as shown in Table[*] 2. If we, however, look at the averages for the different school cycles, the fall in the average rates is quite significant at about six percentage points between the periods. The biggest fall is for secondary education, especially upper <b>secondary</b> education, which <b>fell</b> by 28 percentage points between the periods.

40|$|Student {{veterans}} in undergraduate post-secondary education face many challenges. Current research addresses these unique challenges and offers recommendations for further research, {{as well as}} strategies for college administrators and faculty seeking to assist student veterans. However, the research {{does not address the}} strategies student veterans use to succeed. The purpose of this grounded theory study is to start this conversation. The objective {{of this study is to}} present a theory that predicts and explains student veterans’ success, using grounded theory methodology to examine student veteran strategies to succeed in college. Thirteen student veterans from two different colleges participated in the study via semi-structured interviews and theoretical sampling. The data from the interviews and sampling sessions were coded using in-vivo and axial coding techniques until theoretical categories emerged. Study results showed that student veterans succeeded because they were adaptable and empathetic, and could prioritize their efforts based on goal setting, both on and off campus. Successful student veterans put more effort into their life outside of college, and tended to be internally motivated to succeed. Academic excellence and college degrees were <b>secondary</b> motivators, and <b>fell</b> behind broader-based life goals.

40|$|In {{the next}} few decades, {{communities}} across theUnited States will have to accommodate sub-stantial increases in student enrollment. Theexpected boom in school construction and ren-ovation and the related planning decisions have implications for travel and for vehicle emissions. The study reported here {{was the first to}} examine the relationship between school location, the built environment around schools, student travel to school, and the emissions impacts of this travel. Students with shorter walk and bike times to school proved signifi-cantly more likely to walk or bike—which argues for neighborhood schools. Students who have access to sidewalks along main roads were also more likely to walk—which argues for improvements in sidewalk networks. Neighborhood schools that can be reached by walking and biking can increase the amount of walk-ing and biking to school, can shorten trip distances, and can reduce motor vehicle emissions significantly. Size and Location Trends Public schools have been increasing in size and draw-ing students from larger areas. Between 1940 and 1990, the total number of elementary and <b>secondary</b> public schools <b>fell</b> by 69 percent, despite a 70 percent increase in the U. S. population (1). Large new schools typically are placed in outlying areas, because sites are available and land prices are low. Public policies have contributed to this trend (2 – 4). The funding formulas in many states favor new school construction over renovation. Minimum acreage stan-dards for elementary, middle, and high schools may be met only at greenfield locations. Building codes designed for new construction are applied to older schools that could be renovated. School districts are often exempt from local planning and zoning laws and can site schools without consideration of local policies and plans.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the evolutionary process of monetization in Northumbria. It {{shows how the}} uses and functions of coinage grew as the face-value of coins fell. Part One {{describes the}} numismatic and historical background to the phases of Northumbrian coinage. A new and significant interpretation of the York gold shilling is given, but analysis of sceats largely follows conventional lines. The focus is the introduction and growth of the copper-alloy styca. Research into stycas was confounded by Pirie’s taxonomy, in her otherwise commendable Coins of the Kingdom of Northumbria. The digitization of Pirie’s catalogue, discussed in Part Two, removes this impediment to research. The database is augmented by information relating to c. 8000 coins from online and informal sources. A new periodization has been created and statistical tools developed for analysing and comparing individual sites within regions. Case studies in the economically active regions of Northumbria are supported by descriptions of finds of coins in association with artefacts, assessed on a parish basis. A numerical synthesis of coin- and artefact-rich locations facilitates comparisons between regions by the creation of statistical devices including the coefficient of monetization (the ratio of locations with both coins and portable artefacts to those with only the latter), measures of coin mix and comparisons with finds distributions. The primary conclusion is that Northumbria benefitted increasingly, both monetarily and fiscally, as the face-value of coins <b>fell.</b> <b>Secondary</b> conclusions include a strong episcopal presence in York exemplified by Paulinus’s gold shillings {{at the forefront of}} English monetization; Northumbrian coin production was erratic; the Yorkshire Wolds were more highly monetized than the surrounding lowlands indicating a more enterprising culture; styca hoards represent episcopal expropriations and there were significant changes in settlement and economy in the central lowlands. This thesis demonstrates that monetization reflected northern independence, innovation and enterprise. ...|$|R

DESIGN [...] Follow up study with data collected from contact sheets completed by general practitioners in one period before (March 1987) a change in their remuneration system and two periods after (March 1988, November 1988), with a control group of general practitioners with a mixed fee per item and capitation based system throughout. SETTING [...] General practices in Copenhagen city (index group) and Copenhagen county (control group). SUBJECTS [...] 265 General practitioners in Copenhagen city, of whom 100 were selected randomly from the 130 who agreed to participate (10 exclusions) and 326 general practitioners in Copenhagen county. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Number of consultations (face to face and by telephone) and renewals of prescriptions, diagnostic and curative services, and specialist and hospital referrals per 1000 enlisted patients in one week. RESULTS [...] Of the 75 general practitioners who completed all three sheets, four were excluded for incomplete data. Total contact rates per 1000 patients listed rose significantly compared with the rates before the change index in the city (100. 0 before the change v 111. 7 (95 % confidence interval 106. 4 to 117. 4 after the change) and over the same time in the control group (100. 0 v 106. 0), but within a year these rates fell (to 104. 2 (99. 1 to 109. 6) and 104. 0 respectively). There was an increase in consultations by telephone initially but not thereafter. Rates of examinations and treatments that attracted specific additional remuneration after the change rose significantly compared with those before (diagnostic services, 138. 1 (118. 7 to 160. 5) and 159. 5 (137. 8 to 184. 7) and curative services 194. 6 (152. 2 to 248. 9) and 194. 8 (152. 3 to 249. 2) for second and third data collections respectively) and with the control group (diagnostic services 105. 3, 107. 6 and curative services 106. 0, 115. 0) whereas referral rates to <b>secondary</b> care <b>fell</b> (specialist referrals 90. 1 (80. 7 to 100. 6) and 77. 0 (68. 6 to 86. 4) and hospital referrals 87. 4 (71. 1 to 107. 5) and 68. 4 (54. 7 to 85. 4] in doctors in the city. CONCLUSIONS [...] Introducing a partial fee for service system seemed to stimulate the provision of services by general practitioners, resulting in reduced referral rates. The concept of a "target income" which doctors aim at, rather than maximising their income seemed to play a part in adjustment to changing the system of remuneration. (aut. ref. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{makes the}} case for managed {{expansion}} of secondary schooling in Sub-Saharan Africa. The great majority of secondary age African children remain excluded from access to good quality secondary schooling. Increasing numbers are graduating from primary schools where enrolments are rapidly growing {{as a result of}} successful Education for All programmes. The knowledge and skill that secondary schools can provide is central to closing the gap between Sub Saharan Africa {{and the rest of the}} world in the capabilities in the labour force that can sustain growth. The analyses undertaken for the Secondary Education in Africa (SEIA) programme of the World Bank have explored many dimensions of the challenges ahead. This paper complements this work and offers new insights into necessary reforms of policy and practice. It outlines the current status and structure of secondary provision, and the demographic issues that will influence expanded access. It then elaborates some of the key issues facing governments and development partners, and reviews the resources that would be needed to reach different levels of participation. It offers a set of policy options and strategies that can be used to shape managed growth within sustainable financial frameworks. The analysis indicates that budget shares between educational levels and overall spending on secondary education need to be revisited if higher participation is to be achieved. More than 3. 0 % of gross national product (GNP) would be needed to achieve gross enrolment rates of 60 % at lower secondary and 30 % at upper secondary in low enrolment countries with existing cost structures. The costs per pupil have to fall if expanded access is to be sustainable. No countries with ratios of secondary to primary unit costs of more than 3 : 1 succeed in universalising access to secondary schooling but many countries remain above these levels. New balances will have to struck between rates of expansion towards enrolment targets at primary, lower and upper secondary levels. Structural changes are needed that can facilitate higher secondary enrolment rates at affordable costs and diminish gender inequities. Better management of the flow of pupils could increase completion rates and lower costs per successful completer. Improved teacher deployment will be critical to successful expansion. Much more access could be provided if norms for pupil-teacher ratios (e. g. 35 : 1 at lower secondary, and 25 : 1 at upper secondary) could be applied and if class teacher ratios at <b>secondary</b> level <b>fell</b> from 3 : 1 to less than 2 : 1. Trained teachers will be critical to secondary expansion. Where demand is greatest, and initial training lengthy and expensive, alternative methods will have to be considered which lower costs of training and increase supply. So also will be changes in school management that can provide some incentives to manage human and physical resources efficiently. Secondary expansion without curriculum reform risks irrelevance and wastage. New populations of school children require curricula that address their needs, respond to changing social and economic circumstances, and recognise resource constraints. Alongside this physical capacity needs planned expansion in ways that optimise increased access. Expanded secondary access will benefit greatly from successful mechanisms to generate support from the communities that schools serve. There are many possible methods of cost-sharing and cost-recovery that can and should be facilitated. These need to be linked to the capacity of households to support fees and contributions so that they do not become exclusionary. Partnerships with non-government providers can make some contribution to expanded access. However, they are most likely to play a complementary role since they are unlikely to be the providers of last resort to those otherwise excluded by location, household income, or low achievement...|$|R
40|$|There is {{empirical}} research and scholarly debate {{about what constitutes}} effective learning. Students have offered perspectives on describing good teaching, which mainly focuses on teachers' interpersonal qualities and subject expertise. Teachers {{want to make a}} difference to students' lives, yet little research has been conducted to determine science teaching practices that may have an impact on students' lives. This qualitative study analyses responses from 167 adults (preservice teachers; 26 % males and 74 % females) aged between 19 and 51 about their memories of positive and negative secondary science education experiences, and high-impact science lessons that had an influence on them. Apart from obtaining demographic information, the questionnaire requested these adults to reflect on their secondary science education experiences, for example: (1) As a secondary student, was secondary school science a positive experience? Why or why not? (2) State one secondary science experience and the effect this had on you. Results indicated 52 adults claimed science as a positive experience, 56 deemed science to be a negative experience, and 59 were split in their decisions (stating both positive and negative experiences). All responses on making a difference in <b>secondary</b> science experiences <b>fell</b> within nine categories, that is: teacher's role, hands-on experiences, group work, useful and practical science, purposes articulated clearly, interactivity with life, clear explanations of abstract concepts, involvement in field work, and the topic selection choice. Some adults responded with more than one practice (e. g., group work and excursions). The most controversial science activity in the secondary school was the dissection of a small animal (e. g., toad, frog, rat) or parts of a larger animal (e. g., cow's heart, bull's eye). This act had an impact on these adults, as they remembered distinctly dissecting a creature. The feelings were divided between disgust and repulsion to delight and enlightenment. There were those who objectively dissected a creature and those who found the experience indelibly sickening. To illustrate one participant said, "Cutting a toad up made me leave the room and made me sick, I couldn't see the point, why not work with diagrams?" Low or negative impact practices involved: disengaging activities such as sensory-repulsive tasks, unclear reasons for learning science, teacher's lack of enthusiasm, chalk and talk or copying teacher's work, and denigrating students' personal ideas. Although teaching approaches can vary between different educational levels, and an individual's preferred learning style may change with age and experience, high-impact teaching practices noted in this study were predominantly student-centred or could be adapted to suit individual styles. Indeed, exemplary primary, secondary and tertiary teaching practices may be interchangeable and relevant to effective teaching practices regardless of the level of study. Implementing science lessons with one or more elements of high-impact teaching may lead towards making a difference, particularly if these teaching practices produce in students positive long-term memories about their science education...|$|R
40|$|Japanese {{housing starts}} reached {{a high of}} 1. 64 million in 1996 as homeowners rushed to beat the {{consumption}} tax increase scheduled for 1997. The Asian economic downturn and various other factors caused housing starts to fall to 1. 2 million in 1998. The decline in housing starts, {{in conjunction with a}} Japanese recession, contributed to a dramatic decrease in imports of wooden building materials. Japan, the most important export destination for PNW solid wood products, accounts for almost 31 % of PNW exports. During the economic downturn, Japanese imports of PNW primary wood products fell 30 %, to $ 670 million in 1998 while exports of <b>secondary</b> wood products <b>fell</b> 36 %, to less than $ 100 million. Events that occurred before and during the recession have caused structural changes in the flow of wood products to Japan. During the downturn, the Japanese yen weakened against the US and Canadian dollar, effectively raising the price of US wood products in Japan. The consumption tax rate increase, strong US dollar, and the extended economic recession combined to heighten price sensitivity among Japanese consumers. These factors combined to reduce the competitiveness of US wood products in the Japanese market. The majority of firms engaged in exporting wooden building materials to Japan were affected by the Japanese recession. While most firms reported a decline in export revenues from Japan, some firms experienced increases in their exports to Japan. This anomaly prompted an investigation into why some firms were successful in increasing their exports while other firms were not. The objectives of this study were to document the perceptions of PNW exporters and manufacturers on the importance of services offered to Japanese customer, to discover the key characteristics of successful exporters and to identify the impact of the marketing mix on export performance. A mail and fax survey was designed to elicit specific information on the demographic and operational characteristics of exporting firms in the Pacific Northwest. The survey population included firms that exported or manufactured and exported wooden building materials to Japan. The survey was administered by fax with follow up faxes and letters. Of the 163 US and 71 Canadian firms, 44 US (27 %) and 15 Canadian (21 %) firms were judged to have gone out of business. Out of 173 viable firms, 72 returned completed surveys for a response rate of 41. 6 %. US firms returned 41 surveys from a population of 119 for a return rate of 34. 5 %; while 31 of the 54 Canadian firms returned surveys for a response rate of 57. 4 %. An open-ended question prompted the respondents to identify the factor that had the greatest impact (positive or negative) on their business in Japan. The most frequently mentioned factors were the Japanese recession and the strong US dollar, while marketing factors, such as distribution and services were mentioned less frequently. The survey data suggests that shorter channels were used more often than the traditional Japanese multi-layered channel. On average, 58 % of the respondents export sales went directly to Japanese homebuilders, while an additional 7 % went through a company sales office. Other distribution channels included Japanese distributors, Japanese wholesalers and other trade intermediaries. Respondents perceived a significant advantage to having a sales office and sales/technical representatives in Japan. They also perceived a significant advantage to using a Japanese distributor to take control of product distribution. Overall, the survey data suggests that distribution channels for wooden building materials to Japan are becoming shorter. Softwood lumber was the most commonly exported product (22 %), followed by wooden doors (17 %) and wooden windows (16 %). The remaining products exported included prefabricated housing components (10 %), structural panels (8 %), cabinets (8 %), and glulam beams (3 %), while other products accounted for 16 % of the export mix. Survey respondents were asked several questions related to the importance of the offering specific services to their Japanese customers. In general, the importance of providing these services was perceived to be significantly more important by the firms that provide them relative to the firms that do not provide them. The services included in the survey were: warehousing spare parts in Japan, offering a product warranty, providing translated product information, providing translated installation instructions and providing translated maintenance instructions. Of 68 respondents, 53 % reported that they provided translated product information, 46 % provided translated installation instructions, and 36 % supply translated maintenance instructions. An analysis of the data suggests that as the product becomes more technically complex, there is a lower likelihood that the exporter will provide translated technical information. Nearly all of the survey respondents reported that their Japanese customers had become more price sensitive. Most firms reported that this increased price sensitivity had a negative impact on their export performance. However, a small set of respondents indicated that their exports to Japan increased despite the increased price sensitivity of their Japanese customers. A comparison of US and Canadian firms revealed some basic differences in the products and distribution channels used to service the Japanese market. Canadian firms shipped 71 % of their total exports to Japan, while the US only shipped 53 %, a significant difference. Canadian firms also tended to ship a larger volume of primary wood products through shorter channels than their US counterparts. US firms were more likely to ship value-added products through longer distribution channels. Finally, Canadian firms were more likely to know the segment of the residential construction industry in which their products were used. The distribution channel and product mix of firms that successfully exported to Japan during the Asian downturn differs greatly from the unsuccessful exporters. The firms that did well had export product mixes containing high amounts of wooden prefabricated building components and other value added products. Unsuccessful exporters tended to focus more on lumber, structural panels and doors. Successful exporters tended to report a higher use of short distribution channels, often exporting directly to the homebuilder or to a company sales office. Finally, successful exporters tended to supply a higher percentage of their products to post and beam builders and into other (non 2 x 4) segments of the construction industry. Market knowledge appeared to {{play a vital role in}} export success as unsuccessful firms were over three times more likely not to know how their products were used. This lack of market knowledge makes offering after market sales support difficult and successful promotion within those market segments almost impossible. This research suggests that the firms that were successful during the downturn exported more than twice the amount of products into other market segments (primarily post and beam, prefabricated homes and log homes) than did unsuccessful firms. These segments of the housing market may be less sensitive to changes in the overall economic conditions than are the larger post and beam and 2 x 4 housing segments. Analysis of total sales by export success reveals some interesting patterns. The medium-sized firms (export sales revenues between $ 1 million and $ 5 million) appear to have done much better than both small firms (export sales revenues less than $ 1 million) and large firms (export sales revenues above $ 5 million) (Figure 5. 5. 7). It is interesting to note that a much higher percentage of the medium-sized firms reported an increase in export revenues. Fully two-thirds of the companies who reported an increase in export revenues were medium-sized firms. In contrast, the firms who reported a decline in export revenues were fairly evenly distributed, although almost forty percent of these firms were large firms while just 13 % of the successful firms were large companies. As mentioned previously, exports tend to be a much higher percentage of the total sales revenue of the small- and medium-sized firms in contrast to the larger firms who tend to have a heavy focus on the domestic market with exports rarely comprising more than 10 % of their total sales. Thus, we might conclude that the medium-sized firms are more committed to the export market and have developed a marketing strategy that provides them with a greater chance of succeeding in Japan even when the markets are poor. While smaller firms are also more focused on their export markets it would appear that they do not have the financial and marketing resources to withstand a significant decline in the export market, as indicated by the fact that 83. 3 % of the small firms reported declines in export sales revenues in Japan. A factor analysis reduced the larger number of eleven marketing factors into just three factors. The average importance ratings for each factor clearly show that not all of the factors were perceived to be equally important in marketing wood products in Japan. The factor with the highest average importance rating was “Providing translated product information to Japanese customers” which received an average importance rating of 5. 52. The second factor, “Providing customized in-country services”, was considered to be somewhat important with an average importance rating of 3. 94. The third factor related to the use of specific distribution strategies in Japan, was perceived to be the least important of the three factors with an average importance rating of 3. 42. This study has documented structural changes in the trade of PNW wooden building materials with Japan. It has also provided quantitative and qualitative insights into the impacts of the Asian downturn on the performance of exporters in the PNW. The Asian downturn may have served to accelerate the changes occurring in the distribution channels, product mix, and services offered to the Japanese housing market. Changes in the demands of the Japanese consumers have opened new areas and created new opportunities for firms to develop or increase their competitiveness. These changes include shortening the distribution channel and shifting the export mix to include more value-added products. Also, providing more after-sales support, primarily translated product information was also perceived to be important. While some of these strategies may not be suitable for all firms, exporters should realize the need for increasing their competitiveness in the expanding global economy...|$|R
