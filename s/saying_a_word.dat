5|$|Following Christiane's funeral, Dr. Génessier and his {{assistant}} Louise, {{the woman who had}} disposed of the dead body earlier, return home where the real Christiane is hidden (it is explained that Louise is deathlessly loyal to Génessier because he repaired her own badly damaged face, leaving only a barely noticeable scar she covers with a pearl choker). The body belonged to a young woman who died following Dr. Génessier's unsuccessful attempt to graft her face onto his daughter's. Dr. Génessier promises to restore Christiane's face and insists that she wear a mask to cover her disfigurement. After her father leaves the room, Christiane calls her fiancé Jacques Vernon, who works with Dr. Génessier at his clinic, but hangs up without <b>saying</b> <b>a</b> <b>word.</b>|$|E

An ambulance was summoned, although it was soon apparent Dillinger had died from the gunshot wounds; he was officially pronounced dead at Alexian Brothers Hospital.

25|$|Catherine's {{family history}} is delved into {{in this first}} season, as her mother's unsolved murder has preyed on her mind for nine years. Catherine {{witnessed}} her mother {{shot and killed by}} two hitmen who were then killed by Vincent. Catherine refused to believe the official police report that her mother's death was that of carjacking gone wrong since the men who killed her mother suddenly appeared and began shooting without <b>saying</b> <b>a</b> <b>word,</b> as well as that the two dead killers identities were never found in any police record, leading Catherine to believe that her mother's killing was that of a government conspiracy. It was later revealed that Catherine's mother worked for Muirfield, conducting the experiments, and ultimately helped turn Vincent into a beast. Catherine must deal with conflicted feelings of her mother's memory across this season, having been determined to solve her case for all this time. When Catherine watches her father get run over in the season finale, she then learns that, biologically, he was not her real father after all.|$|E
500|$|Drake {{delivered}} the tapes of Pink Moon to Chris Blackwell at Island Records, contrary {{to a popular}} legend which claims he dropped them off at the receptionist's desk without <b>saying</b> <b>a</b> <b>word.</b> An advertisement for the album in Melody Maker in February opened with [...] "Pink Moon—Nick Drake's latest album: the first we heard of it was when it was finished." [...] Pink Moon sold fewer copies than either of its predecessors, although it received some favourable reviews. In Zigzag magazine, Connor McKnight wrote, [...] "Nick Drake is an artist who never fakes. The album makes no concession to the theory that music should be escapist. It's simply one musician's view of life at the time, and you can't ask for more than that." ...|$|E
500|$|Billingsley's {{hospitality}} with food, drink, {{and gifts}} overcame the structural deficits {{to keep his}} patrons returning time after time. He maintained order {{through a series of}} hand signals; without <b>saying</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> he could order complimentary drinks and gifts for a party at any given table. Billingsley was also able to summon the club's private limousine to whisk favored customers away to a theater date or a ballgame after drinks or dining at the Stork. He changed the meaning of the hand signals frequently to avoid regular patrons' being able to read them. [...] Guests dined on the finest wines and cuisine, and it was known for its Champagne and caviar. The club gained worldwide attention for its cocktails, made by chief barman Nathaniel [...] "Cookie" [...] Cook.|$|E

500|$|The song {{became so}} {{identified}} with Emmett and the Virginia Minstrels {{that it became}} part of their foundation myth. Billy Whitlock and George B. Wooldridge both claimed that the troupe members played [...] "Old Dan Tucker" [...] in their first impromptu performance together:[...] [...] as if by accident, each one picked up his tools and joined in a chorus of [...] "Old Dan Tucker," [...] while Emmett was playing and singing. It went well, and they repeated it without <b>saying</b> <b>a</b> <b>word.</b> Each did his best, and such a rattling of the principal and original instruments in a minstrel band was never heard before. Emmett repeated this story in the May 19, 1877, New York Clipper, although other details changed. The press began to refer to Emmett as [...] "Ole Dan Tucker", and Emmett eventually adopted the nickname. The Virginia Minstrels sometimes went by [...] "Ole Dan Tucker and Co." [...] They were called [...] "Old Dan Tucker & Co.," [...] either by themselves or by the press, as early as February 16, 1843.|$|E
500|$|In November 1972, {{the group}} {{arranged}} a showcase with Don Ellis, the Epic Records executive who earlier had rejected Wicked Lester's album. While one Epic executive, Tom Werman, {{was impressed by}} the power and theatrics of this new incarnation of Wicked Lester, Ellis once again turned them down. As Ellis was leaving, Peter Criss's brother, who was drunk, vomited on his foot. In early December, Paul Stanley placed an ad in The Village Voice stating, [...] "LEAD GUITARIST WANTED with Flash and Ability. Album Out Shortly. No time wasters please." [...] The ad ran for two issues, December 7 and December 14, 1972, leading to several audition sessions. One audition was by Paul [...] "Ace" [...] Frehley who showed up wearing different-colored shoes, walked into the room without <b>saying</b> <b>a</b> <b>word,</b> hooked up his guitar and started playing. Frehley was asked back for a second audition and {{was a member of the}} band by Christmas 1972. Within a few weeks, the group changed its name to Kiss and played their first concert on January 30, 1973.|$|E
500|$|According to Greno and Howard, the {{decision}} to make Pascal and Maximus non-speaking characters has been appreciated by both critics and audiences alike, explaining, [...] "We've gotten so many compliments about him and Pascal ... {{and so many people}} saying: 'Thank you for not making them talk.'" [...] Hailing Pascal and Maximus as [...] "delightful supporting characters who continue yet another Disney custom without <b>saying</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> of dialogue", Leonard Martin of Indiewire compared Pascal to a [...] "comic Greek chorus" [...] while dubbing Maximus [...] "an extraordinarily expressive equine adversary ... who earns many of the movie's biggest laughs. Similarly, The Wall Street Journals Joe Morgenstern wrote, [...] "No one voices Maximus ... but he steals every scene he's in", while calling Pascal [...] "endearing". The Quad-City Times Linda Cook reviewed, [...] "it's fun to watch the animal sidekicks express themselves, not through words, but facial expressions and body movements. The critters provide much of the comedy", while Steve Persall of the Tampa Bay Times penned, [...] "No talking animals here, although when they're as amusing as a loyal chameleon and a horse who's partly bloodhound and cop-flick action hero, they don't need to speak", joking that the Brothers Grimm [...] "probably wouldn't object." [...] ABC Online [...] "like the way the animals were used", explaining, [...] "They don't talk ... it really is funny", accrediting this to executive producer John Lasseter's influence on the film. Criticizing the script's [...] "abundant chatter," [...] Justin Chang of Variety commended the filmmaker's [...] "shrewd decision to have the animal sidekicks ... express themselves without the benefit of speech." [...] Similarly, Richard Corliss of Time wrote that both characters [...] "radiate plenty of personality without speaking." ...|$|E

Muransky later recalled: [...] "Bubba Paris and I were two happy freshmen eating {{together at the}} Lawry's Beef Bowl event before the 1979 Rose Bowl Game. After we had enjoyed our fourth plate of prime rib, mashed potatoes, corn and Yorkshire pudding, Bubba asked what the record was, and they said 7 cuts. Bubba continued for 3 more cuts, and I continued for four, totally under the Bo Schembechler radar screen. When they delivered the 8th cut to me, the media started to gather around my table, Bo walked by {{and let me know}} what he was thinking without ever <b>saying</b> <b>a</b> <b>word.</b> Afterward, a Paris-Muransky night out ended with some pizza. The next morning in practice, Bo made an example of Bubba and me. We never ran so much in our lives as we did that day. We were in every play of scrimmage and then we ran sprints." [...] When the Wolverines returned to Pasadena for the 1981 Rose Bowl, [...] "Bo {{made it a point to}} come to the back of the plane and talk to me and Bubba Paris. He wanted to let us know that my record from a couple years earlier would not be in jeopardy because we were going to be sitting with him at the Lawry's Beef Bowl. He said he was going to limit each of us to two cuts of prime rib." [...] Schembechler had his own take on the story: [...] "I let 'em eat because they were freshmen. They weren't gonna play anyway." ...|$|E
