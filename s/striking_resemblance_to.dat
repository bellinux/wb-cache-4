5|$|Although van der Weyden did not {{adhere to}} the {{conventions}} of idealisation, he generally sought to flatter his sitters. He depicted his models in highly fashionable clothing, often with rounded—almost sculpted—facial features, some of which deviated from natural representation. He adapted his own aesthetic, and his portraits of women often bear a <b>striking</b> <b>resemblance</b> <b>to</b> each other.|$|E
5|$|Gumbo z'herbes {{may have}} {{originated}} with the French, Germans, or West Africans. It has similarities to the French dish potage aux herbes ("soup with greens"), {{as well as}} to the African callaloo. The meatless dish also bears <b>striking</b> <b>resemblance</b> <b>to</b> a dish often eaten in Germany on Maundy Thursday. German Catholics, obeying the Lenten rules, often served a stew made of seven different greens on this date.|$|E
5|$|The {{issue of}} piracy cropped up when a news article {{published}} in The Indian Express exposed {{the dark side of}} the film market. Hardly into weeks of the film's release, CDs were being sold at as low as Rs. 40. Another blemish was that Soumitra Dasgupta, a writer and close associate of Sarkar alleged that the film's story had a <b>striking</b> <b>resemblance</b> <b>to</b> his parallel work on the novella.|$|E

5000|$|Kathleen Parker {{noted in}} 2008 that a recent New Yorker profile of Roger Stone by Jeffrey Toobin bore <b>striking</b> <b>resemblances</b> <b>to</b> a recent piece about Stone by Labash. In Parker's view, “any casual {{reading of the}} two {{suggests}} that Toobin owed Labash at least a hat tip.” ...|$|R
50|$|Clarence Potter, {{along with}} Tom Colleton, is an {{analogue}} of the Wehrmacht officers who despised Hitler but faithfully served Germany. Potter in particular {{appears to be}} based on Wilhelm Canaris, but his role in the failed attempt on Jake Featherston's life bears <b>striking</b> <b>resemblances</b> <b>to</b> Erwin Rommel's role in the July 20 Plot.|$|R
5|$|The party discovers a Somnia Castle in the “Phantom World” and {{learns that}} the prince is missing {{and that the}} Hero looks like him. They also meet Captain Rusty, who bears a <b>striking</b> <b>resemblance</b> <b>to</b> Captain Blade. Gaining {{entrance}} to the Moonmirror Tower, the party meets Ashlynn, {{a woman who was}} invisible in the “Phantom World” at first, too, and together they find the Mirror of Ra.|$|E
5|$|It {{has also}} been noted that the plot of Cars bears a <b>striking</b> <b>resemblance</b> <b>to</b> that of Doc Hollywood, the 1991 romantic comedy which stars Michael J. Fox as a hotshot young doctor, who, after causing a traffic {{accident}} in a small town, is sentenced {{to work at the}} town hospital, {{falls in love with a}} local law student and eventually acquires an appreciation for small town values. Some have gone so far as to say that the makers of Cars plagiarized the script of Doc Hollywood.|$|E
5|$|The Tempest {{may take}} its overall {{structure}} from traditional Italian commedia dell'arte, which sometimes featured a magus and his daughter, their supernatural attendants, {{and a number}} of rustics. The commedia often featured a clown known as Arlecchino (or his predecessor, Zanni) and his partner Brighella, who bear a <b>striking</b> <b>resemblance</b> <b>to</b> Stephano and Trinculo; a lecherous Neapolitan hunchback who corresponds to Caliban; and the clever and beautiful Isabella, whose wealthy and manipulative father, Pantalone, constantly seeks a suitor for her, thus mirroring the relationship between Miranda and Prospero.|$|E

5000|$|The {{music video}} for this song was {{directed}} by Sophie Muller, and it features the band playing in a small, secluded room with loud amplifiers behind them. During the choruses, {{the volume of the}} song sends the band members crashing against the walls and ground. This video bears <b>striking</b> <b>resemblances</b> <b>to</b> Blur's video for [...] "Popscene".|$|R
40|$|The Mariner 10 {{encounter}} of Mercury provided data {{showing a}} stron {{interaction between the}} solar wind and the planet similar to a scaled down version of that producing the earth's magnetosphere. Some of the features observed in Mercury's night side magnetosphere suggest time-dependent processes occurring there. Interpreted as temporal events, these features bear <b>striking</b> <b>resemblances</b> <b>to</b> substorm phenomena in the earth's magnetosphere...|$|R
5|$|Archaeological {{investigations}} conducted unearthed square or circular Chera coins made {{of copper}} from near Cochin. This {{was for the}} first time, from a stratographic context, coins of Sangam Chera period {{have been found in}} Kerala. The coin, which is almost a square in shape, has an elephant facing to the right and some symbols towards the top of the coin. The symbols could not be identified as {{the upper part of the}} coin was partially corroded. A drawn bow and arrow was visible on the other side. Below the arrow is an elephant goad (a prod used to control elephants). These coins bear a <b>striking</b> <b>resemblance</b> <b>to</b> the ones excavated from Karur in Tamil Nadu, said the archaeologists.|$|E
5|$|As Ko and Aoba {{enter their}} summer break, {{a girl named}} Akane Takigawa with a <b>striking</b> <b>resemblance</b> <b>to</b> Wakaba moves in next door to Ko. This causes mixed {{feelings}} among the various characters, particularly Ko, Aoba, and Akaishi (who had also liked Wakaba). Akane soon becomes friends with Ko and Tsukishimas, and begins working in the Tsukishima cafe. As another year begins, the romantic subplots further solidify when Yūhei expresses an interest in Aoba. Meanwhile, Seishu gains a new assistant coach {{in the form of}} Yūhei's older brother Junpei, after Ichiyo agrees to marry him if Seishu makes it to Koshien.|$|E
5|$|Cross-linguistically, the-ma suffix may {{be related}} to a coverbial suffix in Jaminjung, a {{language}} in which coverb roots occur without any aspect markers, but are then suffixed with -mayan, which marks continuous aspect. This coverb suffix bears a <b>striking</b> <b>resemblance</b> <b>to</b> the sum of the Wagiman -ma suffix and the continuous aspect suffix -yan, which always occur in tandem on coverbs. Together, -ma and -yan perform the same semantic function as Jaminjung -mayan. Precisely what the relationship holds between these suffixes; whether one language borrowed from the other, or whether each language inherited them from earlier languages, is not at all clear.|$|E
50|$|The {{style of}} {{handwriting}} of this codex bears a <b>striking</b> general <b>resemblance</b> <b>to</b> that of three Gospel manuscripts of the 10th and 11th centuries: Codex Cyprius, Lectionary 296, and ℓ 1599.|$|R

50|$|Ridiearl (Ridiēru) is the {{commander}} of the paladin army that led the human invasion of Hell. She has a zealous hatred of devils, yet bears a <b>striking</b> physical <b>resemblance</b> <b>to</b> Jenarose, the master of Hell.|$|R
5|$|In 1991 Christiaan Schuckman {{discovered}} {{a set of}} signed plates in Madrid that {{can be attributed to}} the engraver of the First Folio portrait. These plates bear Droeshout's signature and are stylistically similar to his portrait of Shakespeare. (They include a portrait of the priest and writer Franciso de la Peña that has a <b>striking</b> <b>resemblance</b> <b>to</b> the English poet). On the evidence of these plates, which were made between 1635 and 1639, Schuckman attributed the portrait of Shakespeare to the younger Martin and suggested that the engraver had converted to Catholicism and emigrated to Spain in 1635, where he continued to work.|$|E
5|$|Kingdom Hearts II Final Mixs secret ending {{features}} a character named Ventus who bears a strong <b>striking</b> <b>resemblance</b> <b>to</b> him. Nomura commented that, despite their similarities, Roxas and Ventus {{are not the}} same character. He also said that when playing Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep, players will be able to distinguish Roxas from Ventus. In another interview, Nomura implied both characters are related, specifically to Sora, but he wanted fans to imagine reasons for such a connection. For the upcoming game Kingdom Hearts III, there is a possibility of Roxas being revived despite Sora being alive at the same time. Nomura says this will be {{explained by the fact that}} the character Xehanort whose Heartless and Nobody, Ansem and Xemnas, exist at the same time as the original one.|$|E
5|$|The club crest {{has been}} a rampant lion since 1936, which was also {{introduced}} by Charlie Hewitt. There have been many variations of the lion; {{the first was a}} single red lion, often mistakenly said to be chosen because of the club's Scottish roots. The lion bore a <b>striking</b> <b>resemblance</b> <b>to</b> signs used by pubs named The Red Lion. From 1956 to 1974 Millwall's crest was two leaping red lions facing each other. Former chairman Theo Paphitis brought back the badge in 1999, where it was used for a further eight years. The current crest is a leaping lion, which first appeared on a Millwall kit in 1979. It remained until 1999 and was re-introduced again in 2007. The club mascot is a giant lion called Zampa, so named after Zampa Road, the postal address of The Den.|$|E
2500|$|Spinoza {{engaged in}} {{correspondence}} from December 1664 to June 1665 with Willem van Blijenbergh, an amateur Calvinist theologian, who questioned Spinoza on {{the definition of}} evil. Later in 1665, Spinoza notified Oldenburg that he had started {{to work on a}} new book, the Theologico-Political Treatise, published in 1670. Leibniz disagreed harshly with Spinoza in his own manuscript [...] "Refutation of Spinoza," [...] but he is also known to have met with Spinoza on at least one occasion (as mentioned above), and his own work bears some <b>striking</b> <b>resemblances</b> <b>to</b> specific important parts of Spinoza's philosophy (see: Monadology).|$|R
40|$|The {{spatial and}} {{temperature}} {{structures of the}} X-ray emitting components of low-inductance vacuum-spark plasmas are investigated. The plasmas produced by low-inductance vacuum sparks show <b>striking</b> <b>resemblances</b> <b>to</b> solar-flare plasmas. High-resolution photographs show that the spark plasmas are composed of hot (about 30 million K) compact sources (less than 20 microns) and cooler (about 10 million K) larger sources (of the order of 100 microns). Both types of sources may be produced by the same plasma at different times. The differences between the solar flare iron-line spectrum near 1. 9 A and the spark iron-line spectrum are discussed and interpreted...|$|R
40|$|Progressive {{pneumonia}} virus, the causative {{agent of}} a slow, pulmonary disease of Montana sheep, {{was shown to}} be antigenically related to two other slow viruses of sheep, visna and maedi. Electron microscopic examination of infected cells revealed that the virus matures by a budding process and that the budding particles {{as well as the}} mature, extracellular virions bear <b>striking</b> <b>resemblances</b> <b>to</b> the oncogenic ribonucleic acid (RNA) viruses. Recent findings of an RNA-dependent deoxyribonucleic acid polymerase associated with the virions of this group of slow viruses lend further support to the notion that they may tentatively be classified with the oncogenic RNA tumor viruses...|$|R
5|$|Another {{defense that}} often uses color or shape to deceive {{potential}} enemies is mimicry. A number of longhorn beetles (family Cerambycidae) bear a <b>striking</b> <b>resemblance</b> <b>to</b> wasps, which helps them avoid predation {{even though the}} beetles are in fact harmless. Batesian and Müllerian mimicry complexes are commonly found in Lepidoptera. Genetic polymorphism and natural selection give rise to otherwise edible species (the mimic) gaining a survival advantage by resembling inedible species (the model). Such a mimicry complex {{is referred to as}} Batesian and is most commonly known by the mimicry by the limenitidine viceroy butterfly of the inedible danaine monarch. Later research has discovered that the viceroy is, in fact more toxic than the monarch and this resemblance should be considered as a case of Müllerian mimicry. In Müllerian mimicry, inedible species, usually within a taxonomic order, find it advantageous to resemble each other so as to reduce the sampling rate by predators who need to learn about the insects' inedibility. Taxa from the toxic genus Heliconius form one of the most well known Müllerian complexes.|$|E
5|$|Temples {{built in}} and around the Kalyani region (in the Bidar district) were quite {{different}} from those built in other regions. Without exception, the articulation was nagara, and the temple plan as a rule was either stepped-diamond or stellate. The elevations corresponding to these two plans were similar because star shapes were produced by rotating the corner projections of a standard stepped plan in increments of 11.25 degrees, resulting in a 32-pointed interrupted plan in which three star points are skipped in the centre of each side of the shrine. Examples of stepped-diamond plans surviving in Karnataka are the Dattatreya Temple at Chattarki, the Someshvara Temple in Kadlewad, and the Mallikarjuna and Siddhesvara at Kalgi in the Gulbarga district. The nagara shrine at Chattarki is a stepped diamond of projecting corners with five projections per side. Because of the stepped-diamond plan, the wall pillars have two fully exposed sides, with a high base block decorated with a mirrored stalk motif and two large wall images above. The shapes and decorations {{on the rest of the}} wall pillar have a <b>striking</b> <b>resemblance</b> <b>to</b> the actual pillars supporting the ceiling.|$|E

5000|$|In {{his book}} Is Democracy Possible? The {{alternative}} to electoral politics (1985) Burnheim {{used the term}} [...] "demarchy" [...] (created by Friedrich Hayek in his Law, Legislation and Liberty) to describe a political system without the state or bureaucracies, and based instead on randomly selected groups of decision makers. This has <b>striking</b> <b>resemblances</b> <b>to</b> classical democratic ideas, as reported by Thucydides. In 2006 Burnheim published a second edition with a new preface in which he directed the reader to an emphasis that [...] "a polity organised by negotiation between specialised authorities would work much better than one based on centralised authority".|$|R

500|$|Series creator Chris Carter asked Howard Gordon {{to write}} [...] "Død Kalm" [...] because the X-Files {{had been given}} access to a Canadian navy {{destroyer}} for the previous episodes [...] "Colony" [...] and [...] "End Game." [...] The episode was originally intended {{as a way to}} give the production crew a rest after several [...] "demanding" [...] episodes had been shot. Before the script had been finished, Carter mentioned that he believed the episode would be a [...] "great rest for everyone." [...] In the book The Unofficial X-Files Companion, N.E.

The ideas presented in the production bear <b>striking</b> <b>resemblances</b> <b>to</b> di Lorenzo's script writing for Mel Welles' Lady Frankenstein, an 1972 attempt to update the Frankenstein myth by adding issues related to gender, ecology and power/knowledge. (Many themes from this movie were reworked into [...] "Ring Around The Moon" [...] and his subsequent stories for the series [...] "Missing Link" [...] and [...] "Alpha Child".) ...|$|R
