5|$|The {{motion of}} the Moon can be {{measured}} accurately, and is noticeably more complex {{than that of the}} planets. The ancient Greek astronomers, Hipparchus and Ptolemy, had noted several periodic variations in the Moon's orbit, such as small oscillations in its orbital eccentricity and the inclination of its orbit to the plane of the ecliptic. These oscillations generally occur on a once-monthly or twice-monthly time-scale. The line of its apses precesses gradually with a period of roughly 8.85 years, while its line of nodes turns a full circle in roughly double that time, 18.6 years. This accounts for the roughly 18-year periodicity of eclipses, the so-called <b>Saros</b> <b>cycle.</b> However, both lines experience small fluctuations in their motion, again on the monthly time-scale.|$|E
25|$|According to Tony Freeth, in {{an article}} for Scientific American, {{mechanical}} calculation of the <b>saros</b> <b>cycle</b> {{is built into the}} Antikythera mechanism.|$|E
25|$|We find Hipparchus's {{mathematical}} signatures in the Antikythera Mechanism, {{an ancient}} astronomical computer {{of the second}} century BC. The mechanism {{is based on a}} solar year, the Metonic Cycle, which is the period the Moon reappears in the same star in the sky with the same phase (full Moon appears at the same position in the sky approximately in 19 years), the Callipic cycle (which is four Metonic cycles and more accurate), the <b>Saros</b> <b>cycle</b> and the Exeligmos cycles (three Saros cycles for the accurate eclipse prediction). The study of the Antikythera Mechanism proves that the ancients have been using very accurate calendars based on all the aspects of solar and lunar motion in the sky. In fact, the Lunar Mechanism {{which is part of the}} Antikythera Mechanism depicts the motion of the Moon and its phase, for a given time, using a train of four gears with a pin and slot device which gives a variable lunar velocity that is very close to the second law of Kepler, i.e. it takes into account the fast motion of the Moon at perigee and slower motion at apogee. This discovery proves that Hipparchus mathematics were much more advanced than Ptolemy describes in his books, as it is evident that he developed a good approximation of Kepler΄s second law.|$|E
5000|$|The {{number of}} years in three <b>Saros</b> <b>cycles</b> of eclipses {{of the sun and}} moon is known as a Triple Saros or exeligmos (Greek: [...] "turn of the wheel").|$|R
50|$|Eclipses only {{occur in}} the eclipse season, when the Sun is close to either the {{ascending}} or descending node of the Moon. Each eclipse is separated by one, five or six lunations (synodic months), and the midpoint of each season is separated by 173.3 days, which is the mean time for the Sun to travel from one node to the next. The period is {{a little less than}} half a calendar year because the lunar nodes slowly regress. Because 223 synodic months is roughly equal to 239 anomalistic months and 242 draconic months, eclipses with similar geometry recur 223 synodic months (about 6,585.3 days) apart. This period (18 years 11.3 days) is a saros. Because 223 synodic months is not identical to 239 anomalistic months or 242 draconic months, <b>saros</b> <b>cycles</b> do not endlessly repeat. Each cycle begins with the Moon's shadow crossing the earth near the north or south pole, and subsequent events progress toward the other pole until the Moon's shadow misses the earth and the series ends. <b>Saros</b> <b>cycles</b> are numbered; currently, cycles 117 to 156 are active.|$|R

50|$|Contributions {{made by the}} Chaldean astronomers {{during this}} period include the {{discovery}} of eclipse <b>cycles</b> and <b>saros</b> <b>cycles,</b> and many accurate astronomical observations. For example, they observed that the Sun's motion along the ecliptic was not uniform, though they were unaware of why this was; it is today known that {{this is due to}} the Earth moving in an elliptic orbit around the Sun, with the Earth moving swifter when it is nearer to the Sun at perihelion and moving slower when it is farther away at aphelion.|$|R
5000|$|It was {{the first}} of three solar eclipses that took place that year, the next was a total eclipse on July 8, 1842 and covered almost all of the Northern Hemisphere. It was the solar <b>saros</b> 119 <b>cycle</b> of eclipses ...|$|R

2500|$|Earlier Greek {{astronomers and}} mathematicians were {{influenced}} by Babylonian astronomy to some extent, for instance the period relations of the Metonic cycle and <b>Saros</b> <b>cycle</b> {{may have come from}} Babylonian sources (see [...] "Babylonian astronomical diaries"). Hipparchus seems to have been the first to exploit Babylonian astronomical knowledge and techniques systematically. Except for Timocharis and Aristillus, he was the first Greek known to divide the circle in 360 degrees of 60 arc minutes (Eratosthenes before him used a simpler sexagesimal system dividing a circle into 60 parts). He also used the Babylonian unit pechus ("cubit") of about 2° or 2.5°.|$|E
2500|$|The Saros dial is {{the main}} lower spiral dial on {{the rear of the}} mechanism. The <b>Saros</b> <b>cycle</b> is 18 years and [...] days long (6585.333… days), which is very close to 223 synodic months (6585.3211 days). It is defined as the cycle of {{repetition}} of the positions required to cause solar and lunar eclipses, and therefore, it could be used to predict them— not only the month, but the day and time of day. Note that the cycle is approximately 8 hours longer than an integer number of days. Translated into global spin, that means an eclipse occurs not only eight hours later, but one-third of a rotation farther to the west. Glyphs in 51 of the 223 synodic month cells of the dial specify the occurrence of 38 lunar and 27 solar eclipses. Some of the abbreviations in the glyphs read: ...|$|E
2500|$|The saros, {{a period}} of 6585.3211 days (14 common years + 4 leap years + 11.321 days, or 13 common years + 5 leap years + 10.321 days), is useful for {{predicting}} the times at which nearly identical eclipses will occur. Three periodicities related to lunar orbit, the synodic month, the draconic month, and the anomalistic month coincide almost perfectly each <b>saros</b> <b>cycle.</b> For an eclipse to occur, either the Moon must be located between the Earth and Sun (for a solar eclipse) or the Earth must be located between the Sun and Moon (for a lunar eclipse). This can happen only when the Moon is new or full, respectively, and repeat occurrences of these lunar phases result from solar and lunar orbits producing the Moon's synodic period of 29.53059 days. During most full and new moons, however, {{the shadow of the}} Earth or Moon falls to the north or south of the other body. Eclipses occur when the three bodies form a nearly straight line. [...] Because the plane of the lunar orbit is inclined to that of the earth, this condition occurs only when a full or new Moon is near or in the ecliptic plane, that is when the moon is at one of the two nodes (the ascending or descending node). The period of time for two successive lunar passes through the ecliptic plane (returning to the same node) is termed the draconic month, a 27.21222 day period. [...] The three-dimensional geometry of an eclipse, when the new or full moon is near one of the nodes, occurs every 5 or 6 months when the Sun is in conjunction or opposition to the Moon and coincidentally also near a node of the Moon's orbit at that time, or twice per eclipse year. Two Saros eclipses have the same appearance and duration due to the distance between the Earth and Moon being nearly the same for each event because the Saros eclipse cycle is also an integer of the anomalistic month, the period of the eccentricity of lunar orbit, 27.5545 days.|$|E
50|$|The {{length of}} the tritos {{is equal to the}} {{length of the}} inex minus the length of the <b>saros</b> eclipse <b>cycles.</b> Therefore, eclipses that occur 1 tritos apart (i.e. both eclipses belong to the same tritos series), belong to two {{different}} saros series with series numbers that differ by one.|$|R
