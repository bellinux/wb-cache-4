40|$|The {{topic of}} this paper is the design and {{analysis}} of a control strategy for semi-active suspensions in road vehicles. Currently used closed-loop control strategies (like the Sky-Hook damping) require two sensors for each suspension. Typically, two accelerometers or an accelerometer combined with a <b>stroke</b> <b>sensor</b> are used. In this paper a simple but innovative algorithm is proposed, capable of providing quasi-optimal performance using a single accelerometer. The starting point of this work is the Mix-SH-ADD control algorithm, which has been recently developed and proposed. Starting from that idea, the single-sensor algorithm is derived. This algorithm pays a little performance price with respect to the mix SH-ADD algorithm, while guaranteeing cost-reduction and augmented reliability...|$|E

40|$|A downhillbicycle was {{equipped}} with strain gauge bridges at the most significant safety components, <b>stroke</b> <b>sensors</b> at the suspensions and accelerometers at the front axle. A set of 7 channels was applied on the frame, 4 channels were applied to the rear swing arm, 6 channels to the front fork, 2 channels {{to the front and}} rear brakes and a customized load cell was connected to the rear damper. Each channel was calibrated during static laboratory tests and the calibration constants or matrices were used to convert the measured signals into functional loads applied to the components. Tests were performed involving an expert downhill racer on a competition track. The peak values collected during the study would allow for the definition of static overload tests on the bicycle safety components; the time histories collected in the field will allow evaluating the field loads spectra {{to be used in the}} fatigue life prediction of the components and defining the standard fatigue tests to verify the minimum required fatigue strength of the most important components of such an extreme sport discipline...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{clinical}} and experimental studies have highlighted a complex {{role for the}} immune system in the pathophysiological changes that occur after acute <b>stroke.</b> <b>Sensors</b> of the innate immune system such as Toll-like receptors, or effectors such as the lectin pathway of complement activation and innate immune cells, are activated by brain ischaemia and tissue damage, leading to amplification of the inflammatory cascade. Activation of the adaptive arm of the immune system, mediated by lymphocyte populations including T and B cells, regulatory T cells, and 3 T cells, in response to stroke can lead to deleterious antigen-specific autoreactive responses but can also have cytoprotective effects. Increased incidence of infections is observed after acute stroke, and might result from activation of long-distance feedback loops between the CNS and peripheral immune organs, which are thought to {{play a part in}} stroke-induced immunodepression. Ongoing clinical trials are investigating whether the preventive use of antibiotics improves functional outcome after stroke.

40|$|Background/PurposeThe {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effect of motor control from Tai Chi Chuan (TCC) on eye-hand coordination in the elderly. MethodsForty-two elderly people were recruited into this study. People in the TCC group (n = 22) had been practicing TCC regularly for more than 3 years. The control group (n = 20) comprised healthy and active elderly people. Subjects were asked to <b>stroke</b> target <b>sensors</b> in a test device with computer recording. There were three different target sensor sizes (1 cm, 1. 5 cm and 2 cm in diameter) for different tests. For each target stroking, the following were recorded and calculated: start and end positions, duration of movement, pause time, peak velocity, and the time to reach peak velocity. ResultsThe TCC group showed significantly better results in decrease of displacement (p = 0. 003), movement time (p = 0. 002), pause time (p < 0. 001), number of submovements (p = 0. 001), and better skewness coefficients (p < 0. 001) than the control group. However, the difference in the peak velocity of the TCC and control groups did not reach statistical significance (p = 0. 026). ConclusionThe elderly TCC group had better results on the eye-hand coordination test than the control elderly group...|$|R
40|$|Worldwide {{lightning}} location (WWLL) {{using only}} 30 lightning sensors {{has been successfully}} achieved by using only VLF propagation in the Earth-ionosphere waveguide (EIWG). Ground propagation or mixed "sky" and ground propagation is avoided by requiring evidence of Earth-ionosphere waveguide dispersion. A further requirement is that the lightning strike must be inside the perimeter defined by the lightning sensor sites detecting the stroke. Under these conditions, {{the time and the}} location of the stroke can be determined, along with the rms errors. Lightning strokes with errors exceeding 30 mu s or To assist with identifying impulses from the same lightning <b>stroke,</b> the lightning <b>sensor</b> threshold is automatically adjusted to allow an average detection rate of three per second. This largely limits detection to the strongest 4 % of all lightning strokes, of which about 40 % meet the accuracy requirements for time and location...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—A {{fingerprint}} detection {{technology that}} supports navigation, pointer, and fingerprint acquisition is described. The hybrid system {{consists of a}} silicon sensor substrate flip-chipped onto a mixed-signal ASIC. The sensor is linear and the finger is swiped over to scan the fingerprint. The navigation and pointer functions {{are based on the}} motion detection of the finger on the substrate <b>sensor.</b> <b>Stroking</b> and tapping the sensor substrate surface with the finger determines movement of the cursor and clicking-like mouse. To achieve 500 dpi fingerprint detection accuracy, separate process optimization for both the ASIC and the sensor substrate gives an alternative solution compared with all other silicon sensor approaches.

40|$|Abstract—Remote {{monitoring}} {{of physical activity}} using body-worn sensors provides an alternative to assessment of functional independence by subjective, paper-based questionnaires. This study investigated the classification accuracy of a combined surface electromyographic (sEMG) and accelerometer (ACC) sensor system for monitoring {{activities of daily living}} in patients with stroke. sEMG and ACC data (eight channels each) were recorded from 10 hemiparetic patients while they carried out a sequence of 11 activities of daily living (identification tasks), and 10 activities used to evaluate misclassification errors (nonidentification tasks). The sEMG and ACC sensor data were analyzed using a multilayered neural network and an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system to identify the minimal sensor configuration needed to accurately classify the identification tasks, with a minimal number of misclassifications from the nonidentification tasks. The results demonstrated that the highest sensitivity and specificity for the identification tasks was achieved using a subset of four ACC sensors and adjacent sEMG sensors located on both upper arms, one forearm, and one thigh, respectively. This configuration resulted in a mean sensitivity of 95. 0 %, and a mean specificity of 99. 7 % for the identification tasks, and a mean misclassification error of 10 % for the nonidentification tasks. The findings support the feasibility of a hybrid sEMG and ACC wearable sensor system for automatic recognition of motor tasks used to assess functional independence in patients with stroke.

40|$|Golf is {{a growing}} sport {{supported}} by a multi-billion dollar industry. Part of this growth {{can be attributed to}} new technologies including new training aids. Training aids address one of the major obstacles towards advancement in the sport, namely developing a controlled and consistent swing. Popular camera-based systems for golf swing measurement possess one or more major limitations including 1) extensive set-up and alignment, 2) restriction to indoor use, 3) high cost, 4) lack of portability, 5) placement of instruments (markers) on/near the club head, and 6) time-consuming data processing and analysis. This research resolves these limitations by contributing a highly portable, accurate and inexpensive means to measure golf swing dynamics. Introduced herein is a miniature and wireless six degree-of-freedom MEMS inertial measurement unit that fits entirely within the grip end of the golf club shaft. A companion measurement theory enables the computation of the rigid body dynamics of the golf club from sensor outputs. Flexible body dynamics, if and when needed, are estimated using dynamical models of flexible golf shafts. For putting <b>strokes,</b> the <b>sensor</b> system resolves the three-dimensional position of the club face to within 3 millimeters and the three-dimensional orientation of the club face to within 0. 5 degrees, both with millisecond updates. This measurement speed and significant precision enable the detailed characterization of putting strokes. A suite of “putting metrics” is identified that pin-points common putting faults from the measured club head trajectory and orientation. For full swings made with drivers and irons, the system resolves the complete three-dimensional rigid body motion of the club and critical metrics for swing instruction including the swing planes, club head velocity, and the club head orientation throughout the swing. Beyond golf, the measurement theory and hardware design hold significant promise for training systems for numerous other sports. In addition, this technology has relevance to far broader fields of application including, sports injury mechanics, rehabilitation science, gait analysis, surgeon training, etc. This research has contributed the foundation for these upcoming applications, many of which have already been initiated as a bi-product of this study...|$|R
