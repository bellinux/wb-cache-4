25|$|The International Tanker Owners Pollution Federation has tracked 9,351 {{accidental}} spills {{that have}} occurred since 1974. According to this study, most spills result from routine operations such as loading cargo, discharging cargo, and taking on fuel oil. 91% of the operational oil spills are small, resulting in less than 7 metric tons per <b>spill.</b> <b>On</b> the other hand, spills resulting from accidents like collisions, groundings, hull failures, and explosions are much larger, with 84% of these involving losses of over 700 metric tons.|$|E
25|$|On 29 July 2006 Russia {{shut down}} oil export to Mažeikių oil {{refinery}} in Lithuania after an oil <b>spill</b> <b>on</b> the Druzhba pipeline system occurred in Russia’s Bryansk oblast, near {{the point where}} a line to Belarus and Lithuania branches off the main export pipeline. Transneft said it would need one year and nine months to repair the damaged section. Although Russia cited technical reasons for stopping oil deliveries to Lithuania, Lithuania claims that the oil supply was stopped because Lithuania sold the Mažeikių refinery to Polish company PKN Orlen.|$|E
25|$|One {{example is}} the Church Rock uranium mill <b>spill</b> <b>on</b> Navajo Nation.

Two sets of five-year clean up plans {{have been put in}} place by US Congress, but contamination from the Church Rock incident has still not been completely cleaned up. Today, uranium contamination from mining during the Cold War era remains throughout the Navajo Nation, posing health risks to the Navajo community.|$|E

25|$|In November 2011, Shell Oil Company {{signed a}} three-year {{contract}} with Arctia Offshore and chartered the Finnish multipurpose icebreakers Fennica and Nordica to serve as primary ice management vessels in the Chukchi Sea during the summer seasons. The primary purpose of Fennica would be to protect the drillship Noble Discoverer by steering large ice floes so that they don't endanger the drilling operation. The decision to charter the Finnish icebreakers to support Arctic offshore drilling has been widely criticized due potential environmental damage in case of oil <b>spill.</b> <b>On</b> 16 March 2012, some 52 Greenpeace activists from five different countries boarded Fennica and Nordica at Arctech Helsinki Shipyard to protest Shell's drilling operations in Alaska.|$|E

25|$|The Labor Party {{replaced}} Rudd with Julia Gillard in 2010 {{owing to}} Rudd's unpopularity both among his frontbench and the public, so then Julia Gillard {{became the first}} woman prime minister in Australian history. Following the 2010 Election, Labor secured office in the first hung parliament since the 1940 election. The Gillard Government struggled on multiple policy fronts, trying to wrestle with a hung parliament. A scandal rocked the parliament: Speaker of the House Peter Slipper, who was a former Liberal Party member turned Labor ally, had sent sexually suggestive messages to a colleague. This resulted in his removal. Opposition to Gillard's government following her misogyny speech intensified. Leadership rivalry continued and Kevin Rudd was reinstated as prime minister in a Labor leadership <b>spill</b> <b>on</b> 27 June 2013. At the 2013 Election, the Second Rudd Government lost office and the Liberal-National Abbott Government formed.|$|E

25|$|In November 2011, Shell Oil Company {{signed a}} three-year {{contract}} with Arctia Offshore and chartered the Finnish multipurpose icebreakers Fennica and Nordica to serve as primary ice management vessels in the Chukchi Sea during the summer seasons of 2012–2014. The primary purpose of Nordica was to protect the drilling platform Kulluk by steering large ice floes so that they don't endanger the drilling operation. The decision to charter the Finnish icebreakers to support Arctic offshore drilling was widely criticized due potential environmental damage in case of oil <b>spill.</b> <b>On</b> 16 March 2012, some 52 Greenpeace activists from five different countries boarded Fennica and Nordica at Arctech Helsinki Shipyard to protest Shell's drilling operations in Alaska. The protests continued on May Day when the 52 activists from 15 different countries tried again to prevent Nordica from leaving Helsinki. On 3 May, while Nordica was passing the Swedish island of Öland in the Baltic Sea, six Greenpeace activists boarded the icebreaker, forcing the vessel to stop at Karlskrona where the protesters were arrested by the Swedish police and coast guard. Finally, in the following night 14 activists forced Nordica to carry out evasive manoeuvres in the sea region between Denmark and Germany by stopping boats {{in the middle of}} the shipping lane in front of the icebreaker and even swimming in the sea.|$|E
25|$|Following two {{and half}} decades of {{economic}} reform and amidst booming trade with Asia, Australia—in stark contrast to most other Western nations—avoided recession following the 2008 collapse of financial markets. Following the 2010 election, the Gillard Government entered an alliance with the Australian Greens and was destabilized by breaking an election promise not to introduce a carbon tax, by leadership rivalry and by lacking the numbers to push some controversial legislation through the Parliament. Nevertheless, the cross-bench alliance continued to operate and though facing declining poll support and firm opposition from the Liberal-National Coalition, in October the government successfully passed its Clean Energy Bill 2011 aimed to restructure the Australian economy {{in order to reduce}} greenhouse gas emissions associated with global warming by increasing costs to industry for carbon emissions. A carbon tax was introduced in Australia on 1 July 2012. Kevin Rudd was reinstated as prime minister in a Labor leadership <b>spill</b> <b>on</b> 27 June 2013. After the 2013 Australian General Election, Rudd lost the role of Prime Minister to Tony Abbott, the Liberal Leader. On 19 December 2013 95% of the Australian military had withdrawn from Afghanistan with the remaining 5% presently training locals in Kabul and Kandahar who are expected to pull out altogether sometime in December 2014, regardless of how the American and British troops' withdraw plays out.|$|E
