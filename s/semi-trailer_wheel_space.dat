50|$|The 2013 science-fiction movie Elysium (film) {{takes place}} on both a ravaged Earth, and a luxurious {{rotating}} <b>wheel</b> <b>space</b> station called Elysium.|$|R
50|$|At the {{rotating}} <b>wheel</b> <b>space</b> station in Stanley Kubrick's film 2001: A Space Odyssey, visitors can {{stay at a}} Hilton hotel. Hilton's logo appears prominently in the space station's lounge.|$|R
5000|$|Rotating <b>wheel</b> <b>space</b> stations, {{such as the}} Stanford torus, are wheel-like {{space station}} which produce {{artificial}} gravity by rotation. Typical designs include transport spokes to a central hub used for docking and/or micro-gravity research.|$|R
50|$|In 1951, in Collier's Weekly, Wernher von Braun {{published}} his {{design for a}} rotating <b>wheel</b> <b>space</b> station, which referenced Potočnik's idea - however these concepts would never leave the concept stage during the 20th century.|$|R
5000|$|A {{rotating}} <b>wheel</b> <b>space</b> {{station is}} a hypothetical wheel-shaped space station that rotates about its axis, thus creating {{an environment of}} artificial gravity. Occupants of the station would experience centripetal acceleration according to the following equation, ...|$|R
50|$|Space {{stations}} in science fiction can employ both existing and speculative technologies. One {{of the earliest}} images was the rotating <b>wheel</b> <b>space</b> station (such as the Stanford torus), the inertia and centripetal force of which would theoretically simulate the effects of gravity. Stations using artificial gravity are still purely speculative.|$|R
40|$|The {{swirling}} {{flow field}} in an internal cooling air {{system in which}} the fluid passes through an inducer, a hollow turbine shaft, and a cavity between two disks (referred to as a <b>wheel</b> <b>space)</b> is solved using computational fluid dynamics and the pressure fluctuations on the hollow shaft wall surface are measured...|$|R
5000|$|Greg Baldwin as Furlac, the Freemakers' merciless Aqualish {{landlord}} {{aboard the}} <b>Wheel</b> <b>space</b> station. He is constantly threatening {{to throw the}} Freemakers out if they don't pay rent on their shop in time, but notably is susceptible to Force persuasion as employed by Naare. In the second season, he becomes an ally to Graballa.|$|R
5000|$|Howard DGA-5 [...] "Ike" [...] - Ike {{featured}} a unique landing gear with two small <b>wheels</b> <b>spaced</b> one behind the other, with a wheel pant covering both. This landing gear {{was replaced with}} a single wheel configuration in 1933. Ike also used a higher octane fuel in races and had a Menasco B-6 (S/N 6008) rated at 160 HP at 1975 RPM.|$|R
50|$|The {{third major}} product {{designed}} by Walther and manufactured by the Dayton Steel Foundry was the 5th <b>wheel.</b> <b>Semi-trailer</b> trucks {{were starting to}} appear in the marketplace in the 1920s and 1930s. A logical next product, after wheels and brake drums, was the Fifth Wheel or 5th Wheel.|$|R
5000|$|Space stations, first {{presented}} in crude form by The Brick Moon, were popularized in the 1960s by books agitating for further development. Those little resembled the Salyut 1 or later actual stations. 2001: A Space Odyssey (film) presented the [...] "rotating <b>wheel</b> <b>space</b> station" [...] of the 1960s but few others did. The long-running fictional Deep Space Nine (space station) and Babylon 5 (space station) little resembled {{any of the}} above.|$|R
5000|$|Zoe first {{appears in}} the serial The <b>Wheel</b> in <b>Space,</b> where she is the {{librarian}} on board Space Station W3, {{also known as the}} Wheel. When the Cybermen attack, she aids the Doctor and Jamie in defeating them before stowing away aboard the TARDIS. In David Whitaker's script for The <b>Wheel</b> in <b>Space,</b> Zoe's last name is spelled [...] "Heriot", but the double-"r" [...] misspelling is also seen in reference works.|$|R
50|$|Both {{scientists}} and science fiction writers {{have thought about}} {{the concept of a}} rotating <b>wheel</b> <b>space</b> station {{since the beginning of the}} 20th century. Konstantin Tsiolkovsky wrote about using rotation to create an artificial gravity in space in 1903. Herman Potočnik introduced a spinning wheel station with a 30-meter diameter in his Problem der Befahrung des Weltraums (The Problem of Space Travel). He even suggested it be placed in a geostationary orbit.|$|R
25|$|The Doctor tells Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart {{that his}} name is Doctor John Smith, an alias first used in The <b>Wheel</b> in <b>Space.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{locomotives}} were {{equipped with}} six-wheeled tenders. The engines {{were very similar}} {{to a pair of}} 2-6-0T Stephenson's Patent back-to-back locomotives which had been delivered to the Midland System from the same manufacturer earlier in 1876. The two types differed in respect of their boiler pitch, which was 5 in higher on the tender locomotives, and their wheelbase and coupled <b>wheel</b> <b>spacing,</b> with the second and third coupled wheels 3 in further apart on the back-to-back tank locomotives.|$|R
50|$|The {{ride was}} {{subsequently}} modified in 1960s by the Velare Brothers (the originators of Sky <b>Wheels</b> and <b>Space</b> <b>Wheels).</b> The top circuit preceding the switchbacks, containing a big drop and a shallower dip, was added making the ride about 1/3 longer. Apparently this change {{was inspired by}} a similar alteration of the Velare's Wild Mouse at Nu-Pike in Long Beach, California.|$|R
50|$|The Time Vector Generator first {{appeared}} in The <b>Wheel</b> in <b>Space.</b> It also appears in the Virgin Missing Adventures novel Invasion of the Cat-People.|$|R
50|$|Any extra {{laterally}} <b>spaced</b> <b>wheel</b> {{can benefit}} the vehicle by providing stability gains {{if there is}} a mechanism to lock the laterally <b>spaced</b> <b>wheels</b> at any given moment relative to the road plane. In some countersteered vehicles this benefit is generally only available when stopped.|$|R
50|$|NASA {{has never}} {{attempted}} {{to build a}} rotating <b>wheel</b> <b>space</b> station, for several reasons. First, such a station {{would be very difficult}} to construct, given the limited lifting capability available to the United States and other spacefaring nations. Assembling such a station and pressurizing it would present formidable obstacles, which, although not beyond NASA's technical capability, would be beyond available budgets. Second, NASA considers the present space station, the ISS, to be valuable as a zero gravity laboratory, and its current microgravity environment was a conscious choice.|$|R

5000|$|Deliberately {{engineering}} {{a star in}} Messier 13 to go nova {{was part}} of the Cybermen’s complicated plot in the 1968 Doctor Who story The <b>Wheel</b> in <b>Space.</b>|$|R
50|$|In {{the final}} episode, the Time Lords wipe Zoe's mind and return {{her to the}} Wheel, where she {{encounters}} Tanya Lernov, a character from The <b>Wheel</b> in <b>Space.</b>|$|R
40|$|In-wheel type permanent-magnet {{synchronous}} motors {{for electric}} commuter cars {{are required to}} be compact and light to use limited <b>wheel</b> <b>space</b> effectively and reduce unspringing weight. Therefore, our previous papers presented a low-cost in-wheel axial-gap motor that uses ferrite permanent magnets. This motor adopted an open slot structure to reduce production costs. However, to achieve further size and weight reduction, we examine here in detail {{the adoption of a}} semiclosed slot structure instead of an open slot structure. Experimental results show that the semiclosed slot structure is effective in realizing size and weight reduction...|$|R
5000|$|Thomas Lennon as Wick Cooper, {{a wealthy}} {{resident}} of the <b>Wheel</b> <b>space</b> station who occasionally comes to the Freemakers to have them work on his vehicles. Very full of himself and proud of his station, he is quite willing to bully the Freemakers (particularly Zander) and others whom he regards as beneath him. He is also an insensitive individual, once making a joke {{at the expense of}} the destroyed Alderaan. Unfortunately for him, he did so in the presence of Princess Leia; he is also the Emperor's self-proclaimed biggest fan.|$|R
5000|$|Chapter 02: The Stranger - The {{three friends}} {{say they are}} using the house to publish a newspaper. Suddenly Samantha and Lynne find {{themselves}} <b>wheeling</b> through <b>space</b> by a transporter.|$|R
5|$|Other episodes contain {{straight}} {{excerpts from}} earlier serials, such as episode 10 of The War Games, which employs model {{shots from the}} first episodes of Fury from the Deep and The <b>Wheel</b> in <b>Space.</b>|$|R
5000|$|An {{immobile}} computer, {{referred to}} as the [...] "Cyber Planner", appears in The <b>Wheel</b> in <b>Space</b> and The Invasion. A Cyber Planner also takes over the Eleventh Doctor's body in [...] "Nightmare in Silver".|$|R
50|$|When {{the larger}} tyres were fitted, the old tyres {{were left in}} {{position}} and turned down on the wheel centres to serve as liners and the new tyres were then shrunk on over the liners. The practice of increasing the diameter of coupled <b>wheels,</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>spacing</b> and other considerations permitting, was begun by A.G. Watson during his term in office and was continued by his successors. The reduction of tractive effort caused by the larger wheels was made up by increasing boiler pressures or by fitting larger cylinders or both, as required. This policy resulted in more mileage between heavy repairs, less cost-per-mile on repairs and locomotives capable of higher speeds.|$|R
5|$|In its lead-in to an {{upcoming}} repeat, The <b>Wheel</b> in <b>Space</b> episode 6 contains a short three-frame clip from The Evil of the Daleks episode 1, alongside a reprise {{from the existing}} episode 2 of that serial.|$|R
5000|$|Jamie and Zoe {{had their}} {{memories}} of travelling with the Doctor erased by the Time Lords in The War Games, but retained {{each of their}} initial meetings with him (in The Highlanders and The <b>Wheel</b> in <b>Space,</b> respectively.) ...|$|R
50|$|Pedler wrote three scripts for Doctor Who: The Tenth Planet (with Gerry Davis), The Moonbase and The Tomb of the Cybermen. He also {{submitted}} the story outlines that became The War Machines, The <b>Wheel</b> in <b>Space</b> and The Invasion.|$|R
2500|$|John Hodgman's book makes {{references}} to Doctor Who in several places. In the beginning, where (made up) literary themes are being discussed, a still from The <b>Wheel</b> in <b>Space</b> {{is used to}} illustrate the theme of [...] "Man vs. Cyborg".|$|R
50|$|On 6 July 2017 Nerdist {{announced}} that a sneak peek of a new reconstruction of the <b>Wheel</b> in <b>Space.</b> The statement also {{said that it would}} be exclusive to Britbox, a US exclusive streaming service formed by the BBC and ITV.|$|R
