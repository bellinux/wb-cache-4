5000|$|Box {{cornices}} enclose the cornice of {{the building}} with what is essentially a long narrow box. A box cornice may further be divided into either the narrow box cornice or the wide box cornice type. A narrow box cornice {{is one in which}} [...] "the projection of the rafter serves as a nailing surface for the <b>soffit</b> <b>board</b> as well as the fascia trim." [...] This is possible if the slope of the roof is fairly steep and the width of the eave relatively narrow. A wide box cornice, which is common practice on houses with gentle roof slopes and wide eaves, requires the use of lookouts to give it support and to provide a surface to which to securely attach the soffits. Box cornices often have ventilation screens laid over openings cut in the soffits in order to allow air to circulate within the cornice.|$|E
50|$|The style {{sought to}} bring a {{translation}} of the balloon framing that had risen in popularity {{during the middle of}} the century, by alluding to it through plain trim <b>boards,</b> <b>soffits,</b> aprons, and other decorative features. Stick-style architecture is recognizable by the relatively plain layout, often accented with trusses on the gables or decorative shingles.|$|R
50|$|Internally, {{the nave}} floor slopes down towards the pulpit {{and the walls}} are rendered, with a timber boarded dado. The {{galleries}} contain tiered seating and are supported on cast iron columns with ornate capitals. The main ceiling and gallery <b>soffits</b> are diagonally <b>boarded</b> and finely carved timberwork is incorporated into the gallery railings, roof structure and furnishings.|$|R
50|$|From {{the room}} which was {{formerly}} the shop, is the straight varnished cedar staircase {{leading to the}} attic. It has turned balusters and newel, a panelled spandrel below, and a beaded <b>board</b> <b>soffit</b> over the doorway. The balustrade to the attic is simpler with squared posts and balusters. The attic is a single long room with tongue-and groove beaded boards to the side walls, flat and raked ceiling, and end walls of painted brick.|$|R
50|$|A central bi-furcating stairway, with {{substantial}} masonry balustrade featuring cut-out quatrefoils accesses {{the ground floor}} verandah of the building on the Ann Street facade. The verandah awning {{on the ground floor}} has a thin gauge corrugated iron soffit and is supported on reeded cast iron columns and has a cast iron balustrade and pointed arched friezes which also feature a quatrefoil motif. The verandah on the floor above has square timber columns, cast iron balustrading and a timber <b>boarded</b> <b>soffit.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{interior}} of the meetinghouse is a single large chamber with a gallery level on three sides. The fourth side, one of the long walls has the pulpit at its center, opposite the entrance. This arrangement was typical in New England meetinghouses until the early 19th century. Also typical of the period are the <b>soffits</b> and sounding <b>board</b> which frame the pulpit area. [...] The walls are finished with wooden wainscoting and plaster over lath. [...] The building was originally filled with box pews, but these were removed in the 19th century.|$|R
50|$|The {{residence}} has a {{corrugated iron}} gable roof, {{in which an}} attic space has been enclosed in recent years, with a large dormer window to both the northwest and southeast. The building has both timber and concrete stumps, with a timber batten skirt to the perimeter. It has verandahs to all sides with corrugated iron skillion roofs, <b>boarded</b> <b>soffits</b> and timber posts. The exterior walls are weatherboard and the building has sash windows of cedar, {{some of which have}} timber shutters, with a row of more recent silky oak sash windows to the eastern corner room. The southwest corner of the verandah has been enclosed with vertical boarding to form a bathroom and storeroom.|$|R
50|$|Constructed in 1928 {{across two}} blocks of land, Uanda is a low-set, hip-roofed, {{single-storey}} timber cottage {{set in a}} leafy street among timber houses of the same era. Rectangular in plan with a central projecting front porch flanked by bay windows, the house is clad with weatherboards and has a simple valance of timber palings to the lower level. The bay windows have bell-curved, shingle-clad skirts and multi-paned sash windows below flat projecting roofs and are supported on exposed timbers with a bird-mouth detail to the ends. The roof is tiled and has short projecting eaves with v-j <b>boarded</b> <b>soffit.</b> The house is elevated on concrete stumps, approximately one metre above {{the ground at the}} front and higher at the back as the ground slopes away.|$|R
50|$|The lower {{colonnade}} has {{a concrete}} floor, <b>boarded</b> <b>soffit,</b> and single- pane vertical sash windows with semicircular heads. Within the colonnade are archways {{to either side}} of the entry forming a small vestibule. Mounted on the wall is the Footballers Memorial. The returns to this western facade are less ornate, with similar windows, projecting stone sills, string courses, and the continuing cornice and parapet. The exterior to {{the main body of the}} hall is less ornate again, with only projecting sills, tall awning windows also with semicircular heads, and a gabled corrugated iron roof with three decorative vents to its ridge. The roof behind the parapet to the western end is hipped, with a protruding stone chimney and dormer window. The chamferboard addition to the rear has an assortment of windows, and a corrugated iron lean-to roof with several skylights.|$|R
50|$|The {{administration}} building is {{situated on the}} highest point of the site in the south-western corner adjacent to the railway bridge over Young Street. The building {{is divided into two}} sections. Adjacent to Young Street the single storey rendered masonry section has articulated engaged piers to its southern elevation, a hipped corrugated iron roof surmounted by two small ventilators, quad guttering, later sliding aluminium windows and <b>boarded</b> <b>soffits</b> in line with the rafters. The two storey rendered masonry section attached along its northern also has a hipped corrugated iron roof and quad guttering but has a flat soffit with timber cover strips and no evidence of articulated piers. It has a rendered masonry string course below the window line. The windows comprise groups of six top hung sashes to the western elevation with later aluminium sliding windows generally throughout the remainder of the building.|$|R
50|$|The two Pulpits {{date from}} 1626, are of oak {{and of the}} same general design, set against the two {{responds}} of the chancel-arch, each of pentagonal form with a short flight of steps, base having a series of short turned balusters connected by segmental arches and capped by a cornice, the whole continued outwards as a rail to the stairs; upper part of pulpit, each face divided into two bays by turned columns with moulded bases and capitals from which spring segmental arches and the whole finished with an entablature; door similar but with one half-column only, between the bays and with strap-hinges; sounding-board resting on panelled standard at back with two attached pilasters; board finished with an entablature with segmental arches below and turned pendants, <b>boarded</b> <b>soffit</b> with turned pendant in middle. The reason why there were two pulpits was that George Herbert's philosophy was that man should pray as well as preach.|$|R
25|$|Employing asymmetry, heavy massing, {{high quality}} brickwork, {{semi-circular}} forms and simplified ornamentation, {{the design of}} St Paul's combines characteristics of Gothic, Romanesque and Arts and Crafts styles. The church is constructed in dark-red-brown Flemish bond brickwork, with painted render dressings defining features such as string courses, copings, lintels and sills (internally and externally). Stepped and plain buttresses support the exterior walls, and arched openings are constructed from multiple rowlock (brick-on-edge) courses. The prominent roof form is clad with rib-and-pan profile metal sheeting (replaced in 1997), and features flared eaves supported on decoratively trimmed rafters with a raked <b>soffit</b> of tongue-and-groove <b>boards.</b> The nave end walls are topped with stone cross finials, and gable ends to the vestries and entrance porch are finished with basket weave patterned brickwork. The entrance porch features a radiating arch with deep angled brick jambs, rounded window openings and a boarded ceiling. The belfry atop the octagonal bell tower is enclosed with fixed timber louvres between brick piers of alternating, three-course bands of rendered and face brickwork capped by a concrete hemispherical cupola.|$|R
5000|$|Entry to the {{building}} is through a pair of substantial six-panelled timber doors, which have a smaller segmental stone pediment over, and '"TOWN HALL" [...] set into the threshold. The Entry Hall has several four- panelled cedar doors with glazed fanlights to offices on either side, and a moulded plaster archway leading to the cedar staircase {{up to the second}} level. This open-welled stair begins with a curtail step and handrail scroll, and features turned newels and balusters, and a <b>boarded</b> <b>soffit</b> lining. From the second landing is the entry to the Gallery through a similar doorway. At the top of the stair is a series of doorways to offices, formally the [...] "Mayor's Room", the [...] "Council Chambers" [...] and the [...] "Town Clerk", as announced by the painted signs on the doors' lock rails. Above this is a further stair of similar character but of lesser width which leads into the clocktower. The former Council Chamber has glazed French doors with semicircular fanlights leading onto the recessed verandah; a moulded cedar chimney piece; and two panelled cedar bulkheads to the Town Clerk's room, one of which still has its hinged panelled cedar dividing wall. Fixed to the south wall is a timber post, a remnant of a rail which has since been removed. The windows generally to the side wall also have semicircular heads. These rooms have boarded ceilings with fretted roses.|$|R
