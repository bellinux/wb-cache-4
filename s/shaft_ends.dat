50|$|Flexible {{plate is}} used in {{electric}} motor and generator armatures, field coil insulation, and magnet and commutator core insulation. Mica consumption in flexible plate was about 21 tonnes in 2008 in the US. Heater plate is used where high-temperature insulation is required. Molding plate is sheet mica from which V-rings are cut and stamped for use in insulating the copper segments from the steel <b>shaft</b> <b>ends</b> of a commutator. Molding plate is also fabricated into tubes and rings for insulation in armatures, motor starters, and transformers. Segment plate acts as insulation between the copper commutator segments of direct-current universal motors and generators. Phlogopite built-up mica is preferred because it wears {{at the same rate}} as the copper segments. Although muscovite has a greater resistance to wear, it causes uneven ridges that may interfere with the operation of a motor or generator. Consumption of segment plate was about 149 t in 2008 in the US. Some types of built-up mica have the bonded splittings reinforced with cloth, glass, linen, muslin, plastic, silk, or special paper. These products are very flexible and are produced in wide, continuous sheets that are either shipped, rolled, or cut into ribbons or tapes, or trimmed to specified dimensions. Built-up mica products may also be corrugated or reinforced by multiple layering. In 2008, about 351 t of built-up mica was consumed in the US, mostly for molding plates (19%) and segment plates (42%).|$|E

It would seem unlikely that early III's would ever make it to the IIIaü standard, as they would almost certainly have been worn out in service before then. The valvetrain changes concerned the layout of the rocker arms that operated the valves.

To meet these requirements, pump mechanical behavior versus nozzle loads must be examined in detail. Others have discussed <b>shaft</b> <b>end</b> displacement of centerline mounted pumps under nozzle loads. However, the subject of stresses on the pedestal bolts and casing is a critical area that must also be analyzed. An in-depth study was made on the deformation and stress analysis of centerline mounted end suction pumps, whose stiffness were relatively low and were frequently required to withstand rather high nozzle loads. The nozzle load analysis consisted of deformation and stress measurements, combined with finite element calculation. The analysis resulted in a versatile empirical formula for end suction, centerline mounted pumps {{that can be used to}} estimate the <b>shaft</b> <b>end</b> displacement, pedestal bolt stress and casing stress for arbitrary nozzle loads.

40|$|High {{speed drive}} shafts are {{traditionally}} balanced using trim balance weights {{applied to the}} <b>shaft</b> <b>ends.</b> This paper considers the development and theoretical analysis of a novel and alternative strategy of balancing long flexible coupling shafts, whereby the trim balancing weights are applied by the means {{of a pair of}} 'Balancing Sleeve' arms that are integrally attached to each end of the coupling shaft. The trim balance weights are intended to apply a corrective centrifugal force to the coupling shaft in order to limit shaft end reaction forces. With increasing speed, the magnitude of the corrective force also increases due to the flexibility of the balance sleeve. This thereby counteracts the increased coupling shaft unbalance resulting from its own flexibility. Additionally, it is also found that the mechanism imparts a corrective bending moment to the coupling <b>shaft</b> <b>ends,</b> which has a tendency to limit deflection. The methodology is modelled as a rotating simply supported shaft with uniform eccentricity and allows application to the problem of drivetrain balancing of sub- 15 MW industrial gas turbines. Results show that reaction loads can theoretically be reduced from 10, 000 N to approximately zero. The bending moment applied to the shaft is also shown to reduce shaft deflection theoretically to zero. In practical applications this will be unrealistic and achievable results show deflection theoretically reduced by half. Analysis of the balance sleeve feasibility is considered through use of a three-dimensional finite element model. Further to this paper, the aim is to develop a full dynamic model of both shaft and counterbalance sleeve, with verification coming from scaled, experimental test facilities.

The authors describe an installation of coupling hubs on upgraded machines where tools that were designed to be used on a coupling for a 6. 0 in diameter shaft were adapted to mount a coupling on an 8. 0 in shaft.

40|$|LecturePg. 43 - 50 A turbine <b>shaft</b> <b>end</b> at the {{coupling}} is exposed {{not only to}} constant torque load but to various variable loads as well. These externally imposed variable loads come from sources like compressor surge, misalignment between turbine shaft, and the driven machine, to name a few. These loads can be bending or torsional in nature. To assure reliability, the design method should include the influence of such loads on the final sizing of the <b>shaft</b> <b>end.</b> The design method should also include the effects of shrink fits, keyways, fillets, chrome plating and fretting on the fatigue properties of the shaft material. Due to variable nature of loads superimposed on the steady torque load, the design method {{must be based on}} fatigue behavior of materials. Many fatigue theories have been used in the design of components of turbomachinery. These depend {{on the nature of the}} load, type of material and component being designed. A designer should realize not only the nature of loads imposed on the. shaft and their source but also have an estimate of the magnitude of those loads. A design method is described which includes many of the factors governing the useful life of the shaft at {{the coupling}} end. This method is based on the von Mises reliability criteria, including the influence of the driven machine and the choice of coupling type.

40|$|The {{internal}} friction of a rotor-shaft-support system is mainly {{due to the}} shaft structural hysteresis and to some possible shrink-fit release of the assembly. The experimentation points out the destabilizing effect of the {{internal friction}} in the over-critical rotor running. Nevertheless, this detrimental influence may be efficiently counterbalanced by other external dissipative sources located in the supports or by a proper anisotropic configuration of the support stiffness. The present analysis considers a rotor-shaft system which is symmetric {{with respect to the}} mid span and is constrained by viscous-flexible supports with different stiffness on two orthogonal planes. The cylindrical and conical whirling modes are easily uncoupled and separately analyzed. The internal dissipation is modelled by nonlinear Coulombian forces and moments, which counteract the translational and rotational motion of the rotor relative to a frame rotating with the <b>shaft</b> <b>ends.</b> The nonlinear equations of motion are solved by averaging approaches of the Krylov-Bogoliubov type. In both the over-critical whirling motions, cylindrical and conical, stable limit cycles may be attained whose amplitude is as large as the external dissipation applied by the supports is low.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present the exact {{solution}} for free torsional vibrations of a linearly tapered circular shaft carrying a number of concentrated elements. First of all, the equation of motion for free torsional vibration of a conic shaft is transformed into a Bessel equation, and, based on which, the exact displacement function in terms of Bessel functions is obtained. Next, the equations for compatibility of deformations and equilibrium of torsional moments at each attaching point (including the <b>shaft</b> <b>ends)</b> between the concentrated elements and the conic shaft with positive and negative tapers are derived. From the last equations, a characteristic equation of the form is obtained. Then, the natural frequencies of the torsional shaft are determined from the determinant equation, and, corresponding to each natural frequency, the column vector for the integration constants,, is obtained from the equation. Substitution of the last integration constants into the associated displacement functions gives the corresponding mode shape of the entire conic shaft. To confirm the reliability of the presented theory, all numerical results obtained from the exact method are compared with those obtained from the conventional finite element method (FEM) and good agreement is achieved...|$|E
40|$|Multi-fractured {{horizontal}} wells {{are commonly}} employed {{to improve the}} productivity of low and ultra-low permeability gas reservoirs. However, conventional productivity models for open-hole multi-fractured horizontal wells do not consider the interferences between hydraulic fractures and the open-hole segments, resulting in significant errors in calculation results. In this article, a novel productivity prediction model for gas reservoirs with open-hole multi-fractured horizontal wells was proposed based on complex potential theories, potential superimposition, and numerical analysis. Herein, an open-hole segment between two adjacent fractures was regarded as an equivalent fracture, which was discretized as in cases of artificial fractures. The proposed model was then applied to investigate the effects of various parameters, such as the angle between the fracture and horizontal shaft, fracture quantity, fracture length, diversion capacity of fractures, horizontal well length, and inter-fracture distance, on the productivity of low permeability gas reservoirs with multi-fractured horizontal wells. Simulation results revealed that the quantity, length, and distribution of fractures had significant effects on the productivity of low permeability gas reservoirs while {{the effects of the}} diversion capacity of fractures and the angle between the fracture and horizontal shaft were negligible. Additionally, a U-shaped distribution of fracture lengths was preferential as the quantity of fractures at <b>shaft</b> <b>ends</b> was twice that in the middle area.
