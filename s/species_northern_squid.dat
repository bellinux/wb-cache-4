A total of 75 jigging stations was completed.

40|$|Electrical {{rectification}} {{was demonstrated}} in whole sartorius muscle and sciatic nerve of Rana pipiens {{and also in}} the single giant nerve fiber of the <b>northern</b> <b>squid,</b> Ommastrephes illecibrossus. It is probably a property of the plasma membrane. Rectification decreases reversibly under the influence of increased concentrations of the potassium ion and with chloroform, veratrine sulfate and isoamyl carbamate. No effect was found with lack of calcium, excess calcium, or barium chloride. Decrease in rectification is invariably accompanied by simultaneous decrease in resting potential. A proposed explanation of the mechanism of rectification is discussed. Rectification in a living membrane, viz. a change in resistance with change in direction of current flow, may possibly be explained in terms of a change in the concentration of potassium ions in the membrane...|$|R

The Ar-gentine genus Moreno Mello-Leitão is transferred from the Gnaphosidae to the Prodidomidae. Moreno was previously known only from the female holotype of its type species, but two additional species from Argentina and three from Chile are newly described, including the first known males of the genus. Three new genera are described: Chileomma, containing seven new six-eyed <b>species</b> from <b>northern</b> and central Chile; Chilongius, containing five new <b>species</b> from <b>northern</b> Chile; and Chileuma, containing three new <b>species</b> from <b>northern</b> and central Chile.

50|$|Illex illecebrosus, {{commonly}} known as the <b>northern</b> shortfin <b>squid</b> or Boston squid, is a species of neritic squids in the family Ommastrephidae. They are found in the northwest Atlantic Ocean, from off the coast of eastern North America to Greenland, Iceland, and west of Ireland and the United Kingdom. They are a highly migratory and short-lived species, with lifespans of less than a year. They are commercially important and are fished extensively (primarily by the United States and Canada), mostly for the Canadian and Japanese markets.|$|R
40|$|Age {{and growth}} ofTodarodes sagittatuswere {{estimated}} based on statolith analysis from individuals (N 352; 81 ^ 418 mm mantle length) caught by bottom trawlers during {{a year of}} sampling in the western Mediterranean. The daily nature of statolith increments was indirectly validated comparing {{the mean age of}} consecutive monthly modes (identi¢ed on the monthly length^frequency distributions) with the corresponding increase of 30 days. In agreement with other ommastrephids, results con¢rmed the following points: (1) lifespan lasts nearly ayear; (2) growth rates decreasewith age; (3) when adult, females have higher growth rates than males; and (4) females mature about amonth later than males. Signi¢cant correlationwas foundbetween hatching (which occurred throughout the year but with apeak inNovember) andtemperature at 50 m depth (where it is thought that hatchlings inhabit). Age and growth results were comparedwith those obtained in a similar work carried out in north-west Africa (Arkhipkin et al., 1999). Comparisons suggested that due to higher growth rates in juveniles, southern populations reach maturity and consequently decrease somatic growth at younger ages and smaller sizes than <b>northern</b> <b>squid,</b> which attain larger sizes as a result of maintaining fast growth and delaying maturation. Greater growth rates in juveniles fromwest Sahara could be explained by higher temperatures in this area than in the Mediterranean...|$|R
