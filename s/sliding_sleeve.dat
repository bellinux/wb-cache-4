25|$|Also {{often called}} {{pre-drilled}} liner. The liner is prepared with multiple small drilled holes, then set across the production zone to provide wellbore stability and an intervention conduit. Pre-holed liner is often combined with openhole packers, such as swelling elastomers, mechanical packers or external casing packers, to provide zonal segregation and isolation. It is now quite common {{to see a}} combination of pre-holed liner, solid liner and swelling elastomer packers to provide an initial isolation of unwanted water or gas zones.

30|$|At this point, it is {{important}} to distinguish “autonomous” FCDs from “active” FCDs; autonomous FCDs exhibit the control over unwanted fluids passively and without operator intervention relying on properties intrinsic to the fluid or fluid regime to trigger changing behavior. By contrast, active FCDs (such as intelligent control valves and FCDs with <b>sliding</b> <b>sleeves.),</b> require oversight by operators and direct intervention in order for there to be a change in performance behavior. Three commercial FCD geometries exhibit autonomous behavior: fluidic diodes, rate-controlled production valves, and hybrid FCDs. However, the manner by which each provides autonomy varies wildly from manufacturer to manufacturer and introduce new operational advantages and risks depending on the mechanism of action.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: There {{is a very}} {{significant}} application today towards multiple zone fracturing operations in a horizontal well of low permeability reservior all over the world. But {{the number of the}} ball seat activated <b>sliding</b> <b>sleeves</b> that can be run in a well is limited because of the design and can’t meet the need of volume fracturing in low permeability reservoir; Also the sleeves can only be shifted by CT, which extend the length of the operation and add to the overall costs.

50|$|The {{valve train}} is the {{mechanical}} system responsible for {{operation of the}} valves. Valves are usually of the poppet type, although many others have been developed such as <b>sleeve,</b> <b>slide,</b> and rotary valves.|$|R
50|$|It {{is usually}} run {{in close to}} the bottom end of the {{production}} tubing and set at a point above the top perforations or sand screens. In wells with multiple reservoir zones, packers are used to isolate the perforations for each zone. In these situations, a <b>sliding</b> <b>sleeve</b> {{would be used to}} select which zone to produce. Packers may also be used to protect the casing from pressure and produced fluids, isolate sections of corroded casing, casing leaks or squeezed perforations, and isolate or temporarily abandon producing zones. In water-flooding developments in which water is injected into the reservoir, packers are used in injection wells to isolate the zones into which the water must be injected.|$|E
50|$|The {{point of}} {{communication}} was traditionally a device called a <b>sliding</b> <b>sleeve,</b> or sliding side door, {{which is a}} hydraulically operated device, built into the production tubing. During normal operation, it would remain closed sealing off the tubing and the annulus, but for events such as this, it would be opened to allow {{the free flow of}} fluids between the two regions. These components have fallen out of favour as they were prone to leaking. Instead, it is now more common to punch a hole in the tubing for circulation kills. Although this permanently damages the tubing, given that most planned well kills are for workovers, this is not an issue, since the tubing is being pulled for replacement anyway.|$|E
50|$|In 2014 {{a concept}} of hybrid scale has been introduced, the elastically {{deformable}} arm scale, which is a combination between a spring scale and a beam balance, exploiting simultaneously both principles of equilibrium and deformation. In this scale, the rigid arms of a classical beam balance (for example a steelyard) are replaced with a flexible elastic rod in an inclined frictionless <b>sliding</b> <b>sleeve.</b> The rod can reach a unique free of sliding equilibrium when two vertical dead loads (or masses) are applied at its edges. Equilibrium, which would be impossible with rigid arms, is guaranteed because configurational forces develop at the two edges of the sleeve {{as a consequence of}} both the free sliding condition and the nonlinear kinematics of the elastic rod. This weight measuring device can also work without a counterweight.|$|E

50|$|The first {{successful}} sleeve valve was patented by Charles Yale Knight, and used twin alternating <b>sliding</b> <b>sleeves.</b> It {{was used in}} some luxury automobiles, notably Willys, Daimler, Mercedes-Benz, Minerva, Panhard, Peugeot and Avions Voisin. Mors adopted double sleeve-valve engines made by Minerva.The higher oil consumption was heavily outweighed by the quietness of running and the very high mileages without servicing. Early poppet-valve systems required decarbonization at very low mileages. The Burt-McCollum sleeve valve was named for the two inventors that applied for similar patents {{within a few weeks}} of each other. The Burt system was an open sleeve type, driven from the crankshaft side, while the McCollum design had a sleeve in the head and upper part of the cylinder, and a more complex port arrangement (Source: 'Torque Meter' Magazine, AEHS). The design that entered production was more 'Burt' than 'McCollum.' It was used by the Scottish company Argyll for its cars, and was later adopted by Bristol for its radial aircraft engines. It used a single sleeve which rotated around a timing axle set at 90 degrees to the cylinder axis. Mechanically simpler and more rugged, the Burt-McCollum valve had the additional advantage of reducing oil consumption (compared to other sleeve valve designs), while retaining the combustion chambers and big, uncluttered, porting area possible in the Knight system.|$|R
5000|$|Setting {{tools are}} used to set {{downhole}} completion elements such as production packers or bridge plugs. Setting tools typically use the expanding gas energy from a slow burning explosive charge to drive a hydraulic piston assembly. The assembly {{is attached to the}} plug or packer by means of a setting mandrel and a <b>sliding</b> <b>sleeve,</b> which when [...] "stroked" [...] by the piston assembly, effectively squeezes the elastomer elements of the packing element, deforming it sufficiently to wedge it into place in the tubing or casing string. Most completion packers or plugs have a specially designed shear mechanism which release the setting tool from the element allowing it to be retrieved back to surface. The packer/plug however, remains down hole as a barrier to isolate production zones or permanently plug off a well bore.|$|E

It contains 8 superconducting RF cavities made from solid pure niobium and a quadrupole package. The cryostat includes two aluminum shields of 4. 5 and 70 K with multilayer insulation on the outside. The helium distribution system needed to operate the superconducting cavities at 2 K and the magnets at 4. 5 K is also integrated into the cryostat. The two phase line transfers helium to the cavities, the gas return line transports gas from the cavities to the refrigeration plant. This line {{is connected to the}} cavity helium vessels via a helium bath {{at the end of the}} module. The 4. 5 K forward and return lines cool the quadrupole package, the radiation shield and the 4. 5 K intercept on the input coupler.
