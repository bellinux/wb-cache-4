40|$|Six Sigma is a statistics-based {{approach}} {{focusing on}} minimizing defects and variations in prod-ucts and processes. Although {{it is used}} generally in production-based businesses, Six Sigma {{has been used in}} service sector businesses in the recent years as well. The aim {{of this study is to}} de-termine healthcare and banking sector managers’ perceptions related to Six Sigma, and compare healthcare managers and banking managers in terms of their opinions about six sigma. The study was done between February 2016 and October 2016 in private healthcare organizations and pri-vate banks operating in Turkey.

40|$|Municipal {{wastewater}} treatment plants are among {{the main source of}} discharges of pollutants to the environment. How well these plants are managed and perform can {{have a significant impact on}} the ambient quality of the environment. The focus of this research is on the performance of public <b>sector</b> <b>managers</b> as compared to that of private <b>sector</b> <b>managers.</b> The central question is whether or not the approach of public <b>sector</b> <b>managers</b> to achieving emission reductions is one of cost minimization. In the theoretical literature this question receives conflicting answers: some models predict cost-minimization, whereas others predict that public <b>sector</b> <b>managers</b> will attempt to do more than what is required by emission standards. An examination of the actual performance of {{wastewater treatment}} plants in many jurisdictions in Canada and the U. S. supports the latter theory. For example, consistently over time, not only did virtually all Ontario municipal treatment plants emitting to Lake Erie and Lake Ontario comply with the existing emission standards for Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD), Suspended Solids (SS) and Phosphorus, but most performed considerably better than what was required. This observed phenomenon may be called “voluntary overcompliance”. Findings based on interviews with municipal treatment plant superintendents, recently retired plant superintendents, plant chemists, and other industry officials, clearly indicate that public <b>sector</b> <b>managers</b> have a various of different rationales for overcompliance. Can private <b>sector</b> <b>managers</b> be expected to do the same, or do they yield to pressures to reduce cost a the expense of the environmental quality? Does it make a difference whether or not the variable costs for electricity, chemicals and sludge disposal are pass through costs to the municipalities? And apart from the question of effluent quality, what are the major advantages and drawbacks of contracting? These questions will be answered by the results of a nationwide survey of over 100 contract operations in the United States.

40|$|Is {{there one}} best {{practice}} for ethical leadership? Studies {{suggest that the}} publicness of an organization can {{have important implications for}} leadership. Yet research on ethical leadership generally assumes that one ethical leadership style should fit all types of organization alike. This study explores the validity of that assumption by using qualitative interviews to unravel similarities and differences in how Dutch public, hybrid and private <b>sector</b> <b>managers</b> conceive ethical leadership. The results suggest that most aspects of ethical leadership may be transferable across public and private sectors. However, in comparison with their private <b>sector</b> counterparts, the <b>managers</b> operating in public and hybrid sector organizations placed greater value on being altruistic, showing concern for the common good, and being responsive, transparent and accountable to society at large. Moreover, whereas public and hybrid <b>sector</b> <b>managers</b> considered explicit and frequent communication about ethics to be a key component of ethical leadership, most of the private <b>sector</b> <b>managers</b> preferred communication strategies in which ethics was more implicitly embedded in discussions of, for instance, 'the business model' or 'customer relationships'. The results suggest further research on the contingencies of ethical leadership views and practices across different types of organizations is warranted. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC...|$|R

40|$|This paper investigates how {{transportation}} <b>sector</b> <b>managers</b> perceive and utilize climate science, and subsequently, {{how they}} appropriate {{the climate change}} problem. The analysis focuses on which devices they qualify as useful for translating between knowledge, policy and practice concluding {{with a discussion of}} what this suggests in the development of efficient climate adaptation strategies. The paper demonstrates that although transportation <b>sector</b> <b>managers</b> accept the findings of climate science knowledge presented to them, their understanding of the climate change problem and the range of qualifying anchoring devices used in the development of climate adaption strategies are differentiated according to where they are located in the institutional context. For transportation <b>sector</b> <b>managers</b> on the regional and district level, the climate problem is largely perceived through the occurrence of extreme weather rather than through climate science. However, this knowledge basis is not considered sufficient to support ‘knowing how to act’ and has resulted in waiting for the authorities to make standards and regulations that would translate climate change knowledge into methods of practice. We argue that the development of standards and regulations might be underestimated in relation to user demands in climate adaptation work that involves reconciling scientific information...|$|R

40|$|Adaptive capacity, {{vulnerability}} and resilience are terms that have recently entered the publiC sector lexicon {{in relation to}} natural resource management and climate change, often as hackneyed terms. Public <b>sector</b> <b>managers</b> are being encouraged to consider adaptive capacity and resilience {{in relation to a}} vast array of things including careers, landscapes, economies, communities, families, cities and nations, often with little understanding of how the terms can be practically applied to these contexts. This paper draws focus on perhaps the most usefully applied of these terms - adaptive capacity - as it relates to regional vulnerability assessment for climate change. While responses to climate change at global and national scales have been largely focussed on mitigation, it is now well accepted that adaptation is a necessary part of climate change strategies that will involve responses at regional and local scales (Schipper and Burton 2009). Increasingly, public <b>sector</b> <b>managers</b> are being asked to lead and contribute to assessments of regional {{vulnerability and}} to identify actions to enhance adaptive capacity of local communities to climate variability and change. There is a diverse academic literature on vulnerability and adaptive capacity but little has been distilled into broad principles that can guide publiC sector practice. In addition, because vulnerability and adaptive capacity are context specific, there are currently few Australian examples that regional public <b>sector</b> <b>managers</b> can draw on to inform their climate change strategies...|$|R
