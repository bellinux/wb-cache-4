As a result, {{it was determined that}} the effectiveness of an atomic bomb would be enhanced with detonation some kilometers above the target, rather than at ground level.|$|E
5|$|The {{nature of}} the longer-wavelength {{afterglow}} emission (ranging from X-ray through radio) that follows gamma-ray bursts is better understood. Any energy released by the explosion not radiated away in the burst itself {{takes the form of}} matter or energy moving outward at nearly the speed of light. As this matter collides with the surrounding interstellar gas, it creates a relativistic <b>shock</b> <b>wave</b> that then propagates forward into interstellar space. A second <b>shock</b> <b>wave,</b> the reverse shock, may propagate back into the ejected matter. Extremely energetic electrons within the <b>shock</b> <b>wave</b> are accelerated by strong local magnetic fields and radiate as synchrotron emission across most of the electromagnetic spectrum. This model has generally been successful in modeling the behavior of many observed afterglows at late times (generally, hours to days after the explosion), although there are difficulties explaining all features of the afterglow very shortly after the gamma-ray burst has occurred.|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} for a particle to travel through a medium faster than the phase velocity of light in that medium (but still slower than c).

With the use of explosives during World Wars I and II, pulmonary contusion resulting from blasts gained recognition.

5|$|Beta Pictoris {{may have}} been formed near the Scorpius-Centaurus Association. The {{collapse}} of the gas cloud {{which resulted in the}} formation of Beta Pictoris {{may have been}} triggered by the <b>shock</b> <b>wave</b> from a supernova explosion: the star which went supernova may have been a former companion of HIP 46950, which is now a runaway star. Tracing the path of HIP 46950 backwards suggests {{that it would have been}} in the vicinity of the Scorpius-Centaurus Association about 13 million years ago.|$|E
5|$|For TypeII supernovae, the {{collapse}} is eventually halted by short-range repulsive neutron-neutron interactions, {{mediated by the}} strong force, {{as well as by}} degeneracy pressure of neutrons, at a density comparable to that of an atomic nucleus. When {{the collapse}} stops, the infalling matter rebounds, producing a <b>shock</b> <b>wave</b> that propagates outward. The energy from this shock dissociates heavy elements within the core.

5|$|Remnants of many supernovae {{consist of}} a compact object and a rapidly {{expanding}} <b>shock</b> <b>wave</b> of material.

5|$|Synthesis of c-BN uses same methods {{as that of}} diamond: Cubic {{boron nitride}} is {{produced}} by treating hexagonal boron nitride at high pressure and temperature, much as synthetic diamond is produced from graphite. Direct conversion of hexagonal boron nitride to the cubic form has been observed at pressures between 5 and 18GPa and temperatures between 1730 and 3230°C, that is similar parameters as for direct graphite-diamond conversion. The addition of {{a small amount of}} boron oxide can lower the required pressure to 4–7GPa and temperature to 1500°C. As in diamond synthesis, to further reduce the conversion pressures and temperatures, a catalyst is added, such as lithium, potassium, or magnesium, their nitrides, their fluoronitrides, water with ammonium compounds, or hydrazine. Other industrial synthesis methods, again borrowed from diamond growth, use crystal growth in a temperature gradient, or explosive <b>shock</b> <b>wave.</b> The <b>shock</b> <b>wave</b> method is used to produce material called heterodiamond, a superhard compound of boron, carbon, and nitrogen.|$|E
40|$|AbstractWe {{study the}} {{structure}} of solutions of Riemann problems for systems of two conservation laws. Such a solution comprises a sequence of elementary waves,viz., rarefaction and <b>shock</b> <b>waves</b> of various types; <b>shock</b> <b>waves</b> are required to have viscous profiles. We construct a Riemann solution by solving a system of equations characterizing its component waves. A Riemann solution is “structurally stable” if the number and types of its component waves are preserved when the initial data and the flux function are perturbed. Under the assumption that rarefaction <b>waves</b> and <b>shock</b> states lie in the stricly hyperbolic region, we characterize Riemann solutions for which the definition equations have maximal rank and we prove that such solutions are structurally stable. Structurally stable Riemann solutions cannot contain overcompressive <b>shock</b> <b>waves,</b> but they can contain transitional <b>shock</b> <b>waves,</b> including doubly sonic transitional <b>shock</b> <b>waves,</b> including doubly sonic transitional <b>shock</b> <b>waves</b> {{that have not been}} observed before...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, shock {{sterilization}} {{using the}} motions of microbubbles induced by underwater <b>shock</b> <b>waves</b> is verified experimentally. A bio-experiment is carried out using marine Vibrio sp [...] Underwater <b>shock</b> <b>waves</b> are produced by electric discharge in a semi-ellipsoidal discharge reflector. The <b>shock</b> <b>waves</b> are focused to increase the pressure that the generated microbubbles are exposed to. The microbubbles are generated independently. The microbubble generator can produce microbubbles of around 50 mu m diameter by means of Kelvin-Helmholz instability and Venturi effect. Propagation behavior of <b>shock</b> <b>waves</b> and generation process of microbubbles are captured by high-speed camera. The experimental {{results show that the}} supply of microbubbles increases the potential of shock sterilization. In addition, it is found that <b>shock</b> <b>waves</b> without microbubbles also have the capacity of sterilization, and this means that cavitation bubbles generated behind converging <b>shock</b> <b>waves</b> contribute to inactivating marine bacteria...|$|R

5|$|Within a few seconds, a {{substantial}} {{fraction of the}} matter in the white dwarf undergoes nuclear fusion, releasing enough energy (1–) to unbind the star in a supernova. An outwardly expanding <b>shock</b> <b>wave</b> is generated, with matter reaching velocities {{on the order of}} 5,000–20,000km/s, or roughly 3% of the speed of light. There is also a significant increase in luminosity, reaching an absolute magnitude of −19.3 (or 5 billion times brighter than the Sun), with little variation.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to research into synthetic explosives like RDX and HMX, the ERL investigated {{the properties of}} detonations and shock waves. This was initiated as a pure research project, without obvious or immediate applications. Kistiakowsky visited England in 1941 and again in 1942, where he met with British experts, including William Penney and Geoffrey Taylor. When Kistiakowsky and Edgar Bright Wilson, Jr., surveyed the existing state of knowledge, they found several areas that warranted further investigation. Kistiakowsky began {{to look into the}} Chapman–Jouguet model, which describes the way the <b>shock</b> <b>wave</b> created by a detonation propagates.|$|E
5|$|The {{difference}} {{in the shape of}} the light curves is believed to be caused, in the case of TypeII-L supernovae, by the expulsion of most of the hydrogen envelope of the progenitor star. The plateau phase in TypeII-P supernovae is due to a change in the opacity of the exterior layer. The <b>shock</b> <b>wave</b> ionizes the hydrogen in the outer envelope – stripping the electron from the hydrogen atom – resulting in a significant increase in the opacity. This prevents photons from the inner parts of the explosion from escaping. When the hydrogen cools sufficiently to recombine, the outer layer becomes transparent.|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} a {{combination}} of lithotripter <b>shock</b> <b>waves</b> and cytotoxic drugs was examined in vitro. L 1210 cells in suspension were exposed to <b>shock</b> <b>waves</b> during incubation with cislatin, doxorubicin, daunorubicin, THP-doxorubicin, or aclacinomycin. Proliferation was determined using the 3 - 4, 5 dimethylthiazol- 2, 5 diphenyl tetrazolium bromide assay. Dose enhancement ratios were calculated for each drug {{in order to determine the}} effect of the additional exposure to <b>shock</b> <b>waves.</b> In addition, partition coefficients and IC 50 s of the drugs were determined. It was found, that the dose enhancement ratios increased for the drugs with decreasing cytotoxicity. The {{effect of a}}ll five drugs was enhanced by <b>shock</b> <b>waves</b> to a higher degree at 7 min incubation as compared to 50 min incubation. The effect of cisplatin was most significantly enhanced, with a dose enhancement ratio of 6. 7 at 7 min incubation. The enhancement increased with the operating voltage used for generating the <b>shock</b> <b>waves,</b> and was only present when cells were exposed to <b>shock</b> <b>waves</b> during the incubation with the drug.

The cultural capital Kyoto, which had been spared the bombing inflicted upon militarily significant cities, was von Neumann's first choice, a selection seconded by Manhattan Project leader General Leslie Groves.

The loss of their key energy production facility and the destruction of the Klingon homeworld's ozone layer throws the Klingon Empire into turmoil. No longer able to maintain a hostile footing, the Klingons sue for peace with their longstanding enemy, the United Federation of Planets. Accepting the proposal before the Klingons revert to a more belligerent approach, Starfleet sends the USS Enterprise-A to meet with the Klingon Chancellor, Gorkon, and escort him to negotiations on Earth. Enterprises captain, James T. Kirk, whose son David was murdered by Klingons years earlier, opposes the negotiations and resents his assignment.|$|E
5|$|Early in the Savage's career, squadrons would {{typically}} deploy a detachment to Naval Air Station Port Lyautey, Morocco, {{for service}} with the Sixth Fleet and fly the bombers aboard aircraft carriers {{that were already}} deployed to the Mediterranean as needed. The plan was that the Savages would then be loaded with atomic bombs already aboard the carriers and launched once the carriers were in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea. The tactic to deliver the bombs was to fly at low level through Bulgaria and Romania before climbing at maximum power to the proper altitude to release the bomb.

For acute pain, low- to moderate-quality evidence supports walking.

There is tentative evidence to support the use of heat therapy for acute and sub-chronic low back pain but little evidence for the use of either heat or cold therapy in chronic pain. Weak evidence suggests that back belts might decrease the number of missed workdays, but there is nothing to suggest that they will help with the pain.
