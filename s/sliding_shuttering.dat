50|$|Constructed in {{concrete}} - an innovation {{in those days}} - using the then equally innovative technique of <b>sliding</b> <b>shuttering,</b> the tower was given {{the shape of a}} Greek cross to symbolize the connection between time and space, and merging heaven and earth. Twenty storeys above and four below ground level accommodate a line-up of some 46 kilometres of printed material, or over 3 million items. Supporting the vertical lines of the tower and the books on the shelves are the horizontal lines of the open books on the long tables of the magnificent reading-room, the rectangular courtyard that bathes in daylight, and the reading-room for manuscripts, safely shielded from daylight at {{the north side of the}} edifice. The tower was inaugurated in 1942 and recognized as a monument in 1992.|$|E

40|$|This paper covers {{research}} examining the restoration {{work of the}} Shimo-no-hashi-mon gate inside the Fukuoka-jo castle. The ground floor of Shimo-no-hashi-mon (lit. the Lower Bridge Gate) still exists. However, photos depicting the original structure of the gate do not exist. Fukuoka City is doing restoration works of Shimo-no-hashi-mon gate based on images of the Kami-no-hashi-mon gate old photos of which still remain. The most similar building to this Shimo-no-hashi-mon gate is honmaru-omote-mon gate. The window shutters of the honmaru-omote-mon gate are hung by hinges and projected from the wall when they are open. In this style of window {{which is similar to}} Bahama shutter style, the window looks consecutive with the wall, and the number of windows can be doubled that of the <b>sliding</b> <b>shutter</b> style windows needing storage place behind the wall. The upper half of the Shimo-no-hashi-mon Gate door is a lattice and has holes through which you can shoot at the enemies. The restoration plan made by Fukuoka City assumed that the part colored white in the black and white photo was a wall and decided to make <b>sliding</b> <b>shutter</b> style windows on the wall. It is argued, however, the part coloured white is the shutter which made look lighter than it should be in the photo by overexposure.

50|$|Thimble tube boilers require {{horizontal}} tubes {{to permit}} their variable boiling flow, thus the boiler shells are constructed as vertical boilers. The majority {{have a large}} vertical central flue, with the thimble tubes protruding into it from a surrounding water jacket. These thimble tubes are formed by deep drawing of steel - a process that was not available in Victorian times, but that became a cheap means of production once available. Hot gas enters from beneath and exits {{from the top of}} the boiler. To improve gas flow over the tubes, a series of horizontal disks are lowered into the central space on a rod or chain, forcing gas flow radially outwards, over the tubes. Cleaning these inward-pointing thimbles could be difficult. A 1954 patent by Clarksons describes a boiler shell with a <b>sliding</b> <b>shutter</b> on the outside to access the central flue.|$|R

There was no doubt as to ownership. Mr. Sidney saw him while yet far off, and bellowed at him about pig-pounds and floodgates. These last were two great <b>sliding</b> <b>shutters</b> of weedy oak across the brook, which were prised up inch by inch with a crowbar along a notched strip of iron, and when Sidney opened them they at once let out half the water.

40|$|In {{an effort}} to reduce the heating demands of Hicks, a model of the average monthly heating loads was developed. This model was {{validated}} with measured heating load values. The model was used to target probable causes of high heat loss and used to determine the benefits of three heating load reducing options. These options were insulating the walls, constructing a <b>sliding</b> <b>shutter</b> for the lobby window, and reducing the temperature of the building. Based on the options examined, only reducing temperatures is recommended. The model was also used in an analysis of a high temperature active solar heating system using high efficiency evacuated thermal collectors. This system would be adapted to the current heating system. The analysis shows that the solar system would be unable to reduce the overall costs of heating Hicks assuming a twenty year life of the system. The solar system analyzed is not recommended for Hicks however this does not preclude other solar heating designs...|$|R

50|$|In {{the period}} 1884-1887, the Queensland Department of Posts and Telegraph erected seven timber-framed, corrugated-iron clad {{telegraph}} offices {{associated with the}} construction of the Cape York Telegraph Line.

It is likely the Thursday Island Telegraph Office opened in an existing post office. Unlike other telegraph offices, those on the Cape York line were designed to provide protection from attack by Aborigines, and included <b>sliding</b> <b>shutters</b> on the front verandah windows, an internal verandah for the quarters, gun posts at diagonally opposite corners of the verandahs, an enclosure for water tanks under the building (which was elevated on high stumps), and a corrugated iron fence surrounding the yard.
