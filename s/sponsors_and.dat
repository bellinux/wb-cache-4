5|$|Richmond {{returned}} to racing sprint {{cars in the}} United States Automobile Club's (USAC) national sprint car tour in 1978. Competing in 12 races, he finished 30th in points as the series' Rookie of the Year. That year he attended Jim Russell's road racing school at Willow Springs International Motorsports Park, setting a student course record. Richmond raced in a 1978 Mini Indy car event at Phoenix International Raceway, winning the Formula Super Vee support event in a Lola T620. The win attracted <b>sponsors</b> <b>and</b> attention from major owners like Roger Penske. He also competed in USAC's Silver Crown series.|$|E

5|$|As of 2006, the IFNA {{recognises}} only women's netball. Men's netball teams {{exist in}} some areas but attract less attention from <b>sponsors</b> <b>and</b> spectators. Men's netball started to become popular in Australia during the 1980s, and the first men's championship was held in 1985. In 2004, New Zealand and Fiji sent teams {{to compete in the}} Australian Mixed and Men's National Championships. By 2006, mixed netball teams in Australia had as many male participants as rugby union. Other countries with men's national teams include Canada, Fiji, Jamaica, Kenya, Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates. Unlike women's netball at elite and national levels, men's and mixed gendered teams are largely self-funded.|$|E
5|$|Ganguli {{founded and}} {{directed}} a major festival of cultural diplomacy and international arts in Istanbul in July 2010 {{under the title}} 'Istancool'. Liberatum claimed the festival's aim was to showcase all that is contemporary about Istanbul as a great world city while celebrating its past and heritage. Istancool brought together leading fashion, arts and cultural figures from Milan, London, Paris and New York City including Terence Koh, Daphne Guinness, Leigh Lezark, The Misshapes, Michael Nyman, Gareth Pugh, Gore Vidal, Bernard-Henri Lévy, Lily Cole, Zaha Hadid, Philip Treacy, Sir VS Naipaul, Franca Sozzani, Lee Daniels, Waris Ahluwalia and Jefferson Hack. The festival celebrated Istanbul's status as the 2010 European Capital of Culture. It aimed to showcase the great talents of Turkey and connect them with leading global figures. Istancool <b>sponsors</b> <b>and</b> partners consisted of Turkish Airlines, Istanbul 74, Vakko, Turkish Ministry of Culture and Tourism, AnOther Magazine, Vogue Turkiye, Harper's Bazaar, Istanbul 2010 European Capital of Culture Agency, Sakip Sabanci Museum, Turkish Airlines, Pera Museum and Istanbul Modern.|$|E
5|$|Needing {{material}} for the relatively new medium of television, producer Robert Maxwell sold Weatherwax {{on the concept of}} a Lassie television series with a boy and his dog theme. The two men developed a scenario about a struggling war widow, her young son, and her father-in-law set on a weather-beaten, modern day American farm. Two pilots were filmed in Calgary, Alberta, Canada with the first telling the story of the bond forged between boy and dog, and the second filmed to give potential <b>sponsors</b> <b>and</b> network buyers an idea of a typical episode. After viewing the pilots, CBS put the show on its fall 1954 schedule. Campbell's Soup Company signed on early as the show's sole sponsor and remained so for the show's entire run. Filming for the series began in the summer of 1954, and Lassie made its début Sunday, September 12, 1954, at 7:00p.m. EST, a time slot the show would call home on CBS for the next seventeen years.|$|E

Paulina Kellogg Wright Davis invited her {{to speak at the}} first National Women's Rights Convention in 1850, but because of pregnancy, Stanton chose instead to lend her name to the list of <b>sponsors</b> <b>and</b> send a speech to be read in her stead. In 1851, Stanton was {{introduced}} to Susan B. Anthony on a street in Seneca Falls by Amelia Bloomer, a feminist and mutual acquaintance who had not signed the Declaration of Sentiments and subsequent resolutions despite her attendance at the Seneca Falls convention.|$|E
5|$|The Stanley Cup {{championship}} team is allotted 100 days during off-season to pass around the Cup including the team's parade, days with <b>sponsors</b> <b>and</b> {{a day or}} so with each player and member of the team's staff. It is always accompanied by at least one representative from the Hockey Hall of Fame. Although many players have unofficially spent a day in personal possession of the Cup, in 1994 the New York Rangers started a tradition wherein each member of the Cup-winning team is allowed to retain the Cup for a day. Victors of the Cup have used it to baptize their children. Three players (the New York Islanders' Clark Gillies, the Anaheim Ducks' Sean O'Donnell, and the Pittsburgh Penguins' Nick Bonino) even allowed their dogs to eat out of the Cup.|$|E
5|$|The Sussex Archaeological Society, now {{the oldest}} archaeological society in England, was founded within the castle's walls on 9 July 1846. Six years later, two antiquarians, Mark Antony Lower and Charles Roach Smith, were granted {{permission}} by the Duke of Devonshire {{to carry out}} an excavation of the castle {{with the support of}} <b>sponsors</b> <b>and</b> the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway, which provided free transport. The excavations concentrated on the Roman west gate and north postern, with some small trial trenches dug elsewhere on the site. They began in August 1852 and continued until November, unearthing several 4th century Roman coins, numerous stone catapult balls and the foundations of the chapel in the inner bailey. The castle well was also discovered around the same time by the castle's custodian.|$|E

5|$|Andrée {{resisted}} Ekholm's criticisms to {{the point}} of deception. On the boat back from Svalbard, Ekholm learned from the chief engineer of the hydrogen plant the explanation of some anomalies he had noticed in his measurements: Andrée had from time to time secretly ordered extra topping-up of the hydrogen in the balloon. Andrée's motives for such self-destructive behavior are not known. Several modern writers, following Sundman's Andrée portrait in the semi-documentary novel, The Flight of the Eagle (1967), have speculated that Andrée had by this time become the prisoner of his own successful funding campaign. The <b>sponsors</b> <b>and</b> the media followed every delay and reported on every setback, and were clamoring for results. Andrée, Strindberg, and Ekholm had been seen off by cheering crowds in Stockholm and Gothenburg (see image from Aftonbladet, right), and now all the expectations were coming to nothing with the long wait for southerly winds at Danes Island. Especially pointed was the contrast between Nansen's simultaneous return, covered in polar glory from his daring yet well-planned expedition on the ship Fram, and Andrée's failure even to launch his own much-hyped conveyance. Sundman theorizes that Andrée could not face letting the press report {{that he did not know}} the prevailing wind direction, and had also miscalculated in ordering the balloon, and needed a new one to rectify his error.|$|E
5|$|Players can add non-Steam {{games to}} their libraries, {{allowing}} {{the game to}} be easily accessed from the Steam client and providing support where possible for Steam Overlay features. The Steam interface allows for user-defined shortcuts to be added. In this way, third-party modifications and games not purchased through the Steam Store can use Steam features. Valve <b>sponsors</b> <b>and</b> distributes some modifications free-of-charge; and modifications that use Steamworks can also use VAC, Friends, the server browser, and any Steam features supported by their parent game. For most games launched from Steam, the client provides an in-game overlay that can be accessed by a keystroke. From the overlay, the user can access his or her Steam Community lists and participate in chat, manage selected Steam settings, and access a built-in web browser without having to exit the game. Since the beginning of February 2011 as a beta version, the overlay also allows players to take screenshots of the games in process; it automatically stores these and allows the player to review, delete, or share them during or after his or her game session. As a full version on February 24, 2011, this feature was reimplemented so that users could share screenshots on websites of Facebook, Twitter, and Reddit straight from a user's screenshot manager.|$|E
5|$|The balloon {{had carried}} {{a lot of}} food, of a kind adapted more for a balloon voyage than for travels on foot. Andrée had {{reasoned}} that {{they might as well}} throw excess food overboard as sand, if losing weight was necessary; and if it was not, the food would serve if wintering in the Arctic desert did after all become necessary. There was therefore less ballast and large amounts of heavy-type provisions, 767kg (1690lb) altogether, including 200liters of water and some crates of champagne, port, beer, etc., donated by <b>sponsors</b> <b>and</b> manufacturers. There was also lemon juice, though not as much of this precaution against scurvy as other polar explorers usually thought necessary. Much of the food was in the form of cans of pemmican, meat, sausages, cheese, and condensed milk. By the time they crashed, they had thrown some of it overboard. The three men took most of the rest with them on leaving the crash site, along with other necessities such as guns, tent, ammunition, and cooking utensils, making a load on each sled of more than 200kg (440lb). This was not realistic, as it broke the sleds and wore out the men. After one week, they sorted out and left behind a big pile of food and non-essential equipment, bringing the loads down to 130kg per sled. It became more necessary than ever to hunt for food. They shot and ate seals, walruses, and especially polar bears throughout the march.|$|E
