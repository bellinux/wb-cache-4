40|$|Searching {{for small}} targets in large spaces {{is a common}} problem in the sciences. Because blind search is {{inadequate}} for such searches, {{it needs to be}} supplemented with additional information, thereby transforming a blind search into an assisted search. This additional information can be quantified and indicates that assisted searches themselves result from searching higher-level search spaces–by conducting, as it were, a search for a search. Thus, the original search gets displaced to a higher-level search. The key result in this paper is a displacement theorem, which shows that successfully resolving such a higher-level search is exponentially more difficult than successfully resolving the original search. Leading up to this result, a measure-theoretic version of the No Free Lunch theorems is formulated and proven. The paper shows that stochastic mechanisms, though able to explain the success <b>of</b> <b>assisted</b> searches in locating targets, cannot, in turn, explain the <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>assisted</b> searches...|$|R

A key element in issuing early TC warnings is an accurate and timely knowledge of the location of the circulation centre, or 'eye', of the TC. However, TC radar eye fix is often carried out manually in practice, and results may vary among forecasters. In this paper, a novel motion field structure analysis method is described as an aid to locate TC eyes more accurately. The method is comprehensive, and can handle incomplete data and landfalling cases. Implemented on a standard desktop computer, an average error of 0. 15 degrees in latitude/longitude on a Mercator Projection map for TCs that are completely inside the radar image is obtained. This is well within the relative errors given by different TC warning centres.

Methods Testicular biopsy tissues were obtained from infertile patients (n= 12) with obstructive azoospermia and cryopreserved. Testicular sperm motility was observed after in vitro culture procedure. The ultrastructure of testicular sperm (n= 6) was examined by transmission electron microscope. Results After cryopreservation, 10 biopsy tissues frozen revealed motile sperm, and 2 samples showed non-motile sperm. Some testicular sperm in frozen-thawed group had normal morphology in fine structures. Sperm head in frozen-thawed tissue showed a proportion of nuclei with more electron-dense granules of chromatin. In a few frozen-thawed sperm heads, formation of vesicles and degeneration were observed. The frozen-thawed testicular sperm frequently showed swollen or/and ruptured of the plasma membrane and acrosome membranes.

40|$|Background: The article {{concerns}} the tensions that can arise during demanding external, and consequential internal changes and considers how educational leadership {{is able to}} respond to them. Leadership is here understood as a collaborative endeavour, producing shared sense-making in situations of tension. Purpose: The main research question was: what kinds of leadership dynamics underlie situations of tension brought about by external and internal change? The sub-question was: what kind of micro-level sense-making processes, argued to be the true <b>source</b> <b>of</b> change, <b>assist</b> in revealing these dynamics? Programme: Educational organisations increasingly face demanding external changes, such as the two mergers described in this article. Tensions can easily be brought about during such external changes and the consequential internal changes, such as two pedagogical innovation projects in this article. Sample: The study was conducted with three leadership teams within two organisations. The first organisation was a vocational education organisation with around 4000 – 5000 students and 500 staff members. The leadership team that was studied was followed for almost two years. The other organisation was a business school which comprised of around 7000 students, 150 – 200 professors and 500 staff members. There, two leadership teams were investigated and followed for almost three years. Design and methods: The data for the sense-making process was selected by way of qualitative content analysis and an experimented model called TenKeys®. This data were analysed using a grounded theory approach to uncover the underlying leadership dynamics. Results: Ten micro-procedural leadership dynamics were identified. Actions related to the pedagogical projects were then interpreted by means of these dynamics. Conclusions: The findings suggest that understanding underlying leadership dynamics might help educational organisations respond to possible tensions brought about by external and internal change and, consequently, support learners’ learning processes, albeit indirectly...|$|R

Objective: To evaluate the level of awareness and perception <b>of</b> <b>assisted</b> conception treatment among women attending fertility clinic. Methods: A descriptive cross-sectional study. Results: One hundred and ninety six women attending fertility clinic were interviewed. Mean age was 34. 8 year and mean duration of infertility of 4. 1 years. Of the 196 infertile women interviewed, 150 (76. 5 %) have heard <b>of</b> <b>Assisted</b> Reproductive Technology treatment. <b>Sources</b> <b>of</b> information were mainly family relation (46 %) and friends (28. 7 %). Knowledge on some <b>of</b> <b>Assisted</b> Reproductive Technology practices showed that 50. 7 % were aware that the treatment could fail, 36. 8 % knew it could be applied for male infertility treatment, 9. 3 % and 18. 7 % respectively are aware that donor oocyte and sperm could be used for treatment. Perception on babies conceived from assisted conception treatment revealed that 52 % of patients interviewed could not comment if they are normal and natural babies.
