5|$|Several {{collisions}} {{have occurred}} on Washington Metro, resulting in injuries and fatalities, along with numerous derailments with {{few or no}} injuries. WMATA {{has been criticized for}} disregarding <b>safety</b> <b>warnings</b> and advice from experts. The Tri-State Oversight Committee oversaw WMATA, but had no regulatory authority. Metro's safety department is usually in charge of investigating incidents, but could not require other Metro departments to implement its recommendations. Following several safety lapses, the Federal Transit Administration assumed oversight at WMATA.|$|E
25|$|Bags {{of cement}} {{routinely}} have health and <b>safety</b> <b>warnings</b> printed on them {{because not only}} is cement highly alkaline, but the setting process is exothermic. As a result, wet cement is strongly caustic (water pH = 13.5) and can easily cause severe skin burns if not promptly washed off with water. Similarly, dry cement powder in contact with mucous membranes can cause severe eye or respiratory irritation. Some trace elements, such as chromium, from impurities naturally present in the raw materials used to produce cement may cause allergic dermatitis. Reducing agents such as ferrous sulfate (FeSO4) are often added to cement to convert the carcinogenic hexavalent chromate (CrO42−) into trivalent chromium (Cr3+), a less toxic chemical species. Cement users need also to wear appropriate gloves and protective clothing.|$|E

40|$|<b>Safety</b> <b>warning</b> {{messages}} in owner 2 ̆ 7 s manuals {{act as the}} visible and text based warning to users to avoid potential harm or injury. These warnings include those for DANGER, WARNING, and CAUTION. Current existing standards and general design principles give recommendations to <b>safety</b> <b>warning</b> message design, {{but they do not}} discuss the implications of adapting these recommendations to a broader range of professional communication settings. This thesis focuses on analyzing the salience of <b>safety</b> <b>warning</b> {{messages in}} owner 2 ̆ 7 s manuals, and ultimately creating a set of <b>safety</b> <b>warning</b> message design criteria that will be adaptable to a broader range of professional communication settings. This thesis uses two methods to examine the ways in which these warning messages are salient. The first is a literature review of current <b>safety</b> <b>warning</b> message design standards and general design principles. The second is an analysis <b>safety</b> <b>warning</b> messages from a representative sample of owner 2 ̆ 7 s manuals for a high-powered, high-risk product. The {{results of this study suggest}} the design features that make <b>safety</b> <b>warning</b> messages salient in owner 2 ̆ 7 s manuals. The results further open future discussions of analyzing design criteria and how to create design criteria that can be adaptable to broader professional communication situations...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe vast {{majority}} of children aged 2 - 12 in China seldom have safety consciousness. They are lack of the risk prevention knowledge.

Few people or educational organizations pay close attention {{to the study of the}} elevator <b>safety</b> <b>warning</b> system, especially the warning pictures, which are taken as a very efficient way to prevent the potential risks. In this article, China's elevator safety publicity system and the different elevator manufacturers’ designs are introduced. Because of the public utilities, the concept to carry out uniform standards in elevator <b>safety</b> <b>warning</b> is proposed. Propaganda target, picture warning content, warning way, and intensity of color are defined. To enact a consistent standard, the principles of scientific elevator <b>safety</b> <b>warning</b> pictures’ system, combination of universality and particularity and color and pattern and text should be followed...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — In {{this paper}} we propose a novel vision for highway <b>safety</b> <b>warning</b> based on sensor networks, aiming at {{providing}} user-friendly zero-delay <b>safety</b> <b>warning</b> to motorists. Our idea leverages the advanced sensing, networking and storage technologies. Highway sensors detect events and store event records at multiple designated locations such that passing-by drivers can be alerted to potential dangers or traffic delays through wireless communication among sensors deployed at the highway and the vehicle. We design a location-centric storage protocol, which manages the propagation and storage of event records based on the time needed to clear the event in the highway. This protocol ensures that event records can be fairly distributed among highway sensors when event arrival rate is Poisson distributed with the same mean, as verified by our simulation study and theoretical performance analysis...|$|R
