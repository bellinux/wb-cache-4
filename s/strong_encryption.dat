50|$|Some HSM {{systems are}} also {{hardware}} cryptographic accelerators. They usually cannot beat {{the performance of}} hardware-only solutions for symmetric key operations. However, with performance ranges from 1 to 7,000 1024-bit RSA signs per second, HSMs can provide significant CPU offload for asymmetric key operations. Since National Institute of Standards and Technology is recommending the use of 2,048 bit RSA keys from year 2010, performance at longer key sizes is becoming increasingly important. To address this issue, some HSMs now support elliptic curve cryptography (ECC), which delivers <b>stronger</b> <b>encryption</b> with shorter key lengths.|$|R

We leveraged this importance notions to reduce the management overhead for less important objects. In our system, all objects were explicitly annotated by the content creators using a temporal importance metric. The storage system used these hints to manage the reliability (by reducing the replication levels for less important objects), fidelity (by transcoding objects), performance (by moving more important objects to faster storage locations), security (by encrypting important objects with <b>stronger</b> <b>encryption)</b> and persistence (by reducing the persistence guarantees for less important objects).

5000|$|While a few Gpcode {{variants}} {{have been}} successfully implemented, many variants have flaws that allow users to recover data without paying the ransom fee. The first versions of Gpcode used a custom-written encryption routine that was easily broken.

Once some encrypted+unencrypted pairs have been found, this sometimes gives enough information to decrypt other files. [...] Variant Gpcode.am uses symmetric encryption, which made key recovery very easy.In late November 2010, a new version called Gpcode.ax was reported. It uses <b>stronger</b> <b>encryption</b> (RSA-1024 and AES-256) and physically overwrites the encrypted file, making recovery nearly impossible.|$|R

25|$|According to {{professor}} Jan Arild Audestad, at the standardization process {{which started in}} 1982, A5/1 was originally proposed to have a key length of 128 bits.

Audestad, Peter van der Arend, and Thomas Haug says that the British insisted on weaker encryption, with Haug saying he {{was told by the}} British delegate that this was to allow the British secret service to eavesdrop more easily. The British proposed a key length of 48 bits, while the West Germans wanted <b>stronger</b> <b>encryption</b> to protect against East German spying, so the compromise became a key length of 54 bits.|$|R
