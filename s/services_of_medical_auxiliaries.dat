Based on a few limited studies and hospitals returns, the prevalence of eye diseases and blindness data are presented. These may have a wide margin of error; cataract, trachoma, corneal involvement and glaucoma are the leading causes. Degenerative lesions, trauma, squint, tumors, uveitis and refractive errors are additional causes. A programme to prevent blindness and control eye diseases has been developed and is being adopted in Zambia. This programme highlights eight shortcomings of the present system and suggests corrective measures. ...|$|R

40|$|Compulsory {{smallpox}} vaccination {{was introduced}} to Algeria by decree on 27 May 1907. After World War I, the combination of public health crises, racialized fears of contagion, and the objective of mise en valeur prompted the colonial state to make Muslim villagers in the communes mixtes a more systematic target of smallpox vaccination. This was achieved in large part thanks to the efforts <b>of</b> Muslim <b>medical</b> <b>auxiliaries.</b> This article reconstructs the kinds of training, labor, and clerical skills embodied in these agents’ administration of vaccination. It also examines the accommodation and contestation of their presence by officials, politicians, and villagers. The author argues that the administrative bureaucracy generated by vaccination may have preceded and enabled the expansion of state registration in rural areas during the interwar period, but ultimately was more effective at disciplining the <b>medical</b> <b>auxiliary</b> than it was at controlling villagers or the smallpox virus...|$|R
