5|$|Before 1928 {{the only}} flag that had {{official}} {{status in the}} Union of <b>South</b> <b>Africa</b> <b>was</b> the United Kingdom's Union Jack as <b>South</b> <b>Africa</b> <b>was</b> part of the British Empire. The South Africa Red Ensign {{was used as an}} unofficial flag. In 1925, discussion rose about creating a new flag for South Africa as many descendants of Boers found the Union Jack unacceptable after the Boer War. In 1926 the Balfour Declaration granted South Africa legislative autonomy, opening the possibility of a new flag. British settlers wanted the Union Jack in the new flag as part of the British Empire while the Afrikaners did not. A compromise was reached whereby the new flag would consist of the Prince's Flag as this was the first flag raised on South Africa and a badge of the Union Jack in the centre with the flags of the Orange Free State and the South African Republic. The Union Jack was mirrored in the new flag with the hoist on the right so that it did not take precedence over the others.|$|E
