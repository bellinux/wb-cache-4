The results of optimal <b>stent</b> <b>strut</b> pattern for reduced blood flow speed and wall shear stress were different, and the influence of the AR values was small because there was no dependence on relationship between blood flow and the AR values due to the use of a straight pipe in the parent artery.

40|$|Currently, the {{treatment}} of Patent Ductus Arteriosus (PDA) by the implantation of coronary stent has resulted in severe hemodynamic complications. There is thus a need to customize and improve current stent geometry specific to PDA to overcome this problem. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) approaches, verified by an experimental technique are used to analyze current <b>stent</b> <b>strut</b> configurations. Statistical analysis is used to rank the parameter performance and to obtain the best stent configuration. The most favorable configuration is then used to design new <b>stent</b> <b>strut</b> configuration specific for PDA. In {{the analysis of the}} new stent design, CFD results show low possibility of re-stenosis process due to thrombosis formation, inflammation, and neo-intimal hyperplasia. Furthermore, comprehensive CFD analysis by solving fluid-structure interaction (FSI) cases has produced an optimum <b>stent</b> <b>strut</b> configuration that is structurally sound. The strength of <b>stent</b> <b>strut</b> configuration due to hemodynamic effect is analyzed through the Von Misses stress distribution. The results show that the new improved design of <b>stent</b> <b>strut</b> configuration has excellent hemodynamic performance. Finally, the new stent design is predicted to be able to overcome hemodynamic complications and stent structural failure when applied specifically to PDA...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Recent {{clinical}} {{studies have shown}} that recanalization rates are lower in stent-assisted coil embolization than in coiling alone in the treatment of cerebral aneurysms. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess and compare the hemodynamic effect of <b>stent</b> <b>struts</b> and straightening of vessels by stent placement on reducing flow velocity in sidewall aneurysms, with the goal of reducing recanalization rates. METHODS: We evaluated 16 sidewall aneurysms treated with Enterprise stents. We performed computational fluid dynamics simulations using patient-specific geometries before and after treatment, with or without <b>stent</b> <b>struts.</b> RESULTS: <b>Stent</b> placement straightened vessels by a mean (±standard deviation) of 12. 9 ° ± 13. 1 ° 6 months after treatment. Placement of <b>stent</b> <b>struts</b> in the initial vessel geometries reduced flow velocity in aneurysms by 23. 1 % ± 6. 3 %. Straightening of vessels without <b>stent</b> <b>struts</b> reduced flow velocity by 9. 6 % ± 12. 6 %. <b>Stent</b> <b>struts</b> had significantly stronger effects on reducing flow velocity than straightening (P =  0. 004, Wilcoxon test). Deviation of the effects was larger by straightening than by <b>stent</b> <b>struts</b> (P =  0. 01, F-test). The combination of <b>stent</b> <b>struts</b> and straightening reduced flow velocity by 32. 6 % ± 12. 2 %. There was a trend that larger inflow angles produced a larger reduction in flow velocity by straightening of vessels (P =  0. 16). CONCLUSION: In sidewall aneurysms, <b>stent</b> <b>struts</b> have stronger effects (approximately 2 times) on reduction in flow velocity than straightening of vessels. Hemodynamic effects by straightening vary in each case and can be predicted by inflow angles of pre-operative vessel geometry. These results may be useful to design a treatment strategy for reducing recanalization rates...|$|R

The study aims {{to establish the}} incidence in which bare <b>stent</b> <b>struts</b> cross the renal ostia and to assess any associated effects on renal function. MethodsFifty-five patients (51 men, mean age 73 years, range 57 – 90) who had endovascular repair of their abdominal aortic aneurysms with a Talent suprarenal stent-graft {{were included in the}} study. Patients were scanned at a variety of follow-up periods (median 24 months, range 3 – 102). The relationship between the bare <b>stent</b> <b>struts</b> and the renal ostia, together with renal function were retrospectively recorded. The presence and location of the bare <b>stent</b> <b>struts</b> was assessed using CT virtual intravascular endoscopy (CT VIE). Struts were defined as being absent, peripherally located or in the central channel of the renal ostia. Renal function was assessed from glomerular filtration rates (GFR) derived from serum creatinine levels and the Cockcroft and Gault formula. ResultsA total of 109 renal ostia were evaluated by CT VIE with one patient having a previous nephrectomy. Bare <b>stent</b> <b>struts</b> crossed 1 renal ostium in 22 (40 %) patients and bilateral ostia in 5 (9 %) patients. Of the 109 ostia assessed, 15 (14 %) ostia were crossed centrally and 17 (16 %) had struts crossing the ostium peripherally. There were no statistically significant differences in the change between pre-operative GFR and latest GFR in the group without any strut involvement (6 mLs/min± 7 mLs/min) and the group with struts crossing one or both renal ostia (2 mLs/min± 9 mLs/min; p>. 05).

However, a histological validation of coronary OFDI for the evaluation of <b>stent</b> <b>strut</b> coverage in vivo is urgently needed. Hence, the present study was designed to evaluate the capacity of coronary OFDI by electron (SEM) and light microscopy (LM) analysis to detect and evaluate <b>stent</b> <b>strut</b> coverage in a porcine model. Methods and results Twenty stents were implanted into 10 pigs and coronary OFDI was performed after 1, 3, 10, 14, and 28 days. Neointimal thickness as detected by OFDI correlated closely with neointimal thickness as measured by LM (r = 0. 90, P < 0. 01). The comparison of <b>stent</b> <b>strut</b> coverage as detected by OFDI and SEM analysis revealed an excellent agreement (r = 0. 96, P < 0. 01). In particular, stents completely covered by OFDI analysis were also completely covered by SEM analysis. All incompletely covered stents by OFDI were also incompletely covered by SEM. Analyses of fibrin-covered stent struts suggested that these may rarely be detected as uncovered stent struts by OFDI. Importantly, optical density measurements revealed a significant difference between fibrin- and neointima-covered coronary stent struts [0. 395 (0. 35 - 0. 43) vs. 0. 53 (0. 47 - 0. 57); P < 0. 001], suggesting that differences in optical density provide information on the type of <b>stent</b> <b>strut</b> coverage.

The study aims to investigate whether suprarenal <b>stent</b> <b>struts</b> affect the morphological change of the renal artery with ostial calcification observed on CT virtual intravascular endoscopy. MethodsNine patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms undergoing suprarenal fixation of stent grafts {{were included in the}} study. All patients received a Zenith endovascular graft with uncovered suprarenal components placed above the renal arteries. Renal ostial calcification and configuration of stent wires crossing the renal ostium were characterized in each patient and maximal transverse and longitudinal diameters of the renal ostia were measured on virtual endoscopy pre- and post-stent grafting. ResultsThere were altogether 17 renal ostia assessed with one patient having atrophic left kidney and no renal ostium being observed. Ostial calcification was found in five of the left renal ostia and five of the right renal ostia with one patient having bilateral ostial calcification. There {{was no significant difference between}} the renal ostial diameters measured pre- and post-stent grafting (p> 0. 05). Suprarenal <b>stent</b> <b>struts</b> were found to cross the renal ostia in various configurations observed on virtual endoscopy. All of the renal arteries were patent on follow-up CT scans after suprarenal fixation without stenosis or occlusion being observed. One patient with atrophic left renal artery developed renal failure following suprarenal stent grafting and received renal dialysis, while in the remaining cases median serum creatinine level did not change significantly. ConclusionsSuprarenal <b>stent</b> <b>struts</b> did not significantly affect the renal ostia with ostial calcification in terms of the diameter measurements and renal function. Further studies deserve to investigate the long-term effect of <b>stent</b> <b>struts</b> on the renal artery in terms of cross-sectional area reduction caused by stent wires and ostial calcification...|$|R
40|$|ObjectivesThe goal of {{this study}} was to use angioscopy to {{investigate}} the amount of neointimal coverage after sirolimus-eluting stent (SES) implantation. BackgroundSirolimus-eluting stents reduce intimal hyperplasia. MethodsWe used angioscopy to evaluate 37 consecutive stented coronary artery lesions (15 SES and 22 bare-metal stents [BMS]) in 25 patients (18 men, 7 women) at 3 to 6 months after stent implantation. Angioscopic evaluation focused on: 1) neointimal coverage of <b>stent</b> <b>struts,</b> and 2) the existence of thrombi. The degree of neointimal coverage was classified as grade 0 when there was no neointimal coverage (similar to immediately after the implantation); grade 1 when <b>stent</b> <b>struts</b> bulged into the lumen, but were covered and still translucently visible; grade 2 when <b>stent</b> <b>struts</b> were visible but not clearly seen (not translucent); and grade 3 when <b>stent</b> <b>struts</b> were not visible because they were embedded in the neointima. ResultsThrombi were identified in eight stented segments, tended to be more common with SES (p[*]= 0. 14), but were not seen on angiography. Three of the 15 SES (20 %) had grade 0 neointimal coverage, and only 2 SES (13. 3 %) had complete coverage (grades 2 / 3). In contrast, all 22 BMS showed complete intimal coverage (grades 2 / 3). Thrombi were more common in stents with incomplete neointimal coverage (p = 0. 09). ConclusionsThe SES had incomplete neointimal coverage three to six months after implantation, and this was associated with subclinical thrombus formation...|$|R

To help more accurate diagnosis and monitoring of the disease, many researchers have recently worked on visualization of various coronary microscopic features including <b>stent</b> <b>struts</b> by constructing three-dimensional (3 D) volumetric rendering from series of cross-sectional intracoronary FD-OCT images. In this paper, we present the first, to our knowledge, "push-of-a-button" graphics processing unit (GPU) -accelerated framework for intracoronary OCT imaging.

Methods and results: We compared the <b>stent</b> <b>strut</b> apposition of six different stent designs when deployed (at 12 atm) in an idealised stenosed vessel using a novel approach based on finite element simulations. Additional insights into the mechanical behaviour of the investigated stents were obtained by virtually quantifying the stent induced vessel wall stresses. For the investigated stenosed vessel model, the percentage of malapposed struts (distance to wall > 10 mu m) ranged between 9 % (Integrity stent) and 43 % (Promus Element stent). The largest strut-artery distances were observed at the plaque shoulders. The 95 percentile of the axial stress within the intima ranges from 32 (Promus Element stent) to 83 kPa (Liberte stent). Stress peaks were mainly located at the inner curvatures of the vessel model and at the stent ends. Conclusions: For the investigated case, considerable differences were observed between the studied stent platforms in terms of <b>stent</b> <b>strut</b> apposition and stent induced vessel wall stresses. These differences in mechanical behaviour may help to explain clinical observations...|$|E

40|$|Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a fatal {{disease of}} the heart or blood vessels. The {{greatest}} number of deaths from CVD is coronary heart disease (CHD). It is characterised by thickening of the arterial vessel wall due to atheromatous plaque which may result in narrowing or even occlusion of arterial lumen. Currently, intravascular optical coherence tomography (IVOCT) has been increasingly used in the clinic for the diagnosis of CHD because it permits high-resolution direct tomographic visualisation of cross-sectional images. With IVOCT techniques, stenosis and restenosis caused by plaques and neointima can be detected and analysed. The first main contribution of the thesis is a technique for the automatic segmentation of the lumen border when the guide-wire artifacts are noticeable. The proposed segmentation technique is capable of eliminating guide-wire artifacts and generating accurate lumen borders from IVOCT sequences. Compared to commercially available systems, the proposed method is robust and accurate. The second main contribution of this thesis is an approach for the <b>stent</b> <b>strut</b> detection that can detect stent struts when their intensity responses are weak. This technique is based on <b>stent</b> <b>strut</b> shadow detection. The innovative aspect of our technique is that, for every detected strut shadow, a-priori probability map is applied to estimate the <b>stent</b> <b>strut</b> position. With the detected stent struts, a stent area can be estimated to analyse the neointima hyperplasia (NIH) thickness in IVOCT sequences. The thesis also proposes an approach for the neointima segmentation without any information of the stent but instead with the lumen border. The approach {{is a combination of}} a multi-atlas based segmentation approach and a patch-based segmentation approach. With the approach, the neointima label can be obtained by fusing labels from atlases. Compared to other label fusion approaches, a significant increase in segmentation accuracy can be observed.

40|$|SummaryAlthough {{very late}} stent {{thrombosis}} after drug-eluting stent implantation {{is a critical}} event, its cause has not been clarified. This is the first report of a case with very late stent thrombosis after drug-eluting stent implantation for which prior angioscopic image of the culprit lesion is available. A 54 -year-old Japanese male patient with stable angina who received implantation of sirolimus-eluting stent at the culprit lesion and 1 -year follow-up angiographic and angioscopic examinations came back with chest pain at rest at 2. 5 years after the stent implantation. Very late stent thrombosis was diagnosed by emergent angiographic and angioscopic examinations and was treated by zotarolimus-eluting stent. One-year angiographic and angioscopic follow-up examinations after zotarolimus-eluting stent were performed. Angioscopy revealed uncovered <b>stent</b> <b>strut,</b> yellow plaques, and thrombus at 1 -year follow-up after sirolimus-eluting stent implantation, and it confirmed the thrombotic occlusion inside the sirolimus-eluting stent {{at the time of}} emergent catheterization.

40|$|AbstractPurpose: Early {{restenosis}} and {{the development}} of myointimal hyperplasia in stented blood vessels have been attributed to deep vascular injury with fracture of the internal elastic lamina (IEL). The {{purpose of this study was}} the evaluation of the vascular wall response to superficial injury (without IEL rupture) after balloon angioplasty and intravascular stent placement in porcine arteries and the determination of the effect of <b>stent</b> <b>strut</b> geometry on the degree of vessel injury and early restenosis. Methods: Balloon-expandable stainless-steel stents were placed into the iliac arteries of 10 Sinclair miniature swine that had been fed an atherogenic diet. A Palmaz stent, with rectangular struts and smooth corners, was randomly assigned to one iliac artery (group 1), and a novel stent, which was designed and manufactured in the laboratory with thicker struts and sharper corners specifically to induce large wall stress concentrations, was placed in the contralateral iliac artery (group 2). Intravascular ultrasound scan was used in all deployments to ensure accurate balloon sizing and to avoid stent overexpansion and deep vascular injury. At 90 days after implantation, the animals were killed, the stented vessels harvested, and histomorphometric analysis performed. Results: Deployment of novel stents in group 2 resulted in a statistically higher incidence rate of deep vascular injury (fracture of the IEL) compared with group 1, despite identical balloon size used for deployment (with Student t test, P <. 05). Vessels with deep injury showed a 10 -fold increase in myointimal thickening compared with those vessels in which the IEL remained intact. A statistically higher restenosis rate was observed for group 2 (33. 5 % ± 19. 90 %) compared with group 1 (20. 39 % ± 14. 70 %). For both stent designs, there was a trend toward lower degrees of restenosis within the mid-portion of the stent. For superficially injured arteries in both groups, no correlation was observed between the amount of vessel wall/medial layer compression {{and the development}} of restenosis from myointimal hyperplasia. Conclusion: Maintenance of an intact IEL is an important factor in the prevention of myointimal hyperplasia and restenosis in stented porcine iliac arteries. The alteration of <b>stent</b> <b>strut</b> height and geometry does not significantly affect restenosis {{and the development of}} myointimal hyperplasia in vessels with superficial injury. Superficial injury elicits a response that is independent of <b>stent</b> <b>strut</b> geometry and vessel wall compression. <b>Stent</b> <b>strut</b> profile may, however, increase local vessel wall stress concentrations, leading to IEL rupture and an exaggerated response to injury.

40|$|SummaryA 72 -year-old {{woman with}} a history of {{treatment}} with a single sirolimus-eluting stent (SES) for right coronary artery stenosis 21 months previously, was hospitalized to undertake invasive coronary evaluation due to recurrence of symptoms of effort angina. At the time of 9 months of angiographic follow-up, no in-stent restenosis was detected, however, several contrast filled “dimples” were noticed outside the stent border. At this time, further increments in the numbers of dimple formation were documented, in addition to progression of stenosis at the distal non-stented portion. Intravascular ultrasound demonstrated multiple cavity formations between the <b>stent</b> <b>struts,</b> due to positive remodeling occurring at the previously relatively disease-free side of the vessel wall. Surprisingly, optical coherence tomography demonstrated all the <b>stent</b> <b>struts,</b> including those located adjacent to cavities, were exclusively covered with neointima or other tissue components, completely attaching to the vessel wall throughout the stented segment. No evident thrombus formation was detected in these cavities. Despite no exposed <b>stent</b> <b>struts,</b> a hypothetical concern remains because such cul-de-sac formations may produce local blood flow turbulence within stents, which may be potentially associated with activation of local platelet aggregation. Careful long-term follow-up may be necessary for these patients...|$|R
40|$|AIMS: Stent {{deployment}} causes {{endothelial cell}} (EC) denudation, which promotes in-stent restenosis and thrombosis. Thus endothelial regrowth in stented arteries {{is an important}} therapeutic goal. <b>Stent</b> <b>struts</b> modify local hemodynamics, however the effects of flow pertubation on EC injury and repair are incompletely understood. By studying the effects of <b>stent</b> <b>struts</b> on flow and EC migration we identified an intervention that promotes endothelial repair in stented arteries. METHODS AND RESULTS: In vitro and in vivo models were developed to monitor endothelialization under flow {{and the influence of}} <b>stent</b> <b>struts.</b> A 2 D parallel-plate flow chamber with 100 ??m ridges arranged perpendicular to the flow was used. Live cell imaging coupled to computational fluid dynamic simulations revealed that EC migrate in the direction of flow upstream from the ridges but subsequently accumulate downstream from ridges at sites of bidirectional flow. The mechanism of EC trapping by bidirectional flow involved reduced migratory polarity associated with altered actin dynamics. Inhibition of Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) enhanced endothelialization of ridged surfaces by promoting migratory polarity under bidirectional flow (p< 0. 01). To more closely mimic the in vivo situation we cultured EC on the inner surface of polydimethylsiloxane tubing containing Coroflex Blue <b>stents</b> (65 ??m <b>struts)</b> and monitored migration. ROCK inhibition significantly enhanced EC accumulation downstream from struts under flow (p< 0. 05). We investigated the effects of ROCK inhibition on re-endothelialization in vivo using a porcine model of EC denudation and stent placement. En face staining and confocal microscopy revealed that inhibition of ROCK using fasudil (30 mg/day via osmotic minipump) significantly increased re-endothelialization of stented carotid arteries (p< 0. 05).

Objective: To evaluate the extent of sirolimus-eluting <b>stent</b> <b>strut</b> endothelialization (delivered from the luminal and abluminal aspects or abluminal aspect only) in the iliac arteries of rabbits. Methods: The iliac arteries of 10 rabbits were implanted with four sirolimus-eluting stents in the luminal and abluminal aspects, three sirolimus-eluting stents in the abluminal aspect, six polymer-coated stents, and four uncoated stents. After four weeks, the rabbits were euthanized and scanning electron microscopy was performed to quantify the area of exposed <b>stent</b> <b>strut</b> {{as well as the}} percentage of endothelialization. Results: The area (mean +/- SD) (mm(2)) of exposed uncoated stent struts, polymer-coated stents, sirulimus-eluting stent in the abluminal and luminal aspects and sirolimus-eluting stent in the abluminal aspect was 0. 12 +/- 0. 08, 0. 09 +/- 0. 12, 0. 60 +/- 0. 67 and 0. 05 +/- 0. 04, respectively (p = 0. 120). The percentage of endothelialization (mean +/- SD) (%) of uncoated stents, polymer-coated stents, sirolimus-eluting stents in the luminal and abluminal aspects and sirolimus-eluting stents in the abluminal aspect was 99 +/- 01, 99 +/- 0. 97 +/- 03 and 99 +/- 0, respectively (p = 0. 133).

40|$|A 56 -year-old man, {{known for}} type B aortic dissection, was treated 3 years before with a Talent endograft (Medtronic, Minneapolis, USA) in the {{descending}} aorta. He presented with tamponade {{caused by the}} perforation of the aortic intima by the uncovered <b>stent</b> <b>strut.</b> The ascending aorta {{and part of the}} aortic arch were replaced. The operation and recovery were uneventful. To avoid aortic arch damage by thoracic stent-grafts, the proximal stent should be fully covered. In addition we should be very cautious about the proximal landing zone of the stent, which should not be on the curved portion of the aorta...|$|E
40|$|Background: Several {{studies have}} {{reported}} re-endothelialization and endothelial func-tion after drug-eluting stent (DES) implantation; however, the relationship between re-endothelialization and endothelial function after DES implantation has not been investigated yet. Methods: A total of 14 patients underwent evaluation of re-endotheli-alization by optical coherence tomography (OCT) and endothelial function by incre-mental Ach infusion at 9 months after DES implantation (ZES: N 57, PES: N 5 7). The neointimal thickness (NIT) inside each strut, strut coverage, and malapposition at every 1 mm cross-section were evaluated by OCT and the endothelial function was estimated by measuring the coronary vaso-reactivity in response to acetylcholine (Ach) infusion into coronary arteries. Results: Zotarolims eluting stent (ZES), compared with paclitax-cel eluting stent (PES), showed more homogeneous neointimal coverage of <b>stent</b> <b>struts</b> and low rate of malapposition. Vasoconstriction in response to Ach in the peri-stent region was also less pronounced in ZES than PES. In particular, vasoconstriction was more often observed in cases with inhomogeneous neointimal coverage of <b>stent</b> <b>struts</b> in the PES group. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that endothelial function seems to be better preserved with ZES than PES, and homogeneous neointimal coverage of <b>stent</b> <b>struts</b> seem {{to be associated with}} the preserved endothelial function.

40|$|A {{drug-eluting}} stent with rhombic-shaped drug reservoirs is proposed, {{aimed at}} providing long-term drug delivery and enhanced fatigue life. Unique rhombic-shaped reservoirs or channels on the <b>stent</b> <b>struts</b> {{can increase the}} total drug capacity and improve the stress distribution for longer fatigue life, without compromising other important clinical attributes. Our rhombic-shaped channel stent increases the total drug capacity by multiple times. Its fatigue safety factor, even with the large rhombic cutouts on the <b>stent</b> <b>struts,</b> could be 50 % {{higher than that of}} the conventional drug-eluting stent. A pulsed fiber-optic laser and a series of expansions and heat treatments were used to make the first prototype of our rhombic-shaped channel stent. This new concept may open up a wide variety of new treatment options and opportunities for the medical industry in the future...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Bioabsorbable {{drug-eluting}} coronary stents {{present a}} very promising improvement {{to the common}} metallic ones solving {{some of the most}} important problems of stent implantation: the late restenosis. These stents made of poly-L-lactic acid cause a very subtle acoustic shadow (compared to the metallic ones) making difficult the automatic detection and measurements in images. In this paper, we propose a novel approach based on a cascade of GentleBoost classifiers to detect the <b>stent</b> <b>struts</b> using structural features to code the information of the different subregions of the struts. A stochastic gradient descent method is applied to optimize the overall performance of the detector. Validation results of struts detection are very encouraging with an average F-measure of 81 %.

Optical coherence tomography (OCT) has 10 times greater resolution than intravascular ultrasound and thus appears to be a valuable modality for the assessment of <b>stent</b> <b>strut</b> coverage. The LEADERS trial was a multi-centre, randomized comparison of a biolimus-eluting stent (BES) with biodegradable polymer with a sirolimus-eluting stent (SES) using a durable polymer.

We describe {{for the first time}} two patients with very late vascular response after carotid artery stenting that exhibit two different patterns of low-signal intensity (LSI), “ill-appearing” neointima: the first patient shows layered LSI neointima leading to stent restenosis, coupled with the presence of intraluminal thrombus, whereas the second patient demonstrates another pattern of non-restenotic LSI <b>stent</b> <b>strut</b> coverage, suggestive of lipid laden neointima (ie, “neoatherosclerosis”), recently associated with stent failure in coronary arteries...|$|E

40|$|This {{manuscript}} {{gives an}} overview of a new framework for modelling multi-component, mesh-like structures such as cardiovascular (endovascular) stents. By using dimension reduction and multi-scale approaches, a metallic, multi-component, mesh-like structure is described by a mathematical model {{which is in the}} form of a hyperbolic net problem. This contrasts classical approaches in bioengineering in which a stent is modelled as a single, 3 D elastic body, using commercial software packages based on 3 D finite element method structure approximations. Simulating slender <b>stent</b> <b>struts</b> using 3 D approaches is computationally very expensive, typically producing simulation results with poor accuracy due to the insufficient mesh refinement imposed by the large memory requirements associated with the use of 3 D meshes to approximate the slender <b>stent</b> <b>struts.</b> The approach presented in this manuscript is based on approximating the slender <b>stent</b> <b>struts</b> as 1 D curved rods modelled by a system of 1 D hyperbolic conservation laws. The slender curved rods are combined into a 3 D hyperbolic stent net via certain geometric conditions, and via the contact conditions describing the physics of the interaction between the rods. Numerical simulation of the resulting stent net is simpler and substantially cheaper, providing a manageable and simple framework for the studies of stents mechanical properties and for the studies of optimal stent design. In this manuscript we begin by formulating the time-dependent, evolution problem for...|$|R
40|$|SummaryBackgroundLong-term {{results of}} {{brachytherapy}} of coronary arteries {{may be influenced}} by inhomogeneity of the dose distribution. The dose distribution perturbations due to the presence of <b>stent</b> <b>struts,</b> guide wires and calcium deposits were therefore investigated. AimThe aim {{of the study was to}} investigate dose distribution perturbations due to the presence of <b>stent</b> <b>struts,</b> guide wire and calcium deposits during the irradiation. Both experimental and calculational techniques were applied to elucidate these influences. Materials/MethodsThe measurements were carried out with radiochromic foil in a phantom in the presence and absence of the stent and the guide wire. Due to the measurements being limited by the thickness of the detecting foil, the radial dose distribution with or without the metallic stent components were also performed using the MCNP Monte Carlo code. The same code was used to measure the influence of cholesterol plaques on dose distribution in the vessel walls. ResultsA large dose reduction in the area shielded by the guide wire was observed. The presence of the stent caused a 15 % dose reduction behind the struts. The dose reduction caused by calcium deposits ranged from 11 % to 32 %. ConclusionsThese facts may increase the probability of late restenosis after irradiation due to underdosage. The inhomogeneity occurring behind the guide wire, <b>stent</b> <b>struts</b> and calcium deposits should be taken into account in the analysis of dose distributions for clinical applications...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe {{present a}} case of {{successful}} percutaneous revascularization of a chronic total coronary occlusion due to in-stent restenosis. The CrossBoss catheter (BridgePoint Medical, Minneapolis, MN, USA) was used initially because it {{is reported to be}} effective in this setting with a low risk of exiting occluded stents. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of a CrossBoss penetrating through <b>stent</b> <b>struts</b> into the subintimal space. The case was completed via the retrograde approach with ‘rendezvous in coronary’. <Learning objective: Recognize the potential of the CrossBoss catheter to exit between <b>stent</b> <b>struts</b> within chronic total occlusions. Appreciate the need to check the position of the CrossBoss catheter with respect to stents within a chronic total occlusion. Identify the potential for ‘rendezvous in coronary’ within the subintimal space with the CrossBoss catheter and a retrograde guidewire. ...|$|R
