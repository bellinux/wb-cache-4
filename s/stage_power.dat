500|$|Qualifying {{took place}} over three rounds: the drivers were split into two groups for the first round, in which the top six from each group progressed to the next round. Dixon was the fastest from the first group, {{followed}} by Pagenaud and Hunter-Reay within half a second of his time. Wilson, Sébastien Bourdais and Sato were the other drivers {{to advance to the}} second round. In the second group, Power set the fastest overall time in the first round, and Alex Tagliani was close behind him, also setting a faster time than Dixon. Graham Rahal, E.J.

50|$|This {{proposed}} launch {{system would}} come in two variants, the Ariane 6.1 and the Ariane 6.2. While both would use a cryogenic main <b>stage</b> <b>powered</b> by a Vulcain 2 engine and two P145 solid boosters, the Ariane 6.1 would feature a cryogenic upper <b>stage</b> <b>powered</b> by the Vinci engine and boost up to 8500 kg to GTO, while the Ariane 6.2 would use a lower-cost hypergolic upper <b>stage</b> <b>powered</b> by the Aestus engine.

50|$|Circlotrons, unlike minimalistic {{single-ended}} amplifiers, need {{to employ}} quite complex balanced input and driver stages delivering at least 100V peak-to-peak voltage {{and able to}} drive relatively high capacitance loads (due {{to the number of}} paralleled power triodes and associated long wiring). The first requirement is typically solved with a long-tailed cascode stage (2 or 3 double triodes), the second - with two cathode followers inserted between the driver stage and the power stage.

50|$|In the Malta group, {{water from}} the Rottau {{reservoir}} down in the Möll River Valley is pumped via the Main stage (Rottau) to the Galgenbichl reservoir below the Kölnbrein. Along the tunneled route, the Gösskar reservoir, and various tributaries provide additional water via pipeline as well. Water storage in the Galgenbichl reservoir is eventually pumped via the Upper storage pumped-storage station into the Kölnbrein reservoir. When generating electricity, {{water from the}} upper Kölnbrein reservoir is released about 200 m {{back down to the}} Upper <b>stage</b> <b>power</b> plant. The upper stage consists of two reversible Francis turbine generators with a total installed capacity of 120 MW.
