40|$|We compute cosmological {{perturbations}} for {{a generic}} self-gravitating media described by four derivatively- coupled scalar fields. Depending {{on the internal}} symmetries of the action for the scalar fields, one can describe perfect fluids, superfluids, solids and <b>supersolids</b> media. Symmetries dictate both dynamical and thermodynamical properties of the media. Generically, scalar perturbations include, besides the gravitational potential, an additional non-adiabatic mode associated with the entropy per particle σ. While perfect fluids and solids are adiabatic with σ constant in time, superfluids and <b>supersolids</b> feature a non-trivial dynamics for σ. Special classes of isentropic media with zero σ can also be found. Tensor modes become massive for solids and <b>supersolids.</b> Such an effective approach {{can be used to}} give a very general and symmetry driven modelling of the dark sector.

50|$|Supersolids {{may also}} have been {{discovered}} in 2004 by physicists at Penn State University. When helium-4 is cooled below about 200 mK under high pressures, a fraction (~1%) of the solid appears to become superfluid. By quench cooling or lengthening the annealing time, thus increasing or decreasing the defect density respectively, it was shown, via torsional oscillator experiment, that the <b>supersolid</b> fraction could be made to range from 20% to completely non-existent. This suggested that the <b>supersolid</b> nature of helium-4 is not intrinsic to helium-4 but a property of helium-4 and disorder. Some emerging theories posit that the <b>supersolid</b> signal observed in helium-4 was actually an observation of either a superglass stateor intrinsically superfluid grain boundaries in the helium-4 crystal.|$|E

50|$|Prior to 2007, many theorists {{performed}} calculations {{indicating that}} vacancies cannot exist at zero temperature in solid helium-4. While {{there is some}} debate, it seems more doubtful that what the experiments observed was the <b>supersolid</b> state. Indeed, further experimentation, including that by Kim and Chan, has also cast some doubt {{on the existence of}} a true <b>supersolid.</b> One experiment found that repeated warming followed by slow cooling of the sample causes the effect to disappear. This annealing process removes flaws in the crystal structure. Furthermore, most samples of helium-4 contain a small amount of helium-3. When some of this helium-3 is removed, the superfluid transition occurs at a lower temperature, which suggests that the superflow is involved with actual fluid moving along imperfections in the crystal rather than a property of the perfect crystal.|$|E
