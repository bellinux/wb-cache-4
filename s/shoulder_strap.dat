25|$|Other accordions, {{such as the}} {{diatonic}} button accordion, {{have only}} a single <b>shoulder</b> <b>strap</b> and a right hand thumb strap. All accordions have a (mostly adjustable) leather strap on the left-hand manual to keep the player's hand in position while drawing the bellows. There are also straps {{above and below the}} bellows to keep it securely closed when the instrument is not playing.|$|E
25|$|While one cannot always {{identify}} the position/job of a soldier, two optional factors help make this identification: an aiguillette {{attached to the}} left <b>shoulder</b> <b>strap</b> and shirt pocket, and a pin indicating the soldier's work type (usually given by a professional course). Other pins may indicate the corps or additional courses taken. Finally, an optional battle pin indicates a war that a soldier has fought in.|$|E
25|$|A {{golf bag}} {{is used to}} {{transport}} golf clubs and the player's other or personal equipment. Golf bags have several pockets designed for carrying equipment and supplies such as tees, balls, and gloves. Golf bags can be carried, pulled on a trolley or harnessed to a motorized golf cart during play. Golf bags have both a hand strap and <b>shoulder</b> <b>strap</b> for carrying, and sometimes have retractable legs that allow the bag to stand upright when at rest.|$|E
25|$|Early scuba {{sets were}} usually {{provided}} with a plain harness of <b>shoulder</b> <b>straps</b> and waist belt. The waist belt buckles were usually quick-release, and <b>shoulder</b> <b>straps</b> sometimes had adjustable or quick release buckles. Many harnesses {{did not have a}} backplate, and the cylinders rested directly against the diver's back.|$|R

25|$|The {{shirt was}} long-sleeved and neatly folded up, unlike the short-sleeved {{versions}} adopted for the no. 3 dress of the SPF. The sleeves were rolled {{down when the}} sun sets, and rolled up again when the sun rises. GC troopers continued to wear aluminium badges of rank, which were worn on the right sleeve, 11.5 centimetres below the right <b>shoulder</b> <b>strap.</b> Constables wore aluminium bars at the outer edges of the shoulder straps. The dark blue trousers were secured by the two-pronged black leather Garrison Belt, and completed by standard-issued black leather boots.|$|E
25|$|A {{string trimmer}} is a powered {{handheld}} device {{that uses a}} flexible monofilament line instead of a blade for cutting grass and trimming other plants near objects. It consists of a cutting head {{at the end of}} a long shaft with a handle or handles and sometimes a <b>shoulder</b> <b>strap.</b> String trimmers powered by an internal combustion engine have the engine on the opposite end of the shaft from the cutting head while electric string trimmers typically have an electric motor in the cutting head. Used frequently in lawn and garden care, the string trimmer is more popularly known by the brandnames Weedeater or Weedwhacker. The string trimmer was invented in 1971 by George Ballas of Houston, Texas.|$|E
25|$|A pin {{attached}} to the beret identifies a soldier's corps. Soldiers serving in staffs above corps level are often identified by the General Corps pin, despite not officially belonging to it, or the pin of a related corps. New recruits undergoing basic training (tironut) {{do not have a}} pin. Beret colors are also often indicative of the soldier's corps, although most non-combat corps do not have their own beret, and sometimes wear the color of the corps to which the post they're stationed in belongs. Individual units are identified by a shoulder tag {{attached to}} the left <b>shoulder</b> <b>strap.</b> Most units in the IDF have their own tags, although those that do not, generally use tags identical to their command's tag (corps, directorate, or regional command).|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, {{several of}} hide's {{friends and colleagues}} stated that they {{believed}} the auto-strangulation {{to have been an}} accident, among them X Japan co-founder Yoshiki and former X bassist Taiji. This notion is supported by the fact that no suicide note was left and Taiji theorizes in his autobiography, that at the night of his death, hide may have been practicing a technique to relieve upper back and neck pains which guitarists can suffer from continuous use of a <b>shoulder</b> <b>strap.</b> The technique involved was practiced by the X Japan members during their touring days and required the use of a towel and a door knob or handle. According to Taiji, hide may have fallen asleep in his intoxicated state, becoming caught and strangling himself.|$|E
25|$|Backpacks {{in general}} fall {{into one of}} four categories: frameless, {{external}} frame, internal frame, and bodypack. A pack frame, when present, serves to support the pack and distribute the weight of its contents across the body more appropriately, by transferring much of the weight to the hips and legs. Most of the weight is therefore taken off the shoulders, reducing the chance of injury from <b>shoulder</b> <b>strap</b> pressure (many backpacks equipped solely with shoulder straps can affect the posture of a person carrying more than 14kg (30lbs)), as well as being less restrictive of the upper body range of motion. Most backpacks are capable of being closed with either a buckle mechanism, a zipper, or a dry-bag type closure though a few models use a drawstring fitted with a cord lock for the main compartment.|$|E
25|$|The council {{shoulder}} patch (known as the CSP) is an arc-shaped patch worn {{at the top}} of {{the sleeve}} that identifies the local council. Below this, Scouts at the unit level wear a unit number and units with veteran status may wear a veteran unit bar above the numbers. Lone Cub Scouts and Lone Scouts wear the Lone Scout emblem in place of the unit numeral. On the new (2008) style official shirt, the badge of office is centered on the pocket, but on the older official uniform shirts, the badge of office is centered and touching the bottom of the unit numeral, or centered 4inches below the shoulder seam. When earned for the current position, the green lettering Trained leader strip is centered {{at the top of}} the pocket flap on the new style official shirt, but on the older official uniform shirts, the red lettering Trained leader strip is centered immediately below and touching the badge of office. Qualified commissioners may wear the Commissioner Arrowhead Honor in the bottom-most position (or if wearing the first version of the Centennial shirt, immediately below the Council Shoulder Strip in the location where a unit number would be worn). Youth who are serving as a Den Chief may wear a Den Chief cord around the left shoulder and under the <b>shoulder</b> <b>strap</b> instead of the emblem. Den Chiefs who earn the Den Chief Service Award may wear the service award cord in addition to the den chief cord, and may continue to wear it for as long as they are a youth.|$|E

500|$|Before the Second World War broke out, elastic {{materials}} were rationed and unavailable for clothing. Israel Pilot designed an improved cup with a diagonal slash, <b>shoulder</b> <b>strap</b> attachment. This innovation on existing bra design provided more comfort {{and freedom of}} movement for the wearer. He also coined the name [...] "Wonder-Bra" [...] in 1935.|$|E
500|$|Israel Pilot's patent , {{granted in}} 1941, allowed for greater <b>shoulder</b> <b>strap</b> {{elasticity}} by cutting the fabric {{so that the}} weave has the greatest stretch (cutting on the [...] "bias"). The photographs show the original patent sketches and close-ups of a bra made in the U.S. by D'Amour. The model is wearing a rare 1950s version of this original Wonder-Bra design.|$|E
500|$|Holsters for the Type 94 pistol were {{generally}} made from either pigskin or cowhide leather and ranged in color from tan to dark reddish brown. Holsters faced the same degradation in quality as the Type 94 pistol. As supplies of leather were exhausted in Japan, holsters manufactured in 1944 became fabricated from olive drab fabric. The Type 94 pistol holster is distinguishable from other Japanese holsters having a pointed closure flap and a vertically positioned magazine pouch. The pouch tow has a narrow extension {{to accommodate a}} cleaning rod. The majority of holsters were made in civilian owned tanneries with some ink stamped with arsenal and inspection marks. A belt loop and two <b>shoulder</b> <b>strap</b> [...] "D" [...] rings are provided on {{the rear of the}} holster and are made from brass, galvanized steel, or nickel plating.|$|E

2500|$|In 1884 Portrait of Madame X, a {{portrait}} painting by John Singer Sargent of American-born Paris socialite, Virginie Amélie Avegno Gautreau, {{was criticized for}} depicting her in a sleek black dress displaying what was considered scandalous cleavage and her right <b>shoulder</b> <b>strap</b> fallen off her shoulder. The controversy {{was so great that}} he reworked the painting to move the <b>shoulder</b> <b>strap</b> from her upper arm to her shoulder, and Sargent left Paris for London in 1884. In 1908, a single pad made of rubber or a [...] "bust form" [...] was advertised that was to be worn inside the front of the bodice to make cleavage virtually undetectable.|$|E
