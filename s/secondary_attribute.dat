50|$|Throughout history {{there has}} been a {{separation}} between the roles and relationships that men and women play. These socially structured {{differences between men and women}} have contradicted each other at times. Fashion has picked up on the tensions left by these contradictions as well. The symbolic separation of men and women is fundamental to the history of dress. As time has gone by, the forms of clothing (colors, fabrics and shapes) have changed, but the idea of gender difference has survived. From an early point in life, children learn to differentiate between a male and a female based on clothing and hairstyles. An example this may be attributed to television cartoons where superheroines are pictured with strong and muscular bodies. However; due to their clothing, they portray an image or an idea to the viewer of being sexy or attractive, therefore putting her physical strength as a <b>secondary</b> <b>attribute.</b>|$|E

40|$|Motivated by the {{increasing}} prominence of loosely-coupled systems, such as mobile and sensor networks, which are characterised by intermittent connectivity and volatile data, we study the tagging of data with so-called expiration times. More specifically, when data are inserted into a database, {{they may be}} tagged with time values indicating when they expire, i. e., when they are regarded as stale or invalid and thus are no longer {{considered part of the}} database. In a number of applications, expiration times are known and can be assigned at insertion time. We present data structures and algorithms for online management of data tagged with expiration times. The algorithms are based on fully functional, persistent treaps, which are a combination of binary search trees with respect to a primary attribute and heaps with respect to a <b>secondary</b> <b>attribute.</b> The primary attribute implements primary keys, and the <b>secondary</b> <b>attribute</b> stores expiration times in a minimum heap, thus keeping a priority queue of tuples to expire. A detailed and comprehensive experimental study demonstrates the well-behavedness and scalability of the approach as well as its efficiency with respect to a number of competitors.

Our theory characterizes the distortionary costs and potential benefits of attribute basing. To test our theoretical predictions, we exploit quasi-experiments in Japanese fuel econ-omy regulations, under which fuel-economy targets are step functions of vehicle weight. Using bunching analysis, we identify large distortions in vehicle weight. We then develop a method that leverages double-notched policies to conduct welfare analysis. We evaluate policy alterna-tives and quantify the important welfare trade-offs created by attribute-based policies...|$|E

Attributes {{are divided into}} primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>attributes.</b> Primary attributes have a base chance to succeed of 12 while <b>secondary</b> <b>attributes</b> have a base chance to succeed of 18. The game's referee, the Castle Keeper, adds a challenge level to the base and the resulting number, the challenge class, is the target number required to succeed at a check. The player adds the character's level, any attribute bonuses and class bonuses to the roll. If the result after bonuses equals or exceeds the challenge class, the player succeeds. Except for combat, the Siege Engine is desired for use for anything that requires a check in the game.|$|R

These <b>secondary</b> <b>attributes</b> are Attack, the physical strength of Sword skills, Magic, the magical strength of Magic skills, Defense, the resistance to enemy attacks, Hit or Attack Rate, the accuracy of all the player's attacks and Defense Rate, the rate at which enemy attacks are fully evaded or dodged.|$|R

Fuzzy integrals of Sugeno and Choquet are used as aggregation operators of secondary attributes.

Retrieval using secondary attributes depends on several factors. For <b>secondary</b> <b>attribute</b> retrieval, the linear structures—inverted lists, multilists, doubly linked lists—and the recently proposed nonlinear tree structures—multiple attribute tree (MAT), K-d tree (kdT) —have their individual merits. It is shown in this paper that, of the two tree structures, MAT possesses several features of a systematic data structure for external file organisation which make it superior to kdT. Analytic estimates for the complexity of node searchers, in MAT and kdT for several types of queries, are developed and compared...|$|E

40|$|Existing {{evidence}} suggests that preferences are affected by whether a price is presented as one all-inclusive expense or partitioned into a set of mandatory charges. To explain this phenomenon, we introduce a new mechanism whereby price partitioning affects a consumer's perception of the secondary (i. e., nonfocal) benefits derived from a transaction. Four experiments {{support the hypothesis that}} a partitioned price increases the amount of attention paid to <b>secondary</b> <b>attributes</b> tagged with distinct price components. Characteristics of the offered <b>secondary</b> <b>attributes</b> such as their perceived value, relative importance, and evaluability can therefore determine whether price partitioning stimulates or hinders demand. Beyond its descriptive and prescriptive implications, this theory contributes to the emerging notion that pricing can transform, as well as capture, the utility of an offer. consumer behavior, pricing, price partitioning, attention, information processing, framing effects, multi-attribute utility...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a new cosimulation {{algorithm}} for simulating a primary variable using one or several secondary attributes known exhaustively on the domain. At each node {{of the grid}} to be simulated, two conditional distribution functions are inferred. The first one comes from the available conditioning data of the main attribute using, for instance, a multi-Gaussian framework. The second one is the distribution function of the main attribute conditioned to the co-located value of the <b>secondary</b> <b>attribute.</b> Using a conjunction of probabilities approach, these two distribution functions are then combined into a single one from which an outcome is drawn. The paper discusses the probabilistic model underlying this approach and illustrates its performances using both synthetic and actual field data.

30|$|Hillslope {{length is}} {{directly}} related to drainage density (Bogaart and Troch, 2006), which measures the degree of dissection of the hillslope calculated as the total length of the channel network divided by the drainage area (Tucker and Bras, 1998). In the case of a random channel network, drainage density equals approximately twice the hillslope length. A long hillslope generates more weathering products than a short hillslope, and the long total channel length that comes with a long hillslope will favor a rapid evacuation of eroded material. A related <b>secondary</b> <b>attribute</b> is the wetness index, or topographic wetness index (TWI; Beven and Kirkby, 1979) used in TOPMODEL, which {{is a function of the}} upstream contributing area for a certain point and the slope at the same position, and allows for modeling flow paths and characterization of vegetation patterns.

However, the need to ingest content rapidly and make it searchable immediately while supporting low-latency, high-throughput query evaluation, as well as the geo-distributed nature and weak consistency guarantees of modern storage systems pose several challenges to the implementation of indexing and search systems.

40|$|Distributed {{key-value}} {{stores are}} now a standard component of high-performance web services and cloud computing applications. While key-value stores offer significant performance and scalability advantages compared to traditional databases, they achieve these properties through a restricted API that limits object retrieval—an object can only be retrieved by the (primary and only) key under which it was inserted. This paper presents HyperDex, a novel distributed key-value store that provides a unique search primitive that enables queries on secondary attributes. The key insight behind HyperDex {{is the concept of}} hyperspace hashing in which objects with multiple attributes are mapped into a multidimensional hyperspace. This mapping leads to efficient implementations not only for retrieval by primary key, but also for partially-specified <b>secondary</b> <b>attribute</b> searches and range queries. A novel chaining protocol enables the system to achieve strong consistency, maintain availability and guarantee fault tolerance. An evaluation of the full system shows that HyperDex is 12 - 13 × faster than Cassandra and MongoDB for finding partially specified objects.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} “attribute-based regulations, ” {{in which}} regulatory compliance depends upon some <b>secondary</b> <b>attribute</b> {{that is not}} the intended target of the regulation. Such policies have the potential benefit of harmonizing marginal costs of regulatory compliance across firms, but also create perverse incentives to distort the attribute upon which compliance depends. We develop a theoretical framework that characterizes the welfare implications of attribute-basing, including its potential benefits and costs. We then test our theoretical predictions by exploiting quasi-experimental variation in Japanese fuel economy regulations, which provide key empirical advantages over data from other countries. We exploit the fact that the fuel-economy targets are downward-sloping step functions of vehicle weight. Our bunching analysis reveals large distor-tions to vehicle weight that were induced by the policy. We then leverage panel data on vehicle redesigns to empirically investigate the welfare implications of attribute-basing, including both potential benefits and likely costs. This latter analysis concerns a “double notched ” policy— vehicles are eligible for an incentive if they are above a step function in the two-dimensional fuel economy by weight space. We develop a new method for analyzing such double notched policie...|$|E
40|$|The {{burial of}} nonpolar surface area {{is known to}} enhance {{markedly}} the conformational stability of proteins. The contribution from the burial of polar surface area is less clear. Here, {{we report on the}} tolerance to substitution of Ser 75 of bovine pancreatic ribonuclease (RNase A), a residue that has the unusual attributes of being buried, conserved, and polar. To identify variants that retain biological function, we used a genetic selection based on the intrinsic cytotoxicity of ribonucleolytic activity. Cell growth at 30 °C, 37 °C, and 44 °C correlated with residue size, indicating that the primary attribute of Ser 75 is its small size. The side-chain hydroxyl group of Ser 75 forms a hydrogen bond with a main-chain nitrogen. The conformational stability of the S 75 A variant, which lacks this hydrogen bond, was diminished by ΔΔG = 2. 5 kcal/mol. Threonine, which can reinstate this hydrogen bond, provided a catalytically active RNase A variant at higher temperatures than did some smaller residues (including aspartate), indicating that a <b>secondary</b> <b>attribute</b> of Ser 75 is the ability of its uncharged side chain to accept a hydrogen bond.
