50|$|In 1912, Congress {{passed the}} River and Harbor Act, which {{authorized}} the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to start {{work on a}} series of improvements at Manistee Harbor. These included a series of dredging projects, the shortening of the south pier, and the construction of a 1300 foot south breakwater, with a <b>shore</b> <b>connection</b> about 1,200 ft long. The Corps of Engineers contracted Greiling Brothers Company to construct the breakwater, and work began in May 1913. A number of cribs were put in place through 1916 and the <b>shore</b> <b>connection</b> was completed in 1917/18 by John Ginzel. The project, including construction of the superstructure, was finally completed in 1920. The wood decking of the superstructure was replaced by concrete in 1933.|$|E
50|$|Cold ironing, or <b>shore</b> <b>connection,</b> {{shore-to-ship}} power (SSP) or alternative {{maritime power}} (AMP), {{is the process}} of providing shoreside electrical power to a ship at berth while its main and auxiliary engines are turned off. Cold ironing permits emergency equipment, refrigeration, cooling, heating, lighting and other equipment to receive continuous electrical power while the ship loads or unloads its cargo. Shorepower is a general term to describe supply of electric power to ships, small craft, aircraft and road vehicles while stationary.|$|E

40|$|<b>Shore</b> power <b>connection,</b> a {{practice}} whereby shore-side electrical power is provided to vessels at berth in a port, {{is set to}} play a major role in shaping the future energy requirements of the commercial shipping industry. Short circuit level compatibility of systems is a problem when a ship power system is connected to a shore electrical distribution system. A method that is able to evaluate the shore-side and ship-side impedances and determine the prospective short circuit current level is essential. This paper aims at presenting a methodology for calculating the short circuit current in the <b>shore</b> power <b>connection</b> system. Two analysis models: IEC std. 61363 - 1 and IEC std. 60909 - 0 combined with IEC std. 60909 - 0 are developed and used in this paper for short circuit current analysis. Performance of the proposed method is validated by short circuit current calculation results gathered from several visiting ship scenarios in a practical <b>shore</b> power <b>connection</b> system. The proposed method can provide engineers with useful information about the prospective magnitude of short circuit currents, as well as on the effect of shore supply on ship power system, to assist them in ensuring short circuit level compatibility and allowing the selection and setting of protective devices...|$|R
40|$|The colloquial term `cold-ironing&# 039; {{refers to}} the <b>shore</b> power <b>connection</b> when a ship is at berth. Even though, cold-ironing is not new to the {{shipping}} industry only recently it received more attention, mainly due to strict emission regulations. When a ship receives shore power, its emissions can be eliminated and thus cold-ironing is becoming a popular service sought by ships that berth at emission controlled ports. Generally, the <b>shore</b> power <b>connection</b> is available only at berth and thus emissions from the ships that are anchored {{in and around the}} port is still a significant issue. This paper proposes a floating power platform for `Mobile Cold-ironing&# 039; of anchored ships. In the proposed system, a fuel cell - battery hybrid system is used as the source.

50|$|The first {{connection}} attempted was a HAIS pipe {{which was}} laid on 10 October. Vital lessons had been learned from earlier {{experience and the}} difficulties in making the shore connections were overcome. However, worsening weather and waning official enthusiasm dampened progress. Fuel pumping was delayed until 27 October and by December only four HAIS pipe were working and these had to run at a relatively low pressure resulting in daily delivery of just 700 tons of fuel. Despite official doubts, PLUTO continued. HAMEL pipe was more difficult to bring ashore and especially so in poor weather; the problem was solved by adding lengths of HAIS pipe onto the ends of a HAMEL pipeline as it was wound onto a conundrum greatly simplifying <b>shore</b> <b>connection.</b>|$|E
40|$|The current paper {{pretends to}} offer a global vision about the actual {{situation}} of the regulations and requirements applied to High Voltage <b>Shore</b> <b>Connection</b> (HVSC) systems, also known as cold ironing. To develop the entire study, the following Classification Societies rules have been consulted: ABS - High Voltage Shore Connections; BV- High-Voltage <b>Shore</b> <b>Connection</b> System; DNV-Electrical Shore Connections; DNV-GL- Rules for classification of ships; LLOYD’S REGISTER-Rules and regulations for the classification of ships and RINA-Rules for the classification of ships. In the way to accomplish the proposed objective, the mentioned rules have been compared including all the specific aspects and regulations related with “the shore side” of the entire installation. These requirements are also compared with the international standard ISO/IEC/IEEE 80005 - 1 High Voltage <b>Shore</b> <b>Connection</b> Systems and show the grade of accuracy provided by each Classification Society against that standard. Finally, {{the results of the}} comparison show that many of the studied rules focus their rules just on the ship side of the installation or just provide some general recommendations for the shore side. According to that, the shore side is considered such as not part of the ship and consequently is not considered in their rules...|$|E

Arrayed across a seaway or in fast flowing rivers, shrouded turbines are cabled to <b>shore</b> for <b>connection</b> to a grid or a community. Alternatively the property of the shroud that produces an accelerated flow velocity across the turbine allows tidal flows formerly too slow for commercial use to be used for energy production.|$|R

40|$|Submerged FloatingTunnels, {{also known}} asArchimedes Bridges, {{are a new}} {{structural}} conceptual way for strait and waterways crossing, which are catching more and more worldwide attention. In this paper, a 3 D finite element model is developed in a commercial finite element code, accounting for material and geometrical nonlinearities, soil-structure interaction and multiple-support seismic excitation, to give a broad angle view on the structural behavior under seismic motion. Elastic-plastic springs at tunnel shores, simulating passive control devices, are applied to reduce relative displacements between the tunnel and shores. Beside the traditional earthquake loading on the structure foundations’ connections, the motion transmission from the seabed through the water (called seaquake) is newly introduced as an additional hydrodynamic pressure working on the floating tunnel. The velocity field due to seaquake is derived from its velocity potential which is deduced from the wave equation considering the boundary conditions. The force on the moving tunnel body in the oscillatory flow, simulating the seaquake, is modeled by using Morison’s equations. A comparison between transient dynamic response in case of ‘earthquake’ and ‘earthquake plus seaquake’ is also given, which shows how seaquake loading affects the responses of anchor bars, <b>shore</b> <b>connections</b> and tunnel sections in terms of stresses, strains and displacements. The outcome indicates a larger displacement capacity is required to the control system in the mitigation of dangerous structural responses, {{as well as the}} significant role played by the seaquake loading source, and highlights the need of further investigations on seaquake effects...|$|R

40|$|High-voltage <b>shore</b> <b>connection</b> (HVSC) is a {{technical}} solution to supply ships at berth {{in an economic}} way while reducing air pollution in city ports. When multiple megawatt-HVSC installations are to be exercised, electric power has to be delivered to the port from a primary high-voltage (HV) line at voltages higher than 100 kV. In this case, large earth fault currents can arise on the HV side, flowing through the port earthing system and the bonded ship hulls. Due to these faults, possible dangerous voltage gradients in sea water around the bonded ship hulls may occur. This phenomenon is pointed out and investigated in this paper to identify possible safety issues in some given scenarios...|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, a {{numerical}} analysis is performed {{to investigate the}} dynamic characteristics of submerged floating tunnels (SFTs) under seismic wave passage effect. The large mass method is examined firstly and then used to simulate numerically the dynamic response of SFTs. It is found that the dynamic response of SFTs is influenced remarkably by the multi-support excitation with the seismic wave passage effect and varies with the velocity of seismic waves in a non-monotone way. The numerical {{results show that the}} response under the multi-support excitation is much larger than that under the simultaneous excitation except for the displacement response in some velocities, and there exists a peak velocity of seismic waves that corresponds the maximum response of the structure. In addition, for every velocity, the most remarkable response appears near the <b>shore</b> <b>connection</b> corresponding to output end of the seismic wave. This finding reflects the unique behavior of SFTs under the multi-support excitations and is meaningful to the seismic design of SFTs as well as other periodic long-span structures...|$|E

40|$|For {{a variety}} of reasons, it is {{becoming}} an increasingly common requirement for ships to shut down ship generators and connect to high voltage shore power {{for as long as}} practicable while in port. Ship electrical equipment shall only be connected to shore supplies that are able to maintain harbor distribution system voltage quality. Voltage drop, which is produced by the possible loading conditions of a ship when connected to a shore supply, may result in unsatisfactory operation of, and damage to, electrical and electronic equipment on board and thus, must be considered in the harbor distribution system design in order to comply with the requirements of international standards. A simple and fast method able to estimate the expected magnitude of voltage drops and provide information about the effectiveness of the various mitigation methods is essential. This paper presents the methodology and results for evaluation of the voltage drops of a practical harbor electrical distribution system with high voltage <b>shore</b> <b>connection</b> (HVSC). The potential voltage drops of the implemented HVSC are quantified using standard analytical formulas. Sensitivity analysis is performed to determine the critical parameters that significantly affect voltage drops. The parameters that have great improvement benefits should have high priority for implementation in other distribution systems with HVSC. The results obtained in this paper can provide engineers with useful information regarding the actual magnitude of voltage drops, {{as well as on the}} effectiveness of mitigation options for voltage drops, which would greatly enhance HV shore supply quality...|$|E
40|$|In 1997 the Jamuna Bridge was {{finished}} and came into use. As this bridge is a <b>shore</b> <b>connection</b> {{for one of}} the largest rivers in the world, extensive river training works were designed and built, mainly to avoid outflanking of the bridge by the river. It was especially the braiding character of the river with its ever-changing pattern, which made it difficult to predict the morphological behaviour. The river training works incorporated two guide-bunds, which lead the river through the contraction at the location of the bridge. This made it possible to cross the flood plain by constructing earthen abutments, leaving a bridge span of 5 km instead of 15 km. The narrowing of the river will lead to morphological changes. Deepening of the riverbed by means of local scour can be expected. To protect the toe of the revetment against this scour, a more or less traditional solution has been applied: the falling apron. A falling apron is a stack of granular material at the toe of a revetment, which will launch onto the slope of the scour hole when the revetment is undermined. The established slope will then be protected by a layer of rock, which will retain the bed material and prevent the formation of a slope that is too steep. To understand more about the setting process and to determine the resulting slope, a physical model was built and tested in a flume. Three different rock sizes were examined and two different initial configurations. It was found that the slope angle after setting was 1 : 2 for all experiments. Surprisingly, only a small amount of apron rock was actually used. This was because just a single layer of material covered the scour slope. This single layer does not retain the material like a properly designed filter, but it does slow down the erosion of sand from under the apron. Two parts of the falling apron were discerned: the waiting part consisting of the stack of unused material and the 'launched part', which is the rock layer covering the slope. This single layer has important consequences for the functioning of the apron. The grading used at the Jamuna Bridge was extra wide. The idea was that when a thick layer was launched on the slope, the fines would wash out of the top layer. A filter structure would then develop with large grains in the upper layer and fines (and large grains) in the lower layer. This theoretical case was not found in the model. The resulting slope appeared to have settled evenly and over the complete scour depth. No unprotected sand slope was observed during the experiments. The rock layer follows the bed level and extra rock is added from the waiting part of the apron when the layer slides down. This mechanism of scour at the toe and rock launching at the top implies that sand transport through the layer also occurs. The consecutive phases in the setting process showed that at different times the apron slopes lie parallel and retreat as a whole with the edge of the waiting apron. The survey data, retrieved since the Jamuna Bridge was built, were used to compare the model results with a prototype. These profiles also showed an apron slope of 1 : 2. However the thickness of the layer cannot be determined from the data. It can be seen that the apron slope follows the edge of the waiting part as it does in the model.

Several hours later, the backup generator broke down and the electrical load {{was transferred to the}} ship's battery; however, most of the battery power was needed to keep vital systems operating and to restart the reactor, so lighting and air-conditioning were shut down. Without air-conditioning, temperature and humidity in the submarine rose, reaching [...] after about ten hours. (Four men received Navy Commendation Medals for their work that night, attempting to repair the diesel generator under the extreme conditions of heat and humidity.) Eventually, it became apparent that repair of the generator would not be complete before the battery was depleted, so restart of the reactor was attempted, but by that time, there was not enough charge remaining in the battery, and it ran down before restart of the reactor could be accomplished. The captain, returning to the ship from a shore function, arrived just after the battery ran down. Since Cavalla was moored alongside, cables, borrowed from another ship in the harbor, were connected between Thresher and Cavalla, which started her diesels, providing power that enabled Thresher to restart her reactor.|$|R
