However, there are privately owned local stations that still exist, which broadcast programming originating from the stations located in Mexico City.|$|E

This series was a quick failure due to its low budget (e.g., {{recycling}} footage from the 1974 Universal Studios movie Earthquake during a Cylon attack sequence), widely panned writing, and ill-chosen time slot (Sunday evenings, a time generally reserved for family-oriented programming and, more specifically, also for the 60 Minutes newsmagazine program). The TV series also had to adhere to strict content restrictions such as {{limiting the number of}} acts of violence and being required to <b>shoehorn</b> educational content into the script and dialogue.|$|E

The Ford V8 was only 3.5 inches longer than the Alpine's 4-cylinder engine it replaced, so the primary concern was the engine's width. Like Miles, Shelby found that the Ford V8 would only just fit into the Alpine engine bay: [...] "I {{think that if the}} figure of speech about the <b>shoehorn</b> ever applied to anything, it surely did to the tight squeak in getting that 260 Ford mill into the Sunbeam engine compartment.

[...] Walt Disney Studios eventually accepted The Rocketeer because they believed the film had toyetic potential and appeal for merchandising. The Rocketeer was set to be released through the studio's Touchstone Pictures label; Stevens, Bilson, De Meo, and Dear all signed a contract which would permit {{them to make a}} trilogy of Rocketeer films. However, Disney studio chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg switched the film to a Walt Disney Pictures release. According to Stevens, [...] "immediately, Betty and anything else 'adult' went right out with the bathwater. They really tried to <b>shoehorn</b> it into a kiddie property so they could sell toys.

"Shoehorning" [...] {{has come}} to mean, mostly in American English, the act of coercing or {{pressuring}} an individual into a situation which does not leave enough room, either literally or figuratively. <b>Shoehorning</b> in a conversational context means to force someone {{to take one of}} a limited number of positions, neither of which may adequately express what the individual wants to say (a [...] "For me or against me"-scenario). <b>Shoehorning</b> in a more literal sense can express itself as pushing a number of individuals into an overfilled enclosure of space, such as a theater or a bus ("the usher shoehorned us {{into the back of the}} crowded theater").|$|R

2500|$|The {{field was}} just barely {{large enough to}} fit a {{baseball}} diamond. [...] In order to <b>shoehorn</b> even an approximation of a baseball field onto the playing surface, the left-field fence was set at only [...] from the plate.

They also expressed concern that cherished home run records, especially Babe Ruth's 1927 seasonal mark of 60, might easily fall as a result of 250-foot pop flies going over the left-field fence.

2500|$|Cook {{aimed to}} write the stories for the comic to be {{something}} that she herself would enjoy [...] "as a Pony fan and an all-ages writer", and planned to continue {{in the spirit of the}} show, avoiding the feel of a [...] "freebie Barbie comic" [...] that would otherwise be packaged with toys. She further stated that she wanted to write an all-ages book, something that parents can share and read with their children. Like the show, she had included pop cultural references that adults will get, but does not try to <b>shoehorn</b> these in. She used the first four-story arc as a means for herself to get comfortable in writing for the characters, thus bringing back an established villain as the antagonist for the first story. Cook does plan to introduce new characters and settings in later issues. She noted that the first story include dark and scary elements, but she does not consider them any darker than the show itself. At the 2013 San Diego Comic Convention, Cook commented that in considering how dark to take the stories, [...] "My personal gauge is Dark Crystal. If it’s darker than the Skeksis sucking the life out of a Podling, I don’t go there." [...] Though normally Cook would write and draw her own comics, her work in the My Little Pony comic was her first foray into writing out a script and directing others to draw out the art. She expressed pleasure at working with Price has they have worked well together in the past. However, Cook does continue to do some of the art; the first issue contains a short two-page comic written and drawn by herself.|$|E

40|$|At the Rio+ 20 Conference (June 2012), the {{biodiversity}} conservation agenda was subsumed into broader environmental issues like sustainable development, “green economy,” and climate change.

This article raises concern that these trends can marginalize important and specific aspects of biodiversity governance, including other policy tools and region-specific socio-ecological environments. Among other trends, this contributes to the marginalization of agroecosystems as habitat and matrix for biodiversity. Such agroecosystems, however, can {{have a major impact}} on conservation outcomes as they comprise a major part of terrestrial lands.
