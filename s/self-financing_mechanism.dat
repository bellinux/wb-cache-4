We focus on the amount of the fine or lottery prize needed to achieve full participation. We then propose a combined, <b>self-financing</b> <b>mechanism</b> by which the fines imposed on non-participants are used to finance the prize that is awarded by lottery to one of the individuals choosing to participate in voting. We argue that this combined mechanism has some advantages over the other two mechanisms and merits consideration. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{establishment}} of marine protected areas (MPA) {{has been a}} common government response to increasing fishing, tourism and other human activities that lead to decline in coral and marine resources. MPAs often suffer inadequacy of funds and simply become "paper parks". This study makes a case for the feasibility of a <b>self-financing</b> <b>mechanism</b> for MPAs by estimating potential surplus benefit that recreational users may gain from MPAs in Jamaica. These same recreational users in turn, {{might be willing to}} pay a small portion of that gain toward the management costs. With the help of a travel cost model and the visitors' willingness to pay (WTP) estimates, we show that the management costs of the park amount to a negligible amount; less than 0. 1 % of the annual total WTP. Furthermore, using these WTP estimates and the findings from other stakeholders' surveys (hotels, tour operators, etc.), the paper provides insights on user-supported funding policies, such as taxes and fees, which might sustain the operations of MPAs in Jamaica and the broader Caribbean region.

It was launched in September 1987 at a regional WHO meeting, where Mr Grant, director of UNICEF, dealt with the severe economic crises facing sub-Saharan Africa, the negative effects of adjustment programmes on health, and the reluctance of donors to continue to fund recurrent costs of primary health care programmes. He outlined his vision of how primary health care could be revitalized by generating funds in communities through the sales of drugs at a price considerably higher than cost.Following this speech, the African ministers of health present at the meeting adopted a resolution in which they called for the acceleration of primary health care by: * defining and implementing <b>self-financing</b> <b>mechanisms</b> at district level * encouraging social mobilization and * ensuring a regular supply of drugs. Positive experience with revolving drug funds was cited as a reason for the implementation of community financing mechanisms that rely on revenue out of the sales of drugs.|$|R
40|$|Recreation {{in natural}} areas has been {{promoted}} for numerous reasons (e. g., health, nature appreciation, education, financial gain) and leisure time spent in protected areas has increased substantially in popularity in recent decades. However, upkeep of such protected areas represents considerable financial outlay and to recoup these costs, tourism potentially provides a <b>self-financing</b> <b>mechanism</b> for ecological sustainability. In Australia, the adventure sport of canyoning has increased in popularity in the Blue Mountains National Park (Australia), part of a recently declared World Heritage Area, in parallel with an overall increase in wilderness recreation. This study sought canyoners’ perceptions of visit impacts, together with their attitudes to potential management of these unique areas. It also compares findings with American wilderness research outcomes. The results identify that {{the current level of}} traffic through the canyons was not considered to be detrimental to canyon visit enjoyment. While the findings were broadly similar, even at much lower visitation levels than American wilderness recreationists tolerate, Australian canyoners avoid heavily trafficked canyons. Although perceptions and attitudes differed with level of experience, overall, the conclusion is that the visitors encountered were tolerant of other canyoners and the discarded debris of past excursions. In this context, {{it is not surprising that}} most canyoners did not see an immediate need to implement further management restrictions. ...|$|E
40|$|This article {{deals with}} the {{long-term}} institutional diversity arguing {{that it is probably}} the peculiar result of underlying institutional complementarities between corporate ownership, legal environment and financial system. The main aim {{of this paper is to}} show, at least in general terms, how some major European patterns can be recognised in the evolution of the corporate governance of large Italian businesses. Thus, it will provide a general framework which could be useful in placing it in a wider perspective on government intervention, legal schemes and financial institutions. They were influential in shaping a national model of corporate governance as well as of capital structure, certainly with some original elements but essentially as a species of the European one. In order to shed light on this fundamental characteristic of Italian capitalism, the relationship between national big business and Europe, both as a market and as a political subject, will be considered. Over time, European firms and/or financial institutions offered a model of corporate governance or retained relevant stakes in Italian firms or banks. Europe also directly or indirectly intervened as a political and economic community by shaping or conditioning Italian corporate governance, as for instance occurred in the last two decades through the privatisation process. Two main facts seem to be relevant in categorising Italian capitalism as a part of the broader institutional model of continental Europe. First, in the long run, large firms have been dependent on resources offered by a bank-oriented financial system, such as in France and Germany, and corporate finance has largely preferred debts and outside investors as a consequence, except whenever a phase of sustained economic growth allowed a shift towards a <b>self-financing</b> <b>mechanism.</b> Second, typically by means of bailouts, State intervention and State-owned enterprise played an important role in supporting industrial sectors and banks, at least until the early 1990 s, when the European Commission and lawmakers powerfully intervened in financial regulation and globalisation processes started to exert severe pressure on State-owned enterprises via budget constraints...|$|E
40|$|Inner city blighted {{industrial}} sites are primarily {{associated with the}} general phenomenon of deindustrialization within the post-industrial inner city that is caused by spatial and functional restructuring of the industrial activity. Blighted {{industrial sites}} are vacant, obsolete, or underutilized industrial buildings, facilities and other related industrial functions and areas. Such blighted areas may have physical, functional, social, economic, and environmental impact problems both within the site, {{as well as on}} surrounding properties. Brownfield sites represent a severe form of blighted sites which include real or perceived environmental contamination. Brownfield redevelopment requires environmental clean-up to acceptable regulatory standards which may result in a costly process. The general research goal is to achieve an understanding of this complex problem context as well as to establish the pertinent planning framework for redevelopment of blighted industrial sites within the Canadian inner city. The research process includes three parts. Part One includes an extensive preliminary literature review of brownfield redevelopment case studies in Canada, United States, and the United Kingdom. It also includes an outline of general planning theory and related interdisciplinary theories. The preliminary findings of literature review reveal a multiple component interactive problem context that indicates a need for an integrative planning framework addressing multiple problem components. The preliminary research findings for the planning framework are further studied and examined in four empirical case studies included in Part Two. The specific research objectives and research questions address three constituent parts of the planning framework including the nature of the problem context, potential policy directions, and the planning process. The central research question is “what is the appropriate planning framework and approach for brownfield redevelopment given a multiple component interactive problem context? Part Three synthesizes the findings of Parts One and Two, which highlights the proposed planning framework for brownfield redevelopment, including an outline of major problems and policy directions based on impact evaluation by key participants in the empirical case studies, as well as outlining the main characteristics of the planning process. Some of the main problems and issues include site contamination and related legal liabilities, cost of site remediation that may exceed property value, stakeholders’ conflicting objectives, social stigma associated with brownfields, clarity and consistency of the environmental approval process as, community support. The proposed policy directions also represent multiple components and they are mainly as follows: •	To prepare an inventory of brownfield sites, •	To establish public-private partnership for project financing especially for site remediation, •	To develop <b>self-financing</b> <b>mechanism</b> (like TIF/TIEF) to finance cost of site remediation, •	To establish a redevelopment authority that is directly responsible for the process, •	To foster public-private-community collaboration and partnership, •	To secure accessibility of local residents to newly provided opportunities (like jobs), •	To adopt multiple-component integrative planning framework to link major problem components and planning sub-processes The research findings also highlight the planning process being manifested at two main poles including the project developer and his consulting team, the public approval authority, in addition to community residents and interest groups that are involved in the public consultation process. The development approval process is the common organizational set-up and interface for stakeholders’ involvement in the process. The main characteristics of the proposed planning process include multiple-component multi-disciplinary context consisting of interactive planning sub-processes within each component, multi-level spatial contexts, involvement of multi-stakeholders with conflicting objectives and vision, incrementally adaptive, critical time and timing context, and mixed-rationality comprehensive planning vision. This research asserts the need for addressing the multiple components of environmental, physical, economic, social, and political planning without prior bias or predominance to any of these components. This also asserts the need for multi-stakeholder public-private-community collaboration and partnership...|$|E

40|$|During {{the past}} decade, diverse {{developing}} countries have introduced radical reforms in their collection of taxes. In more than 15 countries, traditional tax departments {{have been granted}} the status of semiautonomous revenue authorities (ARAs), which are designed {{with a number of}} autonomy-enhancing features, including <b>self-financing</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> boards of directors with high-ranking public and private sector representatives, and sui generis personnel systems. The author addresses gaps in the public management and tax administration literatures by closely examining ARA reforms in Kenya, Mexico, Peru, South Africa, Uganda, and Venezuela from their inception to the early 2000 s. Using the comparative case study method, he tackles three questions. First, what has motivated the wave of ARA reforms over the past decade? The author argues that from a public management perspective, reformers intended to use autonomy to enhance bureaucratic performance in low-capacity public sectors. Second, is there a connection between autonomy and performance? Focusing on revenue collection, compliance management, taxpayer services, human resource management, and administrative costs, the author suggests that autonomy is associated with higher levels of performance. He also makes the case that higher levels of autonomy are associated with higher levels of performance. Third, if there is a connection between autonomy and performance, which specific design features matter most and why? In spite of the popularity of the ARA reform, there is no consensus on best practice in organizational design. The author offers hypotheses based on the cases about why certain designs work better than others, and makes specific recommendations {{for the next generation of}} ARA reforms.

40|$|In {{order to}} provide a {{rationale}} and mechanism for implementing responsible fisheries in practice, this paper examines the effect of establishing Regional Fishery Management Organisation (RFMO) with effective enforcement on cooperative possibilities in shared fisheries. The result shows that an increase in cooperation level is a social welfare improvement, {{and this is an}} important rationale in the establishment of RFMOs for managing shared fisheries. If an RFMO is established and participants commit full compliance (costless enforcement), the outlook for cooperation in shared fisheries is optimistic. However, the attractive incentive for asymmetric information sharing about compliance among the RFMO members may lead to non-cooperation. Therefore, the game framework is extended by introducing a <b>self-financed</b> enforcement <b>mechanism</b> to ensure compliance by the RFMO members (costly enforcement). The result demonstrates that a mechanism that RFMO members finance and empower an independent enforcement body with monitoring and sanctioning capabilities may be a solution for the protection of cooperation. In addition, at some participant’s enforcement cost level, when it increases, an RFMO requires a greater participation level to enter into force. Consequently, if an RFMO forms, it not only results in the higher level of steady-state fish stock, but also may improve participant’s rent...|$|R
40|$|My thesis {{consists}} of three chapters {{that contribute to the}} study of input misallocation and TFP growth in China. In Chapter 2, I compare the misallocation of intermediate goods to those of capital and labor, which have been extensively studied in the literature. To measure misallocation, I compute the dispersion of marginal products of intermediate goods across firms, and the potential output gains by eliminating this dispersion in China Industrial Enterprise Survey (CIES) data. Although the within-industry dispersion of marginal products of intermediates is smaller than that of capital and labor, gross output and value added gains from reallocating intermediate goods are 6 and 14 times those from capital and labor reallocations. If intermediate goods, capital and labor are reallocated to equalize their marginal products, the total value added gain in the CIES is 550 %, much greater than the 98 % obtained under the value added approach in the literature (i. e. Hsieh and Klenow, 2009). This suggests that with its 74 % revenue share and input complementarity, distortions and frictions through intermediate goods could be a promising channel to account for sizable misallocation in China’s data. I further find suggestive evidence of preorder friction: intermediate goods need half a year to pre-order, which gives rise to borrowing constraints in paying for intermediates. Similar to capital, marginal products of intermediates are found to be more dispersed among potentially constrained firms with low net worth, as one would expect if borrowing constraints exist. Motivated by the findings in Chapter 2, Chapter 3 quantifies the novel role of pre-order friction and borrowing constraints on intermediate goods in accounting for misallocation in the CIES data (Hsieh and Klenow, 2009; Brandt, Van Biesebroeck, and Zhang, 2012). With a gross output production function, I incorporate intermediate goods frictions into the firm investment model of Cooper and Haltiwanger (2006). Firms order and prepay for a fraction of intermediate goods one period in advance (pre-order), and face one borrowing constraint on capital and intermediate goods. Firms also face capital adjustment costs. I measure misallocation by the potential gross output gain as a percentage of actual gross output, if intermediate goods, capital and labor are hypothetically reallocated to equalize marginal products across firms. Over 1998 - 2007, gross output misallocation in the CIES data averages 140 percent. The model accounts for around 70 percent of this misallocation, when calibrated to key moments in firm-level debt, productivity and market share distribution in the CIES data. Half of the misallocation in the model is attributed to intermediate goods frictions: 34 percent from borrowing constraints, and 16 percent from pre-order. While borrowing constraints on capital induce small misallocation, capital adjustment costs account for the other half. Larger misallocation with intermediate goods frictions than without arises from its large gross output revenue share and recurrent need of financing. This tightens the borrowing constraint and interrupts the <b>self-financing</b> <b>mechanism</b> for capital accumulation. Further, as in Chapter 2 for the data, I find that value added approach in literature also underestimates misallocation by ignoring misallocation of intermediate goods for the mode. The importance of intermediate goods frictions in misallocation could be applicable to other countries with an underdeveloped financial system. Chapter 4 decomposes China’s fast aggregate manufacturing productivity growth into firm-level technological growth, intensive reallocation of inputs across existing firms and extensive reallocations through net entry. Following Baily, Hulten, and Campbell (1992) ’s approach of aggregate productivity decomposition, I find that extensive reallocation accounts for 93 % and 144 % of 5 -year aggregate productivity growth in 1998 - 2003 and 2002 - 2007 in the CIES. In contrast, intensive reallocation contributes - 10 % and - 93 % to the growth. These estimates are however biased by a left-censoring problem, since CIES does not survey non state owned firms with sales less than 5 million yuan. I propose a methodology accordingly to recover the three sources of growth in China’s manufacturing sector. I find that when China’s data is taken as the manufacturing universe, the role of extensive reallocation in aggregate productivity growth is overstated by a quarter to two thirds during 1998 - 2003 and 2002 - 2007. Most of the overstated magnitude in extensive reallocation is picked up by the intensive reallocation among existing firms. Compared to U. S., intensive reallocation in China’s manufacturing sector is still smaller, but larger than that directly implied in the CIES. This also indicates that the left-censoring problem in other countries should be taken into account when analyzing micro-level sources of aggregate productivity growth across countries...|$|E

The inability of authorities to precommit to a regulatory scheme creates incentives for firms not to invest and to hold-up the regulator. This paper describes a simple subsidy/tax scheme {{embedded in a}} four-stage mechanism that solves the hold-up problem. We design a self-financing subsidy/tax scheme which benefits a complying firm {{at the expense of}} a non-complying firm. In order to be credible, the subsidy and tax rates must maximize social welfare for any combination of investment decisions. We show that there exists a unique subgame perfect equilibrium in which all firms invest and no actual implementation with subsidies and taxes is required. We discuss in which cases the mechanism can work under incomplete information. Hold-up problem, environmental regulation, tax/subsidy <b>mechanism,</b> <b>self-financing</b> regulation...|$|R
