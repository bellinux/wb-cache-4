5000|$|The {{original}} Babetta 206 {{was joined}} by a [...] "new" [...] model, the 207 in 1975. The {{difference between the two}} models is that the 207 featured full <b>suspension</b> <b>front</b> and <b>rear,</b> whereas the 206 had a rigid frame.|$|R

For the first time, a fully independent <b>suspension</b> <b>front</b> and <b>rear</b> will be present in all A platform vehicles. There is also a derivative version of this platform for 'B'-class cars called PQ46.|$|R
50|$|All {{vehicles}} were built with space frames made from welded aircraft grade aluminum tube and ABS plastic bodies. They all had solid axles with leaf spring <b>suspension</b> <b>front</b> and <b>rear.</b> Top speeds were about 30 mi/h km/h - 50 mi/h km/h, and range {{was up to}} 40 mi per charge.|$|R
50|$|The MH Barina, {{which was}} {{released}} in September 1991, featured an improved interior, upgraded <b>suspension,</b> new <b>front</b> and <b>rear</b> bumpers and revised tail-lamp clusters.|$|R
40|$|The bike is a {{great way}} to travel from one point to another, given the {{possibility}} of a higher mobility on smaller distances, providing a healthy style of living, travel and sports. The best choice for town is a mountain-bike due to <b>suspension</b> <b>front</b> and <b>rear,</b> optionally offering a better stability and extra comfort...|$|R
25|$|ACIS (Acoustic Control Induction System), {{a method}} of {{controlling}} air compression pulses inside the intake piping to increase power, was {{also a part of}} the 7M-GE's technological arsenal. All models were fitted with double wishbone <b>suspension</b> <b>front</b> and <b>rear.</b> A targa top was offered in all years along with a metal power sliding sunroof (added in '91).|$|R
50|$|The chassis is a carbon-fiber {{monocoque}} {{with some}} tubular elements. The <b>suspension</b> setup, <b>front</b> and <b>rear,</b> are double wishbones, with pushrod actuated coil springs, and dampers from Ohlins.|$|R
5000|$|In 1919 Baker's {{company was}} merged with William Beardmore and Company, a Scottish {{engineering}} and shipbuilding {{company based in}} Glasgow and between 1921 and 1924 Beardmore produced motorcycles under the name [...] "Beardmore Precision". The first motorcycle produced was a 350 cc two-stroke featuring leaf-spring <b>suspension</b> <b>front</b> and <b>rear</b> and {{was followed by a}} range of motorcycles from 250 cc to 600 cc.|$|R
50|$|The {{cars had}} independent, double {{wishbone}} <b>suspension</b> in <b>front</b> and <b>rear.</b> Wheels were 18 inches in diameter. Slick Goodyear control tyres were 12 inches wide {{in front and}} 14 inches in rear.|$|R
5000|$|The Ambassador was {{available}} in a body style exclusive to its line, a pillarless hardtop Cross Country station wagon. The 1958 Ambassador was offered in a single high level trim level and came equipped with such luxury items as electric clock, twin <b>front</b> and <b>rear</b> ashtrays, Nash tradition [...] "deep coil" [...] spring <b>suspension</b> <b>front</b> and <b>rear,</b> split back reclining front seats that fold down into a bed, as well as upscale fabrics for the interior.|$|R
50|$|The S8, {{like its}} related A8, utilises a {{multi-link}} <b>suspension</b> layout <b>front</b> and <b>rear,</b> with pressurised air springs. However, for the S8, the effective spring and damper rates are noticeably firmer, along with re-engineered suspension mounts.|$|R
5000|$|A [...] "typical" [...] freeride bike {{is hard to}} define, but typical {{specifications}} are 13-18 kilos (30-40 lbs) with 150 - 250 mm of <b>suspension</b> <b>front</b> and <b>rear.</b> Freeride {{bikes are}} generally heavier and more amply suspended than their XC counterparts, but usually retain much of their climbing ability. It {{is up to the}} rider to build his or her bike to lean more toward a preferred level of aggressiveness.|$|R
50|$|The 1983+1984 ATC250R (2nd gen)incorporated many {{improvements}} {{over the}} prior 1982 model, mainly {{with the introduction}} of Pro-Link suspension, folding foot pegs, a larger fuel tank, slightly longer travel <b>suspension</b> in <b>front</b> and <b>rear,</b> and other improvements.|$|R
25|$|At Earls Court, London, in 1976, Batavus {{showed the}} seven-model range; six {{machines}} were {{powered by the}} 48cc Laura engine, with V-belt primary drive and automatic clutch. The exception was the top-of-the-range Mk 4S, with motorcycle styling and the Sachs four-speed motor. Specification include an electronic tachometer, battery-operated turn signals and heavy-duty <b>suspension</b> <b>front</b> and <b>rear.</b> This model, which has the overall dimensions of a full-sized motorcycle was the biggest machine sold by Batavus.|$|R
50|$|The first Beacon was {{equipped}} with an air cooled JAP V-twin engine which had a displacement of 1248 cc. The 7 feet 6 inch (2286 mm) wheelbase, 3 feet 10 inch (1150 mm) track chassis was a conventional one with half elliptic leaf spring <b>suspension</b> <b>front</b> and <b>rear</b> but the bodywork could be specified made from cane basketwork. Drive was to the rear axle through a variable ratio friction drive and chains.|$|R
5000|$|The 908 RC sits a long 3150 mm wheelbase, has {{a length}} of 5123 mm, and is 1370 mm high. The <b>suspension</b> is <b>front</b> and <b>rear</b> drop link with double {{wishbone}} suspension, the brakes are carbon ceramic discs made by Brembo.|$|R
5|$|Bikes may {{experience}} {{a variety of}} longitudinal forces and motions. On most bikes, when the front wheel is turned to {{one side or the}} other, the entire rear frame pitches forward slightly, depending on the steering axis angle and the amount of trail. On bikes with <b>suspensions,</b> either <b>front,</b> <b>rear,</b> or both, trim is used to describe the geometric configuration of the bike, especially in response to forces of braking, accelerating, turning, drive train, and aerodynamic drag.|$|R
500|$|Other {{improvements}} {{include the}} change to a manual [...] transmission with six forward speeds (instead of the previous four), and increased stability resulting from wider track axles than its predecessor. Leaf springs were replaced with modern coil spring <b>suspension</b> <b>front</b> and <b>rear,</b> and the Storm II features rear Dana 44 axles and front TJ Dana 30s, factory designed slip yoke eliminators, and the added safety of standard airbags. Soldiers' comfort was addressed {{as well with the}} addition of standard rear air conditioning and a compact disc player.|$|R
50|$|The R1150GS Adventure had {{a number}} of {{differences}} over the standard bike to make it more suitable for overland and adventure travel. These included an optional 30 L fuel tank, larger screen, single-piece seat, 20 mm taller <b>suspension</b> <b>front</b> and <b>rear,</b> lower first gear and a conventional sixth gear in place of the standard model's overdrive gear. An anti-knock sensor adjustment change allowed the adventure version to run on lower quality gasoline as well. Common options on both models were heated handgrips and ABS brakes.|$|R
50|$|Other {{improvements}} {{include the}} change to a manual transmission with six forward speeds (instead of the previous four), and increased stability resulting from wider track axles than its predecessor. Leaf springs were replaced with modern coil spring <b>suspension</b> <b>front</b> and <b>rear,</b> and the Storm II features rear Dana 44 axles and front TJ Dana 30s, factory designed slip yoke eliminators, and the added safety of standard airbags.

500|$|The Imme R100 {{is noted}} for its simple and {{innovative}} design. Its advanced features include single-sided <b>suspension</b> <b>front</b> and <b>rear,</b> interchangeable wheels <b>front</b> and <b>rear</b> with the option of a spare tyre, the complete drivetrain mounted on the swingarm, and the swingarm tube used as the exhaust pipe. Remarking on the R100 being displayed in the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum exhibition [...] "The Art of the Motorcycle", Ultan Guilfoyle, curatorial adviser at the museum, said: [...] "It's my favourite unknown bike. There are ideas there that are 40 years ahead of their time." [...] An R100 is on permanent display at the Barber Vintage Motorsports Museum.|$|R
25|$|The next model {{produced}} by TVR was the Grantura Mark 1, which used a fastback-style body over the existing chassis design (with the same trailing-arm independent <b>suspension</b> <b>front</b> and <b>rear.)</b> Engine options included the Ford 100E sidevalve (normally aspirated or supercharged), the Ford 105E OHV unit, two different Coventry Climax units, or the MGA's BMC B-series. The {{interior of the}} Grantura was cramped, with the short doors and 17"-diameter steering wheel proving impediments to ingress. Climax-powered cars would be finished with a leather interior, while cars with the lower-specification engines were trimmed with vinyl.|$|R
