40|$|This paper {{presents}} an 6 -axis optical <b>force</b> <b>sensor</b> {{which can be}} used in fMRI. Recently, fMRIs are widely used for studying human brain function. Simultaneous measurement of brain activity and peripheral information, such as grip force, enables more precise investigations in studies of motor function. However, conventional <b>force</b> <b>sensors</b> cannot be used in fMRI environment, since metal elements generate noise which severely contaminate the signals of fMRI. An optical 2 -axis <b>force</b> <b>sensor</b> has been developed using photo sensors and optical fibers by Tada et. al. [1], that resolved these problems.

50|$|A clamp <b>force</b> <b>sensor</b> is a {{relatively}} expensive component in an EMB caliper. The cost is derived from its high unit value from a supplier, as well as marked production expenses because of its inclusion. The later emanates from the complex assembly procedures dealing with small tolerances, as well as on-line calibration for performance variability from one clamp <b>force</b> <b>sensor</b> to another. The successful use of a clamp <b>force</b> <b>sensor</b> in an EMB system poses a challenging engineering task. If a clamp forcesensor is placed close to a brake pad, {{then it will be}} subjected to severe temperature conditions reaching up to 800 Celsius that will challenge its mechanical integrity. Also temperature drifts must be compensated for. This situation can be avoided by embedding a clamp <b>force</b> <b>sensor</b> deep within the caliper. However, embedding this sensor leads to hysteresis that is influenced by friction between the clamp <b>force</b> <b>sensor</b> and the point of contact of an inner pad with the rotor. This hysteresis prevents a true clamp force to be measured. Due to the cost issues and engineering challenges involved with including the clamp <b>force</b> <b>sensor,</b> it might be desirable to eliminate this component from the EMB system. A potential opportunity to achieve this presents itself in accurate estimation of the clamp force based on alternative EMB system sensory measurements leading to the omission of a clamp <b>force</b> <b>sensor.</b>|$|R

Commercial <b>force</b> <b>sensors,</b> however, {{are generally not}} adapted to specific system requirements, resulting in sensors with excess size, cost, and fragility. To overcome these issues, 3 -D printers {{can be used to}} create components for the quick and inexpensive development of <b>force</b> <b>sensors.</b> Limitations of this rapid proto-typing technology, however, require specialized design principles. In this paper, we discuss techniques for rapidly developing simple <b>force</b> <b>sensors,</b> including selecting and attaching metal flexures, using inexpensive and sim-ple displacement transducers, and 3 -D printing features to aid in assembly.

40|$|In the {{development}} of the multi-dimensional <b>force</b> <b>sensor,</b> dimension coupling is the ubiquitous factor restricting the improvement of the measurement accuracy. To effectively reduce the influence of dimension coupling on the parallel multi-dimensional <b>force</b> <b>sensor,</b> a novel parallel three-dimensional <b>force</b> <b>sensor</b> is proposed using a mechanical decoupling principle, and the influence of the friction on dimension coupling is effectively reduced by making the friction rolling instead of sliding friction. In this paper, the mathematical model is established by combining with the structure model of the parallel three-dimensional <b>force</b> <b>sensor,</b> and the modeling and analysis of mechanical decoupling are carried out. The coupling degree (ε) of the designed sensor is defined and calculated, and the calculation results show that the mechanical decoupling parallel structure of the sensor possesses good decoupling performance.

30|$|Some {{studies have}} shown that a robot’s sensing region can be {{expanded}} by equipping it with a <b>force</b> <b>sensor.</b> Salisbury proposed a tactile sensing method that identifies the contact point and the force vector on an insensitive end-effector using a six-axis <b>force</b> <b>sensor</b> [9]. Bicchi proposed the concept of intrinsic contact sensing that involves the identification of the contact point and force vector [10]. A few researchers have focused on the use of six-axis <b>force</b> <b>sensors</b> for realizing whole-body haptics. Iwata and Sugano developed an interface for human symbiotic robots.

An {{original design}} taking advantage on both mechanical and bulk piezoresistive properties of silicon is presented and enables to easily fabricate a very small, large range, high sensitivity with high integration potential sensor.

A <b>force</b> <b>sensor</b> detects contact <b>forces</b> implicitly by estimating the strains of a strain gauge. The compliancy of a <b>force</b> <b>sensor</b> degrades the stability and performance of a force control system.
