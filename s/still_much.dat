5|$|During the 1930s–1950s {{heyday of}} the big Hollywood studios, {{the status of women}} in the {{industry}} was abysmal and, while much has improved, many would argue that there is <b>still</b> <b>much</b> to be done. From art films by Sally Potter, Catherine Breillat, Claire Denis and Jane Campion to action movies by Kathryn Bigelow, women now have a stronger voice, but are only too aware of the still lingering gender gap.|$|E
5|$|Following the Great Eruption, Eta Carinae became self-obscured by the ejected material, {{resulting}} in dramatic reddening. This {{has been estimated}} at four magnitudes at visual wavelengths, meaning the post-eruption luminosity was comparable to the luminosity when first identified. Eta Carinae is <b>still</b> <b>much</b> brighter at infrared wavelengths, despite the presumed hot stars behind the nebulosity. The recent visual brightening {{is considered to be}} largely caused by a decrease in the extinction, due to thinning dust or a reduction in mass loss, rather than an underlying change in the luminosity.|$|E

5|$|The NDL is a {{theoretical}} time obtained by calculating inert gas uptake and release in the body, using a model {{such as the}} Bühlmann decompression algorithm. Although the science of calculating these limits has been refined over the last century, there is <b>still</b> <b>much</b> that is unknown about how inert gases enter and leave the human body. In addition, every individual's body is unique and may absorb and release inert gases at different rates. For this reason, dive tables typically have a degree of safety built into their recommendations. Divers can and do suffer decompression sickness while remaining inside NDLs, though the incidence is very low.|$|E
5|$|Within {{the naval}} bureaus, however, there was <b>still</b> <b>much</b> resistance. In mid-to-late 1904, Poundstone {{continued}} to lobby the General Board while C protested {{that the final}} determinant in a naval battle would be the light guns—and in any case such a large uniform battery was not feasible. Poundstone replied with a design of his own creation, which he called USS Possible and fit twelve 11-inch guns on a ship that displaced 19,330 long tons. With support from Lieutenant Commander William Sims, {{who was able to}} cite the increasingly accurate long-gunnery of the Navy, and interest shown in the project by President Roosevelt, the bureaucratic stalling ended.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there is}} <b>still</b> <b>much</b> {{debate about the}} origins of lemurs on Madagascar, it is {{generally}} accepted that a single rafting event, similar to the one that brought New World monkeys to South America, occurred around 50–80million years ago and allowed ancestral lemurs to cross the Mozambique Channel and colonize the island, which had already split from Africa (while it was joined to the Indian subcontinent), approximately 160million years ago. The resulting founder effect and either non-existent or inferior competition resulted in speciation as the lemur ancestors radiated out to fill open or insufficiently guarded niches. Today, the endemic primate fauna of Madagascar contains over three-quarters of the extant species of the suborder Strepsirrhini, which had been abundant throughout Laurasia and Africa during the Paleocene and Eocene epochs.|$|E

5|$|Cope {{sold his}} {{collections}} to the American Museum of Natural History in 1895; his set of 10,000American fossil mammals sold for $32,000, lower than Cope's asking price of $50,000. The purchase was {{financed by the}} donations from New York's high society. Cope sold three other collections for $29,000. While his collection contained more than 13,000specimens, Cope's fossil hoard was <b>still</b> <b>much</b> smaller than Marsh's collection, valued at over a milliondollars. The University of Pennsylvania bought part of Cope's ethnological artifact collection for $5,500. The Academy of Natural Sciences, Philadelphia's foremost museum, did not bid on any of Cope's sales due to bad blood between Cope and the museum's leaders; as a result, many of Cope's major finds left the city. Cope's proceeds from the sales allowed him to rehire Sternberg to prospect for fossils on his behalf.|$|E
5|$|Despite gaining {{considerable}} power {{during the}} mid twentieth-century, {{the governor is}} <b>still</b> <b>much</b> weaker than those of other states. He has no line-item veto authority, and the pocket veto was ruled unconstitutional. If a governor does not sign or reject a bill, it becomes law automatically. This led to a fist fight during the term of Claude Matthews, who was locked out of the House chambers {{to prevent him from}} returning a bill in time. Vetoes are also easily overridden, requiring only a simple majority as opposed to a supermajority. The legislature still exercises final control over the hiring of state employees, but given the large size of the government and the short legislative sessions, they are unable to make any considerable impact other than their continued advocacy for an expanded merit system. The cabinet is still almost entirely independent of the governor, and he has control over only half of the government's agencies, such as the Indiana State Police and the Indiana Bureau of Motor Vehicles. Other large agencies, such as the Department of Administration, are {{under the control of the}} cabinet.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, the 22-officer Dawson Creek Royal Canadian Mounted Police {{municipal}} detachment reported 2,561 Criminal Code offences.

The city had slightly higher but comparable levels of offensive weapons charges, cannabis-related offences, robbery, and motor vehicle thefts. Per 1,000 people, the city had much higher levels of shoplifting (13.8 city, 4.2 province), cocaine-related offences (7.8 city, 1.4 province), commercial break-and-enters (11.2 city, 4.2 province), residential break-and-enters (13.9 city, 6.0 province), and non-sexual assaults (26.2 city, 9.9 province).|$|E

5|$|No German {{team was}} allowed at the 1948 Summer Olympics in London or the Winter Games in St. Moritz. Brundage {{was anxious to}} reintegrate Germany into the Olympic {{movement}} once the Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany, through Brundage's lifetime) was formed in 1949. Soon after the state's formation, its National Olympic Committee approached the IOC, seeking recognition, but there was <b>still</b> <b>much</b> animus towards Germany. Just prior to the IOC session in Vienna in 1951 (Brundage was still vice president), the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) also formed an NOC and requested recognition. This created controversy, as the Federal Republic and its NOC claimed to represent both West and East Germany, but did not control the latter. Despite lengthy discussions, no resolution was reached in 1951, and the matter was put over until February 1952, when a negotiating session was scheduled for Copenhagen. Although the East Germans came to Copenhagen, they refused to attend the session, which was eventually cancelled by Edström after the IOC officials and West Germans waited for hours in vain. The German team which competed in Helsinki that summer was entirely West German.|$|E
5|$|On {{the second}} day, Yardley {{attempted}} {{to slow the}} Australian batsmen by employing leg theory, a defensive strategy that sought more to contain the opposition than to attack. As England had batted poorly in the first innings, allowing Australia {{to take the lead}} quickly, the home team sought to slow the tourists' momentum and force a drawn match. Despite the tactics, Australia reached 293/4 {{at the end of the}} day's play, captain Donald Bradman having registered his 28th Test century. Although Bradman and his batsmen made gestures indicating frustration at England's stifling tactics, they remained patient as there was <b>still</b> <b>much</b> time left in the match for them to convert their dominance into a victory. The next morning, Bradman departed for 138, the first in a series of dismissals in the leg trap, but his vice-captain Lindsay Hassett continued, making 137 and putting on a century partnership with Lindwall as Australia were eventually out for 509, giving them a 344-run first innings lead. Laker was the leading bowler, taking 4/138. England reached 121/2 by stumps on the third day, which ended with a hostile crowd reaction to Miller, who bowled a large amount of bouncers at Len Hutton and Denis Compton.|$|E
5|$|The {{works of}} Mario Vargas Llosa {{are viewed as}} both modernist and postmodernist novels. Though there is <b>still</b> <b>much</b> debate over the {{differences}} between modernist and postmodernist literature, literary scholar M. Keith Booker claims that the difficulty and technical complexity of Vargas Llosa's early works, such as The Green House and Conversation in the Cathedral, are clearly elements of the modern novel. Furthermore, these earlier novels all carry a certain seriousness of attitude—another important defining aspect of modernist art. By contrast, his later novels such as Captain Pantoja and the Special Service, Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter, The Real Life of Alejandro Mayta, and The Storyteller (El hablador) appear to follow a postmodernist mode of writing. These novels have a much lighter, farcical, and comic tone, characteristics of postmodernism. Comparing two of Vargas Llosa's novels, The Green House and Captain Pantoja and the Special Service, Booker discusses the contrast between modernism and postmodernism found in the writer's works: while both novels explore the theme of prostitution {{as well as the}} workings of the Peruvian military, Booker points out that the former is gravely serious whereas the latter is ridiculously comic.|$|E

5|$|Three {{months later}} royalist general Pío Tristán {{advanced}} {{in the north}} with more than three thousand men, prepared to invade the United Provinces. Once again outnumbered by larger armies, Belgrano organised a great exodus {{of the city of}} Jujuy: the entire population of the city would have to retreat with the army and not leave behind anything that might be of value to the royalists (such as animals, crops, or housing). By September a proper formation of columns provided them with a victory against a royalist task force of 500men during the Battle of Las Piedras. The First Triumvirate commanded Belgrano to retreat to Cordoba without fighting, but he thought that doing so would mean the loss of the northern provinces. Thus, instead of continuing to Cordoba, he was convinced by the people of San Miguel de Tucumán to make a stand there. His forces had increased by then to nearly 1,800 soldiers, <b>still</b> <b>much</b> less than the 3,000 at Tristan's command. Even so, he obtained a victory in the Battle of Tucumán. By that time, the First Triumvirate was replaced by the Second Triumvirate, which provided greater support for Belgrano. The Second Triumvirate called the Assembly of Year XIII soon after taking power, which was intended to declare independence and enact a national constitution, but failed to do so because of political disputes between the members. It did not take measures regarding the national flag, but allowed Belgrano to use the blue and white flag as the flag of the Army of the North.|$|E
