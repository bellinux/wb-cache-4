What characterized it as a primary instead of a <b>standard</b> <b>opinion</b> poll was that the public knew of the primary in advance, all eligible voters were invited, and the voting was by secret ballot. Nearly 300,000 people voted in makeshift tents and mobile ballot boxes. Vahan Hovhannisyan received the most votes and was subsequently nominated for the presidential election by the ARF Supreme Council in a secret ballot. In the presidential election, Hovhannisyan placed fourth with 6.2% of the vote. In 2008, ARF re-joined the ruling political coalition in Armenia and supported strong police actions during the 2008 Armenian presidential election protests that led to ten deaths.|$|E

It will be shown that a rigorous application of Quine’s maxim of shallow analysis to formalizations of factual contexts paves the way for an account of formalizing such contexts which blocks the slingshot without ramifications for theories of facts or definite descriptions...|$|R

Our results are encouraging — OASIS substantially outperforms a competitive baseline when creating document-level aggregate summaries that compute the average polarity value across the multiple opinions identified for each source about each topic.

What I aim to do is to understand the subtlety of Plato’s argument about Protagorean relativism and, at the same time, to assess its philosophical significance by revealing the inextric¬ability of ontological and epistemological aspects on which it is built (for this latter aspect, I refer to contemporary discussions of relativism, mainly to Margolis’ robust relativism). I then turn to Aristotle’s treatment of Protagoras’ relativism in Metaphysics Γ, sections 5 and 6, in order to show that Plato and Aristotle surprisingly share the same view as regards the philosophical content of Protagoras’ relativism (in doing so, I take position against the <b>standard</b> <b>opinion</b> among scholars that Plato and Aristotle understand Protagoras’ relativism in different, even incompatible, ways). What I ultimately aim to demonstrate is that Protagoras’ relativism, as understood by both Plato and Aristotle, is a coherent, even attractive, philosophical position...|$|E
40|$|Contrary {{to almost}} <b>standard</b> <b>opinion</b> that the X(3872) {{resonance}} is the D^* 0 D̅^ 0 +c. c. molecule or the qcq̅c̅ four-quark state, {{we discuss the}} scenario where the X(3872) resonance is the cc̅ = χ_c 1 (2 P) charmonium which "sits on" the D^* 0 D̅^ 0 threshold. We explain the shift {{of the mass of}} the X(3872) resonance with respect to the prediction of a potential model for the mass of the χ_c 1 (2 P) charmonium by the contribution of the virtual D^*D̅+c. c. intermediate states into the self energy of the X(3872) resonance. This allows us to estimate the coupling constant of the X(7872) resonance with the D^* 0 D̅^ 0 channel, the branching ratio of the X(3872) → D^* 0 D̅^ 0 + c. c. decay, and the branching ratio of the X(3872) decay into all non-D^* 0 D̅^ 0 + c. c. states. We predict a significant number of unknown decays of X(3872) via two gluon:X(3872) → gluon gluon→ hadrons.

The nationwide sample (N = 593) revealed that sources affiliated with the orga-nization on whose behalf they speak are viewed more negatively than unaffiliated sources. In addition, public relations practitioners were judged no more critically than other affiliated sources. Finally, a multiitem measure of public relations in gen-eral demonstrated that perceptions of practitioners are stable across demographics. Recent public opinion surveys and source credibility experiments have not painted a flattering picture of public relations. Both have labeled practitioners as spokes-persons whom the public highly doubts and have ranked them behind almost every other information source imaginable, including pollsters, student activists, and fu-neral directors. Because of these findings, researchers {{have been quick to}} relegate practitioners to working in the wings, out of the public eye, and speaking through other company mouthpieces.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the relationship of}} the Lith. nom. pl. endings ‑ai (‑aĩ) and ‑i, ‑ie (‑ì, ‑ìe) {{to each other and to}} their common source, the PIE pronominal nom. pl. in *‑oi. It is argued that the Proto-BSl. preform was *‑ ai, with acuteness analogically taken from the corresponding nominal ending *‑ ō s. Proto-BSl. *‑ ai, which developed regularly to ‑i in Slavic and to ‑ai in Old Prussian, had two reflexes in Lithuanian. The phonologically regular treatment is seen in the pronominal and adjectival ending ‑i(e), which developed from *‑ ai  to *‑ ẹ̄  via the presumed intermediate stage *‑ ɛi. The nominal ending ‑ai is a morphological treatment of the same sequence, with a) *‑ ɛi remade to *‑ ai under the influence of paradigmatically related forms in *‑a‑, and b) acuteness subsequently lost in a final syllable. The second step runs counter to <b>standard</b> <b>opinion,</b> which holds that underlying acute diphthongs in final syllables trigger Saussure’s Law and retain their acuteness in Žemaitian, as in the ā‑ present forms 1  sg. sakaũ, 2  sg. sakaĩ (Žem. sakâu, sakā̂). It is maintained here, however, that the verbal endings that appear as ‑aũ and ‑aĩ in standard Lithuanian are not historically diphthongs at all, but contracted sequences that arose after the “de-acuting” of the inherited nom. pl. in *‑ ai to ‑ai and before Saussure’s Law. A byproduct of this explanation is that other descriptively non-acute diphthongs in final syllables, notably the dat. sg. in ‑ui (< PIE *‑ōi) and the instr. pl. in ‑ais (< PIE *‑ōis), can also be assumed to have been originally acute, as their etymologies require...|$|E
40|$|Globally {{the organic}} market now {{comprises}} approximately 2 % {{of the total}} food market and is growing {{in the order of}} 20 % - 30 % pa (Meat NZ 2000). Pasture based agriculture in New Zealand is in an ideal position {{to take advantage of this}} growth. BioGro New Zealand and AgriQuality New Zealand are currently the two dominant organic livestock specifications that farmers must produce to. The AgriQuality standard is based on the new European Union standard recently released. This study will investigate the requirements, implications and issues pertinent to a group of New Zealand livestock growers contemplating conversion to organic livestock production for the European market. A detailed literature review, multiple case study analysis of three BioGro farms and focus group discussion was conducted. The major distinction between the two standards is in the animal welfare and conversion period requirements. The AgriQuality standard permits up to three medical treatments per year, per animal without loss of organic status and the conversion can be quicker. Motives for the case study farmers converting to organic included, environmental, market opportunities and a desire to bring the soils, pastures and animals into 'balance'. Best management practice of the soils, pastures, animals and water on the farms was about accepting and minimising where possible the production risks through timing and proactive management with a preventative focus. Sourcing information, developing new skills and a drive to find new and different ways of answering conventional problems is critical. A lot of thought and energy goes into off farm marketing and value adding projects for market control and personal satisfaction. These differences in the standards could provide opportunities to farmers keen on a more environmentally friendly farming system that don't want to go to the full BioGro standard and conversion process. There may also be the opportunity to attain organic premiums from moving to the EU <b>standard.</b> <b>Opinion</b> on the EU standards was mixed. Some saw the EU standards as an easier option that gave the 'organic brand' a bad name. They felt having more than one organic label would confuse the consumer and be of detrimental value long term to the New Zealand organic industry. None of the case farmers would revert back from their BioGro Standards. Financial performance measures were not defined in this research. It would be unwise for a conventional farmer to convert to an organic system for financial reasons. Non-financial drivers such as the environment and social indicators are important measures. For progressive farmers that are after a more sustainable farming system the EU standard offers an opportunity. For these farmers financial and non financial performance measures will be important and attainable. The EU standard has the potential to 'out perform' conventional and BioGro systems - proving the hypothesis...|$|E

They were presented cards with statements or propositions. Respondents had to sort these {{into a number of}} categories, representing {{the degree to which they}} reflect or deviate from their own <b>standards,</b> <b>opinions,</b> views or experiences. During the interview, the interviewer prompts respondents to account for their way of sorting statements. Respondents may shift cards/statements, as they sort the statements relative to one another. A Q-method interview is finished when the respondent is satisfied with the distribution of statements. The completed distribution is called a Q-sort. The validity of a Q-method design is crucially influenced by its Q-sample, the set of statements to be sorted (see Appendices 1 and 2). The Q-sample should at least approximate the variety in the ‘concourse’; statements should represent all important aspects or properties or dimensions of a particular discursive field. In this research project, the Q-sample was derived from the typology of boundary arrangements/practices and its implications for the governance of expertise presented earlier. For reasons of feasibility, the number of Q-statements was restricted to 42. The validity of the Q-sample was checked by asking each respondent, at the end of the interview, about omissions and biases.|$|R
