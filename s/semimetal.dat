5|$|The term {{metalloid}} originally {{referred to}} nonmetals. Its more recent meaning, {{as a category}} of elements with intermediate or hybrid properties, became widespread in 1940–1960. Metalloids are sometimes called semimetals, a practice that has been discouraged, as the term <b>semimetal</b> has a different meaning in physics than in chemistry. In physics it more specifically refers to the electronic band structure of a substance.|$|E
5|$|Metalloids usually {{look like}} metals but behave largely like nonmetals. Physically, they are shiny, brittle solids with {{intermediate}} to relatively good electrical conductivity and the electronic band {{structure of a}} <b>semimetal</b> or semiconductor. Chemically, they mostly behave as (weak) nonmetals, have intermediate ionization energies and electronegativity values, and amphoteric or weakly acidic oxides. They can form alloys with metals. Most of their other {{physical and chemical properties}} are intermediate in nature.|$|E
5|$|The {{origin and}} {{usage of the}} term {{metalloid}} is convoluted. Its origin lies in attempts, dating from antiquity, to describe metals and to distinguish between typical and less typical forms. It was first applied in the early 19th century to metals that floated on water (sodium and potassium), and then more popularly to nonmetals. Earlier usage in mineralogy, to describe a mineral having a metallic appearance, can be sourced to as early as 1800. Since the mid-20th century {{it has been used}} to refer to intermediate or borderline chemical elements. The International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) previously recommended abandoning the term metalloid, and suggested using the term <b>semimetal</b> instead. Use of this latter term has more recently been discouraged by Atkins et al. as it has a different meaning in physics—one that more specifically refers to the electronic band structure of a substance rather than the overall classification of an element. The most recent IUPAC publications on nomenclature and terminology do not include any recommendations on the usage of the terms metalloid or <b>semimetal.</b>|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} {{conductance}} fluctuation in topological <b>semimetals.</b> Through statistic {{distribution of energy}} levels of topological <b>semimetals,</b> we determine the dominant parameters of universal conductance fluctuation (UCF), i. e., the number of uncorrelated bands k, the level degeneracy s, and the symmetry parameter β. These parameters allow us to predict the zero-temperature intrinsic UCF of topological <b>semimetals</b> by the Altshuler-Lee-Stone theory. Then, we obtain numerically the conductance fluctuations for topological <b>semimetals</b> of quasi- 1 D geometry. We find that for Dirac/Weyl <b>semimetals,</b> the theoretical prediction coincides with the numerical results. However, a non-universal conductance fluctuation behavior is found for topological nodal line <b>semimetals,</b> i. e., the conductance fluctuation amplitude increases with the enlargement of SOC strength.

25|$|The sulfide {{minerals}} are {{chemical compounds}} {{of one or}} more metals or semimetals with a sulfur; tellurium, arsenic, or selenium can substitute for the sulfur. Sulfides tend to be soft, brittle minerals with a high specific gravity. Many powdered sulfides, such as pyrite, have a sulfurous smell when powdered. Sulfides are susceptible to weathering, and many readily dissolve in water; these dissolved minerals can be later redeposited, which creates enriched secondary ore deposits. Sulfides are classified by the ratio of the metal or <b>semimetal</b> to the sulfur, such as M:S equal to 2:1, or 1:1. Many sulfide minerals are economically important as metal ores; examples include sphalerite (ZnS), an ore of zinc, galena (PbS), an ore of lead, cinnabar (HgS), an ore of mercury, and molybdenite (MoS2, an ore of molybdenum. Pyrite (FeS2), is the most commonly occurring sulfide, and can be found in most geological environments. It is not, however, an ore of iron, but can be instead oxidized to produce sulfuric acid. Related to the sulfides are the rare sulfosalts, in which a metallic element is bonded to sulfur and a <b>semimetal</b> such as antimony, arsenic, or bismuth.
