Recent progress has allowed electromagnetic wave energy to be transferred from power sources (i. e., transmitters) to destinations (i. e., receivers) wirelessly, the so-called wireless power transfer (WPT) technique.

50|$|As {{mentioned}} earlier, {{a significant}} {{fraction of the}} light shining {{on the surface of}} the water is lost by reflection and, thus, will not be available to attract fish and members of their food chain. Security lights can be modified to operate submerged in water. Positioning the bulb underwater delivers approximately twice as much light to attract fish. However, the modification must be done professionally as the high voltages that power these lamps can be lethal. Commercially made, submersible fishing lights are available on the internet. The power ballast and lamp housing is mounted on a pole in a dry location. The lamp, potted in a waterproof housing, is connected to the ballast via a waterproof cable. Floating like a fishing line bob, the lamp is positioned underwater by weights on its submerged power <b>supply</b> <b>cord.</b> The bulb is fragile so some manufacturers offer protective covers and hard lenses. However, one unique feature of the submerged, unprotected bulb is that its outer glass envelope gets hot enough to prevent establishment of marine growth. When the bulb has a protective cover or is not operated daily occasional cleaning is required. A permanently fixed fishing light attractor is most effective if it is operated every night. It takes to a week or two for larger fish to discover the increasing concentration of bait fish attracted to the light. Once discovered, the fish return regularly — often arriving at predictable times of the evening.|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjective: The {{aim was to}} intraoperatively {{identify}} the spinal <b>cord</b> blood <b>supply</b> and shorten the aortic crossclamp time. Methods: A platinum electrode was placed intrathecally by lumbar puncture alongside the spinal cord. After the aorta was crossclamped, hydrogen in a saline solution was injected into the aorta and, if it was shown that the segment <b>supplied</b> the spinal <b>cord</b> and there were multiple arteries, then these were individually injected. The repair was performed by a sequential segmental method as described previously. Results: Postoperatively, highly selective angiography was used to confirm that reattached intercostal arteries <b>supplied</b> the spinal <b>cord.</b> The technique was accurrate in all patients. Five spinal cord perfusion patterns were noted: (1) direct, (2) collateral, (3) no direct supply from segment tested, (4) from atriofemoral bypass, and (5) occluded reattached intercostals. When no response was obtained or no further testing was required (n = 8), testing time was 4. 2 minutes and crossclamp time 41. 9 minutes. When multiple segmental arteries required further testing, the mean testing time was 10. 4 minutes and crossclamp time 58. 5 minutes, including reattachment of intercostal vessels (p = not significant). Conclusion: Preliminary findings indicate that this method is a safe research technique, can detect radicular arteries, and may reduce the time for aortic crossclamping if no vessels are identified as <b>supplying</b> the spinal <b>cord.</b> (J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg 1996; 112 : 1455 - 61...|$|R

50|$|Introduced in September 1986 {{simultaneously}} with the Apple IIGS, this model {{introduced a new}} motherboard, new keyboard and new color scheme. The original Apple IIc had no expansion options and required third-party cards such as Legend Industries to perform various hardware tricks. This could be done by removing the CPU and MMU chips and inserting a special board into these sockets, which then used bank switching to expand memory up to 1 MegByte (RAM). This {{was similar to the}} function of the slots in the original Apple II, II+ as well as the auxiliary slot in the Apple IIe. The new motherboard added a 34-pin socket for plugging in memory cards directly, which allowed for the addressing of up to 1 megabyte (MB) of memory using Slinky-type memory cards. The onboard chip count was reduced from 16 memory chips (64K×1) to four (64K×4). The new firmware removed the code for the cancelled AppleTalk networking device and replaced it with support for memory cards. Bumping out the non-supported AppleTalk functionality, memory now lived in virtual slot 4, and mouse support moved to slot 7. The new keyboard no longer had the rubber anti-spill mat and offered generally more tactile and responsive keys that felt more “clicky.” At the same time, the color of the keyboard, floppy drive latch, and power <b>supply</b> <b>cords</b> changed from beige to light grey, which matched the new Platinum color scheme of the Apple IIGS. The case style, however, remained Snow White. Owners of the previous IIc model were entitled to a free motherboard upgrade if they purchased one of Apple’s IIc memory expansion boards (they did not receive the new keyboard or the cosmetic changes).|$|R

40|$|Abstract Purpose: To {{test the}} {{hypothesis}} that simultaneous closure of at least 2 independent vascular territories <b>supplying</b> the spinal <b>cord</b> and/or prolonged hypotension {{may be associated with}} symptomatic spinal cord ischemia (SCI) after thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR). Methods: A pattern matching algorithm was used to develop a risk model for symptomatic SCI using a prospective 63 -patient single-center cohort to test the positive predictive value (PPV) of prolonged intraoperative hypotension and/or simultaneous closure of at least 2 of 4 the vascular territories <b>supplying</b> the spinal <b>cord</b> (left subclavian, intercostal, lumbar, and hypogastric arteries). This risk model was then applied to data extracted from the multicenter European Registry on Endovascular Aortic Repair Complications (EuREC). Between 2002 and 2010, the 19 centers participating in EuREC reported 38 (1. 7 %) cases of symptomatic spinal cord ischemia among the 2235 patients in the database. Results: In the single-center cohort, direct correlations were seen between the occurrence of symptomatic SCI and both prolonged intraoperative hypotension (PPV 1. 00, 95 % CI 0. 22 to 1. 00, p =  0. 04) and simultaneous closure of at least 2 independent spinal cord vascular territories (PPV 0. 67, 95 % CI 0. 24 to 0. 91, p =  0. 005). Previous closure of a single vascular territory was not associated with an increased risk of symptomatic spinal cord ischemia (PPV 0. 07, 95 % CI 0. 01 to 0. 16, p =  0. 56). The combination of prolonged hypotension and simultaneous closure of at least 2 territories exhibited the strongest association (PPV 0. 75, 95 % CI 0. 38 to 0. 75, p< 0. 0001). Applying the model to the entire EuREC cohort found an almost perfect agreement between the predicted and observed risk factors (kappa 0. 77, 95 % CI 0. 65 to 0. 90). Conclusion: Extensive coverage of intercostal arteries alone by a thoracic stent-graft is not associated with symptomatic SCI; however, simultaneous closure of at least 2 vascular territories <b>supplying</b> the spinal <b>cord</b> is highly relevant, especially in combination with prolonged intraoperative hypotension. As such, these results further emphasize the need to preserve the left subclavian artery during TEVAR...|$|R
