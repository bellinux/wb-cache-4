40|$|This report proposes major {{reform of}} the system of social {{security}} payments for people of working age (18 to 64 years), including Newstart Allowance, Disability Support Pension and Parenting Payment. Instead of applying more band aids to a broken system, the report proposes that we go back to first principles and rebuild it from the ground up. Payment levels would be based on need and rather than the likelihood of employment, so the distinction between pension and allowance payments would be removed. Instead, income support payments would be set at an ‘Australian Minimum Standard of Living’: the minimum level of income a person needs to cover their basic expenses and live decently. In addition, supplements would be paid to assist people with <b>special</b> <b>costs</b> including the costs of disability and caring, and housing rents.

40|$|In this research, the {{feasibility}} of biogas production using biomass in collected wastes in Tabriz City, {{as one of the}} largest industrial metropolitan in Iran, with a daily waste more than 1200 tons was studied. The heating value of gathered gas is about 15 - 25 MJ/m 3 which can generate 1. 5 - 2. 2 kWh/m 3 energy using biogas combustion generators. In this paper, first the different methods of recycling energy and for those the most used algorithms are studied. Second, by analyzing daily collected wastes and considering the realistic obtained data from leachate of Tabriz waste landfills, the average amount of Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) and Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) are obtained.

40|$|Most {{buildings}} {{are intended to}} have a long service life, usually over 50 or even 100 years. It is, thus, important to analyse all phases of their life, considering both the influence on environment and expenses. In order to do this precisely the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and the Life Cycle Costs (LCC) methods are used. There are many commonly used LCA and LCC software tools. They make it easier to control maintenance issues, and let their users accumulate all the data for the building. This paper takes into consideration several LCA tools and presents the main assumptions concerning the LCA and LCC methods. The most widely used theory of the LCA analysis is an approach described in International Standards ISO 14040, that assumes four phases of the LCA: Goal and scope definition, Inventory Analysis, Impact Assessment, and Interpretation. There are a few variants of life cycle assessment, namely cradle-to-grave, cradle-to-gate, cradle-to-cradle or gate-to-gate. For analysis in the building industry the most common method is cradle-to-grave approach, which best presents all the significant issues connected with buildings. The LCA of a building takes into consideration phases such as material acquisition, creation, transportation, use, and finally the disposal of the products. Strongly connected with the Life Cycle Assessment is the issue of the Life Cycle Costs. The LCC is used to help decision-making in all the phases of a building’s life. It ought {{to be taken into account}} that construction costs are only the beginning, and in further phases there will be other costs connected with operation and management, or <b>special</b> <b>costs</b> (e. g. taxes). Bridge Management Systems are based on the LCA and LCC methods. They have been developed so as to help manage resources effectively and to maintain bridges in satisfactory condition. Bridge Management Systems assess the present condition of the bridge and they also intend to predict the future performance of a bridge...|$|E
40|$|Within the {{construction}} industry, {{there have been}} many attempts to identify the cost factors or to compare the building costs. However, it seems the combination of both has not been applied so much especially in healthcare construction. The {{purpose of this study is}} to compare cost performance in the hospital construction between Norway and United States and identify the most important cost factors. A combination of qualitative and quantitative research methods has been used in this study. Case studies, questionnaire, Purchasing Power Parity, and Pareto analysis were the main methods used. The data include both primary and secondary. 3 Norwegian and 3 American hospital cases and questionnaire responses are the primary data. Statistical indices are the secondary data used to gain a holistic perspective on {{the construction}} situation. The results show the reported hospital construction cost in the US is lower than Norway; 2602 /m 2 vs. 3822 /m 2, respectively. With 973 /m 2, the Norwegian projects also had higher standard deviation than the American counterparts with 171 /m 2. The analysis of the reported cost breakdown structures revealed similarities, such as in HVAC, and differences, such as in <b>special</b> <b>costs</b> category. The Pareto analysis showed there are similarities between top factors in Norway and the US. Therefore, there is a substantial incentive for future knowledge sharing initiatives. The overall experts opinion was that the number of bed spaces is the most important factor in hospital construction costs. Experts also selected consultants and owners as the stakeholders who can affect a larger group of factors. By the end of study, a priority checklist of the cost factors was created based on the experts opinion. The checklist shows that the building and HVAC cost categories are better to be monitored more closely. Unlike previous researches which were mostly focused on building costs, regional comparisons, and operational aspect of hospitals, this thesis draws on the international experience and concentrates on hospital construction costs. Moreover, this research is centered around on quantifiable cost factors and the findings are mainly based on the case studies. There are different implications regarding this thesis. For industry, it unveils the common cost areas where projects can learn from each other. For managers, it suggests priority checklist of important factors that may need more attention. For project stakeholders in general, the influence of main stakeholders on different cost factor has been presented which can help them to allocating the resources more efficiently. For researchers, it identifies potential factors for future researches...|$|E

Autorica opisuje i analizira nove izvore koji pokazuju da je vlastelin barun P. A. Hilleprand von Prandau sa svojim provizorom Wenzelom Anneisom izravno provodio kontrolu prolaza roba, dobara i ljudi koji su se kretali ovim dijelom Slavonije ili prelazili u Ugarsku koristeći skelu kod Miholjca. Četiri krivulje izrađene na temelju podataka iz popisa mostarine pokazuju bogatstvo podataka prikupljenih tijekom 80 mjeseci svakodnevnog bilježenja naplaćene mostarine. Koristeći sadržaje barunovih pisama iz Bečkih protokola ocrtavaju se svakodnevne prilike na vlastelinskim cestama i strahote koje su se povremeno događale u selima i oko njih. Baron P. A. Hilleprand of Prandau, who was {{the owner}} of the Valpovo Manor since 1722, left us a wealth of {{valuable}} archive materials in form of letters he wrote to a number of persons and transcripts of letters he received from his supervisors of the Valpovo Manor, known as the Viennese Protocols. He also left manuscripts of annual supervisor reports, containing lists of all revenues and expenditures incurred in course of the business year, which started on May 1 st and ended on April 30 th next year. The manuscript books, consisting of thread-bound folio-format papers with covers, are supplemented by the Reference Book 2 from January 1 st, 1731 to August 31 st, 1737. The first page of the manuscript book, in addition to the title, contains four straps covered in seal wax and imprinted with the official seal of the Valpovo Manor. Each page contains entries about bridge toll collected in course of a month, divided by days. The accuracy of the sum {{at the end of the}} page is confirmed by the signature of the supervisor of Valpovo. The Viennese Protocols contain a transcript of the regulations on the duties of the official collecting the toll. There is a description, a valid price list, and a price list for the use of the ferry near Miholjac. The transcripts provide all kinds of information about the passage of goods and persons. Brief records of events described by passengers, for instance, records of troubles, such as thefts and robberies that occurred on the roads or in the villages, have been recognized as extraordinary historical sources. It is also interesting to read how some people caused trouble on the bridge or tried to get away without paying the toll. Supervisors’ records about the <b>special</b> <b>costs</b> of restoring safety to the Manor’s roads and villages in this period are extraordinary testimonies to the cruelty of the outlaws, rebels, and bandits. The Manor’s efforts to catch the transgressors by organizing a militia, offering rewards to informants, and putting prices on the bandits’ heads give us an even better idea of the troubles they faced in their everyday life. The records about numerous costs of special military interventions, pursuits, executions, and treatment of the wounded add to our knowledge of how difficult and insecure life had been back then...|$|E
