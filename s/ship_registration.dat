The <b>Ship</b> <b>Registration</b> Act was approved by Parliament on 4 May 1901. A government commission looked into the detailed aspects of registration and the Council of State approved these on 23 July 1902. This resulted in about fifty district courts being given the task of maintaining local ship registers covering their jurisdiction. They were known by names such as Bergen Ship Register.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ship</b> <b>registration</b> in Norway became codified in 1902 and {{the task}} was {{handed over to the}} {{district}} courts and their magistrates and city clerks. At first having about 50 registers, this was reduced to 27 in 1972. The responsibility was centralized and taken over by the Norwegian Ship Registers in 1992. It was merged into the Maritime Authority in 2012.|$|E
25|$|The {{process to}} {{establish}} a public ship register commenced in 1881. The background was that a bank was being considered which would have as its purpose to lend money to purchase ships. This would require a legal framework which would firmly establish ownership and collateral in ships. The Sea Law Commission was appointed in 1882 to consider this and other legal aspects of the shipping industry. It {{soon became clear that}} the commission would have <b>ship</b> <b>registration</b> as its main purpose, as other aspects of sea law had to be coordinated internationally. They reached a conclusion which resulted in an 1888 proposal for Parliament which was based on a single, central register for ships. Parliament decided not to consider the law, and similar proposals in 1892, 1893, 1894 and 1897 were similarly dismissed.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the late}} 1960s and early 1970s {{merchant}} shipping evolved from {{an industry that}} involved <b>ship</b> <b>registration</b> and the recruitment of crew {{in the country of}} ownership to a multinational industry characterised [...] by ‘internationalising’ crews, management and ship nationality using flags of convenience. TMTI was founded in 1978-79 to provide a training school for Tuvaluan men who are interested to be working as seaman, cooks or marine engineers in the international maritime industry with a basic level of maritime qualifications and also to provide experienced seaman with revalidation and advanced training to upgrade their skills. The marine school on Amatuku motu (islet) opened in 1981.|$|E

50|$|<b>Ship</b> <b>registration</b> {{has been}} done since {{business}} on the seas has been important. Originally meant to control ships carrying cargo in European seaborne countries, {{it was used to}} make sure ships were being built in the local country, with crews predominantly of the local country. Since then, <b>ship</b> <b>registration</b> has been used to document ships for ownership. Documentation provides definite evidence of nationality for international purposes and provides financing opportunities with the availability of preferred mortgages on documented vessels.|$|E

50|$|Florida state {{officials}} made several attempts {{to shut the}} business down, finally succeeding in 1999 when federal prosecutors charged Boulis with violating shipping laws over the <b>ship's</b> <b>registration.</b> U.S. <b>shipping</b> code forbids foreign nationals from owning American commercial vessels, and Boulis was a Greek citizen. Boulis agreed to pay a $1 million fine, sell the business, and never work in the gaming industry again.

[...] These broadcasts led to complaints from the General Post Office that communications were being affected. As a result, Panama withdrew the <b>ship's</b> <b>registration</b> on 7 May. On 2 July, Radio Atlanta merged with Radio Caroline, with Mi Amigo broadcasting as Radio Caroline South.

40|$|This volume {{offers a}} {{systematic}} {{account of the}} effects of globalization on the shipping industry and seafarers' lives. The seafarers' labour market is changing rapidly and this study discusses the challenges encountered in recruitment practices, trade unions and collective bargaining, as well as training, certification and fraudulent certification. Wages, contracts, and tours of duty are also investigated, and the book includes in-depth treatment of seafarer safety and hazard exposure. Innovations such as automated engine rooms and the global maritime distress and safety system, the internationalization of <b>ship</b> <b>registrations,</b> multinational crewing and reductions in crewing levels, and the rise in ship management companies have {{had a profound effect on}} seafarers' living and working conditions. This perceptive book examines these and future issues for regulation and enforcement. ...|$|R
