40|$|The main {{goals of}} this {{research}} were to model, design, fabricate, and test an on/off valve suitable for digital pump/motors. Preliminary modeling and comparison of valve designs led to the decision to pursue a two <b>stage</b> bi-directional check <b>valve</b> design (BDCV). A lumped parameter coupled multi-domain model was developed to evaluate the dynamic performance of the BDCV main stage and was used in an iterative design process to specify design traits of the main <b>stage</b> <b>valve.</b> ^ A prototype BDCV main stage was designed and manufactured. Steady state and dynamic measurements were taken of the valve to validate the model and the design. The main <b>stage</b> <b>valve</b> operated faster during active checking (2 to 3 ms) compared to passive checking (60 to 100 ms). Finally, experimental testing of a single piston pumping chamber was conducted to demonstrate the prototype 2 ̆ 7 s bi-directional functionality Two different control methods of the BDCV were successfully implemented to achieve variable displacement of the test stand. From this testing {{it was concluded that}} the BDCV is capable of enabling variable displacements on a digital pump/motor. ...|$|R
25|$|Intermediate {{pressure}} creep: This {{is a slow}} leak of {{the first}} <b>stage</b> <b>valve.</b> The effect is for the interstage pressure to rise until either the next breath is drawn, or the pressure exerts more force on the second <b>stage</b> <b>valve</b> than can be resisted by the spring, and the valve opens briefly, often with a popping sound, to relieve the pressure. {{the frequency of the}} popping pressure relief depends on the flow in the second stage, the back pressure, the second stage spring tension and the magnitude of the leak. It may range from occasional loud pops to a constant hiss. Underwater the second stage may be damped by the water and the loud pops may become an intermittent or constant stream of bubbles. This is not usually a catastrophic failure mode, but should be fixed as it will get worse, and it wastes gas.|$|R

Their use, however, is restricted to low bandwidth and low flow rate applications due to the limitation of the solenoid actuators. Our research focuses on alleviating the need for large and expensive solenoids in single <b>stage</b> <b>valves</b> by advantageously using fluid flow forces. For example, in a previous paper, we proposed to improve spool agility by inducing unstable transient flow forces {{by the use of}} negative damping lengths. In the present paper, how steady flow forces can be manipulated to improve spool agility is examined through fundamental momentum analysis, CFD analysis and experimental studies. Particularly, it is found that two previously ignored components- viscosity effect and non-orifice momentum flux, have strong influence on steady flow forces. For positive damping lengths, viscosity increases the steady flow force, whereas for negative damping lengths, viscosity has the tendency of reducing steady flow forces. Also, by slightly modifying the non-orifice port geometry, the non-orifice flux can also be manipulated so as to reduce steady flow force. Therefore, both transient and steady flow forces, {{can also be used to}} improve the agility of single <b>stage</b> electrohydraulic <b>valves...</b>|$|R

25|$|The {{mechanism}} {{inside the}} first stage can be of the diaphragm type or the piston type. Both types can be balanced or unbalanced. Unbalanced regulators have the cylinder pressure pushing the first <b>stage</b> upstream <b>valve</b> closed, which is opposed by the intermediate stage pressure and a spring. As cylinder pressure falls the closing force is less, so the regulated pressure increases at lower tank pressure. To keep this pressure rise within acceptable limits the high-pressure orifice size is limited, but this decreases the total flow capacity of the regulator. A balanced regulator keeps about the same ease of breathing at all depths and pressures, by using the cylinder pressure to also indirectly oppose {{the opening of the}} first <b>stage</b> <b>valve.</b>|$|R

2500|$|Excessive work of {{breathing}}: High work {{of breathing}} {{can be caused}} by high inhalation resistance, high exhalation resistance or both.

It can usually can be improved by servicing and tuning, but some regulators cannot deliver high flow at great depths without high work of breathing.

50|$|Other freeflows may {{be caused}} by the second <b>stage</b> <b>valve</b> jamming due to grit or {{corrosion}} products fouling the movement of the valve poppet, or the purge valve sticking in the depressed position. These can sometimes be stopped by pressing the purge button a few times to free up the works. If all else fails, the diver can breathe from a freeflowing demand valve by allowing excess air to escape from the sides of the mouth and the exhaust valve, which may allow a safe ascent, or at least the use of as much remaining gas as possible. When a full-face mask is used, excess gas will be vented through the exhaust valve and around the mask skirt, usually allowing the diver to continue to breathe without difficulty during the freeflow. This does not help after the cylinder has emptied.|$|R

MethodsMedical records of patients were reviewed retrospectively and divided into two groups. All cases received single <b>stage</b> <b>valve</b> implantation in which the tube was inserted primarily into the anterior chamber. In cases with Baerveldt implants, the silicone tube was ligated near its plate location with a single absorbable suture. Group 1 included patients with Baerveldt glaucoma implant model BG 101 – 350, while group 2 included patients with Ahmed valve implant model S- 2. Patients’ data collected ranged over the period from 2001 to 2008. The minimum follow up period was 6 month; maximum follow up period was 8 years. All patients were below 18 years of age. Success was considered if last postoperative IOP was between 8 and 24 mm Hg (with or without medications), no additional glaucoma surgery after valve implantation, and absence of visually significant complications. ResultsGroup 1 included 20 cases and group 2 included 11 cases. Long term success rate based on criterion defined was 80 % for group 1 (Baerveldt) with average IOP postoperatively on last follow-up of 19. 6 mm Hg.

25|$|As gas {{leaves the}} {{cylinder}} it decreases in {{pressure in the}} first stage, becoming very cold due to adiabatic expansion. Where the ambient water temperature is less than 5°C any water {{in contact with the}} regulator may freeze. If this ice jams the diaphragm or piston spring, preventing the valve closing, a free-flow may ensue that can empty a full cylinder within a minute or two, and the free-flow causes further cooling in a positive feedback loop. Generally the water that freezes is in the ambient pressure chamber around a spring that keeps the valve open and not moisture in the breathing gas from the cylinder, but that is also possible if the air is not adequately filtered. The modern trend of using plastics to replace metal components in regulators encourages freezing because it insulates the inside of a cold regulator from the warmer surrounding water. Some regulators are provided with heat exchange fins in areas where cooling due to air expansion is a problem, such as around the second <b>stage</b> <b>valve</b> seat on some regulators.|$|R
