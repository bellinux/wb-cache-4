Subsequently the IgM titre gradually decreased. Specific anti-leptospiral IgG was detected later and increased gradually to reach almost the same level as the IgM titre after two to three months. During the initial stage of the infection, when the microscopic agglutination titre was still negative or very low, a high IgM titre was accompanied by a negative or very low IgG titre in every case. After the initial stage a substantial IgG titre was also detectable.

40|$|SUMMARY. An {{analysis}} {{is made of}} the antibody response to Coxiella burneti Phase- 1 and Phase- 2 antigens, as measured by immunofluores-cence in the IgM, IgG or IgA immunoglobulin classes, or by comple-ment-fixation, in patients with acute and chronic Q fever and in vaccinated or skin-tested subjects. In acute (primary) Q fever, <b>IgM</b> <b>specific</b> antibodies to Phase- 1 antigen are present in early convalescence together with IgM, IgG, IgA and CF antibodies to Phase- 2 antigen. <b>IgM</b> <b>specific</b> antibody may persist for at least 678 days after onset of the acute illness. Patients with chronic Q fever have no <b>IgM</b> <b>specific</b> antibody to Phase- 1 or- 2 antigens, or only at very low levels; high levels of specific antibody in the IgG and IgA classes, together with C F antibody to both antigenic phases, appear to be characteristic. The serological response in initially seronegative, vaccinated subjects is mainly to Phase- 1 antigen in the TgM fraction, {{and to a lesser}} degree to Phase- 2 antigen by CF and in IgM and IgG classes. Subjects who were equivocally seropositive before vaccination showed IgA and IgG specific antibody responses to Phase- 1 antigen and CF and IgG class responses to Phase- 2 antigen. Similar antibody profiles were observed in patients who seroconverted after a positive skin-test.

40|$|Three {{commercial}} Lyme disease Western immunoblotting (WB) kits and the C 6 Borrelia burgdorferi (Lyme) {{enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay}} (ELISA) kit {{were compared}} using two commercially available performance panels from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and Boston Biomedica (BBI). Combined, the panels consisted of 52 characterized specimens. Immunoglobulin G (IgG) sensitivity was similar for the three WB products. The BBI and Marblot WBs were more specific for IgG antibodies, while the Virablot was the most sensitive for IgM antibody. The BBI WB was 100 % <b>specific</b> for <b>IgM,</b> while Marblot was 97 % and Virablot was 77 % <b>specific</b> for <b>IgM.</b> The C 6 ELISA {{was found to be}} 100 % sensitive. Four false-positive C 6 results were identified in patients that had clinically and microbiologically confirmed Lyme disease but were not detected by the CDC reference methods.

40|$|Cancer therapies {{can provide}} {{substantially}} improved survival {{in some patients}} while other seemingly similar patients receive little or no benefit. Strategies to identify patients likely to respond well to a given therapy could significantly improve health care outcomes by maximizing clinical benefits while reducing toxicities and adverse effects. Using a glycan microarray assay, we recently reported that pretreatment serum levels of <b>IgM</b> <b>specific</b> to blood group A trisaccharide (BG-Atri) correlate positively with overall survival of cancer patients on PROSTVAC-VF therapy. The results suggested anti-BG-Atri IgM measured prior to treatment {{could serve as a}} biomarker for identifying patients likely to benefit from PROSTVAC-VF. For continued development and clinical application of serum <b>IgM</b> <b>specific</b> to BG-Atri as a predictive biomarker, a clinical assay was needed. In this study, we developed and validated a Luminex-based clinical assay for measuring serum <b>IgM</b> <b>specific</b> to BG-Atri. <b>IgM</b> levels were measured with the Luminex assay and compared to levels measured using the microarray for 126 healthy individuals and 77 prostate cancer patients. This assay provided reproducible and consistent results with low %CVs, and tolerance ranges were established for the assay. IgM levels measured using the Luminex assay were found to be highly correlated to the microarray results with R values of 0. 93 - 0. 95. This assay is a Laboratory Developed Test (LDT) and is suitable for evaluating thousands of serum samples in CLIA certified laboratories that have validated the assay. In addition, the study demonstrates that discoveries made using neoglycoprotein-based microarrays can be readily migrated to a clinical assay...|$|R

With antisera <b>specific</b> for rabbit <b>IgM</b> as well as with antisera directed against allotypic determinants <b>specific</b> for <b>IgM</b> or IgG, {{it was possible to}} show that about nine-tenths of the immunoglobulin-positive lymphocytes carry IgM molecules on their surface. With antisera directed against a- and b-locus determinants, it was also possible to demonstrate that both heavy and light chains were present in the surface immunoglobulins. Furthermore, in animals which were heterozygous at the a or the b locus, it was found that each lymphocyte had immunoglobulins synthesized under the influence of only one of two alleles.
