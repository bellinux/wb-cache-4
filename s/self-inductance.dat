25|$|For simple higher-frequency filter circuits, or in voltage {{regulator}} or voltage doubler circuits, low-cost metallized polyester film capacitors provide long-term stability, and can replace more-expensive tantalum capacitors. Because capacitors pass AC signals but block DC, film capacitors with their high insulation resistance and low <b>self-inductance</b> are well-suited as signal coupling capacitors for higher frequencies. For similar reasons, film capacitors {{are widely used}} as decoupling capacitors to suppress noise or transients.|$|E

The diagonal coefficients Lm,m {{are called}} coefficients of <b>self-inductance,</b> the off-diagonal elements are called coefficients of mutual inductance. The coefficients of inductance are constant, {{as long as}} no magnetizable material with nonlinear characteristics is involved.

25|$|Lightning {{protection}} systems {{are designed to}} mitigate the effects of lightning through connection to extensive grounding systems that provide a large surface area connection to earth. The large area is required to dissipate the high current of a lightning strike without damaging the system conductors by excess heat. Since lightning strikes are pulses of energy with very high frequency components, grounding systems for lightning protection tend to use short straight runs of conductors to reduce the <b>self-inductance</b> and skin effect.|$|E

25|$|These {{effects are}} derived from two {{fundamental}} observations of physics: a steady current creates a steady magnetic field described by Oersted's law, and a time-varying magnetic field induces an electromotive force (EMF) in nearby conductors, which is described by Faraday's law of induction. According to Lenz's law, a changing electric current through a circuit that contains inductance induces a proportional voltage, which opposes the change in current (<b>self-inductance).</b> The varying field in this circuit may also induce an EMF in neighbouring circuits (mutual inductance).|$|E
25|$|In {{the most}} general case, {{inductance}} {{can be calculated}} from Maxwell's equations. Many important cases can be solved using simplifications. Where high frequency currents are considered, with skin effect, the surface current densities and magnetic field may be obtained by solving the Laplace equation. Where the conductors are thin wires, <b>self-inductance</b> still depends on the wire radius {{and the distribution of}} the current in the wire. This current distribution is approximately constant (on the surface or in the volume of the wire) for a wire radius much smaller than other length scales.|$|E

2500|$|Snubber {{circuits}} usually incorporate film capacitors, mostly {{polypropylene film}} caps. The most important criteria for this application are a low <b>self-inductance,</b> low ESR, and very high peak current capability. The so-called [...] "snubber” capacitors sometimes have some additional special construction features. The <b>self-inductance</b> {{is reduced by}} slimmer designs with narrower width of the electrodes. By double-sided metallization or the film/foil construction of the electrodes, the ESR also can be reduced, increasing the peak current capability.

2500|$|Another {{technique}} {{to increase the}} surge current rating for film capacitors is a double-sided metallization. This can double the peak current rating. This design also halves the total <b>self-inductance</b> of the capacitor, because in effect, two inductors are connected in parallel, which allows less-unimpeded passage of faster pulses (higher so-called [...] "dV/dt" [...] rating).|$|E

40|$|We present {{analytical}} and numerical studies of pinned superconducting states of open-ended Josephson ladder arrays, neglecting inductances but taking edge effects into account. Treating the edge effects perturbatively, we find analytical approximations {{for three of}} these superconducting states [...] the no-vortex, fully-frustrated and single-vortex states [...] as functions of the dc bias current $I$ and the frustration $f$. Bifurcation theory is used to derive formulas for the depinning currents and critical frustrations at which the superconducting states disappear or lose dynamical stability as $I$ and $f$ are varied.

While building electromagnets, Henry discovered the electromagnetic phenomenon of <b>self-inductance.</b> He also discovered mutual inductance independently of Michael Faraday, (1791–1867), though Faraday was the first to make the discovery and publish his results. Henry developed the electromagnet into a practical device. He invented a precursor to the electric doorbell (specifically a bell that could be rung at a distance via an electric wire, 1831) and electric relay (1835). The SI unit of inductance, the henry, is named in his honor. Henry's work on the electromagnetic relay was the basis of the practical electrical telegraph, invented by Samuel F. B.

2500|$|In 1887, Heaviside {{worked with}} his brother Arthur on a paper {{entitled}} [...] "The Bridge System of Telephony". However the paper was blocked by Arthur's superior, William Henry Preece of the Post Office, because part of the proposal was that loading coils (inductors) should be added to telephone and telegraph lines to increase their self-induction and correct the distortion which they suffered. Preece had recently declared <b>self-inductance</b> to be the great enemy of clear transmission. Heaviside was also convinced that Preece was behind the sacking of the editor of The Electrician which brought his long-running series of articles to a halt (until 1891). There was {{a long history of}} animosity between Preece and Heaviside. [...] Heaviside considered Preece to be mathematically incompetent; an assessment supported by the biographer Paul J. Nahin: [...] "Preece was a powerful government official, enormously ambitious, and in some remarkable ways, an utter blockhead." [...] Preece's motivations in suppressing Heaviside's work were more to do with protecting Preece's own reputation and avoiding having to admit error than any perceived faults in Heaviside's work.|$|E
2500|$|During his {{development}} of Maxwell's Theory, J. J. Thomson (1881) recognized that charged bodies {{are harder to}} set in motion than uncharged bodies. Electrostatic fields behave as if they add an [...] "electromagnetic mass" [...] to the mechanical mass of the bodies. I.e., according to Thomson, electromagnetic energy corresponds to a certain mass. This was interpreted as some form of <b>self-inductance</b> of the electromagnetic field. He also noticed that the mass of a body in motion is increased by a constant quantity. Thomson's work was continued and perfected by FitzGerald, Heaviside (1888), and George Frederick Charles Searle (1896, 1897). For the electromagnetic mass they gave— in modern notation— the formula , where [...] is the electromagnetic mass and [...] is the electromagnetic energy. Heaviside and Searle also recognized that the increase of the mass of a body is not constant and varies with its velocity. Consequently, Searle noted the impossibility of superluminal velocities, because infinite energy would be needed to exceed the speed of light. Also for Lorentz (1899), the integration of the speed-dependence of masses recognized by Thomson was especially important. He noticed that the mass not only varied due to speed, but is also dependent on the direction, and he introduced what Abraham later called [...] "longitudinal" [...] and [...] "transverse" [...] mass. (The transverse mass corresponds to what later was called relativistic mass.) ...|$|E
40|$|Isolation {{transformers}} {{have often}} been considered a "cure-all " for a plethora of grounding and power line noise problems. Contrary to popular opinion, isolation transformers cannot effectively isolate a circuit from noise caused by potentials between various system and common power grounds without the intelligent use of shielding and ground design. This paper describes the theory behind the isolation transformer, its physical and electrical characteristics and its proper application. General Transformer Theory All transformers provide isolation. They are generally constructed with a primary and secondary winding closely wrapped about the same ferrous core. Typical commercial transformers also incorporate a single Faraday shield between the primary and secondary windings to divert noise, which would normally be electrically coupled between the primary and secondary windings to ground as shown in Figure 1. The mechanism through which this electrical coupling of noise occurs is the capacitance between the coils of the primary and secondary windings of the transformer, which does not include a Faraday shield. This same capacitance limits the upper frequency bandpass of the transformer {{in much the same}} manner as the mutual and <b>self-inductances</b> of the device determine its low frequency cutoff.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{reports on}} a {{microfabrication}} technology for implementing high-performance passive components suitable for advanced RF front-ends. This technology offers three metal layers with different thicknesses, one dielectric, and two sacrificial layers, enabling the fabrication of continuously tuned capacitors, capacitive and ohmic switches, as well as high-Q inductors all on a single chip. To demonstrate the versatility of this technology, several passive components are fabricated on a Borosilicate glass substrate (εr = 4. 6). A high-Q tunable capacitor is fabricated exhibiting an electrostatic tuning range of more than 6 : 1. The temperature variation of capacitance from 223 to 333 K is less than 9 %, and the tuning speed is better than 80 µs. To achieve a higher zero-bias capacitance, a tunable capacitor bank is also implemented, which can be tuned from 2. 2 pF to 6. 1 pF. In addition, a coupled inductor pair with <b>self-inductances</b> of 15 and 21 nH is implemented showing Qs exceeding 40 at 800 MHz.
