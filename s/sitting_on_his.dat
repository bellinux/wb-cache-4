5|$|At the office, Michael Scott (Steve Carell) announces to the {{employees}} that Deangelo Vickers (Will Ferrell) {{will be his}} co-host at the Dundies. The Dundies are an annual award program created by Michael to motivate his employees. The idea of performance is worrisome to Deangelo, but Michael insists he take the job. Michael brings some of the staff together {{in the conference room}} to help Deangelo get prepared for the show, but he struggles to be humorous. Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) tries to help him, saying he should just think of performing like conducting a meeting, but Michael objects, wanting Deangelo to mimic his style. Michael tries a number of different things to help Deangelo, such as <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> stomach and making him listen to a Walkman at full volume so he cannot hear himself think, but none are effective.|$|E

25|$|On 2 November 2012, as Henry {{was telling}} the story of how he had injured his finger the {{previous}} day, his co-presenters and crew slowly left the set, until Henry was left <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> own at the desk, in the dark.

When {{he lived in}} Great Clowes Street in Higher Broughton, Salford, he was often seen <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> front door steps.

25|$|Following the divisional {{court hearing}} into Lutfur Rahman {{application}} to dismiss and the petitioners {{application for a}}n adjournment of their application for a protective costs order, Supperstone J <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> own heard an application by the petitioners to move the trial outside of Tower Hamlets for fear of intimidation by supporters of Rahman. This request {{was rejected by the}} court which held the prospect of large number of attendees and the associated potential for public rowdiness was not enough to justify ignoring the long-standing provision within primary legislation requiring trials to be held in the local government area for which the election was held, in this case the London Borough of Tower Hamlets.|$|E
25|$|Whilst {{growing up}} on his family's farm in Pongakawa (near Te Puke), Hulme learned to drive a truck while <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> father's lap, and {{by the age of}} six, he was driving solo. He left school and went to work in a garage. He saved up enough money to buy an MG TF, {{promptly}} entering this in hillclimbing events. After that his father brought a MGA for him. After making impressive progress he purchased a F2 Cooper-Climax, subsequently being chosen for the New Zealand Driver to Europe program, along with fellow Kiwi, George Lawton. The pair of young New Zealander began competing in Formula Junior and Formula Two across Europe, in a Cooper-BMC and Cooper–Ford respectively. Hulme won the 1960 Gran Premio di Pescara for Formula Juniors, but the newspapers back in New Zealand made no mention of this, as they wrote only about Bruce McLaren. However, the year, 1960 ended in disaster, when Lawton crashed during a race at Roskilde (Denmark) dying in Hulme's arms.|$|E

500|$|Later {{the same}} season, Hill became a regular {{member of the}} South Australian team, making his Sheffield Shield debut against Victoria.

The English team returned to the Adelaide Oval and this time Hill scored his maiden first-class century, 150 not out, against quality bowlers including Tom Richardson and Bobby Peel.

500|$|One of {{the most}} {{controversial}} aspects of Australia's conduct of the Vietnam War had been the employment of a barrier minefield around Phuoc Tuy from 1967 to 1969. Wilton maintained that the minefield was already under construction when he first learned of it, and that he considered the decision within the purview of the commander on the ground, Brigadier Stuart Graham. When confronted with the increasing casualties among Australian troops from mines evidently lifted from the area by the Viet Cong, he pointed out that the South Vietnamese, who had been expected to patrol the minefield, were not playing their part. Wilton further believed that the barrier minefield was an innovative solution to the problems facing the task force and that the commander's decision to implement it was [...] "better than <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> backside and not trying anything". He rejected suggestions by critics that the minefield was [...] "the biggest blunder" [...] Australia made in Vietnam, declaring that this was [...] "like being wise after the event".|$|E
