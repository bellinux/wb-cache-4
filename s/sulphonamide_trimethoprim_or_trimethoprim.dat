During an average follow-up of 3. 8 years, 112 (17 %) participants received at least one UTI antibiotic prescription. Intention-to-treat analyses showed that pravastatin was associated with a reduced total number of UTI antibiotic prescriptions (relative risk, 0. 43; 95 % CI, 0. 21 - 0. 88) and occurrence of second UTI antibiotic prescriptions [hazard ratio (HR), 0. 25; 95 % CI, 0. 08 - 0. 77].

An outbreak of Salmonella typhimurium infection, affecting 39 people, spread over a wide area in North West England and North Wales in April and May 1991, was detected thanks {{to the practice of}} sending specimens to the national reference laboratory where phage typing and characterizing of antibiotic resistance patterns enabled the identification of a cluster of distinctive isolates (S. typhimurium DT 193 resistant to <b>sulphonamides,</b> <b>trimethoprim</b> and furazolidone). An investigation, involving twenty environmental health departments in addition to health authorities and the Public Health Laboratory Service, showed an association between the illness and eating loose sliced cooked ham (P = 0. 004). Detailed tracing of the chain of supply of the ham showed this to be particularly cooked ham originating from a single small local producer (P = 0. 00003). Further investigation of that producer revealed that a batch of ham distributed on one day in early April was undercooked due to a malfunction in cooking equipment...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY. Patterns of {{resistance}} to antimicrobial agents were studied in 193 strains of coagulase-negative staphylococci isolated from hospital patients. Strains isolated from patients with malignant disease were significantly more often resistant to <b>sulphonamide,</b> <b>trimethoprim,</b> gentamicin and methicillin than were strains from other sources. Susceptibility to various P-lactam antibiotics and aminoglycosides was investigated in members {{of the two most}} frequent species: Staphylo-coccus epidermidis and S. haemolyticus. S. huemolyticus strains were not only more often resistant to methicillin than S. epidermidis strains (respectively 8 1 % and 17 %) but they were more highly resistant (mean MICs respectively 85 and 19 mg/L). Methicillin-resistant S. haemoly-ticus strains were highly resistant to nine other 8 -lactam antibiotics, whereas methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis strains showed both lower levels and a narrower spectrum of cross-resistance. Resistance to methicillin in members of both species was “heterogeneous”, i. e., only a minority of cells in a culture showed significant resistance. Almost all gentamicin-resistant strains were sensitive to netilmicin and amikacin; rifampicin, vancomycin and teicoplanin were also highly active in uitro...|$|R
40|$|Colistin resistance, {{although}} uncommon, {{is increasingly}} being reported among Gram-negative clinical pathogens, and an under-standing of {{its impact on}} the activity of antimicrobials is now evolving. We evaluated the potential for synergy of colistin plus trimethoprim, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (1 / 19 ratio), or vancomycin against 12 isolates of Acinetobacter baumannii (n 4), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n 4), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (n 4). The strains included six multidrug-resistant clinical isolates, K. pneumoniae ATCC 700603, A. baumannii ATCC 19606, P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853, and their colistin-resistant de-rivatives (KPm 1, ABm 1, and PAm 1, respectively). Antimicrobial susceptibilities were assessed by broth microdilution and popu-lation analysis profiles. The potential for synergy of colistin combinations was evaluated using a checkerboard assay, as well as static time-kill experiments at 0. 5 and 0. 25 MIC. TheMIC ranges of vancomycin, trimethoprim, and trimethoprim-sulfame-thoxazole (1 / 19) were> 128, 4 to> 128, and 2 / 38 to> 128 / 2, 432 g/ml, respectively. Colistin resistance demonstrated little im-pact on vancomycin, <b>trimethoprim,</b> <b>or</b> trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole MIC values. Isolates with subpopulations heteroge-neously resistant to colistin were observed to various degrees in all tested isolates. In time-kill assays, all tested combinations were synergistic against KPm 1 at 0. 25 MIC and 0. 5 MIC and ABm 1 and PAm 1 at 0. 5 MIC. In contrast, none of the tested combinations demonstrated synergy against any colistin-susceptible P. aeruginosa isolates and clinical strains of K. pneumoniae isolates. Only colistin plus <b>trimethoprim</b> <b>or</b> trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was synergistic and bactericidal at 0. 5 MIC against K. pneumoniae ATCC 700603. Colistin resistance seems to promote the in vitro activity of unconventional colistin com...|$|R
40|$|Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) <b>or</b> <b>trimethoprim</b> (TMP) {{alone was}} given on a random {{double-blind}} basis to 26 {{young women to}} treat urinary tract infections. Fecal and introital aerobic bacterial floras were identified at 1, 7, 14, and 42 days to analyze changes in these floras or development of resistance to TMP or TM-SMX. Neither TMP alone nor the TMP-SMX combination administered for 2 weeks selected a resistant fecal or introital flora. In the few individuals who had strains resistant to TMP or TMP-SMX before initiation of therapy, these organisms did not persist once therapy began. Both programs effectively cleared the introitus and rectal areas of Enterobacteriaceae.

40|$|Summary. Trimethoprim {{was more}} potent than {{zidovudine}} as an inducer of the SOS response in Escherichia coli. The level of induction by each compound initially increased with rising drug concentration and then fell; this effect was less marked with zidovudine than with trimethoprim. The SOS response {{did not appear}} to be involved in the inhibition of bacterial multiplication as the MICs of <b>trimethoprim</b> <b>or</b> zidovudine for recA 430 and lexA 3 mutants, which are unable to induce the SOS response, were identical to the MICs for the parent strains. However, the bactericidal activity of each compound against strains deficient in the SOS response was reduced. This suggests that induction of the DNA repair system contributes to the bactericidal activity of the drugs...|$|R
