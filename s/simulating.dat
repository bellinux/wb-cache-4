40|$|In {{the present}} study, we {{discovered}} that mouse oocyte maturation was inhibited by <b>simulated</b> microgravity via disturbing spindle organization. We cultured mouse oocytes under microgravity condition <b>simulated</b> by NASA’s rotary cell culture system, examined the maturation rate and observed the spindle morphology (organization of cytoskeleton) during the mouse oocytes meiotic maturation. While the rate of germinal vesicle breakdown did not differ between 1 g gravity and <b>simulated</b> microgravity, rate of oocyte maturation decreased significantly in <b>simulated</b> microgravity. The rate of maturation was 8. 94 % in <b>simulated</b> microgravity and was 73. 0 % in 1 g gravity.

The spindle morphology observation shows that the microtubules and chromosomes can not form a complete spindle during oocyte meiotic maturation under <b>simulated</b> microgravity.

The perception of optically and mechanically <b>simulated</b> bumps and holes was tested experimentally. In an earlier article, we have described the active cursor technique, a method to <b>simulate</b> haptic feedback optically without resorting to special mechanical force feedback devices, commonly applied to produce haptic percepts in computer interfaces. The operation of the force feedback device is substituted by tiny displacements on the cursor position relative to the intended force. This method exploits the domination of the visual over the haptic modality. Results show that people can recognize optically <b>simulated</b> bump and hole structures and that active cursor displacements influence the haptic perception of bumps and holes. Depending on the <b>simulated</b> strength of the force, optically <b>simulated</b> haptic feedback can take precedence over mechanically <b>simulated</b> haptic feedback and also the other way around.
