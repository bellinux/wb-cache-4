A possible method for describing the mean and rms quantities based on a modification of Coles' law of the wake and Prandtl's mixing length theory is presented. The model is validated against related experiments from literature and new measurements conducted at DLR Braunschweig. Additionally, a comparison between the von Kármán spectrum for isotropic turbulence and the measured spectra inside the <b>seperated</b> boundary layer is given. The results strongly suggest that the spectra as well as the mean and rms values of the <b>seperated</b> flow can be modeled with the proposed approaches...|$|R
40|$|Cutting a polytope is a {{very natural}} way to produce new classes of {{interesting}} polytopes. Moreover, {{it has been very}} enlightening to explore which algebraic and combinatorial properties of the orignial polytope are hereditary to its subpolytopes obtained by a cut. In this work, we put our attention to all the <b>seperating</b> hyperplanes for some given polytope (integral and convex) and study the existence and classification of such hyperplanes. We prove the exitence of <b>seperating</b> hyperplanes for the order and chain polytopes for any finite posets that are not a single chain; prove there are no such hyperplanes for any Birkhoff polytopes. Moreover, we give a complete <b>seperating</b> hyperplane classification for the unit cube and its subpolytopes obtained by one cut, together with some partial classification results for order and chain polytopes...|$|R

60|$|The vacuity {{his heart}} endured of any deep {{interest}} in life during his long absence {{from his native}} country had had a singular effect upon his ideas. There was a curious feeling of unreality attached by him to his foreign life {{in comparison with the}} years of his youth. All the time he had passed out of England was as a dream, and all the interest of his soul[,] all his affections belonged to events which had happened and persons who had existed sixteen years before. It was strange when you heard him talk to see how he passed over this lapse of time as a night of visions; while the remembrances of his youth standing <b>seperate</b> as they did from his after life had lost none of their vigour. He talked of my Mother as if she had lived but a few weeks before; not that he expressed poignant grief, but his discription of her person, and his relation of all anecdotes connected with her was thus fervent and vivid.|$|E

40|$|For the {{separation}} of different plastics we used the melting temperature of the material, sticking to a heated surface. In a laboratory scale a seperation kit was constructed, where mixed granulates of different plastics were <b>seperated</b> by a heated drum, which was feeded by a belt carrying the granulates in a mono-layer. The surface-temperature of the separating drum was selected depending on the melting temperatures of the granulates, starting with the lowest melting temperature of the granulates. Granulates with higher melting temperatures were not collected by the drum and so with increasing temperatures of the <b>seperating</b> drum a step by step separation of different plastic was achieved. Selected granulates of PE, PVC and PA were <b>seperated</b> with a separation {{rate of more than}} 90 %. Experiments executed with granulates of plastic wastes from the recycling of cable-shredder were less successfull.

6000|$|But when I {{compared}} the good & evil {{of the world}} & wished to divide them into two <b>seperate</b> principles I found them inextricably intwined together & I was again cast into perplexity & doubt--I might have considered the earth as an imperfect formation where having bad materials {{to work on the}} Creator could only palliate the evil effects of his combinations but I saw a wanton malignity in many parts & particularly in the mind of man that baffled me a delight in mischief a love of evil for evils sake--a siding of the multitude--a dastardly applause which in their hearts the crowd gave to triumphant wick[ed]ness over lowly virtue that filled me with painful sensations. Meditation, painful & continual thought only encreased my doubts--I dared not commit the blasphemy of ascribing the slightest evil to a beneficent God--To whom then should I ascribe the creation? To two principles? Which was the upermost? They were certainly independant for neither could the good spirit allow the existence of evil or the evil one the existence of good--Tired of these doubts to which I could form no probable solution--Sick of forming theories which I destroyed as quickly as I built them I was one evening on the top of Hymettus beholding the lovely prospect as the sun set in the glowing sea--I looked towards Athens & in my heart I exclaimed--oh busy hive of men!

60|$|At length {{the east}} began to brighten, and the {{comfortable}} light of morning streamed into my room. I was weary with watching {{and for some}} time I had combated with the heavy sleep that weighed down my eyelids: but now, no longer fearful, I threw myself on my bed. I sought for repose although I did not hope for forgetfulness; I knew I should be pursued by dreams, but did not dread the frightful one that I really had. I thought that I had risen and went to seek my father to inform him of my determination to <b>seperate</b> myself from him. I sought him in the house, in the park, {{and then in the}} fields and the woods, but I could not find him. At length I saw him at some distance, seated under a tree, and when he perceived me he waved his hand several times, beckoning me to approach; there was something unearthly in his mien that awed and chilled me, but I drew near. When at [a] short distance from him I saw that he was deadlily [sic] pale, and clothed in flowing garments of white. Suddenly he started up and fled from me; I pursued him: we sped over the fields, and by the skirts of woods, and on the banks of rivers; he flew fast and I followed. We came at last, methought, to the brow of a huge cliff that over hung the sea which, troubled by the winds, dashed against its base at a distance. I heard the roar of the waters: he held his course right on towards the brink and I became breathless with fear lest he should plunge down the dreadful precipice; I tried to augment my speed, but my knees failed beneath me, yet I had just reached him; just caught a part of his flowing robe, when he leapt down and I awoke with a violent scream. I was trembling and my pillow was wet with my tears; for a few moments my heart beat hard, but the bright beams of the sun and the chirping of the birds quickly restored me to myself, and I rose with a languid spirit, yet wondering what events the day would bring forth. Some time passed before I summoned courage to ring the bell for my servant, and when she came I still dared not utter my father's name. I ordered her to bring my breakfast to my room, and was again left alone--yet still I could make no resolve, but only thought that I might write a note to my father to beg his permission to pay a visit to a relation who lived about thirty miles off, and who had before invited me to her house, but I had refused for then I could not quit my suffering father. When the servant came back she gave me a letter.|$|E
