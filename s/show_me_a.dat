25|$|Pere Maire, the Provicaire of the Roman Catholic Mission here, {{called this}} morning to <b>show</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> {{telegram}} which he had just received from a native priest of his Mission at Tali. The telegram, which is in Latin, is dated Tali, the 24th April, and is {{to the effect that}} the lamas of Batang have killed PP. Musset and Soulie, together with, it is believed, 200 converts. The chapel at Atentse has been burnt down, and the lamas hold the road to Tachien-lu. Pere Bourdonnec (another member of the French Tibet Mission) begs that Pere Maire will take action.|$|E

500|$|Ria Brown, the biographer of {{competitive}} swimmer Anita Lhoest, claims Lhoest terminated a pregnancy by Eastwood without consulting him {{at one point}} during their late 1950s to early 1960s affair. Restaurant critic Gael Greene admitted to an affair with Eastwood that began when she was assigned to interview him on the set of 1970's Two Mules for Sister Sara. A fling with French model Cathy Reghin around the same time was one of his few extramarital involvements to receive press coverage of any kind during the fact. According to McGilligan, Eastwood had many other affairs, including with co-stars Inger Stevens (Hang 'Em High), Jean Seberg (Paint Your Wagon) and Jo Ann Harris (The Beguiled), as well as actresses Jill Banner, Catherine Deneuve, and Susan St. James, columnist Bridget Byrne and singer Keely Smith while married to Johnson, who, after a trial separation and lingering bout of hepatitis during the mid-1960s, expressed desire to reconcile and start a family. They had two children together: Kyle Eastwood (born May 19, 1968) and Alison Eastwood (born May 22, 1972). In 1972, Eastwood met married actress (later director) Sondra Locke. The two began living together while filming The Outlaw Josey Wales in the autumn of 1975, by which time, according to Locke, [...] "He had told me that there was no real relationship left between him and Maggie." [...] Locke wrote in her autobiography, [...] "Clint seemed astonished at his need for me, even admitting that he'd never been faithful to one woman — because he'd [...] "never been in love before," [...] he confided. He even made up a song about it: [...] "She made me monogamous." [...] That flattered and delighted me. I would never doubt his faithfulness and his love for me." [...] Locke moved into the Sherman Oaks house Eastwood had once shared with Johnson (who by then lived full-time in Pebble Beach), but felt uncomfortable there because [...] "psychologically, it would always be Maggie's." [...] "Finally I told Clint that I couldn't live there any longer," [...] writes Locke. The couple moved to Bel-Air in a fixer-upper Locke spent three years renovating. She underwent two abortions and a tubal ligation in the late 1970s and was most reluctant about the second abortion, noting [...] "I couldn't help but think that that baby, with both Clint's and my best qualities, would be extraordinary." [...] Johnson made no secret of her dislike for Locke, even though the two women never met. [...] "Maggie placed severe rules on my relationship with the kids. Apparently, she never forgave me ... After she learned that Clint had taken me onto her property to <b>show</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> baby deer that had just been born there, she laid down a rule that I was never to be allowed there again. I was not even allowed to phone the Pebble Beach house." [...] In 1978 Johnson filed for legal separation from Eastwood, but did not file for divorce until May 1984, a divorce which was finalized that November with Johnson receiving a straight cash payment reported to be between $25 and $30million.|$|E

2500|$|Between 1906 and 1908, a {{movement}} developed to eliminate football from university sports programs {{on grounds that}} it was too brutal and was attracting professionalism to the college campuses.
