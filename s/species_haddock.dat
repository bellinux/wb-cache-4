40|$|The {{twentieth century}} has wjtnessed the {{exponential}} growth of world-wide populations, {{and with it}} the over-exploitation of previously abundant resources. The limits inherent in terrestrial food production have necessitated increased utilization of wor 1 d marine resources. Improved technology has enabled fishing fleets to harvest with a level of efficiency that in many cases has endangered the existence of commercial fishstocks. In the northwestern Atlantic, the price of ever-increasing harvesting has been the near decimation of several <b>species.</b> <b>Haddock,</b> herring and bluefin tuna are only a few stocks which have suffered from over-fishing. Blue marlin and white marlin are two species which have similarly been exploited with greater and greater frequency, but for very different reasons. Being large, predatory fish that are often found in association with yellowfin and other tunas, marlin are susceptible to being caught as by-catch in fisheries primarily directed at tuna. That the incidental by-catch of non-tuna species on longline is in high proportion to total catch is not news, but that this incidental catch might seriously affect fishstocks is only now becoming apparent. In fact, until L. J. Hoey presented his dissertation on the composition of longline by-catch, virtually nothing was known about how longlining activities in the north Atlantic might be affecting the ecology of the region...|$|E
40|$|The main {{objective}} of discard sampling programmes is to estimate annual total discards of fish species whose stocks are routinely assessed from catch data. The Scottish discard programme {{is based on}} a stratified random design, and a ratio estimator is used to estimate total discards independently in each stratum. Total discards are then estimated by summing across strata. However, the small number of trips that can be sampled by scientific observers from fisheries institutes creates problems with this estimator. Here, a simulated population of fishing trips is used to investigate alternative estimators of total discards for the main fish <b>species</b> (<b>haddock</b> Melanogrammus aeglefinus, whiting - Merlangius merlangus, and cod - Gadus morhua) targeted by Scottish demersal vessels in the North Sea and the West of Scotland. The results show that when the sample size in each stratum is very small, the current methodology - independent ratio estimation in each stratum - can be very biased and imprecise. However, an alternative ratio estimator that relies on a collapsed stratification has negligible bias and greater precision. We use this alternative estimator to estimate total annual discards of haddock, whiting, and cod in the North Sea and West of Scotland from 1988 to 1993...|$|E
40|$|Biological {{sampling}} of fish during research vessel survey cruises is often conducted using length-stratified age sampling schemes. Maturity-at-length or age {{may be affected}} by changes in sampling protocols, and may potentially result in biased estimates of matu-ration patterns. In such cases, these estimates may be artifacts of the sampling activities and not accurate estimators of stock dynamics. In 1992, the Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC) modified the length-strati-fied age sampling protocol used during semi-annual research vessel bottom trawl surveys. While demonstrable gains in the precision of age-length keys for many species have been obtained with the new protocols, no systematic evaluation {{of the effects of}} the sampling protocol change upon maturity-at-length or age has been performed. In this study, potential effects of changes in sampling protocol were assessed for two groundfish <b>species,</b> <b>haddock</b> (Melanogrammus aeglefinus) and American plaice (Hippoglossoides platessoides). Over the critical size range of maturity for both species, significantly different length frequency sampling was obtained from each sampling scheme during the 10 -year study period. Analyses for American plaice were complicated by the sexually dimorphic growth. Simulation techniques were employed to assess whether the observed changes in maturity estimates were a result of the changed sampling protocols. The simulations suggested that these changes were real phenomena and not artifacts caused by changes in sampling. Key words: length-stratified sampling, maturity-at-lengt...|$|E

In this period the gadoid species in Scottish waters all produced a series of exceptionally strong year classes which have not been seen repeated in the intervening period. This great abundance, coupled with the price support system that subsidised fishermen when prices fell, contained in the CFP, lead to heavy investment in new boats, equipment and processing capacity in the Scottish whitefish fleet.|$|R

40|$|Exploitation {{alters the}} age {{structure}} of fish stocks. Several stock-specific {{studies have suggested}} that changes in the age structure might have consequences for subsequent recruitment, but the evidence is not universal. To investigate how common such effects are among 39 Northeast Atlantic fish stocks, relationships were tested between age structure (spawner mean age, age diversity, and proportion of recruit spawners) and recruitment (number of recruits, sensitivity to environment, and recruitment variability). Significant correlations in the expected direction were observed for a few stocks, but not for the majority; significant correlations in the opposite direction were also found. Meta-analyses combining the stock-level tests revealed that none of the effects were significant overall. However, effects were significant for some <b>species</b> (cod, <b>haddock,</b> and plaice) and indices. The low variability in the age structure might explain the absence of significant effects for individual stocks. Other reasons could be the absence of a biological basis (reproductive characteristics not dependent on age) or the stronger influence of environmental variability than of age structure on recruitment...|$|R
40|$|Responsible sheries {{management}} involve, {{among other}} things, operations to avoid catches of juvenile sh. Technical measures of shing gears to exclude small sh are thus generally regulated. Knowledge {{and control over}} the size selection characteristics of the shing gear are therefore required, and the escaping sh should survive for the size selection to be a meaningful action. This thesis consists of four papers that deal with size selectivity and escape mortality of cod (Gadus morhua), haddock (Melanogrammus aegle nus) and saithe (Pollachius virens) in the Barents Sea bottom trawl sheries. Our {{studies show that the}} trawl ground gears contribute to the overall size selectivity of bottom trawls. Netting bags were rigged underneath a commercial trawl with a rockhopper gear, along the shing line, to collect sh that passed beneath the trawl. Approximately one third of the cod, a quarter of the haddock and seven percent of saithe available to the trawl escaped below the shing line. Cod escape rates were highly length dependent with an estimated length at 50 % retention (L 50) of 38. 5 cm and selection range (L 75 − L 25 = SR) of 34. 1 cm. Length dependence was less pronounced for haddock, and the escape rate of saithe was not length dependent. Some of the sh had been overrun by the gear as evidenced by scale abrasions and video observations. The size selection of a bottom trawl for cod with the mandatory con guration of a sorting grid with 55 mm bar spacings and a 135 mm diamond mesh codend was compared to that of conventional codends of 135 and 155 mm mesh sizes. Previous indirect comparisons have indicated sharper selection (narrower SR) for sorting grids than conventional codends. Based on these comparisons, the use of grids was made mandatory in the Barents Sea bottom trawl shery for cod. Our experimental studies demonstrated no evidence that the grid and mesh combination has sharper selection than conventional codends. The introduction of the grid corresponded to approx. 20 mm increase in mesh size, from 135 mm to 155 mm. The L 50 for the grid declined with increasing catch rates, but grid selection appeared less affected by seasonal variations in girth and sh condition than mesh selectivity. Mortality of cod, saithe and haddock that escaped through meshes and sorting grids were studied in four eld experiments. Cod and saithe mortality were negligible, suggesting that selection devices serve their purpose as conservation tools regarding these <b>species.</b> <b>Haddock</b> mortality was higher and inversely related to sh length. Their mortality could neither been shown to depend upon selection device nor shing intensity. There was, however, a considerable variation between replicates masking any such possible effects. It is concluded that the trawl passage, but not mesh and grid penetration is the ii primary cause of mortality. Injury analysis supports this suggestion. The mortality estimates were confounded by methodological problems. Potential sources of experimentally induced mortality were identi ed throughout the experiments and the methods subsequently improved. The confounding methodological effects are accounted for in a model describing haddock escape mortality...|$|E

Document to what extent discharges of alkylphenols in produced water cause estrogenic effects in fish from Tampen by measurements of alkylphenols in muscle and liver, and vitellogenin in plasma. Di- and polyaromatic hydrocarbons (NPD/PAH) have been analysed in muscle of cod and haddock caught in the North Sea at Ling Bank/Egersund Bank (reference), Tampen, Halten Bank and Barents Sea (reference), autumn 2005 and concentrations found to be below levels of quantification (LOQ) for fish sampled from all regions. Cod sampled at the Ling Bank/Egersund Bank in the Southern part of the North Sea had the same levels of PAH metabolites in bile as cod sampled from the Tampen region. Haddock demonstrated significantly higher levels of fluorescence for all three wavelength pairs measured, indicating a higher levels of 2 -, 3 -, 4 - and 5 -ring PAHs for haddock sampled in the Tampen region compared with haddock from the Ling Bank/Egersund Bank region.

30|$|Water {{temperature}} {{is a critical}} factor {{for the success of}} fish hatchery production, and it has significant implication on the growth performance of fish larvae (Boglione et al. 2013 b). Temperature can regulate fish metabolism, food intake and growth (Jobling 1994; Ma 2014), and the effects of temperature on fish growth have been well documented in the larvae of commercially important fish <b>species</b> including <b>haddock</b> Melanogrammus aeglefinus L. (Martell et al. 2005), nase Chondrostoma nasus L. (Keckeis et al. 2001), Australian snapper Pagrus auratus (Fielder et al. 2005), striped trumpeter Latris lineata (Choa et al. 2010), and yellowtail kingfish Seriola lalandi (Ma 2014). In golden pompano, the fast growth at high temperature may be attributed to the improved food ingestion and digestive function of fish larvae after 15 DPH as Ma et al. (2014 b) reported that the goblet cells and gastric glands appeared in the gut of golden pompano larvae after 15 DPH at 27 – 29  °C. The growth of fish larvae tended to be accelerated when fish were weaned from rotifers to Artemia nauplii. Similar to the Florida pompano Trachinotus carolinus (Riley et al. 2009), the length of mouth gape close to 1.05  mm should allow golden pompano larvae to ingest Artemia nauplii and other similar size of food particles by 12 DPH. Therefore, the significant difference in fish size between thermal treatments at 18 DPH may be also related to the use of high energy food from 9 DPH onwards.|$|R

It is suggested that fish stocks of the same species living in regions distinctly separated from each other are independent and apparently no covariation in year-class strength exists among them. Even in neighbouring regions no apparent covariation could be found. Not all the species living in the same region produce numerous broods in the same year. Indications were found that the total number of 0 -group fishes produced varied from year to year.

40|$|Since 1978 {{large numbers}} of harp seals (Phoca groenlandica) have invaded areas of North Norway in winter and spring.

Sampling of stomach contents for food analyses and of teeth for age determinations was carried out from harp seals taken as bycatch in Norwegian gill-net fisheries in 1986 and 1988. It appears that the seal herds comprised both immature and mature animals. The stomach analyses suggested that feeding was opportunistic, with a variety of fish (in particular the gadoid <b>species</b> cod, saithe, <b>haddock</b> and Norway pout, and the pelagic shoaling species herring and capelin) being taken as prey.

40|$|Understanding {{the role}} of marine mammals in {{specific}} ecosystems and their interactions with fisheries involves, inter alia, an understanding of their diet and dietary requirements. In this thesis, the foraging ecology of seven marine mammal species that regularly occur in Irish waters was investigated by reconstructing diet using hard parts from digestive tracts and scats. Of the species examined, two (striped and Atlantic white-sided dolphin) can be considered offshore species or species inhabiting neritic waters, while five others usually inhabit more coastal areas (white-beaked dolphin, harbour porpoise, harbour seal and grey seal); the last species studied was the bottlenose dolphin whose population structure is more complex, with coastal and offshore populations. A total of 13, 028 prey items from at least 81 different species (62 fish species, 14 cephalopods, four crustaceans, and a tunicate) were identified. 28 % of the fish species were identified using bones other than otoliths, highlighting the importance of using all identifiable structures to reconstruct diet. Individually, each species of marine mammal presented a high diversity of prey taxa, but the locally abundant Trisopterus spp. {{were found to be}} the most important prey item for all species, indicating that Trisopterus spp. is probably a key species in understanding {{the role of}} these predators in Irish waters. In the coastal marine mammals, other Gadiformes <b>species</b> (<b>haddock,</b> pollack, saithe, whiting) also contributed substantially to the diet; in contrast, in pelagic or less coastal marine mammals, prey was largely comprised of planktivorous fish, such as Atlantic mackerel, horse mackerel, blue whiting, and mesopelagic prey. Striped dolphins and Atlantic white-sided dolphins are offshore small cetaceans foraging in neritic waters. Differences between the diet of striped dolphins collected in drift nets targeting tuna and stranded on Irish coasts showed a complex foraging behaviour; the diet information shows that although this dolphin forages mainly in oceanic waters it may occasionally forage on the continental shelf, feeding on available prey. The Atlantic white-sided dolphin diet showed that this species prefers to feed over the continental edge, where planktivorous fish are abundant. Some resource partitioning was found in bottlenose dolphins in Irish waters consistent with previous genetic and stable isotope analysis studies. Bottlenose dolphins in Irish waters appears to be generalist feeders consuming more than 30 prey species, however most of the diet comprised a few locally abundant species, especially gadoid fish including haddock/pollack/saithe group and Trisopterus spp., but the contribution of Atlantic hake, conger eels and the pelagic planktivorous horse mackerel were also important. Stomach content information suggests that three different feeding behaviours might occur in bottlenose dolphin populations in Irish waters; firstly a coastal behaviour, with animals feeding on prey that mainly inhabit areas close to the coast; secondly an offshore behaviour where dolphins feed on offshore species such as squid or mesopelagic fish; and a third more complex behaviour that involves movements over the continental shelf and close to the shelf edge. The other three coastal marine mammal species (harbour porpoise, harbour seal and grey seal) were found to be feeding on similar prey and competition for food resources among these sympatric species might occur. Both species of seals were found to have a high overlap (more than 80 %) in their diet composition, but while grey seals feed on large fish (> 110 mm), harbour seals feed mostly on smaller fish (< 110 mm), suggesting some spatial segregation in foraging. Harbour porpoises and grey seals are potentially competing for the same food resource but some differences in prey species were found and some habitat partitioning might occur. Direct interaction (by catch) between dolphins and fisheries was detected in all species. Most of the prey found in the stomach contents from both stranded and by catch dolphins were smaller sizes than those targeted by commercial fisheries. In fact, the total annual food consumption of the species studied was found to be very small (225, 160 tonnes) in comparison to fishery landings for the same area (~ 2 million tonnes). However, marine mammal species might be indirectly interacting with fisheries, removing forage fish. Incorporating the dietary information obtained from the four coastal species, an ECOPATH food web model was established for the Irish Sea, based on data from 2004. Five trophic levels were found, with bottlenose dolphins and grey and harbour seals occurring at the highest trophic level. A comparison with a previous model based on 1973 data suggests that while the overall Irish Sea ecosystem appears to be “maturing”, some indices indicate that the 2004 fishery was less efficient and was targeting fish at higher trophic levels than in 1973, which is reflected in the mean trophic level of the catch. Depletion or substantial decrease of some of the Irish Sea fish stocks has resulted in a significant decline in landings in this area. The integration of diet information in mass-balance models to construct ecosystem food-webs will help to understand the trophic role of these apex predators within the ecosystem...|$|E
40|$|Fish {{exhibit a}} great {{variability}} in reproductive strategies. A particular mating system reported for some {{species of fish}} is the lek system. Studies on spawning behaviour of cod (Gadus, morhua) - a closely related <b>species</b> to <b>haddock</b> - {{have shown that the}} mating characteristics are consistent with lekking, meaning that cod are particularly vulnerable to disturbance by fishing on their spawning grounds. In this study the spawning behaviour of haddock, was examined and the prerequisites of lekking system were:'observed. Visual and acoustic displays ensured a clear area around a dominant male excluding less vigorous males and unripe females. Larger dominant males performed the solitary display for longer periods than smaller males, more during nights than days. Repeated female intrusions into the male's territory led to courtship and provided evidence that haddock mating is under female's control. Direct observations and DNA analysis demonstrated the existence of alternative male mating strategies. The ventral mount occurred generally outside the male territory. The acoustic repertoire of haddock, both during and outside spawning was described: sound unit structures and call duration were different and provided evidence of speci~s-specificsounds emitted by spawning males. The knocks emitted by each male during the solitary display had a constant waveform that differed from the knocks produced by the other individuals. Female and juvenile sounds were described for the first time. A simple mechanical model showed that a double pulsed sound waveform, could be obtained from two oscillators linked by a viscous-elastic spring, having opposite directions. A quadrupole motion of the haddock swimbladder was suggested. Detailed information about the haddock acoustic repertoire allowed us to detect for the first time haddock spawning grounds in the field (off Norway) by means of passive acoustic monitoring.

Proceedings of the Eighteenth Biennial Conference of the International Institute of Fisheries Economics and Trade, held July 11 - 15, 2016 at Aberdeen Exhibition and Conference Center (AECC), Aberdeen, Scotland, UK. To {{examine the}} impact of the Landing Obligation (LO) on the Irish fishing {{industry}} and explore possible mitigation strategies, we carried out two trials on commercial fishing vessels in 2015. One vessel targeted Nephrops, the other mixed demersal whitefish in Irish waters. The study was in two phases. In month one, the vessel operated normally, but under LO conditions, and all catches were recorded. In month two the skippers were challenged to reduce levels of unwanted catch as much as practically possible. They could choose from existing technical measures (e. g. modified gears) and/or adjust their fishing behaviour and tactics. Cod and haddock were the principal choke species for both vessels.   The Nephrops vessel could reduce cod catches and so mitigate the economic impact of the LO.  The mixed demersal whitefish vessel was unable to avoid the choke species or to minimise the economic impact of the LO through tactical measures or by changes in location or timing of fishing. Technical measures are, in any case, of little use in reducing catches of haddock, a key choke species in this fishery. It was concluded that reducing quota imbalance between whitefish <b>species</b> especially <b>haddock</b> and whiting might assist  the mixed demersal whitefish fisheries to remain commercially viable under full LO implementation, as well as to prevent more vessels joining the Nephrops fishery. An alternative fishery based quota management system which optimises quota allocations {{on the basis of the}} main species upon which vessels are reliant, would assist in this regard...|$|R

Results from multivariate statistical analysis confirmed that species compositions varied significantly at different sites and were related to environmental conditions, whereby sites of similar temperature, salinity and bottom depth harboured similar species assemblages. Generalized additive mixed modelling was used to model the relationship between species richness and environmental variables and confirmed that there was a significant negative relationship between species richness and bottom depth indicating that the offshore banks and the slope stations present favourable habitats for a large number of species. peer-reviewe...|$|R

The cruise was conducted in closed area II (CA-II) of the eastern portion of Georges Bank during 19 – 29 June 2000 (Fig. 1). The area has historically produced high landings of scallops but was closed in 1994 principally for groundfish recovery (Fogarty and Murawski, 1998). The southern portion of the area was reopened to scallop fishing from 15 June to 12 November 1999, and again from 15 June to 15 August 2000. While conducting our planned sampling, we observed scallop viscera (the noncalcareous remains from scallops that have been shucked by commercial fishermen at sea) in the stomachs of several fish species at some of these locations, namely little skate (Raja erinacea), winter skate (R. ocellata), red hake (Urophycis chuss), and longhorn sculpin (Myoxocephalus octodecemspinosus). We examined the stomach contents of a known scavenger, the longhorn sculpin, to evaluate and document the extent of this phenomenon. ...|$|R
40|$|Cod, haddock and whiting {{are among}} the most {{economically}} important species in the Scottish demersal fishery. Juvenile settlement, the transition from pelagic to demersal habitat, has been identified as an important milestone for these species, but there is insufficient knowledge and data about this life stage. It is believed that the period of settlement has an impact on recruitment success, as important density-dependent processes may take place, such as competition for suitable substrate, refuge or prey. Also, knowledge of settlement timing and duration is relevant to understanding population connectivity and thus to the development of successful conservation measures. Sampling was conducted between April and August 2004, June and September 2005 and June and July 2006 at an inshore site off the east coast of Scotland. Over 4000 0 - group cod, haddock and whiting were collected. Comprehensive morphometric and dietary analyses of the samples were carried out, followed by statistical analysis of the data. The results suggested clear differences in the patterns of settlement between the different <b>species.</b> Initially juvenile <b>haddock</b> favoured deeper, further offshore locations, while cod occupied shallower, inshore waters. Whiting settled much later in the season and over protracted period of time. Furthermore, cod showed an affinity for structured habitat, while haddock and whiting were found only over sand. The results also showed that the transition from the pelagic to the demersal habitat was associated with clear and progressive changes in the prey composition of the juvenile fish. The results also showed temporal, spatial and dietary niche segregation of settling juveniles, which is expected to reduce competition for resources and increase the potential for settlement success.

40|$|The {{threat of}} {{environmental}} mercury (Hg), particularly methylmercury (MeHg), {{exposure to the}} health of humans has been well documented. Thus, it is important to monitor exposure and body burden for public health protection. The first objective of this thesis was to characterize the risk of Hg exposure in two Canadian coastal communities: Grand Marian (n = 91) and St. Andrews/St. Stephen (n = 52), New Brunswick, Canada, using dietary questionnaires and hair analysis. Average Hg intakes and body burden were below the most conservative guidelines. We attributed these results to the low Hg concentrations found in the <b>species</b> commonly consumed: <b>haddock,</b> canned tuna, lobster and pollock (all below 0. 2 mg/kg). The analytical method employed to determine Hg in hair, cold vapor atomic absorption (CV-AAS), required a bundle of 100 - 150 hair strands and involved lengthy chemical digestion procedures which reduce throughput. Direct solid introduction techniques minimize these weaknesses. Our second and third objectives were to evaluate two such methods: (1) combustion, gold amalgamation, atomic absorption spectrometry (C-GA-AAS) and (2) laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) for measuring total Hg in single hair strands. Hair samples {{with a wide range of}} Hg exposure were obtained from communities. A 1 : 1 relationship was observed between C-GA-AAS and the established CV-AAS for analysis of 1 -cm hair segments. Additionally, the average relative standard deviation (RSD) of Hg between hair strands within an individual was 6. 5 +/- 2. 8 %, thus justifying the use of a single hair strand for biomonitoring. With a limit of quantification of 0. 10 ng of total Hg, a single hair strand with average weight of 0. 5 mg and Hg concentrations of 0. 2 mg/kg can be measured routinely. Using LA-ICP-MS, we showed that a single laser shot can sample hair material within 50 mum along a single hair strand which is equivalent to less than one day o...|$|R
40|$|In April 2000 a {{base line}} survey was {{conducted}} on the larval distribution of commercial fish species off the west, north and south coasts of Ireland. Ichthyoplankton samples and in situ CTD data were collected, whilst simultaneously capturing remote sensing images of chlorophyll and sea surface temperatures. The survey sampling area covered the Celtic Sea from the Irish south coast to 49 degree N, the western shelf including the Porcupine Bank and the northern shelf up to the Stanton Bank. The sample grid design was based on the international mackerel & horse mackerel egg survey with station spacings of 0. 5 degree latitude and 0. 5 degree longitude. Ichthyoplankton samples were collected with a Gulf III plankton sampler, which was deployed on oblique tows from the surface to within 5 metres of the bottom (200 m max). A self-logging CTD sensor (Promonitor) was attached to the Gulf and recorded depth, temperature and salinity profiles for each deployment. Results from the Promonitor CTD showed that strong temperature and salinity gradients were encountered during the survey. Lowest temperatures coincided with lowest salinity in the North Channel of the Irish Sea while highest salinities and temperatures were found to the south west of Ireland. Thermal fronts were found in the eastern Celtic Sea and on the north west coast of Ireland. The AVHRR images showed a progressive increase in surface temperatures in the Celtic Sea and west of Ireland. Highest surface chlorophyll concentrations were associated with cooler less saline water in the Irish Sea and the coastal areas around Ireland. In the western Celtic Sea surface chlorophyll concentrations increased as the survey progressed to form a phytoplankton bloom {{towards the end of the}} survey. Larvae of interest showed distinct distribution patterns, with some species being confined to particular areas or spawning grounds while others were spread over the whole survey area. The survey identified two important larval hotspots: Cod larvae were concentrated in the eastern Celtic Sea, where other gadoid <b>species</b> such as <b>haddock,</b> whiting, pollack and saithe were also found in high numbers. This area is associated with the Celtic Sea front and shows increased primary productivity, which could present a favourable environment for successful larval survival. Stations in the southwest of Ireland sustained high concentrations of hake, megrim and mackerel larvae. The waters with high numbers of these three species stretched from shallow inshore stations to deeper ones along the continental shelf and were characterised by high temperatures and salinities. SeaWIFS satellite images suggest the formation of a phytoplankton bloom within this larval hotspot, which would provide the necessary resources for successful larval growth.
