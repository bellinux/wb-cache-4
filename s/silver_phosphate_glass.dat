It is considered {{that the most}} significant initial effect of the radiation is to produce free electrons and positive holes in a track. The decay of the track from the initial condition is described in some detail, assuming {{that the rate of}} diffusion of electrons from the track is small compared to the rates of other processes, and that primary'' processes which form color centers can be considered independent of secondary'' processes which cause destruction of color centers. A method of calculation is described which gives the concentration of color centers formed at various doses.

40|$|Investigation of the {{transport}} phenomena in <b>silver</b> molybdenum <b>phosphate</b> <b>glasses</b> {{has revealed that}} the observed fast ionic transport is due to silver ions. The structure of these glasses, investigated using infrared spectra, shows that MoO 3 and P 2 O 5 are the glass formers, {{the role of the}} last one being more important as the MoO 3 content decreases. The densities of the glasses, measured using the displacement method show that the addition of Ag 2 O to the binary MoO 3 -P 2 O 5 system causes a constant increase in the density of the glasses. AC conductivity measurements of the glasses were conducted in open atmosphere from 5 Hz to 100 kHz by use of a HP 4142 impedance-meter in the temperature range of 303 - 423 K. The glasses exhibited high ion conductivities in the range of 10 - 4 to 10 - 1 Sm- 1 at room temperature. The conductivities of the glasses increase and the activation energies of the conduction process decrease with the Ag 2 O content. The total conductivity of the glasses was recorded using the two electrodes method. The investigated glasses have a very similar behavior in direct and alternative current, respectively, the activation energies being close.

Graphite lubricants containing three additives (<b>silver,</b> <b>phosphate</b> <b>glass,</b> and zinc orthophosphate) were evaluated from room temperature to 540 C. Two hard coats were also evaluated. The evaluation of these lubricants, using a burnishing method of application, shows a reasonable transfer of lubricant and wear protection for short duration testing except in the 200 C temperature range. The graphite lubricants containing silver and zinc orthophosphate additives were {{more effective than the}} phosphate glass material over the test conditions examined. Traction coefficients ranged from a low of 0. 07 to a high of 0. 6. By curve fitting the traction data, empirical equations for slope and maximum traction coefficient as a function of contact pressure (P), rolling speed (U), and temperature (T) can be developed for each lubricant. A solid lubricant traction model was incorporated into an advanced bearing analysis code (SHABERTH). For comparison purposes, preliminary heat generation calculations were made for both oil and solid lubricated bearing operation.

From the Raman spectrum, {{the structure of}} the glasses was analyzed. Conduction and relaxation mechanisms in these glasses were studied using impedance spectroscopy in a frequency range from 10 Â Hz to 13 Â MHz and a temperature range from 323 Â K to 623 Â K. The dependence of electrical data on frequency was analyzed in the framework of the Nyquist's plot and Jonscherâs power law. The semicircles observed in the plots indicate a double relaxation process. The studied materials exhibit a significant contribution of bulk and interfacial effect to electrical conduction and to non-Debye relaxation process. The dc conductivity (Ïdc) follows Arrhenius behavior with temperature. The ac and dc conductivities of the samples were found to increase with the increase in temperature. The conductivity variation for P 2 O 5 -Na 2 O-ZnO glasses doped with various concentrations of AgNO 3 was explained by the presence of ionic contribution. The dielectric characterizations include measurements involving the variation of the dielectric constant as well as the dielectric loss with frequency. The dielectric studies show low values for the dielectric constant and loss at high frequencies.

The decline of detector response with increase in the stopping power of the bombarding ion, and the non-linearity of the detector response are characteristic properties of 1 -hit detectors, and are most pronounced for the most sensitive detectors. Explicit information about the cross-sectional area of the sensitive target cannot be gained from measurement of the activation cross-section {{as a function of}} the stopping power of the incident ion, for there is no saturation cross-section for 1 -hit detectors.
