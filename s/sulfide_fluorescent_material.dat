40|$|In {{this paper}} we present an {{advanced}} upeonverter system concept {{to reduce the}} sub-bandgap losses of silicon solar cells. We {{address the issue of}} the narrow absorption range of common upconverter materials. This problem can be overcome by the combination of the upconverter with a broadly absorbing <b>fluorescent</b> <b>material,</b> which emits in the absorption range of the upconverter. However, possible <b>fluorescent</b> <b>materials</b> also absorb in the emission range of the upconverter. We therefore propose an advanced system setup, which avoids unwanted absorption by separating upconverter and <b>fluorescent</b> <b>material</b> with a selectively reflective photonic structure. The incorporation of the <b>fluorescent</b> <b>material</b> in a <b>fluorescent</b> concentrator allows for additional geometric concentration increasing the efficiency of the upconversion process. We estimate that a total system efficiency of up to 25 % could be possible with an Er based upconverting system and a silicon solar cell...|$|R

From the transmission curves, the parameters related to the photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) transmission (τPAR, 400 - 700 nm) and the ratio ζ (red/far red irradiance) were calculated. It was observed that ζ was higher for the <b>fluorescent</b> <b>material</b> than for the classical films and lower for the shading coloured film, but their PAR transmissions were lower. The effective photosynthetic transmission (η) and quantum transmission (E) were determined by weighting the spectral transmission curves with, respectively, the photosynthetic and quantum yield efficiencies of an average plant.

The selected pi-conjugated <b>fluorescent</b> <b>material</b> was a phenylene-ethynylene diimine with di-ether substituents (PH-DE-DI). A rapid disappearance of the fluorescence emission occurred when the material was exposed to solar light in ambient air. To understand this degradation, modifications to the chemical structure of thin films exposed to UV-visible irradiation were characterised using various techniques. HS-SPME-GC-MS experiments showed that sample irradiation induced the release of numerous volatile products in a relatively high abundance. IR spectroscopy coupled with derivatisation treatments allowed the identification of the photoproducts trapped in the irradiated thin films. To improve the understanding of the degradation mechanism of PH-DE-DI, the present paper also focused on the photo-ageing of phenylene-ethynylene materials: (i) without the end diimine function and the di-ether groups and (ii) the PH-DE-DI polymer. Based on the identification of several photoproducts, the primary pathways of photodegradation involving a chain radical oxidation process were discussed...|$|R
