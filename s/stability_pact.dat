2500|$|The Pact {{has been}} criticised {{by some as}} being insufficiently {{flexible}} and needing to be applied over the economic cycle rather than in any one year. They fear that by limiting governments' abilities to spend during economic slumps it may hamper growth. In contrast, other critics think that the Pact is too flexible; economist Antonio Martino writes: [...] "The fiscal constraints introduced with the new currency must be criticized {{not because they are}} undesirable—in my view they are a necessary component of a liberal order—but because they are ineffective. This is amply evidenced by the “creative accounting” gimmickry used by many countries to achieve the required deficit to GDP ratio of 3 percent, and by the immediate abandonment of fiscal prudence by some countries {{as soon as they were}} included in the euro club. Also, the <b>Stability</b> <b>Pact</b> has been watered down at the request of Germany and France." ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the decision by}} a government facing electoral uncertainty to implement structural reforms {{in the presence of}} fiscal restraints similar to the <b>Stability</b> and Growth <b>Pact.</b> To the extent that the reform package entails budgetary costs, the model shows that a fiscal pact erodes incentives to carry out structural reforms, sacrificing future growth for present <b>stability.</b> Although the <b>pact</b> effectively addresses the deficit bias resulting from electoral uncertainty, the induced reduction in reforms implies ambiguous welfare effects. We conclude that a "smart" (i. e., welfare-improving) pact should take into account the budgetary effects of structural reforms. Our conclusions are consistent with the actual principles guiding the implementation of the <b>Stability</b> and Growth <b>Pact.</b> ...|$|R

The latter would consist in achieving in each EU country a cyclically-adjusted net-of-public-investment balance. The benchmark for comparison is the classification adopted by Kopits and Symansky (1998) on "ideal fiscal rules". This classification has been used by Buti et al. (2003) in order to demonstrate the "ideal character" of the actual <b>Stability</b> and Growth <b>Pact</b> and thus legitimate only slight modifications to the Pact. I intend to show rather, that the "modified golden rule" is a better fiscal rule than the actual Pact. euro area, fiscal rule, golden rule, <b>Stability</b> and Growth <b>Pact...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of the <b>Stability</b> and Growth <b>Pact</b> is to secure sound fiscal policies, which have remained a national responsibility in Economic and Monetary Union. Ever since it first took effect, the <b>Stability</b> and Growth <b>Pact</b> had been subject to a reform debate, ultimately leading to its redesign in 2005. The debate intensified in 2002, when several European countries suffered from growing budgetary problems, and culminated in November 2003, when the Ecofin Council decided not to act upon European Commission recommendations {{to move to the}} next steps of the excessive deficit procedure for France and Germany and instead adopted conclusions putting the procedures in abeyance subject to certain undertakings by the countries concerned. Consequently, the Commission brought an action before the European Court of Justice. The conflict surrounding the correct procedure in line with the provisions of the Treaty establishing the European Community (the Treaty) and the <b>Stability</b> and Growth <b>Pact,</b> i. e. the correct interpretation and implementation of the procedural and factual steps laid down therein, brought to light differences of opinion between the EU Member States and the European Commission as well as among the Member States themselves. Against this background, the European Commission presented concrete proposals to reform the <b>Stability</b> and Growth <b>Pact</b> in the fall of 2004. At an extraordinary Ecofin meeting on March 20, 2005, the EU finance ministers reached a compromise on the reform of the <b>Stability</b> and Growth <b>Pact.</b> The reform includes measures applicable to both the preventive and the corrective arms of the <b>Stability</b> and Growth <b>Pact.</b> The top priority of the reform was to enhance Member States' national ownership of the fiscal framework and hence to safeguard the sustainability of public finances in the Economic and Monetary Union in the long run. Experience to date does not allow for a final assessment, but {{from the vantage point of}} monetary policy, certain weaknesses remain that had already been pointed out during the reform debate. fiscal policy, fiscal rules, <b>stability</b> and growth <b>pact</b> reform, european monetary union. ...|$|R

I consider the budget of Italian municipalities and exploit specific changes in the Domestic <b>Stability</b> <b>Pact’s</b> rules, to perform a difference-in-discontinuities analysis. The results show that not all rules are equally effective: imposing a cap on the total amount of consumption and investment is not as binding as two caps, one specific for consumption and a different one for investment spending. More specifically, the consumption variation is triggered by changes in the level of wages and services spending, while investment relies on infrastructure movements. In addition, there is evidence that when an increase in investment is achieved, there is also a higher budget deficit level...|$|R

The scheme exploits countries' incentives to minimize their costs, is transparent and flexible in accommodating idiosyncratic shocks and allows for adjustments in case of Europe-wide recessions. In addition, it need not treat all countries identically and can be designed to penalize countries with higher debt to GDP ratios. Finally, the scheme rewards countries for reducing their deficit below the initial allowance, lending credibility to the <b>Stability</b> <b>Pact's</b> goal of a balanced budget in the medium run...|$|R
