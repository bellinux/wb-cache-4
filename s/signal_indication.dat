50|$|ACSES also enforces a {{positive}} stop at signals displaying an absolute Stop indication. The on-board database allows {{the train to}} keep track of when it is approaching an absolute signal and then determine if {{a positive}} stop is required depending on cab <b>signal</b> <b>indication</b> and information provided via a local data radio. The system will stop the train in a Positive Stop Zone, extending up to 1000 feet from the absolute stop signal. To pass the stop signal or otherwise move the train in absence of a more favorable <b>signal</b> <b>indication</b> a Stop Release button must be engaged by the engineer before the brakes can be released.|$|E
5000|$|It {{is illegal}} to proceed past an {{alternating}} flashing red (wig-wag) signal at railroad crossings, per the motor vehicle codes of some jurisdictions. However, this same <b>signal</b> <b>indication</b> has a different meaning (stop and proceed when clear) at HAWK beacons.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{motor vehicle}} codes require that motorists stop at dark signal indications, which are {{typically}} indicative of an abnormality {{in the normal}} operation of the signal, such as a power failure. However, the dark <b>signal</b> <b>indication</b> is a normal display at HAWK beacons, where it designates the right-of-way for vehicular traffic.|$|E

5000|$|At a signalized crossing, a {{pedestrian}} {{is subject to}} the applicable pedestrian traffic signal or, if no pedestrian signal is displayed, the <b>signal</b> <b>indications</b> for the parallel vehicular movement. A pedestrian signal permits {{a pedestrian}} to begin crossing a street during the [...] "Walk" [...] display; the pedestrian is usually considered to be [...] "jaywalking" [...] only if he entered the crosswalk at some other time. The meanings of pedestrian <b>signal</b> <b>indications</b> are summarized in Section 4E.02 of the national Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices.|$|R
50|$|Signals exist {{primarily}} to pass {{instructions and information}} to drivers of passing trains. The driver interprets the <b>signal's</b> <b>indication</b> and acts accordingly. The most important indication is 'danger', which means 'stop'. Not every signal {{is equipped with a}} 'danger' aspect.|$|R
50|$|ABS system {{electronics}} {{are also}} able to detect breaks in the rail or improperly lined track switches (if the switch is established in the circuit), which result in an open circuit. These will also change the <b>signal</b> <b>indication,</b> preventing any trains from entering the block (if the signal system prevents it), and risking running through a switch, or a derailment.|$|E
5000|$|On June 10, 2013, {{the final}} report TSB report was issued. [...] The report {{confirmed}} that the train was travelling {{more than four times}} the authorized speed while changing from track 2 to track 3. It concluded that the crew misinterpreted the <b>signal</b> <b>indication</b> when approaching the crossover and proceed at a speed appropriate for a train remaining on track 2. It also indicated that a maintenance crew was working on track 2 beyond the crossover, and that the attention of the locomotive crew may have been focused on the safety of this maintenance crew, diverting their attention from the <b>signal</b> <b>indication.</b> Furthermore, the previous signal which gave advance warning of the speed restriction was passed before a stop at Aldershot Station, and the locomotive crew may have forgotten about its indication while stopped for several minutes. It also concludes that since Via trains rarely change tracks at this crossover, the crew may have had a strong expectation that they would be remaining on track 2.|$|E
50|$|The Conemaugh Line {{is notable}} {{for being the}} {{recipient}} of {{a variation of the}} PRR's cab signal system in 1940, which eliminated the wayside signals between interlockings from Conpit Junction to Kiski Junction, requiring operation of trains by cab <b>signal</b> <b>indication</b> only. This system (whose visual NORAC Rule 562), modified by Conrail to operate bidirectionally, continues to be used by Norfolk Southern on this part of the Conemaugh Line; the section from Kiski to Pittsburgh also uses bidirectional signaling, however this section uses wayside signals but is NOT cab-signal energized. The entire line is remotely dispatched by Traffic Control System (TCS).|$|E
50|$|As {{railroad}} companies eventually {{began to}} standardize their rule books via industry-wide committees, {{the implementation of}} signal systems between railroads became, if not standardized, at least more similar. Different legacy systems still in use, however, mean that some <b>signal</b> <b>indications</b> can be shown in several different ways.|$|R
5000|$|In the UK and Australia {{the term}} applied to rail track where the {{signalling}} {{system does not}} pass the <b>signal</b> <b>indications</b> nor track occupancy back to a signal box. As such the position of trains is not visible to signallers, and so the track is [...] "dark".|$|R
40|$|Light-emitting diode (LED) traffic <b>signal</b> <b>indications</b> {{have become}} {{increasingly}} popular in the United States in the last 10 years. The improved technology and significant energy savings give LEDs an advantage over traditional incandescent traffic <b>signal</b> <b>indications.</b> In Minnesota as well, the use of LED indications is on the rise, primarily for red and green indications. Many jurisdictions are requiring LED indications in all new signal designs. The Minnesota Department of Transportation (Mn/DOT) received a complaint from a color-blind person about {{a change in the}} appearance of traffic signals over the last few years. Specifically, green LED traffic <b>signal</b> <b>indications</b> in Washington County were mentioned. According to the complaint, in direct sunlight, the green indication appeared to be on when it was not, especially near the spring and fall equinox. Mn/DOT contacted Washington County to discuss the issue. Washington County has been upgrading to LED <b>signal</b> <b>indications</b> since 1998. The county currently requires all new signal installations to be LED. In 2002, Mn/DOT and Washington County conducted a preliminary investigation, which indicated that {{the most common type of}} green LED in the county has a clear lens. Although it is not green in color, the light reflection of the unlit green LED could appear brighter than either the lit red or amber indication under direct sunlight. For a person with a color vision deficiency, brightness—not color—is the most important cue. Figure 1 shows the appearance of signals under direct sunlight and without color information. In both cases, the red (top) indication is on. However, this is difficult to discern without color information. To further investigate the issue, Washington County installed several different LED signal head designs on Valley Creek Road. To understand the problem and better serve the general traveling public...|$|R
50|$|Bi-directional ABS {{was popular}} on lower density single track lines that {{nevertheless}} needed an upgrade from older train order or manual block systems. Bi-directional ABS {{was placed in}} service with the same passing siding infrastructure that operated under the older plain train order system. Opposing trains would still need to clear the main track based on their superiority or instructions, however, unlike under the older system, trains moving {{in the same direction}} could follow one another based on <b>signal</b> <b>indication.</b> This eliminated the need for some of the more cumbersome flagging procedures to protect the rear of trains working under the timetable and train order system.|$|E
50|$|There {{are simple}} yellow light shunt signals on signal posts which authorize {{movements}} {{to the next}} obstruction (vehicle) or signal. An accident occurred at Hines Hill in 1996 where a train entered the mainline from the East at high speed on a slow speed shunt <b>signal</b> <b>indication</b> and due to the driver not maintaining control of the train it collided with an Eastbound Westrail (see Hines Hill train collision) freight train after it had passed Departure Signal at Danger. The driver of the National Rail train had not reduced the speed of his train and the train controller unusually called the slow speed shunt signal, not meant for mainline operations.|$|E
50|$|This type of circuit detects {{the absence}} of trains, both for setting the <b>signal</b> <b>indication</b> and for {{providing}} various interlocking functions—for example, preventing points from being moved while a train is approaching them. Electrical circuits also prove that points are locked in the appropriate position before the signal protecting that route can be cleared. UK trains and staff working in track circuit block areas carry Track Circuit Operating Clips (TCOC) so that, {{in the event of}} something fouling an adjacent running-line, the track circuit can be short-circuited. This places the signal protecting that line to 'danger' to stop an approaching train before the signaller can be alerted.|$|E

5000|$|... "This {{accident}} {{was caused by}} failure of Engineman Wescott of train № 33 to be governed by automatic and interlocking <b>signal</b> <b>indications,</b> which resulted in train № 33 taking the diverging route at {{a high rate of}} speed and being derailed due to the outer rail of the curve giving way." ...|$|R
5000|$|Signals {{such as the}} 3M High Visibility Signal and McCain Programmable Visibility signal utilize light-diffusing optics and a Fresnel lens {{to create}} the <b>signal</b> <b>indication.</b> The light from a 150 W PAR46 {{sealed-beam}} lamp in these [...] "programmable visibility" [...] signals passes {{through a set of}} two glass lenses {{at the back of the}} signal. The first lens, a frosted glass diffusing lens, diffuses the light into a uniform ball of light around five inches in diameter. The light then passes through a nearly identical lens known as an optical limiter (3M's definition of the lens itself), also known as a [...] "programming lens", also five inches in diameter.|$|E
50|$|Additional BCMs (data radios) {{located at}} {{interlockings}} transmit {{information relating to}} absolute Stop signal indications and any speed restrictions pertaining to the train's route through said interlocking. Speed information acquired in this fashion will be displayed on the ACSES speed readout to supplement any speed {{information provided by the}} cab signaling system. After a positive stop the data radios will also transmit information releasing the train from the stop when track conditions permit. Such information about the status of the track occupancy, switch position, <b>signal</b> <b>indication,</b> {{and a host of other}} vital inputs—is accumulated by wayside encoders, such as a Safetran VIU-ACSES (see photo to the right), before being sent to the BCMs for transmission to locomotives.|$|E
5000|$|... 1915 - Rockledge, Tennessee - Relocation of a Western Union {{telegraph}} line from old alignment to new alignment causes a false clear <b>signal</b> <b>indication</b> when the Western Union wire {{comes in contact}} with the signal wire for the automatic block signal {{at the south end of}} the siding at Rockledge. A southbound freight train departed Rockledge on the false clear indication and collided with a northbound passenger train that had entered the block at Tantallon on a proper clear indication two minutes before the freight train departed Rockledge. A contributing factor was that the tower operator at Rockledge only controlled the signals, the track switches being operated by the train crews themselves.|$|E
30|$|Events include {{hardware}} interrupts such as channel up <b>signals,</b> <b>indication</b> {{of reception}} of a valid preamble or {{end of a}} valid frame, expiration of timers, and signals conveyed from the higher layers such as the enqueuing of a new packet. As {{in the case of}} actions, the list of supported events is a-priori provided by the hardware design.|$|R
50|$|A {{controllable}} balise {{is connected}} to a Lineside Electronics Unit (LEU), which transmits dynamic data to the train, such as <b>signal</b> <b>indications.</b> Balises forming part of an ETCS Level 1 signalling system employ this capability. The LEU integrates with the conventional (national) signal system either by connecting to the lineside railway signal or to the signalling control tower.|$|R
50|$|Miscellaneous - These signals include Parity/Verify error <b>signal,</b> mode <b>indication</b> {{and stage}} reference.|$|R
50|$|In Canada, fully {{signaled}} lines use CTC, where <b>signal</b> <b>indication</b> is {{the authority}} for movement. This system is supervised by a Rail Traffic Controller (RTC) {{who is in}} constant communication with the trains and engines on his territory. The RTC {{has the ability to}} line routes and give permissive signal requests to the system in the field from a central location. The RTC can also issue special permissions to trains via radio. In order to pass signals set at stop (Rule 564), reverse direction within a block (Rule 577) or enter the main line at a manual switch not equipped with a signal (Rule 568), the train crew must copy the RTC's instructions and repeat them back correctly before being allowed to proceed.|$|E
50|$|Cab {{signaling}} Systems or CSS (also {{known as}} Automatic Cab Signaling/Automatic Speed Control, or ACS), {{is often used}} as an overlay for ABS, Rule 251 and CTC. This system provides train crews with information about the next <b>signal</b> <b>indication,</b> even if the signal mast is not visible. Automatic Train Stop, or ATS, systems provide wayside inductors that, when activated, alert the engineer that the train has passed a signal other than Clear and if the signal is not acknowledged the train's brakes will be applied. Automatic Train Control, or ATC, adds in-cab enforcement to these and will apply the brakes if a dangerous situation arises, such as when the next signal is displaying a stop indication but the engineer has not begun slowing the train. Some form of ATS or ATC is required on all U.S. rail lines that operate at 80mph or more.|$|E
5000|$|The {{most common}} use {{case for the}} ATS system was to alert the {{railroad}} engineer of an impending hazard and if the alert was not acknowledged, stop the train {{by means of a}} full service application of the brakes. When attached to signals the shoe would be energized when the signal was displaying a [...] "Clear" [...] indication. Any other <b>signal</b> <b>indication</b> would de-energize the shoe and trigger an alarm in the cab. If the engineer did not cancel the alarm within 5-8 seconds a penalty brake application would be initiated and could not be reset until the train came to a complete stop. Unlike mechanical train stops or other train stop systems, IIATS was not generally used to automatically stop a train if it passed a stop signal and in practice could not be used for this purpose as the shoes were placed only {{a few feet from the}} signal they protected and would not present sufficient braking distance for the train to stop.|$|E
50|$|A coded {{track circuit}} based system is {{essentially}} an inductive system that uses the running rails as information transmitter. The coded track circuits serve a dual purpose: to perform the train detection and rail continuity detection functions of a standard track circuit, and to continuously transmit <b>signal</b> <b>indications</b> to the train. The coded track circuit systems {{eliminate the need for}} specialized beacons.|$|R
50|$|The Eurobalise is {{a passive}} or active antenna device mounted on rail sleepers. Mostly it transmits {{information}} to the driving vehicle. It can be arranged in groups to transfer information. There are Fixed and Transparent Data Balises. Transparent Data Balises are sending changing information from LEU to the trains, e.g. <b>signal</b> <b>indications.</b> Fixed Balises are programmed for a special information like gradients and speed restrictions.|$|R
50|$|On {{the main}} south line from Sydney, Single Light Colour Light signals are now {{exclusively}} used from Spring Creek bridge (south of Galong) to Albury on the Victorian border. This forms a buffer zone between the areas giving conflicting <b>signal</b> <b>indications.</b> Gradually the remaining Upper Quadrant signals (and Double Light Colour Light signals at Binalong) are {{being replaced by}} Single Light Colour Light signals.|$|R
