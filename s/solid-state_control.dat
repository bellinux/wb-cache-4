50|$|Beginning in {{the late}} 1940s and {{continuing}} into the 1980s surplus SHORAN systems had become widely used to provide precision navigation in {{oil and gas exploration}} industry. Companies like pioneer Offshore Navigation, Inc., Navigation Management, Coastal Surveys (based in Singapore) and Western Geophysical deployed SHORAN receivers to navigate seismic survey vessels and position drilling rigs around the world. The technology was key to the successful development of the offshore oil & gas industry in the postwar era. Truck-portable SHORAN transponders and up to 90 ft antennas were set up within a few feet of geodesic survey markers near the coast. SHORAN chains consisting of three or four shore stations were used to provide highly accurate navigation across large exploration tracts and as much as 200 mi offshore.

Flexible AC Transmission System (FACTS) devices {{play a vital role}} in improving the static as well as dynamic performance of the power systems. FACTS devices are based on <b>solid-state</b> <b>control</b> and so the control actions at far higher speed is possible. However the location and rating of the FACTS devices play a major role in deciding the extent to which the objective of improving the system performance is achieved in a cost effective manner. In this work an objective function comprising of cost, line loadings and load voltage deviations is proposed to tap maximum benefits out of their installation and the weights assigned to them decide their relative importance. FACTS devices such as Thyristor Controlled Series Compensator (TCSC) and Static VAR Compensator (SVC) are considered. The optimization is carried out considering four parameters namely the number of FACTS device, location, type and rating of the device.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the analysis, design and test of {{three-phase}} high efficiency electrical motors, with particular reference to motors with a rotor winding. At first, the background and the motivations of this work are described. The bibliography on the subjects is deeply examined and a selection of the most relevant papers {{can be found in}} the reference. In this scenario, the main objective of this thesis are illustrated. The Line-Start (LS) Synchronous Machine (SyM) design is a subject under investigation since the beginning of the last century, when solid state power converters was not available to drive SyMs. The LS SyM diffusion was limited by the intrinsic difficulties in its design and by the availability of the cheaper and more robust Induction Machine (IM). The working principle of IM and LS SyM are briefly described, as well as the state of the art of the techniques of analysis. Recently, there is a renewed interest on LS SyMs due to the new efficiency requirements and fast analysis techniques are required for the LS SyM design. A Finite-Element (FE) aided analytical model is developed to simulate the LS SyM dynamic. The aim is to develop a model that gives reliable solutions with limited computational efforts compared with other analysis techniques. With this procedure, the LS SyM rotor parameters can be quickly calibrated to fulfill the dynamic load requirements. An innovative analysis technique of LS SyM steady state condition is described. Such an analysis is carried out in the same reference frame used for classical SyMs. It is shown that the analysis can be used to optimize some machine parameters. The issues in LS SyM manufacturing are introduced, with particular reference to the die casting process. The possibility to apply the recent improvements in the SRM design to LS SyM is discussed from the manufacturing point of view. Stochastic optimization has been adopted for the design of electrical motors to reduce the torque ripple, increase the average torque and reduce the losses. The LS SyM torque ripple reduction, achieving at the same time a high average torque, is an important issue even though this topic is not treated extensively in the literature for LS SyM. For this reason, a stochastic optimization is considered in this thesis for the design of a new LS SyM lamination. The analysis is applied on a small size, 2 -pole, three-phase LS SyM as this category is still not found in the motor market. The optimization is carried out considering the necessity to achieve a robust design, suitable for the industrial production, as such a LS SyM must be competitive with the workhorse of electrical motors, the IM. One of the most promising design is prototyped. Its performance are compared with the corresponding IM. To demonstrate the feasibility in adopting LS SyM in the large-scale production, an innovative LS SyM design is proposed. The main aim is to use the same lamination for motors of different number of poles so as to reduce the manufacturing cost. A tradeoff between contrasting aspects is necessary in the design step. The performance achievable by these rotor structures are quantified. An analytical model that describes the mutual interaction between coupled electrical circuits in machines with complex rotor structure is developed. Such a model is useful to analyze the parasitic torques in the torque characteristic of motors with rotor cage such as IM and LS SyM. The literature reveals that this topic has been discussed extensively for IM. As regards LS SyM, there is a lack of theoretical studies regarding harmonic phenomena due to the complex machine structure. This part of the thesis aims to fill this gap. The high and unstable cost of rare-earth PMs, together with the advances in <b>solid-state</b> <b>control</b> technology, leads designers to reconsider IM for variable speed drive (VSD) applications. To the aim of making the IM suitable for the full-speed sensorless control, a particular cage design is considered. An intentionally created saliency is introduced in the rotor so as to allow the rotor position to be estimated by means of a high frequency (HF) injected signal in the stator winding also at zero-speed. Different experimental tests are carried out on IMs with asymmetrical rotor cage to validate the analysis techniques and quantify the achievable performance. As far as the HF signal injection sensorless technique is concerned, the cross-saturation differential inductance of SyMs represents an issue. It causes a rotor position estimation error, reducing the region in which such technique is effective. The proper-ties of the cross-saturation inductance are deeply discussed. It is originally shown that the cross-saturation inductance depends from certain machine parameters. With such an analysis, a designer can consider the effect of the cross-saturation inductance in any model-based control algorithm. A rotor winding is added in Surface-mounted permanent-magnet machine (SPM) to create a HF anisotropy that is useful to detect the rotor position by means of a HF signal injection. Such a configuration is called ”ringed-pole”. In literature, this technique has been used on small-size machines. In certain configuration, the presence of the additional rotor winding causes significant rotor losses. This part of the thesis studies the rotor losses in ringed pole machines by means of FE analysis and analytical models. The aim is to investigate if the ringed-pole technique can be adopted also for large machines from the point of view of additional losses. With few exceptions, the work described in this thesis is always supported by means of experimental measurements. Dedicated experiments has been designed. Their results are compared with those achieved with analytical models or FE analysis...|$|E

40|$|The multicycle CO capture {{performance}} of CaO derived from natural limestone and dolomite {{has been investigated}} by means of thermogravimetry under realistic Calcium-Looping conditions, which necessarily involve high CO concentration and high temperatures in the calcination stage and fast transitions between the carbonation and calcination stages. Natural dolomite allows reducing the calcination temperature as compared to limestone while high calcination efficiency is maintained. This could help reducing the energy penalty of the CaL process thus further enhancing the industrial competitiveness for the integration of this technology into fossil fuel power plants. Importantly, the CO capture capacity of the sorbents is critically affected by the solids residence time in the carbonation and calcination stages within the feasible range in practice.

40|$|The Calcium Looping (CaL) process, {{based on}} the cyclic carbonation/calcination of CaO, has emerged {{in the last years}} as a {{potentially}} low cost technique for CO 2 capture at reduced energy penalty. In the present work, natural limestone and dolomite have been pretreated with diluted acetic acid to obtain Ca and Ca-Mg mixed acetates, whose CO 2 capture performance has been tested at CaL conditions that necessarily imply sorbent regeneration under high CO 2 partial pressure. The CaL multicycle capture performance of these sorbents has been compared with that of CaO directly derived from limestone and dolomite calcination. Results show that acetic acid pretreatment of limestone does not lead to an improvement of its capture capacity, although it allows for a higher calcination efficiency to regenerate CaO at reduced temperatures (∼ 900 °C) as compared to natural limestone (>∼ 930 °C). On the other hand, if a recarbonation stage is introduced before calcination to reactivate the sorbent, a significantly higher residual capture capacity is obtained for the Ca-Mg mixed acetate derived from dolomite as compared to either natural dolomite or limestone. The main reason for this behavior is the enhancement of carbonation in the <b>solid-state</b> diffusion <b>controlled</b> phase.
