There, Grímnir says, Thor sits as judge at the immense cosmological world tree, Yggdrasil.|$|E

5|$|At least 802 prisoners {{attempted}} {{to escape from}} the Auschwitz camps, mostly Polish or Soviet prisoners fleeing from work sites outside the camp. 144 were successful. The fates of 331 of the escapees are unknown. A common punishment for escape attempts was death by starvation; the families of successful escapees were sometimes arrested and interned in Auschwitz and prominently displayed to deter others. If someone did manage to escape, the SS picked ten people at random from the prisoner's block and <b>starved</b> them to death.|$|E
5|$|Beese {{introduced}} Winehouse to his boss, Nick Gatfield, and the Island head {{shared his}} enthusiasm in signing the young artist. Winehouse was signed to Island, as rival interest in Winehouse {{had started to}} build to include representatives of EMI and Virgin starting to make moves. Beese told HitQuarters that he felt the reason behind the excitement, over an artist who was an atypical pop star for the time, was due to a backlash against reality TV music shows, which included audiences <b>starved</b> for fresh, genuine young talent.|$|E

In 28/29, Nero was charged by the Senate with homosexuality for which he was exiled to the island of Ponza. Germanicus' son Drusus was imprisoned within the dungeon under the Imperial palace on the Palatine Hill, where he <b>starved</b> to death not long after. Nero died in exile in 33.|$|E
5|$|During the {{war between}} June 1941 and January 1942, the Nazis killed an {{estimated}} 2.8 million Soviet prisoners of war.

5|$|Enraged upon {{learning}} the truth, Tiberius soon ordered more killings. Livilla committed suicide or was <b>starved</b> {{to death by}} her mother Antonia Minor. The remaining children of Sejanus, Capito Aelianus and Junilla, were executed in December of that year. According to ancient historians, {{because there was no}} precedent for the capital punishment of a virgin, Junilla was raped first, with the rope around her neck. Their bodies were thrown down the Gemonian stairs. At the beginning of the following year, damnatio memoriae was also passed on Livilla.|$|E
50|$|A <b>starving</b> {{artist is}} an artist who sacrifices {{material}} well-being in order to focus on their artwork.

5|$|Evidence {{suggests}} the jet stream {{was at least}} {{partly responsible for the}} widespread drought conditions during the 1930s Dust Bowl in the Midwest United States. Normally, the jet stream flows east over the Gulf of Mexico and turns northward pulling up moisture and dumping rain onto the Great Plains. During the Dust Bowl, the jet stream weakened and changed course traveling farther south than normal. This <b>starved</b> the Great Plains and other areas of the Midwest of rainfall, causing extraordinary drought conditions.|$|E
5|$|Hays {{made the}} {{construction}} of the mainline his priority, failing to develop feeder lines. CNoR and CPR joined forces to gain control of the prairie traffic. The competition among the three railroads led to Canada's ending up with three transcontinental railways instead of one. This was to result in the GTP's being <b>starved</b> of traffic; even though it was arguably the best of the three, it ultimately failed to attract enough freight to make it profitable.|$|E

5|$|In addition, {{the huge}} numbers of {{newcomers}} were driving Native Americans out of their traditional hunting, fishing and food-gathering areas. To protect their homes and livelihood, some Native Americans responded by attacking the miners. This provoked counter-attacks on native villages. The Native Americans, out-gunned, were often slaughtered. Those who escaped massacres were many times unable to survive without access to their food-gathering areas, and they <b>starved</b> to death. Novelist and poet Joaquin Miller vividly captured one such attack in his semi-autobiographical work, Life Amongst the Modocs.|$|E

5|$|Pausanias {{returned}} to Byzantium {{as a private}} citizen in 477 BC, and took command of the city until he was expelled by the Athenians.

The timescale is unclear, but Pausanias may have remained in possession of Byzantium until 470 BC.|$|E

5000|$|To besiege the city, Henry {{decided to}} set up four {{fortified}} camps and barricaded the River Seine with iron chains, completely surrounding the city, with the English intending to <b>starve</b> out the defenders. The Duke of Burgundy, John the Fearless, had captured Paris but did not make an attempt to save Rouen and advised citizens to look after themselves. By December, the inhabitants were eating cats, dogs, horseflesh, and even mice. The streets were filled with <b>starving</b> citizens. The city expelled more than 12,000 of the poor to save food. Henry would not allow the people to leave the siege line, and so the <b>starving,</b> expelled people of Rouen were forced {{to live in the}} ditch dug near the city wall for its protection. Even the English felt sorry for the <b>starving</b> people. On Christmas Day 1418, King Henry allowed two priests to give food to the <b>starving</b> people, but the day soon ended and the people went back to dying miserably in the ditch.|$|R

5|$|Suffering a {{wound on}} the Borodino {{battlefield}} was effectively a death sentence, as French forces did not possess enough {{food for the}} healthy, much less the sick; consequently, equal numbers of wounded soldiers <b>starved</b> to death, died of their injuries, or perished through neglect. The casualties were for a single day of battle, while the Russian figures are for the 5th and the 7th, combined. Using the same accounting method for both armies brings the actual French Army casualty count to 34,000–35,000.|$|E
5|$|Ten {{years later}} in 1963, Srintil (Prisia Nasution) and Rasus (Nyoman Oka Antara) are fast friends. Rasus also has romantic {{feelings}} for her. With the hamlet <b>starved</b> and in a depression since the loss of its ronggeng, Sakarya receives a vision that Srintil will become a great ronggeng, capable of saving the hamlet from starvation. He then convinces Srintil to become a ronggeng. She then tries to proves herself to Kartareja (Slamet Rahardjo), the hamlet's ronggeng caretaker and his wife (Dewi Irawan) by dancing at the grave of Ki Secamenggala, the hamlet's founder. Her attempt is only successful after Rasus gave her the ronggeng amulet belonged to the late ronggeng of Dukuh Paruk. Seeing this amulet, Kartareja then announces that Srintil has been chosen by the founder's spirit. Meanwhile, Indonesian Communist Party member Bakar (Lukman Sardi) arrived in the hamlet and convincing local farmers to join the party, saying that the Communist party {{are the only ones}} who can help save the wong cilik (underclass) of Dukuh Paruk and their <b>starved</b> hamlet.|$|E
50|$|Quinn's {{conclusions}} {{on population}} also suggest the controversial notion that sustained food aid to <b>starving</b> nations is merely delaying and dramatically worsening massive starvation crises, rather than resolving such crises, as is commonly assumed. Quinn claims that reconnecting {{people to the}} food made available through their local habitats is a proven way to avoid famines and accompanying starvation. Some have interpreted this to mean that Quinn is resolving to let <b>starving</b> people in impoverished nations continue <b>starving,</b> which he has repeatedly refuted.|$|R
