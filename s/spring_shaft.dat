40|$|In a {{torsion spring}} the spring {{action is a}} result of the {{relationships}} between the torque applied in twisting the spring, the angle through which the torsion spring twists, and the modulus of elasticity of the spring material in shear. Torsion springs employed industrially have been strips, rods, or bars, generally termed shafts, capabable of being flexed by twisting their axes. They rely on the variations in shearing forces to furnish an internal restoring torque. In the torsion springs herein the restoring torque is external and therefore independent of the shearing modulus of elasticity of the torsion <b>spring</b> <b>shaft.</b> Also provided herein is a variable stiffness torsion spring. This torsion spring can be so adjusted as to have a given spring constant. Such variable stiffness torsion springs are extremely useful in gimballed payloads such as sensors, telescopes, and electronic devices on such platforms as a space shuttle or a space station...|$|E

It is 259mm long and undecorated, with a simple shaft with a larger end, which has a single, rather oval, hole 25-30 mm across.

50|$|BRUTEs were a wheeled platform, {{generally}} with mesh {{around three}} {{sides of the}} body, the fourth side being open with canvas (or later plastic) straps for restraint of the load. The front included a panel for notes to be chalked to help sort traffic. A few BRUTEs had just the front, for carrying bulky loads {{too big for the}} cage, or two hinged ramps (no sides) to load or unload BRUTEs into railway vans. Each BRUTE had two fixed wheels at the rear and two swivelling caster wheels at the front, with polyurethane tyres and taper bearings. Coupling were at front and rear, the front being a pin, the rear a hinged loop on a <b>sprung</b> <b>shaft.</b> A lever on the front operated brakes on the rear wheels and lifted the coupling pin.|$|R

40|$|AbstractTorsion bar springs are {{dynamically}} loaded {{machine elements}} which can break due to fatigue. High strength fine-grain steel, grade VCN is normally used for <b>springs</b> or <b>shafts.</b> <b>Springs</b> {{are used as}} shock absorbers in caterpillar machines, where the diameters and lengths of the springs are limited. Springs should meet the requirements regarding spring constant (applied torque vs. twist angle), twist angle magnitude, and overcome the prescribed fatigue lifetime (number of fatigue cycles to failure). Using twist angle, {{it is possible to}} increase the elastic-plastic presetting of a torsion bar. A spring made as a torsion bar may exhibit different fatigue behaviour regarding to different elastic-plastic presetting torques. Experimentally obtained results show that fatigue lifetime strongly depends on the ratio between the preset elastic-plastic torque and the applied fatigue loading range. A model for fatigue lifetime and shear stress level is proposed in spite of relative small number of tested specimens...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. 50 CrV 4 {{spring steel}} is a tough, shock resisting, shallow {{hardening}} chromium vanadium steel having high fatigue and impact {{resistance in the}} heat treated condition. It is used extensively in gears, pinions, <b>springs,</b> <b>shafts,</b> axles, pins, bolts, etc., which require high modulus of resilience. The alloy was realised through conventional melt route of electric arc furnace (EAF) followed by ESR. The application of the alloy {{is limited to a}} section thickness of 15 mm [1]. Hence obtaining optimum mechanical properties becomes a challenging task. In this study, the hardening as well as tempering operations were limited to 15 mm thickness. The samples from the alloy were subjected to hardening at 860 °C for 1. 25 h. and oil quenching to room temperature followed by tempering at four different temperatures of 250, 300, 370 & 450 °C for 3 h. each with oil quenching to room temperature. It was found that the alloy exhibited good combination of strength and ductility when tempered at 450 °C. Microstructural study revealed the presence of fine tempered lath martensite along with the presence of a very small amount of delta ferrite along prior austenitic grain boundaries.

40|$|Purpose】–The {{purpose of}} this paper is to clarify the effects of shot peening (SP) on the {{torsional}} fatigue limit of high‐strength steel specimens containing an artificial small defect. 【Design/methodology/approach】–Specimens containing a drilled hole 0. 1 ‐ 0. 4 [*]mm deep or a semi‐circular slit 0. 15 or 0. 3 [*]mm deep were subjected to SP. Torsional fatigue tests were then carried out. 【Findings】–The torsional fatigue limits of specimens containing a drilled hole and those with a semi‐circular slit were increased 25 ‐ 64 per cent and 156 ‐ 186 per cent by SP, respectively. The torsional fatigue limits of the specimens subjected to SP and containing a drilled hole less than 0. 1 [*]mm in depth or a semi‐circular slit less than 0. 15 [*]mm in depth were almost equal to those of SP specimens without a defect. Based on these results, it can be concluded that a drilled hole less than 0. 1 [*]mm in depth and a semi‐circular slit less than 0. 15 [*]mm in depth could be rendered harmless by SP. 【Practical implications】–The proposed method can be applied to mechanical parts subjected to cyclic torsion, such as coil <b>springs,</b> crank <b>shafts</b> and drive shafts. 【Originality/value】–This is the first paper to investigate the torsional fatigue limits after SP in materials containing a surface defect. In this paper, the effect of SP on the torsional fatigue limit having a surface defect is investigated...|$|R

50|$|The Strowger switch uses two telegraph-type keys on a {{telephone}} set for dialing. Each key requires a separate wire to the exchange. The keys are tapped to step the switch in two stages. The {{first set of}} incoming pulses raises the {{armature of an electromagnet}} to move a shaft which selects the desired level of contacts, by engaging a pawl with the upper ratchet. Another pawl, pivoting on the frame, holds the shaft at that height as it rotates. The second set of pulses, from the second key, operates another electromagnet. Its pawl engages the (hidden) vertical teeth in the lower ratchet to rotate the shaft to the required position. It is kept there against spring tension by a pawl pivoted on the frame. When the switch returns to its home position, typically when a call is complete, a release magnet disengages the pawls that hold the shaft in position. An interlock ensures that the <b>spring</b> on the <b>shaft</b> rotates it to angular home position before it drops to its home position by gravity.|$|R
