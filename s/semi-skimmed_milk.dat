Raw milk and full-cream UHT milk did not differ for human-like leptin. Leptin content of full-cream pasteurized milk was not different to that of full-cream UHT milk, but it was 14 % lower (p < 0. 05) than that observed in raw milk. Human-like leptin level of <b>semi-skimmed</b> UHT <b>milk</b> was not different to that of <b>semi-skimmed</b> pasteurized <b>milk,</b> but it was 30 % lower (p < 0. 0001) than those of full-cream UHT and full-cream pasteurized milks.

Inactivation and denaturation kinetics were analysed in whole, <b>semi-skimmed</b> and skimmed <b>milk.</b> In previous experiments (isothermal and non-isothermal heating conditions), heat inactivation of ALP and Lpo and heat denaturation of beta-lg were found to follow first order kinetics. This allowed experimental design to be simplified. Data analysis was performed by non-linear regression and results were evaluated by construction of joint confidence regions. The possible effect of milk fat was illustrated by temperature time tolerance (TTT-) diagrams. Although initial ALP activity was lower in skimmed <b>milk</b> compared with <b>semi-skimmed</b> or whole <b>milk,</b> kinetics were comparable and fat content did not seem to substantially affect the ALP test result for pasteurized milk. Unlike ALP, Lpo inactivation and beta-lg denaturation kinetics differed significantly in milk with different fat content.

40|$|As {{populations are}} ageing, more {{emphasis}} is placed on healthy ageing. Over the past decades, food consumption patterns and food availability have also changed drastically, and therefore this study aimed to describe these changes in an ageing population. Subjects/Methods:Food consumption of participants from the Medical Research Council National Survey on Health and Development, a British birth cohort study, was assessed using a 5 -day estimated food records at 60 - 64 years (2006 - 11), 53 years (1999), 43 years (1989) and 36 years (1982). Only those who recorded ≥ 3 days at all four time points were included in the analyses, n= 989 (n= 438 men and n= 551 women); trends were tested using the Friedman test. Results:Consumption of white bread, whole milk, fats and oils, meat and meat products, alcoholic drinks, coffee, sugar, preserves and confectionery decreased (P< 0. 001), whereas consumption of wholemeal and granary bread, <b>semi-skimmed</b> <b>milk,</b> fish and fruit and vegetables increased (P< 0. 001) over time. These observed changes in food consumption reflect a healthier diet, for example, replacement of white bread by granary and wholemeal bread, lower consumption of red and processed meats, somewhat higher consumption of fish, higher consumption of vegetables and lower consumption of coffee. This could partly be because of ageing of the cohort or compliance with dietary recommendations, facilitated by greater availability of healthier foods, such as <b>semi-skimmed</b> <b>milk</b> and wholegrain bread, in the UK.

Thirty healthy postmenopausal women aged 59 · 3 (sd 3 · 3) years were enrolled in a prospective crossover trial of 16 weeks. After a 4 -week period of adaptation with diet providing 600 mg calcium plus 300 mg ingested as 250 ml <b>semi-skimmed</b> <b>milk,</b> participants were maintained during 6 weeks under the same 600 mg calcium diet and randomized to receive either 500 ml <b>semi-skimmed</b> <b>milk,</b> thus providing a total of 1200 mg calcium, or no milk supplement. In the next 6 weeks they were switched to the alternative regimen. At the end of the each period, i. e. after 4, 10 and 16 weeks, blood and urinary samples were collected. The changes in blood variables between the periods of 6 weeks without and with milk supplementation were: for parathyroid hormone, − 3 · 2 pg/ml (P= 0 · 0054); for crosslinked telopeptide of type I collagen, − 624 pg/ml (P< 0 · 0001); for propeptide of type I procollagen, − 5 · 5 ng/ml (P= 0 · 0092); for osteocalcin, − 2 · 8 ng/ml (P= 0 · 0014).

40|$|International audienceAbstractMilk {{proteins}} contained encrypted {{in their}} sequence biologically active components {{that can be}} released by enzymatic hydrolysis. Among the biological activities recognized in milk components, the antioxidant activity is of great interest. The objective {{of the present study}} was to analyse the antioxidant properties of whole, <b>semi-skimmed</b> and skimmed <b>milk</b> during simulated gastrointestinal digestion and to identify the compounds responsible for the antioxidant activity. Simulated digestion increased the 2, 2 ′-azino-bis(3 -ethylbenzothiazoline- 6 -sulphonic acid (ABTS) + radical scavenging activity of milk. In digested whole milk, the main contribution to ABTS+ radical scavenging activity was due to high molecular weight fraction (> 3  kg. mol− 1). For <b>semi-skimmed</b> and skimmed <b>milk,</b> the main contribution was due to low molecular weight fraction (< 3  kg. mol− 1). Twelve major peaks were collected from low molecular weight fraction of digested skimmed milk by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography and evaluated for their ABTS+ radical scavenging activity. Among the different fractions, three (F 2, F 3 and F 5) showed high ABTS+ and hydroxyl radical scavenging activity and lipid peroxidation inhibitory capacity. The compounds (free amino acids and peptides) present in these fractions were identified with nano-LC-QTOF MS/MS analysis. The amino acids tryptophan and tyrosine seemed fundamental in the ABTS+ and hydroxyl radical scavenging capacities whereas the amino acids phenylalanine and histidine played an important role in the lipid peroxidation inhibitory activity of the peptides. The results reported in this study suggested that milk proteins could act as a carrier for the delivery of antioxidant compounds in the gastrointestinal tract possibly protecting the gastrointestinal tract itself from the oxidative damage...|$|R

Pasteurised and sterilised (UHT) milk were produced, as well as set-type yoghurt and cheese. Samples were analysed for 29 PAs using LC-MS/MS, of which 11 PAs were detected above LOQ in the samples (0. 1 µg l− 1). Alterations in the PA concentration and composition between the standardised milk and the corresponding end-product(s) were evaluated. The heat treatments applied for pasteurisation and UHT sterilisation to prepare <b>semi-skimmed</b> consumption <b>milk</b> did not affect the PA levels in the end-products. In yoghurt, after fermentation of standardised milk (6 h, pH 4. 4), 73 % of total PAs were recovered. The PA concentration, specifically dehydrojacoline, was decreased, although not quantifiable, during cheese production. A further decrease of 38 % during 6 weeks of ripening was observed. The results show that the PA concentration of natural contaminated cow’s milk is not affected by heat treatment applied for pasteurised and sterilised milk, but that microbial fermentation of the milk leads to a lowered PA concentration in yoghurt and cheese. This is probably due to microbiological degradation, since PAs are fairly stable under acidic conditions...|$|R

40|$|In {{the context}} of the general {{applicability}} of hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), lactulose and furosine as time-temperature integrators (TTls) for thermal processing of milk, the influence of milk fat content was studied. Formation kinetics were analysed for milk with fat content of 4. 0 +/- < 0. 1 %. In previous experiments, it was observed that, under isothermal and non-isothermal heating conditions, formation of the three chemical compounds could be described by pseudo-zero order kinetics. Since the kinetic model was known, the experimental design could be simplified. Data were analysed by a non-linear regression procedure and results were evaluated by construction of joint confidence regions and temperature time tolerance (TTT-) diagrams. Formation kinetics of HMF and lactulose was not affected by milk fat content. Regarding furosine, significant differences were observed between kinetic parameters in whole, <b>semi-skimmed</b> and skimmed <b>milk.</b> The observed differences however were negligible in {{the context of}} process impact evaluation. status: publishe...|$|R
