It is a local version of the van der Waals force between molecules.

30|$|Second, we {{investigated}} the acoustic sources, including {{the location of}} speakers and the <b>sweep</b> frequency <b>range</b> of the FM-chirped acoustic signals. We found that the speakers located {{in the center of}} the EAR antenna were most effective, but speakers outside the antenna were also useful for obtaining the RASS echoes in the lower altitudes when the wind velocity became large.|$|R
50|$|A {{second type}} of {{equalizer}} used in monitor systems are parametric equalizers. A parametric equalizer does not use fixed frequency bands. Instead each frequency band can be adjusted. The center frequency can be adjusted over a several-octave range. The bandwidth of each band can be adjusted from a wide Q affecting several octaves to a narrow Q affecting 1/3rd, 1/6th, or less of an octave, {{and the level of}} the band can be adjusted. Each band may have a different frequency <b>sweep</b> <b>range,</b> with the left or lower bands sweeping the lower octaves, the middle bands sweeping the middle octaves, and the right or higher bands sweeping the higher octaves. There is normally a lot of overlap between bands. Parametric equalizers typically have 3 to 5 filtering bands per channel. Examples of parametric equalizers are Rane PE 55 and Klark Teknik DN410.|$|E
50|$|There is {{very little}} {{spectral}} content beyond the sweep frequency range of a chirp pulse and {{this is especially true}} for waveforms where the time-bandwidth product is large. The full line on the graph of the adjacent figure shows results for linear chirps. It shows, for example, that only about 2% of the total power resides at frequencies outside the <b>sweep</b> <b>range</b> F when the time-bandwidth is 100, and it is less than 1/2% when T.F is 500. In the case of a non-linear chirp, or a linear chirp shaped by amplitude weighting, the fraction of power outside F is even lower, as is shown on the graph, where the dashed line is for spectra with Hamming profiles.This low spectral spread is particularly significant when baseband signals are to be digitized since it permits a sampling frequency to be chosen which is only slightly higher than twice the maximum frequency excursion of the chirp.|$|E
50|$|Voltage-to-Frequency {{converters}} are voltage-controlled oscillators, with {{a highly}} linear relation between applied voltage and frequency. They are used to convert a slow analog signal (such as from a temperature transducer) to a digital signal for transmission over a long distance, since the frequency will not drift or be affected by noise. VCOs may have sine and/or square wave outputs. Function generators are low-frequency oscillators which feature multiple waveforms, typically sine, square, and triangle waves. Monolithic function generators are voltage-controlled. Analog phase-locked loops typically contain VCOs. High-frequency VCOs are usually used in phase-locked loops for radio receivers. Phase noise {{is the most important}} specification for them. Low-frequency VCOs are used in analog music synthesizers. For these, <b>sweep</b> <b>range,</b> linearity, and distortion are often most important specs. Audio-frequency VCOs for use in musical contexts were largely superseded in the 1980s by their digital counterparts, DCOs, due to their output stability in the face of temperature changes during operation. From the 1990s on, pure software is the primary sound-generating method, but VCOs have become popular again often thanks to their imperfections.|$|E
30|$|The Pt-ring counter {{electrode}} (6.0351. 100, Metrohm) and Ag/AgCl reference electrode (6.0750. 100, Metrohm) were commercially available {{and used for}} all the measurements.

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} {{an optical}} fiber fault location method {{based on the}} frequency response of the modulated fiber optical backscattered signal in a steady state low-frequency step regime. Careful calibration and measurement allows for {{the reconstruction of the}} fiber transfer function, which, associated to its mathematical model, is capable of extracting the fiber characteristics. The technique is capable of identifying non-reflective fault events in an optical fiber link and is perfectly compatible with previous methods that focus on the reflective events. The fact that the recuperation of the complex signal is performed in the frequency domain and not via a Fourier Transform enables the measurements to overcome the spatial resolution limitation of Fourier Transform incoherent-OFDR measurements even with frequency <b>sweep</b> <b>ranges</b> down to 100 - 100000 Hz.

50|$|A manual {{door closer}} stores the energy {{used in the}} opening of the door in a {{compression}} or torsion spring and releases it to close the door. Some closers allow for adjustment of the strength of the spring, making it easier or more difficult to push the door open. To limit the speed at which the door closes, most door closers use hydraulic (oil-filled) dampers, although spring mechanisms may also be used for damping. Some closers incorporate a back-check facility which prevents the door from being opened too fast; this is useful for, for example, external doors where there is a danger of wind catching and blowing it open, something which could otherwise cause damage to the doorset and/or objects and/or people near it. The speed at which the door closer closes the door may be adjustable by up to three adjustment valves. These valves often adjust the sweep speed and the latch speed of the door and some closers are optioned with a delayed action valve. The latch speed is the speed that the door travels in the last third to 10 degrees as it closes and is often set fast so that the door can properly latch closed. The sweep speed is the speed which the door travels at along the first two thirds of its travel and is often set slower than the latch speed. For openings where a much longer close time is desired, one may opt for a delayed action closer. The delayed action valve slows the sweep speed dramatically for roughly {{the first half of the}} <b>sweep</b> <b>range.</b> Door closers which provide this two or three-stage action and close doors at a determined rate are called 'controlled' door closers.|$|E

Unlike common hyster-esis, a disparity in the sub-threshold swing of the transfer curves was observed. This distinction showed a linear increase according to light intensity, and is thought {{to come from the}} light enabled motion of ionized oxygen vacancies (VO 2 þ). The positively charged nature of these defects causes them to show a different distribution in the channel according to sweep direction.

40|$|We have {{developed}} experimental methods for {{the generation of}} chirped laser pulses of controlled frequency evolution in the nanosecond pulse length range for coherent atomic interaction studies. The pulses are sliced from the radiation of a cw external cavity diode laser while its drive current, and consequently its frequency, are sinusoidally modulated. By the proper choice of the modulation parameters, {{as well as of}} the timing of pulse slicing, we can produce a wide variety of frequency <b>sweep</b> <b>ranges</b> during the pulse. In order to obtain the required frequency chirp, we need to stabilize the center frequency of the modulated laser and to measure the resulting frequency evolution with appropriate temporal resolution. These tasks have been solved by creating a beat signal with a reference laser locked to an atomic transition frequency. The beat signal is then analyzed, as well as its spectral sideband peaks are fed back to the electronics of the frequency stabilization of the modulated laser. This method is simple and it has the possibility for high speed frequency sweep with narrow bandwidth that is appropriate, for example, for selective manipulation of atomic states in a magneto-optical trap...|$|R
40|$|Three {{methods for}} calculating span load distribution, those {{developed}} by V. M Falkner, Wm. Mutterperl, and J. Weissinger, {{have been applied}} to five swept wings.

From the analysis {{it was found that the}} Weissinger method would be best suited to an over-all study of the effects of plan form on the span loading and associated characteristics of wings. The method gave good, but not best, accuracy and involved by far the least computing effort. The Falkner method gave the best accuracy but at a considerable expanse in computing effort and hence appeared to be most useful for a detailed study of a specific wing.

30|$|In summary, the {{electrical}} transport properties of two-terminal Au/WO 3 nanowire/Au devices depend on bias <b>sweep</b> <b>range,</b> temperature, and the symmetry {{of the two}} ohmic contacts due to the drift of oxygen vacancies under strong electric field. These devices exhibit resistive behavior under small bias voltage at room temperature and memristive behavior at elevated temperature or under large bias <b>sweep</b> <b>range.</b> If the two ohmic contacts are asymmetric, the concentration distribution of oxygen vacancies along the axial direction of WO 3 nanowire can be more easily regulated, and then {{the electrical}} transport properties can be modulated remarkably. The electronic devices can exhibit controllable linear resistance (up to four orders of magnitude) when the drift of oxygen vacancies is negligible, and will exhibit asymmetric memristive effect and rectifying characteristic when the oxygen vacancies prefer to drift. Based on the drift of oxygen vacancies, several nanodevice prototypes (such as memristor, rectifier, and two-terminal RRAM) have been proposed on individual WO 3 nanowires.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{concerns}} a Wavelength-Swept Fiber Laser (WSFL) incorporating frequency shifted feedback and an intra-cavity passband filter, {{in which the}} wavelength of the modeless output is linearly, continuously and repeatedly tuned (in time) over a given range by modulation of the filter peak wavelength and filter strength. We show both numerically and experimentally that amplifier noise {{plays a key role}} in determining the operating modes of frequency-shifted fiber laser systems and that a noisy amplifier can be used to suppress the natural tendency of such lasers to pulse allowing for continuous wave, modeless operation. Furthermore, we show that significant narrowing of a WSFL instantaneous swept linewidth can be obtained if the filter peak transmission wavelength is resonantly swept so as to follow the wavelength shift per pass due to the acousto-optic frequency shift. Using these ideas we go on to demonstrate and characterize a high power, diode-driven, Er 3 +/Yb 3 + WSFL incorporating a bulk-optic Acousto-Optic Tunable Filter (AOTF). Linewidths as narrow as 9 GHz, <b>sweep</b> <b>ranges</b> up to 38 nm and output powers as high as 100 mW are obtained. Furthermore, we demonstrate the generation of user definable average spectral output by synchronous modulation of the filter strength and multi-wavelength pulsed output at higher sweep rates.

Our simulations show that reduced linewidth (< 0. 02 nm) and improved scan linearity should be readily achievable with realistic system improvements.
