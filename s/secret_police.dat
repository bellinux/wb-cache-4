5|$|In 2006 Wałęsa quit Solidarity {{in protest}} of the union's support of the ruling right-wing Law and Justice party, and Lech and Jarosław Kaczyński—twin {{brothers}} who had been prominent in Solidarity and were now serving as the country’s president and prime minister, respectively. The main point of disagreement was the Kaczyńskis’ focus on rooting out {{those who had been}} involved in communist rule and their party's attempt to make public all the files of the former communist <b>secret</b> <b>police.</b> Until then only members of the government and parliament had to declare any connection with the former security services. Wałęsa and his supporters argued the so-called transparency legislation advocated by the government might turn into a witch hunt and the more than 500,000 Poles who had possibly collaborated with the communist <b>secret</b> <b>police</b> could face exposure.|$|E
5|$|After Kamo's {{release from}} prison, {{he worked in}} the Soviet customs office, by some {{accounts}} because he was too unstable to work for the <b>secret</b> <b>police.</b> He died in 1922 when a truck hit him while he was cycling.

Hergé used his brother, Paul Remi, as the model for Sponsz, although he was also influenced by the image of the Austrian American filmmaker Erich von Stroheim.|$|E

5|$|As part of {{consolidating}} Stalin's {{control over}} the Eastern Bloc, the People's Commissariat for Internal Affairs (NKVD), led by Lavrentiy Beriya, supervised the establishment of Soviet-style <b>secret</b> <b>police</b> systems in the Bloc {{that were supposed to}} crush anti-communist resistance. When the slightest stirrings of independence emerged in the Bloc, Stalin's strategy matched that of dealing with domestic pre-war rivals: they were removed from power, put on trial, imprisoned, and in several instances, executed.|$|E

5|$|In Czechoslovakia, {{especially}} in the week immediately following the invasion, popular opposition was expressed in numerous spontaneous acts of nonviolent resistance. On 16 January 1969, student Jan Palach set himself on fire in Prague's Wenceslas Square to protest against the renewed suppression of free speech.

5|$|Other Polish writers, however, {{rejected}} the Soviet persuasions and instead published underground: Jadwiga Czechowiczówna, Jerzy Hordyński, Jadwiga Gamska-Łempicka, Herminia Naglerowa, Beata Obertyńska, Ostap Ortwin, Tadeusz Peiper, Teodor Parnicki, Juliusz Petry. Some writers, such as Władysław Broniewski, after {{collaborating with the}} Soviets for a few months, joined the anti-Soviet opposition.

5|$|The Soviet-style {{regimes that}} {{arose in the}} Bloc not only {{reproduced}} Soviet command economies, but also adopted the brutal methods employed by Joseph Stalin and the Soviet <b>secret</b> <b>police</b> in order to suppress both real and potential opposition.

Kavandame himself surrendered to the Portuguese in April of that year.|$|E
5|$|A related {{theme is}} the moral compromises {{individuals}} make in order to succeed in immoral political systems. In an interview about Taking Sides, Szabó said, “I don't think that life is possible without making compromises. The question {{is only one of}} limits: how far to go. When one crosses the line, then the compromise starts to be a bad, even deadly, one.” This theme is dominant in the Brandauer trilogy and, as Istvan Deak points out, may be related to Szabó’s own collaboration with the Communist <b>secret</b> <b>police.</b>|$|E
