40|$|It is {{presented}} a numerical procedure able to analyse the structural behavior of steelconcrete composite beams subjected to moving loads, considering the actual cyclic nonlinear {{relationship between the}} shear force and the <b>slip</b> <b>of</b> the <b>connectors.</b> The procedure allows to determine the oscillograms <b>of</b> the <b>slip</b> and the shear force <b>of</b> each <b>connector</b> corresponding to the transit of an assigned loading pattern. Fatigue checks, based on the strain-life approach {{can be carried out}} using such a numerical tool. The procedure was used to study the cyclic behavior of the connection of a 40 m span simply supported bridge-type beam subjected to a severe loading model: fatigue model 1 (ENV 1991 - 3) with a heavy abnormal 15 axles vehicle (3600 kN). The results allowed to assess the damage accumulated in the connectors due to one thousand transits of the considered load. Significant damage occurs in the studs close to mid-span...|$|R
40|$|The use {{of partial}} shear {{connection}} in composite beams {{requires that the}} <b>slip</b> capacity <b>of</b> the <b>connectors</b> shall not be less than the maximum slip required for the beam to reach its design ultimate load. Maximum slip depends on many parameters, of which degree of shear connection and span are the most significant. It is also difficult to predict slip capacities. Research on these subjects is reported, based on non-linear numerical analyses, test data, and parametric studies. It is compared with extensive work done in France, and related to design rules given in recent British and draft European codes of practice...|$|R
40|$|Most {{available}} {{methods of}} predicting the buckling loads of layered and spaced timber columns are analytical methods. These are only suitable for columns with constant number and spacing <b>of</b> <b>connectors</b> in each joint of the columns. For added strength and for practical reasons, columns with additional connectors {{at the ends}} are more desirable. This usually {{requires the use of}} a numerical method for the prediction of their buckling loads. This paper presents a simple numerical method that can be used on microcomputers to predict the buckling loads of these columns. The method is based on the matrix progression technique. The <b>slip</b> modulus <b>of</b> the <b>connectors</b> adopted in the program is that of the Kuenzi beam on elastic foundation method. To verify the method, 89 layered and spaced timber columns were built and tested. The method was also compared with the Pleskov method...|$|R
40|$|<b>Slips</b> <b>of</b> {{mechanical}} <b>connectors</b> {{in steel}} plate reinforced concrete (RC) structures can significantly affect the load-carrying {{capacity of the}} structures. The difference in deformation between the steel plate and the reinforced concrete counterpart is known as partial interaction. In this study, the flexural behaviour of bolted side-plated (BSP) reinforced concrete beams was investigated experimentally. Two new deformation-based parameters, namely the strain factor and curvature factor, were introduced to quantify the degree of partial interaction between the RC beam and the steel plates. The experimental results revealed {{that the degree of}} partial interaction between RC beams and steel plates could be reduced by as much as 50 % when the BSP beam proceeded from a linear to a non-linear stage in which plastic hinges have formed in critical sections. Consequently, the load-carrying capacity was reduced by up to 30 % of the theoretical additional strength provided by the bolt-plate system, which is more than double the allowance proposed previously in the literature. The under-estimation of the effect of partial interaction in composite structures can result in unsafe design. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. postprin...|$|R
40|$|A timber-concrete {{composite}} structure (TCC) is economically and environmentally friendly. One {{of the key}} design points {{of this kind of}} structure is to ensure the reliability <b>of</b> the shear <b>connectors.</b> The objective <b>of</b> this paper is to study the mechanical property <b>of</b> stud-groove-type <b>connectors</b> and to provide shear capacity equations for stud-groove connectors in timber-concrete {{composite structure}}s. Based on the Johansen Yield Theory (European Yield Model), some mechanical models and capacity equations for stud-groove-type connectors in timber-concrete structures were studied. Push-out specimens with different parameters (stud diameter, stud length, groove width, and groove depth) were tested to obtain the shear capacity and slip modulus. The experimental strengths were used to validate equations given in the paper. The shear capacity and <b>slip</b> modulus <b>of</b> stud-groove-type <b>connectors</b> was in direct proportion to the diameter of studs and the dimension of the groove. Comparison between the theoretical and the experimental shear strength results showed reasonable agreement.

40|$|Bridge {{projects}} {{constructed in}} Texas which utilize precast bent caps typically employ grouted vertical ducts in the cap-to-column connections. This {{type of connection}} is preferred due to the simple geometry and because the volume of grout needed to complete the connections is minimized. A number of questions related to {{the sensitivity of the}} behavior of the grouted vertical-duct connectors to design parameters were identified during the design and construction of these bridges. Thirty-two, large-scale pullout tests <b>of</b> <b>connectors</b> grouted in galvanized steel and plastic ducts were conducted to investigate the response of this type <b>of</b> <b>connector.</b> The results indicate that the tensile capacity is sensitive to the type of duct, the embedded length <b>of</b> the <b>connector,</b> the number <b>of</b> <b>connectors</b> tested simultaneously in tension, and the placement <b>of</b> the <b>connector</b> within the duct. However, the results were not sensitive to epoxy coating on the connector or to the presence of spiral transverse reinforcement around the group <b>of</b> <b>connectors.</b> Design equations are proposed for the minimum embedded length <b>of</b> all <b>connectors</b> to satisfy serviceability concerns and for the development length necessary to resist the calculated tensile stresses in the connectors under the design load combinations...|$|R

While the structure <b>of</b> <b>connectors</b> resembles hypergraphs, their semantics is given in terms of so-called port automata. We define both models in a categorical setting where composition operations can be elegantly defined and integrated. Specifically, we formalize structural gluings <b>of</b> <b>connectors</b> as pushouts, and joins of port automata as pullbacks. We then define a semantical functor from the connector to the port automata category which preserves this composition. We further show how to encode Reo connectors and Petri nets into this model and indicate applications to dynamic reconfigurations modeled using double pushout graph transformation. ...|$|R
