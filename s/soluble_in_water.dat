5|$|Zr and Hf {{can also}} be {{separated}} by fractional crystallization of potassium hexafluorozirconate (K2ZrF6), which is less <b>soluble</b> <b>in</b> <b>water</b> than the analogous hafnium derivative.|$|E
5|$|Copper(I) chloride, {{commonly}} called cuprous chloride, is the lower chloride of copper, with the formula CuCl. The substance {{is a white}} solid sparingly <b>soluble</b> <b>in</b> <b>water,</b> but very soluble in concentrated hydrochloric acid.

50|$|Triuret is {{an organic}} {{compound}} with the formula (H2NC(O)NH)2CO. It {{is a product}} from the pyrolysis of urea. Triuret is a colorless, crystalline, hygroscopic solid, slightly <b>soluble</b> <b>in</b> cold <b>water</b> or ether, and more <b>soluble</b> <b>in</b> hot <b>water.</b> It is a planar molecule. The central carbonyl is hydrogen-bonded to both terminal amino groups.|$|R
50|$|Despite the {{reduction}} in relative permittivity, many salts remain <b>soluble</b> <b>in</b> superheated <b>water</b> until the critical point is approached. Sodium chloride, for example, dissolves at 37 wt% at 300 °CAs the critical point is approached, solubility drops markedly to a few ppm, and salts are hardly <b>soluble</b> <b>in</b> supercritical <b>water.</b> Some salts show a reduction in solubility with temperature, but this behaviour is less common.|$|R

5|$|Lead(II) nitrate is an {{inorganic}} compound with the chemical formula Pb(NO3)2. It commonly occurs as a colourless crystal or white powder and, unlike most other lead(II) salts, is <b>soluble</b> <b>in</b> <b>water.</b>|$|E
5|$|Yttrium forms a water-insoluble fluoride, hydroxide, and oxalate, but its bromide, chloride, iodide, nitrate and sulfate are all <b>soluble</b> <b>in</b> <b>water.</b> The Y3+ ion is colorless in {{solution}} {{because of}} the absence of electrons in the d and f electron shells.|$|E
5|$|Argon has {{approximately}} the same solubility in water as oxygen and is 2.5 times more <b>soluble</b> <b>in</b> <b>water</b> than nitrogen. Argon is colorless, odorless, nonflammable and nontoxic as a solid, liquid or gas. Argon is chemically inert under most conditions and forms no confirmed stable compounds at room temperature.|$|E

25|$|Furfural dissolves readily in most polar organic solvents, but is only {{slightly}} <b>soluble</b> <b>in</b> either <b>water</b> or alkanes.|$|R
50|$|L-Arginine L-pyroglutamate is a {{crystalline}} solid powder with a sour taste. It {{is easily}} <b>soluble</b> <b>in</b> cold <b>water.</b>|$|R
5|$|Because of {{the higher}} {{electronegativity}} of lithium, some of its compounds have a more covalent character. For example, lithium iodide (LiI) will dissolve in organic solvents, a property of most covalent compounds. Lithium fluoride (LiF) is the only alkali halide that is not <b>soluble</b> <b>in</b> <b>water,</b> and lithium hydroxide (LiOH) is the only alkali metal hydroxide that is not deliquescent.|$|E
5|$|Psilocybin is an {{alkaloid}} that is <b>soluble</b> <b>in</b> <b>water,</b> methanol and aqueous ethanol, but insoluble {{in organic}} solvents like chloroform and petroleum ether. Its pKa values {{are estimated to}} be 1.3 and 6.5 for the two successive phosphate OH groups and 10.4 for the dimethylamine nitrogen, so in general it exists as a zwitterionic structure.|$|E
5|$|These bases {{are poorly}} <b>soluble</b> <b>in</b> <b>water</b> {{and by their}} {{activity}} {{are close to the}} hydroxides of rare-earth metals. The strongest base is of actinium. All compounds of actinium are colorless, except for black actinium sulfide (Ac2S3). Dioxides of tetravalent actinides crystallize in the cubic system, same as in calcium fluoride.|$|E

5|$|Dichlorine {{monoxide}} (Cl2O) is a brownish-yellow gas (red-brown when solid or liquid) {{which may}} be obtained by reacting chlorine gas with yellow mercury(II) oxide. It is very <b>soluble</b> <b>in</b> <b>water,</b> {{in which it is}} in equilibrium with hypochlorous acid (HOCl), which it is the anhydride of. It is thus an effective bleach and is mostly used to make hypochlorites. It explodes on heating or sparking or in the presence of ammonia gas.|$|E
5|$|Dysprosium carbonate, Dy2(CO3)3, and {{dysprosium}} sulfate, Dy2(SO4)3, {{result from}} similar reactions. Most dysprosium compounds are <b>soluble</b> <b>in</b> <b>water,</b> though dysprosium carbonate tetrahydrate (Dy2(CO3)3·4H2O) and dysprosium oxalate decahydrate (Dy2(C2O4)3·10H2O) are both insoluble in water. Two {{of the most}} abundant dysprosium carbonates, tengerite-(Dy) (Dy2(CO3)3·2–3H2O) and kozoite-(Dy) (DyCO3(OH)) are known to form via a poorly ordered (amorphous) precursor phase with a formula of Dy2(CO3)3·4H2O. This amorphous precursor consists of highly hydrated spherical nanoparticles of 10–20nm diameter that are exceptionally stable under dry treatment at ambient and high temperatures.|$|E
5|$|In deep seawaters the isotope 230Th {{make up to}} 0.04% {{of natural}} thorium. This is because its parent 238U is <b>soluble</b> <b>in</b> <b>water,</b> but 230Th is {{insoluble}} and precipitates into the sediment. Uranium ores with low thorium concentrations can be purified to produce gram-sized thorium samples of which over a quarter is the 230Th isotope, since 230Th {{is one of the}} daughters of 238U. The International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) reclassified thorium as a binuclidic element in 2013.|$|E
50|$|Ammonium iodate is an {{inorganic}} salt which is sparingly <b>soluble</b> <b>in</b> cold, and moderately <b>soluble</b> <b>in</b> hot <b>water,</b> like all iodate salts, it's a strong oxidizer.|$|R
50|$|Pseudoglobulins are a {{class of}} globulins that are more <b>soluble</b> <b>in</b> {{ammonium}} sulfate than euglobulins. Pseudoglobulins are also <b>soluble</b> <b>in</b> pure <b>water,</b> while euglobulins are not.|$|R
50|$|<b>In</b> cold <b>water</b> {{it is only}} {{partially}} dissolved, leaving a pale flocculent residue which is <b>soluble</b> <b>in</b> boiling <b>water</b> but deposited again upon cooling. It is <b>soluble</b> <b>in</b> alcohol and caustic alkalis, but not in ether.|$|R
5|$|Lutetium metal is {{slightly}} unstable in air at standard conditions, but it burns readily at 150°C to form lutetium oxide. The resulting compound {{is known to}} absorb water and carbon dioxide, and {{may be used to}} remove vapors of these compounds from closed atmospheres. Similar observations are made during reaction between lutetium and water (slow when cold and fast when hot); lutetium hydroxide is formed in the reaction. Lutetium metal is known to react with the four lightest halogens to form trihalides; all of them (except the fluoride) are <b>soluble</b> <b>in</b> <b>water.</b>|$|E
5|$|The halides ScX3, where X = Cl, Br, or I, {{are very}} <b>soluble</b> <b>in</b> <b>water,</b> but ScF3 is insoluble. In all four halides, the {{scandium}} is 6-coordinated. The halides are Lewis acids; for example, ScF3 dissolves {{in a solution}} containing excess fluoride ion to form 3−. The coordination number 6 is typical for Sc(III). In the larger Y3+ and La3+ ions, coordination numbers of 8 and 9 are common. Scandium(III) triflate is sometimes used as a Lewis acid catalyst in organic chemistry.|$|E
5|$|The {{interactions}} of carbonate anions with uranium(VI) cause the Pourbaix diagram to change greatly when the medium is changed from {{water to a}} carbonate containing solution. While {{the vast majority of}} carbonates are insoluble in water (students are often taught that all carbonates other than those of alkali metals are insoluble in water), uranium carbonates are often <b>soluble</b> <b>in</b> <b>water.</b> This is because a U(VI) cation is able to bind two terminal oxides and three or more carbonates to form anionic complexes.|$|E
5000|$|Kernite is <b>soluble</b> <b>in</b> cold <b>water</b> and alters to tincalconite when it dehydrates. It {{undergoes}} a non-reversible alteration to metakernite (...) when heated to above 100 °C.|$|R
50|$|In pure form, {{valpromide}} {{is a white}} {{crystalline powder}} and has melting point 125-126 °C. It is practically insoluble <b>in</b> <b>water</b> but <b>soluble</b> <b>in</b> hot <b>water.</b> It {{is available on the}} market in some European countries.|$|R
50|$|Caesium {{perchlorate}}, CsClO4 (also {{known as}} cesium perchlorate), is a perchlorate of caesium. It forms white crystals, which are sparingly <b>soluble</b> <b>in</b> cold <b>water</b> and ethanol. It dissolves more easily <b>in</b> hot <b>water.</b>|$|R
5|$|Antioxidants are {{classified}} into two broad divisions, {{depending on whether}} they are <b>soluble</b> <b>in</b> <b>water</b> (hydrophilic) or in lipids (lipophilic). In general, water-soluble antioxidants react with oxidants in the cell cytosol and the blood plasma, while lipid-soluble antioxidants protect cell membranes from lipid peroxidation. These compounds may be synthesized in the body or obtained from the diet. The different antioxidants are present at {{a wide range of}} concentrations in body fluids and tissues, with some such as glutathione or ubiquinone mostly present within cells, while others such as uric acid are more evenly distributed (see table below). Some antioxidants are only found in a few organisms and these compounds can be important in pathogens and can be virulence factors.|$|E
5|$|Elemental iodine is {{slightly}} <b>soluble</b> <b>in</b> <b>water,</b> with one gram dissolving in 3450ml at 20°C and 1280ml at 50°C; potassium iodide may {{be added to}} increase solubility via formation of triiodide ions, among other polyiodides. Nonpolar solvents such as hexane and carbon tetrachloride provide a higher solubility. Polar solutions, such as aqueous solutions, are brown, reflecting the role of these solvents as Lewis bases; on the other hand, nonpolar solutions are violet, the color of iodine vapour. Charge-transfer complexes form when iodine is dissolved in polar solvents, hence changing the colour. Iodine is violet when dissolved in carbon tetrachloride and saturated hydrocarbons but deep brown in alcohols and amines, solvents that form charge-transfer adducts.|$|E
5|$|Lead(II) {{compounds}} {{are characteristic}} of the inorganic chemistry of lead. Even strong oxidizing agents like fluorine and chlorine react with lead to give only PbF2 and PbCl2. Lead(II) ions are usually colorless in solution, and partially hydrolyze to form Pb(OH)+ and finally Pb4(OH)4 (in which the hydroxyl ions act as bridging ligands), but are not reducing agents as tin(II) ions are. Techniques for identifying {{the presence of the}} Pb2+ ion in water generally rely on the precipitation of lead(II) chloride using dilute hydrochloric acid. As the chloride salt is somewhat <b>soluble</b> <b>in</b> <b>water,</b> the precipitation of lead(II) sulfide, by bubbling hydrogen sulfide through the solution, is then attempted.|$|E
