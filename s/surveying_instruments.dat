5|$|The W.F. Stanley and Co. company {{continued}} to expand after Stanley's death, {{moving to a}} factory in New Eltham (The Stanley Scientific Instrument Works) in 1916. During World War I, the factory was requisitioned by the government. Between the wars, it {{continued to}} expand {{its position in the}} market place for quality <b>surveying</b> <b>instruments,</b> although it was requisitioned by the British Government during World War II. After the war, the company continued to expand, participating in many large project– for example, RMS Queen Mary and Royal Navy ships used the company's compasses and other navigational instruments. The company went into liquidation in July 1999– the main factors were not investing the proceeds of the sale of the factory land to buying new machinery, the high value of the pound affecting export orders, and the loss of Ministry of Defence orders following the end of the Cold War.|$|E
5|$|Stanley {{produced}} a 'Panoptic Stereoscope' in 1855, which was financially successful. Stereoscopes had sold for five shillings each– Stanley discovered a simpler method to make them, which {{enable him to}} sell them for one shilling. He {{was able to take}} an additional shops at 3–4 Great Turnstile and 286 High Holborn, as well as a skilled assistant. He did not patent the Panoptic, so it was soon copied around the world, but he had sold enough to provide the capital required to manufacture scientific instruments. In 1861 he invented a straight line dividing machine for which he won first prize in the 1862 International Exhibition in London. Stanley brought out the first catalogue of his products in 1864. By the fifth edition, Stanley was able to list important customers such as several government departments, the Army, the Royal Navy, railways at home and abroad, and London University. From 1865, he worked on improving the elegance and stability of <b>surveying</b> <b>instruments,</b> especially the theodolite, whose construction he simplified. It had a rotating telescope for measuring horizontal and vertical angles and able to take sights on prominent objects at a distance. The component parts were reduced to fewer than half of the 226 used in the previous version, making it lighter, cheaper and more accurate.|$|E

They were essential in all building operations, but especially in aqueduct construction, where a uniform gradient was important to the provision of a regular supply of water without damage to the walls of the channel. He also developed one of the first odometers, consisting of a wheel of known circumference that dropped a pebble into a container on every rotation.|$|E
25|$|The first {{priority}} when beginning a settlement was {{the location and}} construction of the church (iglesia). The majority of mission sanctuaries were oriented on a roughly east–west axis to {{take the best advantage}} of the sun's position for interior illumination; the exact alignment depended on the geographic features of the particular site. Once the spot for the church was selected, its position would be marked and the remainder of the mission complex would be laid out. The priests' quarters, refectory, convento, workshops, kitchens, soldiers' and servants' living quarters, storerooms, and other ancillary chambers were usually grouped around a walled, open court or patio (often {{in the form of a}} quadrangle) inside which religious celebrations and other festive events often took place. The cuadrángulo was rarely a perfect square because the Fathers had no <b>surveying</b> <b>instruments</b> at their disposal and simply measured off all dimensions by foot. In the event of an attack by hostile forces the mission's inhabitants could take refuge within the quadrangle.|$|E

500|$|Detzner made {{attempts}} {{to explain away}} specific ambiguities, contradictions, and errors. In 1915, he said, he lost his <b>surveying</b> <b>instruments</b> while eluding an Australian patrol, which explained why many of his assertions were vague and inconclusive, and his calculations inaccurate. [...] This was true, the Australians did find a box of Detzner's equipment in the location where the missionary Johann Flierl's oldest son, Wilhelm, had kept (or stored) his small canoe. [...] Although Wilhelm denied helping Detzner and his men, the Australians arrested him. The event coincided with one of Detzner's narrow escapes from Australian patrols in 1915 and was inadvertently corroborated in 1919 by the angry letter to The Argus's editor. [...] Some of Detzner's assertions could be sustained through observable physical evidence: he had reportedly wasted to a mere [...] while roaming in the bush, which should not have happened, some supporters claimed, if he had indeed been {{under the protection of}} Keyser and Thiele. On the other hand, this weight loss could also have been due to his debilitating illness in 1917.|$|E

2500|$|Based on archaeological and textual evidence, Joseph E. Schwartzberg (2008)—a University of Minnesota {{professor}} emeritus of geography—traces the origins of Indian cartography to the Indus Valley Civilization (c. 2500–1900 BCE). The use of large scale constructional plans, cosmological drawings, and cartographic material was known in India with some regularity since the Vedic period (2nd - 1st millennium BCE). Climatic conditions {{were responsible for the}} destruction of most of the evidence, however, a number of excavated <b>surveying</b> <b>instruments</b> and measuring rods have yielded convincing evidence of early cartographic activity.

Ancient bricks found throughout the region have dimensions that correspond to these units.' The Indus civilisation constructed pan balances made of copper, bronze, and ceramics. One excavated pan balance from Mohenjo-daro (26001900 BCE) was constructed using a cord-pivot type fulcrum, a bronze beam, and two pans.
