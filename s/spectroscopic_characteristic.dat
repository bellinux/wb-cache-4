40|$|Absorption of {{infrared}} radiation by various line and band models are briefly reviewed. Narrow band model relations for absorptance {{are used to}} develop 'exact' formulations for total absorption by four wide band models. Application of a wide band model to a particular gas largely depends upon the <b>spectroscopic</b> <b>characteristic</b> of the absorbing-emitting molecule. Seven continuous correlations for the absorption of a wide band model are presented and {{each one of these}} is compared with the exact (numerical) solutions of the wide band models. Comparison of these results indicate the validity of a correlation for a particular radiative transfer application.

The lower reorganization energy of the DH-TAT over the DH-TNT calculated by the density functional theory is attributed to a smaller vibrational distortion because of the heavier building block of DH-TAT, and it shows a good field effect performance over the DH-TNT.

40|$|Surface Enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS) is {{a surface}} {{analysis}} technique with high sensitivity,which is widely {{applied in the}} study of the behavior of interface adsorption,molecular interface orientation,and the change of the adsorption. Self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) technique is regarded as a reasonable method to controllably construct an orderly uniform layers that can provide a simple interfacial model for surface analysis. N-(4, 6 -di-methoxypyrimidin- 2 -y 1) -N′-nicotinoylthioure(DMPNT) is a newly synthesized functional molecule,which will hopefully become the special herbicide for the lawns. However,no <b>spectroscopic</b> <b>characteristic</b> of this molecule has been reported. In this work,the adsorption and desorption behavior of DMPNT monolayer on an Ag electrode was observed by in-situ SERS. The experimental results showed that DMPNT was self-assembled on Ag surface through thiol group with its pyridine ring close to the surface. The adsorption behavior of DMPNT changed along with the negative-shifting of the potential:the pyridine ring turned over,and the amido and the methoxy group became closer to the surface.

The first two singlet electronic transitions of this series, 1 S 0 â†’ 1 S 1 (n,Ï€*) and 1 S 0 â†’ 1 S 2 (Ï€,Ï€*), determine the main <b>spectroscopic</b> <b>characteristic</b> of these compounds {{in order to be}} used as potential photochemical actinometers of solar ultraviolet radiation. Furthermore, the second electronic transition, localized in the 270 â€“ 360 nm ultraviolet spectral range, presents a hipsochromic spectral shift as function of the electronic nature of the heteroatomic centers in the heterocyclic ring. In order to determine a spectroscopic assignment of the main absorption bands in aqueous solution and analyze the effect of the substituent on the electronic charge distributions in the ground and the first two singlet excited electronic states, we have used a semiempirical molecular orbital calculation in the INDO/S-CIS approach.

40|$|Resistant {{starches}} (RSs) are broadly investigated {{as appropriate}} additives in starch-based products {{due to their}} well-known and proved health benefits. However, it was shown in previous studies that these starches are sensitive of the different heat treatments used in the food processing, which can cause changes, especially in the resistance. There is an increasing trend to use microwave (MW) energy in food processing; therefore, {{our aim was to}} investigate the changes of RSs compared to native starches caused by MW heating. Maize, wheat, RS 2 and RS 4 starches were MW-treated according to a 2 × 2 experimental design (300 and 600 W of power, 30 and 150 s of time). The changes of in vitro digestibility, rheological properties (rapid visco analyser, RVA) and near infrared (NIR) <b>spectroscopic</b> <b>characteristic</b> were studied. Two spectrophotometers were applied (dispersive and Fourier-transform (FT)) to compare their sensitivity in the analysis of the MW-treated starches. Results showed that the digestibility of starches did not show any tendencies when increasing the microwave energy of treatments, the characteristics of the kinetic curves remained unchanged. The RVA analysis showed that the RSs did not gelatinize after the heat-treatments. The MW heating weakened the rheological properties of all starches. The NIR analysis was the most sensitive device for the detection of the effects of MW treatments. The analysis of the most characteristic carbohydrate regions (2080 – 2130 and 2270 – 2290 nm) highlighted structural alterations of the starches; moreover, the dispersive spectrophotometer was found to be more sensitive in the analysis of starches than the FT-one...|$|E

The algal sample was collected at its natural habitat, the East China Sea. The phycoerythrin showed an absorption spectrum and a fluorescence excitation spectrum with three peaks in the visible wave-length region at 500, 547 and 565 nm. This property {{is very different from}} that of the cyanophycean phycoerythrin, which has a single peak at 565 run, but it is similar to that of the rhodophycean phycoerythrin with three peaks at 500, 550 and 565 nm. Some blue-green algae form phycoerythrin as their main photosynthetic pigment, when grown under green light which is absorbed mainly by phycoerythrin (/, 2). The phycoerythrin of blue-green algae is known to show an absorption spectrum with a single peak at 565 nm in the visible wavelength region, and has been designated c-phycoerythrin (3, 4). This property differs from that of the phycoerythrins of the red algae. The latter pigment generally shows an absorption spectrum consisting of three peaks in the visible wavelength region at 500, 550 and 565 nm (r-phycoerythrin) (3, 4). O'hEocha reported that the blue-green alga Phormidium persicimtm contains a phycoerythrin showing a double-peaked spectrum at 543 and 568 nm, which differs from that of c-phycoerythrin.
