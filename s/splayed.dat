5|$|The {{depiction}} of Diplodocus posture has changed considerably over the years. For instance, a classic 1910 reconstruction by Oliver P. Hay depicts two Diplodocus with <b>splayed</b> lizard-like limbs {{on the banks}} of a river. Hay argued that Diplodocus had a sprawling, lizard-like gait with widely <b>splayed</b> legs, and was supported by Gustav Tornier. This hypothesis was contested by William Jacob Holland, who demonstrated that a sprawling Diplodocus would have needed a trench through which to pull its belly. Finds of sauropod footprints in the 1930s eventually put Hay's theory to rest.|$|E

40|$|High-resolution {{satellite}} imagery {{in combination with}} field investigation enables the analysis of <b>splay</b> morphological developments {{in time and space}} at the low-gradient terminus of the modern Río Colorado dryland river system in the Salar de Uyuni (Bolivia). Two sets (2004 / 2005, 2010 / 2011) of satellite images are used to visualize <b>splay</b> morphological developments and three types of crevasse <b>splays</b> are identified based on temporal changes: (1) new crevasse <b>splays</b> (NCS), refers to those <b>splays</b> that are not observed in the first set of images but can be observed on the second sets of images; (2) changing crevasse <b>splays</b> (CCS), representing those <b>splays</b> that are found on the first set of images but their geometry has changed between two satellite observation periods; and (3) inactive crevasse <b>splays</b> (ICS), referred to those <b>splays</b> that are found on the first set of images but on the second set of images they remain the same, or are partially overlapped by adjacent expanding crevasse <b>splays.</b> The density or frequency of these three types of crevasse <b>splays</b> has no correlation with the distance to the starting point of the river or the local slope. The cross-sectional area of the studied river steadily decreases downstream, and frequency analysis shows a downstream {{increase in the number of}} crevasse <b>splays</b> and suggests an exponential relationship with the river cross-sectional area. Development of crevasse <b>splays</b> is often attributed to topographic lows between adjacent crevasse <b>splays,</b> and they fill in the depression by compensational stacking e. g. Li et al. (2014). These amalgamated <b>splays</b> are capable of forming a large area of sheet sands and potentially provide an analogue for thin-bedded hydrocarbon reservoirs...|$|R

The 'M' is slightly <b>splayed</b> with outward-facing serifs at the top (sometimes only on the left) and the leg of the 'R' extends outwards from the letter. The x-height (height of lower-case letters) is low, especially at larger sizes, making the capitals large relative to the lower case, while the top serifs on the ascenders of letters like 'd' have a downward slope and ride above the cap height.

40|$|Up to 12 % of the mud-prone, ephemeral {{distributive}} fluvial system stratigraphy in the Permo-Triassic lower Beaufort Group, South Africa, comprises tabular fine-grained sandstone to coarse-grained siltstone bodies, {{which are}} interpreted as proximal to distal crevasse <b>splay</b> deposits. Crevasse <b>splay</b> sandstones predominantly exhibit ripple to climbing ripple cross-lamination, with some structureless and planar laminated beds. A hierarchical architectural scheme is adopted, {{in which each}} 1 m thick crevasse <b>splay</b> elements extend for tens to several hundreds of meters laterally, and stack with other <b>splay</b> elements to form crevasse <b>splay</b> sets up to 4 m thick and several kilometers in width and length. Paleosols and nodular horizons developed during periods, or in areas, of reduced overbank flooding are used to subdivide the stratigraphy, separating crevasse <b>splay</b> sets. Deposits from crevasse <b>splays</b> differ from frontal <b>splays</b> as their proximal deposits are much thinner and narrower, with paleocurrents oblique to the main paleochannel. In order for crevasse <b>splay</b> sets to develop, the parent channel belt and the location where crevasse <b>splays</b> form must stay relatively fixed {{during a period of}} multiple flood events. Beaufort Group <b>splays</b> have similar geometries to those of contemporary perennial rivers but exhibit more lateral variability in facies, which is interpreted {{to be the result of}} more extreme fluctuations in discharge regime. Sharp-based crevasse <b>splay</b> packages are associated with channel avulsion, but most are characterized by a gradual coarsening upward, interpreted to represent progradation. The dominance of progradational <b>splays</b> beneath channel belt deposits may be more characteristic of progradational stratigraphy in a distributive fluvial system rather than dominated by avulsion processes in a trunk river system. This stratigraphic motif may therefore be an additional criterion for recognition of distributive fluvial systems in the ancient record...|$|R
40|$|The <b>splay</b> tree, a {{self-adjusting}} form of {{binary search}} tree, is developed and analyzed. The {{binary search tree}} is a data structure for representing tables and lists so that accessing, inserting, and deleting items is easy. On an n-node <b>splay</b> tree, all the standard search tree operations have an amortized time bound of @log n) per operation, where by “amortized time” is meant the time per operation averaged over a worst-case sequence of operations. Thus <b>splay</b> trees are as efficient as balanced trees when total running time is the measure of interest. In addition, for sufficiently long access sequences, <b>splay</b> trees are as efficient, to within a constant factor, as static optimum search trees. The efficiency of <b>splay</b> trees comes not from an explicit structural constraint, as with balanced trees, but from applying a simple restructuring heuristic, called <b>splaying,</b> whenever the tree is accessed. Extensions of <b>splaying</b> give simplified forms of two other data structures: lexicographic or multidimensional search trees and link/ cut trees...|$|R

The hand is only known from recent discoveries and {{has not yet been}} described. In the rather wide pelvis, the ilium was straight in side view. Its front blade was rod-shaped and moderately <b>splayed</b> to the outside, creating room for the belly. This was reinforced by the sacral ribs becoming longer towards the front. The sacral ribs were wider at their attachment areas with the ilium, but were not fused into a sacral yoke. The pubis featured a short prepubis. The pubis shaft was straight, running parallel to a straight ischium shaft that was transversely flattened at its lower end. The thighbone was straight in side view, in front view it was somewhat bowed to the outside. Its head was not separated from the shaft by a real neck. While the major trochanter was at about the same level as the head, the lower minor trochanter was separated from both by a deep cleft. At it rear side, the femur mid-shaft featured a well-developed drooping fourth trochanter, a process for the attachment of the retractor tail muscle, the Musculus caudofemoralis longus. The lower leg was somewhat shorter than the thighbone. The tibia had a wide upper end, with a cnemial crest protruding well to the front. The tibia lower end was also robust and rotated about 70° compared to the upper part, turning the foot strongly to the outside. The foot was very large and wide. The fifth metatarsal was only rudimentary but the other four were robust. Scelidosaurus had four large toes, with the innermost digit being the smallest. The fourth metatarsal was short but its toe was long and built to be <b>splayed</b> to the outside of the foot, to improve the stability. The claws were flat, hoof-shaped and curved to the inside.|$|E
5|$|In the Roman Catholic Church, {{the most}} {{important}} steps towards an expressionist design were under taken by Gillespie, Kidd & Coia. This began with St Paul's Church in the new town of Glenrothes (1956–57). This was a wedge-shaped construction of white-painted common brick focused on a dramatic, jagged metal cross by the sculptor Benno Schotz. From about 1960, all Gillespie, Kidd & Coia's churches were designed in this Late Modernist style, as at St Bride's, East Kilbride (1963–64), which had a rectangular plan. From the mid-1960s, they adopted a centralised, non-rectangular plan, with seating ranged round the altar, reflecting liturgical change. Sacred Heart Church, Cumbernauld (1964), was rectangular, of load-bearing brick, dramatically lit through dark coloured windows. Our Lady of Good Counsel, Dennistoun (1965) had a <b>splayed</b> plan and slanted ceiling. St Benedict Drumchapel (1965–67) had a prow-like roof on curved, laminated timbers. These innovative designs inspired others to experiment, including J. McCarron's Our Lady of Sorrows, South Uist (1964–65). However, many of these designs proved too radical and were later demolished by the Catholic Church, citing structural or maintenance problems.|$|E
5|$|Like bryozoans and phoronids, brachiopods have a lophophore, a {{crown of}} tentacles whose cilia (fine hairs) create a water current {{that enables them to}} filter food {{particles}} out of the water. However a bryozoan or phoronid lophophore is a ring of tentacles mounted on a single, retracted stalk, while the basic form of the brachiopod lophophore is U-shaped, forming the brachia ("arms") from which the phylum gets its name. Brachiopod lophophores are non-retractable and occupy up to two-thirds of the internal space, in the frontmost area where the valves gape when opened. To provide enough filtering capacity in this restricted space, lophophores of larger brachiopods are folded in moderately to very complex shapes—loops and coils are common, and some species' lophophores resemble a hand with the fingers <b>splayed.</b> In all species the lophophore is supported by cartilage and by a hydrostatic skeleton (in other words by the pressure of its internal fluid), and the fluid extends into the tentacles. Some articulate brachiopods also have a brachidium, a calcareous support for the lophophore attached {{to the inside of the}} brachial valve.|$|E
5000|$|One {{study found}} that glucose {{reabsorption}} exhibited low <b>splay</b> and another {{also found that the}} titration curves for glycine showed a large amount of <b>splay</b> whereas those for lysine showed none and the kinetics of carrier-mediated glucose transport possibly explains the level of <b>splay</b> in renal titration curves. As <b>splay</b> can be clinically important, patients with proximal tubule disease, mainly caused by hereditary nature and often in children, have a lower threshold but a normal Tm. Therefore, <b>splay</b> is suggested, probably because [...] "some individual cotransporters have a low glucose affinity but maximal transport rate (renal glycosuria). Studies also show that if sulfate is reabsorbed by a Tm-limited process, it will have low <b>splay</b> and, in animals, the limits of citrate concentration normal in the body, citrate titration curves show a large amount of <b>splay</b> therefore a Tm for citrate reabsorption may actually happen. Also, tubular transport is Tm-limited and the reabsorption mechanism being saturated at a plasma concentration more than 20 times than usual shows a low level of <b>splay.</b> Renal abnormalities of glucose excretion, causing glycosuria, may happen as either a result of reduced Tm for glucose or because of an abnormally wide range of nephron heterogeneity so <b>splay</b> of the glucose excretion curve is increased.

40|$|In {{subduction}} zones, major thrusts called <b>splay</b> faults {{are thought}} to slip coseismically during large earthquakes affecting the main plate interface. We propose an analytical condition for the activation of a <b>splay</b> fault based on force balance calculations and suggest thrusting along the <b>splay</b> fault is generally conditioned by {{the growth of the}} accretionary wedge, or by the erosion of the hanging wall. In theory, normal slip on the <b>splay</b> fault may occur when the décollement has a very low friction coefficient seaward. Such a low friction also implies an unstable extensional state within the outer wedge. Finite element elasto-plastic calculations with a geometry based on the Nankai Kumano section were performed and confirm that this analytical condition is a valid approximation. Furthermore, localized extension at a shallow level in the <b>splay</b> hanging wall is observed in models {{for a wide range of}} friction coefficients (from ∼ 0 to the value of internal friction coefficient of the rock, here equals to 0. 4). The timing of slip established for the <b>splay</b> fault branch drilled on Nankai Kumano transect suggests a phase of concurrent <b>splay</b> and accretionary wedge growth ≈ 2 Ma to ≈ 1. 5 Ma, followed by a locking of the <b>splay</b> ≈ 1. 3 Ma. Active extension is observed in the hanging wall. This evolution can be explained by the activation of a deeper and weaker décollement, followed by an interruption of accretion. Activation of a <b>splay</b> as a normal fault, as hypothesized in the case of the Tohoku 2011 earthquake, can be achieved only if the friction coefficient on the décollement drops to near zero. We conclude that the tectonic stress state largely determines long-term variations of tightly related <b>splay</b> fault and outer décollement activity and thus influences where and how coseismic rupture ends, but that occurrence of normal slip on a <b>splay</b> fault requires coseismic friction reduction...|$|R

We used aerial photography and lithological cross-sections to reconstruct crevasse-splay formation in the largely unmanaged floodplain of the Saskatchewan River in the Cumberland Marshes (Saskatchewan, Canada). Based on surface geomorphology and subsurface deposits, various stages of crevasse-splay development were described which were linked to both external forcing and internal morphodynamics. Initial <b>splay</b> deposition, following a levee breach during a large flood, occurred as a broad but relatively thin sandy sheet in a down-basin direction in the receiving backswamp area.

This created an asymmetrical <b>splay</b> sequence composition, which differs in appearance from more commonly observed dendritic crevasse <b>splays.</b> It is concluded that sedimentation patterns in the <b>splay</b> have been influenced by inherited effects of previously formed deposits.
