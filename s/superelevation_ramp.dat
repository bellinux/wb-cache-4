40|$|The {{trend towards}} low-floor trams which {{appeared}} during the recent decades brought up {{a variety of different}} solutions in vehicle design. Usually the operators preferred the 100 % low-floor vehicles, paying particular respect to disabled passengers. These trams have a constant floor height of not more than 350 mm throughout the whole vehicle. An indispensable precondition for this is to abandon the wheelsets and the principle of placing the drive motors between the wheels. Thus all according vehicle designs have independent wheels instead of the previously used conventional wheelsets. Moreover, the 100 % low-floor design reduces drastically the maximal yaw angle of the bogies. In order to allow appropriate yaw movements within the vehicles, the carbodies had to be split into a number of articulated sections, with the motor and trailer bogies nearly fixed to them. In consequence the different drivetrain solutions became numerous. This thesis analyses and compares characteristic designs of multi-articulated trams that have been acquired by a large number of tram operators: the Combino and Variobahn design. In addition the 70 % low-floor, conventional motor bogie-based tram type Cologne is analysed, which has also been acquired in large numbers. The analyses were mainly performed by means of multibody simulation and were focused on• the running behaviour in tangent track,• the permissibility of the current track design regulations with regard to the derailment safety, and• the passenger comfort in curve entry transitions. For the latter analysis a general distinction was made between two design variants: on the one hand the curve entry for tracks within the street, without transition and <b>superelevation</b> <b>ramp,</b> {{and on the other hand}} the curve entry for autonomous tracks with curve transition and <b>superelevation</b> <b>ramp.</b> The results showed that the running behaviour in tangent track is satisfactory for all vehicles, and there is no increase in the derailment risk, either. However, the analyses showed also that each of the vehicles exceeds the jerk limits defined by the according VDV regulation. It could also be shown that there is an inadequacy in the regulation criterion for the comfort in curve transitions. The latest operational and biomechanical experience demonstrates that the main comfort criterion is not the jerk but rather the frequency of the lateral oscillations, the mean lateral acceleration – considered over a period of 2 s – and the product of the lateral acceleration in the curve at the moment of maximal jerk and the reaction time of the passengers. The consequences which are relevant for the running dynamics are:• The current track design regulations can be retained without exceptions, as long as the vehicle concept and the bogie design are appropriate. • The operators’ guidelines concerning door arrangement and vehicle capacity must not have negative influences on the running dynamics, the derailment safety and the comfort of passengers and staff. • When the choice of the curve radius is restricted by existing buildings then the track design parameters must be chosen in a way that the running safety is not endangered in any operational condition. • The definition of limit values for lateral acceleration, jerk and permissible human exposure to mechanical vibrations should be brought to a safe basis by means of multidisciplinary discussions with experts in medicine, biomechanics, physiology and vehicle design...|$|E
