In 1980, Alvarez, Alvarez, Asaro, and Michel published a seminal paper proposing an extraterrestrial cause for the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction (then called the Cretaceous-Tertiary extinction).

5|$|The crater was {{discovered}} by Antonio Camargo and Glen Penfield, geophysicists who {{had been looking for}} petroleum in the Yucatán during the late 1970s. Penfield was initially unable to obtain evidence that the geological feature was a crater and gave up his search. Later, through contact with Alan Hildebrand in 1990, Penfield obtained samples that suggested it was an impact feature. Evidence for the impact origin of the crater includes <b>shocked</b> <b>quartz,</b> a gravity anomaly, and tektites in surrounding areas.|$|E
5|$|This {{hypothesis}} {{was viewed as}} radical when first proposed, but additional evidence soon emerged. The boundary clay {{was found to be}} full of minute spherules of rock, crystallized from droplets of molten rock formed by the impact. <b>Shocked</b> <b>quartz</b> and other minerals were also identified in the K–Pg boundary. Shocked minerals have their internal structure deformed, and are created by intense pressures such as those associated with nuclear blasts or meteorite impacts. The identification of giant tsunami beds along the Gulf Coast and the Caribbean also provided evidence for impact, and suggested that the impact may have occurred nearby—as did the discovery that the K–Pg boundary became thicker in the southern United States, with meter-thick beds of debris occurring in northern New Mexico.|$|E

40|$|Quartz grains {{displaying}} multiple sets of planar {{features are}} described from numerous Cretaceous-Tertiary (K-T) boundary clays and claystones at both marine and nonmarine depositional {{sites around the}} world. All these sites also show anomalously high amounts of iridium and enrichments of other siderophile elements in cosmic ratios within these boundary units. This combination of mineralogical and geochemical features are used in support of an impact hypothesis for the end-Cretaceous event. Recently, {{it was suggested that}} some combination of explosive and nonexplosive volcanism associated with the formation of the Deccan traps in India could be responsible for the mineralogy and geochemistry seen in the K-T boundary units. Besides the obvious contradition of simultaneous explosive and nonexplosive volcanism from one locality during an instant of geologic time, there remains the difficulty of spreading both iridium (and trace elements in cosmic proportions) and quartz grains around the world by volcanic (atmospheric) transport. In addition, the ability of volcanism to produce the type of shock metamorphism seen in minerals at the K-T boundary was not demonstrated. Multiple sets of <b>shock</b> lamellae in <b>quartz</b> are considered characteristic of shock metamorphism in rocks at the sites of known impact craters and are the type of deformation seen in quartz from K-T boundary clays and claystones. Single sets of poorly defined lamellae described from rare quartz grains in certain volcanic deposits are characteristic of tectonic deformation and do not correspond to the <b>shock</b> lamellae in <b>quartz</b> from K-T sediments and impact structures. So-called <b>shock</b> mosaicism in <b>quartz</b> and feldspar grains described from volcanic deposits can result from many processes other than shock metamorphism, and therefore is not considered to be an effect characteristic solely of shock. The mineralogy of shock-metamorphosed grains at the K-T boundary also argues against a volcanic origin...|$|R
5|$|At {{the same}} time, in 1980, {{geologist}} Walter Alvarez and his father, Nobel Prize-winning scientist Luis Walter Alvarez, put forth his hypothesis {{that a large}} extraterrestrial body had struck Earth. In 1981, unaware of Penfield's discovery, University of Arizona graduate student Alan R. Hildebrand and faculty adviser William V. Boynton published a draft Earth-impact theory and sought a candidate crater. Their evidence included greenish-brown clay with surplus iridium containing <b>shocked</b> <b>quartz</b> grains and small weathered glass beads that looked to be tektites. Thick, jumbled deposits of coarse rock fragments were also present, {{thought to have been}} scoured from one place and deposited elsewhere by a megatsunami resulting from an Earth impact. Such deposits occur in many locations but seem concentrated in the Caribbean basin at the K–Pg boundary. So when Haitian professor Florentine Morás discovered what he thought to be evidence of an ancient volcano on Haiti, Hildebrand suggested it could be a telltale feature of a nearby impact. Tests on samples retrieved from the K–Pg boundary revealed more tektite glass, formed only in the heat of asteroid impacts and high-yield nuclear detonations.|$|E

25|$|The {{concept of}} impact {{cratering}} remained {{more or less}} speculative until the 1960s. At that time a number of researchers, most notably Eugene Shoemaker, (co-discoverer of the comet Shoemaker-Levy 9), conducted detailed studies {{of a number of}} craters and recognized clear evidence that they had been created by impacts, specifically identifying the shock-metamorphic effects uniquely associated with impact events, of which the most familiar is <b>shocked</b> <b>quartz.</b>|$|E

Our NMR results differ substantially from those of Cygan and others and suggest that the proposed shock wave barometer may require refinement.

Results of TEM examinations indicate that no change in dislocation density was caused by shock loading except in regions containing shock lamellae, where the dislocation density was lowered. The shock-induced defects tend to nucleate on and be controlled by preexisting stress concentrators; shock lamellae, glassy veins, and most curviplanar defects form in tension, presumably during release.

Observations from 31 wells spanning 400, 000 km 2 of the basin provide compelling evidence for the presence of a marine impact horizon of regional extent. Drill core was examined to determine the sedimentary context of the Tookoonooka impact event, the presence of ejecta, {{and the nature of the}} impact horizon. The base of the Wyandra Sandstone Member of the Cadna-owie Formation is an unconformity commonly overlain by very poorly sorted sediment with imbricated pebbles, exotic clasts, and occasional boulders. The basal Wyandra Sandstone Member is bimodal: a fine sand mode reflects an ambient sediment contribution and a coarse mode is interpreted to be impact-derived. Wells Thargomindah- 1 and Eromanga- 1, within four crater radii of Tookoonooka, contain distinctive clastsupported breccia-conglomerate beds at the base of the Wyandra Sandstone Member. Clasts in these beds include altered accretionary and melt impactoclasts, as well as lithic and mineral grains corresponding to the Tookoonooka target rock sequence, including basement. Petrographic evidence includes <b>shock</b> metamorphosed <b>quartz</b> and lithic grains with planar deformation features. These breccia-conglomerates are in stark contrast to the underlying, laterally persistent, unimodal Cadna-owie sediments and overlying shales deposited in an epeiric sea.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{detailed}} and quantitative {{examination of the}} thermodynamics and phase change mechanisms (including amorphization) that occur upon shock wave loading and unloading of silica. We apply Debye-Grüneisen theory to calculate both the Hugoniot of quartz and isentropic release paths. Quartz converts to stishovite (or a stishovite-like phase) between 15 and 46 GPa, and persistence of the solid phase above its liquidus (i. e., superheating) is confirmed between 77 and 110 GPa. Calculations compare favorably to measurements of shock and post-shock temperatures. For silica, the method of measuring post-shock temperature is insensitive to predicting whether phase transitions actually occur during release. Measurements of release states in pressure-particle velocity space are compared to computed frozen-phase release paths. This comparison suggests transformation of a stishovite-like phase to lower density phases including quartz, liquid, or dense amorphous glass. Transformations to liquid or glass occur upon release from peak pressure of 26 GPa and above. The isentropic release assumption appears to be approximately valid. A shock pressure-temperature scale relating metamorphism of silica in shock-loaded quartz is proposed. Neither recovery of coesite nor substantial quantities of crystalline stishovite-like phases upon <b>shock</b> loading of <b>quartz</b> is predicted.

40|$|Quartz is {{the most}} common mineral of {{terrestrial}} crustal rocks and thus a widespread indicator for impact cratering and associated shock metamorphism. Planar deformation features (PDFs) are among the most prominent and diagnostic <b>shock</b> features in <b>quartz</b> and they represent thin lamellae of glass that formed via solid-state transformations. This socalled 'diaplectic' glass becomes pervasive at higher pressures and results in optically isotropic and X-ray-amorphous phases that resemble texturally the original quartz grains (without evidence of melt flow).

The conspicuous, essentially static hornfels metamorphism, which affected the unconformably overlying Witwatersrand sediments in the collar 2 b. y. ago with temperatures up to 550 - 600 °C, can be followed into the basement with increasing grade towards the centre of the Dome, where temperatures around 900 °C were attained.

The crater {{is defined by}} 110 on and gas test wells, has a rim to rim diameter of 6. 2 km, an overall dimensional diameter of 8. 5 km and consists of a central dome, an annular depression, and an encircling anticlinal rim. Due to the severity of subsurface disruption observed at the Calvin structure the Michigan Geological Survey considers it the most anomalous and enigmatic subsurface geologic feature in the Michigan Basin. This study models the gross morphology of the subsurface Calvin structure using multiple tools and compares the results to known impact craters. The data presented show that consistent structural and physical analogs exist between the subsurface Calvin structure and known or suspected impact craters. Combined results of seismic, gravity, magnetic, and resistivity data, suggest the Calvin structure's morphology results in structural patterns {{similar to those of}} recognized impact craters in sedimentary targets. The Calvin structure Abstract approved: exhibits recognized relationships between stratigraphic displacement and structural diameters observed in impact craters. During microscopic investigations of sample cuttings from wells in close proximity to the Calvin structure a collection of metallic microspherules were recovered.

No microspherules of similar composition have been reported from other occurrences of later geologic ages. A strong body of circumstantial evidence links these stratigraphically isochronous microspherules with the formation of the Calvin structure.

40|$|The Earth is {{the most}} endogenically active of the {{terrestrial}} planets and, thus, has retained the poorest sample of impacts that have occurred throughout geological time. The current known sample consists of approximately 160 impact structures or crater fields. Approximately 30 % of known impact structures are buried and were initially detected as geophysical anomalies and subsequently drilled to provide geologic samples. The recognition of terrestrial impact structures may, or may not, come from the discovery of an anomalous quasi-circular topographic, geologic or geophysical feature. In the geologically active terrestrial environment, anomalous quasi-circular features, however, do not automatically equate with an impact origin. Specific samples must be acquired and the occurrence of shock metamorphism, or, {{in the case of}} small craters, meteoritic fragments, must be demonstrated before an impact origin can be confirmed. Shock metamorphism is defined by a progressive destruction of the original rock and mineral structure with increasing shock pressure. Peak shock pressures and temperatures produced by an impact event may reach several hundreds of gigaPascals and several thousand degrees Kelvin, which are far outside the range of endogenic metamorphism. In addition, the application of shockwave pressures is both sudden and brief. Shock metamorphic effects result from high strain rates, well above the rates of normal tectonic processes.
