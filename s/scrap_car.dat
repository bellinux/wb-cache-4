40|$|Introduction Disassembly of {{automobiles}} prior to recycling {{has been an}} important issue for the automotive industry due to increasing environmental constraints from legislation and consumers. Since most recycling processes for complex products require disassembly of the product, automation of the disassembly process is an important challenge. An explosion of costs arising from the disposal of remains can be avoided and high-quality raw materials can be reused for production. At the Fraunhofer-Institute for Manufacturing Engineering and Automation (IPA) a disassembly strategy for <b>scrap</b> <b>cars</b> has been developed to reduce car shredder waste by increasing the disassembly depth. The strategy is based upon the integration of automation in the disassembly process using industrial robots for stripping of the automobile. For the investigation of major disassembly operations a flexible disassembly test bed for all <b>scrap</b> <b>cars</b> is being developed. This paper will present the first experimental result s in automated disassembly of <b>scrap</b> <b>cars</b> with industrial robots...|$|R

50|$|In 1986, slit rolling was {{introduced}} to Hadeed's Rolling Mills, increasing the daily production record by more than 21%. In 1987, a <b>scrap</b> <b>car</b> shredder plant was commissioned. With a capacity of 50 tonnes per hour, it shreds cars into pieces small enough to be charged into the electric arc furnaces. In 1988, Hadeed introduced a new technology (Bar Quenching) to its rolling mills in Jubail for the manufacture of concrete reinforcing bars. This process involves high pressure surface quenching followed by self-tempering. As the bar emerges from the last rolling stand, the surface temperature is rapidly reduced by high pressure water jets. This action causes change in the microstructure of the steel, making it harder and stronger. Subsequently the heat retained in the core dissipates out and heats the surface to around 620 °C causing another change in the microstructure, which improves the ductility and toughness of the bar. This process can meet increasing demands from structural engineers for higher yield strength combined with good ductility and weldability in reinforcing steel to reduce construction costs.|$|E

Most of the technology in game is based on that used by humans during WW2, although there are a few exceptions (e.g. velociraptors, mammoths, lasers, swords, railguns, etc.). The game seems to lack logic in various areas, allowing players to grow crops in 5 minutes while in real life crops take months to grow, as well as a man with a pistol hiding behind a <b>scrap</b> <b>car</b> door being more dangerous than an imperial soldier with a shotgun and military grade steel shield.|$|E
50|$|Business Area Smelters refines both metal {{concentrate}} and secondary materials to produce base and precious metals at smelters in Sweden, Finland and Norway. The main metals are zinc and copper but {{the production of}} lead, gold and silver also makes a substantial contribution to the Business Area’s revenues. Other products include sulphuric acid and aluminium fluoride. Boliden owns and operates two zinc and two copper smelters and one lead smelter. The Kokkola zinc smelter in Finland is the second largest in Europe and the fifth largest in the world, and mainly produces an alloy used in the galvanising of thin sheet metal. The Odda zinc smelter, which produces zinc for the steel industry and aluminium fluoride for Norway’s aluminium industry, {{is located on the}} west coast of Norway. The Rönnskär copper smelter is located in the Swedish town of Skelleftehamn and its main products are copper, zinc clinker, lead and precious metals. The smelter, which produces sulphuric acid as a by-product of its operations, also produces metals from electronic scrap and other secondary materials. The Harjavalta copper smelter, located on the west coast of Finland, produces copper cathodes that are mainly sold to manufacturers of semi-finished goods. Other important products include gold, silver and sulphuric acid. The Bergsöe lead smelter outside Landskrona in southern Sweden extracts lead from <b>scrap</b> <b>car</b> batteries. Bergsöe is one of Europe’s four biggest players in the lead recycling industry. Approximately 60 per cent of the plant’s lead production is sold to the European battery industry, with the remainder used in the manufacture of roofing sheet.|$|E

40|$|Traffic {{congestion}} is {{a critical}} and highly visible urban problem. In land scarce Singapore, the problem is even more crucial {{and the government has}} resorted to gargantuan measures not only to curb car use but also car ownership. Besides a plethora of road-use taxes, a unique tax structure on car ownership is employed that comprises hefty taxes on new car purchases plus provisions for tax discounts if new car purchases are accompanied by the scrappage of old cars. Consequently, a thriving <b>scrap</b> <b>car</b> market has evolved in which <b>scrap</b> <b>car</b> prices exceed even new car prices in some other countries. This paper constructs a theoretical model to explain the determination of the equilibrium <b>scrap</b> <b>car</b> prices. The equilibrium properties are subject to empirical tests.

40|$|The {{effect of}} carbon dioxide partial {{pressure}} and fluidization velocity on activated carbons produced by carbon dioxide activation of <b>scrap</b> <b>car</b> tyre rubber in a fluidized bed has been studied. The method consisted of carbonization at 700 C under nitrogen followed by activation at 900 C. Three types of activated carbons were produced using activated gas concentrations of 20, 60 and 100 % carbon dioxide by volume, the rest nitrogen, at a constant fluidization velocity (0. 0393 m/s) to investigate the influence {{of carbon dioxide}} partial pressure. Within the experimental setup and activation time of 4 h, {{it was observed that}} BET surface area and total pore volume increased with carbon dioxide partial pressure reaching 732. 80 m / g and 1. 1030 cm / g, respectively, for 100 % activation with carbon dioxide. Three other types of activated carbons were produced using 100 % carbon dioxide at two (0. 0393 m/s), three (0. 0589 m/s) and four (0. 0786 m/s) times the minimum fluidization velocity (U). The BET surface area and total pore volume were observed to increase with fluidization velocity (which can be viewed as an indicator of the intensity of mixing in the bed), reaching 1011 m / g and 1. 5620 cm / g, respectively, at four times the minimum fluidization velocity...|$|E
50|$|In all, 436,000 Montegos {{were sold}} in the UK between 1984 and 1995. In August 2006, a survey by Auto Express {{revealed}} that the Montego was Britain's eighth-most <b>scrapped</b> <b>car,</b> with just 8,988 still in working order. Contributing to this, areas of the bodywork that were to be covered by plastic trim (such as {{the front and rear}} bumpers) were left unpainted and thus unprotected. In addition, pre-1989 models fitted with the A and S-series engines cannot run on unleaded petrol without the cylinder head being converted or needing fuel additives. This led to many owners simply <b>scrapping</b> the <b>cars,</b> as leaded petrol was removed from sale in Britain after 1999, and by 2003 most petrol stations had stopped selling LRP (lead replacement petrol) due to the falling demand for it.|$|R

30|$|Besides {{the issues}} of {{outdated}} vehicle technology in India, there are other issues (behavioral and psychological issues) such {{as a lack of}} environmental conviction in the Indian car consumers that leads to higher traffic emissions [46 – 48]. They often dump old tires, battery or even <b>scrap</b> <b>car.</b> Irrespective {{of a large number of}} consumers who are conscious about the environment, very few people are actually willing to adapt their lifestyle in order to solve the issues such as deteriorating air quality. There is a very negligible percentage of people who actually push themselves out of their comfort zone by acting at their personal expenses, such as paying premiums for environmentally friendly products and making a sacrifice in their present lifestyles. Therefore, there is a need of behavioral changes at personal level which includes - (i) raising public awareness to prefer public transportation to using personal vehicles; (ii) living near the workplace rather than commuting a long distance to workplace every day; (iii) car pool; and (iv) commuting to workplace with bicycles. The increasing use of public transportation would mean fewer vehicles on the road, which means less emission and less negative effects on climate and health [49]. Hence, there is not a single effective tool to mitigate transport sector emissions. Taken together, we propose that in order to assure effective environmental protection, psychological as well as technological measures need to be in place.|$|E
40|$|The one horse-power machine {{shown in}} the picture was {{constructed}} with hand tools by staff and students of the Development Technology Unit of Warwick University, I UK. It consists of easily-worked mild steel and wood. The University researchers, aware of the desperate need for shaft power in developing countries, have updated the horse-gin, which {{was used in the}} UK until about 1920 for threshing grain, milling flour and many other agricultural jobs. In this new machine a <b>scrap</b> <b>car</b> wheel rolls around a circular track, guided by a wooden boom. The draught animal, which could be an oxen, horse, mule or even a camel, pulls the boom and wheel around. Power from the car wheel is taken by a shaft to the centre of the machine, then around several corners and finally out through another shaft, (which here powers the pump). If power is needed outside the circle, the shaft may be extended to go under the animal's track, in a duct or bridge. The new feature of this machine, which makes it cheaper and easier to make, is that power is taken through two right angles using universal or Hooke joints, instead of gears. This makes the machine tolerant of poor manufacturing standards and cuts out most of the expensive and difficult-to-make parts.

40|$|Vehicle {{longevity}} and survival {{are important to}} forecast total fleets and to estimate related greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Despite today’s abundant literature, the major issue of the estimated survival rate of vehicles {{as a tool for}} vehicle and emissions forecasts is still an open question largely because of no data on <b>scrapped</b> <b>cars.</b> To secure an overview of car longevity, we applied a biometric approach by building Kaplan-Meier survival curves. Our database covers 265 vehicles scrapped or sold for spare parts in France in August 2010. The information includes make, model, version, cylinder capacity, fiscal horsepower, fuel (diesel/gasoline), date of registration, date of scrapping and odometer reading. Using the age in total months and final odometer readings of <b>scrapped</b> <b>cars,</b> we applied the Kaplan-Meier estimator to obtain survival rates by age and total mileage. The distinction between these two dimensions is useful to separate longevity by age (lifetime) from longevity by total mileage (design life). We found longer lifetime for gasoline cars but higher design life for diesel cars. The results give a median lifetime of 126 months (10 y 6 m) years for the dataset, i. e. 149 months (12 y 5 m) for gasoline cars and 118 months (9 y 10 m) for diesel. Moreover, results give a median design life of 150, 000 km (94, 000 miles) for the dataset, i. e. 135, 479 km (84, 674 miles) for gasoline cars and 152, 730 km (95, 456 miles) for diesel.
