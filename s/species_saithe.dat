40|$|Abstract Expression and {{processing}} of mitochondrial gene transcripts are fundamental to mitochondrial function, but information from early vertebrates like teleost fishes is essentially lacking. We have analyzed mitogenome sequences of ten codfishes (family Gadidae), and provide complete sequences from three new <b>species</b> (<b>Saithe,</b> Pollack and Blue whiting). Characterization of the mito-chondrial mRNAs in Saithe and Atlantic cod identified {{a set of}} ten poly(A) transcripts, and six UAA stop codons are generated by posttranscriptional polyadenylation. Struc-tural assessment of poly(A) sites is consistent with an RNaseP cleavage activity 50 of tRNA acceptor-like stems. COI, ND 5 and ND 6 mRNAs were found to harbor 30 UTRs with antisense potential extending into neighboring gene regions. While the 30 UTR of COI mRNA is complemen-tary to the tRNASer (UCN) and highly similar to that detected in human mitochondria, the ND 5 and ND 6 30 UTRs appear more heterogenic. Deep sequencing confirms expression of all mitochondrial mRNAs and rRNAs, and provides information about the precise 50 ends in mature transcripts. Our study supports an overall evolutionary conservation in mitochondrial RNA processing events among vertebrates, but reveals some unique 50 and 30 end characteristics in codfish mRNAs with implications to antisense regulation of gene expression...|$|E

40|$|Since 1978 {{large numbers}} of harp seals (Phoca groenlandica) have invaded areas of North Norway in winter and spring. In 1987 and 1988 {{dramatic}} increases occurred both in magnitude and geographic extent of these seal invasions, and {{it is suggested that}} the collapse of the Barents Sea capelin stock in 1985 / 1986 may have been a contributory factor to this. Sampling of stomach contents for food analyses and of teeth for age determinations was carried out from harp seals taken as bycatch in Norwegian gill-net fisheries in 1986 and 1988. It appears that the seal herds comprised both immature and mature animals. The stomach analyses suggested that feeding was opportunistic, with a variety of fish (in particular the gadoid <b>species</b> cod, <b>saithe,</b> haddock and Norway pout, and the pelagic shoaling species herring and capelin) being taken as prey. Prawns and squid were also consumed, but in considerably lower quantities than fish...|$|R
40|$|The {{fish fauna}} in the sublittoral habitat of Masfjorden, western Norway, {{has been studied}} in order to reveal {{survival}} and growth prospects of released juvenile cod in a large-scale stock enhancement experiment. Seasonal changes in abundance of dominating fish species and in the diet of potential competitors and predators to juvenile cod were emphasized. A total of 44 species from 17 families of Teleostei and 4 families of Chondrichthyes were recorded at 5 - 20 m depth of the sublittoral of Masfjorden. Gadids were dominating (50. 2 % by numbers, 10 <b>species)</b> and <b>saithe</b> (Pollachius virens), pollack (P. pollachius), poor-cod (Trisopterus minutus) and cod (Gadus morhua) were most numerous. Labrids form a second dominating family (44. 7 % by numbers, 5 species) of which Centrolabrus exoletus, Ctenolabrus rupestris, Labrus bimaculatus and L. bergylta were the most abundant. Pollack and saithe had highest abundance during summer and autumn. The labrids and poor-cod had maximum abundance in summer. All labrids, pollack and saithe showed minimum abundance in winter while poor-cod had lowest abundance in spring and highest in summer. Dietary studies showed that gobies {{were one of the}} major preys for small individuals of cod, pollack, saithe and poor-cod in the summer and autumn. Gadids and labrids were important prey for large cod and pollack...|$|R
40|$|The North Sea has {{a diverse}} forage fish assemblage, {{including}} herring, targeted for human consumption; sandeel, sprat, and Norway pout, exploited by industrial fisheries; and some sardine and anchovy, supporting small-scale fisheries. All show large abundance fluctuations, impacting on fisheries and predators. We review field, laboratory, and modelling studies {{to investigate the}} drivers of this complex system of forage fish. Climate clearly influences forage fish productivity; however, any single-species considerations {{of the influence of}} climate might fail if strong interactions between forage fish exist, as in the North Sea. Sandeel appears {{to be the most important}} prey forage fish. Seabirds are most dependent on forage fish, due to specialized diet and distributional constraints (breeding colonies). Other than fisheries, key predators of forage fish are a few piscivorous fish <b>species</b> including <b>saithe,</b> whiting, mackerel, and horse-mackerel, exploited in turn by fisheries; seabirds and seals have a more modest impact. Size-based foodweb modelling suggests that reducing fishing mortality may not necessarily lead to larger stocks of piscivorous fish, especially if their early life stages compete with forage fish for zooplankton resources. In complex systems, changes in the impact of fisheries on forage fish may have potentially complex (and perhaps unanticipated) consequences on other commercially and/or ecologically important species. © 2013 © Crown copyright...|$|R
40|$|Data {{on energy}} requirements, diet composition, and stock size were {{combined}} {{to estimate the}} con-sumption of various prey species by minke whales (Balaenoptera aeutorostrata) in Northeast Atlantic waters. In the period 1992 - 1995, the stock of 85, 000 minke whales appeared to have consumed more than 1. 8 million tonnes of prey per year in coastal waters off northern Norway, in the Barents Sea and around Spitsbergen during an assumed 6 month stay between mid-April and mid-October. Uncertainties in stock estimates suggest a 95 % confidence range of 1. 4 - 2. 1 million tonnes. The point estimate was composed of 602, 000 tonnes of krill Thysanoessa spp., 633, 000 tonnes of herring Clupea harengus, 142, 000 tonnes of capelin Mallotus villosus, 256, 000 tonnes of cod Gadus morhua, 128, 000 tonnes of haddock Melanogrammus aeglefinus and 54, 500 tonnes of other fish <b>species,</b> including <b>saithe</b> Pollaehius virens and sand eel Ammodytes sp. Consumption of various prey items by minke whales may represent an important mortality factor {{for some of the}} species. For example, the estimated annual consumption of herring corresponds to about 70 % of the herring fisheries in the Northeast Atlantic in 1995. Minke whale diets are subject to year-to-year variations due to changes in the resource base in different feeding areas. Thus, the regional distribution of consumption of dif-ferent prey items is highly dynamic...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to improve the precision of stock assessments of demersal fish in Icelandic waters, with particular emphasis on cod. Sampling was carried out on approximately 600 stations in the Iceland shelf area in March 1985 and again in March 1986. Stations were distributed in the survey area through a semi-randomly stratified process. A stand-ardized bottom trawl was designed for the sampling and the data collected included length measurements, otolith samples and sex determination, as well as information onthe environment and fishing gear. Results are presented for cod, haddock, saithe, redfish, catfish and long rough dab. The distributions of the different species indicate common nursery grounds in the northern part of the survey area. The youngest age-groups were generally not fully represented in the survey. Pro-nounced diurnal catch variations were observed for catfish and redfish. Age disaggregated stock indices of the gadoid species are well correlated with virtual popula-tion analysis (VPA) values. However, the total stock indices differ in their proportion of the VPA stock size. In comparison with previous surveys, the precision of stock indices has been increased markedly through this survey for all <b>species</b> except <b>saithe.</b> This is basically the result of an increased number of stations. Skipper-selected stations (non-random) generally gave higher aggregated indices than random ones, although statistically significant differences are excep-tional. On a length disaggregated basis, however, a highly significant difference was observed for all species...|$|R
40|$|The {{sensitiveness}} {{of different}} demersal and pelagic fish species of 70 hauls in the North and Baltic Sea in water depths of 60 to 250 m and 15 to 80 m, respectively, amount of catch of 100 to 3500 kg and trawling times of 0, 5 to 6 h on {{board of the}} FRV “Walther Herwig III” was investigated. Some demersal fish <b>species,</b> e. g. <b>saithe</b> (Pollachius virens), were even still sensitive, when caught at a water depth of 250 m at a trawling time of 1, 5 h. Generally the number of sensitive fishes was reduced with increasing water depth, amount of catch, trawling time and following storage of the catch on board. Among demersal fishes the species without swimbladder and flat fishes were clearly more resistent to mechanical stress. On the contrary, pelagic fish species were generally less robust. After trawling times of 2 h no sensitive animals were observed. In some fisheries there are mixed catches of demersal and pelagic fish species with different sensitiveness. In commercial fisheries, there is therefore – under animal welfare aspects – for the time being, no prospect for an improvement of the catching and slaughtering procedure on boar...|$|R
40|$|Understanding {{the role}} of marine mammals in {{specific}} ecosystems and their interactions with fisheries involves, inter alia, an understanding of their diet and dietary requirements. In this thesis, the foraging ecology of seven marine mammal species that regularly occur in Irish waters was investigated by reconstructing diet using hard parts from digestive tracts and scats. Of the species examined, two (striped and Atlantic white-sided dolphin) can be considered offshore species or species inhabiting neritic waters, while five others usually inhabit more coastal areas (white-beaked dolphin, harbour porpoise, harbour seal and grey seal); the last species studied was the bottlenose dolphin whose population structure is more complex, with coastal and offshore populations. A total of 13, 028 prey items from at least 81 different species (62 fish species, 14 cephalopods, four crustaceans, and a tunicate) were identified. 28 % of the fish species were identified using bones other than otoliths, highlighting the importance of using all identifiable structures to reconstruct diet. Individually, each species of marine mammal presented a high diversity of prey taxa, but the locally abundant Trisopterus spp. {{were found to be}} the most important prey item for all species, indicating that Trisopterus spp. is probably a key species in understanding {{the role of}} these predators in Irish waters. In the coastal marine mammals, other Gadiformes <b>species</b> (haddock, pollack, <b>saithe,</b> whiting) also contributed substantially to the diet; in contrast, in pelagic or less coastal marine mammals, prey was largely comprised of planktivorous fish, such as Atlantic mackerel, horse mackerel, blue whiting, and mesopelagic prey. Striped dolphins and Atlantic white-sided dolphins are offshore small cetaceans foraging in neritic waters. Differences between the diet of striped dolphins collected in drift nets targeting tuna and stranded on Irish coasts showed a complex foraging behaviour; the diet information shows that although this dolphin forages mainly in oceanic waters it may occasionally forage on the continental shelf, feeding on available prey. The Atlantic white-sided dolphin diet showed that this species prefers to feed over the continental edge, where planktivorous fish are abundant. Some resource partitioning was found in bottlenose dolphins in Irish waters consistent with previous genetic and stable isotope analysis studies. Bottlenose dolphins in Irish waters appears to be generalist feeders consuming more than 30 prey species, however most of the diet comprised a few locally abundant species, especially gadoid fish including haddock/pollack/saithe group and Trisopterus spp., but the contribution of Atlantic hake, conger eels and the pelagic planktivorous horse mackerel were also important. Stomach content information suggests that three different feeding behaviours might occur in bottlenose dolphin populations in Irish waters; firstly a coastal behaviour, with animals feeding on prey that mainly inhabit areas close to the coast; secondly an offshore behaviour where dolphins feed on offshore species such as squid or mesopelagic fish; and a third more complex behaviour that involves movements over the continental shelf and close to the shelf edge. The other three coastal marine mammal species (harbour porpoise, harbour seal and grey seal) were found to be feeding on similar prey and competition for food resources among these sympatric species might occur. Both species of seals were found to have a high overlap (more than 80 %) in their diet composition, but while grey seals feed on large fish (> 110 mm), harbour seals feed mostly on smaller fish (< 110 mm), suggesting some spatial segregation in foraging. Harbour porpoises and grey seals are potentially competing for the same food resource but some differences in prey species were found and some habitat partitioning might occur. Direct interaction (by catch) between dolphins and fisheries was detected in all species. Most of the prey found in the stomach contents from both stranded and by catch dolphins were smaller sizes than those targeted by commercial fisheries. In fact, the total annual food consumption of the species studied was found to be very small (225, 160 tonnes) in comparison to fishery landings for the same area (~ 2 million tonnes). However, marine mammal species might be indirectly interacting with fisheries, removing forage fish. Incorporating the dietary information obtained from the four coastal species, an ECOPATH food web model was established for the Irish Sea, based on data from 2004. Five trophic levels were found, with bottlenose dolphins and grey and harbour seals occurring at the highest trophic level. A comparison with a previous model based on 1973 data suggests that while the overall Irish Sea ecosystem appears to be “maturing”, some indices indicate that the 2004 fishery was less efficient and was targeting fish at higher trophic levels than in 1973, which is reflected in the mean trophic level of the catch. Depletion or substantial decrease of some of the Irish Sea fish stocks has resulted in a significant decline in landings in this area. The integration of diet information in mass-balance models to construct ecosystem food-webs will help to understand the trophic role of these apex predators within the ecosystem...|$|R
