50|$|Neurons whose cell bodies {{lie in the}} <b>spiral</b> <b>ganglion</b> are strung {{along the}} bony core of the cochlea, and send fibers (axons) into {{the central nervous system}} (CNS).

Their dendrites make synaptic contact with the base of hair cells, and their axons are bundled together to form the auditory portion of eighth cranial nerve.

50|$|The cell {{bodies of}} the {{cochlear}} nerve lie within the cochlea and collectively form the <b>spiral</b> <b>ganglion,</b> named for the spiral shape it shares with the cochlea. These central axons exit the cochlea at its base and form a nerve trunk, which, in humans, is approximately one inch long. This travels in parallel with the vestibular nerves through the internal auditory canal, through which it connects to the brainstem. There, its fibers synapse with the cell {{bodies of the}} cochlear nucleus.|$|E
50|$|In one 1997 {{study of}} white cats {{with varying degrees}} of hearing deficiency, 72% of the animals were found to be totally deaf. The entire organ of Corti was found to have {{degenerated}} within the first few weeks after birth; however, even during these weeks no brain stem responses could be evoked by auditory stimuli, suggesting that these animals had never experienced any auditory sensations. It was found that some months after the organ of Corti had degenerated, the <b>spiral</b> <b>ganglion</b> also began to degenerate.|$|E

By RNA in-situ hybridization, Sobp expression in neonatal tissue was demonstrated in <b>spiral</b> <b>ganglion,</b> the sensory and supporting cells of the maculae of saccule and maculae of utricle, and cristae ampullaris. Sobp is also expressed in the inner nuclear layer of the developing retina at E15, the olfactory epithelium, in neurons of the trigeminal ganglion and in cells surrounding the dermal papillae of hair follicles.|$|E
50|$|The major {{input to}} the {{cochlear}} nucleus {{is from the}} auditory nerve, a part of cranial nerve VIII (the vestibulocochlear nerve). The auditory nerve fibers form a highly organized system of connections according to their peripheral innervation of the cochlea. Axons from the <b>spiral</b> <b>ganglion</b> cells of the lower frequencies innervate the ventrolateral portions of the ventral cochlear nucleus and lateral-ventral portions of the dorsal cochlear nucleus. The axons from the higher frequency organ of corti hair cells project to the dorsal portion of the ventral cochlear nucleus and the dorsal-medial portions of the dorsal cochlear nucleus. The mid frequency projections end up in between the two extremes; {{in this way the}} tonotopic organization that is established in the cochlea is preserved in the cochlear nuclei. This tonotopic organization is preserved because only a few inner hair cells synapse on the dendrites of a nerve cell in the <b>spiral</b> <b>ganglion,</b> and the axon from that nerve cell synapses on only a very few dendrites in the cochlear nucleus. In contrast with the VCN that receives all acoustic input from the auditory nerve, the DCN receives input not only from the auditory nerve but it also receives acoustic input from neurons in the VCN (T stellate cells). The DCN is therefore in a sense a second order sensory nucleus.|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} in more detail the specific functions of the cochlear nuclei {{it is first necessary}} to understand the way sound information is represented by the fibers of the auditory nerve. Briefly, there are around 30,000 auditory nerve fibres in each of the two auditory nerves. Each fiber is an axon of a <b>spiral</b> <b>ganglion</b> cell that represents a particular frequency of sound, and a particular range of loudness. Information in each nerve fibre is represented by the rate of action potentials as well as the particular timing of individual action potentials. The particular physiology and morphology of each cochlear nucleus cell type enhances different aspects of sound information.|$|E
50|$|The perilymph in the {{vestibular}} duct and the endolymph in {{the cochlear}} duct act mechanically {{as a single}} duct, being kept apart only by the very thin Reissner's membrane.The vibrations of the endolymph in the cochlear duct displace the basilar membrane in a pattern that peaks {{a distance from the}} oval window depending upon the soundwave frequency.

50|$|Sound is {{the perceptual}} result of {{mechanical}} vibrations traveling through a medium such as air or water. Through {{the mechanisms of}} compression and rarefaction, sound waves travel through the air, bounce off the pinna and concha of the exterior ear, and enter the ear canal. The sound waves vibrate the tympanic membrane (ear drum), causing the three bones {{of the middle ear}} to vibrate, which then sends the energy through the oval window and into the cochlea where it is changed into a chemical signal by hair cells in the organ of corti, which synapse onto <b>spiral</b> <b>ganglion</b> fibers that travel through the cochlear nerve into the brain.|$|E

50|$|In the {{developing}} auditory system, developing cochlea generate bursts of activity which spreads across the inner hair cells and <b>spiral</b> <b>ganglion</b> neurons which relay auditory {{information to the}} brain. ATP release from supporting cells triggers action potentials in inner hair cells. In the auditory system, spontaneous activity {{is thought to be}} involved in tonotopic map formation by segregating cochlear neuron axons tuned to high and low frequencies. In the motor system, periodic bursts of spontaneous activity are driven by excitatory GABA and glutamate during the early stages and by acetylcholine and glutamate at later stages. In {{the developing}} zebrafish spinal cord, early spontaneous activity is required for the formation of increasingly synchronous alternating bursts between ipsilateral and contralateral regions of the spinal cord and for the integration of new cells into the circuit. In the cortex, early waves of activity have been observed in the cerebellum and cortical slices. Once sensory stimulus becomes available, final fine-tuning of sensory-coding maps and circuit refinement begins to rely more and more on sensory-evoked activity as demonstrated by classic experiments about the effects of sensory deprivation during critical periods.|$|E
50|$|Since CASA {{serves to}} model {{functionality}} {{parts of the}} auditory system, {{it is necessary to}} view parts of the biological auditory system in terms of known physical models. Consisting of three areas, the outer, middle and inner ear, the auditory periphery acts as a complex transducer that converts sound vibrations into action potentials in the auditory nerve. The outer ear consists of the external ear, ear canal and the ear drum. The outer ear, like an acoustic funnel, helps locating the sound source. The ear canal acts as a resonant tube (like an organ pipe) to amplify frequencies between 2-5.5 kHz with a maximum amplification of about 11dB occurring around 4 kHz. As the organ of hearing, the cochlea consists of two membranes, Reissner’s and the basilar membrane. The basilar membrane moves to audio stimuli through the specific stimulus frequency matches the resonant frequency of a particular region of the basilar membrane. The movement the basilar membrane displaces the inner hair cells in one direction, which encodes a half-wave rectified signal of action potentials in the <b>spiral</b> <b>ganglion</b> cells. The axons of these cells make up the auditory nerve, encoding the rectified stimulus. The auditory nerve responses select certain frequencies, similar to the basilar membrane. For lower frequencies, the fibers exhibit “phase locking”. Neurons in higher auditory pathway centers are tuned to specific stimuli features, such as periodicity, sound intensity, amplitude and frequency modulation. There are also neuroanatomical associations of ASA through the posterior cortical areas, including the posterior superior temporal lobes and the posterior cingulate. Studies have found that impairments in ASA and segregation and grouping operations are affected in patients with Alzheimer's disease.|$|E
50|$|The {{outer ear}} funnels sound {{vibrations}} to the eardrum, increasing the sound {{pressure in the}} middle frequency range. The middle-ear ossicles further amplify the vibration pressure roughly 20 times. The base of the stapes couples vibrations into the cochlea via the oval window, which vibrates the perilymph liquid (present throughout the inner ear) and causes the round window to bulb out as the oval window bulges in. Vestibular and tympanic ducts are filled with perilymph, and the smaller cochlear duct between them is filled with endolymph, a fluid with a very different ion concentrations and voltage. Vestibular duct perilymph vibrations bend organ of Corti outer cells (4 lines) causing prestin {{to be released in}} cell tips. This causes the cells to be chemically elongated and shrunk (somatic motor), and hair bundles to shift which, in turn, electrically effects the basilar membrane’s movement (hair-bundle motor). These motors (outer cells) amplify the perilymph vibrations that initially incited them over 40-fold. Since both motors are chemically driven they are unaffected by the newly amplified vibrations due to recuperation time. The outer hair cells (OHC) are minimally innervated by <b>spiral</b> <b>ganglion</b> in slow (unmyelinated) reciprocal communicative bundles (30+ hairs per nerve fiber); this contrasts inner hair cells (IHC) that have only afferent innervation (30+ nerve fibers per one hair) but are heavily connected. There are 4x more OHC than IHC. The basilar membrane is a wall where the majority of the IHC and OHC sit. Basilar membrane width and stiffness corresponds to the frequencies best sensed by the IHC. At the cochlea base the Basilar is at its narrowest and most stiff (high-frequencies), at the cochlea apex it is at its widest and least stiff (low-frequencies). The tectorial membrane supports the remaining IHC and OHC. Tectorial membrane helps facilitate cochlear amplification by stimulating OHC (direct) and IHC (via endolymph vibrations). Tectorial's width and stiffness parallels Basilar's and similarly aids in frequency differentiation.|$|E
50|$|The LOCS (originating {{from both}} the {{intrinsic}} and shell neurons) contains unmyelinated fibres that synapse with the dendrites of the Type I <b>spiral</b> <b>ganglion</b> cells projecting to the inner hair cells. While the intrinsic LOCS neurons tend to be small (~10 to 15 µm in diameter), and the shell OC neurons are larger (~25 µm in diameter), it is the intrinsic OC neurons that possess the larger axons (0.77 µm compared to 0.37 µm diameter for shell neurons). In contrast, the MOCS contains myelinated nerve fibres which innervate the outer hair cells directly. Although both the LOCS and MOCS contain crossed (contralateral) and uncrossed (ipsilateral) fibres, in most mammalian species the majority of LOCS fibres project to the ipsilateral cochlea, whilst {{the majority of the}} MOCS fibres project to the contralateral cochlea. The proportion of fibres in the MOCS and LOCS also varies between species, but in most cases the fibres of the LOCS are more numerous. In humans, there are an estimated (average) 1,000 LOCS fibres and 360 MOCS fibres, however the numbers vary between individuals. The MOCS gives rise to a frequency-specific innervation of the cochlea, in that MOC fibres terminate on the outer hair cells at the place in the cochlea predicted from the fibres’ characteristic frequency, and are thus tonotopically organised in the same fashion as the primary afferent neurons. The fibres of the LOCS also appear to be arranged in a tonotopic fashion. However, it is not known whether the characteristic frequencies of the LOCS fibres coincide with the characteristic frequencies of the primary afferent neurons, since attempts to selectively stimulate the fibres of the LOCS have been largely unsuccessful. Intrinsic LOCS derived axons travel only approximately 1 µm within the organ of Corti, generally spiraling apically. They give off a small tuft of synaptic boutons that is compact in its extent, often involving less than 10 IHCs. In comparison, shell neurons spiral both apically and basally, and can cover large territories within the organ of Corti. The shell axons often cover 1-2 octaves of tonotopic length. Their terminal arbor is quite sparse, however.|$|E
40|$|The <b>spiral</b> <b>ganglion</b> is an {{essential}} functional component of the peripheral auditory system. Most types of hearing loss are associated with <b>spiral</b> <b>ganglion</b> cell degeneration which is irreversible due to the inner ear’s lack of re-generative capacity.

40|$|Retrograde {{degeneration}} of <b>spiral</b> <b>ganglion</b> {{cells in}} the cochlea following hair cell loss is similar to dying back in pathology.

The relationship of EFR 3 A and <b>spiral</b> <b>ganglion</b> degeneration, however, was rarely investigated. In this study, we destroyed the hair cells of the mouse cochlea by co-administration of kanamycin and furosemide and then investigated the EFR 3 A expression during the induced <b>spiral</b> <b>ganglion</b> cell degeneration. Our results revealed that co-administration of kanamycin and furosemide quickly induced hair cell loss in the C 57 BL/ 6 J mice and then resulted in progressive degeneration of the <b>spiral</b> <b>ganglion</b> beginning at day 5 following drug administration. The number of the <b>spiral</b> <b>ganglion</b> cells began to decrease at day 15. The expression of EFR 3 A increased remarkably in the <b>spiral</b> <b>ganglion</b> at day 5 and then decreased to near normal level within the next 10 days.

We first quantified the subunits of T-type calcium channel blockers in the <b>spiral</b> <b>ganglion</b> neurons of C 57 BL/ 6 J mice in three groups (6 - 8 W, 24 - 26 W, 42 - 44 W) according to age via RT-PCR. Next, we administered three drugs (zonisamide, felodipine, saline) to the 42 - 44 -W C 57 BL/ 6 J mice by gavage for four weeks. We observed the changes in the hearing threshold of 42 - 44 -W C 57 BL/ 6 J mice after treatment. Meanwhile, we measured the expression of calcium-binding proteins of <b>spiral</b> <b>ganglion</b> neurons after treatment. Our results showed that three receptors were expressed in the <b>spiral</b> <b>ganglion</b> neurons of C 57 BL/ 6 J mice. The expression level of α 1 H was stronger than that of α 1 G and α 1 I. The expression levels of three receptors especially for α 1 G and α 1 H significantly decreased with age. The hearing threshold at 24 kHz was significantly decreased after zonisamide administration. No significant differ-ence in the expression level of calbindin in <b>spiral</b> <b>ganglion</b> neurons was noted. Interestingly, the expression level of calmodulin in <b>spiral</b> <b>ganglion</b> neurons was lower in the zonisamide-treated groups than in the felodipine- and saline-treated group.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Inhibitors of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) {{signaling}} pathway {{have been demonstrated}} to protect hair cells of the auditory system and different types of neurons from various insults, and their use for future therapeutic applications has been proposed. In the study, we evaluated the effects of inhibition of the JNK pathway on process outgrowth from <b>spiral</b> <b>ganglion</b> neurons. METHODS: <b>Spiral</b> <b>ganglion</b> explants from rats (postnatal days 3 - 5) that were cultured on laminin were treated with neurotrophin- 3 and/or the JNK {{signaling pathway}} inhibitor CEP- 11004. Both neurite length and number of the explants were evaluated and statistically analyzed by analysis of variance. RESULTS: Inhibition of the JNK signaling pathway reduced process outgrowth from <b>spiral</b> <b>ganglion</b> explants. The reduction, both in length and number of neurites, was reversed by the application of neurotrophin- 3. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that an intact JNK signaling pathway is important for process outgrowth of <b>spiral</b> <b>ganglion</b> neurons. However, neurotrophin- 3 stimulates process extension by a JNK independent pathway. Our results demonstrate that inhibition of the JNK pathway can have adverse effects on the extension of <b>spiral</b> <b>ganglion</b> neurons, but that the negative effects can be ameliorated by appropriate treatment...|$|E
40|$|Excessive noise, ototoxic drugs, infections, {{autoimmune}} diseases, {{and aging}} can cause loss of <b>spiral</b> <b>ganglion</b> neurons, leading to permanent {{sensorineural hearing loss}} in mammals. Stem cells have been confirmed {{to be able to}} differentiate into <b>spiral</b> <b>ganglion</b> neurons. Little has been reported on adipose tissue-derived stem cells (ADSCs) for repair of injured <b>spiral</b> <b>ganglion</b> neurons. In this study, we hypothesized that transplantation of neural induced-human ADSCs (NI-hADSCs) can repair the injured <b>spiral</b> <b>ganglion</b> neurons in guinea pigs with neomycin-induced sensorineural hearing loss. NI-hADSCs were induced with culture medium containing basic fibroblast growth factor and forskolin and then injected to the injured cochleae. Guinea pigs that received injection of Hanks′ balanced salt solution into the cochleae were used as controls. Hematoxylin-eosin staining showed that at 8 weeks after cell transplantation, the number of surviving <b>spiral</b> <b>ganglion</b> neurons in the cell transplantation group was significantly increased than that in the control group. Also at 8 weeks after cell transplantation, immunohistochemical staining showed that a greater number of NI-hADSCs in the spiral ganglions were detected in the cell transplantation group than in the control group, and these NI-hADSCs expressed neuronal markers neurofilament protein and microtubule-associated protein 2. Within 8 weeks after cell transplantation, the guinea pigs in the cell transplantation group had a gradually decreased auditory brainstem response threshold, while those in the control group had almost no response to 80 dB of clicks or pure tone burst. These findings suggest that a large amount of NI-hADSCs migrated to the spiral ganglions, survived for a period of time, repaired the injured <b>spiral</b> <b>ganglion</b> cells, and thereby contributed to the recovery of sensorineural hearing loss in guinea pigs...|$|E

With an optimized protocol, we obtained 2 ?? 10 ^ 3 neurons immediately after dissociation, or about one-fifth of those present in the intact <b>spiral</b> <b>ganglion.</b> After four days in culture, 4 % of the seeded neurons survived without any exogenous growth factors other than insulin. This yield was highly reproducible in five independent experiments and enabled us to measure systematically the numbers and lengths of the regenerating neurites. Furthermore, the survival rate compared well to the few published protocols for culturing adult <b>spiral</b> <b>ganglion</b> neurons from other species. Enhanced survival and neurite outgrowth upon the addition of brain-derived neurotrophic factor and leukemia inhibitory factor demonstrated that both are potent stimulants for damaged <b>spiral</b> <b>ganglion</b> neurons in adults.
