40|$|Two {{procedures}} for the synthesis of benzo- 21 -crown- 7 have been explored. The [1 + 1] macrocyclization with KBF 4 as the template {{was found to be}} more efficient than the intramolecular macrocyclization without template. Pseudorotaxanes form with secondary ammonium ions bearing at least one alkyl chain narrow enough to slip into the crown ether. Substitution on benzo- 21 -crown- 7 or on the <b>secondary</b> ammonium <b>axle</b> alters the binding affinity and binding mode. Compared to dibenzo- 24 -crown- 8, the complexing properties of benzo- 21 -crown- 7 turn out to be more susceptible to modifications at the crown periphery...|$|R
5000|$|.....Systems are the {{solutions}} from Driveline, which include advanced technology centered on continuous improvement and {{innovation in the}} application of alternative power and sustainable energy in systems that deliver performance. Major successes are the developing families of eAxles and eTransmissions across multiple customer programmes.eAxles support the electrification of a vehicle as <b>secondary</b> driven <b>axle</b> while the primary engine is still a combustion engine and therefore can be disconnected. eTransmissions on the contrary manage the torque on the primary axle of fully electrified vehicles.The eAxle drive module is a compact, lightweight Gear with an actively controlled clutch for electric motor assisted AWD. The eAxle unit for axle split Hybrid electric vehicle incorporates a proprietary disconnect clutch technology, which facilitates on-demand all-wheel-drive (AWD) use and contributes to the overall all-terrain functionality and fuel efficiency.Electric drive transmissions can transmit up to 300 kW of power, they are available with ratios up to 14 and can be matched with E-motors from various suppliers to allow flexible application.|$|R

5000|$|The {{architecture}} of an AWD/4WD {{system can be}} described by describing its possible operating modes. A single vehicle may {{have the ability to}} operate in multiple modes depending on driver selection. Mohan describes the modes as follows:Two Wheel Drive (2WD) Mode - In this mode only one axle (typically the rear axle) is driven. The drive to the other axle is disconnected. The operating torque split ratio is 0:100. Four Wheel Drive (4WD) Mode - Here, depending on the nature of torque transfer to the axles, we can define three sub-modes (below).:Part-time Mode - The front and rear axle drives are rigidly coupled in the transfer case. Since the driveline does not permit any speed differentiation between the axles and would cause driveline wind-up, this mode is recommended only for ‘part-time’ use in off-road or loose surface conditions where driveline wind-up is unlikely. Up to full torque could go to either axle depending on the road condition and the weight over the axles. :Full-time Mode - Both axles are driven at all times but an inter-axle differential permits the axles to turn at different speeds as needed. This allows the vehicle to be driven ‘full-time’ in this mode, regardless of the road surface, without fear of driveline wind-up. With standard bevel gear differentials the torque split is 50:50. Planetary differentials can provide asymmetric torque splits as needed. A system that operates permanently in the full-time mode is sometimes called ‘All-the-Time 4WD’, 'All-Wheel-Drive' or ‘AWD’. If the inter-axle differential is locked out then the mode reverts to a ‘part-time mode’. :On-Demand Mode - In this mode the transfer case operates primarily in the 2WD mode. Torque is transferred to the <b>secondary</b> <b>axle</b> as needed by modulating the transfer clutch from ‘open’ to a rigidly coupled state while avoiding any driveline wind-up. The torque modulation may be achieved by active electronic/hydraulic control systems, or by passive devices, based on wheel slip or wheel torque, as described in the section on traction control systems.In addition to these basic modes there could be implementations that combine these modes. The system could have a clutch across the center differential, for example, capable of modulating the front axle torque from a Full-time mode with the 30:70 torque split of the center differential to the 0:100 torque split of the 2WD mode ...|$|E
