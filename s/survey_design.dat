25|$|In survey sampling, {{many of the}} {{individuals}} identified {{as part of the}} sample may be unwilling to participate, not have the time to participate (opportunity cost), or survey administrators may {{not have been able to}} contact them. In this case, there is a risk of differences, between respondents and nonrespondents, leading to biased estimates of population parameters. This is often addressed by improving <b>survey</b> <b>design,</b> offering incentives, and conducting follow-up studies which make a repeated attempt to contact the unresponsive and to characterize their similarities and differences with the rest of the frame. The effects can also be mitigated by weighting the data when population benchmarks are available or by imputing data based on answers to other questions. Nonresponse is particularly a problem in internet sampling. Reasons for this problem include improperly designed surveys, over-surveying (or survey fatigue), and the fact that potential participants hold multiple e-mail addresses, which they don't use anymore or don't check regularly.|$|E
2500|$|Because the <b>survey</b> <b>design</b> is {{two-dimensional}} (rectangular), {{while the}} actual earth is three-dimensional (~ spherical), adjustments to land areas {{must be made}} periodically to prevent error propagation; not all sections can be one square mile nor can all townships be exactly 36 square miles. [...] More specifically, all north-south running lines (all range lines and half of all section lines), as with the prime meridian, are always established with reference to true, geodetic north. [...] But it is a physical impossibility to meet this condition and still maintain a rectangular land grid, because such lines converge on the north pole—they are meridians.|$|E

The intention of the new building was to provide better working facilities and amenities for an increasing staff in an efficient and productive environment. The department was performing a major role with private industry and commerce in Queensland's development and the new building would reflect this. Not only would it be an impressive place for people to register their vehicles, it would be the co-ordinating centre for the planning, <b>survey,</b> <b>design</b> and construction work of the MRD.|$|E

40|$|There are {{currently}} few choices for social scientists {{who want to}} employ web-based surveys in their studies. They can either use a special-purpose language whose notion of flow control may be too limiting to express advanced <b>survey</b> <b>designs,</b> or use a generalpurpose language that gives them the freedom to make complicated <b>survey</b> <b>designs</b> but makes them reimplement infrastructure code for saving questions to disk, generating HTML, and so on with each new survey. In this paper, we introduce Topsl, a domain-specific language embedded in PLT Scheme that takes the middle road, giving survey authors a way to reuse survey infrastructure for new surveys while also allowing them to express complicated <b>survey</b> <b>designs</b> easily. ...|$|R

They chose Alfred Benesch and Associates, which released its final report on May 3, 1957.
