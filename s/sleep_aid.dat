25|$|The {{percentage}} of adults using a prescription <b>sleep</b> <b>aid</b> increases with age. During 2005–2010, about 4% of U.S. adults aged 20 and over {{reported that they}} took prescription sleep aids in the past 30 days. Rates of use were lowest among the youngest age group (those aged 20–39) at about 2%, increased to 6% among those aged 50–59, and reached 7% among those aged 80 and over. More adult women (5.0%) reported using prescription sleep aids than adult men (3.1%). Non-Hispanic white adults reported higher use of sleep aids (4.7%) than non-Hispanic black (2.5%) and Mexican-American (2.0%) adults. No difference was shown between non-Hispanic black adults and Mexican-American adults in use of prescription sleep aids.|$|E

2500|$|While Karen was {{suffering}} from the anorexia nervosa that would ultimately kill her in 1983, in the late 1970s, Richard suffered from insomnia, panic attacks, depression, and an addiction to Quaalude, a sedative and hypnotic medication.

Schmidt's biography Little Girl Blue: The Life of Karen Carpenter (2010): [...] "His mother {{is said to have}} given him his first pill," [...] an observation that was previously portrayed in the CBS-TV [...] television film The Karen Carpenter Story (1989) and commented on in several of that made-for-TV movie's reviews, which also noted that Agnes (their mother) had been taking them under prescription and thus thought they were safe.

40|$|It is {{suggested}} that older adults have more difficulty maintaining sleep than younger adults, and that sleep also becomes more fragmented with increasing age. The aim of this thesis was to assess sleep patterns in older adults, and to investigate some pharmacological agents taken by older adults as <b>sleep</b> <b>aids.</b> A survey of 5846 older adults identified sleep complaints and methods of alleviation. Results supported previous findings, and pain and nocturia {{were found to be}} the main reasons for nocturnal awakenings. Respondents reported the use of hypnotics, antidepressants, over-the-counter preparations and herbal remedies as <b>sleep</b> <b>aids.</b> Respondents also used whisky, hot milky drinks and reading at bedtime to <b>aid</b> <b>sleep.</b> Three placebo-controlled clinical trials were implemented to assess the effects of a herbal remedy (valerian), three hypnotics (loprazolam, zopiclone and zolpidem), and two antidepressants (dothiepin and moclobemide) on sleep and daytime performance. Results showed few advantageous effects of an acute dose of valerian. Loprazolam, zopiclone and zolpidem were given to younger adults to assess these treatments without the confounds of old age. These treatments were found to be effective hypnotics from the first night of use, but there were more residual sedative effects under loprazolam than zopiclone or zolpidem. Neither dothiepin nor moclobemide were found to be suitable for use as <b>sleep</b> <b>aids,</b> also using a younger population. Findings indicate most older adults do not have sleep complaints, but those who do are likely to have sleep problems due to physical reasons. More research is necessary into the duration of valerian use and doses for efficacy. Residual sedative effects under loprazolam may increase the risk of accidents, and shorter acting hypnotics, such as zopiclone and zolpidem, may reduce this risk. Dothiepin showed more sedative effect than moclobemide, but there was little evidence of improved sleep. Further research is necessary to establish the causes of poor sleep in old age, and to assess the suitability of other <b>sleep</b> <b>aids</b> in this age group...|$|R
2500|$|In 1903, Hermann Emil Fischer and Joseph von Mering {{disclosed}} their {{discovery that}} diethylbarbituric acid, formed from {{the reaction of}} diethylmalonic acid, phosphorus oxychloride and urea, induces sleep in dogs. The discovery was patented and licensed to Bayer pharmaceuticals, which marketed the compound under the trade name Veronal as a <b>sleep</b> <b>aid</b> beginning in 1904. Systematic investigations {{of the effect of}} structural changes on potency and duration of action led to the discovery of phenobarbital at Bayer in 1911 and the discovery of its potent anti-epileptic activity in 1912. [...] Phenobarbital was among the most widely used drugs for the treatment of epilepsy through the 1970s, and as of 2014, remains on the World Health Organizations list of essential medications. The 1950s and 1960s saw increased awareness of the addictive properties and abuse potential of barbiturates and amphetamines and led to increasing restrictions on their use and growing government oversight of prescribers. [...] Today, amphetamine is largely restricted to use in the treatment of attention deficit disorder and phenobarbital in the treatment of epilepsy.|$|E
2500|$|In 1966 Beuys {{presented}} with piece as a performance. He had made one object, [...] a piano covered entirely in felt {{with a red}} cross on its side. The piano could not be played and no sound would ever be heard from beneath the felt. Beuys remarks that the piano will always hold the potential for sound. The red cross is a symbol for the danger that people face when we remain silent. When he presented this work he also used a black board to draw and write on. Beuys often uses this medium to create discussion and memory. What is not often included in the documentation of this piece is the subtitle that Beuys included: “The Greatest Composer here is the Thalidomide Child. Thalidomide was a <b>sleep</b> <b>aid</b> introduced in the 1950s to Germany and then across the west. It was soon found that it aided in morning sickness and was prescribed in unlimited doses to pregnant women. It was quickly apparent that Thalidomide was causing deformities in the children of mothers who had taken the drug. It was {{on the market for}} less than four years. In Germany around 2,500 children were affected. During his performance Beuys held a discussion about the Thalidomide child as the greatest composer and the division of the cross.|$|E
