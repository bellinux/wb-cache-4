40|$|Introduction: In the {{majority}} of developing countries, the volume of medical insurance services, provided by social insurance organizations is inadequate. Thus, <b>supplementary</b> <b>medical</b> insurance is proposed {{as a means to}} address inadequacy of medical insurance. Accordingly, in this article, we attempted to provide the context for expansion of this important branch of insurance through identification of essential factors affecting demand for <b>supplementary</b> <b>medical</b> insurance...|$|R
2500|$|The <b>Supplementary</b> <b>Medical</b> Insurance, SMI, (otherwise {{known as}} Medicare Part B & D) {{expenditure}} rate of $307.4 billion in 2012 while bringing in only $293.9 billion {{means that the}} <b>Supplementary</b> <b>Medical</b> Insurance trust funds are also being seriously depleted and increased tax rates or reduced coverage will be required. The additional retirees expected under the [...] "baby boom bulge" [...] will hasten this trust fund depletion as well as legislation to end the Medicare Part D medical prescription drug funding [...] "donut hole" [...] are all tied to medical costs growth rates, which have traditionally increased much faster than GDP growth rates.|$|R

5000|$|Part B (<b>Supplementary</b> <b>Medical</b> Insurance, or SMI) covers {{physician}} services, outpatient services, {{and home}} health and preventive services. The SMI trust fund is funded through beneficiary premiums (set at 25% of estimated program {{costs for the}} aged) and general revenues (the remaining amount, approximately 75%).|$|R
40|$|Designed to {{contribute}} to {{an assessment of the}} effects of the second agreement with general practitioners, the study analyzes the effects produced on the medical practices of general practitioners by pay range of a) the individual income ceiling and b) various types of fee restrictions on <b>supplementary</b> <b>medical</b> procedures provided under the agreement. ...|$|R
40|$|Financing {{for social}} {{security}} [...] Old Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance [...] and the Hospital Insurance part of Medicare is provided primarily by taxes levied on wages and net self-employment income. Financing for the <b>Supplementary</b> <b>Medical</b> Insurance portion of Medicare is provided by premiums from enrollees and payments from the government. This report describes these taxes and premiums...|$|R
40|$|This report {{discusses}} President's budget {{request to}} Congress for Medicare, {{for the following}} federal fiscal year, along with projections for the five-year budget window. The President’s 2007 budget includes Medicare legislative proposals for Part A (Hospital Insurance) and Part B (<b>Supplementary</b> <b>Medical</b> Insurance) spending with estimated savings of $ 2. 5 billion in 2007 and $ 35. 9 billion over the five-year budget window...|$|R
40|$|This report {{focuses on}} the two {{separate}} trust funds that fund Medicare, the Hospital Insurance (HI) trust fund and <b>Supplementary</b> <b>Medical</b> Insurance (SMI) trust fund. Almost from its inception, the HI trust fund has faced a projected shortfall and eventual insolvency. Because {{of the way it}} is financed, the SMI trust fund cannot become insolvent; however, the Medicare Trustees continue to express concerns about the rapid growth in SMI costs...|$|R
50|$|The {{bill would}} direct the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MEDPAC) {{to report to}} Congress on the {{relationship}} between: (1) physician and other health professional utilization and expenditures (and their rate of increase) of items and services for which Medicare payment is made, and (2) total utilization and expenditures (and their rate of increase) under Medicare parts A (Hospital Insurance), B (<b>Supplementary</b> <b>Medical</b> Insurance), and D (Voluntary Prescription Drug Benefit Program).|$|R
50|$|The {{legislation}} {{made two}} {{amendments to the}} Social Security Act of 1935. Title XVIII, which became known as Medicare, includes Part A, which provides hospital insurance for the aged, and Part B, which provides <b>supplementary</b> <b>medical</b> insurance. Title XIX, which became known as Medicaid, provides for the states to finance health care for individuals who were at or close to the public assistance level with federal matching funds.|$|R
50|$|The {{bill would}} revise {{the formula for}} calculating the {{baseline}} for discretionary spending for the budget year and each outyear to eliminate adjustments for: (1) expiring multiyear subsidized housing contracts; (2) administrative expenses of the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund, the <b>Supplementary</b> <b>Medical</b> Insurance Trust Fund, the Unemployment Trust Fund, and the Railroad Retirement account; (3) offsets to federal employees' annual pay; and (4) certain inflators used to adjust budgetary resources in the Act.|$|R
25|$|Medicare was {{established}} in 1965 and expanded thereafter. Spending for Medicare during 2016 was $692 billion, versus $634 billion in 2014, an increase of $58 billion or 9%. In 2013, the program covered an estimated 52.3 million persons. It consists of four distinct parts which are funded differently: Hospital Insurance, mainly funded by a dedicated payroll tax of 2.9% of earnings, shared equally between employers and workers; <b>Supplementary</b> <b>Medical</b> Insurance, funded through beneficiary premiums (set at 25% of estimated program costs for the aged) and general revenues (the remaining amount, approximately 75%); Medicare Advantage, a private plan option for beneficiaries, funded through the Hospital Insurance and <b>Supplementary</b> <b>Medical</b> Insurance trust funds; and the Part D prescription drug benefits, for which funding {{is included in the}} <b>Supplementary</b> <b>Medical</b> Insurance trust fund and is financed through beneficiary premiums (about 25%) and general revenues (about 75%). Spending on Medicare and Medicaid is projected to grow dramatically in coming decades. The number of persons enrolled in Medicare is expected to increase from 47 million in 2010 to 80 million by 2030. While the same demographic trends that affect Social Security also affect Medicare, rapidly rising medical prices appear to be a more important cause of projected spending increases. CBO expects Medicare and Medicaid to continue growing, rising from 5.3% GDP in 2009 to 10.0% in 2035 and 19.0% by 2082. CBO has indicated healthcare spending per beneficiary is the primary long-term fiscal challenge. Various reform strategies were proposed for healthcare, and in March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act was enacted as a means of health care reform. CBO reduced its per capita Medicare spending assumptions by $1,000 for 2014 and $2,300 for 2019, relative to its 2010 estimate for those years. If this trend continues, it will significantly improve the long-term budget outlook.|$|R
40|$|This report {{discusses}} Medicare, {{which consists}} of two distinct parts — Part A (Hospital Insurance (HI)) and Part B (<b>Supplementary</b> <b>Medical</b> Insurance (SMI)). Part A is financed primarily through payroll taxes levied on current workers and their employers. Income from these taxes is credited to the HI trust fund. Part B is financed {{through a combination of}} monthly premiums paid by current enrollees and general revenues. Income from these sources is credited to the SMI trust fund...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, I want {{to address}} the large budget gap that will emerge in Medicare and Medicaid in the decades to come.  In {{subsequent}} sections of the paper, I will briefly describe the finances of the programs {{and some of their}} major features.  I will then explain the projections done by the U. S. Congressional Budget Office and by the U. S. appointed Board of Trustees of Social Security, Federal Hospital Insurance and Federal <b>Supplementary</b> <b>Medical</b> Insurance Trust Funds.  The final sections of the paper will discuss measures that might be taken to close the budget gap which Medicare and Medicaid create in the context of rising health care costs in the United States. ...|$|R

40|$|In this article, we {{examined}} the concentration of Medicare expenditures among the aged for 1969, 1975, and 1982 to determine if expenditures have become more concentrated among a few heavy users of service over time. Despite an increase in reimbursements for the aged from $ 6. 0 billion in 1969 to $ 41. 8 billion in 1982, the distribution of those expenses remained remarkably stable, with a slight lessening in the concentration of reimbursements in 1982. Patterns were similar for both Part A (hospital insurance) and Part B (<b>supplementary</b> <b>medical</b> insurance) services. The concentration of expenditures was much greater among survivors than among people who died in both 1975 and 1982, with little change {{in the distribution of}} expenditures within either group...|$|R
