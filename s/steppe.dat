5|$|A {{semi-arid}} desert or a <b>steppe</b> is {{a version}} of the arid desert with much more rainfall, vegetation and higher humidity. These regions feature a semi-arid climate and are less extreme than regular deserts. Like arid deserts, temperatures can vary greatly in semi deserts. They share some characteristics of a true desert and are usually located at the edge of deserts and continental dry areas. They usually receive precipitation from 250mm (10in) to 500mm (20in) but this can vary due to evapotranspiration and soil nutrition. Semi deserts {{can be found in the}} Tabernas Desert (and some of the Spanish Plateau), The Sahel, The Eurasian <b>Steppe,</b> most of Central Asia, the Western US, most of Northern Mexico, portions of South America (especially in Argentina) and the Australian Outback. They usually feature BSh (hot <b>steppe)</b> or BSk (temperate <b>steppe)</b> in the Köppen climate classification.|$|E
5|$|The Iazyges' {{trade with}} the Pontic <b>Steppe</b> and Black Sea was {{extremely}} important to their economy. This can {{can be seen in}} one of the concessions offered to them by Marcus Aurelius after the Marcomannic War, in which he allows the Iazyges to move through Dacia and {{trade with the}} Roxolani, which reconnected them to the Pontic <b>Steppe</b> trade network. This trade route lasted until 260, when the Goths took over Tyras and Olbia, cutting off both the Roxolani and the Iazyges' trade with the Pontic <b>Steppe.</b>|$|E
5|$|Emperor Taizong, {{also known}} by his {{personal}} name Li Shimin, {{was familiar with}} the culture of the <b>steppe</b> nomads and employed military strategies using <b>steppe</b> tactics as a prince. Taizong was a skilled horsemen, and during a celebration of his victory and ascension to the throne, sacrificed a horse in a ritual derived from a Turkic religious practice. He was able to outmaneuver the heavy cavalry of the Sui Dynasty with his light cavalry, a characteristic of <b>steppe</b> warfare. Taizong shared personal relationships with Turkic allies as a prince, reinforced through oaths sworn as blood brothers. His later successes as an emperor against the armies of Central Asia through diplomacy and divide and rule are the result of his early experiences with Turkic culture.|$|E

5|$|For {{the most}} part, barring {{intermittent}} passes and valleys (the major one being the corridor through Zhangjiakou and the Juyong Pass), the North China Plain remained shielded from the Mongolian <b>steppe</b> by the Yin Mountains. However, if this defence were breached, China's flat terrain offered no protection {{to the cities}} on the plain, including the imperial capitals of Beijing, Kaifeng, and Luoyang. Heading west along the Yin Mountains, the range ends where the Yellow River circles northwards upstream in the area known as the Ordos Looptechnically part of the <b>steppe,</b> but capable of irrigated agriculture. Although the Yellow River formed a theoretical natural boundary with the north, such a border so far into the <b>steppe</b> was difficult to maintain. The lands south of the Yellow River—the Hetao, the Ordos Desert, and the Loess Plateau—provided no natural barriers on the approach to the Wei River valley, the oft-called cradle of Chinese civilization where the ancient capital Xi'an lay. As such, control of the Ordos remained extremely important for the rulers of China: not only for potential influence over the <b>steppe,</b> {{but also for the}} security of China proper. The region's strategic importance combined with its untenability led many dynasties to place their first walls here.|$|E

5|$|Beringia {{received}} more moisture and intermittent maritime cloud cover {{from the north}} Pacific Ocean {{than the rest of}} the Mammoth <b>steppe,</b> including the dry environments on either side of it. Moisture occurred along a north-south gradient with the south receiving the most cloud cover and moisture due to the airflow from the North Pacific. This moisture supported a shrub-tundra habitat that provided an ecological refugium for plants and animals. In this Beringian refugium, eastern Beringia's vegetation included isolated pockets of larch and spruce forests with birch and alder trees. This environment supported large herbivores that were prey for Beringian wolves and their competitors. <b>Steppe</b> bison (Bison priscus), Yukon horse (Equus lambei), woolly mammoth (Mammuthus primigenius), and Wild yak (Bos mutus) consumed grasses, sedges, and herbaceous plants. Caribou (Rangifer tarandus) and woodland muskox (Symbos cavifrons) consumed tundra plants, including lichen, fungi, and mosses.|$|E

5|$|In April 1943, the German {{leadership}} began {{preparing for}} Operation Citadel, {{with the objective}} of enveloping and destroying the Soviet forces in the Kursk salient, by attacking and breaking through the base of the salient from north and south simultaneously. The German offensive was delayed several times due to the vacillation of the leadership and the addition of more forces and new equipment. The Soviet high command, Stavka, had learned of the German intentions, and therefore used the delay to prepare a series of defensive belts along the routes of the planned German offensive. The Soviet leadership also massed several armies deep behind their defences as the Stavka Reserve. This army group, the <b>Steppe</b> Front, was to launch counteroffensives once the German strength had dissipated. The 5th Guards Tank Army was the primary armoured formation of the <b>Steppe</b> Front.|$|E

5|$|In the 2nd centuryBC, the Iazyges {{began to}} migrate {{west to the}} <b>steppe</b> near the Lower Dniester.

50|$|Anthony {{describes}} {{the spread of}} cattle-raising from early farmers in the Danube Valley into the Ukrainian <b>steppes</b> in the 6th-5th millennium BC, forming a cultural border with the hunter-gatherers whose languages may have included archaic PIE. Anthony notes that domesticated cattle and sheep probably didn't enter the <b>steppes</b> from the Transcaucasia, since the early farming communities there were not widespread, and separated from the <b>steppes</b> by the glaciated Caucasus. Subsequent cultures developed in this area which adopted cattle, most notably the Cucuteni-Trypillian culture.|$|R
40|$|Over the 19 th century {{there was}} a long-running debate in the Russian Empire over whether the <b>steppes</b> of today's {{southern}} Ukraine and southern Russia had ever been forested, or whether they had long been open grasslands. The clergyman-turned-scientist Ivan Palimpsestov and others believed that the <b>steppes</b> had once been covered in trees. They relied heavily on descriptive writings by people who had visited the <b>steppes</b> in past centuries. They argued that the trees had been removed by the Tatar and Mongol nomadic pastoralists, who had controlled the <b>steppes</b> {{prior to the start}} of large-scale Slav, agricultural settlement in the 18 th century, and by the Slav settlers. The counter-argument was put forward by a number of scientists, for example Karl Ernst Baer and Vasilii Dokuchaev. They used a wider range of sources and methodologies to reconstruct the past environment of the <b>steppes,</b> including descriptive accounts, place names, and, crucially, analysis of the soil. By 1880 s Dokuchaev had demonstrated conclusively that the organic matter in the black earth (chernozem) which covered most of the <b>steppes</b> had been formed from decomposed grasses. Trees had been restricted to small islands in the <b>steppes.</b> Thus, the paper will examine the development of 'modern' science in the Russian Empire. The debate also concerned the economic development of the region. The imperial government sought to transform the <b>steppes</b> from semi-arid grasslands sparsely populated by nomadic pastoralists into a productive agricultural land inhabited by large numbers of Slav farmers. Once the <b>steppes</b> had been conquered militarily, however, the Slav, agricultural settlement was hindered by shortages of trees and moisture. The settlers needed trees to supply timber for constuction and firewood, but is was also widely believed - on both sides of the debate - that woodland made local climates less extreme and moister. The point of Palimpsestov's argument was that if the <b>steppes</b> had once been covered in trees, they could be reforested, and the woodland would have a moderating influence on the climate, making it more suitable for arable farming. Dokuchaev shared this wider aim, but sought to provide a solid scientific basis for the sustainable agricultural development of the <b>steppes,</b> including plans for limited aforestation. Thus, the paper will investigate the role of plans for economic development in the debate. The debate, it will be argued in this paper, also concerned the identity of the <b>steppes.</b> The heartland of the Russian state and settlement lay in forested lands around Moscow. Over the 19 th century, there was considerable anxiety among educated Russians over the growing pace of deforestation throughout Russia. Thus, forests were important to Russians' sense of identity, together with their ethnicity, language, religion and predominantly agricultural way of life. Thus the paper will consider the extent to which those who argued the <b>steppes</b> had once been forested were trying to give them a 'Russian' identity prior to the Russian conquest and Slav, agricultural settlement of the region...|$|R
