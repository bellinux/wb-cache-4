30|$|DA markets mandate {{participants}} to declare their generation schedules {{for the next}} day several hours {{before the start of the}} operational day. Time difference between the <b>submission</b> <b>of</b> <b>bids</b> and real-time operation ranges from 14 to 38 hours. For example, in Spanish DA market, bids are submitted a day before at 10 : 00 a.m. [5]. It is 11 : 30 a.m. for Turkish DA market case [6]. However, hourly wind power generation can be forecasted with a mean absolute error in the range of 15 %- 20 % for a single plant from one day before; thus, deviations from DA schedule inevitably occur in actual generation [7]. Consequently, wind power producers are exposed to high imbalance penalties in balancing markets because of the uncertain wind forecasts. Likewise wind uncertainty, imbalance prices are also highly volatile and unpredictable. One of the reasons for this is that the amount of energy traded and the number of participants in balancing markets are relatively low compared to DA markets. Secondly, dual pricing mechanism, which Turkish balancing market has been practicing, makes imbalance prices even more difficult to estimate due to almost random nature of the direction of overall imbalances of the producers and the system.|$|E

Why add to the complications of an already difficult process? If it is because the old rules do not work, why is it expected that new ones will make much of a difference? Furthermore, the old rules generally empower budget-makers by enabling them to allocate resources according to the preferences of government. Fiscal rules, by contrast, constrain budget-makers, taking away much of their authority to decide aggregate revenue and spending policy. These rules typically prescribe the balance between revenue and spending policy. Every fiscal rule is a limit on the exercise of political will. Why have democracies accepted or imposed fiscal limits on themselves, and why should we expect these limits to be effective when they run counter to the preferences of voters and politicians?

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} reasons for which a seller may decide to conduct a multi-unit auction sequentially rather than simultaneously. It analyzes {{the manner in which}} the information generated during a sequential auction can affect bidding to the seller's benefit and demonstrates the requirement of intertemporal commitment to the auction rules. When the seller cannot commit not to alter the reserve price over time, the bidders are reluctant to reveal their valuations. Therefore, with single-unit demands, a symmetric monotone equilibrium exists only in a sequential Dutch auction. In the earlier rounds of this auction, because of the anticipation of lower reserve prices in the future, some buyers prefer not to submit a bid, although their valuations exceed the requested reserve price. Furthermore, any buyer submitting a bid shades it sharply. Consequently, under imperfect commitment, the optimal sequential auction results in lower expected revenue than its simultaneous counterpart. In the presence of allocative and informational externalities, in particular, in a sale of two oligopoly licenses, a sequential auction succeeds in eliminating some of the payoff uncertainty by allocating the licenses in an ordered manner, according to the bidders' strength. Therefore, the weaker oligopolist can acquire his license at a lower price than the one he would pay in a simultaneous auction. In addition, he can avoid overpaying. Conversely, the stronger oligopolist pays a higher price, so that, when the bidders' production costs are independent, the two auction schemes generate the same expected revenue. Therefore, without affecting the seller's revenue or efficiency objectives, the sequential auction results in a more equal distribution of the wealth generated by the oligopoly. Finally, when the preparation or <b>submission</b> <b>of</b> <b>bids</b> is costly, so that a buyer will not enter the auction unless he expects a substantial gain from it, low prices in the earlier rounds of a sequential sale trigger stronger participation, and, consequently, higher prices in the later rounds. A sequential auction, therefore, may result in higher expected revenue than a simultaneous sale, especially when the number of potential bidders is large, the participation cost small, or the distribution of valuations convex...|$|E
40|$|Through {{the last}} decades, {{climate change and}} energy {{dependence}} concerns have gained increased attention. Renewable energy development has expanded, with wind power being the fastest growing technology. This thesis investigates the op- timal interaction between an operational wind park and the Nordic power market. Wind power producers incur costs of imbalances resulting from deviations from their submitted production plans to the spot market. This report develop, im- plement and test a stochastic optimisation model giving optimal spot market bids for intermittent electricity producers in a day-ahead power market. The optimal bids {{are based on the}} evaluation {{of a large number of}} scenarios for the uncertain realisations of the wind forecasts, the balancing market prices and the spot market prices. A case study is undertaken in order to evaluate model performance. Data is collected for specified dates at current and future wind power sites of a Norwegian company. The developed stochastic optimal bidding model is executed, once for each wind park individually and once for all wind parks jointly. The case study re- veals that jointly use of the model gives expected revenues higher than both the sum of individual use and <b>submission</b> <b>of</b> <b>bids</b> equal expected production. The increase in expected revenues results from a risk-pooling effect of jointly bid submission and from the inclusion of price and production uncertainty. The risk-pooling effect also suggests that wind park owners would benefit from geographically diversifying their wind parks within the same price area. Use of the developed model gives rather small increases in expected revenues and is likely to violate the Balance Agreement. However, investigations of model results give basis for further discussions. Examinations of the case study results show that perfect production forecasts would make the inclusion of uncertainty unnecessary, indicating that efforts should be made in order to reduce the uncertainty of the production forecasts, rather than on improving the price forecasts. From a socio-economic point of view, the regulation costs incurred to wind power producers represents a reduction in value from introducing wind power to the power system. Some of the potential value of wind power is lost, through what can be seen as transaction costs of the current power market. It is suggested that delaying the spot market bid submission deadline, which in turn reduce the wind forecast lead-time and hence uncertainty, would increase the value of introducing wind power to the power system. Further research should be undertaken in order to investigate the optimal spot market bid submission deadline, minimising all costs related to this deadline. </p...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Electricity price {{forecasting}} {{has become}} an integral part of power system operation and control. In this paper, a wavelet transform (WT) based neural network (NN) model to forecast price profile in a deregulated electricity market has been presented. The historical price data has been decomposed into wavelet domain constitutive sub series using WT and then combined with the other time domain variables to form the set of input variables for the proposed forecasting model. The behavior of the wavelet domain constitutive series has been studied based on statistical analysis. It has been observed that forecasting accuracy can be improved by the use of WT in a forecasting model. Multi-scale analysis from one to seven levels of decomposition has been performed and the empirical evidence suggests that accuracy improvement is highest at third level of decomposition. Forecasting performance of the proposed model has been compared with (i) a heuristic technique, (ii) a simulation model used by Ontario’s Independent Electricity System Operator (IESO), (iii) a Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) model, (iv) NN model, (v) Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model, (vi) Dynamic Regression (DR) model, and (vii) Transfer Function (TF) model.
