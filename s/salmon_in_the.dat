5|$|Before {{the storm}} reached Atlantic Canada, the Meteorological Branch of the Department of Transport {{provided}} notices for the advancing storm. On {{the day of}} the storm, the forecast from the Halifax weather office was for light winds, and although it was amended to highlight severe conditions, boats in the region had no radio to learn of the threat. There were many <b>salmon</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> region, which prompted fishermen to set sail. As the storm approached, there were about 45 boats in the Northumberland Strait between New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island.|$|E
5|$|For {{thousands}} of years, salmon was a reliable food source for Native Americans living along the Rogue. Salmon migrations were so huge that early settlers claimed {{they could hear}} the fish moving upstream. These large runs continued into the 20thcentury despite damage to spawning beds caused by gold mining in the 1850s and large-scale commercial fishing that began shortly thereafter. The fishing industry fed demands for <b>salmon</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> growing cities of Portland and San Francisco and for canned salmon in England.|$|E
5|$|In 1961, an {{overwhelming}} majority of voters in the TID and MID service areas and San Francisco approved bond issues to finance {{the construction of a new}} dam. The irrigation districts hoped to complete the dam by 1966, but concerns that the dam would further impact decreasing populations of king <b>salmon</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Tuolumne put a temporary stop to the project. In fact, it was not until that year that the Federal Power Commission (now Federal Energy Regulatory Commission) licensed the irrigation districts to go ahead on New Don Pedro.|$|E

5|$|Humans {{have lived}} in the Table Rock area for at least 15,000years, based on the age of Clovis points that were {{discovered}} nearby. The region surrounding the Table Rocks was home to the Takelma people. They gathered food such as acorns and tarweed seeds, and caught <b>salmon</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> nearby Rogue River. The Takelma also used deer hides for clothing. They had several names for the rocks, including Di'tani ("rock above"), Titanakh ("little Indian plums"), and possibly Kwenphunkh. The first use of the names Upper Table Rock and Lower Table Rock is unknown, however the first recorded use was by mountain man James Clyman in 1845.|$|E
5|$|In {{recognition}} {{of the fact that}} many people use the towpath to exercise their dogs, dog dips have been installed at Allbrook and Shawford. These provide easy access into the water for dogs, and owners are encouraged to only allow dogs to swim at these locations, to conserve the bank in other places. The water vole surveys have followed the best practice described in the Water Vole Conservation Handbook (2006), and have also recorded evidence of otter, brown rat and American mink populations. While carrying out the work, the surveyors have also counted sightings of kingfisher, heron, moorhen and coot. The bat survey recorded common pipistrelle, soprano pipistrelle, Daubenton's, noctule and serotine bats in 2011. Bat boxes have been erected near Allbrook, and there was some evidence that they were being used. The 2009 fisheries survey recorded large numbers of young Atlantic <b>salmon</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lower river, but although fish weirs have been provided, wild parr were not recorded near Winchester. Above there, a large population of brown trout thrives. Eels were monitored {{for the first time in}} 2009, when their distribution was found to be variable.|$|E

The North Pacific Fishery Management Council developed this FMP under the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (MSA). The FMP is being comprehensively revised {{to comply with}} the recent MSA requirements, such as annual catch limits and accountability measures, and to more clearly reflect the Councilâ€™s policy with regard to State of Alaska management authority for commercial and sport <b>salmon</b> fisheries <b>in</b> <b>the</b> EEZ.

25|$|The {{population}} of wild salmon declined markedly in recent decades, especially North Atlantic populations, which spawn {{in the waters}} of western Europe and eastern Canada, and wild <b>salmon</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Snake and Columbia River systems in northwestern United States.|$|E
25|$|Raw salmon flesh {{may contain}} Anisakis nematodes, marine parasites that cause Anisakiasis. Before the {{availability}} of refrigeration, Japan did not consume raw salmon.

25|$|Several {{additional}} {{attempts to}} establish spawning populations of Chinook, coho and Atlantic <b>salmon</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> river {{took place between}} 1939 and 1959. In each instance, failure to document subsequent natural reproduction led to each program being discontinued.

25|$|Canned <b>salmon</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> U.S. {{is usually}} wild Pacific catch, though some farmed salmon is {{available}} in canned form. Smoked salmon is another popular preparation method, and can either be hot or cold smoked. Lox can refer either to cold smoked salmon or to salmon cured in a brine solution (also called gravlax). Traditional canned salmon includes some skin (which is harmless) and bone (which adds calcium). Skinless and boneless canned salmon is also available.|$|E
25|$|Eosalmo driftwoodensis, {{the oldest}} known <b>salmon</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fossil record, helps {{scientists}} figure how the {{different species of}} salmon diverged from a common ancestor. The British Columbia salmon fossil provides evidence that the divergence between Pacific and Atlantic salmon had not yet occurred 40 million years ago. Both the fossil record and analysis of mitochondrial DNA suggest the divergence occurred by 10 to 20 million years ago. This independent evidence from DNA analysis and the fossil record rejects the glacial theory of salmon divergence.|$|E

50|$|Because the {{downstream}} McIndoe Dam posed a total {{barrier to}} both upstream fish migration <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Connecticut River, neither the Moore or Comerford dams was built with fish passage facilities.

25|$|Many sea louse {{species are}} {{specific}} {{with regard to}} host genera, for example L. salmonis which has high specificity for salmonids, including the widely farmed Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar). Lepeophtheirus salmonis can parasitize other salmonids to varying degrees, including brown trout (sea trout: Salmo trutta), Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus), and all species of Pacific <b>salmon.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> case of Pacific salmon, coho, chum, and pink salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch, O. keta, and O. gorbuscha, respectively) mount strong tissue responses to attaching L. salmonis, which lead to rejection within {{the first week of}} infection. Pacific L. salmonis can also develop, but not complete, its full life cycle on the three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus). This has not been observed with Atlantic L. salmonis.|$|E
25|$|Salmonid {{use that}} has been {{documented}} in Boeing Creek include chinook (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha), chum (Oncorhynchus keta) and coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch), and sea run coastal cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarki clarki). A study done in 1994 found juvenile coho <b>salmon</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lower portion of Boeing Creek, below the Seattle Golf Course Dam. The same study found cutthroat trout in most of Boeing Creek, up to the King County M1 R/D pond, near the creek's source. The Salmon Watchers Program have observed a site on river mile 0.1 of Boeing Creek since 2000. Coho and chum salmon are commonly seen, with fish counts ranging up to 160 chum salmon in 2003 and 89 coho salmon in 2001. Two chinook salmon were observed in 2000.|$|E
25|$|The Shasta Dam has had {{a severe}} {{negative}} effect on populations of Pacific <b>salmon</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Sacramento River watershed ever since its gates were first closed in 1943. The massive structure completely prevents salmon migration from the lower reaches of the river to the Upper Sacramento, Pit, McCloud and other tributary streams. It is estimated {{that half of the}} best salmon habitat in the Sacramento basin lies upstream of Shasta Dam. Also, the dam caused temperatures in the river to rise because it released waters from higher elevations of Shasta Lake, which are warmed by the sun far more than the surface of the original river pre-dam. Warm waters are harmful to salmon, which prefer colder temperatures, and also impact other fish populations such as steelhead and wild California trout.|$|E
