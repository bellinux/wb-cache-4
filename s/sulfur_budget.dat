In this study, we performed an integrated metagenomic and metatranscriptomic analysis on a chimney sample from Guaymas Basin to achieve a comprehensive study of each sulfur metabolic pathway and its hosting microorganisms and constructed the microbial sulfur cycle that occurs in the site. Our results clearly illustrated the stratified sulfur oxidation and sulfate reduction at the chimney wall.

Absolute flux values were determined for OCS and H 2 S, while only relative values were determined for CS 2. The rates of emission of OCS and H 2 S were observed to vary diurnally and to be strongly influenced by tides. The time-averaged flux values show that such mixed-Spartina stands are insignificant (≪ 1 %) global sources of H 2 S or CS 2 and insignificant contributors to the global OCS cycle (< 1 %).

Apparent quantum yields determined with monochromatic radiation decrease exponentially with increasing wavelength and indicate that DMS photolysis is driven by ultraviolet (UV) radiation. The relative spectral partitioning differs between samples collected from the surface mixed layer (15 m) and from the chlorophyll a maximum (80 m), presumably because of differences in chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) quality (e. g., apparent degree of bleaching). Quantum yields are also temperature dependent, and an approximate doubling of photolysis rates occurs for a 20 �C increase in temperature. The significance of DMS photolysis to upper ocean <b>sulfur</b> <b>budgets</b> is explored using a multiyear (1992 – 1994) DMS time series, concurrent irradiance determinations and temperature profiles, and estimates of CDOM absorption. Depth-integrated, mixed-layer DMS photolysis rates peak in the summer (15 – 25 �mol m� 2 d� 1) and decline to � 1 �mol m� 2 d� 1 in the winter.

40|$|The {{deep ocean}} and its sediments are a {{continuous}} source of non-methane short-chain alkanes (SCAs) including ethane, propane, and butane. Their high global warming potential, and contribution to local carbon and <b>sulfur</b> <b>budgets</b> has drawn significant scientific attention. Importantly, microbes can use gaseous alkanes and oxidize them to CO 2, thus acting as effective biofilters. A relative decrease of these gases with a concomitant 13 C enrichment of propane and n-butane in interstitial waters vs. the source suggests microbial anaerobic oxidation. The reported uncoupling of sulfate-reduction (SR) from anaerobic methane oxidation supports their microbial consumption. To date, strain BuS 5 {{isolated from the}} sediments of Guaymas Basin, Gulf of California, is the only pure culture that can anaerobically degrade propane and n-butane. This organism belongs to a metabolically diverse cluster within the Deltaproteobacteria called Desulfosarcina/Desulfococcus. Other phylotypes involved in gaseous alkane degradation were identified based on stable-isotope labeling and fluorescence in-situ hybridization. A novel syntrophic association of the archaeal genus, Candidatus Syntrophoarchaeum, and a thermophilic SR bacterium, HotSeep- 1 was recently discovered from the Guaymas basin, Gulf of California that can anaerobically oxidize n-butane. Strikingly, metagenomic data and the draft genomes of ca. Syntrophoarchaeum suggest that this organism uses a novel mechanism for n-butane oxidation, distinct from the well-established fumarate addition mechanism.

The estimation of dry depos-ition is based on both gaseous sulfur dioxide (SO 2) and particulate phase non-sea-salt sulfate (nss-SO 2 − 4) and methane sulfonate (MSA) measurements. During the dry period, deposition of SO 2 from long-range transport is the main component of anthropogenic sulfur deposition in the area. The results of the wet and dry deposition obtained at Finokalia have been compared with DMS emission from seawater obtained during two yearly surveys (1997 – 1998) in the Cretan Sea.

40|$|Since {{the first}} photogeologic {{exploration}} of Mars, vast mounds of layered sediments {{found within the}} Valles Marineris troughs (interior layered deposits, ILDs) have remained unexplained. Recent spectroscopic results showing that these materials contain coarse-grained hematite and sulfate suggest that they are fundamentally similar to layered sulfate deposits seen elsewhere on Mars, {{and are therefore a}} key piece of the global aqueous history of Mars. In this work we constrain the origin of the ILDs by considering mass balance equations. One model involving formation of the ILDs by groundwater upwelling requires that a significant fraction of the global Martian <b>sulfur</b> <b>budget</b> was concentrated in the Valles Marineris at the time when the ILDs formed. It also necessitates high deposition and erosion rates in the Hesperian. We favor an alternative model in which the ILDs formed in a configuration similar to what is observed today through atmospherically driven deposition of ice, dust, and volcanogenic sulfuric acid. Such a model is easily compatible with the global <b>sulfur</b> <b>budget,</b> and does not require significant erosion rates or large volumes of liquid water. We propose that formation of sulfate-rich layered sediments on Mars was governed through time by volcanogenic SO 2 and H 2 O emission rates and dust production against a backdrop of obliquity variation in a largely cold and dry climate. © 2012 Geological Society of America.

Global <b>sulfur</b> <b>budgets</b> from a 6 -year simulation for SO 2, sulfate, dimethylsulfide (DMS), and methanesulfonic acid (MSA) are presented in this paper. In a normal year without major volcanic perturbations, about 20 % of the sulfate precursor emission is from natural sources (biogenic and volcanic) and 80 % is anthropogenic: the same sources contribute 33 % and 67 _ respectively to the total sulfate burden. A sulfate production efficiency of 0. 41 - 0. 42 is estimated in the model, an efficiency which {{is defined as a}} ratio of the amount of sulfate produced to the total amount of SOe emitted and produced in the atmosphere. This value indicates that {{less than half of the}} SO _ entering the atmosphere contributes to the sulfate production, the rest being removed by drv and wet depositions. In a simulation for 1990, we estimate a total sulfate production of 39 Tg S yr-_. with 36 % and 64 _ respectively from in-air and in-cloud oxidation of SO 2. We also demonstrate that major volcanic eruptions, such as the Mr. Pinatubo eruption in 1991, can significantly change the sulfate formation pathways, distributions, abundance, and lifetime. Comparison with other models shows that the parameterizations for wet removal or wet production of sulfate are the most critical factors in determining the burdens of SO., and sulfate.

The requirement for sulfur will rise by a comparable level, and unless fertilizer inputs increase, more sulfur deficiency can be expected, threatening the attainment of yield targets. Management of the sulfur nutrition of rice varies {{depending on whether the}} soil is submerged throughout the crop cycle as in paddy cultivation, aerated in the root zone as in upland production systems, or intermittently flooded as in rain-fed lowland, aerobic, and water-deficit irrigation production systems. Under upland conditions, which generally use different cultivars than those grown in wetland conditions, rice attains greater rooting depth than in submerged soils. Sulfur nutrition of rice under upland conditions has much in common with that of other field crops. In submerged soil, access to sulphur is limited by the shallow root system, with > 90 % of roots confined to the top 20 cm of the soil. Low redox potential causes reduction of sulfate to sulfides, some of which are toxic (H,S), and others low in solubility (FeS, ZnS). Moreover, the slower mineralization of organically bound sulfur decreases availability of sulfur to rice in submerged soils. Hence, sulfur deficiency has increased in prevalence in wetland rice. Negative <b>sulfur</b> <b>budgets</b> have been estimated in several countries where rice is grown without sulfur fertilizers, especially when residue is removed or burned.

Contrary to SO 2, measurements of H 2 S are sparse and difficult. Here we report the first measurements of a large H 2 S plume from space. Observations were made with the infrared sounder IASI of the volcanic plume released after the 7 - 8 August 2008 eruption of Kasatochi volcano. The eruption was characterized by 5 consecutive explosive events. The first events were phreatomagmatic producing a plume rich in water vapor and poor in ash and SO 2. We show that the observed H 2 S plume, calculated at 29 ± 10 kT with integrated columns exceeding 140 ± 25 Dobson Units (DU), is likely associated with these first explosions. H 2 S:SO 2 ratios with maximum values of 12 ± 2 are found, representative of redox conditions in the hydrothermal envelop.

40|$|The cycling of {{biogenic}} volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs) within {{marine and}} terrestrial ecosystems {{has been shown}} to play an integral role in atmospheric chemistry; by influencing global climate change through the creation of cloud condensation nuclei and controlling acid-base chemistry; as well as influencing sediment chemistry including the interactions with trace metals, particularly regarding iron sulfide formation. Despite this, the examination of VSCs within Australian coastal acid sulfate soils (ASS) is an unexplored area of research. As ASS in Australia occupy an area in excess of 9 M ha, there is a clear need for a greater understanding of the cycling of these compounds within such systems. This thesis looks at the concentrations of several VSCs within agricultural and undisturbed ASS on the east coast of Australia. Initial measurements of sulfur dioxide (SO 2) were made using passive diffusion samplers, which were followed by two detailed field-based studies looking at the concentrations and fluxes of both SO 2 and hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) using flux-gradient micrometeorological techniques. These novel results indicated that this agricultural ASS was a substantial source of atmospheric H 2 S (0. 036 - 0. 056 gSm- 2 yr- 1), and SO 2 (0. 095 - 0. 31 gSm- 2 yr- 1), with flux values equating to many other salt- and freshwater marshes and swamps. The flux data also suggested that the ASS could be a continual source of H 2 S which is photo-oxidised during the daytime to SO 2. Measurements of both compounds showed separate, inverse correlations to temperature and moisture meteorological parameters indicating possible contributing and / or causal release factors. Further identification of these and other VSCs within ASS samplers was undertaken in the laboratory using gas chromatography in combination with solid-phase microextraction. Although SO 2 and H 2 S were not discovered within the headspace samples, two other VSCs important in atmospheric sulfur cycling and trace metal geochemistry were quantified; dimethylsulfide (DMS; > 300 µg/L) and ethanethiol (ESH > 4 µg/L). The measurements of H 2 S, DMS and ESH are the first quantifications with Australian ASS, and they may be important for refining regional or local atmospheric <b>sulfur</b> <b>budgets,</b> as well as interpreting previous SO 2 emissions from ASS. Ultimately this thesis further enhances our understanding of the cycling of VSCs within acid sulfate systems...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{formation}} {{of base metal}} sulfide deposits requires not only a source of metals but also reduced sulfur. If incoming sulfur is present in ore fluids as sulfate, then a source of electrons is needed to drive the reduction of sulfate to sulfide. The oxidation of organic matter can release electrons that provide the reducing capacity, whether it be in low- or high-temperature settings that are conducive to biological or thermochemical sulfate reduction (BSR or TSR). The amounts of organic matter reacted and sulfide minerals formed can be estimated by mass balance calculations. In this study, an integrated mass balance expression is formulated {{that takes into account}} the sulfide mineral content and organic carbon content and H/C ratios of mineralised and non-mineralised rocks. Model calculations based on carbon, <b>sulfur</b> and redox <b>budget</b> balances suggest that the extent of oxidation of the organic matter present at the Here’s Your Chance (HYC) Pb–Zn deposit is insufficient for reduction of the required quantity of sulfate. The results imply that externally derived reducing capacity and/or reduced sulfur is required to form the metal resource. Possible sources include hydrocarbon-rich fluids from deeper parts of the sedimentary sequence or {{formation of}} sulfide and organic matter as products of BSR during sedimentation/early diagenesis. However, the observed oxidation of organic matter associated with the deposit suggests that at least some reducing capacity is locally derived.

In this paper, on the basis of laboratory investigations, the absorption and desorption of SO, by sea water is discussed. The results of our measurements show that the ocean is an SO,-sink and presumably cannot be a direct SO,-source. The possibility of an indirect source of SO, is considered in a discussion of current literature on H,S-oxidation in ocean water. It is often assumed that cloud and rain drops, wet soils, rivers, lakes, and oceans are important sinks of the SO, emitted into the atmosphere. Although cloud and rain drops can indeed absorb SO, to a great extent, Hales et al. (1970) have shown that, under certain circumstances, some of the SO, can also be desorbed. Less well known is the absorption-desorption behavior of wet soils and oceans.

To understand the geochemical controls on sediment diagenesis, we investigated sediments in well-oxygenated temperate Lake Superior and tropical meromictic Lake Malawi.

In Lake Superior, the deep (> 4 cm) oxygenation of sediments in low-sedimentation areas regulates the remineralization rates of carbon and phosphorus, controls denitrification rates, and creates an unusual sulfur cycle driven by the oxidation of organic sulfur to sulfate. It also makes these deeply oxygenated sediments qualitatively distinct from sediments in nearshore high-sedimentation areas, necessitating their separate consideration in geochemical budgets.

The straightforward interpretation is that the Na-, K-, Cl- and S-rich components originate directly from a carbonate-chloride kimberlitic magma that is anhydrous and alkali-rich. However, because brines and evaporites are present on the Siberian craton, previous studies proposed that the kimberlitic magma was contaminated by the assimilation of salt-rich crustal rocks. To clarify the origin of high Cl, alkalies and S in this unusual kimberlite, here we determine its sulfur speciation and isotopic composition and compare it to that of non-salty kimberlites and kimberlitic breccia from the same pipe, as well as potential contamination sources (hydrothermal sulfides and sulfates, country-rock sediment and brine collected in the area). The average δ 34 S of sulfides is − 1. 4 ± 2. 2 ‰ in the salty kimberlite, 2. 1 ± 2. 7 ‰ in the non-salty kimberlites and 14. 2 ± 5. 8 ‰ in the breccia. The average δ 34 S of sulfates in the salty kimberlites is 11. 1 ± 1. 8 ‰ and 27. 3 ± 1. 6 ‰ in the breccia. In contrast, the δ 34 S of potential contaminants range from 20 to 42 ‰ for hydrothermal sulfides, from 16 to 34 ‰ for hydrothermal sulfates, 34 ‰ for a country-rock sediment (Chukuck suite) and the regional brine aquifer. Our isotope analyses show that (1) in the salty kimberlites, neither sulfates nor sulfides can be simply explained by brine infiltration, hydrothermal alteration or the assimilation of known salt-rich country rocks and instead, we propose that they are late magmatic phases; (2) in the non-salty kimberlite and breccia, brine infiltration lead to sulfate reduction and the formation of secondary sulfides – this explains the removal of salts, alkali-carbonates and sulfates, as well as the minor olivine serpentinization; (3) hydrothermal sulfur was added to the kimberlitic breccia, but not to the massive kimberlites. In situ measurements of sulfides confirm this scenario, clearly showing the addition of two sulfide populations in the breccia (pyrite-pyrrhotites with average δ 34 S of 7. 9 ± 3. 4 ‰ and chalcopyrites with average δ 34 S of 38. 0 ± 0. 4 ‰) whereas the salty and non-salty kimberlites preserve a unique population of djerfisherites (Cl- and K-rich sulfides) with δ 34 S values within the mantle range. This study provides the first direct evidence of alkaline igneous rocks in which magmatic sulfate is more abundant than sulfide. Although sulfates have been rarely reported in mantle materials, sulfate-rich melts may be more common in the mantle than previously thought and could balance the <b>sulfur</b> isotope <b>budget</b> of Earth's mantle...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2017 - 12 Sulfur and {{reactive}} halogens are {{key components}} in tropospheric chemistry and the radiation {{budget of the}} Earth. Tropospheric <b>sulfur</b> and halogen <b>budgets</b> are still not well constrained. Laboratory and modeling studies have revealed {{the important role of}} halogen species in the tropospheric sulfur cycle, such as the oxidation of dimethyl sulfide (DMS) by XO and the oxidation of S(IV) by HOX (X=Cl, Br and I). However, the feedbacks of sulfur-halogen interactions on the halogen cycle have raised little attention. My Ph. D. research involves laboratory measurements and model developments to understand the interaction between sulfur and reactive halogens (especially bromine) in the troposphere, and implications for the global sulfur and reactive bromine budgets. In the first part my Ph. D. project (Chapter 2), I measured oxygen isotopes of sulfate (Δ 17 O) collected in the remote marine boundary layer (MBL), which reveal the signature of sulfate formed via aqueous-phase oxidation of S(IV) by HOX. Assisted by the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model, we calculated that HOX are responsible for 33 - 50 % of sulfate formation in the remote Southern Hemisphere MBL during spring and summer. This provides the first observational constraint on the contribution of reactive halogens to sulfate aerosol formation. In the second part of my Ph. D. project (Chapter 3), I implemented HOBr+S(IV) reaction into GEOS-Chem to evaluate the contribution of this reaction to both sulfate production and reactive bromine (Bry) removal in the troposphere for the first time. This reaction reduces the global reactive bromine burden by 50 % and contributes to significant sulfate formation even at sub-ppt levels of HOBr. The reduction in Bry resulting from HOBr+S(IV) has implication for the oxidative capacity of the atmosphere through the increase in O 3 and OH abundances. In the third part of my Ph. D. project (Chapter 4), I explored another aspect of tropospheric sulfur-halogen interactions: oxidation of DMS by BrO and Cl radicals. I added 2 new sulfur intermediates dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and methane sulphinic acid (MSIA) as well as 12 new reactions in GEOS-Chem involving the formation of sulfate and methane sulfonic acid (MSA) from the oxidation of DMS in both the gas- and aqueous-phase. BrO and Cl account for 12 % and 4 % of global DMS oxidation, respectively, with large uncertainties stemming from uncertainties in tropospheric BrO and Cl abundances. Multiphase chemistry in cloud droplets and aerosols is critical for the production and removal of MSA in the troposphere. Our updates decrease the conversion yield of DMS to SO 2 from 91 % to 78 % and increase the conversion yield of DMS to MSA from 9 % to 13 %. We suggest that previous climate models with simplified DMS oxidation scheme (gas-phase oxidation by OH and NO 3 only) may overestimate SO 2 and sulfate production in the pre-industrial environment, potentially leading to underestimates in sulfate aerosol radiative forcing calculations in climate models, and that MSA may not be a good ice-core proxy for DMS emissions from sea ice melt. The large uncertainties on reactive halogen abundances are the largest impediment for our understanding of tropospheric sulfur-halogen interactions. To improve our understanding of MBL sulfur chemistry, we need to prioritize measurements of reactive halogen abundances, especially in the marine boundary layer...|$|R

Satellite measurements yield order of magnitude lower sulfur (~ 0. 2 Tg) in the eruption plume than estimated from the difference between MI and the groundmass glass. This sulfur "deficit" is readily explained by sulfur adhering to tephra grains but principally by sulfide globules caused by basalt-sulfide melt exsolution before degassing.

40|$|Measurements of SO 2 {{mixing ratio}} {{in the upper}} {{troposphere}} and lower stratosphere have been performed with a sensitive chemiluminescence method which permits the detection of atmospheric SO 2 traces below 10 pptv. Results of 9 aircraft ascents over Europe from 1978 - 1980 are reported. It is shown that the meteorological conditions at the tropopause level have an important influence on the observed SO 2 mixing ratio. The weak vertical SO 2 gradients in the upper troposphere suggest only a small flux of tropospheric SO 2 into the stratosphere. Furthermore, increasing SO 2 mixing ratios within the first kilometers of the stratosphere give strong support to a stratospheric SO 2 source due to the oxidation of organic sulfur compounds (COS, CS 2).

(Jonas et al., 1995, Zhang et al., 1994, Dentener et al. 1996). Diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) has been used to sensitively probe the condensed phase during heterogeneous reaction of nitrogen oxide compounds with mineral dust and to determine the uptake kinetics (Bö rensen et al., 2000). During exposure to SO 2 and O 3 the formation of- 23 SO and subsequently- 2 4 SO was observed on the surface. The reaction order is determined from a quantitative kinetic evaluation of a series of experiments with variable concentrations of SO 2 and a constant concentration of O 3.

40|$|We present here new {{measurements}} {{of sulfur dioxide}} and hydrogen sulfide emissions from Vulcano, Etna, and Stromboli (Italy), made by direct sampling at vents and by filter pack and ultraviolet spectroscopy in downwind plumes. Measurements at the F 0 and FA fumaroles on Vulcano yielded SO 2 /H 2 S molar ratios of 0. 38 and 1. 4, respectively, from which we estimate an H 2 S flux of 6 to 9 for the summit crater. For Mt. Etna and Stromboli, we found SO 2 /H 2 S molar ratios of 20 and 15, respectively, which combined with SO 2 flux measurements, suggest H 2 S emission rates of 50 to 113 and 4 to 8, respectively. We observe that source and plume SO 2 /H 2 S ratios at Vulcano are similar, suggesting that hydrogen sulfide is essentially inert on timescales of seconds to minutes.

Elevated ? 34 S (26. 2 ‰– 29. 0 ‰) and ? 18 O values (12. 5 ‰– 14. 4 ‰) of gypsum {{compared to those}} of seawater sulfate {{are the result of}} microbial sulfate reduction. Low organic carbon contents and little sulfate reduction in sediments, plus a large basaltic Sr component in the gypsum (87 Sr/ 86 Sr = 0. 70446 – 0. 70524), indicate that the sulfate source was not pore waters in the overlying sediment. Low ? 34 S values of sulfide in basalt lavas are consistent with microbial reduction of seawater sulfate within the volcanic rocks. Tectonic activity at the slow-spreading ridge allowed evolved formation waters to enter hot sheeted-dike complex basement, resulting in heating and precipitation of anhydrite.

40|$|The {{atmospheric}} <b>sulfur</b> <b>budget</b> for Northern Europe {{is discussed}} and compared with global averages. It is {{found that in}} this area the anthropogenic sulfur sources out-weight natural sources. A comparison between deposition and emission of sulfur within different regions in Northern Europe shows that the dispersion of sulfur has a continental character; i. e. since, on average, sulfur is transported more than 1 000 km before it is deposited, one country can be appreciably influenced by another, in this respect. A tentative model for the variation of deposition with distance from a source is suggested. Application of this model gives an estimated turnover time for anthro-pogenic sulfur of 2 - 4 days. As B quantitative example, the distribution between various sources of the sulfur deposition in Sweden has been estimated. The calculations indicate {{that about half of}} the sulfur originates from foreign anthropogenic emissions, whilst the other half is caused by Swedish emissions and a natural background. Just as Sweden is influenced by the surrounding industrial countries, it is furthermore clear that {{a large part of the}} sulfur emitted in Sweden is deposited outside the country. 1...|$|E
40|$|Sulfur {{appears to}} be {{depleted}} by {{an order of magnitude}} or more from its elemental abundance in star-forming regions. In the last few years, numerous observations and experiments have been performed in order to to understand the reasons behind this depletion without providing a satisfactory explanation of the sulfur chemistry towards high-mass star-forming cores. Several sulfur-bearing molecules have been observed in these regions, and yet none are abundant enough to make up the gas-phase deficit. Where, then, does this hidden sulfur reside? This paper represents a step forward in our understanding of the interactions among the various S-bearing species. We have incorporated recent experimental and theoretical data into a chemical model of a hot molecular core in order to see whether they give any indication of the identity of the sulfur sink in these dense regions. Despite our model producing reasonable agreement with both solid-phase and gas-phase abundances of many sulfur-bearing species, we find that the sulfur residue detected in recent experiments takes up only ~ 6 per cent of the available sulfur in our simulations, rather than dominating the <b>sulfur</b> <b>budget.</b> Comment: 13 pages, 6 colourful figures, accepted by MNRA...|$|E

However, {{little is known about the}} oxidation of dissolved SO_ 2 by peroxymonosulfate (HSO_ 5 ^-). We have found in aqueous solution that the rate of S(IV) oxidation is comparable to the rate of oxidation of S(IV) by hydrogen peroxide and that HSO_ 4 ^- is the only detectable oxidation product. We propose a mechanism in which the rate-determining step involves the acid-catalyzed decomposition of a peroxide-bisulfite intermediate to disulfate ion, S 2 _ 7 O^(2 -), and ultimately to sulfuric acid. The rate equation for this mechanism is -d[HSO_ 3 ^-]/dr = k_ 1 (k_ 2 /k_(- 1)) K_(a 1) H^+[HSO_ 5 ^-][S(IV+) ]/(1 + (k_ 2 /k_(- 1) H^+) (k_(al) + H+))), where k_ 1 = 1. 21 x 10 ^ 6 M^(- 1) s^(- 1), k_ 2 /k_(- 1) = 5. 9 M^(- 1), k_ 1 k_ 2 /k^(- 1) = 7. 14 x 10 ^ 6 M^(- 2) s^(- 1), K_(a 1) = 2. 64 x 10 ^(- 2) M at 5 ºC, and µ = 0. 2 M.

40|$|Improvements to {{peroxide}} oxidation {{methods for}} analysing acid sulfate soils (ASS) are introduced. The soil solution ratio has been increased to 1 : 40, titrations are performed in suspension, and {{the duration of}} the peroxide digest stage is substantially shortened. For 9 acid sulfate soils, the peroxide oxidisable sulfur value obtained using the improved method was compared with the reduced inorganic sulfur result obtained using the chromium reducible sulfur method. Their regression was highly significant, the slope of the regression line was not significantly different (P = 0. 05) from unity, and the intercept not significantly different from zero. A complete <b>sulfur</b> <b>budget</b> for the improved method showed there was no loss of sulfur as has been reported for earlier peroxide oxidation techniques. When soils were very finely ground, efficient oxidation of sulfides was achieved, despite the milder digestion conditions. Highly sulfidic and organic soils were shown to be the most difficult to analyse using either the improved method or the chromium method. No single analytical method can be universally applied to all ASS, rather a suite of methods is necessary for a thorough understanding of many ASS.

40|$|The {{infrared}} (IR) {{spectra of}} many evolved carbon-rich stars exhibit two prominent dust emission features peaking around 21 um and 30 um, {{with the former}} exclusively seen in proto-planetary nebulae (PPNe), while the latter seen in a much wider range of objects, including AGB stars, PPNe and planetary nebulae (PNe). The 30 um feature is seen in all the 21 um sources, but no correlation is found between these two features. Over a dozen carrier candidates have been proposed for the 21 um feature, {{but none of them}} has been widely accepted {{and the nature of the}} 21 um feature remains a mystery. The carrier of the 30 um feature also remains unidentied. MgS dust, once widely accepted as a valid carrier, was ruled out because of the <b>sulfur</b> <b>budget</b> problem. In this work we examine nano-sized FeO dust as a carrier for the 21 um feature. We calculate the IR emission spectrum of FeO nanodust which undergoes single-photon heating in PPNe. It is found that the 21 um feature emitted by FeO nanodust is too broad to explain the observed feature. For the 30 um feature, we argue that graphite could be a viable carrier.
