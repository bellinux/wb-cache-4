We fit new HST/STIS and archival data with axisymmetric orbit models to determine M, mass-to-light ratio (ϒV), and dark matter halo profile. The best-fit model parameters with 1 σ uncertainties are M = (6. 0 + 0. 7 − 0. 9) × 108 M and ϒV = 6. 0 ± 0. 2 M L− 1,V at an assumed distance of 46 Mpc. The models are inconsistent with no black hole at a significance of ∆χ 2 = 15. 4 and require a dark matter halo to adequately fit the kinematic data, but the fits are consistent with a large range of plausible dark matter halo parameters. The ring is inconsistent with a population of co-rotating stars on circular orbits, which would produce a narrow line-of-sight velocity distribution (LOSVD). Instead, the ring’s LOSVD has a small value of |V |/σ, the ratio of mean velocity to velocity dispersion. Based on the observed low |V |/σ, our orbit modeling, and a kinematic decomposition of the ring from the bulge, we conclude that the <b>stellar</b> <b>ring</b> contains stars that orbit in both directions.

We incorporate the feedback into the dynamical equations through mass dropout and angular momentum transportation {{driven by the}} SNexp-excited turbulent viscosity. We numerically solve the equations and show {{that there can be}} intensive evolution of structure of the gaseous disk. Secular evolution of the disk shows interesting characteristics that are 1) high viscosity excited by SNexp can efficiently transport the gas from 10 kpc to ∼ 1 kpc forming a stellar disk whereas a <b>stellar</b> <b>ring</b> forms for the case with low viscosity; 2) starbursts trigger SMBH activity with a lag ∼ 10 ^ 8 yr depending on star formation rates, prompting the joint evolution of SMBHs and bulges; 3) the velocity dispersion is as high as ∼ 100 in the gaseous disk. In order to compare the present models with the observed dynamical structure and images, we use the incident continuum from the simple stellar synthesis (GALAXEV) and CLOUDY to calculate emission line ratios of Hα, Hβ, and, and Hα brightness of gas photoionized by young massive stars formed on the disks. The models can produce the main features of emission from star forming galaxies and the observed relation between turbulent velocity and the Hα brightness. We successfully apply the present model to BX 389 and BX 482 observed in SINS high-z sample, which are bulge and disk-dominated, respectively. High viscosity excited by SNexp is able to efficiently transport the gas into a bulge to maintain high star formation rates, or, to form a <b>stellar</b> <b>ring</b> close enough to the bulge so that it immigrates into the bulge of its host galaxy. This leads to a fast growing bulge. Implications and future work of the present models have been extensively discussed for galaxy formation.

40|$|ESO 381 - 47 is {{an early}} type galaxy with an {{extended}} HI disk. GALEX and very deep optical images reveal a distinct <b>stellar</b> <b>ring</b> far outside the optical body with a diameter of ~ 30 kpc, which has undergone recent star formation at 1. 8 x 10 ^- 4 Msun/yr/kpc^- 2, consistent with other new results which detect low level star formation below the traditional Kennicutt relation in the outer parts of spiral galaxies. The morphology of this galaxy resembles the recently identified class of ultraviolet objects called extended ultraviolet disks, or XUV-disks. New HI observations of this galaxy taken at the ATCA and in the CnB array at the VLA show that the cold gas lies in an extended (diameter ~ 90 kpc) ring around the central S 0 galaxy. The HI data cube can be well modeled by a warped ring. The faint ionized gas in the inner parts of the galaxy is kinematically decoupled from the stars and instead appears to exhibit velocities consistent with {{the rotation of the}} HI ring at larger radius. The peak of the <b>stellar</b> <b>ring,</b> as seen in the optical and UV, is slightly displaced to the inside relative to the peak of the HI ring. We discuss the manner in which this offset could be caused by the propagation of a radial density wave through an existing stellar disk, perhaps triggered by a galaxy collision {{at the center of the}} disk, or possibly due to a spiral density wave set up at early times in a disk too hot to form a stellar bar. Gas accretion and resonance effects due to a bar which has since dissolved are also considered to explain the presence of the star forming ring seen in the GALEX and deep optical data.

The latter apparently coincides with the position of the molecular ring. The abrupt end in the steep increment in the absorption is likely the result of gas consumption by star formation.

40|$|We {{show that}} {{dynamical}} relaxation {{in the aftermath}} of a galactic merger and the ensuing formation and decay of a binary massive black hole (MBH), are dominated by massive perturbers (MPs) such as giant molecular clouds or clusters. MPs accelerate relaxation by orders of magnitude relative to 2 -body stellar relaxation alone, and efficiently scatter stars into the binary MBH’s orbit. The 3 -body star–binary MBH interactions shrink the binary MBH to the point where energy losses from the emission of gravitational waves (GW) lead to rapid coalescence. We model this process based on observed and simulated MP distributions and take into account the decreased efficiency of the star-binary MBH interaction due to acceleration in the galactic potential. We show that mergers of gas-rich galactic nuclei lead to binary MBH coalescence well within the Hubble time. Moreover, lowermass binary MBHs (< 10 8 M⊙) require only a few percent of the typical gas mass in a post-merger nucleus to coalesce in a Hubble time. The fate of a binary MBH in a gas poor galactic merger is less certain, although massive stellar structures (e. g. clusters, <b>stellar</b> <b>rings)</b> could likewise lead to efficient coalescence. These coalescence events are observable by their strong GW emission. MPs thus increase the cosmic rate of such GW events, lead to a higher mass deficit in the merged galactic core and suppress the formation of triple MBH systems and the resulting ejection of MBHs into intergalactic space.

40|$|Orientation of parsec-scale {{accretion}} disks in AGN {{is likely}} to be nearly random for different black hole feeding episodes. Since AGN accretion disks are unstable to self-gravity on parsec scales, star formation in these disks will create young stellar disks, similar to those recently discovered in our Galactic Center. The disks blend into the quasi-spherical star cluster enveloping the AGN on time scales much longer than a likely AGN lifetime. Therefore, the gravitational potential within the radius of the black hole influence is at best axi-symmetric rather than spherically symmetric.

For the simplest case of a potential resulting from a thin <b>stellar</b> <b>ring,</b> we calculate the disk precession rates, and the time dependent shape.

40|$|We present new N-body, hydrodynamical {{simulations}} {{of the interaction}} between the starburst galaxy NGC 7714 and its post-starburst companion NGC 7715, focusing on the formation of the collisional features, including: 1) the gas-rich star forming bridge, 2) the large gaseous loop (and stellar tails) {{to the west of the}} system, 3) the very extended HI tail to the west and north of NGC 7714, and 4) the partial <b>stellar</b> <b>ring</b> in NGC 7714. Our simulations confirm the results of earlier work that an off-center inclined collision between two disk galaxies is almost certainly responsible for the peculiar morphologies of this system. However, we have explored a wider set of initial galaxy and collisional encounter parameters than previously, and have found a relatively narrow range of parameters that reproduce all the major morphologies of this system. The simulations suggest specific mechanisms for the development of several unusual structures. We find that the complex gas bridge has up to four distinct components, with gas contributed from two sides of NGC 7715, as well as from NGC 7714. The observed gas-star offset in this bridge is accounted for in the simulations by the dissipative evolution of the gas. The models suggest that the most recently formed gas bridge component from NGC 7715 is interacting wit...|$|E
40|$|We {{studied the}} colliding galaxy NGC 7714 with two XMM-Newton observations, six months apart. The galaxy {{contains}} two bright X-ray sources: {{we show that}} they have different physical nature. The off-nuclear source is an accreting compact object, {{one of the brightest}} ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) found to date. It showed spectral and luminosity changes between the two observations, from a low/soft to a high/hard state; in the high state, it reached L_x ~ 6 x 10 ^{ 40 } erg/s. Its lightcurve in the high state suggests variability on a ~ 2 -hr timescale. Its peculiar location, where the tidal bridge between NGC 7714 and NGC 7715 joins the outer <b>stellar</b> <b>ring</b> of NGC 7714, makes it an interesting example of the connection between gas flows in colliding galaxies and ULX formation. The nuclear source (L_x ~ 10 ^{ 41 } erg/s) coincides with a starburst region, and is the combination of thin thermal plasma emission and a point-source contribution (with a power-law spectrum). Variability in the power-law component between the two observations hints at the presence of a single, bright point source (L_x >~ 3 x 10 ^{ 40 } erg/s) : either a hidden AGN or another ULX.

40|$|Abstract. The {{recently}} discovered ring of stars near Galactocentric distance r = 20 kpc is interpreted as baryonic matter accreted onto the second caustic ring {{of dark matter}} in our galaxy. Caustic rings of dark matter were predicted in the Galactic plane at radii an ≃ 40 kpc/n where n = 1, 2, 3 [...] . They can reveal themselves by their gravitational influence {{on the distribution of}} baryonic matter. There is additional evidence for caustic rings of dark matter in the Milky Way from a series of sharp rises in the Galactic rotation curve. The positions of the rises are consistent at the 3 % level with the above law for the caustic ring radii. Also, a triangular feature in the IRAS map of the galactic plane is consistent with the imprint of the caustic ring of dark matter nearest to us (n = 5) upon dust and gas in the Galactic plane. These observations imply that the dark matter in our neighborhood is dominated by a single flow whose density and velocity vector are estimated. 1 A Giant <b>Stellar</b> <b>Ring</b> in the Milky Way Plane Recently the discovery was announced of {{what appears to be a}} ring of stars, with radius of order 20 kpc, circling the Galaxy [1, 2, 3].

40|$|We {{present results}} from an imaging survey of an {{unbiased}} sample of thirty-eight early-type (S 0 [...] Sa), low-inclination, optically barred {{galaxies in the}} field. Our goal was to find and characterize central stellar and gaseous structures: secondary bars, inner disks, and nuclear rings. Bars inside bars are surprisingly common: at least {{one quarter of the}} sample galaxies (possibly as many as 40 %) are double-barred, with no preference for Hubble type or the strength of the primary bar. A typical secondary bar is ~ 12 % of the size of its primary bar and 240 [...] 750 pc in radius. We see no significant effect of secondary bars on nuclear activity. We also find kiloparsec-scale inner disks in at least 20 % of our sample, almost exclusively in S 0 galaxies. These disks are on average 20 % the size of their host bar, and show a wider range of relative sizes than do secondary bars. Nuclear rings are present in about a third of our sample. Most are dusty, sites of current or recent star formation, or both; such rings are preferentially found in Sa galaxies. Three S 0 galaxies (15 % of the S 0 's) appear to have purely <b>stellar</b> nuclear <b>rings,</b> with no evidence for dust or recent star formation. The fact that these central stellar structures are so common indicates that the inner regions of early-type barred galaxies typically contain dynamically cool and disklike structures. This is especially true for S 0 galaxies, where secondary bars, inner disks, and/or <b>stellar</b> nuclear <b>rings</b> are present at least two thirds of the time.

40|$|Sgr A* is extra-ordinarily dim in all {{wavelengths}} {{requiring a}} very low accretion rate at the present time. However, at a radial distance of {{a fraction of a}} parsec from Sgr A*, two rings populated by young massive stars suggest a recent burst of star formation in a rather hostile environment. Here we explore two ways of creating such young <b>stellar</b> <b>rings</b> with a gaseous accretion disk: by self-gravity in a massive disk, and by capturing "old" low mass stars and growing them via gas accretion in a disk. The minimum disk mass is above 10 ^ 4 M_ for the first mechanism and is few tens of times larger for the second one. The observed relatively small velocity dispersion of the stars rules out disks more massive than around 10 ^ 5 M_: heavier stellar or gas disks would warp each other too strongly by orbital precession in an axisymmetric potential. The capture of "old" stars by a disk is thus unlikely as the origin of the young stellar disks. The absence of a massive nuclear gas disk in Sgr A* now implies that the disk was either accreted by the SMBH, which would then imply almost a quasar-like luminosity for Sgr A*, or was consumed in the star formation episode. The latter possibility appears to be more likely on theoretical grounds. We also consider whether accretion disk plane changes, expected to occur due to fluctuations in the angular momentum of gas infalling into the central parsec of a galaxy, would dislodge the embedded stars from the disk midplane. We find that the stars leave the disk midplane only if the disk orientation changes on time scales much shorter than the disk viscous time. Peer-reviewedPublisher Version 830...|$|R
40|$|We {{construct}} {{models of}} highly-inclined ("polar") rings in an external potential including both self [...] gravity and dissipation {{due to a}} drag force. We adopt the oblate spheroidal scale [...] free logarithmic potential with axis ratio q= 0. 85 and an initial inclination of 80 ^∘ for the self [...] gravitating <b>rings.</b> <b>Stellar</b> (dissipationless) <b>rings</b> suffer from mass loss during their evolution which drives a secular change of the mean inclination toward the poles of the potential. As much as half of the ring mass escapes {{in the process and}} forms an inner and an outer shell of precessing orbits. If the remaining mass is more than ∼ 0. 02 of the enclosed galaxy mass, rings remain bound and and are not destroyed by differential precession. The rings precess at a constant rate for more than a precession period τ_p finding the configuration predicted by Sparke in 1986 which warps at larger radii toward the poles of the potential. We model shear viscosity with a velocity-dependent drag force and find that nuclear inflow dominates over self [...] gravity if the characteristic viscous inflow time scale τ_vi is shorter than ∼ 25 τ_p. Rings with τ_vi/τ_p 25 collapse toward the nucleus of the potential within one precession period independent of the amount of self [...] gravity. Our results imply that stars and gas in real polar rings exhibit markedly different dynamical evolutions.
