(2003) provide one case, an 11-year-old child who temporarily damaged her eyesight by holding an approximately 5mW red laser pointer close to the eye and staring into the beam for 10 seconds, she experienced scotoma (a blind spot) but fully recovered after three months. Luttrull & Hallisey (1999) describe a similar case, a 34-year-old male who <b>stared</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> beam of a classIIIa 5mW red laser for 30 to 60 seconds, causing temporary central scotoma and visual field loss. His eyesight fully recovered within two days, {{at the time of his}} eye exam. An intravenous fundus fluorescein angiogram, a technique used by ophthalmologists to visualise the retina of the eye in fine detail, identified subtle discoloration of the fovea.|$|E
2500|$|Case 8. This case {{illustrates}} {{that children with}} Panayiotopoulos syndrome may be misdiagnosed and treated for encephalitis. This boy had a first seizure at age 4 years and 2 months. Whilst sleeping in his mother’s lap, he suddenly vomited. Then his eyes <b>stared</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> space upwards, his head deviated to the right, his face turned green and he became incontinent of urine and faeces. The seizure lasted for 15 min {{and there were no}} convulsions. Abdominal ultrasound performed because of the vomiting was normal. A second seizure occurred 16 months later at age 5 years and 6 months. At around 10 in the morning he walked into lounge looking pale and irritable. He fell to the floor and developed writhing movements, shaking arms and legs, hypersalivation and incontinence of urine. Convulsions stopped 15 min later with rectal diazepam. He recovered but remained very sleepy. He was febrile ~38.5°C. He was treated in a major teaching hospital with triple therapy for suspected encephalitis but in the third day after admission this was stopped and he was discharged home. Brain CT scan, EEG and CSF were normal. [...] Subsequent EEGs showed infrequent occipital and frontal spikes. [...] At follow-up aged 7, he was normal and had experienced no further seizures.|$|E

60|$|Vigorous puffs, and a {{resolute}} <b>stare</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> grate, declared {{he had no}} ear {{for this}} appeal. The housekeeper and Hareton were invisible; one gone on an errand, and the other at his work, probably. We knew Linton's tones, and entered.|$|R
60|$|Katharine stirred her spoon {{round and}} round, <b>stared</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> swirl of the tea, and {{remained}} silent. Mr. Clacton, meanwhile, framed a question which, after a moment's hesitation, he put to Katharine.|$|E
