3000|$|A locally {{integrable}} {{and positive}} function defined on R^n is <b>said</b> <b>to</b> be a <b>weight.</b> We write [...] w(E):=∫_E w(x) [...] dx [...] for a weight w and a measurable set E.|$|R

A <b>weight</b> ω is <b>said</b> <b>to</b> be an A_p(μ) weight if ω satisfies the following definition.|$|R
25|$|The {{operational}} definition, as usually given, {{does not}} explicitly exclude {{the effects of}} buoyancy, which reduces the measured weight of an object when it is immersed in a fluid such as air or water. As a result, a floating balloon or an object floating in water might be <b>said</b> <b>to</b> have zero <b>weight.</b>|$|R

With this company, Gregory made {{efforts to improve the}} life expectancy of African Americans, which he believes is being hindered by poor nutrition and drug and alcohol abuse. In 1985, Gregory introduced the [...] "Slim-Safe Bahamian Diet", a powdered-diet mix. He launched the weight-loss powder at the Whole Life Expo in Boston under the slogan [...] "It's cool to be healthy". The diet mix, drunk three times a day, was <b>said</b> <b>to</b> provide rapid <b>weight</b> loss. Gregory received a multimillion-dollar distribution contract to retail the diet.|$|R
50|$|Sometimes {{a conference}} matrix of order n is just {{defined as a}} {{weighing}} matrix of the form W(n, n−1), whereW(n,w) is <b>said</b> <b>to</b> be of <b>weight</b> w>0 and order n {{if it is a}} square matrix of size n with entries from {−1, 0, +1} satisfying W Wt = w I. Using this definition, the zero element is no more required to be on the diagonal, but {{it is easy to see}} that still there must be exactly one zero element in each row and column. For example, the matrixwould satisfy this relaxed definition, but not the more strict one requiring the zero elements to be on the diagonal.|$|R
50|$|Weight and Balance:When {{the weight}} of the {{aircraft}} is at or below the allowable limit(s) for its configuration (parked, ground movement, take-off, landing, etc.) and its center of gravity is within the allowable range, and both will remain so {{for the duration of the}} flight, the aircraft is <b>said</b> <b>to</b> be within <b>weight</b> and balance. Different maximum weights may be defined for different situations; for example, large aircraft may have maximum landing weights that are lower than maximum take-off weights (because some <b>weight</b> is expected <b>to</b> be lost as fuel is burned during the flight). The center of gravity may change over the duration of the flight as the aircraft's <b>weight</b> changes due <b>to</b> fuel burn or by passengers moving forward or aft in the cabin.|$|R
60|$|The plains abound {{with three}} kinds of {{partridge}}, {{two of which are}} as large as hen pheasants. (6/3. Two species of Tinamus and Eudromia elegans of A. d'Orbigny, which can only be called a partridge with regard to its habits.) Their destroyer, a small and pretty fox, was also singularly numerous; {{in the course of the}} day we could not have seen less than forty or fifty. They were generally near their earths, but the dogs killed one. When we returned to the posta, we found two of the party returned who had been hunting by themselves. They had killed a puma, and had found an ostrich's nest with twenty-seven eggs in it. Each of these is <b>said</b> <b>to</b> equal in <b>weight</b> eleven hens' eggs; so that we obtained from this one nest as much food as 297 hens' eggs would have given.|$|R
2500|$|Galileo's {{early studies}} at the University of Pisa were in medicine, but he was soon drawn to {{mathematics}} and physics. At 19, he discovered (and, subsequently, verified) the [...] nature of the pendulum when, using his pulse, he timed the oscillations of a swinging lamp in Pisa's cathedral {{and found that it}} remained the same for each swing regardless of the swing's amplitude. He soon became known through his invention of a hydrostatic balance and for his treatise on the center of gravity of solid bodies. While teaching at the University of Pisa (1589–92), he initiated his experiments concerning the laws of bodies in motion that brought results so contradictory to the accepted teachings of Aristotle that strong antagonism was aroused. He found that bodies do not fall with velocities proportional <b>to</b> their <b>weights.</b> The famous story in which Galileo is <b>said</b> <b>to</b> have dropped <b>weights</b> from the Leaning Tower of Pisa is apocryphal, but he did find that the path of a projectile is a parabola and is credited with conclusions that anticipated Newton's laws of motion (e.g. the notion of inertia). Among these is what is now called Galilean relativity, the first precisely formulated statement about properties of space and time outside three-dimensional geometry.|$|R

50|$|The chapel is <b>said</b> <b>to</b> {{have once}} been built over a spring. Its {{location}} {{at the lowest}} place in the village lends <b>weight</b> <b>to</b> this story.

50|$|As {{the name}} vers libre suggests, this {{technique}} of using more irregular cadences is often <b>said</b> <b>to</b> {{be derived from}} the practices of 19th-century French poets such as Gustave Kahn and Jules Laforgue in his Derniers vers of 1890. Taupin, the USA based French poet/critic concluded that free verse and vers libre are not synonymous, since 'The French language tends <b>to</b> give equal <b>weight</b> <b>to</b> each spoken syllable, whereas English syllables vary in quantity according to whether stressed or unstressed'.|$|R
2500|$|In physics, a {{force is}} <b>said</b> <b>to</b> do work if, when acting, {{there is a}} {{displacement}} of the point of application {{in the direction of}} the force.

Raised lettering on the insulation. A place he had never been." [...] This is an allusion to Child's first book, Killing Floor, in which he travels to Margrave, Georgia, looking for the town in which Blind Blake (a favourite musician of both Reacher and his brother, Joe) is <b>said</b> <b>to</b> have died.
