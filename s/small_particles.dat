Proposes calculations of <b>smallest</b> <b>particle</b> radius possible in the universe and to calculate the limit of maximum energy any particle can attain using Planck Maxwell and Einstein’s equations along with some fundamental assumptions. This theory shows that the equations involved for calculation of Energy of the <b>smallest</b> <b>particle</b> derived from only of Physical Constants. This information may help lead to the fundamental question of where the universe began and might lead to new discoveries...|$|R
40|$|This {{invention}} {{relates to}} a <b>small</b> <b>particle</b> selective emitter for converting thermal energy into narrow band radiation with high efficiency. The <b>small</b> <b>particle</b> selective emitter {{is used in}} combination with a photovoltaic array to provide a thermal to electrical energy conversion device. An energy conversion apparatus of this type is called a thermo-photovoltaic device. In the first embodiment, <b>small</b> diameter <b>particles</b> of a rare earth oxide are suspended in an inert gas enclosed between concentric cylinders. The rare earth oxides are used {{because they have the}} desired property of large emittance in a narrow wavelength band and small emittance outside the band. However, it should be emphasized that it is the smallness of the particles that enhances the radiation property. The <b>small</b> <b>particle</b> selective emitter is surrounded by a photovoltaic array. In an alternate embodiment, the <b>small</b> <b>particle</b> gas mixture is circulated through a thermal energy source. This thermal energy source can be a nuclear reactor, solar receiver, or combustor of a fossil fuel...|$|R

Increasing in concentration of salt, which is used for impregnation of the ion-exchanger before precipitation (increase of [Cat^+]_ad), and decreasing in acid (precipitator) concentration also cause precipitation of <b>smaller</b> <b>particles</b> inside the polymer.|$|R
5|$|The {{painted turtle}} hunts along water bottoms. It quickly juts its head {{into and out}} of {{vegetation}} to stir potential victims out into the open water, where they are pursued. The turtle holds large prey in its mouth and tears the prey apart with its forefeet. It also consumes plants and skims {{the surface of the water}} with its mouth open to catch <b>small</b> <b>particles</b> of food.|$|E
5|$|When prey is swallowed, it is {{liquefied}} in the pharynx by enzymes and by muscular contractions of the pharynx. The resulting slurry is wafted {{through the}} canal system by {{the beating of}} the cilia, and digested by the nutritive cells. The ciliary rosettes in the canals may help to transport nutrients to muscles in the mesoglea. The anal pores may eject unwanted <b>small</b> <b>particles,</b> but most unwanted matter is regurgitated via the mouth.|$|E
5|$|In general, in the Solar System, {{planetary}} {{formation is}} thought to have occurred via a process comparable to the long-standing nebular hypothesis: a cloud of interstellar dust and gas collapsed under the influence of gravity to form a rotating disc of material that then further condensed to form the Sun and planets. During the first few million years of the Solar System's history, an accretion process of sticky collisions caused the clumping of <b>small</b> <b>particles,</b> which gradually increased in size. Once the clumps reached sufficient mass, they could draw in other bodies through gravitational attraction and become planetesimals. This gravitational accretion {{led to the formation of}} the planets.|$|E

5|$|Many sunscreens use {{nanoparticles}} of {{zinc oxide}} (along with nanoparticles of titanium dioxide) because such <b>small</b> <b>particles</b> do not scatter light and therefore {{do not appear}} white. There has been concern {{that they might be}} absorbed into the skin. A study published in 2010 found a 0.23% to 1.31% (mean 0.42%) of blood zinc levels in venous blood samples could be traced to zinc from ZnO nanoparticles applied to human skin for 5 days, and traces were also found in urine samples. In contrast, a comprehensive review of the medical literature from 2011 says that no evidence of systemic absorption {{can be found in the}} literature.|$|E
5|$|Probably {{the most}} {{important}} ecological characteristic of abyssal ecosystems is energy limitation. Abyssal seafloor communities {{are considered to be}} food limited because benthic production depends on the input of detrital organic material produced in the euphotic zone, thousands of meters above. Most of the organic flux arrives as an attenuated rain of <b>small</b> <b>particles</b> (typically, only 0.5–2% of net primary production in the euphotic zone), which decreases inversely with water depth. The small particle flux can be augmented by the fall of larger carcasses and downslope transport of organic material near continental margins.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of Mysida are omnivores, feeding on algae, detritus, and zooplankton. Scavenging and cannibalism are also common, with the adults sometimes preying on their young once they {{emerge from the}} marsupium. The pelagic and most other species are filter feeders, creating a feeding current with the exopods of their pereopods. This wafts food particles into a ventral food groove along which they are passed before being filtered by setae (bristles) on the second maxillae. Larger planktonic prey can be caught in a trap composed of the endopods of the thoracic appendages. Some benthic species, especially members of the subfamily Erythropinae, have been observed feeding on <b>small</b> <b>particles</b> which they collected by grooming the surfaces of their bodies and legs.|$|E

5|$|A {{permanent}} asymmetric moon {{dust cloud}} exists around the Moon, created by <b>small</b> <b>particles</b> from comets. Estimates are 5 tons of comet particles strike the Moon's surface each 24 hours. The particles strike the Moon's surface ejecting moon dust above the Moon. The dust stays above the Moon approximately 10 minutes, taking 5 minutes to rise, and 5 minutes to fall. On average, 120 kilograms of dust are present above the Moon, rising to 100 kilometers above the surface. The dust measurements {{were made by}} LADEE's Lunar Dust EXperiment (LDEX), between 20 and 100 kilometers above the surface, during a six-month period. LDEX detected an average of one 0.3 micrometer moon dust particle each minute. Dust particle counts peaked during the Geminid, Quadrantid, Northern Taurid, and Omicron Centaurid meteor showers, when the Earth, and Moon, pass through comet debris. The cloud is asymmetric, more dense near {{the boundary between the}} Moon's dayside and nightside.|$|E
5|$|Such mergers were theorized {{to produce}} kilonovae, and {{evidence}} for a kilonova associated with GRB 130603B was seen. The mean duration of these events of 0.2 seconds suggests (because of causality) a source of very small physical diameter in stellar terms; less than 0.2 light-seconds (about 60,000km or 37,000 miles—four times the Earth's diameter). This further suggests a very compact object as the source. The observation of minutes to hours of X-ray flashes after a short gamma-ray burst is consistent with <b>small</b> <b>particles</b> of a primary object like a neutron star initially swallowed by a black hole {{in less than two}} seconds, followed by some hours of lesser energy events, as remaining fragments of tidally disrupted neutron star material (no longer neutronium) remain in orbit to spiral into the black hole, {{over a longer period of}} time. A small fraction of short gamma-ray bursts are probably produced by giant flares from soft gamma repeaters in nearby galaxies.|$|E
5|$|The fruit bodies, or apothecia, of Banksiamyces {{species are}} {{cup-shaped}} receptacles borne on a stipe (stalk), colored dark brown to black {{with a dark}} grey center. When dry, the apothecia are covered with a whitish powder. The edges of the cup may be rolled inwards (especially when dry), or be twisted and somewhat flattened. Both the outermost tissue layer (the ectal excipulum) and the tissue of the stalk are made of fungal cells with brown pigments that can be variously thick- or thin-walled, covered with <b>small</b> <b>particles</b> (granules), and spherical to ellipsoid. The middle tissue layer (the medullary excipulum) of both the cup and the internal tissue layer (the medulla) of the stalk contain a layer of tissue made of hyphae similar to the ectal excipulum. A second layer of tissue is made of hyphae that are translucent and gelatinous; this layer may be present in either the medullary excipulum, the medulla, or both.|$|E

30|$|In DLCA and RLCA the {{particle}} size {{may affect the}} aggregation and gelling behaviour since the amount of surface area is directly coupled to {{the particle}} size, although surface roughness may also affect the surface area. For example, as discussed above larger particles have shown to behave more in accordance with DLVO theory than <b>smaller</b> <b>particles</b> [33]. Furthermore the ccc {{have been shown to}} vary with particle size [57]. The increase in surface area of <b>smaller</b> <b>particles</b> lead to more counter ions being needed to achieve screening in order to start aggregation. However, once aggregation has started <b>smaller</b> <b>particles</b> will aggregate faster due to their increased diffusion speed [58].|$|R
30|$|The primary size of {{the larger}} {{particles}} was greater than the primary {{size of the}} <b>smaller</b> <b>particles,</b> and as expected the BET surface area of the <b>smaller</b> <b>particles</b> was {{greater than that of}} the larger particles. However, in the aqueous medium, we showed that the specific surface area of the larger particles was greater than that of the <b>smaller</b> <b>particles.</b> This apparent contradiction is explained by the material-specific nature of the measurements. The BET value refers to the powder, and includes the roughness of the surface. In contrast, the specific surface area in the dispersion is measured by dynamic light scattering and represents the hydrodynamic surface.|$|R
5|$|The koala {{has several}} adaptations for its {{eucalypt}} diet, {{which is of}} low nutritive value, of high toxicity, and high in dietary fibre. The animal's dentition consists of the incisors and cheek teeth (a single premolar and four molars on each jaw), which are separated by a large gap (a characteristic feature of herbivorous mammals). The incisors are used for grasping leaves, which are then passed to the premolars to be snipped at the petiole before being passed to the highly cusped molars, where they are shredded into small pieces. Koalas may also store food in their cheek pouches before it {{is ready to be}} chewed. The partially worn molars of middle-aged koalas are optimal for breaking the leaves into <b>small</b> <b>particles,</b> resulting in more efficient stomach digestion and nutrient absorption in the small intestine, which digests the eucalyptus leaves to provide most of the animal's energy. A koala sometimes regurgitates the food into the mouth to be chewed a second time.|$|E
5|$|Volcanic ash is also {{produced}} during phreatomagmatic eruptions. During these eruptions fragmentation occurs when magma comes {{into contact with}} bodies of water (such as the sea, lakes and marshes) groundwater, snow or ice. As the magma, which is significantly hotter than the boiling point of water, comes into contact with water an insulating vapor film forms (Leidenfrost effect). Eventually this vapor film will collapse leading to direct coupling of the cold water and hot magma. This increases the heat transfer {{which leads to the}} rapid expansion of water and fragmentation of the magma into <b>small</b> <b>particles</b> which are subsequently ejected from the volcanic vent. Fragmentation causes an increase in contact area between magma and water creating a feedback mechanism, leading to further fragmentation and production of fine ash particles.|$|E
5|$|Erosion can be {{the result}} of {{material}} movement by the wind. There are two main effects. First, wind causes <b>small</b> <b>particles</b> to be lifted and therefore moved to another region. This is called deflation. Second, these suspended particles may impact on solid objects causing erosion by abrasion (ecological succession). Wind erosion generally occurs in areas with little or no vegetation, often in areas where there is insufficient rainfall to support vegetation. An example is the formation of sand dunes, on a beach or in a desert. Loess is a homogeneous, typically nonstratified, porous, friable, slightly coherent, often calcareous, fine-grained, silty, pale yellow or buff, windblown (Aeolian) sediment. It generally occurs as a widespread blanket deposit that covers areas of hundreds of square kilometers and tens of meters thick. Loess often stands in either steep or vertical faces. Loess tends to develop into highly rich soils. Under appropriate climatic conditions, areas with loess are among the most agriculturally productive in the world. Loess deposits are geologically unstable by nature, and will erode very readily. Therefore, windbreaks (such as big trees and bushes) are often planted by farmers to reduce the wind erosion of loess.|$|E

5|$|In many species, the molars are {{relatively}} large, intricately structured, and highly cusped or ridged. Rodent molars are well equipped to grind food into <b>small</b> <b>particles.</b> The jaw musculature is strong. The lower jaw is thrust forward while gnawing and is pulled backwards during chewing. Rodent groups {{differ in the}} arrangement of the jaw muscles and associated skull structures, both from other mammals and amongst themselves. The Sciuromorpha, such as the eastern grey squirrel, have a large deep masseter, making them efficient at biting with the incisors. The Myomorpha, such as the brown rat, have enlarged temporalis muscles, making them able to chew powerfully with their molars. The Hystricomorpha, such as the guinea pig, have larger superficial masseter muscles and smaller deep masseter muscles than rats or squirrels, possibly making them less efficient at biting with the incisors, but their enlarged internal pterygoid muscles may allow them to move the jaw further sideways when chewing. The cheek pouch is a specific morphological feature used for storing food and is evident in particular subgroups of rodents like kangaroo rats, hamsters, chipmunks and gophers which have two bags that may range from the mouth {{to the front of the}} shoulders. True mice and rats do not contain this structure but their cheeks are elastic due to a high degree of musculature and innervation in the region.|$|E
