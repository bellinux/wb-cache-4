5|$|On May 12, 2016, Meshuggah {{released}} a teaser video on their YouTube page and confirmed that their next studio album {{was to be}} released in late 2016. On July 28, 2016, the title was revealed to be The Violent <b>Sleep</b> <b>of</b> Reason, and was given an October 7 release date. The Violent <b>Sleep</b> <b>of</b> Reason was shortlisted by IMPALA (The Independent Music Companies Association) for the Album of the Year Award 2016, which rewards on a yearly basis the best album released on an independent European label.|$|E
5|$|Since its formation, Meshuggah has {{released}} eight studio albums, six EPs and eight music videos. The band has performed in various international festivals, including Ozzfest and Download, and embarked on the obZen world tour from 2008 to 2010. Meshuggah's latest studio album, The Violent <b>Sleep</b> <b>of</b> Reason, {{was released on}} 7 October 2016. Nothing and the albums that followed have all charted on the Billboard 200. Meshuggah's latest album, The Violent <b>Sleep</b> <b>of</b> Reason, debuted at number 17 in the US. In 2006 and 2009, the band {{was nominated for a}} Swedish Grammis Award.|$|E

30|$|Process S is {{also called}} the sleep homeostat because it regulates the level <b>of</b> <b>sleep</b> propensity. The {{mechanisms}} involved in Process S are less characterized but suggest a restorative and/or repairing function <b>of</b> <b>sleep.</b> Thus, the two-process model <b>of</b> <b>sleep</b> regulation suggests that Process S {{is responsible for the}} function <b>of</b> <b>sleep</b> and Process C is responsible for influencing the timing <b>of</b> <b>sleep.</b> A number <b>of</b> hypotheses on the function <b>of</b> <b>sleep</b> have been proposed based on this model of dualistic control.|$|R

5|$|On his 87th birthday, 30 October 1972, he was {{too weak}} to leave his bedroom. The next night he was {{admitted}} to the Civil Hospital of Venice, where he died in his <b>sleep</b> <b>of</b> an intestinal blockage on 1 November, with Olga at his side. Dorothy was unable to travel to the funeral. Four gondoliers dressed in black rowed the body to the island cemetery, Isola di San Michele, where he was buried near Diaghilev and Stravinsky. Dorothy died in England the following year. Olga died in 1996 and was buried next to Pound.|$|E

His state funeral at the U.S. Capitol was held in the Senate chamber on Monday, January 22. A second funeral was held three days later at the Idaho State Capitol in Boise, where Borah's casket lay beneath the rotunda for six hours prior to the service.

5|$|After the war, Szilard {{switched}} to biology. He invented the chemostat, discovered feedback inhibition, and {{was involved in}} the first cloning of a human cell. He publicly sounded the alarm against the possible development of salted thermonuclear bombs, a new kind of nuclear weapon that might annihilate mankind. Diagnosed with bladder cancer in 1960, he underwent treatment using a cobalt-60 treatment that he had designed. He helped found the Salk Institute for Biological Studies, where he became a resident fellow. Szilard founded Council for a Livable World in 1962 to deliver “the sweet voice of reason” about nuclear weapons to Congress, the White House, and the American public. He died in his <b>sleep</b> <b>of</b> a heart attack in 1964.|$|E

40|$|The {{prevalence}} <b>of</b> <b>sleep</b> {{problems in}} individuals with intellectual disability (ID) seems to vary between genetic syndromes associated with ID. Different types <b>of</b> <b>sleep</b> disturbances may indicate underlying causes <b>of</b> <b>sleep</b> problems and these types <b>of</b> <b>sleep</b> disturbances may vary between different genetic syndromes. We examined and compared five types <b>of</b> <b>sleep</b> disturbance {{as well as}} severity <b>of</b> <b>sleep</b> problems in individuals with Cri du Chat syndrome (CDC), Down's syndrome (DS), Jacobsen syndrome (JS), and individuals with non-specific ID (NS). We used Simonds and Parraga's Sleep Questionnaire (1982) to assess prevalence <b>of</b> types <b>of</b> <b>sleep</b> disturbance and to explore differences in types <b>of</b> <b>sleep</b> disturbance and severity <b>of</b> <b>sleep</b> problems between the four diagnostic groups. In each group, mean scores for Snoring {{were significantly higher than}} those for Sleep apnea and Snoring was the most prevalent type <b>of</b> <b>sleep</b> disturbance in CDC, DS, and JS. The mean score on Complaints related to sleep was remarkably high in the JS group. There were no differences in severity <b>of</b> <b>sleep</b> problems between groups. These findings suggest that snoring is an important underlying cause <b>of</b> <b>sleep</b> problems in individuals with CDS, DS, and JS...|$|R

5|$|Apart from battling, {{capturing}} Pokémon is {{the most}} essential element of Pokémon gameplay. During battle with a wild Pokémon (other trainers' Pokémon cannot be captured), the player may use a Poké Ball on the wild Pokémon. If successful, the Pokémon {{will be added to}} the player's active party (or stored if the player already has the maximum six Pokémon in his/her party). Factors in the success rate of capture include the HP (and/or status effects such as Paralysis or <b>Sleep,)</b> <b>of</b> the target Pokémon and the strength of the Poké Ball used: the lower the target's HP and the stronger the Poké Ball, the higher the success rate of capture is.|$|E
5|$|It {{is one of}} the {{fourteen}} Black Paintings that Goya applied in oil on the plaster walls of his house, the Quinta del Sordo. The paintings were completed in secret: he did not title any of the works or leave record of his intentions in creating them. Absent of fact, Witches' Sabbath is generally seen by art historians as a satire on the credulity of the age, a condemnation of superstition and the witch trials of the Spanish Inquisition. As with the other works in the group, Witches' Sabbath reflects its painter's disillusionment and can be linked thematically to his earlier etching The <b>Sleep</b> <b>of</b> Reason Produces Monsters as well as the Disasters of War print series, another bold political statement published only posthumously.|$|E
5|$|Looking Forward is a 1910 American silent short drama {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. Adapted from James Oliver Curwood's short story of the same name, the film follows a young chemist named Jack Goodwin. He discovers a chemical compound that puts a person {{into a state of}} sleep for a determined period of time and decides to test it upon himself. The first test is a success and Jack makes arrangements for his <b>sleep</b> <b>of</b> a hundred years, in a state similar to suspended animation. When he awakes in 2010 into a world ruled by women, he woos the female mayor. Jack joins a society to campaign for men's rights. The society ends up before the female mayor who jails all of them, save for Jack who she proposes to. Jack accepts on the condition that men are given back their rights and she accepts. The cast and production credits of the film are not known, but Theodore Marston was not the director. The film was released on December 20, 1910. The film is presumed lost.|$|E

40|$|Seasonal {{variations}} in sleep characteristics and {{their association with}} changes in mood were examined in 91 American men and women also who spent the 1991 austral winter at three different research stations in Antarctica. Measures of total hours <b>of</b> <b>sleep</b> over a 24 -hr period, duration of longest (i. e.,"nighttime") <b>sleep</b> event, number <b>of</b> <b>sleep</b> events, time <b>of</b> <b>sleep</b> onset, and quality <b>of</b> <b>sleep</b> remained unchanged {{over the course of}} the austral winter (March through October). However, exposure to total darkness based on station latitude was significantly associated with total hours <b>of</b> <b>sleep,</b> duration <b>of</b> are longest <b>sleep</b> event, time <b>of</b> <b>sleep</b> onset, and quality <b>of</b> <b>sleep.</b> Reported vigor the previous month was a significant independent predictor of changes in all five sleep measures; previous month's measures of all six POMS subscales were significant independent predictors <b>of</b> <b>sleep</b> quality. Sleep characteristics were significant independent predictors of vigor and confusion the following month; total sleep, longest sleep event, sleep onset and sleep quality were significant independent predictors of tension-anxiety and depression. Changes in mood during the austral winter are preceded by changes in sleep characteristics, but prolonged exposure to the photoperiodicity characteristic of the high latitudes appears to be associated with improved sleep. In turn, mood changes appear to affect certain sleep characteristics, especially sleep quality...|$|R

5|$|Positive airway pressure, {{initially}} in {{the form}} of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), is a useful treatment for obesity hypoventilation syndrome, particularly when obstructive sleep apnea co-exists. CPAP requires the use during <b>sleep</b> <b>of</b> a machine that delivers a continuous positive pressure to the airways and preventing the collapse of soft tissues in the throat during breathing; it is administered through a mask on either the mouth and nose together or if that is not tolerated on the nose only (nasal CPAP). This relieves the features of obstructive sleep apnea and is often sufficient to remove the resultant accumulation of carbon dioxide. The pressure is increased until the obstructive symptoms (snoring and periods of apnea) have disappeared. CPAP alone is effective in more than 50% of people with OHS.|$|E
