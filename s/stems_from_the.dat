5|$|Plateosaurus gracilis, {{the older}} species, {{is found in}} the Löwenstein Formation (Lower Norian).

5|$|Hominid {{is a short}} novel which {{contains}} one single and linear storyline. However, it is subdivided into seven chapters, each standing for a narrated day. The satirical character of the book <b>stems</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> underlying grotesque scenario, the speeches of Pitar and his fellow hominids, the mentioning of artifacts which {{have not yet been}} invented, and the numerous allusions to world history and literature.|$|E
5|$|Much of the wordplay in {{the book}} <b>stems</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> use of {{multilingual}} puns which draw {{on a wide range}} of languages.

5|$|Nitrogen analogues of the Nazarov {{cyclization}} reaction (known as imino-Nazarov cyclization reactions) {{have few}} instances; {{there is one}} example of a generalized imino-Nazarov cyclization reported (shown below), and several iso-imino-Nazarov reactions in the literature. Even these tend to suffer from poor stereoselectivity, poor yields, or narrow scope. The difficulty <b>stems</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> relative over-stabilization of the pentadienyl cation by electron donation, impeding cyclization.|$|E
5|$|The {{success of}} the Nazarov {{cyclization}} as a tool in organic synthesis <b>stems</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> utility and ubiquity of cyclopentenones as both motifs in natural products (including jasmone, the aflatoxins, and a subclass of prostaglandins) and as useful synthetic intermediates for total synthesis. The reaction {{has been used in}} several total syntheses and several reviews have been published.|$|E

50|$|This modern {{phenomenon}} of Sephardic Bnei Anusim gravitating towards Messianic Jewish forms of Christianity, rather than reverting to normative Judaism itself, {{has been proposed}} to be a paradigm resulting from several sets of impeding factors; some <b>stemming</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Bnei Anusim themselves, and <b>the</b> others <b>stemming</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> local normative Jewish community in Latin America.|$|R
5|$|A Miranda warning is an {{explanation}} of a suspect's rights that must be given by law enforcement before interrogation. It <b>stems</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> 1966 Miranda v. Arizona case, and is based primarily on the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. If a defendant in custody is not notified of their rights via a Miranda warning, any confession they give may not be admissible in court. If a defendant is not in police custody, however, police are free to question suspects without informing them of their rights, and their statements may still be admissible.|$|E
5|$|Catalytic {{reagents}} {{have been}} less successful, with most variations suffering from poor yield, poor enantioselectivity, or both. There are also issues with substrate scope, most having limitations with methylene transfer and aliphatic aldehydes. The trouble <b>stems</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> need for a nucleophilic sulfide that efficiently generates the ylide which can also act as a good leaving group to form the epoxide. Since the factors underlying these desiderata are at odds, tuning of the catalyst properties has proven difficult. Shown below are several {{of the most successful}} catalysts along with the yields and enantiomeric excess for their use in synthesis of (E)-stilbene oxide.|$|E
5|$|Chat Moss may {{be named}} after St Chad, a 7th-century bishop of Mercia, {{but as it}} was once part of a great tree-edged lake, as {{evidenced}} by the numerous wood remains in the lower levels of the peat, it is perhaps more likely that the name <b>stems</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Celtic word ced, meaning wood. Chat Moss could also derive from Ceatta, an Old English personal name and mos, a swamp or alternatively the first element could be the Old English ceat meaning a piece of wet ground. It was recorded as Catemosse in 1277 and Chatmos in 1322. Moss is the local name for a peat bog.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{the loss}} of the {{original}} multi-track tape, there had never been an official true stereo release of the final track until the 2012 remastered version of Smiley Smile. The stereo mix was made possible through the invention of new digital technology by Derry Fitzgerald, and received the blessing of Brian Wilson and Mark Linett. Fitzgerald's software extracted individual instrumental and vocal <b>stems</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> original mono master—as the multi-track vocals remained missing—to construct the stereo version that appears on the 2012 reissue of Smiley Smile.|$|E
5|$|In 2013, the US Government Accountability Office said a {{shortage}} of lithium-7 critical to the operation of 65 out of 100 American nuclear reactors “places their ability to continue to provide electricity at some risk”. The problem <b>stems</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> decline of US nuclear infrastructure. The equipment needed to separate lithium-6 from lithium-7 is mostly a cold war leftover. The US shut down most of this machinery in 1963, when it had a huge surplus of separated lithium, mostly consumed during the twentieth century. The report {{said it would take}} five years and $10 million to $12 million to reestablish the ability to separate lithium-6 from lithium-7.|$|E
5|$|The {{cause of}} the war <b>stems</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> {{increasing}} numbers of English colonists and their demand for land. As more land was purchased from the Native Americans, they were restricted to smaller territories for themselves. Native American leaders such as King Philip resented the loss of land and looked for a means to slow or reverse it. Of specific concern was {{the founding of the}} town of Swansea, which was located only {{a few miles from the}} Wampanoag capital at Mount Hope. The General Court of Plymouth began using military force to coerce the sale of Wampanoag land to the settlers of the town.|$|E

5|$|The {{director}} {{of the film is}} not known, but two possibles exist. Barry O'Neil was the stage name of Thomas J. McCarthy, who would direct many important Thanhouser pictures, including its first two-reeler, Romeo and Juliet. Lloyd B. Carleton was the stage name of Carleton B. Little, a director who would stay with the Thanhouser Company until moving to the Biograph Company by the summer of 1910. The confusion between the directing credits <b>stems</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> industry practice of not crediting the film directors, even in studio news releases. Q. David Bowers says that the attribution of these early directors often comes from a collection of contemporary publications or interviews.|$|E
5|$|The formal {{controversy}} over {{the legality of the}} annexation of Texas <b>stems</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> fact that Congress approved the annexation of Texas as a state, rather than a territory, with simple majorities in each house, instead of annexing the land by Senate treaty, as was done with Native American lands. Tyler's extralegal joint resolution maneuver in 1844 exceeded strict constructionist precepts, but was passed by Congress in 1845 as part of a compromise bill. The success of the joint house Texas annexation set a precedent that would be applied to Hawaii's annexation in 1897.|$|E
5|$|The third letter openly {{incorporates}} Swift's {{argument that}} political authority <b>stems</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> consent of a population. As such, the third letter {{has been seen}} as a response in part to the Declaratory Act, which had undermined the independence and the authority of Irish legislature and judiciary in favour of the British. The Declaratory Act removed the ability for any in Ireland to speak for the people of Ireland, and it was necessary for the act to be removed before the people could be heard.|$|E
