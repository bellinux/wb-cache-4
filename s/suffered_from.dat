40|$|Number of {{patients}} with hypertension have increased from year to year. This is due to an unhealthy lifestyle, excessive stress and so forth. Patiens with hypertension are often unaware of the dangers that {{can be caused by}} disease. The medical diagnosis of hypertension is made when obtained blood pressure is obtained more than 140 / 90 mmHg. In this study, created a system of enforcement of hypertension using sugeno fuzzy logic. This application uses the parameters of age, body mass index, blod pressure(systole and diastole), family history (genetics), diabetes mellitus. From testing the fuzzy logic that has been done, can be obtained on the calculation of 60 patients who did not <b>suffer</b> <b>from</b> hypertension (normal) as much 3 people, who <b>suffer</b> <b>from</b> prehypertension as much 17 people, who <b>suffer</b> <b>from</b> hypertension grade 1 as much 25 people and who <b>suffer</b> <b>from</b> hypertension degrees 2 as much 15 people.

40|$|Thesis (M. Com. (Industrial Psychology)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2011 Depression {{is one of}} {{the most}} debilitating, {{widespread}} and costly health problems worldwide and has a high prevalence in almost every society. Research suggests that depression affects an individual‟s work engagement levels, burnout levels and the occurrence of stress-related ill health symptoms. However, it is unclear whether these findings would differ among individuals who reported that they <b>suffer</b> <b>from</b> depression and receive medical treatment for it, individuals who reported that they are unsure whether they <b>suffer</b> <b>from</b> depression, and individuals who reported that they do not <b>suffer</b> <b>from</b> depression. This study is quantitative in nature and a cross-sectional design was used. The study population consisted of 15 664 participants from several sectors in South Africa. The participants also differed in terms of gender, age, race, marital status, educational level, language and the province where they reside. The sample population was thus representative of the diverse population of South Africa. The SAEHWS, a self-report instrument based on the dual-process model of work-related well-being, was used to measure all constructs. The participants were divided into three groups, i. e. individuals who reported that they <b>suffer</b> <b>from</b> depression and are currently receiving medical treatment for depression, individuals who reported that they are uncertain whether they <b>suffer</b> <b>from</b> depression, and individuals who reported that they do not <b>suffer</b> <b>from</b> depression. Frequencies were used to determine the prevalence of depression in the three different groups and MANOVA (multivariate analysis of variance) was used to determine the significance of differences between the levels of work engagement, burnout and stress-related ill health symptoms of the three different groups (individuals who reported that they <b>suffer</b> <b>from</b> depression, individuals who reported that they are uncertain whether they <b>suffer</b> <b>from</b> depression, and those who reported that they do not <b>suffer</b> <b>from</b> depression). The results showed that 18, 3 % of the population reported that they <b>suffer</b> <b>from</b> depression and receive medical treatment for depression, 16, 7 % of the population reported that they are unsure whether they <b>suffer</b> <b>from</b> depression and 65 % reported that they do not <b>suffer</b> <b>from</b> depression. Furthermore, it was found that depression significantly influences work engagement levels negatively and that it significantly influences burnout levels and the occurrence of stress-related ill health symptoms positively. This study will make organisations aware of the effect of depression on an individual‟s well-being and of the fact that depression is a factor to be reckoned with. Employers should consider ways to assist employees who <b>suffer</b> <b>from</b> depression and should learn how to act preventatively to decrease any further occurrence. Master...|$|R
