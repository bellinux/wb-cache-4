40|$|Task <b>switch</b> <b>costs</b> often show an asymmetry, with <b>switch</b> <b>costs</b> being larger when {{switching}} from {{a difficult task}} to an easier task. This asymmetry has been explained by difficult tasks being represented more strongly and consequently requiring more inhibition prior to switching to the easier task. The present study shows that <b>switch</b> <b>cost</b> asymmetries observed in arithmetic tasks (addition vs. subtraction) do not depend on task difficulty: <b>Switch</b> <b>costs</b> of similar magnitudes were obtained when participants were presented with unsolvable pseudo-equations that {{did not differ in}} task difficulty. Further experiments showed that neither task <b>switch</b> <b>costs</b> nor <b>switch</b> <b>cost</b> asymmetries were due to perceptual factors (e. g., perceptual priming effects). These findings suggest that asymmetrical <b>switch</b> <b>costs</b> can be brought about by the association of some tasks with greater difficulty than others. Moreover, the finding that asymmetrical <b>switch</b> <b>costs</b> were observed (1) {{in the absence of a}} task switch proper and (2) without differences in task difficulty, suggests that present theories of task <b>switch</b> <b>costs</b> and <b>switch</b> <b>cost</b> asymmetries are in important ways incomplete and need to be modified. 10 page(s...|$|R

40|$|We analyze market {{dynamics}} under Bertrand duopoly {{competition in}} industries with network e¤ects and consumer <b>switching</b> <b>costs.</b> Consumers form installed bases, repeatedly buy the products, and differ {{with respect to}} their <b>switching</b> <b>costs.</b> Depending on the ratio of <b>switching</b> <b>costs</b> to network effects, our model generates convergence to monopoly as well as market sharing as equilibrium outcomes. Convergence can be monotone or alternating in both scenarios. A critical mass effect, where consumers are trapped into one technology for sure only occurs for intermediate values of <b>switching</b> <b>costs,</b> whereas for large <b>switching</b> <b>costs</b> market sharing is the unique equilibrium and for small <b>switching</b> <b>costs</b> both monopoly and market sharing equilibria emerge.

40|$|This paper studies {{relationship}} lending in {{a framework}} where {{the cost of}} switching banks measures the degree of banking competition. The relationship lender’s (insider bank’s) informational advantage creates a lock-in effect, which is at its height when the <b>switching</b> <b>cost</b> is infinitesimal.

The data about switching costs and other constructs are collected from 261 retail banking customers, and analysed using structural equation modelling and moderated path analysis.
