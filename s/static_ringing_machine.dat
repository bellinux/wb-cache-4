40|$|Experiments were {{designed}} to investigate the influence of steady flow and pressure on endothelial function in the rabbit carotid artery. Increases and decreases in isometric force were compared in <b>static</b> <b>rings</b> and perfused (5 or 50 ml/min) segments of the same arteries in the presence and absence of endothelium. The α 1 -adrenoceptor agonist phenylephrine and the muscarinic agonist acetylcholine were applied as vasoconstrictor and vasodilator stimuli, respectively. Continuous flow (5 and 50 ml/min) reduced the cGMP content and shifted the concentration-response curve to phenylephrine to the left compared with nonperfused <b>static</b> <b>rings.</b> Removal of the endothelium abolished the differences in cGMP content and the sensitivity to phenylephrine between <b>static</b> <b>rings</b> and perfused segments. No difference in sensitivity to phenylephrine was observed in tissues treated with Nω-nitro-L- arginine methyl ester (L-NAME). Acetylcholine-evoked relaxations were increased in perfused segments. L-NAME nearly abolished the acetylcholine-evoked relaxation in <b>static</b> <b>rings,</b> whereas about one-half of the relaxation remained in segments exposed to flow. This remnant relaxation was blocked by inhibition of endothelial small- and intermediate-conductance calcium-activated potassium channels by apamin plus 1 -[(2 -chlorophenyl) diphenylmethyl]- 1 H-pyrazole (TRAM- 34). These experiments demonstrate that continuous flow increases the constriction evoked by α 1 -adrenergic activation in the rabbit carotid artery through a reduced influence of basally released endothelial NO and, furthermore, that luminal flow unmasks an ability of the endothelium to release a non-NO, noncyclooxygenase vasodilator, presumably endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor.

40|$|Abstract: The three {{dimensional}} {{model was}} established for studying performance of spiral groove gas face seal. According to machining features of different surface area, the seal face {{can be divided}} into three parts, rotor ring grooved area, rotor ring non-grooved area and <b>static</b> <b>ring</b> area. The effect of roughness on seal performance was analyzed based on calculation of three dimensional flow field. The analysis results show that the surface roughness of rotor ring grooved area has great influence on the seal performance, but the influence is little when roughness on non-grooved rotor <b>ring</b> surface and <b>static</b> <b>ring</b> surface. The influence must be considered when surface roughness of rotor ring grooved area bigger than 0. 2 µm. Roughness of rotor ring surface can increase the loading force while it also can cause the increase of leakage. It is important to select rational roughness when designing gas face seal...|$|R
40|$|We apply a Harrison {{transformation}} {{to higher}} dimensional asymptotically flat black hole solutions, which puts {{them into an}} external magnetic field. First, we magnetize the Schwarzschild-Tangherlini metric in arbitrary spacetime dimension n>= 4. The thus generated exact solution of the Einstein-Maxwell equations describes a static black hole immersed in a Melvin "fluxbrane", and generalizes previous results by Ernst for the case n= 4. The magnetic field deforms {{the shape of the}} event horizon, but the total area (as a function of the mass) and the thermodynamics remain unaffected. The amount of flux through a one-dimensional loop on the horizon exhibits a maximum for a finite value of the magnetic field strength, and decreases for larger values. In the Aichelburg-Sexl ultrarelativistic limit, the magnetized black hole becomes an impulsive gravitational wave propagating in the Melvin background. Furthermore, we discuss possible applications of a similar Harrison transformation to rotating black objects. This enables us to magnetize the Myers-Perry hole and the (dipole) Emparan-Reall ring at least in the special case when the vector potential is parallel to a nonrotating Killing field. In particular, dipole rings may be held in equilibrium even when their spin vanishes, thus demonstrating (infinite) non-uniqueness of magnetized static uncharged black holes in five dimensions. Physical properties of such rings are discussed.

40|$|Three {{static and}} axially {{symmetric}} (Weyl-type) ring singularities [...] the Majumdar-Papapetrou [...] type (extremally charged) ring, the Bach-Weyl ring and the Appell ring [...] are studied in general relativity {{in order to}} show how remarkably the geometries in their vicinity differ from each other. This is demonstrated on basic measures of the rings and on invariant characteristics given by the metric and by its first and second derivatives (lapse, gravitational acceleration and curvature), and also on geodesic motion. The results are also compared against the Kerr space-time which possesses a ring singularity too. The Kerr solution is only stationary, not static, but in spite of the consequent complication by dragging, its ring appears to be simpler than the <b>static</b> <b>rings.</b> We show that this mainly applies to the Bach-Weyl ring, although this straightforward counter-part of the Newtonian homogeneous circular ring is by default being taken as the simplest ring solution, and although the other two <b>static</b> <b>ring</b> sources may seem more "artificial".

40|$|Many nucleic acid-binding {{proteins}} and the AAA+ family form hexameric rings, but {{the mechanism of}} hexamer assembly is unclear. It is generally believed that the specificity in protein/RNA interaction relies on molecular contact through a surface charge or 3 D structure matching via conformational capture or induced fit. The pRNA of bacteriophage phi 29 DNA-packaging motor also forms a ring, but whether the pRNA ring is a hexamer or a pentamer is under debate. Here, single molecule studies elucidated a mechanism suggesting the specificity and affinity in protein/RNA interaction relies on pRNA <b>static</b> <b>ring</b> formation. A combined pRNA ring-forming group was very specific for motor binding, but the isolated individual members of the ring-forming group bind to the motor nonspecifically. pRNA did not form a ring prior to motor binding. Only those RNAs that formed a <b>static</b> <b>ring,</b> via the interlocking loops, stayed on the motor. Single interlocking loop interruption resulted in pRNA detachment. Extension or reduction of the ring circumference failed in motor binding. This new mechanism was tested by redesigning two artificial RNAs that formed hexamer and packaged DNA.
