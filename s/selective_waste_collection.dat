5000|$|Compared to {{developed}} OECD states, Brazil has a fairly low total recycling rate, being at 2% of created waste. [...] As in 2012 merely 14% of municipalities provided <b>selective</b> <b>waste</b> <b>collection</b> - with 86% of these municipalities located {{in either the}} South or Southeastern region - the country relies heavily on waste pickers. Additionally to that, only 64% {{of the population has}} access to regular garbage collection. Yet, the situation is improving since the absolute number of municipalities offering selective collection rose from 443 in 2010 to 766 in 2012.Despite its low overall recycling rate, Brazil is the world leader in recycling aluminum. Having set a record recycling rate of 98,4% of aluminum, the country was able to top its record 97,1% from 2013 by another 1,3%. The main reason for the extreme aluminum recycling rate are the rising energy costs - which will continue to rise given the increasing hydropower prices caused by the 2015 drought - and consequently, the high expenses that are associated with the production of new aluminum. As between March 2014 and March 2015 the cost of energy rose by 60% and since recycling aluminum requires 95% less energy than producing new material, the recycling rates have kept rising while smelter plants have been shutting down production. PET is the second most recycled packaging material in Brazil with 54% of PET having been recycled in 2014. However, due to lower production costs this rate is yet much smaller than the percentage of recycled aluminum. Given its very low production costs as well as the more expensive processes needed to recycle the material, plastics exhibit the lowest recycling rate among the most common packaging materials. The Brazilian beauty care and cosmetics brand Sejaa serves as an example for products that use recycled packaging. Sejaa, which was launched by Brazilian fashion model Gisele Bündchen uses fibers consisting to 100% of recycled post-consumer waste paper and is Forest Stewardship certified. Another example is Brazilian pulp and paper manufacturer Suzano, which since 2012 produces paperboard made from Post consumer resin (PCR) by extracting fibers from long life packaging such as milk cartons.|$|E

40|$|The waste {{management}} is transforming {{in a more}} and more complex effort, with environmental and economic relief. The urban solid wastes are mainly produced in {{the final phase of}} the consumption, particularly by the food packaging increasing. As concerns materials recovery and recycling, a key condition for the development of <b>selective</b> <b>wastes</b> <b>collection</b> is the capability of recycling plants. The limitation {{in the use of the}} secondary raw materials, in fact, is due to their quality, however lower than the primary raw materials one. In the case of cullets, it is necessary to assure a high quality level. The technological characteristics of the glass produced by using recycled materials are deeply influenced by the chemical composition of cullets and the presence of extraneous items in the recycled mixture. The recognition of cullets produced by crushing is important in order to recycle the glass for the industrial uses. The aim of this work is to evaluate the correspondence between the characteristics of cullets and the characteristics of the corresponding original bottles, in order to identify in cullets the physical and mechanical properties of glass that constitutes the bottles. A feasible analytical procedure able to associate the cullets characteristics to the original bottles, independently from the effect produced during the crushing, has been pointed out...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{educational}} institutions represent {{the main components}} of sustainability promotion in our society. Waste management is one of the challenges that {{educational institutions}} have to face in accomplishing sustainability goals. In Bucharest, 457 educational institutions (pre-schools, primary and secondary schools, high schools, special schools) were analyzed using questionnaires. Questionnaires included items related with waste management inside the educational institutions: quantities, collection system characteristics (schedule, selective collection presence, temporary depositing place), responsible for management and influencing factors (total built surface, number of students and educational staff). The results show that most of educational institutions have deficiencies regarding waste management: 47 % of the respondents don’t have sufficient information about the generated waste quantities and 49 % don’t have <b>waste</b> <b>selective</b> <b>collection</b> systems implemented. <b>Waste</b> quantities generated in educational institutions does not depend on the number of students and the total built surface, but is influenced by the educational institution type.

40|$|The use of {{recycled}} materials can {{address some of}} the issues associated with the cost and environmental implications of non-renewable materials. So the prime aim of this work was to determine the thermodynamic changes in the polypropylene (PP) mixtures depending on the percentage amount of different origin recyclates for sustainable nanocomposites. In this study, different polypropylene mixtures with the addition of PP recyclates from a <b>selective</b> <b>waste</b> <b>collection</b> system and in-plant recycling system have been subjected to detailed analysis. It was obvious that recyclates from technological waste were of higher quality than post-user recyclates obtained from a <b>selective</b> <b>waste</b> <b>collection</b> system. The influence of the source of the recyclates on the different properties of the processed materials has been studied in detail. The content of the repeatedly processed material in the technological recyclates was found to explain the unexpected influence of the recyclates content on the properties of the final product. A mathematical model was also formulated to calculate the content of the material with certain amount of recirculations in the in-plant recycling system since no analyses concerning the content of the repeatedly processed material in the technological recyclates added to the original material were found in the literature...|$|E
