White Zombie opened in New York to negative reception, with reviewers criticizing the film's over-the-top story and weak acting performances. While the film made a substantial financial profit as an independent feature, {{it proved to be}} less popular than other horror films of the time.|$|E

It was Playboys first attempt at creating a non-nude swimsuit calendar featuring Playmates similar in style with those from Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue. While all Playmates {{appeared in}} bikinis in the calendar, McDougal and Hiromi Oshima {{were the only two}} Playmates actually wearing only painted on bikinis.|$|E
5|$|Vrbanja Bridge {{was located}} in no-man's-land during the Siege of Sarajevo (1992–96). It was {{surrounded}} by tall buildings, which made it a target of sniper-fire {{from the beginning of}} the Bosnian War. On 5 April 1992, six protestors were <b>shot</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bridge by Serb snipers. Two women, Suada Dilberović and Olga Sučić, died as a result, and are considered the first victims of the siege by Bosniaks and Croats.|$|E
5|$|Consequently, Lamason {{was among}} a group of 168 allied airmen from Great Britain, United States, Australia, Canada, New Zealand and Jamaica who -- along with over 2,500 French prisoners -- were taken by train—in overcrowded cattle boxcars — from Fresnes Prison outside Paris, to Buchenwald {{concentration}} camp. As the airmen were herded into the boxcars, Lamason protested about the poor treatment of the airmen, only to be struck in the face by a SS guard. Lamason fell to the ground and captured pilot Roy Allen watched as a SS Major pulled a Luger from his holster and thought Lamason would be <b>shot</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> spot. After five days travel, during which the airmen received very little food or water, they arrived at Buchenwald on 20 August 1944.|$|E

5|$|Despite these raids, the war's outcome {{had become}} apparent. Defections of ZNDH {{personnel}} and aircraft to the Allies and Partisans intensified, including two Bf 109s to Italy on 16 April and a further two Messerschmitts to the Partisans in Mostar on 20 April. The last fighter delivery {{took place on}} 23 April 1945. It was also on this day that the final Croatian kills were scored when an ex-HZL 16-kill ace and his wingman claimed two RAF P-51 Mustangs shot down in their Bf 109Gs, {{one of which was}} confirmed. The last attack mission was flown on 6 May, when two antiquated Rogožarski R-100 fighter trainers bombed the railway bridge over the Kupa in an effort to stop the Partisan advance on Karlovac, south of Zagreb. One of the Yugoslav-built parasol wing aircraft was hit by ground fire and the pilot crash-landed near his target. He was captured and <b>shot</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> spot.|$|E
5|$|In September, {{production}} {{moved to}} Egypt. While the Great Sphinx of Giza was <b>shot</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> location, lighting problems caused the pyramids {{to be replaced}} with miniatures. While construction of the Liparus set continued, the second unit headed by John Glen departed for Mount Asgard, where in July 1976 they staged the film's pre-credits sequence. Bond film veteran Willy Bogner captured the action, staged by stuntman Rick Sylvester, who earned $30,000 for the stunt. This stunt cost $500,000 – the most expensive single movie stunt at that time. Additional scenes for the pre-credits sequence were filmed in the Bernina Range in the Swiss alps.|$|E
5|$|Most {{of those}} killed at Treblinka were Jews, but about 2,000 Romani people also died there. Like the Jews, the Romani were first rounded up {{and sent to the}} ghettos; at a conference on 30 January 1940 it was decided that all 30,000 Romani living in Germany proper were to be {{deported}} to former Polish territory. Most of these were sent to Jewish ghettos in the General Government, such as those in Warsaw and Łódź. As with the Jews, most Romani who went to Treblinka died in the gas chambers, although some were shot. The majority of the Jews living in ghettos were sent to Bełżec, Sobibór, or Treblinka to be executed; most of the Romani living in the ghettos were <b>shot</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> spot. There were no known Romani escapees or survivors from Treblinka.|$|E

5|$|On {{arriving}} in Nassau, McClory searched for locations to shoot {{many of the}} key sequences of the film and used {{the home of a}} local millionaire couple, the Sullivans, for Largo's estate, Palmyra. Part of the SPECTRE underwater assault was also <b>shot</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> coastal grounds of another millionaire's home on the island. The most difficult sequences to film were the underwater action scenes; the first to be shot underwater was at a depth of 50 feet to shoot the scene where SPECTRE divers remove the atomic bombs from the sunken Vulcan bomber. Peter Lamont had previously visited a Royal Air Force bomber station carrying a concealed camera which he used to get close-up shots of secret missiles (those appearing in the film were not actually present). Most of the underwater scenes had to be done at lower tides due to the sharks on the Bahamian coast.|$|E
5|$|Part of the 16th Division also {{attacked}} the 3rd Brigade in No.1 Section from Lone Pine southwards. They advanced in two waves through {{a field of}} wheat, but only three men survived the Australian fire to reach the 10th Battalion's trench, and were then <b>shot</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> parapet. Turkish wounded and survivors could be seen moving back to a gully, but in the growing light they were {{in full view of}} an 11th Battalion machine-gun, which caused devastation amongst their ranks. The Australians continued firing at targets until around noon, but it was obvious the assault by the 16th Division had failed here. In the extreme south of the ANZAC beachhead the 9th Battalion trench was attacked by the independent 77th Infantry Regiment. However, here as elsewhere, the attacking Turks were whittled down by the Australian fire, the last of them as they reached the belt of barbed wire in front of the Australian trenches.|$|E
5|$|Shot {{mostly on}} {{location}} on Martha's Vineyard in Massachusetts, Jaws {{was the first}} major motion picture to be <b>shot</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ocean. As a result, the film had a troubled production, going over budget and past schedule. As the art department's mechanical sharks suffered many malfunctions, Spielberg decided to mostly suggest the animal's presence, employing an ominous, minimalistic theme created by composer John Williams to indicate the shark's impending appearances. Spielberg and others have compared this suggestive approach to that of classic thriller director Alfred Hitchcock. Universal Pictures gave the film what was then an exceptionally wide release for a major studio picture, over 450 screens, accompanied by an extensive marketing campaign with a heavy emphasis on television spots and tie-in merchandise.|$|E

5|$|The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr., {{was filmed}} {{primarily}} on the Warner Bros. soundstages. Town and street scenes were staged on the Western backlot, known as Laramie Street. It {{was one of the}} last Western shows to use the backlot. Cuse said that logistics were a problem because so many of the Hollywood Western sets and towns had been torn down by the 1990s. Outdoor scenes were <b>shot</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Warner Bros. ranch in Valencia, California; Bronson Canyon in Los Angeles; and the Valuze Ranch in Santa Clarita, California. Some of the locomotive scenes from Brisco were filmed on location at Railtown 1897 State Historic Park in Jamestown, California. A painting used in the show as a backdrop to create illusions of greater depth perspectives is exhibited at the park.|$|E
5|$|The {{company also}} shot at Hoover Dam {{and at the}} Pentagon, {{the first time since}} the September 11 attacks that film crews had been allowed at these locations. The {{external}} Hoover Dam scenes were shot before tourists arrived daily at 10:00a.m., with shooting moving inside for the remainder of the day. Production in California was based at Hughes Aircraft at Playa Vista, where the hangar in which Megatron is imprisoned was built. Six weekends were spent in Los Angeles, California shooting the climactic battle, with some elements being <b>shot</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Universal Studios backlot and at Detroit's Michigan Central Station. The crew was allowed to shoot at Griffith Observatory, which was still closed for renovations begun in 2002. Filming wrapped on October 4, 2006.|$|E
5|$|The {{first full}} day of filming on June 23 was {{predominantly}} <b>shot</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> set representing {{the bridge of the}} Enterprise. Two small establishing shots were postponed until the filming of the next episode. The following day, corridor scenes were filmed, as was the climactic scene featuring the creature's death. At that point, Daniels estimated that he was only a third of a day behind schedule. After a break for the weekend, production resumed on June 27 for scenes in the botany lab, the briefing room and sickbay. One of Grace Lee Whitney's favorite sets to work on throughout the series was the lab, which was the sickbay redecorated, as she enjoyed working with George Takei. The animated plant in that scene was a hand puppet controlled from under the table, and Whitney later recalled that the operator could see right up her skirt throughout the shoot and would occasionally try to grope her using the puppet.|$|E

5000|$|The term B-roll {{originates}} from {{a particular}} {{solution to the problem}} of visible splices in the narrow film stock used in 16 mm film. 35 mm film was wide enough to hide splices, but 16 mm film revealed the splices as flaws in the picture. To avoid this problem, the intended shots were spliced to opaque black leader, with the black leader hiding the splice. Two sequences of shots were assembled, <b>the</b> odd-numbered <b>shots</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> A-roll, and <b>the</b> even-numbered <b>shots</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> B-roll, such that all of <b>the</b> <b>shots</b> <b>on</b> one roll were matched by black leader <b>on</b> <b>the</b> other roll, in a checkerboard pattern (an alternate name for the process was [...] "checkerboard printing".) Unexposed 16 mm raw print stock was exposed twice, once to the A-roll, then it was exposed again to the B-roll.|$|R
5|$|The first {{studies of}} the Javan {{rhinoceros}} by naturalists from outside of its region took place in 1787, when two animals were shot in Java. The skulls {{were sent to the}} renowned Dutch naturalist Petrus Camper, who died in 1789 before he was able to publish his discovery that the rhinos of Java were a distinct species. Another Javan rhinoceros was <b>shot</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> island of Sumatra by Alfred Duvaucel, who sent the specimen to his stepfather Georges Cuvier, the famous French scientist. Cuvier recognized the animal as a distinct species in 1822, and in the same year it was identified by Anselme Gaëtan Desmarest as Rhinoceros sondaicus. It was the last species of rhinoceros to be identified. Desmarest initially identified the rhino as being from Sumatra, but later amended this to say his specimen was from Java.|$|E
5|$|The tournament {{began on}} Saturday, May 9, when the Brown Bears {{traveled}} {{to face the}} eighth-seeded Johns Hopkins Blue Jays at Homewood Field in Baltimore. The Blue Jays pulled away to three-goal leads {{in the first and}} final quarters, but the Bears equalized both times. In the final ten seconds of regulation, Brown attackman Kyle Hollingsworth batted in a loose ball to even the score, 11–11. In overtime, Hopkins won the faceoff and called a timeout, before Brian Christopher drove up {{the right side of the}} field and made a game-winning top-corner <b>shot</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> run. It was the third overtime goal by Christopher in Hopkins' past four games.|$|E
5|$|There {{were many}} ways to die on the inner German border. Numerous escapees were shot by the border guards, while others were killed by mines and booby-traps. A {{substantial}} number drowned while trying to cross the Baltic and the Elbe river. Not all of those killed on the border were attempting to escape. On 13October 1961, Westfälische Rundschau journalist Kurt Lichtenstein was <b>shot</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> border {{near the village of}} Zicherie after he attempted to speak with East German farm workers. His death aroused condemnation across the political spectrum in West Germany. The incident prompted students from Braunschweig to erect a sign on the border protesting the killing.|$|E
