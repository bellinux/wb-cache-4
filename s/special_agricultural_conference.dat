After {{a series of}} planning meetings {{at the law firm}} of Patton Boggs & Blow, Hollis assumed leadership of the US business delegation to the conference. Working with Richard Lyng of the American Meat Institute (later Reagan’s Secretary of Agriculture and Clifford Cox, vice chairman of Greyhound Corporation, Hollis fielded a twenty-man delegation, attracted House Speaker Thomas Foley (D-WA) and played a galvanizing role coordinating the academic and government participation as well. The conference entitled “The Economic Challenges of Peace: Agriculture and Economic Transition in Egypt” proved highly successful. A highlight of the program was a private meeting with Egyptian President Anwar Sadat in his garden outside Alexandra. The Nobel Peace prize winning statesman was gracious and relaxed with his astounded guests who had come to the estate expected to have tea with Mrs. Gihan Sadat.|$|E

40|$|The {{record of}} {{traditional}} safeguard {{provisions of the}} General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the World Trade Organization provides useful information about how a <b>special</b> <b>agricultural</b> safeguard might be made effective. The success of existing safeguard or flexibility provisions to sustain long-run liberalization programs stems from their requiring objective, transparent, and participatory decisions on {{the application of the}} import restrictions they allow. The proposed <b>special</b> <b>agricultural</b> safeguard expands by arithmetic formula the bounds within which a Member may impose a new import restriction. Analysis reported here suggests that the formulas provide a poor guide for policy, indicating that they would frequently prescribe action that is not needed and fail to prescribe action when it would be appropriate. Analysis of the existing agricultural safeguard, to which the <b>special</b> <b>agricultural</b> safeguard is similar, indicates that it has functioned not as an allowance for occasional response to unusual situations but as an expansion of the limits Members have accepted through tariff bindings. To be useful, the <b>special</b> <b>agricultural</b> safeguard should do more than provide formulas for import restrictions. It should provide for objective and participatory processes that would bring forward relevant information and guide an objective and balanced accounting of the interests at play.
