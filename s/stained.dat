5|$|Annual {{memorial}} {{services are}} held by the HMS Aldenham Association in Aldenham Church of St John The Baptist each December. The church contains a <b>stained</b> glass window dedicated to Aldenham, and a Book of Remembrance is displayed {{in front of the}} <b>stained</b> glass window, along with a White Ensign. The <b>stained</b> glass window memorial was unveiled {{on the occasion of the}} 50th anniversary of sinking of Aldenham by surviving shipmates Martin and Maurais.|$|E
5|$|Four large <b>stained</b> {{glass windows}} {{are found in}} the main sanctuary.|$|E
50|$|Simple <b>staining</b> is <b>staining</b> {{with only}} one stain/dye. There are various kinds of {{multiple}} <b>staining,</b> {{many of which are}} examples of counterstaining, differential <b>staining,</b> or both, including double <b>staining</b> and triple <b>staining.</b>|$|R
50|$|Ziehl-Neelsen <b>staining</b> {{is used to}} <b>stain</b> {{species of}} Mycobacterium {{tuberculosis}} that do not <b>stain</b> with the standard laboratory <b>staining</b> procedures such as Gram <b>staining.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Use of sample-staining {{methods for}} use in microbiology, such as simple <b>stains</b> (methylene blue, safranin, crystal violet) and {{differential}} <b>stains</b> (negative <b>stains,</b> flagellar <b>stains,</b> endospore <b>stains).</b>|$|R
5|$|Internally, {{the south}} range {{includes}} three 16th- or early-17th-century stone fireplaces that {{have probably been}} reused from the earlier house. The north room of the attic floor and principal room {{on the first floor}} include 16th- or early-17th-century timber panelling. The room over the entrance hall features late-17th-century panelling. Two period staircases feature; one from each of the 16th and 17th centuries. The windows in the entrance hall and north room of the east range include armorial <b>stained</b> glass windows dated 1567, 1567 and 1575. The stairwell includes windows with 17th-century German <b>stained</b> glass taken from the adjacent church of St Peter and other, undated <b>stained</b> glass.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the windows}} contain clear leaded glass, but some have <b>stained</b> glass. In 2010, a two-panel <b>stained</b> glass window {{depicting}} {{the work of the}} RAF Search and Rescue units at RAF Valley was dedicated by the RAF's Chaplain-in-Chief, Ray Pentland. The window, which also commemorates the work of the Royal National Lifeboat Institute and the RAF Mountain Rescue Service, was created by Karen Newby– wife of a former RAF Valley station commander– and Lindsey Abbott. Karen Newby also designed a window dedicated in 2001 to mark the work of 208 Squadron at RAF Valley. Another <b>stained</b> glass window was added in 2012 to mark the 100th anniversary of 4Squadron.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} is {{cast in the}} Classical Revival architectural style and contains elements common to that style. <b>Stained</b> glass, columns and a pediment are among the more noticeable features at a glance. The rear facade of the {{building is}} designed to resemble a temple and also features <b>stained</b> glass windows. A stone porte-cochere covers the rear driveway. Inside the building's third floor courtroom is more <b>stained</b> glass, {{in the form of}} a skylight. During the early 1980s a made for television movie had scenes filmed in the DeKalb County Courthouse's courtroom.|$|E
50|$|The Romanowsky <b>stains</b> are {{all based}} on a {{combination}} of eosinate (chemically reduced eosin) and methylene blue (sometimes with its oxidation products azure A and azure B). Common variants include Wright's <b>stain,</b> Jenner's <b>stain,</b> May-Grunwald <b>stain,</b> Leishman <b>stain</b> and Giemsa <b>stain.</b>|$|R
5000|$|A vital <b>stain</b> in {{a casual}} usage may mean a <b>stain</b> {{that can be}} applied on living cells without killing them. Vital <b>stains</b> have been useful for {{diagnostic}} and surgical techniques in a variety of medical specialties. In supravital <b>staining</b> living cells that have been removed from an organism, whereas intravital <b>staining</b> is done by injecting or otherwise introducing the <b>stain</b> into the body. The term vital <b>stain</b> is used by some authors to refer to an intravital <b>stain,</b> and by others interchangeably with a supravital <b>stain,</b> the core concept being that the cell being examined is still alive. But in a more strict sense the term vital <b>staining</b> has a meaning contrasting with supravital <b>staining.</b> While in supravital <b>staining</b> the live cells take up the <b>stain,</b> in [...] "vital staining" [...] - the most accepted but apparently paradoxical meaning of this term, the live cells exclude the <b>stain</b> i.e. <b>stain</b> negatively and only the dead cells <b>stain</b> positively and thus viability can be assessed by counting the percentage of total cells that <b>stain</b> negatively. Very bulky or highly charged <b>stains</b> that don't cross live plasma membrane are used as vital <b>stains</b> and supravital <b>stains</b> are those that are either small or are pumped actively into live cells. Since supravital and intravital nature of the <b>staining</b> depends on the dye, a combination of supravital and vital dyes can also be used in a sophisticated way to better classify cells into distinct subsets (e.g. viable, dead, dying etc.).|$|R
50|$|Bismarck brown Y is a diazo dye. It {{is used in}} {{histology}} for <b>staining</b> tissues. It <b>stains</b> acid mucins {{to yellow}} color. It {{can be used with}} live cells. It is also used to <b>stain</b> cartilage in bone specimens, as one of Kasten's Schiff-type reagents in the periodic acid-Schiff <b>stain</b> to <b>stain</b> cellulose, and in Feulgen <b>stain</b> to <b>stain</b> DNA.|$|R
5|$|A {{memorial}} <b>stained</b> {{glass window}} was commissioned for display at Bayston Hill Memorial Hall (the local Village hall).|$|E
5|$|Cram {{designed}} the chapel {{with the assistance}} of Alexander Hoyle, a member of his firm. Albert M. Friend, a faculty member in Princeton's Department of Art and Archaeology, {{played a central role in}} planning the iconography. It was built by Matthews Construction Company, which worked on several projects on Princeton's campus. Among those who contributed to the design of <b>stained</b> glass windows were Charles Connick, Henry Lee Willet (of the studio that would become Willet Hauser), and Philadelphia-based <b>stained</b> glass artist Nicola d'Ascenzo.|$|E
5|$|From {{the early}} 12th century, French {{builders}} developed the Gothic style, {{marked by the}} use of rib vaults, pointed arches, flying buttresses, and large <b>stained</b> glass windows. It was used mainly in churches and cathedrals, and continued in use until the 16th century in much of Europe. Classic examples of Gothic architecture include Chartres Cathedral and Reims Cathedral in France as well as Salisbury Cathedral in England. <b>Stained</b> glass became a crucial element in the design of churches, which continued to use extensive wall-paintings, now almost all lost.|$|E
50|$|Papanicolaou <b>stain</b> (also Papanicolaou's <b>stain</b> and Pap <b>stain)</b> is a multichromatic <b>staining</b> cytological {{technique}} {{developed by}} George Papanikolaou, {{the father of}} cytopathology.|$|R
50|$|Positive {{affinity}} {{for a specific}} <b>stain</b> may be designated by the suffix -philic. For example, tissues that <b>stain</b> with an azure <b>stain</b> may {{be referred to as}} azurophilic. This may also be used for more generalized <b>staining</b> properties, such as acidophilic for tissues that <b>stain</b> by acidic <b>stains</b> (most notably eosin), basophilic when <b>staining</b> in basic dyes, and amphophilic when <b>staining</b> with either acid or basic dyes. In contrast, chromophobic tissues do not take up coloured dye readily.|$|R
50|$|Mycobacteria are {{classical}} acid-fast organisms. <b>Stains</b> used in {{evaluation of}} tissue specimens or microbiological specimens include Fites <b>stain,</b> Ziehl-Neelsen <b>stain,</b> and Kinyoun <b>stain.</b>|$|R
5|$|Geometric {{patterns}} {{occur in}} a variety of forms in Islamic art and architecture including kilim carpets, Persian girih and Moroccan zellige tilework, muqarnas decorative vaulting, jali pierced stone screens, ceramics, leather, <b>stained</b> glass, woodwork, and metalwork.|$|E
5|$|Hippolyte's son, Count Aimery de La Rochefoucauld {{continued}} {{to collect the}} souvenirs of his ancestors, turning the château {{into a sort of}} family museum. He redecorated the chapel and added <b>stained</b> glass windows.|$|E
5|$|In 2010 a <b>stained</b> {{glass window}} was {{uncovered}} in the abbey vaults. The design around {{the window is}} by William Burges.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Stain</b> is a {{water or}} thinner based dye {{that allows for}} {{the grain of the}} wood to show through. When it comes to {{application}} there are two main categories of <b>staining.</b> wiping <b>stains</b> and spray <b>stains.</b> Wiping <b>stains</b> are sprayed on to the Wood and then wiped off whereas the spray <b>stain</b> is left to dry without wiping. One thing to keep in mind when it comes to <b>staining</b> it would is that the color of the wood also affects the end result. For example, a <b>stain</b> on oak Will not be the same color as the same <b>stain</b> on Maple.|$|R
50|$|The related <b>stains</b> {{are known}} as the {{buffered}} Wright <b>stain,</b> the Wright-Giemsa <b>stain</b> (a combination of Wright and Giemsa <b>stains),</b> and the buffered Wright-Giemsa <b>stain,</b> and specific instructions depend on the solutions being used, which may include eosin Y, azure B, and methylene blue (some commercial preparations combine solutions to simplify <b>staining).</b> The May-Grünwald <b>stain,</b> which produces a more intense coloration, also takes a longer time to perform.|$|R
5000|$|Field <b>stain</b> is a {{histological}} {{method for}} <b>staining</b> of blood smears. It {{is used for}} <b>staining</b> thick blood films in order to discover malarial parasites. Field's <b>stain</b> is a version of a Romanowsky <b>stain,</b> used for rapid processing of the specimens.|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} to painting and <b>stained</b> glass, Burne-Jones {{worked in a}} variety of crafts; including designing ceramic tiles, jewellery, tapestries, mosaics and book illustration, most famously designing woodcuts for the Kelmscott Press's Chaucer in 1896.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to isolate xylan-degrading {{microorganisms}} from local hot spring. The samples were taken from a local hot spring at Sungai Klah, Perak. They were screened for the best xylan degrader by using selective culture media. Then, the xylan degrader microorganism was characterized by using four <b>staining</b> method which were gram <b>staining,</b> acid-fast <b>staining,</b> simple <b>staining</b> and spore <b>staining.</b> The morphology of the microorganism was observed after all the <b>staining</b> was done by observing the changes of the <b>staining</b> colour. Based on the results, the microorganism was in rod shaped for simple <b>staining,</b> gram negative for gram <b>staining,</b> positive results for both spore and acid-fast <b>staining.</b> In conclusion, this <b>staining</b> method can be used to characterize the microorganism based on general information, so the microorganism was probably in genus Bacillus...|$|R

5|$|The east {{window is}} a {{memorial}} to Mrs Rosa Edwyna Powell (died 1860), of Nanteos, and her daughter Harriet Edwyna (died 1857), and was inserted by direction of the Will of her son George (died 1882). It depicts the Transfiguration of our Lord Jesus Christ. It was designed by Seddon and installed in 1884. There are other <b>stained</b> glass windows, including the three western lancets, filled with <b>stained</b> glass by the parishioners in 1894, {{in memory of the}} Reverend John Pugh, curate 1856–1861 and vicar 1861–1893.|$|E
2500|$|Visualising endospores under light {{microscopy}} {{can be difficult}} due to the impermeability of the endospore wall to dyes and <b>stains.</b> While the rest of a bacterial cell may <b>stain,</b> the endospore is left colourless. To combat this, a special <b>stain</b> technique called a Moeller <b>stain</b> is used. That allows the endospore to show up as red, {{while the rest of}} the cell <b>stains</b> blue. Another <b>staining</b> technique for endospores is the Schaeffer-Fulton <b>stain,</b> which <b>stains</b> endospores green and bacterial bodies red.

50|$|Differential <b>Staining</b> is a <b>staining</b> {{process which}} uses {{more than one}} {{chemical}} <b>stain.</b> Using multiple <b>stains</b> can better differentiate between different microorganisms or structures/cellular components of a single organism.|$|R
40|$|Flexible fiberoptic {{bronchoscopy}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} useful techniques for the diagnosis of pulmonary neoplasms. Whereas the diagnostic efficiency for visible lesions is satisfactory, the diagnostic rate on small, peripheral pulmonary lesions with bronchoscopy under fluoroscopic guidance remains unsatisfactory. 1 We developed a new <b>staining</b> method for cytologic specimens, using modified Gill-Shorr <b>stain,</b> that enables us to interpret the material immediately. Table I compares the modified Gill-Shorr <b>stain</b> with the original, showing the steps in the 2 <b>staining</b> methods.
