5|$|Though {{some groups}} {{advocate}} total sexual abstinence, {{by which they}} mean the avoidance of all <b>sexual</b> <b>activity,</b> {{in the context of}} birth control the term usually means abstinence from vaginal intercourse. Abstinence is 100% effective in preventing pregnancy; however, not everyone who intends to be abstinent refrains from all <b>sexual</b> <b>activity,</b> and in many populations there is a significant risk of pregnancy from nonconsensual sex.|$|E
5|$|Asexuality is {{the lack}} of sexual {{attraction}} to others, or low or absent interest in or desire for <b>sexual</b> <b>activity.</b> It may be considered the lack of a sexual orientation, or one of the variations thereof, alongside heterosexuality, homosexuality and bisexuality.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The {{co-occurrence of}} {{substance}} abuse and excessive <b>sexual</b> <b>activities</b> is acknowledged in research and treatment practice. Men seem particularly at risk for developing excessive <b>sexual</b> <b>activities.</b> Excessive <b>sexual</b> <b>activities</b> complicate substance abuse treatment, and clients with such co-occurring difficulties have considerable treatment needs. It is therefore considered important to investigate how male clients who had enacted excessive <b>sexual</b> <b>activities,</b> perceive their excessive <b>sexual</b> <b>activities,</b> and themselves. Design: Interviews were performed with five male clients in substance abuse treatment, who had enacted excessive <b>sexual</b> <b>activities.</b> The interviews concerned the participants’ perception of themselves and how they came to enact excessive <b>sexual</b> <b>activities.</b> The interviews were analyzed using thematic analysis. Results: Two major themes were identified. One theme concerned overwhelming shame and difficulties to discuss sexuality in treatment. The second theme concerned how perceptions about masculinity had influenced <b>sexual</b> <b>activities.</b> Sexuality was described as an absent topic in their previous and ongoing treatment, and the participants described a need to discuss sexuality. Implications: It seems important that future studies investigate how excessive <b>sexual</b> <b>activities</b> might be identified and handled in treatment. It also seems important to investigate how gender-perceptions might influence excessive <b>sexual</b> <b>activities.</b> As a suggestion, practitioners should address sexuality, shame and perceptions about gender during treatment.

5|$|In the church's teaching, <b>sexual</b> <b>activity</b> is {{reserved}} to married couples, whether in a sacramental marriage among Christians, or {{in a natural}} marriage where one or both spouses are unbaptised. Even in romantic relationships, particularly engagement to marriage, partners are called to practise continence, {{in order to test}} mutual respect and fidelity. Chastity in marriage requires in particular conjugal fidelity and protecting the fecundity of marriage. The couple must foster trust and honesty as well as spiritual and physical intimacy. <b>Sexual</b> <b>activity</b> must always be open to the possibility of life; the church calls this the procreative significance. It must likewise always bring a couple together in love; the church calls this the unitive significance.|$|E

5000|$|Clinicians {{distinguish}} between optional, preferred and exclusive paraphilias, though the terminology {{is not completely}} standardized. An [...] "optional" [...] paraphilia is an alternative route to sexual arousal.

5|$|Catholic {{teaching}} regarding sexuality {{calls for}} a practice of chastity, {{with a focus on}} maintaining the spiritual and bodily integrity of the human person.

25|$|Heterosexuality is {{the romantic}} or sexual {{attraction}} to the opposite sex. Heterosexual sexual practices are subject to laws in many places. In some countries, mostly those where religion has a strong influence on social policy, marriage laws serve the purpose of encouraging people to have sex only within marriage. Sodomy laws were seen as discouraging same-sex sexual practices, but may affect opposite-sex sexual practices. Laws also ban adults from committing sexual abuse, committing sexual acts with anyone under an age of consent, performing <b>sexual</b> <b>activities</b> in public, and engaging in <b>sexual</b> <b>activities</b> for money (prostitution). Though these laws cover both same-sex and opposite-sex <b>sexual</b> <b>activities,</b> they may differ in regard to punishment, and may be more frequently (or exclusively) enforced on those who engage in same-sex <b>sexual</b> <b>activities.</b>|$|R
50|$|Erogenous Sensitivity is {{measured}} by the capabilities to reach orgasms in genital <b>sexual</b> <b>activities,</b> like masturbation and intercourse. Many studies reviewed that both trans men and trans women have reported an increase of orgasms in both <b>sexual</b> <b>activities,</b> implying the possibilities to maintain or even enhance genital sensitivity after SRS.|$|R
50|$|A sex {{position}} is {{a position of}} the body that an individual or couple people may use for sexual intercourse or other <b>sexual</b> <b>activities.</b> <b>Sexual</b> acts are generally described by the positions the participants adopt in order to perform those acts. Though sexual intercourse generally involves penetration of the body of one person by another, sex positions commonly involve penetrative or non-penetrative <b>sexual</b> <b>activities.</b>|$|R
5|$|Diseases such as {{chlamydia}} and gonorrhoea {{are also}} important causes of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) and subsequent infertility in women. Another important consequence of some STIs such as genital herpes and syphilis {{increase the risk of}} acquiring HIV by three-fold, and can also influence its transmission progression. Worldwide, women and girls are at greater risk of HIV/AIDS. STIs are in turn associated with unsafe <b>sexual</b> <b>activity</b> that is often unconsensual.|$|E
5|$|Dopamine {{agonists}} produce significant, although usually mild, {{side effects}} including drowsiness, hallucinations, insomnia, nausea, and constipation. Sometimes side effects appear {{even at a}} minimal clinically effective dose, leading the physician {{to search for a}} different drug. Agonists have been related to impulse control disorders (such as compulsive <b>sexual</b> <b>activity,</b> eating, gambling and shopping) even more strongly than levodopa. They tend to be more expensive than levodopa.|$|E
5|$|Dopaminergic {{medications}} {{that are used}} to treat Parkinson's disease are sometimes associated with the development of a dopamine dysregulation syndrome, which involves the overuse of dopaminergic medication and medication-induced compulsive engagement in natural rewards like gambling and <b>sexual</b> <b>activity.</b> The latter behaviors are similar to those observed in individuals with a behavioral addiction.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} what <b>sexual</b> <b>activities</b> and behaviors college students are participating in, including the use of sexual enhancement products during both partnered and solo <b>sexual</b> <b>activities.</b> Pleasure and <b>sexual</b> satisfaction remain largely absent from today 2 ̆ 7 s sexuality education curricula, resulting in most young adults not being aware of the importance of 2 ̆ 2 sexual pleasure, including autoeroticism, as a source of physical, psychological, intellectual and spiritual well-being 2 ̆ 2 (WAS, 1994). This study looked at college students and their the use of sexual enhancement products during partnered and solo <b>sexual</b> <b>activities,</b> in order to provide a set of baseline measures from which improvements to currently sexuality education can be made. In particular, this study aimed to inform education regarding positive sexual health benefits including pleasure and sexual satisfaction. 2 ̆ 2 Methods 2 ̆ 2. A sample of 956 college students completed a cross-sectional survey on sexual pleasure and enhancement. The survey examined students 2 ̆ 7 current and past sexual behaviors, sexual satisfaction, sexual comfort, use of sexual enhancement products, motivation, and beliefs and attitudes associated with sexual enhancement products. 2 ̆ 2 Results 2 ̆ 2. Findings indicated that age was associated with solo product use (p 3 ̆c. 001) and partnered product use (p 3 ̆c. 001). Participants over the age of 25 are more likely to use products during their solo and partnered <b>sexual</b> <b>activities</b> than 18 - 24 years olds. Results suggest that individuals who use products are more sexually satisfied in regard to masturbation, (p =. 001), solo <b>sexual</b> <b>activities</b> (p =. 004), partnered masturbation (p =. 002), partnered <b>sexual</b> <b>activities</b> (p =. 002), ability to have orgasms during solo <b>sexual</b> <b>activities</b> (p 3 ̆c. 001), and partnered <b>sexual</b> <b>activities</b> (p =. 003), than individuals who do not use products. Results indicate that college students are participating in product use during their solo and partnered <b>sexual</b> <b>activities,</b> and there is a lack of education in college sexuality curricula to educate students on products and pleasure. This study aimed to better educate health professionals on the need for new innovative venues that may be appropriate for the delivery of sexual health education on college campuses...|$|R
