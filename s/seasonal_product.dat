This method of media planning allows the messages and themes of the advertising campaign to continue to reach consumers while conserving advertising funds.|$|E

Sales doubled with these new products as well as efforts to promote the use of cranberry juice in mixed drinks, all leading to his nickname of [...] "Cranapple Ed".|$|E

40|$|Motivated by the {{industrial}} practice, we investigate {{in this paper}} the pre-season inventory and pricing decisions for fashion retailers. Before the selling season, a retailer can place orders for a seasonal fashion product from her supplier at two distinct stages via two different delivery modes. Market information from the sales of a pre-seasonal product is collected and used to update the demand forecast of the <b>seasonal</b> <b>product</b> at the succeeding stages by using Bayesian approach. We formulate a dynamic optimization problem and obtain the optimal stocking policy. After the ordered <b>seasonal</b> <b>product</b> has arrived and just {{before the start of}} the selling season, the retailer can determine the optimal selling price of the product with respect to the latest demand information, and the amount of product on-hand. We study the pricing policy under different objectives. Sensitivity analysis is carried out and the features of the policies are revealed. Managerial insights are generated.

On the other hand, the firm can advertise the product at every time of each seasonality period. The multiperiod problem is formulated as a discrete time dynamic programming problem...|$|E
