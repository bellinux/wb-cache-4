5|$|An {{assistant}} of LeHand's, Grace Tully, {{took over}} as Roosevelt's secretary, but was never a companion for Roosevelt {{in the same way}} as LeHand had been. After Missy departed the White House, <b>she</b> <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> FDR again, though he did keep in touch with letters, phone calls and by sending gifts. In the fall of 1941, FDR rewrote his will to leave half of the annual income from his estate (which was eventually probated at more than $3 million) for LeHand's care, and half to Eleanor. The will stated that upon LeHand's death the income would go to Eleanor, with the principal eventually divided equally among his children. As LeHand died before FDR, her half reverted to Eleanor.|$|E
5|$|Fischer and Cristina {{often did}} outdoor {{activities}} together, but Fischer's stepmother {{thought they were}} only friends. She said that <b>she</b> <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> them hold hands or behave {{in a way that}} suggested intimacy. According to his friends, Fischer went with Cristina to South Padre Island, Texas, during spring break and had sex with her in her parents' condominium. They said that he did not brag about it, and in fact seemed to regret his decision. Cristina denied this ever happened. Later that year they attended St. Joe's prom together. In June 1992, Fischer broke up with Cristina; he told one of his friends that their relationship was only physical, and he did not feel an emotional attachment to her. Fischer had given Cristina his ring while they were dating, and once they broke up he asked her to return it. Cristina refused.|$|E

5|$|James's father, Darnley, {{was murdered}} on 10 February 1567 at Kirk o' Field, Edinburgh, perhaps in revenge {{for the killing}} of Rizzio. James {{inherited}} his father's titles of Duke of Albany and Earl of Ross. Mary was already unpopular, and her marriage on 15 May 1567 to James Hepburn, 4th Earl of Bothwell, who was widely suspected of murdering Darnley, heightened widespread bad feeling towards her. In June 1567, Protestant rebels arrested Mary and imprisoned her in Loch Leven Castle; <b>she</b> <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> her son again. She was forced to abdicate on 24 July 1567 in favour of the infant James and to appoint her illegitimate half-brother, James Stewart, Earl of Moray, as regent.|$|E
5|$|Chopra saw {{the deal}} as an {{opportunity}} to represent South Asians and break Indian stereotypes in Hollywood and the United States in general. In the process, she became the first South Asian to headline an American network drama series. She revealed that when she was in school , <b>she</b> <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> anyone on television who looked like her, and she found it really weird because she thought there were so many people of South Asian descent in America and {{in other parts of the}} world. She also revealed that she did not want to be a stereotype of what Indians were usually seen as in global pop culture, saying that Indians never talk like Apu from The Simpsons. After signing the deal and being given all the 26 pilot scripts that ABC was developing for the 2015–2016 television season, Chopra chose Quantico. Having appeared in over fifty films at that time, the series was also Chopra's first ever audition, which she found very new and nerve-wracking at the same time.|$|E
5|$|HMS Campania was a {{seaplane}} {{tender and}} aircraft carrier, converted from an elderly ocean liner by the Royal Navy {{early in the}} First World War. After her conversion was completed in mid-1915 the ship spent her time conducting trials and exercises with the Grand Fleet. These revealed {{the need for a}} longer flight deck to allow larger aircraft to take off, and she was modified accordingly. Campania missed the Battle of Jutland in May 1916, but made a number of patrols with elements of the Grand Fleet. <b>She</b> <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> combat and was soon relegated to a training role because of her elderly machinery. In November 1918 Campania was anchored with the capital ships of the Grand Fleet when a sudden storm caused her anchors to drag. She hit several of the ships and the collisions punctured her hull; she slowly sank, with no loss of life.|$|E

5|$|Solanas {{said that}} she {{regularly}} suffered sexual abuse {{at the hands of}} her father. Her parents divorced when she was young, and her mother remarried shortly afterwards. Solanas disliked her stepfather and began rebelling against her mother, becoming a truant. As a child, she wrote insults for children to use on one another, for the cost of a dime. She beat up a boy in high school who was bothering a younger girl, and also hit a nun. Because of her rebellious behavior, her mother sent her to be raised by her grandparents in 1949. Solanas said that her grandfather was a violent alcoholic who often beat her. When she was 15, she left her grandparents and became homeless. In 1953, she gave birth to a son, fathered by a married sailor. The child, named David (later David Blackwell by adoption), was taken away from Solanas and <b>she</b> <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> him again.|$|E

25|$|Both sides {{employed}} late 19th-century military technology, such as breech-loading {{rifles and}} cannons, remote-controlled land mines, armor-piercing shells, naval torpedoes, torpedo boats, and purpose-built landing craft. The {{second generation of}} ironclads (i.e. designed after the Battle of Hampton Roads) were employed in battle for the first time. That was significant for a conflict where no major power was involved, and attracted British, French, and U.S. observers. During the war, Peru developed the Toro Submarino ("Submarine Bull"). <b>She</b> <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> action, and was scuttled at the end to prevent her capture.|$|E
25|$|The {{victims of}} the first attack, Jimmy Hollis and Mary Jeanne Larey, were the only victims to give a {{description}} of their attacker. They described him as being six feet tall with a white mask over his face with holes cut out for his eyes and mouth. Although Hollis believed {{he was a young}} dark-tanned white man under 30 years old, Larey believed he was a light-skinned African-American. The only other surviving victim was Katie Starks, but <b>she</b> <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> her assailant. Since Hollis and Larey were the only survivors to give a description, it cannot be known if the killer wore a mask during the other attacks.|$|E
25|$|In 1819-1820, Droste spent a {{year with}} the Haxthausens at Bökerhof, {{interrupted}} only by a stay at the nearby spa town of Bad Driburg, where she hoped {{to find a cure}} for her health problems. Here she became romantically involved with Heinrich Straube (1794–1847), a law student with literary interests, who was a friend of her step-uncle August. What happened next is unclear, but it appears that some members of the Haxthausen family, led by Annette's step-aunt Anna (who was in fact four years her junior), disapproved of the relationship because Straube was a middle-class Protestant, and they devised a scheme {{to put an end to}} it. While Straube was away pursuing his legal studies at the University of Göttingen, they persuaded another young man with literary ambitions, August von Arnswaldt, who came from an upper-class Protestant family, to pretend to pay court to Annette. At first flattered by Arnswaldt's attentions, she gave some indications she was in love with him, before telling him she really loved Straube. By this time it was too late, however, as Arnswaldt had all the evidence he needed. He travelled to Göttingen and told Straube of Annette's behaviour. The two men wrote a joint letter (which has not been preserved), breaking off all contact with her. <b>She</b> <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> either man again. A few years later, Arnswaldt married Anna von Haxthausen, the ringleader of the intrigue. Straube became a lawyer in Kassel and married in 1824. When he died in 1847, a lock of Droste's hair was found among his possessions. The affair was a catastrophe for Droste and damaged her future marriage prospects. Shocked by the role the Haxthausens had played in the intrigue, she refused to visit Bökerhof for the next 18 years.|$|E

500|$|Natasha Yar's origins are {{explained}} in the season four episode [...] "". She was born on the planet Turkana IV in 2337. She had a younger sister named Ishara (Beth Toussaint), who was born five years after her. Shortly after Ishara's birth, the girls' parents were killed and they were taken in by other people. However, they were subsequently abandoned and Tasha was required to look after her sister on her own. The government on the planet had collapsed, and the sisters were forced to scavenge for food while avoiding rape gangs. In 2352, aged 15, Tasha managed to leave Turkana IV. <b>She</b> <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> Ishara again; the latter joined the [...] "Coalition", one of the factions on the planet before Tasha left. Tasha refused to join the cadres on the planet, blaming them for her parent's deaths.|$|E
500|$|Gilroy {{specifically}} {{wrote the}} role of Nina for his wife Rene Russo; this was because he felt that Nina could easily {{be reduced to a}} [...] "hard-nosed corporate bitch", but Russo would bring a sense of vulnerability to the character. Although Russo was unaware of Gilroy's intention while writing the script, she was interested in performing the role, as she had never portrayed a desperate woman in a film. Russo initially struggled with the character, because <b>she</b> <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> herself as the victim. In order to accurately portray the character, Russo had to recall memories of when she crossed moral boundaries in her life as a result of desperation and fear. In contrast to the preparations Gyllenhaal and Ahmed took for their roles, Russo did not consult news directors or journalists, as she believed that Nina could be in any business, {{and did not want to}} hinder her character to one profession.|$|E

500|$|Through this {{marriage}} Sneyd became step-mother to Edgeworth's four surviving children {{by his first}} wife, Anna Maria, ranging from seven months to nine years in age; Richard, Maria, who became a writer in her own right, Emmeline and Anna Maria. On encountering her new family she observed that Maria, then aged five, was exhibiting behavioural problems, and expressed her views that speedy and consistent punishment were the keys to ensuring good behaviour in children, a view she proceeded to practice. However she believed that such discipline needed to be imposed [...] "before the age of 5 or 6", and was therefore rather late {{in the case of}} the older children, however she imposed a strict discipline. Following a period of ill health on Sneyd's part, Maria Edgeworth was sent away to boarding school in Derby (1775–1781), and later London upon the death of Honora Sneyd (1781–1782). Similarly, her older brother Richard was sent to Charterhouse (1776–1778) and then went to sea, and <b>she</b> <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> him again. Later Richard Edgeworth would comment on how difficult the first two years were for Sneyd in her new role as stepmother to undisciplined children, a role her relatives had advised her against.|$|E
500|$|By 1968, Smith {{began to}} feel large amounts of {{pressure}} from the music business. The stress of touring, recording, promoting, {{and trying to keep}} a personal life led Smith to contemplate the possibility of suicide. Although she thought about suicide, Smith later clarified that <b>she</b> <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> the idea as an actual possibility. These pressures eventually led Smith to seek solace in both her family life and religion, becoming a Born Again Christian in the spring of 1968. Although she did not give up her music career completely, Smith did balance it with a lighter schedule in order to avoid stress. In 1968 and 1969, Smith also began to record darker songs, including the single [...] "Ribbon of Darkness", among others. Smith stated that it was reflection on her personal life, after recently divorcing her first husband Jerry Smith. Despite her recent personal troubles, Smith continued to enjoy the same commercial success she had before. In 1969 her next single [...] "You and Your Sweet Love" [...] (written by Bill Anderson) reached No.6 on the Billboard Magazine Hot Country Singles chart. This was followed by another top ten single in 1970, entitled [...] "I Never Once Stopped Loving You", which reached No.5 on the same singles chart. Between 1969 and 1970, Smith released two collaborative albums with American country artist Nat Stuckey called Young Love and Sunday Morning with Nat Stuckey and Connie Smith, the latter of which was a gospel album.|$|E
500|$|At the {{outbreak}} of World War I in July 1914, the three ships of the Monarch class were serving as the V Battleship Division, deployed as coastal defense ships. They also served as training ships, and were used to bombard coastal positions {{during the early years}} of the war. In August 1914, Budapest was transferred from Pula to Cattaro to shell Mount Lovcen. On 9 August 1914 Monarch shelled the French radio station at Budva. She also bombarded the Montenegrin radio station off Bar on 17August and another station off Volovica Point on 19August where she attacked the local radio station and barracks. Following these operations, Monarch served as a harbor defense ship. On 28–29December 1915 [...] Budapest supported the cruisers and destroyers of the Austro-Hungarian Navy that were to raid Durazzo, but the detachment returned to port without having opened fire on the enemy. On 9January 1916, Budapest again bombarded the fortifications on Mount Lovcen, and helped to capture the enemy-held mountain. In late 1917 Budapest and Wien were sent to Trieste, and participated in shelling Italian troops in the Gulf of Trieste. On 10December 1917, two Italian torpedo boats managed to penetrate the port of Trieste undetected, and fired torpedoes at the battleships Budapest and Wien. The torpedo fired at Budapest missed, but Wien was hit twice and sank in less than five minutes in the shallow water of the Trieste harbor. Forty-sixmen serving on Wien were killed in the attack. Budapest was subsequently given the task that Monarch had been performing for over three years, and was demoted to a floating barrack for German U-boat crews. In June 1918 Budapest was renovated and had a [...] L/17 howitzer installed in her bow to use for coastal bombardment, but <b>she</b> <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> action with the new gun in place. At the end of the war in 1918, the remaining Monarch-class battleships, Budapest and Monarch, were handed over to Great Britain as war reparations. In 1920 the two ships were sold for scrap to Italy, and were broken up between 1920 and 1922.|$|E
