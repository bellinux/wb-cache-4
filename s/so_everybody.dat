500|$|Tong's {{character}} Chao {{has drawn}} mixed reception, often being mistaken {{as a real}} person. As a result for posting racist content, the account had been previously suspended {{for a period of}} fourteen days after showing a video deemed to mock African-Americans. Gabriella Nomura of The Vancouver Sun has branded Chao as [...] "a breath of politically incorrect fresh air", while Kevin Tang of Amped Asia has called him [...] "racist, sexist, vulgar, and self-deprecating" [...] but also [...] "one of the most funny Youtube celebrities". a-Tunes.net said that Chao's blackface performance, a mockery of African American people, had [...] "crossed the line". However, viewership has been positive. The [...] "Canton Style" [...] music video– a parody of Korean singer-rapper Psy's [...] "Gangnam Style"– amassed 1.1 million views within three days of its uploading.

500|$|... "Take Me Home" [...] was {{released}} by Polydor Records in the United Kingdom on August 13, 2001 and in the United States as an import. It {{was released}} as a legal digital download and an enhanced maxi CD single; both featured the Ellis-Bextor cover, B-side [...] "Sparkle" [...] and a Jewels & Stone remix, while the latter contained the song's music video for the song. The single was also pressed as an edition dubbed the [...] "Mixes & Remixes" [...] EP, released only in France. A 12-inch single was also pressed in the United Kingdom, with remixes. Two AllMusic writers reviewed the song. Upon its release as a single, Dean Carlson gave it a negative rating of {{one and a half}} star out of five, commenting: [...] " [...] Ellis Bextor is well aware of what's required for beating the likes of Victoria Beckham and Emma Bunton at their own game—simply take Cher's [...] "Take Me Home" [...] and add one disco beat circa ABBA's 'Fernando', being mindful to avoid its cocaine harmonies and the air of free love , techno-fy it with random fiddly bits, sing with the breathless detachment of someone getting a massage from a lumberjack, and chuck in some remixes just <b>so</b> <b>everybody</b> knows that you're not utterly out of step." [...] After its parent album's release, Kelvin Hayes denoted it as one of the album's strongest tracks, as did Toby Manning from Q. For Yahoo! Music, Gary Crossing wrote that the album [...] "start well with the song", while describing it as Spiller-esque. Betty Clarke of The Guardian regarded [...] "Take Me Home" [...] as a [...] "pleasant enough song", though she called the production and Ellis-Bextor's vocals [...] "more tired than sexy".|$|E

2500|$|Within the {{structure}} of the program, there were two enduring elements. The first was the [...] "Soul Train Scramble Board", where two dancers are given 60 seconds to unscramble a set of letters that form the name of that show's performer or a notable person in African American history. In describing the person's renown, the host concluded their description with the phrase [...] "...whose name you should know".

When the host asked where her moniker derived from, Cardi B responded with the distilled beverage Bacardi, as people would call her that, as her sister is nicknamed Hennessy Carolina, referencing the French cognac: [...] "My sister's name, her name is Hennessy, <b>so</b> <b>everybody</b> used to be like Bacardi to me [...] then I shortened it to Cardi B, and the 'B' stands for whatever [...] depending on the day." ...|$|E

Kangura requested that all Hutu be vigilant against the Tutsi, who they called Inyenzi (cockroaches), as well as those considered accomplices.

He later remarked that [...] "I remember that what was generally happening was that everybody wanted to give me work, for fear that I would just be given other work by their rivals. <b>So</b> <b>everybody</b> was offering me things."

2500|$|Although {{the book}} has always been popular and {{considered}} a children's classic by many literary critics, a number of prominent individuals have spoken unfavorably of the novel over the years. Children's novelist and literary historian John Rowe Townsend has described the book as [...] "fantasy of an almost literally nauseating kind" [...] and accused it of [...] "astonishing insensitivity" [...] regarding the original portrayal of the Oompa-Loompas as black pygmies, although Dahl did revise this in later editions. Another novelist, Eleanor Cameron, compared the book to the sweets that form its subject matter, commenting that it is [...] "delectable and soothing while we are undergoing the brief sensory pleasure it affords but leaves us poorly nourished with our taste dulled for better fare."Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (together with Charlotte's Web [...] ) is probably the book most read aloud by those teachers who have no idea, apparently, what other books they might read to the children. Charlie, again along with Charlotte's Web, is always {{at the top of}} the best sellers among children's books, put there by fond aunts and grandmothers and parents buying it as the perfect gift, knowing no better. And I do think this a most curious coupling: on the one hand, one of the most tasteless books ever written for children; and on the other, one of the best. We are reminded of Ford Madox Ford's observation that only two classes of books are universal in their appeal: the very best and the very worst. [...] is like candy (the chief excitement and lure of Charlie) in that it is delectable and soothing while we are undergoing the brief sensory pleasure it affords but leaves us poorly nourished with our taste dulled for better fare. I think it will be admitted of the average TV show that goes on from week to week that there is no time, either from the point of view of production or the time allowed for showing, to work deeply at meaning or characterisation. All interest depends upon the constant, unremitting excitement of the turns of plot. And if character or likelihood of action – that is, inevitability – must be wrenched to fit the necessities of plot, there is no time to be concerned about this either by the director or by the audience. Nor will the tuned-in, turned-on, keyed-up television watcher give the superficial quality of the show so much as a second thought. He has been temporarily amused; what is there to complain about? And like all those nursing at the electronic bosom in McLuhan's global village (as he likes to call it), <b>so</b> <b>everybody</b> in Willy Wonka's chocolate factory is enclosed in its intoxicating confines forever: all the workers, including the little Oompa-Loompas brought over from Africa and, by the end of the book, Charlie and his entire family.}} ...|$|E
