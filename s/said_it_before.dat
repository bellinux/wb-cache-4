500|$|... "Providence" [...] {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from television critics. Jessica Morgan from Television Without Pity awarded the episode a B+ rating. John Keegan from Critical Myth gave the episode a largely positive review and awarded it a 9 out of 10. He wrote, [...] "Overall, this episode took the promising {{beginning of the}} last episode and delivered a strong and surprising larger meaning to {{the pieces of the}} mythology we’ve seen over the past few seasons. I’ve <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>before,</b> and I’ll say it again… those who bash these episodes simply because they relate to the “new direction” ought to be ashamed of themselves. With this kind of creativity, this series could easily end {{in a way that makes}} the entire series one seamless tapestry." [...] Jeffrey Robinson from DVD Talk concluded that [...] "Providence", along with the previous episode [...] "Provenance", [...] "does a fairly good job without including Duchovny" [...] due to its adherence to [...] "the series' main storyline [...] the government conspiracies." ...|$|E
500|$|Television {{critics were}} more {{favorable}} than {{not in their}} response to [...] "Mash Off". Erica Futterman of Rolling Stone felt that the series returned to form in the episode, and commented: [...] "We've <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>before</b> and we'll say it again: we like our Glee with just enough ridiculousness, and this week had it." [...] Entertainment Weekly journalist Abby West noted that she loved {{the fact that it}} [...] "was a bullying episode that snuck up on us". Raymund Flandez of The Wall Street Journal opined that [...] "Mash Off" [...] {{was one of the best}} installments of Glee, and cited the episode's storylines as highlights: [...] "The mash-up episodes every season can be hit or miss, but this year was perfected to the nth degree." [...] Amy Reiter of the Los Angeles Times wrote that there was plenty of [...] "airy fun to be found" [...] in [...] "Mash Off", but added that [...] "underneath all the silly fake mustaches and snappy quotes about root-beer fountains and robot teachers beat a very dark baboon heart. In the end, that murky, telltale undercurrent burst to the fore, like a ... slap in the face, leaving us gasping and a little confused." [...] Houston Chronicle Bobby Hankinson stated that it was [...] "surprisingly good", and that [...] "Mash Off" [...] was a [...] "solid hour of television that was bursting with fantastic musical numbers and some really gratifying narrative developments". Michael Slezak of TV Line said that the episode contributed to a revitalization of the quality of the show's third season.|$|E
2500|$|Lynch has hung {{a plaque}} {{in his office}} with a quote from Spider-Man, [...] "With great power comes great responsibility." [...] Lynch said he got the {{inspiration}} for the plaque from his son, who <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>before</b> his inauguration in 2003.|$|E
5000|$|You know, I <b>said</b> <b>it</b> once <b>before,</b> a {{few days}} ago, that Kirk Gibson was not the Most Valuable Player; that the Most Valuable Player for the Dodgers was Tinkerbell. But, tonight, I think Tinkerbell backed off for Kirk Gibson. And, look at Eckersley - shocked to his toes! ...|$|R

5000|$|In 2012, Bob Marley's {{former girlfriend}} Esther Anderson {{claimed that the}} lyrics, [...] "Sheriff John Brown always hated me, For what, I don't know: Every time I plant a seed, He <b>said</b> kill <b>it</b> <b>before</b> <b>it</b> grow" [...] are {{actually}} about Marley being very opposed to her use of birth control pills; Marley supposedly substituted the word [...] "doctor" [...] with sheriff.|$|R
2500|$|While {{reviewing}} the third season, Andy Swift of HollywoodLife.com compared McCord to Joan Collins, stating that she [...] "gives every scene 110 percent". Entertainment Weeklys Archana Ram wrote, [...] "I've <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>before,</b> and I'll say it again: AnnaLynne McCord {{is the best}} part of 90210. And last night, she proved it again by giving us a glimpse of all the colors of the Naomi rainbow—bitchy, scared, confident, relieved, and more." ...|$|E
2500|$|Geoff Davies of Probe Plus {{recalled}} that after hearing a test pressing of Back in the D.H.S.S, John Peel said [...] "Geoff, what's this, I've just played the first side of this, what is it, tell me, it's just fantastic and all". Other famous Peel quotes about the band include [...] "I've <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>before,</b> a national treasure, there's {{no question about}} it. When I die, I {{want them to be}} buried with me." [...] (14 August 1996) and [...] "In a decently ordered society, members of Half Man Half Biscuit would be routinely carried shoulder high through the streets of every city they visited" [...] (10 July 1997).|$|E
60|$|THE ORDERLY (civilly). I dont mind that, sir. Its human. Its English. Why couldnt {{you have}} <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>before?</b> (He goes out).|$|E
6000|$|... "As I <b>said</b> <b>before,</b> <b>it</b> is a {{delicate}} question, but I did not think so. Her husband {{struck me as a}} particularly poor sample, sir." ...|$|R
6000|$|And as we knelt together, and I <b>said</b> <b>it,</b> the 51st Psalm {{came to my}} mind, and I {{went through}} it, oh! how {{differently}} from when I had <b>said</b> <b>it</b> the day <b>before.</b> [...] "Ah!" [...] {{he said at the}} end, [...] "thank you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ah!' thought Mr Chuckster, {{looking out}} of window, 'anybody but me! Snobby before me, of course. He didn't happen to take that {{particular}} five-pound note, but I have not the smallest doubt that he's always up to something of that sort. I always <b>said</b> <b>it,</b> long <b>before</b> this came out. Devilish pretty girl that! 'Pon my soul, an amazing little creature!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{drive me}} to say so, as {{otherwise}} I should be a hypocrite. Of course I ought not to have <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>before</b> Mr. Dalrymple." ...|$|E
60|$|Bennydeck saw the change. Was it {{possible}} that the child's sudden appearance had startled her? Kitty had something to say, and <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>before</b> he could speak.|$|E
60|$|MYRRHINA. Once as I {{was passing}} through the market place I heard a sophist from Cilicia {{say that there is}} only one God. He <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>before</b> many people.|$|E
6000|$|... "All the same, as I <b>said</b> <b>before,</b> <b>it's</b> too bad of--of Carter to set you {{two babies}} {{on a job}} like this. Now, don't get offended, Miss--er----" ...|$|R
6000|$|In {{half an hour}} more, Miss Ladd joined Alban on {{the little}} plot of grass behind the cottage. [...] "I bring Emily's reply to your letter," [...] she <b>said.</b> [...] "Read <b>it,</b> <b>before</b> you speak to me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Leaping Horse {{can feel}} {{snow in the}} air,' he <b>said.</b> 'If <b>it</b> snows <b>before</b> morning, good; if not, the Utes will tell their {{children}} how many lives the scalps of the Englishman and the Seneca cost.' ...|$|R

6000|$|Hendry's {{was usually}} a blank face, {{but it must}} have looked troubled now, for Tosh was about to say, [...] "Hendry, you're keeping {{something}} back," [...] when the precentor <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>before</b> him.|$|E
6000|$|... 'No--no. What I mean is, {{that the}} men who despise pianos {{do it as a}} rule from their teeth, merely for fashion's sake, because cleverer men have <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>before</b> them--not from the {{experience}} of their ears.' ...|$|E
6000|$|At twenty-five {{past six}} I {{turned on the}} hot water in the bath, and covertly {{swallowed}} a small glass of brandy. I then said, [...] "Half-past six; time for little boys to be in bed." [...] I <b>said</b> <b>it</b> in the matter-of-fact voice of one made free of the company of parents, as if I had <b>said</b> <b>it</b> often <b>before,</b> {{and would have to}} say it often again, and as if there was nothing particularly delicious to me in hearing myself say it. I tried to say it in that way.|$|R
60|$|He shook Hereward by both hands, clapt {{him on the}} back, swore {{with many}} oaths, {{that he had heard}} of his fame in all lands, that he always said that he would turn out a {{champion}} and a gallant knight, and had <b>said</b> <b>it</b> long <b>before</b> he killed the bear. As for killing it, it was no more than he expected, and nothing to what Hereward had done since, and would do yet.|$|R
6000|$|... "I do;--though, as I have <b>said</b> <b>before,</b> <b>it</b> {{is a case}} {{of feeling}} sure, and not being sure. Had that Italian woman been really the widow, {{somebody}} would have brought her case forward more loudly." ...|$|R
60|$|I've <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>before,</b> and I'll say it again--girls are rummy. Old Pop Kipling {{never said}} a truer word than when he made that crack about the f. of the s. being more d. than the m.|$|E
6000|$|The man {{showed more}} courage than Jimmy had {{expected}} from his appearance, {{though it was}} clearly the courage of desperation. He braced himself stiffly, and his laugh was contemptuous. [...] "I guess you're going to be sorry for this. You've <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>before</b> a third party." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We cannot {{stay where}} we are, of course," [...] said the Duke. The Duke was privileged {{to say as}} much as that.

6000|$|... "Just {{what he has}} <b>said</b> <b>before.</b> <b>It</b> is not so {{much that}} he wishes me to be a clergyman, as that he does not wish me to have lost all my time up to this." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Bill, dear, I haven't <b>said</b> {{anything}} about <b>it</b> <b>before</b> but don't {{you see that}} there's my side to be considered too? I only showed you that you could never possibly know that I loved you. How am I {{to know that you}} really love me?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{want you}} to hypnotize me!" [...] she <b>said.</b> [...] "Do <b>it</b> <b>before</b> the dawn, for I feel that then I can speak, and speak freely. Be quick, for the time is short!" [...] Without a word he motioned her to sit up in bed.|$|R
6000|$|... "You've been so kind to us, sir, that I {{should like}} {{to do the best}} I can for you in return. I know something, Sir Henry, and perhaps I should have <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>before,</b> but it was long after the inquest that I found it out. I've never breathed a word about it yet to mortal man. It's about poor Sir Charles's death." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well;--I have. I {{should have}} <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>before,</b> only that that other man was here." [...] He was {{blushing}} now,--up {{to the roots}} of his hair, and felt that he was in a difficulty. There are men, to whom such moments of their lives are pleasurable, but Brooke Burgess was not one of them. He would have been glad to have had it done and over,--so that then he might take pleasure in it.|$|E
6000|$|At {{the thought}} a sob rose, and poor Jill laid {{her head down}} on her lap to cry with all her heart, feeling very helpless, small, and forsaken alone there on the great sea. In the midst of her tears came the thought, [...] "When people are in danger, they ask God to save them;" [...] and, {{slipping}} down upon her knees, she said her prayer as she had never <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>before,</b> for when human help seems gone we turn to Him as naturally as lost children cry to their father, and feel sure that he will hear and answer them.|$|E
6000|$|Somehow it didn't {{seem to me}} that I <b>said</b> <b>it</b> was Mary <b>before,</b> so I didn't look up--seemed to me I <b>said</b> <b>it</b> was Sarah; so I felt sort of cornered, and was afeared maybe I {{was looking}} it, too. I wished the woman would say {{something}} more; the longer she set still the uneasier I was. But now she says: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I should {{certainly}} like it, signor, greatly; but, as you <b>said</b> <b>before,</b> <b>it</b> {{would be a}} mere waste of {{time for me to}} take service with the state, when I am determined upon the vocation of a merchant." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Reckon I'm {{seeing things}} too," [...] agreed Pan in {{suppressed}} excitement. [...] "I <b>said</b> once <b>before</b> <b>it's</b> {{too good to}} be true. Dad wasn't loco. No wonder he raved.... Blink, is there any mistake?" ...|$|R
