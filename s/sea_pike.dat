On October 18, 1944, it entered Palau with another cargo ship, the SS <b>Sea</b> <b>Pike,</b> escorted by a Marshall Islands-based destroyer, USS Brackett, for protection. On November 29, 1944, the SS Navajo Victory and the SS <b>Sea</b> <b>Pike</b> delivered troops and supplies from Ewa Villages, Hawaii, to Marine Fighter Attack Squadron 323. Navajo Victory also delivered supplies for the liberation of The Philippines, and for the USS Floyd County, an American tank landing ship. On December 29, 1944, it supplied fleet ships at Seeadler Harbor, Manus Island. On January 16, 1945, it unloaded troop rations at New Guinea for the troops stationed there. It prepared for Operation Downfall, the invasion of Japan, from June 26 to August 15, 1945, with exercises at Leyte. The training exercises were halted after the surrender of Japan on August 15.|$|E

60|$|So we {{have had}} another burial at <b>sea.</b> Mr. <b>Pike</b> was vexed by it because the Elsinore, {{according}} to sea tradition, was going too fast through the water for a proper ceremony.

40|$|In this work, {{the aim was}} {{to produce}} a {{realistic}} assessment of yearly mortality of Archipelago <b>Sea</b> <b>pike</b> perch during the period 1997 - 2012. The utilized data origins from the mark-recapture experiment carried out by the Finnish Game and Fisheries Research Institute (FGFRI). In this mark-recapture experiment, returnings of the marks were based on voluntary tag reporting by the fishermen gaining small monetary rewards. In this study design, the count of returned tags is affected {{by the size of the}} release cohort, efficiency of the fishing method used by a fisherman and the fisherman’s willingness to return the tag. In addition, each year a proportion of the tags become detached from fish, which means that those tags cannot be returned. All these factors were taken into account in a hierarchical model, which was developed in the same fashion as the well-known Cormack-Jolly-Seber model. Data from the yearly total catch were not used in this work because those data will be used in the subsequent research utilizing results of this work. The objective of this work was to estimate fishing gear specific catchability coefficients and mortality rates, including natural mortality rate. The amount of data and number of parameters to be estimated set their own limitations, so it was decided to estimate parameters of interest by splitting the data into only three fishing fleets: professional fishermen, recreational net fishermen and recreational line fishermen. The estimability of the hierarchical model developed for mark-recapture data was studied using simulation experiments. One was able to find such a model configuration, where the parameters concerning mortality estimates may be es- timated without significant systematic errors in the estimated posterior distri- butions. Simultaneously, the tag reporting probabilities were estimated for each of the three fishing fleets although systematic errors remained for these param- eters. The final mortality estimate indicates that about half of the Archipelago <b>Sea</b> <b>pike</b> perch population is removed annually. For the recent years about half of this mortality was caused by professional fishing, and almost the same amount was due to natural death. The mortality caused by recreational fishing is the smallest mortality component. The estimate concerns population similar to released cohorts. The produced estimate is sensitive to many factors, whereas effects of environmental change, or changes in seal or cormorant abundances, were beyond the scope of this work...|$|E
40|$|Spawning {{habitat of}} pike (Esox lucius) in the Baltic Sea include {{brackish}} water bays, brooks and rivers. Elevated salinity concentrations {{are one of}} several stressors that might increase the use and importance of freshwater habitats for spawning. In the Baltic Sea, {{one of the largest}} brackish seas in the world, freshwater species like pike, perch (Perca fluviatilis), whitefish (Coregonus sp), bream (Abramis brama), ide (Leuciscus idus), roach (Rutilus rutilus) and burbot (Lola iota) all undertake spawning migrations to freshwater. However, over the last decades populations densities of these species have declined, and recruitment failure has been argued to be {{at least part of the}} problem. The importance of brooks and rivers as spawning areas for these species have not been quantified and set in relation to spawning success in brackish bays. In this study, we collected 175 adult pike (Esox lucius) on their foraging grounds in the sea. Fish were collected in two regions on the Baltic coast, more than 600 km apart. Subsequently we determined their origin (freshwater or marine) using otolith chemistry. Sagittal otoliths were analysed for strontium using the PIXE-method. The results show that 80 of the 175 pike were recruited in freshwater, and several of the larger specimens showed reoccurring migration behaviour. Data show that freshwater is an important recruitment habitat for Baltic <b>Sea</b> <b>pike,</b> suggesting that habitat improvements in rivers entering the Baltic Sea might significantly contribute to population restoration...|$|E
50|$|As {{described}} in a film magazine, during a cruise of the Elsinore, Captain Nathaniel Somers (MacGregor) is assassinated and John Pike (Lewis) takes control of the schooner to provide an income for the skipper's son Dick (Casson Ferguson). The latter dislikes the <b>sea,</b> but <b>Pike</b> insists that he make the voyage to keep his obligations to Margaret West (Helen Ferguson), daughter of a former half-owner of the ship. Members of the crew are cut-throats, and mutiny at the earliest opportunity, giving Pike the fight for his life.|$|R

2500|$|A tube fly is {{a general}} tying style of {{artificial}} fly. Tube flies differ from traditional artificial flies as they are tied on small diameter tubes, not hooks. [...] Tube flies were originated in Aberdeen, Scotland by fly-dresser Minnie Morawski for Atlantic salmon anglers around 1945. Tube flies were designed to improve hooking success and to prevent damage to complex and expensive salmon flies by the teeth of hooked salmon. [...] Tube flies have been widely adapted to fly patterns {{for a variety of}} cold water and warm water species and are extremely popular for steelhead and salmon in the Pacific Northwest and northeast United States, as well as saltwater species along the Atlantic, Florida and Gulf Coasts. [...] They are widely used in European waters for Atlantic salmon, <b>sea</b> trout and <b>pike.</b>|$|R
40|$|During {{the periods}} from the 27 th of September in 1984 to August {{in the same}} year, and on the 23 rd of July in 1985, diving {{observations}} were carried out on the artificial concrete block reefs submerged at the off sea of Kaimon Town situated {{at the southern end}} of Kagoshima Prefecture, with the following informations obtained. (1) Concerning the reef-group submerged at the sea-front lying East of Kaimon mountain, it was ascertained that the depth at which the group was set-in showing 35 ~ 60 m, the shape being two-headed-hill type. The setting-in was made quite well, making full use of the topography of the sea-bottom, which gave good fish gathering effect on to the group; and the reef-group gathered a lot of useful fish, such as <b>Sea</b> <b>pike</b> Sphyraena schlegeli Saurel Trachurus japonicus Striped sea perch Lutjanus vitta and Thick lip bream Plectorhynchus pictus. And the reef-group was noted to be playing a part as a sort of fish-leading reef added to the fishing ground of the Set Net. (2) On the other hand, in case of the reef-group submerged at the sea-front lying West of the Kaimon mountain, the reefs were set in a scattering condition, separated by a wide distance between the individual reefs. Adding to this, the reefs near the seashore were to be influenced by the waves, and were apt to be buried with sand and mud; as a matter of fact not a small number of them were wholly buried. To prevent them from being buried some of the reefs were set-in over the sea bottom covered with the preliminarily submerged small stones. However, the widely scattered reefs were incapable of getting a good fish-gathering effect. 昭和 59 年 9 月 27 日より 10 月 1 日にかけ,また昭和 60 年 7 月 23 日,鹿児島県薩摩半島南端の開聞町沖合海域に設置されている 6 個所の人工魚礁について潜水観察を実施し,下記のような知見を得た。(1) 開聞岳の東方海域の魚礁群は,設置水深が 35 ~ 60 mと深く,また形態は 2 山型をなしている。海底地形を巧みに利用しているため,カマス,マアジ,ヨコスジフエダイ,コロダイ等の有用魚を多く集めており,定置漁場の誘導魚礁的役割を果たしている。(2) 開聞岳の西方海域の魚礁群は,個体間隔の広い分散型に設置されている。沿岸に近い魚礁は,波浪の影響を強く受けるので,埋没し易く,魚礁の中にはほとんど埋没したものも多く認められた。埋没を防止するため,海底に敷きつめた丸石群の上にコンクリートブロックを設置した魚礁もあるが,広範囲に分散しているためか蝟集魚は貧相であった...|$|E
50|$|The 7 Valleys (Les 7 Vallées) in Pas-de-Calais {{is a land}} {{of rivers}} and streams, valleys, forests. The best known of the Seven Valleys, is the Valley of the Canche. The river Canche has its {{headwaters}} near Magnicourt sur Canche. The Ternoise and Course flow into it along its 96 kilometre winding journey to its vast estuary in the Channel just north of Le Touquet at Etaples sur Mer and many restaurants and auberges {{are to be found}} along the way, especially between Montreuil and Etaples. The river is populated with rainbow trout, <b>sea</b> trout, eel, <b>pike</b> and roach and although you can walk along both banks, the right hand side is more picturesque. The river follows the lie of the land flowing past chalk hillsides and its path is frequently indicated by the presence of willows. The farms, set low down, are often built of whitewashed cob.|$|R
50|$|Many larger animals, such as wolf, {{bear and}} the European elk are today extinct. However, some {{species such as}} red deer are protected. Other small mammals, such as rabbits, foxes, badgers, hares, hedgehogs, and stoats, are very common and the European beaver has been reintroduced in parts of Scotland. Wild boar have also been reintroduced to parts of {{southern}} England, following escapes from boar farms and illegal releases. Many rivers contain otters and seals are common on coasts. Over 200 species of bird reside permanently and another 200 migrate. Common types are the common chaffinch, common blackbird, house sparrow and common starling; all small birds. Large birds are declining in number, except for those kept for game such as pheasant, partridge, and red grouse. Fish are abundant in the rivers and lakes, in particular salmon, trout, perch and <b>pike.</b> <b>Sea</b> fish include dogfish, cod, sole, pollock and bass, as well as mussels, crab and oysters along the coast. There are more than 21,000 species of insects.|$|R
5000|$|Here also {{remains the}} ruins of a very stately castle, built on the top of an eminent hill {{in the midst of the}} town, over-topping all the rest of the city, and to this castle, {{surrounded}} with deep dikes, there is an entrance by one bridge having only one great and entire arch under it, of such a vast breadth and height that it surpasses any of the bridges in Yorkshire, over the river Wharfe or elsewhere. A little way from this castle on the opposite side of a hill, is the chief market place of this city, and this being the only place where all things are brought to be sold, for the food of this great city, they not as in London allowing markets in several places, make it vastly full of provisions, especially on Saturdays, where I saw the greatest shambles for butchers' meat I had ever yet seen, and the like also for poultry and dairy-meats, which dairy people also bring many quarters of veal with their butter and cheese, and I believe also in their seasons pork and hog-meats. These people fill a square of ground on the side of a hill twice as big as Abingdon market place. They setting their goods in ranges as near as may be one above another, only allowing room for single persons to pass between; and above these the butchers have their shambles and such kind of people as sell fish, of which there was plenty of such kinds as the seas hereabouts afford, viz. crabs, flounders, mackerel, very cheap, but lobster for <b>sea</b> fish and <b>pike</b> or jack for river fish, were dear enough. ... Their chief market house stands in the midst of this great market place, now very full of people and provisions, being circular or round in form, having chained to the several pillars thereof bushels, pecks, scales, and other things for the measuring and weighing of such goods as are brought to the market. Thomas Baskerville, 1681 With few fixed structures in the main marketplace, the plain traditionally served as a public open space on days when the market was not operational. Before the Reformation in the 1530s, its main use was as a venue for religious festivals, particularly the annual procession of the Craft Guilds at Corpus Christi. Most public religious festivals were abandoned following the Reformation and the subsequent dissolution of many of the mediaeval guilds, and the leading event on Norwich's civic calendar became the annual inauguration of the mayor, which took place each May.|$|R
