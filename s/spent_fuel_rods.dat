40|$|Gas {{transport}} {{along the}} axis of irradiated <b>fuel</b> <b>rods</b> is an important process which determines homogeneous pressurization inside the rod. In case of failed rods, gas and/or liquid phase (water) axial transport is relevant for accident conditions (e. g. the effects of depressurization on fuel integrity and radionuclide release), and for <b>spent</b> <b>fuel</b> drying. The effects of increasing burnup on the mode of axial transport of gas are of particular interest. The closure of the pellet-cladding gap, which occurs at burnup around 45 GWd/tHM, removes a fast pathway for axial transport. This implies that gas or other mobile species will have to travel through cracks and other discontinuities in the fuel. This paper {{presents the results of}} axial gas transport measurements in a <b>spent</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>rod.</b> The permeability of nitrogen along {{the axis of}} a PWR ~ 52 GWd/tHM UO 2 rod was investigated by applying a gas pressure difference and measuring the equilibration time across the fuel stack. The tests were performed in hot cell at ambient temperature (approximately 300 K). The pressure difference applied varied between 0. 1 MPa and 1 MPa (1 and 10 bar) and the corresponding equilibration times varied between 930 s and 280 s, respectively. The derived permeability coefficient is of the order of 3 • 10 - 13 m 2. These results confirm that axial transport of fluid occurs readily in <b>spent</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>rod</b> also when the pellet-cladding gap is closed. Further work is ongoing to investigate these properties in the context of <b>spent</b> <b>fuel</b> drying, storage and disposal, and to assess possible implications for in-pile behaviour under off-normal conditions.

25|$|Nuclear {{reactors}} {{generate electricity}} {{by using the}} heat of the fission reaction to produce steam, which is used to drive turbines in order to generate electricity. When the reactor stops operating, the radioactive decay of unstable isotopes in the fuel continues to generate heat (decay heat) for a time, and so require continued cooling. Initially this decay heat amounts to approximately 6.5% of the amount produced by fission, decreasing over several days before reaching shutdown levels. Afterwards, <b>spent</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>rods</b> typically require several years in a spent fuel pool before they can be safely transferred to dry cask storage vessels. The decay heat in the Unit 4 spent fuel pool had the capacity to boil about 70 metric tons of water per day.|$|E
25|$|The Energy Policy Act of 1992 had a {{provision}} under Section 801, which directed the EPA to promulgate radiation protection {{standards for the}} Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository in Nevada.

The costs for this project have reached $13.5billion for this expected 25-year program. However, in 2009, President Barack Obama fulfilled his campaign promise to end the shipping of nuclear waste to the site. Soon after this, the U.S. Senate and the House of Representatives passed legislation to back Obama's decision, although the site is still active and being funded by the government ($196.8million in the federal budget).

This in turn pushed Brazil to accelerate talks with West Germany and France, eventually signing an agreement with the former on 27 June 1975, that established the transfer of operational know-how regarding reactors. The deal represented the largest technology transfer agreement ever signed between an industrialized country and an industrializing one. Bonn committed to export four to eight reactors over a span of 15 years. Likewise, West German firms agreed to construct a complete nuclear fuel cycle in Brazil: uranium prospecting and mining; uranium enrichment (using the jet-nozzle process); manufacturing fuel rods; and reprocessing <b>spent</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>rods.</b> For West Germany’s nuclear industry, this was the most significant contract ever to be established, at an anticipated value of 10 billion marks (roughly US$4 billion).

40|$|The {{capability}} of the <b>spent</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>rod</b> to contain radionuclides during the cooling, storage and handling / transportation stages determines {{to a large extent}} the safety of nuclear fuel after discharge from the reactor. In addition to the property evolution of intact <b>fuel</b> <b>rods,</b> the behaviour of defective rods and the consequences of potential accidents causing rod failure must be considered. This paper presents the most recent results of ongoing <b>spent</b> <b>fuel</b> characterization studies focused on long-term storage and transportation performed at JRC-ITU. Irradiated fuel alterations as a function of time under the cumulative effect of alpha-decay damage and radiogenic He accumulation are investigated at the microstructural level and at the level of macroscopic properties (e. g. hardness). Properties measured on LWR fuel (UO 2, MOX) are complemented by tests on alpha-doped UO 2 which simulates ageing processes under accelerated conditions. Hardness results obtained on a 67 GWd/t fuel are compared to previous data on similar fuel and to UO 2 containing different fractions of short –lived alpha-emitters. The generic trend observed for all the measured property changes indicates that a saturation level is reached after an initial alteration stage. At very high dose, transmission electron microscopy analysis provides evidence for grain polygonization and microstructure reorganization. In addition to intact <b>fuel</b> <b>rods,</b> data on the behaviour of defective rods and the consequences of potential accidents are presented. These tests are part of a program of studies aimed at characterizing safety relevant aspects potentially affecting LWR <b>fuel</b> <b>rods</b> with different burnup, and simulating different scenarios (ages and thermal histories).

40|$|Vibration {{integrity}} of high burn-up <b>spent</b> nuclear <b>fuel</b> in transportation {{remains to be}} {{a critical component of}} US nuclear waste management system. The structural evaluation of package for <b>spent</b> <b>fuel</b> transportation eventually will need to see if the content or <b>spent</b> <b>fuel</b> is in a subcritical condition. However, a system for testing and characterizing such <b>spent</b> <b>fuel</b> is still lacking mainly due to the complication involved with dealing radioactive specimens in a hot cell environment. Apparently, the current state-of-the-art in <b>spent</b> <b>fuel</b> research and development is quite far away from the delivery of reliable mechanical property data for the assessment of <b>spent</b> <b>fuels</b> in the transport package evaluation. Under the sponsorship of US NRC, ORNL has taken the challenge in developing a robust testing system for <b>spent</b> <b>fuel</b> in hot cell. An extensive literature survey was carried out and unique requirements of such testing system were identified. The U-frame setup has come to the top among various designs examined for reverse bending fatigue test of <b>spent</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>rod.</b> The U-frame has many features that deserve mentioned here: Easy to install <b>spent</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>rod</b> in test; Less linkages than in conventional bending test setup such as three-point or four-point bending; Target the failure mode relevant to the fracture of <b>spent</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>rod</b> in transportation by focusing on pure bending; The continuous calibrations and modifications resulted in the third generation (3 G) U-frame testing setup. Rigid arms are split along the LBB axis at rod sample ends. For each arm, this results in a large arm body and an end piece. Mating halves of bushings were modified into two V-shaped surfaces on which linear roller bearings (LRB) are embedded. The rod specimen is installed into the test fixture through opening and closing slide end-pieces. The 3 G apparently has addressed major issues of setup identified in the previous stage and been proven to be eligible to be further pursued in this project. On the other hand, the purchase of universal testing machine or Bose dual LM 2 TB was completed and the testing system was delivered to ORNL in August 2012. The preliminary confirmation of the system and on-site training were given by Bose field engineer and regional manager on 8 / 1 - 8 / 2 / 2012. The calibration of Bose testing system has been performed by ORNL because the integration of ORNL setup into the Bose TestBench occurred after the installation. Major challenge with this process arose from two aspects: 1) the load control involves two load cells, and 2) U-frame setup itself is a non-standard specimen. ORNL has been able to implement the load control through Cycle Indirect along with pinning the U-frame setup. Two meetings with ORNL hot-cell group (November 2012 and January 2013) were held to discuss the potential issues with both epoxy mounting of rigid sleeve and U-frame setup. Many suggestions were provided to make the procedure friendlier to the manipulator in hot cell. Addressing of these suggestions resulted in another cycle of modifications of both vise mold and setup. The initial meeting with ORNL I&C group occurred in November 2012 with regard to the Bose cable modification and design of central panel to integrate the cables and wires. The first round of cable modification and central panel fabrication was completed in February 2012. The testing with the modified cables exhibited substantial noises and the testing system was not shown to be stable. It was believed the cross talk was responsible to the noise, and a central panel with a better grounding and shielding was highly recommended. The central panel has been re-designed and fabricated in March 2013. In the subsequent period, the ORNL made substantial effort to debug the noises with the load cell channel, and to resolve the noises and nonlinearity with RDP LVDTs related to the integration of RDP LVDTs to Bose system. At the same time, ORNL has completed the verification tests of Bose test system, including cycle tests under reversal bending in load control, bending tests under monotonic load, and cycle tests under reversal bending in load control on MTS machine to verify the results of Bose machine. These results are shown to be consistent under equivalent loading conditions, especially for the cycle tests. Rad hardened LVDTs will be incorporated into the Bose system once received, and 10 Hz tests will be completed in the next step. The schedule for the final check of the Bose system is being finalized before the system delivered to the hot cell...|$|R
