2500|$|Because of {{the high}} {{solubility}} of most PPCPs, aquatic organisms are especially vulnerable to their effects. [...] Researchers have found that a class of antidepressants {{may be found in}} frogs and can significantly slow their development. [...] The increased presence of estrogen and other synthetic hormones in waste water due to birth control and hormonal therapies has been linked to increased feminization of exposed fish and other aquatic organisms. The chemicals within these PPCP products could either affect the feminization or masculinization of different fishes, therefore affecting their reproductive rates. In addition to being found only in waterways, the ingredients of some PPCPs can also be found in the soil. Since some of these substances take a long time or cannot be degraded biologically, they make their way up the food chain. Information pertaining to the transport and fate of these hormones and their metabolites in dairy waste disposal is still being investigated, yet research suggest that the land application of <b>solid</b> <b>wastes</b> is likely linked with more hormone contamination problems.

The City of Johannesburg {{is facing}} the {{simultaneous}} challenges of an increased generation of <b>solid</b> <b>waste</b> in the City, unemployment and the running out of land to dispose the <b>waste.</b> Of the <b>solid</b> <b>waste</b> that is generated, 50 % is recyclable while only 10 % is recycled (SOER, 2003 : 69). <b>Solid</b> <b>waste</b> recycling is mainly performed through private sector initiatives in the City of Johannesburg. Consequently, there is no proper coordination with government initiatives. In order for South Africa to increase and sustain economic growth that would decrease unemployment, {{there should be a}} culture of entrepreneurship (Mass, G & Herrington M, 2006 : 7). <b>Solid</b> <b>waste</b> buy-back centres assist in addressing the challenges of dealing with the increased generation of <b>solid</b> <b>waste</b> and the scarcity of land for disposal. These centres also reduce the challenges of unemployment through promoting entrepreneurs to operate <b>solid</b> <b>waste</b> recycling businesses. Developed economies have managed to increase the rate of <b>solid</b> <b>waste</b> recycling to 60 %. The problems associated with <b>solid</b> <b>waste</b> have been reduced by promoting recycling through a combination of legislation and setting-up of agencies to deal with <b>solid</b> <b>waste</b> recycling. South Africa has legislation and stated programmes to deal with <b>solid</b> <b>waste</b> recycling. Nevertheless, there has been complexity with implementing recycling. This {{is the result of a}} lack of co-ordination between the role-players involved in the value chain of <b>solid</b> <b>waste</b> recycling. In order for the City of Johannesburg to increase the recycling of <b>solid</b> <b>waste</b> from 10 % to optimal rates of between 50 % and 60 %, there should be co-ordination of programmes amongst all the role players. In addition, there should also be skills provision to existing and potential entrepreneurs operating the <b>solid</b> <b>waste</b> buy-back centres. All spheres of government should promote <b>solid</b> <b>waste</b> recycling business to potential entrepreneurs and the public in order to recycle 40 % of the recyclable <b>solid</b> <b>waste</b> that is not being recycled. The establishment of a <b>solid</b> <b>waste</b> buy-back centre in the City of Johannesburg is economically viable with some buy-back centre realising a net-profit of least R 5 000 and some more than R 30 000 per month.
