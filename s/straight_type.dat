The bending characteristics were analyzed {{in order to identify}} the flexibility of the welded areas; subsequently, the seam breaking strength and water pressure resistance were analyzed to identify the bonding strength. In addition, two types of waterproof fabric, poly-urethane (PU) coated 2 layer and PU laminated 2 layer fabrics, were used for a performance analysis, accord-ing to fabric processing specifications. The circle type showed the highest flexibility in the terms of bending characteristics that influence wearability and were followed by the wave and the <b>straight</b> <b>type.</b> In terms of breaking strength, the <b>straight</b> <b>type</b> showed the highest breaking strength, followed by the wave and the circle type. The water pressure resistance analysis found that the wave type was superior to the <b>straight</b> <b>type</b> in terms of water pressure resistance. The wave type is deemed to be a design type suitable for maximizing per-formance, provided that the issue of stabilization in the welding production process is addressed. Looking at the bending characteristics of waterproof fabric for each specification, the laminating waterproof cloth out-performed the coated waterproof cloth in terms of flexibility. However, in terms of seam breaking strength, the coated waterproof cloth outperformed the laminated cloth. In contrast, the water pressure resistance of the laminated waterproof fabric was found to be higher than the coated waterproof fabric, leading {{to the conclusion that the}} bonding strength of the laminated waterproof fabric is higher than that of the coated waterproof fabric based on the assumption of injecting air...|$|E

40|$|It {{is known}} that optical-lattice (OL) {{potentials}} can stabilize solitons and solitary vortices against the critical collapse, generated by the cubic attractive nonlinearity in the 2 D geometry. We demonstrate OLs can also stabilize various species of fundamental and vortical solitons against the super-critical collapse, driven by the double-attractive cubic-quintic nonlinearity (however, solitons remain unstable {{in the case of}} the pure quintic nonlinearity). Two types of OLs are considered, producing similar results: the 2 D Kronig-Penney "checkerboard", and the sinusoidal potential. Soliton families are obtained by means of a variational approximation, and as numerical solutions. The stability of the families, which include fundamental and multi-humped solitons, vortices of oblique and <b>straight</b> <b>types,</b> vortices built of quadrupoles, and supervortices, strictly obeys the Vakhitov-Kolokolov criterion.

40|$|After {{only one}} year of operation, thermowells in feed gas supply {{pipeline}} at a natural gas production plant was failed due to fatigue damage accelerated by improper thermowell design for the current operation. It is believed that thermowell configuration having a neck acted as local stress raiser played a remarkable role in initiation of fatigue damage. Besides, the medium flow past a thermowell causes vortices to be shed at a frequency, termed the wake frequency, proportional to the flow velocity. If the wake frequency is {{at or near the}} natural frequency of thermowell, a resonance condition may occur where massive amounts of energy are absorbed by the thermowell, resulting in very high stresses and possible failure. The problem was solved by using modified thermowell configuration to minimize both stress concentration and resonance.

Gonococci from T 4 colonies attached only by direct contact. Treatment with typsin (1 mg/ml) damaged or removed pili from gonococci. After incubation with trypsin, attachment of pilated gonococci to sperm was decreased significantly, but such treatment did not affect attachment of non-pilated gonococci. Incubation of gonococci from either colony type in 0. 1 mmol/l ferric nitrate, followed by incubation with sperm, significantly increased attachment of only T 4 bacteria. No pili were seen on T 4 gonococci treated with ferric nitrate; thus, it appears that factors other than pili alone are concerned in attachment of these gonococci to sperm...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In this work, we {{show how}} to {{manipulate}} the electromag-netic wave at will by using an indefinite medium with extremely strong anisotropy. The negative element in the indefinite permittivity tensor goes to the negative infinity while the positive element is equal to 1, which stretches the hyperbolic equifrequency contour into a <b>straight</b> line <b>type.</b> The direction of the Poynting vector and the wave vector is aligned by the <b>straight</b> line <b>type</b> equifrequency contour along {{the orientation of the}} extremely negative permittivity, thus control the wave propagation. The other permittivity of 1 makes the indefinite medium matched with the air. Moreover, because of the hyperbolic equifrequency contour, evanescent wave can also transmit in the indef-inite medium under the propagation mode, implying the possibility of controlling an evanescent wave by this special indefinite medium. Sim-ulations are performed to demonstrate the controlling performance and a potential design to realize such a medium by metamaterial with mul-tilayered metal/dielectric structure.

40|$|Background and Objectives：The goal of {{this study}} was to examine {{insertion}} depth, intracochlear position and insertion trau-ma with the stimulation electrode of the Nurobiosys cochlear implant. Subjects and Method：Four electrodes were implanted in fresh temporal bones of the human cadavers using realistic surgical procedures. Plain film X-ray images were taken from the electrode inserted in the specimens to estimate the insertion depth. After the electrode implantation, all human temporal bones were trimmed to extract the cochleae. The extracted cochleae from the temporal bone were immersed in acrylic resin to fix the position of electrode placed in the scala tympani. The resin treated cochleae were cut in radial section and polished. All cross-sections were imaged with a microscope to assess the trauma by the electrode implantation. Results：The mean insertion depth was about 300 °with the cochlea angle. The insertion trauma was observed in one section of a temporal bone. The mean distance from electrode to modiolus was about 0. 75 millimeter. Conclusion：The incidence, severity of trauma and insertion depth of the studied electrode showed similar results with that of other <b>straight</b> <b>type</b> electrode in literature.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{frequent}} anatomical {{variations of}} the inferior alveolar nerve (IAN) course should be considered prior to any treatment in this area. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the course of the inferior alveolar canal (IAC) as it appears in the archived CBCT images of the mandible. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This cross- sectional study evaluated a sample of 156 CBCT examinations. The pattern of the IAC was evaluated and the prevalence of different patterns according to age and gender were recorded. In order to find the frequency of mandibular canal type among different ages, the patients were put into the three age groups (20 - 29, 30 - 44 and 45 - 59). The data were analyzed using Chi-square test and the significance level was set as p≤. 05.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. A large-scale compressor/diffuser test rig has been designed and constructed which,. together with an automated data acquisition system, permits more detailed and more accurate measurements than were previously possible - especially {{in the region of}} the compressor OGV's. Results are presented based on experiments carried out using two different single-stage axial-flow compressors operating immediately upstream of a straight-core annular diffuser, each compressor being tested with a conventional stator row and a double-dihedral chevron type of stator row i. e. four main configurations were investigated. In addition to these main tests, the effects of operating the stator row at low Reynolds number, and of operating the stator row with a small hub clearance have been investigated. The chevron OGV shows a clear improvement, compared to the straight OGV, in t=s of diffuser performance and diffuser exit velocity profiles, at the expense of a general tendency for the OGV loss to increase. When hub clearance is used on a straight OGV, a hub corner stall arises, but this can be eliminated by incorporating blade dihedral at the hub. It seems likely that further improvements in diffuser exit conditions could be achieved by. careful design of the blade shape to encourage radial movement of flow. Traversing within the blade passage, for a <b>straight</b> <b>type</b> OGV, has revealed significant vortices rotating in the opposite sense to classical curved duct secondary flows...|$|E
