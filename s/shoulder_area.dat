Both forwards will have to go unclaimed on waivers for twenty four hours before they are officially assigned the Crunch. The Lightning also provided an update on injured backup goalie Andrei Vasilevskiy. Today Vasilevskiy did an on ice work out goalie coach Frantz Jean, facing shots from close range. He is still on blood thinners, which is restricting him from facing shots in the left <b>shoulder</b> <b>area.</b> He has an appointment on October 21, which will hopefully clear him for a return to full practice. Vasilevskiy stated that he thinks he will need a few games in Syracuse on a conditioning assignment before he is ready to return to the lineup.|$|E
25|$|A {{pacemaker}} {{is typically}} {{inserted into the}} patient through a simple surgery using either local anesthetic or a general anesthetic. The patient may be given a drug for relaxation before the surgery as well. An antibiotic is typically administered to prevent infection. In most cases the pacemaker is inserted in the left <b>shoulder</b> <b>area</b> where an incision is made below the collar bone creating a small pocket where the pacemaker is actually housed in the patient's body. The lead or leads (the number of leads varies {{depending on the type}} of pacemaker) are fed into the heart through a large vein using a fluoroscope to monitor the progress of lead insertion. The Right Ventricular lead would be positioned away from the apex (tip) of the right ventricle and up on the interventricular septum, below the outflow tract, to prevent deterioration of the strength of the heart. The actual surgery typically lasts 30 to 90 minutes.|$|E

2500|$|Apanuugpak (also {{known as}} Apanukpak or Apanurpaq), was Yup'ik legendary mythical great warrior figure or folk hero from the Kuskokwim and Nelson Island areas during the 18th century {{traditional}} {{bow and arrow}} warfare, which occurred for many decades, ending about 200 {{years ago in the}} Yup'ik region of Southwest Alaska. According to anthropologist Ann Fienup-Riordan, four separate continuing conflicts in the region were part of the wars. Significantly, the Yup'ik Eskimos categorize the Apanuugpak stories as historical narratives (qanemcit) rather than mythical tales (qulirat). Apanuugpak convinced villages that war was a futile and wasteful activity. Robert Redford, the actor, attempted to make a movie about Apanuugpak, [...] "The Winter Warrior." [...] The movie was never completed. Yup’ik parkas told the legend of this great warrior. The parkas had two white strips on the <b>shoulder</b> <b>area</b> that meant [...] "don’t tread on me, I’m a member of Apanuugpak’s tribe.

40|$|Introduction. Multiple {{symmetric}} lipomatosis, or Madelung's disease, {{is a rare}} condition {{which is}} characterized with large symmetrical accumulation of noncapsulated fat tissue in upper arms, neck, and <b>shoulder</b> <b>areas.</b> The disease etiology is unknown, with the highest incidence in the Mediterranean region. Case Presentation. Here, we present the case of Madelung's disease with symmetric fat distribution throughout the neck and history of alcoholism. The patient was treated from several diseases associated with alcoholism and hospitalized several times, but the diagnosis of Madelung's disease was omitted. The thyroid gland disease was excluded, while enlargement of the neck adipose tissue was attributed to obesity. Conclusions. This study points out possible diagnostic mistakes when a physician is not aware of a differentiation diagnosis of symmetrically enlarged neck masses, especially in geographic regions with high incidence of this disease...|$|R
40|$|For {{the purpose}} of this thesis work, four n-type CZ silicon ingots with {{different}} crown tapered angle and <b>shouldering</b> <b>area</b> were characterized {{in order to understand the}} oxygen behavior and related defects on ingot top cuts and its influence on material lifetime. A p-type CZ silicon ingot was also characterized in order to have a reference material for comparison. Differences in lifetime between the crowns were observed and a strong correlation between the crown tapered angle and oxygen concentration and distribution was established. The crown with the higher tapered angle has the highest lifetime. In contrast, the crown with the lower crown tapered angle has the lowest lifetime. The crystal body quality can be influenced by the top ingot quality in what concerns the interstitial oxygen concentration and distribution. Thus, analyzing the early body of each ingot, it might be possible to predict the crystal body quality. </p...|$|R
