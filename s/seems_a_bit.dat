25|$|White {{decided not}} to accept any more prizes for his work, and he {{declined}} both the $10,000 Britannia Award and another Miles Franklin Award. White was approached by Harry M. Miller {{to work on a}} screenplay for Voss but nothing came of it. He became an active opponent of literary censorship and joined a number of other public figures in signing a statement of defiance against Australiaâ€™s decision to participate in the Vietnam War. His name had sometimes been mentioned as a contender for the Nobel Prize in Literature, but in 1971, after losing to Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, he wrote to a friend: That Nobel Prize! I hope I never hear it mentioned again. I certainly don't want it; the machinery behind it <b>seems</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> dirty, when we thought that only applied to Australian awards. In my case to win the prize would upset my life far too much, and it would embarrass me to be held up to the world as an Australian writer when, apart from the accident of blood, I feel I am temperamentally a cosmopolitan Londoner.|$|E
25|$|The term Stikine Volcanic Belt was {{originally}} defined by Jack Souther and Christopher Yorath of the Geological Survey of Canada in 1991 {{as a group}} of volcanic deposits centered around the Stikine River in northwestern British Columbia. As more mapping and dating of volcanic deposits was completed in the Western Cordillera, the Stikine Volcanic Belt was expanded to include volcanic deposits further and further from the geographic area associated with the name Stikine. In part for this reason, scientists Ben Edwards and James Russell redefined this area of volcanism as the Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province. As a geographic descriptor, application of the name Stikine to volcanic rocks exposed along the Yukon River <b>seems</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> odd and confusing. As well, a much older group of totally unrelated volcanic rocks comprise the Stikine Assemblage, which also mainly occurs within the geographic area informally referred to as Stikine Country. The Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province is a broader name, to encompass a broader geographic area, in which the most recent volcanism has a similar character (mainly alkaline, mafic volcanic rocks), a similar age range (Miocene to Holocene), and a similar tectonic setting (transtension).|$|E
25|$|When {{informed}} {{of the division of}} the Roman army, Hannibal reconsidered his strategic position and studied the possibility of destroying part of the Roman army in a pitched battle. The Roman armies were camped separately, so one army could be drawn out and engaged under favorable conditions before the other could intervene. It was a foregone conclusion that Minucius was more likely to swallow whatever bait laid out by Hannibal, as Fabius had shown himself to be immune to all forms of Punic provocations throughout the summer of 217 BC. So, it became a question of getting Minucius to fight before Fabius did anything, not fighting Fabius before Minucius hightailed to the rescue. Hannibal's next challenge was to formulate a plan to entrap and destroy the Roman army commanded by Minucius. After a careful study of the terrain, Hannibal devised a tactical plan which would take advantage of the aggressiveness of Minucius and the geographical features of the chosen battle site. The plan was to entice Minucius with a careful and timed maneuver into thinking that he was fighting a repeat of the skirmish he had earlier fought at Geronium, while springing a trap similar to the one Hannibal had sprung on the Romans at the Battle of Trebbia in 218 BC on the unsuspecting army of Minucius. It had been suggested that Hannibal had deliberately lost the skirmish on purpose to obtain this very opportunity, but that speculation <b>seems</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> far-fetched.|$|E

500|$|It was {{alleged that}} Celador, the {{production}} company {{in charge of}} Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?, had rigged the show to spoil the BBC's expected high ratings for the sitcom's finale. Wilson in particular {{was quoted as saying}} that ITV had [...] "planned" [...] the win, adding [...] "it <b>seems</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> unfair to take the audience away from Victor's last moments on earth." [...] Richard Webber's account, in his 2006 book, cites [...] "unnamed BBC sources" [...] as those who [...] "questioned the authenticity of Keppel's victory". ITV claimed that the allegation [...] "undermined viewers' faith in the programme", and Leslie Hill, ITV's chairman, wrote a letter of complaint to Sir Christopher Bland, the chairman of the BBC Board of Governors. The corporation apologised, saying that any suggestion of rigging [...] "did not represent the official view of the BBC."

[...] Renshaw was critical about the fact that [...] "Paramore are for the kids who think Pink is not cool enough but My Chemical Romance are too scary, they want to rebel but they have to be in by 9 o' clock. Paramore are not terrible; they are simply a transitional band." [...] Jordan [...] "Anchors" [...] Rogowski from Punknews.org was more critical of the album; he praised William's voice, but criticized the structures of the songs, regarding them [...] "just too flat, too linear [...] the guitar <b>seems</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> uninspired, the drumming a bit lazy, and the bass is barely existent, if existent at all." ...|$|E

500|$|Several writers {{felt that}} the novel left much to be desired {{following}} Fitzgerald's previous works and promptly criticized him. Harvey Eagleton of The Dallas Morning News believed the novel signaled the end of Fitzgerald's success: [...] "One finishes Great Gatsby {{with a feeling of}} regret, not for the fate {{of the people in the}} book, but for Mr. Fitzgerald." [...] John McClure of The Times-Picayune said that the book was unconvincing, writing, [...] "Even in conception and construction, The Great Gatsby seems a little raw." [...] Ralph Coghlan of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch felt the book lacked what made Fitzgerald's earlier novels endearing and called the book [...] "a minor performance... At the moment, its author <b>seems</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> bored and tired and cynical." [...] Ruth Snyder of New York Evening World called the book's style [...] "painfully forced", noting that the editors of the paper were [...] "quite convinced after reading The Great Gatsby that Mr. Fitzgerald is not one of the great American writers of to-day." [...] The reviews struck Fitzgerald as completely missing the point: [...] "All the reviews, even the most enthusiastic, not one had the slightest idea what the book was about." ...|$|E
500|$|Robert Avila of the San Francisco Bay Guardian called The Group: [...] "in-your-face {{comedy in}} a droll send-up of EST-like {{self-actualization}} programs," [...] and a spoof of [...] "recent incarnations" [...] including The Secret and Landmark Forum. Avila gave the play a positive review, noting its [...] "inspired writing, sharp humor, and simple yet slick production". In {{a review of}} the play for the San Jose Mercury News, Karen D'Souza wrote: [...] From est to 'The Secret,' this is a playful lampoon of 'healing philosophies'". D'Souza also reviewed the play positively, writing: [...] " [...] Writer-director Robert Quillen Camp slyly pokes fun at reducing the human experience to one-size-fits-all platitudes and besmirching belief systems with [...] "cash-only" [...] workshops." [...] Pat Craig wrote in Contra Costa Times: [...] "After a lifetime of enduring various human potential programs, from the chanted mantras of transcendental meditation to the institutionalized loathing of est, 'The Group' <b>seems</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> tame for satire to a veteran of the high-profit mind games." [...] In a review for the San Francisco Examiner, Leslie Katz said, [...] "In the end, the show provides excellent therapy. As those who aren't swayed by expensive self-help seminars know, laughter is indeed the best medicine." ...|$|E
500|$|Since airing, {{the episode}} has {{received}} many positive reviews from fans and television critics. One-time The Simpsons writer and comedian Ricky Gervais named it his second favorite episode, and said: [...] "Mr. Burns gives [...] this terrible plaque above his desk that says, 'Don't forget: You're here forever.' It's about how sometimes things don't {{go the way}} you planned, which is pretty amazing in a cartoon. Homer then puts up all the pictures of Maggie he's ever taken to strategically cover this horrible thing so it now reads, 'Do it for her.' It gives me a lump in the throat thinking about it." [...] Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, {{the authors of the}} book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, said: [...] "A surprisingly traditional episode. The flashback to 1993 <b>seems</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> odd, but this {{is a good example of}} a story that doesn't overly rely on set pieces and confounded expectations for its success." [...] In a review of the sixth season, Joshua Klein of the Chicago Tribune cited [...] "And Maggie Makes Three", [...] "Treehouse of Horror V", [...] "Homer Badman", and [...] "Lisa's Rival" [...] among his favorite episodes of the season.|$|E

500|$|Producers Lindelof and Cuse were {{initially}} {{worried about how}} the freighter folk characters would be received by fans, after the unhappy reaction to new characters Nikki (Kiele Sanchez) and Paulo (Rodrigo Santoro), introduced in season three. However, following their introduction in [...] "Confirmed Dead", the four characters were well received, with Paige Albiniak of the New York Post citing them as a reason behind the show's improved ratings. Erin Martell of AOL's TV Squad wrote that within one episode Fahey had already won her over, and called Frank her favorite new Lost character. IGN's Chris Carabott described Frank, {{as well as the}} other new characters from the freighter, as [...] "great" [...] and [...] "exciting", writing that: [...] "Fahey's Lapidus has exceptional screen presence that even overshadows the regular cast members to an extent." [...] TV Guides Bruce Fretts praised the casting of the freighter folk, noting that Fahey had been a personal favourite of his since his appearance in The Marshall. He deemed the group all stronger actors than former Lost stars Michelle Rodriguez, Rodrigo Santoro, Maggie Grace and Ian Somerhalder, and expressed hope that they would remain on the show longer. Jeff Jensen from Entertainment Weekly called the new characters [...] "fascinating" [...] and wrote that they [...] "totally worked for me, while their intriguing backstories left me jonesing for more." [...] Peter Mucha of The Philadelphia Inquirer deemed Frank's flashback [...] "mind-bending", and Oscar Dahl of BuddyTV called [...] "Confirmed Dead" [...] the [...] "perfect introduction" [...] to the new characters, writing that he could not wait to find out more about them. Michael Ausiello of TV Guide also enjoyed their introduction, and praised the actors' performances. Casey Gillis for The News & Advance highlighted the introduction of the freighter folk as one of the highlights of the season, opining that they [...] "fit seamlessly into the ensemble", while Digital Spy's Ben Rawson-Jones praised the season for introducing Frank, who he deemed [...] "a real cult figure." [...] In contrast, James Poniewozik of Time was critical of Lapidus. He wrote that he was amazed by the economy and precision with which the new characters were introduced because [...] "Each got just one flashback and a little time on the island, and yet by the end of the episode, I felt I had a true handle on what they were like as individuals." [...] He appended, however, that this was: [...] "with the possible exception of Frank, who <b>seems</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> too generic-drunk-hippie-guy for now." ...|$|E

2500|$|According to River Forest Thomism, {{also called}} Aristotelian-Thomism, the natural {{sciences}} are epistemologically prior to metaphysics, preferably called metascience.This approach emphasizes the Aristotelian foundations of Aquinas's philosophy, {{and in particular the}} idea that the construction of a sound metaphysics must be preceded by a sound understanding of natural science, as interpreted in light of an Aristotelian philosophy of nature. Accordingly, it is keen to show that modern physical science can and should be given such an interpretation. Charles De Koninck (1906â€“1965), Raymond Jude Nogar, OP (1915-1966), James A. Weisheipl, OP (1923â€“1984), , OP, and Benedict Ashley, OP, are among its representatives. It is sometimes called [...] "Laval Thomism" [...] after the University of Laval in Quebec , where De Koninck was a professor. The alternative label [...] "River Forest Thomism" [...] derives from a suburb of Chicago, the location of the Albertus Magnus Lyceum for Natural Science, whose members have been associated with this approach. It is also sometimes called [...] "Aristotelian Thomism" [...] (to highlight its contrast with Gilson's brand of existential Thomism) though since Neo-Scholastic Thomism also emphasizes Aquinas's continuity with Aristotle, this label <b>seems</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> too proprietary.

2500|$|The piece {{received}} mostly mixed {{or negative}} reviews, although {{the relationship between}} Jue's Sally and Harry Dickman's Chaim was praised by most reviewers. The Daily Telegraph thought that Himberg [...] "tries to include everything, and in the process, loses focus and tension. ... The raucous performances of musical numbers ... occupy an uncomfortable hinterland between deliberately amateurish and slightly painful. Richard Kentâ€™s designs are handsome. ... Jue gives a haunting performance as Sally ... but both play and direction are compromised by a cloying sentimentality." [...] The London Evening Standard, observed: [...] "Itâ€™s a curious confection: part surprising study of cultural contrasts, part affectionate portrait {{of the world of}} the drag queen, and part exploration of some knotty ideas about homeland and identity. ... production is both intimate and vigorous, with lashings of campness and a few genuinely moving moments. ... But along the way it <b>seems</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> clunky, as if straining too hard for sincerity and interest." [...] The Stage felt that, while the play has an [...] "episodic, plodding sincerity", [...] "it feels as though the inner lives have been drained from these characters".
