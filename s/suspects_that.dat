30|$|It is {{well know}} that bone pain {{could be due}} to bone {{metastasis}} of various kinds of malignant diseases. Especially, lung cancer, breast cancer and melanoma often bring out bone metastasis. However, she had no symptoms and no findings in CT and PET-CT with which we should <b>suspect</b> <b>that</b> she had lung cancer.

There was no specific findings in peripheral blood test with which we should <b>suspect</b> <b>that</b> she had some hematological disease, although we did not perform bone puncture. Furthermore, there was no specific findings in her skin in the whole body with which we should <b>suspect</b> <b>that</b> she had some disease such as melanoma.|$|R

5|$|Arthur Lennig {{asserted}} that MGM's official budget for Greed was suspiciously high {{for a film}} with no stars, no built sets, a small crew and inexpensive film stock.

Things become clearer in Monk's mind when he watches a news report on the assassination attempt. Monk regroups everyone at the place of the campaign rally to recreate what happened that day.|$|E
