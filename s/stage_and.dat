40|$|Background: Various {{systems of}} Computerized Tomographic (CT) <b>staging</b> <b>and</b> scoring {{have been applied}} to define the extent of sinus {{abnormality}} {{and the degree of}} mucosal thickening. Functional Endoscopic Sinus Surgery (FESS) has been used with considerable success rate to treat chronic sinonasal patients unresponsive to medical therapy. This study was designed to investigate the relationship between the result of CT scoring <b>and</b> <b>staging</b> <b>and</b> the outcome of surgery. Methods: The one year outcome of FESS together with preoperative CT <b>staging</b> <b>and</b> scoring were determined and compared with each other. Results: Compared to those with higher <b>stages</b> (III <b>and</b> IV), patients with lower preoperative CT <b>stages</b> (I <b>and</b> II) had a significantly higher successful outcome of surgery. CT <b>staging</b> <b>and</b> scoring were obviously correlated. Conclusions: The results of this study show that preoperative CT <b>staging</b> <b>and</b> scoring are two useful means for better prediction of the long–term outcome of surgery one year after FESS.

5|$|Amphibians have a {{juvenile}} <b>stage</b> <b>and</b> an adult <b>stage,</b> <b>and</b> the circulatory {{systems of the}} two are distinct. In the juvenile (or tadpole) stage, the circulation {{is similar to that}} of a fish; the two-chambered heart pumps the blood through the gills where it is oxygenated, and is spread around the body and back to the heart in a single loop. In the adult stage, amphibians (especially frogs) lose their gills and develop lungs. They have a heart that consists of a single ventricle and two atria. When the ventricle starts contracting, deoxygenated blood is pumped through the pulmonary artery to the lungs. Continued contraction then pumps oxygenated blood around the rest of the body. Mixing of the two bloodstreams is minimized by the anatomy of the chambers.|$|E
