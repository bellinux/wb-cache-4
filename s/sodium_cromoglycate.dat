50|$|Starting with khella, a {{traditional}} remedy for asthma, Altounyan discovered in 1965 that khella's active ingredient was khellin. He eventually produced a safer chemical based on khellin, <b>sodium</b> <b>cromoglycate.</b> This was later marketed as Intal by Fisons Pharmaceuticals, which {{was taken over}} by Rhone-Poulenc Rorer, who in turn were acquired into Aventis and sanofi-aventis. Prior to the RPR takeover, the R&D element of Fisons was sold to Astra, making it now part of AstraZeneca. <b>Sodium</b> <b>cromoglycate</b> was the first clinically utilised mast cell stabiliser. The mast cell {{plays a key role in}} allergic and asthmatic inflammation. Mast cells contain powerful inflammatory mediators which when released lead to inflammation and bronchoconstriction of the airway. <b>Sodium</b> <b>cromoglycate</b> stabilises the mast cell thereby preventing the release of the mediators.|$|E

40|$|C-fibres {{probably}} {{represent the}} common final pathway in both ACE inhibitors and neoplastic cough. A recent report demonstrated that inhaled <b>sodium</b> <b>cromoglycate</b> {{is an effective}} treatment for ACE inhibitors' cough; this effect {{might be due to}} the suppression of afferent unmyelinated C-fibres. We tested the hypothesis that inhaled <b>sodium</b> <b>cromoglycate</b> might also be effective in lung cancer patients who presented with irritative neoplastic cough.

40|$|Delivery of drug {{aerosols}} to {{the lungs}} of ventilated neonates by {{metered dose inhaler}} and spacer (Aerochamber) and ultrasonic nebuliser (Pentasonic) was assessed using <b>sodium</b> <b>cromoglycate.</b> The mean proportion of a known intratracheal dose of <b>sodium</b> <b>cromoglycate</b> excreted in the urine of four intubated infants was 37. 5 %. After assuming that 38 % of the <b>sodium</b> <b>cromoglycate</b> aerosol reaching the neonatal lung will be excreted in the urine, three puffs (15 mg) delivered by metered dose inhaler and spacer resulted in a pulmonary dose of 258 micrograms (1. 7 %, n = 7).

40|$|Background <b>Sodium</b> <b>cromoglycate</b> {{has been}} {{recommended}} as maintenance treatment for childhood asthma for many years. Its use has decreased since 1990, when inhaled corticosteroids became popular, {{but it is}} still used in many countries. Objectives To determine the efficacy of <b>sodium</b> <b>cromoglycate</b> compared to placebo in the prophylactic treatment of children with asthma. Search strategy We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Trials Register (October 2007), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 3, 2007), MEDLINE (January 1966 to November 2007), EMBASE (January 1985 to November 2007) and reference lists of articles. We also contacted the pharmaceutical company manufacturing <b>sodium</b> <b>cromoglycate.</b> In 2007 we updated the review. Selection criteria All double-blind, placebo-controlled randomised trials, which addressed the effectiveness of inhaled <b>sodium</b> <b>cromoglycate</b> as maintenance therapy, studying children aged 0 up to 18 years with asthma. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We pooled study results. Main results Of 3500 titles retrieved from the literature, 24 papers reporting on 23 studies could be included in the review. The studies were published between 1970 and 1997 and together included 1026 participants. Most were cross-over studies. Few studies provided sufficient information to judge the concealment of allocation. Four studies provided results for the percentage of symptom-free days. Pooling the results did not reveal a statistically significant difference between <b>sodium</b> <b>cromoglycate</b> and placebo. For the other pooled outcomes, most of the symptom-related outcomes and bronchodilator use showed statistically significant results, but treatment effects were small. Considering the confidence intervals of the outcome measures, a clinically relevant effect of <b>sodium</b> <b>cromoglycate</b> cannot be excluded. The funnel plot showed an under-representation of small studies with negative results, suggesting publication bias. Authors' conclusions There is insufficient evidence to be sure about the efficacy of <b>sodium</b> <b>cromoglycate</b> over placebo.

40|$|In a {{group of}} {{patients}} with mild asthma the inhalation of mist derived from ultrasonically nebulised distilled water caused an increase in cough and a fall in FEV 1. Double blind administration for five minutes of <b>sodium</b> <b>cromoglycate</b> (from an original solution containing 30 mg/ml) or atropine (2 mg/ml) by inhalation from a Minineb nebuliser, 30 minutes before the mist challenge, caused {{a significant reduction in}} the fall in FEV 1 (p less than 0. 05), but not in cough, by comparison with the protection afforded by placebo (saline). In a second study the fall in FEV 1 caused by the inhalation of distilled water was not significantly different from that seen in response to hypotonic sodium chloride (1. 7 g/l, 58 mmol/l), but both produced a significantly greater fall than did a similar mist containing <b>sodium</b> <b>cromoglycate</b> at an original concentration of 10 mg/ml (58 mmol/l).

40|$|BACKGROUND [...] Aerosols {{generated}} from metered dose inhalers may be highly charged. The {{aim of this}} study was to determine whether lining the walls of a polycarbonate spacer device with an antistatic agent would result in an increase in drug output. The effects of multiple actuations of drug into the spacer device and increasing residence time of drug within the spacer were also determined. METHODS [...] The amount of <b>sodium</b> <b>cromoglycate</b> contained in particles of various size available for inhalation (per 5 mg actuation) from a 750 ml polycarbonate spacer was determined by impinger measurement and spectrophotometric assay. RESULTS [...] Lining the spacer with an antistatic agent increased the mean (SD) amount of <b>sodium</b> <b>cromoglycate</b> in particles < 5 microns available for inhalation (per 5 mg actuation) by 244 % from (0. 59 (0. 03) to 1. 44 (0. 2) mg). When there was a 20 second interval between actuation into the spacer device and inhalation, <b>sodium</b> <b>cromoglycate</b> available for inhalation in particles < 5 micrograms decreased by 67 % (from 0. 59 (0. 03) mg to 0. 2 (0. 01) mg). Use of the spacer device increased <b>sodium</b> <b>cromoglycate</b> available for inhalation in respirable particles (< 5 microns) by 18 % compared with direct delivery by metered dose inhaler. Multiple actuations into the spacer decreased the amount of <b>sodium</b> <b>cromoglycate</b> available for inhalation in particles < 5 microns by 31 % after two actuations and 56 % after three acutations. CONCLUSIONS [...] Multiple actuations of <b>sodium</b> <b>cromoglycate</b> into a spacer device before inhalation should be avoided, and inhalation from spacer devices should take place immediately after actuation to ensure maximum dose.
