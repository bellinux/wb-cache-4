Direct-Write (DW) {{technology}} {{based on}} Near-Field Electrospinning (NFES) {{was introduced to}} fabricate suspended micro/nano-structure on pattern substrate, and the deposition behaviors of DWed structure under different collector motion speed (CMS) were discussed to improve control of DW technology based on NFES. Deposit point of DWed structure on the substrate can be controlled accurately under the observation of microscope, and position error of micro/nano-structure is less than 5 µm. When CMS {{is compatible with the}} electrospinning speed, straight line micro/nano-structure can be direct-written across micro-trenches with width of 5 ~ 40 µm or to bridge two micro-pillars with diameter of 10 µm. Due to the water evaporation and surface tension force, DWed structures suspended in the air would shrink smaller compared with that deposited on the top surface of pattern. The <b>shrink</b> <b>ratio</b> of micro-structure is higher than nano-structure and the <b>shrink</b> <b>ratio</b> decreases with the solution concentration increases. When the CMS is lower than electrospinning speed, the electrostatic force and elastic force would play a more prominent role on the deposition behavior of DWed structure. The electrical field strength on the top surface of pattern is higher than the space between two patterns, DWed thin film would deposit along the trip pattern and nanofiber would prefer to aggregate on the top surface of pattern under electrostatic force. When solution concentration is lower than 18 %, nanofiber aggregate on the pattern would coagulate to form polymer bundle...|$|E

MethodsBefore implantation into the animals, platelet adhesion to the UBE sheet was evaluated in vitro. In the canine model, the UBE sheet (group I; n = 6) was implanted for 3 months. The {{development of}} adhesions, epicardial reactions, the <b>shrink</b> <b>ratio</b> of the patch, and macrophage infiltration to the epicardium with histologic examination were evaluated.

We construct fits for the collision rates at specified velocities (effectively a collisional velocity probability distribution) for particle stopping time ratios up to four; already by that point the collisional partners are very poorly correlated and so the results should be robust for even larger stopping time ratios. Significantly, we find that while particles of very different masses have approximately Maxwellian collisional statistics, as the mass <b>ratio</b> <b>shrinks</b> the distribution changes dramatically. At small stopping time ratios, the collisional partners are highly correlated and we find a population of high number density (clustered), low relative-velocity particle pairs.

Together with our previous work for identical stopping time particle pairs, this provides a recipe for including collisional velocity probability distributions in dust coagulation models for protoplanetary disks.

[...] Department of Physics and Astronomy and Department of Chemistry. University of Missouri [...] Kansas City, 2015 As {{the size of}} a solid <b>shrinks,</b> the <b>ratio</b> of surface area to bulk volume grows and surface effects become more important. In a world where technologies advance with the shrinking size of electronic devices, one phase of matter has emerged which is fit for the near future of surface-dominated performance. Moreover, it has brought a new set of ideas to solid-state physics and chemistry, especially the understanding that the discipline of topology can be applied to classify the electron band structures. The topological insulator phase yields an exotic metal surface state in which the orientation of the electron’s spin is locked perpendicular to its momentum. This property suppresses backscattering (making it possible to pass spin-polarized currents through the material without loss), offers a crucial ingredient for innovative approaches to quantum computation, and provides the basis for observing unique magnetoelectric effects. However, the surface states of materials in the topological insulator phase can wildly differ, so it is of interest to systematically characterize new materials to understand how the structure in position-space is related to the spin-resolved structure of electrons in energy- and momentum-space. We will discuss this relationship as it is probed through spin- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy experiments on three topological (Bi₂) m(Bi₂Se₃) n superlattices: (a) Bi₂Se₃ (m = 0, n = 1), (b) Bi₄Se₃ (m = 1, n = 1), and (c) BiSe (m = 1, n = 2). Our studies have not only proven the topological nature of these materials, but also demonstrate how bulk band structure and polar chemical bonding control the surface metal’s concentration, dispersion, and spin-orbital character. Case (a) is considered to provide an ideal model of the topological surface metal. Case (b) provides the three important findings: (1) the chemical identity of the surface-termination controls the orbital composition and energy distribution of the surface states, (2) there are two topological states in sequential bulk band gaps, (3) of these, one of topological state undergoes a hybridization effect that yields a momentum-dependent gap in the band structure as large as 85 meV. Case (c) has a practical significance in that the surface metal has a potentially record-breaking carrier density of ~ 10 ¹³cm⁻² (estimated from the Fermi surface area), more than an order of magnitude higher than in Bi₂Se₃. This occurs as a result of charge transfer from the Bi₂ layers to the Bi₂Se₃ layers.

As a result, the importance of adsorption can increase, and proteins sticking to walls, biofilms grow on walls, and radicals annihilating on walls can become significant. Thus, under these circumstances, typical microfluidic systems are incompatible with the demands of accurate study of many biochemical systems. Over the past five years, acoustic levitation has become a technique uniquely suited to studying biochemical reactions. Acoustic levitation offers several advantages over typical reaction systems, including small sample volume (and mass), the prevention of chemical contamination between drops and external objects, rapid mixing within the drop as a result of circulation driven by the levitating ultrasound, and freedom from wall interactions. We have developed an Acoustically-Levitated Drop Reactor (LDR) to study enzyme-catalyzed reaction kinetics related to free-radical and oxidative stress chemistry. Microliter-scale droplet generation, reactant introduction, maintenance, and fluid removal are all important aspects in conducting reactions in a levitated drop. Therefore, we developed a three-capillary bundle system to address these needs. Since the capillary system is used to introduce drops to the levitation cavity, our LDR system is not 100 % wall-less, but the ratio of solid surface area to drops surface area is less than 20 %, which is low compared to all the other reaction systems. The largest interface seen by reactants is a liquid/gas interface. Herein, I report kinetic measurements for both luminol chemiluminescence and the reaction of pyruvate with nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, catalyzed by lactate dehydrogenase in a levitated drop. Observations of the chemiluminescence experiment showed second-order kinetics were detected within experimental error prior to deviations seen after 10 s. For the enzyme-catalyzed reaction kinetic measurements, it was found that the KM for lactate dehydrogenase matched literature values to better than one standard deviation of the literature experiment. Also studied were the effects of laser exposure on the stability of Myeloperoxidase at the liquid/gas interface. It was found that although myeloperoxidase degrades over several hours in buffer, there is no indication that the degradation is due to either denaturation at the free surface or to two-photon photolysis. Based on our accomplishments, we demonstrate the feasibility of using a levitated drop as a microreactor. The reactions discussed utilized in-house developed fiber optic and laser-based optical detection systems to monitor reaction kinetics inside a levitated drop via chemiluminescence and fluorescence. Outgrowths of these accomplishments will hopefully lead to the use of additional detection systems (including electrochemical and mass spectrometry) with the LDR to study a wide variety of biochemical reaction kinetics...|$|R
