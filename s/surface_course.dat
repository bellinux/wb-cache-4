40|$|The paper {{presents}} first results elaborated {{during the}} European Research Project Re-road which aims at {{the development of}} techniques for increasing the recycling rates of reclaimed asphalt. During service life <b>surface</b> asphalt <b>courses</b> are subjected to aging due to oxidation effects which causes the hardening of the binder and thereby {{a change in the}} chemical, physical and mechanical properties of the material. <b>Surface</b> <b>courses</b> often contain highly modified binders as well as special additives for improving the performance characteristics. As these layers inhibit the shortest service lives compared to other road construction layers every year high amounts of reclaimed surface asphalt are available for recycling. The question is raised how the reclaimed asphalt consisting of high quality and costly material components can be recycled for optimal added value. To analyze the asphalt mix service life performance and its recyclability during mix design a laboratory method is developed to simulate the real in-situ aging. First the effects of site aging on the binder and asphalt characteristics are presented. Three laboratory aging methods are discussed which aim the accelerated aging which meets similar property changes as site aging.

40|$|Research on {{the effects}} of deicing salts and their trace {{minerals}} on bituminous highway wearing courses was prompted by early pavement deterioration of federal and state highways in Indiana. Several bituminous <b>surface</b> <b>courses</b> containing slag, slag-dolomite, or dolomite aggregates showed deterioration soon after deicing salts were first applied. Initially, a detailed literature review (Appendix A of report) was conducted. Data on eighteen dolomite sources from a previous study (Bruner, Choi and West, 1995) plus ten additional dolomite sources formed the basis for the brine freeze thaw testing program. Mercury intrusion porosimetry testing conducted on multiple specimens showed that rock texture significantly affects pore size distribution. Petrographic analysis, acid etching of thin sections and electron microprobe studies revealed the distribution of clays on dolomite grains. Additional brine freeze thaw testing on selected dolomite sources, plus one slag sample, were conducted using deicing salts from six Indiana highway districts. Petrographic evaluation of pavement cores from the distressed pavements was accomplished. Brine freeze thaw test results ranged from 0. 6 to 27. 3 % loss for the 28 samples; this test is a good measure of aggregate durability. INDOT has recommended a maximum 30 % loss for the brine freeze thaw test. Regression analysis showed that acid insoluble residue content and sodium sulfate loss have the highest correlation with brine freeze thaw loss; elemental magnesium content has a negative correlation with it. It is concluded that dolomite aggregates with a low insoluble residue content have lower sulfate soundness losses, lower brine freeze-thaw losses and greater durability. Evaluation of pavement cores indicated no evidence of deterioration caused by aggregate weathering or degradation. Brine freeze thaw testing is a good measure of freeze thaw resistance of aggregates in bituminous <b>surface</b> <b>courses</b> and no evidence was found indicating that early deterioration of the pavements studied was caused by salt attack...|$|R

Asphalt Rubber (A-R) PFC can be used as an alternate to the standard PFC. A-R PFC is generally more expensive than the standard PFC; however, its unique properties warrant its use in certain applications. As a general rule A-R PFC is recommend over the standard PFC when placed as an overlay on an existing concrete pavement, when a high degree of noise reduction is desired and when placed as an overlay on a pavement that has a high amount of cracking. Although both types are excellent at draining water and reducing noise, standard PFC tends to drain water better than the A-R PFC but is generally not considered to be as quite as the A-R PFC.|$|E

Therefore, such phenomena {{may be caused by}} moisture vapor in the air. A new moisture permeation test apparatus was developed to analyze the mass transfer. Moisture permeation tests under typical hot summer conditions suggested that atmospheric moisture permeates and accumulates in bituminous mixtures through mass transfer by vapor diffusion despite the water impermeability of bituminous surface mixtures. The moisture permeation test provides an effective approach to analyze water storage mechanisms and moisture-related phenomena such as blistering in bituminous mixtures, although the test apparatus and condition settings require some improvement. 水分による歴青系舗装の損傷は，表面や路床から液状浸入した水が原因であると考えられてきた。しかし，滑走路等のアスファルト舗装表層は実質的に不透水であることが多い。したがって，著者らは大気中の水蒸気（湿気）がこれらの要因であると考え，この検証のために新しい透湿試験装置を開発した。透湿試験から，たとえ表層材料が実質的に不透水性であっても，典型的な夏の暑い日の気象条件においては水蒸気透過による物質移動により大気中の水分が透過し，凝縮した水分が混合物中に多量に蓄積しうることが明らかとなった。試験装置や試験条件に関してさらなる改良を加えることが必要であるものの，透湿試験は水分蓄積メカニズムの解明とブリスタリング現象等の水分に関連する損傷を評価する有効な試験方法である。Research Not...|$|R
