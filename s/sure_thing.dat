25|$|He entered Bates College, in Lewiston, Maine in 1979 {{and became}} {{interested}} in finance early on. Paul Erdman's The Billion Dollar <b>Sure</b> <b>Thing</b> {{played a role in}} his interest and shaped his early thoughts on financial markets. Vachon graduated from college in 1983, with a B.A. in economics, and went on to graduate from The Fletcher School of Tufts University, with an M.A. international finance.

All told, he contributed $1.7 {{million of his own}} money to finance advertisements and professional signature-gatherers. With the movement accelerated, the recall effort began to make national news and soon appeared to be almost a <b>sure</b> <b>thing.</b> The only question was whether signatures would be collected quickly enough to force the special election to take place in late 2003 rather than in March 2004.|$|E

500|$|Parker had by now pushed Presley into a heavy film making schedule, {{focused on}} formulaic, {{modestly}} budgeted musical comedies. Presley at first insisted on pursuing more serious roles, but when two films {{in a more}} dramatic vein—Flaming Star (1960) and Wild in the Country (1961)—were less commercially successful, he reverted to the formula. Among the 27 films he made during the 1960s, there were few further exceptions. His films were almost universally panned; critic Andrew Caine dismissed them as a [...] "pantheon of bad taste". Nonetheless, they were virtually all profitable. Hal Wallis, who produced nine of them, declared, [...] "A Presley picture is the only <b>sure</b> <b>thing</b> in Hollywood." ...|$|E

500|$|Halo gained {{positive}} reviews; on Metacritic, {{it currently}} holds an aggregated score of 97 out of 100, based on reviews from 68 professional critics. Ste Curran's review for Edge praised {{the game as}} [...] "the most important launch game for any console, ever" [...] and commented, [...] "GoldenEye was the standard for multiplayer console combat.

[...] GameSpot claimed that [...] "Halos single-player game is worth picking up an Xbox for alone," [...] concluding, [...] "Not only is this easily {{the best of the}} Xbox launch games, but it's easily one of the best shooters ever, on any platform." [...] IGN remarked similarly, calling Halo a [...] "can't miss, no-brainer, <b>sure</b> <b>thing,</b> five star, triple A game." [...] AllGame editor Jonathan Licata praised Bungie for doing [...] "a remarkable job with Halo, taking many successful elements from previous standouts in the genre to make one very playable game". Among the specific aspects that reviewers praised were the balance of weapons, the role of drivable vehicles, and the artificial intelligence of enemies.|$|E
500|$|By {{crossing}} the lush Wyoming and Salt River Ranges instead of circling via the deserts to the south, the route provided ample wood, grass and {{water for the}} travelers, and cut nearly 7 days off the total travel time for wagon trains going to Fort Hall. Despite the better conditions for livestock, the mountainous terrain and unpredictable weather made passage sometimes difficult and required continuing federally funded maintenance on the mountainous road—not a <b>sure</b> <b>thing</b> just before, {{during and after the}} American Civil War. Funds were appropriated in 1858 and 115 men (hired in Utah) completed the road in Wyoming and Idaho in 90 days, clearing timber and moving about [...] of earth. The Lander's road or cutoff opened in 1859 when it was extensively used. Records after 1859 are lacking and its use after that period are assumed to sharply decrease since the Sublette Cutoff, the Central Overland Route and other cutoffs were just about as fast or faster and were much less strenuous. Today the Lander cutoff road(s) are roughly followed by a series of county and Forest Service roads.|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reception}} towards [...] "God Help the Outcasts" [...] {{has been}} generally positive, with some critics dubbing the song the film's [...] "most memorable" [...] and [...] "best number." [...] Janet Maslin of The New York Times wrote very positively of [...] "God Help the Outcasts", saying, [...] "The score ... soars to sanctimonious heights with the lilting, catchy power ballad 'God Help the Outcasts'." [...] Maslin continued, [...] " [...] a <b>sure</b> <b>thing</b> for next year's Oscar show." [...] Deeming [...] "God Help the Outcasts" [...] "the primary song" [...] of The Hunchback of Notre Dame, Filmtracks.com hailed it as [...] "A truly lovely and inspirational piece."

500|$|Being There was {{received}} positively by critics. AllMusic editor Jason Ankeny gave the album a four-and-a-half stars {{and referred to}} it as [...] "the group's great leap forward." [...] He praised the band's ability to juxtapose psychedelia and power pop with tracks that [...] "wouldn't sound at all out of place on Exile on Main Street". Greg Kot, writing for Rolling Stone, gave the album four stars and lauded how it [...] "venture out into an anxiety-ridden world <b>sure</b> <b>thing...</b> the solace they continue to find in rock and roll." [...] Robert Christgau was more modest, writing [...] "there's no point in denying Jeff Tweedy's achievement as long as you recognize its insularity." [...] Ryan Schreiber of Pitchfork called the album [...] "massively improved as both a band and as songwriters" [...] but also noted that [...] "the two-disc set seems {{a little more than a}} marketing scheme." [...] In 2003, Pitchfork named it the 88th best album of the 1990s. Critics at The Village Voice named Being There the 14th best of the year on its Pazz & Jop critics poll for 1996.

500|$|The {{following}} {{season was}} a low point for the Rockets during Olajuwon's tenure. They finished 42–40, and missed {{the playoffs for the}} first time in Olajuwon's career. He missed two weeks early in the season due to an accelerated heart beat. Despite his usual strong numbers, he could not lift his team out of mediocrity. Since making the Finals in 1986, the Rockets had made the playoffs five times, but their record in those playoff series was 1–5 and they were eliminated in the first round four times. Following the season, Olajuwon requested a trade in part because of his bad contract; his salary was considerably low for a top center, and his contract specifically forbade re-negotiation. He also expressed displeasure with the organization's efforts to surround him with quality players. He felt the Rockets had cut corners at every turn, and were more concerned with the bottom line than winning. Management had also infuriated Olajuwon during the season when they accused of him of faking a hamstring injury because of his unhappiness over his contract situation. His agent cited his differences with the organization as being [...] "irreconcilable", and Olajuwon publicly insulted owner Charlie Thomas and the team's front office. With the 1992–93 season approaching, a reporter for the Houston Chronicle said that Olajuwon being dealt was [...] "as close to a <b>sure</b> <b>thing</b> as there is." ...|$|E

About {{this time he}} started the now defunct label, Croxton Records, with his friend Nick Corr, a radio DJ and music journalist. By {{the end of that}} year Michael Barclay (ex-Weddings Parties Anything) joined The <b>Sure</b> <b>Thing</b> on drums. Mick Thomas and The Sure Thing's debut album, Dead Set Certainty: 12 Songs That Wouldn't Go Away, appeared in October 1999 on Suitcase Records / Croxton Records. Badgley compared the release to his earlier work with Weddings Parties Anything, he found it was [...] "not as melodic, and more of a rawer sound ... but not altogether different".|$|E

50|$|The {{psychophysics}} {{of chance}} induce overweighting of <b>sure</b> <b>things</b> and of improbable events, relative to events of moderate probability. Underweighting of moderate and high probabilities relative to <b>sure</b> <b>things</b> contributes to risk-aversion {{in the realm}} of gains by reducing the attractiveness of positive gambles. The same effect also contributes to risk-seeking in losses by attenuating the aversiveness of negative gambles. Low probabilities, however, are overweighted, which reverses the pattern described above: low probabilities enhance the value of long-shots and amplify aversion to a small chance of a severe loss. Consequently, people are often risk-seeking in dealing with improbable gains and risk-averse in dealing with unlikely losses.|$|R

2500|$|The recall {{movement}} began slowly, largely {{relying on}} talk radio, a website, cooperative e-mail, word-of-mouth, and grassroots campaigning {{to drive the}} signature gathering. Davis derided the effort as [...] "partisan mischief" [...] by [...] "a handful of right-wing politicians" [...] and called the proponents losers. Nevertheless, by mid-May recall proponents said they had gathered 300,000 signatures. They sought to gather the necessary signatures by July {{in order to get}} the special election in the fall of 2003 instead of March 2004 during the Democratic presidential primary election, when Democratic Party turnout would presumably be higher. The effort continued to gather signatures, but the recall was far from a <b>sure</b> <b>thing</b> and the proponents were short on cash to promote their cause.|$|E
2500|$|Simpson's paradox {{demonstrates}} that this intuition cannot {{be derived from}} either classical logic or probability calculus alone, and thus led philosophers to speculate that it is supported by an innate causal logic that guides people in reasoning about actions and their consequences [...] Savage's sure-thing principle {{is an example of}} what such logic may entail. A qualified version of Savage's <b>sure</b> <b>thing</b> principle can indeed be derived from Pearl's do-calculus and reads: [...] "An action A that increases the probability of an event B in each subpopulation Ci of C must also increase the probability of B in the population as a whole, provided that the action does not change the distribution of the subpopulations." [...] This suggests that knowledge about actions and consequences is stored in a form resembling Causal Bayesian Networks.|$|E

2500|$|Originally, {{martingale}} {{referred to}} a class of betting strategies that was popular in 18th-century France. [...] The simplest of these strategies was designed for {{a game in which}} the gambler wins his stake if a coin comes up heads and loses it if the coin comes up tails. [...] The strategy had the gambler double his bet after every loss so that the first win would recover all previous losses plus win a profit equal to the original stake. [...] As the gambler's wealth and available time jointly approach infinity, his probability of eventually flipping heads approaches 1, which makes the martingale betting strategy seem like a <b>sure</b> <b>thing.</b> [...] However, the exponential growth of the bets eventually bankrupts its users, assuming the obvious and realistic finite bankrolls (one of the reasons casinos, though normatively enjoying a mathematical edge in the games offered to their patrons, impose betting limits). Stopped Brownian motion, which is a martingale process, can be used to model the trajectory of such games.|$|E
2500|$|George McClellan gave {{a series}} of private anatomy lectures before {{deciding}} to found a new medical school. Many unsuccessful requests had already been made for a new medical school in Philadelphia so he and others had the idea to couple it with Jefferson College in Canonsburg, Pennsylvania. With this in mind, he and others made a request to the Legislature of Pennsylvaniain 1824, and in 1825, received a charter for {{what was to become}} Jefferson Medical College. With the [...] "highly regarded" [...] University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine already being in Philadelphia, it was considered [...] "professional heresy" [...] to open a second school, but McClellan thought that opening a second medical school would just lead to more students going to Philadelphia to study medicine. Because of this, physicians at that time noted that he had to choose instructors [...] "greatly inferior in talent to himself" [...] and it was not a <b>sure</b> <b>thing</b> that the school would survive. The Jefferson Medical College opened in 1826, in Philadelphia, and in 1836 had an entering class of 360 medical students nonetheless and McClellan lectured in surgery. In 1838, Jefferson College separated from Jefferson Medical College, and all instructors, including McClellan, were vacated and the trustees hired all new individuals to teach. This change, unrelated to McClellan's leaving, led the school came to be considered a [...] "legitimate" [...] medical school.|$|E
