His first book, The Elegant Universe: <b>Superstrings,</b> Hidden Dimensions, and the Quest for the Ultimate Theory, published in 1999, is a popularization of superstring theory and M-theory. It was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize in nonfiction, and winner of The Aventis Prizes for Science Books in 2000.

40|$|Abstract: I {{review the}} {{construction}} of an action for open <b>superstring</b> field theory which does not suffer from the contact term problems of other approaches.

(Talk presented at 32 nd Ahrenshoop International Symposium on Elementary Particle Theory in Buckow, Germany) 1 Problems with Conventional Approach The construction of a field theory action for the <b>superstring</b> is an important problem since it may lead to information about non-perturbative <b>superstring</b> theory which is unobtainable from the on-shell perturbative S-matrix. This information might be useful for understanding the nonperturbative dualities of the <b>superstring.</b> Although there was much activity ten years ago concerning a field theory action for the bosonic string, there was not much progress on constructing a field theory action for the <b>superstring.</b> For reasons described below, there was no obvious generalization of the bosonic string field theory action to the <b>superstring.</b> Since th...|$|R

40|$|We {{revisit the}} tree-level closed <b>superstring</b> {{amplitude}} and identify its alpha'-expansion as series with single-valued multiple zeta values as coefficients. The latter represent a subclass of multiple zeta values originating from single-valued multiple polylogarithms at unity. Moreover, the alpha'-expansion of the closed <b>superstring</b> amplitude can be cast {{into the same}} algebraic form as the open <b>superstring</b> amplitude: the closed <b>superstring</b> amplitude essentially is the single-valued version of the open <b>superstring</b> amplitude. This fact points into a deeper connection between gauge and gravity amplitudes than what is implied by Kawai-Lewellen-Tye relations. Furthermore, we argue, that the Deligne associator carries the relevant information on the closed <b>superstring</b> amplitude. In particular, we give an explicit representation of the Deligne associator in terms of Gamma functions modulo squares of commutators of the underlying Lie algebra. This form of the associator {{can be interpreted as}} the four-point closed <b>superstring</b> amplitude. Comment: 21 pages, harvmac; v 2 : slightly improved version with Section 2 extended from Eq.
