40|$|Improving {{structural}} efficiency while reducing manufacturing costs are key objectives when making future heavy-lift launchers more performing and cost efficient. The main enabling technologies are {{the application of}} advanced high performance materials as well as cost effective manufacture processes. This paper presents the status and main results of a joint industrial research & development effort to demonstrate TRL 6 of a novel manufacturing process for large liquid propellant tanks for launcher applications. Using high strength aluminium-lithium alloy combined with the <b>spin</b> <b>forming</b> manufacturing technique, this development aims at thinner wall thickness and weight savings up to 25 % {{as well as a}} significant reduction in manufacturing effort. In this program, the concave <b>spin</b> <b>forming</b> process is used to manufacture tank domes from a single flat plate. Applied to aluminium alloy, this process allows reaching the highest possible material strength status T 8, eliminating numerous welding steps which are typically necessary to assemble tank domes from 3 D-curved panels. To minimize raw material costs for large diameter tank domes for launchers, the dome blank has been composed from standard plates welded together prior to <b>spin</b> <b>forming</b> by friction stir welding. After welding, the dome blank is contoured {{in order to meet the}} required wall thickness distribution. For achieving a material state of T 8, also in the welding seams, the applied <b>spin</b> <b>forming</b> process allows the required cold stretching of the 3 D-curved dome, with a subsequent ageing in a furnace. This combined manufacturing process has been demonstrated up to TRL 6 for tank domes with a 5. 4 m diameter. In this paper, the manufacturing process as well as test results are presented. Plans are shown how this process could be applied to future heavy-lift launch vehicles developments, also for larger dome diameters...|$|E

The application for the technology is to produce high strength low weight tank components for NASA s next generation launch vehicles. Since plate material is not currently manufactured large enough to fabricate these domes, two plates are joined by means of friction stir welding. The plates are then pre-contour machined to near final thicknesses allowing for a thicker weld land and anticipating the level of stretch induced by the <b>spin</b> <b>forming</b> process. The welded plates are then placed in a <b>spin</b> <b>forming</b> tool and hot stretched using a trace method producing incremental contours.

Stress corrosion cracking (SCC) tests were also performed by alternate immersion in a sodium chloride (NaCl) solution using the typical double beam assembly and with 4 -point loaded specimens and use of bent-beam stress-corrosion test specimens under alternate immersion conditions. In addition, experiments were conducted to determine the threshold stress intensity factor for SCC (K(sub ISCC)) which to our knowledge has not been determined previously for Al-Li 2195 alloy.

40|$|Cymbals {{are thin}} domed plates used as {{percussion}} instruments. When cymbals are struck, they vibrate and radiate sound. Cymbals are made through <b>spin</b> <b>forming,</b> hammering, and lathing. The <b>spin</b> <b>forming</b> creates the basic {{shape of the}} cymbal, which determines its basic vibration characteristics. The hammering and lathing produce specific sound adjustments by changing the cymbal's vibration characteristics. In this study, we study how hammering cymbals affects their vibration characteristics. The hammering produces plastic deformation (small, shallow dents) on the cymbal's surface, generating residual stresses throughout it. These residual stresses change the vibration characteristics. We perform finite element analysis of a cymbal to obtain its stress distribution and the resulting change in vibration characteristics. To reproduce the stress distribution, we use thermal stress analysis, and then with this stress distribution we perform vibration analysis. These results show {{that each of the}} cymbal's modes has a different sensitivity to the thermal load (i. e., hammering). This difference causes changes in the frequency response and the deflection shape that significantly improves the sound radiation efficiency.

The introduction of plastic deformation into a friction stir weld {{is a unique}} feature of the proposed manufacturing route. This investigation addressed abnormal grain growth [AGG] within the friction stir weldments during postfabrication processing of a prototype dome. The phenomenon of AGG was observed during the solution heat treatment [SHT] phase of T 8 tempering and {{is a major concern}} for meeting specifications. Such abrupt microstructural transitions can be detrimental to notch-sensitive mechanical properties, such as ductility and/or fracture toughness.

A simple, recovery annealing step was deemed to be the most readily-scalable solution when fabricating thin-walled, ellipsoidal domes. The research effort culminated in the development of an effective IAT, which resulted in a significant decrease in AGG following SHT. The processing philosophy adopted in designing the IAT is outlined and the microstructural reasons for success are discussed.

The applications of the mass scaling technique and contact algorithm between the roller and sheet are modeled. The modeling also considers the elasto-plastic material and Coulomb friction conditions. With the differences being variations in the rotation speed of the mandrel, the feed rate of the roller, and the material density. The predicted load-deformation relationships, the strain energy distributions, the full history of deformation states, and the influence and usage of the mass scaling factor are assessed.

Besides, some results of the dieless spinning process using a cylindrical mandrel are compared with the conventional spinning process.
