5|$|Named {{after the}} Austrian {{pediatrician}} Hans Asperger (1906–1980), Asperger <b>syndrome</b> <b>is</b> {{a relatively new}} diagnosis {{in the field of}} autism.|$|E
5|$|Rumination <b>syndrome</b> <b>is</b> a {{condition}} which affects {{the functioning of}} the stomach and esophagus, also known as a functional gastroduodenal disorder. In patients that have a history of eating disorders, Rumination <b>syndrome</b> <b>is</b> grouped alongside eating disorders such as bulimia and pica, which are themselves grouped under non-psychotic mental disorder. In most healthy adolescents and adults who have no mental disability, Rumination <b>syndrome</b> <b>is</b> considered a motility disorder instead of an eating disorder, because the patients tend to have had no control over its occurrence and have had no history of eating disorders.|$|E
5|$|Cases have {{reported}} muscle pain and weakness persisting for months, and antidepressant discontinuation {{may contribute to}} ongoing features. Following appropriate medical management, serotonin <b>syndrome</b> <b>is</b> generally associated with a favorable prognosis.|$|E
50|$|The {{majority}} of cases involve {{the central nervous system}} (CNS), which consists of the brain and spinal cord. The CNS <b>syndromes</b> can <b>be</b> subcategorized as either focal or diffuse. The focal <b>syndromes</b> <b>are</b> neurological, while the diffuse <b>syndromes</b> <b>are</b> psychiatric in nature. The most common CNS <b>syndromes</b> <b>are</b> headache and mood disorder.|$|R
50|$|These <b>syndromes</b> <b>are</b> {{childhood}} absence epilepsy, epilepsy with myoclonic absences, juvenile absence epilepsy {{and juvenile}} myoclonic epilepsy. Other proposed <b>syndromes</b> <b>are</b> Jeavons <b>syndrome</b> (eyelid myoclonia with absences), and genetic generalised epilepsy with phantom absences.|$|R
50|$|Two genetic <b>{{syndrome}}s</b> <b>are</b> {{named for}} him: Warkany syndrome 1 and Warkany <b>syndrome</b> 2 <b>is</b> named after him.|$|R
5|$|Cases of {{epilepsy}} may {{be organized}} into epilepsy syndromes by the specific {{features that are}} present. These features include the age that seizure begin, the seizure types, EEG findings, among others. Identifying an epilepsy <b>syndrome</b> <b>is</b> useful as it helps determine the underlying causes {{as well as what}} anti-seizure medication should be tried.|$|E
5|$|Cushing's <b>syndrome</b> <b>is</b> {{the manifestation}} of {{glucocorticoid}} excess. It can {{be the result of}} a prolonged treatment with glucocorticoids or be caused by an underlying disease which produces alterations in the HPA axis or the production of cortisol. Causes can be further classified into ACTH-dependent or ACTH-independent. The most common cause of endogenous Cushing's <b>syndrome</b> <b>is</b> a pituitary adenoma which causes an excessive production of ACTH. The disease produces a wide variety of signs and symptoms which include obesity, diabetes, increased blood pressure, excessive body hair (hirsutism), osteoporosis, depression and, most distinctively, stretch marks in the skin, caused by its progressive thinning.|$|E
5|$|Diagnosis of {{rumination}} <b>syndrome</b> <b>is</b> non-invasive {{and based}} on {{a history of the}} individual. Treatment is promising, with upwards of 85% of individuals responding positively to treatment, including infants and the mentally handicapped.|$|E
40|$|The {{inherited}} marrow failure <b>syndromes</b> <b>are</b> {{characterized by}} impaired hematopoiesis and cancer predisposition. Most inherited marrow failure <b>syndromes</b> <b>are</b> {{also associated with}} a range of congenital anomalies. These rare diseases offer important insights into general mechanisms governing human development, hematopoiesis and tumorigenesis. First, the clinical features of four of the inherited marrow failure syndromes: Fanconi anemia (FA), dyskeratosis congenita (DC), Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA), and Shwachman-Diamond <b>syndrome</b> (SDS), <b>are</b> briefly reviewed. Emerging molecular themes arising from recent studies of these <b>syndromes</b> <b>are</b> discussed. Finally, clinical applications arising from our growing understanding of molecular pathogenesis are explored...|$|R
50|$|Several {{researchers}} {{around the}} world are studying on the subject of 1q21.1 duplication <b>syndrome.</b> The <b>syndrome</b> <b>was</b> identified {{for the first time in}} people with heart abnormalities. The <b>syndrome</b> <b>was</b> later observed in patients who had autism or schizophrenia.|$|R
50|$|Pearson <b>Syndrome</b> <b>was</b> {{initially}} characterized in 1979 as a fatal {{disorder that}} affects infants. It {{has now been}} identified as a rare condition that affects multiple systems. The symptoms of Pearson <b>Syndrome</b> <b>are</b> mitochondrial cytopathy with anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia.|$|R
5|$|Hereditary hemorrhagic {{telangiectasia}} (HHT), {{also known}} as Osler–Weber–Rendu disease and Osler–Weber–Rendu <b>syndrome,</b> <b>is</b> a rare autosomal dominant genetic disorder that leads to abnormal blood vessel formation in the skin, mucous membranes, and often in organs such as the lungs, liver, and brain.|$|E
5|$|In {{those with}} severe weakness, prompt {{treatment}} with intravenous immunoglobulins or plasmapheresis, together with supportive care, {{will lead to}} good recovery in the majority. Recovery may take weeks to years. About a third have some permanent weakness. Globally death occurs in about 7.5% of those affected. Guillain–Barré <b>syndrome</b> <b>is</b> rare, at one or two cases per 100,000 people every year. Both sexes and {{all parts of the}} world have similar rates of disease. The <b>syndrome</b> <b>is</b> named after the French neurologists Georges Guillain and Jean Alexandre Barré, who described it with André Strohl in 1916.|$|E
5|$|McLeod <b>syndrome</b> <b>is</b> an X-linked {{recessive}} disorder {{caused by}} mutations in the XK gene encoding the Kx blood type antigen, {{one of the}} Kell antigens.|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Tics {{disorders}} and Tourette <b>syndrome</b> <b>are</b> commonly encountered in clinical practice. Currently, {{a vast number}} of behavioural, pharmacological and surgical treatments are available. Methods: Relevant and recent articles about clinical features, neurobiology and treatment of tic {{disorders and}} Tourette <b>syndrome</b> <b>were</b> reviewed and summarized. Results: Tic disorders and Tourette <b>syndrome</b> <b>are</b> frequently associated with comorbid conditions such as obsessive compulsive symp-toms, attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder, anxiety and depression, behavioural disorders and sleep difficulties.

50|$|Seed {{dispersal}} <b>syndromes</b> <b>are</b> {{parallel to}} pollination <b>syndromes,</b> which <b>are</b> defined as floral characteristics that attract organisms as pollinators. They are considered parallels {{because they are}} both plant-animal interactions, which increase the reproductive success of a plant. However, seed dispersal <b>syndromes</b> <b>are</b> more common in gymnosperms, while pollination <b>syndromes</b> <b>are</b> found in angiosperms.Seeds disperse to increase the reproductive success of the plant. The farther away a seed is from a parent, the better its chances of survival and germination. Therefore, a plant should select certain traits to increase dispersal by a vector (i.e. bird) to increase the reproductive success of the plant.|$|R
50|$|The <b>syndrome</b> <b>was</b> first {{described}} in 1978.|$|R
5|$|McLeod <b>syndrome</b> <b>is</b> very rare. There are {{approximately}} 150 cases of McLeod syndrome worldwide. Because of its X-linked mode of inheritance, {{it is much}} more prevalent in males.|$|E
5|$|Rumination <b>syndrome</b> <b>is</b> {{a poorly}} {{understood}} disorder, {{and a number}} of theories have speculated the mechanisms that cause the regurgitation, which is a unique symptom to this disorder. While no theory has gained a consensus, some are more notable and widely published than others.|$|E
5|$|The exact {{prevalence}} of obesity hypoventilation <b>syndrome</b> <b>is</b> unknown, and {{it is thought that}} many people with symptoms of OHS have not been diagnosed. About a third of all people with morbid obesity (a body mass index exceeding 40 kg/m2) have elevated carbon dioxide levels in the blood.|$|E
50|$|This <b>syndrome</b> <b>was</b> first {{described}} in 1981.|$|R
50|$|The best-known {{person who}} had Kallmann <b>syndrome</b> <b>was</b> {{probably}} the jazz vocalist Jimmy Scott; the <b>syndrome</b> <b>was</b> a contributing factor to Scott's unusually high-pitched and distinctive singing voice. In 2004, Canadian writer Brian Brett published a memoir, Uproar's Your Only Music, about growing up with Kallmann syndrome.|$|R
50|$|Iridocorneal Endothelial (ICE) <b>syndromes</b> <b>are</b> a {{spectrum}} of diseases characteriezed by slowly progressive abnormalities of the corneal endothelium and features including corneal edema, iris distortion, and secondary angle-closure glaucoma. 1,2,4 ICE <b>syndromes</b> <b>are</b> predominantly unilateral and nonhereditary 1,2,4. The condition occurs in predominantly middle-aged women 1,3,4.|$|R
5|$|This form of {{inheritance}} for Nasodigitoacoustic <b>syndrome</b> <b>is</b> not yet absolute, though, as a {{girl has}} been reported with the disorder. It is suggested that further analysis is needed for the inheritance to be formally established.|$|E
5|$|Whether {{isolated}} acute sensory loss can {{be regarded}} as a form of Guillain–Barré <b>syndrome</b> <b>is</b> a matter of dispute; this is a rare occurrence compared to GBS with muscle weakness but no sensory symptoms.|$|E
5|$|A {{well-documented}} {{example is}} found in the Amish migration to Pennsylvania in 1744. Two members of the new colony shared the recessive allele for Ellis–van Creveld syndrome. Members of the colony and their descendants tend to be religious isolates and remain relatively insular. As a result of many generations of inbreeding, Ellis-van Creveld <b>syndrome</b> <b>is</b> now much more prevalent among the Amish than in the general population.|$|E
40|$|Turner's <b>Syndrome</b> <b>was</b> first {{described}} in 1938 by Henry Turner {{and has an}} incidence of 1 : 3000 live female births. The authors present an unusual case of a 48 -year-old woman with late diagnosed Turner's <b>Syndrome.</b> Whose karyotype <b>was</b> (46,X,i(Xq)), associated with a pulmonary emphysema and pulmonary hypertension. The case and the methods of study are presented. Some aspects of this case, namely the hypothesis of an association between the pulmonary emphysema and Turner's <b>Syndrome</b> <b>are</b> discussed.

50|$|MEN <b>syndromes</b> <b>are</b> {{inherited}} as {{autosomal dominant}} disorders.|$|R
5|$|Another way enzyme {{malfunctions}} {{can cause}} disease comes from germline mutations in genes coding for DNA repair enzymes. Defects in these enzymes cause cancer because cells are {{less able to}} repair mutations in their genomes. This causes a slow accumulation of mutations and results {{in the development of}} cancers. An example of such a hereditary cancer <b>syndrome</b> <b>is</b> xeroderma pigmentosum, which causes the development of skin cancers in response to even minimal exposure to ultraviolet light.|$|E
5|$|As a {{pervasive}} developmental disorder, Asperger <b>syndrome</b> <b>is</b> distinguished by {{a pattern of}} symptoms rather than a single symptom. It is characterized by qualitative impairment in social interaction, by stereotyped and restricted patterns of behavior, activities and interests, and by no clinically significant delay in cognitive development or general delay in language. Intense preoccupation with a narrow subject, one-sided verbosity, restricted prosody, and physical clumsiness are typical of the condition, but are not required for diagnosis. Suicidal behavior appears to occur at rates similar to those without ASD.|$|E
5|$|Compartment <b>syndrome</b> <b>is</b> a {{clinical}} diagnosis, i.e., no diagnostic test conclusively proves its presence or absence, but direct {{measurement of the}} pressure in a fascial compartment, {{and the difference between}} this pressure and the blood pressure, may be used to assess its severity. High pressures in the compartment and a small difference between compartment pressure and blood pressure indicate that the blood supply is likely to be insufficient, and that surgical intervention may be needed.|$|E
