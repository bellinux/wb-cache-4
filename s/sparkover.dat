50|$|Each {{installation}} has {{a unique}} intensity and period of vibration at which the system will produce the greatest collecting efficiency. For example, low intensity causes significant buildup of dust on discharge wires ultimately limiting the power input to the precipitator due {{to a reduction in}} <b>sparkover</b> distance between electrodes. Furthermore, low intensity represses the formation of negative corona. Buildup can also affect the standard distribution of electrostatic forces, thereby causing oscillation of the discharge wires and high-tension frame.|$|E

5000|$|The {{dielectric}} breakdown strength of dry air, at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP), between spherical electrodes is approximately 33 kV/cm. This {{is only as}} a rough guide, since the actual breakdown voltage is highly dependent upon the electrode shape and size. Strong electric fields (from high voltages applied to small or pointed conductors) often produce violet-colored corona discharges in air, as well as visible sparks. Voltages below about 500-700 volts cannot produce easily visible sparks or glows in air at atmospheric pressure, so by this rule these voltages are [...] "low". However, under conditions of low atmospheric pressure (such as in high-altitude aircraft), or {{in an environment of}} noble gas such as argon or neon, sparks appear at much lower voltages. 500 to 700 volts is not a fixed minimum for producing spark breakdown, but it is a rule-of-thumb. For air at STP, the minimum <b>sparkover</b> voltage is around 327 volts, as noted by Friedrich Paschen.|$|E
50|$|The fire, {{caused by}} an {{electrical}} fault, occurred during the Saturday evening rush hour at about 6:00 p.m. The affected train, consisting of five fully loaded cars, had just left Ulduz station for Nariman Narimanov. The passengers in car number 5 smelled smoke. Later, passengers in car 4 observed white smoke, which soon turned black and caused irritation. The putative electrical malfunction (a <b>sparkover</b> or electric arc in electrical equipment {{in the rear of}} the fourth car) stopped the train about 200 meters from Ulduz station. When the train stopped, the tunnel became filled with smoke. The driver reported the incident and demanded that the power be cut. However, lethal emissions of carbon monoxide from the burning synthetic materials in the cars quickly affected the passengers. Because of difficulties opening the doors in one of the cars, the passengers were forced to evacuate through another car. Some 15 minutes after the fire started, the ventilation system was switched to exhaust mode and much of the smoke was drawn in the direction of evacuation. Several people were electrocuted while trying to grasp cables in order to escape the blazing train.|$|E
40|$|The glow- and streamer-corona {{discharge}} forms {{occurring in}} {{air at the}} positive central conductor of a coaxial-cylinder system are examined. It is found that, for conductor diameters up to 1. 2 cm, a glow discharge can be established, whereas for larger conductors streamer channels are always formed. For gaps preionised by irradiation from a 90 Sr source of strength 0. 4 mCi, the glow discharge is sustained for all conductor diameters. This produces a reduction in corona current of up to threefold {{and a decrease in}} acoustic noise. The critical diameter of the central conductor which gives a minimum <b>sparkover</b> voltage for the system is found to be dependent on whether alternating voltage or direct voltage is applied. This difference is interpreted in terms of the different corona development in the two cases, since the glow discharge suppresses streamer development and inhibits spark breakdown. Irradiation of the direct-voltage system thus increases the <b>sparkover</b> voltage for a positive central conductor; for a 1. 27 cm conductor diameter the average field strength across the gap at <b>sparkover</b> is increased from 0. 47 MV/m to 0. 74 MV/m. No increase in <b>sparkover</b> voltage is found for alternating-voltage systems...|$|E

This ablation plasma was used for a discharge induction by an ionization channel created by a XeCl laser. It was found that the ablation enhances the trigger and guide effect for induction of a long gap discharge. The guide length was elongated approximately twice. The ablation plasma bead reduced the 50 % <b>sparkover</b> voltage and the <b>sparkover</b> time. Electrical discharge leaders were observed by a flaming image converter camera.

40|$|The {{electrostatic}} precipitator {{has been widely}} used {{for many years in}} the electricity supply industry to remove particles from a gas stream. The collection of particles in an {{electrostatic precipitator}} is adversely affected if the resistivity of the particles is high. Attempts to overcome this problem have been made by: flue gas conditioning, operating at high and low temperatures, modifying the shape of the applied voltage. This project is limited to the investigation of the last method. Effects of negative pulsed voltage on the characteristics of corona discharge in clean atmosphere are investigated when the laboratory scale electrode system is clean with collector electrode in clean and contaminated conditions respectively. Fundamental characteristics of clean electrode system are investigated to check whether there is any difference in the discharge mechanism under negative pulsed and negative D. C. voltages. From the measurement of the light intensity emitted from the discharge electrode, the ionisation activities in the high field strength region are interpreted both in the forms of average corona current and the temporal development and movement of ions and electrons. Linear relat ionship is found to exist between the average photon current and the average corona current under both negative D. C, and pulsed voltages. When the average photon current is the same, the discharge patterns are similar for both kinds of voltage. The collisions of highly energised ions with neutral gas molecules give rise to the phenomenon which is known as Electrical Wind is studied. Experimental evidence of these characteristics coupled with a theoretical study of corona discharge indicate that within the frequency range of 13 Hz - 150 Hz the discharge mechanism is the same for both voltages, and the instantaneous properties of the corona current pulse are affected by the accumulation of negative and positive space charges in the neighbourhood of the discharge electrode. Sparking mode is studied with a multiple-point electrode and the results are compared with that obtained with a single point electrode to check the role of negative streamers in forming the complete breakdown. <b>Sparkover</b> voltage is measured when the electrode system is energised by negative D. C. voltage and is compared with that which is obtained with pulsed voltage. The characteristics of the electrode system are changed when the anode plane is covered with a layer of highresistivity, porous material which is used to simulate the contamination condition. The <b>sparkover</b> voltage of the system is drastically reduced by the local gas discharge which takes place in the contaminant. In order to explain the change of <b>sparkover</b> voltage with pulsed energisation, some important properties of the discharge are studied, such as: the distribution of surface charge which accumulates on the layer, the conduction of current and the electrical breakdown in the contaminant, the effect of surface potential gradient on the formation of a stable back discharge. These features are summarised in a proposed mechanism of the formation of back corona discharge. This is extended to explain an increase in <b>sparkover</b> voltage when the system is energised with pulsed voltage in comparison to that with negative D. C. voltage...|$|E

40|$|Detection {{of major}} faults in power {{transformers}} during impulse tests {{has never been}} an issue, but is rather difficult when only a minor fault, say a <b>sparkover</b> between adjacent coils or turns, lasting for a few microseconds occurs. However, detection of such type of fault {{is very important to}} avoid any catastrophic situation. In this paper, we have proposed a new and powerful method capable of detecting minor incipient faults. The approach is based on wavelet transform analysis, particularly the dyadic-orthonormal wavelet transform. The key idea underlying the approach is to decompose a given faulty neutral current response into other signals which represent a smoothed and detailed version of the original. The decomposition is performed by multiresolution signal decomposition technique. Preliminary simulation work demonstrated here, shows that the proposed method is robust and far superior to other existing methods to resolve such type of faults...|$|E
40|$|Although gapped {{silicon carbide}} arresters {{are no longer}} {{purchased}} by electricity authorities, they still form {{the majority of the}} very large number of distribution arresters in service in Australia and many other countries.

40|$|Abstract- A {{study on}} the {{dielectric}} characteristics of the Glass Fiber Reinforced Plastic (GFRP) is important for designing a reliable high voltage superconducting machines such as transmission superconducting fault current limiters, superconducting cables, and superconducting transformers. In this paper, dielectric experiments of the GFRP under lightning impulse voltage are conducted in liquid nitrogen(LN 2) according to various experimental conditions such as the thicknesses of the GFRP, the diameters of electrode systems and the pressures. The dielectric characteristics of the GFRP are analyzed by using a Finite Elements Method(FEM) according to various field utilization factors. It {{has been reported that}} the electrical insulation design of the GFRP would be conducted by considering the mean electric field intensity(Emean) distributed inside the GFRP. In this study, it is found that the dielectric performance of the GFRP could be explained by not only Emean but also the maximum electric field intensity (Emax). Finally, the empirical formulae of the GFRP to estimate an electrical breakdown voltage at <b>sparkover</b> under the lightning impulse condition are deduced. It is expected that the presented experimental results in this paper are helpful to design electrically reliable high voltag...|$|E
40|$|The {{breaking}} of discharge electrode {{that makes the}} operation of electrostatic precipitator (EP) impossible {{is considered to be}} a cause of the material fatigue due to the excessive <b>sparkover</b> on discharge electrode opposite the edge part of collecting plate electrode. In this paper, the optimum countermeasure for edge effect in the latter case has been determined with taking notice of the geometric structure of electrodes. As for the discussion of the edge effect, the corona current density distributions on collecting and discharge electrode have been measured by the use of a divided electrode and a particular discharge electrode. Observations of corona discharge phenomena in the edge area with Schlieren apparatus have completed the edge effect measurements. The set of results indicate that the edge effect is lowered as the geometric coefficient D/R (the ratio of the space distance between active and passive electrode D to the radius of collecting electrode edge R) and the average field strength decreases. It is concluded that the countermeasure for the edge effect is sufficient if the geometric conditions which D/R is less than equal to 1 are satisfied...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{a study of}} the minimum ignition energy (MIE) of easily ignitable dust clouds in air. The MIE is a central parameter when assessing the risk involved when handling combustible dusts. Current standard test apparatus for determining MIE of dust clouds has a lower energy limit in the range of 1 - 3 mJ, which is a quite severe limitation because many dusts ignite readily at this energy level. Thus, the true MIE remains unknown for a number of easily ignitable dusts. A new spark generator, capable of producing synchronised sparks of very low energies and with an integrated system for measuring spark energy, has therefore been developed and applied to a number of ignition sensitive dusts. The experiments showed that several dusts did in fact have MIEs 1 - 2 orders of magnitude lower than 1 mJ. The new spark generator may therefore offer a basis for developing a standard test apparatus in the low-energy region. An investigation of a possible spark triggering mechanism that may take place in industrial practice has also been performed, and using this method, MIEs of several dusts were determined. Unlike the conventional method for determining MIE in the laboratory, the delay between dust dispersion and spark discharge was not a degree of freedom. In stead, the transient dust cloud was used to initiate spark breakdown between electrodes set at a high voltage lower than breakdown in pure air. As would be expected, the MIEs found by this method were somewhat higher than those obtained using conventional methods. This was ascribed to the non-optimal conditions for ignition at <b>sparkover,</b> which is believed to be closer to the mechanism of accidental electrostatic spark initiation in an industrial plant. There optimal independent dust dispersion and artificial spark triggering is not a realistic scenario. However, even when using this non-optimal method of spark triggering, MIEs below 1 mJ were found...|$|E
40|$|Oscillographic {{measurement}} and time-resolved photographic recording {{have been used}} to examine the breakdown of rod/rod, rod/sphere and rod/plane gaps with long-duration negative impulse potentials of up to 1 MV crest. As in the positive discharge, the breakdown process is found often to cease for considerable periods on the impulse wave tail. Breakdown then occurs after a long time lag for gaps composed of rod cathodes and rod or small sphere anodes. Where the anode is large, no long time lags are observed. Measurement of the variation of breakdown strength with time during the impulse duration has been made by the superimposition of a second impulse upon the first, following a controllable delay. The results show a minimum probability of breakdown initiation after 15 Î¼s of the applied impulse, and a subsequent slow recovery. It is suggested that this confirms the effect of the initial corona phase in causing space charge fouling of the gap. The breakdown voltage of rod/rod gaps is shown to decrease by up to 30 % when the impulse wave front is reduced from 0. 50 to 0. 06 Î¼s. The breakdown strength with negative impulses is thus less than with positive impulses for wave fronts faster than 0. 20 Î¼s. For the wave form 0. 50 / 2000 Î¼s, the breakdown voltage is found to depend more critically upon the dimensions of the earthed electrode than is the case with positive impulses. The breakdown voltage for a rod/ 25 cm sphere gap is 73 % greater than for a rod/rod gap, yet also 15 % greater than for a rod/plane gap. For gap lengths between 25 and 65 cm, the breakdown voltage of the rod/plane gap is found to increase with decreasing wave front duration. The variation of the negative impulse corona with rate of potential rise and with crest voltage is examined photographically. Many of the observed variations of breakdown voltage and time-lag characteristics can be accounted for in terms of the impulse corona phase. The time-resolved photography of the negative discharge over a wide range of conditions suggests that in the range of gap lengths investigated the formation of the positive leader rather than the negative leader is the necessary forerunner of <b>sparkover...</b>|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2015 - 10 Indoor air {{pollution}} {{is a source}} of risk for diseases, such as stroke, ischemic heart disease, respiratory infections, and lung cancer. According to the World Health Organization, nearly 4. 3 million people die each year due to exposure to household {{air pollution}}. Residential, commercial, and medical facilities use air filters to remove particles from the air stream to maintain indoor air quality. Electrostatic precipitators (ESPs), a common type of air filter, use the corona effect to charge particles, and collect the charged particles using a designed electrostatic field. Most of the components of ESPs are placed along the path of airflow so that there are very few obstacles that obstruct the airflow, making the pressure drop across ESPs low and allowing ESPs to operate in an energy efficient fashion. However, certain collected particles re-enter the environment due to external disturbances, such as strong airflow, vibrations, and spark discharge (<b>sparkover).</b> This act of particle re-entrainment lowers collection efficiency. Commercial ESPs attempt to mitigate particle re-entrainment by adding a fibrous post-filter. However, the implementation of a fibrous filter impedes airflow, increasing the pressure drop across the ESP. Thus, one of the main design considerations for an ESP is determining the engineering trade-off, where the ESP is capable of capturing the required percentage of particles in the air, yet the pressure drop is not high enough to become economically prohibitive. This dissertation presents two particle-trapping mechanisms that are added to the collecting electrodes of two-stage ESPs to suppress particle re-entrainment without introducing additional pressure drop. The main idea behind particle-trapping mechanisms is to store the collected particles in secured spaces, where disturbances are less likely to cause particle re-entrainment. One promising particle-trapping mechanism involves covering the collecting electrodes with porous foam, allowing particles to attach to the surface inside the pores of the foam, instead of the flat surface of the bare collecting electrode. Another particle-trapping mechanism involves covering the collecting electrodes with perforated guidance plates. Gaps are intentionally left between the guidance plate and the collecting electrode to allow particles to enter through the holes, and remain inside the gaps. Particles collected by either particle-trapping mechanism have a lower chance of returning to the air stream, because there are fewer disturbances inside the pores or gaps than on the flat surfaces of the bare collecting electrodes. The inclusion of either mechanism improves collection efficiency, and therefore, a post-filter is no longer required. Foam-covered ESPs have been tested to have up to 99 % collection efficiency. The energy analysis showed that when the fiber-based filters in Loew Hall at the University of Washington were replaced with foam-covered electrostatic precipitators, the operating cost per airflow reduced by 26. 5 %. Guidance-plate-covered ESPs have been proven to have up to 22 % higher collection efficiency than conventional ESPs that have no particle-trapping mechanism. This dissertation presents and discusses both foam-covered ESPs and guidance-plate-covered ESPs from various perspectives, attempting to move two-stage ESPs a step closer for non-industrial applications...|$|E
