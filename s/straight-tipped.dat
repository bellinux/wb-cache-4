2500|$|The Prefect, {{like the}} Grunau Baby, was a single-seat fabric-covered wooden glider. It had {{high-mounted}} semi-cantilever straight-tapered wings, {{with a single}} wing bracing strut on each side, {{from the base of}} the fuselage to the wing spar. The span was 150mm (6in) greater than that of the Grunau Baby, and the tips enclosed the outer ends of the ailerons. Mid-chord airbrakes were fitted just outboard of the wing strut ends, extending above and below the wing. The fuselage was flat sided, and tapered from the trailing edge of the wing to a very small fin bearing a large, aerodynamically-balanced and slightly reshaped rudder that extended down to the keel. The <b>straight-tipped</b> tailplane, mounted on the top of the fuselage and braced from below, had a strongly swept leading edge and was placed with its trailing edge at the fin's leading edge, so that the elevators lacked the large cut out for rudder movement seen on the earlier glider. The open cockpit was better enclosed at the sides and had a small windscreen; for access, the cockpit sides and windscreen were removed as a single piece. [...] Slingsby also added a [...] single-wheel undercarriage in addition to the earlier nose skid, placed below mid-chord.|$|E
50|$|The Grifo's {{fuselage}} was a ply covered wooden {{hexagonal structure}} with deep sides. The open cockpit, {{fitted with a}} small windscreen, was immediately ahead of the pedestal which dropped rapidly away to the upper fuselage behind the trailing edge. All the tail surfaces were straight-tapered and <b>straight-tipped,</b> with the tailplane mounted {{on top of the}} fuselage and carrying unbalanced elevators. The fin was small but mounted a large, balanced rudder which extended down to the keel, working in an elevator cut-out and provided with a protecting tail bumper. The Grifo's landing skid, equipped with rubber shock absorbers, was short, only reaching as far aft as the forward wing strut.|$|E
