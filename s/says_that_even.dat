5|$|At the apartment, Father John and Lloyd find Linda {{has moved}} out, but they {{discover}} she had possessed a 12-year-old newspaper clipping about Father John's ordination. Father John offers Lloyd a job helping {{out at the}} church, which Lloyd accepts. Father John then returns to his church and cries, fearing he {{is too late to}} save Linda. Meanwhile, Linda goes to a bridge and is about to jump off when she encounters Gus, who offers her the rosary he received earlier from Father John. A grateful and emotional Linda hugs Gus. It is not revealed whether she commits suicide or not. In a confession to Father Ralph, Father John expresses guilt he did not absolve Linda before her confession abruptly ended. Father Ralph <b>says</b> <b>that</b> <b>even</b> if Linda is dead, her soul is immortal, and that Father John's penance is to absolve her now. Father John does so. The film ends with a childhood memory of young Linda at church, where a group of boys laugh at her old torn clothes until she is defended by a young John Buerlein, whose act seems to make a strong positive impact upon her.|$|E

She refers to Krishna-Vithoba as the [...] "champion of the low", and as a mother. Kanhopatra also asserts the importance of repeating the names of God and reveals how chanting His names has helped her. She <b>says</b> <b>that</b> <b>even</b> Death would fear God's name, which purified the sinner king Ajamila – who ascended to heaven when he coincendentally called to God at his death bed, the [...] "robber" [...] Valmiki – who {{was transformed into a}} great sage by utterance of God's name – and even the prostitute Pingala. Kanhopatra says, she wears the garland of His names. She hoped that her chanting would ultimately lead her to salvation.

500|$|Contributing to psychedelia's {{emergence}} {{into the}} pop mainstream was {{the release of}} Beach Boys' Pet Sounds (May 1966) and the Beatles' Revolver (August 1966). Often {{considered one of the}} earliest albums in the canon of psychedelic rock, Pet Sounds contained many elements that would be incorporated into psychedelia, with its artful experiments, psychedelic lyrics based on emotional longings and self-doubts, elaborate sound effects and new sounds on both conventional and unconventional instruments. The album track [...] "I Just Wasn't Made for These Times" [...] contained the first use of theremin sounds on a rock record. Scholar Philip Auslander <b>says</b> <b>that</b> <b>even</b> though psychedelic music is not normally associated with the Beach Boys, the [...] "odd directions" [...] and experiments in Pet Sounds [...] "put it all on the map. ... basically that sort of opened the door — not for groups to be formed or to start to make music, but certainly to become as visible as say Jefferson Airplane or somebody like that." [...] Like Pet Sounds, Revolver explored musical soundscapes that could not be replicated in concert, even with the addition of an orchestra. The Beatles' May 1966 B-side [...] "Rain", recorded during the Revolver sessions, was the first pop recording to include reversed sounds. It makes full use of an assortment of studio tricks such as varispeed and backwards taping, combining them with a droning melody that further highlights a growing interest in non-Western musical form. Author Simon Philo believes the song to be [...] "the birth of British psychedelic rock". [...] Author Steve Turner recognises the Beatles' success in conveying an LSD-inspired worldview on Revolver, particularly on [...] "Tomorrow Never Knows", as having [...] "opened the doors to psychedelic rock (or acid rock)".|$|E

[...] Proponents believe that non-inclusion reduces the {{disabled}} students' social importance and that maintaining their social visibility {{is more important}} than their academic achievement. Proponents <b>say</b> <b>that</b> society accords disabled people less human dignity when they are less visible in general education classrooms. Advocates <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>even</b> if typical students are harmed academically by the full inclusion of certain special needs students, that the non-inclusion of these students would still be morally unacceptable, as advocates believe that the harm to typical students' education is always less important than the social harm caused by making people with disabilities less visible in society.|$|R

She meets Brody Weston (Dean Geyer), a handsome NYADA junior, who encourages Rachel {{to move on and}} embrace college life. Rachel also deals with her overpowering dance instructor Cassandra July (Kate Hudson), who believes that she does not {{have what it takes to}} become a star.

In the episode [...] "Makeover", Rachel gets picked on by a group of female dancers for her childish appearance. With the help of Kurt and his new boss Isabelle Wright (Sarah Jessica Parker), she is convinced to get a makeover. Her new look is met with positive reception from others, including Brody, and she invites him over to dinner. Right after their first kiss, Rachel discover Finn on her doorstep. While visiting, Rachel learns that Finn was medically discharged from the army several weeks ago, and that he no longer wants to live in New York after seeing how happy she was without him. Finn takes off and goes back to Lima where Rachel confronts him, and <b>says</b> <b>that</b> <b>even</b> though she loves him, she can no longer stay in their relationship. She and Brody begin to see each other, and she lets him move in so that they can be closer. When she returns for Will and Emma's wedding, she and Finn reconnect as friends. When Finn asks about Brody, she says that they are not exclusive. Finn says that the reason she has not committed to Brody is because she still thinks they will end up together. They sleep together after the reception, but Rachel leaves after Finn falls asleep. She is later shown taking a pregnancy test; Santana, who has recently moved in, snoops and discovers the discarded test, and confronts Rachel, who then bursts into tears. The two go together to get Rachel checked at a clinic, where she is informed that it was a false alarm. She later breaks up with Brody after Santana reveals that he is a male escort and is stunned to find out Finn flew to New York just to beat him up. When Rachel breaks up with Brody, she admits that the relationship never would have worked because she was using it to try to get over her heartache about Finn. Rachel auditions for Funny Girl and sings [...] "Don't Stop Believin'", imagining the original New Directions members singing in the background. She is called back for further auditions for the title role, Fanny Brice. In the finale, Rachel sings [...] "To Love You More" [...] at the final callback before the role is cast.|$|E

He <b>says</b> <b>that</b> <b>even</b> {{the timing of the}} Messiah in years and in relation to events is predicted, and that the Jewish Talmud (not accepting Jesus as the Messiah, see also Rejection of Jesus) laments that the Messiah had not appeared despite the scepter being taken away from Judah.|$|E
