5|$|Woodpeckers {{are small}} to {{medium-sized}} birds with chisel-like beaks, short legs, stiff tails, and long tongues used for capturing insects. Some <b>species</b> <b>have</b> feet with two toes pointing forward and two backward, while several <b>species</b> <b>have</b> only three toes. Many woodpeckers have {{the habit of}} tapping noisily on tree trunks with their beaks. Nine <b>species</b> <b>have</b> been recorded in North Carolina.|$|R
50|$|All adult tardigrades of {{the same}} <b>species</b> <b>have</b> {{the same number of}} cells (see eutely). Some <b>species</b> <b>have</b> as many as 40,000 cells in each adult, while others have far fewer.|$|R

5000|$|All of the <b>species</b> <b>have</b> soft, pithy wood. Scalesia <b>species</b> <b>have</b> {{been called}} [...] "the Darwin's finches {{of the plant}} world" [...] because they show a {{similarly}} dramatic pattern of adaptive radiation.|$|R
50|$|At {{least eight}} <b>species</b> <b>have</b> been named, {{and at least}} two undescribed <b>species</b> <b>have</b> been {{identified}} by genetic analysis. Studies of genetic differences suggest the genus originated in California around 50 million years ago.|$|R

50|$|Most Leptolalax <b>species</b> <b>have</b> been {{reported}} from very small areas {{and only a}} few <b>species</b> <b>have</b> large areas of occurrence. Whether this distinction is real or the widespread species represent cryptic species complexes remains to be confirmed.|$|R
50|$|The genus has a {{cosmopolitan}} distribution, with {{species in the}} Americas, Europe, Asia, Africa and Australia. Several <b>species</b> <b>have</b> also colonised some oceanic islands, and two <b>species</b> <b>have</b> been introduced to New Zealand. Several species are migratory.|$|R
