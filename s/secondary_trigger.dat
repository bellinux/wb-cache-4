50|$|Nikonov's ASM and Stechkin's design {{were the}} only two truly {{innovative}} designs in the Abakan competition that made it to the final testing round; all other 6 competitors that made it that far were based on more conventional designs. Stechkin's design could fire two-round bursts at 2000 rpm or sustained fire at 600 rpm. Stechkin's gun was slightly more accurate than Nikonov's, but turned out less reliable, mainly because it accumulated more fouling. Nikonov's design won and became the AN-94. In TKB-0146, switching from one-round semi-automatic to fully automatic fire was accomplished by a <b>secondary</b> <b>trigger</b> located behind the main trigger. Squeezing the main trigger slightly, fired off a single round. Pulling it back fully, so that it pressed the <b>secondary</b> <b>trigger,</b> enabled fully automatic fire. Switching to the two-round burst mode was done by operating a different lever.|$|E
5000|$|Valve Software's Half-Life 2 made {{significant}} use of physics in the game, {{powered by the}} Source engine. The physics engine within Source is derived from Havok, which opens up a wealth of possibilities for object interaction - particularly when later in the game, Freeman receives an energy-beam weapon that lets him move huge objects. Although the player can pick up and throw objects early in the game, this ability is somewhat limited in scope. Around {{a quarter of the}} way through the game, the player acquires the gravity gun, properly named as the [...] "zero-point energy field manipulator". Alyx Vance explains that the gravity gun is designed for handling hazardous materials, but is mostly used for heavy lifting. She explains to Gordon that she once found it useful [...] "for clearing minefields". The gravity gun significantly increases the player's ability to manipulate objects in the game. Like most other weapons in the game, the gravity gun has two trigger functions. The primary trigger causes the gun to emit a small discharge which emits energy to the targeted object. The distance which the object is forced is dependent on its weight and distance from the gun. The <b>secondary</b> <b>trigger</b> attracts the targeted object to the gun and holds it in midair a few inches away, negating its weight and allowing the player to carry it with them. Using the <b>secondary</b> <b>trigger</b> again will drop the item, while the primary trigger will launch it with considerable force.|$|E

30|$|In conclusion, two new {{genes from}} the terpenoid {{synthesis}} pathway, designated as AmSesTPS 1 and AmGuaiS 1 were successfully cloned from A. malaccensis. Quantitative expression analysis suggests both are wound inducible genes that respond early after wounding {{and could be}} re-induced later if given <b>secondary</b> <b>triggers</b> such as naturally occurring biological infestation. Agarwood is rich in secondary metabolites, specifically sesquiterpenes. Therefore, the identification of TPS genes provides new information for molecular investigation of TPSs in general and possibly contributes to another perspective on the diversity and evolutionary of TPSs found in nature.

Hathaway thinks he has killed the true imposter, but as his men move debris away from the Centauri ship, the real Spencer's body is revealed.

50|$|A reach {{extender}} {{takes the}} form of a long metal or plastic pole, usually not exceeding one meter (3 feet) in length, with a handle at one end and a pair of jaws at the other end. The handle is equipped with a trigger that, when pulled, closes the jaws via a lever-and-spring system within the pole. The jaws are open by default and become open when the trigger is released. Some reach extenders may possess a <b>secondary</b> <b>trigger</b> which locks the jaws in position around whatever object they are holding, so the user does not need to maintain a tight grip on the handle. Others have jaws equipped with suction cups for holding round objects more easily, and still others have small magnets for collecting lightweight metallic items. Variations on the basic form of a reach extender depend on what task needs to be accomplished, and significant variation is found in the length of the pole and the maximum weight the reach extender can bear.|$|E

Agrobacterium-mediated transient expression in Nicotiana benthamiana confirms that the siRNA-initiating miRNAs, miR 173 and miR 828, are effective as triggers only if expressed in a 22 -nt form and, conversely, that increasing the length of miR 319 from 21 to 22 nt converts it to an siRNA trigger. We also predicted and validated that the 22 -nt miR 771 is a <b>secondary</b> siRNA <b>trigger.</b> Our data demonstrate that the function of small RNAs is influenced by size, and that a length of 22 nt facilitates the <b>triggering</b> of <b>secondary</b> siRNA production...|$|R

40|$|We analyze flare-associated {{transverse}} oscillations in a quiescent solar prominence on 2010 September 8 - 9. Both the flaring {{active region}} and the prominence were located near the west limb, with a favorable configuration and viewing angle. The full-disk extreme ultraviolet (EUV) images of the Sun obtained with high spatial and temporal resolution by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory show flare-associated lateral oscillations of the prominence sheet. The STEREO-A spacecraft, 81. ° 5 ahead of the Sun-Earth line, provides an on-disk view of the flare-associated coronal disturbances. We derive the temporal profile of the lateral displacement of the prominence sheet by using the image cross-correlation technique. The displacement curve was de-trended and the residual oscillatory pattern was derived. We fit these oscillations with a damped cosine function with a variable period and find that the period is increasing. The initial oscillation period (P 0) is ∼ 28. 2 minutes and the damping time (τD) ∼ 44 minutes. We confirm the presence of fast and slow EUV wave components. Using STEREO-A observations, we derive a propagation speed of ∼ 250 km s– 1 for the slow EUV wave by applying the time-slice technique to the running difference images. We propose that the prominence oscillations are excited by the fast EUV wave while the increase in oscillation period of the prominence is an apparent effect, related to a phase change due to the slow EUV wave acting as a <b>secondary</b> <b>trigger.</b> We discuss implications of the dual trigger effect for coronal prominence seismology and scaling law studies of damping mechanisms...|$|E
30|$|Causes of GLOF {{has been}} {{discussed}} by many researchers (Emmer and Cochachin. 2013; Iwata et al. 2002; Yamada 1998; Vuichard and Zimmermann 1987) and there are comprehensive review on causes of GLOFs in the past (Falátková 2016; Komori et al. 2012). The published work acknowledges the role of external factor as a trigger to unleash the GLOF, thus discussions on the cause of GLOF includes two aspects: triggering mechanism and breach mechanism. The triggering mechanism which directly or indirectly causes the breach has been referred as “dynamic cause” by Emmer and Cochachin (2013). Iwata et al. (2002) in their work on causes of GLOF from moraine dam in Bhutan Himalaya has categorized trigger into in-direct trigger and direct trigger. They imply existence of cause-effect relationship amongst direct trigger, in-direct trigger, and cause of the GLOF, which is also illustrated by Emmer and Cochachin (2013) and Falátková (2016). Two indirect triggers discussed in the review are earthquake and global warming, which evoke secondary process such as ice-calving, glacier surge, failure of outlet, which eventually causes the breach (Iwata et al. 2002). The <b>secondary</b> <b>trigger</b> is termed as direct trigger as it is this that actually directly contribute in failure of the moraine dam. Earthquake can therefore be a direct trigger in an event the breach of moraine dam is caused by seismic tremors (Clauge and Evans 2000). The global warming may not be obvious as indirect trigger like earthquake, but Liu et al. (2014) did find correlation between higher GLOF of frequency and air temperature in Tibet during 1960 s, 1980 s. Similarly Chen et al. (2010) argued that GLOF magnitude and frequency {{are closely related to}} positive temperature trend.|$|E
40|$|Objective: Objectives of {{this study}} were to (1) {{quantify}} the immediate effect of Nimmo technique on muscle elasticity, pain perception, and disability and (2) evaluate comparative effectiveness of treating all primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>trigger</b> points (TrPs) vs primary TrP only. Methods: Fourteen chronic low back pain subjects recruited from a chiropractic college were tested in this within-day repeated-measures design study. Gluteus medius containing a prominent TrP was indented for 4 sessions using a mechanoacoustic indentor system. A finite element optimization method extracted hyperelastic material constants of the gluteus medius. Load-deformation response on a standardized block was simulated. Area under the load-deformation curve from 0 % to 25 % deformation (A FE) and force at 25 % deformation (F FE) were determined. No treatment was applied {{between the first and second}} sessions. Only the primary TrP in gluteus medius was treated between the second and third sessions. Full Nimmo treatment was used between the third and fourth sessions requiring treatment of all primary and secondary TrPs. The A FE, F FE, tissue thickness, subjective pain, and Oswestry Disability Index were compared between sessions. Results: After full Nimmo treatment, A FE and F FE were significantly smaller than baseline (P =. 021 and. 027, respectively) and focal TrP treatment only (P =. 003 and. 001, respectively). The changes accompanied concomitant improvement in subjective pain and disability. It appears that focal TrP treatment resolves TrP, but full Nimmo treatment further reduces electrogenic spasm. Conclusions: Immediate effect of a single full Nimmo treatment appears to reduce muscle tone, subjective pain, and disability and be more beneficial than focal TrP treatment.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{describe}} a new clinical observation of "tactile dysgeusia," a phenomenon associated with otologic and skull base surgery likely caused by {{injury to the}} chorda tympani nerve (CTN) or the nervus intermedius (NI) with subsequent aberrant cross-innervation with somatosensory fibers in the surgical field. STUDY DESIGN: Descriptive case series. SETTING: Tertiary university referral center. METHOD: Eight patients described a sensation of touch-evoked dysgeusia after surgery. Seven patients underwent a variety of middle ear procedures including stapedotomies and mastoidectomies. One patient had a large cerebellopontine angle meningioma excised through a translabyrinthine approach. There were no preoperatively sensory symptoms of any kind. RESULTS: In five of seven patients who had an otologic procedure, the CTN nerve was transected, whereas in the remaining two, the nerve was preserved but stretched. In the meningioma patient, the facial nerve was preserved without clear identification of the NI; the facial nerve function was normal postoperatively. All of the otologic patients experienced symptoms of dysgeusia and sensory alteration triggered by touching {{various parts of the}} outer ear. One also has a <b>secondary</b> <b>trigger</b> in the V 2 dermatome. In the meningioma patient, taste and sensory alteration was induced by stimulating the ipsilateral V 2 and V 3 dermatome. In all patients, the symptom was located in the lateral aspect of the ipsilateral hemitongue. CONCLUSION: Tactile dysgeusia is an unusual complication after otologic and neurotologic procedures. It is likely related to aberrant re-innervation of the special sensory fibers within the CTN nerve or the NI with somatosensory fibers. Postoperative "tactile dysgeusia" may not be so rare; its true incidence could only be ascertained through a more rigorous postoperative assessment...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to conduct a comprehensive analysis of clinical changes and electroneuro­myographic indices in people with multiple sclerosis in combination with various types of functional disorders of posture. The study involved 105 people with multiple sclerosis aged 26 – 58 who were undergoing rehabilitation at a specialized medical center. The degree of spasticity of the muscles was determined by the modified Ashworth scale. To assess the intensity and nature of pain, a neurologic examination was performed using a visual analogue scale and a McGilovsky pain questionnaire. Interference and stimulation electroneuromyography was used to characterize the functional state of the peripheral neuromotor apparatus of skeletal muscles, the results of which determined the maximum arbitrary contraction of the muscle using quantitative analysis of time, amplitude and frequency parameters, and also determined the speed of the pulse, the amplitude and duration of the F wave, latent period and polyphase M-wave, monosynaptic testing (H-reflex) was carried out. The percentage of Hmax/Mmax was calculated from the electroneuro­myographic results. By the ratio between the maximum and minimum amplitude of the M-response, the number of motor units was calculated. To analyze the denervation-reinvational processes of motor units and degenerative-restorative changes in the muscle fibers, spontaneous fibrillation potentials and positive acute waves were recorded. By the stage of manifestation of pain myofascial syndrome, all patients were divided into three groups, in which the force characteristics decreased by 10. 2 %, 25. 0 % and 30. 2 %, respectively. It is well understood in clinic-instrumental research, that in 67. 3 % cases of multiple sclerosis the patient also suffers from functional scoliosis. This pathological symptom complex contributes to the creation of not only muscular, but also fascial-ligamental trigger points. They, in turn, are the source of the formation of <b>secondary</b> <b>trigger</b> loci. In terms of the degree of manifestation of subjective pain in the presence of myo-fascial syndrome, all patients were divided into three groups, and depending on the value of individual indicators, three stages of spontaneous fibrillation potentials were identified that clearly correlate with the degree of fibromyalgic syndrome and manifest specific electroneuromyographic disorders in each of these stages. The main pathogenetic mechanism that contributes to the formation of pathological bends of the spine in people with multiple sclerosis is a painful muscular-fascial syndrome. It is provoked by myofascial hypertonia and takes part in the development of cross syndromes, which is also manifested by clear changes in electroneuromyographic parameters in the form of asymmetric muscle tone. This article discusses clinical variants of the course of local muscular-tonic syndromes.

40|$|There {{is strong}} {{observational}} {{evidence that the}} 1999 MW 7. 1 Hector Mine earthquake in the Mojave Desert, California, was triggered by the nearby 1992 MW 7. 3 Landers earthquake. Many authors have proposed that the Landers earthquake directly stressed the Hector Mine fault. Our model of the Landers aftershock sequence, however, suggests there is an 85 % chance that the Hector Mine hypocenter was actually triggered by a chain of smaller earthquakes that was initiated by the Landers mainshock. We perform our model simulations using the Monte Carlo method based on the Gutenberg-Richter relationship, Omori's Law, Bth's Law, and assumptions that all earthquakes, including aftershocks, are capable of producing aftershocks, and that aftershocks produce their own aftershocks {{at the same rate}} that other earthquakes do.

40|$|ADAMTS 13 is an {{essential}} proteolytic enzyme that prevents spontaneous thrombus formation. When an injury {{takes place in a}} blood vessel, the exposed subendothelial collagen is able to attract von Willebrand factor (VWF) multimers. Adherence of this multimeric plasma glycoprotein to collagen induces thrombus formation by the recruitment and activation of platelets, which subsequently both limits blood loss and facilitates repair of the injury. This process is highly dependent on the conformation of VWF, which relies {{on the size of the}} multimers. VWF is constitutively expressed as dimers or small multimers by the endothelial cells. Stimulation (e. g. injury) however induces in the release of ultra-large (UL) VWF multimers, which are the most reactive in binding platelets, from the endothelial cells and megakaryocytes. Due to their size, UL-VWF multimers are most prone to flow-induced conformational changes, which expose their hidden platelet binding sites. In the absence of an injury, these UL-VWF multimers are highly dangerous as they are able to induce spontaneous microthrombus formation. Therefore, UL-VWF multimers are cleaved into smaller, less reactive multimers by ADAMTS 13. ADAMTS 13 is a multidomain metalloprotease consisting of a catalytic metalloprotease (M), a disintegrin-like (D), thrombospondin type- 1 repeat (T), cysteine-rich (C), spacer (S), seven additional T and two CUB domains. It is expressed as a constitutive active enzyme by mainly the hepatic stellate cells of the liver. Despite this constitutive activity, flow-dependent conformational changes in VWF also regulate proteolysis of VWF by ADAMTS 13. The intrinsic property of the folded VWF A 2 domain of hiding the ADAMTS 13 cleavage site consequently restricts proteolysis. Depending on the attachment and size of the VWF multimers and the shear rate, a threshold could be reached to unfold the A 2 domain, thereby allowing binding and cleavage by the catalytic amino(N) -terminal (proximal) MDTCS domains. The well-documented binding of MDTCS to the A 2 domain initiates at the spacer domain which recruits the remaining MDTC domains to bind like a molecular zipper to finally cleave VWF. Unraveling the complete mode-of-action of the carboxyl(C) -terminal (distal) T 2 to CUB 2 (T 2 to CUB 2) domains proved to be more challenging. Distal domains were shown to be important in docking of ADAMTS 13 on VWF (with a folded or unfolded A 2 domain) under flow conditions. Ambiguities between different studies did not only illustrate the limited knowledge on the role of the distal domains in ADAMTS 13 function, but did also indicate the existence of additional properties on top of docking onto VWF. Hence, we aimed at further elucidating this complex mode-of-action of the distal domains of ADAMT 13 using the strategy of antigen-specific antibody development (AIM 1). A deficiency in ADAMTS 13 due to autoantibody formation (acquired, ~ 95 % of all cases) or genetic mutations (congenital, ~ 5 % of all cases) leads to the life-threatening microangiopathic disease thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) due to the spontaneous development of VWF-rich microthrombi. TTP is often misdiagnosed and current therapies fail to help 10 to 20 % of all patients. In addition, ~ 30 to 40 % of the TTP patients encounter one or multiple relapses within 10 years after obtaining remission. Hence, in order to improve both treatment and patient care, novel treatment therapies are currently being developed. Suitable animal models are crucial in the further development and validation of novel treatment therapies before they are transferred to the patient level. For congenital TTP, small animal models (mice) have already been developed but still require further investigation. In this thesis, we focused on the availability of animal models for acquired TTP. Previously, our lab reported a large animal model for acquired TTP. Baboons (Papio ursinus) were injected with an inhibitory anti-metalloprotease domain antibody (3 H 9), resulting in the development of TTP symptoms (thrombocytopenia, anemia, presence of schistocytes [fragmented red blood cells], increased lactate dehydrogenase [LDH] activity). Despite the availability of this model and the physiological correlation with the early stages of the acute phase of the disease, this large animal model encounters certain technical (difficulty of high throughput screenings, difficult to handle and house, long gestation time, high maintenance cost …) and ethical limitations. Consequently, a small animal model (e. g. mouse) is required to facilitate both the development and validation of novel treatment strategies for acquired TTP (AIM 2). In this thesis, the powerful technique of antigen-specific antibody development was used to reach the objectives of both aims. A large pool of monoclonal antibodies was developed, directed against either the human ADAMTS 13 variant (hADAMTS 13) and the murine ADAMTS 13 variant (mADAMTS 13). The antibodies directed against hADAMTS 13 were used to further elucidate the interaction of the distal ADAMTS 13 domains with VWF and their functional role (AIM 1), while the antibodies directed against mADAMTS 13 were used to generate a novel mouse model of acquired TTP (AIM 2). The anti-hADAMTS 13 monoclonal antibodies proved to be crucial in the discovery of a new mechanism of ADAMTS 13 activity regulation and consequently in further elucidation of the complex mode-of-action of the distal domains (AIM 1). A large proportion of the antibodies directed against the distal domains of ADAMTS 13 individually increased the proteolytic activity of ADAMTS 13 up to two-fold under both static and shear conditions. Furthermore, a subset of the anti-T 2 -CUB 2 antibodies also increased the binding of ADAMTS 13 to folded VWF up to three-fold. Activation of the functionality of ADAMTS 13 was attributed to conformational changes in ADAMTS 13. We found that the flexible conformation of ADAMTS 13 (mainly annotated to flexible linker regions between the T 2 -CUB 2 domains) enables an interaction between the proximal MDTCS and the distal T 2 -CUB 2 domains. This interaction consequently shields the catalytic proximal domains and thereby negatively regulates the proteolytic activity of ADAMTS 13. Anti-T 2 -CUB 2 antibodies or docking of the distal domains onto VWF abrogates these interactions and allosterically activates ADAMTS 13. Supplemental to docking onto VWF under flow conditions, binding of the distal ADAMTS 13 domains to VWF also results in the formation of circulating ADAMTS 13 -VWF complexes. In this thesis, a specific ELISA that measures the binding capacity of ADAMTS 13 to folded VWF was used to screen the effect of all anti-T 2 -CUB 2 antibodies. This revealed a major role of the T 8 domain in this interaction. Remarkably, additional screening of the anti-MDTCS antibodies in this ELISA revealed specific antibodies inhibiting the interaction of ADAMTS 13 with folded VWF, indicating destabilization of the A 2 domain. The use of specific ADAMTS 13 variants (with mutations in the spacer domain) and VWF variants (with mutations in the A 2 domain) furthermore confirmed the mechanism of ADAMTS 13 -induced destabilization of the A 2 domain. Further in vitro analysis confirmed the crucial role of the distal domains but however indicated that this is a slow process. The anti-mADAMTS 13 monoclonal antibodies proved to be very valuable in the development of a novel small animal model (mouse) for acquired TTP (AIM 2). In vitro screening of the inhibitory effect of this large panel of anti-mADAMTS 13 monoclonal mouse antibodies revealed full inhibition of plasma mADAMTS 13 activity by combining two specific anti-MDTCS antibodies. The intravenous injection of both mouse antibodies achieved an acquired ADAMTS 13 deficiency for at least 7 days in wild type mice (WT, Adamts 13 +/+). In line with the human disease pattern and the congenital TTP mouse models, administration of a <b>secondary</b> <b>trigger</b> (recombinant human VWF [hVWF]) resulted in TTP symptoms (thrombocytopenia, elevated LDH activity …). This novel acquired TTP mouse model is very helpful in the validation of novel treatment therapies for acquired TTP. Regardless of the applicability of these inhibitory antibodies in the validation of novel treatment therapies, these antibodies are also carry great potential in the discovery of novel therapies for acquired TTP (e. g. plasmin) and determination of the role of ADAMTS 13 in other diseases like atherosclerosis, myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, preeclampsia and cerebral malaria. nrpages: 220 status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Hypertrophic {{cardiomyopathy}} (HCM) {{is characterized}} by gross cardiac and myocyte hypertrophy, myocyte disarray, and interstitial fibrosis. This condition is relatively common, with a prevalence of about 1 : 500 in the general population. Most patients with HCM are either asymptomatic or have only minimal symptoms. In general, HCM is a relatively benign disease with an annual mortality rate of slightly less than 1 % in unselected HCM populations [1, 2]. However, sudden cardiac death (SCD) {{may be the first}} manifestation of the disease. Approximately 60 % to 70 % of all patients with HCM die suddenly [3], and the fatal event is generally assumed, though not proven so far, due to ventricular arrhythmias. The high arrhythmic propensity in HCM is contributed by a combination of many primary substrate abnormalities like hypertrophy, myocardial fibre disarray, interstitial fibrosis etc, and possible <b>secondary</b> <b>triggers</b> like ischemia, physical exercise, and excessive sympathetic stimulation. Marked heterogeneity in substrate and triggers would substantially reduce the predictive accuracy of any risk stratification model as known to occur in patients with many other cardiac arrhythmic conditions. To compound this, heterogeneity in the studied population, low event rate, effect of drug therapy etc would also limit the application of any predictive model...|$|R
40|$|In this study, we {{aimed to}} {{establish}} the emission of UV photons when HPV-G cells and associated materials (such as the cell substrate and cell growth media) are exposed to low LET radiation. The potential role of UV photons in the <b>secondary</b> <b>triggering</b> of biological processes led us to hypothesize that the emission and absorption of photons at this wave-length explain some radiation induced “bystander effects ” that have previously been thought to be chemically mediated. Cells were plated in Petri-dishes of two different sizes, having different thicknesses of polystyrene (PS) substrate, and were exposed to β-radiation from 90 Y produced by the McMaster Nuclear Reactor. UV measurements were performed using a single photon counting system employing an interference-type filter for selection of a narrow wavelength range, 340 ± 5 nm, of photons. Exposure of the cell substrates (which were made of polystyrene) determined that UV photons were being emitted {{as a consequence of}} β particle irradiation of the Petri-dishes. For a tightly collimated β-parti-cle beam exposure, we observed 167 photons in the detector per unit µCi in the shielded source for a 1. 76 mm thick substrate and 158 photons/µCi for a 0. 878 mm thick substrate. A unit µCi source activity was equivalent to an exposure to the substrate of 18 β-parti...|$|R
40|$|In April 2015, a M 7. 8 {{earthquake}} occurred {{less than}} one month before a M 7. 3 earthquake near Kodari, Nepal. The Nepal earthquake sequences also include four larger (M > 6) aftershocks. To reveal the interrelation between the main shock and the aftershocks, we check the role of coseismic coulomb stress triggering on aftershocks that follow the M 7. 8 main shock. Based on the focal mechanisms of the aftershocks and source models of the main shock, the coulomb failure stress changes on both of the focal mechanism nodal planes are calculated. In addition, the coulomb stress changes on the focal sources of each aftershock are also calculated. A {{large proportion of the}} M > 6 aftershocks occurred in positive coulomb stress areas triggered by the M 7. 8 main shock. The <b>secondary</b> <b>triggering</b> effect of the M 7. 3 aftershock is also found in this paper. More specifically, the M 7. 3 aftershock promoted failure on the rupture plane of the M 6. 3 aftershock. Therefore, we may conclude that the majority of larger aftershocks, which accumulated positive coulomb stress changes during the sequence, were promoted or triggered by the main shock failure. It suggests that coulomb stress triggering contributed to the evolution of the Nepal M 7. 8 earthquake sequence...|$|R
