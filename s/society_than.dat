It has been credited with supporting successful and non-violent transitions to democracy in countries such as South Africa.|$|R
5|$|The medieval {{world was}} a much less urban <b>society</b> <b>than</b> either the Roman Empire or the modern world. The fall of the Roman Empire had caused a catastrophic de-population of the towns and cities that had existed within the Empire. Between the 10th and 12th centuries, however, {{a revival of the}} European city occurred, with an {{increase}} in the urbanisation of society.|$|E
5|$|Beth Hamedrash was the prototypical American synagogue {{for early}} {{immigrant}} Eastern European Jews, who began entering the United States {{in large numbers}} only in the 1870s. They found the synagogues of the German Jewish immigrants who preceded them to be unfamiliar, both religiously and culturally. Russian Jews in particular had been more excluded from Russian <b>society</b> <b>than</b> were German Jews from German society, for both linguistic and social reasons. Unlike German Jews, the Jews who founded Beth Hamedrash viewed both religion and the synagogue as central to their lives. They attempted to re-create in Beth Hamedrash the kind of synagogue they had belonged to in Europe.|$|E
5|$|The Erromintxela {{arrived in}} the Basque Country in the 15th century {{speaking}} Kalderash Romani. They integrated much more deeply into Basque <b>society</b> <b>than</b> other Romani groups. In the process, they acquired the Basque language and adopted aspects of Basque culture such as increased rights of women and important traditions such as bertsolaritza (extemporaneous poetic song) and pelota (the national Basque ballgame). Muñoz and Lopez de Mungia suspect that the morphological and phonological similarities between Romani and Basque facilitated the adoption of Basque grammar by the bilingual Romanis.|$|E

5|$|Marriages {{were often}} {{the subject of}} careful negotiations, {{particularly}} higher in society. Marriage lost its sacramental status at the Reformation and irregular marriage continued to be accepted as valid throughout the period. Women managed the household and might work beside their husbands and, although obedience to husbands was stressed, {{this may have been}} limited in practice. Divorce developed after the Reformation and was available for a wider range of causes and accessed by a much larger section of <b>society</b> <b>than</b> in England. Because of high mortality rates widowhood was a relatively common state, and some women acquired independence and status, but others were forced into a marginal existence and remarriage was common. The elaborate funerals and complex system of prayers for the dead that dominated in late Medieval Scotland were removed at the Reformation and simpler services adopted. Burial inside the church was discouraged. As a result separate aisles for the rich and graveyards with stone markers for the majority became common.|$|E

25|$|The German {{community}} {{proved more}} willing to integrate into Haitian <b>society</b> <b>than</b> any other group of white foreigners, including the French. A number married into the nation's most prominent mulatto families, bypassing the constitutional prohibition against foreign land-ownership.

25|$|The Rwandan kingdom was {{traditionally}} {{ruled by}} a Tutsi mwami, or king; Historical evidence suggests that Hutu and Twa were included in government, although the Twa significantly less so than Hutu, who were more numerous. The Tutsi/Hutu divide {{has been referred to}} as a caste system. A Hutu could gain Tutsi status through marriage or through success. Tutsis, being primarily pastoralists, had a more valuable place in Rwandan <b>society</b> <b>than</b> the agriculturalist Hutu, and the hunter-gatherer and potter Twa.|$|E
25|$|A Polabian prince {{was known}} as a knes.

He was the general leader of his tribe and was foremost among its nobles, holding much of the forested hinterland and expecting reverence from his warriors. However, his authority largely extended only to the territory controlled by his governor, or voivot. Each voivot governed small territories based around fortifications.|$|E

In addition, it is committed to the achievement of academic and linguistic excellence, creativity and all-round development of students. The courses offered in the School reflect these objectives and concerns.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} twentieth century, Irish society {{underwent}} rapid social change. After the introduction of free education in the late 1960s, many more people had access to second and third level qualifications. The relative economic success of the 1960s and 1970s also decreased emigration, meaning that Ireland became a younger and much more urban <b>society</b> <b>than</b> before. The spread of television and other mass media also exposed Irish citizens to a far wider range of influences than previously. All of these factors loosened {{the power of the}} traditional political parties and the Catholic Church over society.|$|E
