500|$|After {{graduating from}} Janesville High School in 1929, {{he took a}} job as a {{bookkeeper}} at a local bank. In 1932, his brother John, who had graduated from the University of Wisconsin–Madison with a degree in electrical engineering, persuaded him to go to college as well. John suggested that [...] "if you aren’t sure what part of science you want, take physics, because that's basic to all of them." [...] Creutz later recalled that this was the best advice he ever got. He entered the University of Wisconsin and studied mathematics and physics. Money was scarce during the Great Depression, especially after his father died in 1935. To pay his bills, Creutz worked as a dishwasher and <b>short</b> <b>order</b> <b>cook,</b> and took a job taking care of the physics laboratory equipment. In 1936, his senior year, he taught physics laboratory classes.|$|E

50|$|Laborers, or Shudra, are {{altogether}} {{different from the}} first three groups. Laborers lack the energy and vigor of the warriors, the keen intellect of the intellectuals, or the ambition and drive of the accumulators. In {{spite of the fact}} that their contribution to society is profound - in fact, society could not function without them - the other groups generally look down upon and tend to exploit them. The laborers are the peasants, serfs, clerks, <b>short</b> <b>order</b> <b>cooks,</b> waiters, janitors, doormen, cabdrivers, garbage collectors, truck drivers, night watchmen and factory workers who keep society running smoothly by working diligently and without complaint.|$|R

AuCoin attended Redmond High School, where he was elected most valuable player on the school's [...] basketball team. He also joined {{the staff of the}} school newspaper, where he discovered an aptitude for writing—a skill that would help propel him into journalism, Congress and, in political retirement, life as a writer. In 1960, he became the first male in his extended family to graduate from high school.|$|E
2500|$|The series {{revolves}} around Sookie Stackhouse (Anna Paquin), a telepathic human-faerie hybrid {{known as a}} halfling (not {{to be confused with}} similarly named, but unrelated creatures found in other fantasy works). Sookie is a waitress at Merlotte's Bar and Grill, owned by Sam Merlotte (Sam Trammell) in the small Louisiana town of Bon Temps. Sam is a shapeshifter, though this secret is kept hidden from most of the town. Other characters include Bill Compton (Stephen Moyer), a [...] 173-year-old vampire who has returned to Bon Temps to take up residence in his former home following the death of his last remaining relative; Tara Thornton (Rutina Wesley), Sookie's tough-talking but insecure best friend; Jason (Ryan Kwanten), Sookie's womanizing brother; Eric Northman (Alexander Skarsgård), a 1000-year-old vampire and Sheriff of Area 5; and Lafayette Reynolds (Nelsan Ellis), a <b>short</b> <b>order</b> <b>cook,</b> drug dealer, road crew member, and medium.|$|E

40|$|<b>Short</b> <b>order</b> <b>cooks</b> are {{restaurant}} {{workers who}} prepare food {{as it is}} ordered by customers. First-line supervisors also have to prepare food, {{but at the same}} time they must supervise the other workers who are cooking and preparing food. In contrast, food service managers are responsible for the daily operations of a restaurant including all administrative and human resource functions of the restaurant. In Erie County in 2008, the average weekly wage for a cook at a limited service restaurant (a restaurant that does not provide table waiting service), was $ 220 per week or $ 11, 449 annually. That was just 10 percent above the poverty line for a single person. Given that a single person who makes up to 125 percent of the poverty line is eligible for limited forms of public assistance, it is clear that it is very difficult to survive on this meager income...|$|R
