40|$|Graduation date: 1981 This study {{evaluated}} {{the recovery of}} compacted soils on logging skid trails in clearcuts of the western Cascade Mountains of Oregon. Soil types included clay, clay loam, silt loam, loam, sandy loam and loamy sands. Sites {{ranged in age from}} five to 38 years since harvest and 370 to llOOm in elevation. Soil bulk density, measured with a nuclear density probe, was used to characterize compacted soil conditions. A number of soil, vegetation and site variables were studied to determine possible cause and effect relationships with compaction recovery. Study design consisted of nine sites with nine plots at each site. Plots were classed by level of use with three plots in each of the low, medium and high use level classes. At each plot, measurements of bulk density were taken at the <b>skid</b> <b>trail</b> center, <b>skid</b> <b>trail</b> track and the less-disturbed area adjacent to the <b>skid</b> <b>trail.</b> Determination of vegetative cover was also made at these locations. Depths of measurement for bulk density were 5. 1 cm, 15. 2 cm and 30. 5 cm. No statistical difference of bulk density values was detected between <b>skid</b> <b>trail</b> use-level classes. A similar result was found for the vegetative cover variables. Bulk density values on the <b>skid</b> <b>trail</b> center and <b>skid</b> <b>trail</b> track were statistically similar. However, density on the <b>skid</b> <b>trail</b> track (and center) were greater than those of the less-disturbed area ([alpha]= 0. 05). When the data were stratified by site age, the <b>skid</b> <b>trail</b> track still retained greater bulk densities than the less-disturbed area on the 38 year old site. No trends in bulk density changes were observed over time. Interaction between herbaceous cover and overstory cover decreased the usefulness of these variables for correlation with recovery. However, shrubs indicated a reduction of percent cover on skid trails up to 21 years since harvest, but not after that time. This was the only variable measured which indicated possible <b>skid</b> <b>trail</b> recovery. Regression analysis was performed using the bulk density difference between the <b>skid</b> <b>trail</b> track and less-disturbed area as the dependent variable and several soil, site and vegetative variables as independents. Multicolinearity among the independent variables was high and when coupled with the variable nature of the bulk density data, produced inconsistent results...|$|E

Biodiversitas 15 : 240 - 244. Skidding operation {{has been reported}} {{as one of the}} factor to forest soil degradation and vegetation disturbance. Assessing tree regeneration by the effect of the <b>skid</b> <b>trail</b> from harvest operation is important to determine the recovery rate of the forest stand. A study was conducted to accomplish the following objectives, (i) to measure the tree regeneration rates at different distance from skid trails, and (ii) to evaluate the dominance and species diversity of regenerated trees. A total of five plots with size of 50 m by 2 m were established in two skid trails of natural forest that has been logged in 2012. Each plot contains five sub-plots of 2 m by 2 m in different locations namely skid track, edge and forest. The number of seedlings and saplings, species richness and diversity, and dominance regeneration were analyzed. Results showed that the number of species regeneration was not significantly different in both skid trails. For <b>skid</b> <b>trail</b> 1 the number of seedling and saplings was highest on <b>skid</b> <b>trail</b> tracks (mean species diversity = 0. 45). Meanwhile <b>skid</b> <b>trail</b> 2 showed the greatest species regeneration at edges (mean species diversity = 0. 65). Frequency value for Elateriospermum tapos was high due to the existence of mother tree in the area that provide a great number of seedlings. The dominance regeneration in both skid trails originated from non-dipterocarp families. There were 42 non-dipterocarp seedling and saplings in <b>skid</b> <b>trail</b> 1, and 182 in <b>skid</b> <b>trail</b> 2.

Therefore, the objective of this research was to compare the rate of soil organic carbon between two areas inside and outside of the skid trails based on its depth. In order to carrying out of field survey, two samples from inside (for different depth of 0 - 5 and 5 - 10 centimeters) and two samples from outside of each 20 meters of <b>skid</b> <b>trail</b> were taken (Totally 80 soil sample). The rate of organic carbon was determined with burning through black&walking method. Results show that in all stations the percentage of organic carbon in soil samples collected from outside of trails was more than that of soil samples collected from inside of <b>skid</b> <b>trail.</b> Result of statistical analysis show that the skidding causes to significant difference between the two treatments for percentage of organic carbon (inside and outside of <b>skid</b> <b>trail)</b> in different depth of soil (P< 0. 05). Moreover, changes in percentage of soil organic carbon in samples measured for inside of <b>skid</b> <b>trail</b> was high and for outside of <b>skid</b> <b>trail</b> was low. The mean of soil organic carbon in layer of 0 - 5 centimeter was more than that of the layer of 5 - 10 centimeter. But, this difference is not significant (P< 0. 05). In order to decrease damage to forest soil it is better that the <b>skid</b> <b>trail</b> is covered by vegetation foliage and wood debris.

40|$|Significant erosion {{occurred}} from recently constructed forest logging {{roads and}} <b>skid</b> <b>trails</b> {{in a small}} headwater catchment in Peninsular Malaysia. Soil loss was estimated by measuring dimensions of all significant rills and gullies along the road, {{as well as by}} measuring height of preserved soil pedestals in sidecast and fill material and on <b>skid</b> <b>trails.</b> Estimates of surface erosion from logging roads and <b>skid</b> <b>trails</b> were 272 ± 20 t ha-+ year-+ and 275 ± 20 t ha-+ year-+ respectively. However, owing to lack of connectivity of <b>skid</b> <b>trails</b> to the stream, much of the sediment mobilized on <b>skid</b> <b>trails</b> was stored either on adjacent hillslopes or the trails themselves, rather than being transported to the stream system, as was the case for the road. Steeper <b>skid</b> <b>trails</b> (> 20 % gradient) had slightly higher erosion rates (320 ± 24 t ha-+ year-+ than trails with gentler gradients (245 - 264 t ha-+ year-+). Some 60 % of the soil loss on logging roads comes from erosion of the running surface. Disturbed cut and fill material along the road supplied the remaining 40 % of the soil loss from roads. Roads and <b>skid</b> <b>trails</b> had no designed drainage systems; runoff discharged onto the hillslope at 25 major discharge nodes from the logging road (690 m total length) and at 34 nodes from <b>skid</b> <b>trails</b> (2300 m). Sediment pathways were either fully or moderately connected to headwater channels at 64 % of the logging road nodes, but at only 26 % of the nodes emanating from <b>skid</b> <b>trails.</b> A detailed sediment budget revealed that 78 % of the soil loss from the road system (including log landings) was delivered to the stream in the first 16 months after logging began. Most (90 %) of the deposition from <b>skid</b> <b>trails</b> occurred below just three discharge nodes. Runoff from and onto <b>skid</b> <b>trails</b> often exacerbated the sediment connectivity to channels. Clearly, sediment discharge from logging roads was more highly connected to the stream than discharge from <b>skid</b> <b>trails.</b> Once in the channel, much of this sediment was temporarily stored in the floodplain and behind woody debris. © 2004 John Wiley and Sons, Ltd...|$|R

In {{the course of}} developing timberland, a network of persistent roads and <b>skid</b> <b>trails</b> causing soil compaction is usually established. Hereby, the infiltration rate of the soil is distinctly reduced, {{which leads to the}} generation of overland flow—this may also cause soil erosion. In this study, a small-scale rainfall simulator is used to investigate hydrological and erosional processes on forest roads and <b>skid</b> <b>trails.</b> The results show increased runoff rates on forest roads, up to 25 times higher than on undisturbed forest topsoil. On <b>skid</b> <b>trails,</b> the runoff rates were altered especially in rutted areas (16 times higher) while unrutted parts showed a lesser change (four times higher). With sufficient overland flow, soil erosion rates also rose, particularly when the vegetation cover of the surface was removed: bare road surfaces featured higher mean erosion rates (195 g·m− 2) than partly or completely vegetated <b>skid</b> <b>trails</b> (13 g·m− 2) and undisturbed sites (5 g·m− 2).

At a fine scale, no studies have yet compared the influence of micro-environmental factors {{and the effects of}} <b>skid</b> <b>trail</b> disturbance on ground flora diversity. We investigated understory diversity patterns on skid trails in 30 -, 50 - and 63 -year-old oak forests in the northern half of France. Subplots were placed on <b>skid</b> <b>trail</b> center, wheel track, <b>skid</b> <b>trail</b> edge plus an off-trail control. At each subplot, we measured soil moisture, soil compaction (penetration resistance and bulk density) and photosynthetic active radiation and recorded the abundance of all vascular plants. The richness and abundance of ground flora were calculated based on the classification of their life form, seed bank persistence, light preference and moisture requirements. For each ecological group, we found out its best diversity indicator from subplot location, micro-environmental factors (soil moisture and compaction, light) and stand attributes (stand type, basal area), then assessed the magnitude and negligibility of the effect of the best indicator. (1) Higher soil compaction compared to controls was detected on the tracks of skid trails in the 50 - and 63 -year-old stands. Neither soil moisture nor light varied with subplot location whatever the stand type. (2) The best diversity indicator that showed non-negligible effects included subplot location, and soil moisture or soil compaction. Compared to controls, skid trails in the 50 - and 63 -year-old stands were richer in tree and short-term seed bank species, while skid trails in the 30 -year-old plots had no effect on ground flora. The abundance of tree and shade-tolerant species was also higher on skid trails. Soil moisture was positively correlated with the richness of low- and high-humidity species, shade-tolerant species and transient seed bank species {{as well as with the}} abundance of short-term seed bank species. Bulk density positively affected heliophilous species richness, while penetration resistance was positively related to shrub abundance.

40|$|Ground-based logging {{typically}} produces well-defined <b>skid</b> <b>trails</b> on {{the forest}} floor during log extraction. With conventional logging, these <b>skid</b> <b>trails</b> cover from 18 to 36 percent of the soil surface after a single harvest entry (Dyrness 1965; Froehlich 1976). Subsequent entries can increase the area in <b>skid</b> <b>trails</b> to as much as 80 percent of the soil surface. The soil in the <b>skid</b> <b>trails</b> is almost always compacted. Increases in soil density during skidding generally range from 10 to 80 percent (Foil and Ralston 1967; Froehlich 1979), depending on soil strength, moisture content, organic matter, and machine variables such as ground pressure and vibration. Logging over frozen ground or a heavy cover of snow or slash can moderate or eliminate soil compaction (Froehlich 1978). In most areas, however, timber harvesting cannot always be scheduled to take advantage of those protective conditions; thus, soil compaction usually accompanies log skidding. Soil compaction alters soil structure to a condition usually less favorable to plant growth. The increase in soil density is accompanied by a decrease in pore space, which in turn reduces air exchange, water infiltration, and permeability. The increase in soil density also produces an increase In soil strength, which retards tree root extension. Soil compaction reduces the height growth of seedlings of several coniferous species by 10 to 50 percent (Foil and Ralston 1967; Froehlich 1979). Stem volume may be affected more severely than height growth. In a study with 16 -year-old ponderosa pine, - soil compaction decreased height growth by 29 percent and stem growth by 68 percent (Froehlich 1979). Similarly, soil compaction reduced height growth of 26 -year-old loblolly pine by 13 percent and stem volume growth by 53 percent (Perry 1964). The growth reduction of individual trees apparently is related to the amount of root zone compacted and the percentage of Increase in soil density (Froehlich 1979; Perry 1964). Therefore, the impact of <b>skid</b> <b>trails</b> on tree growth in a given tract will depend on the amount of area in <b>skid</b> <b>trails</b> or the number of trees affected and on the relative increase in soil density in the <b>skid</b> <b>trails.</b> Some forest managers have turned to skyline or even helicopter logging as a means of reducing site impacts from timber harvesting. These systems spare the soil but are at least twice as expensive as ground skidding with logging vehicles on gently sloping terrain (Aulerich et al. 1974). One method of retaining the economic advantages of ground skidding while reducing the impacts of soil compaction might be an efficiently planned system of <b>skid</b> <b>trails</b> covering {{only a small portion of}} the total harvested area.

The effects of logging and the effectiveness of riparian buffers appear to depend on the hydrologic connections between hillslopes and headwater streams. © 2005 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|International audienceAbstract Key messageSkidding {{operations}} significantly influenced soil {{physical properties}} up to a 2 -m {{distance from the}} wheel ruts in a forest ecosystem. The most significant changes in soil properties were identified within a 0. 5  m to 1  m transitional zone. AimsThe main purpose {{of this investigation was}} to determine how far into a forest stand changes in soil physical properties were evident due to skidding operations. MethodsTreatment plots with three replications included combinations of four distance zones at 0. 5  m intervals (0 to 2  m in distance) on both sides of <b>skid</b> <b>trail</b> edges to the forest, three slope gradient levels were applied (gentle 20  %) and two levels of traffic intensities 20 and 40 passes (with a rubber-tyred skidder, model HSM 904). A total of 576 soil samples were used in this study. ResultsResults showed that the physical properties of soil were significantly changed by each traffic intensity in the first distance zone, where the slope was > 20  % compared to soil changes at a slope of 20  % after 20 and 40 skidding cycles.

40|$|The {{effects of}} traffic {{frequency}} and <b>skid</b> <b>trail</b> slope on dry bulk density, litter mass and rutting are examined. Treatments included {{a combination of}} four different traffic frequencies (3, 7, 14, and 20 passes of a rubber skidder) and three levels of slope ( 20 %.) The results showed that dry bulk density, rut depth and soil displacement increased {{with the increase of}} traffic frequency and slope, but floor coverage decreased. Within each traffic treatment soil compaction raised with the increase of <b>skid</b> <b>trail</b> slope, so that significant differences in dry bulk density were observed between slope of 20 %. Bulk density has become quite close to the critical value after 14 cycles. With increase of the skidder cycles from 14 to 20, bulk density remained approximately constant. We observed soil displacement on the treatments with 7 cycles: rutting on the treatments started with 7 cycles and slope of> 20 %. Soil disturbance increased significantly on slopes with> 20 % inclination with a dry bulk density of 1100 kg m- 3 after 3 cycles compared to 830 kg m- 3 on slopes 20 % (437. 6 kg/ha) was significantly (p 20 % may be associated with increasing load on the rear axle combined with slipping on steep slope trail...|$|E
40|$|Different {{types of}} shelterwood system and group {{selection}} forests were studied {{to discover the}} extent of damage caused by logging. Motor-manual cutting and mainly tractor skidding were included. Sampling transects were used to estimate the damage to young forest and remaining stands. The whole research area was regenerated on average 31 %, of which 21 % was damaged. We found a higher density of designated and undesignated <b>skid</b> <b>trails</b> on larger regeneration areas. Damage to young forest and damage to remaining productive stands were compared. In this respect the whole rotation period was divided into three time intervals, {{the first of which}} designated a mixed pattern of young forest area and younger phases prior to commercial thinning, in which the last of the old mature trees are removed. The second phase is a mix of currently productive stands and some young forest, in which the first and second commercial thinnings begin, until the final stage, in which young forest becomes increasingly abundant and perspective. In the last period, damage to productive stands is high (around 70 %), since they have accumulated over a long time period. The fact that better forest stand opening with <b>skid</b> <b>trails</b> means less damage to young forest, but slightly more damage to mature stands suggests the conclusion that the abundance and position of young forest patches should dictate the density and position of <b>skid</b> <b>trails...</b>|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1998 Soil {{bulk density}} and {{disturbance}} were measured {{before and after}} a commercial thinning of 3 0 - 50 year-old Douglas-fir using a cut-to-length (CTL) and a skyline system on the Willamette National Forest in the Oregon Cascades. A dual-probe nuclear densimeter {{was used to measure}} bulk density at four and eight inches. Slash depth after thinning and disturbance category were determined at bulk density measurement points in all units. Data were analyzed using paired t-tests, Tukey-Kramer multiple comparison tests, and multiple linear regression. Data were collected in two CTL units pre-thinning but one unit post-harvester and post-thinning (after both harvester and forwarder). During the sampling period thinning was completed only in the northeast corner of one unit (approximately 25 acres) before operations were ended due to concerns about soil moisture conditions and damage to hauling roads. Thus post-harvester and post-thinning data and conclusions apply only to that portion of the CTL units. In this harvested portion, slopes ranged from 0 - 10 percent and equipment traffic levels were estimated to range from three passes at the end of <b>skid</b> <b>trails,</b> to 30 passes on secondary trails and well over 40 passes on primary trails. These values are considered characteristic of most of Unit 82 except for areas near streams with steeper slopes. Plot centers were located using an incomplete, offset grid system. A sub-sample of bulk densities in old <b>skid</b> <b>trails</b> was also taken. The effects of harvester-only and the combined effect of harvester-forwarder traffic on the bulk density of old <b>skid</b> <b>trails</b> and previously undisturbed soils was assessed. In the three skyline units, bulk density was measured in the center, edge and halfway between skyline roads both before and after thinning. In addition, detailed maps of soil disturbance were created from transects located both directly on top of and halfway between a sub-sample of skyline roads within each unit. From the randomly located plots in the CTL units, it was determined that old <b>skid</b> <b>trails</b> covered approximately 27 and 13...|$|R

40|$|In {{the ground}} based logging {{operation}} construction of skid trails are need to transport logs from felling areas to road side landings. In this research plant species recovery rate and natural tree regeneration on the skid trails with different time of construction (1980, 1990, 2000 and 2010) were investigated in the Hyrcanian forests of Iran. Plant recovery rate including coverage, height, diversity and species importance value were measured and noted on each <b>skid</b> <b>trail</b> by systematic sample plots and {{were analyzed by}} ANOVA and Duncan test. Results showed plant coverage, number of species and plant height on the skid trails were increased by increasing of skid trails construction ages. After 10 years from logging operation only 2 species of tree regeneration (Alnus subcordata and Acer velutinum) were established on the skid trails. Also, after 30 years from <b>skid</b> <b>trail</b> construction and logging operation only 7 species of tree regeneration were established on the skid trails that were seedling and small sapling stages. Sambacus ebulus had the most species importance value on the skid trails with 1 and 10 years old, whereas, on the skid trails with 20 and 30 years old Rubus caesus had the most species importance value.

40|$|Graduation date: 1982 Implements for tilling {{compacted}} {{forest soils}} were tested on sites logged with ground-based machines in Oregon. The sites covered {{a variety of}} soil conditions ranging from a clay loam to a rock 7 2 C 2 iplemeflts tested included disk harrows (four aies), brusa blades (three sites), standard subsoiler tines (two sites), wing. - ed subsoiler tines (two sites), and rock ripper tines (five sites). Soil density and strength measurements made prior to the tillage operatIons indicated that the depth of compacted soil within primary skid trails exceeded 12 inches and was often detectable {{to a depth of}} 18 inches. Logging debris typically was incorporated into the <b>skid</b> <b>trail</b> surfaces. The disk harrow proved ineffective for loosening compacted forest soils at depth when: 1) the soil had a high rock content, 2) disk weighting was insufficient, or 3) the trail cross-section was concave and the harrow wide. The brush blade failed to loosen the deeper layers of compaction and resulted in transfer of some of the loosened soil to the trail edges. The short closely-spaced tines did not allow loosened soil and logging debris to pass between the tines. The performance of subsoiler and rock ripper tines was favorable in the rocky coarse-grained soils and some of the cohesive soils. However, plastic flow rather than shatterin. g occurred when tines operated below their crit- [...] ical depth. The critical depth was controlled by soil conditions and tue geometry. The winged subsoiler tines resulted in 30 to 64 percent greater shattering than did standard subsoiler tines at a ripping depth of 1. 5 feet. Close tine spacing caused logging debris to accumulate in front of the tines. The tines produced large angular clods when working in a cohesive soil. These clods did not break down after heavy rains. Clods from coarse-grain soils broke down readily when moistened. A trapezoid-shaped representatjoii of the soil sbattering pattern produced by tines was shown to compare adequately with actual shattering patterns. A computer program was developed to analyze ripping depth and tine spacing combinations resulting in maximum shattering across the <b>skid</b> <b>trail</b> width. The cost of the tillage operations ranged from 89 to 228 per mile of <b>skid</b> <b>trail</b> (1980 - 1981 dollars) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{results of}} {{measuring}} maximum loads on different slopes when skidding uphill with WOO DY 110 cable skidder and adapted 4 WD agricultural tractor AGT 835 {{are described in}} the article. Both tractors are very different and were chosen {{for the purpose of}} finding the limits of uphill skidding. Besides the slope, the pre-designated loads of different sizes and log orientation (butt-end or top-end forward) have been main variables. The trial was conducted on two concave shaped test <b>skid</b> <b>trails</b> in the forest. On the lower altitudes, the <b>skid</b> <b>trails</b> had small inclination, which slowly increased to 42 % on the track where WOODY 110 was tested, and 27 % where AGT 835 was measured. First the loads were skidded uphill with butt-end and then with top-end forward. The purpose was to choose too heavy loads, as we wished to stop tractors due to overload, but on different slopes. The proper load formation (butt-end forward if possible) in uphill skidding is most important on steeper <b>skid</b> <b>trails.</b> The dependency between maximum load and slope is linear. The calculated theoretical maximum load on horizontal surface enables us to make similar assessment for any other tractor weighing between 2 and 7 tons. For this purpose, John Deere 6220 and LIMB 80 LUXS adapted agricultural tractors for forest use were chosen and compared. The ratio between the tractor load on different slopes and tractor weight was calculated for all four tractors included in our comparison. Apart from the weight, tractor's engine torque (power) has the decisive influence on the load size. Maximum loads on different slope categories were calculated according to different engine powers...|$|R
