5|$|The {{first known}} {{telescopic}} observation {{of a total}} solar eclipse was made in France in 1706. Nine years later, English astronomer Edmund Halley accurately predicted and observed the solar eclipse of May 3, 1715. By the mid-19th century, scientific understanding of the Sun was improving through observations of the Sun's corona during solar eclipses. The corona was identified {{as part of the}} Sun's atmosphere in 1842, and the first photograph (or daguerreotype) of a total eclipse was taken of the solar eclipse of July 28, 1851. <b>Spectroscope</b> observations were made of the solar eclipse of August 18, 1868, which helped to determine the chemical composition of the Sun.|$|E
25|$|Later {{on in his}} life, in 1862, Faraday used a <b>spectroscope</b> {{to search}} for a {{different}} alteration of light, the change of spectral lines by an applied magnetic field.

Pieter Zeeman later used an improved apparatus to study the same phenomenon, publishing his results in 1897 and receiving the 1902 Nobel Prize in Physics for his success. In both his 1897 paper and his Nobel acceptance speech, Zeeman made reference to Faraday's work.|$|E
25|$|The {{refractive}} index (as measured by sodium light, 589.3nm) of turquoise is approximately 1.61 or 1.62; {{this is a}} mean value seen as a single reading on a gemmological refractometer, owing to the almost invariably polycrystalline nature of turquoise. A reading of 1.61–1.65 (birefringence 0.040, biaxial positive) has been taken from rare single crystals. An absorption spectrum may also be obtained with a hand-held <b>spectroscope,</b> revealing a line at 432nm and a weak band at 460nm (this is best seen with strong reflected light).

25|$|Indium is {{the fourth}} element of the boron group but was {{discovered}} before the third, gallium, and after the fifth, thallium. In 1863 Ferdinand Reich and his assistant, Hieronymous Theodor Richter, were looking {{in a sample of}} the mineral zinc blende, also known as sphalerite (ZnS), for the spectroscopic lines of the newly discovered element thallium. Reich heated the ore in a coil of platinum metal and observed the lines that appeared in a <b>spectroscope.</b> Instead of the green thallium lines that he expected, he saw a new line of deep indigo-blue. Concluding that it must come from a new element, they named it after the characteristic indigo color it had produced.|$|E

25|$|The common {{fluorescent}} lamp relies on fluorescence. Inside the glass tube is a partial vacuum {{and a small}} amount of mercury. An electric discharge in the tube causes the mercury atoms to emit mostly ultraviolet light. The tube is lined with a coating of a fluorescent material, called the phosphor, which absorbs the ultraviolet and re-emits visible light. Fluorescent lighting is more energy-efficient than incandescent lighting elements. However, the uneven spectrum of traditional {{fluorescent lamp}}s may cause certain colors to appear different than when illuminated by incandescent light or daylight. The mercury vapor emission spectrum is dominated by a short-wave UV line at 254nm (which provides most of the energy to the phosphors), accompanied by visible light emission at 436nm (blue), 546nm (green) and 579nm (yellow-orange). These three lines can be observed superimposed on the white continuum using a hand <b>spectroscope,</b> for light emitted by the usual white fluorescent tubes. These same visible lines, accompanied by the emission lines of trivalent europium and trivalent terbium, and further accompanied by the emission continuum of divalent europium in the blue region, comprise the more discontinuous light emission of the modern trichromatic phosphor systems used in many compact fluorescent lamp and traditional lamps where better color rendition is a goal.|$|E

25|$|In {{the first}} {{extraction}} of radium Curie used the residues after extraction of uranium from pitchblende. The uranium had been extracted by dissolution in sulfuric acid leaving radium sulfate, {{which is similar}} to barium sulfate but even less soluble in the residues. The residues also contained rather substantial amounts of barium sulfate which thus acted as a carrier for the radium sulfate. The first steps of the radium extraction process involved boiling with sodium hydroxide followed by hydrochloric acid treatment to remove as much as possible of other compounds. The remaining residue was then treated with sodium carbonate to convert the barium sulfate into barium carbonate carrying the radium, thus making it soluble in hydrochloric acid. After dissolution the barium and radium are reprecipitated as sulfates and this was repeated one or few times, for further purification of the mixed sulfate. Some impurities, that form insoluble sulfides, were removed by treating the chloride solution with hydrogen sulfide followed by filtering. When the mixed sulfate were pure enough they were once more converted to mixed chloride and barium and radium were separated by fractional crystallisation while monitoring the progress using a <b>spectroscope</b> (radium gives characteristic red lines in contrast to the green barium lines), and the electroscope.|$|E

40|$|Conventional Fourier {{transform}} IR (FTIR) <b>spectroscopes</b> {{cannot be}} used to perform real time in situ IR reflection absorption spectroscopy at monolayer sensitivity for high deposition rates (a couple of tens to hundreds of nm/s) which can be obtained when using an expanding thermal deposition plasma. Therefore a new anal. tool has been developed. The tool {{is based on a}} fast optical scanner in combination with conventional grating technol. This results in a loss of spectral range with respect to FTIR <b>spectroscopes,</b> but a significant gain is obtained in time resoln. For the combination used this makes it possible to measure at time resoln. as low as 1. 3 ms and resoln. of 24 cm- 1 at 1000 cm- 1. The absorption sensitivity for single reflection at the best time resoln. is approx. 10 - 2, but can be improved by using signal enhancement techniques. Here attenuated total reflection is used and the best sensitivity obtained is approx. 10 - 3, which is close to monolayer sensitivity for various absorption bands in the IR spectrum of silicon oxide films. Monolayer sensitivity can be obtained by averaging multiple spectra, however this will cause the time resoln. to decreas...|$|R

500|$|Rubidium {{is a minor}} {{component}} in lepidolite. Kirchhoff and Bunsen processed 150kg of a lepidolite containing only 0.24% rubidium oxide (Rb2O). Both potassium and rubidium form insoluble salts with chloroplatinic acid, but those salts show a slight difference in solubility in hot water. Therefore, the less-soluble rubidium hexachloroplatinate (Rb2PtCl6) could be obtained by fractional crystallization. After reduction of the hexachloroplatinate with hydrogen, the process yielded 0.51grams of rubidium chloride for further studies. Bunsen and Kirchhoff began their first large-scale isolation of caesium and rubidium compounds with [...] of mineral water, which yielded 7.3grams of caesium chloride and 9.2grams of rubidium chloride.
