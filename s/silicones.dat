40|$|Purpose: To {{conduct an}} in vitro {{experimental}} study comparing {{the effectiveness of}} conventional <b>silicone</b> oil and heavy <b>silicone</b> oil against endophthalmitis-causing agents. Materials and Methods: The antimicrobial activity of conventional <b>silicone</b> oil (RS OIL 5000) and heavy <b>silicone</b> oil (heavySil 1500) was tested. The antimicrobial effects of both <b>silicone</b> oils were determined by the growing capability of the microorganism.

50|$|<b>Silicone</b> {{has many}} {{applications}} like <b>silicone</b> oil used to replace vitreous following vitrectomy, <b>silicone</b> intraocular lenses following cataract extraction, <b>silicone</b> tubes to keep nasolacrimal passage open following dacrycystorhinostomy, canalicular stents for canalicular stenosis, punctal plugs for punctal occlusion in dry eyes, <b>silicone</b> rubber and bands as an external tamponade in tractional retinal detachment, and anteriorly located break in rhegmatogenous retinal detachment.|$|R
30|$|<b>Silicone</b> {{implants}} {{were introduced}} in the 1960 s with {{the theory that the}} barrier shell would reduce the complications of direct <b>silicone</b> injection. Unfortunately, the shells used in these early implants were semi-porous and allowed small amounts of <b>silicone</b> gel to “bleed” without implant rupture. These early implants were also prone to rupture with increasing age, and when they rupture result in large amounts of extracapsular <b>silicone</b> [7]. The complications of this free <b>silicone</b> were indistinguishable from those of direct <b>silicone</b> injection [8].|$|R
50|$|Chemically, <b>silicone</b> rubber is {{a family}} of {{thermoset}} elastomers that have a backbone of alternating silicon and oxygen atoms and methyl or vinyl side groups. <b>Silicone</b> rubbers constitute about 30% of the <b>silicone</b> family, making them {{the largest group of}} that family. <b>Silicone</b> rubbers maintain their mechanical properties over a wide range of temperatures and the presence of methyl-groups in <b>silicone</b> rubbers makes these materials extremely hydrophobic.|$|R
25|$|In 1992-1993, {{remedial}} maintenance on the Tarot Garden sculptures was performed, using new glues and <b>silicones</b> to attach mirrors and glass elements more securely, to withstand weathering and {{the touch of}} many visitors' hands. , a similar restoration process of re-attaching mirrors is ongoing with Le Cyclop, located in Milly-la-Forêt, near Paris.|$|E
25|$|<b>Silicones</b> may be {{considered}} analogous to mineral silicates, in which the methyl groups of the <b>silicones</b> correspond to the isoelectronic O− of the silicates. They are quite stable to extreme temperatures, oxidation, and water, and have useful dielectric, antistick, and antifoam properties. Furthermore, they are resistant {{over long periods of}} time to ultraviolet radiation and weathering, and are inert physiologically. They are fairly unreactive, but do react with concentrated solutions bearing the hydroxide ion and fluorinating agents, and occasionally can be even used as mild reagents for selective syntheses. For example, (Me3Si)2O is valuable for the preparation of derivatives of molybdenum and tungsten oxyhalides, converting a tungsten hexachloride suspension in dichloroethane solution quantitatively to WOCl4 in under an hour at room temperature, and then to yellow WO2Cl2 at 100°C in light petroleum at a yield of 95% overnight.|$|E
25|$|As {{can be seen}} in the monomer table, many simple {{monomers}} {{are readily}} polymerized by this method, but most must be smaller ionizable species because they have to be able to go into the plasma state.

25|$|As many {{as eight}} {{immiscible}} liquid phases have been observed. Mutually immiscible liquid phases are formed from water (aqueous phase), hydrophobic organic solvents, perfluorocarbons (fluorous phase), <b>silicones,</b> several different metals, and also from molten phosphorus. Not all organic solvents are completely miscible, e.g. a mixture of ethylene glycol and toluene may separate into two distinct organic phases.|$|E
25|$|<b>Silicones</b> {{are often}} used in {{waterproofing}} treatments, molding compounds, mold-release agents, mechanical seals, high temperature greases and waxes, and caulking compounds. Silicone is also sometimes used in breast implants, contact lenses, explosives and pyrotechnics. Silly Putty was originally made by adding boric acid to silicone oil. Other silicon compounds function as high-technology abrasives and new high-strength ceramics based upon silicon carbide. Silicon is a component of some superalloys.|$|E
25|$|Most commonly, the {{continuously}} linked {{backbone of}} a polymer {{used for the}} preparation of plastics consists mainly of carbon atoms. A simple example is polyethylene ('polythene' in British English), whose repeating unit is based on ethylene monomer. However, other structures do exist; for example, elements such as silicon form familiar materials such as <b>silicones,</b> examples being Silly Putty and waterproof plumbing sealant. Oxygen is also commonly present in polymer backbones, {{such as those of}} polyethylene glycol, polysaccharides (in glycosidic bonds), and DNA (in phosphodiester bonds).|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES—The use of <b>silicone</b> {{implants}} in cosmetic and {{reconstructive surgery}} has {{been implicated in}} the development of autoimmune connective tissue diseases. Previous investigation of the influence of short-term <b>silicone</b> implantation using an experimental model of rheumatoid arthritis revealed no adverse influence upon disease despite the generation of autoantibodies against <b>silicone</b> bound proteins. This study was designed to examine the influence of long term implantation of different forms of <b>silicone</b> in collagen induced arthritis.  METHODS—DBA/ 1 mice were surgically implanted with <b>silicone</b> elastomers, gel or oil nine months before immunisation with type II collagen emulsified in Freund's incomplete adjuvant. The incidence and severity of arthritis, antibodies to type II collagen, and serum cytokines were assessed and compared with sham implanted mice. <b>Silicone</b> implants were recovered, and autoantibodies to <b>silicone</b> bound proteins evaluated in arthritic and non-arthritic mice.  RESULTS—Immunisation with CII/FIA resulted in a 30 % arthritis incidence in sham implanted DBA/ 1 mice. Long term <b>silicone</b> implantation resulted in an increased incidence of arthritis, with a significant increase of 90 % arthritis in animals implanted with <b>silicone</b> elastomers. Animals implanted with <b>silicone</b> elastomer also developed foreign body sarcomas during the study. Serum concentrations of interleukin 10  were increased in mice implanted with elastomers and immunised with CII/FIA, while interleukin 5  concentrations were significantly diminished in these mice. The production of autoantibodies to autologous <b>silicone</b> bound proteins, including anti-type I collagen antibody, was also attributed to the implantation of either <b>silicone</b> gel or <b>silicone</b> elastomer in type II collagen immunised animals.  CONCLUSIONS—These data suggest that long term <b>silicone</b> implantation results in both the production of autoantibodies to connective tissue antigens and increased susceptibility to an experimental model of autoimmune disease. ...|$|R

25|$|In 1998, <b>silicone</b> hydrogels became available. These {{materials}} have both the extremely high oxygen permeability of <b>silicone</b> and the comfort and clinical {{performance of the}} conventional hydrogels. Because <b>silicone</b> allows more oxygen permeability than water, oxygen permeability of <b>silicone</b> hydrogels is not tied to the lenses' water content.

25|$|In 1988, {{twenty-six years}} after the 1962 {{introduction}} of breast implants filled with silicone gel, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) investigated breast implant failures and the subsequent complications, and re-classified breast implant devices as Class III medical devices, and required from manufacturers the documentary data substantiating the safety and efficacy of their breast implant devices. In 1992, the FDA placed silicone-gel breast implants in moratorium in the U.S., because there was “inadequate information to demonstrate that breast implants were safe and effective”. Nonetheless, medical access to silicone-gel breast implant devices continued for clinical studies of post-mastectomy breast reconstruction, the correction of congenital deformities, and the replacement of ruptured silicone-gel implants. The FDA required from the manufacturers the clinical trial data, and permitted their providing breast implants to the breast augmentation patients for the statistical studies required by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. In mid–1992, the FDA approved an adjunct study protocol for silicone-gel filled implants for breast reconstruction patients, and for revision-surgery patients. Also in 1992, the Dow Corning Corporation, a silicone products and breast implant manufacturer, announced the discontinuation of five implant-grade <b>silicones,</b> but would continue producing 45 other, medical-grade, silicone materials—three years later, in 1995, the Dow Corning Corporation went bankrupt when it faced 19,000 breast implant sickness lawsuits.|$|E
500|$|A general {{consensus}} is that privity is distinct from consideration.

Supporters of this view concede that while privity and consideration are distinct doctrines, {{there is a strong}} relationship between the two.

This is a prospective observational case series of 22 pediatric patients with recurred ptosis after frontalis suspension using <b>silicone</b> rods for congenital ptosis.
