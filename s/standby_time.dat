5000|$|Power {{requirements}} are typically low, which translates to extended talk and <b>standby</b> <b>times</b> (approximately {{a month to}} next recharge). In some cases this makes it possible not to use grid power at all, by recharging through more autonomous means, such as cars and car batteries, solar photo-voltaic cells, or notebook computers, if a phone supports USB charging.|$|R
25|$|The iPhone 5C {{retains the}} 8nbsp&MP back camera {{similar to the}} iPhone 5 but with a {{different}} camera assembly. The front camera, which is accessible through the FaceTime and camera app has a lower resolution, at 1.2 megapixels. The rechargeable lithium-ion battery with a charge capacity of 1510mAh is slightly improved upon iPhone 5's 1440mAh battery. It is integrated and cannot {{be replaced by the}} user. It is rated at ≤225nbsp&hours of <b>standby</b> <b>time</b> and ≤8nbsp&hours of talk time.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to user inputs, the device also has several sensors {{that give the}} phone information about its orientation and external conditions. These include a three-axis gyroscope, an accelerometer, a proximity sensor, and an ambient light sensor. The [...] is stated to have 200hours <b>standby</b> <b>time,</b> 8hours talk time on 3G, 14hours talk time on 2G, 6hours 3G browsing, and 9hours Wi-Fi browsing. Additionally, it can sustain up to 10hours of video playback or 40hours of audio playback.|$|E
500|$|The [...] uses {{a system}} on chip (SoC), called the Apple A6. The SoC {{comprises}} a 1.3GHz dual-core processor, 1GB of RAM and a tri-core PowerVR SGX543MP4 running at 266MHz. The 's operating memory (LPDDR2-1066 eDRAM) was doubled, from 512 MB to 1 GB.

40|$|The {{presence}} of ubiquitous electronics in wearable devices {{carried by the}} user is rapidly growing, and the complexity of these devices seems to know no limits. However, {{one of the most}} important challenges on this topic is to ensure a power supply beyond the constraints associated with batteries. A solution to this problem is the development of devices capable of harvesting energy from a user's environment or body to allow unlimited operating and <b>standby</b> <b>times.</b> Either kinetic, light, electromagnetic, or thermal energy can be transformed into electrical energy. This chapter presents different energy harvesting transducers and their physical principles, as well as the power management circuits required...|$|R
5000|$|Batteries {{should always}} be {{recharged}} in the recharger and not within the mobile phone. Recharging in the mobile takes longer and the <b>standby</b> <b>time</b> will be halved. The short <b>standby</b> <b>time</b> and recharging error {{may be caused by}} faulty firmware or a faulty 3G network. In addition the battery time can be increased by turning off the GPS and vibra call alert, and by turning down the backlight of the display. Testing has revealed that using the phone in 2G network will provide 3-4 times the <b>standby</b> <b>time</b> than using it in 3G networks.|$|E

40|$|Cell phone {{manufacturers}} are increasingly pressed to provide status LEDs that can alert users to messages waiting, impending calendar appointments, and other notifications while {{the phone is}} in standby; indeed, several recent handset releases have received negative reviews for not having a notification LED. At the same time, users are demanding longer <b>standby</b> <b>times</b> from their phones. This pair of seemingly simple issues presents a surprisingly difficult dilemma to manufacturers: how can they power notification LEDs while keeping total standby consumption low? Indicator LEDs are typically powered from a power-management IC (PMIC) or other small processor. This is satisfactory when the phone is awake, but the processor must {{keep track of the}} timing to automatically enable and disable each LED, even in sleep mode. Powering the entire PMIC for this function can add several milliamperes to the standby current draw. Table 1 provides an example of data and calculations showing that the average power consumption is dominated by the off-time quiescent current drain...|$|R

40|$|There is an ever - {{increasing}} {{demand for more}} powerful, compact and longer - life power modules for portable electronic devices for leisure, communication and computing. Micro fuel cells {{have the potential to}} replace battery packs for portable electronic appliances because of their high power density, longer operating and <b>standby</b> <b>times,</b> and substantially shorter recharging times. However, fuel cells have stringent operating requirements, including no fuel leakage, water formed in the electrochemical reactions, heat dissipation, robustness, easy and safe use, and reliability. Due to the large market potential, several companies are currently involved in the development of micro fuel cells. For application of fuel cells as a battery charger or in a battery replacement market, the cells require simplification in terms of their construction and operation and must have volumetric power densities equivalent to or better than those of existing battery power packs. This paper discusses results of investigation on methods and materials for direct hydrogen micro fuel cells as well as the lifetime performance of single cells and 2 We arrays. The paper also reviews the global technology development status for the direct hydrogen micro fuel cell and compares its salient features with other types of micro fuel cells...|$|R
