5|$|A temulent bee is {{more likely}} to stick out its tongue, or proboscis. Inebriated bees spend more time flying. If a bee is {{sufficiently}} intoxicated, it will just lie on its back and wiggle its legs. Inebriated bees typically have many more flying accidents as well. Some bees that consume ethanol become too inebriated to find their way back to the hive, and will die as a result. Bozic et al. (2006) found that alcohol consumption by honeybees disrupts foraging and <b>social</b> <b>behaviors,</b> and has some similar effects to poisoning with insecticides. Some bees become more aggressive after consuming alcohol.|$|E
5|$|Ants (family Formicidae in {{the order}} Hymenoptera) are the most species-rich of all social insects, with more than 12,000 {{described}} species and many others awaiting description. Formicidae is divided into 21 subfamilies, of which 17 contain extant taxa, while four are exclusively fossil. Ants have come to occupy virtually all major terrestrial habitats, {{with the exception of}} tundra and cold ever-wet forests. They display a wide range of <b>social</b> <b>behaviors,</b> foraging habits and associations with other organisms, which has generated scientific and public interest.|$|E

5|$|Off Enewetak, grey reef sharks exhibit {{different}} <b>social</b> <b>behaviors</b> {{on different}} parts of the reef. Sharks tend to be solitary on shallower reefs and pinnacles. Near reef drop-offs, loose aggregations of five to 20 sharks form in the morning and grow in number throughout the day before dispersing at night. In level areas, sharks form polarized schools (all swimming in the same direction) of around 30 individuals near the sea bottom, arranging themselves parallel to each other or slowly swimming in circles. Most individuals within polarized schools are females, and the formation of these schools has been theorized to relate to mating or pupping.|$|E
5|$|Principal {{evidence}} of this theory is uncovered by examining Twin pregnancies. The main argument is, if there are <b>social</b> <b>behaviors</b> that are inherited and developed before birth, then one should expect twin foetuses to engage {{in some form of}} social interaction before they are born. Thus, ten foetuses were analyzed {{over a period of time}} using ultrasound techniques. Using kinematic analysis, the results of the experiment were that the twin foetuses would interact with each other for longer periods and more often as the pregnancies went on. Researchers were able to conclude that the performance of movements between the co-twins were not accidental but specifically aimed.|$|E
5|$|The Sunda slow loris may {{fit into}} the monogamous single male/single female social system, though are mainly known to be solitary. One study showed only 8% of the species' active time was spent near other individuals. Where home ranges overlap, spatial groups are formed. These groups consist of one male, one female and up to three younger individuals. The {{interactions}} between these individuals are largely friendly; they include allogrooming, following, pant-growling, and click-calling, although <b>social</b> <b>behaviors</b> only make up around 3% of the activity budget. When it comes into contact with conspecifics from other home ranges there is usually no reaction as home ranges are not defended. In captivity however, it can be aggressive with other individuals. Males have shown antagonistic behaviors such as attacks, pursuits, threats, assertion, fighting, and subordination. The fighting often results in serious injury. Despite this, they {{are known to be}} generally sociable in captivity, with allogrooming being the most common social behavior.|$|E
50|$|Human <b>social</b> <b>behavior</b> is an {{extensively}} studied topic involving many {{academic disciplines}} {{in the social}} sciences.

40|$|A <b>social</b> <b>behavior</b> {{analysis}} {{is used to}} study how {{a group of people}} interacts with another group. The analysis helps to understand how <b>social</b> <b>behavior</b> leads to its consequences such as what business decision is made after a businessmen's meeting. In this paper, we focus on visual human motion analysis which is one important component of <b>social</b> <b>behavior</b> analysis. Human motion analysis in visual surveillance usually tracks the motion of an individual or a group of people, yet <b>social</b> <b>behavior</b> is usually neglected. This paper first delivers a literature survey of visual surveillance, with emphasis on aspects of human motion analysis and <b>social</b> <b>behavior.</b> Second, it offers a perspective for <b>social</b> <b>behavior</b> analysis in an intelligent visual human monitoring system. Third, a social interaction is induced by a <b>social</b> <b>behavior</b> between two persons, one person and one group, or two groups, hence three general scenarios of social interactions are outlined for future theoretical development. The proposed human monitoring system enables the generation of valuable quantified information of social interactions. It provides an objective approach to evaluate performance of a human organization such as a company or a school. Finally, it can raise the awareness of researchers to further explore the field of <b>social</b> <b>behavior</b> analysis. Comment: 7 pages, 5 figure...|$|R
5|$|The term {{attachment}} {{disorder is}} used to describe emotional and behavioral problems of young children, and also applied to school-age children, teenagers and adults. The specific difficulties implied depend on {{the age of the}} individual being assessed, and a child's attachment-related behaviors may be very different with one familiar adult than with another, suggesting that the disorder is within the relationship and interactions of the two people rather than an aspect of one or the other personality. No list of symptoms can legitimately be presented but generally the term attachment disorder refers to the absence or distortion of age appropriate <b>social</b> <b>behaviors</b> with adults. For example, in a toddler, attachment-disordered behavior could include a failure to stay near familiar adults in a strange environment or to be comforted by contact with a familiar person, whereas in a six-year-old attachment-disordered behavior might involve excessive friendliness and inappropriate approaches to strangers.|$|E
5|$|Human {{activity}} {{once again}} threatened the amazon {{during the following}} years. In 2012, {{it was reported that}} the unsanctioned flight of light aircraft from adjacent islands was disrupting the reproductive and <b>social</b> <b>behaviors</b> of the species. Via Verde, a gas pipeline grid proposed by the Luis Fortuño administration, raised concerns among conservationists due to further deforestation of the regions where the birds feed. New conservation efforts have also begun during this timeframe. In 2011, a research team of the University of Puerto Rico at Mayagüez sequenced the amazon's genome. On August 15, 2013, the discovery of non-assisted nests in the Río Abajo State Forest was announced. Experts considered this a sign of expansion, impliying that the reintroduced amazon population was fully adapting to wild life and was dispersing throughout the region. This was noted as a significant advance, since El Yunque is not an ideal habitat for the bird due to its humidity, which precipitates sickness in some of the individuals. This was accompanied by a second announcement, which noted that added to the known number of amazons in the wild (fluctuating between 64 and 112 specimens) there is an unmonitored population of approximately 50 birds dispersed throughout Puerto Rico.|$|E

40|$|What {{genes and}} {{regulatory}} sequences {{contribute to the}} organization and functioning of neural circuits and molecular pathways in the brain that support <b>social</b> <b>behavior?</b> How does <b>social</b> experience interact with information in the genome to modulate brain activity? Here, we address these questions by highlighting progress {{that has been made}} in identifying and understanding two key “vectors of influence ” that link genes, the brain, and social behavior: (i) Social information alters gene expression in the brain to influence behavior, and (ii) genetic variation influences brain function and <b>social</b> <b>behavior.</b> We also discuss how evolutionary changes in genomic elements influence <b>social</b> <b>behavior</b> and outline prospects for a systems biology of <b>social</b> <b>behavior.</b> Genes and <b>social</b> <b>behavior</b> have long had atempestuous relationship in both scienceand society, and the “nature-versus-nurture” debate still has its adherents.

40|$|<b>Social</b> <b>behavior</b> {{represents}} {{an integral part}} of behavioral repertoire of rats particularly sensitive to pharmacological and environmental influences. The aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate whether early postnatal clonazepam (CZP) exposure can induce age-dependent changes related to expression of <b>social</b> <b>behavior.</b> The drug was administered from postnatal day (P) 7 until P 11 at daily doses of 0. 1, 0. 5 and 1. 0 mg/kg i. p. We designed three experiments to assess whether exposure to CZP affects <b>social</b> <b>behavior</b> in respect to the age of rats and the test circumstances, specifically their familiarity with test conditions during adolescence (P 32), <b>social</b> <b>behavior</b> in juveniles and adolescents (P 18 -P 42) and <b>social</b> <b>behavior</b> in a resident-intruder paradigm. The frequency and duration of a various patterns of <b>social</b> <b>behavior</b> related to play and social investigation not related to play were evaluated. The results showed that CZP postnatal exposure decreased <b>social</b> play <b>behavior</b> regardless of age and familiarity or unfamiliarity of experimental environment but did not affect the social investigation per se. When rats were confronted with an intruder in their home cages intense wrestling and inhibition of genital investigation were found. In conclusion, these findings show that short-term CZP postnatal exposure inhibits <b>social</b> play <b>behavior</b> and alters specific patterns of <b>social</b> <b>behavior</b> in an age and environment related manne...|$|R

A meta-study of over 330 subjects showed music therapy produces highly significant improvements to <b>social</b> <b>behaviors,</b> overt behaviors like wandering and restlessness, reductions in agitated behaviors, and improvements to cognitive defects, measured with reality orientation and face recognition tests. As with many studies of MT's effectiveness, these positive effects on Alzheimer's and other dementias are not homogeneous among all studies.

25|$|The {{hormonal}} neuropeptides vasopressin and oxytocin play a {{key role}} in complex social behaviours in many mammals such as regulating attachment, social recognition, and aggression.

Adult males in established heterosexual pairs were injected daily with the selective 5 -HT 1 A agonist 8 -OH-DPAT or saline for 15 days using a within-subjects design. <b>Social</b> <b>behavior</b> with the female pair-mate was quantified, and plasma concentrations of oxytocin, vasopressin, and cortisol were measured.
