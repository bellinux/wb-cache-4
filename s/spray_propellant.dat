They also occur as by-products of some chemical processes. No significant natural sources have ever been identified for these compounds—their presence in the atmosphere is due almost entirely to human manufacture. As mentioned above, when such ozone-depleting chemicals reach the stratosphere, they are dissociated by ultraviolet light to release chlorine atoms. The chlorine atoms act as a catalyst, and each can break down {{tens of thousands of}} ozone molecules before being removed from the stratosphere. Given the longevity of CFC molecules, recovery times are measured in decades. It is calculated that a CFC molecule takes an average of about five to seven years to go from the ground level up to the upper atmosphere, and it can stay there for about a century, destroying up to one hundred thousand ozone molecules during that time..|$|R

40|$|The <b>propellant</b> <b>spray</b> {{resulting}} from the impingement of liquid jets of hydrazine and nitrogen tetroxide has been studied at atmospheric pressure by means of streak photography.

Below a minimum threshold contact time, popping did not take place. At high values of contact time, the popping rate was controlled by the transit time of the free jet before impingement.

40|$|Exposure {{assessment}} for nano-objects, and their aggregates and agglomerates (NOAA), {{has evolved from}} explorative research toward more comprehensive exposure assessment, providing data to further develop currently used conservative control banding (CB) tools for risk assessment. This study aims to {{provide an overview of}} current knowledge on emission potential of NOAA across the occupational life cycle stages by a systematic review and subsequently use the results in a data analysis. Relevant parameters that influence emission were collected from peer-reviewed literature with a focus on the four source domains (SD) in the source-receptor conceptual framework for NOAA. To make the reviewed exposure data comparable, we applied an approach to normalize for workplace circumstances and measurement location, resulting in comparable "surrogate" emission levels. Finally, descriptive statistics were performed. During the synthesis of nanoparticles (SD 1), mechanical reduction and gas phase synthesis resulted in the highest emission compared to wet chemistry and chemical vapor condensation. For the handling and transfer of bulk manufactured nanomaterial powders (SD 2) the emission could be differentiated for five activity classes: (1) harvesting; (2) dumping; (3); mixing; (4) cleaning of a reactor; and (5) transferring. Additionally, SD 2 was subdivided by the handled amount with cleaning further subdivided by energy level. Harvesting and dumping resulted in the highest emissions. Regarding processes with liquids (SD 3 b), it was possible to distinguish emissions for <b>spraying</b> (<b>propellant</b> gas, (high) pressure and pump), sonication and brushing/rolling. The highest emissions observed in SD 3 b were for <b>propellant</b> gas <b>spraying</b> and pressure spraying. The highest emissions for the handling of nano-articles (SD 4) were found to nano-sized particles (including NOAA) for grinding.

CFC- 12 is a synthetic chlorofluorocarbon manufactured during the mid-late 20 th century {{for use as a}} refrigerant and an aerosol <b>spray</b> <b>propellant.</b> Its atmospheric history is well established with agreement among instrumental time series measurements and industry-reported production data [Walker et al., 2000], the distribution of dissolved CFC- 12 in the oceans [e. g. Weiss et al., 1985], and firn air measurements [Butler et al., 1999]. The atmospheric history indicates that there was no measureable CFC- 12 in the atmosphere prior to the 1940 ’s. The firn air CFC- 12 profiles are consistent with the known atmospheric history of this gas. In contrast, the air in ice core samples collected near the close-off depth exhibit anomalously high CFC- 12 levels. We propose that this is due to entrapment of modern air in open pores that close after drilling, resulting in elevated CFC- 12 mixing ratios. These results demonstrate how the composition of air trapped in shallow ice cores can be altered during the post-drilling period through purely physical processes. Comparison of firn air and ice core bubble composition is one of the commonly used tools for studying the bubble close-off process. The post-drilling entrapment process detected in this study represents a potential complication for such investigations...|$|E

Worldwide around 20 billion devices are manufactured annually and the UK has a major share of this market, manufacturing 5 billion units, {{second only to the}} USA. Led by the Californian Air Resources Board (CARB) in 2001, there is mounting pressure for the use of liquefied gas propellants (volatile organic compounds) in aerosol cans to be banned. This paper addresses the challenges of creating a fine spray using a pressurized inert gas (non-VOC) as the propellant for household aerosols. The spray produced has to achieve a relative performance to that of a traditional fine <b>spray</b> VOC <b>propellant</b> aerosol with regard to droplet size, reach, cone angle, and flow rate. The findings of this work have demonstrated that to achieve a sub- 50 -µm (Dv, 50) spray is extremely challenging when using compressed inert gas and single fluid alone. However, by bleeding air into the insert arrangement, a spray of 24 µm (Dv, 50) can be obtained and this is comparable in droplet size to that produced by a traditional fine spray VOC aerosol...|$|R
40|$|A {{computational}} method {{for the analysis}} of longitudinal-mode liquid rocket combustion instability has been developed based on the unsteady, quasi-one-dimensional Euler equations where the combustion process source terms were introduced through the incorporation of a two-zone, linearized representation: (1) A two-parameter collapsed combustion zone at the injector face, and (2) a two-parameter distributed combustion zone based on a Lagrangian treatment of the <b>propellant</b> <b>spray.</b> The unsteady Euler equations in inhomogeneous form retain full hyperbolicity and are integrated implicitly in time using second-order, high-resolution, characteristic-based, flux-differencing spatial discretization with Roe-averaging of the Jacobian matrix. This method was initially validated against an analytical solution for nonreacting, isentropic duct acoustics with specified admittances at the inflow and outflow boundaries. For small amplitude perturbations, numerical predictions for the amplification coefficient and oscillation period were found to compare favorably with predictions from linearized small-disturbance theory as long as the grid exceeded a critical density (100 nodes/wavelength). The numerical methodology was then exercised on a generic combustor configuration using both collapsed and distributed combustion zone models with a short nozzle admittance approximation for the outflow boundary.

The aerosol <b>spray</b> uses a <b>propellant</b> and {{fragrance}} packaged under pressure {{in a sealed}} metal or glass container with a valve which is opened by pressing down a button which contains a spray nozzle - the actuator. When the container's valve is opened by pressing the actuator, fragrance is forced through the spray nozzle located inside the actuator to create a mist of droplets containing fragrance. These droplets are 30 to 50 micrometres in diameter. The atomizer is a glass, metal or plastic container of fragrance which operates {{in a similar fashion}} except that the actuator is a pump which when pressed a few times creates the pressure to aspirate the fragrance from the container through a tube into the actuator and spray nozzle. The mist created contains droplets 50 to 150 micrometres in diameter. A recently developed type of aerosol packages a plastic bag of fragrance into a can. The bag is attached to the valve/actuator/spray nozzle and sealed in the can surrounded by air under pressure.

This mechanism involves transient development of two-phase flashing propellant flow inside pMDI actuator as well as transfer of heat, mass and momentum between the liquid and vapour phase. Variations in the rate of such interphase phenomena dictate the two-phase mass flow rate emission, which itself determines spray velocity and droplet size. In this work we compare the performance of existing two-phase flow models to predict the flow conditions and the rate of propellant flow through a pMDI actuator: the homogeneous equilibrium model (HEM), the slip equilibrium model (SEM) and the homogeneous frozen model (HFM).
