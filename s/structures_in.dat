5|$|All the <b>structures</b> <b>in</b> Old Yosemite Village, {{except for}} the chapel, were either moved to the Pioneer Yosemite History center in Wawona or {{demolished}} during the 1950s and 1960s.

Cedar Cottage, the oldest building in Yosemite Valley, was demolished in 1941 along with others, {{even though they had}} not been flooded. Little regard was given to historic preservation, as the priority was thought to be the preservation and restoration of natural scenery.|$|E
