To assure a stable supply of qualified foreign seafarers, this study aims to research and select a foreign seafarer <b>supply</b> <b>country</b> for Korean Flag vessels. Factors influencing the selection were identified, and these factors were assessed by Delphi, fuzzy, and fuzzy TOPSIS methods in order to make a selection from several countries. Via empirical analysis by the fuzzy method, the results show that the factor of “total crew costs” is the most significant, followed by “quality of seafarers’ education and training” and “supply ability for well-trained seafarers. ” “government support from supply countries” is the least weighted factor for decision makers. The alternative countries assessment by fuzzy TOPSIS method suggests that the Philippines should be chosen as the dedicated foreign seafarer <b>supply</b> <b>country</b> for Korean Flag vessels, given the analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of these alternative foreign seafarer <b>supply</b> <b>countries.</b> Finally, some implications for continuous improvement of the seafarer <b>supply</b> <b>countries</b> are provided...|$|R

However, in many commodity markets there are also a limited number of large <b>supplying</b> <b>countries.</b> This paper considers a situation where an oligopsonistic intermediary industry purchases from a small number of <b>supplying</b> <b>countries,</b> the governments of which act strategically in their policy choices both with respect to the intermediaries and any competing suppliers.

5000|$|Soccer is [...] {{the most}} popular sport in the world, and is {{the most popular}} sport in the {{majority}} of Latino countries. The World Cup is arguably the most prolific tournament for a single sport in the world combining soccer players from around the globe to compete for the chance to call their home country champions. Since 1930, there has been a competition every four years to see which country is the best at soccer (excluding 1942 and 1946 due to World War II). The first world cup actually took place in a Latino <b>country,</b> <b>Uruguay.</b> This involved thirteen teams including eight countries from South and Central America, so {{more than half of the}} tournament involved Latin American <b>countries.</b> <b>Uruguay</b> ended up winning the world cup that year and in 1950. The only other Latin American country to win the world cup is Argentina, who was victorious in 1978 and 1986. Having mentioned that, only seven countries in the world have actually won the world cup, so Latino countries have put forth more than their fair share of representation. Latino countries that have hosted the event besides Uruguay are Chile in 1962 and Mexico in 1970 and 1986. It is evident that the world cup is the sport's greatest stage, and Latino countries have had a great impact on its history and growth.|$|R

40|$|Commodity markets may be {{characterized}} by concentration on the buyer side, with {{a small number of}} transnational intermediary firms purchasing from <b>supplying</b> <b>countries</b> and distributing to the market. In many cases, developing economies may have little choice but to sell through these intermediaries, and recent work has suggested the export taxes may be an optimal policy to recapture some of the monopsony rent. However, in many commodity markets there are a limited number of large <b>supplying</b> <b>countries.</b> Even if the markets are competitive, this supply-side concentration suggests that economies have market power themselves, and that the governments of the countries may be engaged in a strategic game when selecting trade policies. We consider a situation where an oligopsonistic intermediary industry purchases from a small number of <b>supplying</b> <b>countries,</b> the governments of which act strategically in their policy choices both with respect to the intermediaries and any competing suppliers. In the resulting two-stage game, we show that an export subsidy may arise as the optimal intervention. Strategic export subsidies, export taxes, global commodity markets...|$|R
