40|$|The first 325 Exeter <b>Universal</b> <b>stems</b> (309 patients) {{implanted}} at the {{originating centre}} were inserted between March 1988 and February 1990 {{by a group}} of surgeons with differing experience. In this report we describe the clinical and radiological results at a mean of 15. 7 years (14. 7 to 17. 3) after operation with no loss to follow-up. There were 97 patients (108 hips) with replacements still in situ and 31 (31 hips) who had undergone a further procedure. With an endpoint of revision for aseptic loosening, the survivorship at 17 years was 100 % and 90. 4 % for the femoral and acetabular component, respectively. The mean Merle D’Aubigné and Postel scores at review were 5. 4 (SD 0. 97) for pain and 4. 5 (SD 1. 72) for function. The mean Oxford score was 38. 4 (SD 9. 8) (0 to 48 worst-to-best scale) and the mean combined Harris pain and function score was 73. 2 (SD 16. 9).

Epidermal SPs have the smallest cell and nuclear size but exhibit the highest nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio of any fraction examined, consistent with a primitive cell type.

Here, we propose that the combined use of transcriptional profiling and genetic linkage analysis, an approach called "genetical genomics", can be a valuable tool to assist in the identification of genes and gene networks that specify "stemness" and cell fate decisions.

40|$|We {{reviewed}} 142 consecutive primary total hip replacements implanted into 123 patients between 1988 and 1993 {{using the}} Exeter <b>Universal</b> femoral <b>stem.</b> A total of 74 patients (88 hips) had survived {{for ten years}} or more and were reviewed at a mean of 12. 7 years (10 to 17). There was no loss to follow-up. The rate of revision of the femoral component for aseptic loosening and osteolysis was 1. 1 % (1 stem), that for revision for any cause was 2. 2 % (2 stems), and for re-operation for any cause was 21. 6 % (19 hips). Re-operation was because of failure of the acetabular component in all but two hips. All but one femoral component subsided within the cement mantle to a mean of 1. 52 mm (0 to 8. 3) at the final follow-up. One further stem had subsided excessively (8 mm) and had lucent lines at the cement-stem and cement-bone interfaces. This was classified as a radiological failure and is awaiting revision. One stem was revised for deep infection and one for excessive peri-articular osteolysis. Defects of the cement mantle (Barrack grade C and D) were found in 28 % of stems (25 hips), associated with increased subsidence (p = 0. 01), but were not associated with endosteal lysis or failure. Peri-articular osteolysis {{was significantly related to}} the degree of polyethylene wear (p &# 60; 0. 001), which was in turn associated with a younger age (p = 0. 01) and male gender (p &# 60; 0. 001). The use of the Exeter metal-backed acetabular component was a notable failure with 12 of 32 hips (37. 5 %) revised for loosening. The Harris-Galante components failed with excessive wear, osteolysis and dislocation with 15 % revised (5 of 33 hips).

40|$|We {{consider}} the random lasing from a weakly scattering medium and {{demonstrate that the}} distribution of the threshold gain over the ensemble of statistically independent finite-size samples is <b>universal.</b> Universality <b>stems</b> from the facts that: (i) lasing threshold in a given sample is determined by the highest-quality mode of all the random resonators present in the sample, and (ii) the areal density of the random resonators decays sharply with the quality factor of the mode that they trap. We find analytically the shape of the universal distribution function of the lasing threshold. The shape of this function is governed by a single dimensionless parameter, β. This parameter increases as a power law with S, where S is the sample area (length, volume), and decreases as a power law with disorder strength.

We {{present a}} scaling {{approach}} {{to investigate the}} kinetics of the diffusion-controlled multiparticle reactions A, + A, + [...] . + AN + inert, and NA + inert, for a random initial distribution of particles. For the first reaction, if the initial densities of all the particle species are equal, the particle density decays with time r as t [...] , where a =id, and d is the spatial dimension. This exponentevalue is independent of N below an upper critical dimension of d, = 4 / (N- I), while for d z d,, a assumes the mean-field value of I/ (N- 1). For the decay NA + inert, (I =id, again independent of N, for d < d, = 2 / (N- 1).

The goal of our study was to generate a <b>universal</b> pluripotent <b>stem</b> cell source by nucleofecting a mutated human leukocyte antigen G (mHLA-G) gene into hESCs using the PiggyBac transposon. We successfully generated stable mHLA-G(EF 1 α) -hESC lines using chEF 1 α promoter system that stably expressed mHLA-G protein during prolonged undifferentiated proliferation andin differentiated embryoid bodies as well as teratomas. Morphology, karyotype, and telomerase activity of mHLA-G expressing hESC were normal. Immunofluorescence staining and flow cytometry analysis revealed persistent expression of pluripotent markers, OCT- 3 / 4 and SSEA- 4, in undifferentiated mHLA-G(EF 1 α) -hESC. Nucleofected hESC formed teratomas and when directed to differentiate into epidermal precursors, expressed high levels of mHLA-G and keratinocyte markers K 14 and CD 29. Natural killer cell cytotoxicity assays demonstrated {{a significant decrease in}} lysis of mHLA-G(EF 1 a) -hESC targets relative to control cells.

Although there was an attempt by the Dutch delegate Father De Beaufort OP to amend the pream¬ble with a reference to “Man's divine origin and his eternal des¬tiny,” this was rejected as being contrary to the universal nature of the declaration. For the Saudi Arabian delegate, the fact that the declaration began and ended with the human being, without any reference to God, was sufficient reason to abstain. Indeed, Father Beaufort's formula would have been rather out of place.

Among {{various types of}} stem cells, adult stem cells (i. e., tissue-specific stem cells) commit to becoming the functional cells from their tissue of origin.

The goal of this review is to summarize {{the current state of the}} art and advances in using stem cell therapy for tissue repair in solid organs. Here we address key factors in cell preparation, such as the source of adult stem cells, optimal cell types for implantation (<b>universal</b> mesenchymal <b>stem</b> cells vs. tissue-specific stem cells, or induced vs. non-induced stem cells), early or late passages of stem cells, stem cells with endogenous or exogenous growth factors, preconditioning of stem cells (hypoxia, growth factors, or conditioned medium), using various controlled release systems to deliver growth factors with hydrogels or microspheres to provide apposite interactions of stem cells and their niche. We also review several approaches of cell delivery that affect the outcomes of cell therapy, including the appropriate routes of cell administration (systemic, intravenous, or intraperitoneal vs. local administration), timing for cell therapy (immediate vs. a few days after injury), single injection of a large number of cells vs. multiple smaller injections, a single site for injection vs. multiple sites and use of rodents vs. larger animal models.

40|$|AbstractTumor {{heterogeneity}} of high-grade glioma (HGG) is recognized by four clinically relevant subtypes based on core gene signatures. However, molecular signaling in glioma stem cells (GSCs) in individual HGG subtypes is poorly characterized. Previously we identified and characterized two mutually exclusive GSC subtypes with distinct activated signaling pathways and biological phenotypes. One GSC subtype {{presented with a}} gene signature resembling Proneural (PN) HGG, whereas the other was similar to mesenchymal (Mes) HGG. Classical HGG-derived GSCs were sub-classified as either {{one of these two}} subtypes. Differential mRNA expression analysis of PN and Mes GSCs identified 5796 differentially expressed genes, revealing a pronounced correlation with the corresponding PN or Mes HGGs. Mes GSCs displayed more aggressive phenotypes in vitro and as intracranial xenografts in mice. Further, Mes GSCs were markedly resistant to radiation compared with PN GSCs. Expression of ALDH 1 A 3 — one of the most up-regulated Mes representative genes and a <b>universal</b> cancer <b>stem</b> cell marker in non-brain cancers — was associated with self-renewal and a multi-potent stem cell population in Mes but not PN samples. Moreover, inhibition of ALDH 1 A 3 attenuated the growth of Mes but not PN GSCs in vitro. Lastly, radiation treatment of PN GSCs up-regulated Mes-associated markers and down-regulated PN-associated markers, whereas inhibition of ALDH 1 A 3 attenuated an irradiation-induced gain of Mes identity in PN GSCs in vitro. Taken together, our data suggest that two subtypes of GSCs, harboring distinct metabolic signaling pathways, represent intertumoral glioma heterogeneity and highlight previously unidentified roles of ALDH 1 A 3 -associated signaling that promotes aberrant proliferation of Mes HGGs and GSCs. Inhibition of ALDH 1 A 3 -mediated pathways therefore might provide a promising therapeutic approach for a subset of HGGs with the Mes signature.

Recently, differential phase contrast (DPC) imaging has been utilized to map the internal electric and magnetic fields in materials from nanoscale features such as p–n junctions, skyrmions, and even from individual atoms. Here, we use an ultra-low noise SCMOS detector in as the diffraction plane camera to collect four-dimensional (4 D) datasets. The high angular resolution, efficient high-SNR acquisition, and modifiability of the camera allow it to function as a <b>universal</b> detector, where <b>STEM</b> imaging configurations, such as DPC, bright field, annular bright field, and annular dark field can all be reconstructed from a single 4 D dataset.

In addition, the perovskite has ordered O-coordinations with alternating octahedral tilts, which can be quantitatively measured with single degree accuracy by taking advantage of DPC’s sensitivity to light atoms. The results, acquired on a standard Ronchigram camera as opposed to a specialized DPC detector, open up new opportunities to understand and design functional materials and devices that involve lattice and charge coupling at nano- and atomic-scales.|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} applies one branch of linguistics, namely pragmatics, {{to the study}} of translation. It {{analyzes}} pragmatic elements, namely (i) presupposition, (ii) implicature and (iii) deixis, in Emily Brontë’s Wuthering Heights (1847) and three Arabic translations to identify the nature of shifts in these elements and their conditioning factors. The study adopts a descriptive approach (Toury 2012) that will contribute to research into the determining features of English-Arabic literary translation and ultimately to research into translation norms or universals. The features studied are manually identified and then analyzed through different qualitative and quantitative research methods. The analysis reveals several trends, most importantly, a tendency: (i) to claim lesser shared knowledge with readers, (ii) to avoid the flouting of conversational maxims and hence to enhance information quality, relevance, clarity and politeness at face value and (iii) to explicitate deictic knowledge and increase the deictic anchorage. This brings the main narrator (Nelly Dean) closer to the other characters in temporal, spatial, social and mental space, hence increasing her involvement in events and empathy towards characters. At the same time, it distances the outside frame narrator (Lockwood), who has limited contact with characters, and increases his detachment and antipathy. In both cases more is revealed of narrator-character relationships and the narrator’s evaluations, leading to a more subjective narrative mood. These findings, however, point to one overriding trend in the corpus: a tendency to communicate at the explicit level rather than the implied. Although this general trend may point to strengthening of textual and discoursal relations and to a text that is more ‘cohesive’, ‘explicit’ (Blum-Kulka 1986), ‘cooperative’ (Malmkjær 1998, 2005) and ‘fluent’ (Venuti 1995), it also suggests a text that is less stylistically varied and which tends to evoke less ‘reader involvement’ (Hickey 1998, Boase-Beier 2006, 2014). The shift is attributable to a number of factors: (i) the translator’s representation of her/his ‘conception’ or ‘concretisation’ of the original story (Levý 2011) and (ii) her/his attempts to explicitate the pragmatic forces of the original and ‘standardize’ its language and style (Toury 2012), with the likely purpose of avoiding processing difficulties or potential ambiguities and ensuring the success of this interlingual communication. These findings support the view that explicitation and standardization as <b>universal</b> strategies <b>stem</b> from the translator’s perception of his/her role as a intercultural mediator and her/his intention to help the reader (Munday 1997 a, Pápai 2004, Pym 2005, Saldanha 2008, Becher 2010) rather than that explicitation is related to the translation process itself (Øverås 1998, Olohan and Baker 2000) and standardization to the relative dominance of the translated language and literature (Vanderauwera 1985). Lastly, it is hoped that the model will be applicable to different texts and language pairs to compare the results and gain more understanding of translation norms and universals. ...|$|R

We show that the depletion of neural stem cells in the absence of Bmi- 1 is partially due to the derepression of two cell cycle inhibitors, p 16 Ink 4 a and p 19 Arf. Deletion of Ink 4 a and Arf from Bmi- 1 deficient mice is sufficient to partially rescue the self-renewal defects of neural stem cells, indicating Bmi- 1 regulates adult neural stem cell self-renewal mainly, but not exclusively by repressing the expression of Ink 4 a and Arf. Conversely, overexpression of Bmi- 1 is sufficient to enhance the self-renewal potential of CNS neural stem cells in vitro by suppressing culture-induced Ink 4 a and Arf expression, but has little effect on stem cell number or SVZ proliferation in vivo, where Ink 4 a and Arf are not normally expressed. Together, our data demonstrate that stem cell self-renewal capacity is modulated by factors affecting their cell cycle progression. The Sry-related HMG box transcription factor Sox 17 is specifically expressed by fetal, but not adult, hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), and is essential for their maintenance. We demonstrate that Sox 17 overexpression is sufficient to confer adult hematopoietic progenitors with certain fetal characteristics, and bias adult hematopoiesis to resemble fetal hematopoiesis. This is achieved at least partially by upregulating fetal HSC-specific gene expression, and suppressing differentiation-associated genes. Sox 17 may therefore maintain fetal HSC identity by repressing differentiation or lineage commitment. The immortal strand hypothesis has been proposed as a mechanism to protect the genomic integrity of stem cells by asymmetrically segregating old and newly synthesized chromosomes during cell division. Using HSCs as a model system, we demonstrate that asymmetric chromosome segregation does not occur at a significant frequency in HSCs in vivo or in culture. Therefore “immortal strand” segregation cannot be a <b>universal</b> mechanism protecting <b>stem</b> cells from accumulating genetic mutations...|$|R

International audienceThe 7 th ERCIM Workshop "User Interfaces for All" builds {{upon the}} results of the six {{previous}} Workshops held in Heraklion, Crete, Greece, 30 - 31 October 1995; Prague, Czech Republic, 7 - 8 November 1996; Obernai, France, 3 - 4 November 1997; Stockholm, Sweden, 19 - 21 October 1998; Dagstuhl, Germany, 28 November- 1 December 1999; and Florence, Italy, 25 - 26 October 2000. The vision of User Interfaces for All advocates the proactive realisation of the "design for all" principle in the field of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), and involves the development of user interfaces to interactive applications and telematic services, which provide universal access and usability to potentially all users. In the tradition of its predecessors, this Workshop aims to consolidate recent work, and to stimulate further discussion, {{on the state of the}} art in User Interfaces for All, and its increasing range of applications in the emerging Information Society. This year's event emphasises "Universal Access" and invites contributions on a broad range of topics, including technological applications and policy developments aiming to advance the notion of Information Society Technologies accessible and acceptable by the widest possible end-user population. The requirement for <b>Universal</b> Access <b>stems</b> from the growing impact of the fusion of the emerging technologies, and from the different dimensions of diversity that are intrinsic to the Information Society. These dimensions become evident when considering the broad range of user characteristics, the changing nature of human activities, the variety of contexts of use, the increasing availability and diversification of information, knowledge sources and services, the proliferation of technological platforms, etc. In this context, Universal Access refers to the accessibility, usability and, ultimately, acceptability of Information Society Technologies by anyone, anywhere, anytime, thus enabling equitable access and active participation of potentially all citizens in existing and emerging computer-mediated human activities. The user population includes people with different cultural, educational, training and employment background, novice and experienced computer users, the very young and the elderly, and people with different types of disabilities, in various interaction contexts and scenarios of use. As people experience technology through their contact with the user interface of interactive products, applications and services, the field of HCI has a critical and catalytic role to play towards a universally accessible, usable and acceptable Information Society. Scientific/technological contributions should be on concepts and tools that advance our understanding of, and contribute towards, Universal Access to the new computer-mediated virtual spaces. Areas of interest include, but are not limited to, future and emerging technologies, novel computing paradigms, computer-mediated virtual spaces, architectures and tools, interaction platforms, interaction metaphors, experimental or empirical studies, etc., which bear an impact on the scope of human access to digital content in an Information Society. Applications-oriented contributions may address practice and experience in the application of Universal Access principles in critical domains such as health, education, employment, etc. In this context, this year's workshop encourages contributions that elaborate upon, adopt, apply or validate a Universal Access code of practice in selected application domains. Finally, contributions on policy developments should discuss the impact of non-technological factors, such as legislation, standardisation, technology transfer, etc., on developing a culture for Universal Access in the Information Society for all parties concerned and, in particular, the industry. Policy contributions may cover success stories of the past or lay out prevailing obstacles to be addressed and removed by effective policy interventions...|$|R
