5|$|The Royal Australian Navy {{today is}} a {{medium-sized}} modern navy in world terms but {{is one of the}} strongest navies in the Asia Pacific Region. Today, the combat fleet of the RAN is made up of eight s, four s, fourteen patrol boats of the , and <b>six</b> <b>s.</b> The RAN also comprises an amphibious and supply force to transport the Australian Army and to resupply the combat arm of the navy. The RAN is divided into seven Force Element Groups (FEGs): Surface Combatants, Amphibious Warfare Forces and Afloat Support Force, Naval Aviation, Submarine Force, Mine Warfare and Clearance Diving, Patrol Boat Force and the Hydrographic Force. The FEG's were formed to manage the operations of the separate sections of the RAN in a more efficient way.|$|E
5|$|In September 1923, new {{regulations}} were promulgated, dividing the navy into a fleet, a river flotilla, and naval aviation. Later that month a Naval Command was established, based in Zemun, near Belgrade. The Navy Department, {{now known as}} Navy Section, was then only responsible for purely administrative matters, with Naval Command responsible for all operational questions. The service's initially unrealistic expansion goals of 24 destroyers and 24 submarines were soon shelved, {{and by the end}} of 1923 the fleet consisted of eight 250t-class torpedo boats, four Kaiman-class torpedo boats, <b>six</b> <b>s,</b> four Schichau-class minesweepers, the water carrier Perun (ex-Cyclop), the yachts Vila (ex-Dalmat) and Lada (ex-Quarnero), the training ship Vila Velebit, the salvage vessel Moćni (ex-Gigant), and four tugs. Kumbor (ex-Kronprinz Erzherzog Rudolf) had been sold for scrap in 1922, and three of the minesweepers were disposed of in 1924, as were the four hulks. The four river monitors remained in service, as Vardar, Drava, Morava and Sava respectively. They were supported by two motor patrol boats and three river tugs.|$|E
25|$|In May 1942, at German request, the Regia Marina {{deployed}} four 24 ton anti-submarine motorboats (Motoscafo Anti Sommergibile, MAS), <b>six</b> <b>s,</b> five torpedo motorboats, {{and five}} explosive motorboats to the Black Sea. The vessels were transported overland to the Danube River at Vienna, Austria, and then transported by water to Constanța, Romania. The flotilla had {{an active and}} successful campaign, based at Yalta and Feodosia.|$|E

Statham switched from guitar to keyboards and was briefly replaced by Stuart McLean (Charming Snakes) for a tour of Israel. B-Movie then resurfaced in early 1984 (with Al Cash on drums) with the single [...] "A Letter from Afar", produced by John [...] "Jellybean" [...] Benitez but it only reached No. 81 on the UK Singles Chart. Cash then left, leaving B-Movie as a three piece of Hovington, Statham and Winter augmented by session players.|$|R

Following the outbreak of World War I, Saida was assigned as the flotilla leader for the First Torpedo Flotilla, which included the <b>six</b> <b>s,</b> <b>six</b> <b>s,</b> ten torpedo boats, and a depot ship.

30|$|What {{condition}}s? Learning {{from the}} scheme of the <b>six</b> <b>s’s,</b> the main condition {{seems to be that}} the building ought in some way to have the predisposition to accommodate and embrace the requirement of different velocities of change, and to embrace it in the “right” way (in this sense, a perfect “anti-building”, with an extremely rigid furniture and an utterly feeble structure and site, would be maximally fragile). In short, the building should be apt to adapt.|$|R

500|$|The Kaiser-class {{ships were}} ordered {{under the same}} Second Naval Law as the {{preceding}} Helgoland-class battleships. The law provided that the life expectancy of capital ships was to be reduced from 25 to 20 years, a measure designed to necessitate construction of newer battleships. This meant that the <b>six</b> <b>s,</b> the two s, {{as well as the}} four s would have to be replaced.

In 1922, she was rebuilt as a merchant ship at the Deutsche Werke shipyard in Rüstringen. She was operated by A. Bernstein Co., out of Hamburg.

500|$|During {{the first}} half of the 20th century, many navies {{constructed}} or planned to build battlecruisers: large capital ships with greater speed but less armor than dreadnought battleships. The first battlecruisers, the , were championed by the British First Sea Lord John Fisher and appeared in 1908, two years after the revolutionary battleship [...] In the same year, Germany responded with its own battlecruiser, [...] Over the next decade, Britain and Germany built an additional twelve and six battlecruisers, respectively. Other nations joined them: [...] entered service for the Royal Australian Navy in 1913, Japan constructed four ships of the [...] from 1911 through 1915, and in late 1912 Russia laid down the four s, though they were never completed. Two countries considered acquiring battlecruisers in this time, but chose not to: France looked at several battlecruiser design studies in 1913 and 1914, and the United States ordered <b>six</b> <b>s</b> in 1916 that were never built.|$|E
500|$|After {{the end of}} the First World War, several navies {{continued}} and expanded naval construction programs that they had started during the conflict. The United States' 1916 program called for <b>six</b> <b>s</b> and five [...] battleships; in December 1918, the government of President Woodrow Wilson called for building an additional ten battleships and six battlecruisers. The 1919–1920 General Board proposals planned for slightly smaller, but still significant, acquisitions beyond the 1916 plan: two battleships and a battlecruiser for the fiscal year 1921, and three battleships, a battlecruiser, four aircraft carriers and thirty destroyers between the fiscal years 1922 and 1924. The United Kingdom was {{in the final stages of}} ordering eight capital ships (the G3 battlecruisers, with the first's keel laying in 1921, and N3-class battleships, to be laid down beginning in 1922). Imperial Japan was, by 1920, attempting to build up to an 8-8 standard with the , , , [...] and [...] classes. Two ships from these designs would be laid down per year until 1928.|$|E

Carrying the motto [...] "Fight On", the vessel was one of <b>six</b> <b>s</b> entered into service. [...] Later that year, a Bill was introduced into the Australian Senate to have three awards of the Victoria Cross for Australia made, one being to Sheean.

However, it was subsequently rejected by the Liberal Government. A painting depicting Sheean's final moments is held by the Australian War Memorial. His home town of Latrobe commemorates his life via the Sheean Walk and Teddy Sheean Memorial, opened in 1992.

500|$|So when Congress {{authorized}} a large naval building {{program in}} 1916, <b>six</b> <b>s</b> were included. None were completed before the arms-limiting Washington Naval Treaty was ratified in 1922; four were broken {{up on the}} slipway and two were converted into aircraft carriers. The treaty forestalled any further development of battlecruisers {{for the next decade}} and a half, but a number of countries experimented with [...] "cruiser-killer" [...] ships in the late 1930s that were designed to destroy the post-London Naval Treaty heavy cruisers. These designs were formally designated as battlecruisers by the Dutch and Soviets and as large cruisers by the Japanese and Americans, but all were roughly equivalent and all were commonly called battlecruisers. The US Navy's main impetus for the Alaska class was the threat posed by Japanese cruisers raiding its lines of communication in the event of war. Heavy cruisers were also the most likely surface threat to aircraft carriers making independent raids, so a cruiser-killer was also an ideal carrier escort. Reports of a Japanese equivalent reinforced the Navy's desire for these ships. Two were commissioned in time to serve during the last year of World War II, but were decommissioned two years after the war.|$|E

Evidence was obtained for two inhibitory mechanisms: inhibition of central activation processes and inhibition of transmission of motor commands from central to peripheral structures. Results have implications for the distinction between controlled and ballistic processes. The ability to inhibit planned actions is an important control option that allows efficient reactions to sudden changes in the environment. Such changes may arise as an unexpected consequence of one's own behavior, {{or they may be}} due to extraneous factors. In both cases, unexpected changes may render planned actions inappropriate, in which case these actions will need to be inhibited...|$|R
