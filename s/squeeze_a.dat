5|$|As a {{token of}} respect, {{prosecutor}} Klavier Gavin, Kristoph's brother and Apollo's rival, invites him and Trucy to attend a concert for his band, the Gavinners. During a guest performance by the diva Lamiroir, her manager Romein LeTouse is shot and killed in her dressing room. When Machi Tobaye, Lamiroir's pianist, is accused for the killing, Apollo, through an extensive investigation, discovers that Machi {{and one of the}} Gavinners, Detective Daryan Crescend, conspired to smuggle contraband into the country, and that Letouse, in reality an undercover Interpol agent, was murdered to cover it up. The case nearly falls apart {{due to a lack of}} decisive evidence, but Apollo is able to <b>squeeze</b> <b>a</b> confession out of Daryan by threatening to have Machi testify.|$|E

25|$|As the {{businesses}} expanded and became more complex, Danone had made several attempts {{to buy out}} Wahaha, but was rebuffed. Danone and Wahaha's General Manager Zong Qinghou signed a deal in December 2006, allowing Danone to buy a majority stake in the non-JV operations. However, Zong had second thoughts about the deal and reneged, claiming the offer was underpriced. It is alleged {{that he wanted to}} <b>squeeze</b> <b>a</b> higher price out of Danone.|$|E
25|$|In 2006, a {{study by}} Doron Behar and Karl Skorecki of the Technion and Ramban Medical Center in Haifa, Israel {{demonstrated}} {{that the vast majority}} of Ashkenazi Jews, both men and women, have Middle Eastern ancestry. According to Nicholas Wades' 2010 Autosomal study Ashkenazi Jews share a common ancestry with other Jewish groups and Ashkenazi and Sephardi Jews have roughly 30% European ancestry with the rest being Middle Eastern. According to Hammer, the Ashkenazi population expanded through a series of bottlenecks—events that <b>squeeze</b> <b>a</b> population down to small numbers—perhaps as it migrated from the Middle East after the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE, to Italy, reaching the Rhine Valley in the 10th century.|$|E

50|$|In {{the card}} game {{contract}} bridge, <b>an</b> entry-shifting <b>squeeze</b> is <b>a</b> mixture between <b>a</b> material <b>squeeze</b> and <b>an</b> immaterial <b>squeeze.</b> The material {{part is the}} same as in <b>a</b> trump <b>squeeze</b> or <b>a</b> <b>squeeze</b> without the count. The immaterial part is that depending on the choice of discards of the squeezee an entry into one or into the other hand is created. For that very reason <b>an</b> entry-shifting <b>squeeze</b> is always <b>a</b> positional <b>squeeze.</b>|$|R

500|$|Before concerts, as {{the others}} of the band tuned up, Rollins would stride about the stage dressed only {{in a pair of}} black shorts, {{grinding}} his teeth; to focus before the show, he would <b>squeeze</b> <b>a</b> pool ball. His stage persona impressed several critics; after a 1982 show in Anacortes, Washington, Sub Pop critic Calvin Johnson wrote: [...] "Henry was incredible. Pacing back and forth, lunging, lurching, growling; it was all real, the most intense emotional experiences I have ever seen." ...|$|E
500|$|The A.V. Clubs Andy Battaglia {{felt that}} [...] "Lose My Breath" [...] gave the album an [...] "opening charge {{by way of}} a raucous marching-band beat and panting {{attempts}} to <b>squeeze</b> <b>a</b> lot of words into closing musical corners". Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian described the song as [...] "fantastic, legs-in-the-air". Paul Flynn of the same publication wrote that it [...] "further relegated the other members of Destiny's Child to the position of Beyoncé's backing singers". Tom Breihan of Pitchfork Media who complimented Jerkins's [...] "incredible" [...] drum programming and the [...] "mind-boggling" [...] backing track felt that it lacked a tune: [...] "The vocals are too breathy, too whiny, and too processed, and the song's one thrilling moment-- near the end, where the harmonies get a bit of room to play off each other with ABBA-esque rococo aplomb-- lasts only for a second." [...] Los Angeles Times writer Natalie Nichols deemed its production [...] "nifty" [...] with a [...] "rat-a-tat drum line percussion propelling" [...] but felt that it contained a single hook expanded into an entire song. Lindsey Weber from Vulture criticized Williams' contribution to the bridge, describing it as [...] "weak".|$|E

5000|$|It {{is often}} equated with [...] "{{progressive}} squeeze" [...] (also termed a [...] "repeating squeeze"), but progressive <b>squeezes</b> are <b>a</b> subset of triple <b>squeezes.</b> <b>A</b> progressive <b>squeeze</b> is <b>a</b> triple <b>squeeze</b> that, depending both on entries and on positional factors, {{may result in}} a subsequent, simple, two-suit squeeze that takes place against the opponent who has just been triple squeezed. Confusing the issue is that some triple squeezes can become progressive squeezes through misdefense.|$|R

2500|$|Randi {{says the}} healer would {{slightly}} roll or pinch the skin {{over the area}} to be treated. When his flattened hand reaches under the roll of skin, it looks and feels as if the practitioner is actually entering into the patient's body. The healer would have prepared in advance small pellets or bags of animal entrails which would be palmed in his hand [...] or hidden beneath the table within easy reach. This organic matter would simulate the [...] "diseased" [...] tissue that the healer would claim to be removing. [...] If the healer wants to simulate bleeding, he might <b>squeeze</b> <b>a</b> bladder of animal blood or an impregnated sponge. If done properly, [...] this procedure may deceive patients and observers. However, some [...] "psychic surgery" [...] procedures do not rely solely on the [...] "sleight of hand" [...] described, as at least one Brazilian [...] "surgeon" [...] also cuts his victims' skin with an unsterilized scalpel to heighten the illusion.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the late}} 20th century, the media became more {{important}} in Congress's work. Analyst Michael Schudson suggested that greater publicity undermined the power of political parties and caused [...] "more roads to open up in Congress for individual representatives to influence decisions". Norman Ornstein suggested that media prominence led to {{a greater emphasis on}} the negative and sensational side of Congress, and referred to this as the tabloidization of media coverage. Others saw pressure to <b>squeeze</b> <b>a</b> political position into a thirty-second soundbite. A report characterized Congress in 2013 as being unproductive, gridlocked, and [...] "setting records for futility". In October 2013, with Congress unable to compromise, the government was shut down for several weeks and risked a serious default on debt payments, causing 60% of the public to say they would [...] "fire every member of Congress" [...] including their own representative. One report suggested Congress posed the [...] "biggest risk to the US economy" [...] because of its brinksmanship, [...] "down-to-the-wire budget and debt crises" [...] and [...] "indiscriminate spending cuts", resulting in slowed economic activity and keeping up to two million people unemployed. There has been increasing public dissatisfaction with Congress, with extremely low approval ratings which dropped to 5% in October 2013.|$|E

50|$|A dyno torch, dynamo torch, or <b>squeeze</b> {{flashlight}} is <b>a</b> flashlight or pocket torch which stores {{energy in}} a flywheel. The user repeatedly <b>squeezes</b> <b>a</b> handle to spin a flywheel inside the flashlight, {{attached to a}} small dynamo, supplying electric current to an incandescent bulb or light-emitting diode. The flashlight must be pumped continuously during use, with the flywheel turning the generator between squeezes to keep the light going continuously. Because electrical power is produced only when the handle is <b>squeezed,</b> <b>a</b> switch is not needed. Dyno torches were issued to soldiers during World War II, and were popular in Europe during the war because the electrical power supply to homes was not very reliable. A version using a pull-cord was used in World War I.|$|R

Prior to filming, Smith had been reading A Bright Red Scream, a book that explains the reasons one would turn to self-injury. It was Smith who insisted that a self-injury scene be filmed and put into the movie, believing it was necessary to show Amanda's tendencies for character depth.|$|R
