One specimen can foul the taste of a whole meal prepared with mushrooms. Despite this, it is sold in local markets (tianguis) in Mexico. A local recipe from France, Romania and East Germany calls for stewing it in <b>skimmed</b> <b>milk</b> after which it can be eaten, or powdered and used for flavouring. The mushroom is not bitter for those who lack genetic sensitivity to bitter taste, a trait endowed by the gene TAS2R38 (taste receptor 2 member 38). The compound responsible for the bitter taste has not been identified.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s, it was {{discovered}} that medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) produce more ketone bodies per unit of energy than normal dietary fats (which are mostly long-chain triglycerides). MCTs are more efficiently absorbed and are rapidly transported to the liver via the hepatic portal system rather than the lymphatic system. The severe carbohydrate restrictions of the classic ketogenic diet made it difficult for parents to produce palatable meals that their children would tolerate. In 1971, Peter Huttenlocher devised a ketogenic diet where about 60% of the calories came from the MCT oil, and this allowed more protein and up to three times as much carbohydrate as the classic ketogenic diet. The oil was mixed with at least twice its volume of <b>skimmed</b> <b>milk,</b> chilled, and sipped during the meal or incorporated into food. He tested it on twelve children and adolescents with intractable seizures. Most children improved in both seizure control and alertness, results that were similar to the classic ketogenic diet. Gastrointestinal upset was a problem, which led one patient to abandon the diet, but meals were easier to prepare and better accepted by the children. The MCT diet replaced the classic ketogenic diet in many hospitals, though some devised diets that were a combination of the two.|$|E

40|$|Health {{consciousness}} drives {{people to}} drink <b>skim</b> <b>milk.</b> Yet, improving the blue-white appearance and watery texture of <b>skim</b> <b>milk</b> {{is necessary to}} make consumers happy with <b>skim</b> <b>milk.</b> In this study, the influence of limited proteolysis with soluble or immobilized proteases, heat treatment, and pH on the whiteness of <b>skim</b> <b>milk</b> were examined to meet this goal. Limited proteolysis with milk-clotting enzymes increased the whiteness of <b>skim</b> <b>milk.</b> the proteases porcine pepsin and chymosin were immobilized onto nonporous ceramic, glass, and controlled pore glass (CPG) beads. The enzymes were coupled to beads either directly or via crosslinker proteins. Pepsin, immobilized onto CPG beads via crosslinker proteins, exhibited the best properties with respect to enzymatic activity, stability, and whitening efficiency. The L value (whiteness) of this immobilized enzyme-treated <b>skim</b> <b>milk</b> was 79. 5, which approached the whiteness of 1 % fat milk. Immobilized proteases whitened <b>skim</b> <b>milk</b> more effectively than did soluble proteases. The whiteness of <b>skim</b> <b>milk</b> was determined at various temperatures from 4 to 90 °C. The L value increased with increasing temperature throughout the range tested. For samples not heated above 50 °C, the increases in L values were completely reversible on cooling.
