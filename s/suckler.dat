500|$|The beef from Highland cattle is very tender, but {{the market}} for {{high-quality}} meat has declined. To address this decline, it is common practice to breed Highland [...] "suckler" [...] cows with a more favourable breed such as a Shorthorn or Limousin bull.

These crossbred beef <b>suckler</b> cows inherit the hardiness, thrift and mothering capabilities of their Highland dams and the improved carcass configuration of their sires. Such crossbred sucklers can be further crossbred with a modern beef bull such as a Limousin or Charolais to produce high quality beef.|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} of antimicrobial resistance is {{triggered by the}} use of antibiotic drugs. Therefore, the consumption of antibiotics in livestock is monitored, and different measures may be applied if the usage of antibiotic drugs seems inappropriate. Unfortunately, the surveillance of antibiotic consumption is not standardised, and surveillance systems differ. In Germany, the food quality assurance system QS Qualität und Sicherheit GmbH (QS) began the documentation of antibiotic drug usage in pigs in 2012 in a private economic based database, and for its members, documentation has been mandatory in all pig age groups since 2014. In this investigation, we calculated the distribution of the antibiotics use per pig age group and half-year, and the percentage of the active substances used from overall treatments within German pig holdings from 1 July, 2013 to 30 June, 2015. In fattening pigs, the median of the treatment frequency is 4. 3 in 2013 - 2 and exhibits a decreasing trend in this time period up to 2. 1 in 2015 - 1. In weaners the median ranged between 11. 3 in 2014 - 2 and 5. 8 in 2013 - 2. The median of <b>sucklers</b> varies between 21. 6 and 25. 0. In <b>sucklers</b> and weaners, a clear temporal trend is not seen to date. The share of the active substances differs between the age groups. In fattening pigs, mostly tetracyclines and penicillines were used, occurring in approximately 60 % of the total treatments.

During this time, 28 840 cases from various livestock species were re-ceived, of which 4 162 (14, 4 %) were from pigs. The 674 porcine cases selected {{for this study were}} included if an E. coli infection had been suspected by the referring veterinarian, and typable E. coli strains were then isolated by this laboratory. Enteritis (45, 5 %) and septicaemia (46, 9 %) were the most common syndromes, with agalactiae (1, 4 %) and abortion (1, 1 %) representing a far lower prevalence.

40|$|Cattle {{breeding}} causes one of {{the biggest}} gas pollutions. As measuring of gas concentration still remains very difficult, it's not easy to set up improving technologies. This thesis is therefore aimed on measuring of ammonia, microclimate and ammonia emissions of cattle excluding market cattle <b>sucklers</b> while both pasture and winter stabling. As a suitable place for measuring, a farm of Radomir Sedlacek was chosen. To verify proposed method in practice, measuring took place also in other pasturing areas. Total average of ammonia concentration in pasture measuring was 0, 5123 mg. m- 3. Total average of specific producing emissions from the pasture was 25, 45825, 458 kg. ks- 1. rok- 1. Total average concentration in the stable of all six probes was 0, 7035403 NH 3 mg. m- 3. Total average of producing emission in the stable of all six probes was 113, 2744816 kg. stáj- 1. rok- 1. Specific producing emission for one animal while stabling was 1, 742684332 kg. ks- 1. rok- 1. Suggested action to decrease ammonia emissions on the pasture is use of Amalgerol classic. In the stables this preparation is suggested to go together with PRP FIX fermentation. When combined, up to 70 % decrease of ammonia emissions can be achieved...|$|R
40|$|The {{study was}} carried out to {{investigate}} the prevalence of Peste des petitis ruminants (PPR) in goats in Rajshahi District of Bangladesh, {{and its relation to}} age, sex, breeds and seasonal influence. In total, 627 goats were examined where 305 were males and 322 were females. The overall prevalence of PPR in goats was found to be 20. 57 % (n= 129). From the various risk factors analysed, age categories of goats, sex, breed and seasonal influence were found to be significantly associated (p< 0. 01) with the prevalence of PPR. Findings suggested that the seasonal influence on outbreaks of this disease was significantly higher. The clinical prevalence of PPR was highest in the month of December (31. 68 %) and lowest in June (9. 52 %). The influence of sex on PPR outbreaks was found to be higher in male (28. 52 %) than female (13. 04 %) goats. As regards to age, PPR was significantly higher in young (31. 06 %) compared to <b>sucklers</b> (13. 14 %) and adult (10. 15 %). The susceptibility of Black Bengal goats to PPR was higher than other breeds. The results of this study showed that PPR is an important goat disease in the studied areas. Thus, an appropriate control strategy has to be designed and applied, which could involve prevention of contact with infected goats and vaccination against the PPR virus. [Vet.

The mean (s. d.) herd size, stocking rate and farm size was 68 cows (27. 6), 2. 0  LU/ha (0. 3) and 64. 3 (21. 6) adjusted hectares, respectively. Two questionnaires were designed; 1) a farmer questionnaire to collect information on farm background and current herd health control practices and 2) a veterinary questionnaire to collect information on the extent of animal health advice given by veterinarians to their clients and identification of any on-farm herd health issues. Results: Dystocia, calf pneumonia, and calf diarrhoea, in that order, were identified as the primary herd health issues in these Irish <b>suckler</b> beef herds.
