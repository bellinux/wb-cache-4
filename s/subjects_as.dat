5|$|Feminism in {{psychology}} {{emerged as a}} critique of the dominant male outlook on psychological research where only male perspectives were studied with all male <b>subjects.</b> <b>As</b> women earned doctorates {{in psychology}}, females and their issues were introduced as legitimate topics of study. Feminist psychology emphasizes social context, lived experience, and qualitative analysis. Projects such as Psychology's Feminist Voices have emerged to catalogue the influence of feminist psychologists on the discipline.|$|E

5|$|Alboin's {{problems}} in maintaining {{control over his}} people worsened during the siege of Ticinum. The nature of the Lombard monarchy {{made it difficult for}} a ruler to exert the same degree of authority over his <b>subjects</b> <b>as</b> had been exercised by Theodoric over his Goths, and the structure of the army gave great authority to the military commanders or duces, who led each band (fara) of warriors. Additionally, the difficulties encountered by Alboin in building a solid political entity resulted from a lack of imperial legitimacy, as unlike the Ostrogoths, they had not entered Italy as foederati but as enemies of the Empire.|$|E

5|$|Between 911 and 919, Edward {{expanded}} his {{control over the}} rest of England south of the Humber, establishing in Essex and Mercia burhs, often designed to control the use of a river by the Danes. In 917, the Danish position in the area suddenly collapsed. A rapid succession of defeats culminated in the loss of the territories of Northampton and Huntingdon, along with the remainder of Essex: a Danish king, probably from East Anglia, was killed at Tempsford. Despite reinforcement from overseas, the Danish counter-attacks were crushed, and following the defection of many of their English <b>subjects</b> <b>as</b> Edward's army advanced, the Danes of East Anglia and Cambridge both capitulated.|$|E

While describing detailed events unfolding within the city, Villani would name every individual street, square, bridge, family, and person involved, assuming his readers would have the same intimate knowledge of Florence as he did.|$|E
