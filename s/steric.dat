5|$|The <b>steric</b> {{bulk of the}} {{phosphonate}} and electron-withdrawing groups plays {{a critical}} role in the reaction of α-branched phosphonates with aliphatic aldehydes.|$|E
5|$|Along {{this same}} vein, allenyl vinyl ketones {{of the type}} studied {{extensively}} by Marcus Tius of the University of Hawaii show dramatic rate acceleration due to the removal of β-hydrogens, obviating {{a large amount of}} <b>steric</b> strain in the s-cis conformer.|$|E
5|$|<b>Steric</b> {{hindrance}} in the betaine {{with greater}} hindrance leading to greater reversibility by disfavoring {{formation of the}} intermediate and slowing the rate-limiting rotation of the central bond.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the large}} size of the Ca2+ ion, high {{coordination}} numbers are common, up to 24 in some intermetallic compounds such as CaZn13. Calcium is readily complexed by oxygen chelates such as EDTA and polyphosphates, which are useful in analytic chemistry and removing calcium ions from hard water. In the absence of <b>steric</b> hindrance, smaller group 2 cations tend to form stronger complexes, but when large polydentate macrocycles are involved the trend is reversed.|$|E
5|$|It {{had been}} also conjectured that the double bond between carbons 4 and 5 of the imidazolium ring backbone, which gave {{aromatic}} character to that system, {{was important for}} the carbene's stability. This conjecture was disproved in 1995 by Arduengo's group, who obtained a derivative of dihydroimidazol-2-ylidene, lacking the double bond. The thermodynamical stability in this compound, {{and the role of}} <b>steric</b> protection in preventing dimerisation, has been a topic of some dispute.|$|E
5|$|Since {{oxygen and}} sulfur are divalent, <b>steric</b> {{protection}} of the carbenic centre is limited especially when the N-C-X unit {{is part of a}} ring. These acyclic carbenes have diagnostic 13C NMR chemical shift values between 250–300 ppm for the carbenic carbon, further downfield than any other types of stable carbene. X-ray structures have shown N-C-X bond angles of ca. 104 ° and 109 ° respectively.|$|E
5|$|Threonine proteases use {{the amino}} acid {{threonine}} as their catalytic nucleophile. Unlike cysteine and serine, threonine is a secondary alcohol (i.e. has a methyl group). The methyl group of threonine greatly restricts the possible orientations of triad and substrate, as the methyl clashes {{with either the}} enzyme backbone or the histidine base. Consequently, most threonine proteases use an N-terminal threonine {{in order to avoid}} such <b>steric</b> clashes.|$|E
5|$|Amino acids {{that share}} the same biosynthetic pathway tend {{to have the same}} first base in their codons. This could be an {{evolutionary}} relic of an early, simpler genetic code with fewer amino acids that later evolved to code a larger set of amino acids. It could also reflect <b>steric</b> and chemical properties that had another effect on the codon during its evolution. Amino acids with similar physical properties also tend to have similar codons, reducing the problems caused by point mutations and mistranslations.|$|E
5|$|Persistent carbenes {{can exist}} in the singlet or the triplet states with the singlet state carbenes being more stable. The {{relative}} stability of these compounds is only partly due to <b>steric</b> hindrance by bulky groups. Some singlet carbenes are thermodynamically stable {{in the absence of}} moisture and (in most cases) oxygen, and can be isolated and indefinitely stored. Others dimerise slowly over days. Triplet state carbenes have half-lives measured in seconds, and therefore can be observed but not stored.|$|E
5|$|The base is most {{commonly}} histidine since its pKa allows for effective base catalysis, hydrogen bonding to the acid residue, and deprotonation of the nucleophile residue. β-lactamases such as TEM-1 use a lysine residue as the base. Because lysine's pKa {{is so high}} (pKa=11), a glutamate and several other residues act as the acid to stabilise its deprotonated state during the catalytic cycle. Threonine proteases use their N-terminal amide as the base, since <b>steric</b> crowding by the catalytic threonine's methyl prevents other residues from being close enough.|$|E
5|$|The most {{successful}} reagents employed in a stoichiometric fashion are shown below. The {{first is a}} bicyclic oxathiane that has been employed in the synthesis of the β-adrenergic compound dichloroisoproterenol (DCI) but {{is limited by the}} availability of only one enantiomer of the reagent. The synthesis of the axial diastereomer is rationalized via the 1,3-anomeric effect which reduces the nucleophilicity of the equatorial lone pair. The conformation of the ylide is limited by transannular strain and approach of the aldehyde is limited to one face of the ylide by <b>steric</b> interactions with the methyl substituents.|$|E
5|$|The {{side-chain}} of the nucleophilic residue performs covalent catalysis on the substrate. The lone pair {{of electrons}} {{present on the}} oxygen or sulphur attacks the electropositive carbonyl carbon. The 20 naturally occurring biological amino acids do not contain any sufficiently nucleophilic functional groups for many difficult catalytic reactions. Embedding the nucleophile in a triad increases its reactivity for efficient catalysis. The most commonly used nucleophiles are the hydroxyl (OH) of serine and the thiol/thiolate ion (SH/S−) of cysteine. Alternatively, threonine proteases use the secondary hydroxyl of threonine, however due to <b>steric</b> hindrance of the side chain's extra methyl group such proteases use their N-terminal amide as the base, rather than a separate amino acid.|$|E
25|$|It {{should be}} noted that the matter of the {{rotational}} barrier of ethane is not settled within the scientific community. An analysis within quantitative molecular orbital theory shows that 2-orbital-4-electron (<b>steric)</b> repulsions are dominant over hyperconjugation. A valence bond theory study also emphasizes the importance of <b>steric</b> effects.|$|E
25|$|<b>Steric</b> forces between polymer-covered {{surfaces}} or in solutions containing non-adsorbing polymer can modulate interparticle forces, {{producing an}} additional <b>steric</b> repulsive force (which is predominantly entropic in origin) or an attractive depletion force between them. Such an effect is specifically searched for with tailor-made superplasticizers developed {{to increase the}} workability of concrete and to reduce its water content.|$|E
25|$|Electrostatic and <b>steric</b> {{stabilization}} do {{not directly}} address the sedimentation/floating problem.|$|E
25|$|Silyl ethers {{are mainly}} {{differentiated}} {{on the basis}} of sterics or electronics. In general, acidic deprotections deprotect less hindered silyl groups faster, with the <b>steric</b> bulk on silicon being more significant than the <b>steric</b> bulk on oxygen. Fluoride-based deprotections deprotect electron-poor silyl groups faster than electron-rich silyl groups. There is some evidence that some silyl deprotections proceed via hypervalent silicon species.|$|E
25|$|Electrostatic {{stabilization}} and <b>steric</b> stabilization {{are the two}} main mechanisms for stabilization against aggregation.|$|E
25|$|The yield is only 4%, {{which is}} further {{evidence}} consistent with substantial <b>steric</b> crowding around the arene core.|$|E
25|$|<b>Steric</b> {{hindrance}} can {{be exploited}} {{to limit the}} number of alkylations, as in the t-butylation of 1,4-dimethoxybenzene.|$|E
25|$|<b>Steric</b> {{stabilization}} {{consists in}} covering the particles in polymers which prevents the particle {{to get close}} {{in the range of}} attractive forces.|$|E
25|$|Cyclopropanation (the Bingel reaction) {{is another}} common method for functionalizing C60. Cyclopropanation of C60 mostly {{occurs at the}} {{junction}} of 2 hexagons due to <b>steric</b> factors.|$|E
25|$|Hydroboration of 1,2-disubstituted alkenes, {{such as a}} cis or trans olefin, {{produces}} {{generally a}} mixture of the two organoboranes of comparable amounts, even if the substituents are very different in terms of <b>steric</b> bulk. For such 1,2-disubstituted olefins, regioselectivity can be observed only {{when one of the}} two substituents is a phenyl ring. In such cases, such as trans-1-phenylpropene, the boron atom is placed on the carbon adjacent to the phenyl ring. The observations above indicate that the addition of H-B bond to olefins is under electronic control rather than <b>steric</b> control.|$|E
25|$|Fluorescent {{fragment}} linkage may {{alter the}} folding or {{structure of the}} protein of interest, leading to the elimination of an interacting protein's surface binding site. In addition, {{the arrangement of the}} fluorescent fragments may prevent fluorophore reconstitution through <b>steric</b> hindrance, although <b>steric</b> hindrance can be reduced or eliminated by using a linker sequence that allows sufficient flexibility for the fluorescent fragments to associate. Therefore, absence of fluorescence complementation may be a false negative and does not necessarily prove that the interaction in question does not occur.|$|E
25|$|The method {{works on}} {{unbranched}} aliphatic aldehydes, {{which are often}} poor electrophiles for catalytic, asymmetric processes. This {{may be due to}} poor electronic and <b>steric</b> differentiation between their enantiofaces.|$|E
25|$|Particle {{settling}} is {{hindered by}} the stiffness of the polymeric matrix where particles are trapped. In addition, the long polymeric chains {{can provide a}} <b>steric</b> or electrosteric stabilization to dispersed particles.|$|E
25|$|Model {{depends on}} {{interactions}} observed in many systems and affects both structure and reactivity. This {{is based on}} the theory that close-range, nonbonded interactions are repulsive, i.e. <b>Steric</b> strain.|$|E
25|$|In hexaferrocenylbenzene, C66, all six {{positions}} on a benzene molecule have ferrocenyl substituents (R). X-ray diffraction {{analysis of this}} compound confirms that the cyclopentadienyl ligands are not co-planar with the benzene core but have alternating dihedral angles of +30° and −80°. Due to <b>steric</b> crowding the ferrocenyls are slightly bent with angles of 177° and have elongated C-Fe bonds. The quaternary cyclopentadienyl carbon atoms are also pyramidalized. Also, the benzene core has a chair conformation with dihedral angles of 14° and displays bond length alternation between 142.7pm and 141.1pm, both indications of <b>steric</b> crowding of the substituents.|$|E
25|$|The most {{versatile}} among dialkylboranes is 9-BBN. It exists predominantly as a dimer. It can be distilled without decomposition at 195°C (12mm Hg). Such property allows 9-BBN to react at 60–80°C, and most alkenes react within one hour in such temperature range. Even tetrasubstituted alkenes undergo hydroboration with 9-BBN at elevated temperature. As mentioned before, 9-BBN has excellent regioselectivity in hydroboration of alkenes. It is {{more sensitive to}} subtle <b>steric</b> differences than Sia2BH, because the rigid hetereocyclic substituents prevent internal rotation to relieve <b>steric</b> hindrance in the transition state. Reflecting its greater sensitivity to electronic factors, 9-BBN is more reactive towards alkenes than alkynes.|$|E
25|$|Various cyclic amine {{groups can}} act as the basic moiety and potency stays {{relatively}} unchanged for example aryl piperazine, piperidine and morpholine. An acyclic tertiary amine is tolerated as the basic moiety but larger <b>steric</b> groups are less tolerated.|$|E
25|$|Copper-promoted {{nucleophilic}} aromatic substitution. Electronegative {{groups in}} the ortho position of the aryl halogen are strongly activated toward these reactions. On the other hand, this reaction is inhibited by the <b>steric</b> hindrance provided by bulky groups on ortho positions of the aryl groups.|$|E
25|$|In highly {{branched}} alkanes, {{the bond}} angle may {{differ significantly from}} the optimal value (109.5°) {{in order to allow}} the different groups sufficient space. This causes a tension in the molecule, known as <b>steric</b> hindrance, and can substantially increase the reactivity.|$|E
25|$|Polyacetylene can be {{synthesized}} by ring-opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) from cyclooctatetraene, {{a material}} easier to handle than the acetylene monomer. This synthetic route {{also provides a}} facile method for adding solubilizing groups to the polymer while maintaining the conjugation. Robert Grubbs and coworkers synthesized a variety of polyacetylene derivatives with linear and branched alkyl chains. Polymers with linear groups such as n-octyl had high conductivity but low solubility, while highly branched tert-butyl groups increased solubility but decreased conjugation due to polymer twisting to avoid <b>steric</b> crowding. They obtained soluble and conductive polymers with sec-butyl and neopentyl groups, because the methylene (CH2) unit directly connected to the polymer reduces <b>steric</b> crowding and prevents twisting.|$|E
25|$|Fluorine atoms {{are small}} {{enough for a}} 1,2-addition, while Cl2 and Br2 add to remote C atoms due to <b>steric</b> factors. For example, in C60Br8 and C60Br24, the Br atoms are in 1,3- or 1,4-positions with respect to each other.|$|E
25|$|Dimesitylborane (C6H2Me3)2BH is a {{particularly}} bulky secondary borane. Because of severe <b>steric</b> hindrance, it does not react readily even with simple terminal alkenes. Prolonged reaction time is required at room temperature. On the other hand, alkynes undergo monohydroboration with Mes2BH easily to produce alkenylboranes.|$|E
25|$|The {{positions}} of the isocyanate groups influences their reactivity. In 4,4'-MDI, the two isocyanate groups are equivalent but in 2,4'-MDI the two groups display highly differing reactivities. The group at the 4-position is approximately four times more reactive than the group at the 2-position due to <b>steric</b> hindrance.|$|E
25|$|The <b>steric</b> {{bulk of the}} ylide 1 {{influences}} the stereochemical outcome of nucleophilic addition to give a predominance of the betaine 3 (cf. Bürgi–Dunitz angle). Note that for betaine 3 both R1 and R2 as well as PPh3+ and O− are positioned anti to one another.|$|E
