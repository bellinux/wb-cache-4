5|$|The German women's {{national}} football team wears white shirts with black shorts and white <b>socks,</b> following {{the tradition of}} the German men's team– black and white are the colours of Prussia. The current change kit is red and black, with black shorts and red <b>socks.</b> In the past, Germany also used green shirts with white shorts and green <b>socks</b> as the away kit.|$|E
5|$|Chelsea {{have always}} worn blue shirts, {{although}} they originally used the paler eton blue, which {{was taken from}} the racing colours of then club president, Earl Cadogan, and was worn with white shorts and dark blue or black <b>socks.</b> The light blue shirts were replaced by a royal blue version in around 1912. In the 1960s Chelsea manager Tommy Docherty changed the kit again, switching to blue shorts (which have remained ever since) and white <b>socks,</b> believing it made the club's colours more modern and distinctive, since no other major side used that combination; this kit was first worn during the 1964–65 season. Since then Chelsea have always worn white <b>socks</b> with their home kit apart from a short spell from 1985 to 1992, when blue <b>socks</b> were reintroduced.|$|E

5|$|New {{home and}} away kits were {{introduced}} {{for the first time}} in two years. The home kit comprised red and navy blue halved shirts with red collars, navy blue shorts and navy blue <b>socks</b> with two white strips on the cuffs. The away kit included white shirts with black shoulders, white shorts and white <b>socks</b> with black cuffs. Last season's third kit was retained, which featured light blue shirts with a maroon collar, bar a section under the neck which was light blue, and maroon trims on the sleeves, maroon shorts and light blue <b>socks.</b> CLP Industries continued as shirt sponsors for the fourth successive season.|$|E

5000|$|Four {{volumes of}} {{black-and-white}} <b>Sock</b> Monkey comics have been published; each volume {{consists of two}} issues. Volume 3 won the 2001 Eisner Award for Best Humor Publication. Volume 4 featured one issue drawn in charcoal, {{as opposed to the}} ink of the other issues, and another issue in which the character designs were changed dramatically. These comics have also been collected in two trade paperbacks, each containing two volumes: The Adventures of Tony Millionaire's <b>Sock</b> Monkey (2000) and The Collected Works of Tony Millionaire's <b>Sock</b> Monkey (2004). As of late 2006 a four-issue <b>Sock</b> Monkey mini-series featuring an extended story titled [...] "The Inches Incident" [...] is being released one issue at a time. In addition to the <b>Sock</b> Monkey comics, Millionaire has also produced five other <b>Sock</b> Monkey books. <b>Sock</b> Monkey: A Children's Book (2001) and <b>Sock</b> Monkey: The Glass Doorknob (2002) mix comics with illustrated prose. <b>Sock</b> Monkey: Uncle Gabby (2004), That Darn Yarn (2005), and Little and Large (2005) are full-color, hardcover comic books. That Darn Yarn and Little and Large are both 36 pages and read much more like children's storybooks than Millionaire's other <b>Sock</b> Monkey comics.|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn a pursuit {{to further}} improve the {{understanding}} of the factors influencing friction blister formation, friction between running <b>sock</b> textiles and the skin at the first metatarsal head (1 MTH) region was investigated in three different moisture conditions (dry, low moisture and wet). Twenty-six participants were recruited and two running <b>sock</b> types were selected based on the variations of their fibre composition and knit structure: 1) a predominantly nylon anti-blister <b>sock</b> and 2) a cotton-rich <b>sock.</b> All friction tests were conducted in controlled room conditions with a temperature of between 20 to 22 °C and a relative humidity of 40 to 60 % using a bespoke rig developed at the University of Sheffield for foot friction studies. Water was applied {{to the inside of the}} plantar region of the <b>sock</b> textiles to different levels using a moisture control protocol. The moisture level of both the 1 MTH region and the <b>sock</b> fabrics were monitored throughout testing using a Corneometer® device. Increasing <b>sock</b> moisture above the dry condition was found to increase foot-sock sliding friction for both <b>sock</b> materials tested. No significant correlation was found at the level p < 0. 05 between foot hydration level and sliding friction over the hydration range tested. In dry conditions, the cotton-rich <b>sock</b> exhibited lower levels of friction compared with the anti-blister <b>sock.</b> However, in both low moisture and wet conditions, the anti-blister <b>sock</b> showed comparatively lower levels of friction than the cotton-rich <b>sock.</b> This suggests that for intensive athletic events where significant perspiration is likely to occur, the anti-blister <b>sock</b> would provide lower friction. This study offers a new approach to friction testing of <b>sock</b> materials and it is hoped that its outcomes will provide new insights on the preventative measures for friction blisters...|$|R
5000|$|The dousing <b>sock,</b> [...] "spinnaker sleeve", snuffer, or just <b>sock,</b> is {{a device}} {{used to make}} {{deploying}} and retrieving the spinnaker a much easier task. The <b>sock</b> is a long fabric tube with a ring in one end to hold it open. Since the spinnaker is stored in the <b>sock,</b> {{the first step is}} to set up the <b>sock.</b> Two lines are attached to the sock; one is attached to a bridle on the ring, for pulling the <b>sock</b> down, and one is up the inside, from the ring, through the top, and back down, for raising the sock; these lines may be two ends of the same line, to form a loop. The head of the spinnaker is attached the top of the <b>sock</b> and the ring runs down to the tack. The resulting bundle is stuffed into the spinnaker bag. The top of the <b>sock</b> will have provisions for attaching to the spinnaker halyard.|$|R

5|$|As both Manchester United and Bayern Munich {{traditionally}} wore red {{as their}} primary kit colour, UEFA regulations would normally have required both teams to wear their change kits. However, the two clubs felt {{it would have been}} a shame for neither to wear their traditional colours, and they agreed to toss a coin to see who would have first choice. Manchester United won the toss and therefore wore their usual European colours of red shirts, white shorts and white <b>socks,</b> while Bayern wore silver shirts, shorts and <b>socks,</b> all with maroon trim.|$|E

The Baltimore Sun stated that William Abrose O'Malley was the cadet who caught Street's blocked kick and scored the second touchdown. The Sun also covered, in detail, the uniforms the squads wore; Johns Hopkins sported black and light blue striped jerseys and caps, with white pants and blue <b>socks.</b> The Naval Academy wore maroon <b>socks,</b> caps, and belts, with white pants and jerseys. Both teams also nailed strips of leather {{to the bottom of}} their shoes to help deal with slipping.|$|E

5|$|The French team {{traditionally}} {{played in}} blue shirts, white shorts, and red <b>socks,</b> {{the colors of}} the national flag, and as such were nicknamed les tricolores. Due to the mostly blue strip the French team currently wears, the team is now often referred to as les Bleus (the Blues), like many other French sporting teams. When this strip clashes with that of their opponents, such as in games against Scotland and Italy, French players wear white. New strips were developed for the 2007 World Cup, one of which is a darker blue. In June 2011 they relaunched another kit which they wear blue shirt, blue shorts and blue <b>socks</b> for their home kit and they wear white shirt, white shorts and white <b>socks</b> for their away kit.|$|E
