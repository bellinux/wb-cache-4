40|$|Oestrous cycles {{have been}} studied in mature does and pubertal animals of the small East African goat in a {{management}} system with peasant farmers in Uganda. Forty-seven percent (47 %) of the cycles were of normal length of approximately three weeks. Thirty percent (30 %) of the cycles were short being of a duration of two weeks or less. Twenty three percent (23 %) of the cycles were very long being of duration of two cycles or higher multiples. These were deemed {{to be due to}} <b>silent</b> <b>heat.</b> The endocrinological basis of the variation of the reproductive cycles and the possible consequences of infertility have been discussed.

40|$|Background: Buffaloes are <b>silent</b> <b>heat</b> {{animals and}} lacunae in their estrus {{detection}} results a substantial economic loss in developing countries. Many advanced tools to aid heat detection {{have been developed}} but are neither affordable nor easily interpretable by marginal farmers. Aim: The present investigation was made to develop a cost-effective estrus detection model by combining several known estrus predicting parameters. Materials and Methods: Various signs of estrus were classified under major parameters such as visual, cow behavioral, bull behavioral, biochemical, and gyneco-clinical. Expression of those parameters was observed in buffaloes, {{and the percentage of}} positive estrus detection was calculated for each combination of estrus prediction parameters. Results: The present result concludes that the model comprises of five parameters group with several signals with twentysix different combinations. It was observed that the expression of individual combinations and their corresponding estrus detection efficiency varies significantly, i. e., detection efficiency rises as the number of combination increases. Conclusion: Combination of three parameters would provide an estrus detection efficiency > 70...|$|E
40|$|Phytoestrogens are {{secondary}} metabolites {{produced by}} plants. Among {{the plants that}} make phytoestrogens are soya, red clover and some types of grass. The name phytoestrogen is a collective term for compounds such as genistein, daidzein, biochanin A and formononetin. These compounds are similar to oestradiol- 17 β in their chemical structure. Because of this similarity, they can attach to the same binding site as regular oestradiol- 17 β. These binding sites are receptors called alpha (ERα) and beta (ERβ). Phytoestrogen can cause certain problems when sheep graze on phytoestrogen rich grass. Sheep can get reproductive disorders such as producing fewer lambs or difficulty getting pregnant. Phytoestrogen like formononetin can however have positive effects. If grass contains low concentration of formononetin, {{we can see a}} clear weight gain in lambs. The same problem emerges in cow, when they are fed on red clover. Their reproductive disorders however, are slightly weaker than in sheep. One problem that can occur in cows fed on clover is <b>silent</b> <b>heat</b> because phytoestrogens are inhibiting the heat in some cows. Another problem associated with phytoestrogens is that they occur in milk in the form of equol. Soy is widely used in pet food because it is inexpensive and it is a rich source of protein. One effect that has been observed is an increase in total and free thyroxin (T 4) ...|$|E

During the months characterized by a decrease of reproductive activity it is necessary to use both progesterone determination in milk and prostaglandine administration. Trough these devices a greater number of useful ovulations can be obtained in 48 Hrs.

40|$|High ambient {{temperatures}} {{affect the}} secretion of sexual hormones in cows and heifers. As a result, {{the frequency of}} silent estrus can reach a high level during summer. In order to analyze the effects of heat stress on sexual behavior in Black and White Romanian heifers, a {{research has been conducted}} on four groups of animals in the pre- and post-AI interval. During spring, in conditions of thermal comfort and under the stimulating influence of increasing photoperiod, 83. 3 % of the heifers showed clear signs of estrus. Exposure to temperatures of 36 - 42 ○C by day and 21 - 31 ○C by night caused anoestrus: the heifers did not respond to repeated estrus-induction treatment. When hot days (33 - 38 ○C) alternated with tolerable temperatures by night (18 - 21 ○C), a normal expression of estrus was noticed in 16. 7 % of the animals, while 33. 3 % experienced weak estrus and 50 % did not exhibit sexual behavior. In conditions of moderate thermal stress, with peaks of daily temperature ranging from 28 to 34 ○C, clear signs of estrus were detected in 25 % of the heifers and weak symptoms in 41. 7 %, while 33. 3 % had <b>silent</b> <b>heat,</b> clinically diagnosed.

40|$|Livestock housing {{conditions}} {{are an important}} determinant of animal behaviour and health. The objective of the present work was to elucidate the influence of some important housing factors on the occurrence of production diseases in dairy cattle and to clarify the relationship between experimental and observational methods {{in the study of}} disease patterns in dairy herds. The importance of the animals’ cleanliness is emphasized and consequences for their behaviour, cleanliness, health and well-being of different types of tie-stall equipment are considered. In particular, the influence of electric cow-trainers on the animals’ health and welfare is discussed in light of the present work and previous research. Important effects on foot, leg and udder health in relation to a transition from tie-stalls to loose housing systems are also dealt with. Effects of electric cow-trainers on common clinical diseases, reproductive performance and risk of culling were studied by comparing lactation records from Swedish cow-trainer herds with historical and contemporary control records in herds without cow-trainers. Exposure to cow-trainers increased the incidence risk of <b>silent</b> <b>heat,</b> clinical mastitis and ketosis, and changed <b>silent</b> <b>heat</b> from being a neutral disease with respect to culling to a major risk factor. The cow-trainers increased the general negative effect of diseases on the cows’ reproductive performance and risk of culling. The influence of a rubber slat flooring system for tie-stalls on animal behaviour, cleanliness and foot health was studied in a controlled trial during two housing periods in an experimental dairy herd. In half of the stalls, the rearmost part of the solid flooring was replaced with nine rubber-coated 53 mm wide slats, divided by 29 -mm slots. Stalls with rubber slats were equipped with ethyl-vinyl-acetate mats in the front part and littered with small amounts of wood shavings daily, while stalls with a solid floor had standard rubber mats and received large amounts of chopped straw daily as bedding. Cows on the rubber slatted floor lay down more easily than those on the solid floor, and rose normally and without any increased risk of slipping. However, there was some evidence of a preference for a solid floor when lying. Cows on the rubber slatted floor were much less dirty on their hindparts than those on the solid floor, and at hoof trimming, the prevalence of hygiene-related foot lesions in hind feet was several times lower in the rubber slat system. In order to study the effects of changes in housing system on foot/leg and udder health, retrospectively collected monthly herd records from Swedish dairy herds were utilized. Significant increases in the incidence of veterinary-treated foot and leg disorders were found up to 18 months after changing from tie-stalls to cubicles and the incidences of clinical mastitis and teat injuries were decreased beyond 18 months after changing from tie-stalls to cubicles or straw yards. Later than 18 months after rebuilding, herds that shifted from long-stalls to short-stalls had less foot and leg lesions than those remaining in long-stalls...|$|E
40|$|Investigates {{the effects}} of non genetic factors on performance, and {{estimates}} genetic parameters of reproductive and productive traits {{with a view to}} examining the appropriateness of the assumed parameters. Presents an evaluation of a long-term breeding programme in a closed Sahiwal herd in Kenya and presents data on means, standard deviations and coefficients of variation for the traits studied. The present breeding management at the Sahiwal stud requires that heifers be mated when they are 27 months old and are weighing between 260 to 270 kg. The estimate of mean age at first calving indicates that heifers were not able to attain the required weight until they were over 29 months. Indeed the age-weight requirement is unrealistic and is partially responsible for late age at first calving. In addition to this, there is a lower-than-expected growth rate at the stud. However, the increased age at first calving may also be a reflection of poor heat detection. Poor feeding is likely to affect age at first calving through its effect on growth rate and hence age at puberty. Moreover, nutritionally - induced <b>silent</b> <b>heat</b> may not only affect service period and calving interval but, through its effect on age at first service, does also affect age at first calving. The mean calving interval of 426 d was shorter than reported for the Sahiwal breed in India, but was longer than for Bos taurus breeds in Kenya and elsewhere. However, most reported estimates of calving intervals for indigenous breeds have been in herds using natural mating...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} an induced copper (Cu) {{deficiency}} on the fertility of South Africa Mutton Merino ewes (Ovis aries) was investigated. The incidence of oestrus of adult ewes suffering from an induced Cu deficiency by supplementing molybdenum (Mo - 38 mg Mo/kg feed) and sulphur (S - 0. 34 %) to their diet {{was compared to}} that of a control group (Mo - 1. 3 mg/kg; S 0. 22 %). Although no significant differences in plasma progesterone concentrations were recorded during the oestrus cycles, 75 % of the four-to-six-tooth experimental ewes (Cu deficient) stopped showing signs of behavioral oestrus (<b>silent</b> <b>heats)</b> after 6 weeks on the diets (middle May). In Trial 2, 5 -month-old ewes (n = 13) reaching puberty were used. The effects of an induced Cu deficiency on plasma progesterone concentrations, shortly after reaching puberty, were investigated. According to the plasma progesterone concentrations during the oestrus cycle, Cu deficiency resulted in ewes going into a state of anoestrus approximately 2 - 4 weeks earlier (May-June) {{at the end of the}} active breeding season. Although the older ewes (four-to-six-tooth) still ovulated they did not show any signs of oestrus compared to the younger ewes which stopped ovulating. Articl...|$|R
40|$|To {{determine}} {{the change in}} distribution of ewes exhibiting oestrus at {{the first and second}} oestrous cycles after progestagen treatment, data were examined from six experiments in which 430 ewes received progestagens but experienced no fertile mating at the first post-treatment oestrus. Three progestagens, three breeds and two seasons were involved. In all experiments there were more <b>silent</b> <b>heats</b> at the first as compared with the second post-treatment cycle; hence more ewes were available for mating at the second cycle. Among 326 ewes which exhibited oestrus at both cycles, standard deviations about the mean day of oestrus ranged in the six groups from * 0. 47 to t 1. 13 days for the first oestrus and from t 0. 85 to t 1. 44 days for the second oestrus. Because of the increased dispersion at the second cycle, a higher percentage of ewes exhibited oestrus during the peak three days of the first cycle than {{was the case with the}} second. The number of heats falling within three days at the first cycle approximately equalled the numbers fall-ing within four to five days at the second cycle. It is concluded that in some circumstances it may be advantageous to delay mating until the second cycle. I...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Previous {{studies have}} shown that the TRPV 1 ion channel plays a {{critical}} role in the development of heat hyperalgesia after inflammation, as inflamed TRPV 1 -/- mice develop mechanical allodynia but fail to develop thermal hyperalgesia. In order to further investigate the role of TRPV 1, we have used an ex vivo skin/nerve/DRG preparation to examine the effects of CFA-induced-inflammation on the response properties of TRPV 1 -positive and TRPV 1 -negative cutaneous nociceptors. Results In wildtype mice we found that polymodal C-fibers (CPMs) lacking TRPV 1 were sensitized to heat within a day after CFA injection. This sensitization included both a drop in average heat threshold and an increase in firing rate to a heat ramp applied to the skin. No changes were observed in the mechanical response properties of these cells. Conversely, TRPV 1 -positive mechanically insensitive, heat sensitive fibers (CHs) were not sensitized following inflammation. However, results suggested that some of these fibers may have gained mechanical sensitivity and that some previous <b>silent</b> fibers gained <b>heat</b> sensitivity. In mice lacking TRPV 1, inflammation only decreased heat threshold of CPMs but did not sensitize their responses to the heat ramp. No CH-fibers could be identified in naïve nor inflamed TRPV 1 -/- mice. Conclusions Results obtained here suggest that increased heat sensitivity in TRPV 1 -negative CPM fibers alone following inflammation is insufficient for the induction of heat hyperalgesia. On the other hand, TRPV 1 -positive CH fibers appear to play an essential role in this process that may include both afferent and efferent functions. </p...|$|R
40|$|By {{using the}} Seebeck effect to produce {{electrical}} voltage, thermoelectric {{as a highly}} scalable, stationary and <b>silent</b> <b>heat</b> engine has undergone a state of vigorous research. Starting with the review on thermoelectric generators, it shows that thermoelectric is gaining more attention since the past decade. Generally, the research conducted on the thermoelectric generators concentrate on the material development, mathematical and numerical model development {{as well as the}} application of thermoelectric generators. For this article, attention is given to the application research of the thermoelectric generators. From the survey conducted, most of the application research carried out is based on intermittent electrical power generation (e. g. the direct use of solar energy available or waste heat recovery). Hence, it opens an opportunity for the research on the application of thermoelectric generators by utilising a heat source that is continuously ready for thermal-electrical energy conversion, such as phase change material, geothermal heat or solar pond. In the later section, the review is continued by introducing solar pond, a facility that {{has been used as a}} supply of low-grade heat source at the remote area or industrial process heating. The research on the fundamentals of solar pond and its applications, but not limited to, the power generation has also been summarised. The ultimate idea of this review is to provide an insight that a thermal-storage based heat source (e. g. in this review, the solar pond) could be useful for small-scale electric power generation, despite its ordinary function as low-grade heat source provider via heat extraction...|$|E

40|$|The {{research}} and development of SMA based actuator mechanisms are being pursued at many places. In this paper the on going {{research and}} development efforts at ACD, NAL to realize a SMA based actuator mechanism for deployment of a control surface model is discussed. The mechanism can be modified to either give a rotary or a linear output. The deployment of this control surface model was successfully demonstrated using the SMA based rotary actuator mechanism along with computerised powering devices and controls. This control surface model is deployed only during landing in order to improve the landing characteristics of the aircraft and remains retracted at all other times. The real challenge is the design and development of the SMA based mechanism, which will satisfy the weight and volume budget and more importantly consume minimum power. An innovative 3 -gear relay arrangement was chosen primarily to save the power. In this type of arrangement 3 different input gears mounted on 3 independent input shafts are used to drive the same output shaft on which the control surface model is mounted. Independent banks of SMA wires drive each of the 3 input shafts. The actuation of the input shafts is done in a sequential manner and each them rotates the control surface model by different angles. At any given time only one bank of SMA is energized and therefore the power consumption reduces significantly in contrast to a case where the complete rotation of the control surface model has to be effected by a single input shaft power by a single bank of SMA. The state of art electronics and controls in order to achieve the above sequential actuation include miniaturized power devices, data acquisition, and controller of SMA actuation and health monitoring of SMA. The actuators have both hysterisis and non-linearity especially during the phase transformation when the electrical resistance changes abruptly. SMAs can be actuated by heating using external heaters or by resistive heating. For better control, high efficiency, compactness and <b>silent</b> operation, resistive <b>heating</b> is preferred. Individual miniaturized power devices (DC-DC converters) are developed to electrically isolate the SMA actuators. Adequate redundancy in terms of both mechanical actuators and powering devices is built in...|$|R
