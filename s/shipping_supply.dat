This attack on the dry dock behind enemy lines was an attempt to neutralise the ability of the German battleship Tirpitz to attack Atlantic supply lines to Britain as the dry dock at St. Nazaire was the only dock on the Atlantic coast of occupied France large enough to accommodate the Tirptiz and, as base, would allow the German battleship to attack British <b>shipping</b> <b>supply</b> lines.

40|$|The rate {{at which}} vessels are loaded and {{unloaded}} has a bearing on turnaround time and therefore on the required size of the fleet. This paper shows that the loading rate also has a bearing on schedule reliability. When schedules are unstable vessel bunching can occur, leading to less frequent services operated by bunches of vessels. This greatly affects the average inventory throughout the <b>shipping</b> <b>supply</b> chain network. It is shown that schedule stability requires the loading rate {{to be at least}} twice the {{rate at which}} containers to be loaded accumulate in the yard. Analytical expressions are derived for the arrival headways variance at the second and third ports of call. This paper extends on previous work on this topic by considering both loading and unloading of containers. Countermeasures to restore schedule stability are considered.

40|$|Storage and {{transportation}} of goods within global supply chains is {{a major cause of}} environmental damage in modern value added processes. Thus, in the past, theory and practice developed several approaches in order to decrease these negative environmental impacts that frequently counteract the traditional efficiency-oriented ambitions. However, in many cases the economic and environmental performance can be improved at the same time. As many activities in logistics and inventory management are related to the treatment of potential uncertainties in the system by establishing redundancies, the reduction of uncertainty has equally a positive impact on both performance measures. To investigate the interrelation between uncertainty and the economic and environmental performance of supply chains, a serial inventory system consisting of a manufacturer who works with overseas suppliers and a carrier is considered, whereas the carrier is able to reduce lead time uncertainty. The relationships between uncertainties and the economic and environmental performance of the considered inventory system are highlighted by a simulation study based on empirical data from an international container <b>shipping</b> <b>supply</b> chain...|$|E
40|$|Economically {{motivated}} adulteration {{of imported}} food poses {{a serious threat}} to public health, and has contributed to several poisoning incidents {{in the past few years}} in the U. S. [1]. Prevention is achieved by sampling food shipments coming to the U. S. However, the sampling resources are limited: all shipments are electronically sampled [2], but only a small percentage of shipments are physically inspected. In an effort to mitigate risk in <b>shipping</b> <b>supply</b> chains, we develop a data-driven approach to identify risky shippers and manufacturers exporting food to the U. S., as well as U. S. based consignees and importers receiving imported products. We focus our analysis on honey and shrimp, two products that are routinely imported and frequently adulterated. We obtain over 62, 000 bills of lading of honey entering the U. S. between 2006 and 2015 from public sources, and over a million shipment records of shrimp entering the U. S. between 2007 and 2015 from the Food and Drugs Administration (FDA). We analyze these data to identify common patterns between high risk shippers, manufacturers, U. S. consignees and importers, and use them to determine structural features of <b>shipping</b> <b>supply</b> chains that correlate with risk of adulteration. In our analysis of shrimp manufacturers, we distinguish two types of adulteration: intentional (driven by economic motivation) and unintentional (due to negligence or poor sanitary conditions). We use a Bayesian approach to model both the sampling or inspection procedure of the FDA, and the risk of adulteration. Our model is able to predict which companies are at risk of committing adulteration with high out-of-sample accuracy. We find that both geographical features (e. g., travel route, country of origin and transnational paths) and network features (e. g., number of partners, weight dispersion and diversity of the product portfolio) are significant and predictive of suspicious behavior. These outcomes can inform various decisions faced by the FDA in their sampling policy for honey and shrimp shipments, and their site inspection policy for consignees and importers. This work can also extend to other commodities with similar mechanisms, and provides a general framework to better detect food safety failures and mitigate risk in food supply chains. by Amine Anoun.

40|$|Integrated {{supply chain}} {{management}} is becoming increasingly recognised as a core competitiveness for business. This is putting increased demands on freight transport services. Transport services should contribute to adding value, and the value added by transport can be significant if the operations {{take place in a}} well organised, efficient and market responsive transport system. This study aims to develop an original modelling approach for estimating supply chain value, and empirically focuses on a major world trade facilitator - container shipping. The paper presents the multivariate ordered probit/ logit models and the empirical results. Based on comprehensive literature review and conceptual theory building, a normative model for managing container <b>shipping</b> <b>supply</b> chains with the aim for better synchronisation and ultimately for value (i. e. profit for commercial setting) maximisation is proposed. A survey instrument is used to empirically verify the model with the data given by professionals from the world's top thirty container shipping lines. It is found that the level of supply chain integration is positively related to the supply chain value and profit. Overall, customer service activities are the most influential factor in affecting the supply chain value. Hence, we suggest firms to devote more resources and efforts in: 1) promoting supply chain collaboration; 2) upgrading customer service activities at strategic, tactical and operational levels. Other implications and recommendations are generated according to the empirical results...|$|E
40|$|Liner {{shipping}} {{firms have}} long {{argued that the}} task of providing adequate service to shippers while earning reasonable rates of return on capital requires at least some form of limited antitrust immunity. Carriers contend that because scheduling requirements unique to liner shipping firms constrains their ability to adjust capacity to meet market conditions, liner shipping capacity is essentially fixed {{in the short term}} while demand is variable. And because individual firms have incentive to minimise unit costs by maximising capacity utilisation on every voyage, the threat of destructive price wars looms large. Consequently, carriers have advocated that governments leave them free to form collusive arrangements called conferences in which members are free to meet to discuss and fix prices. But how rigid is liner shipping capacity? Because of a lack of useable data on prices and capacity, this question has never been resolved empirically. But recently, new data have become available from public and industry sources that permit researchers to look more deeply into this issue. In this paper, those data are used to estimate a partial adjustment, distributed lag supply function for liner shipping services in US trade lanes. The results reveal that, on the major US import trade lanes, liner <b>shipping</b> <b>supply</b> curve exhibits more flexibility than the ‘stylised facts’ of the industry would suggest.

40|$|This study {{seeks to}} {{identify}} {{the means by which}} information technology helps cocreate relational value in the context of interfirm relationships in the logistics industry—a large and information-intensive industry. We identify a set of IT functionalities—single-location shipping, multilocation <b>shipping,</b> <b>supply</b> chain visibility, and financial settlement—that can be used to manage the flows of physical goods, information, and finances across locations in interfirm logistics processes. Progressively more advanced sets of IT functionalities, when implemented and used in the interfirm relationship to execute logistics processes, are proposed to form four distinct IT capability profiles of increased sophistication. Interfirm IT capability profiles of higher sophistication are proposed to help cocreate greater relational value by facilitating the flows of physical goods, information, and finances across locations in the interfirm logistics process. Besides their direct role in helping cocreate relational value, these interfirm IT capability profiles are proposed to further enhance relational value cocreation when complemented by interfirm communications for business development and IT development. Our empirical study was situated in one of the world’s largest logistics suppliers and over 2, 000 of its interfirm relationships with buyers across industries. Integrated data from four archival sources on the IT functionalities implemented and used in interfirm logistics relationships, interfirm communications, relational value (share of wallet and loyalty), and multiple control variables were collected. The results show that the proposed interfirm IT capability profiles and interfirm communications have both a direct and an interaction effect on relational value. Implications for cocreating relational value in interfirm relationships with the aid of IT are discussed...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{outlines the}} drivers and barriers {{of renewable energy}} in the electrification of Vanuatu and provides recommendations {{as to how the}} drivers can be harnessed and barriers overcome. It is based on a review of academic and other literature, observations during work undertaken by the author in Vanuatu, and a survey of renewable energy professionals in the Pacific region. It concludes that the drivers and barriers prevalent in Vanuatu, a least developed country and small island developing state, may be of greater magnitude than some other developing countries due to particular cultural, geographical, historical, and political circumstances. Moreover, some of the drivers of renewable energy development can exacerbate these barriers, e. g. a strong willingness by donor aid agencies to undertake renewable energy projects and an influx of foreign aid may be premature and unwise when there is insufficient absorptive capacity. Furthermore, as renewable energy is only one part of the solution to mitigating against climate change and the social and environmental impacts of using fossil fuels, as well as reducing the current economic dependency on petroleum products, it should be viewed holistically alongside other complementary endeavours. Implementing strategies to improve energy efficiency, energy conservation, energy demand management, and petroleum procurement also assist in solving these problems and may allow enough time for sufficient absorptive capacity in renewable energy to develop. However, this capacity should not be developed in isolation, but rather using a long term approach in conjunction with broader developments in education, health, governance and infrastructure that is complementary to that of the supply of electricity, e. g. information and communication technologies, roads, <b>shipping,</b> <b>supply</b> chains, and water supplies. In this context, the dissertation recommends that a number of policies and measures be implemented to ensure the further development of renewable energy in the electrification of Vanuatu...|$|E
40|$|This thesis explores {{a variety}} of {{logistics}} strategies for Qualcomm Wireless Business Solutions (QWBS), focusing on the OmniTRACS system and MVPc display. I develop and apply a model that considers the interactions of inventory processing and inventory movement {{in the context of}} total supply chain costs. My goal is to minimize purchased product inventory while reducing product lead-times. Without a formal model, supply chain organization decisions tend to replicate existing designs because it is difficult to find a better solution by trial and error due to the numerous alternatives and the number of variables involved. To develop an understanding of the issues at QWBS, I began by researching technology manufacturing supply chains. I also developed a cost model for analyzing QWBS's supply chain. The final form of this model is a series of spreadsheets which accepts cost data, lead times, and variable demand as key inputs, and produces overall supply chain cost distributions. The supply chain is modeled as a series of processing nodes and transfer links. The model derives its results by simulating variable demand and summing the cost contributions of the nodes and links for each trial. The supply chain research and the cost model provide Qualcomm with a realistic and usable tool to compare both intra- and inter-company supply chain designs in terms of overall channel costs. Furthermore, my results suggest that QWBS should focus its direct <b>shipping</b> <b>supply</b> chain efforts on customers whose demand variation is smaller than QWBS's overall customer average. by John Creighton.

40|$|The {{functioning}} of communities and industries depend on infrastructure network. Daily activities (such as production, <b>shipping,</b> <b>supply</b> chain, etc. for industries and commuting for work, business, schooling, etc. for communities) are performed efficiently {{with the help}} of infrastructure network. It is vital for infrastructure to function efficiently at all the times. However, during disasters, either manmade or natural, the functioning or serviceability of infrastructure could be severely affected. This in turn has an impact on the activities/services of communities and industries. These activities and services contribute socially and economically. When their functioning is affected and usually reduced in case of disasters, their social and economic contribution is reduced. This reduction can be assessed as social and economic impact on communities and industries due to reduction in serviceability of infrastructure network. ^ This research proposes a framework that explains the flow of disaster impact from damaged infrastructure to communities and industries. The flow of disasters is based on the relationship that is established between activities of communities and industries and related infrastructure. The framework identifies activities as an important factor for measuring social and economic impact. ^ The research also proposes a Severity Assessment Tool (SAT) which is based on the aforesaid relationship. The tool uses analytic hierarchy process (AHP) for prioritization of activities based on social/economic contribution they offer and infrastructure required for supporting activities based on the assistance level they can provide. The tool uses excel spreadsheets for performing simulation using Monte Carlo technique. The results are interpreted using frequency diagrams in terms of social and economic impacts. ^ This model would help the city managers and emergency response agencies in understanding the social and economic impact of disasters on communities and the associated industries and would assist them in preparing appropriate disaster mitigation strategies. ...|$|E
