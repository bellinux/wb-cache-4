40|$|In recent years, passanger {{train speed}} and freight train load have {{increased}} to enhance efficiency of rail road transportation. These trends {{have increased the}} severity of rail service conditions, calling for rails with greager wear resistance, strength and fatigue behavior. In the United States and Europe, track <b>site</b> <b>weld</b> rails are made entirely by alumino thermic process. This work describe the results of experimental study conducted on bending fatigue strength of plain rails and alumino thermic welded rails with preheating procedures (oxipropane and air-induced propane) approved by railways authorities. Compliance with the required fatigue strength shall be ascertained by 4 point pulsating bending test in accordance with European standard by alumino thermic weld in rails. The Locati method, based in the empirical Miner's law about the cumulative damage on a fatigue tested material, allows, once known the Wohler curve of the welding process in use to settle the fatigue tensile limit at 50 % with only one test. The values obtained at 2. 10 cycles for plain rails (Sf = 353 MPa), oxipropane preheated aluminothermic weld rails (Sf = 225 MPa), and propane-air induced aluminothermic weld rails (Sf = 210 MPa) {{are very similar to}} those resulting from test method stated in the European Standard. From our point of view and due to its ease, speediness and savings, this is the most suitable test to check the quality and compare the aluminothermic processes in use. En los últimos años la eficiencia de los FECC, tanto para el transporte de viajeros como de mercancías, ha experimentado un desarrollo espectacular. Ello, ha sido posible gracias, entre otros factores, a la fabricación de carriles con resistencia al desgaste, carga de rotura y resistencia a fatiga mejoradas. La soldadura de los carriles, en Europa y U. S. A. se realiza "in situ" por aluminotermia con precalentamiento de los carriles con oxipropano o propano-aire inducido. Los ensayos de fatiga de los carriles soldados se llevan a cabo por flexión en cuatro puntos en concordancia con la norma europea. El método Locati, descrito en esta nota, está basado en la Ley de Miner de daño acumulado y en las curvas de Wohler del material ensayado. Permite calcular, con precisión suficiente, las tensiones límites de fatiga al 50 %. Así, los valores obtenidos, en ensayos a dos millones de ciclos, para carriles sin soldar (Sf = 353 MPa), carriles soldados con precalentamiento de oxipropano (Sf = 225 MPa) y carriles soldados con precalentamiento de propano-aire inducido (Sf = 210 MPa) son muy similares y aceptables a los estipulados por los métodos de determinación del límite de fatiga según norma europea. Debido a la comodidad, rapidez y bajo coste del método Locati resulta, en nuestra opinión, muy adecuado para el control de calidad de los procesos de soldadura aluminotérmica en vigor, de carriles de alta resistencia...|$|E

DOE-RL met with key contractor personnel prior to and during contract transition to ensure <b>site</b> <b>welding</b> activities had appropriate oversight and maintained code compliance. The transition also provided an opportunity to establish a single site-wide function that would provide welding and materials engineering services to the Hanford site contractors: CH 2 M HILL Plateau Remediation Company (CHPRC); Mission Support Alliance (MSA); Washington River Protection Solutions (WRPS); and Washington Closure Hanford (WCH). Over the years, multiple and separate welding programs (amongst the several contractors) existed at the Hanford site leading to inefficiencies resulting from duplication of administrative efforts, maintenance of welding procedures, welder performance certifications, etc. The new, single program eliminates these inefficiencies.

40|$|One of {{the trends}} in ship {{building}} is {{the building of}} larger and faster ships. However, increasing demand for speed has forced the ship designers to search for alternative materials to reduce {{the weight of the}} ship without compromising strength. Aluminium alloys, once properly designed, can achieve this goal by reducing the weight of structural components by over 50 % compared to those made of normal carbon steel. Another advantage of aluminium alloys is that its corrosion resistance. In a sea environment, steel has been found to corrode about 100 times faster than aluminium alloys under the same corrosive environment. As the size of aluminium ship increases, fatigue {{has become one of the}} main design criteria. In order to effectively make use of the high strength/weight ratio of aluminium alloys, the cross section of the structural components as well as the joint design should be optimized to provide sufficient fatigue strength while still maintain acceptable fabrication cost. Extruded hollow stiffeners have been proven to be able to provide excellent light and stiff panels for aluminium ships. Box stiffener is such a cross section profile investigated in the present study. The box stiffener is usually oriented longitudinally by interacting with a large number of web frames by fillet welds. These welded joints may be exposed to larger fatigue damage due to its significant stress variations experienced during the service of the ships. In addition, welding of these joints is quite costly since there are a lage amount of them and it is difficult to apply automatic welding due to complex profile. Any simplification in the welding procedure would cause a significant benefit to the ship builders. Three similar web frame/box stiffener connections are considered in these studies, by varying the opening shape on the web fame and accordingly the welding procedure. The objective is to achieve sufficient fatigue strength while still maintaining an economically efficient joint. The first connection (denoted as Alt- 1) tries to make a relatively larger opening on the web frame for easy assembling and more space for welding. The second and third alternatives (denoted as Alt- 2 and Alt- 3) are identical in the opening on the web frame while differs on welding procedure only. Interrupted welding is performed for Alt- 2 to save both the human resource and weld material while continuous welding is required for Alt- 3 for a simple welding procedure. Alt- 3 also provides a water tight solution due to the continuous welding. It is found that the change of cutting shapes on the web frame as well as the corresponding weld procedure has great impact on both the static and fatigue properties of the joints. Extra welding around the web frame may cause a high stress concentration at the weld toe and therefore imply an unacceptable fatigue damage. However, a simple weld can be a good candidate to achieve sufficient fatigue strength. Butt weld is usually used to join two pre-fabricated units to obtain sufficient overall strength of the joined single piece structure. However, difficulty may arise for such units when the box stiffeners are presented as the longitudinal stiffeners due to relatively large shrinkage and distortion introduced in the fabrication process including welding in the adjacent area. A special type of lap joint, denoted as box stiffener lap joint is designed to provide a joining solution for the box stiffeners. By enabling the inside profile of the lapping plate to be identical to the outside profile of the box stiffener, the joining of two box stiffeners is just to weld the intersection lines between the lapping plate and box stiffener. Only the wide flanges of the box stiffener require a conventional weld. Cracking from the weld root should be avoided to ensure sufficient fatigue strength. Good fatigue performance is observed for the box stiffener lap joint. The weld leg length is found to be a determining factor that affects both the fatigue strength and fatigue crack initiation <b>site.</b> <b>Weld</b> leg length between 6. 0 and 7. 5 mm is suggested to avoid high stress concentration at the weld toe. Moreover, this design reduces the likelihood of fatigue cracks to initiate from the most complex manual welding area. Information about fatigue analysis of welded aluminium structures is quite limited in the open literature. This thesis deals with fatigue assessment methods of welded aluminium plate structures based on both numerical analysis and experimental tests. Various stress based fatigue assessment methods such as the nominal, structural and notch stress approaches have been applied to the investigated joints. The nominal stress range approach can not provide a satisfactory prediction of the fatigue strength of novel welded joints because the local geometrical details including structural geometry and weld geometry are implicitly embedded in the nominal design SN curves. Laboratory tests would hence be needed to establish nominal stress approaches. More refined local approaches including the structural stress range approach and the notch stress range approach have been developed for a more accurate assessment of the fatigue strength. The main challenge for these local approaches is to find suitable stress calculation methods in the vicinity of the weld and thereby the uncertainties that determine the fatigue strength of the joint can be quantitatively reflected in a local stress concentration factor. Several of these methods are applied in the study of novel types of welded aluminium joints in this thesis. The choice of design SN curves must be consistent with the way by which the design stress range is calculated. Fatigue test data support the use of a structural stress design SN curve of fatigue class 40 for the fatigue assessment of aluminium fillet welded in-plane bracket connections when the structural stress has been derived from the extrapolation methods. It has been shown that a structural stress design SN curve of fatigue class 44 for the fatigue assessment of aluminium lap joints can be used. Another important issue is to investigate the effect of the local weld geometry such as the weld toe angle, weld toe radius, and weld leg length on the value of the structural/notch stress and accordingly on fatigue behaviour. The weld parameters of the joints have been measured in the laboratory and the statistical measured values are used in the numerical finite element models (FEM). Improving fatigue strength of critical joints is found to be necessary late in the design process or during the service time of a structure to extend the whole service life of the structure. The effect of weld toe grinding on the stress concentration at the weld toe is studied by finite element analysis (FEA). Fatigue tests show that the fatigue life in terms of number of cycles to failure is nearly doubled by simply grinding the weld toe of the joint. However, the standard deviations are not so much affected as the fatigue strength. The effect of weld parameters such as the grinding depth has been found to play a decisive role in fatigue life improvement. </p...|$|E

50|$|Gas metal {{arc welding}} (GMAW), {{commonly}} called MIG (for metal/inert-gas), is a semi-automatic or automatic welding process with a continuously fed consumable wire acting as both electrode and filler metal, along with an inert or semi-inert shielding gas flowed around the wire to protect the <b>weld</b> <b>site</b> from contamination.

Other purposes are to develop the numerical procedure of determining the fracture strength of the steel moment connection using linear elastic fracture mechanics, and the probabilistic analyses of brittle fractures of connections. The steel moment connection failures during the 1994 Northridge earthquake and the design philosophy are reviewed and the post-Northridge earthquake experimental and analytical researches are examined. Possible causes of the steel moment connection failures are categorized into welding-related factors, design-related factors, and material-related factors. For the analyses, the idealizations of the steel moment connections considering each factor are studied. The stress concentration and the sate of stress of the connection are investigated using an idealized five-plate moment connection model. The brittle fracture strength of the welded-flange bolted web connection with backing bars is studied using linear elastic fracture mechanics. Post-Northridge connection tests are simulated using the finite element method. An edge crack is assumed at the column-weld interface to represent crack-like defects and other adverse effects. The energy release rate at the front of the edge crack at the failure load of the test is studied using the J-integral method. From post-Northridge connection test results and a finite element model, the effective fracture toughness of the column-weld interface is investigated. The effective fracture toughness is the maximum energy release rate of the material at the front of the crack at the failure load. A new method of calculating the brittle fracture strength of the connection is suggested using the effective fracture toughness. The validity of the suggested method is investigated through numerical examples. Based on the suggested method, the probability of brittle fracture of the connection is investigated using a sample weld defect distribution and a yield stress distribution. In addition, possible applications of this method are discussed. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{fatigue life}} of steel bridge {{structures}} is often governed by their fatigue performance. In many fatigue design standards, welded joints {{are divided into}} a number of different classes, each class having its own S-N curves for use in design calculations. In the fatigue design of bridges, the choice of suitable fatigue detail category is important to determine the life of the bridges. The fatigue design rules in current standards, at least most of them, are not really relevant to the design of orthotropic decks because they are generally meant for simple structures. For the choice of the detail category in the orthotropic bridge deck design there are certain difficulties and unsafeness for the designers because in such decks the stress analysis and classification of details are complex and beyond the scope of the standards. The aim of this master thesis is to theoretically analyze the fatigue strengths of the various joints, which typically occur in orthotropic steel plate deck bridges and box girder bridges, {{to be used in the}} design of these kinds of bridges by collecting fatigue tests that have been carried out by the researchers. Afterwards the results of the tests are evaluated and a summary of joint classifications emanating from these test results is set out in the tables. The orthotropic steel plate deck bridges are complex and sensitive to fatigue damage. Analysis of these constructions showed that the trough to cross-beam connection is the most sensitive link in an orthotropic bridge deck. Trough to deck plate connection is another sensitive welded joint, which is prone to fatigue cracking through the weld root as well as the weld toe. This joint is classified as C 71 with butt weld and C 50 with fillet weld by EC 3 (Eurocode 3). The results from the fatigue tests coincide with these classifications. The longitudinal trough stiffeners are usually fitted by positional <b>site</b> <b>welding,</b> for instance overhead welding, and their adequacy is therefore of great importance. The results from the site simulated tests showed that the butt-welded splice with a baking strip has the most sufficient fatigue strength. The steel box girder bridges are often chosen of their great torsional rigidity. Even though the steel box girder bridges are often stiffened by longitudinal welded stiffeners these construction are not sensitive to the fatigue as much as orthotropic steel bridge decks. If the crack propagation rate can be estimated reasonably well, this knowledge can give more efficient scheduling of repairs before the construction collapses totally. The test results showed that the box special girders that tested and analyzed have good resistance to long fatigue cracks, which can grow up to 1. 5 m...|$|R
