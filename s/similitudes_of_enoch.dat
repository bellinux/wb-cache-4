50|$|Notable {{examples}} {{among the}} body of texts known as Old Testament pseudepigrapha include the disputed authenticity of <b>Similitudes</b> <b>of</b> <b>Enoch</b> and 4 Ezra which in the form transmitted by Christian scribal traditions contain arguably later Christian understanding of terms such as Son of man. Other texts suffering significant Christian interpolation include Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs, Sibylline Oracles and so on.|$|E
5000|$|Isaiah {{was one of}} {{the most}} popular works in the period between the {{foundation}} of the Second Temple c. 515 BCE and its destruction by the Romans in 70 CE. Isaiah's [...] "shoot which will come up from the stump of Jesse" [...] is alluded to or cited in the Psalms of Solomon and various apocalyptic works including the <b>Similitudes</b> <b>of</b> <b>Enoch,</b> 2 Baruch, 4 Ezra, and the third of the Sibylline oracles, all of which understood it to refer to a/the messiah and the messianic age. Isaiah 6, in which Isaiah describes his vision of God enthroned in the Temple, influenced the visions of God in works such as the [...] "Book of the Watchers" [...] section of the Book of Enoch, the Book of Daniel and others, often combined with the similar vision from the Book of Ezekiel. A very influential portion of Isaiah was the four so-called Songs of the Suffering Servant from Isaiah 42, 49, 50 and 52, in which God calls upon his servant to lead the nations (the servant is horribly abused, sacrifices himself in accepting the punishment due others, and is finally rewarded). Some Second Temple texts, including the Wisdom of Solomon and the Book of Daniel identified the Servant as a group - [...] "the wise" [...] who [...] "will lead many to righteousness" [...] (Daniel 12:3) - but others, notably the <b>Similitudes</b> <b>of</b> <b>Enoch,</b> understood it in messianic terms. The earliest Christians, building on this second tradition, interpreted Isaiah 52:13-53:12, the fourth of the songs, as a prophecy of the death and exaltation of Jesus, a role which Jesus himself accepted according to Luke 4:17-21.|$|E
40|$|In {{this article}} the Baptist is {{compared}} with the upper-class/literate millennialists behind the Psalms of Solomon, the Testament <b>of</b> Moses, the <b>Similitudes</b> <b>of</b> 1 <b>Enoch,</b> and the Qumran scrolls on the one hand, and with the lower-class/illiterate millennialist movements in Josephus on the other hand. The argument is developed in constant dialogue with the analyses of John Dominic Crossan. After an initial statement of historical facts about the Baptist, these are {{compared with the}} named groups in terms of each one’s (1) criticism of the social-political and religious status quo, (2) depiction of the imagined mediator through whom God was expected to intervene, (3) portrayal of the violent/non-violent intervention of God and the group respectively, and (4) social ethics. It is concluded that John shows closer resemblance to the literate than illiterate millennialists, and should therefore rather {{be considered as a}} dissident retainer.

5000|$|While Daniel 7:13 [...] "like {{a son of}} man" [...] {{probably}} did not stand for the Messiah, where the phrase appears in extant versions of later apocryphal and deuterocanonical works such as the <b>Similitudes</b> <b>of</b> <b>Enoch</b> and 4 Ezra gave it this interpretation. Whether these messianic [...] "Son of Man" [...] references are genuinely Jewish or the result of Christian interpolation is disputed. An example of a disputed section is that of The Similitudes (1 Enoch 37-71) which uses Daniel 7 to produce an unparalleled messianic Son of Man, pre-existent and hidden yet ultimately revealed, functioning as judge, vindicator of righteousness, and universal ruler. The Enochic messianic figure is an individual representing a group, (the Righteous One who represents the righteous, the Elect One representing the elect), but in [...] (also called 2 Esdras) he becomes an individual man.|$|E
40|$|Bibliography: pages 157 - 161. Many New Testament {{scholars}} have recently {{come to understand}} aspects of Christology {{in terms of the}} rabbinic legal concept of agency. Whereas Rengstorf attempted to understand apostleship in terms of the rabbinic agency concept (1964, first published 1933), works such as those of Borgen (1983, first published 1968), and Buehner (1977) attempt to explain the Johannine Jesus in such terms, following on Eduard "Zum religionsgeschichtlichen Hintergrund der "Sendungsformel" Gal. 4 : 4 f; Roem. 8 : 3 f; John 3 : 16 f; I John 4 : 9 ", published in the Zeitschrift fuer die neutestamentliche Wissenschaft in 1966. The aim of this dissertation is to locate the roots of the concept of Divine Agency {{at the heart of the}} Hebrew tradition, rather than in later rabbinic abstractions, and to examine the development of the tradition from ancient times to the period contemporary with Jesus of Nazareth. Two figures, in works reflecting some of the diversity of Intertestamental Judaism and dating from the first decade of the Christian Church, have been selected for assessment as Divine Agents. These are the "Son of Man" in the <b>Similitudes</b> <b>of</b> <b>Enoch</b> and the "Logos" in the writings of Philo of Alexandria. While the rabbinic and other legal abstractions are not a valid ideal model for understanding Divine Agency, they are nevertheless useful in that they articulate concepts more concisely than is the case elsewhere. A brief treatment of the legal material is therefore included. This is followed by a survey of the development of the Hebrew religious tradition, with particular attention to the concept of the Divine Council assembled round the Throne of God. It is in the context of this tradition that messianic and other ideal figures emerged, and therefore in this context that the origins of the Divine Agency Concept are sought. The Agency idea is found to be well-attested in the Hebrew tradition, particularly during the post-Exilic period...|$|E

25|$|In {{classical}} Rabbinical literature, {{there are}} various views <b>of</b> <b>Enoch.</b> One view regarding Enoch was that found in the Targum Pseudo-Jonathan, which thought <b>of</b> <b>Enoch</b> as a pious man, taken to Heaven, and receiving the title of Safra rabba (Great scribe). After Christendom was completely separated from Judaism, this view became the prevailing rabbinical idea <b>of</b> <b>Enoch's</b> character and exaltation.|$|R

50|$|The {{theological}} universe <b>of</b> 2 <b>Enoch</b> {{is deeply}} rooted in the Enochic mold of the Jewish Apocalyptic literature of the Second Temple period.

50|$|Notable pseudepigraphal works {{include the}} Books <b>of</b> <b>Enoch</b> (such as 1 Enoch, 2 Enoch, {{surviving}} only in Old Slavonic, and 3 Enoch, surviving in Hebrew, c. 5th to 6th century CE).

They {{are not part of}} the biblical canon used by Jews, apart from Beta Israel. Most Christian denominations and traditions may accept the Books <b>of</b> <b>Enoch</b> as having some historical or theological interest or significance. It has been observed that part of the Book <b>of</b> <b>Enoch</b> is quoted in the Epistle of Jude (part of the New Testament) but Christian denominations generally regard the Books <b>of</b> <b>Enoch</b> as non-canonical or non-inspired.
