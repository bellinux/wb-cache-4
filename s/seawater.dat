5|$|Despite its {{chemical}} similarity, lithium typically {{does not}} occur together with sodium or potassium due to its smaller size.

40|$|Satsuma Iwo-jima Island, located 40 km {{south of}} Kyushu Island, Japan, bears a shallow-water {{hydrothermal}} system. The coastal <b>seawaters</b> are stained ivory and red colors attributing {{to the presence}} of suspended aluminous and ferric precipitates produced by the mixing of volcanic fluids and <b>seawaters.</b> In Nagahama Bay, which is partly isolated from the pelagic realm, the <b>seawaters</b> appear dark reddish brown, attributing to the concentrated ferric precipitatess. In order to understand how the ferric precipitates behave, we focused on characterizing the relationship between the ferric precipitates and the diurnal tidal cycle in the bay. Using a multiple sensor, we measured the <b>seawaters</b> from the surface {{to the bottom of the}} bay for two weeks, in order to sample one complete tidal cycle, the spring and neap tides in 2007. We accumulated data on pH, depth, and turbidity.

5|$|<b>Seawater</b> is {{invariably}} salty and, {{although its}} degree of saltiness (salinity) can vary, about 90% {{of the water}} in the ocean has 34– (1.2 oz.) of dissolved solids per liter, producing a salinity between 3.4 and 3.5%. To easily describe small differences, however, oceanographers usually express salinity as a millage (‰) or part per thousand (ppt) instead of using percents. The surface salinity of waters in the Northern Hemisphere are generally closer to the 34‰ mark, while those in the South are closer to 35‰. The solutes in ocean water come both from inflowing river water and from the ocean floor. The relative composition of the solutes is stable throughout the world's oceans: sodium (Na) and chloride (Cl) make up about 85%.
