500|$|A survey {{conducted}} by Alain Lieury, a professor of cognitive psychology at the University of Rennes 2 – Upper Brittany, indicates that working on exercises with a pencil and paper is {{just as good as}} Brain Age 2 at stimulating the memory. After evaluating ten-year-old children, the survey found [...] "no evidence to support claims in Nintendo's advertising campaign, featuring Nicole Kidman, that users can test and rejuvenate their grey cells". Lieury finds Brain Age 2 acceptable as a game, but considers it charlatanism for Nintendo to claim it as a scientific test, countering the company's assertions that its edutainment products such as Big Brain Academy and Brain Age 2 can improve blood flow to the brain and supposedly improving [...] "practical intelligence". Regarding whether or not brain training games are effective, Graham Lawton of New Scientist wrote, [...] "All things considered, it's hard not to conclude that brain training has been proven to work—under certain circumstances. [...] It's also worth pointing out that no study has shown that brain training makes cognitive abilities any worse." [...] Lawton notes that Nintendo avoids providing evidence that its Brain Age series actually leads to noticeable improvements in brain functions, and that it instead [...] "is careful not to claim that Brain Age is <b>scientifically</b> <b>validated,</b> merely stating that it is an entertainment product 'inspired' by [...] work." ...|$|E

[...] Many mapping techniques have a relatively low resolution, including hundreds of thousands of neurons in a single voxel. [...] Many functions also involve multiple parts of the brain, meaning that this type of claim is probably both unverifiable with the equipment used, and generally based on an incorrect assumption about how brain functions are divided. [...] It may be that most brain functions will only be described correctly after being measured with much more fine-grained measurements that look not at large regions but instead at {{a very large number of}} tiny individual brain circuits. [...] Many of these studies also have technical problems like small sample size or poor equipment calibration which means they cannot be reproduced - considerations which are sometimes ignored to produce a sensational journal article or news headline.

The methanol extracts of RD leaf and bark were evaluated for in vitro antioxidant activity which exhibited good anti-oxidant activity in terms of reducing power assay, total antioxidant assay and DPPH (1, 1 -diphenyl- 2 -picrylhydrazyl) radical scavenging assay. Total phenolic and flavonoid content were found to be 112 ± 3. 24 mg and 138 ± 2. 46 mg gallic acid equivalents/g extract and 2. 6 ± 0. 26 mg and 3. 34 ± 0. 31 mg rutin equivalents/g extract respectively for RD leaf and bark methanol extracts. The In vivo hepato protective activity of the RD leaf and bark extract was evaluated against carbon tetrachloride (CCl 4) induced hepatic damage in male wistar rats. CCl 4 administration induced hepatic damage in rats resulted in increased levels of aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase, alkaline phosphatase, lactate dehydrogenase, thiobarbituric acid reacting substances, albumin, bilirubin, TNF-α, IL- 1 β and decreased levels of total protein and antioxidant enzymes like superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione reductase.
