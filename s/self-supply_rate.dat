40|$|RPS (Renewable Portfolio Standard) has {{increased}} wood pellet demand dramatically {{in recent years}} in Korea where <b>self-supply</b> <b>rate</b> of wood pellet is not more than 10 %. However global production capacity of wood pellet is prospected to be unable to meet the global demand after 2020. Therefore it is urgently needed to develop new sustainable biomass energy resources which can replace wood pellet at lower cost. As a result of this study EFB (empty fruit bunch) and MF (mesocarp fiber), the representative solid palm biomass, are estimated to be generated at the rate of 20 and 28 mil-lion tons per year (based on 10 % moisture content) in Malaysia and Indonesia, respectively in 2012. Total annual gen-eration rate of EFB and MF is estimated as 48 million tons per year only in Malaysia and Indonesia in 2012. With calorific value of over 90 % of wood pellet EFB {{is expected to be a}} excellent biomass energy resource which can 이형우 － 440 － replace wood pellet. EFB can be utilized as fuel for power generation or industrial purpose. However EFB may no...|$|E
