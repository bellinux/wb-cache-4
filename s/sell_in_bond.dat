The French government even offered him a title and a pension if he would become a French citizen and {{work on behalf of}} the Finance Ministry, but he declined, perhaps because it would frustrate his Wanderlust. Casanova had reached his peak of fortune but could not sustain it. He ran the business poorly, borrowed heavily trying to save it, and spent much of his wealth on constant liaisons with his female workers who were his [...] "harem".|$|R

50|$|John McEntee Bowman {{was engaged}} to run the hotel, and he in turn {{suggested}} Shulze and Weaver as architects.

Three banks agreed to sell the bonds at 1.5 points above par (each $100 bond therefore sold for $101.50). The stock offering sold out in five weeks.|$|R

50|$|The state {{legislature}} brought impeachment trials against the governor, Kansas Secretary of State J. W. Robinson, and State Auditor George S.
