5|$|Born in 1863 in Scotland, Logan {{migrated}} to New Zealand in 1881 {{and took up}} farming. Also involved in the militia, he became a professional soldier in 1912 {{when he joined the}} New Zealand Military Forces. He was commanding the Auckland Military District {{at the time of the}} outbreak of the First World War and was appointed the commander of the <b>Samoa</b> Expeditionary Force, dispatched from New Zealand to occupy the island of <b>Samoa,</b> a territory of Imperial Germany at the time. <b>Samoa</b> was easily occupied on 29 August 1914 and Logan became its Military Administrator; he remained in this capacity for the duration of the war. Although he was decorated for his services, his administration of <b>Samoa</b> was later criticised, particularly in relation to the handling of the influenza outbreak of November 1918, which led to 7,500 deaths. Logan retired from military service in 1919 and settled in Devon, England, where he died in 1935.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{concerns}} that Vizeadmiral (Vice Admiral) Maximilian von Spee's Pacific Squadron of two armoured cruisers {{would interfere with}} proceedings, the SEF arrived at the capital of <b>Samoa,</b> Apia, on 29 August. It made an unopposed landing, covered by the guns of the accompanying escorts, and secured the Government offices in the town {{as well as the}} wireless station several miles away. Logan, now the Military Administrator of <b>Samoa</b> with the island's governor a prisoner of war, oversaw the official raising of the Union Jack flag the following day, formally declaring the occupation of <b>Samoa.</b>|$|E

5000|$|The {{collapse}} of taro exports in 1994 {{has had the}} unintended effect of modestly diversifying <b>Samoa's</b> export products and markets. Prior to the taro leaf blight, <b>Samoa's</b> exports consisted of taro ($1.1 million), coconut cream ($540,000), and [...] "other" [...] ($350,000). Ninety percent of exports went to the Pacific region, and only 1% went to Europe. Forced to look for alternatives to taro, <b>Samoa's</b> exporters have dramatically increased the production of copra, coconut oil, and fish. These three products, which combined to produce export revenue of less than $100,000 in 1993, now account for over $3.8 million. There also has been a relative shift from Pacific markets to European ones, which now receive nearly 15% of <b>Samoa's</b> exports. <b>Samoa's</b> exports are still concentrated in coconut products ($2.36 million worth of copra, copra meal, coconut oil, and coconut cream) and fish ($1.51 million) but are at least somewhat more diverse than before.|$|R

5|$|The American <b>Samoa</b> {{team were}} troubled by {{passport}} issues, {{with only one}} member of their original 20-man senior team, goalkeeper Nicky Salapu, eligible to play. Some hint that the passport issue was an Australian ploy to win the match by a large margin {{in order to secure}} the team's move to the AFC. American <b>Samoa</b> were also unable to call their under-20 players because most of them were involved in high school exams at the time. They were forced to draft in their youth players, including three 15-year-old players, to put together a makeshift team with an average age of 18. According to team manager and Football Federation American <b>Samoa</b> vice-president Tony Langkilde, some of the Samoan players had never played a full 90-minute game before the match with Australia.|$|E
5|$|The disease {{arrived in}} the South Pacific on the cargo vessel , which sailed from Auckland on 30 October 1918 whilst knowingly {{carrying}} sick passengers. Talune stopped in Fiji, <b>Samoa,</b> Tonga and Nauru: the first outbreaks in these locations occurred {{within days of the}} ships visits. The local authorities were generally unprepared for the size of the outbreak, allowing the infection to spread uncontrollably. The German territory of <b>Samoa</b> was the worst affected of the small islands, the New Zealand administration carried out no efforts to lessen the outbreak and rejected offers of assistance from nearby American <b>Samoa.</b> The New Zealand government officially apologised to <b>Samoa</b> in 2002 for their reaction to the outbreak. On 29 November 1918 the military governor of Apia requested assistance from Wellington; the request was turned down because all doctors were needed in New Zealand. Australia offered the only alternate source of aid.|$|E

By contrast, the flu was kept away from American <b>Samoa</b> when Governor John Martin Poyer imposed a blockade. In New Zealand itself, 8,573 deaths were attributed to the 1918 pandemic influenza, resulting in a total population fatality rate of 0.74%. In Ireland, the Spanish Flu accounted for 10% of the total deaths in 1918 which can be seen as quite detrimental considering World War 1 was still occurring.|$|E
