Stratigraphic analyses reveals 30 or more flood events (1000 - 2500 B. P.). Previous studies by students from Washington State University and CWU have documented several hearths, ovens, and possible house floors (200 - 2000 B. P.) exposed in upper portions of bank profiles. Suites of <b>subsurface</b> <b>surveys</b> by University of Arkansas suggest intact features remain {{buried in the}} upper terrace.

40|$|An {{important}} part of <b>surveying</b> <b>services</b> {{is related to the}} construction of buildings, which is the content of this thesis. The thesis deals with the part of the <b>surveying</b> <b>services</b> during the construction of buildings, as regulated in Slovenia; the focus is primarily on the operations of the cadastral pre editing and recording the new situation in the official real estate records. The analysis of the legal framework and procedures of <b>surveying</b> <b>services</b> involves the various phases of the construction project. This is especially emphasized in the preparation of the surveying basis for the purposes of project documentation, project implementation and registration of the final state in surveying records. As a practical example, a project of surveying works at the international border crossing Sočerga, is presented. The project includes cadastral surveying and other work in the cadastral editing area of the border crossing and the building and recording of a new facility at the site in the land cadastre and buildings cadastre...|$|R
40|$|Abstract— 2 D {{resistivity}} {{method is}} an indirect method to the shallow <b>subsurface</b> <b>survey</b> {{for maintaining the}} geo-environment. It is {{used to measure the}} apparent resistivity of subsurface. This study was conducted at Bukit Bunuh, Perak (Malaysia), where EHR resistivity technique was developed in order to get detail and deeper penetration for shallow <b>subsurface</b> study. The <b>survey</b> line for EHR technique was executed in West-East direction while South-North direction was covered without EHR technique. The 2 D resistivity results were compared between the survey line, with and without EHR technique. The survey used Pole-dipole array with 5 m minimum electrode spacing. The results show the first zone with resistivity value of 10 - 800 ohm-m and thickness 5 - 60 m as alluvium consisting of boulders (weathered granite) with resistivity value of> 6000 ohm-m. The second zone with resistivity value> 20 000 ohm-m was granitic bedrock. The penetration depth for 2 D resistivity without EHR technique is 70 m and with EHR techniques is 140 m with 5 m electrode spacing. Index Terms—Bukit bunuh, enhancing horizontal resolutio...|$|R
