50|$|Helicopters of HMR-162 made {{amphibious warfare}} history in February 1952 during Operation Lex Baker I, when they airlifted a combat-equipped {{company of the}} 3rd Marine Regiment from the escort carrier USS Rendova to the Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton hills. The <b>ship-to-shore</b> <b>movement</b> was the first ever {{attempted}} on such a scale.|$|E
50|$|In October 1964, Ruchamkin moved east to {{the coast}} of Spain, where she {{controlled}} the major portion of <b>ship-to-shore</b> <b>movement</b> during Operation Steel Pike I, the largest amphibious exercise since World War II. In November 1964 she returned to Little Creek and resumed amphibious and antisubmarine warfare exercises along the U.S. East Coast and in the Caribbean.|$|E
5000|$|The ship {{travelled}} to Inchon, Korea, {{to prepare}} for Exercise [...] "Bayonet Beach," [...] which provided for <b>ship-to-shore</b> <b>movements</b> {{in the area of}} Pohang, Korea. After the exercise, Union sailed from Iwakuni, Japan, to Subic Bay, Philippines, with Marine aviation ordnance equipment. After a period of upkeep at Yokosuka, she visited Kobe, Japan, and met with an anti-American demonstration staged by the Japanese Peace Committee, a communist organization.|$|R
50|$|Marine Medium Helicopter Squadron 365 was {{established}} on July 1, 1963 at Marine Corps Air Facility Santa Ana, California. Flying UH-34Ds, the squadron’s {{mission was to}} provide assault transport of troops and cargo in support of Fleet Marine Forces during <b>ship-to-shore</b> <b>movements.</b> HMM-365 was reassigned to Marine Corps Air Station Futenma, Okinawa in August 1964 {{in preparation for the}} squadron’s deployment to the Republic of Vietnam. The squadron arrived at Da Nang Air Base on October 7, 1964 and immediately began performing re-supply missions in support of Operation Shufly.|$|R
5000|$|In November 1963, Ruchamkins {{schedule}} was interrupted for Fleet Rehabilitation and Modernization (FRAM) at the Norfolk Shipbuilding and Drydock Company. The FRAM II [...] {{was completed in}} June 1964, and she resumed her duties as primary control vessel in <b>ship-to-shore</b> amphibious <b>movements,</b> transport for underwater demolition teams and beach reconnaissance personnel, and antisubmarine warfare screening unit.|$|R
50|$|Commander, Naval Beach Group ONE (CNBG-1) {{functions}} {{under two}} distinct missions. During amphibious assaults, he provides personnel {{to support and}} operate causeway lighterage, LCACs, LCUs, buoyant ship-to-shore bulk fuel systems, beach traffic control, and beach salvage equipment. The second mission is under the Maritime Preposition Force (MPF) concept which uses the equipment and supplies prepositioned on board forward deployed Maritime Prepositioning ships (MPS). Joining forces with the Marine Expeditionary Brigade (MEB), CNBG-1 forms and commands the Naval Support Element (NSE) and is airlifted into an objective area to establish camp support, conduct <b>ship-to-shore</b> <b>movement,</b> beach party operations and debarkation operations {{in support of the}} offload of each MPF ship.|$|E
5000|$|The next {{mission of}} the Union was to {{participate}} in the 24th annual Black Ship Festival at Shimoda, Japan. This festival commemorates the arrival in Shimoda of Commodore Perry and his squadron of [...] "Black Ships" [...] in 1854. Having brought good will to Shimoda, Union next steamed to Sasebo for upkeep, then on to Pusan, Korea, where she provided facilities for Korean units to stage a <b>ship-to-shore</b> <b>movement.</b> June arrived with Union underway for Naha, Okinawa, to embark marines for the upcoming Operation [...] "Flagpole" [...] at Kuryongpo, Korea. Typhoon [...] "Shirley" [...] greatly hampered the landing phase of the operation, but it was finally completed despite torrential rains, floods, washed out roads, and dense fog.|$|E
5000|$|In 1946 General Roy S. Geiger {{observed}} {{the atomic bomb}} tests at Bikini Atoll and instantly recognized that atomic bombs could render amphibious landings difficult because of the dense concentrations of troops, ships and material at the beachhead. The Commandant of the Marine Corps convened a special board, the Hogaboom Board, that recommended that the Marine Corps develop transport helicopters {{in order to allow}} a more diffuse attack on enemy shores. It also recommended that they stand up an experimental helicopter squadron. HMX-1 was commissioned on December 1, 1947 and based in MCAS Quantico, Virginia because of its relative proximity to the Sikorsky and Piasecki plants in Connecticut, and to the Marine Corps schools where most of the original personnel would come. They operated the Sikorsky HO3S-1 and the Piasecki HRP-1 and saw their first test of capabilities in May of that year when five squadron aircraft transported 66 Marines from the deck of the [...] to Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune, North Carolina. While the test aircraft could only carry three Marines each and required multiple trips, it did indicate the possibilities of the concept. In 1948 the Marine Corps Schools came out with Amphibious Operations - Employment of Helicopters (Tentative) or Phib-31 which was the first manual for airmobile operations. The Marines used the term [...] "vertical envelopment" [...] instead of [...] "air mobility" [...] or [...] "air assault". HMX-1 performed the first <b>ship-to-shore</b> <b>movement</b> of troops from the deck of an aircraft carrier in an exercise in May 1948.After the start of the Korean War, four HMX-1 helicopters were attached to VMO-6 and sent to help the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade at the Battle of Pusan Perimeter in 1950. They were used for battlefield observation and control as well as medical evacuation and the rescue of fliers. During the Chosin campaign they were used for liaison between the different Marine units strung along {{the western edge of the}} Chosin Reservoir. The requirements of the Korean War exceeded the Navy's training requirement thus HMX-1 was pressed into service as a training command for the first few years of the war. They trained the nucleus of pilots that would form HMR-161, the first Marine helicopter transport squadron.|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis thesis documents {{the design and}} implementation of a simulation of the <b>Ship-To-Shore</b> <b>movement</b> phase of the amphibious assault in a modern, object-oriented, process-based simulation language called MODSIM II by CACI Corporationof La Jolla, CA. The main intent of the simulation {{is to build a}} model that will allow the Requirements, Plans and Programs Branch (RP&P), Headquarters, United States Marine Corps (HQMC) to quantitatively compare proposed replacements for the assault aircraft and amphibians currently used in the conduct of the ship-to-shore phase of the amphibious assault. Candidates from the Medium Lift Requirement (MLR) program are compared to identify that mix of aircraft which provides the most rapid build-up of combat power ashore.
