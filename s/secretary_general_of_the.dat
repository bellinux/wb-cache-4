5|$|A {{number of}} {{countries}} expressed concern about unliveable conditions, with The Times of India reporting that the Scottish delegation apparently submitted {{a photograph of a}} dog defecating on a bed in the Games Village. <b>Secretary</b> <b>general</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Organising Committee Lalit Bhanot countered the complaints of poor sanitation when he claimed that cultural differences accounted for differing standards of cleanliness in India and the western world. He was subsequently ridiculed by both the Indian and international media.|$|E
5|$|Because {{of their}} concerns, Aflaq kept quiet. But to his astonishment, keeping quiet {{caused him to}} lose his post as Secretary General – Aflaq was succeeded as <b>Secretary</b> <b>General</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> National Command by Munif al-Razzaz, a Jordanian of Syrian origin. However, the power between the two camps was {{unexpectedly}} reshuffled when Amin al-Hafiz defected to Aflaq's camp. In contrast to other military officers al-Hafiz had very little influence within or outside the party. Al-Hafiz's defection led to a resurgence of activity within Aflaq's faction, al-Bitar and Umran were brought back from Spain {{to form a new}} government.|$|E
5|$|Disquiet about Belgium's {{support for}} the secessionist states led to calls within the United Nations (UN) to remove all Belgian troops from the country. The <b>Secretary</b> <b>General</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> UN, Dag Hammarskjöld, {{believed}} that the crisis would provide the organisation {{with a chance to}} demonstrate its potential as a major peacekeeping force and encouraged the sending of a multinational contingent of peacekeepers to the Congo under UN command. On 14 July, the UN Security Council adopted Resolution 143, calling for total Belgian withdrawal from the Congo and their replacement with a UN-commanded force.|$|E

5|$|The Arab Ba'ath Party {{merged with}} Akram al-Hawrani's Arab Socialist Party to {{establish}} the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party in 1952; Aflaq was elected the party's leader in 1954. During the mid-to-late 1950s the party began developing relations with Gamal Abdel Nasser, the President of Egypt, which {{eventually led to the}} establishment of the United Arab Republic (UAR). Nasser forced Aflaq to dissolve the party, which he did, but without consulting with party members. Shortly after the UAR's dissolution, Aflaq was reelected as <b>Secretary</b> <b>General</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> National Command of the Ba'ath Party. Following the 8th of March Revolution, Aflaq's position within the party was weakened {{to such an extent that}} he was forced to resign as the party's leader in 1965. Aflaq was ousted during the 1966 Syrian coup d'état, which led to a schism within the Ba'ath Party. He escaped to Lebanon, but later went to Iraq. In 1968 Aflaq was elected <b>Secretary</b> <b>General</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Iraqi-led Ba'ath Party; during his tenure he held no de facto power. He held the post until his death on 23 June 1989.|$|E

Less than one month later, George Hawi, a former <b>secretary</b> <b>general</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lebanese Communist Party and an ally of the DLM, was killed in a similar car bombing in Beirut.

5|$|By October 1971 Prince Souvanna {{had little}} {{alternative}} but to accept the Pathet Lao program {{as the basis for}} negotiations. The Pathet Lao agreed to the new negotiating effort and on 14 October, representatives of the party arrived in Vientiane. Two weeks later they were followed by Phoumi Vongvichit, <b>secretary</b> <b>general</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Pathet Lao. Communist demands included: a cessation of the U.S. bombing of Lao territory; withdrawal of all U.S. advisors and military personnel; an election for a new National Assembly; the establishment of a coalition government; and compensation and resettlement for those Lao who had been forcibly relocated would be undertaken. The pace of negotiations in Laos, however, mirrored those in South Vietnam, the impetus of which was determined by the perceived military success of the protagonists.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{overthrow}} of al-Shishakli, Syria held its first democratic elections in five years. The Ba'ath Party, led by Aflaq, al-Bitar and al-Hawrani, had 22 members elected to parliament. This increase in influence can largely be attributed to al-Hawrani – several old ASP strongholds voted for the Ba'ath Party because of al-Hawrani's presence. By this time Aflaq was losing much of his power to al-Hawrani and his supporters, who were in {{a majority in the}} party. A proof of this was the decision of the Ba'ath Party to collaborate openly with the Syrian Communist Party (SCP), a move Aflaq opposed. Aflaq was elected the party's <b>Secretary</b> <b>General</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> newly established National Command, a title equivalent to 'party leader', by the party's Second National Congress.|$|E

5|$|On September 10, 1974, Oscar State, <b>secretary</b> <b>general</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> International Weightlifting Federation, {{announced}} that two weightlifters—North Korean Kim Joong-iI (heavyweight) and Japanese Masushi Ouchi (middle heavyweight)—had {{tested positive for}} a banned substance (stimulant) and were stripped of their medals. Kim had won three gold medals (snatch, clean & jerk and total) in the heavyweight category, while Masashi had won two gold (snatch and total) and one silver (clean & jerk) in the middle heavyweight. Kim usually competed in the middle heavyweight category, but due to being marginally overweight, {{he was forced to}} compete in heavyweight; after his disqualification, all three gold medals of the heavyweight category went to Houshang Kargarnejad of Iran. Snatch's gold and silver of clean & jerk of Masashi went to China's Qian Yukai and gold of total to Ali Vali of Iran.|$|E
5|$|Richard von Weizsäcker {{was born}} on 15 April 1920 in the New Castle in Stuttgart, the son of diplomat Ernst von Weizsäcker, {{a member of the}} noted Weizsäcker family, and his wife Marianne (née von Graevenitz). Ernst von Weizsäcker was a career diplomat and a {{high-ranking}} official in the Foreign Ministry in the 1930s. The youngest of four children, Weizsäcker had two brothers, the physicist and philosopher Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker and Heinrich von Weizsäcker, and also a sister, Elisabeth. In 1967, Elisabeth married Konrad Raiser, the former <b>Secretary</b> <b>General</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> World Council of Churches. His grandfather Karl von Weizsäcker was Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Württemberg, and was ennobled in 1897 and raised to the hereditary title of Baron (Freiherr) in 1916.|$|E
5|$|The Arab Ba'ath Party's first {{congress}} {{was held in}} Damascus in 1947. Aflaq took the pre-eminent position of Amid, sometimes translated as 'doyen' or as 'leader'; and was elected to a four-member executive committee. Under the constitution adopted at the congress, this made him effective leader of the party, with sweeping powers within the organisation; al-Bitar was elected <b>Secretary</b> <b>General</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> National Command. Zaki al-Arsuzi, {{the leader of the}} Arab Ba'ath, was not given any position, or membership in the party. Aflaq as Amid was responsible for ideological affairs and became the party's mentor, while al-Bitar controlled the party's day-to-day management. The merger would prove problematic, several members of the al-Arsuzi-led Ba'ath Party were more left-leaning, and would become, later in Aflaq's tenure as leader, highly critical of his leadership.|$|E
