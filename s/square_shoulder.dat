25|$|Sloping {{shoulder}} spades: Sloping shoulder spades {{usually have}} a sloping shoulder, with the two outside lines on the obverse and reverse at an angle. The central line is often missing. This type is generally smaller than the prototype or <b>square</b> <b>shoulder</b> spades. Their inscriptions are clearer, and usually consist of two characters. They {{are associated with the}} Kingdom of Zhou and the Henan area. Their smaller size indicates that they are later in date than the <b>square</b> <b>shoulder</b> spades.|$|E
25|$|<b>Square</b> <b>shoulder</b> spades: <b>Square</b> <b>shoulder</b> spade coins have square shoulders, a {{straight}} or slightly curving foot, and three parallel {{lines on the}} obverse and reverse. They are found in quantities of up to several hundreds in the area corresponding to the Royal Domain of Zhou (south Hebei and north Henan). Archaeological evidence dates them to the early Spring and Autumn period, around 650 BC onwards. The inscriptions on these coins usually consist of one character, {{which can be a}} number, a cyclical character, a place name, or the name of a clan. The possibility that some inscriptions are the names of merchants has not been entertained. The crude writing is that of the artisans who made the coins, not the more careful script of the scholars who wrote the votive inscriptions on bronzes. The style of writing is consistent with that of the middle Zhou period. Over 200 inscriptions are known; many have not been fully deciphered. The characters {{can be found on the}} left or the right of the central line and are sometimes inverted or retrograde. The alloy of these coins is typically 80% copper, 15% lead, and 5% tin. They are found in hoards of hundreds, rather than thousands, sometimes tied together in bundles. Although there is no mention in the literature of their purchasing power, it is clear that they were not small change.|$|E

50|$|Both of the Berettas, and the K100, {{have the}} archetypal square {{shouldered}} lock {{protruding from the}} otherwise round barrel, easily visible at the ejection port with the slide fully forward. This <b>square</b> <b>shoulder</b> is rotated in behind a solid column of steel running {{the length of the}} slide forward of the ejection port, and on the left side out of view, when the slide and barrel are fully forward in battery. This locks the slide forward in battery. Given that the MP9 uses the same basic locking mechanism, and has a cyclical rate of fire of 900 rounds/min, the rotating barrel lock has shown itself to be capable of very fast lock times.|$|E

40|$|In many cases, the {{stability}} of complex structures in colloidal systems is enhanced by a competition between different length scales. Inspired by recent experiments on nanoparticles coated with polymers, we use Monte Carlo simulations to explore the types of crystal structures that can form in a simple hard-core <b>square</b> <b>shoulder</b> model that explicitly incorporates two favored distances between the particles. To this end, we combine Monte Carlo-based crystal structure finding algorithms with free energies obtained using a mean-field cell theory approach, and draw phase diagrams for two different values of the <b>square</b> <b>shoulder</b> width {{as a function of}} the density and temperature. Moreover, we map out the zero-temperature phase diagram for a broad range of shoulder widths. Our results show {{the stability}} of a rich variety of crystal phases, such as body-centered orthogonal (BCO) lattices not previously considered for the <b>square</b> <b>shoulder</b> model...|$|E
40|$|The {{system with}} the <b>square</b> <b>shoulder</b> (SS) {{potential}} is considered {{in the frame of}} Mode Coupling Theory (MCT) approach. An approximation for the structure factor is used that emphasizes the quasibinary character of the system. The qualitative phase diagram is constructed that includes continuous and discontinuous glass-glass transitions. The phase diagram is governed by two swallow tails connected with two $A_ 4 $ singularities. Comment: 8 pages, 5 figure...|$|E
40|$|Introducing genetic {{algorithms}} as {{a reliable and}} efficient tool to find ordered equilibrium structures, we predict minimum energy configurations of the <b>square</b> <b>shoulder</b> system for different values of corona width λ. Varying systematically the pressure for different values of λ we obtain complete sequences of minimum energy configurations which provide {{a deeper understanding of}} the system's strategies to arrange particles in an energetically optimized fashion, leading to the competing self-assembly scenarios of cluster-formation vs. lane-formation.

40|$|The phase {{behavior}} of hard-sphere particles interacting with a short-ranged potential is {{studied in the}} limit of infinite space dimensionality via the Franz-Parisi approach and the replica method of disordered systems. For an attractive square-well potential the phase diagram exhibits reentrancy of the liquid-glass transition, multiple glass states and glass-glass transition. For a repulsive <b>square</b> <b>shoulder</b> potential no such special features are observed. Our results show that the Franz-Parisi approach can be consistently extended to deal with higher-order glass singularities and that interparticle attraction is crucial for complex glassy behavior in large enough dimensions, at least for monodisperse systems.

40|$|We derive an {{analytical}} expression for the effective force between {{a pair of}} macrospheres immersed {{in a sea of}} microspheres, in the case where the interaction between the two unlike species is assumed to be a square well or a <b>square</b> <b>shoulder</b> of given range and depth (or height). This formula extends a similar one developed in the case of hard core interactions only. Qual-itative features of such effective force and the resulting phase diagram are then analyzed in the limit of no interaction between the small particles. Approximate force profiles are then ob-tained by means of integral equation theories (PY and HNC) combined with the superposition approximation and compared with exact ones from direct Monte Carlo simulations. ...|$|E
40|$|Building on mode-coupling-theory calculations, {{we report}} a novel {{scenario}} for multiple glass transitions in a purely repulsive spherical potential: the <b>square</b> <b>shoulder.</b> The liquid-glass transition lines exhibit both melting by cooling and melting by compression {{as well as}} associated diffusion anomalies, {{similar to the ones}} observed in water. Differently from all previously investigated models, we find for small shoulder widths a glass-glass line that is disconnected from the liquid phase. Upon increasing the shoulder width such a glass-glass line merges with the liquid-glass transition lines, featuring two distinct end point singularities that give rise to logarithmic decays in the dynamics. We analytically explain these findings by considering the interplay of different repulsive length scales...|$|E
