25|$|<b>Shift</b> <b>workers</b> {{who work}} {{throughout}} the night {{have been known to}} have far more accidents as opposed to daytime workers. This can be attributed to several factors, including fewer staff and fatigue; however, part of the problem may be the workers poor working memory and poor performance skills due to poor memory consolidation. Both implicitly learned tasks and explicitly learned tasks improve by roughly 20% after a full nights sleep. Without an adequate nights sleep between learning a new task and performance of that task, performance fails to improve. <b>Shift</b> <b>workers</b> who are not given an adequate amount of sleep, particularly in the NREM stage, between learning and performance of a task will not perform as well as workers who maintain a standard sleep routine.|$|E

500|$|Circadian rhythm effects {{describe}} {{the tendency for}} humans to experience a normal cycle in attentiveness and sleepiness through the 24-hour day. Those with a conventional sleep pattern (sleeping for seven or eighthours at night) experience periods of maximum fatigue {{in the early hours}} of the morning and a lesser period in the early afternoon. During the low points of this cycle, one experiences reduced attentiveness. During the high points, it is difficult to sleep soundly. The cycle is anchored in part by ambient lighting (darkness causes a person's body to release the hormone melatonin, which induces sleep), and by a person's imposed pattern of regular sleeping and waking times. The influence of the day-night cycle is never fully displaced (standard artificial lighting is not strong enough to inhibit the release of melatonin), and the performance of night <b>shift</b> <b>workers</b> usually suffers. Circadian rhythms are persistent, and can only be shifted by one to twohours forward or backward per day. Changing the starting time of a work shift by more than these amounts will reduce attentiveness, which is common after the first night shift following a [...] "weekend" [...] break during which conventional sleep times were followed.|$|E

2500|$|The other {{complaint}} {{is that the}} medicines must be taken {{on an empty stomach}} to facilitate absorption. [...] This can be difficult for patients to follow (for example, <b>shift</b> <b>workers</b> who take their meals at irregular times) and may mean the patient waking up an hour earlier than usual everyday just to take medication. [...] The rules are actually less stringent than many physicians and pharmacists realise: the issue is that the absorption of RMP is reduced if taken with fat, but is unaffected by carbohydrate, protein, or antacids. [...] So the patient can in fact have his or her medication with food as long as the meal does not contain fat or oils (e.g., a cup of black coffee or toast with jam and no butter). Taking the medicines with food also helps ease the nausea that many patients feel when taking the medicines on an empty stomach. [...] The effect of food on the absorption of INH is not clear: two studies have shown reduced absorption with food but one study showed no difference. There is a small effect of food on the absorption of PZA and of EMB that is probably not clinically important.|$|E

50|$|One of {{the ways}} in which working {{alternative}} shifts can impair health is through decreasing sleep opportunities. Among all workers, those who usually worked the night shift had a much higher prevalence of short sleep duration (44.0%, representing approximately 2.2 million night <b>shift</b> <b>workers)</b> than those who worked the day shift (28.8%, representing approximately 28.3 million day <b>shift</b> <b>workers).</b> An especially high prevalence of short sleep duration was reported by night <b>shift</b> <b>workers</b> in the transportation and warehousing (69.7%) and health-care and social assistance (52.3%) industries.|$|E

5000|$|Acute sleep {{deprivation}} occurs during long shifts with no breaks, {{as well as}} during night <b>shifts</b> when the <b>worker</b> sleeps {{in the morning and}} is awake during the afternoon, prior to the work shift.

The effects of acute {{sleep deprivation}} can be compared to impairment due to alcohol intoxication, with 19 hours of wakefulness corresponding to a BAC of 0.05%, and 24 hours of wakefulness corresponding to a BAC of 0.10%. [...] Much of the effect of acute sleep deprivation can be countered by napping, with longer naps giving more benefit than shorter naps. [...] Some industries, specifically the Fire Service, have traditionally allowed workers to sleep while on duty, between calls for service. In one study of EMS providers, 24-hour shifts were not associated with a higher frequency of negative safety outcomes when compared to shorter shifts.|$|R
