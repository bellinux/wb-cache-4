5|$|After the Israeli {{invasion}} of Lebanon in 1982, Israel occupied {{a strip of}} south Lebanon, which was controlled by the <b>South</b> <b>Lebanon</b> <b>Army</b> (SLA), a militia supported by Israel. Hezbollah was conceived by Muslim clerics and funded by Iran primarily to harass the Israeli occupation. Its leaders were followers of Ayatollah Khomeini, and its forces were trained and organized by a contingent of 1,500 Revolutionary Guards that arrived from Iran with permission from the Syrian government, which was in occupation of Lebanon at the time.|$|E

25|$|Israel {{withdrew from}} the Bekaa valley on 24 April, and from Tyre on the 29th. In June 1985, the IDF {{unilaterally}} withdrew to a security zone in southern Lebanon along with its principal Lebanese ally, the <b>South</b> <b>Lebanon</b> <b>Army,</b> officially ending the war.|$|E
25|$|Israeli {{occupation}} of southern Lebanon took place after Israel invaded Lebanon during the 1982 Lebanon War and subsequently retained its forces {{to support the}} Christian <b>South</b> <b>Lebanon</b> <b>Army</b> in Southern Lebanon. In 1982, the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) and allied Free Lebanon Army Christian militias seized large sections of Lebanon, including the capital of Beirut, amid the hostilities of the wider Lebanese Civil War. Later, Israel withdrew from parts of the occupied area between 1983 and 1985, but remained in partial control of the border region known as the South Lebanon Security Belt, initially in coordination with the self-proclaimed Free Lebanon State, which executed a limited authority over portions of southern Lebanon until 1984, and later with the <b>South</b> <b>Lebanon</b> <b>Army</b> (transformed from Free Lebanon Army), until the year 2000. Israel's stated purpose for the Security Belt {{was to create a}} space separating its northern border towns from terrorists residing in Lebanon.|$|E
25|$|From 1985 through 2000, Israel {{continued}} {{to fund the}} <b>South</b> <b>Lebanon</b> <b>Army.</b> In January 2000, Hezbollah assassinated {{the man responsible for}} day to day SLA operations, Colonel Akel Hashem. The Israeli Air Force, in apparent response, on 7 February struck Lebanon's civilian infrastructure, including power stations at Baalbek, Deir Nbouh and Jambour. Eighteen people were reported to have been injured.|$|E
5000|$|By April 1975 the Kataeb Regulatory Forces (KRF) {{were able}} to muster 5,000 militiamen, a total which {{included}} 2,000 full-time uniformed fighters backed by some 3,000 irregulars, originally armed with obsolete firearms. However, some sources place the total of RF fighters higher, around 8,000, organized into autonomous companies or battalions drawn from local Phalange party' sections (Arabic: qism). Each section was responsible for handling all defensive or offensive military operations on their home districts, except for the regular units (the [...] "Commando", Maghaweer and PG companies), which were often deployed as mobile quick reaction forces. [...] Although its membership and command structure was predominately Maronite, the KRF also included a few Greek-Catholics and Armenians in its ranks. The KRF was re-organized and expanded in May 1975, and new specialized units were raised - a Signals battalion (Arabic: Silah al-Ichara), an armoured battalion (aka 2nd Armoured Battalion; Arabic: Silah al-Moudara'a) led by Joseph Elias, a battalion-sized women's section (Arabic: Nizamiyyat) led by Jocelyne Khoueiry, and an artillery group led by Antoine Bridi. [...] To maintain {{law and order in}} the areas under Phalangist control at Beirut and elsewhere, in 1976 a 1,000-strong Police unit, the Kataeb Security Detachments or [...] "Sections Kataeb de Securité" [...] (SKS) in French was formed and commanded by Raymond Assayan. The Phalangists practiced conscription in the areas they controlled, drafting eligible young men to swell its ranks, and by January 1976 the KRF had increased to 10,000-15,000 men and women, this number including civilian recruits and deserters from the Lebanese Army. According to other sources, the KRF regular forces comprised more than 3,000 full-time uniformed fighters by mid-1978. [...] KRF militia units operated mainly in East Beirut, the Aley District, the Matn District, Mount Lebanon, the Koura and Keserwan Districts, but also had a presence at the south in the Jabal Amel, where their local militants later played a key part {{in the formation of the}} Israeli-backed [...] "Free Lebanese Militia/Army", <b>South</b> <b>Lebanon</b> <b>Army's</b> predecessor.|$|R
50|$|Although {{the strip}} was officially formed in 1985, {{following}} {{degradation of the}} Free Lebanon State and the IDF withdrawal from most of <b>South</b> <b>Lebanon,</b> it {{has its roots in}} the early Lebanese civil war. From 1968, the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) controlled southern Lebanon. In 1975, the PLO's control became a severe nuisance to Christians and local residents. The Christians asked Israel for its assistance. From mid-1976, Israel began to assist the Christian residents across the border by opening the border, or Good Fence, in Metola, and through military cooperation with the Christian militia, the Free <b>Lebanon</b> <b>Army</b> and later Free Lebanon State, which was established under the Christian officer Major Saad Haddad.|$|R

25|$|On 19 March 1978, the United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 425, {{which called}} for Israel's {{immediate}} withdrawal {{and the establishment of}} a United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon. When Israel forces withdrew later in 1978, they turned over its positions in Lebanon to the <b>South</b> <b>Lebanon</b> <b>Army</b> which would continue fighting as a proxy for Israel against the PLO until Israel drove the PLO out of Lebanon in 1982.|$|E
25|$|Following its {{declaration}} of intent to implement UNSC Resolution 425 on 1 April 1998, and {{after the collapse of}} the <b>South</b> <b>Lebanon</b> <b>Army</b> in the face of a Hezbollah onslaught, Israel declared 24 May 2000 that they would withdraw to their side of the UN designated border, the Blue Line, 22 years after the resolution had been approved. The South Lebanon Army's equipment and positions largely fell into the hands of Hezbollah.|$|E
25|$|From {{the end of}} {{the civil}} war in 1990 until the Israeli {{withdrawal}} from Lebanon in 2000 the Guardians of the Cedars formed an element of the now-defunct <b>South</b> <b>Lebanon</b> <b>Army.</b> Since that date their military operations have ceased and they operate solely politically, campaigning to remove the Syrian presence in Lebanon. In common with the Christian and Sunni-dominated March 14 Alliance, the party has expressed its support for the Syrian uprising.|$|E

25|$|During {{the stay}} in the {{security}} belt, the IDF held many positions and supported the SLA. The SLA took over daily life in the security zone, initially as the official force of the Free Lebanon State and later as an allied militia. Notably, the <b>South</b> <b>Lebanon</b> <b>Army</b> controlled the prison in Khiam. In addition, United Nations (UN) forces and the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) were deployed to the security belt (from the end of Operation Litani in 1978).|$|E
25|$|In the south, {{military}} {{exchanges between}} Israel and the PLO led Israel to support Saad Haddad's <b>South</b> <b>Lebanon</b> <b>Army</b> (SLA) {{in an effort}} to establish a security belt along Israel's northern border, an effort which intensified in 1977 with the election of new Israeli prime minister Menachem Begin. Israel invaded Lebanon in response to Fatah attacks in Israel in March 1978, occupying most of the area south of the Litani River, and resulting in the evacuation of at least 100,000 Lebanese, as well as approximately 2,000 deaths.|$|E
25|$|The M-50 Continentals were retired by 1972. The M-50 Cummins and M-51 were {{gradually}} {{phased out}} in late 1970s to early 1980s. During the Lebanese Civil War, some 75 M-50s were given as {{aid to the}} Israeli-supported Lebanese Christian militias – Kataeb Regulatory Forces (19), Tigers Militia (20), Guardians of the Cedars (1), the Lebanese Forces (40), and the <b>South</b> <b>Lebanon</b> <b>Army</b> (35) – in 1976; two tanks were later captured by the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), which employed them {{in the defense of}} West Beirut during the June 1982 Israeli invasion of Lebanon.|$|E

50|$|The <b>South</b> <b>Lebanon</b> {{security}} belt administration {{was a local}} provisional governance body in <b>South</b> <b>Lebanon,</b> in the <b>South</b> <b>Lebanon</b> {{security belt}} areas. It replaced the Free Lebanon State institutions and operated from 1985 until 2000 with full Israeli logistic and military support. It controlled 328 square miles of territory in southern Lebanon. During its functioning years, the administration was headed by Antoine Lahad, a Maronite Christian claiming the rank of general.|$|R

25|$|In Israel, it was {{increasingly}} debated whether {{the presence of}} Israeli forces in southern Lebanon was working, since {{it was clear that}} the 'security zone' could not stop Hezbollah rockets reaching into Israel. After heavy Israeli casualties in south lebanon, some Israeli politicians argued that the conflict would only end if Israel withdrew from Lebanon. In 2000 Ehud Barak finally withdrew Israeli forces from Lebanon. Following the Israeli withdrawal, the <b>South</b> <b>Lebanon</b> <b>Army,</b> which was supported by Israel, was quickly overrun by Hezbollah. Some SLA members escaped to Israel, but many were captured by Hezbollah. This success against Israel greatly increased Hezbollah's popularity within Lebanon and the Islamic world.|$|E
25|$|After the 1982 Lebanon War {{the party}} cooperated with Israel Defense Forces, and its militia joined the <b>South</b> <b>Lebanon</b> <b>Army</b> (SLA). After the {{withdrawal}} of Israel from Lebanon in 2000, most of the leadership fled to Israel. The group was banned by the Syrian-dominated government and decided {{to give up its}} arms to become a traditional political party. It remains banned, and is only a minor force in national life. Still, some of the rhetoric used by the LRP in advocating its domestic policies was revived during the Cedar Revolution in 2005, which forced {{the withdrawal of}} Syria from Lebanon and led to expectations of political reform.|$|E
25|$|The United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, or UNIFIL, {{was created}} by the United Nations, with the {{adoption}} of the United Nations Security Council Resolution 425 and the United Nations Security Council Resolution 426 on 19 March 1978, to confirm Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon which Israel had invaded five days prior, restore international peace and security, and help the Government of Lebanon restore its effective authority in the area. The first UNIFIL troops were deployed in the area on 23 March 1978; these troops were reassigned from other UN peacekeeping operations in the area (namely the United Nations Emergency Force and the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force Zone). During the 1982 Lebanon War, UN positions were overrun, primarily by the <b>South</b> <b>Lebanon</b> <b>Army</b> forces under Saad Haddad.|$|E
50|$|In 1985, Gerstein {{returned}} to active military service. led the Brigade's Reconnaissance company and Golani Brigade's 51 battalion in counter-guerrilla operations in <b>South</b> <b>Lebanon.</b> Afterwords he commanded a battalion in squad leader course and a Regional Brigade in <b>South</b> <b>Lebanon.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The <b>South</b> <b>Lebanon</b> {{conflict}} (1985-2000) or the Security Zone {{conflict in}} Lebanon refers to 15 years of warfare between the Lebanese Christian proxy militias SLA with military and logistic support of Israel Defense Forces against Lebanese Muslim guerrillas {{led by the}} Iranian-backed Hezbollah, within what {{was defined as the}} [...] "Security Zone" [...] in <b>South</b> <b>Lebanon.</b> It can also refer to the continuation of conflict in this region, beginning with the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) operations transfer to <b>South</b> <b>Lebanon,</b> following Black September in the Kingdom of Jordan. Historical tension between Palestinian refugees and Lebanese factions fomented the violent Lebanese internal political struggle between many different factions. In light of this, the <b>South</b> <b>Lebanon</b> conflict {{can be seen as a}} part of the Lebanese Civil War.|$|R

25|$|In March 1983, Israel and Lebanon {{signed a}} ceasefire agreement. However, Syria {{pressured}} President Amine Gemayel into nullifying the truce in March 1984. By 1985, Israeli forces withdrew to a 15km wide southern strip of Lebanon, following which the conflict continued on a lower scale, with relatively low casualties on both sides. In 1993 and 1996, Israel launched major operations against the Shiite militia of Hezbollah, {{which had become}} an emergent threat. In May 2000, the newly elected government of Ehud Barak authorized a withdrawal from Southern Lebanon, fulfilling an election promise to do so well ahead of a declared deadline. The hasty withdrawal lead to the immediate collapse of the <b>South</b> <b>Lebanon</b> <b>Army,</b> and many members either got arrested or fled to Israel.|$|E
25|$|Another Israeli {{invasion}} in 1982 forced the PLO out of southern Lebanon, and occupied the area. The following eighteen years until 2000 saw prolonged guerrilla warfare between Israeli forces, their {{allies in the}} <b>South</b> <b>Lebanon</b> <b>Army</b> and Hezbollah. UNIFIL {{was caught in the}} middle of this conflict. The Irish battalion's role consisted of manning checkpoints and observations posts and mounting patrols. A total of 47 soldiers were killed. In addition to peacekeeping, the Irish provided humanitarian aid to the local population - for example aiding the orphanage at Tibnin. From 25 April 1995 to 9 May 1996, Brigadier General P. Redmond served as Deputy Force Commander of UNIFIL during a period that coincided with the Israeli Operation Grapes of Wrath offensive in 1996.|$|E
25|$|On 9 May 1982, Israeli {{aircraft}} again attacked {{targets in}} Lebanon. Later that same day, UNIFIL observed {{the firing of}} rockets from Palestinian positions in the Tyre region into northern Israel, {{but none of the}} projectiles hit Israeli towns – the gunners had been ordered to miss. Major-General Erskine (Ghana), Chief of Staff of UNTSO reported to the Secretary-General and the Security Council (S/14789, S/15194) that from August 1981 to May 1982, inclusive, there were 2096 violations of Lebanese airspace and 652 violations of Lebanese territorial waters. The freedom of movement of UNIFIL personnel and UNTSO observers within the enclave remained restricted due to the actions of Amal and the <b>South</b> <b>Lebanon</b> <b>Army</b> under Major Saad Haddad's leadership with the backing of Israeli military forces.|$|E
