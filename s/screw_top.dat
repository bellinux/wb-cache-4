25|$|Ventnor Brewery, which {{closed in}} 2009, {{was the last}} {{incarnation}} of Burt's Brewery, brewing since the 1840s in Ventnor. Until the 1960s most pubs were owned by Mews Brewery, situated in Newport near the old railway station, but it closed and the pubs were taken over by Strong's, and then by Whitbread. By some accounts Mews beer was apt to be rather cloudy and dark. In the 19th century they pioneered the use of <b>screw</b> <b>top</b> cans for export to British India.|$|E
25|$|Before their {{presentation}} the colours are ceremonially blessed in {{a religious}} ceremony attended by Buddhist monks and other high ranking dignitaries inside the Temple of the Emerald Buddha in Bangkok. During the ceremony amidst the chanting of the monks, the King will personally hammer the brass nails into the staff of each colour using a silver hammer. Each colour contains about 32-35 nails, in which the cloth {{is attached to the}} wooden staff. Within the same ceremony, the King will also take a strand of his own hair and conceal it within a compartment {{at the top of the}} staff, which is closed by a round silver <b>screw</b> <b>top.</b> The King will also attach each colour with its own ceremonial Buddha image, and bless each colour with holy water. The ceremony is steeped in Buddhist and Brahmic heritage, it symbolizes and cements the King's role as Chief Kshatriya (กษัตริย์) or Warrior ruler of his realm. It also emphasizes his constitutional role as Head and Chief of the Thai Armed Forces (จอมทัพไทย: Chomthap Thai).|$|E

I pointed out to him that I had hardly a sufficient quantity for a completely destructive result, but he pressed me very earnestly to do my best. As he wanted something that could be carried openly in the hand, I proposed to make use of an old one-gallon copal varnish can I happened to have by me. He was pleased at the idea. It gave me some trouble, because I had to cut out the bottom first and solder it on again afterwards. When prepared for use, the can enclosed a wide-mouthed, well-corked jar of thick glass packed around with some wet clay and containing sixteen ounces of X2 green powder. The detonator was connected with the <b>screw</b> <b>top</b> of the can. It was ingenious—a combination of time and shock. I explained the system to him.

50|$|Like {{the other}} simple {{machines}} a screw can amplify force; a small rotational force (torque) {{on the shaft}} can exert a large axial force on a load. The smaller the pitch, {{the distance between the}} screw's threads, the greater the mechanical advantage, the ratio of output to input force. Screws are widely used in threaded fasteners to hold objects together, and in devices such as <b>screw</b> <b>tops</b> for containers, vises, screw jacks and screw presses.|$|R
40|$|COLLECTING SCREW TOPS. BAD CONSCIENCE IN LATE CAPITALISM The authors {{prove that}} {{collecting}} plastic <b>screw</b> <b>tops</b> for charity – a widespread practice among contemporary Polish society – {{is a phenomenon}} {{that is based on}} self-contradictory economical and ecological rationalization. Such practices of collecting pieces of rubbish for charity also have a well established history as social myths and urban legends. The authors utilize psychoanalytic theories to argue that this phenomenon is an acting out of remorse for the consumptionist lifestyle of the late capitalist society – specifically for the fact that we always live at the expense of others.

50|$|This {{self-locking}} {{property is}} {{one reason for the}} very large use of the screw in threaded fasteners such as wood screws, sheet metal screws, studs and bolts. Tightening the fastener by turning it puts compression force on the materials or parts being fastened together, but no amount of force from the parts will cause the screw to untighten. This property is also the basis for the use of screws in <b>screw</b> <b>top</b> container lids, vises, C-clamps, and screw jacks. A heavy object can be raised by turning the jack shaft, but when the shaft is released it will stay at whatever height it is raised to.|$|E
