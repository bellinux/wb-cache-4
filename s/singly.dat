5|$|The first largely {{complete}} set of oscillator strengths of <b>singly</b> ionized iron-group elements were made available in the 1960s, and these were subsequently improved. In 1978, the abundances of <b>singly</b> ionized elements of the iron group were derived.|$|E
5|$|Trams on Metrolink {{can operate}} either <b>singly,</b> or coupled {{together}} to form double units. Double units regularly run during rush hours.|$|E
5|$|Although NAD {{is written}} with a {{superscript}} plus sign {{because of the}} formal charge on a particular nitrogen atom, at physiological pH {{for the most part}} it is actually a <b>singly</b> charged anion (charge of minus 1), while NADH is a doubly charged anion.|$|E
5|$|Boletus auripes is mycorrhizal, {{and fruits}} <b>singly,</b> scattered, or in {{groups on the}} ground under {{broadleaf}} trees, especially oak and beech, {{but it has also}} been recorded associating with mountain laurel (Kalmia latifolia). Boletus auripes typically forms fruit bodies between June and November.|$|E
5|$|A {{saprobic}} species, Entoloma murrayi derives nutrients {{by breaking}} down organic matter. Fruit bodies {{are found in}} wet coniferous and deciduous forests, where they grow <b>singly</b> or in small groups {{on the ground in}} litterfall or humus, or in moss. Fruiting occurs in the summer and autumn.|$|E
5|$|Black-shouldered kites usually hunt <b>singly</b> or in pairs, though {{where food}} is {{plentiful}} they occur in small family groups {{and can be}} loosely gregarious at times of irruptions, with up to 70 birds reported feeding together during a mouse plague. They roost communally, like other Elanus species.|$|E
5|$|Bovista pila {{is found}} in corrals, stables, roadsides, {{pastures}} and open woods. The puffballs fruit <b>singly,</b> scattered, or in groups on the ground. It is also known to grow in lawns and parks. The puffball spore cases are persistent and may overwinter. Fruiting occurs throughout the mushroom season.|$|E
5|$|Excepting for the head, snakes have imbricate scales, {{overlapping}} {{like the}} tiles on a roof. Snakes have rows of scales along the whole {{or part of}} their length and also many other specialised scales, either <b>singly</b> or in pairs, occurring {{on the head and}} other regions of the body.|$|E
5|$|Experiments {{confirming}} {{the role of}} kin selection in worker policing demonstrate the effects of multiple matings, {{which can lead to}} lower average relatedness between workers. Queens of the social wasp Dolichovespula saxonica mate <b>singly</b> or multiply. Researchers who study these wasps have observed a strong positive correlation between worker relatedness and male production. After controlling for the absolute number of eggs laid, these scientists conclude that the queen's multiple matings favor mutual worker policing.|$|E
5|$|Fruit {{bodies of}} Lepiota babruzalka grow <b>singly</b> or {{scattered}} on the ground among decaying leaf litter {{around the base of}} bamboo stands. The species has been documented only from Chelavur and Nilambur in the Kozhikode and Malappuram Districts of Kerala State. As of 2009, there are 22 Lepiota taxa (21 species and 1 variety) known from Kerala, which is recognized as a biodiversity hotspot.|$|E
5|$|Leccinum manzanitae is a {{mycorrhizal}} species. Its fruit bodies grow <b>singly</b> to {{scattered in}} soil under madrone and manzanita. Known to occur only in North America, {{it is commonly}} found from central California to southern Oregon, but has also been reported further north in Washington and British Columbia (Canada). Thiers considered it the most abundant Leccinum in California.|$|E
5|$|Leucopholiota decorosa is a {{saprobic}} species, deriving {{nutrients from}} decaying organic matter, particularly the rotting branches and stumps of deciduous trees. One field guide notes {{a preference for}} sugar maple. It grows <b>singly</b> or in bunches, clustered together {{at the base of}} the stem. In Ohio, it typically fruits from late September to mid November.|$|E
5|$|Other Marasmius {{species with}} a {{pinwheel}} arrangement of gills are readily distinguished from M.rotula by differences in color, including the orange M.siccus, the pink M.pulcherripes, and the rust M.fulvoferrugineus. Mycena corticola {{is smaller than}} Marasmius rotula, has a pale pink-brown cap, and is usually found growing <b>singly</b> or in small groups on bark near the base of living trees.|$|E
5|$|Radiotherapy {{can also}} be used before surgery in certain cases. When {{pre-operative}} imaging or clinical evaluation shows tumor invading the cervix, radiation can be given before a total hysterectomy is performed. Brachytherapy and EBRT {{can also be}} used, <b>singly</b> or in combination, when there is a contraindication for hysterectomy. Both delivery methods of radiotherapy are associated with side effects, particularly in the gastrointestinal tract.|$|E
5|$|Strobilurus tenacellus is a {{saprobic}} wood-rotting fungus. It fruits <b>singly</b> or {{in small}} groups on fallen and often partially buried cones of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris), European black pine (Pinus nigra) and sometimes spruce (Picea) in coniferous and mixed forests. It is found in Europe and Asia, {{where it has been}} recorded in Japan and Jordan. In Europe, the fungus usually fruits from March to June. Its occurrence is occasional.|$|E
5|$|Stropharia caerulea is a {{saprophytic}} fungus that fruits <b>singly</b> or in groups. It {{grows in}} or on meadows, roadsides, hedgerows, gardens, and woodchip mulch.

Although also found in North America, generally fruiting from August to October, {{the full extent of}} its distribution there is unknown.|$|E
5|$|The {{country is}} one vast wilderness, blasted out of {{recognition}} where once villages & orchards & fertile land, now tossed about & churned in hopeless disorder with never a landmark {{as far as}} the eye can reach & dotted about in the scrub and untidiness of it all are to be seen here & there <b>singly</b> & in groups little white crosses marking the place where men have fallen and been buried.|$|E
5|$|The fruit {{bodies of}} B.curtisii grow <b>singly,</b> scattered, {{or in small}} groups {{on the ground in}} {{coniferous}} or mixed woods, often with pines. Fruit bodies generally appear from August to November. The geographical distribution of the fungus is limited to eastern and southern North America. In the United States, it occurs from New England south to Florida, and west to Texas. The species was newly reported from Mexico in 2001.|$|E
5|$|The fruit {{bodies of}} Mycena purpureofusca grow <b>singly</b> or in {{clusters}} on the decaying wood of conifers, particularly spruce, pine, and Douglas-fir. It is commonly found on decaying pine cones. In a European study, the fungus was found growing on logs {{in a state}} of decay where the wood was mostly hard, with most of the bark left, to wood that had decayed {{to the point that it}} was mostly soft throughout.|$|E
5|$|The greater {{adjutant}} {{is usually}} seen <b>singly</b> {{or in small}} groups as it stalks about in shallow lakes or drying lake beds and garbage dumps. It is often found {{in the company of}} kites and vultures and will sometimes sit hunched still for long durations. They may also hold their wings outstretched, presumably to control their temperature. They soar on thermals using their large outstretched wings.|$|E
5|$|The {{species is}} found in Mexico, where it grows <b>singly</b> or in small groups in clayey soils in {{subtropical}} coffee plantations, and from Colombia and Brazil in South America. The mushroom contains the psychedelic compounds psilocybin and psilocin, and all parts will stain blue or bluish black when handled or injured. P.hoogshagenii is used for divinatory purposes by some indigenous groups in Mexico.|$|E
5|$|The yellow-faced honeyeater {{is usually}} seen <b>singly,</b> in pairs, {{or in small}} family groups when not migrating. They forage as individuals, as pairs or as small groups of up to ten birds, and during {{migration}} in larger groups. They sometimes feed in large mixed-species foraging flocks composed predominately of insectivorous birds.|$|E
5|$|Thelephora palmata is an ectomycorrhizal species, forming mutualistic {{associations}} with conifers. Fruit bodies grow <b>singly,</b> scattered, or in {{groups on the}} ground in both coniferous and mixed forest and grassy fields. A preference has been noted for moist ground, and locations along woodland paths. An uncommon species, fruit bodies can be difficult to see because they blend well into their surroundings.|$|E
5|$|Thrips lay {{extremely}} small eggs, about 0.2mm long. Females of the suborder Terebrantia cut slits in plant tissue with their ovipositor, and insert their eggs, one per slit. Females of the suborder Tubulifera {{lay their eggs}} <b>singly</b> or in small groups on the outside surfaces of plants.|$|E
5|$|A {{predominantly}} saprophytic species, Morchella rufobrunnea fruit bodies grow <b>singly</b> or {{in clusters}} in disturbed soil or woodchips used in landscaping. Large numbers can appear {{the year after}} wood mulch has been spread on the ground. Typical disturbed habitats include fire pits, near compost piles, logging roads, and dirt basements. Fruiting usually occurs in the spring, although fruit bodies {{can be found in}} these habitats most of the year. Other preferred habitats include steep slopes and plateaus, and old-growth conifer forests. In Cyprus, the fungus is frequently reported from coastal, urban and suburban areas under olive trees (Olea europaea).|$|E
5|$|A {{saprobic}} species, Hapalopilus nidulans {{causes a}} white rot in its host. Fruit {{bodies of the}} fungus grow <b>singly,</b> in groups, or in fused and overlapping clusters on the wood of dead and decaying deciduous trees. Preferred hosts include Quercus (oak), Fagus (beech), and Betula (birch), although on rare occasions it has been recorded on conifer wood as well. In central Europe, its preferred host is oak, while in northern Europe it is found most commonly on Corylus and Sorbus. Fruiting typically occurs from early summer to autumn, but the tough fruit bodies are persistent and may be encountered out of the usual growing season.|$|E
5|$|Although a honeyeater, {{the striped}} honeyeater relies on insects as its major food source, and its bill has been adapted to an insect diet. When not {{breeding}} {{it has been}} recorded feeding and travelling in small groups, but it nests <b>singly,</b> laying around three eggs in a deep cup-shaped nest suspended {{from the end of}} drooping branches. It is widely distributed and common within its range, thus the population is listed as being of least concern for conservation by the IUCN.|$|E
5|$|Antioxidant dietary {{supplements}} do not improve health {{nor are they}} effective in preventing diseases as shown by randomized clinical trials including supplements of beta-carotene, vitamin A, and vitamin E <b>singly</b> or in different combinations having no effect on mortality rate or cancer risk. Supplementation with selenium or vitamin E does not {{reduce the risk of}} cardiovascular disease. Oxidative stress can be considered as either a cause or consequence of some diseases, an area of research stimulating drug development for antioxidant compounds for use as potential therapies.|$|E
5|$|As a {{saprobic}} mushroom, or decomposer {{of organic}} material, Ravenel's stinkhorn {{can be found}} in almost any habitat that includes decaying wood. They are most often found growing in groups, though occasionally <b>singly,</b> on wood chips, rotten tree stumps or sawdust. They are common in urban flowerbeds, parks and lawns, as well as in meadows, cultivated areas and woods. The foul odor of the gleba attracts insects that walk and feed on the spore-bearing surface, and later disseminate the sticky spores to other locales.|$|E
5|$|Before the Eighty Years' War began, people {{realized}} that the West Indies trade might bring great prosperity {{to the country and}} that more power might be developed against Spain. Rather than travel to the area <b>singly</b> on an armed ship or {{in the company of a}} few other vessels, traders could do business in the manner of the large and prosperous East India Company. A company for carrying on commerce in the West Indies and Africa could be organized, which might, like the sister company, act as the war-waging power in those parts and be supported by the treasury, ships, and troops of the United Netherlands.|$|E
5|$|Being saprobic, P. flammans {{is found}} {{exclusively}} on dead and decaying stumps and trunks of coniferous trees, with fruit bodies appearing in tufts or <b>singly,</b> from summer to autumn. It is a fungus {{with a wide}} geographical distribution in boreal and temperate regions, and may be considered common to rare depending upon the region in which it occurs. It is found throughout Europe (from the British Isles to Russia) and North America (southern Canada and the United States). The species has also been collected in Asia, including India and China.|$|E
5|$|Butterfly {{eggs are}} {{protected}} by a hard-ridged outer layer of shell, called the chorion. This is lined with a thin coating of wax which prevents the egg from drying out before the larva has had time to fully develop. Each egg contains a number of tiny funnel-shaped openings at one end, called micropyles; {{the purpose of these}} holes is to allow sperm to enter and fertilize the egg. Butterfly eggs vary greatly in size and shape between species, but are usually upright and finely sculptured. Some species lay eggs <b>singly,</b> others in batches. Many females produce between one hundred and two hundred eggs.|$|E
5|$|Calbovista is a fungal genus {{containing}} the single species Calbovista subsculpta, {{commonly known as}} the sculptured puffball, sculptured giant puffball, and warted giant puffball. It is a common puffball of the Rocky Mountains and Pacific Coast ranges of western North America. The puffball is more or less round with a diameter of up to , white becoming brownish in age, and covered with shallow pyramid-shaped plates or scales. It fruits <b>singly</b> or in groups along roads and in open woods at high elevations, from summer to autumn.|$|E
5|$|Cortinarius iodes forms {{mycorrhizal}} {{associations with}} deciduous trees, particularly oaks. The fruit bodies of Cortinarius iodes sometimes grow <b>singly,</b> {{but more often}} scattered or in groups under hardwood trees, in humus and litterfall. Typical habitats include bog edges, swampy areas, and hummocks. Fruiting usually occurs from July to November. In North America, it is common in eastern regions, and rare in the Pacific Northwest. Its distribution extends from eastern Canada south into Central America and northern regions of South America. It also occurs in northern Asia.|$|E
5|$|Encountered <b>singly</b> or in groups, the thornback {{guitarfish}} {{feeds on}} small, benthic invertebrates and bony fishes. It is aplacental viviparous, with the developing young drawing sustenance from a yolk sac. Females {{give birth to}} 1–15 pups annually in late summer, following a roughly year-long gestation period. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed the thornback guitarfish under Least Concern {{because the majority of}} its range lies within United States waters, where it is common since it has no commercial value and is not heavily fished commercially or recreationally. The status of this species in Mexican waters is inadequately known but may be more precarious.|$|E
5|$|Fruit {{bodies of}} Chalciporus piperatus occur <b>singly,</b> scattered, or in {{groups on the}} ground. The fungus occurs {{naturally}} in or near coniferous or beech and oak woodlands, often on sandy soils. Fruit bodies appear in Europe in late summer and autumn from August to November. The fungus is widespread across North America, fruiting from July to October in the eastern states and from September to January on the Pacific Coast. It is found in Mexico and Central America. In Asia, it has been collected from Pakistan, West Bengal (India), and Guangdong Province (China). In South Africa, it is known from the southwestern Cape Province and the eastern Transvaal Province.|$|E
