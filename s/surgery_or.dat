5|$|Pulmonary, or pulmonic {{stenosis}} is {{an often}} congenital narrowing of the pulmonary valve; {{it can be}} present in nasodigitoacoustic-affected infants.

5|$|According to Schultheiss, Herrmann, and Jonas, {{although}} Trousseau {{had earlier}} suggested that surgery was a viable option, {{there is no}} evidence that the subject subsequently received treatment; They suggest several possible factors, including legal issues, the subject's refusal, or failed treatment followed by a lack of reporting, for the lack of <b>surgery</b> <b>or</b> evidence of such. Maisonneuve, partially shown in one of the photographs, treated another intersex patient in 1862.|$|E
5|$|It {{may lead}} to nosebleeds, acute and chronic {{digestive}} tract bleeding, and various problems due to the involvement of other organs. Treatment focuses on reducing bleeding from blood vessel lesions, and sometimes <b>surgery</b> <b>or</b> other targeted interventions to remove arteriovenous malformations in organs. Chronic bleeding often requires iron supplements and sometimes blood transfusions. HHT is transmitted in an autosomal dominant fashion, and occurs in one in 5,000 people.|$|E

5|$|There {{are several}} {{potential}} clinical {{consequences of the}} presence of an axillary arch including confusing the identification and palpation of enlarged or tumorous lymph nodes, the trapping of axillary structures including the axillary nerve and the axillary vein and causing potential problems in axillary <b>surgery</b> <b>or</b> breast reconstruction. There have also been reported instances of the axillary arch being involved in the development of deep vein thrombosis.|$|E
5|$|Treatment and {{outcomes}} {{depends on the}} risk group a person is in. Treatments may include observation, surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, or stem cell transplantation. Low-risk disease in babies typically has a good outcome with <b>surgery</b> <b>or</b> simply observation.

5|$|If {{investigations}} confirm NSCLC, {{the stage}} is assessed {{to determine whether the}} disease is localized and amenable to <b>surgery</b> <b>or</b> if it has spread {{to the point where it}} cannot be cured surgically. CT scan and positron emission tomography are used for this determination. If mediastinal lymph node involvement is suspected, the nodes may be sampled to assist staging. Techniques used for this include transthoracic needle aspiration, transbronchial needle aspiration (with or without endobronchial ultrasound), endoscopic ultrasound with needle aspiration, mediastinoscopy, and thoracoscopy. Blood tests and pulmonary function testing are used to assess whether a person is well enough for surgery. If pulmonary function tests reveal poor respiratory reserve, surgery may not be possible.|$|E

5|$|The {{cause is}} unknown. The {{underlying}} mechanism involves an autoimmune disorder {{in which the}} body's immune system mistakenly attacks the peripheral nerves and damages their myelin insulation. Sometimes this immune dysfunction is triggered by an infection or, less commonly, <b>surgery</b> <b>or</b> vaccination. The diagnosis is usually made based on the signs and symptoms, through the exclusion of alternative causes, and supported by tests such as nerve conduction studies and examination of the cerebrospinal fluid. There {{are a number of}} subtypes based on the areas of weakness, results of nerve conduction studies, and the presence of certain antibodies. It is classified as an acute polyneuropathy.|$|E
5|$|Low {{back pain}} results in large {{economic}} costs. In the United States, {{it is the}} most common type of pain in adults, responsible for a large number of missed work days, and is the most common musculoskeletal complaint seen in the emergency department. In 1998, it was estimated to be responsible for $90 billion in annual health care costs, with 5% of individuals incurring most (75%) of the costs. Between 1990 and 2001 there was a more than twofold increase in spinal fusion surgeries in the US, despite the fact that there were no changes to the indications for <b>surgery</b> <b>or</b> new evidence of greater usefulness. Further costs occur in the form of lost income and productivity, with low back pain responsible for 40% of all missed work days in the United States. Low back pain causes disability in a larger percentage of the workforce in Canada, Great Britain, the Netherlands and Sweden than in the US or Germany.|$|E
5|$|Numerous fady protect {{wilderness}} areas, particularly {{including the}} Ankarana massif. Excessive cutting of mangrove trees for wood or {{the setting of}} bush fires are both prohibited, as {{is the use of}} nets with holes less than 15 millimeters to prevent catching immature fish. Certain species are protected through fady that forbid hunting them, including sharks, rays and crocodiles. Many fady also exist to regulate relations between the sexes. For instance, it is taboo for a girl to wash her own brother's clothing. Conservative communities adhere to a fady against medical injections, <b>surgery</b> <b>or</b> modern medicines due to their association with their historic enemies the Merina, who were the first to use them widely; instead, tromba ceremonies and traditional herbal remedies are commonly used for healing. These taboos are most strongly applied in the center of Antankarana territory around the village of AmbatoharaÃ±a and less so in the villages at the periphery of the region.|$|E

5|$|A {{cancerous}} patient, Marina Wagner (Amanda Collins), {{is admitted}} {{into the hospital}} and is revealed to have toxic blood - presumably caused by a chemical reaction between an herbal supplement and chemotherapy - making several physicians fall ill. O'Malley is exposed to the neurotoxin, and quickly becomes anxious, fearing that his marriage is the cause of the sickness. Ellis is diagnosed with a heart condition, in which <b>surgery</b> <b>or</b> medication are options. Ellis does not want the surgery, but Meredith fears that she will not be compliant with her medication. Shepherd and Burke try to close up Wagner as the OR was evacuated before her surgery was completed, by entering the operating room with sealed, airtight suits. Ellis agrees to the surgery, but opts to speak with Webber, her former lover. A teenage patient is brought into the clinic by her father, hoping that a doctor can teach her how to use tampons. When her father leaves the room, she explains to Bailey that she had sex, but her pregnancy test is negative. Shepherd and Burke run out of air whilst operating on Wagner, so Yang, Stevens, and Meredith enter holding their breath to close the patient's incision. O'Malley's colleagues act in a rude manner to his new marriage, and displeased, he lectures them, standing up for Torres. Sloan is seen to be having sex with Montgomery, and Yang agrees to marry Burke. At the conclusion of the episode, Ellis' lucidity has vanished, leaving Meredith and Webber distraught.|$|E
5|$|The {{presence}} of an analogous RMS in humans {{has been difficult to}} identify, possibly because the olfactory bulb is significantly less developed in humans than in rodents and thus harder to study, and much of the previous scientific work has been called into question concerning the RMS in humans. In the developing fetal brain and in young postnatal infants, chains of immature neurons typical of the RMS were observed. However, there was little evidence for the existence of a migrating chain along the SVZ or olfactory peduncle to the bulb in the adult human brain, even though there was a distinct population of adult neuronal stem cells in the SVZ. These researchers studied subjects from 0 to 84 years of age by analyzing brain sections that had been removed during <b>surgery</b> <b>or</b> during autopsies. They discovered that cells that expressed DCX (doublecortin) and PSA-NCAM are present in the brain sections taken from infants, but have disappeared by 18 months. Yet further studies indicated the {{presence of}} a small population of migrating immature neurons, which originate solely from the SVZ. These neuroblasts appear singly or in pairs without forming chains, in contrast to the elongated chains of neuroblasts observed in the rodent RMS. This suggests that the RMS is drastically reduced beyond infancy and especially into adulthood, but is not absent. However, a direct correlation between stem cell quiescence and age has not yet been defined due to a high level of variability between individuals. Thus an RMS analogous structure in the adult human brain remains highly controversial.|$|E
