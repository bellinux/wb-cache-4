Aside from the four minutes originally deleted from Lucas' original cut retained, the only major change in the DVD version is the main title sequence, particularly the <b>sky</b> <b>background</b> to Mel's Drive-In, which was redone by ILM. Universal {{released the}} film on Blu-ray on May 31, 2011.|$|E
500|$|While {{preparing}} to film the Fireflash controlled landing sequence, Meddings {{was faced with}} the difficulty of having to build an extended, dynamic runway set in the limited shooting space available at AP Films Studios. His compact and cost-efficient solution was to isolate the basic set elements – the grass verge foreground, the <b>sky</b> <b>background</b> and the tarmac separating them – and construct separate loops of canvas, all painted to represent one element; these were fitted to rollers that, when run at speeds proportionate to their respective distances from the camera, simulated a continuous backdrop. This [...] "rolling road" [...] (or [...] "roller-road") technique marked a progression from the [...] "rolling sky" [...] that had been pioneered in previous Anderson series, such as Stingray.|$|E
500|$|The hangar {{interior}} of the [...] "US Air Base in South Korea", shown crowded with Chinook helicopters, was filmed at RAF Odiham in Hampshire, UK, as were the helicopter interior shots during the Switchblade sequence. These latter scenes, though portrayed in the air, were actually filmed entirely {{on the ground with}} the <b>sky</b> <b>background</b> being added in post-production using blue screen techniques. Although the base is portrayed in the film as a US base, all the aircraft and personnel in the scene are British in real life. In the film, Switchblades (one-person gliders resembling fighter jets in shape) are flown by Bond and Jinx to stealthily enter North Korea. The Switchblade was based on a workable model called [...] "PHASST" [...] (Programmable High Altitude Single Soldier Transport). Kinetic Aerospace Inc.'s lead designer, Jack McCornack was impressed by director Lee Tamahori's way of conducting the Switchblade scene and commented, [...] "It's brief, but realistic. The good guys get in unobserved, thanks to a fast cruise, good glide performance, and minimal radar signature. It's a wonderful promotion for the PHASST." ...|$|E

2500|$|On February 13, 2000, the day {{following}} Schulz's death, the last-ever new Peanuts strip ran in papers. The strip, {{which was}} three panels in length, began with Charlie Brown {{answering the phone}} with someone on the end presumably asking for Snoopy. Charlie Brown responded with [...] "No, I think he's writing." [...] The panel next to [...] shows Snoopy sitting at his typewriter with the opening to a letter, addressed as [...] "Dear Friends". The final panel features a large blue <b>sky</b> <b>background</b> over which several drawings from past strips are placed.

2500|$|The BBC {{continued}} its {{long tradition of}} using special idents at Christmas time throughout this branding period. The first ident, Snowflakes featured children dressed as snowflakes falling to earth and running around against a red <b>sky</b> <b>background.</b> This ident was used in 2002 and, {{for the first time}} in its history, was re-used again in 2003. BBC Two also followed suit the same year, although rather than re-using an ident, they were used alongside that year's newer one. This re-using of the previous years ident caused public controversy and, as a result a new ident, entitled Christmas Puddings, was created the following year. The ident featured children dressed in red and bouncing on Space Hoppers that looked like Christmas puddings against a red background. The ident was designed by a young viewer of the children's programme Blue Peter, as part of a competition. A new ident was commissioned for 2005 entitled Christmas Tree. In this one included children, again dressed in red, walking round a giant Christmas tree, carrying brightly coloured balls. The background this time was green, and the look and music has often been compared to the 2005 film Charlie and the Chocolate Factory directed by Tim Burton. On BBC One Wales, in 2005, an ident was shown to celebrate Wales' win in the 2005 Six Nations Championship. Played to the [...] "Festival" [...] music, it featured Wales supporters celebrating in a public house. The ONE in the BBC ONE box in the bottom-left corner of the screen was replaced with WON.|$|E

And I shall {{attempt to}} do this, first, by {{examining}} what the real effect of the things painted--clouds, or mountains, or whatever else they may be--is, or ought to be, in general, on men's minds, showing the grounds of their beauty or impressiveness as best I can; and then examining how far Turner seems to have understood these reasons of beauty, and how far his work interprets, or can {{take the place of}} nature. But in doing this, I shall, for the sake of convenience, alter the arrangement which I followed in the first volume; and instead of examining the sky first, treat of it last; because, in many illustrations which I must give of other things, I shall have to introduce pieces of <b>sky</b> <b>background</b> which will all be useful for reference when I can turn back to them {{from the end of the}} book, but which I could not refer to in advance without anticipating all my other illustrations. Nevertheless, some points which I have to note respecting the meaning of the sky are so intimately connected with the subjects we have just been examining, that I cannot properly defer their consideration to another place; and I shall state them, therefore, in the next chapter, afterwards proceeding, in the order I adopted in the first volume, to examine the beauty of mountains, water, and vegetation.|$|E

40|$|A {{light test}} {{investigation}} {{was conducted to}} evaluate an infrared (IR) imaging technique to visualize off-surface flow phenomena. A single-engine, general-aviation airplane was equipped with an IR imaging system that viewed the region around the left wingtip. Vortical flow at the wingtip was seeded with surfur hexafluoride, a gas with strong infrared absorbing and emitting characteristics. Different terrain and <b>sky</b> <b>backgrounds</b> were evaluated for their effect on IR images of vortical flow. The best IR images were obtained with a clear background. The {{results of the investigation}} indicate that IR flow visualization compliments existing smoke generator methods for off-surface flow visualization...|$|R
6000|$|... § 19. Before {{the idea}} of {{landscape}} had been thus far developed, the representations of it had been purely typical; the objects {{which had to be}} shown in order to explain the scene of the event, being firmly outlined, usually on a pure golden or chequered color background, not on sky. The change from the golden background, (characteristic of the finest thirteenth century work) and the colored chequer (which in like manner belongs to the finest fourteenth) to the blue sky, gradated to the horizon, takes place early in the fifteenth century, and is the crisis of change in the spirit of mediæval art. Strictly speaking, we might divide the art of Christian times into two great masses--Symbolic and Imitative;--the symbolic, reaching from the earliest periods down to the close of the fourteenth century, and the imitative from that close to the present time; and, then, the most important circumstance indicative of the culminating point, or turn of tide, would be this of the change from chequered background to <b>sky</b> <b>background.</b> The uppermost figure in Plate 7. opposite, representing the tree of knowledge, taken from a somewhat late thirteenth century Hebrew manuscript (Additional 11,639) in the British Museum, will at once illustrate Mr. Macaulay's [...] "serpent turned round the tree," [...] and the mode of introducing the chequer background, will enable the reader better to understand the peculiar feeling of the period, which no more intended the formal walls or streams for an imitative representation of the Garden of Eden, than these chequers for an imitation of sky.|$|E

50|$|However, advancements {{in digital}} {{compositing}} {{and the increasing}} use of digital cameras have made digital the most common method of choice. The last major blockbuster to extensively use front projection was the Sylvester Stallone action thriller Cliffhanger from 1993. More recently, the film Oblivion - starring Tom Cruise - made extensive use of front projection (though not retro-reflective) to display various <b>sky</b> <b>backgrounds</b> in the home set. Skyfall also used this technique for its snow mountain hospital and glass building interiors. The advantages for the in-camera effect were a reduced need for digital effects and green screen, interactive lighting in a reflective set, and to provide a real background for the actors.|$|R
40|$|Two independently-developed optical {{models were}} created to assess the {{feasibility}} of image-based attitude determination of a low-earth-orbit (LEO) satellite using a meter-class deployable telescope. Both models integrate existing AFRL tools for satellite modeling (TASAT) and atmospheric transmission and <b>sky</b> <b>backgrounds</b> (PLEXUS), with different turbulence, image-formation, and speckle-imaging post-processing algorithms. The end-to-end results of the two simulations were compared and found to agree very closely. The results to-date indicate that attitude determination using the best reconstructed images under moderate atmospheric conditions should be possible for a one-meter class telescope. However, images taken at less than ideal viewing angles or with more severe atmospheric conditions are not amenable to attitude determination using only post-processing algorithms. 1...|$|R

5000|$|Much of this {{impression}} was created in-camera, {{thanks to the}} production design for the film. Zeman's crew made and used hard rubber paint rollers to add engraving-like hatching to scenery and costumes. (In {{a review of the}} film, Pauline Kael noted that [...] "there are more stripes, more patterns on the clothing, the decor, and on the image itself than a sane person can easily imagine.") To complete the effect, Zeman and his crew composited the film with various forms of animation, including traditional, cut-out, and stop-motion varieties, along with miniature effects and matte paintings, all designed to keep the engraving style seamlessly consistent. Even stock footage clips—birds, sea waves, and other details—were adapted for the effect by printing the film with lined filters and matted-in <b>sky</b> <b>backgrounds.</b>|$|R
