5|$|When {{an object}} is in {{hydrostatic}} equilibrium, a global layer of liquid covering its surface would form a liquid {{surface of the}} same shape as the body, apart from small-scale surface features such as craters and fissures. If the body does not rotate, {{it will be a}} sphere, but the faster it rotates, the more oblate or even <b>scalene</b> it becomes. If such a rotating body were to be heated until it melted, its overall shape would not change when liquid. The extreme example of a non-spherical body in hydrostatic equilibrium is , which is twice as long along its major axis as it is at the poles. If the body has a massive nearby companion, then tidal forces come into effect as well, distorting it into a prolate spheroid. An example of this is Jupiter's moon Io, which is the most volcanically active body in the Solar System due to effects of tidal heating. Tidal forces also cause a body's rotation to gradually become tidally locked, such that it always presents the same face to its companion. An extreme example of this is the Pluto–Charon system, where both bodies are tidally locked to each other. Earth's Moon is also tidally locked, as are many satellites of the gas giants.|$|E

40|$|Study Design. Cross-sectional study. Objective. This study {{compared}} neck muscle activation patterns {{during and}} after a repetitive upper limb task between patients with idiopathic neck pain, whiplash-associated disorders, and controls. Summary of Background Data. Previous studies have identified altered motor control of the upper trapezius during functional tasks in patients with neck pain. Whether the cervical flexor muscles demonstrate altered motor control during functional activities is unknown. Methods. Electromyographic activity was recorded from the sternocleidomastoid, anterior <b>scalenes,</b> and upper trapezius muscles. Root mean square electromyographic amplitude was calculated during and on completion of a functional task. Results. A general trend was evident to suggest greatest electromyograph amplitude in the sternocleidomastoid, anterior <b>scalenes,</b> and left upper trapezius muscles for the whiplash-associated disorders group, followed by the idiopathic group, with lowest electromyographic amplitude recorded for the control group. A reverse effect was apparent for the right upper trapezius muscle. The level of perceived disability (Neck Disability Index score) {{had a significant effect}} on the electromyographic amplitude recorded between neck pain patients. Conclusions. Patients with neck pain demonstrated greater activation of accessory neck muscles during a repetitive upper limb task compared to asymptomatic controls. Greater activation of the cervical muscles in patients with neck pain may represent an altered pattern of motor control to compensate for reduced activation of painful muscles. Greater perceived disability among patients with neck pain accounted for the greater electromyographic amplitude of the superficial cervical muscles during performance of the functional task...|$|R

The aim of the current work was to assess the long-term reliability of measurements of cervical muscle size. In addition, we examined the utility of selecting specific sub-regions of muscles at each vertebral level, averaging between sides of the body, and pooling muscles into larger groups. Axial scans from the base of skull to the third thoracic vertebra were performed in 20 healthy male subjects at baseline and 1. 5  years later. We evaluated the semi-spinalis capitis, splenius capitis, spinalis cervicis, longus capitis, longus colli, levator scapulae, sternocleidomastoid, anterior <b>scalenes</b> and middle with posterior <b>scalenes.</b> Bland-Altman analysis showed all measurements to be repeatable between testing-days. Reliability was typically best when entire muscle volume was measured (co-efficients of variation (CVs) : 3. 3 - 8. 1 % depending on muscle). However, when the size of the muscle was assessed at specific vertebral levels, similar measurement precision was achieved (CVs: 2. 7 - 7. 6 %). A median of 4 - 6 images were measured at the specific vertebral levels versus 18 - 37 images for entire muscle volume. This would represent considerable time saving. Based on the findings we also recommend measuring both sides of the body and calculating an average value. Pooling specific muscles into the deep neck flexors (CV: 3. 5 %) and neck extensors (CV: 2. 7 %) can serve to reduce variability further.

In the 2 nd Berlin BedRest Study (BBR 2 - 2), 24 male subjects underwent 60 -day bed rest and performed either no exercise, resistive exercise, or resistive exercise with whole body vibration. Subjects were followed for 2 yr after bed rest. On axial cervical magnetic resonance images from the skull to T 3, the volumes of the semispinalis capitis, splenius capitis, spinalis cervicis, longus capitis, longus colli, levator scapulae, sternocleidomastoid, middle and posterior <b>scalenes,</b> and anterior <b>scalenes</b> were measured. Disc height, anteroposterior width, and volume were measured from C 2 / 3 to T 6 / 7 on sagittal images. The volume of all muscles, {{with the exception of}} semispinalis capitis, increased during bed rest (P < 0. 025). There {{were no significant differences between}} the groups for changes in the muscles. Increased upper and midthoracic spine disc height and volume (P < 0. 001) was seen during bed rest, and disc height increases persisted at least 6 mo after bed rest. Increases in thoracic disc height were greater (P = 0. 003) in the resistive vibration exercise group than in control. On radiological review, two subjects showed new injuries to the mid-lower thoracic spine. One of these subjects reported a midthoracic pain incident during maximal strength testing before bed rest and the other after countermeasure exercise on day 3 of bed rest. We conclude that bed rest is associated with increased disc size in the thoracic region and increases in muscle volume at the neck.

25|$|In its {{physical}} aspect, singing has a well-defined technique {{that depends on}} the use of the lungs, which act as an air supply or bellows; on the larynx, which acts as a reed or vibrator; on the chest and head cavities, which have the function of an amplifier, as the tube in a wind instrument; and on the tongue, which together with the palate, teeth, and lips articulate and impose consonants and vowels on the amplified sound. Though these four mechanisms function independently, they are nevertheless coordinated in the establishment of a vocal technique and are made to interact upon one another. During passive breathing, air is inhaled with the diaphragm while exhalation occurs without any effort. Exhalation may be aided by the abdominal, internal intercostal and lower pelvis/pelvic muscles. Inhalation is aided by use of external intercostals, <b>scalenes,</b> and sternocleidomastoid muscles. The pitch is altered with the vocal cords. With the lips closed, this is called humming.|$|R

40|$|Accounts of {{breathing}} in methodological books on singing are often confusing or inaccurate rather than helpful. This chapter {{provides an overview}} of the principles of respiration and how this is modified for singing. Inspiration results from an increase in thoracic dimensions caused by activity in the diaphragm and external intercostal muscles. At high lung volumes the sternocleidomastoids and <b>scalenes</b> also aid chest expansion. Subglottic pressure is created during expiration by the contraction of the abdominal wall, predominantly as a result of lateral abdominal muscle activity, which drives the relaxed diaphragm upwards while simultaneously the internal intercostals pull the ribs downwards. When the lungs are full and the inspiratory muscles release, elastic recoil forces alone can drive out the air and in order to regulate subglottic pressure these forces must be resisted by gradually reducing inspiratory muscle activity. How different patterns of activity in these and other muscles contribute to singing is described {{and the way in which}} similar ends can be achieved by different means in different singers is explained...|$|R

40|$|This article {{examines}} {{the mechanics of the}} muscles that drive expansion or contraction of the chest wall during breathing. The diaphragm is the main inspiratory muscle. When its muscle fibers are activated in isolation, they shorten, the dome of the diaphragm descends, pleural pressure (P(pl)) falls, and abdominal pressure (P(ab)) rises. As a result, the ventral abdominal wall expands, but a large fraction of the rib cage contracts. Expansion of the rib cage during inspiration is produced by the external intercostals in the dorsal portion of the rostral interspaces, the intercartilaginous portion of the internal intercostals (the so-called parasternal intercostals), and, in humans, the <b>scalenes.</b> By elevating the ribs and causing an additional fall in P(pl), these muscles not only help the diaphragm expand the chest wall and the lung, but they also increase the load on the diaphragm and reduce the shortening of the diaphragmatic muscle fibers. The capacity of the diaphragm to generate pressure is therefore enhanced. In contrast, during expiratory efforts, activation of the abdominal muscles produces a rise in P(ab) that leads to a cranial displacement of the diaphragm into the pleural cavity and a rise in P(pl). Concomitant activation of the internal interosseous intercostals in the caudal interspaces and the triangularis sterni during such efforts contracts the rib cage and helps the abdominal muscles deflate the lung.

40|$|Hyperinflation clearly affects {{respiratory}} muscle interaction. It commonly {{increases the}} rib cage contribution to chest wall motion, whilst {{it reduces the}} abdominal contribution. This change is thought to result {{from the fact that}} hyperinflation severely reduces the mechanical advantage of the diaphragm, whilst it affects the mechanical advantage of the neck and rib cage muscles to a lesser extent. The mechanical disadvantage in the diaphragm induced by hyperinflation is presumably primarily the result of the length changes undergone by the diaphragm in acute hyperinflation. Changes in diaphragmatic geometry are generally considered to be less important in the reduction of the diaphragm's force-generating capacity. Further factors contributing to the mechanical disadvantage in the diaphragm include a reduction in the appositional component of diaphragmatic action (through reduction in the zone of apposition), and a reduction in the insertional component (through a shift in the alignment of the diaphragmatic fibres from axial to radial). In chronic hyperinflation, the diaphragm adapts to the chronically hyperinflated state. This adaptation to chronic foreshortening is similar to the adaptation occurring in the skeletal muscle. It is caused by a dropout of sarcomeres in series along the muscle fibres. It restores the force-generating capacity of the muscle, in part, but it reduces the capacity of the muscle to undergo length changes. The mechanical advantage of the parasternal intercostals and the <b>scalenes</b> is possibly less affected, because the length changes undergone by these muscles during hyperinflation are smaller. The factors determining the mechanical advantage of the parasternal intercostals are complex. Variables related to the mechanical advantage of the parasternal intercostals include: length changes; changes in angle between the parasternal intercostals and the sternum and between rib and sternum; and changes in mechanical arrangement among different parasternals. At present, it is difficult to develop an integrated view of these factors and of their change with hyperinflation. Finally, hyperinflation commonly results in recruitment of expiratory muscles. The functional significance of this expiratory muscle recruitment in patients is still debated. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Background: Lateral epicondylitis, {{also known}} as tennis elbow, {{is the most common}} overuse {{syndrome}} of the elbow. The severity of pain may not be directly caused by tendinopathy of wrist extensors since trigger points of the shoulder muscles have a referral zone in the arm and elbow. Therefore the aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effect of dry needling of shoulder myofascial trigger points on wrist extensors muscles pain and function. Methods: Fourteen female patients with tennis elbow (aged 20 - 45 years old) were recruited after primary evaluation by an orthopedist. They entered the study if they had pain in the lateral aspect of elbow of the dominant hand for more than 3 months along with the presence of myofascial trigger points in any muscles of supra spinatus, infra spinatus, sub scapularis or <b>scalenes.</b> Pain pressure threshold, maximal grip force and pain intensity of the hand extensors on lateral epicondyle of elbow were measured before and after treatment. Pain intensity was measured on a one to ten scale of visual analogue scale (VAS). A hand dynamometer used to measure the maximal grip force value of the affected hand in 0 ˚shoulder flexion/ abduction, 90 ˚ elbow extension and mid-poison of forearm in sitting position. A pressure algometer was applied on hand extensor muscles to define their trigger point sensitivity. For the control group, treatment regimens consisted of routine physical therapy of tennis elbow. This regime was accompanied by dry needling of mentioned muscles for the intervention group. Wilcoxon and Mann-Whitney non-parametric tests were used for statistical analysis. Results: Comparison of the results after intervention showed that the patients’ pain significantly decreased in both groups (P< 0. 001); but the patient’s PPT and grip force significantly increased solely in the intervention group (P< 0. 05). Mann Whitney test showed significant pain differences in both groups (P= 0. 001). The comparison of differences showed that the grip force and PPT statistically improved in the intervention group (P< 0. 05). Conclusion: Dry needling of affected shoulder muscles along with routine physical therapy has a more significant effect on improvement of pain, sensitivity and grip power of patient’s with tennis elbow syndrome...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} the neural {{control of the}} human inspiratory muscles. Single motor unit and multiunit electromyographic recordings are made from inspiratory and limb muscles to investigate the organisation of inspiratory motoneurone output and strategies by which motoneurone output is optimised. In the first two chapters, the output of parasternal intercostal motor units in respiratory and non-respiratory &# 145;tasks&# 146; are described. The results show that across parasternal intercostal spaces, there is a decreasing rostrocaudal gradient of motor unit output in targeted voluntary breaths, such that inspiratory activity is greatest and earliest in cranial interspaces. This topographic recruitment is similar to quiet breaths {{and the majority of}} motor units are active in both voluntary and quiet breaths. In a non-respiratory voluntary task, rotation of the trunk (Chapter 3), common motor units are also active, but inspiratory motor unit output {{on both sides of the}} chest wall is altered by unilateral rotation. Multiple descending drives to the respiratory muscles may be organised and integrated at the spinal cord such that the same motoneurones are depolarised but their output depends on the task(s) performed. The strategy of motor unit recruitment in two inspiratory muscles is examined in Chapter 4. The profiles of activation of an obligatory inspiratory muscle, <b>scalenes,</b> and an accessory muscle, sternocleidomastoid, are not altered by lung volume or task (isovolumetric &# 145;static&# 146; versus &# 145;dynamic&# 146; task). Rather than the activation of these muscles being dependent on afferent signals of lung volume, they are recruited according to their relative mechanical advantage for inspiration. These results suggest that neural drive to these muscles has an element that is &# 145;preset&# 146;. The final study investigates neural and mechanical behaviour in the first dorsal interosseous muscle. The results show that there is coupling between neural drive and mechanical advantage in a limb muscle, as occurs for the intercostal muscles during inspiration. Furthermore, this coupling is adaptable to acute changes in mechanical advantage. There is an increase in motor unit recruitment in first dorsal interosseous when it has a greater mechanical effectiveness in an index finger flexion task. This is consistent with a strategy to produce efficient voluntary movements...|$|R
