40|$|SUMMARY: Many {{strains of}} Corynebacterium diphtheriae carry phages capable of lysing other strains. Diphtheria phages are type-specific {{and do not}} lyse strains which are serologically {{unrelated}} but susceptibility to a phage may vary among different {{members of the same}} <b>serological</b> <b>type</b> and this can be used to differentiate subtypes of different biological behaviour. Phage-resistant mutants are readily selected in diphtheria cultures and the resistant mutants frequently have charac-teristics quite distinct from those of the parent strain, e. g. virulent organisms have been isolated from a number of avirulent strains. It is suggested that the possibility of converting avirulent strains to virulent ones may be of importance epidemio-logically and that the phage selection of mutants may account for the wide variety of <b>serological</b> <b>types</b> isolated from patients. Some strains found to be resistant to type-specific phages {{have been shown to be}} lysogenic and when subjected to ultra-violet irradiation liberate phage particles which are capable of lysing susceptible strains of the same <b>serological</b> <b>type.</b> The diphtheria phages investigated are thermo-labile, difficult to filter, of fairly large size and give rise to small plaques of lysi...|$|R

50|$|Earlier <b>serological</b> <b>typing</b> {{approaches}} {{had been}} established for differentiating bacterial isolates, but immunological typing has drawbacks such as reliance on few antigenic loci and unpredictable reactivities of antibodies with different antigenic variants. Several molecular typing schemes have been proposed to determine the relatedness of pathogens such as pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), ribotyping, and PCR-based fingerprinting. But these DNA banding-based subtyping methods do not provide meaningful evolutionary analyses. Despite PFGE being considered by many researchers as the “gold standard”, many strains are not typable by this technique due to the degradation of the DNA during the process (gel smears).|$|E

5000|$|In 1975, {{association}} with [...] "HL-A1,8" [...] (Current name: HLA A1-B8) {{was confirmed by}} <b>serological</b> <b>typing</b> of cells from myasthenics. [...] However, in a larger sample the risk association was found closer to [...] "HL-A8" [...] (Current name: HLA-B8). This association later migrated to the [...] "B8-DRw3" [...] (Current: B8-DR3) region. There are two major DR3 haplotypes in Europe, A1::DQ2 and A30-B18-DR3-DQ2. Linkage with disease could more firmly be attributed to B8::DQ2 portion of A1::DQ2 relative to A30-B18::DQ2, indicating some involvement of other B8-DR3 gene-alleles in disease. The association of the B8::DQ2 region is primarily seen in females with age-relative thymic hyperplasia. Later the level of anti-acetylcholine receptor antibodies in disease were found to correlate with B8::DR3. Later {{it was found that}} both DQ2.5 and DQ2.2(A DQ haplotype of DR7-DQ2) were positively associated with disease. There remains controversy over whether DR3 or DQ2 confers primary susceptibility to myasthenia gravis. In some studies no {{association with}} either has been observed. To segregate disease groups have attempted to further define population to earliest onset (presumbably most susceptibility) and females. In these studies link with B8 was greater than DR3, so that susceptibility moves from class II to Class III or Class I loci. The association with class I would be unusual since T-helper mediated autoantibody production is characteristic of disease, whereas class I mediated cytotoxicity is not. MICA and MICB are intestinally expressed. There are many genes that lie on either side of HLA-B, TNF alpha is over expressed. Closer to DR3, C4A is null in B8-DR3 haplotype.|$|E
40|$|Individual <b>serological</b> <b>types</b> occur among Group B streptococci, and in {{a recent}} report from this {{laboratory}} attention was directed to the type-specific substances of these microorganisms (1).
