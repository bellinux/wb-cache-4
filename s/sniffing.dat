5|$|Tourette {{syndrome}} (TS {{or simply}} Tourette's) {{is a common}} neuropsychiatric disorder with onset in childhood, characterized by multiple motor tics {{and at least one}} vocal (phonic) tic. These tics characteristically wax and wane, can be suppressed temporarily, and are typically preceded by an unwanted urge or sensation in the affected muscles. Some common tics are eye blinking, coughing, throat clearing, <b>sniffing,</b> and facial movements. Tourette's does not adversely affect intelligence or life expectancy.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: <b>Sniff</b> nasal inspiratory {{pressure}} (SNIP) measurement is a volitional noninvasive {{assessment of}} inspiratory muscle strength. A maximum of 10 <b>sniffs</b> is generally used. The {{purpose of the}} present study was to investigate whether the maximum SNIP improved after the tenth <b>sniff.</b> In total, 20 healthy volunteers and 305 patients with various neuromuscular and lung diseases were encouraged to perform 40 and 20 <b>sniffs,</b> respectively. The best SNIP among the first 10 <b>sniffs</b> was lower than the best SNIP among the next 10 <b>sniffs</b> in the healthy volunteers and patients. The SNIP improvement after the twentieth <b>sniff</b> was marginal. In conclusion, a learning effect persists after the tenth <b>sniff.</b> The current authors suggest using 10 additional <b>sniffs</b> when the best result of the first 10 <b>sniffs</b> is slightly below normal, or when <b>sniff</b> nasal inspiratory pressure is used to monitor a progressive decline in inspiratory muscle strength...|$|R

5|$|Noted hadrosaur expert Jack Horner is {{currently}} the major advocate {{of the idea that}} Tyrannosaurus was exclusively a scavenger and did not engage in active hunting at all. Horner has presented several arguments to support the pure scavenger hypothesis. The presence of large olfactory bulbs and olfactory nerves suggests a highly developed sense of smell for <b>sniffing</b> out carcasses over great distances. The teeth could crush bone, and therefore could extract as much food (bone marrow) as possible from carcass remnants, usually the least nutritious parts. At least some of its potential prey could move quickly, while evidence suggests that Tyrannosaurus walked instead of ran.|$|E

5|$|A {{dominant}} male black wildebeest {{will have}} a harem of females and will not allow other males to mate with them. The breeding season occurs {{at the end of}} the rainy season and lasts a few weeks between February and April. When one of his females comes into oestrus the male concentrates on her and mates with her several times. Sexual behaviour by the male at this time includes stretching low, ears down, <b>sniffing</b> of the female's vulva, performing ritual urination and touching his chin to the female's rump. At the same time, the female keeps her tail upwards (sometimes vertically) or swishes it across the face of the male. The pair usually separates after copulation, but the female occasionally follows her mate afterwards, touching his rump with her snout. During the breeding season, the male loses condition as he spends little time grazing. Males are known to mount other males.|$|E
5|$|As they {{stake out}} their territories and compete for females, males exhibit rivalry. When they clash, they {{face up to}} each other with bent knees and {{exchange}} horn thrusts. Elaborate individual displays are made during their rivalry and they may bellow, snort and dig their horns into the ground. Once dominance has been established, each male attempts to lure the female into his domain. During courtship, urination and low-stretch are common activities and the male soon attempts to mount the female. A receptive female holds her tail {{to one side and}} stands still while copulation takes place. Matings may be repeated several times and may take place twice or more times within a minute. The male neither eats nor rests when a female is present in his territory and during this time, the female keeps close to the male, often rubbing her head on his torso and <b>sniffing</b> his penis. While in season, a female may visit several territories and mate with several different males.|$|E
5|$|Shortly before {{mating season}} begins, females exhibit {{swelling}} of the sex skin, which reaches its peak around {{the middle of their}} 14.8 day estrous cycle. Male sexual physiology also undergoes its own change, with testicular volume increasing during mating season, peaking around the time of breeding. Aggression also increases during the mating season, both between members of the same sex and by females towards the male attempting to mate with her. Females have been observed grappling, cuffing, and biting the male during copulation. Either sex may approach the other when the female is in estrus. Initially they may roar-shriek with each other. When a male approaches a female he often lowers his head and squeals, inspecting the female's genitalia by licking or <b>sniffing,</b> scent-marking, and offering a submissive chattering vocalization. When a female approaches a male, she may posture herself for mounting. Mating pairs often copulate many times {{during the course of a}} mating bout.|$|E

5|$|The tammar wallaby has a {{promiscuous}} mating system. It is {{a seasonal}} breeder and births largely occur during late January and early February. During the breeding season, the male's prostate and bulbourethral gland enlarge. However, {{there does not}} appear to be any seasonal difference in the weight of the testes. Around two weeks before the first births, the males will begin <b>sniffing</b> the uro-genital openings and pouches of the females to determine their reproductive status. After giving birth, females enter estrus and allow males to mate with them. However, a male that attempts to mate with an estrous female may face aggression from other males. A male can achieve reproductive success by mate-guarding. During the estrous period, males establish a dominance hierarchy and the higher ranking males will try to prevent subordinates from mating with estrous females. Several males may pursue a single female.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND [...] Slowing of {{the maximum}} {{relaxation}} rate (MRR) of inspiratory muscles measured from oesophageal pressure (POES) during <b>sniffs</b> {{has been used as}} an index of the onset and recovery of respiratory muscle fatigue. The {{purpose of this study was}} to measure MRR at the nose (PNASAL MRR), to investigate its relationship with POES MRR, and to establish whether PNASAL MRR slows with respiratory loading. METHODS [...] Five normal subjects were studied. Each performed <b>sniffs</b> before and after two minutes of maximal isocapnic ventilation (MIV). In a separate session the subjects performed submaximal <b>sniffs.</b> POES and PNASAL were recorded during <b>sniffs</b> and the MRR (% pressure fall/ 10 ms) for each <b>sniff</b> was determined. RESULTS [...] Before MIV mean POES MRR was 8. 9 and PNASAL MRR was 9. 3. The mean (SD) difference between PNASAL MRR and POES MRR during a maximal <b>sniff</b> was 0. 48 (0. 34) (n = 64) and during submaximal <b>sniffs</b> was 0. 28 (0. 46) (n = 526). The subjects showed a mean decrease in <b>sniff</b> POES MRR of 27. 4 % (range 22. 5 - 36 %) after MIV and a similar reduction in <b>sniff</b> PNASAL MRR of 28. 5 % (range 24. 1 - 41. 3 %). Both returned to control values within 5 - 10 minutes. CONCLUSIONS [...] PNASAL MRR reflects POES MRR over a wide range of <b>sniff</b> pressures, PNASAL MRR of maximal <b>sniffs</b> reflects POES MRR in normal subjects at rest and following MIV, so measurement of PNASAL MRR may be a useful non-invasive method for measuring inspiratory muscle MRR, thereby providing an index of respiratory muscle fatigue...|$|R

5|$|Inquisitive foxes will rotate and flick {{their ears}} whilst <b>sniffing.</b> Playful {{individuals}} will perk their ears and rise on their hind legs. Male foxes courting females, or after successfully evicting intruders, will turn their ears outwardly, {{and raise their}} tails in a horizontal position, with the tips raised upward. When afraid, red foxes grin in submission, arching their backs, curving their bodies, crouching their legs and lashing their tails {{back and forth with}} their ears pointing backwards and pressed against their skulls. When merely expressing submission to a dominant animal, the posture is similar, but without arching the back or curving the body. Submissive foxes will approach dominant animals in a low posture, so that their muzzles reach up in greeting. When two evenly matched foxes confront each other over food, they approach each other sideways and push against each other's flanks, betraying a mixture of fear and aggression through lashing tails and arched backs without crouching and pulling their ears back without flattening them against their skulls. When launching an assertive attack, red foxes approach directly rather than sideways, with their tails aloft and their ears rotated sideways. During such fights, red foxes will stand on each other's upper bodies with their forelegs, using open mouthed threats. Such fights typically only occur among juveniles or adults of the same sex.|$|E

40|$|The <b>sniff</b> {{maneuver}} {{has recently}} been advocated for assessing inspiratory muscle strength. We characterized the relationship between mouth pressure (Pmo) and esophageal pressure (Pes) during <b>sniffs</b> performed with open, semi-occluded, and occluded nose. In seven normal subjects, pressure was simultaneously measured with a mouthpiece (Pmo) an esophageal balloon (Pes) during high- and low-intensity <b>sniffs</b> performed from FRC. With open nose, the mean ratio Pmo/Pes was 0. 96 +/- 0. 05 (mean +/- SE). The mean ratio Pmo/Pes was not significantly different in high- and low-intensity <b>sniffs.</b> With one nostril occluded, the mean ratio Pmo/Pes was 1. 03 +/- 0. 04. The ratio Pmo/Pes {{was significantly higher than}} with open nose for all <b>sniffs</b> (P less than 0. 05) and low-intensity <b>sniffs</b> (P less than 0. 01). With both nostrils occluded, the mean ratio Pmo/Pes was 1. 06 +/- 0. 03, with occasional marked overestimation of Pes by Pmo. We conclude that Pmo generally reflects Pes during <b>sniffs</b> performed with open and semi-occluded nose, but not with complete nasal occlusion...|$|R
