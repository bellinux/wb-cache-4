5|$|Infantry units mostly {{fought in}} close order as did their forebears from the Principate. Infantry {{equipment}} was broadly <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> auxiliaries in the 2nd century, with some modifications (see Equipment, below).|$|E
5|$|Investigations into {{long-term}} seed storage {{have shown}} B.acanthopoda to store well under standard genebank storage conditions.

5|$|Peléan eruptions are {{characterized}} most prominently by the incandescent pyroclastic flows that they drive. The mechanics of a Peléan eruption are very <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> a Vulcanian eruption, except that in Peléan eruptions the volcano's structure {{is able to}} withstand more pressure, hence the eruption occurs as one large explosion rather than several smaller ones.|$|E

Also, the metallicity of Sakurai's object in 1996 was <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> V605 Aquilae in 1921. However, it is expected that Sakurai's object will grow in its metallicity to match that of V605 Aquilae.|$|E
