5|$|They began a {{rivalry with}} the team of Paul London and Brian Kendrick that lasted over three months, until the Judgment Day {{pay-per-view}} on May 21, 2006, where MNM lost the tag team title to London and Kendrick. Nitro and Melina <b>suddenly</b> <b>turned</b> on Mercury, attacking him and breaking up the group. Later that night Nitro and Melina were fired from the SmackDown' brand in storyline, to facilitate their move to Raw, where they reappeared the following week. The legitimate reason for the team's sudden split was later revealed to be Mercury failing a WWE Wellness Policy drug test and being forced to serve a 30-day suspension.|$|E
5|$|After leaving Khwarizm, Qutayba {{initially}} turned towards Merv, for {{his army}} had grown weary and demanded {{an end to}} the campaign. During the march, however, Qutayba <b>suddenly</b> <b>turned</b> the army around towards Samarkand. The Sogdians had disbanded most of their forces, and the Arabs, reinforced with levies from Bukhara and Khwarizm, were able to brush aside the local resistance and advance straight to the city itself and lay siege to it. Ghurak and the inhabitants of the city resisted the Arabs with determination, and called upon the rulers of Shash and the Ferghana Valley for aid. The ruler of Shash indeed sent a strong army to aid them, but it was ambushed and destroyed by the Arabs. The news of this arrived at the time where the Arab siege weapons had effected a breach in the city walls, forcing Ghurak to sue for peace. Qutayba initially granted surprisingly lenient terms: the payment of an annual tribute and the provision of an auxiliary corps as with Bukhara and Khwarizm, as well as the construction of a mosque inside the city and the celebration of prayers there by the Arab army. Once inside the city however, Qutayba proceeded to occupy and garrison it. One of his brothers (accounts differ between Abd al-Rahman and Abdallah) was left as governor, and orders were given prohibiting any non-Muslim access to the city citadel. Ghurak and his retinue left the city and founded a new town, Farankath, further to the north. This treachery enabled Qutayba to bring most of Transoxiana under his (albeit tentative) control, but it also considerably tarnished his prestige among the Sogdians.|$|E

5|$|The ITCZ became {{active in}} late March, {{spawning}} several areas of convection across the Indian Ocean {{and into the}} adjacent Australian basin. The westernmost system had a circulation as of March31 about 600km (370mi) west-southwest of Diego Garcia. Despite favorable conditions, the system failed to organize at first, although it became Tropical Disturbance 9 on April2 after the structure improved. Drifting to the southwest and later to the south, the associated convection waxed and waned, finally organizing more on April4; on that day, the disturbance quickly intensified into Moderate Tropical Storm Evariste. A day prior, the JTWC had initiated advisories on the system as Tropical Cyclone 18S. A trough to the south weakened the ridge, turning the storm to the southwest. A small eye formed on April5, but later dissipated after an increase in thunderstorm activity. On that day, the MFR estimated peak 10minute winds of 110km/h (70mph), just shy of tropical cyclone status, while the JTWC estimated 1minute winds of 140km/h (85mph). On April6, increased wind shear from the approaching trough began weakening Evariste and turned it to the south. That day, it passed about 135km (85mph) east of St. Brandon, and on April7, Evariste bypassed Rodrigues about 200km (125mi) to the southwest. The convection gradually deteriorated and left the circulation exposed. Late on April7, the storm <b>suddenly</b> <b>turned</b> southwestward toward a developing low east of Madagascar, although the southwest motion resumed soon after. On April8, Evariste dissipated, dissipating ahead of the nearby trough.|$|E
25|$|On 22 August 1905 another violent event occurred: The police {{opened fire}} on an {{estimated}} 3,000 demonstrating agricultural workers. Only a few months later, 19–20 October 1905, a further protest occurred, helping to force the hand of Nicholas II in bringing about the October Manifesto. However, these demonstrations <b>suddenly</b> <b>turned</b> into another anti-Jewish pogrom, resulting in 19 deaths.|$|E

25|$|After the June 15 {{episode of}} Nitro, Savage took a hiatus {{from the company}} to recover from at least two major knee surgeries.

25|$|In {{the late}} 17th century, or early 18th, Ngāti Whātua {{occupied}} the Pouto Peninsula {{as part of}} their move southwards. In 1820, during the Musket Wars, Ngā Puhi laid siege to Ngāti Whātua's Tauhara pa near Pouto, but were unable to capture it. A truce was agreed, to be cemented by the marriage of a Ngā Puhi chief to the daughter of a Ngāti Whātua chief. During the festivities, Ngā Puhi and their allies <b>suddenly</b> <b>turned</b> on their hosts and massacred them.|$|E
25|$|Willett was outnumbered, but divided {{his forces}} {{and sent a}} small group of men around the enemy flank to attack them from the rear. He {{advanced}} his men across an open field towards the British, who withdrew into the edge of a forest. There followed an intense fight, and the only artillery piece on the field, which began in the possession of Willett's men, was captured and recaptured repeatedly. For unknown reasons, the militia on Willett's right flank <b>suddenly</b> <b>turned</b> and fled in a panic, and Willett tried to halt the retreat and turn his men.|$|E

Pang De {{wanted to use the}} opportunity to attack but Yu Jin (who was his superior) stopped him.|$|E
25|$|Vladimir Lenin soon sent Lev Kamenev to Ukraine, who {{conducted}} a cordial interview with Makhno. After Kamenev's departure, Makhno {{claimed to have}} intercepted two Bolshevik messages, the first an order to the Red Army to attack the Makhnovists, the second ordering Makhno's assassination. Soon after the Fourth Congress, Trotsky sent an order to arrest every Nabat congress member. Pursued by White Army forces, Makhno and the Black Army responded by withdrawing further into the interior of Ukraine. In 1919, the Black Army <b>suddenly</b> <b>turned</b> eastwards in a full-scale offensive, surprising General Denikin's White forces and causing them to fall back. Within two weeks, Makhno and the Black Army had recaptured all of the southern Ukraine.|$|E
25|$|Luger then befriended Barry Windham, {{his former}} Florida ally. They formed a tag team, dubbed The Twin Towers. The Twin Towers first teamed on March 27, 1988 at Clash of the Champions to defeat Tully Blanchard and Arn Anderson for the NWA World Tag Team Championship. Only {{a few weeks}} after the title win, Windham <b>suddenly</b> <b>turned</b> on Luger during a title defense (against Blanchard and Anderson) and joining Luger's former stable, The Four Horsemen. Days later, the Jim Crockett, Sr. Memorial Cup Tag Team Tournament was held with its first night in Greenville, South Carolina. A partner-less Luger was teamed with Sting (whose partner Ronnie Garvin had been kayfabe injured) and the impromptu team won the entire tournament, {{defeating}} Blanchard and Anderson in the finals.|$|E

25|$|Emperor Napoleon I plotted {{to replace}} the royal family of the Kingdom of Spain. Pursuant to his design, he ordered several key points, {{including}} Barcelona, to be seized in February 1808. On 29 February, General of Division Giuseppe Lechi's Imperial French troops were marching through Barcelona, ostensibly to help fight Portugal. Lechi staged a military review, {{but it was a}} cover for gaining control of the citadel. As the soldiers marched past the main gate of the fortress, they <b>suddenly</b> <b>turned</b> left and rushed inside. Without spilling a drop of blood, the Imperial troops herded the baffled Spanish garrison out of the fortifications and occupied the place. Among other key points, the French also grabbed San Sebastian, Pamplona and Figueras. On 2 May 1808, the infuriated Spanish people rose in rebellion against their French occupiers.|$|E
25|$|Throughout Genie's {{stay the}} {{scientists}} saw how frequently and effectively {{she used her}} nonverbal skills, and never determined what she did to elicit such strong reactions from other people. David Rigler vividly remembered an occasion when he and Genie passed {{a father and a}} young boy carrying a toy firetruck without speaking to each other, and said the boy <b>suddenly</b> <b>turned</b> around and gave the firetruck to Genie. Curtiss also recalled one time when, while she and Genie were walking and had stopped at a busy intersection, she unexpectedly heard a purse emptying; she turned to see a woman stop at the intersection and exit her car to give Genie a plastic purse, even though Genie had not said anything. To take full advantage of her nonverbal communication abilities, in 1974 the Riglers arranged for her to learn a form of sign language.|$|E
25|$|After leaving Ager Falernus {{through the}} pass of Callifae, Hannibal retraced his steps, moving east towards Molise. The Carthaginian army, {{encumbered}} with plunder and herds of cattle, moved slowly, seeking {{a place to}} set up their winter quarters. Fabius and the Romans dogged the Carthaginians from a distance and avoided direct confrontation with them. Hannibal marched north to Venefram, which caused alarm in Rome as that city {{was thought to be}} the Carthaginian objective. Then the Carthaginian army <b>suddenly</b> <b>turned</b> east into Samnium, and after crossing the Apennine Mountains and moving through the Pelignial plains, finally entered Molise. Fabius continued to follow Hannibal, and when the Carthaginians reached near the modern-day village of Casacalenda and took over a town named Geronium, Fabius set up his camp at Larinum, 20 miles to the south. The Carthaginians had cut a swath of destruction in their march, ravishing farms and property, collecting provisions and prisoners as they moved, unopposed by Fabius.|$|E

25|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{stand-off}} in Thebes, Agesilaus disbanded his army in Thespiae {{and returned to}} Peloponnesos through Megara. He left the general Phoebidas as his harmost (military governor) at Thespiae, the same general responsible for the Spartan seizure of the citadel of Cadmea in 382 BC. Phoebidas began making various raids into Theban territory using the Spartans under his command and Thespian conscripts. These forays became so destructive {{that by the end}} of the summer, the Thebans went out in force against Thespiae under the command of Gorgidas. Phoebidas engaged the advancing Theban army with his peltasts. The harrying of the light infantry apparently proved too much for the Thebans and they started to retreat. Phoebidas, hoping for a rout, rashly pursed them closely. However, the Theban forces <b>suddenly</b> <b>turned</b> around and charged Phoebidas' forces. Phoebidas was killed by the Theban cavalry. His peltasts broke ranks and fled back to Thespiae pursued by Theban forces. Aside from Polyaenus, none of these accounts mention the Sacred Band by name, but given that they were under the command of Gorgidas, they are likely to have been part of Theban forces involved.|$|E
25|$|The Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo came in 1932. In 1934, Houston Junior College {{became a}} {{four-year}} institution and {{changed its name}} to the University of Houston. A flood in 1935 <b>suddenly</b> <b>turned</b> conditions for the worst, and Houstonians were forced to clean up the mess. Air service by Braniff Airways and Eastern Air Lines came in 1935 and 1936. By the end of the decade, Houston was encountering growth pains, as the city had inadequate air service and that it was no longer a frontier town. Houston became the largest city in Texas in terms of population in 1939. Many immigrants and African-Americans from Louisiana and other parts of Texas moved to the city to find education or work. The city obtained a very multicultural atmosphere, with large African-American and immigrant communities scattered about. However, African-Americans faced bad housing and poor jobs during this time period. Nevertheless, African-American society developed so much that the city was, and still is, the African-American capital of Texas. The University of Houston moved to its present-day location donated by the Cullen family off of what would later be the first freeway in Houston, U.S. Highway 75 (now called Interstate 45), or Gulf Freeway.|$|E
25|$|In January 2002, {{a man was}} {{attacked}} by a Siberian tiger on a remote mountain road near Hunchun in Jilin Province, China, near the borders of Russia and North Korea. He suffered compound fractures but managed to survive. When he sought medical attention, his story raised suspicions as Siberian tigers seldom attack humans. An investigation of the attack scene revealed that raw venison carried by the man was left untouched by the tiger. Officials suspected the man to be a poacher who provoked the attack. The following morning, tiger sightings were reported by locals along the same road, and a local TV station did an on-site coverage. The group found tiger tracks and blood spoor in the snow at the attack scene and followed them for approximately 2,500 meters, hoping {{to catch a glimpse}} of the animal. Soon, the tiger was seen ambling slowly ahead of them. As the team tried to get closer for a better camera view, the tiger <b>suddenly</b> <b>turned</b> and charged, causing the four to flee in panic. About an hour after that encounter, the tiger attacked and killed a 26-year-old woman on the same road. Authorities retrieved the body with the help of a bulldozer. By then, the tiger was found lying 20 meters away, weak and barely alive. It was successfully tranquilized and taken for examination, which revealed that the tiger was anemic and gravely injured by a poacher’s snare around its neck, with the steel wire cutting deeply down to the vertebrae, severing both trachea and esophagus. Despite extensive surgery by a team of veterinarians, the tiger died of wound infection. Subsequent investigation of the first attack revealed that the first victim was a poacher who set multiple snares that caught both the tiger and a deer. The man was later charged for poaching and harming endangered species. He served two years in prison. After being released from prison, he worked in clearing the forest of old snares.|$|E
