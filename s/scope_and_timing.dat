50|$|The East German regime, however, fought back. With still {{unhindered}} {{flight to}} the west a possibility, infiltration started {{on a grand scale}} and a reversal of sorts took hold. During the early 1960s as many as 90% of the BND's lower-level informants in East Germany worked as double agents for the East German security service, later known as Stasi. Several informants in East Berlin reported in June and July 1961 of street closures, clearing of fields, accumulation of building materials and police and army deployments in specific parts of the eastern sector, as well as other measures that BND determined could lead to a division of the city. However, the agency was reluctant to report communist initiatives and had no knowledge of the <b>scope</b> <b>and</b> <b>timing</b> because of conflicting inputs. The erection of the Berlin Wall on 13 August 1961 thus came as a surprise, and the BND's performance in the political field was thereafter often wrong and remained spotty and unimpressive.|$|E

In Israel, Sharett continued to sharply criticize Ben-Gurion for ordering the raid, once remarking that [...] "Satan himself could not have chosen a worse timing."

Commenting on the decision-making process, he remarked that [...] "Ben-Gurion the defense minister consulted with Ben-Gurion the foreign minister and received the green light from Ben-Gurion the prime minister".

After emerging from fourteen years of civil conflict, Liberia has begun implementing a wide range of governance reform programs, among  which decentralization has become a key issue. Although there is consensus among actors – politicians, government officials and civil society activists - on the need to decentralize governance and service delivery there remain disagreement on the <b>scope,</b> nature <b>and</b> <b>timing</b> of decentralization reforms. Overtime, several steps have been taken towards devolution of power, including the promulgation of relevant policies and the deconcentration of services to the counties.

Overall, when governments or institutions implement policy to invoke educational change (and this intervention is not guided by an appropriate evaluation approach), then program evaluation is achievable post-implementation.

This integrated study relied heavily on new advances to handle complex fluid behavior, derive a history match, resolve future behavior of sub-sea wells, and seamlessly review economic metrics. Simulations used tightly-coupled surface and subsurface calculations to capture and stabilize the interaction of surface facilities with the reservoir. This robust and rigorous approach improves upon previously reported techniques in which subsurface flow calculations are only loosely coupled to the surface network. Fluid characterization involved a single equation of state with multiple distributed component sets in reservoirs and compositional mixing within the surface network. Super-critical initialization was used to capture an unusually small gas-oil transition. History match parameters included reservoir, facilities, and well properties. A host of development options involving artificial lift (AL), additional wells, and water injection were evaluated for economic value through an optimization-under-uncertainty approach.

We experimentally analyze 95 purchasing professionals ’ decisions to recommend using a B 2 B exchange. The experiment is a 2 x 2 between-participants design varying the <b>scope</b> <b>and</b> <b>timing</b> of an assurance report with an additional control condition of no assurance. The results suggest that purchasing professionals {{are more likely to}} recommend use of the exchange when general assurance over the reliability of the exchange’s systems is present than when specific assurance over the reliability of transaction information is present. Purchasing professionals {{are also more likely to}} recommend using the exchange when the assurance report is continuous than when it is static, issued at a point in time. However, the results also suggest that participants are less likely to recommend using the exchange when specific information assurance or static assurance is present than when assurance is not present at all. Further, other factors besides assurance, especially trust in the trading partner and propensity to trust, have a stronger influence on the decision to use a B 2 B exchange than the presence of either continuous or systems assurance. Potential implications for practice include redesigning existing assurance services to provide continuous assurance, de-emphasizin...|$|E
