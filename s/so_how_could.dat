500|$|Tommy Smith, booked {{during the}} game for his tackle on Clarke, had been called to the hearing to give evidence. He {{condemned}} the whole affair as a farce. Smith confirmed that the initial foul on Keegan was committed by Johnny Giles, not Bremner, but Bremner was the first Leeds player Keegan saw {{when he turned to}} retaliate. Smith says that as soon as he came into the hearing, an unnamed FA official immediately accused him of starting all the trouble with his [...] "very first tackle of the game". Smith retorted that the man was not even at the game and <b>so</b> <b>how</b> <b>could</b> he know that? The FA official replied by saying: [...] "This is a democratic hearing of the evidence, you're not allowed to ask questions". Smith says he laughed out loud at the absurdity of that statement. At this point Matt Busby, who was on the FA committee, intervened and said: [...] "I saw what happened. That'll be all, Tommy, thanks for coming". Smith says he left the room [...] "wondering how it was possible that a person such as that committee member could have {{a key role in the}} running of football in this country".|$|E
2500|$|When Larry announces his {{leave of}} absence to board the International Space Station (in the episode [...] "Brutus"), Charlie is shocked and upset. He is in denial about Larry's ambitions and he thinks reason of the risks {{involved}} will assert itself firmly in Larry's mind. He reasons that apparently Larry wouldn't do such a thing. Larry remands his few prized possessions to him, and he is grateful for the gesture. When he tells him his concerns, Larry is angered. Amita says to Larry, [...] " [...] has never dreamt of something he couldn't reach, so {{he has no idea}} {{what it is like to}} want something he is not able to get. <b>So</b> <b>how</b> <b>could</b> he understand how much [...] you would give up when this chance comes along?" [...] Larry understands and decides to ignore Charlie's protestations. Though neither apologize, they are on good terms. Charlie says to Amita that he does not know what he would do without him, as he peruses through Larry's precious items that were bestowed upon him. In [...] "Killer Chat", he says that he was glad that Larry's dream could come true, but feels conflicted about being relieved when he discovers that Larry might have been scrapped from the mission when NASA learned of his eccentric indulgences such as sleeping in the campus steam tunnels. However, Charlie agrees with Megan in wanting to help Larry and personally vouches for him. Eppes' words and affiliation with the NSA gets him back on the mission, thus, repaying a debt as Larry helped launch him into the academic firmament. Earlier, he had given him back his lucky T-shirt.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I know'd I {{was never}} wanted before!' cried Mrs. Gummidge, with a pitiable whimper, 'and now I'm told <b>so!</b> <b>How</b> <b>could</b> I {{expect to be}} wanted, being so lone and lorn, and so contrary!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Oh, Tom! <b>How</b> <b>could</b> I fear to die {{after he}} was taken away from me <b>so</b> cruelly! <b>How</b> <b>could</b> I! <b>How</b> <b>could</b> I be such a coward!” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{never thought}} of {{anything}} but what you {{could do to help}} me; and I was <b>so</b> troublesome. <b>How</b> <b>could</b> you tell me things?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I'm <b>so</b> unhappy. <b>How</b> <b>could</b> you {{be cruel}} to me? You know I hate that stupid game. I only play because I {{want to play}} with you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ay! Even <b>so.</b> <b>How</b> <b>could</b> we guard such {{an extent}} of wall with barely five and twenty men? Old Silverlocks and Jaques de l'Eure are slain Martin badly wounded, and we all forced back into the inner court, after doing all {{it was in a}} man to do." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How dare you?" [...] she gasped. [...] "I’ve {{never said}} such {{things in my}} life. Never. And I said that she left because Mr. Wilson, her master, was dead and the family had gone to London. I’ve never been near the house; <b>so</b> <b>how</b> <b>could</b> I say such things?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hellsfire!" [...] cried Blinky, as if stung. [...] "What you think? ... There wasn't a {{one of us}} thet had {{a single}} lead left fer our guns. Thet's where the rub comes in. We played their game. Wasted a lot of shells on them damn broomies! <b>So</b> <b>how</b> <b>could</b> we fight?" ...|$|E
6000|$|For Elma {{felt sure}} she was mad that night. And, if <b>so,</b> oh, <b>how</b> <b>could</b> she poison Cyril Waring's life with so unspeakable an {{inheritance}} {{for himself and his}} children? ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ah!' Wilmet {{spoke as}} if under a weight, 'that {{was the day}} Clement went down to Dearport, and came home <b>so</b> late! <b>How</b> <b>could</b> Sister Constance consent not to tell me?' ...|$|R
60|$|He {{looked up}} at that. <b>How</b> <b>could</b> she love him, and speak <b>so</b> coolly! <b>How</b> <b>could</b> she not mind, {{if she did not}} love him! She was passing her hands over her face and neck and hair, {{repairing}} the damage of his kisses.|$|R
6000|$|... "How could I {{speak to}} you <b>so!</b> <b>How</b> <b>could</b> I! Oh, that some blight may come upon this unhappy tongue! I, who have had nothing but good from you! I to insult you, who are the author of all my happiness! Oh, sire, forgive me, forgive me! for pity's sake forgive me!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Really," [...] I replied, [...] "that is {{more than}} I expected; {{it is a little}} {{astonishing}} to be lifted in a moment from the position of one with a mere competence into that of a rich man. But our poor friend was--well, weak-minded, <b>so</b> <b>how</b> <b>could</b> she be competent to make a binding will?" ...|$|E
6000|$|The ball {{should have}} been postponed--Her Grace of Richmond was willing {{that it should be}} <b>so.</b> <b>How</b> <b>could</b> men and women dance, flirt and make merry while Death was already {{reckoning}} the heavy toll of brave young lives which she would demand on the morrow? But who knows England who has not seen her at the hour of danger? ...|$|E
60|$|I {{knew that}} it was not <b>so,</b> but <b>how</b> <b>could</b> I bring myself to tell her? I might as well have done so, for with the quick {{instinct}} of woman my silence was speech to her.|$|R
6000|$|... "How {{could you}} leave me <b>so,</b> Jinny? <b>How</b> <b>could</b> you {{have the heart to}} do it? I thought you were dead. I mourned for your death--ay, and you have made me mourn for you living. You have {{withered}} my life." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{mean what}} else could you expect, after making such a muck of it?" [...] said his brother, sulkily. [...] "We all thought you were <b>so</b> clever. <b>How</b> <b>could</b> we know {{you were going to}} be--well, really, such a rotten failure?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... “The {{thing is}} too absurd,” Will said angrily. “I {{never spoke to}} a coast-guardsman in my life till to-day, except, perhaps, in passing, and then I would {{do no more than}} make a remark about the weather. Besides, no one in the village has spoken to me for a month, <b>so</b> <b>how</b> <b>could</b> I tell that the lugger was coming in that night?” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is marvelous, indeed," [...] Amuba said. [...] "What {{wealth and}} power a monarch must have had to raise such a colossal pile! I thought you said, Chebron, that your kings were bound by laws {{as well as other}} people. If <b>so,</b> <b>how</b> <b>could</b> this king have exacted such terrible toil and labor from his {{subjects}} as this must have cost?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So I laughed {{to myself}} as I passed the hooch {{around and the}} guests made merry. For in the flour I had traded to Neewak I had mixed much soda that I had got from the woman Ipsukuk. <b>So</b> <b>how</b> <b>could</b> his brew ferment when the soda kept it sweet? Or his hooch be hooch when it would not sour? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It must be <b>so,</b> or <b>how</b> <b>could</b> he be <b>so</b> {{familiar}} {{with a history}} that is little known beyond my own family," [...] at length the youth observed, not ashamed to acknowledge how much he had been affected, by unequivocally drying his own eyes.|$|R
5000|$|... a {{visit to}} St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York City when he was twelve years old, [...] "feeling like I was in heaven... and {{wondering}} why, if Catholics got everything else wrong, as I had been taught, they got beauty <b>so</b> right. <b>How</b> <b>could</b> falsehood and evil be so beautiful?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Moreover, {{here was}} one of the gates to that {{knowledge}} which he desired <b>so</b> earnestly, and <b>how</b> <b>could</b> he find the strength to shut it in his own face? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Some day she may,--if {{she will}} be obedient. But it cannot be now. She has set me at defiance; and even yet it is too clear from the tone of her letter {{to me that she}} thinks that she has been right to do <b>so.</b> <b>How</b> <b>could</b> we live {{together}} in amity when she addresses me as a cruel tyrant?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Then he {{shouldered}} his spade {{and started}} home, the boy following. Caleb's comment was: [...] "I didn't say nothing to un because I {{were only a}} leetel boy and he were a old man; but I knowed better than that all the time, because them people in the Bible they was never in England at all, <b>so</b> <b>how</b> <b>could</b> they sacrifice on White Bustard Down in Wiltsheer?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Friends, {{there are}} two sides to every question," [...] {{interposed}} the forceful Mrs. Wrapp. [...] "If Lane cared to be popular he would have used more tact. But I don't think his remark was an insult. It was pretty raw, I admit. But the dress was indecent and the dance was rotten. Helen told me Fanchon was half shot. <b>So</b> <b>how</b> <b>could</b> she be insulted?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Halidome {{cleared his}} throat; {{the idea was}} <b>so</b> {{obviously}} indecent. <b>How</b> <b>could</b> anybody loathe him? With great composure, however, regarding Shelton {{as if he were}} a forward but amusing child, he answered: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Most {{certainly}} I say <b>so,</b> your honour. <b>How</b> <b>could</b> I? It was {{entrusted to}} me with the other things by my master. To open {{it would have been}} a breach of trust." ...|$|R
5000|$|Speaking in May 2001 in {{response}} to allegations that NITEL had executed inflated contracts, a NITEL spokesman said Arzika [...] "is the only minister ... that has not bothered to influence any decision in the company, <b>so</b> <b>how</b> then <b>could</b> anyone allege {{that he was in}} the know how?"In June 2001 Arzika resigned from the cabinet. He was replaced by Mohammed Bello.|$|R
6000|$|Yet even <b>so,</b> <b>how</b> <b>could</b> he find her? He might, say, {{in a poem}} {{convey to}} her his desire for a meeting. Would she comply? And if she did, what would be his position, supposing the {{inspection}} to result unfavourably for her? Could he, in effect, say to her: [...] "Thank you for letting me {{have a look at}} you; that is all I wanted. Good-bye"? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But you MUST {{have known}} it!" [...] he exclaimed. [...] "I am like my father--witless {{in matters of}} the heart, and of a poor way with women; yet the jewels that strew these royal garden paths--the trees, the flowers, the sward--all must have read the love that has filled my heart since first my eyes were made new by imaging your perfect face and form; <b>so</b> <b>how</b> <b>could</b> you alone have been blind to it?" ...|$|E
60|$|Peter was so {{surprised}} that he couldn't find his tongue. He hadn't {{said a word to}} any one about Spotty, <b>so</b> <b>how</b> <b>could</b> Grandfather Frog know what he had come for? For a long time he had {{had a great deal of}} respect for Grandfather Frog, who, as you know, is very old and very wise, but now Peter felt almost afraid of him. You see, it seemed to Peter as if Grandfather Frog had read his very thoughts.|$|E
6000|$|... "Certainly I {{would do}} her no harm--I--" [...] Melbury's eye met hers. It was curious, but the allusion to Grace's former {{love for her}} seemed to touch her more than all Melbury's other arguments. [...] "Oh, Melbury," [...] she burst out, [...] "you have made me <b>so</b> unhappy! <b>How</b> <b>could</b> you come to me like this! It is too dreadful! Now go away--go, go!" ...|$|R
60|$|George {{took his}} {{seat at the}} bottom of the table, as though he were quite at home; and Harcourt, happy sinner! found himself seated between Adela and Caroline. He was not good enough for such bliss. But had his virtues been ever <b>so</b> shining, <b>how</b> <b>could</b> they have availed him? Neither of his {{neighbours}} had a portion of a heart left to call her own.|$|R
6000|$|Then Nora spoke. [...] "But {{what could}} we do, Mr. Stanbury? It seemed so natural that he should call {{when he was in}} the neighbourhood. We have known him <b>so</b> long; and <b>how</b> <b>could</b> we refuse to see him?" ...|$|R
