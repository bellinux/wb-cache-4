5000|$|An oft-repeated urban legend is that Elliot choked {{to death}} on a ham <b>sandwich.</b> The story <b>spread</b> soon after the {{discovery}} of her body and was based on speculation in the initial media coverage. A 2014 article in the publication Haaretz identified the person who started the false rumor as follows: [...] "Unfortunately, the first doctor London who examined her speculated to the press about the cause of death, and that’s the version that stuck." [...] An autopsy had not been performed when the doctor commented, and London police told reporters that a partially eaten sandwich found in her room might have been relevant {{to the cause of}} death. The post-mortem examination found that Elliot had died of heart failure, and no food was present in her windpipe, yet the false story has persisted ever since.|$|R
40|$|More than 150 events, {{recently}} {{recorded by}} seven seismic broadband stations (OGS- IAA, IRIS, GSETT 3 -IDC), {{have been collected}} and processed to obtain {{an overview of the}} crust and upper mantle shear wave velocities. Group velocities of the fundamental mode Rayleigh and Love waves, in the period range from 15 s to 50 s, are used to obtain tomographic maps of the Scotia Sea region, the tip of Antarctic Peninsula, and the tip of South America. Errors in the measurements, estimated on clusters, are larger for Love waves than for Rayleigh waves and their averages are 0. 060 – 0. 080 km/s and 0. 030 – 0. 040 km/s, respectively. From the regionalisation of the dispersion measurements, we obtain smoothed local dispersion curves in correspondence with the main geological and tectonic features, and from their nonlinear inversion, the shear wave velocity versus depth profiles. The correlation length of the heterogeneity, which can be resolved by Rayleigh waves, varies between 200 and 400 km {{in most parts of the}} studied area, but becomes greater near the periphery of the maps. The spatial resolution of Love waves (400 – 600 km) is poorer than that of Rayleigh waves, due to the deteriorated path coverage and to the larger errors in the group velocity measurements. Models of the shear wave velocity in the crust and upper mantle for the tip of South America, the Falkland Plateau, the Scotia Sea, the South <b>Sandwich</b> oceanic <b>spreading</b> ridge, the South Sandwich trench, the South Scotia ridge, the tip of Antarctic Peninsula, the Bransfield Strait and the Drake Passage are presented. Our regional models and the existing large-scale models (e. g., CRUST 5. 1), help to define a 3 -D velocity model of the Scotia Sea region to be further investigated by waveform inversion...|$|R
40|$|A {{total of}} 262 {{specimens}} {{of meat and}} meat dishes were examined {{for the presence of}} Clostridium perfringens. Of this total, 161 were raw, unprocessed beef, veal, lamb, pork, or chicken; 101 were processed meats and meat dishes. C. perfringens was isolated from 113 (43. 1 %) of these specimens. The highest percentage of contamination (82 %) was found in veal cuts, and the lowest (4. 7 %) in sliced <b>sandwich</b> meats and <b>spreads.</b> Only 2 of the 113 isolates were shown to produce heat-resistant spores, which indicates a very low incidence (0. 8 %) of contamination. These findings indicate that outbreaks of C. perfringens food-borne disease in the Cincinnati area are caused principally by the contamination of the food with vegetative cells or spores of the organism after cooking. Studies of the effects of various holding temperatures on the growth of C. perfringens indicated that, in the range of 5 to 15 C, no multiplication would occur, but that viable cells would still be present {{at the end of a}} 5 -day holding period. Extremely rapid growth occurred at temperatures around 45 C, and complete inhibition of growth was accomplished between 49 and 52 C...|$|R

40|$|Microscale thermal analysis, {{bench scale}} cone calorimetric and real scale burning tests were {{conducted}} to evaluated fire safety performance of expanded polystyrene (EPS) foam. Simultaneous thermal {{analysis was used to}} study the thermal degradation of the foam in nitrogen, air, and oxygen environments at four heating rates. An endothermic effect is observed only in nitrogen environment, while two exothermic effects are observed in oxygen and air environments. In the nitrogen environment, the onset temperature of the endothermic effect and the endothermic peak temperature are much higher than that of the exothermic processes observed in air and oxygen environments. The Flynn-Wall-Ozawa method is utilized to analyze the degradation kinetics of the non-isothermal thermogravimetry. The activation energies calculated for an air environment, in a conversion range α = 20 - 70 %, are lower than those for an oxygen environment. The temperature range for this conversion range is 275 - 371 C. The enthalpies of the first exothermic effect exceed that of the oxygen environment by 10 - 45 %. Bench scale cone calorimetric tests were carried out at incident heat flux of 25, 35, and 50 kW m- 2 with two sets of cone equipment. Heat release rate, ignition time, effective heat of combustion, and critical heat flux required for ignition is obtained. In real scale burning tests, the EPS boards were ignited in <b>sandwich</b> structures. Fire <b>spread</b> speeds were derived from temperature measurement inside sandwich structure...|$|R
