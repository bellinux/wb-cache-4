50|$|The ICT 1500 {{series was}} a design bought {{in from the}} RCA Corporation, who called it the RCA 301. RCA also sold the design to Siemens in Germany and Compagnie des Machines Bull in France who called it the Gamma 30. It used a <b>six-bit</b> <b>byte</b> and had core stores of 10,000, 20,000 or 40,000 bytes.|$|E
50|$|The tape {{had seven}} {{parallel}} tracks, six for data {{and one to}} maintain parity. Tapes with character data (BCD) were recorded in even parity. Binary tapes used odd parity. (709 manual p. 20) Aluminum strips were glued several feet from {{the ends of the}} tape to serve as logical beginning and end of tape markers. Write protection was provided by a removable plastic ring {{in the back of the}} tape reel. A Â¾ inch gap between records allowed the mechanism time to stop the tape. At 200 characters per inch, a single 2400-foot tape could store the equivalent of some 50,000 punched cards (about 4,000,000 <b>six-bit</b> <b>bytes).</b>|$|R
5000|$|The PDP-1 uses an 18-bit {{word size}} and has 4096 words as {{standard}} main memory (equivalent to 9,216 eight-bit bytes, though the system actually uses <b>six-bit</b> <b>bytes),</b> upgradable to [...] words. The magnetic core memory's cycle time is 5.35 microseconds (corresponding roughly to a [...] "clock speed" [...] of 187 kilohertz); consequently most arithmetic instructions take 10.7 microseconds (93,458 operations per second) because they use two memory cycles: {{the first to}} fetch the instruction, the second to fetch or store the data word. Signed numbers are represented in ones' complement. The PDP-1 has computing power roughly equivalent to a 1996 pocket organizer and a little less memory.|$|R
50|$|The tape {{had seven}} {{parallel}} tracks, six for data {{and one to}} maintain parity. Tapes with character data (BCD) were recorded in even parity. Binary tapes used odd parity. (709 manual p. 20) Aluminum strips were glued several feet from {{the ends of the}} tape to serve as physical beginning and end of tape markers. Write protection was provided by a removable plastic ring {{in the back of the}} tape reel. A 3/4 inch gap between records allowed the mechanism enough time to stop the tape. Initial tape speed was 75 inches per second (2.95 m/s) and recording density was 200 characters per inch, giving a transfer speed of 120 kbit/s. Later 729 models supported 556 and 800 characters/inch (transfer speed 480 kbit/s). At 200 characters per inch, a single 2400 foot tape could store the equivalent of some 50,000 punched cards (about 4,000,000 <b>six-bit</b> <b>bytes,</b> or 3 MByte).|$|R
