40|$|The {{production}} of plantlets in containers generally requires {{the use of}} fertilizers. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the {{production of}} sweet potato in styrofoam trays using slow-release fertilizer. The experiment was carried out, under a <b>screen-protected</b> nursery, in a factorial scheme 5 x 5, with five doses of slow-release fertilizer NPK 19 - 06 - 10 (0, 50, 100, 150 e 200 g per 25 kg de substrate) and five times of plantlets permanence in tray (14, 28, 42, 56 and 70 days after planting the cuttings). The number and dry matter of roots and leaves were evaluated. The number of roots was not influenced by fertilizer addition. In general, there is not damage to plantlets growth until the highest dose used. Therefore, the fertilizer addition increases the sweet potato plants growth and the dose of 200 g per 25 kg of substrate is responsible for the best results. ...|$|E
