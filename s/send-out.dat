40|$|BACKGROUND: HLA class I peptide tetramers {{represent}} powerful diagnostic {{tools for}} detection and monitoring of antigen-specific CD 8 (+) T cells. The {{impetus for the}} current multicenter study is the critical need to standardize tetramer flow cytometry {{if it is to}} be implemented as a routine diagnostic assay. Hence, the European Working Group on Clinical Cell Analysis set out to develop and evaluate a single-platform tetramer-based method that used cytomegalovirus (CMV) as the antigenic model. METHODS: Absolute numbers of CMV-specific CD 8 (+) T cells were obtained by combining the percentage of tetramer-binding cells with the absolute CD 8 (+) T-cell count. Six <b>send-outs</b> of stabilized blood from healthy individuals or CMV-carrying donors with CMV-specific CD 8 (+) T-cell counts of 3 to 10 cells/microl were distributed to 7 to 16 clinical sites. These sites were requested to enumerate CD 8 (+) T cells and, in the case of CMV-positive donors, CMV-specific subsets on three separate occasions using the standard method. RESULTS: Between-site coefficients of variation of less than 10 % (absolute CD 8 (+) T-cell counts) and approximately 30 % (percentage and absolute numbers of CMV-specific CD 8 (+) T cells) were achieved. Within-site coefficients of variation were approximately 5 % (absolute CD 8 (+) T-cell counts), approximately 9 % (percentage CMV-specific CD 8 (+) T cells), and approximately 17 % (absolute CMV-specific CD 8 (+) T-cell counts). The degree of variation tended to correlate inversely with the proportion of CMV-specific CD 8 (+) T-cell subsets. CONCLUSIONS: The single-platform MHC tetramer-based method for antigen-specific CD 8 (+) T-cell counting has been evaluated by a European group of laboratories and can be considered a reproducible assay for routine enumeration of antigen-specific CD 8 (+) T cells...|$|R

40|$|Natural gas (NG) is a {{hydrocarbon}} mixture consisting primarily of methane and ethane, {{both of which}} are gaseous under atmospheric conditions. After processing, the gas is cooled and converted to liquid at - 162 ° C (LNG) to be transported by insulated tankers. At its destination, the LNG import terminal, the LNG is transferred from the moored ship to shore through pipelines connected to the ship's manifold. On shore the LNG is stored in insulated storage tanks, after which it can be 'regasified' and supplied to the customer. At the present time the construction of conventional onshore LNG import terminals encounters difficulties due to perception of unacceptable risk to public safety, long permitting processes and/or local environmental issues. An offshore terminal may offer a solution to overcome these problems. Already several studies on offshore LNG terminals have been carried out. In this thesis the feasibility of alternative, more cost effective concepts for offshore LNG import terminals will be discussed. The terminal should be based on a throughput of 5 million tonnes per annum and comprise of a fixed offshore LNG storage facility of 200, 000 m 3 with regasification equipment for high-pressure gas <b>send-out</b> and a mooring system that provides maximised terminal operability without constructing breakwaters.

40|$|Fifty-five {{laboratories}} {{participated in}} a <b>send-out</b> study of four peripheral blood samples comparing a standard protocol vs. local protocols for flow cytometric lymphocyte immunophenotyping. The standard protocol included centrally provided reagents, instrument setup using triple-fluorescent microbeads and a three-color, whole-blood immunostaining technique based on fluorescein isothiocyanate and phycoerythrin-labeled monoclonal antibodies, erythrocyte lysis, washing, fixation, and identification of nucleated cells by the DNA/RNA stain LDS- 751. Data analysis guidelines included lymphocyte selection using CD 45,CD 14 -assisted "backgating" on forward (FSC) and sideward (SSC) light scatter and placement of fluorescence (FL) markers {{on the basis of}} the isotype control staining. Most (i. e., 77 %) of the variation in results of percentage lymphocyte subset assessments using the standard protocol was explained by laboratory, sample, background FL, and the interaction between laboratory and sample. Purity and completeness of the FSC,SSC lymphogate, background FL, flow cytometer type, and flow cytometer setup (which were either partly or entirely determined by laboratory) contributed significantly to the variation. The effect of the leukocyte differential count on the variation in absolute numbers of lymphocyte subsets was particularly large in lymphopenic samples. The use of this standard protocol vs. local protocols did not reduce the interlaboratory variation. Instrument incompatibility with the standard protocol (e. g., incompatible filter combinations for LDS- 751 detection) and lack of experience of many participants with three-color flow cytometry (in particular with the use of LDS- 751) may have contributed to that result.

40|$|Assays that assess {{cellular}} mediated immune responses performed under Good Clinical Laboratory Practice (GCLP) {{guidelines are}} required to provide specific and reproducible results. Defined validation procedures {{are required to}} establish the Standard Operating Procedure (SOP), include pass and fail criteria, as well as implement positivity criteria. However, little to no guidance is provided on how to perform longitudinal assessment of the key reagents utilized in the assay. Through the External Quality Assurance Program Oversight Laboratory (EQAPOL), an Interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) Enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot (ELISpot) assay proficiency testing program is administered. A limit of acceptable within site variability was estimated after six rounds of proficiency testing (PT). Previously, a PT <b>send-out</b> specific within site variability limit was calculated based on the dispersion (variance/mean) of the nine replicate wells of data. Now an overall 'dispersion limit' for the ELISpot PT program within site variability has been calculated as a dispersion of 3. 3. The utility of this metric was assessed using a control sample to calculate the within (precision) and between (accuracy) experiment variability {{to determine if the}} dispersion limit could be applied to bridging studies (studies that assess lot-to-lot variations of key reagents) for comparing the accuracy of results with new lots to results with old lots. Finally, simulations were conducted to explore how this dispersion limit could provide guidance in the number of replicate wells needed for within and between experiment variability and the appropriate donor reactivity (number of antigen-specific cells) to be used for the evaluation of new reagents. Our bridging study simulations indicate using a minimum of six replicate wells of a control donor sample with reactivity of at least 150 spot forming cells per well is optimal.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} fair allocation of bandwidth resources on lossy channels in hybrid heterogeneous networks. It discusses more particularly the ability of window-based congestion control to support non-congestion related losses. We investigate methods for efficient packet loss recovery by retransmission, and build on explicit congestion control mechanisms to decouple the packet loss detection from the congestion feedback signals. For different retransmission strategies that respectively rely on conventional cumulative acknowledgments or accurate loss monitoring, we show how the principles underlying the TCP retransmission mechanisms have to be adapted {{in order to take}} advantage of an explicit congestion feedback. A novel retransmission timer is proposed {{in order to deal with}} multiple losses of data segments and, in consequence, to allow for aggressive reset of the connection recovery timer. It ensures significant benefit from temporary inflation of the <b>send-out</b> window, and hence the fair share of bottleneck bandwidth between loss-prone and lossy connections. Extensive simulations analyze the performance of the new loss monitoring and recovery strategies, when used with two distinct explicit congestion control mechanisms. The first one relies on a coarse binary congestion notification from the routers. The second one, introduced in [D. Katabi, M. Handley, C. Rohrs, Internet congestion control for high bandwidth-delay product environments, ACM SIGCOMM (2002) 89 - 102], exploits accurate and finely-tuned router feed-backs to compute a precise congestion window adjustment. For both congestion control mechanisms, we observe that retransmissions triggered based on a precise monitoring of losses lead to efficient utilization of lossy links, and provide a fair share of the bottleneck bandwidth between heterogeneous connections, even for high loss ratios and bursty loss processes. Explicit window-based congestion control, combined with appropriate error control strategies, can therefore provide a valid solution to reliable and controlled connections over lossy network infrastructures.

40|$|Flow cytometry (FCM) {{uses the}} {{principles}} of hydro- dynamic focusing, light scattering, light excitation, and emission of fluorochrome molecules to generate specific multi-parameter data from particles and cells. FCM became rapidly a routine method for clinical decision-making in clinical diagnostic laboratories, e. g. for lymphocyte subset enumeration, CD 34 + cell enumeration and HLA-B 27 screening. Therefore, various efforts to standardize testing and reduce variability between laboratories have been undertaken. Also, clinical cell analysis by flow cytometry has entered the same process of development of instrumental validation, internal and external quality control (QC), and External Quality Assessment (EQA) as any other laboratory medicine activities. In this thesis, we analyze {{the impact of these}} standardization efforts on clinical cell analysis by FCM with special attention to external quality assurance programs which currently are operational in the Benel! ux countries. Firstly, we retrospectively analyzed the results of 7 EQA send-outs to assess the quality of flow cytometric HLA-B 27 screening. The HLA- B 27 pos samples were correctly classified as positive by the large majority of participants, the classification of HLA-B 27 neg samples as negative was less straightforward. Ten samples were correctly classified as such by 97 % of the participants, whereas only 64 % of the participants correctly classified the remaining eight samples as HLA-B 27 neg. Inspection of the reactivity patterns of the individual mAb with HLA-B 27 neg samples revealed that ABC-m 3 showed very little cross-reactivity apart from its well-known cross-reactivity with HLA- B 7, whereas the cross-reactivity patterns of GS 145. 2 and FD 705 were more extensive. However, the small sample size (n= 18) and the distribution of HLA-B antigens other than HLA-B 27 did not allow assignment of specificities to these cross-reactions. Therefore, we further analyzed the cross-reactivity patterns of commercially available anti-HLA-B 27 mAb (i. e., ABC-m 3, FD 705, and GS 145. 2) with an extensive cell panel with other HLA-B antigens. Test cells were selected as to express HLA-B antigens with known serologic cross-reactions (HLA-B 7, B 12, B 13, B 16, B 17, B 22, B 37, B 40, B 41, B 42, B 47, and B 48). Cells without B 27 cross-reactive antigens (B 5, B 8, B 14, B 15, B 21, and B 35) and cells positive for B 27 were included as controls. All mAbs tested showed cross-reactivity, ranging from weak (Â±) to strong (+), with different antigens and different degrees of intensity. If one mAb had been used for HLA-B 27 screening, many false- positive B 27 assignments would have yielded. This problem largely can be avoided by the combined use of two different mAb. The combination of FD 705 and GS 145. 2 yielded the best results. Tise finding resulted in a proposal for a standard operating procedure for flow cytometric HLA-B 27 screening, which is p! ublished and nowadays adopted by Current Protocols in Cytometry. In addition, we evaluated the suitability of long-term stabilized whole blood specimens as positive or negative procedure controls for flow cytometric HLA-B 27 screening, and as test samples in an external quality assessment (EQA) scheme. Peripheral blood samples were obtained from 9 blood bank donors with known HLA-B typing. Commercially available HLA-B 27 mAb were tested periodically between 1 week and 12 months and the forward scatter (FSC), sideward scatter (SSC), and fluorescence signals of lymphocytes were compared as a function of time. Furthermore, a pilot <b>send-out</b> with stabilized blood samples of 4 blood bank donors was distributed among the participants to the Benelux EQA scheme for HLA-B 27 screening and results were compared with historical EQA data obtained using non-stabilized blood samples from the same donors. Matrix effects were observed, however there were no major effects on FSC and SSC characteristics of lymphocytes. Fluorescence of stabilized samples increa! sed as compared to fresh samples, but the discrimination between HLA-B 27 positive and HLA-B 27 negative samples remained feasible post stabilization in most cases. In the pilot EQA <b>send-out</b> the results obtained with stabilized samples were less concordant due to variable quality of these samples. In our opinion, long-term stabilized whole blood samples may be useful as true HLA-B 27 positive and true HLA-B 27 negative control cells for daily and longitudinal quality control of flow cytometric HLA-B 27 screening, and may be used for EQA purposes. However, long-term stabilized samples are not suitable for reagent validation purposes. Extensive quality control of stabilized samples is necessary before distribution to the laboratories. Secondly, to assess the effect of multiple variables on CD 34 + cell enumeration, we analyzed the results of 9 EQA send-outs in the Benelux countries. Therefore, robust multivariate regression, divergent to the statistics performed in most other studies, was used. We studied the effect of methodological aspects of CD 34 + cell counting on assay outcome and whether or not this exercise was effective in reducing between-laboratory variation. Five variables were associated with significant bias of absolute CD 34 + cell counts: (i) laboratory, (ii) gating strategy; (iii) CD 34 mAb fluorochrome; (iv) type of flow cytometer, and (v) method of sample preparation. In addition, laboratory and platform methodology (i. e., single vs. dual) contributed significantly to the variability of this assay. Our approach, i. e., EQA with targeted training and feedback in response to reported results, has been successful in reducing the variability of CD 34 + cell enumeration between participants. Thirdly, to assess the effect of multiple variables on CD 3 + T-cell, CD 4 + T-cell, CD 8 + T-cell, NK-cell, and CD 19 + B-cell enumeration, we analyzed the results of 10 EQA send-outs in the Benelux countries. Again, robust multivariate regression was used. We studied the effects of the methods used on assay outcome, and whether or not this EQA exercise was effective in reducing between-laboratory variation. Five variables were associated with significant bias of absolute lymphocyte subset counts: (i) platform methodology, (ii) sample preparation technique, (iii) gating strategies, (iv) sample stabilization, and v) laboratory. Platform methodology, sample stabilization, and laboratory also affected assay variability. With time, assay variability tended to decline; this trend was significant for B-cell counts only. Participants tended to standardize their techniques mainly with respect to sample preparation and gating strategies, but less with absolute counting techniques. Failure t! o fully standardize protocols may have led to only modest reductions in variability of results between laboratories...|$|E
40|$|Due to the {{increasing}} demand for LNG, more environmental friendly regasification solutions are of interest. Aker Solutions has developed a concept for zero emission regasification of LNG, where the regasification train is heat integrated with an oxy-fuel power and steam plant. The oxy-fuel combustor burns part of the <b>send-out</b> gas in an oxygen enriched environment. The flue gas produced is CO 2 rich, making CO 2 capture feasible. 95 mol% pure oxygen is produced by cryogenic distillation in an ASU. Today, oxy-fuel combustion is not economical feasible, mainly due to the significant power demand in the ASU and the CO 2 Compression and Purification Unit (CPU). This thesis investigates opportunities of reducing the power consumption in the plant. Pinch analysis is {{used to evaluate the}} heat integration in the Aker Solutions concept. Simulation models are created in Aspen Hysys to investigate possibilities of integrating the ASU with the power and steam plant, and to find the impact of changing the oxygen purity. In addition the use of membranes to separate air is discussed. The heat integration was evaluated in terms of sequence of the pair matches, and placement of Heat Transfer Fluids (HTFs). The sequence of the streams was found acceptable. However, changing the HTF in LNG heater 2 and 3 from MEG/Water to Methanol could be beneficial. The freezing point of Methanol is lower than that of MEG/Water; hence the HTF can be shifted to a lower temperature. Because LNG has a higher h-value than the hot streams, &# 8710;T between the LNG and the HTF should be lower than that of the hot fluid and the HTF. If the oxygen purity was set to 90 mol%, the load of the CO 2 CPU and the condenser duty of the N 2 /CO 2 distillation were increased by 10 % and 65 % respectively. If the purity was increased to 97 mol% the opposite results were obtained. Although increasing the purity leads to savings in the CO 2 CPU, this unit only accounts for {{a small part of the}} overall power consumption compared to the ASU, hence the impact on the ASU is of greater concern. For the ASU, decreasing the purity would lead to some energy savings. However, the required equipment size of the unit would increase. If the purity is increased, the separation of Argon is required in the distillation column, thus a significant increase in energy of separation is experienced. In addition the capital expenses of the ASU are increased, due to implementation of a supplementary distillation column. Based on the previous facts, it was recommended to keep the oxygen purity at 95 mol%. If integrating the ASU, cryogenic LNG should be used to cool the air upstream and downstream the air compressor. Results from Hysys showed that this would lead to 18 % reduction in external utility consumptions. In addition the compressor work of the ASU would be decrease by 14 %, and the yield of the LP turbine would increase with 2 MW. Today, membranes are not capable of producing large quantities of oxygen. However, there exist some membranes with great potential. The most promising membranes are found to be MIECs with a perovskite structure, especially Ba 0. 5 Sr 0. 5 Co 0. 8 Fe 0. 2 O 3 -&# 948;. At 800 ºC the oxygen flux of these membranes are found to be approximately 1. 56 &# 8729; 10 - 6 mol/scm 2, and the oxygen purity obtained is above 99 mol%. The thickness of one of these membrane were found to be 1. 8 mm, hence more than 1 &# 8729; 109 membranes are required to produce enough oxygen for the oxy-combustion plant. Although these membranes have a great potential, they need to be further evolved before implemented to oxy-fuel power plants...|$|E
