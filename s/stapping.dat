Labex started off as a guitar player, but switched to the electric bass {{at the age of}} 15. He soon became one of the prominent bass players in Lebanon at the age of 20. Labex has been involved in the continuing development of various musical techniques and styles -funk, Latin, and fusion world music - and has stood out in his sense of lyricism and melodic bass lines. He introduced a new technique to the world of bass - The Stap. Through the stap technique, Labex combines drumming on the drums, tapping on the guitar, and slapping on the bass, together to create this amazing skill to perform on the bass guitar. After tampering and innovation to the technique, Labex featured <b>stapping</b> {{for the first time on}} his album [...] "Dear Mother".|$|E

40|$|International audienceSpace Time Adaptive Processing (<b>STAP)</b> is a {{two-dimensional}} adaptive filtering technique which uses jointly {{temporal and spatial}} dimensions to suppress disturbance and to improve target detection. Disturbance contains both the clutter arriving from signal backscattering of {{the ground and the}} thermal noise resulting from the sensors noise. In practical cases, the <b>STAP</b> clutter can be considered to have a low rank structure. Using this assumption, a low rank vector <b>STAP</b> filter is derived based on the projector onto the clutter subspace. With new <b>STAP</b> applications like MIMO <b>STAP</b> or polarimetric <b>STAP,</b> the generalization of the classic filters to multidimensional configurations arises. A possible solution consists in keeping the multidimensional structure and in extending the classic filters with multilinear algebra. Using the low-rank structure of the clutter, we propose in this paper a new low-rank tensor <b>STAP</b> filter based on a generalization of the Higher Order Singular Value Decomposition (HOSVD) in order to use {{at the same time the}} simple (for example time, spatial, polarimetric, [...] .) and the combined information (for example spatio-temporal).

40|$|A novel {{approach}} for target direction of arrival (DOA) estimation based on deterministic space time adaptive processing (<b>STAP)</b> is presented. Deterministic <b>STAP</b> [1] represents a valid alternative to stochastic <b>STAP</b> in fast varying interference scenarios, {{due to its}} intrinsic single snapshot interference cancellation characteristics. On the other hand, in its classical derivation, detection performances of deterministic <b>STAP</b> are severely deteriorated in case of uncertainty in {{the knowledge of the}} exact target DOA. Reformulating the deterministic <b>STAP</b> problem in terms of convex optimization, a robust deterministic <b>STAP</b> technique has been derived in [2] which takes into account a possible mismatch between the nominal and the actual target DOA. In this paper, the robust deterministic <b>STAP</b> filter is applied to retrieve an accurate estimation of the actual target DOA based on a closed form formula. Such target DOA estimates may serve in tracking scenarios to keep updated the target parameters knowledge in successive coherent processing intervals (CPIs) ...|$|R
30|$|However, the MIMO <b>STAP</b> {{can be more}} {{challenging}} owing to the extra DOFs produced by orthogonal transmitted waveforms. Inevitably, the rank of clutter and jammer subspace will increase and the <b>STAP</b> of MIMO radar will be more complex. When full adaptive processing is implemented, large computational complexity caused by the matrix inversion operation and the challenging number of training samples will prevent the practical implementation of <b>STAP.</b> This can be even more serious when the numbers of array elements and pulses in a coherent processing interval (CPI) are both large. Fortunately, reduced-dimension (RD) and reduced-rank (RR) <b>STAP</b> algorithms are able to relieve the heavy computational burden for MIMO radar while maintaining good performance. The key objective of RD/RR <b>STAP</b> is to reduce computational cost and thus improve statistical convergence. RD <b>STAP</b> cut back the adaptive DOFs physically by transformation that is data independent [6]; while RR <b>STAP</b> projects the received data into a lower dimensional subspace spanned {{by a set of}} basis vectors utilizing a data-dependent transformation.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, a novel {{approach}} for direct data domain space time adaptive processing (<b>STAP)</b> is presented. As already described in past literature, direct data domain <b>STAP</b> (also known as deterministic <b>STAP)</b> has several advantages compared to traditional stochastic <b>STAP.</b> In particular, being implicitly a single snapshot interference cancellation technique, deterministic <b>STAP</b> generally outperforms stochastic <b>STAP</b> in fast varying interference scenarios.

The proposed robust deterministic approach is defined for both the one dimensional (spatial-only) and the two dimensional (space-time) case.

Applications for <b>STAP</b> includes ground {{moving target indicator}} (GMTI) for airborne radar systems. Today, there are strong interests to develop <b>STAP</b> algorithms for operations in “sample starved” environments, where intense environmental interference can reduce <b>STAP</b> capacity to detect and track ground targets.
