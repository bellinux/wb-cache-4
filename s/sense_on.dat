It sold poorly {{at first and}} was underpromoted by Jive, amid the label's dissolution. However, as its singles attained radio airplay and Miguel toured in its promotion, the album became a sleeper hit and helped him garner an audience and commercial standing. He also garnered a following with his fervent concert performances. After Jive was shut down and absorbed by RCA Records, Miguel acquired a new marketing team to develop himself {{as more than a}} typical urban artist, having felt pigeonholed into being marketed as one by Jive.

25|$|Early {{forms of}} analogical reasoning, {{inductive}} reasoning and categorical syllogism {{were introduced in}} Fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence), Sharia (Islamic law) and Kalam (Islamic theology) from the 7th century {{with the process of}} Qiyas, before the Arabic translations of Aristotle's works. Later during the Islamic Golden Age, there was a logical debate among Islamic philosophers, logicians and theologians over whether the term Qiyas refers to analogical reasoning, inductive reasoning or categorical syllogism. Some Islamic scholars argued that Qiyas refers to inductive reasoning, which Ibn Hazm (994-1064) disagreed with, arguing that Qiyas does not refer to inductive reasoning, but refers to categorical syllogism in a real sense and analogical reasoning in a metaphorical <b>sense.</b> <b>On</b> the other hand, al-Ghazali (1058–1111) (and in modern times, Abu Muhammad Asem al-Maqdisi) argued that Qiyas refers to analogical reasoning in a real sense and categorical syllogism in a metaphorical sense.

40|$|Opportunistic affect sensing offers {{unprecedented}} {{potential for}} capturing spontaneous affect ubiquitously, obviating biases {{inherent in the}} laboratory setting. Facial expression and voice are two major affective displays, however most affect <b>sensing</b> systems <b>on</b> smartphone avoid them due to extensive power requirement. Encouragingly, due to the recent advent of low-power DSP (Digital Signal Processing) co-processor and GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) technology, audio and video sensing are becoming more feasible. To properly evaluate opportunistically captured facial expression and voice, contextual information about the dynamic audio-visual stimuli needs to be inferred.

He later rated it the ninth best episode of the series, though the finale {{was not included in the}} list. Gavin Fuller of The Daily Telegraph described it as a [...] "taut, claustrophobic, sci-fi thriller", and as an [...] "impressive episode with its neatly realised psychological and body horror". Both Martin and Fuller were less generous of Jennifer's monster transformation. Martin commented [...] "this dark, thoughtful story is restored to camp running-for-your-life-around-some-corridors", and Fuller called it [...] "something of a pity".|$|E
500|$|Although the {{underlying}} equations governing plasmas are relatively simple, plasma behavior is extraordinarily varied and subtle: {{the emergence of}} unexpected behavior from a simple model is a typical feature of a complex system. Such systems lie in some <b>sense</b> <b>on</b> the boundary between ordered and disordered behavior and cannot typically be described either by simple, smooth, mathematical functions, or by pure randomness. The spontaneous formation of interesting spatial features {{on a wide range}} of length scales is one manifestation of plasma complexity. The features are interesting, for example, because they are very sharp, spatially intermittent (the distance between features is much larger than the features themselves), or have a fractal form. Many of these features were first studied in the laboratory, and have subsequently been recognized throughout the universe. Examples of complexity and complex structures in plasmas include: ...|$|E

The cancellation triggered a currently ongoing boycott led by Jewish education website Mesora.org whose reach numbers more than 72,000 email subscribers. The show was unsympathetic to supporters of the al-Aqsa Intifadah—whom Keyes frequently debated on the program—and supported the Israeli crackdown on Palestinians. The show also featured critical discussion of homosexuality and of priests accused in the Catholic Church sex abuse scandals. The last episode was broadcast on June 27, 2002. As a result of Keyes's strong advocacy of Israel on his MSNBC show, in July 2002 the state of Israel awarded him a special honor [...] "in appreciation of his journalistic endeavors and his integrity in reporting" [...] and flew him in to meet Prime Minister Ariel Sharon.|$|E

500|$|After {{recording}} Astral Weeks, Morrison {{moved with}} his wife to a home on a mountain top in the Catskills near Woodstock, a hamlet in upstate New York with an artistic community. Because of the album's poor sales figures, the singer wanted to produce a third record {{that would be more}} accessible and appealing to listeners: [...] "I make albums primarily to sell them and if I get too far out a lot of people can't relate to it. I had to forget about the artistic thing because it didn't make <b>sense</b> <b>on</b> a practical level. One has to live." [...] He began writing songs for Moondance in July 1969. The musicians who went on to record the album with Morrison were recruited from Woodstock and would continue working with him for several years, including guitarist John Platania, saxophonist Jack Schroer, and keyboardist Jef Labes.
