The {{standard gross margin}} shall be calculated on one activity unit: surface (1 ha) or per head: SGM = GP - DPE The standard gross product at poultry is calculated per kg of meat and per 1000 eggs and includes the total output value plus the supplied subsidy. Direct proportional expenditures (DPE) are expenditures that vary directly with the changes in the size of agricultural production (biological material expenditures, feeding stuffs, energy, medicine, insurance and other material expenditures). Are called variable expenditures. Fixed production expenditures such as machinery, buildings (their amortization), permanent labor expenditures, rents or variable costs such as fuel and lubricants, equipment and machinery maintenance and works contracted with third parties are not included in costs for calculation of standard gross margin SGM. The standard gross margin for poultry was calculated for an average daily gain of 45 g at broiler chickens and for an average annual output of 260 eggs / head, to laying hens.

40|$|Direct {{payments}} are a controversial {{issue in the}} accession negotiations. While the EU proposes reduced payments the accession countries claim {{that they should be}} equally treated as the present EU members. The present study, based on micro-simulations on the farm level, shows impacts of various policy options (ranging from non-accession to the granting of full direct payments) on the production structure and profitability of Hungarian agricultural enterprises. For most products prices are expected to be higher in 2004 than in the reference year, 2001. EU accession will have an additional positive effect on the prices of all products. Direct payments would further increase farm profits. In particular crop producers would benefit (due to the increase in the price of corn) while profits in animal production would be affected in a negative way due to increased opportunity costs of forage area and higher labour cost. The presented figures are based on data collected in 14 typical model farms selected from the Hungarian Farm Accountancy Data Network and they cannot be regarded perfectly representative. However, in accordance with other sector studies the figures allow two conclusions. First, the majority of Hungarian agriculture (with respect to the share in total farm area as well as the share in total <b>standard</b> <b>gross</b> <b>margins)</b> would suffer no economic harm from an EU accession without direct payments. Second, direct payments would increase farm profits in Hungary considerably. EU-enlargement, direct payments, farm model, typical farms, Hungarian agriculture, Agricultural and Food Policy,...|$|E
40|$|This {{publication}} {{presents a}} description of the Community typology for agricultural holdings and the way how that is applied in Finland. The objective of the Community typology is to achieve a uniform classification of holdings in the European Union. The classification is based on the type of farming and the economic size, which are determined on the basis of standard gross margin. The Community typology for agricultural holding and the statistics where it is applied, the Community Farm Accountancy Data Network and the Community farm structure survey are based to the EU legislation. Joining to the EU in 1995 has meant that the stipulations concerning the typology and its applications entered into force also in Finland. The first half of this publication presents a thorough description of the Community typology as well as its main applications. This part also includes the description of the method of classifying the holdings in parallel statistics in Finland. In the empirical part of the publication the Finnish farms are classified according the Community typology rules. The physical characteristics of the holdings are based on the Rural Business Register. The <b>standard</b> <b>gross</b> <b>margins</b> for each characteristic are calculated for four geografical regions in a way agreed with Eurostat and DG VI. The outcome is the breakdown of Finnish farms by type farming and by economic size based on the Community typology. The first concrete applications of the new typology system in Finland are the determination of the sample needed for the Community Farm Accountancy Data Network and the Community Farm Structure Survey. In {{the last part of the}} publication the first sample for FADN in Finland is determined. The Community typology has many benefits in the future in Finland. It will be one important base for international comparations between holdings. It also facilitates for example the development of the calculation the results of Finnish bookkeeping farms.

Taking the ecological endowments of Hungary into consideration the farms of the South Great Plains may play a decisive role in this. During our research we examined eight model hydro-cultured vegetable forcing farms that are competitive due to their income-generating capacity and are suitable for further development. We concluded that pepper forcing farms of 1 ha generated â‚¬ 138, 980 SGM, tomato forcing farms â‚¬ 129, 486 SGM and cucumber forcing farms â‚¬ 121, 641 SGM. By dividing the <b>Standard</b> <b>Gross</b> <b>Margin</b> by â‚¬ 1, 200 we found that the farms examined belonged to the 111. 65 ESU size category in the case of peppers, 107. 91 ESU in the case of tomatoes and 101. 37 ESU in the case of cucumbers, so they can be regarded as rather large farms according to the standards accepted within the EU. Within the category of variable costs, an increase in the <b>Standard</b> <b>Gross</b> <b>Margin</b> (SGM) of viable farms of the right size (in the economic sense of the word) is possible by decreasing heating costs. In the model farms examined the heating costs of greenhouses heated by thermal water was 60 % less than those using forcing equipment fuelled by coal. The increasing costs of thermal water (environmental protection fines, mine charges, fees for using water deposits) significantly undermines this global competitive advantage. production value, variable costs, ESU, vegetable forcing, income, Agribusiness, Farm Management, Production Economics,...|$|R

40|$|The aim of our {{research}} is to determine - {{on the grounds of}} the facts of an average dairy family farm – the necessary economic size to provide subsistence for a four member family, which solely has income from this activity. Our study used three different calculation models. The models featured considerable differences. In the first one the primary aim of the producer is to survive, therefore the achieved gross income in farming includes neither amortization costs, nor the arising costs of repair and maintenance. On the contrary, the primary aim of the second model is to keep up the technology and the stock, which could fulfil the requirements of simple reproduction. The third model assumes a technological development corresponding with 10 % of the invested asset value besides consolidation, thus ensuring the potential of reproduction on an increasing scale. The above mentioned calculations cover the period of several years. The studied years show differences in terms of the buying up price of milk, aid for milk production and the price of used inputs. Our study compared farm sizes with the viable plant size defined according to the <b>Standard</b> <b>Gross</b> <b>Margin.</b> As for the SGM a farm is already viable with 10 dairy cows and their progenies. However, our calculations show that a 10 cowed farm is not able to provide sufficient income for a four member family, if their aim is not only survival, but also simple or enlarged reproduction. The calculations reveal that among the fast changing market conditions of the dairy sector minimal farm size cannot be determined solely on the basis of profit figures in a given year, as in many cases it might lead to the exhaustion of reserves. dairy industry, family farm businesses, economic size, sustainability, <b>Standard</b> <b>Gross</b> <b>Margin.,</b> Agricultural and Food Policy, Food Consumption/Nutrition/Food Safety,...|$|R
40|$|The project's {{objectives}} were to provide technical assistance for the redesign of the Farm Accounting Network (FAN) thus {{making it a}} management tool for small to medium- size private farmers; to train regional and other extension workers {{in order to increase}} the efficiency of data collection and improve analysis, policy formulation and planning; to make the FAN compatible with Western European accounting standards; and finally to provide assistance for the implementation of a socio-economic survey of small private farms and landless rural families in 186 villages (13 000 farms), which had been carried out every three to four years since 1959 Following a series of discussions with various users of the FAN, together with reviews of the data produced by the network, broad parameters of a new system were clarified with the IAFE team and outlined as follows: the European Community's accounting model, the Farm Accounts Data Network (FADN) would be used closely tied into existing methodology; the system would involve simpler records with fewer field visits by inspectors; the data processing would be modernized; financial results would be expressed on a "whole farm" basis; the cost of production studies for individual commodities would be a separate, occasional exercise, and not {{an integral part of the}} FAN; farms would be classified by type and size on the basis of <b>standard</b> <b>gross</b> <b>margins</b> (to be derived from previous FAN data); the sample size would be significantly increased and farms selected at random, using the national census lists; and aggregated results would be published for each of the nine national macro- regions. As a result of the project a completely new farm accounting system for IAFE has been produced which has been manually tested and is compatible with FADN. The development of this new system involved the FAO team working closely with a group of specialists from the IAFE. The experience gained has had a major impact on training. The IAFE team has now improved its understanding of accounting model operations. In order to extend a working knowledge of the new system to a wider group, and eventually to field inspectors and extension workers, the project concluded with a five-day training course in Warsaw aimed at future trainers. Seven progress reports were prepared during the course of the project, one of which was a manual for the training course (in English and Polish). A socio- economic survey was conducted in 1992 by a small team of specialists from the IAFE and a preliminary report was issued (in Polish) in early 1993. In order to ensure that the new system operates with maximum effect, it is now recommended that the IAFE staff concerned maintain close liaison with the system's computer programmer for the project during the testing phase in 1994. While the manual system of data collection is now operational, and detailed programming instructions have been prepared, the full implementation of the computerized system requires more time. Therefore, continuity of senior staffing are essential. External technical assistance could be necessary if problems arise during the testing phase, which cannot be resolved in the IAFE. When the system is fully operational, it should be fully documented into a detailed manual for regular use by the Farm Accounts Department team. Linkages with other networks and services, such as the Extension Centres and farm schools should be carefully pursued. The cost of data collection to the IAFE could be reduced through sub-contracting to other organizations...|$|E

The scope of work covered agricultural events in 100 ecological farms located in Małopolskie, Podkarpackie, Śląskie and Świętokrzyskie voivodeship. The researched farms were divided into 4 uniform groups. Pro-duction orientation, defined on the basis of commonly used methodology of <b>standard</b> <b>gross</b> <b>margin</b> estimation was a division criterion. The following were detailed: single-production field plants farms, single-production fruit farms, single-production animal farms and double-production farms. A method of a guided survey was used for collecting research material. Field plants production farms and fruit production farms obtained the highest marketability amounting to 67. 5 %. Fruit production farms had the highest number of tractors per 100 ha of AL − 48. 84 items. Requirements of labour inputs in this type of farms, where harvest, care and fertilization of plantation are sources, may be the reason of such high equipment.

The most important indicator characterizing farm efficiency and size is milk yield because it is has {{a direct impact on}} <b>gross</b> <b>margin</b> or profit. Milk production cost should be also taken into account, as it is has a negative impact on the financial results. The application of the point method placed twofarms on the top position: F 5 and F 3, each one getting 45 points for the criteria taken into account. However, the farm F 5 came on the 1 st position for milk yield, marketed milk yield, gross product from milk, total gross product per cow and year and gross margin/cow/year and on the 7 th position for variable costs, while the farms F 3 came on the 3 rd position for milk yield and variable cost, on the 2 nd position for gross product from milk, total gross product per cow and year, and <b>standard</b> <b>gross</b> <b>margin,</b> and on the 1 st position for heifer cost and own mechanical works as well. As a conclusion, dairy farmers should keep under control all the production cost items looking for measures to reduce costs {{as much as they can}} without affecting yield performance.

The main objective {{of this study is}} to test a method to evaluate land degradation based on the integration of aggregate metrics of biophysical and socio-economic "degradation". We applied a framework that integrates the biophysical and socio-economic dimensions of land degradation to test the hypothesis that macro-economic policies, and in particular agricultural subsidies, are an important driving force of land degradation in marginal regions of the Mediterranean Europe. We analysed the influence of subsidies on the profitability of each crop and livestock type found in a sample of farms in a region of northern Greece. Spatial and socioeconomic data on agricultural households were collected to link remote sensing data and land degradation maps to socio-economic conditions of these households, as measured by the <b>standard</b> <b>gross</b> <b>margin.</b> The results demonstrate that subsidies provide a crucial socio-economic support to maintain the profitability of agricultural activities but may also promote land-use practices with damaging ecological impacts. Different levels of biophysical and socio-economic "degradation" were associated with different land use practices. The integration of the socio-economic and biophysical dimensions of land degradation reveals associations that would not be detectable if indicators along one dimension alone would be used.

The catch crops biomass (roots + above ground parts) and FYM were incorporated in the third decade of October. Sweet corn seeds (6 kg·ha- 1) were sown in mid-May, in the years 2005 - 2007, at the between – and in-ter-row spacing of 65 × 20 cm. Sweet corn ears were hand-harvested at the stage of milk maturity of kernels, at the turn of August and Septem-ber. During the harvest marketable yield of ears (t·ha- 1) and number of marketable ears per 1 ha were determined. Economic evaluation of sweet corn cultivation under diversified organic fertilization was conducted ac-cording to the <b>standard</b> <b>gross</b> <b>margin</b> method. The calculation was based on the 2014 prices. The highest yield and number of ears were obtained after catch crops with faba bean and phacelia sown on the 21 st July and after FYM. Delaying the sowing date of catch crops resulted in a decrease in the successive yielding effect. The highest <b>gross</b> <b>margin</b> (25267. 66 PLN·ha- 1 and 0. 56 PLN per 1 ear) and profitability index (332 %) were achieved in the sweet corn cultivation after catch crop with faba bean sown on the 21 st July.

40|$|The Farm Improvement Programme (FIP) (Reg. 797 / 85) was {{introduced}} in Ireland in 1986 to replace the Farm Modernisation Scheme (FMS) (Dir. 159 / 92) of 1974 - 1985. Both schemes had similar objectives. Participants in each followed a grant aided farm development plan drawn up and operated in conjunction with their farm adviser. Nearly three quarters of farmers participated in either the FIP or FMS. This study was carried out on a sample of 145 FIP participant farms. The objective {{was to assess the}} impact of the measure on regional resource use. The average size of the farm business, as measured by <b>standard</b> <b>gross</b> <b>margin,</b> expanded by 15 per cent over the period of the plan. This compared with a planned increase of 9 per cent. Two-thirds of participants expanded the size of their businesses. Some outperformed their <b>gross</b> <b>margin</b> targets to a considerable extent. One-third of farms suffered a decline in <b>gross</b> <b>margins.</b> Stocking rate increased by 9 per cent from 1. 38 to 1. 5 livestock units per ha and the productivity of labour increased by 37 per cent. The internal rate of return to all resources involved (including farm investment, grant aid, administration and advisory costs) was high. Eighty to ninety per cent of the on farm development work was carried out by local labour. While sixty two per cent of applicants reported that they would not have made any investments without the aid of the scheme, 26 per cent said that they would have gone ahead in its absence. The conclusions from the study are as follows: Compared to the rest of Europe Irish agriculture is extensive and under capitalised with a high level of underutilisation of resources. It should therefore be a priority to increase the contribution of agricultural resources to rural and national development by improving their productivity. Because of the high and widespread participation of farmers in both schemes and the positive outcomes on the majority of participant farms, the FIP/FMS programmes seem to provide a suitable model for such development. ...|$|R

Besides the mass products and in many cases instead of them when forming the agricultural structure, this region has {{to pay more attention to}} the branches that were important in the past.

The rules referring to these products are more liberal in the market places of the European Union and their development is not controlled by strict quota systems. In the south part of the Great Hungarian Plain a lot of unique products of excellent quality are produced. Here in this essay we would like to find the answer to the question how the two significant products of the southern part of the Great Hungarian Plain can provide the families with the income that they can live on. We aim at the economical examination of the cucumber grown in Méhkerék and asparagus of Homok. To do this we will apply the so called <b>Standard</b> <b>Gross</b> <b>Margin.</b> The agriculture of the states of the European Union is measured with the help of this method.

40|$|Land {{degradation}} is {{most likely}} to affect the well being of people living in marginal regions. Agriculture {{is one of the major}} causes of land degradation. Land use decisions by farmers are influenced by the local environment and by external factors related to markets and policies. This thesis aims to develop, implement and evaluate a farm-level methodological approach of land degradation that integrates environmental and socio-economic factors potentially affecting land degradation, on the basis of three case studies in the southern EU. We developed methods combining remote sensing (RS) and GIS data with farm-level socio-economic surveys. We produced a “socio-ecological graph” based on aggregated biophysical and socio-economic metrics of land degradation for a sample of farms in Northern Greece. We explored the association between the financial condition of farms and land degradation. We analysed the fraction of direct subsidies in the <b>standard</b> <b>gross</b> <b>margin</b> of crops and livestock of our sample. It suggested that subsidies provided financial support to land uses associated with land degradation. In another study site, combining RS and farm survey data for a sample of sheep and goat farms in central Crete, we found that stocking rates were not associated with subsidies or land tenure. Rangeland degradation was not linked to stocking rates but with locations characterised by a specific geological substratum. Intensive livestock feeding suggested that farms were disconnected from rangeland vegetation, and were more exposed to market shocks. In a third study site, a typology of land uses in Chieti allowed us to identify possible degradation processes. Cereals were associated with erodible soils; olive farms were more prone to land abandonment; vine was unlikely to be a major source of erosion given the local topography. This study improved our understanding of the dynamics of farming H-E systems leading to land degradation. (GEOG 3) [...] UCL, 201...|$|R
