On 16July Halsey and Vice Admiral Bernard Rawlings, the commander of TF37, met to plan raids on the Tokyo area. Halsey was determined to sink {{the remnants of the}} IJN, and placed a particularly strong emphasis on attacking Nagato as she had been Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto's flagship during the attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941. Due to the battleship's position within a well defended harbor, the Third Fleet's planners assessed that aircraft which attempted the <b>straight</b> <b>and</b> <b>level</b> <b>flight</b> needed to launch torpedoes against her would suffer heavy losses, and so decided to use dive bombing tactics instead. As the landward side of the naval base was mountainous, the approaches which could be used by dive bombers were limited.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} results of a Pilot-Induced Oscillation (PIO) and human pilot control {{characterization}} study performed using flight data collected with a Remotely Controlled (R/C) unmanned research aircraft. The study was carried out on the longitudinal axis of the aircraft. Several existing Category 1 and Category 2 PIO criteria developed for manned aircraft are first surveyed and their effectiveness for predicting the PIO susceptibility for the R/C unmanned aircraft is evaluated using several flight experiments. It was found that the Bandwidth/Pitch rate overshoot and open loop onset point (OLOP) criteria prediction results matched flight test observations. However, other criteria failed to provide accurate prediction results. To further characterize the human pilot control behavior during these experiments, a quasi-linear pilot model is used. The parameters of the pilot model estimated using data obtained from flight tests are then used to obtain information about the stability of the Pilot Vehicle System (PVS) for Category 1 PIOs occurred during <b>straight</b> <b>and</b> <b>level</b> <b>flights.</b> The batch estimation technique used to estimate the parameters of the quasi-linear pilot model failed to completely capture the compatibility nature of the human pilot. The estimation results however provided valuable insights into the frequency characteristics of the human pilot commands. Additionally, stability analysis of the Category 2 PIOs for elevator actuator rate limiting is carried out using simulations and the results are compared with actual flight results...|$|R
500|$|The F-16 was {{the first}} {{production}} fighter aircraft intentionally designed to be slightly aerodynamically unstable, also known as [...] "relaxed static stability" [...] (RSS), to improve maneuverability. Most aircraft are designed with positive static stability, which induces aircraft to return to <b>straight</b> <b>and</b> <b>level</b> <b>flight</b> attitude if the pilot releases the controls; this reduces maneuverability as the inherent stability has to be overcome. Aircraft with negative stability are designed to deviate from controlled flight and thus be more maneuverable. At supersonic speeds the F-16 gains stability (eventually positive) due to aerodynamic changes.|$|E
500|$|The {{investigation}} found {{that as the}} B-52 entered its final turn sequence around the tower, its indicated airspeed (IAS) was [...] Although Holland increased the engine power after starting the turn, his input came too late to maintain the aircraft's airspeed, as the B-52 turbofan engines take up to eight seconds to respond to throttle commands. Even though the airspeed indicator was available to all four aircrew members, the aircraft's airspeed was allowed to continue to decrease. Eight seconds before impact, the aircraft's IAS had deteriorated to [...] and the aircraft's bank angle increased past 60°. At this time Holland or McGeehan applied full right spoiler, right rudder, and nose-up elevator, and the aircraft entered a turning flight stall (also called accelerated stall). This phenomenon is a stall that occurs at a higher airspeed than the design stall speed – which always refers to <b>straight</b> <b>and</b> <b>level</b> <b>flight</b> – because the aircraft is turning. Due to the bank of 60° or more, the stall speed for the aircraft at that moment was [...] Thus, flying 2 knots slower, the aircraft stalled, without having sufficient altitude to recover before striking the ground.|$|E

[...] This is physically impossible, because structural limitations [...] of the aircraft or physical endurance of the occupants will be exceeded well before then.|$|E

40|$|A novel {{approach}} for conceptual aircraft design using constrained bifurcation and continuation method {{is presented in}} this paper. To demonstrate the approach, vertical tail sizing problem of a generic six seater, light, business transport airplane is addressed here. For sizing the vertical tail, stability analysis of the aircraft lateral-directional modes in <b>straight</b> <b>and</b> <b>level,</b> symmetric <b>flight</b> trims is carried out using constrained bifurcation analysis and continuation methodology. A full six degrees-of-freedom nonlinear mathematical model is used for modeling the rigid body flight dynamics of the aircraft; aerodynamic stability and control derivatives required for stability analysis are estimated using standard empirical relations available in aircraft design textbooks. Effects of center-of gravity change and altitude variation are also incorporated to cover a typical flight envelope for analysis. Stability parameters of lateral-directional modes, as characterized by the corresponding eigenvalues obtained from bifurcation analysis, are examined and compared with flying qualities specifications to arrive at an optimal vertical tail size that meets the handling qualities requirements...|$|R

40|$|Ornithopters are robotic flight {{vehicles}} that employ flapping wings to generate lift and thrust {{forces in a}} manner that mimics avian flyers. At the small scales and Reynolds numbers currently under investigation for miniature aircraft, where viscous effects deteriorate the performance of conventional aircraft, ornithopters achieve efficient flight by exploiting unsteady aerodynamic flow fields, making them well-suited for a variety of unmanned vehicle applications. Parsimonous dynamic models of these systems are requisite to augment stability and design autopilots for autonomous operation; however, flapping flight is fundamentally different than other means of engineered flight and requires a new standard model for describing the flight dynamics. This dissertation presents an investigation into the flight mechanics of an ornithopter and develops a dynamical model suitable for autopilot design for this class of system. A 1. 22 m wing span ornithopter test vehicle was used to experimentally investigate flapping wing flight. Flight data, recorded in trimmed <b>straight</b> <b>and</b> <b>level</b> mean <b>flight</b> using a custom avionics package, reported pitch rates and heave accelerations up to 5. 62 rad/s and 46. 1 m/s^ 2 in amplitude. Computer modeling of the vehicle geometry revealed a 0. 03 m shift in the center of mass, up to a 53. 6 % change in the moments of inertia, and the generation of significant inertial forces. These findings justified a nonlinear multibody model of the vehicle dynamics, which was derived using the Boltzmann-Hamel equations. Models for the actuator dynamics, tail aerodynamics, and wing aerodynamics, difficult to obtain from first principles, were determined using system identification techniques with experimental data. A full nonlinear flight dynamics model was developed and coded in both MATLAB and FORTRAN programming languages. An optimization technique is introduced to find trim solutions, which are defined as limit cycle oscillations in the state space. Numerical linearization about <b>straight</b> <b>and</b> <b>level</b> mean <b>flight</b> resulted in both a canonical time-invariant model and a time-periodic model. The time-invariant model exhibited an unstable spiral mode, stable roll mode, stable dutch roll mode, a stable short period mode, and an unstable short period mode.

The aim of the activity was to compare the aerodynamic characteristics of the new pod to a previous one already cleared on the same aircraft fleet, given verified inertial and structural similarity.

A two steps approach was required by the Certification Authority to verify, initially, the performance data compatibility in terms of aerodynamic coefficients of the old pod with the new one, {{in order to allow}} performance flight manual data interchangeability (a quantitative comparison was required); afterwards, a qualitative assessment was conducted to verify the absence of unsteadiness induced by the introduction in the external structure of the new pod of an auxiliary antenna case.

2500|$|The flight {{recorders}} and suspected debris were located, {{but were not}} initially recovered due to a dispute between Adam Air and the Indonesian Government over who should pay recovery costs. Both recorders were retrieved after Adam Air agreed to pay for 7 days worth of searching. A 2009 episode of Mayday (Air Crash Investigation, Air Emergency) about Flight 574 stated that the official crash report had concluded the Inertial Reference System (IRS) had failed. This failure, which should not by itself have brought the plane down, caused the pilots to become preoccupied with trying to fix it. After changing the IRS from [...] "Navigate" [...] mode to [...] "Attitude" [...] mode, the pilots failed to manually fly the plane while the computer system recalibrated, a procedure that takes about 30 seconds. The failure to maintain <b>straight</b> <b>and</b> <b>level</b> <b>flight</b> during the recalibration caused the autopilot to completely disengage and cease compensating for the plane's tendency to roll to the right, which caused {{the nose of the}} plane to dip. In attempting to correct the pitch of the aircraft before levelling the wings, the pilot sent the aircraft into an unrecoverable downward spiral, leading to the plane suffering massive structural failure as it descended at near the speed of sound. [...] The investigation disclosed that the accident aircraft, including the faulty IRS and several other systems, had been the subject of more than 40 pilot complaints, or [...] "write ups" [...] in the months prior to the crash.|$|E

50|$|Stringfellow {{worked in}} Chard, Somerset, England as {{a maker of}} bobbins and {{carriages}} for the lace industry. Together with Henson, he had ambitions of creating an international company, the Aerial Transit Company, with designs showing aeroplane travel in exotic locations like Egypt and China. Despite their efforts, the designs were flawed with Stringfellow's ideas centred on monoplane and triplane models and Henson's ideas centred on an underpowered steam-powered vehicle. In 1848 Stringfellow achieved the first powered flight using an unmanned 10 ft wingspan steam-powered monoplane built in a disused lace factory in Chard, Somerset. Employing two contra-rotating propellers on the first attempt, made indoors, the machine flew ten feet before becoming destabilised, damaging the craft. The second attempt was more successful, the machine leaving a guide wire to fly freely, achieving some thirty yards of <b>straight</b> <b>and</b> <b>level</b> powered <b>flight.</b> Stringfellow was also a keen photographer in his spare time, having run his father's photography business in Chard, of which Stringfellow {{was one of the}} first to produce a wet print of an image in his studios.

40|$|The {{aviation}} industry depends {{heavily on the}} trained professionals that control the aircraft from the cockpit. Airlines invest substantial resources to training and evaluating these pilots. Today, most of those assessments of pilot performance are based on subjective evaluations by another experienced pilot called a check airman. In order to better train and evaluate pilots’ performance, quantitative methods of evaluation are required. Through {{the use of a}} flight data recorder (FDR), the various parameters of a flight segment were analyzed, including ground track and altitude. By developing a set of metrics to quantitatively evaluate the performance of a flight, a scale can be established to determine the quality of flight. By combining and modifying the metrics, any phase of flight or set of maneuvers may be evaluated in the future. For this research project, a FDR was placed in the cargo area of various Cessna 172 aircraft and flown to known locations. The pilots were students of The Ohio State University enrolled in flight education. The data from the FDR was used to analyze the altitude and ground track of the aircraft during the flight. Based on this data, measures were devised to evaluate student performance on future flights. This system will be extremely useful in evaluating solo cross-country flights, where the student is the sole occupant of the aircraft. Students are required by federal regulation to successfully complete several hours of solo flight before obtaining various pilot certificates, and the FDR is a tool that can be implemented to evaluate the performance of the students while they are flying solo. The purpose of this project was to demonstrate the use of a FDR as a tool of instruction, establish measures for ground track and altitude performance, and to enable an evaluator to predict the chance of a pilot exceeding Practical Test Standards (PTS) minima in <b>straight</b> <b>and</b> <b>level,</b> un-accelerated <b>flight.</b> The project accomplished these goals, and laid the ground work for future research to turn the FDR into a tool for flight instruction, accident investigation, collision avoidance, and pilot performance evaluation.
