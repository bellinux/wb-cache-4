5|$|The A1 {{is one of}} London's main roads, {{providing}} {{a link to the}} M1 and the A1(M) motorways, and on to the Midlands, Northern England and Scotland. Despite this, its main use is to connect a number of neighbourhoods within north London; less than 5% of its vehicles are through traffic – the bulk is local. The roads along which the A1 route travels are the <b>shared</b> <b>responsibility</b> of the local boroughs, the Greater London Authority, and the British Government via the Department for Transport.|$|E

25|$|Rákosi's second reign, however, did {{not last}} long. His power was {{undermined}} by a speech made by Nikita Khrushchev in February 1956, in which he denounced the policies of Joseph Stalin and his followers in eastern Europe, especially the attacks on Yugoslavia and the propagation of cults of personality. On 18 July 1956, visiting Soviet leaders removed Rákosi from all his positions, and he boarded a plane bound for the Soviet Union, never to return to Hungary. But the Soviets made a major mistake by the appointment of his close friend and ally, Ernő Gerő, as his successor, who was equally unpopular and <b>shared</b> <b>responsibility</b> for most of Rákosi's crimes.|$|E
25|$|Secular Franciscans {{are called}} {{to make their own}} contribution, {{inspired}} by the person and message of Francis, towards a civilization in which the dignity of the human person, <b>shared</b> <b>responsibility,</b> and love may be living realities. They should firmly commit themselves to oppose every form of exploitation, discrimination, and exclusion and against every attitude of indifference in relation to others. They promote the building of fraternity among peoples: they should be committed to create worthy conditions of life for all and to work for the freedom of all people. Secular Franciscans attempt to be in the forefront in the field of public life. They should collaborate as much as possible for the passage of just laws and ordinances.|$|E
25|$|Provision {{of water}} and {{sanitation}} services in Portugal is a <b>shared</b> <b>responsibility</b> between the 308 municipalities and the national, public holding company Águas de Portugal (AdP) and its subsidiaries. About 73% {{of the population in}} 243 municipalities receives water directly from municipalities (3.5 million people) or single-municipality companies established under public law (2.5 million people). 27% of the population receives water directly from companies established under private law, including 1.7 million from multi-municipal companies majority-owned by Águas de Portugal and 0.9 million from other municipal companies established under private law. Many municipalities do not control their sources of bulk water supply. Companies established under private law, in particular multi-municipal companies co-owned by Águas de Portugal, thus sell water to municipalities, providing water indirectly in bulk to 53% of the population. In addition, as mentioned above, companies established under private law provide water directly to 27% of the population. Thus, a total of about 80% of the population receives water directly or indirectly multi-municipal companies established under private law.|$|E

25|$|The Comissió de Govern (Government Commission) is the {{executive}} branch, formed by 24 councillors, led by the Mayor, with 5 lieutenant-mayors and 17 city councillors, each in charge of an area of government, and 5 non-elected councillors. The plenary, formed by the 41 city councillors, has advisory, planning, regulatory, and fiscal executive functions. The six Commissions del Consell Municipal (City council commissions) have executive and controlling functions {{in the field of}} their jurisdiction. They are composed by a number of councillors proportional to the number of councillors each political party has in the plenary. The city council has jurisdiction in the fields of city planning, transportation, municipal taxes, public highways security through the Guàrdia Urbana (the municipal police), city maintenance, gardens, parks and environment, facilities (like schools, nurseries, sports centres, libraries, and so on), culture, sports, youth and social welfare. Some of these competencies are not exclusive, but shared with the Generalitat de Catalunya or the central Spanish government. In some fields with <b>shared</b> <b>responsibility</b> (such as public health, education or social services), there is a shared Agency or Consortium between the city and the Generalitat to plan and manage services.|$|E
25|$|In 1989, Christopher P. Earley {{hypothesized}} that social loafing would be mitigated in collectivist cultures that {{focused more on}} achievement of the group than the individual. He conducted {{a study in the}} United States and China, two polar opposites in terms of culture (with the U.S. being individualistic and China being collectivist), in order to determine if a difference in social loafing was present between the two types of cultures. Earley formed groups from both countries similar in demographics and in time spent with each other (participants in each of the groups had known each other for three to five weeks). Each group was tasked with completing various forms of paperwork similar to work they would be required to do in their profession. The paperwork was designed to take two to five minutes for each item, and the items were turned in to an assistant when completed so that no one could judge their work compared to others. Each participant was given 60 minutes to complete as many items as possible and was separated into either the high-accountability group, where they were told they needed to achieve a group goal, or a low-accountability group, where they were told they were to achieve a goal alone. They were also separated into high and low <b>shared</b> <b>responsibility</b> groups.|$|E
