2500|$|Hungarian [...] "negativists" [...] were {{organized}} in opposition parties represented by right-wing Provincial Christian-Socialist Party (OKSZP) and Hungarian National Party (MNP) (not {{to be confused}} with Hungarian National Party above). The OKSZP was supported mainly by the Roman Catholic population, and the MNP by Protestants. The parties differed also by their views on collaboration with the government coalition, the MNP considered collaboration in some periods while the OKSZP was in steadfast opposition and tried to cross ethnic boundaries to gain support from the Slovak population. This attempt was partially successful and the OKSZP had 78 <b>Slovak</b> <b>sections</b> and a Slovak-language journal. Attempts to create a coalition of Hungarian opposition parties with the largest Slovak opposition party – Hlinka's Slovak People's Party (HSĽS) – were unsuccessful due to fear of Hungarian revisionist policy and potential discredit after the affair of Vojtech Tuka who was uncovered as a Hungarian spy.|$|R

40|$|The paper {{brings a}} review of a {{long-term}} malacological survey of fragmented urban alluvial woodland, an important refuge of Middle-Danubian terrestrial molluscan fauna. In the area of Bratislava agglomeration we surveyed two softwood and 26 hardwood alluvial forests. Altogether, 52 mollusc species have been recorded during the last 20 years (representing 79 % of the total terrestrial mollusc fauna living in the <b>Slovak</b> <b>section</b> of the Danube floodplain). The most frequent species (more than 75 % sites) were Aegopinella nitens, Helix pomatia, Monachoides incarnatus (every three species at 27 sites, i. e. 96 %), Cochlodina laminata (26 sites, 93 %), Petasina unidentata (25 sites), Urticicola umbrosus (24 sites), Alinda biplicata (23 sites), and Clausilia pumila (21 sites). The main ecological groups were forest species in general (45 %, mainly eurytopic and slightly hygrophilous), hygrophilous species in general (26 %, hygrophilous and riparian), euryecious species (16 %), semi-steppe (8 %) and open-country species (5 %) ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract 160 taxa of macrozoobenthos were {{recorded}} in the Danube River (R. km 1880 - 1704) riparian zone. Many typical Danubian and Pontocaspian representatives were found. The <b>Slovak</b> <b>section</b> of the Danube represents the border between its epipotamal and metapotamal stretches with different flow velocity and other environmental variables related to it. This paper characterises some abiotic ecological factors influencing the distribution of benthic taxa in five sampling sites along the longitudinal profile of the Danube. The benthic community composition was more strongly influenced by hydrological parameters than by oxygen and temperature regimes, {{as well as by}} the water quality conditions. In other words, the bottom substrate, flow velocity, water level fluctuation and discharge changes had the predominant effect on the taxocoenoses of macrozoobenthos. Three characteristic groups of macrozoobenthic organisms {{were recorded}}, as far as corresponding trophic guilds are concerned. Shredders and scrapers predominated in high flow velocity conditions with coarse substrate particles. Collectors of fine organic matter preferred slow-flowing conditions caused by damming or by a reduction of current due to the presence of bedrock. Filterers prevailed in the lower section of the Danube stretch monitored. Predators occurred independently of the environmental variables studied...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is firstly to discuss the basic {{theoretical}} approaches used to interpret the concept of trust in the context of social capital and then to present the results of research conducted on trust. The analysis concentrates on elements related to trust in the literature, reflecting the methodological approaches for assessing and measuring trust. In theoretically conceptualising trust we generally adopt Hardin’s explanations (1991, 2002 a, 2002 b, 2006), which are then used as an interpretational framework for our research results. The paper mainly analyses and interprets subjective conceptual mental maps of trust developed on the basis of associations obtained in the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia using the Associative Group Analysis Technique. The participants were management and economics students and there were 100 of them in each country (50 female and 50 male; 50 from each capital – Prague, Budapest, Warsaw and Bratislava; 50 from a smaller town in each country – Ostrava, Szeged, Olsztyn and Prešov). Altogether 400 students in four countries completed the tasks. In this article we mainly present the results relating to the <b>Slovak</b> <b>section</b> of the research sample...|$|E
