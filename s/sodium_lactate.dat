From goat and sheep ranch soil, forage, feed, waterand animal samples (Blood plasma, milk, faecesand urine) were collected fortnightly during winter and summer seasons. At goat ranch {{it was found that}} seasons did not affect soil, forageand plasma Na+ concentrations. These samples were lower than the required range in relation to Na+ levels. The fecal, urineand milk Na+ losses were found to be responsible for low plasma Na+ status in different goat classes. At sheep ranch soil, feedand plasma, milk and urine <b>sodium</b> concentrations in <b>lactating</b> sheep were affected by seasonal changes. Forage sodium level during summer was at marginal deficient and during winter it was slightly deficient. In lactating sheep plasma had marginal deficient level of sodium in winter and moderate deficient level in summer.

50|$|Despite the {{similarity}} in name, <b>sodium</b> <b>lactate</b> is not chemically similar to lactose (milk sugar) and therefore {{need not be}} restricted by those with lactose intolerance. In general, lactates such as sodium, calcium, and potassium lactate are salts derived from the neutralization of lactic acid and most commercially used lactic acids are fermented from dairy-free products such as cornstarch, potatoes, or molasses. Sugar or tapioca additionally may be used. In some rare instances some lactic acid is fermented from dairy products such as whey and lactose. Whey is made of up 6.5% solids of which 4.8% is solid lactose. Waste whey is infrequently used to produce lactic acid when the whey itself is produced as waste during the manufacture of certain dairy products. Such dairy-type lactic acid generally goes back into dairy products, such as ice cream and cream cheese, rather than into non-dairy products.
