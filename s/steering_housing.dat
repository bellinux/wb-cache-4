50|$|Housing {{segregation}} is {{the practice}} of denying African American or other minority groups equal access to housing {{through the process of}} misinformation, denial of realty and financing services, and racial <b>steering.</b> <b>Housing</b> policy in the United States has influenced housing segregation trends throughout history. Key legislation include the National Housing Act of 1934, the GI Bill, and the Fair Housing Act. Factors such as socioeconomic status, spatial assimilation, and immigration contribute to perpetuating housing segregation. The effects of housing segregation include relocation, unequal living standards, and poverty. However, there have been initiatives to combat housing segregation, such as the Section 8 housing program.|$|E

These tests can be complex and costly, and sometimes difficult to be realized for some specific components.

Even more difficult is the characterization of the material in the case of Al alloy diecastings, where the mechanical properties strongly depend on casting defects. By linking mechanical results with numerical simulation data of filling and solidification, a through-process model is developed to predict the defects’ location and amount, thus the structural behavior of die cast components.

The common form of hand controls consists of a push-pull handle mounted below and projecting {{to the side of the}} <b>steering</b> wheel <b>housing.</b> The bar connects by levers to the accelerator and brake pedals, and is typically pivoted so that pushing applies the accelerator while pulling applies the brake. As there is no facility to work a clutch pedal, hand controls must generally be used in cars with automatic transmissions. With one hand continuously engaged working the hand controls, the steering wheel will generally also be fitted with a steering knob to allow one-handed use. More complex fittings may also connect into the electronic circuitry of the vehicle to place indicator and other switches in easy reach of the driver without requiring them to release the hand controls or steering knob. A guard plate may be fitted to prevent inadvertent contact between the driver's feet and the pedals. Extension levers or adapted grips may also be fitted to the parking brake to allow it to be applied by a driver with limited hand or arm strength.|$|R

40|$|Australian {{social housing}} policy {{continues}} {{to move away}} from a traditional hierarchical public housing model. The small but fast growing not-for-profit sector has expanded through the introduction of private finance, a tax credit scheme, stock transfers, planning incentives and an economic stimulus package. This article examines the diverse ways in which the leading not-for-profit providers in Australia have responded to these opportunities, using the concept of organisational hybridity. Coverage of hybridity includes both established housing providers and emergent third sector organisations including finance consolidators, development consortia and cross-subsidisation vehicles. Using information from interviews, organisational case studies and documentation, this paper assesses the drivers for the growth of hybridity in Australia. The policy implications for governments <b>steering</b> a diverse <b>housing</b> sector through promoting hybrid organisations are discussed, and reflections are provided on the opportunities and limitations of using hybridity analytical frameworks. An issue to emerge from the analysis is the diversity of organisational forms, financing models and strategic orientation of hybrid organisations promoted through the same policy settings...|$|R

40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the XXXIII IAHS World Congress on Housing, 27 - 30 September 2005,"Transforming Housing Environments through Design", University of Pretoria. This paper presents a review of an evaluation of a Peoples’ Housing Process in Vosloorus, {{which resulted in the}} construction of 250 homes for low income beneficiaries between January 2003 and September 2003. It is critical to learn from a PHP project such as the Vosloorus PHP, since there have been few examples of successful PHPs in the country. The Vosloorus case demonstrates that a PHP can truly be participatory and still deliver a quality product at a reasonable pace. The Peoples’ Housing Process (PHP) is a form of housing delivery in South Africa that depends heavily on community initiative and beneficiary involvement in the delivery process, and local job creation and skills development is maximised. Planact, a non-profit development organisation, was involved in supporting a PHP process to upgrade an existing informal settlement in Vosloorus, within the Ekurhuleni Metropolitan Municipality, east of Johannesburg. Planact conducted an evaluation of Phase I of the project soon after its completion in September 2003. The houses produced were 36 -square metre brick homes on already-serviced sites. To build the top structures, local labourers, including beneficiaries, formed teams who worked under the supervision of 10 emerging contractors from the community. Another important characteristic of the process was the promotion of women in the construction process — 30 % of the labourers were required to be women, and three of the ten contractors were also women. The evaluation included a survey of 50 randomly-selected beneficiaries of the housing, as well as surveys with labourers, contractors, Steering Committee members and other stakeholders. The paper presents the outcome of the evaluation, focusing on the following issues : community and women’s participation, satisfaction with housing constructed and benefits of the project, potential for other options/choices in housing design, and performance of the <b>Steering</b> Committee and <b>Housing</b> Support Centre.

5000|$|The first {{electrical}} {{gear shift}} mechanism sold on new automobiles was the Vulcan electric gear shift system, a solenoid-driven transmission shift device for a standard sliding gear gearbox {{introduced in the}} summer of 1913. Among the automakers to offer the Vulcan system were the Haynes Automobile Company of Kokomo, Indiana the S.G.V. Company of Reading, Pennsylvania and the Norwalk Motor Car Company of Martinsburg, West Virginia. While the Vulcan shifter was often advertised as standard equipment on the Haynes car, a common floor shift was also available for $200 less. Norwalk made the Vulcan system available on their products, such as the Underslung Six, as an option; approximately 25 of those cars were so equipped. A large nickel-plated box was attached to {{the right side of the}} <b>steering</b> column which <b>housed</b> the push button mechanism. It utilized six buttons - first through third gear, reverse, neutral and park. There was also a [...] "signal" [...] button which was the horn. A housing containing four large solenoids was mounted at the transmission which acted on the steel transmission shift control rods. The driver was free to select any gear at will, enabling the bypassing of gears, such as jumping from first to third gear without going through second gear. There was a cautionary advisory with the car that one must use care when placing the selector into reverse, only doing so when the car was completely stopped. Pushing a button on the shift control preselected the chosen gear. The electrical circuit was closed only after the driver fully depressed the clutch pedal. This energized the appropriate transmission mounted solenoids necessary for returning the transmission to neutral and then completing engagement of the preselected gear; the driver would then release the clutch pedal to continue onwards. These seemed to have been very advanced automotive systems. The Vulcan Electric Shift Company was located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and was eventually bought out by Cutler-Hammer. The model year 1914 was the only year that Norwalk used this system. Only one known Norwalk Motor Car survives today, which is owned by the friends of the Norwalk Foundation, Inc. in Martinsburg. Haynes was evidently the only automaker of note to place the push-buttons in the center of the steering wheel. The Vulcan electric gear shift system probably didn't survive past the early 1920s, since nothing regarding it has been found in the automotive engineering literature past 1921, and a 1919 Haynes print ad has been found with no mention of the electric shifting system.|$|R
