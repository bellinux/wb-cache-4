When working with such functions, arbitrary lines of discontinuity, or branch cuts, must be chosen. For example, the conventional branch cut for the complex logarithm function lies along the negative real axis, so that log(Γ 1) = ßi but when ffl 1 is small, real, and positive, we require log(Γ 1 Γ ffl 1 i) = + ffl 2 for some small, complex ffl 2. Most computer algebra systems provide little assistance in working with expressions involving functions with complex branch cuts. Worse, by their ignorance of the existen [...] ...|$|R

For the <b>square</b> <b>root</b> problem, it has been shown to have the upper bound PMP and lower bound P⊕P.
