Items or creatures which caused death were also destroyed as deodands. Assessing intention was a matter for the court, but Alfred the Great's Doom book did distinguish unintentional injuries from intentional ones, whereas culpability depended on status, age, and gender.|$|R
40|$|Structural shocks and {{investment}} subsidies in an overlapping generations model with perfect foresight* by Victor A. Ginsburgh* * and Henri R. Sneessens*** The paper {{is concerned with}} investment subsidies and their effect on structural adjustments. We construct a two-sector overlapping generations model where consumers live for two periods, both consumers and firms have perfect foresight, and prices and wages are perfectly flexible, so {{that the economy is}} always at full-employment. The structural shock is represented by an unanticipated permanent change in consumers' preferences. This change induces firms to scrap part of their capital stock in one sector and to invest in the other. Because adjustment costs make capital imperfectly mobile across sectors, this structural change implies a loss of welfare for the generations living at the moment of the shock. The question is whether the scrapping {{and investment}} rates generated by the market are optimal, or whether there is room for government intervention. It is shown by means of a numerical example, that investment subsidies alone cannot improve each generation's welfare. This result can be achieved however if the government combines its investment incentives with an appropriate <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>compensatory</b> transfers from future to current generations...|$|R

40|$|Transcriptional {{networks}} {{have been shown}} to evolve very rapidly, prompting questions as to how such changes arise and are tolerated. Recent comparisons of transcriptional networks across species have implicated variations in the cis-acting DNA sequences near genes as the main cause of divergence. What is less clear is how these changes interact with trans-acting changes occurring elsewhere in the genetic circuit. Here, we report the discovery <b>of</b> a <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>compensatory</b> trans and cis mutations in the yeast AP- 1 transcriptional network that allows for conserved transcriptional regulation despite continued genetic change. We pinpoint a single species, the fungal pathogen Candida glabrata, in which a trans mutation has occurred very recently in a single AP- 1 family member, distinguishing it from its Saccharomyces ortholog. Comparison of chromatin immunoprecipitation profiles between Candida and Saccharomyces shows that, despite their different DNA-binding domains, the AP- 1 orthologs regulate a conserved block of genes. This conservation is enabled by concomitant changes in the cis-regulatory motifs upstream of each gene. Thus, both trans and cis mutations have perturbed the yeast AP- 1 regulatory system {{in such a way as}} to compensate for one another. This demonstrates an example of “coevolution” between a DNA-binding transcription factor and its cis-regulatory site, reminiscent of the coevolution of protein binding partners...|$|R

40|$|A {{fast and}} {{powerful}} gaze stabilization reflex supports self-motion es- timation and flight control in flies. Changes in body posture are conveyed {{by a variety}} of sensory modalities and compensated for by fast and accurate head movements. This thesis aims to further our understanding of the behavioural basis <b>of</b> <b>compensatory</b> head move- ments, and presents a first foray into the in vivo imaging <b>of</b> the motor <b>systems</b> that actuate these control reflexes. Major sensors that contribute to gaze stabilisation are the visual ocelli and compound eyes on the head, and the mechanosensory halteres on the thorax. The integration of visual feedback and mechanosensory feedforward control gives rise to a two-degree-of-freedom controller, a design which is extensively used in engineering applications. I per- formed a linear <b>systems</b> analysis <b>of</b> <b>compensatory</b> head roll in response to forced thorax oscillations in the fly. The feedforward pathway ex- hibited a high bandwidth and constant gain and reduced the response delay of the reflex. Large stability margins in the feedback pathway supplied by the compound eyes guaranteed stable behaviour in the face of response variability. The occlusion of the ocelli did not change the gain of the feedback pathway, but significantly reduced the la- tency. I investigated the use of iodine-enhanced computed x-ray microto- mography (microCT) to perform fast three-dimensional imaging of the neck and flight motor <b>systems.</b> Virtual dissections <b>of</b> major func- tional units illustrate the possibilities and limitations of microCT. To observe the configuration <b>of</b> motor <b>systems</b> in behaving flies I per- formed gated microtomography using hard x-rays at the TOMCAT beamline of the Swiss Light Source, a third generation synchrotron.

40|$|A central {{challenge}} to post-genomic biology is to elucidate the cellular networks that underlie biological form and function. Such networks of transcriptional, post- transcriptional and post-translation regulation form {{an essential part}} of the cellular repertoire. The recent explosion of high-throughput genome-wide technologies has allowed us to begin to elucidate the structure and function of such networks. Additionally, these technologies also allow direct comparisons of networks to be made across species [...] a subject that has received comparatively less attention. Simultaneous study of multiple species at appropriate evolutionary distances allows us to make more general statements about the robustness, evolvability, modularity and evolutionary redundancy of cellular networks than can otherwise be made when studying a single species in isolation. In this thesis, I describe the generation and analysis of genome- wide mRNA expression and transcription factor localization data across four diverse species of yeast separated by hundreds of millions of years of evolution. In Chapter 3, I generate genome-wide transcription factor localization data for the budding yeasts S. cerevisiae, and C. glabrata discovering a <b>system</b> <b>of</b> tightly coupled <b>compensatory</b> trans and cis mutations in the AP- 1 transcriptional network. These compensatory mutations allow for conserved transcriptional regulation despite continued genetic change. Such <b>systems</b> <b>of</b> tightly coupled <b>compensatory</b> mutations might serve to counter the widespread divergence observed in transcriptional networks, and may constitute a general evolutionary mechanism maintaining the regulation of transcriptional networks. In Chapter 4, I generate genome-wide transcription factor localization data for several cell-cycle transcription factors, but in the fission yeast S. pombe. Similarly to previous studies, I find relatively poor conservation of binding between orthologous transcription factors. However, further analysis of our data along with that of previous studies suggests that transcription factors while not being particularly well conserved at the level of the binding of target genes show stronger conservation in other ways such as DNA binding motif, the functional enrichment of target genes, transcription factor expression and transcription factor activit...|$|R

Mutations that substantially disrupt these interactions are deleterious and should not persist under selection.

How many different compensatory mutations can act on a given deleterious mutation? Although this quantity is fundamentally important to understanding the evolutionary consequence of mutation and the genetic complexity of adaptation, it remains poorly understood. To determine {{the shape of the}} statistical distribution for the number <b>of</b> <b>compensatory</b> mutations per deleterious mutation, we have performed a maximum-likelihood analysis of experimental data collected from the suppressor mutation literature. Suppressor mutations are used widely to assess protein interactions and are under certain conditions equivalent to compensatory mutations.

This distribution predicts an average <b>of</b> 11. 8 <b>compensatory</b> mutations per deleterious mutation. Furthermore, the success of the L-shaped gamma distribution is robust to variation in mutation rates among sites.

We investigated the role <b>of</b> <b>compensatory</b> movement {{patterns in the}} long-term functional motor recovery after stroke. [Subjects and Methods] Male Wistar rats were subjected to photothrombotic infarction to induce motor and sensorimotor cortex lesions. The rats were given task-specific training.
