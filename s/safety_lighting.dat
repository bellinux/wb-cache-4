25|$|The 22 tunnels (ca. 40km) are {{equipped}} with, among other things, <b>safety</b> <b>lighting,</b> electrical equipment (power supply boxes) and test {{equipment for the}} overhead line voltage. The line's technical equipment was commissioned in December 2013.|$|E
25|$|Clutter {{may also}} present a hazard in the {{aviation}} environment if aviation <b>safety</b> <b>lighting</b> must compete for pilot attention with non-relevant lighting. For instance, runway lighting may {{be confused with}} an array of suburban commercial lighting and aircraft collision avoidance lights may be confused with ground lights.|$|E
2500|$|The {{entrance}} to the magazines {{is in the middle}} rampart and gives access to a [...] and [...] brick tunnel which zig-zags under the rampart. Sixteen storage rooms serving as expense magazines for cartridges and shells are situated off the tunnel, with ammunition lifts linking them to the gun positions above. The main magazine consisted of two cartridge and shell stores, from where the ammunition would be transported along the tunnel to the smaller expense stores. To ensure that there was no possibility of sparks or naked flames causing explosions, <b>safety</b> <b>lighting</b> was provided from behind glass screens while the magazine workers had to wear special magazine slippers and safety clothing to ensure that they could not create sparks when they moved.|$|E
50|$|<b>Safety</b> <b>Light</b> {{curtains}} are opto-electronic {{devices that}} are used to safeguard personnel in the vicinity of moving machinery with the potential to cause harm such as presses, winders and palletisers. <b>Safety</b> <b>Light</b> curtains can be used as an alternative to mechanical barriers and other forms of traditional machine guarding. By reducing the need for physical guards and barriers, <b>safety</b> <b>light</b> curtains can increase the maintainability of the equipment they are guarding. The operability and efficiency of machinery can also be improved by the use of <b>safety</b> <b>light</b> curtains by, for example, allowing easier access for semi-automatic procedures.|$|R
2500|$|The <b>Safety</b> <b>Light</b> Corporation, in turn, {{was sold}} to its {{management}} and spun off as an independent entity in 1982. Tritium-illuminated signs were marketed under the name Isolite, which also became the name of new subsidiary to market and distribute <b>Safety</b> <b>Light</b> Corporation's products.|$|R

50|$|Garden {{lighting}} can be {{an important}} aspect of garden design. In most cases, various types of lighting techniques may be classified and defined by heights: <b>safety</b> <b>lighting,</b> uplighting, and downlighting. <b>Safety</b> <b>lighting</b> is the most practical application. However, {{it is more important to}} determine the type of lamps and fittings needed to create the desired effects. Light regulates three major plant processes: photosynthesis, phototropism, and photoperiodism.|$|E

50|$|In 2014, the United States Department of Transportation {{awarded a}} $1,000,000 grant to Hagerstown Regional Airport {{to plan and}} design major {{rehabilitation}} efforts on two taxiways, including ensuring the structural integrity of the taxiway and adding LED <b>safety</b> <b>lighting.</b>|$|E
50|$|Typically, <b>safety</b> <b>light</b> {{curtains}} {{are connected}} to a safety relay which will remove motive power from the hazard {{in the event that}} an object is detected. Safety relays can be provided with muting functionality which enables the temporary disabling of the safety function to allow objects to pass through the <b>safety</b> <b>light</b> curtains without tripping the safety relay. This is particularly useful for machinery which has some semi-automatic procedures.|$|R
50|$|All {{cars will}} carry a {{rear-mounted}} <b>safety</b> <b>light</b> (similar use in Formula One), {{to be controlled}} by race officials.|$|R
5|$|Also in March 2012, the Arlington County {{government}} {{gave away}} 550 red Capital Bikeshare helmets {{and twice as}} many flashing <b>safety</b> <b>lights</b> {{as part of a}} promotion.|$|R
50|$|Building {{automation}} is {{an example}} of a distributed control system - the computer networking of electronic devices designed to monitor and control the mechanical, security, fire and flood <b>safety,</b> <b>lighting</b> (especially emergency lighting), HVAC and humidity control and ventilation systems in a building.|$|E
50|$|Clutter {{may also}} present a hazard in the {{aviation}} environment if aviation <b>safety</b> <b>lighting</b> must compete for pilot attention with non-relevant lighting. For instance, runway lighting may {{be confused with}} an array of suburban commercial lighting and aircraft collision avoidance lights may be confused with ground lights.|$|E
50|$|In {{the field}} of {{physical}} security, security lighting is lighting that intended to deter or detect intrusions or other criminal activity {{on a piece of}} real property. It {{can also be used to}} increase a feeling of <b>safety.</b> <b>Lighting</b> is integral to crime prevention through environmental design.|$|E
50|$|Pickup Truck Racing {{is unique}} in 'big' oval racing, in that unlike e.g. NASCAR the trucks have rain tyres, wipers and rear <b>safety</b> <b>lights,</b> and will race on the ovals in the wet. Speeds are about 18 mph slower than when racing in fully dry conditions.|$|R
50|$|All CLC {{freight cars}} are painted a navy blue color with white lettering, {{although}} some have worn a mineral red color, and the CLC's locomotives are painted navy blue with white lettering and white pinstripes {{across the top}} quarter of the bodies and across the frame sill. However, in times past, some of the locomotives also wore Weyerhaeuser's color scheme of yellow and black. The lone caboose is painted safety yellow with black lettering, Weyerhaeuser colors, {{and seems to be}} one of Weyerhaeuser's old cabooses, most likely either #1 or #2. A signature safety feature of CLC's locomotives is the blue strobe light {{on the roof of the}} locomotives. CLC chooses blue as their <b>safety</b> <b>light</b> color because of the large number of yellow and red flashing <b>safety</b> <b>lights</b> around the Weyerhaeuser mill in Longview.|$|R
50|$|The list of {{statements}} is then reported as being clustered into these five or so cluster names (themes, frames, concepts). For example, one might report that your {{analysis of the}} statements shows that those at community meeting were using the concepts of exposure, interaction, <b>safety,</b> <b>light</b> and inspiration in their responses.|$|R
50|$|As {{part of a}} plan {{to upgrade}} {{high-traffic}} stations, refurbishment of the station began on 2013. Construction lasted from early 2013 until early 2016, resulting in a complete re-construction of the station and improved access, <b>safety,</b> <b>lighting</b> and the installation of fare gates as part of the larger Compass smart-card system.|$|E
50|$|A typical catwalk has a {{built in}} Electrical conduit to carry {{power for the}} {{lighting}} fixtures from the dimmers. They often hold other electrical wiring, for example standard sockets for tools, coaxial cable for projection and video monitors, built-in <b>safety</b> <b>lighting</b> to protect technicians, audio cables, and special cables for headset communications with other technicians.|$|E
5000|$|In {{addition}} to the wireless cluster, he was {{the inventor of the}} weatherproof, one-piece socket-reflector dome lighting system, the swivel plug, the Benjamin Crysteel Porcelain Enameled products (e.g. table tops, stove parts, washing machine tubs, refrigerators, refrigerator linings, and similar products), the “Benco” socket, “Benox” interchangeable devices, two-way plugs, many designs of industrial lighting equipment, <b>safety</b> <b>lighting</b> for oil refineries and places where gases or explosive dusts are present, besides hundreds of wiring improvements, many of which have been generally adopted. He was a collaborator in the development of “Elexits.” ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Safety</b> <b>Light</b> {{curtains}} are supplied as a {{pair with}} a transmitter and receiver. The transmitter projects an array of parallel infrared light beams to the receiver which consists {{of a number of}} photoelectric cells. When an object breaks {{one or more of the}} beams a stop signal is sent to the guarded equipment.|$|R
50|$|<b>Safety</b> <b>Light</b> {{curtains}} {{fall into}} a category of equipment known as presence detection devices. Other common presence detection devices are pressure-sensitive safety mats and laser scanners (often used on Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROV) when in industrial settings). Most important application of safety relays is in automation industries dealing with robotic cell set up.|$|R
50|$|The {{situation}} {{came to a}} head in 1910. The coal companies reduced wages by 16 percent, paying only 58 {{cents per}} ton-and-a-half of coal mined. The breaking point came when Keystone Coal and Coke announced that miners would have to begin using new <b>safety</b> <b>lights</b> and new forms of explosives—and pay for these items themselves.|$|R
5000|$|Early exit {{signs were}} {{generally}} either made {{of metal and}} lit by a nearby incandescent light bulb or were a white glass cover with [...] "EXIT" [...] written in red, placed {{directly in front of}} a single-bulb light fixture. An inherent flaw with these designs was that in a fire, the power to the light often failed. In addition, the fixtures could be difficult to see in a fire where smoke often reduced visibility, despite being relatively bright. The biggest problem was that the exit sign was hardly distinguishable from an ordinary <b>safety</b> <b>lighting</b> fixture commonly installed above doors in the past. The problem was partially solved by using red-tinted globes instead.|$|E
50|$|The {{entrance}} to the magazines {{is in the middle}} rampart and gives access to a 600 ft and 4 ft brick tunnel which zig-zags under the rampart. Sixteen storage rooms serving as expense magazines for cartridges and shells are situated off the tunnel, with ammunition lifts linking them to the gun positions above. The main magazine consisted of two cartridge and shell stores, from where the ammunition would be transported along the tunnel to the smaller expense stores.

5000|$|A unique {{opportunity}} was created when BART expanded down the Peninsula {{to create a}} [...] "linear park" [...] on the swath of undeveloped land {{on top of the}} tube. Running from Colma to Millbrae, South San Francisco's portion is three miles long, running through the center of town from the South San Francisco BART Station to the San Bruno BART Station. The Class I bicycle and pedestrian trail is a 10" [...] wide asphalt pathway with 2' decomposed granite shoulders, irrigated for low-maintenance landscaping, with <b>safety</b> <b>lighting,</b> signalized intersections where the trail crosses Spruce and Chestnut Avenues, and in-ground flashing lights at Orange Avenue. Also, a dog park is located adjacent from Orange Park along the pathway. The new park is called Centennial Way to commemorate the City's 100th birthday in 2008.|$|E
50|$|Delta was {{purchased}} in 1965 by the Novo Industrial Corporation. One of Novo Industrial Corp.'s subsidiary companies, King Bee Manufacturing Co., {{was moved to}} Marion, and its line of automotive <b>lighting</b> and <b>safety</b> equipment, including headlamps, <b>safety</b> <b>lights,</b> directional lights, mirrors, and reflectors for trucks, buses, trailers, and farm tractors, was merged into the Delta line of products.|$|R
50|$|The mast is {{a highly}} visible {{landmark}} and can be clearly seen from The Ridgeway, White Horse Hill {{and most of the}} Lambourn Downs, making it a useful reference point for hikers and ramblers. The red <b>safety</b> <b>lights</b> which mark the structure at night become visible for eastbound M4 motorists from as early as Swindon East (Junction 15).|$|R
50|$|After Stone's accident, the {{attraction}} was abruptly closed down and remained closed while <b>safety</b> <b>lights</b> were being installed. Later on, {{the walls in}} the theater were remodeled {{so that they would}} break away in case a similar accident happened. The attraction did not reopen until July 11, 1974. Stone is buried in Fairhaven Memorial Park in Santa Ana, Orange County, California.|$|R

40|$|EL {{is widely}} used in aircraft, watches, keyboard, {{background}} and <b>safety</b> <b>lighting</b> - mainly because EL-techniques generated glare- and shadow-free homogeneous light surfaces with smallest mounting depth and low power consumption. Those light surfaces can be procuced in various dimensions and contours {{in the form of}} foils. Further advantages of EL foils are its breaking resistance, its insensitivity to temperature and the fact that that lighting foils do not heat up. Currently, in combination with the in-mould-technology 3 -dimensional disposition of EL foil is possible. Fraunhofer IPA is working on the integration of functional elements like EL-foils in plastic products with the help of additive manufacturing technologies...|$|E
40|$|The Space Station {{will bring}} a great {{increase}} in rendezvous traffic. Formerly, rendezvous has been expensive {{in terms of time}} and crew involvement. Multiple trajectory adjustments on separate orbits have been required to meet <b>safety,</b> <b>lighting,</b> and geometry requirements. This paper describes a new guidance technique in which the approach trajectory is shaped by a sequence of velocity increments in order to satisfy multiple constraints within a single orbit. The approach phase is planned before the mission, leaving a group of free parameters that are optimized by onboard guidance. Fuel penalties are typically a few percent, compared to unshaped Hohmann transfers, and total fuel costs can be less than those of more time-consuming ways of meeting the same requirements...|$|E
25|$|Shortly after midnight, {{the vehicle}} struck a 12.5-ton Bedford {{motorway}} maintenance truck {{parked on the}} hard shoulder of an unlit stretch of the M40 near junction 15. The truck's <b>safety</b> <b>lights</b> were flashing. The minibus, which {{was estimated to be}} travelling at 73 to 84mph {{at the time of the}} collision, exploded shortly after the crash and the bodies of several victims remained trapped in the wreckage.|$|R
25|$|Starting in 1979, {{the company}} {{underwent}} an extensive reorganization. A new corporation, Metreal, Inc., {{was created to}} hold {{the assets of the}} Bloomsburg plant. Manufacturing operations were subsequently moved into new wholly owned subsidiary corporations: <b>Safety</b> <b>Light</b> Corporation, USR Chemical Products, USR Lighting, USR Metals, and U.S. Natural Resources. Finally, in May 1980, U.S. Radium created a new holding company, USR Industries, Inc., and merged itself into it.|$|R
