There is no public discussion of the adoption of IBAN identifiers for incoming international transactions. Any process towards IBAN would involve considerable changes to bank software and computer systems, and the requirement for financial institutions to adopt defined length account numbers. Outgoing international transfers must use either the SWIFT or IBAN system in use in the destination country, which would incorporate that country's format for BBAN.|$|E

2500|$|To aid {{development}} of such programs, and the re-use of extant code, Xcode 6 offers a semi-automated system that builds and maintains a bridging header to expose Objective-C <b>code</b> to <b>Swift.</b> This {{takes the form}} of an additional header file that simply defines or imports all of the Objective-C symbols that are needed by the project's <b>Swift</b> <b>code.</b> At that point, Swift can refer to the types, functions, and variables declared in those imports as though they were written in <b>Swift.</b> Objective-C <b>code</b> can also use <b>Swift</b> <b>code</b> directly, by importing an automatically maintained header file with Objective-C declarations of the project's Swift symbols. For instance, an Objective-C file in a mixed project called [...] "MyApp" [...] could access Swift classes or functions with the code #import [...] "MyApp-Swift.h". Not all symbols are available through this mechanism, however—use of Swift-specific features like generic types, non-object optional types, sophisticated enums, or even Unicode identifiers may render a symbol inaccessible from Objective-C.|$|R
