40|$|Waste {{rock and}} {{tailings}} generated by sulphide ore mining often contains {{large amounts of}} iron sulphides which oxidize when exposed to atmospheric oxygen and may generate acidity. In the absence of alkaline minerals to neutralize this acidity, elements including harmful heavy metals become mobile. Clearly, it is {{a high priority for}} mining operations to reduce the impact of mining waste on the environment. New research aimed to take advantage of industrial rest products to inhibit acid mine drainage has yielded some reason for optimism. The recycling of chemicals in sulphate pulp mills yields green liquor dregs (GLD). The fact that GLD have a low hydraulic conductivity and are alkaline opens the possibility of using it for construction of sealing layers for sulphidic mine waste. The study consists of two parts. The aim of the first part was to characterize the GLD and evaluate their <b>suitability</b> <b>for</b> <b>sealing</b> layer purposes. GLD were characterized physically, mineralogically and chemically to define variations in the properties of the material and to evaluate if they can act as a potential candidate for construction of sealing layers. Compared to lime, the pure GLD appear to have a higher porosity and surface area even though both materials have comparable particle size. The shear strength may, however, be insufficient. In cover applications, where high compaction grade and low hydraulic conductivity are desirable, mixing additives to GLD is necessary to improve the material properties. Based on the characterization results, the difference between batches is fairly small both mineralogically and physically. GLD could be an alternative to traditional sealing layers made of till since it was shown to have relatively low hydraulic conductivity and high water retention potential. The small particle size and high buffer capacity makes it a better candidate than till which usually varies in size and hydraulic conductivity. There is a chemical variation of the material but the element content {{does not seem to be}} an environmental concern. The aim of the second part of the study was to improve the performance of the GLD by blending them with other rest products. Geotechnical and geochemical investigations were performed on GLD mixed with tailings. Humidity cell tests were used to study the effect of GLD on the mobility of elements considered to be major environmental issues in the tailings. By adding tailings to GLD, the shear strength improved 2 - 3 times after 1 month of curing. The water retention capacity remained at a high level. Humidity cell tests revealed that a 50 / 50 mix of GLD and tailings has a direct effect on the metal leaching from tailings. The alkaline capacity of the pulping waste raised the pH, thereby stabilizing the tailings and reducing the leaching of Al, Cd, Cu, Ni, Co, Cr and Mn. The amount of leached elements could be directly related to the pH during the test. Elements that showed an increase of leaching as a result of the application of GLD were Mo and As. This is explained by the chemical behavior of these elements and their tendency to become mobile at high pH. In summary, GLD have the potential to both reduce the amount of leachate generated in tailings and, due to their alkaline property, improve the leachate quality by decreasing the metal mobility. However, restrictions occur when GLD are blended with tailings containing large amounts of As and Mo since an increased leaching may be expected. Further research will focus on the aging of the material and its long-term stability.

Selected adhesives were screened {{on the basis of}} their ability to seal gold-plated Kovar butterfly-type packages that retain their seal integrity after individual exposures to increasingly severe temperature-humidity environments. Tests were also run using thermal shock, temperature cycling, mechanical shock and temperature aging.

40|$|A {{preliminary}} investigation {{was made to}} determine the feasibility of using adhesive package <b>sealing</b> <b>for</b> hybrid microcircuits. Major effort consisted of: (1) surveying representative hybrid manufacturers to assess the current use of adhesives for package sealing; (2) making a cost comparison of metallurgical versus adhesive package sealing; (3) determining the seal integrity of gold plated flatpack type packages sealed with selected adhesives, thermal shock, temperature cycling, mechanical shock, and constant acceleration test environments; and (4) defining a more comprehensive study to continue the evaluation of adhesives <b>for</b> package <b>sealing.</b> Results showed that 1. 27 cm square gold plated flatpack type packages sealed with the film adhesives and the paste adhesive retained their seal integrity after all tests, and that similarly prepared 2. 54 cm square packages retained their seal integrity after all tests except the 10, 000 g's constant acceleration test. It is concluded that these results are encouraging, {{but by no means}} sufficient to establish the <b>suitability</b> of adhesives <b>for</b> <b>sealing</b> high reliability hybrid microcircuits...|$|R

40|$|Coal tars {{have been}} {{identified}} as posing a threat to human health due to their toxic, mutagenic and carcinogenic characteristics. Workers involved in former gasholders decommissioning are potentially exposed to relevant concentrations of volatile and semi-volatile hydrocarbons upon opening up derelict tanks and during tar excavation/removal. While information on contaminated sites air- quality and its implications on medium-long term exposure is available, acute exposure issues associated with the execution of critical tasks are less understood. Calculations indicated that the concentration of a given contaminant in the gasholder vapour phase only depends on the coal tar composition, being only barely affected by the presence of water in the gasholder and the tar volume/void space ratio. Fugacity modelling suggested that risk-critical compounds such as benzene, naphthalene and other monocyclic and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons may gather in the gasholder air phase at significant concentrations. Gasholder emissions were measured on-site and compared with the workplace exposure limits (WELs) currently in use in UK. While levels for most of the toxic compounds were far lower than WELs, benzene air-concentrations where found to be above the accepted threshold. In addition due to the long exposure periods involved in gasholder decommissioning and the significant contribution given by naphthalene to the total coal tar vapour concentration, the adoption of a WEL for naphthalene may need to be considered to support operators in preventing human health risk at the workplace. The Level I fugacity approach used in this study demonstrated its <b>suitability</b> <b>for</b> applications to <b>sealed</b> environments such as gasholders and its further refining could provide a useful tool for land remediation risk assessors.

For this, we analyzed the spatial distribution over Romanian territory of the oenoclimate aptitude index (IAOe) for the 1961 to 1990 and 1991 to 2013 time periods. The IAOe has been calculated based on gridded data at 10 × 10 [*]km resolution of average daily temperature, precipitation and sunshine duration between 1961 – 2013, originating from about 150 weather stations across Romanian territory and recorded in the ROCADA database. The study reveals: northward shifts and to higher altitudes of <b>suitability</b> <b>for</b> wine production; the appearance of new areas suitable for wine production; the expansion or the shrinkage of the current areas suitable for wine production; shifts in classes of <b>suitability</b> <b>for</b> wine production in the current wine regions and appearance of premises of replacing their specific varieties and traditional wine type production; the tendency to level climate suitability at regional scale by diminishing <b>suitability</b> <b>for</b> white wines and replacing it with climate <b>suitability</b> <b>for</b> red wines.
