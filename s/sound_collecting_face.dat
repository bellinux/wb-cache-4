How to train a face detector based on the <b>collected</b> enormous <b>face</b> database? This paper presents a manifold-based method to subsample. That is, we learn the manifold from the <b>collected</b> <b>face</b> database and then subsample training set by the estimated geodesic distance which is calculated during the manifold learning. Using the subsampled training set based on the manifold, we train an AdaBoost-based face detector. The trained detector is tested on the MIT+CMU frontal face test set. The experimental results show that the proposed method is effective and efficient to train a classifier confronted with the huge database. ...|$|R

40|$|For {{the past}} 20 years, both the {{academic}} and industrial communities have paid more attention and interest on {{the research and development}} of face recognition technologies. Generally, face recognition can be classified into three categories, i. e., holistic, feature-based and hybrid method.

Face recognition techniques has numerous potential in various applications, particularly in information security, law enforcement and surveillance.

While large-scale acoustic data make manual analysis infeasible, they provide a suitable playground for machine learning approaches.

40|$|Cataloged from PDF {{version of}} article. Thesis (M. S.) : Bilkent University, Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, İhsan Doğramacı Bilkent University, 2017. Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 42 - 45). This thesis proposes a spinal health assessment {{system based on}} acoustic biosignals. The {{aim of this study}} is to offer an alternative to the conventional spinal health assessment techniques such as MR, CT or x-ray scans. As conventional methods are time-consuming, expensive and harmful (radiation risk caused by medical scanning techniques), a cheap, fast and harmless method is proposed. It is observed that individuals with spinal health problems have unusual sounds. Using automatic speech recognition (ASR) algorithms, a diagnosis algorithm was developed for classifying joint <b>sounds</b> <b>collected</b> from the vertebrae of human subjects. First, feature parameters are extracted from spinal sounds. One of the most popular feature parameters used in speech recognition are Mel Frequency Cepstrum Coefficients (MFCC). MFCC parameters are classified using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). In addition, the scattering transform cepstral coeffi- cients (STCC) algorithm is implemented as an alternative to the mel filterbank in MFCC. The correlation between the medical history of the subjects and the " <b>sound</b> in the <b>collected</b> <b>sound</b> data is the basis of the classification algorithm. In the light of collected data, it is observed that " sounds are detected in the individuals who have suffered low back pain (slipped disk) but not in healthy individuals. The identification of the " sound is carried out by using MFCC/STCC and ANN. The system has 92. 2...|$|R

40|$|In this study, the {{properties}} of the reflected paths and scattering phenomena were investigated in the LMDS band (28 GHz). We used the newly developed sampling swept time delay short pulse (SSTDSP) <b>sounder</b> to <b>collect</b> field data in certain locations on the Virginia Tech campus. The <b>sounder</b> <b>collected</b> the channel impulse response analog waveform, sampled, digitized and reconstructed it. The stored data were used to produce the power delay profile and other channel parameters. In particular, we collected scattered and reflected data regarding the channel response with different incident angle and distance set-ups from brick and limestone walls. We used the reflected pulse width and maximum excess delay derived from each power delay profile to analyze the rough surface scattering phenomena. We found that limestone and brick walls exhibited some diffuse scattering. The reflected pulse of a limestone wall had more maximum excess delay spread than did a brick wall at - 15 dB power threshold. The mean maximum excess delay for the reflected pulse of the limestone wall measurement set-ups was more than two times that of the brick wall. With equal transmitter and receiver distances to the wall, we found that as the incident angle increased, the maximum excess delay decreased but the perpendicular reflection coefficient increased. It is recommended that for future study, a second generation SSTDSP sounder will replicate the measurement with larger distance and angle set-ups as well as in non-line-of-sight areas...|$|R

While reflecting from the pinna, sound also goes through a filtering process, as well as frequency dependent amplitude modulation which adds directional information to the sound (see sound localization, vertical sound localization, head-related transfer function, pinna notch). In various species, the pinna can also signal mood and radiate heat.|$|R

40|$|I {{experimentally}} {{examined the}} adaptive {{significance of the}} anatomical and behavioral convergence between the harrier (Circus cyaneus, also refered to as the marsh hawk) and certain owls {{that are capable of}} capturing prey in total darkness. Anatomically, both the harrier and owls have evolved a <b>sound</b> <b>collecting</b> facial ruff (a curved wall of skin and feathers surrounding the ears) analogous to the mammalian pinna. Behaviorally, both the harrier and the owls forage very close to the substrate. This position substantially reduces the field of view but concomitantly increases the intensity and directional resolution of the acoustical cues emitted by concealed prey. There are at least two mutually exclusive evolutionary alternatives for localizing highly concealed prey. A predator relying on high resolution vision can circumvent the reduced visibility of individual prey by foraging from a high perch or flight position. Increased foraging height can increase the field of view and hence the number o...|$|R
