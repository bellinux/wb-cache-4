If the two similar investments are not at face value offering the same interest rate return, the difference should conceptually be made up by changes in the exchange rate {{over the life of}} the investment. IRP basically provides the math to calculate a projected or implied forward rate of exchange. This calculated rate is not and cannot be considered a prediction or forecast, but rather is the arbitrage-free calculation for what the exchange rate is implied to be in order for it to be impossible to make a free profit by converting money to one currency, investing it for a period, then converting back and making more money than if a person had invested in the same opportunity in the original currency.|$|E

40|$|Reviewing {{the studies}} {{about the effects}} of {{learning}} <b>simple</b> <b>concepts</b> upon the learning of compound concept which involved combinations of <b>simple</b> <b>concepts</b> and the problem of reversal and nonreversal shift in human concept formation, the author reported his own experiments about the same problems. Their results showed the facilitation effects of learning <b>simple</b> <b>concepts</b> which were involved in the compound concept, and the superiority of reversal shift to nonreversal shift. The interpretation of the results is that in concept formation of human adults in the cardsorting situation a mediated response is made o the external stimulus, which operates as a cue that is connected to the overt response, and that concept formation of human adults is the change of order of mediated response hierarchy, in which the correct response becomes dominant in the hierarchy. The effect of learning the appropriate <b>simple</b> <b>concepts</b> and reversal shift is to give the opportunity of being dominant to the correct mediated response. this effect is made evident or not is determined by the position of the correct mediated response in the hierarchy. There are some difficult problems to be solved about the procedure of the studies reported above...|$|R

25|$|DNA barcoding {{is based}} on a {{relatively}} <b>simple</b> <b>concept.</b> All eukaryote cells contain mitochondria, and animal mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) has a relatively fast mutation rate, resulting in the generation of diversity within and between populations over relatively short evolutionary timescales (thousands of generations). Typically, in animals, a single mtDNA genome is transmitted to offspring by each breeding female, and the genetic effective population size is proportional to the number of breeding females. This contrasts with the nuclear genome, which is around 100 000 times larger, where males and females each contribute two full genomes to the gene pool and effective size is therefore proportional to twice the total population size. This reduction in effective population size leads to more rapid sorting of mtDNA gene lineages within and among populations through time, due to variance in fecundity among individuals (the principle of coalescence). The combined effect of higher mutation rates and more rapid sorting of variation usually results in divergence of mtDNA sequences among species and a comparatively small variance within species. A 658-bp region (the Folmer region) of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI or COX1) gene was proposed as a potential 'barcode'.|$|E

IGN editors ranked the game 33rd in their 2003 list of Top 100 Games of All Time, and 37th in their 2005 list of Top 100 Games of All Time. They remarked that Wave Race 64 [...] "incorporated water physics into racing unlike any game before it, or any since. The <b>simple</b> <b>concept</b> of racing on jet skis was complicated by changing wave patterns, swells, and rising tides, and Nintendo added its trademark depth to broaden and deepen the unique racer."

Second unit director Brett Dowler later recounted that it [...] "rained every day". This put a strain on {{the cast and crew}} because almost every main shot needed was intended to be outdoors in the daylight. Because of the massive delays, changes were made: the actors' schedules were rearranged and Kim Manners was brought in to assist Dowler in finishing the second unit of the episode.

40|$|Natural {{languages}} are means to denote concepts. However word sense ambiguities make {{natural language processing}} and conceptual processing almost impossible. To bridge the gaps between natural language representations and conceptual representations, we propose a universal concept representational mechanism, called Extended-HowNet, which was evolved from HowNet. It extends the word sense definition mechanism of HowNet and uses WordNet synsets as vocabulary to describe concepts. Each word sense (or concept) is defined by some <b>simpler</b> <b>concepts.</b> The <b>simple</b> <b>concepts</b> used in the definitions can be further decomposed into even <b>simpler</b> <b>concepts,</b> until primitive or basic concepts are reached. Therefore {{the definition of a}} concept can be dynamically decomposed and unified into Extended-HowNet at different levels of representations. Extended-HowNet are language independent. Any word sense of any language can be defined and achieved near-canonical representation. For any two concepts, not only their semantic distances but also their sense similarity and difference are known by checking their definitions. In addition to taxonomy links, concepts are also associated by their shared conceptual features. Fine-grain differences among near-synonyms can be differentiated by adding new features. 1...|$|R

Los Angeles Times critic Lynne Heffley commended the interactive aspects of the show but mentioned that the simplified dialogue can distract from the educational content.

[...] In her Common Sense Media review, Andrea Graham stated that the language [...] "should {{not be seen as}} detrimental to a child's speech development – rather, it's a language that young children understand and appreciate." [...] Jaime Egan of Families.com wrote negatively of the dialogue but felt that it did not divert from the educational value. She wrote that [...] "even though the characters do not speak in complete sentences ... the lessons that this show teaches can be invaluable." [...] The hosts of Ray William Johnson's Equals Three criticized the simplified language, stating that the puppets [...] "didn't even use full sentences. They just said enough words to make themselves understood." [...] Amy Sohn of New York magazine expressed her opinion that the language ruined the show as a whole, calling the characters [...] "speech-impaired."

500|$|Critics {{praised the}} {{various aspects of}} gameplay, {{although}} the difficulty and overuse of the puzzle genre were negative factors. Andy Dyer from Mega acknowledged that the game had a <b>simple</b> <b>concept</b> and also observed {{that it did not}} provide enough of a challenge. Lucas Thomas of IGN enjoyed the game's array of puzzles and recognised that its design was intended to encourage two-player competition. Reviewing the Mega Drive version, Damien McFerran of NintendoLife similarly echoed Thomas' opinion of the game's intention to encourage two-player competition, and also noted that it provided a [...] "decent" [...] challenge despite opining that a single player could get bored easily. In contrast, Andrew Webster of Gamezebo criticised the high level of difficulty and the game's general accessibility due to its [...] "ancient" [...] password save system. Aaron Thomas of GameSpot found the game difficult to recommend due to the availability of free Puyo Puyo clones on the PC, but commended its basic mechanics, wide range of game modes, and gradually increasing difficulty. Eurogamer's Kristan Reed labelled the game as a [...] "fairly unapologetic reskin" [...] of Puyo Puyo and thought that Sega decided to [...] "shoehorn" [...] the Sonic the Hedgehog franchise in order to enhance their sales, although Reed admitted the gameplay was solid and addictive. A reviewer from Jeuxvideo.com questioned the game's originality, saying that [...] "stacking beans to make them disappear is not a new concept" [...] but would still satisfy fans of the genre. Amanda Tipping from Computer and Video Games thought that the game was as addictive and as puzzling as the Tetris series, and also preferred the game's colourful visuals as opposed to Tetris.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} {{consists}} of a simplistic concept [...] a One Direction recording session. In a November 2012 interview with MTV News, Arnell {{said he did not}} want to make it about anything more than that, [...] "When I first heard the track, the mix on it was so simple and so pure and you could hear all the qualities of the voices on the track, I just wanted to come up with something that when the viewer watched it, it was almost like sitting there listening to the boys sing the track." [...] Arnell subsequently developed the idea of a recording studio setting, thinking that it was [...] "the most pure way to do it". He wanted to make the music video as [...] "uncontrived as possible" [...] without [...] "any other bullsh-- or effects in the way of it." [...] While Arnell conceded that music video may seem like a <b>simple</b> <b>concept,</b> the shoot itself took over twelve hours to complete and said that it was [...] "one of the hardest things I've ever done." [...] The group performed it [...] "over and over again because I was just trying to get different shots, different angles, different qualities." [...] As for the decision to shoot the video in black-and-white, Arnell felt it best captured the essence of the ballad. He also noted that was his intention to give the music video the feeling as if One Direction are singing it right to you, [...] "It's purely about the clarity of it. When you sit there watching it, it's almost like these little bits of eye contact [...] you really feel like the guys are singing it to you." ...|$|E
50|$|This model, however, {{has come}} under {{criticism}} due to its inconsistency with empirical studies. If conceptual combination employed serial spreading activation, for instance, it should take longer to verify the properties of complex concepts, as they necessarily possess more concepts than their component <b>simple</b> <b>concepts.</b> Research has nonetheless shown that it takes less time to confirm complex concepts' properties than their components and about equal time to reject false properties for both. This occurred even when {{the properties of the}} complex concept contradicted those of the <b>simple</b> <b>concepts.</b> Likewise, when experiment participants are exposed to a set of features first, and then asked to verify whether or not they correspond to <b>simple</b> or complex <b>concepts,</b> the participants tend to provide correct verification answers for the complex concepts more quickly.|$|R

5000|$|The {{features}} and properties of complex concepts are generally {{assumed to be}} derived from the <b>simple</b> <b>concepts</b> that compose them. One popularly discussed model involves a two-stage serial process. In the initial stage, features from each of the component <b>simple</b> <b>concepts</b> are retrieved from memory through spreading activation. This allows a complex concept to accrue features with existing relationships with its component <b>simple</b> <b>concepts.</b> During this stage, the basic definition of what the complex concept is and/or means is generates. In the second stage, knowledge and reasoning are employed upon the features accrued in the previous stage to generate further features. For example, one might reason that the complex concept [...] "white jacket," [...] if worn in a blizzard, would make one difficult to see; it would follow that one should ascribe the property of [...] "good for winter camouflage," [...] despite the fact that this property is not closely attached to the component concepts [...] "white" [...] nor [...] "jacket." [...] This stage is especially useful when properties of complex concepts contradict those of their component concepts, such as the different colours of milk and chocolate milk.|$|R
