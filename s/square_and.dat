50|$|The {{symmetry}} axes of the triangles <b>and</b> <b>squares</b> {{that lie}} {{between the white}} lines are true hyperbolic lines. The <b>squares</b> <b>and</b> triangles of the woodcut closely resemble the tritetragonal tiling of the hyperbolic plane, which also features <b>squares</b> <b>and</b> triangles meeting in the same incidence pattern.However, the precise geometry of these shapes is not the same. In the tritetragonal tiling, {{the sides of the}} <b>squares</b> <b>and</b> triangles are hyperbolically straight line segments, which do not link up in smooth curves; instead they form polygonal chains with corners. In Escher's woodcut, the sides of the <b>squares</b> <b>and</b> triangles are formed by arcs of hypercycles, which are not straight in hyperbolic geometry, but which connect smoothly to each other without corners.|$|R
