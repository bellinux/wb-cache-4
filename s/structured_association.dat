40|$|Abstract Background <b>Structured</b> <b>association</b> mapping {{is proving}} to be a {{powerful}} strategy to find genetic polymorphisms associated with disease. However, these algorithms are often distributed as command line implementations that require expertise and effort to customize and put into practice. Because of the difficulty required to use these cutting-edge techniques, geneticists often revert to simpler, less powerful methods. Results To make <b>structured</b> <b>association</b> mapping more accessible to geneticists, we have developed an automatic processing system called Auto-SAM. Auto-SAM enables geneticists to run <b>structured</b> <b>association</b> mapping algorithms automatically, using parallelization. Auto-SAM includes algorithms to discover gene-networks and find population structure. Auto-SAM can also run popular association mapping algorithms, in addition to five <b>structured</b> <b>association</b> mapping algorithms.

40|$|The {{strengths}} of association mapping lie in its resolution and allelic richness, but spurious associations arising from historical relationships and selection patterns {{need to be}} accounted for in statistical analyses. Here we reanalyze {{one of the first}} generation <b>structured</b> <b>association</b> mapping studies of the Dwarf 8 (d 8) locus with flowering time in maize using the full range of new mapping populations, statistical approaches, and haplotype maps. Because this trait was highly correlated with population structure, we found that basic <b>structured</b> <b>association</b> methods overestimate phenotypic effects in the region, while mixed model approaches perform substantially better. Combined with analysis of the maize nested association mapping population (a multi-family crossing design), it is concluded that most, if not all, of the QTL effects at the general location of the d 8 locus are from rare extended haplotypes that include other linked QTLs and that d 8 is unlikely to be involved in controlling flowering time in maize. Previous independent studies have shown evidence for selection at the d 8 locus. Based on the evidence of population bottleneck, selection patterns, and haplotype structure observed in the region, we suggest that multiple traits may be strongly correlated with population structure and that selection on these traits has influenced segregation patterns in the region. Overall, this study provides insight into how modern associatio...|$|E

40|$|Despite {{the success}} of {{genome-wide}} association studies in detecting novel disease variants, we are still far from a complete understanding of the mechanisms through which variants cause disease. Most of previous studies have considered only genome-phenome associations. However, the integration of transcriptome data may help further elucidate the mechanisms through which genetic mutations lead to disease and uncover potential pathways to target for treatment. We present a novel <b>structured</b> <b>association</b> mapping strategy for finding genome-transcriptome-phenome associations when SNP, gene-expression, and phenotype data are available for the same cohort. We do so via a two-step procedure where genome-transcriptome associations are identified by GFlasso, a sparse regression technique presented previously. Transcriptome-phenome associations are then found by a novel proposed method called gGFlasso, which leverages structure inherent in the genes and phenotypic traits. Due to the complex nature of three-way association results, visualization tools can aid in the discovery of causal SNPs and regulatory mechanisms affecting diseases. Using wellgrounded visualization techniques, we have designed new visualizations that filter through large three-way association results to detect interesting SNPs and associated genes and traits. The two-step GFlasso-gGFlasso algorithmic approach and new visualizations are integrated into GenAMap, a visual analytics system for <b>structured</b> <b>association</b> mapping. Results on simulated datasets show that our approach {{has the potential to}} increase the sensitivity and specificity of association studies, compared to existing procedures that do not exploit the full structural information of the data.
