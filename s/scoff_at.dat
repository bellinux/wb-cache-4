500|$|Richardson {{had gained}} a {{national}} {{reputation as a}} great actor while at the Old Vic; films gave {{him the opportunity to}} reach an international audience. Unlike some of his theatre colleagues, he was never condescending about film work. He admitted that film could be [...] "a cage for an actor, but a cage in which they sometimes put a little gold", but he did not regard filming as merely a means of subsidising his much less profitable stage work. He said, [...] "I've never been one of those chaps who <b>scoff</b> <b>at</b> films. I think they're a marvellous medium, and are to the stage what engravings are to painting. The theatre may give you big chances, but the cinema teaches you the details of craftsmanship." [...] The Fallen Idol was followed by Richardson's first Hollywood part. He played Dr Sloper, the overprotective father of Olivia de Havilland in The Heiress, [...] based on Henry James's novel Washington Square. The film did not prosper at the box-office despite good reviews, [...] an Academy Award for Best Actress for Havilland, and nominations for the director (William Wyler) and Richardson.|$|E
500|$|... "Sweet Dreams" [...] was {{acclaimed}} by critics, {{some of whom}} praised {{its dark}} tone and electropop sound {{that is different from}} Knowles' previous work. James Montgomery of MTV News wrote that Knowles' vocals, which he called, [...] "icy and cool, slippery like mercury [...] nothing to <b>scoff</b> <b>at</b> either", help make the song an [...] "undeniable smash" [...] that is unique compared to the work of other artists. Jennifer Vineyard of the same publication argued that the rock elements and smooth vocals contribute to Knowles' [...] "fierce" [...] alter ego, who [...] "dares the listener to dream of her, warning that it might be a 'beautiful nightmare'." [...] Arielle Castillo of Miami New Times noted that [...] "Sweet Dreams" [...] is another one of Jim Jonsin's productions with a keyboard-propelled arrangement, but unlike the material Jonsin crafted for Soulja Boy, the song is [...] "swirling, and darker". Joey Guerra of the Houston Chronicle and Gary Trust of Billboard magazine agreed that the song is one of Knowles' purest dance songs and is [...] "an irresistible call to the dance floor". Describing [...] "Sweet Dreams" [...] as a [...] "cool dance track", Dennis Amith of J!-ENT complimented its arrangement, calling it [...] "experimental" [...] with [...] "cool transitions".|$|E

500|$|Borscht's westward {{expansion}} {{was less}} successful; Germans used to <b>scoff</b> <b>at</b> the soup {{along with other}} East European fare. What helped familiarize Western Europe with borscht was the practice of Russian emperors, as well as Russian and Polish aristocrats, to employ celebrated French chefs, who later presented their own versions of the dish as a foreign curiosity back in France. One of the first French chefs to do so was , who worked briefly for Emperor Alexander I in 1819. In his take on borscht, the original Russian soup served only as inspiration for an extravagant [...] dish {{with an air of}} eastern exoticism. Apart from vegetables and beet sour, his recipe calls for a roast chicken, a fried chicken, a duck, a piece of veal, an oxtail, a marrow bone, one pound of bacon, and six large sausages, and suggests serving with beef quenelles, deviled eggs and croûtons. , 's apprentice, who was mostly fascinated by the soup's vivid ruby-red color, simplified his master's recipe, while also securing the place of [...] ("borscht soup") in French cuisine. [...] and , both of whom had been employed at Polish aristocratic courts, presented borscht to the French public as a Polish soup; their cookbook, , published in 1856, contains a borscht recipe under the descriptive name, [...] ("Polish-style beet-juice soup"), which had been changed to [...] by the third edition in 1868. In 1867, beetroot borscht was served, along with herrings, sturgeon, coulibiac, Pozharsky cutlets and vinaigrette salad, at a Russian-themed dinner at the International Exposition in Paris, strengthening its international association with Russian culture.|$|E

[...] The operation of the ship's shallop was also probably under his control, a light open boat with oars or sails (see seaman Thomas English). William Bradford made this comment about the boatswain: [...] "the boatswain... was a proud young man, who would often curse and <b>scoff</b> <b>at</b> the passengers, but when he grew weak they had compassion on him and helped him." [...] But despite such assistance, the unnamed boatswain died the first winter.|$|E

As Hall has put it, [...] "In this era of 'practical' things men ridicule even the existence of God.

2500|$|The Replacements {{began to}} {{distance}} themselves from the hardcore punk scene after the release of Stink.

He even wrote an acoustic ballad, [...] "You're Getting Married One Night", but when he played it {{to the rest of the}} band, it was met with silence. [...] "Save that for your solo album, Paul," [...] Bob Stinson said. [...] "That ain't the Replacements". The track remained unreleased for years. Westerberg realized his toughest audience was the band itself, later saying, [...] "If it doesn't rock enough, Bob will <b>scoff</b> <b>at</b> it, and if it isn't catchy enough, Chris won't like it, and if it isn't modern enough, Tommy won't like it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Plutarch gives Pythones as {{a synonym}} for engastrimythoi ("belly-talkers" [...] or [...] "ventriloquists"), a suspect type of mantic who {{employed}} trickery in projecting a voice, sometimes through a device such as a mechanical snake. The snake was probably the chosen medium because of its association in myth with Delphi, where Apollo killed the serpent (the Python) to establish his own oracle there. Plutarch and other ancient authors <b>scoff</b> <b>at</b> {{the notion that the}} god himself enters the body of a paid mantic for use as a mouthpiece. The early Church fathers, however, attributed the behavior of engastrimythoi to demonic possession. Like Chrysostom, the early Christian theologian Origen finds the Pythia's receptive vagina disturbing and uses the gender of Apollo's oracle as a way to disparage the Delphic religion, saying that if Apollo were a true god, he would have chosen a male prophet: ...|$|E

2500|$|The Evangelical Christian Church (Christian Disciples) [...] on [...] {{participated in}} the holiness {{movement}} that occurred spontaneously {{in various parts of}} the United States during the latter part of the 19th century. The converts needed to be established in holiness of heart and life, and opportunities were opening for the expansion of the work into other communities to ending abolitionism in the United States with the involvement of James O'Kelly, an American Methodist clergyman. The distinctive characteristic of early Methodism in the United States that most appealed to people and resulted in conversions and joining the Evangelical Christian Church (Christian Disciples) was not a theological concept, such as Arminianism, but rather was [...] "enthusiasm," [...] including dreams, dancing, visions, supernatural impressions, miraculous healings, speaking in tongues, praising God, laughter, swoons, and falling down in trances. It was also reported that those who came to the revival meetings <b>scoff</b> <b>at</b> these s were not immune to these life changing experiences.|$|E
2500|$|Over time, many Londoners {{came forward}} with their own unusual anecdotes attesting to Lambe’s [...] "demonic" [...] or [...] "devilish" [...] nature. [...] Some claimed that he had struck {{political}} foes with impotence, and others blamed him for a 1626 whirlwind along the Thames which allegedly unearthed corpses in a churchyard. One of the strangest accounts is recorded in Richard Baxter's 1691 Certainty of the World of Spirits. [...] According to this story, Lambe once invited an audience into an inner room of his house, where he demonstrated his powers by conjuring a miniature tree and three miniature woodsmen, who chopped it down. [...] One man allegedly gathered wood chips from the tree as evidence, but the pieces attracted violent storms to his house, and he soon disposed of them. [...] Skeptics continued to <b>scoff</b> <b>at</b> such accounts, dismissing Lambe as “a notable mountebank and impostor", but many others were firmly convinced that Lambe was a dangerous magician.|$|E

2500|$|Costume {{designer}} Catherine George {{explained that}} Mason was initially {{inspired by a}} Smithsonian photograph that production designer Ondrej Nekvasil had found of an older lady amongst {{a room full of}} dead birds at the Museum of Natural History, who was a real person from Swinton's childhood. In designing Mason's costume, George found images of women from their late 60s and early 70s, adding that, [...] " [...] a certain type that I remembered growing up who would wear their fur to go into town and <b>scoff</b> <b>at</b> people who were less better off, a bit of a Margaret Thatcher type, really." [...] George also designed Mason's suit to look [...] "a typical conservative politician shape and style" [...] with the purple adding a royal quality to the attire. She had [...] "collected pictures of dictators wearing elaborate uniforms and crazy hand-made medals" [...] to experiment with the designs of such a character. George later admitted to the similarities to Ayn Rand, although not intentional. George and Bong travelled to Swinton's home in Scotland with [...] "a couple of suitcases of clothes, wigs, glasses and teeth" [...] to play around with ideas.|$|E
2500|$|Phineas and Ferb is an American {{animated}} {{musical comedy}} television series. Originally broadcast as a one-episode preview on August 17, 2007 and again previewed on September 28, 2007, the series officially premiered on February 1, 2008 on Disney Channel, and follows Phineas Flynn and his British stepbrother Ferb Fletcher on summer vacation. Every day, the boys embark on some grand new project, which annoys their controlling sister, Candace, who frequently tries {{to reveal their}} shenanigans to her and Phineas' mother, Linda Flynn-Fletcher, and less frequently to Ferb's father, Lawrence Fletcher. The series follows a standard plot system; running gags occur every episode, and the b-plot almost always features Phineas and Ferb's pet platypus Perry the Platypus working as a spy (named [...] "Agent P") for OWCA (the Organization Without a Cool Acronym), to defeat the latest scheme of Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz, a mad scientist driven largely by a need to assert his evilness. Sometimes, other villains <b>scoff</b> <b>at</b> his level of evil. The two plots intersect at the end to erase all traces of the boys' project just before Candace can show it to their mother.

2500|$|... in 1985 {{a series}} of pieces were {{produced}} under the title The Bizarre Collection, with the mark for the [...] "Royal Staffordshire Pottery by Clarice Cliff", and marketed by the Midwinter pottery. These pieces were all hand painted, unlike some of the later production Wedgwood, and faithfully respected the original designs and production methods {{with the exception of}} the crocus conical sifter. The production actually took lace on the same premises as the original production line of the Newport pottery. [...] The 3 principal designs produced were Honolulu on a 12 inch Mei Ping vase, Summerhouse on a 13 inch [...] wall plate and a striking version of Umbrellas and Rain on a conical bowl. These pieces can be identified with a tiny impressed 85 for the year of manufacture. There was also a selection of 6 conical sugar sifters, again hand painted, {{with the exception of the}} aforementioned Crocus which was lithographed. Whilst the purists still <b>scoff</b> <b>at</b> these pieces some 30 years later they are actually a very accurate representation of the originals they were copied from and in themselves are now becoming sought after not least because they allow collectors to acquire excellent pieces and a more affordable price.|$|E
2500|$|There {{have been}} some {{positive}} reviews, however. One modern critic said [...] "the story is adequately paced, the acting is engaging, and we still get a thrill seeing the Army guys empty their cartridges at the unstoppable insects." [...] Another modern reviewer found the screenplay effective, especially the beginning: [...] "As in Deadly Mantis, the complete disappearance of the victims is especially chilling, as {{is the notion of}} 150 men, women and children being devoured overnight while in their beds. This aspect is like something out of Lovecraft, although it is not exploited as well as it could have been." [...] Producer-director Bert I. Gordon said he did not care whether reviews were bad; what mattered was whether people went to see the film: [...] "The movie audience these days consists almost entirely of teenagers. Either they're naïve and go to get scared, or they're sophisticated and enjoy scoffing at the pictures. There isn't much a teenager can <b>scoff</b> <b>at</b> these days, you know." [...] Lead actor Peter Graves also felt the film worked on a certain level. [...] "I think they played OK. ... All of that was ludicrous, but there were a certain amount of people who 'bought' it and loved it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Kierkegaard also {{stresses}} the importance of the self, and the self's relation to the world, as being grounded in self-reflection and introspection. He argued in Concluding Unscientific Postscript to Philosophical Fragments that [...] "subjectivity is truth" [...] and [...] "truth is subjectivity." [...] This {{has to do with a}} distinction between what is objectively true and an individual's subjective relation (such as indifference or commitment) to that truth. People who in some sense believe the same things may relate to those beliefs quite differently. Two individuals may both believe that many of those around them are poor and deserve help, but this knowledge may lead only one of them to decide to actually help the poor. This is how Kierkegaard put it: [...] "What a priceless invention statistics are, what a glorious fruit of culture, what a characteristic counterpart to the de te narratur fabula [...] of antiquity. Schleiermacher so enthusiastically declares that knowledge does not perturb religiousness, and that the religious person does not sit safeguarded by a lightning rod and <b>scoff</b> <b>at</b> God; yet with the help of statistical tables one laughs at all of life." [...] In other words, Kierkegaard says: [...] "Who has the more difficult task: the teacher who lectures on earnest things a meteor's distance from everyday life – or the learner who should put it to use?" [...] This is how it was summed up in 1940.|$|E
