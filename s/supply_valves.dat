50|$|A wet-pipe {{sprinkler}} system is an automatic {{sprinkler system}} in which the <b>supply</b> <b>valves</b> are open and the system is charged with water under supply pressure at all times. For this reason, they are the quickest at getting water on the fire and are the simplest to maintain. Wet pipe systems are installed where indoor temperatures can he maintained at or above 40 degrees Fahrenheit. Below that temperature, there is the danger of freezing pipes. If the outside temperature is below freezing and the interior temperature is less than forty degrees Fahrenheit, the steel sprinkler piping, which rapidly conducts heat and rapidly loses it, will drop below freezing. The frozen area may be isolated and near an opening or uninsulated portion of the building. It may be a small area, but it could be enough to put the whole system out of service.|$|E

50|$|In {{plants with}} {{remote-controlled}} process operation, {{such as oil}} refineries and petrochemical plants, some 2-way valves can be designated as normally closed (NC) or normally open (NO) during regular operation. Examples of normally-closed valves are sampling valves, which are only opened while a sample is taken. Other examples of normally-closed valves are emergency shut-down valves, which are kept open when the system is in operation and will automatically shut by taking away the power supply. This happens {{when there is a}} problem with a unit or a section of a fluid system such as a leak in order to isolate the problem from the rest of the system. Examples of normally-open valves are purge-gas <b>supply</b> <b>valves</b> or emergency-relief valves. When there is a problem these valves open (by switching them 'off') causing the unit to be flushed and emptied.|$|E
50|$|Fin brakes {{involve a}} metal fin being {{attached}} to the underside of a train. The track is fitted with two computer-controlled squeezing mechanisms which upon closing, squeeze the fin and either slow or stop the train. Fin brakes {{are the most common}} form of brakes on roller coasters today. Sometimes they are thick metal box beams (mostly on Bolliger & Mabillard roller coasters); others are thin metal plates. They slide between pairs of friction pads similar to automotive brake pads. Fin brakes are designed to be fail-safe, so that a loss of power will cause them to engage. Brakes are constructed according to a certain measure of redundancy, meaning the ride is usually fitted with one extra set of brakes to bring the train to a hold even if one brake fails. Opening is done by a bellows type of air-operated actuator. Each set of brakes is fitted with its own air supply system controlled by <b>supply</b> <b>valves</b> which open the brake when it is safe to do so. A heavy spring, usually made of steel, is used to hold the brake closed by default.|$|E
50|$|During the Second {{world war}} Odessa city was {{surrounded}} by German and Romanian troops in 1941, {{and it was the}} hottest and driest period in July and August. Due to water supply system from the river, which was far from Odessa, was opened in 1973 in the Odessa city center and the system reached Moldavanka District later in 1980-1990s, the old city water supply system, including underground tanks and one-stage houses with shed roofs, was destroyed. Three and more stegs houses were built in Odessa from the end of 1890-s mostly and their roofs did not permit collection of enough rain water for the inhabitants. As result, thirst of water came in Odessa in August 1941, during the siege. The Soviet Marines were landed on German-occupied territory at water supply station between Odessa and river to give water for Odessa citizens during some hours only. Odessa citizens were informed in appropriate time to stand by at water <b>supply</b> <b>valves,</b> as the Soviet military chiefs were confident of a positive result of the military operation to supply the city with water for a few hours only. Water supply was arranged by Soviet Mariners and the most of them was killed during the battle at the water supply station.|$|E

50|$|Another {{option for}} the surface {{supplied}} diver is to breathe air supplied through the pneumofathometer hose of the umbilical. The diver inserts the hose into the air space of the helmet of full face mask, and the panel operator opens the <b>supply</b> <b>valve</b> sufficiently to provide enough air to breathe on free flow. Pneumo air can be supplied to another diver by a rescuer in the surface supply equivalent of Octopus air sharing. This procedure would save the bailout gas which would then be available if the situation deteriorates further. Pneumo breathing air supply is not applicable to environmentally sealed suits for contaminated environments.|$|R
40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was conducted in}} a greenhouse at the Department of Biological Sciences, University of Zimbabwe to test the use of various plant water status indicators {{for use in the}} irrigation scheduling and water stress detection of a greenhouse tomato crop. These indicators included midday leaf water potential (LWPmidday), leaf temperature, stem diameter, fruit diameter, stomatal resistance and sap flow. Two replicated treatments were used for the experiment namely a well watered treatment in which plants were always given sufficient water (â€˜sufficientâ€™ being based on calculations of water requirements made using the FAO-Penman-Monteith equation), and a drought stressed treatment in which plants were periodically subjected to drought stress by turning off their water <b>supply</b> <b>valves</b> for a number of days. The procedure was to monitor the variation of these indicators with time for the 60 days of the experiment in both treatments (and their replicates) and correlate these indicators to plant water requirements calculated using the FAO-Penman-Monteith equation. Also twice during the 60 day period of the experiment the drought stressed treatment (and its replicate) were subjected to the drought stress mentioned earlier and the physiological responses noted. In terms of determining irrigation quantity, sap flow and daily mean leaf temperature showed the highest correlations with ETo (R 2 = 0. 64), these were followed by daily maximum leaf temperature and maximum daily stem shrinkage (MDS) with R 2 values of 0. 454 and 0. 401, respectively. Daily fruit growth was a distant fifth (R 2 = 0. 221) with stomatal resistance and leaf water potential being found to have no value in determining irrigation quantity of greenhouse grown tomatoes in this case. In terms of stress detection and irrigation timing, LWPmidday showed the best and quickest response (â‰ˆ 2 days) with sap flow (â‰ˆ 3 days) and leaf to air temperature difference (â‰ˆ 4 days) being second and third, respectively. For LWPmidday it was possible to define a threshold of â‰¤- 1600 kPa while for leaf temperature a threshold for leaf-air temperature difference between the time of 3 : 00 pm and 4 : 45 pm of â‰¥- 2 Â°C was determined at which point plants require water urgently. Stem diameter fluctuations and fruit growth showed some value in terms of monitoring growth rates in a commercial setting. However, they had little value in drought stress detection mainly because of the difficulty in coming up with defined thresholds at which water stress is said to be occurring. Stomatal resistance showed good response to drought stress but suffers due to its reliance on other environmental parameters. However, it was found that stomatal resistance is higher in water stressed plants, and in severely stressed plants will increase with increasing solar radiation; possibly as a defense mechanism to reduce transpiration. LWPmidday showed promise for future research on irrigation scheduling and stress detection. However, the need for commercially operational and possibly automated systems points to the use of sap flow, leaf temperature and MDS in irrigation scheduling and stress detection of greenhouse crops. Future experiments or operational tests should include an experimental phase for data collection followed by a validation phase in which the indicators and the results obtained from them are used in operational automated systems and compared against each other...|$|E

50|$|Operation {{required}} several valves; {{when the}} reservoir was empty {{at the start}} of a cycle a valve was opened to admit steam. The valve was closed to seal the reservoir and the cooling water valve turned on to condense the steam and create a partial vacuum. A <b>supply</b> <b>valve</b> was opened, pulling water upward into the reservoir, and the typical engine could pull water up to 20 feet. This was closed and the steam valve reopened, building pressure over the water and pumping it upward, as in the Worcester design. The cycle essentially doubled the distance that water could be pumped for any given pressure of steam, and production examples raised water about 40 feet.|$|R

25|$|In constant-flow {{regulators}} {{the first}} stage is a pressure regulator providing a constant reduced pressure, and the second stage is a plain on/off valve. These are the earliest type of breathing set flow control. The diver must open and close the <b>supply</b> <b>valve</b> to regulate flow.

Before 1939, diving and industrial open circuit breathing sets with constant-flow regulators were designed by Le Prieur, but did not get into general use due to very short dive duration. Design complications resulted from the need to put the second-stage flow control valve where it could be easily operated by the diver.|$|R
