5|$|Among some Betsimisaraka it is {{considered}} fady for a brother {{to shake hands with}} his <b>sister,</b> <b>or</b> for young men to wear shoes during their father's lifetime. Among many Betsimisaraka, the eel {{is considered}} sacred. It is forbidden to touch, fish or eat eel. Although many coastal Malagasy communities have a fady against the consumption of pork, this is not universal or common among the Betsimisaraka, who often keep pigs in their villages.|$|E

5|$|The game's {{story and}} its ending have been open to much interpretation; the ending was {{purposely}} left vague and unanswered by Playdead. It {{was compared to}} other open-ended books, films and video games, where the viewer is left to interpret what they have read or seen. Some reviews suggested that the game is {{a representation of the}} religious nature of Limbo or purgatory, as the boy character completes the journey only to end at the same place he started, repeating the same journey when the player starts a new game. Another interpretation suggested the game is the boy's journey through Hell to reach Heaven, or to find closure for his sister's death. Another theory considers that either the boy or his <b>sister</b> <b>or</b> both are dead. Some theories attempted to incorporate details from the game, such as the change in setting as the boy travels through the game suggesting the progression of man from child to adult to elder, or the similarities and differences between the final screen of the game where the boy meets a girl and the main menu where what could be human remains stand in their places.|$|E

25|$|Mary, {{the wife}} of Clopas, is named only once in the New Testament, in , where she is listed as one of four women {{standing}} by the Cross, the others being Mary the mother of Jesus, her <b>sister</b> (<b>or</b> perhaps cousin, the Aramaic words being the same), and Mary Magdalene. An alternative reading is that the list is of only three women, and that Mary of Clopas is also the <b>sister</b> (<b>or</b> cousin) of Mary the mother of Jesus, as some traditions maintain. The passage could also be interpreted to mean that Mary of Clopas is Clopas' daughter, rather than his wife, {{but this is not}} the general view.|$|E
25|$|Rotterdam has {{city and}} port {{connections}} throughout the world. In 2008, {{the city had}} 13 sister cities, 12 partner cities, and 4 sister ports.

25|$|James Tabor {{suggests}} that Mary of Clopas {{is the same}} person as Mary the mother of Jesus, and that Clopas is her second husband, Joseph having died. This reading of John 19:25 then also shortens the list there to three: This Mary, her <b>sister</b> (<b>or</b> cousin), and Mary Magdalene. This view is controversial.|$|E

25|$|The deification of {{deceased}} emperors had {{precedent in}} Roman domestic cult to the dii parentes (deified ancestors) and the mythic apotheosis of Rome's founders. A deceased emperor granted apotheosis by his successor and the Senate became an official State divus (divinity). Members of the Imperial family could be granted similar honours and cult; an Emperor's deceased wife, <b>sister</b> <b>or</b> daughter could be promoted to diva (female divinity).|$|E

25|$|Her rites allowed {{women the}} use of strong wine and blood-sacrifice, things {{otherwise}} forbidden them by Roman tradition. Men were barred from her mysteries and the possession of her true name. Given that male authors had limited knowledge of her rites and attributes, ancient speculations about her identity abound, among them {{that she was an}} aspect of Terra, Ops, Cybele, or Ceres, or a Latin form of the Greek goddess Damia. Most often, she was identified as the wife, <b>sister,</b> <b>or</b> daughter of the god Faunus, thus an equivalent or aspect of the nature-goddess Fauna, who could prophesy the fates of women.|$|E
25|$|What most sources agree upon is that Niguma {{was born}} into a rich Brahmin family in the town (or monastery) of Peme in Kashmir in the 10th or 11th century. Her father was named Santivarman (Tib.: Zhi ba’i go cha) and her mother was called Shrimati (Tib.: dPal gyi blo gros ma). According to {{different}} sources, Niguma was either the <b>sister</b> <b>or</b> consort of Naropa. Her family relationship with Naropa is not entirely clear from the existing sources. One scholar who has done extensive research presents and discusses the available evidence and concludes that Niguma was indeed Naropa's older sister, not his wife or consort.|$|E
25|$|Cheek kissing in the Arab {{world is}} {{relatively}} common, between friends and relatives. Cheek kissing between males is very common. However, cheek kissing between {{a male and}} female is usually considered inappropriate, unless within the same family; e.g. brother and <b>sister,</b> <b>or</b> if they are a married couple. Some exceptions to this are liberal areas within cities {{in some of the}} more liberal Arab countries such as Lebanon, Syria, Jordan and Tunisia, where cheek kissing is a common greeting between unrelated males and females in most communities. The Lebanese custom has become the norm for non-Lebanese in Lebanese-dominated communities of the Arab diaspora. Normally in Lebanon, the typical number of kisses is three: one on the left cheek, then right, and then left between relatives. In other countries, it is typically two kisses with one on each cheek.|$|E

25|$|Tharavadu is {{a system}} of joint family practised by Malayalis, {{especially}} castes Nairs, Ezhava, Thiyyas and other prominent religious groups. Each Tharavadu has a unique name. The Tharavadu was administered by the Karanavar, the oldest male member of the family. He would be the eldest maternal uncle of the family as well. The members of the Tharavadu consisted of mother, daughters, sons, sisters and brothers. The fathers and husbands had very minimal {{role to play in}} the affairs of the Tharavadu. It was a true matrilineal affair. The Karanavar took all major decisions. He was usually autocratic. However, the consent of the eldest female member of the family was taken before implementing the decisions. This eldest female member would be his maternal grandmother, own mother, mother's sister, his own <b>sister</b> <b>or</b> a sister through his maternal lineage. Since the lineage was through the female members, the birth of a daughter was always welcomed. Each Tharavadu also has a Para Devatha (clan deity) revered by those in the particular Tharavadu. Temples were built to honor these deities.|$|E
25|$|The Hero {{learns that}} Jack of Blades himself {{destroyed}} Oakvale during the Hero's childhood; aided by Theresa, the Hero discovers his mother alive in Bargate Prison. The Hero is {{captured in the}} rescue attempt and spends {{a year or more}} in the prison before finally escaping. Maze is revealed to be a traitor and working with Jack. Maze kidnaps Theresa. After defeating Maze, the Hero is led into a final confrontation with Jack where his mother is killed. Jack reveals that The Sword of Aeons can only be wielded if it receives the blood of Archon. The Sword of Aeons {{is said to be a}} very powerful sword of destruction. Upon the death of their mother, the Hero and Theresa are the only two remaining descendants of Archon, and if Jack destroys them both the sword will be even more powerful. After defeating Jack, the Hero must choose whether to keep the Sword of Aeons by killing his <b>sister,</b> <b>or</b> cast it away forever into a portal created by Jack of Blades' death.|$|E
