5|$|On July 26, Valencia hit a {{grand slam}} off reigning AL Cy Young winner Zack Greinke to record his first big league homer. The feat {{marked the first time}} in the 49 years of Twins {{franchise}} history that a player's first Major League home run was a grand <b>slam.</b> <b>The</b> game was also his first four-hit performance. The next day, Valencia became the first Twins rookie to have back-to-back games with four hits apiece.|$|E
5|$|After {{starting}} off the Canadian Open of Curling with a 4–1 win-loss record, Martin dropped his quarterfinals game against Brad Gushue {{in the final}} end of the game. Martin also posted a strong start at the next Grand <b>Slam,</b> <b>The</b> National, but lost to Glenn Howard in the quarterfinals. On April 18, 2014, amidst rumours of his front end, Marc Kennedy and Ben Hebert, joining provincial rival Kevin Koe in the next season, Martin announced his retirement from curling following {{the conclusion of the}} 2014 Players' Championship. At the last tournament of his career, Martin posted a 3–2 win-loss record in the round robin, and advanced to the playoffs. He edged John Epping and Mike McEwen en route to the final, where he recorded a 4–3 win over Brad Jacobs while curling at 98%. He capped his career with an eighteenth Grand Slam title, his eighth at the Players' Championship.|$|E
5|$|In 1991 France met eternal arch-rivals England in the quarterfinal at Parc des Princes. Earlier in {{the year}} at Twickenham the two sides had played off for the Five Nations Grand <b>Slam.</b> <b>The</b> French scored three {{magnificent}} tries but were denied by the fearsome English forward pack. In a very tense and brutally physical match, the scores were tied at 10-all when the French were awarded a scrum five metres out from the tryline. French number eight Marc Cecillon looked set to score the try that would have won the game for the French. Suddenly he was hit and driven back in a tackle from opponent Mick Skinner, a tackle which changed {{the momentum of the}} match. England went on to win 19–10 and eventually reached the Final. At the end of the match, France coach Daniel Dubroca angrily assaulted New Zealand referee David Bishop in the players tunnel. He resigned soon afterwards.|$|E

5|$|Murray {{entered the}} Paris Masters knowing {{that in the}} event of Djokovic not {{reaching}} the final, winning the title would be enough to see him crowned world No. 1 for the first time. After reaching the quarterfinals, courtesy of wins over Fernando Verdasco and Lucas Pouille, Murray faced Berdych for a place in the semifinals, winning in straight sets. Meanwhile, Djokovic lost to Marin Cilic, meaning that Murray would replace Djokovic {{at the top of the}} rankings should he reach the final. He was due to face Milos Raonic in the semifinals. However, Raonic withdrew prior to the start of the match, giving Murray a walkover. As a result, Murray became the first British man to reach world No. 1 since the introduction of the rankings in 1973. Murray then defeated John Isner in the final in 3 sets to win his fourth consecutive tournament and first Paris Masters title. In November 2016, Murray reached the final of the ATP World Tour Finals for the first time before winning against Novak Djokovic in two sets, thus reaching year-end No.1 and in doing so, becoming the first player to win a Grand <b>Slam,</b> <b>the</b> ATP World Tour Finals, the men's singles at the Olympic Games and a Masters 1000 titles in the same calendar year. The International Tennis Federation recognised Murray as their men's 2016 ITF men's world champion, the first time Murray has achieved this honour.|$|E
5|$|The {{main event}} was between A.J. Styles and Abyss, {{in which the}} winner {{received}} an NWA World Heavyweight Championship match at Hard Justice. Its duration was 18 minutes even. The match began on the outside as Styles performed a front-flip onto Abyss, who {{was standing in the}} doorway of the cage. Later, as Styles was about to enter the cage, Abyss slammed the door twice into Styles, while the second door <b>slam</b> <b>the</b> second hit him in the face and caused him to crash to the floor and to bleed from the forehead. During the contest, Abyss used a steel chain as a weapon to help open up Styles' wound more. At one point, Abyss opened a bag and poured a large number of thumbtacks onto the mat, then proceeding to try to slam Styles into them. Styles countered and slammed Abyss face-first into the tacks instead with his signature maneuver, the Styles Clash. Near the end of the contest, Styles climbed the steel cage and stood on the top, but Abyss grabbed and threw the referee into the cage wall, causing Styles to fall and barely hang on. Abyss then followed by climbing the cage and by hanging Styles by the neck for a brief time with the steel chain. Then, Styles performed a sunset flip powerbomb and slammed Abyss into the tacks back-first. He followed by covering for the three count, winning of the encounter and earning his future title match.|$|E
5|$|The Phillies {{continued}} to Atlanta, where they took {{two of three}} from the Braves, with Kendrick's second win and Lidge's 30th save {{in the first game}} of the series. Martínez was outdueled by Javier Vázquez in the second game of the series, but the Phillies avoided a loss by defeating the Braves, 4–2, on September 20. A doubleheader followed against the Marlins; the Phillies won game one, while the Marlins won game two. In the rubber game, Lidge blew his 11th save after a rain delay to give the Marlins a series victory, keeping the team's number to clinch the division at five. The Phillies and the Brewers split the next series at two games each, with Philadelphia winning the first and last game of the series. The Phillies returned to Citizens Bank Park for their final homestand to close out the season, opening with a fifth consecutive loss to the Astros. However, the Phillies broke the streak with a 7–4 win on September 29, thanks to a Feliz grand <b>slam.</b> <b>The</b> following night, the Phillies clinched their third consecutive division title with a 10–3 win over Houston, guaranteeing a split in the series and a playoff berth, and tying the franchise record for consecutive division titles set by Danny Ozark's teams from 1976 to 1978. After the clinching game, the Phillies rested most of their regular starters, six of whom had started over 150 games during the season; they lost four straight games while the regulars regained their strength, but won the final game of the season in extra innings as Paul Hoover hit a walk-off single in the bottom of the 10th inning. The Phillies finished with a record of 93 wins and 69 losses, one game better than their record in the previous season.|$|E

5|$|The Phillies' offense {{benefited from}} rest {{due to the}} {{postponement}} of {{the final game of}} the Padres' series, as they defeated the Milwaukee Brewers in the opener of their mid-week series, 11–4. The next two games did not go as smoothly, as the Phillies were shut out through eight innings in the second game and nearly no-hit by Brewers starter Dave Bush in the third game. Phillies starter Cole Hamels was hit by a line drive in the fourth inning and exited the game; before departing, he had retired nine out of the ten batters he faced. Hitting the road for a series against the division-leading Florida Marlins, the Phillies were shut out through eight innings in {{the first game of the}} series, only to score seven runs in the top of the ninth against power-throwing closer Matt Lindstrom, winning the game, 7–3, thanks to Shane Victorino's first career regular season grand <b>slam.</b> <b>The</b> following night's game offered another come-from-behind win for the Phillies, as they trailed in the ninth again to win in extra innings, 6–4, and the 13–2 victory on April 26 capped the team's first series sweep. Hosting Washington for their second series against the Nationals, the Phillies fell behind in the seventh inning before a grand slam by Ibáñez capped their 13–11 victory; combined with Ryan Howard's game-tying grand slam in the fifth inning, this was only the fourth time in Phillies history that teammates hit grand slams in the same game. The Phillies split the remaining two games of the series with Washington, finishing with an April record of 11–9, their second consecutive winning April.|$|E

Earlier the stroke or technique did not exist in a field hockey player's repertoire or in the game's coaching manual.|$|E
25|$|The {{incomplete}} 2001 Six Nations Championship {{was concluded}} in October, with England playing Ireland. England lost 20–14 at Lansdowne Road. Both Ireland and England had won {{four out of}} the five Six Nations fixtures, but England's superior points difference ensured they clinched the title although, {{for the second year}} running, not the Grand Slam. In a match against Australia for the Cook Cup in November, Wilkinson scored all of England's points in their 21–15 victory at Twickenham. After being rested as an unused bench replacement in the subsequent match against Romania, he then played a large role in a win over the Springboks, in which he kicked seven penalty goals in the 29–9 victory. Going for a third Six Nations title in a row, England got {{off to a good start}} in their 2002 Six Nations Championship with wins over Scotland and Ireland, before losing to France at the Stade de France. England won their remaining fixtures against Wales and Italy but France went on to complete a Grand <b>Slam.</b> <b>The</b> Falcons were in Pool6 in the 2001–02 Heineken Cup, and won one match, finishing fourth in the pool.|$|E

25|$|The Brewers {{returned}} to interleague play in Cleveland, where they swept the Cleveland Indians in a high-scoring series {{that included a}} six-run rally {{in the eighth inning}} on June 15, capped by Prince Fielder's first career grand slam, and an 11-inning win on June 17 that mooted a four-run comeback by the Indians in the ninth inning, giving Hoffman his first blown save of the season. The team's interleague woes returned for the remaining two interleague series, however, as the Brewers were swept in Detroit and dropped two of three against the Twins at Miller Park. The Twins series included the first start by a Brewers pitcher not in the opening day rotation, as Mike Burns made his first career start, replacing the injured Dave Bush. Milwaukee's fortunes improved with a return to National League play, as the team closed out June with series wins at home against San Francisco and the New York Mets. On June 27, Seth McClung made his first start of the year as Manny Parra's replacement in the pitching rotation (due to off days, a fifth starter had not been needed since Parra's June 13 demotion). On June 30, Burns collected his first career win in a game which also included Casey McGehee's first career grand <b>slam.</b> <b>The</b> Brewers ended June with a 12–15 record for the month, but nonetheless held a one-game lead over the St. Louis Cardinals for the division lead.|$|E
25|$|The No.18 Kentucky Wildcats {{baseball}} team came to Baum Stadium for a three game series, starting April 2. In game one, Braden Kapteyn of Kentucky hit a two-run {{home run in}} the first inning, and the Wildcats went on to win 12–8. Mike Bolsinger lasted only 2⅓ innings, and the Hogs' seven-game winning streak came to an end. Arkansas would collect seventeen hits in game two, with Drew Smyly pitching seven innings of one-run baseball, as the Razorbacks won 10–1. Collin Kuhn, Zack Cox, Brett Eibner, Tim Carver and James McCann all had multiple hits in game two. Andy Wilkins would leave the game due to a hamstring injury. Game three, played on Easter Sunday, began with the Wildcats jumping out to five-run lead to start the game. In the bottom of the second, Razorbacks catcher James McCann powered a three-run homer over the fence, and coupled with some Kentucky miscues, the Razorbacks took an 8–5 lead. The UK offense would strike again for seven runs in the seventh off of Razorback reliever DJ Baxendale to make it 16–13 Wildcat lead. In the ninth, Jarrod McKinney drew a walk, followed by a McCann singe and Andy Wilkins pinch-hit walk. Collin Kuhn was due up, and with two outs and two strikes, Kuhn took the pitch from Matt Little over the left field fence for a walk-off grand <b>slam.</b> <b>The</b> 17–16 final capped a very offensive weekend for the Hogs, including 35 runs and 48 hits.|$|E
