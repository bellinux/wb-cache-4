The objectives of this study were to characterize the effect of hydrophilic (aerosil 200) and hydrophobic (aerosil R 972) colloidal silicon dioxide on physical properties of eudragit gels which N-methyl-pyrrolidone was employed as dispersing medium. The samples were investigated in terms of viscosity, rheology and <b>syringeability.</b> The results indicated that the aerosil 200 and aerosil R 972 amount influenced the viscosity, rheology and <b>syringeability</b> of the prepared gels. Viscosity and <b>syringeability</b> of the systems were increased with an increased amount of both aerosils. However, the viscosity and <b>syringeability</b> of the prepared gels containing aerosil 200 were increased higher than that of systems containing aerosil R 972. The rheological behaviors of all systems consisting aerosil 200 and R 972 were non-Newtonian flow. These studies demonstrated that aerosil 200 and R 972 could improve the physical properties of eudragit gels dispersed in N-methyl-pyrrolidone...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, mucoadhesive in-situ gel with {{poloxamer}} and hydroxypropylmethylcellulose {{formulations of}} itraconazole {{were prepared for}} vaginal application. In addition, rheological, mechanical and mucoadhesive properties and <b>syringeability</b> of the formulations were characterized. The mixtures of Poloxamer 407 and 188 with {{two different types of}} hydroxypropylmethylcellulose were used as polymers for gel formulations. Flow rheometry studies and oscillatory analysis of each formulation were performed at 20 ℃ ± 0. 1 ℃ and 37 ℃ ± 0. 1 ℃. All formulations exhibited pseudo-plastic flow and typical gel-type mechanical spectra (G′ > G″) after the determined frequency value at 37 ℃. Texture profile analysis presented that F 3 formulation containing 20 % poloxamer 407, 10 % poloxamer 188 and 0. 5 % hydroxypropylmethylcellulose appeared to offer more suitable mechanical and mucoadhesive performance. Using different hydroxypropylmethylcellulose type in formulations didn’t significantly change <b>syringeability</b> values. The evaluation of the entire candidate formulations indicated that vaginal formulation of itraconazole will be an alternative for the treatment of vaginal candidiasis with suitable textural and rheological properties.

40|$|Aim: The aim of {{this study}} to develop the {{controlled}} delivery of combination drug(s) to periodontal pocket. Materials and Methods: In the present investigation mucoadhesive gel formulations were prepared using carboxy methylcellulose (CMC), methylcellulose (MC), hydroxyethylcellulose (HEC), polyvinylpirrolidone (PVP), polycarbophil (PC), and poloxamer. Each formulation was characterized in terms of polarizing light microscopy, gelation, gel melting, hardness, compressibility, adhesiveness, cohesiveness, <b>syringeability,</b> adhesion to a mucin disk, rheological studies, drug release, and antibacterial activities. Addition of CMC and PVP to the gel favored hexagonal phase formation. The gelation temperature was decreased linearly with an increasing concentration of drug(s), whereas, the melting temperature increased with the concentration of drug(s). Increasing the concentrations of each polymeric component significantly increased formulation hardness, compressibility, adhesiveness, mucoadhesion, and <b>syringeability,</b> yet a decreased cohesiveness. Increased time of contact between the formulation and mucin significantly increased the required force of detachment. Drug release from all formulations was non-diffusion controlled and significantly decreased as the concentration of the polymer was increased, due to the concomitant increased viscosity of the formulations and the swelling kinetics of PC, following contact with the dissolution fluid. Result: Antibacterial studies revealed that a gel with 30 &#x 0025; HEC had a growth inhibition zone on agar with all three strains. Conclusion: Formulations containing HEC exhibited superior physical characteristics for improved drug delivery to the periodontal pocket and are now the subject of long-term clinical investigations...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In situ forming gel {{with solvent}} {{exchange}} mechanism {{is one of}} drug delivery systems for periodontitis treatment. The system is injected into the desired site then transforms into a gel state when the solvent diffuses out and aqueous diffuses in. The in situ forming Eudragit RS gels loading 1, 5 and 10 %w/w metronidazole (MT) were developed in this study using N-methyl pyrrolidone (NMP), 2 -pyrrolidone and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as solvent. The viscosity of the gel systems in all solvents were increased as drug or polymer amount was increased with Newtonian flow behavior. Transformation into gel was evident after initiated the systems in phosphate buffer pH 6. 8. NMP systems exhibited the lowest work of <b>syringeability</b> through 18 G syringe. Drug release from dialysis tube of DMSO systems was slower than that of NMP and 2 -pyrrolidone systems, respectively. Antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus of the systems comprising MT using NMP as solvent was greater than that using 2 -pyrrolidone and DMSO, respectively, which the antimicrobial activity was increased as the drug amount was increased. Therefore, the solvent type affected the viscosity, gel formation, <b>syringeability,</b> drug release and antimicrobial activity of Eudragit RS systems. These developed systems sustained the drug release and inhibited the bacterial growth hence they were interesting systems for periodontitis treatment...|$|E
40|$|Inflammatory {{osteoarthritis}} (OA) {{is characterized}} by painful and destructive inflammatory flares of a single joint, mainly in the back, the knees, the wrists or the hips. Monoarthritis is generally treated by intraarticular (IA) injections of corticosteroids or hyaluronic acid (HA). However, due to their toxicity, the chronic use of corticosteroids should be avoided. The aim of this work {{was to develop a}} new slow-release formulation for a parenteral route of administration (e. g. IA). The development's strategy was based on the use of amphiphilic ingredients such as glyceryl monooleate (GMO), which is able to generate viscous crystalline phase structures upon contact with an aqueous fluid (e. g. synovial fluid) to sustain the drug activity over weeks. Clonidine (CLO) was suggested as a small and hydrophilic model drug and HA as a hydrophilic viscoelastic scaffold. Thermal analyses showed that the stability of GMO, HA, and CLO in mixtures with a ratio of 1 : 1 (wt/wt) was not affected in comparison with the raw materials. In order to obtain a formulation presenting suitable <b>syringeability</b> and containing GMO, CLO, and HA, two elements were found to be essential: a minimum of about 15 % (wt/wt) water content and the use of co-solvents such as ethanol (ET) and propylene glycol (PG), approved by the FDA for parenteral use. Several developed gels presented pseudoplastic flow behavior. Moreover, the best composition provided an in vitro release of CLO for about 1 week that was similar to a cubic reference formulation, described by many authors as presenting poor <b>syringeability</b> but the best sustained-release capacity.

40|$|To {{characterize}} the thermal behavior and texture analysis of doxycycline hyclate thermosensitive gels developed for periodontitis treatment containing zinc oxide prepared by using poloxamer (Lutrol ® F 127) as polymeric material and N-methyl pyrrolidone {{was used as}} cosolvent. The thermosensitive gel comprising doxycycline hyclate, Lutrol® F 127, and N-methyl pyrrolidone were characterized for the thermal behavior and texture analysis. The topography of the system after the dissolution test was characterized with scanning electron microscope. Differential scanning calorimetric thermogram exhibited the endothermic peaks in the systems containing high amount of N-methyl pyrrolidone in solvent. The sol-gel transition temperature of the systems decreased as the zinc oxide amount was increased. The addition of doxycycline hyclate, zinc oxide, and N-methyl pyrrolidone affected the <b>syringeability</b> of systems. The addition of zinc oxide into the doxycycline hyclate-Lutrol ® F 127 systems decreased the diameter of inhibition zone against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Candida albicans since zinc oxide decreased the diffusion and prolonged release of doxycycline hyclate. From scanning electron microscope analysis, the porous surface of 20 % w/w Lutrol® F 127 system was notably {{different from that of}} gel comprising doxycycline hyclate which had interconnected pores and smooth surfaces. The number of pores was decreased with increasing zinc oxide and the porous structure was smaller and more compact. Therefore, the addition of zinc oxide could increase the <b>syringeability</b> of doxycycline hyclate-Lutrol® F 127 system with the temperature dependence. Zinc oxide decreased inhibition zone against test microbes because of prolongation of doxycycline hyclate release and reduced size of continuous cells. Furthermore, zinc oxide also increased the compactness of wall surfaces of Lutrol® F 127...|$|E
40|$|Background: Periodontitis is {{a disease}} of tooth {{supporting}} tissues, and Gram-negative Bacteria are {{the main cause of}} this. Propolis has antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant effects due to its high polyphenol and flavonoids content. The aim of this study is the formulation of a mucoadhesive gel containing concentrated extract of propolis for treatment of periodontitis. Materials and Methods: Formulations containing carbopol 940, sodium carboxymethylcellulose (NaCMC), hydroxypropyl methylcellulose K 4 M, and propolis extract were prepared. Among ten prepared formulations, five formulations had acceptable and proper physical appearance and uniformity; thus, they were selected for physicochemical tests (centrifugal, thermal change, cooling and heating, freeze and thaw, thermal stress, and pH evaluation), quantification of flavonoids, viscosity, mucoadhesion, drug release, and <b>syringeability</b> tests. We investigated the antibacterial activity of F 10 (carbopol 940 1 %, NaCMC 3 %) against Porphyromonas gingivalis using the disk diffusion method. Results: Phenolic content was measured 39. 02 ± 3. 24 mg/g of concentrated extract as gallic acid and flavonoid content was determined 743. 28 ± 12. 1 mg/g of concentrated extract as quercetin. Highest viscosity (3700 cps) and mucoadhesion (21 MPa) were seen in F 10. Study of release profile in F 10 also revealed that propolis could release from this system in more than 7 days. All of the five selected formulations had ease of <b>syringeability</b> in 21 -gauge needle for drug delivery into periodontal pocket. In the disk diffusion method, F 10 produced significant growth inhibition zones against P. gingivalis. Conclusion: Controlled release of drug into periodontal pocket helps effective treatment and recovery, higher persistence and reduces drug use frequency. Increase of carbopol 940 leads to viscosity and mucoadhesion elevation and accordingly decreases of release rate. F 10 was the best formulation because of highest viscosity and mucoadhesion and lowest release rate.

For this aim, different types of chitosan with different molecular massess and viscosity properties [low molecular mass chitosan (viscosity: 20. 000 mPa s), medium molecular mass chitosan (viscosity: 200. 000 mPa s), high molecular mass chitosan (viscosity: 800. 000 mPa s) ] have been used.

The release profiles of econazole nitrate and miconazole nitrate from chitosan gels were obtained and evaluated kinetically. In addition, anticandidal activities of formulations were determined. Finally, vaginal retention of chitosan gels in rats was evaluated with in vivo distribution studies. Based on the results, it can be concluded that gels prepared with medium molecular mass chitosan might be effectively used for different antifungal agents for the treatment of vaginal candidiosis as it has high mucoadhesiveness, suitable mechanical and release properties with good retention in vagina...|$|E
40|$|Aqueous {{semi-solid}} polymeric gels, such {{as those}} based on hydroxyethylcellulose (HEC) and polyacrylic acid (e. g. Carbopol®), {{have a long history}} of use in vaginal drug delivery. However, despite their ubiquity, they often provide sub-optimal clinical performance, due to poor mucosal retention and limited solubility for poorly water-soluble actives. These issues are particularly pertinent for vaginal HIV microbicides, since many lead candidates are poorly water-soluble and where a major goal is the development of a coitally independent, once daily gel product. In this study, we report the use of a non-aqueous silicone elastomer gel for vaginal delivery of the HIV- 1 entry inhibitor maraviroc. In vitro rheological, <b>syringeability</b> and retention studies demonstrated enhanced performance for silicone gels compared with a conventional aqueous HEC gel, while testing of the gels in the slug model confirmed a lack of mucosal irritancy. Pharmacokinetic studies following single dose vaginal administration of a maraviroc silicone gel in rhesus macaques showed higher and sustained MVC levels in vaginal fluid, vaginal tissue and plasma compared with a HEC gel containing the same maraviroc loading.

40|$|This {{study focused}} on {{developing}} in situ gel formulations of miconazole nitrate with poloxamer 188 and 407 for treatment of mucosal candidiasis. In situ gel formulations were prepared and gelation temperature, rheological, mechanical and mucoadhesive properties, <b>syringeability</b> and release profiles were evaluated. Based on their suitable gelation temperature properties, formulations containing the poloxamer (Plx) 407 and 188 in ratios of 15 : 15 (F 1), 15 : 20 (F 2) and 20 : 10 (F 3) were chosen for further studies. F 3 exhibited typical gel-type mechanical spectra at 37 °C whereas F 1 and F 2 behaved like weakly cross-linked gels.

We developed injectable formulations that form gels entrapping magnetic particles into a tumor. We used SPIONs embedded in silica microparticles to favor <b>syringeability</b> and incorporated the highest proportion possible to allow large heating capacities. Hydrogel, single-solvent organogel and cosolvent (low-toxicity hydrophilic solvent) organogel formulations were injected into human cancer tumors xenografted in mice. The thermoreversible hydrogels (poloxamer, chitosan), which accommodated 20 % w/v of the magnetic microparticles, proved to be inadequate. Alginate hydrogels, however, incorporated 10 % w/v of the magnetic microparticles, and the external gelation led to strong implants localizing to the tumor periphery, whereas internal gelation failed in situ. The organogel formulations, which consisted of precipitating polymers dissolved in single organic solvents, displayed various microstructures. A 8 % poly(ethylene-vinyl alcohol) in DMSO containing 40 % w/v of magnetic microparticles formed the most suitable implants in terms of tumor casting and heat delivery. Importantly, it is of great clinical interest to develop cosolvent formulations with up to 20 % w/v of magnetic microparticles that show reduced toxicity and centered tumor implantation...|$|E

Interactive, multicomponent, polymeric platforms were manufactured containing hydroxyethylcellulose (HEC, 5 % w/w) polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP, 4 % w/w), Pluronic (PL, 0 or 10 % w/w), and either polycarbophil (PC, 3 % w/w) or poly(methylvinylether-co-maleic anhydride) (Gantrez S 97, 3 % w/w) as a mucoadhesive agent. The rheological (torsional and dynamic), mechanical (com-pressional), and mucoadhesive properties were characterized and {{shown to be}} dependent upon the mucoadhesive agent used and the inclusion/exclusion of PL. The dynamic rheological properties of the gel platforms were also assessed following dilution with simulated vaginal fluid (to mimic in vivo dilution). RSVs containing PC were more rheologically structured than comparator formulations containing GAN. This trend was also reflected in formulation hardness, compressibility, consistency, and <b>syringeability.</b> Moreover, formulations containing PL (10 % w/w) were more rheologically structured than formulations devoid of PL. Dilution with simulated vaginal fluids significantly decreased rheological structure, although RSVs still retained a highly elastic structure (G ′> G′ ′ and tan δ < 1). Furthermore, RSVs exhibited sustained drug release properties that were shown to be dependent upon their rheological structure.

40|$|The {{biological}} and therapeutic responses to hyperthermia, {{when it is}} envisaged as an anti-tumor treatment modality, are complex and variable. Heat delivery plays a critical role and is counteracted by more or less efficient body cooling, which is largely mediated by blood flow. In the case of magnetically mediated modality, the delivery of the magnetic particles, most often superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs), is also critically involved. We focus here on the magnetic characterization of two injectable formulations able to gel in situ and entrap silica microparticles embedding SPIONs. These formulations have previously shown suitable <b>syringeability</b> and intratumoral distribution in vivo. The first formulation is based on alginate, and the second on a poly(ethylene-co-vinyl alcohol) (EVAL). Here we investigated the magnetic properties and heating capacities in an alternating magnetic field (141 kHz, 12 mT) for implants with increasing concentrations of magnetic microparticles. We found that the magnetic properties of the magnetic microparticles were preserved using the formulation and in the wet implant at 37 degrees C, as in vivo. Using two orthogonal methods, a common SLP (20 Wg(- 1)) was found after weighting by magnetic microparticle fraction, suggesting that both formulations are able to properly carry the magnetic microparticles in situ while preserving their magnetic properties and heating capacities.

40|$|Objective. Examine {{the ability}} of CCS to resist drug {{extraction}} from assorted solvents readily available and commonly used by recreational drug abusers. Background. Tampering with a medication from its original form {{for the purpose of}} intravenous abuse can heighten its effects compared to the oral route. To help deter this and other types of abuse, formulations resistant to tampering methods are greatly needed. CSS is a common tableting ingredient having ionic functional groups capable of interacting with cationic drugs. The ability of CCS to bind an abusable medication and reduce its aqueous extraction was therefore investigated. Tramadol HCl was chosen as the model drug. Methods. In glass vials, 200 mg of CCS was added to 10 mL of 2. 5 mg/mL tramadol HCl aqueous solutions prepared from 0. 1 N HCl, 0. 9 % NaCl, 40 % ethanol (EtOH), and hot water (near boiling). All samples were then vortexed, centrifuged, and the supernatant analyzed for drug concentration by UV-Visible Spectroscopy at 271 nm. Results. Almost 70 % of the drug dose was prevented from being extracted in water at room temperature and near boiling. CCS-drug binding also showed good resilience in 40 % EtOH, but was poor in saline and at low pH. Furthermore, CCS particles rapidly swelled and viscosified the extraction solvents making filtration and <b>syringeability</b> extremely difficult during testing. Conclusion. Most abused pain medications are formulated as cationic drugs easily extracted for intravenous abuse. CCS prevented tramadol from extraction in water and alcohol, however its binding to tramadol was desirably low at low pH, mimicking the gastric environment. Grants. N/...|$|E
40|$|Future {{changes in}} the {{incidence}} and prevalence of OA are difficult to predict. As incidence and prevalence rise with increasing age, extending life expectancy will result in greater numbers with OA. Actually, usual therapeutic approaches are really restricted because of important side effects with long-term use. Therefore, {{there is a need}} to develop improved formulations which are well tolerated, biocompatible and biodegradable. Ideally, these new treatments should be able to deliver locally sufficient amount of anti-inflammatory or analgesic drugs into the site of arthritic inflammation while stabilizing or better restoring the mechanical integrity of the joint. In this way, the objective of this project is to develop slow-release gels that are sterile, injectable, characterized by viscoelastic properties and capable to sustain the in situ release of both hydrophilic and lipophilic drugs. The intraarticular delivery combined to sustained-release property should be interesting to reduce the number of injection required while prolonging the local drug activity over weeks. For that purpose, glycerol monooleate (GMO), also called “monolein” was selected for its capacity to form highly viscous crystalline phase structures upon contact with an aqueous fluid (e. g. synovial fluid). In the first step of this work, it was decided to develop and characterize hydro-lipidic gels based on the use of monolein and hyaluronic acid in order to provide in vitro sustained release of hydrophilic drugs such as clonidine and lipophilic drugs such as betamethasone. Initially, a compatibility study was performed on the main ingredients selected in order to check that there were not physico-chemical incompatibilities, which could be deleterious regarding to their stability in formulation. Then, the development of hydro-lipidic gels was initiated by considering on the first hand the solubility of each ingredient and on the other hand the <b>syringeability,</b> the rheological properties and the in vitro dissolution profiles obtained for the developed formulations. The objective of this preformulation program was to identify potential candidates that presented suitable <b>syringeability</b> while being able to sustain the release of drugs over weeks and being characterized by interesting viscoelastic properties for the long-term management of osteoarthritis. Moreover, several methods of quantification and characterization were developed in order to allow the physico-chemical properties (rheology, <b>syringeability,</b> water uptake, stability and dissolution profiles) of the developed formulations to be studied. Results of the compatibility study showed that the concomitant use of monolein, hyaluronic acid and clonidine/betamethasone is not contraindicated. Next, the preformulation program allowed many injectable drug delivery systems to be prepared. However, the carrier that best meets our needs was composed of 10, 0 % (wt/wt) absolute ethanol; 15, 0 % propylene glycol (wt/wt); 15, 0 % (wt/wt) water; 55, 0 % (wt/wt) de monolein; 5, 0 % (wt/wt) purified soybean oil; 0, 03 % (wt/wt) α-tocophérol and 7, 5 mg/g sodium hyaluronate (1. 9 MDa). This carrier assured suitable <b>syringeability</b> and rheological properties. Indeed, it presented marked pseudoplastic flow behavior that allowed relatively fast injection through a narrow needle, followed by an increase in viscosity upon contact with aqueous fluids to obtain an in vitro sustained release of hydrophilic and lipophilic drugs over a few weeks. As a consequence, it was assumed that this carrier should be able to jellify in situ upon contact with physiological fluid such as synovial fluid. Then, according to EMA recommendations, a fast and easy manufacturing process that could be applied in a cleanroom at industrial scale was validated in our Laboratory. Finally, according to these promising results obtained in vitro, a stability study was performed on the carrier alone and containing clonidine or betamethasone according to ICH recommendations described for products intended for storage in a refrigerator. In that purpose, several parameters such as the quantification of drugs, the pH, the molecular weight of hyaluronic acid, the dissolution profiles of drugs and the rheological properties of the formulations were recorded depending on time and conditions of storage. This stability study showed clearly the importance to adjust the pH value of the formulation. Indeed, it was demonstrated that a pH value of 6. 5, adjusted with diluted NaOH, allowed the stability of the formulation to be significantly improved. During this first step of this project, our Laboratory initiated two new collaborations. On the first hand, collaboration with the Laboratory of Professor Siepmann (University of Lille 2 – Faculty of Pharmacy) was started for their expertise on mathematical modeling. On the other hand, collaboration with the Laboratory of Professor Jerôme (ULg – Faculty of sciences) was started for their expertise on macromolecular chemistry and more particularly on rheological properties. In the second step of this work, it was decided to evaluate in vitro the safety and the efficiency of the developed carrier and formulations containing clonidine or betamethasone. In this way, it was suggested to test selected drugs and potential candidates formulations on equine polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) by measuring the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by PMNs stimulated or not with phorbol 12 -myristate 13 -acetate (PMA). For that purpose, our Laboratory initiated a new collaboration with the Laboratory of Professor Serteyn (ULg – Faculty of veterinary) for their expertise on equine PMNs and quantification of (ROS) produced in particular in inflammatory diseases. This in vitro study has shown that no pro-inflammatory effect appeared by incubating carrier with unstimulated PMNs in comparison with the control assay. However, the production of ROS was quickly and considerably decreased when stimulated cells were placed in contact with carrier regardless on the incorporation of clonidine or betamethasone. This observation demonstrated that developed carrier provided a strong antioxidant effect, certainly by trapping the ROS produced. These results were very promising because that antioxidant effect of carrier could inhibit oxidative damages and might consequently potentiate the prevention of inflammatory conditions. Concerning the clonidine and betamethasone, only the last one provided significant inhibition of the ROS activity. Finally, by considering the very promising results obtained with the in vitro study on PMNs, an in vivo study on rabbits, which seemed to be the most appropriate small animal model for this kind of intraarticular formulations, was performed to evaluate the toxicity and the efficiency of the developed carrier and formulation containing betamethasone. Therefore, our Laboratory started collaboration with the unit of research in osteo-articular pathologies (UROC) of Pr. Henrotin (ULg) for their expertise in animal models, in particular rabbits with osteoarticular pathologies such as osteoarthritis. For this purpose, this in vivo study was outsourced by TNO (Delft, Holland) and was designed as follow: (i) 0. 9 % saline buffered (n= 8); (ii) carrier (n= 8); (iii) formulation containing betamethasone (n= 8); (iv) Durolane® (n= 8) a marketed product of HA. Surprisingly, it seemed that the control group (saline buffered) presented macroscopical and histological scores that were globally low according to literature. As a consequence, it was difficult to conclude about the efficiency of the developed treatments by considering only this pilot study. However, it is important to note that it seemed that the expected viscoelastic protection of the carrier to prevent the degradation of articular cartilage was not optimal regardless on the incorporation of betamethasone. Nevertheless, the histological analyses of synovial membranes from each treated groups demonstrated that there was no pro-inflammatory reaction. This meant that all formulations tested were well tolerated despite of the apparition of lumps (in 37. 5 % of treated rabbits) that are probably due to both the high volume injected (900 µL) and an excessive and unexpected in situ water uptake of developed formulations based on GMO. However, this lack of rejection of the developed carrier could be very important since it allowed new perspectives to be considered. For example, other articular disorders could be targeted by incorporating drugs, for which in situ sustained release or mechanical protection could be beneficial. Our laboratory is member of a collaborative project "JOINT-AIC" from BioWin and is supported by a grant from the Walloon Region. The development of analytical methods, the evaluation of physico-chemical properties and finally the preparation of sterile batches of formulations based on GMO intended for in vitro and in vivo studies were performed in the Laboratory of Galenic and Biopharmacy of the Faculty of Pharmacy of ULB. /L’arthrose est une pathologie dont la prévalence et le coût ne font qu’augmenter dans notre société vieillissante. Les moyens thérapeutiques actuels étant fort limités suite à de sérieux effets secondaires à long terme, il existe réellement un besoin médical important de développer de nouveaux traitements locaux qui soient bien tolérés, biocompatibles et biodégradables. Idéalement, ceux-ci devraient être actifs au niveau du processus inflammatoire ou de la douleur tout en étant capable de stabiliser, voire de restaurer, l’intégrité mécanique de l’articulation. Dans cette optique, l’objectif de ce projet a été de développer des systèmes hydrolipidiques stériles, injectables et viscoélastiques qui soient capables de prolonger in situ la libération de principes actifs hydrophiles et lipophiles. Cette caractéristique devait permettre de réduire le nombre d’injections nécessaires dans le cadre du traitement symptomatique de l’arthrose et de maintenir l’effet des composés sur un minimum de quatre à six semaines. Cette étude entre dans le cadre du projet JOINT-AIC entièrement financé par le programme BioWin de la Région Wallonne. Le développement, la validation des méthodes analytiques, l’évaluation des propriétés physico-chimiques ainsi que la préparation stérile des lots de formulation destinés aux tests in vitro et in vivo ont été réalisés au sein du Laboratoire de Galénique et Biopharmacie de la Faculté de Pharmacie de l’ULB. Au cours de ce projet, il a donc fallu dans un premier temps développer et caractériser des formulations hydrolipidiques à base de monoléine et d’acide hyaluronique permettant une libération in vitro prolongée de principes actifs tels que la clonidine (hydrophile) et le dipropionate de bétaméthasone (lipophile). Une étude de compatibilité a ainsi été préalablement réalisée afin de s’assurer qu’aucun des constituants principaux de la formulation ne présentaient d’incompatibilité physico-chimique qui pourrait être délétère vis-à-vis de leur stabilité en formulation. Ensuite, le développement de préparations hydro-lipidiques a été initié en tenant compte, d’une part de la solubilité des différents composants et, d’autre part de l’injectabilité, des propriétés rhéologiques et des profils de libération de la clonidine obtenus à partir des gels développés. Cette étude visait à obtenir une composition de référence qui soit à la fois injectable et capable de libérer un principe actif hydrophile sur plusieurs jours, voire plusieurs semaines, tout en possédant des propriétés rhéologiques intéressantes dans le cadre d’une viscosupplémentation articulaire. Enfin, un protocole de fabrication en milieu aseptique a été développé et plusieurs méthodes pour étudier les propriétés physico-chimiques des gels développés telles que la rhéologie, l’injectabilité, l’indice de gonflement, la stabilité et les profils de libérations ont été mises en place. Les résultats ont montré qu’aucune incompatibilité ne semblait exister entre les trois composés majeurs de notre préparation, la monoléine, l’acide hyaluronique et la clonidine. Le développement des formulations nous a ensuite permis d’obtenir de nouveaux systèmes hydrolipidiques stériles et injectables à délivrance prolongée. Le véhicule qui remplissait au mieux nos objectifs était composé de 10, 0 % (m/m) d’éthanol;de 15, 0 % de propylène glycol (m/m);de 15, 0 % (m/m) d’eau;de 55, 0 % (m/m) de monoléine; 5, 0 % (m/m) d’huile de soja purifiée; 0, 03 % (m/m) d’α-tocophérol, de 7, 5 mg/g d’HA et son pH était ajusté à 6, 5 avec du NaOH 1 N. Ce véhicule a montré un intérêt réel dans le cadre du développement de préparations biodégradables et biocompatibles pour le traitement de pathologies articulaires. En effet, cette composition présentait un écoulement de type pseudoplastique et des propriétés rhéologiques qui lui procuraient une bonne injectabilité. De plus, cette formulation a démontré in vitro une excellente capacité à gélifier au contact de fluides aqueux et à ralentir efficacement sur plusieurs semaines la libération des différents principes actifs incorporés (clonidine et dipropionate de bétaméthasone). Nous pouvions, dès lors, envisager que celle-ci serait capable de gélifier in situ au contact d’un fluide physiologique tel que le liquide synovial. Ensuite, suivant les recommandations de l’EMA, nous avons décidé d’utiliser l’association d’une filtration stérilisante et d’une préparation en milieu aseptique pour obtenir des formulations qui répondaient aux exigences en matière de préparation parentérale. C’est ainsi qu’un protocole de fabrication stérile de nos gels a été développé par nos soins en vue d’une éventuelle mise à l’échelle industrielle. Enfin, une étude de stabilité sur une année, suivant les normes ICH décrites pour des formulations destinées à être conservées au frigo, a été réalisée sur différents véhicules développés et contenant soit la clonidine, soit le dipropionate de bétaméthasone. Dans cette optique, plusieurs paramètres, tels que le dosage en principe actif, l’évolution du pH et du poids moléculaire de HA, le profil de libération ainsi que la rhéologie des formulations ont été évalués au cours du temps aux différentes conditions de conservation testées. Cette étude a permis de démontrer toute l’importance d’ajuster le pH de la préparation pour prévenir l’hydrolyse de l’HA, et cela indépendamment de l’incorporation de principe actif. Ainsi, il a pu être montré que l’ajustement du pH du véhicule à 6, 5 à partir de NaOH dilué permettait d’améliorer considérablement la stabilité de la formulation puisqu’aucune modification significative de ses différents paramètres physico-chimiques et teneurs n’a été observée après un an de conservation à 5 et à 25 °C (60 % HR) mais également après six mois à 30 °C (65 % HR). Au cours de cette première partie, deux collaborations ont été initiées, l’une avec le Laboratoire du Prof. Siepmann de l’Université de Lille 2 et l’autre avec le Prof. Jerôme de l’Université de Liège. Avec l’aide du Prof. Siepmann, il a été possible de mettre au point un modèle mathématique pour caractériser les profils de libération des principes actifs à partir des différents véhicules développés. Le Prof. Jerôme a, quant à elle, mis à notre disposition un rhéomètre qui a permis d’approfondir nos connaissances sur les propriétés rhéologiques et viscoélastiques des formulations. Ensuite, la seconde partie de notre travail a consisté à évaluer la tolérance, ainsi que l’efficacité des principes actifs sélectionnés et des formulations développées, à travers un modèle in vitro de cellules de l’inflammation (neutrophiles équins). Cette étude avait pour objectif d’évaluer deux aspects importants de la formulation :d’une part vérifier l’absence de réaction pro-inflammatoire qui pourrait être in vivo destructrice vis-à-vis du véhicule ainsi que des tissus environnants, et d’autre part vérifier l’effet anti-inflammatoire propre à la clonidine et au dipropionate de bétaméthasone seuls et en formulation. Cette étude a été réalisée avec la collaboration du Laboratoire du Prof. Serteyn de l’Université de Liège. Cette étude in vitro a démontré que les cellules restaient viables au moins pendant quatre heures lorsqu’elles étaient exposées à la matrice épurée de ses solvants. Ensuite, de manière surprenante, il a même pu être démontré que le véhicule permettait à la fois de prévenir et de réduire significativement la production des espèces réactives de l’oxygène (ROS) par les neutrophiles équins lorsque ceux-ci étaient stimulés au phorbol 12 -myristate 13 -acetate (PMA). Cette propriété peut être d’un grand intérêt dans le cadre de la prise en charge de l’arthrose car cette activité antioxydante pourrait permettre d’inhiber les dommages oxydatifs générés par les ROS et ainsi prévenir les dommages liés au développement du processus inflammatoire et qui peut, à long terme, s’avérer délétère pour les tissus environnants tels que le cartilage. Cette propriété du véhicule semble trouver son origine dans la monoléine qui, de par sa composition en alpha-tocophérol (200 ppm), présente également une activité antioxydante vis-à-vis des ROS. Toutefois, une action synergique liée à l’HA, à l’huile de soja ou à l’alpha-tocophérol incorporés aux formulations, n’est pas à exclure. Enfin, parmi les deux principes actifs sélectionnés, seul le dipropionate de bétaméthasone a montré une inhibition significative de la production des ROS. Enfin, en tenant compte des résultats obtenus sur cellules, une étude in vivo pilote a été réalisée sur base d’un modèle de lapins. Cette étude visait à vérifier la tolérance ainsi que l’efficacité en prophylaxie de l’arthrose du véhicule développé ainsi que de la formulation contenant le dipropionate de bétaméthasone. Dans ce but, quatre groupes d’animaux (n= 8) ont été constitués pour chacun des traitements testés :(i) groupe témoin : 0, 9 % tampon salin pH 7, 4;(ii) véhicule à base de GMO développé; (iii) véhicule contenant du dipropionate de bétaméthasone;(iv) groupe référence :Durolane®. Cette étude a été réalisée avec l’aide du Laboratoire du Prof. Henrotin de l’Université de Liège. L’hébergement des animaux ainsi que les actes chirurgicaux ont, quant à eux, été sous-traités par TNO (Delft, Pays-Bas). De manière étonnante, il s’est avéré que le groupe contrôle présentait des scores macroscopique et histologique globalement peu élevés par rapport à ce qui est rapporté dans la littérature. Compte tenu de cette observation, il est difficile de se prononcer, sur base uniquement de cette étude, sur l’efficacité des différents traitements testés. Toutefois, il faut reconnaître que l’effet protecteur attendu pour le véhicule vis-à-vis de la dégradation du cartilage ne semble pas optimal et cela indépendamment de l’incorporation de dipropionate de bétaméthasone. Par ailleurs, l’étude des membranes synoviales a permis de démontrer qu’il n’y avait aucune différence significative en termes d’inflammation et de structure entre le groupe contrôle et les différents groupes traités. Ce qui signifie qu’aucun rejet n’a été observé vis-à-vis des formulations et que celles-ci ont, par conséquent, été bien tolérées malgré la formation de masses liées probablement au volume important injecté (900 µL) et au gonflement in situ du produit chez 37, 5 % des lapins. Cette observation est importante puisqu’elle permet d’envisager de nouvelles perspectives telles que l’incorporation d’autres principes actifs pouvant éventuellement viser d’autres pathologies articulaires et pour lesquels une libération prolongée ou une protection mécanique du principe actif in situ serait bénéfique.

40|$|Repetitive oral {{administration}} of tablets to companion animals is particularly challenging {{and there is}} a continuing need for alternative options such as long acting injections or implants. Therefore, properties of sustained release injectables formed in-situ for use in dogs were investigated. These formulations comprise a biocompatible solvent in which the biodegradable PLA/PLGA polymers and the lipophilic anti-infective NOA 449851, derivative of milbemycin against the parasite Dirofilaria immitis are dissolved. These formulations coagulate into solid implants on contact with aqueous fluids after i. m. or s. c. injection, thereby releasing the incorporated drug slowly over a period of weeks to months. This technology has several attractive features such as simplicity of concept, ease of manufacturing as well as use of FDA approved polymers. Dissolution tests were performed to investigate in-vitro drug release characteristics from injectable formulations varying in polymer type, polymer concentration, active ingredient concentration and solvent composition. At high drug loads, release properties were independent of polymer type. However, in case of very low drug loads, drug release was controlled by polymer properties. Major releasing mechanism was found to be drug diffusion and therefore was influenced by drug concentration. Significant reduction of initial burst was observed when polymer concentration was increased. Also the solvent composition influenced in-vitro drug release. Especially a significant reduction of the initial burst was observed when a fraction of the main solvent triacetin was substituted with hydrophilic co-solvents such as ethanol absolute or anhydrous glycerol, while a lipophilic co-solvent such as Miglyol 812 did increase the initial drug release. Solvent composition, depending on its affinity to the dissolution medium, influences the rate of fluid-convection, the hardening process of the polymers, the internal structure of the implant and therefore its drug release rate. Raman and IR spectroscopy revealed that the active ingredient was incorporated in the amorphous conformation in all investigated batches. No evidence of any interaction between the active ingredient and the polymeric matrix could be detected. Tolerability and pharmacokinetic properties of six sustained release injectables formed in-situ, varying in polymer concentration and solvent composition were explored after subcutaneous administration to Beagle dogs. The high viscosity of the formulations and consequently the poor <b>syringeability</b> {{turned out to be a}} critical issue. Viscosity of the formulations was decreased by reducing the polymer concentration and by varying the composition of the solvent mixture. All investigated formulations were very good tolerated by the animals. In agreement with in-vitro investigations, reduction of polymer concentration gave rise to increased initial drug release. Presence of hydrophilic co-solvents reduced maximum drug concentration in dog plasma profiles. The active ingredient NOA 449851 was detectable in blood of experimental animals over 450 days after subcutaneous injection of sustained release formulations. However, very high inter-animal variations were found for some formulations and important differences in AUC values were calculated, despite the same amount of drug injected to each dog. These differences could be explained by possible encapsulation of the subcutaneous implant with connective tissue. The degree of correlation between the in-vitro dissolution parameters and the in-vivo pharmacokinetic data was investigated. Cmax was positively correlated to cumulative in-vitro drug release at Tmax, however not in a significant manner. In general, for this type of dosage form and drug, no satisfactory IVIVC are observed. The model used for in-vitro drug release testing neglect probably some crucial aspects of physiological conditions governing in-vivo release and cannot replace biological systems. Stability studies were performed for three sustained release injectables formed in-situ during six months storage at the four selected temperatures 5 °C, 25 °C, 30 °C and 40 °C. The formulations were based on PLA polymers, active ingredient NOA 449851, solvent triacetin and in case of one formulation, co-solvent ethanol absolute. An HPLC-method was utilized for determination of the active ingredient content. No differences between the three formulations were observed. The content of active ingredient slightly decreased with time and temperature. Molecular weights of PLA polymers were determined with GPC. Decrease in molecular weight was significantly increased with storage temperature and time. These results are in agreement with the findings of Wang et al. [Wang et al., 2003]. No significant influence of co-solvent ethanol absolute on the PLA stability could be measured. However, presence of active ingredient seemed to decrease hydrolysis process of PLA polymer, probably by competitively attracting water molecules responsible for polymer degradation. NIR data analysis of solvent triacetin showed spectral changes for wavelengths at 1900 nm. These spectral changes were consistent in every analyzed spectra set as solvent triacetin was in excess in all investigated samples. Influence of solvent effect could not be removed by study design, as no specific wavelength could be attributed to PLA polymers. Surprisingly, in-vitro drug releases from a formulation tested directly after manufacturing and after six months storage at 40 °C were found to be similar, despite the important reduction of the molecular weight of the PLA polymers. This confirms a drug release mechanism mainly controlled by drug diffusion through the matrix and not erosion controlled. Microspheres and sustained release injectables formed in-situ are both technologies intended for parenteral application, planned to achieve a long lasting drug release. In both technologies, the sustained effect is caused by biodegradable PLA/PLGA polymer matrix in which the active ingredient is embedded. In order to investigate the influence of the preparation method of the polymer matrix on the release of the drug substance, microparticles batches were prepared for comparison with regards to in-vitro release properties. For all tested microsphere batches, drug release was independent on type of biodegradable polymer. A bigger fraction of active ingredient was released from the microparticles at high drug loads. In every investigated case, drug release from sustained release injectables formed in-situ was faster and to a much larger extent than from related microparticles. As possible explanation of the slower release from microparticles may be the denser packing of the polymer matrix compared to the in-situ formed implants. The microspheres polymer matrix is solidified before injection by applying a much more efficient solvent extraction procedure then the implants which only solidifies slowly at the site of injection. For that reason, diffusion controlled drug release is slower from the more densely packed microsphere matrix. Sustained release injectables formed in-situ showed, under in-vitro as well as in-vivo conditions, a prolonged active ingredient release, confirming that this drug delivery technology is a suitable approach to achieve a controlled long term release of the lipophilic anti infective NOA 449851. This technology fulfills, for this particular compound, some basic requirements such as a good tolerability, controlled release of the active ingredient over a long period of time as well as an acceptable stability of formulation during storage for several months at low temperature conditions. Release properties of the active ingredient could be modified by changing composition of the formulation and possible detrimental burst effects could be suppressed by careful selection of polymer concentration and solvent mixture. Especially, the latter finding, the suppression of a burst effect can be considered as a significant improvement of the in-situ implant technology. It is to be expected that in the future, development of new implantable systems will, increasingly, help reducing cost for drug therapy, potentate medical treatments and, simultaneously enhance patient compliance...|$|E
