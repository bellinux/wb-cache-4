6000|$|So {{this is the}} why and {{wherefore}} of its {{coming to}} pass my dear that we called him Jemmy, being after the Major his own godfather with Lirriper for a surname being after myself, and never was a dear child such a brightening thing in a Lodgings or such a playmate to his grandmother as Jemmy to this house and me, and always good and minding what he was told (upon the whole) and soothing for the temper and making everything pleasanter except when he grew old enough to drop his cap down Wozenham's Airy and they wouldn't hand it up to him, and being worked into a state I put on my best bonnet and gloves and parasol with the child {{in my hand and}} I says [...] "Miss Wozenham I little thought ever to have entered your house but unless my grandson's cap is instantly restored, the laws of this country regulating the property of the Subject shall at length decide betwixt yourself and me, cost what it may." [...] With a sneer upon her face which did strike me I must say as being expressive of two keys but {{it may have been a}} mistake and if there is any doubt let Miss Wozenham have the full benefit of it as is but right, she rang the bell and she says [...] "Jane, is there a street-child's old cap down our Airy?" [...] I says [...] "Miss Wozenham before your housemaid answers that question you must allow me to inform you to your face that my grandson is not a <b>street-child</b> and is not in the habit of wearing old caps. In fact" [...] I says [...] "Miss Wozenham I am far from sure that my grandson's cap may not be newer than your own" [...] which was perfectly savage in me, her lace being the commonest machine-make washed and torn besides, but I had been put into a state to begin with fomented by impertinence. Miss Wozenham says red in the face [...] "Jane you heard my question, is there any child's cap down our Airy?" [...] "Yes Ma'am" [...] says Jane, [...] "I think I did see some such rubbish a-lying there." [...] "Then" [...] says Miss Wozenham [...] "let these visitors out, and then throw up that worthless article out of my premises." [...] But here the child who had been staring at Miss Wozenham with all his eyes and more, frowns down his little eyebrows purses up his little mouth puts his chubby legs far apart turns his little dimpled fists round and round slowly over one another like a little coffee-mill, and says to her [...] "Oo impdent to mi Gran, me tut oor hi!" [...] "O!" [...] says Miss Wozenham looking down scornfully at the Mite [...] "this is not a <b>street-child</b> is it not! Really!" [...] I bursts out laughing and I says [...] "Miss Wozenham if this ain't a pretty sight to you I don't envy your feelings and I wish you good-day. Jemmy come along with Gran." [...] And I was still in the best of humours though his cap came flying up into the street as if it had been just turned on out of the water-plug, and I went home laughing all the way, all owing to that dear boy.|$|E

Considering age as social construction, other factors show up and contribute to the categorization of these persons. When the <b>street-child</b> system was applied in the neighborhood where this research took place, I found out how the children re-appropriated these categories. I analyze the strategies of consumption and meanings given to the use of crack by the young. The concepts of sub-culture and deviant are rejected and I describe concrete realities and micro and macro social mechanisms that impinge in childhood experiences in contemporary Brazil. The aim is to prove the limits of the categories: childhood, adolescence and youth to renew the debate in Childhood Studies and the new studies on the young...|$|E

The Workshop brought together IDB staff {{working in the}} areas of Early Child Care and Development (ECCD), <b>street-children,</b> and other youth at risk, with over two dozen people knowledgeable about <b>street-children.</b> Based largely on what they learned in Terezopolis, this paper draws on lessons and proposals for IDB involvement with <b>street-children</b> in Brazil. The key lesson from the Terezopolis meeting and this paper is that the programs with greatest and most lasting impact on the "street-children problem" are not "street-children programs" in the usual sense. Rather, they are programs that help build up the "social" and human capital of the poorest urban communities and families. They focus broadly on all children, including those yet unborn. These programs help provide basic (but "quality") services for sanitation, health and nutrition (especially for pregnant women and children), early child care and development, preschool, and education. ...|$|R

40|$|The present {{dissertation}} {{focuses on}} the influence of childhood experiences on social development. We aim to chart how the dynamic interplay of biological, social, and emotional influences shapes developmental trajectories. Specifically, we investigated the influence of childhood protracted conditions of maltreatment and neglect on the explicit recognition of facial expressions of emotions, along with, Facial Mimicry and vagal regulation in response to facial expressions of emotions - as physiological measures of humans’ empathic resonance and self-regulation in social context, respectively. In four successive experiments, Sierra Leonean <b>street-children</b> and street-boys, exposed to high and protracted conditions of maltreatment and neglect, were compared to age-matched controls. In the first three experiments we revealed, both in children and adolescents, a significant influence of childhood maltreatment and neglect on explicit recognition of facial expressions of emotions, on Facial Mimicry and on vagal regulation. Trauma exposure induced a response bias for angry facial expressions recognition both in street-boys and <b>street-children</b> populations. Street-boys were also characterized for a significant suppression of overall Facial Mimicry responses, as well as, for a reduced and incoherent vagal regulation in response to facial expressions of emotions. Differently, <b>street-children</b> showed alterations of lower entities. Hence, instead of a general Facial Mimicry suppression, they presented an impaired Facial Mimicry modulation between positive and negative facial expressions of emotions. Moreover, <b>street-children</b> manifested an earlier development of the functional synchronization between vagal regulation and threatening stimuli in external environment with respect to age-matched controls. These different patterns of results showed by street-boys and <b>street-children,</b> suggested a possible and differentiated additive effect of trauma exposure. This last point was specifically addressed in the last experiment in which we evaluated the impact trajectories of prolonged experiences of maltreatment and neglect on the explicit recognition of facial expressions of emotion, Facial Mimicry and vagal regulation. We demonstrated that prolonged conditions of maltreatment and neglect not progressively influence the explicit recognition of facial expressions of emotions which appeared independent from the duration of trauma exposure. Moreover, we demonstrated that protracted trauma exposure induces specific alterations in Facial Mimicry and vagal regulation to others’ facial expressions of emotions, which follow different impact trajectories. Longer trauma exposure accentuated an incoherent Facial Mimicry and a lower vagal regulation, particularly in response to angry facial expression of emotions. Differently, a compensatory vagal recruitment during the first years of trauma exposure was found, giving important suggestions about temporal windows in which rehabilitative interventions can likely contrast the occurrence of chronic outcomes. In conclusion, the present dissertation provides new and further evidence of the influence of childhood experiences on social development by confirming and better described the huge impact of prolonged experiences of maltreatment and neglect on the understanding of emotions, empathic resonance, and self-regulation in social contexts. It clearly appears that if, as Aristotle wrote, “Man is by nature a social animal” and, as recent neuroscientific evidence suggested the human mind is ontogenetically interpersonal and wired to be social, the early traumatic experiences negatively influence physiological mechanisms supporting our social nature...|$|R

40|$|The rapid {{increase}} in numbers of homeless children in cities of the developed and developing world {{is a matter of}} grave concern. A multi-disciplinary study was undertaken to examine the health and lifestyles of the homeless in Nepal in comparison to other local children. Few studies have quantified the health of <b>street-children</b> in the developing world using anthropometric indicators, and to our knowledge this is the first to systematically compare the homeless with appropriate controls from both rural and urban areas. Heights and weights were measured for 307 six to fourteen year-old boys (111 homeless, 62 squatter, 82 privileged school and 52 village boys). Height for age (HAz), weight for age (WAz) and weight for height (WHz) z-scores relative to reference data from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) were used as indicators of growth status. Stunting characterized all but the school-boys, but wasting was not observed. The homeless were less stunted than either poor squatter or village boys. On arrival on the streets, they were taller than village boys, and duration of homelessness had no effect on their growth status. Thus in terms of physical growth, and despite frequent health complaints, homeless boys in Nepal fare relatively better than control groups of poor urban and rural boys. Comparative studies which reveal some successful aspects of street-life show that urban homelessness may represent an appropriate response to circumstances of poverty. <b>street-children</b> rural-urban migration socio-economic status health growth nutrition...|$|R

Witchcraft accusations against children in Africa have received increasing international attention in the first decade of the 21st century. Children who are specifically at risk of such accusations include orphans, <b>street-children,</b> albinos, disabled children, children who are unusually gifted, children who were born prematurely or in unusual positions, and twins. Being accused of witchcraft in Africa is very dangerous, as a witch is culturally understood to be the symbol of evil, and the cause of all ills. Consequently, those accused of being a witch are ostracized and subjected to punishment, torture and even murdered.|$|R

40|$|Facial mimicry and vagal {{regulation}} represent two crucial {{physiological responses}} to others' facial expressions of emotions. Facial mimicry, {{defined as the}} automatic, rapid and congruent electromyographic activation to others' facial expressions, is implicated in empathy, emotional reciprocity and emotions recognition. Vagal regulation, quantified by the computation of Respiratory Sinus Arrhythmia (RSA), exemplifies the autonomic adaptation to contingent social cues. Although it has been demonstrated that childhood maltreatment induces alterations in the processing of the facial expression of emotions, both at an explicit and implicit level, the effects of maltreatment on children's facial mimicry and vagal regulation in response to facial expressions of emotions remain unknown. The {{purpose of the present}} study was to fill this gap, involving 24 <b>street-children</b> (maltreated group) and 20 age-matched controls (control group). We recorded their spontaneous facial electromyographic activations of corrugator and zygomaticus muscles and RSA responses during the visualization of the facial expressions of anger, fear, joy and sadness. Results demonstrated a different impact of childhood maltreatment on facial mimicry and vagal regulation. Maltreated children did not show the typical positive-negative modulation of corrugator mimicry. Furthermore, when only negative facial expressions were considered, maltreated children demonstrated lower corrugator mimicry than controls. With respect to vagal regulation, whereas maltreated children manifested the expected and functional inverse correlation between RSA value at rest and RSA response to angry facial expressions, controls did not. These results describe an early and divergent functional adaptation to hostile environment of the two investigated physiological mechanisms. On the one side, maltreatment leads to the suppression of the spontaneous facial mimicry normally concurring to empathic understanding of others' emotions. On the other side, maltreatment forces the precocious development of the functional synchronization between vagal regulation and threatening social cues facilitating the recruitment of fight-or-flight defensive behavioral strategies...|$|R

It supported by the minimum work-field and proper skill, those made individual step aside from the competition, especially in large cities. Moreover the load got heavier. Large cities in developed country like Indonesia owed similar problems in every regions. Those were the increasing of criminality, street-singer, <b>street-children,</b> and many more. Street-singer could be met in railway station, bus station, restaurant, and small restaurant, and traffic intersection. The hard life of street-singer made them faced one thing, that was conflict among street singer. There often fought caused by location struggle and the other problems like misunderstanding. This kind of conflict also happened to street singer in City Field (â€˜Alun-Alunâ€™) Malang city. Where city field as work-field for permanent street-singer and other street-singer outside group couldnâ€™t freely singing there. It developed conflict which ended in violence among them. Violence happened {{was a kind of}} environment influence where they should survive in city area. The research was descriptive qualitative, where the subject were permanent street-singer and temporary street-singer in City Field of Malang City. The subjects were 10 people. Data collection technique were observation, deep interview, and documentation. Data analysis technique was Miles and Huberman interactive model data analysis which owed four activities line. Those were: data collection, data reduction, data service and conclusion or verification. Conflict happened between permanent street-singer with temporary street-singer in City Field was already happened since 1994, after the formation of permanent street-singer in City Field. The conflict happened because of the struggle for street-singing work-field. The street-singer said that the economic load increased while their income got harder. The conflict caused violence in swarm attack and mass-fighting and personal violence. Before the violence, they insulted each other, swore each other, etc. The conflict won by one group which was permanent street singer, since the permanent street-singer had authority in city field backed up by a person from Public Police Employee Officer (Satpol PP) and related institution. Still the conflict was still happened often. Activities they had done everyday in city field was one of their struggle in the city to survive since competition in formal sector was hard to be formed, moreover they were lack of education, while job in formal sector needed various conditions. Their income couldnt compare with job from formal sector, so that in order to survive, they had to struggle hard. Since they struggle to survive in the city, they faced various problems ended in violence. Temperament attitude or emotion was a physical character of the street-singer.

40|$|The overall {{research}} {{objective of the}} thesis is to analyse the causal relationship between, on the one hand, the late Soviet and early post-Soviet societal development, and, on the other, the evolving <b>street-children</b> problem. In terms of timeframe, the thesis mainly explores developments in Russia from 1985 (when Gorbachev came to power) until 1996 (when the post-Soviet framework conditions for child neglect became virtually irreversible {{as a result of}} the presidential elections of that year). However, several of the examinations of concrete child-neglect determinants will narrow their perspective to include only the period from 1987 (when Gorbachev embarked on radical reforms) or occasionally from a later point of time (due to lack of available sources). According to Soviet and post- 1991 Russian legislation alike, the pivotal role in child-protection work in Russia was assigned to the Commissions for the Affairs of Minors (Komissii po Delam Nesovershennoletnikh, KDN). This child protection institute thus acquires double actuality for the thesis. First, in its capacity as coordinating organ for all other agencies involved in prevention of child neglect, as well as in its capacity as agency assessing individual child-neglect cases, the KDN institute is definitely within the scope of the thesis. Second, as a societal institute spanning the Soviet and post-Soviet periods in Russia, the Commissions for the Affairs of Minors conveniently provides a topic for evaluating the effect of the politico-organisational (i. e. systemic) changes on the country’s child protection system. Therefore, while the scope and magnitude of the evolving street children phenomenon (“child-neglect scale”) represents one research topic (i. e. longitudional focus area of the thesis) the changing effectiveness of KDN (“KDN capacity”) constitutes a second research topic. As far as the issue of continuity or rupture from Soviet to post-Soviet reality is concerned, the role of the Communist Party (in the thesis referred to as CPSU or Party) is undoubtedly of crucial importance. The Party was ultimately and solely responsible for the organisation of all aspects of Soviet society, child-protection work and KDN included. If the chaos and anarchy that increasingly characterised the late Soviet era, and in particular post-Soviet Russia, is largely associated with the organisational vacuum that arose from the rapid and unredressed disappearance of the Party from the historical scene, a logical consequence of the collapse of the USSR should also be an enfeebled KDN. Focusing on the politico-organisational aspects of the break-up of the Soviet Union, the specific {{research objective}} of the thesis will therefore be to assess the assumption that the weakening and eventual dissolution of the CPSU contributed to an accelerating disorganisation of KDN, thereby sharpening the effects of the socio-economic downturn on Russian child protection...|$|R
