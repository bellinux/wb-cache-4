40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} whether fission gas swelling and release would be significant factors in a <b>space</b> <b>based</b> nuclear <b>reactor</b> operating under the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) program, the finite element program REDSTONE was developed to model 1 -D, spherical geometry diffusion equations describing transient fission gas behavior in a single uranium nitride fuel grain. The equations characterized individual bubbles,, limiting calculations to low temperatures, low burnups, or both. Instabilities in the bubble radii calculations forced additional constraints limiting the bubble sizes to minimum and maximum (equilibrium) radii. Validity was checked against analytical solutions for internal consistency and against experimental studies for external agreement. These checks indicated REDSTONE was satisfactorily accounting for intragranular fission gas swelling, but other non-gaseous sources accounted for up to 1. 5 % additional swelling. Calculations were performed to determine the swelling and gas release of a hypothetica...|$|R
40|$|Fuel cell <b>reactors</b> or electrolyzers <b>based</b> on {{alkaline}} anion-exchange membrane and {{proton exchange}} membrane (AAEM & PEM) are investigated for gas phase electrochemical conversion of humidified CO 2 under identical conditions, using conventional Pt/C, Pd/C and Cu/CNTs as cathodic catalysts. Humidified CO 2 {{can be converted}} to H 2 and CO via the AAEM <b>based</b> fuel cell <b>reactors</b> with an estimated onset potential of − 1. 0 V using Cu/CNT as cathodic catalyst, while PEM <b>based</b> fuel cell <b>reactors</b> can only produce H 2 under identical conditions. This {{can be attributed to the}} suppressed hydrogen evolution and enhanced CO 2 reduction in the case of AAEM <b>based</b> <b>reactor.</b> Remarkably, AAEM <b>based</b> <b>reactor</b> with Cu/CNT cathode catalysts shows a higher activity (8. 88 μmol h− 1 cm− 2) to convert CO 2 to CO than that of Pd/C (7. 59 μmol h− 1 cm− 2) and Pt/C (0. 75 μmol h− 1 cm− 2) at the same catalyst loading. This study indicates that AAEM <b>based</b> <b>reactor</b> is able to realize the gas phase electrochemical conversion of CO 2, providing a viable strategy for CO 2 utilization and conversion to useful fuels...|$|R

25|$|Thorium {{has been}} {{proposed}} as a clean, safe, proliferation resistant and sustainable source of energy which additionally is free {{from most of the}} issues associated with uranium. The average crustal abundance of thorium is four times more than that of uranium. Thorium is invariably associated with rare-earth elements or rare metals like niobium, tantalum and zirconium. Hence, it can be recovered as a by-product of other mining activities. Already, large quantities of thorium recovered from rare-earth element operations have been stockpiled in many countries. Thorium is fertile material, and essentially all thorium {{can be used in a}} nuclear reactor. Thorium is not fissile in itself, absorbs a neutron to transmute into uranium-233, which can fission to produce energy. Therefore, a thorium based fuel cycle produces very little, easily manageable waste compared to uranium. Thorium based fuel cycle options can be used to 'burn' all the presently accumulated nuclear waste. Various thorium <b>based</b> <b>reactor</b> designs are inherently more safe than uranium <b>based</b> <b>reactors.</b>|$|R
