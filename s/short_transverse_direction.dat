40|$|Deformation and forging {{operations}} often introduce microstructural orientation and, therewith, mechanical anisotropy to steel. Flattened manganese sulfide inclusions {{are held}} responsible for {{a great part of}} fatigue anisotropy. Isotropic-quality (IQ) steel maintains the mechanical isotropy of the material, even after a deformation operation. Isotropic material generally contains little S and, therewith, few manganese sulfides. Further, the IQ steels used in this investigation were Ca treated. The Ca treatment improves the shape stability of the sulfides, even during a hot-working deformation. Two commercial materials were compared for their fatigue response, a standard medium-carbon steel with 0. 04 wt pct S and a low-sulfur variant that underwent IQ treatment. The two batches were cross-rolled to plates with a deformation ratio of 4. 5, leading to in-plane isotropy. Tension-compression fatigue testing was performed in longitudinal and short transversal directions relative to the rolling plane. The results showed strong anisotropy of the fatigue behavior for the standard material. The performance in the <b>short</b> <b>transverse</b> <b>direction,</b> with the principal stress perpendicular to the flattened inclusions, was inferior.

40|$|The {{microstructural}} modifications occurring {{during the}} natural or artificial {{aging of the}} aluminum alloys are related to modifications of physical properties such as electrical conductivity, hardness, and volume, each of them measured by specific instruments. In this paper the dimensional changes during the aging time were investigated through a high precision dilatometer; this technique keeps the sample at constant temperature and follows the precipitation phenomena versus time continuously. All the samples were taken from commercial thick plates of different aluminum alloys. The heavy plastic deformation during rolling was responsible for introducing anisotropy into the plate, so that the samples for the investigation were taken in the longitudinal, long <b>transverse,</b> and <b>short</b> <b>transverse</b> <b>directions.</b> By analyzing the dimensional changes of the samples versus aging time, standard and non-standard time-temperature values were selected as aging parameters for samples designated for mechanical and intergranular corrosion tests.

A hot-rolled (HR) tungsten piece of 12 mm thickness and a hot-forged (HF) piece of about 80 mm thickness were used to simulate the thin and thick blocks in the target. The two tungsten pieces were characterized with metallography analysis, hardness measurement and tensile testing. The HR piece exhibits an anisotropic grain structure with an average size of about 330 x 140 x 40 mu m in rolling, long <b>transverse</b> and <b>short</b> <b>transverse</b> (thickness) <b>directions.</b> The HF piece possesses a bimodal grain structure with about 310 x 170 x 70 mu m grain size in deformed part and about 25 mu m sized grains remained from sintering process. Hardness (HV 0. 2) of the HR piece is slightly greater than that of the HF one. The ductility of the HR tungsten specimens is greater than that of the HF tungsten. For the HF tungsten piece, specimens with small grains in gauge section manifest lower ductility but higher strength. The DBTT evaluated from the tensile results is 250 - 300 degrees C for the HR tungsten and about 350 degrees C for the HF tungsten. (c) 2015 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

The fatigue tests were conducted at constant stress amplitudes ranging from 30 % to 100 % of the yield strength ay in the rolling direction, R = 0. 1, a frequency of 20 Hz, room temperature in air using a self-aligning four-point bend rig. It {{was found that the}} fatigue life of a sample loaded in the rolling direction was about ten times longer than that of a sample loaded in the <b>short</b> <b>transverse</b> <b>direction</b> at the same stress amplitude. The fatigue limit for the short transverse samples was measured to be about 30 % sigma(y), while it was about 40 % ay for the longitudinal samples.

The inferior high cycle fatigue property of the short transverse samples is believed to be due to the combination of planar grain boundaries (parallel to { 110 } plane) being perpendicular to the load axis and the existence of trace elements, Na and K, in the alloy. Within the rolling plane, the fatigue behavior was relatively isotropic in the surface region of the plate, while in the plate center it was significantly inferior in the direction of about 35 relative to the rolling direction.

40|$|Ever-growing {{requirements}} on combustion engine efficiency of motor vehicles demand increasing service loads in powertrain components. Optimization of component material is therefore inevitable. A major detriment with many forged transmission components is their anisotropic mechanical behavior, not least during cyclic loading. Any forging operation will introduce material flow and therewith orientation into the material. With the bulk material also non-metallic inclusions will be deformed. This {{orientation of the}} microstructure is held responsible for mechanical anisotropy. Manganese sulfides (MnS) in engineering steel are indigenous non-metallic inclusions which appear according to chemical specifications. These sulfides may generate benefits during component machining and are therefore widely accepted. Microstructural investigations on several materials showed that manganese sulfides deform excessively during any hot deformation operation of the steel. However, by solid solution hardening of the sulfides with calcium (Ca), original inclusion shapes can be maintained throughout a deformation operation. The present investigation {{is concerned with the}} examination of the influence of deformed MnS inclusions on fatigue anisotropy. Experimental as well as commercial medium carbon steels with standard and low sulfur (S) contents and therewith different sulfide populations have been hot deformed. Hardened test specimens of those steels, taken in short-transverse and longitudinal directions with respect to the deformation direction, were then fatigue tested. For material with standard S content, fatigue limits in longitudinal test direction are generally twice as high as in <b>short</b> <b>transverse</b> <b>direction.</b> Fractographic investigations showed that fatigue crack initiation is dominated by sulfide inclusions which ultimately can be held responsible for material anisotropy. The very poor fatigue resistance in <b>short</b> <b>transverse</b> <b>direction</b> {{can be attributed to the}} appearance of clustered sulfides, where the geometry of such clusters is not accessible by any established metallographic procedure. Diminishing of sulfide inclusions did improve isotropy. Yet, the most powerful measure to increase isotropy of the material proved to be an additional Ca treatment of the sulfides. Thus, quasi isotropic material could be created. In-situ tensile testing in a scanning electron microscope chamber showed that manganese sulfides bond very poorly to the steel matrix. Manganese sulfides in a steel matrix should therefore be seen as inherent micro-cracks. The nature of discoid sulfides being micro-cracks matters also during material hardening where current production material shows a considerably higher quench crack propensity as compared with low S material. Quench cracks initiate at flattened sulfides. Machinability of low S material did not show to be problematic at high cutting speeds. It is believed that an optimization of cutting parameters can balance the disadvantages of low S material during machining operations with low cutting speeds...|$|E

This structure partakes {{of the advantages of}} earlier slab-symmetric optical acceleration proposals, but will use a terahertz-frequency external radiation source (λ= 340 [*]  μm), allowing realistic electron beams to be used in a proof-of-principle experiment. Two- and three-dimensional electromagnetic simulations are used to verify the mode patterns and study the effects of the couplers, including time-dependent calculations of the filling of the structure and particle-in-cell computations of the beam wakefields. Details of the resonance are found to be highly sensitive to the coupling slot geometry: the presence of the couplers can lead to frequency detuning, changes in the field breakdown limits and overall Q factor, and distortions of the field pattern. Beam wakefields are enhanced by the presence of the slots, but found to have no significant effect on the beam transport.

Much of this effort has been directed at understanding and overcoming their "Achilles heel" of low ductility and poor fracture toughness (particularly for crack planes perpendicular to the <b>short</b> <b>transverse</b> <b>direction).</b> This study reviews the metallurgical features which affect ductility and damage tolerance in the 8090 and 8091 alloys developed at Alcan and the Royal Aircraft Establishment. The paper shows that control of these metallurgical features can be used to markedly improve these properties. Three examples will be given. In the first case the production of material with a high damage tolerance will be discussed. It will be shown that by control of grain structure and ageing practice, 8090 sheet with a plane stress fracture toughness (Kc) of > 130 MPa/[MATH] can be achieved at similar strength levels to 2024 -T 3 sheet. There is also a decrease in fatigue crack growth rate. This results in sheet with an overall damage tolerance capability comparable with that of 2024 -T 3.

In sheet form toughness is slightly better than that of 2024 T 3 at the same strength level and the corrosion/stress corrosion behaviour of the Lital alloy is superior to that of 2024. In plate and extruded forms strength properties match those for 2024 while toughness in the rolling plane is superior. Though thickness toughness matches that of 2024 while fatigue crack growth rate is less than for 2024. In the medium strength Lital A (8090) condition considerably improved strengths and strength/toughness relationships have been achieved by optimisation of stretching and final ageing practices. Strengths attainable are close to the targets originally set for the high strength Lital B (8091). Plate up to 100 mm thick has been produced exhibiting good ductility and fracture toughness in the <b>short</b> <b>transverse</b> <b>direction.</b> In sheet form the medium strength alloy is unrecrystallised and, therefore, exhibits some anisotropy of properties but strength targets are being achieved. Demand for the 8090 alloy has reduced the development time available for the high strength Lital B (8091) alloy. So far only limited production of Lital B has occurred at Kitts Green but very good strength properties have been achieved. Using optimised stretching and ageing practices, it appears that very high strength levels can be achieved in thin 8091 plate, although this is by sacrifice of the through thickness properties...|$|E

The combination of properties such as high temperature strength, resistance to oxidation and corrosion, fabricability, and creep strength make them an unusual class of materials, attracting researchers and scientists to explore its full potential. Among this group, the nickel superalloys find wide applications in aero engines and land-based gas turbines. They are still being modified in chemical composition to meet the increasing demands of aircraft and energy producing industry. One such newly developed Ni-base alloy is Haynes 282. Haynes 282 showed sensitivity to heat treatment temperatures. The heat treatment temperatures were varied around the conventional heat treatment and within the typical tolerance limits. The microstructural development was systematically studied at intermediate stages through microscopy. To understand the influence of microstructural change on mechanical properties tensile testing was performed at room temperature. The gamma prime (γ׳) morphological change was observed to change from cuboidal to spherical to bimodal in three different heat treatment conditions. The carbide morphology changes from interconnected to discrete morphology. The strength of the material is affected by {{the size and shape of}} the cuboidal γ׳ precipitates, while the ductility at room temperature seem to be affected by interconnected morphology of the carbides at the grain boundaries. Haynes 282 are used in different forms such as forgings, bars, sheets in component applications. The important aspect of such alloy is to understand the structure/property relations at in-service conditions. Haynes 282 in form of forgings showed ductility variations in <b>short</b> <b>transverse</b> <b>direction</b> (ST) from 24 % to 12 % as compared to its longitudinal transversal (LT) direction. The lower limit of ductility is close to the design tolerance and thus creates a need to understand the variation in ductility. In this part, the study is focused to understand ductility variation by microscopic investigations. The influence of carbide segregation and banding is seen to influence the ductility when oriented perpendicular to the tensile axis. This influence is also qualitatively captured through micromechanical modelling...|$|E
