From 1 January 1970, the undertaking was renamed VEB Kombinat Verkehrsbetriebe der <b>Stadt</b> <b>Leipzig</b> (LVB) ("People's Collective Enterprise 'Transport Services of Leipzig City'").|$|E

It reopened in 1817 as the Theater der <b>Stadt</b> <b>Leipzig</b> and its 1828-29 season saw the premieres of Heinrich Marschner's Der Vampyr and Der Templer und die Jüdin. From 1829 to 1832 it served as the court theatre for the Kingdom of Saxony before passing into private hands. After the Neues Theater was built in 1868, the theatre was renamed the Altes Theater and used only for plays and operettas. From 1912 onwards it was again operated by the city council.|$|E
