Changing an unimportant dimension such as {{the width of a}} ventilation slot may match an available tool, requiring a single cut, rather than cutting each side separately. CAD support may also manage the selection of tools to be loaded into the turret before starting work.|$|R
40|$|When a bar falling {{or moving}} at any speed strikes the {{opposite}} side of threaded rod fastening a thick circular disk, stress wave propagating from the collision interface is transmitted into the assembly system, tightening the thick circular disk by the bolt-nut unit. This paper experimentally studies the relationship between the loosening response of bolt-nut fastening assembly system and stress wave modes (tension or compression) along the direction of propagation. The technique of observing the loosening of a bolt-nut assembly system by monitoring the configuration of stress waves reflected from the surface of a thick circular disk is presented. The axial stress of a bolt tightened by a hexagonal nut in conjunction with a <b>plain</b> <b>washer,</b> a spring washer or a flanged nut is measured, when a number of incident waves are impinged into the assembly system. The shift of axial stress due to tightening by flanged nut is the smallest...|$|R
40|$|Experience {{has shown}} that a bolt-nut {{assembly}} system properly tightened can be loosened under vibrating load or impact. This paper experimentally investigates the loosening response of an assembly when a stress wave is transmitted from a gross area of a bolt, a face of a circular disk, or a screw thread of the thick circular disk assembly fastened by the bolt-nut unit. When a falling bar strikes {{the opposite side of}} a threaded rod fastened to the circular disk, or a falling circular pipe collides with the circular disk or with the anvil attached {{to the end of a}} screw, a stress wave propagating from the collision interface is transmitted into the assembly. The axial stress of a bolt tightened by a hexagonal nut in conjunction with a <b>plain</b> <b>washer</b> is measured, while a number of incident waves are impinged into the assembly. The shift of axial stress due to the stress wave transmitted from the portion of the screw thread is the largest. The cause of the loosening is investigated by observing the stress waves transmitted into the circular disk assembly system...|$|R

40|$|AbstractBolted joints {{are used}} for {{fastening}} components together in the industry, aeronautics and in railways. These joints may get loose with time and if not attended timely may result in catastrophic failure also. The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine the effect of tightening torque on loosening. For this purpose tests were conducted using three different tightening torque values, in the vicinity of rated torque. Washers of different types are used in bolted joint, with an understanding that they prevent or retard loosening. This study also attempts to examine the role of two types of most commonly used washers: the <b>plain</b> <b>washer</b> and the spring washer. Trials were also performed on joint without any washer, for the sake of comparison of loosening performance of the joint. The results of this experimental study are shown in terms of starting point of loosening of joint and rate of loosening of the joint. Various combinations of washers for three values of tightening torque are considered in the experimental study. The results are useful in understanding the role of type of washer in prevention of loosening of the bolted joint...|$|R
50|$|Complaints {{from the}} pilots {{led to a}} search for a solution. Beatrice 'Tilly' Shilling, a young female {{engineer}} working at the Royal Aircraft Establishment at Farnborough, came up with a disarmingly simple solution. She introduced a simple flow restrictor: a small metal disc much like a <b>plain</b> metal <b>washer.</b> The restrictor orifice was made to accommodate just the fuel needed for maximum engine power, the power setting usually used during dogfights. It came in two versions, one for 12 psi manifold pressure and one for boosted engines with 15 psi manifold pressure.|$|R

40|$|When PFCs have {{castellated}} structure, co-deposition of fuel inside {{gaps between}} castellated blocks {{is an important}} issue. Four different shapes of castellated tungsten blocks were fabricated to study corresponding issues in KSTAR: Conventional “basic” rectangular shape, <b>single</b> <b>chamfer</b> leading edge, double-chamfer and rounded edge, with two different poloidal gap distances of 0. 5 mm and 1. 0 mm. These tungsten blocks were exposed plasma of L- and H-mode discharges during a whole campaign in 2014. The blocks were taken out from the vacuum vessel after the campaign. Gap deposition was analyzed by Electron Probe X-ray Micro Analyzer (EPMA) to obtain carbon surface density (atoms/cm 2), and by Raman spectroscopy to identify chemical bonding structure of carbon deposits in gaps. The carbon surface density in toroidal and poloidal gaps was in a range from 0. 5 × 1015 atom/cm 2 up to 6. 7 × 1015 atom/cm 2. At the gap entrance, contribution of ions is 6. 0 – 6. 7 × 1015 atom/cm 2, decreased down to 1. 0 × 1015 atom/cm 2 {{at a depth of}} 0. 5 mm, and remains constant afterwards. The contribution of charge exchange neutral is about 3. 0 × 1015 atom/cm 2 at the gap entrance, and then gradually decreases as a function of distance from the entrance. Deposition in 1. 0 mm wide gaps show much larger deposition patterns and that particles have reached much deeper inside the gap. Raman spectra show that the intensity ratio I(D) /I(G) decreases from top to the depth of 5 mm indicating the increase of hydrogen contents...|$|R

40|$|Elastic stress {{concentration}} factors (SCFs) for internally pressurized thick cylindrical vessels with radial and offset circular and elliptical crossholes are presented. Three forms of intersection between the crosshole and main bore are considered: <b>plain,</b> <b>chamfered</b> and blend radiused. The minimum SCF {{was found to}} occur for the plain intersection configuration, with the peak stress at the crotch corner between the main bore and crosshole on the longitudinal plane of symmetry. Incorporating a chamfer or blend radius at the intersection reduces the {{stress concentration}} at the main bore but introduces higher peak stress elsewhere in the chamfer or blend region...|$|R
50|$|The gable is a {{projecting}} one extending further east {{than the}} wall below and the finish {{is also one}} of tile-hanging (matching that of the adjacent cottage). The tiles are clay and are decorative fish-scale type of probable 19th century origin. At the gable the cladding is embellished by pierced white painted timber barge-boards. A single two light casement window lights the interior of the garrets. The window has a moulded timber frame with a central mullion that is hollow-chamfered on the exterior and <b>plain</b> <b>chamfered</b> on the interior. The leaded lights have diamond quarrels and each light is side hung on pintles fixed to the timber frame.|$|R
40|$|A {{finite element}} {{investigation}} of the shakedown behaviour of thick cylindrical pressure vessels with crossholes subject to cycling internal pressure is presented. Radial and offset crossholes with circular and elliptical cross-sections are considered, with three types of intersection between the crosshole and main bore: <b>plain,</b> <b>chamfered</b> and blended. The {{results show that the}} crosshole significantly alters the shakedown behaviour of thick cylindrical vessels. The limit pressure is relatively unaffected, but the shakedown pressure decreases significantly. This increases the possibility of cyclic plasticity failure mechanisms in thick cylinders for a wider range of cylinder geometries. The form of the intersection between the crosshole and main bore does not significantly affect the shakedown behaviour...|$|R

50|$|The Capt. Goodgame House is a {{historic}} house on Arkansas Highway 128 in Holly Springs, Arkansas. Built in 1918, this single story wood frame house is an unusual late and high quality example of a vernacular style of house architecture more typically seen in 19th century construction in the area. It has a gable roof, and is clad in novelty siding. A porch extends across the front facade, supported by <b>plain</b> <b>chamfered</b> posts. The gable ends of the roof are extended, with full pediments, and the door and window surrounds are more elaborate than are typically seen in the area. The interior of the house follows a standard central hall plan, but the detailing is again of a particularly high quality.|$|R
50|$|The {{tower is}} three storeys high {{and has two}} vaulted rooms in the basement. Similar to the towers of Alnwick and Morpeth, the Embleton tower has stone groining. Built as a {{rectangle}} with a high, <b>plain,</b> <b>chamfered</b> base, it measures 19 ft from east to west, and 40 ft from north to south. A chimney projects near {{the centre of the}} east wall. A three-light window and a small slit have been blocked up to the south side of it. There is a two-light window of the same type on the second floor. The roof rests on thin gables. It appears that the original roof was on a higher level than the present one. The embrasures are well proportioned. The tower probably had a spire made of wood and lead, similar to another at Ryton.|$|R
50|$|The West and North {{transept}} windows have a curvilinear design - as did {{the former}} south transept window - of 4 lights with cinquefoil over. The North aisle has two 3-light windows in brick while the South aisle has two 3-light windows in curvilinearstyle, all in <b>plain</b> <b>chamfered</b> surrounds. In the North chapel, there are two lancets to the west, and two paired lancets with quatrefoils over to east, while the chancel has a 3-light Perpendicular window and a 2-light curvilinear window on the south wall. The chancel east window is a 5-light perpendicular window, while the chapel east window is a 4-light perpendicular window. All of the windows possess the original reveals, as {{do all of the}} doors. The chancel south wall has two blocked window openings: the westernmost one is blocked by the stair turret while the easterly one is cut through by 14th century curvilinear window.|$|R

First floor is open {{from end to end}} and to collars. Posts are [...] with [...] tie-beams with arched braces. Plain crownposts have axial braces, much restored. Upstairs are two large rooms and the Hall {{has been used as a}} school and an almshouse, with inserted partitions and chimneys; most of these have been removed later. Morant wrote in 1768: [...] "A house, close to the church yard, said to be built by one Chimney, was designed for the entertainment of poor people on their wedding day". It seems to be very ancient, but ruinous', without supplying a Christian name or date. That its jutting façade faces away from the church tends to confirm this secular intention, for buildings of similar form designed as the meeting places of religious guilds would have a jutting midsection facing towards the church.|$|R

5000|$|The limewashed box-framed house, four bays long, {{sits on a}} stone {{platform}} {{built into}} the hillside, under a broad half-hipped roof (now replaced with tiles rather than slates, for which evidence {{was found in the}} archaeological excavations thatch). The principal timbers are tree-ring dated to 1460: dendrochronology has also provided dates of 1594, when a first floor was inserted within the hall, and 1631 when the internal timber-framed smoke-hood was added. [...] The restoration has retained the smoke-hood, but has otherwise restored the three-unit plan of storeyed units {{at either end of the}} open, aisled hall. The two trusses within the hall are a <b>single</b> pair of <b>chamfered</b> wooden speres or posts set in the floor and forming a box-frame which carries the roof, and a pair of arch-braced base-crucks with two tiers of cusped struts above the tie-beam, which spanned the whole width of 7.5 m. The analogies are with the partly aisled halls of important houses in north-east Wales and north-west England. Gable and partition trusses, also aisled.

50|$|The {{house was}} built of local timbers - tallow wood (eucalyptus microcorys) for floor bearers, white beech (Gmelina leichhardtii) for floors, walls, and {{ceilings}} and red cedar (Toona australis) for joinery - {{thought to have been}} felled on the property or acquired from nearby, and pit-sawn and handcrafted to make boards. Bricks for steps and a fireplace were hand-made, probably from local clay. The core initially comprised a central hallway and 4 rooms - front parlour, front bedroom, rear dining room and rear bedroom. The latter was partitioned into two bedrooms at a some stage - some Burnett descendants believe it was always partitioned. A short time later two attic bedrooms were added. Early photographs of the house show external walls of deep boards and exposed timber stud framing, encircled by verandahs and resting on low stumps. The high-pitched shingled roof had a short ridge, and the verandah roofs, also shingled, were supported on <b>plain</b> <b>chamfered</b> timber posts. Glass and timber-panelled French doors opened onto the verandahs from all rooms. The first front steps were of timber, but had been replaced by 1907 with masonry steps. Between early 1907 and mid-1909, the verandah roofs were replaced with corrugated galvanised iron; later the whole roof was clad with iron. An external oven and chimney is shown in the earliest photograph, dated , but later a detached kitchen wing was built.|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The {{aim of this}} {{retrospective}} {{cohort study}} was to gather the outcomes of zirconia single crowns made by 16 members of the Italian Academy of Prosthetic Dentistry (AIOP) over a time period of up to 5 years. Materials and Methods: A total of 398 patients treated in private practices with 1, 132 zirconia-based single-crown restorations made on natural teeth from January 2005 to July 2010 were included. Three hundred forty-three anterior restorations (30. 3 %) and 789 posterior crowns (69. 7 %) were made with 16 types of zirconia, using primarily chamfer or knife-edge tooth preparation, and examined according to the esthetic, functional, and biologic criteria. To evaluate the relationship of parafunction with mechanical failure, patients with clenching or bruxism were not excluded from the study group. Results: The cumulative survival rate of all restorations was 98. 1 %, while the cumulative success rate was 94. 3 %. Functional criteria had the highest number of failures. The odds ratio (OR) for all restorations was calculated to clarify the relationship between patients who were subject/not subject to parafunctions and technical complications; the OR was 2. 60. An association between parafunction and mechanical failure was found in patients with severe parafunction. Conclusions: Porcelain-veneered zirconia <b>single</b> crowns with <b>chamfer</b> and knife-edge preparations showed good clinical results over a period of up to 5 years. Technical complications were few and were limited primarily to patients with parafunction. © 2013 by Quintessence Publishing Co Inc...|$|R
