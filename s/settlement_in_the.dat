5|$|Roman {{occupation}} {{of what is}} now southern Scotland seems to have had very little impact on settlement patterns, with Iron Age hill forts and promontory forts in the south and Brochs and wheel houses in the north, continuing to be occupied in the Early Medieval period.

Anglian <b>settlement</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> south-east reached into West Lothian, {{and to a lesser extent}} into south-western Scotland. Later Norse settlement was probably most extensive in Orkney and Shetland, with lighter <b>settlement</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Western Islands.|$|E
