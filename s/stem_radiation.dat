Aiming for optimum irrigation management in citrus orchards, we have developed a Sensor Net–Farming System (SN-Farming System) by using Field Servers to monitor tree growth and environmental condition in orchards for a long term. The Field Servers are equipped with sensors, network camera, and wireless LAN module. By using the Field Server, we measured the moisture content of soil and tree, the temperature of air, soil, and tree <b>stem,</b> solar <b>radiation,</b> humidity, CO 2 concentration, and took pictures of citrus. As a result, we observed that: 1) the deeper the soil layer, the soil temperature become lower; 2) the moisture content of tree stem and CO 2 concentration in tree showed a diurnal variation, being low in the daytime and recovering at night. These findings suggest the feasibility of Field Servers for optimum irrigation management of citrus orchards based on physiological and environment data.

40|$|We {{present an}} {{extensive}} irradiation study involving five state-of-the-art Nb 3 Sn wires which {{were subjected to}} sequential neutron irradiation up to a fast neutron fluence of 1. 6 * 10 ^ 22 m^- 2 (E > 0. 1 MeV). The volume pinning force of short wire samples was assessed in the temperature range from 4. 2 to 15 K in applied fields of up to 7 T by means of SQUID magnetometry in the unirradiated state and after each irradiation step. Pinning force scaling computations revealed that the exponents in the pinning force function differ significantly from those expected for pure grain boundary pinning, and that fast neutron irradiation causes a substantial change in the functional dependence of the volume pinning force. A model is presented, which describes the pinning force function of irradiated wires using a two-component ansatz involving a point-pinning contribution <b>stemming</b> from <b>radiation</b> induced pinning centers.

Methods: We simulated the skull shape as an ellipsoid with its center at the junction between the mammillary bodies and the brain <b>stem.</b> The <b>radiation</b> depths of the beamlets emitted from 201 collimators were calculated based on the relationship between this ellipsoid and a single beamlet expressed as a straight line.

40|$|Radiation {{exposure}} of humans generally results in low doses delivered at low dose rate. Our limited {{knowledge of the}} biological effects of low dose radiation is mainly {{based on data from}} the atomic bomb Life Span Study (LSS) cohort. However, the total doses and dose rates in the LSS cohort are still higher than most environmental and occupational exposures in humans. Importantly, the dose rate is a critical determinant of health risks <b>stemming</b> from <b>radiation</b> exposure. Understanding the shape of the dose-rate response curve for different biological outcomes is thus crucial for projecting the biological hazard from radiation in different environmental and man-made conditions. A significant barrier to performing low dose-rate studies is the difficulty in creating radiation source configurations compatible with long-term cellular or animal experiments. In this study the design and characterization of a large area, 125 I-based irradiator is described. The irradiator allows continuous long-term {{exposure of}} mice at variable dose rates and can be sited in standard animal care facilities. The dose rate is determined by the level of 125 I activity added to a large NaOH-filled rectangular phantom. The desired dose rate is maintained at essentially constant levels by weekly additions of 125 I to compensate for decay.

In order to address this fundamental question, in this essay we shall consider the zero-point quantum-gravity fluctuations of the black-hole spacetime. In a quantum theory of gravity, these spacetime fluctuations are closely related to the characteristic gravitational resonances of the corresponding black-hole spacetime.

40|$|With climate warming, shrubs {{have been}} {{observed}} to grow on Arctic tundra. Their presence is known to increase snow height {{and is expected to}} increase the thermal insulating effect of the snowpack. An important consequence would be the warming of the ground, which will accelerate permafrost thaw, providing an important positive feedback to warming. At Bylot Island (73 ° N, 80 ° W) in the Canadian high Arctic where bushes of willows (Salix richardsonii Hook) are growing, we have observed the snow stratigraphy and measured the vertical profiles of snow density, thermal conductivity and specific surface area (SSA) in over 20 sites of high Arctic tundra and in willow bushes 20 to 40  cm high. We find that shrubs increase snow height, but only up to their own height. In shrubs, snow density, thermal conductivity and SSA are all significantly lower than on herb tundra. In shrubs, depth hoar which has a low thermal conductivity was observed to grow up to shrub height, while on herb tundra, depth hoar only developed to 5 to 10  cm high. The thermal resistance of the snowpack was in general higher in shrubs than on herb tundra. More signs of melting were observed in shrubs, presumably because <b>stems</b> absorb <b>radiation</b> and provide hotspots that initiate melting. When melting was extensive, thermal conductivity was increased and thermal resistance was reduced, counteracting the observed effect of shrubs in the absence of melting.

30|$|Scanning {{transmission}} {{electron microscopy}} (STEM) has {{emerged as one of}} the foremost techniques to analyze materials at atomic resolution. However, two practical difficulties inherent to <b>STEM</b> imaging are: <b>radiation</b> damage imparted by the electron beam, which can potentially damage or otherwise modify the specimen and slow-scan image acquisition, which limits the ability to capture dynamic changes at high temporal resolution. Furthermore, due in part to scan flyback corrections, typical raster scan methods result in an uneven distribution of dose across the scanned area. A method to allow extremely fast scanning with a uniform residence time would enable imaging at low electron doses, ameliorating radiation damage and at the same time permitting image acquisition at higher frame-rates while maintaining atomic resolution. The practical complication is that rastering the STEM probe at higher speeds causes significant image distortions. Non-square scan patterns provide a solution to this dilemma and can be tailored for low dose imaging conditions. Here, we develop a method for imaging with alternative scan patterns and investigate their performance at very high scan speeds. A general analysis for spiral scanning is presented here for the following spiral scan functions: Archimedean, Fermat, and constant linear velocity spirals, which were tested for STEM imaging. The quality of spiral scan STEM images is generally comparable with STEM images from conventional raster scans, and the dose uniformity can be improved.|$|R
30|$|Muse cells {{exist in}} a {{quiescent}} state under normal physiological circumstances within the cellular niche prior to cellular stress disruption [24, 26]. Contributing to their capacity for self-renewal, multiple adult stem cell lineages {{have been shown to}} {{exist in a}} quiescent state, including hematopoietic stem cells and epithelial stem cells [42, 43]. The mobilization of quiescent stem cells is attributed to CXCL 2, a chemokine, which functions in stem cell homing [43]. Exposing MSCs to CXCL 2 prior to transplantation increases post-transplant stem cell survival rates in cases of myocardial infarction [44]. In the case of Muse-AT cells, CXCL 2 is expressed 770 folds higher than in neighboring ASCs, which could therefore explain their genetic predisposition to cellular stress resistance [22]. CXCL 2, overexpressed in cancer cells, contributes both to cancer cell survival and malignancy. Quiescence is the “natural” state in which Muse cells exist. On the other hand, quiescence contributes to the maintenance of malignancy in cancer stem cells in a dormant stage, susceptible to relapse in the wake of cancer treatment [36]. The internal/external stimuli that activate Muse cells (prolonged treatment with proteolytic enzymes, lack of nutrients, low temperatures, hypoxia) are entirely different than those that activate cancer <b>stem</b> cells (ionizing <b>radiation,</b> ultraviolet radiation, chemical compounds, reactive oxygen species, error prone DNA repair, among others).|$|R
40|$|Abstract To {{investigate}} the evolution and biogeography of an endemic group of South American foxes, we examined mitochondrial DNA control region sequences for 118 individuals belonging to all six extant {{species of the}} genus Lycalopex. Phylogenetic and molecular dating analyses supported the inference that this genus has undergone a very recent and rapid <b>radiation,</b> <b>stemming</b> from a common ancestor that lived ca. 1 million years ago. The Brazilian endemic L. vetulus was supported as the most basal species in this genus, whereas the most internal group is comprised by the recently diverged (ca. 350, 000 years ago) Andean/Patagonian species L. griseus and L. culpaeus. We discuss the inferred phylogenetic relationships and divergence times {{in the context of}} the current geographic distributions of these species, and the likely effects of Pleistocene climatic changes on the biogeography of this group. Furthermore, a remarkable finding was the identification of multiple individuals classified as L. gymnocercus bearing mtDNA haplotypes clearly belonging to L. griseus, sampled in regions where the latter is not known to occur. At a minimum, this result implies the need to clarify the present-day geographic distribution of each of these fox species, while it may also indicate an ongoing hybridization process between them. Future testing of this hypothesis with in-depth analyses of these populations is thus a priority for understanding the history, evolutionary dynamics and present-day composition of this endemic Neotropical genus...|$|R

40|$|In this study, we {{investigate}} the Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP) {{effect on the}} Hawking radiation from 2 + 1 dimensional New-type Black Hole by using the quantum tunnelling properties of a massive spin- 1 particle, i. e. a massive vector boson. In this connection, we use the modified massive vector boson equation based on the GUP. Afterward, using Kerner-Mann's quantum tunneling method, we calculate the tunnelling probabilities of the massive spin- 1 vector particle and subsequently the Hawking temperature of the black hole. Then, due to the GUP effect, we observe that the Hawking temperature of the black hole depends on not only the black hole properties, but also the AdS_ 3 radius defined as L^ 2 = 1 / 2 m^ 2 = 1 / 2 Λ {{in terms of the}} m graviton mass (or the Λ cosmological constant) and the properties of the tunnelling massive vector boson, such as energy, mass, charge and total angular momentum etc. According to relation between these properties of the vector boson, we see that the Hawking temperature increase by the total angular momentum of the tunneled particle while it decreases by the energy and mass of the tunnelled particle and the graviton mass. On the point of this result, the <b>radiation</b> <b>stemmed</b> from the tunnelled particle's mass and energy and the graviton mass screens the black hole radiation.

40|$|There is {{increasing}} evidence that glioblastoma possess ‘stem-like’ cells, low concentrations {{of which can}} initiate a tumour. It has been proposed that these cells are radioresistant, and that this property contributes to the poor treatment outcomes of these tumours. In this paper we propose that radioresistance is not simply an intrinsic characteristic of glioma stem cells but a result of interactions between these cells and microenvironmental factors, i. e. the ‘microenvironment – stem cell unit’. The critical role of the microenvironment, along with glioma stem cells, is supported directly or indirectly by the following observations: glioma stem cells {{have been shown to}} reside preferentially in specific niches, the characteristics of which are known to influence cellular responses to radiation; radiation modifies environmental factors; and, contrarily to the consistency of clinical data, in vitro experiments have reported a wide variety in the radiation response of these cells. The paper, therefore, focuses on the interaction between tumour stem cells and the microenvironment, analyzing how its various elements (endothelial cells, extracellular matrix, cytokines, nitric oxide, oxygen levels) are affected by radiation and how these might influence the response of tumour <b>stem</b> cells to <b>radiation.</b> Finally, we summarize the ongoing debate on the optimal culture conditions for glioma stem cells and the difficulties in designing assays that reliably characterize their radiation response. </p...|$|R
40|$|Assuming that {{spermatogonial}} multiplication in primates {{will not}} be fundamentally different from that in non-primates it can be deduced that Ap and Ad spermatogonia in primates are analogous to the undifferentiated spermatogonia in non-primates. Ap and Ad spermatogonia consist of single, pairs and chains of cells, among which the single cells likely are the stem cells. The single Ap are the active stem cells while the single Ad only become active after cell loss. After cell loss, Ad spermatogonia without division transform into Ap spermatogonia. The human testis is a very sensitive indicator of radiation. However, the full effect on <b>stem</b> cells of <b>radiation</b> or other insults will only become visible in the ejaculate after 3 to 5 months. When no cell loss is inflicted, damaged to Ad stem cells may remain hidden for years. Damage to spermatocytes and spermatids will become visible much earlier. However, these cells heavily depend on a normal Sertoli cell function. Hence, effects found on spermatocytes and spermatids {{may be caused by}} a direct action on these cells but also via a deteriorated Sertoli cell or Leydig cell function. The number of Sertoli cells per testis can only be affected by treatment before puberty. Leydig cell numbers can also be affected in the adult, but this cell population is more vulnerable when treatment takes place before adulthood. However, the functional capacity of the Leydig cell population as a whole only decreases after severe cell los...|$|R
40|$|Background: Adipose tissue derived mesenchymal {{stem cells}} (AT-MSCs) are {{relatively}} easy in isolation procedure compared to bone marrow-derived. Minimally invasive MSC injections need C-arm as guidance that potentially influence the cell viability and doubling time. This study aimsed {{to determine the}} effect of C-arm X-ray exposure on AT-MSC viability and population doubling time (PDT). Methods: This experimental study used cryopreserved adipose tissue derived MSCs stored in Stem Cell Medical Technology Integrated Service Unit Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital. Cells were thawed, propagated, and exposed to varying doses of C-arm X-ray <b>radiation.</b> <b>Stem</b> cell viability was measured, and then the cells were cultured to assess their PDT. Generalized linear models test was used to compare cell viability between post-thaw, post-propagation, post-radiation, post-culture post-radiation, and control and between radiation dose groups. Kruskal-Wallis test assessed PDT between various radiation doses in post-radiation groups. Wilcoxon test was used to assess PDT between pre-radiation and post-radiation groups. Results: Mean confluence period of adipose MSCs post- irradiation was 4. 33 days. There was no statistically significant difference in MSC viability after X-ray exposure between pre- and post-irradiation groups (p= 0. 831). There was no correlation between post-irradiation viability and radiation dose (p= 0. 138, r= 0. 503). There {{were no significant differences in}} PDT between pre- and post-culture post-irradiation groups and between various radiation doses in post-irradiation groups (p= 0. 792).   Conclusion: MSC viability and PDT were not influenced by radiation exposure up to 32. 34 mgray. </p...|$|R
