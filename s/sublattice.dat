The {{main part of}} the paper considers several interesting examples of positive operators on Banach lattices which do not have nontrivial closed invariant <b>sublattices.</b> These examples have been already outlined by the same authors [in Positivity IV—theory and applications, 73 – 77, Tech. Univ. Dresden, Dresden, 2006; MR 2243484 (2007 c: 47047) ]. In particular, operators without nontrivial closed invariant <b>sublattices</b> are given on l p (1 ≤ p < ∞) and on the Banach lattice of all continuous real functions on the unit circle. The authors also show some general results about (not necessarily closed) <b>sublattices</b> that are invariant under a given positive operator...|$|R

40|$|A lattice in Euclidean $d$-space {{is called}} well-rounded if it {{contains}} $d$ linearly independent vectors of minimal length. This class of lattices {{is important for}} various questions, including sphere packing or homology computations. The task of enumerating well-rounded <b>sublattices</b> of a given lattice is of interest already in dimension 2, and has recently been treated by several authors. In this paper, we analyse the question more closely {{in the spirit of}} earlier work on similar <b>sublattices</b> and coincidence site <b>sublattices.</b> Combining explicit geometric considerations with known techniques from the theory of Dirichlet series, we arrive, after a considerable amount of computation, at asymptotic results on the number of well-rounded <b>sublattices</b> up to a given index in any planar lattice.

40|$|The {{competition}} between spin glass (SG), antiferromagnetism (AF) and Kondo effect is studied {{here in a}} model which consists of two Kondo <b>sublattices</b> with a Gaussian random interaction between spins in different <b>sublattices</b> with an antiferromagnetic mean J 0 and standard deviation J. In the present approach there is no hopping of the conduction electrons between the <b>sublattices</b> and only spins in different <b>sublattices</b> can interact. The problem is formulated in the path integral formalism where the spin operators are expressed as bilinear combinations of Grassmann fields which can be solved at mean field level within the static approximation and the replica symmetry ansatz. The obtained phase diagram shows the sequence of phases SG, AF and Kondo state for increasing Kondo coupling.

40|$|MnWO 4 is {{regarded}} as a canonical example of multiferroic materials, where the multiferroic activity is caused by a spin-spiral alignment. We argue that, in reality, MnWO 4 has two sources of the spin-spirality, which conflict with each other. One is the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interactions, reflecting the P 2 /c symmetry of the lattice. The P 2 /c structure of MnWO 4 has an inversion center, that connects two Mn <b>sublattices.</b> Therefore, from the viewpoint of DM interactions, different Mn <b>sublattices</b> are expected to have opposite spin chirality. Another source is competing isotropic exchange interactions, which tend to form a spin-spiral texture with the same chirality in both magnetic <b>sublattices.</b> Thus, there is a conflict between DM and isotropic exchange interactions, which makes these two <b>sublattices</b> inequivalent and, therefore, breaks the inversion symmetry. Our theoretical analysis is based on the low-energy model, derived from the first-principles electronic structure calculations. Comment: 17 pages, 5 figure...|$|R
