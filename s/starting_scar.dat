50|$|After touring key summer festivals, My Favorite <b>Scar</b> <b>started</b> their fall tour in September 2010. Besides Dutch club stages, {{this tour}} {{included}} (inter)national support slots with US rock band Alter Bridge in Antwerp, Berlin and Amsterdam.|$|R
50|$|In 2004, Myre <b>started</b> The <b>Scar</b> Project. Begun as a {{personal}} exploration of her own scars, the project grew into a cooperative endeavor. She organized workshops for people {{to create their own}} scar canvases and write their personal stories. Participants are invited to sew their ‘scars’, metaphorical or literal, onto piece of 10″ square canvas and share the story of how they got hurt, by whom, and who they hurt and how. The Scar Project includes contributions by more than 1,400 people from Canada, the United States and Australia gathered over eight years.|$|R
50|$|Sometimes, {{students}} who did not fence would scar themselves with razors in imitation, and some would pull apart their healing cuts to exacerbate the scars, although this was generally frowned upon. Others paid doctors to slice their cheeks. The number and extremity of scars was reduced in more recent times, and the custom of obtaining dueling <b>scars</b> <b>started</b> to die off after the Second World War.|$|R
25|$|Hoy {{arrived in}} Athens {{in the form}} of his life. His main event was the Kilo Time Trial. He was ranked No 1 and was last man off. The sea level World Record was broken four times as he sat in the track centre waiting for his start. He had been {{involved}} in an accident in the athlete's village just a few days prior to competition where he came off his bike in front of a village bus, narrowly avoiding serious injury. As {{he came out of the}} <b>starting</b> gate, his <b>scarred</b> arms and legs showed how close he was to not competing.|$|R
40|$|Introduction: The aim of {{this study}} was to compare contact versus noncontact mapping for {{radiofrequency}} (RF) ablation of any sustained post-myocardial infarction (MI) ventricular tachycardia (VT). Methods: Forty patients with tolerated VT post-MI were randomized to RF ablation with contact (group 1) or noncontact (group 2) mapping systems. In both groups ablation of tolerated VT was guided by VT activation map confirmed by concealed entrainment. When untolerated VTs were induced, ablation was performed in group 1 according to pace mapping <b>starting</b> from the <b>scar</b> border zone and in group 2 according to the VT activation map confirmed by pace mapping. Results: No differences were seen between the groups in terms of acute success rate of clinical VT ablation (95...|$|R
30|$|Thimble bladder is {{commonly}} seen in genitourinary tuberculosis, especially after initiation of antitubercular treatment and frequently requires surgical treatment, either augmentation cystoplasty or urinary diversion [1]. Our patient developed total {{destruction of the}} bladder {{over a period of}} 6  weeks after initiation of anti-tubercular treatment. A similar case of primary genitourinary tuberculosis associated with severe progressive scarring and destruction of the left kidney with a contracted bladder, persistent vesicoureteral reflux and bulbar urethral stricture in which <b>scarring</b> <b>started</b> after initiation of medical therapy has been reported [2]. The doctors recommended close supervision after initiation of therapy for genitourinary tuberculosis. In the present case, lack of distension of the bladder secondary to urinary diversion of the solitary functioning kidney would have contributed to the process of vesical destruction.|$|R
40|$|Since 2003 more then 250 {{raspberry}} (Rubus idaeus) accessions {{were collected}} at FEM {{in order to}} generate a germplsam collection, which needed to be genotyped. To do so, ten new SNP markers were developed on 10 raspberry varieties, <b>starting</b> from <b>SCAR</b> markers transferred from diploid strawberries and apple (Sargent et al., 2007; Sargent et al., 2009). As results of sequencing analysis, new raspberry sequences of anthocyanidin synthase (ANS), lipoxygenase (LOX), ent‐kaurene oxydase (EKO), cynnamyl alcohol deydrogenase (CAD), exspansin (EXP), dihydroflavonol 4 ‐reductase (DFR), cytosolic ascorbate peroxidase (APX), spermine synthase (ACL 5), alpha amylase (AMY), maltose transporter (MEX), soluble inorganic pyrophosphatase (SIP), polyamine oxidase (PAO), pectate lyase (PL) enzyme regions were obtained and the polymorphisms presence was assessed. Finally, the germplasm genotyping was done on {{about half of the}} accessions number using the new markers. The data obtained were analysed with PowerMarker v. 3. 25, NTSY and STRUCTURE softwares to determine the genetic diversity of the whole collection and to obtain a preliminary cluster analysis. These molecular markers might be helpful not only for germplasm characterization but also, such as candidate genes, for mapping, synteny studies within the Rosaceae family and as a starting point functional to marker‐assisted selection for raspberry breeding programs...|$|R
40|$|A six-point {{programme}} for {{the prevention}} and pressure therapy of hypertrophic <b>scarring</b> <b>started</b> in 1975 at Odstock Hospital. The work reported here includes a pressure calibration of batches of the material chosen for pressure bandaging; a pressure study of the bandages on volunteers' limbs; {{and the formation of}} a pressure therapy clinic. The clinic results were similar to those reported by Thomson (1974) and were considered sufficiently favourable to justify continuing the clinic and instituting a policy of close review and early therapy for all burns patients. The programme proved the accuracy of the pressure sensor and attempted to develop an objective method of recording progress. Arguments for pressure versus occlusion as the therapeutic agent are discussed and supported by a case report. It is suggested that a controlled trial of pressure therapy should be carried out...|$|R
50|$|Yaichi (Yaichi) :Yaichi is {{a spirit}} {{that seems to}} follow around Karatsu if not {{outright}} possessing him. He may {{be the source of}} Karatsu's ability or at least be able to amplify it to a great extent. The most notable of Yaichi's features are the severe scars on his face and his long white hair. One <b>scar</b> <b>starts</b> at the center-top of the face and runs down between the eyes and then down the right side. It is met below the eye by another scar coming from the right ear. A third scar runs across the left cheek starting from the corner of the mouth. Though there is no direct interaction or awareness with the group, he often helps the group with warnings or taking over some of the body movement of various characters who feel his presence during that period.|$|R
40|$|Whether your liver is {{infected}} with a virus, injured by chemicals or {{under attack from}} your own immune system, the damage to your liver is likely to progress in a similar way. In {{the early stages of}} liver disease, your liver becomes inflamed. If left untreated, the inflamed liver will <b>start</b> to <b>scar.</b> As excess scar tissue grows, it replaces the healthy liver tissues. This process is called fibrosis. MBP 039 - 06, a natural product isolated and patented by Mitsubishi Pharmaceuticals, and dithiosilvatin a member of the epipolydithiodiketopiperazine alkoliod family, have evidence to indicate them as potential treatments for liver fibrosis. We report the total synthesis of MBP 039 - 06 and its absolute configuration, utilising the Lacey-Dieckrnann condensation. Both enantiomers were prepared, and comparison of CD spectra with those ofthe naturally isolated material have enabled its absolute configuration to be established. In addition we report the synthesis of a small library of tetramic acid analogues. In our investigation we have shown MBP 039 - 06 to be an effective inhibitor of HIP proyl hydroxylase. Inhibitors of this kind offer potential new therapies in ischaemic/ hypoxic disease. In {{the second part of the}} thesis we report our work completed towards the total synthesis of dithiosilvatin, concentrating on an unnatural amino acid approach to the synthesis. We have established routes to a range of bis protected dithiodiketopiperazines, an important intermediate in the synthesis of the epipolydithiodiketopiperazine core. In addition we have discovered and disclose the structure oftwo novel potent inhibitors of Lys 9 -specific histone methyltransferase G 9 a. Methyltransferases are misregulated in tumors and are involved in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
50|$|The film {{begins on}} a summer's day in Northern Canada 70 {{million years ago}} and herd of Edmontosaurus and a spiky Edmontonia are feeding on the lush {{vegetation}} that grows all around them. Scar, a young male Edmontosaurus, enjoys {{his life in the}} Arctic forests with his extended family, comes across a young immature male Troodon named Patch, who has been feasting on baby Edmontosaurus all summer, but now has to chase smaller, more difficult prey as the baby Edmontosaurus are too large to hunt. He chases after an Alphadon, but another clawed foot grabs the fleeing mammal; that of another Troodon, and Patch is becoming impatient. The plentiful food for Scar is ending as well, as the dark, cold Arctic winter is approaching. When night falls for the first time, Scar loses sign of the herd and spots a dark shape, which {{turns out to be a}} Gorgosaurus, which slices his face as he narrowly dodges the killer blow. Later, a herd of Pachyrhinosaurus arrives and starts to compete for the dwindling food supply, further pressuring the herd's search for food. Scar finds the Edmontonia feasting on insect larvae from a fallen tree branch and tries his luck with mixed success. The sun sets and the Pachyrhinosaur herd moves on somewhere else in search of food. The winter's approach causes the herbivores to start risking their safety and a young female Edmontosaurus gets killed by the Gorgosaurus as she wanders too far from the herd. The next day, the Edmontosaurus and Pachyrhinosaurus herds move south for the winter, while Edmontonia stays behind. She's way too heavy and her armoured body has been storing fat to last her through the lean months. Meanwhile, Patch and the Troodons are feasting on the dead female Edmontosaurus when the Gorgosaurus appears. The tyrannosaur scares the Troodons away, but is wounded in the fight, and Patch is frustrated and must work harder to find prey. Far away, the dinosaur herd is moving on, until Scar sees a dark shadows, which turns out to be a flock of scavenging Quetzalcoatlus, the biggest pterosaurs ever, which feed on the dying herd members that could not keep pace. The blizzard arrives and Scar collapses, but an older male arrives and helps him to keep moving through the blizzard. They continue on walking and don't realize they are heading into a trap; the ground breaks apart, meaning that they walked onto a frozen sea inlet. As the herd struggles to escape the icy water, several get dragged under by mosasaurs known as Prognathodon. Scar has never swum before, but he is pushed in and starts to swim for the shore. In the Arctic, Patch picks up a bone and heads back to his nest, which he has been building in the hopes of attracting a mate. Nearby, The Gorgosaurus finds the Edmontonia outside its lair, but the bite to its leg is badly infected and it goes back into the cave to wait for easier prey to wander close. A thousand miles away, the Edmontosaurus herd moves on through a volcanic ash field. Lying in wait, a pack of Albertosaurus sleeps until the herd is close enough to ambush. The feathered carnivores wake up and start to stalk the herd. Scar runs for his life while one of the predators is hot on his heels. During the attack, an avalanche of water, rock and mud caused by the eruption that follows the attack slides down the bank. Scar climbs up the cliff, but loses his courage, and the Albertosaurus, injured in the eruption, begins to close in. Just as Scar sees the avalanche, he rushes up the cliff while the Albertosaurus is swept to its seeming death. Back in the Arctic, Patch tries to impress the female by dancing only to lose out to a more experienced male and the Edmontonia has found a last leaf. Suddenly, the log it stands on breaks apart and the Edmontonia slides down the snow on her back and crashes into a snowdrift, utterly helpless. Far away from the Troodons, Scar tries to call for his family, but the only calls are the ones that didn't make it; the old male Edmontosaurus he has been traveling with and an injured female Pachyrhinosaurus. The Albertosaurus, having survived the mudslide, rises back to its feet and <b>starting</b> following <b>Scar's</b> trail again. Scar and the old Edmontosaurus walks on, but the older animal, suffering from a brain tumor, becomes more aggressive and nervous towards Scar, eventually even biting him. Scar sees the Albertosaurus first, and flees. The old bull Edmontosaur fights the predator until they both tumble over the cliff, locked in a deadly embrace. In the frozen north, Patch learns how to finally catch Alphadon by listening for them under the snow and comes across the overturned Edmontonia. He and several other Troodons attack the ankylosaur, but the Gorgosaurus, now fully healed of its injury, arrives and pulls the herbivore away from the smaller predators. Struggling, the Edmontonia gets back up and injures the Gorgosaurus with her shoulder spikes. The Gorgosaurus heads back to the cave, fatally wounded with a broken leg. As the sun rises the next morning, Scar is becoming weaker and the Quetzalcoatlus that follows senses it. The young dinosaur hears a rustling noise, which turns to be the injured female Pachyrhinosaurus instead. The pterosaur gives up and the ceratopsian herd arrives to cross the river. As they cross the river, groups of Prognathodon arrive and pull many of them underwater. Scar dives in while the mosasaurs continue their attack on the Pachyrhinosauruses. Scar eventually reaches the far bank and reunites with the Edmontosaurus herd, finally reaching safety. The sun eventually rises again and warmth begins to spread across the Arctic Circle. The Edmontonia is feasting on the budding greens and Patch manages to find a mate, offering scavenged meat from the dead Gorgosaurus. Soon, the Edmontosaurus will travel north again once summer begins to arrive to the north.|$|R
