However, the high cost to produce CNMs limits their usage. This work aims to decrease the cost of these materials by reducing the expenses associated with raw materials (using low-cost wastes) and with catalyst (using <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>meshes).</b> Samples of sugarcane bagasse, corn residue (DDGS), scrap tires, and post-consumer PET bottles were burned in a controlled atmosphere. The effluent gases were subjected to AISI 304 <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>meshes,</b> which worked as catalysts. The <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> decomposed the gaseous hydrocarbons into Csolid and H 2, resulting in a precipitation of carbon on the metal surface and leading to the formation of CNMs. The catalyst system decreases the gaseous emissions from the solid wastes burned, as showed by the gas chromatography. Scanning Electronic Microscopy (SEM) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) analysis were used to check structures of the formed materials. Results showed the formation of carbon nanomaterials with lengths of 20 μm to 50 μm and diameters in the range of 20 nm to 200 nm.

The S-IVB used the same J-2 engine design as the S-II {{and so it was}} decided that an igniter line problem had also stopped the third stage from reigniting in Earth orbit.

The variable parameters included fuel basket containment material (i. e., <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> wire <b>mesh</b> and sintered <b>stainless</b> <b>steel)</b> and applied electrical charge (i. e., 75 – 150 % of the theoretical charge for complete reduction of uranium oxide in a basket to uranium metal).
