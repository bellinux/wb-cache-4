5|$|The {{evolutionary}} {{relationships of}} the hardnose shark {{have not been}} fully resolved. In a 1988 study based on morphology, Leonard Compagno tentatively grouped the hardnose shark with the Borneo shark (C. borneensis), whitecheek shark (C. dussumieri), Pondicherry shark (C. hemiodon), creek whaler (C. fitzroyensis), smalltail shark (C. porosus), blackspot shark (C. sealei), and spottail shark (C. sorrah). Results from molecular phylogenetic analyses have been inconsistent, with some supporting parts of Compagno's hypothesis: a 1992 <b>study</b> <b>could</b> not resolve the hardnose shark's position in detail, a 2011 study reported that {{it was close to}} the clade formed by the whitecheek and blackspot sharks, and a 2012 study concluded that it was the sister species of the Borneo shark.|$|E

25|$|Scientists {{from the}} University of Exeter {{discovered}} that cell exposure to {{small amounts of}} hydrogen sulfide gas can prevent mitochondrial damage. When the cell is stressed with disease, enzymes are drawn into the cell to produce small amounts of hydrogen sulfide.

25|$|John H. Works, Jr., a Jefferson-Wayles {{descendant}} and a {{past president}} of the Monticello Association, a Jefferson lineage society, wrote that DNA tests indicated that any one of eight Jeffersons could have been the father of Eston. The team had concluded that Jefferson's paternity was the simplest explanation and consistent with historic evidence, but the DNA <b>study</b> <b>could</b> not identify Thomas Jefferson exclusively of other Jefferson males because no sample of his DNA was available.|$|E
25|$|Research {{published}} in 2003 on Y-chromosome marker variation, {{taken from a}} larger sample population and from more sites throughout Britain, came to a different conclusion. This study suggested that in most of England, continental (North German and Danish) paternal genetic input varied between 20% and 40%, with York forming an outlier at about 60%. Southern England, including Kent, had markedly lower frequencies of non-indigenous Y-chromosome markers than eastern England, where Danish Viking settlement is attested. However, the <b>study</b> <b>could</b> not distinguish between North German and Danish populations, thus the relative proportions of genetic input derived from the Anglo-Saxon settlements and later Danish Viking colonisation could not be ascertained.|$|E

30|$|Further {{research}} could investigate {{the impact of}} other coaching behaviours or how student athlete’s personality traits affect commitment to the coach. For example, future <b>studies</b> <b>could</b> consider the effect of coaches’ leadership style or competencies. Such studies would help to better define what contribute to student-athlete role-behaviour and performance.

25|$|Individuals with lightly {{pigmented}} skin who are repeatedly exposed to strong UV radiation, experience faster {{aging of the}} skin, which shows in increased wrinkling and anomalies of pigmentation. Oxidative damage causes the degradation of protective tissue in the dermis, which confers {{the strength of the}} skin. It has been postulated that white women may develop wrinkles faster after menopause than black women because they are more susceptible to the lifetime damage of the sun through life. Dr. Taylor, of Yale University School of Medicine, concluded that the <b>study</b> <b>could</b> not prove the findings but they suspect the underlying cause. Light-coloured skin has been suspected {{to be one of the}} contributing factors that promote wrinkling.|$|E
25|$|Francia {{abolished}} {{higher education}} {{on the grounds that}} it was the nation's financial priority to fund the army, and that private <b>study</b> <b>could</b> be freely conducted in his library. Francia closed the country's only religious seminary in 1822, mainly due to the bishop's mental illness (and from his purge of the power of the Church). Nevertheless, he made state education compulsory for all males in 1828, but he neither helped nor hindered the private schools. Even after this, the pupil-teacher ratio grew and there were less illiterate, with one teacher to 36 pupils by 1825 according to Richard Alan White. In 1836, Francia opened Paraguay's first public library, stocked with books confiscated from his opponents. Books were one of the few duty-free items (munitions being another).|$|E
25|$|Central Asia: In 2015, a study {{looked at}} 85,805 genetic markers of autosomal, {{maternal}} mitochondrial genome and paternal Y chromosome diversity in 4,676 purebred dogs from 161 breeds and 549 village dogs from 38 countries. Some dog {{populations in the}} Neotropics and the South Pacific are almost completely derived from European stock, and other regions show clear admixture between indigenous and European dogs. The indigenous dog populations of Vietnam, India, and Egypt show minimal evidence of European admixture, and exhibit indicators consistent with a Central Asian domestication origin, followed by a population expansion in East Asia. The <b>study</b> <b>could</b> {{not rule out the}} possibility that dogs were domesticated elsewhere and subsequently arrived in and diversified from Central Asia. Studies of extant dogs cannot exclude the possibility of earlier domestication events that subsequently died out or were overwhelmed by more modern populations.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to the dromaeosaurid leg, four irregularly-shaped stones with a diameter between fifteen and twenty millimetres {{were found in the}} abdomen, with no similar stones present in any other portions of the skeleton or embedded in the surrounding rock. The authors interpreted these as gastroliths (gizzard stones) similar to those found with Nqwebasaurus and Baryonyx. Other theropods, such as Caudipteryx and a Mongolian ornithomimid, were also found with gastroliths, though in those cases the stones were much more numerous and smaller in size. Ji and colleagues speculated that, since the later two dinosaurs were probably primarily herbivores, the number and size of gastroliths may correspond with diet; that is, herbivores ingested many small stones, while carnivores ingested only a few larger stones to aid in digestion. However, the 2012 <b>study</b> <b>could</b> find no gastroliths with the second specimen and therefore concluded that the stones with the holotype were swallowed by accident. In any case no special gizzard would have been present.|$|E
25|$|After {{finishing}} {{the work in}} middle school, she went to Putian high school. At this time, her mother finally accepted her studies because of her brilliant work in middle school and was happy with her accomplishments.However, she stayed in this school for only 1 year because of society’s situation. At that period, Japan started some small wars with China and killed many Chinese. A lot of students in this school were angry about that and held many parades to boycott Japan. But a lot of Japanese soldiers and spies stayed in China, so the parades were suppressed and some students were killed. Because of this, the <b>study</b> <b>could</b> not continue. So Lanying Lin transferred after one {{year in high school}} to a women’s school called Hami Lton School, which was founded by an American. One of her teachers came from American and could not speak Chinese very well, so many of her classmates could not understand his courses. Lanying helped the teacher as an assistant. So every time the teacher taught something in English, Lanying Lin would help to teach in Chinese. Because of this, she was called ‘little teacher’ by her classmates.|$|E
25|$|Asian {{black bears}} are close {{relatives}} to American black bears, {{with which they}} share a European common ancestor; the two species {{are thought to have}} diverged 3 million years ago, though genetic evidence is inconclusive. Both American and Asiatic species are considered sister taxa, and are more closely related to each other than other species of bear. The earliest American black bear fossils, which were located in Port Kennedy, Pennsylvania, greatly resemble the Asiatic species. The first mtDNA study undertaken on Asian black bears suggested that the species arose after the American black bears, while a second <b>study</b> <b>could</b> not statistically resolve the branching order of sloth bears and the two black species, suggesting that these three species underwent a rapid radiation event. A third study suggested that American black bears and Asian black bears diverged as sister taxa after the sloth bear lineage and before the sun bear lineage. Further investigations on the entire mitochondrial cytochrome b sequence indicate that the divergence of continental and Japanese black bear populations might have occurred when bears crossed the land bridge between the Korean peninsula and Japan 500,000 years ago, which is consistent with paleontological evidence.|$|E

2500|$|The {{anterior}} lateral eyes (ALE) {{have the}} best visual acuity and are the most complex of the secondary eyes. It {{has been shown that}} they are able to distinguish some details as well, and without them no [...] "looming response" [...] will be triggered by motion. Even with all the other pairs covered, jumping spiders in a <b>study</b> <b>could</b> still detect, stalk and attack flies, using the anterior lateral eyes only, which are also sufficiently widely spaced to provide stereoscopic vision.|$|E
2500|$|In September 2010, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) {{concluded}} after a [...] "comprehensive {{evaluation of}} recent toxicity data [...] that no new <b>study</b> <b>could</b> be identified, which {{would call for}} a revision of the current TDI". The Panel noted that some studies conducted on developing animals have suggested BPA-related effects of possible toxicological relevance, in particular biochemical changes in brain, immune-modulatory effects and enhanced susceptibility to breast tumours but considered that those studies had several shortcomings so the relevance of these findings for human health could not be assessed.|$|E
2500|$|Firstly, {{questionable}} research practices (QRP) {{have been}} identified as common in the field. [...] Such practices, while not necessarily intentionally fraudulent, involve converting undesired statistical outcomes into desired outcomes via the manipulation of statistical analyses, sample size or data management, typically to convert non-significant findings into significant ones. [...] Some studies have suggested that at least mild versions of QRP are highly prevalent. One of the critics of Daryl Bem in the feeling the future controversy has suggested that the evidence for precognition in this <b>study</b> <b>could</b> (at least in part) be attributed to QRP.|$|E
30|$|Due to {{the limited}} {{availability}} of research data, this paper only employed a cross-county dataset from 2007. Future <b>studies</b> <b>could</b> extend the time period and choose other cases. For other transmission mechanisms, future studies can discuss whether {{and to what extent}} resource rents affect the promotion opportunities of local officials, the rampancy of corruption, and the Gini coefficient of residents’ income. Since Shanxi’s local governments will eventually run out of coal resources, future <b>studies</b> <b>could</b> also address the questions of how the local industrial structure can be transformed, and how local governments can then collect enough revenue.|$|R

2500|$|From an mtDNA perspective, Richards et al. {{found that}} the {{majority}} of mtDNA diversity in Europe is accounted for by post-glacial re-expansions during the late upper Palaeolithic/ Mesolithic. [...] "The regional analyses lend some support to the suggestion that much of western and central Europe was repopulated largely from the southwest when the climate improved. The lineages involved include much of the most common haplogroup, H, as well as much of K, T, W, and X." [...] The <b>study</b> <b>could</b> not determine whether there were new migrations of mtDNA lineages from the near east during this period; a significant input was deemed unlikely.|$|E
2500|$|Before 1986, {{students}} {{who wanted to}} apply to UC for undergraduate <b>study</b> <b>could</b> only apply to one campus. Students who were rejected at that campus that otherwise met the UC minimum eligibility requirements were redirected to another campus with available space. Students who didn't want to be redirected were refunded their application fees. In 1986, that system changed to the current [...] "multiple filing" [...] system, in which students can apply to as many or as few UC campuses as they want on one application, paying a fee for each campus. This significantly {{increased the number of}} applications to the Berkeley and Los Angeles campuses, since students could choose a campus to attend after they received acceptance letters, without fear of being redirected to a campus {{they did not want to}} attend.|$|E
2500|$|The {{number of}} {{paralysis}} ticks required to paralyse a horse is unknown {{but in one}} study [...] there were cases of large horses with only one to two ticks being paralysed and unable to stand. Horses of any age and size can be affected by tick paralysis. In the same study, 26% of the horses died and of the surviving horses, 35% developed one or more complications including pressure sores, corneal ulcers, pneumonia and sepsis. The relatively high mortality rates in horses in this <b>study</b> <b>could</b> {{be due to a}} range of factors including horses being badly affected before vets are called, difficulties associated with nursing a recumbent horse, difficulties with owners needing to deliver the bulk of nursing care and lack of information to veterinarians managing the disease in horses.|$|E

30|$|To conclude, and as {{previously}} mentioned in Section 1, {{the shape and}} the size of the media to discriminate can make the segmentation difficult because of their impact on the photoacoustic signal. Consequently, further <b>studies</b> <b>could</b> be undertaken on datasets containing inclusions with different shapes and sizes. It could also be interesting to evaluate SSM-S behavior with mixed medium datasets. Finally, further <b>studies</b> <b>could</b> also be carried out using different liver samples with varying wait times in ambient air in order to determine how SSM-S could differentiate them. This might be of particular interest in forensic medicine to estimate the death time of the tissues.|$|R
30|$|As we have discussed, {{the theory}} of mixed embeddedness has a very broad perspective, {{covering}} a potentially limitless range of social, economic and institutional factors. In order to use the theory to guide our data collection and interpretation of our findings, we have focussed on a limited set of dimensions. Future <b>studies</b> <b>could</b> consider different or additional dimensions and consider how online home-based entrepreneurs are both influenced by and influence the dimensions considered. Finally, {{for the purposes of}} our study we have viewed different types of online home-based businesses broadly homogeneous. Future <b>studies</b> <b>could</b> look at the different opportunities and challenges offered by different types of online business for ethnic entrepreneurs.|$|R
