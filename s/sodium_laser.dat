50|$|Guide {{stars are}} also {{employed}} in adaptive optics. In this application, {{the star is}} not used to correct for {{the rotation of the}} Earth, but to correct for turbulence in the Earth's atmosphere. By measuring the observed motion of the guide star, and making minute distortions to the primary mirror, the telescope can produce images with much greater sharpness than is possible without adaptive optics. However, only about 1 percent of the night sky is close enough to a natural guide star to use adaptive optics, so various methods to create artificial laser guide stars have been developed, including the <b>sodium</b> <b>laser</b> system developed by the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and used by the University of California's Lick and Keck observatories.|$|E

The approach is robust and power scalable and satisfies the requirements for Multi Conjugate Adaptive Optics (MCAO) for current and future telescopes, including extremely large ground telescopes (ELTs). It is also adaptable for advanced design options.

The laser {{is part of the}} Lick Adaptive Optics (LAO) program, a joint project of the Lick Observatory and the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. LAO corrects for atmospheric turbulence either by using a natural guide star or by creating a <b>sodium</b> <b>laser</b> guide star, and using the observed motion of the guide star to direct distortion of a deformable mirror hundreds of times each second. The system produces images that are nearly equivalent to those obtained from space-based telescopes. Adaptive optics using natural guide stars has been in development since 1996, and using laser guide stars since 2001. Similar laser adaptive optics systems based on LAO have been installed on the University of California's two Keck telescopes in Hawaii.|$|E
40|$|A large telescope's {{adaptive}} optics (AO) system requires {{one or more}} bright artificial laser guide stars to improve its sky coverage. The recent advent of a high power <b>sodium</b> <b>laser</b> is perfect for such application. However, besides the output power, other parameters of the laser also {{have a significant impact}} on the brightness of the generated <b>sodium</b> <b>laser</b> guide star, mostly in non-linear relationships. When tuning and optimizing these parameters it is necessary to tune based on a laser guide star generation performance metric. Although return photon fluxis widely used, variability of the atmosphere and sodium layer makes it difficult to compare results from different sites or even within a short time period for the same site. A new metric, coupling efficiency, is adopted in our field tests.

Need for multiple laser guide stars on extremely large telescopes The unique advance to be made with an extremely large telescope (ELT), but also the greatest challenge, will be to obtain very high resolution, diffraction limited images for any scientific target. Tomography with multiple <b>sodium</b> <b>laser</b> guide stars is required, even for small fields, because of focal anisoplanatism (the cone effect). The same beacons will yield reconstructions of the wavefront aberration near the ground, allowing for correction of low-level turbulence over a wide field of view, and also of dynamic aberrations in the telescope optics. These are likely to be induced by wind in ELTs, with their enormous wind loading. ELT requirements for adaptive optics to the diffraction limit are daunting, if we are to go beyond correction of the isoplanatic patch around bright stars. The field in this case is small, since the integrated wavefront distortion depends sensitively on the direction of view.

40|$|Frequency {{doubling}} of an optically pumped vertical-external-cavity surface-emitting laser enables a new multiwatt tunable yellow-orange light source. Compact, tunable, high-power semiconductor lasers, particu-larly those covering the UV and visible {{regions of the}} spec-trum, are needed for many military and commercial appli-cations. Yellow-orange sources are particularly desirable for <b>sodium</b> guide-star <b>lasers,</b> quantum computing, and medical ap-plications. Semiconductor lasers in the visible region typically use one of two approaches: growth of a direct-band material with the proper energy gap, or frequency conversion of a near-IR source. Optically pumped vertical-external-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VECSELs) are strong, low-cost candidates to meet these critical features. In addition, {{easy access to the}} laser intracavity allows for new features, such as frequency doubling (also known as second-harmonic generation, SHG), linewidth narrowing, or quality switching (‘Q switching’), the produc-tion of a pulsed output beam. Compared to electrically pumped semiconductor lasers, optically pumped VECSELs have several advantages. For example, optical pumping is an easy way to achieve uniform pumping over a large area. In addition, us-ing a barrier-pumping scheme eliminates the sensitivity to the pump wavelength and allows the use of cheap, readily available pump sources. Since no doping is required, cavity loss can be minimized. The VECSEL gain structure can be accurately designed using a many-body microscopic quantum-design tool to max-imize pump absorption and improve both modal gain and high-power operation. 1 Combined with 3 D optical/thermal op-timization and gain-subcavity detuning, this allows for devel-opment of multiwatt sources emitting at various wavelengths...|$|R

If both surfaces are perfectly the same flatness and parallel to each other, no interference fringes will form. However, there is usually some air trapped between the surfaces. If the surfaces are flat, but a tiny optical wedge of air exists between them, then straight, parallel interference fringes will form, indicating the angle of the wedge (i.e.: more, thinner fringes indicate a steeper wedge while fewer but wider fringes indicate less of a wedge).

Among techniques that sense optical activity, FDCD provides superior detectability on an absolute scale because it is suitable for picoliter detection volumes. Optical activity signals were observed for riboflavin (LOD = 0. 2 fmol) and for less than 50 fmol of some fluorescein isothiocyanate-amino acid derivatives (FTC-amino acids) by FDCD/FL-CE...|$|R
40|$|AMOS CONFERENCE 2011 Precision {{tuned high}} power (~ 50 W) 589 nm {{generation}} {{for use in}} <b>laser</b> <b>sodium</b> guidestar generation is a key capability in today’s modern adaptive optical systems. The approached used is Sum-Frequency Generation (SFG) of 1319 nm and 1064 nm lines of Nd:YAG in an LBO crystal. High power narrow line sources are not commercially available, so low power narrow-band NPRO sources are mated with resonantly tuned high power ring lasers to achieve high power pumps. Efficient conversion of 589 nm requires high pump intensities within the LBO crystal, therefore a doubly-resonant ring cavity is used. Four implementations of the Pound-Drever-Hall method are applied to achieve these. Finally, precision wavelength tuning is required to generate the correct wavelength as measured by a Wavemeter and verified by a low pressure Na-cell. These multiple control loops are all interconnected, to some degree, with various physical requirements, constraints, and caveats. Like any worthwhile project, the systems integration of the control systems has been an educational endeavor.
