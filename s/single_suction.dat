40|$|Abstract—An {{analysis}} is performed {{to study the}} influence of nonuniform double slot suction on a steady laminar boundary layer flow over a rotating sphere when fluid properties such as viscosity and Prandtl number are inverse linear functions of temperature. Nonsimilar solutions have been obtained from {{the starting point of}} the streamwise co-ordinate to the exact point of separation. The difficulties arising at the starting point of the streamwise co-ordinate, {{at the edges of the}} slot and at the point of separation have been overcome by applying an implicit finite difference scheme in combination with the quasi-linearization technique and an appropriate selection of the finer step sizes along the stream-wise direction. The present investigation shows that the point of ordinary separation can be delayed by nonuniform double slot suction if the mass transfer rate is increased and also if the slots are positioned further downstream. In addition, the investigation reveals that double slot suction is found to be more effective compared to a <b>single</b> slot <b>suction</b> in delaying ordinary separation.

40|$|Summary. Recent {{investigations}} of laminar flow control for swept-wing boundarylayer flows provide promising results {{with respect to}} crossflow-transition delay using a technique called pinpoint suction. Strong, localized suction through holes accurately positioned {{with respect to the}} crossflow-vortex position can directly weaken the growth of secondary instabilities that are responsible for the final laminar breakdown. With our incompressible code N 3 D extremely resolved grids in wall-normal direction have to be used to obtain numerical convergence. In order to confirm the results with such strong, localized suction, a <b>single</b> <b>suction</b> hole has been simulated in a Blasius boundary layer with the N 3 D code and additionally with our compressible code NS 3 D. Results from grid studies carried out for both codes as well as a comparison of the compressible/incompressible results are provided. Incompressible simulations with various pinpoint suction scenarios in the swept-wing flow show the application of successful pinpoint suction.

This can be compared to CD = 0. 0235 for the best conventional streamlined body (Akron airship model). A total engine power coefficient has also been determined, Cp * = 0. 01585, while a conventional streamlined vehicle with stern wake propeller has a Cp * = 0. 0215, thereby showing a net gain of 26 %.

40|$|A model problem {{related to}} {{distributed}} receptivity to free-stream acoustic waves in laminar flow control (LFC) configurations is studied, within the Orr-Sommerfield framework, by a suitable {{extension of the}} Goldstein-Ruban theory for receptivity due to localized disturbances on the airfoil surface. The results, thus, complement the earlier work on the receptivity produced by local variations in the surface suction and/or surface admittance. In particular, we show that {{the cumulative effect of}} the distributed receptivity can be substantially larger than that of a <b>single,</b> isolated <b>suction</b> strip or slot. Furthermore, even if the receptivity is spread out over very large distances, the most effective contributions come from a relatively short region in vicinity of the lower branch of the neutral stability curve. The length scale of this region is intermediate to that of the mean of these two length scales. Finally, it is found that the receptivity is effectively dominated by a narrow band of Fourier components from the wall-suction and admittance distributions, roughly corresponding to a detuning of less than ten percent with respect to the neutral instability wavenumber at the frequency under consideration. The results suggest that the drop-off in receptivity magnitudes away from the resonant wavenumber is nearly independent of the frequency parameter...|$|R

The leading-edge separation was delayed and the linear portion of the lift curve substantially extended until the turbulent boundary layer separated from the rear portion of the airfoil. The abruptness of the stall was thereby reduced. The maximum lift increased with increasing flow through the slot, rapidly at first, then at a diminishing rate. The effect on pitching moment was negligible. The profile drag was increased for low values of lift and reduced at high values of lift (for flow coefficients greater than 0. 002) over the corresponding drag of the basic airfoil section. It was found that the slot location and width are important.

This study aimed to identify and quantify {{the extent of the}} problems using 25 DCUs, methodically eliminate these problems and develop an efficient approach for reliable, effective, automated disinfection. MethodsDCU suction system residual contamination by environmental and human-derived bacteria was evaluated by microbiological culture following standard aspiration disinfection with a quaternary ammonium disinfectant or alternatively, a novel flooding approach to disinfection. Disinfection of multicomponent suction handpieces, assembled and disassembled, was also studied. A prototype manual and a novel automated Suction Tube Cleaning System (STCS) were developed and tested, as were novel <b>single</b> component <b>suction</b> handpieces. ResultsStandard aspiration disinfection consistently failed to decontaminate DCU suction systems effectively. Semi-confluent bacterial growth (101 – 500 colony forming units (CFU) per culture plate) was recovered from up to 60 % of suction filter housings and from up to 19 % of high and 37 % of low volume suction hoses. Manual and automated flood disinfection of DCU suction systems reduced this dramatically (ranges for filter cage and high and low volume hoses of 0 – 22, 0 – 16 and 0 – 14 CFU/plate, respectively) (P< 0. 0001). Multicomponent suction handpieces could not be adequately disinfected without prior removal and disassembly. Novel single component handpieces, allowed their effective disinfection in situ using the STCS, which virtually eliminated contamination from the entire suction system. ConclusionFlood disinfection of DCU <b>suction</b> systems and <b>single</b> component handpieces radically improves disinfection efficacy and considerably reduces potential cross-infection and cross-contamination risks.

The authors assess whether aspiration of superficial layers of adipose tissue performed with a microcannula, rather than a standard cannula, allows for improved isolation of stromal and vascular cells, and they evaluate the angiogenic potential of the isolated cells in vitro and in vivo. Adipose-derived stromal and stem cells (ADSC) were collected from the lipoaspirate of the abdomen and hip regions of 6 healthy female donors. For adipose tissue harvest, several options were compared: (1) a rounded-tip cannula with a length of 170 mm, a diameter of 3 mm, and a <b>single</b> elliptic <b>suction</b> port on the side near its distal end (port diameter: 3 x 9 mm) or (2) a rounded-tip infiltration cannula with a length of 170 mm, a diameter of 2 mm, and 5 round ports placed spirally along the sides of the distal cannula shaft (each port diameter: 1 mm) (Shipper Medical Technologies Corporation, Centennial, Colorado). Isolated cells were characterized for (1) expression of the endothelial specific marker CD 31 by immunohistochemical and cytofluorimetric analyses and (2) tubular-like structure formation using a 3 -dimensional angiogenesis assay on Matrigel. Human ADSC were transduced to express firefly luciferase as a marker suitable for bioluminescent tracking and transplantation studies into immunosuppressed mice were performed. ADSC yield was determined to be significantly higher in samples collected with the microcannula (P =. 04). Moreover, isolated cells acquired typical endothelial-like morphology in vitro, formed capillary-like structures, and expressed the distinctive endothelial cell marker CD 31. Cells implanted into immunosuppressed mice persisted for several weeks in areas undergoing neovascularization.

Finally, the authors will explain the economic benefits that can be derived from a hydraulic rerate and how this type of work can be economically justified...|$|E
40|$|Lecturepg. 13 Following a brief {{description}} of the general suction performance of pumps and starting from an impeller designed for standard requirements, it will be discussed by which modifications and up to which limit the suction performance can be improved. In this context, it will be shown that the well-known measures ? e. g., enlargement of the impeller inlet diameter, reduction of the vane number or installation of an inducer ? may result in some restrictions concerning the possible operational range and may pose a risk of cavitation erosion. These undesirable consequences can, however, be avoided or at least moderated by modifications upstream of the impeller. The suction performance can also be improved by using double suction instead of <b>single</b> <b>suction</b> pumps. It is explained why the resulting improvement may not be as substantial as could be assumed at a first glace. Pumps with inlet velocities exceeding 25 to 30 m/s that are expected to run for 10, 000 hr and more without cavitation damage cannot operate at NPSH values corresponding to a 3. 0 percent head drop, even if a highly cavitation-resistant material is used. It is demonstrated that the design parameters of their impellers differ from those used for ?normal? impellers. If NPSHA is not sufficient, a booster pump has to be provided, or the rotational speed has to be reduced. As the latter is an expensive alternative, the question arises what the minimum booster pump head is. Some information regarding this issue is given. It will also be demonstrated that there is an upper limit of the rotational speed of the main pump beyond which can economical solution is impossible...|$|E
40|$|Vision {{requires}} the photoreceptors {{in the eye}} to rapidly respond to changes in light intensity. These processes are accomplished within rod photoreceptors by the visual pigment rhodopsin that initiates a downstream signaling cascade called phototransduction. Rhodopsin is composed of an apoprotein opsin that is covalently bonded with light sensitive 11 -cis retinal. Rhodopsin is activated when 11 -cis retinal is photoisomerized into all-trans retinal. This isomerization initiates the phototransduction cascade that culminates in a change in current at the plasma membrane. Rhodopsin, once activated ("bleached"), can no longer absorb photons to activate phototransduction, and must be regenerated through the visual cycle. 	To enable the photoreceptors to respond to rapid changes in light intensities, phototransduction must terminate in a timely manner. Deactivation involves phosphorylation of activated rhodopsin by rhodopsin kinase, and then binding of visual arrestin. Exposing rods to daylight bleaches {{a large proportion of}} rhodopsin molecules. This exposure leads to desensitization of the photoreceptors and phosphorylation of bleached rhodopsin. Full recovery of receptor sensitivity is achieved when rhodopsin is recycled and regenerated through a series of steps to its ground state. The last step in this process is the dephosphorylation of rhodopsin. This dissertation focuses on how rhodopsin dephosphorylation affects rod sensitivity. I exploited a novel observation; mouse retinae when isolated from the retinal pigment epithelium (and eye cup), display blunted rhodopsin dephosphorylation. Isoelectric focusing followed by Western blot analysis of retinal homogenate from bleached isolated retinae showed little dephosphorylation of rhodopsin for up to four hours in darkness, even under conditions when rhodopsin was completely regenerated. Microspectrophotometric measurements of rhodopsin spectra show that regenerated phospho-rhodopsin has the same molecular photosensitivity as unphosphorylated rhodopsin and that flash responses measured by trans-retinal electroretinogram or <b>single</b> cell <b>suction</b> electrode recording displayed dark-adapted kinetics. Single quantal responses displayed normal dark-adapted kinetics, but rods were only half as sensitive as those containing exclusively unphosphorylated rhodopsin. I propose a revised model in which light-exposed retinae contain a mixed population of phosphorylated and unphosphorylated rhodopsin. Moreover, complete dark-adaptation can only occur when all rhodopsin has been dephosphorylated, a process that requires more than three hours in complete darkness...|$|R
40|$|Lecturepg. 109 This paper {{describes}} the successful application of cavitation flow visualization to redesign the impeller of an 8. 5 -MW (11, 400 hp) high energy double <b>suction</b> <b>single</b> stage boiler feedpump. Dual {{purpose of the}} investigation was to develop an impeller/pump case combination showing significantly less cavitation at the impeller leading-edges than the original design, and realize specific rate objectives for meeting new duty points to eliminate high pressure throttling over the discharge valve. New impeller designs were tested in a full scale model test pump running at reduced speed, which was equipped with an acrylic viewing window for direct observation of the impeller blade cavitation. Elements of the experimental effort included determination {{of the effect of}} impeller (vane) design changes, along with the effect of suction box changes introduced at the splitter vanes. Initially, a total of four alternative impeller designs were considered, form which potentially best design was selected and tuned to specification. The new impeller design developed typically had sharp elliptic leading-edges to overcome the cavitation problem. Compared with the original design, in which impellers were replaced/repaired after less than one year of operation, the new impeller lifetime was calculated to be improved by at least a factor of eight, on the basis of cavitation bubble length. The NPSH required for the new design proved to be much better than for the original design, and, additionally the efficiency was established to be improved by one to two percent. Furthermore, a suction box splitter vane modification has led to less (cavitation) bubble activity in the eye area...|$|R
40|$|Lecturepg. 85 A {{systematic}} {{investigation was}} started within the Texas Utilities Generating Company Power station feedwater pump systems due to unsatisfactory unit availability, frequent equipment breakdown, high maintenance costs, and high replacement parts costs. This action was greatly encouraged by successful corrective {{actions taken by}} other utilities [1, 2, 3], results of failure surveys across the U. S. A [4, 5), and systematic long range research and development, field testing and troubleshooting by the authors, and close cooperation and exchange of ideas and results with at least on oil company [6]. A total of 36 pumps was modified in the Texas Utilities system as described in this paper. This included 16 boiler feed pumps (BFP), 7 high pressure (HP) booster pumps, 6 low pressure (LP) booster pumps, and 7 other pump applications. The operating behavior of all pumps improved exactly as expected, {{with the exception of}} one high pressure booster pump, which is described as a special case, with the emphasis on the importance or re-assembly and maintenance procedures. The power plants and the type of pumps involved in this investigation and corrective design changes are reflected in Table 1. Basically, we have to distinguish between multistage boiler feed pumps (or process pumps) and <b>single</b> stage double <b>suction</b> booster pumps (or condensate, ash sluice, circulating, cooling water, etc) because the same hydraulically induced instability problem manifests itself in a very different way through the type of vibrations we experience and measure. Single stage pumps usually show a herby axial vibration mode of the rotor, while multistage pumps show radial response, although the origin of the excitation is the same...|$|R
