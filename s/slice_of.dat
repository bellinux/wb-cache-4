5|$|Borscht, {{like any}} other soup in East Slavic cuisines, is seldom eaten by itself, but rather {{accompanied}} by a side dish. At a minimum, spoonfuls of borscht are alternated with bites of a <b>slice</b> <b>of</b> bread. Buckwheat groats or boiled potatoes, often topped with pork cracklings, are other simple possibilities, but a range of more involved sides exists as well.|$|E
5|$|For presentation, one {{suggestion}} is that the pilchards be arranged with their tails toward {{the centre of the}} pie and their heads poking up through the crust around the edge. As it includes potatoes and pastry, the pie can be served on its own or with crusty bread, sometimes with vegetables. Other suggested accompaniments are Cornish Yarg cheese, rhubarb chutney, poached eggs or a <b>slice</b> <b>of</b> lemon.|$|E

The scene was replaced with the family cheering Homer on while he is in intensive care.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{ingredients}} of the BLT have existed for many years, {{there is little evidence}} of BLT sandwich recipes prior to 1900. In the 1903 Good Housekeeping Everyday Cook Book, a recipe for a club sandwich included bacon, lettuce, tomato, mayonnaise and a <b>slice</b> <b>of</b> turkey sandwiched between two slices of bread. Whilst the 1929 book Seven Hundred Sandwiches does include a section on bacon sandwiches, the recipes often include pickles and none contain tomato.|$|E

A <b>slice</b> <b>of</b> pizza {{had been thrown}} at Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson by Cesc Fàbregas, which was {{initially}} unconfirmed until 13 years after the incident. Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger was furious in his post-match briefing, criticising Riley for his performance and describing Van Nistelrooy as a cheat. His comments were investigated by the Football Association, who later fined him £15,000 for improper conduct. Van Nistelrooy was retroactively banned for three matches as his challenge on Cole was missed by Riley.|$|E
5|$|Many fungi {{have been}} used as folk {{medicines}} around the world, including in Europe and in India where traditions are well documented. Some have been found to have useful active ingredients, though these do not always correspond with traditional uses of the fungi concerned. Ergot and various cereal smuts, such as Ustilago tritici (wheat grain smut) were used for disorders of pregnancy. Yeasts, made into a boiled paste with wheat flour, were used in India to treat fevers and dysentery. Wounds were treated in Europe with moulds, using for example a <b>slice</b> <b>of</b> mouldy bread or mouldy wheat straw, with active ingredients patulin and other penicillin-like compounds.|$|E
5|$|Our perceptual {{experiences}} {{depend on}} stimuli that arrive at our various sensory organs from the external world, and these stimuli cause {{changes in our}} mental states, ultimately causing us to feel a sensation, which may be pleasant or unpleasant. Someone's desire for a <b>slice</b> <b>of</b> pizza, for example, will tend to cause that person to move his or her body in a specific manner and in a specific direction to obtain {{what he or she}} wants.

5|$|A fluffernutter {{is made by}} {{spreading}} peanut butter on a <b>slice</b> <b>of</b> bread, then spreading {{an equal amount of}} marshmallow fluff on another slice and finally combining them to form a sandwich. Variations of the recipe include wheat bread instead of white, Nutella hazelnut spread instead of or in addition to peanut butter, and the addition of sweet ingredients like bananas or savory and salty ingredients like bacon. The Fluffernutter itself is often seen as a variation on the peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Though often seen as a food for children, the Fluffernutter recipe has been adapted to appeal to adult tastes. For example, a New York caterer serves a Fluffernutter hors d'oeuvre in a toasted ice cream cone with a spoon of peanut butter and torched marshmallow fluff on top.|$|E
5|$|Developmental stages began for {{the film}} midway through the series' first season {{production}} in January 1998. Co-creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone signed a deal with Comedy Central in April 1998 that contracted the duo to producing South Park episodes until 1999, gave them a <b>slice</b> <b>of</b> the lucrative spinoff merchandising the show generated within its first year, {{as well as an}} unspecified seven-figure cash bonus to bring the show to the big screen, in theaters. A large part of Parker and Stone's conditions attached to any potential movie project was that it must at least be R-rated, {{to keep in touch with}} the series' humor and its roots, the short The Spirit of Christmas. Parker stated that their desire was to approach the film from a much more creative perspective and do something other than a simple movie-length version of a regular episode. Despite alleged pressure from Paramount Pictures officials to keep the movie toned down, the two won the battle for a more mature rating.|$|E

5|$|During {{the summer}} of 1802, Wrexham was visited by a troupe of {{travelling}} comedians. One of the leaders, who had heard Randles play, requested that she performed with them. Before the age of two, she joined the troupe at Wrexham theatre to play Ar hyd y nos and The Downfall of Paris. There, she played her pieces with an apple and <b>slice</b> <b>of</b> cake {{on either side of}} the piano, receiving both when she finished for playing well. Over the next nine months, Randles played at the houses of Sir Watkin Williams-Wynn, Lady Dungannon and Lady Cunliffe. Williams-Wynn proposed that Randles play in a Wrexham concert during the spring of 1803, under the direction of the Welsh harpist John Parry. The concert was postponed a number of times due to the illness of Randles' mother, who insisted they carry on without her. On the night of the concert, Randles' mother died, after hearing that it was a success.|$|E
5|$|It was in {{the later}} medieval era that the borders of Scotland reached {{approximately}} their modern extent. The Isle of Man fell under English control in the 14th century, despite several attempts to restore Scottish authority. The English were able to annexe a large <b>slice</b> <b>of</b> the lowlands under Edward III, but these losses were gradually regained, particularly while England was preoccupied with the Wars of the Roses (1455–85). In 1468 the last great acquisition of Scottish territory occurred when James III married Margaret of Denmark, receiving the Orkney Islands and the Shetland Islands in payment of her dowry. However, in 1482 Berwick, a border fortress and the largest port in medieval Scotland, fell to the English once again, for {{what was to be}} the final change of hands.|$|E
5|$|McCrane had {{to spend}} hours in makeup {{in order to get}} the right effect and his eyes were colored with {{specially}} made contact lenses. Many of the scenes were physically exerting. The autopsy scene involved McCrane positioning himself through a hole in the table and sitting perfectly still, giving the illusion of a disembodied head. The scene in the bathtub required McCrane to spend several minutes motionless underwater. The shot in which a new Betts emerges from the old one's mouth was created by Toby Lindala. Lindala used shots of McCrane intercut with shots of a puppet with full-functioning mouth and eyes. Laverne Basham and Lindala were later both nominated for an Emmy for Outstanding Makeup in a Series. In addition, the machine that created a <b>slice</b> <b>of</b> Betts' head was designed by Ken Hawryliew.|$|E

50|$|The Interactive Decision Maps {{technique}} {{is based on}} approximating the Edgeworth-Pareto Hull (EPH) of the feasible objective set, that is, the feasible objective set broadened by the objective points dominated by it.

5|$|Optical {{coherence}} tomography (OCT) is {{a medical}} imaging technique using low-coherence interferometry to provide tomographic visualization of internal tissue microstructures. As seen in Fig.22, {{the core of a}} typical OCT system is a Michelson interferometer. One interferometer arm is focused onto the tissue sample and scans the sample in an X-Y longitudinal raster pattern. The other interferometer arm is bounced off a reference mirror. Reflected light from the tissue sample is combined with reflected light from the reference. Because of the low coherence of the light source, interferometric signal is observed only over a limited depth of sample. X-Y scanning therefore records one thin optical <b>slice</b> <b>of</b> the sample at a time. By performing multiple scans, moving the reference mirror between each scan, an entire three-dimensional image of the tissue can be reconstructed. Recent advances have striven to combine the nanometer phase retrieval of coherent interferometry with the ranging capability of low-coherence interferometry.|$|E
5|$|The Ostrogoths {{were soon}} reunited {{under the command}} of King Totila and {{captured}} Rome in 546. Belisarius, who had been sent back to Italy in 544, was eventually recalled to Constantinople in 549. The arrival of the Armenian eunuch Narses in Italy (late 551) with an army of 35,000 men marked another shift in Gothic fortunes. Totila was defeated at the Battle of Taginae and his successor, Teia, was defeated at the Battle of Mons Lactarius (October 552). Despite continuing resistance from a few Gothic garrisons and two subsequent invasions by the Franks and Alemanni, the war for the Italian peninsula was at an end. In 551, Athanagild, a noble from Visigothic Hispania, sought Justinian's help in a rebellion against the king, and the emperor dispatched a force under Liberius, a successful military commander. The empire held on to a small <b>slice</b> <b>of</b> the Iberian Peninsula coast until the reign of Heraclius.|$|E
