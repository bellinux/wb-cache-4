Expressing these probe molecules in glial cells is expected to enable observation and manipulation of glial cell activity, leading to elucidate the behaviors and causal roles of glial cells. The first step toward understanding glial cell functions is to express the probes in sufficient amounts, and the Knockin-mediated ENhanced Gene Expression (KENGE) -tet system provides a strategy for achieving this.

The cranial pia mater joins with the ependyma, which lines the cerebral ventricles to form choroid plexuses that produce cerebrospinal fluid.

30|$|Despite these {{interesting}} findings, {{the study}} has several limitations. First, although increased TSPO {{has been found}} in several CNS disorders with localized or widespread neuroinflammation, its cellular localization is not specific activated microglia, which are arguably viewed as the major source of cytokines in the brain. For example, TSPO is also found in astrocytes, including especially high densities in astroglyosis or scars that appear to have no currently active inflammatory processes [42]. In addition, immunohistochemical studies have found that TSPO is associated with vascular endothelium [43]. Although immunohistochemistry lacks the resolution to separate vascular endothelium from the immediately adjacent foot <b>processes</b> <b>of</b> <b>astrocytes,</b> this component <b>of</b> total TSPO binding is certainly not microglial in origin.|$|R

40|$|The {{expression}} of plasminogen and plasminogen activators (PG/PAs) in reactive astrocytes was examined following scratch injury. In response to injury, casein-degrading activity could be observed around astrocytes. The protein {{expression of}} {{tissue-type plasminogen activator}} (tPA) was up-regulated, while the free form of urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) was not detected. Consistent with these findings, results obtained with zymograph assay also revealed that tPA activity, but not uPA activity, was up-regulated. Moreover, the addition of 6 -amino-caproitic acid (EACA) to casein-covered astrocytes significantly prevented the recovery <b>of</b> the injured <b>astrocytes</b> in a dose-dependent manner. Taken together, our data demonstrate that the expression of PG/PAs in cultured astrocytes is regulated following injury, suggesting that caseinolytic activity is an essential component during the <b>process</b> <b>of</b> <b>astrocyte</b> recovery.

40|$|Corticobasal {{degeneration}} (CBD) is a rare, progressive {{neurological disorder}} characterized by widespread neuronal and glial pathology. Using immunohistochemistry and laser confocal microscopy, we {{demonstrate that the}} nonamyloid cortical plaques of CBD are actually collections of abnormal tau in the distal <b>processes</b> <b>of</b> <b>astrocytes.</b> These glial cells express both vimentin and CD 44, markers <b>of</b> <b>astrocyte</b> activation.

40|$|The {{last decade}} has {{presented}} studies providing evidence for astrocytic exocytosis of glutamate potentiating nerve signals. To make further investigations into this astrocytic attribute we investigated the localization of the vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (VGLUT 1) in small <b>processes</b> <b>of</b> <b>astrocytes</b> close to glutamatergic terminals in frontal cortex, striatum, molecular layer of hippocampus and stratum radiatum of hippocampus. According {{to the importance}} of VGLUT 1 in glutamate exocytosis the presence of VGLUT 1 in astrocytic processes indicates the ability to exocytose glutamate. METHODS: For qualitative analysis we used immunoflourescence histochemistry. Sections from rat frontal cortex, striatum, molecular layer of hippocampus and stratum radiatum of hippocampus were labeled with antibodies against glutamine synthetase (an astrocytic marker) and VGLUT 1. Z-stacks of 4. 5 - 5 lm obtained by confocal microscopy from each section were deconvolved and 3 D reconstructed in Amira. Small astrocytic processes were analysed for the presence of VGLUT 1 inside the processes. The quantitative analysis was done by immunogold labeling. Ultrathin sections from each brain region were labeled for GLT (an astrocytic marker) and VGLUT 1. Pictures obtained by electron microscopy were analysed and the point density (gold particles/nm 2) for VGLUT 1 in astrocytic processes was measured. RESULTS: Using confocal 3 D reconstructions we were qualitatively able to identify VGLUT 1 within small <b>processes</b> <b>of</b> <b>astrocytes</b> in all four brain regions. Reflecting our qualitative findings the electron microscopical immunogold quantifications showed a significant density of gold particles signaling VGLUT 1 in astrocytic processes in all four brain regions. CONCLUSION: We extend the results of previous studies on glutamate release from astrocytes, which have focused on the hippocampus, proposing that astrocytic exocytosis of glutamate is a global phenomenon in the brain...|$|R
40|$|Increasing {{evidence}} indicates {{the importance of}} neuron-glia communication for synaptic function, but the mechanisms involved are not fully understood. We reported that the EphA 4 receptor tyrosine kinase is in dendritic spines of pyramidal neurons of the adult hippocampus and regulates spine morphology. We now show that the ephrin-A 3 ligand, which {{is located in the}} perisynaptic <b>processes</b> <b>of</b> <b>astrocytes,</b> is essential for maintaining EphA 4 activation and normal spine morphology in vivo. Ephrin-A 3 -knockout mice have spine irregularities similar to those observed in EphA 4 -knockout mice. Remarkably, loss of ephrin-A 3 or EphA 4 increases the expression of glial glutamate transporters. Consistent with this, glutamate transport is elevated in ephrin-A 3 -null hippocampal slices whereas Eph-dependent stimulation of ephrin-A 3 signaling inhibits glutamate transport. Furthermore, some forms of hippocampus-dependent learning are impaired in the ephrin-A 3 -knockout mice. Our results suggest that the interaction between neuronal EphA 4 and glial ephrin-A 3 bidirectionally controls synapse morphology and glial glutamate transport, ultimately regulating hippocampal function...|$|R

40|$|Astrocytes, a {{prominent}} cell {{type in the}} brain, are receiving more and more attention from many neuroscientists. Astrocytes undergo a rather enigmatic <b>process</b> <b>of</b> activation in many pathological situations affecting the brain or spinal cord. These include CNS trauma, stroke, brain tumors or neurodegenerative diseases. A hallmark <b>of</b> <b>astrocyte</b> activation is upregulation of intermediate filaments (IFs), {{a part of the}} cytoskeleton. IFs are made of many IF proteins depending on the cell type, cell activation status and developmental stage of the organism. The role of IFs in unchallenged or reactive astrocytes has been unknown. To study the role of astrocytic IFs in normal and pathological conditions, we have utilized mice deficient in astrocytic IF proteins, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and/or vimentin. Combined biochemical, morphological and ultrastructural analyses <b>of</b> <b>astrocytes</b> from these mice allowed us to define the partnership rules for astrocytic IF proteins. GFAP-/-vimentin-/- mice are devoid of astrocytic IFs in reactive astrocytes in vivo and in vitro. GFAP-/-vimentin-/- mice exhibited impaired glial scar formation following brain or spinal cord injury. This points to upregulation of astrocytic IFs as a crucial event in the <b>process</b> <b>of</b> <b>astrocyte</b> activation. Two in vitro studies offered potential explanation for the above finding. GFAP-/- <b>astrocytes</b> were incapable <b>of</b> inducing blood-brain barrier properties in endothelial cells, and the absence of IFs led to a major defect in astrocyte motility. The latter finding suggests regulation of cell motility as a new function for IFs. IF-free astrocytes were also found to respond abnormally to hypotonic stress, a condition resembling cytotoxic edema in stroke, which implies the role <b>of</b> IFs in <b>astrocyte</b> volume regulation...|$|R

Acute NMO attacks usually are treated with high dose intravenous corticosteroid pulse and plasmapheresis. Maintenance therapy is also required to avoid further attacks and it is based on low-dose oral corticosteroids and non-specific immunosuppressant drugs, like azathioprine and mycophenolate mofetil.

40|$|Abstract. A {{young male}} Bernese {{mountain}} dog presented with neurologic abnormalities consisting of nonambulatory tetraparesis, generalized tremors, and depressed mental status. At necropsy only a mild {{enlargement of the}} lateral ventricles was seen. The histologic examination revealed the presence of eosinophilic deposits consistent with Rosenthal fibers (RFs) throughout the white matter of the central nervous system. There was also a marked proliferation <b>of</b> abnormally large <b>astrocytes</b> and limited myelin changes. RFs were most prominent in perivascular, subpial, and subependymal areas, where they were perpendicularly located, producing a pallisaded arrangement. Immunohistochemically, RFs were strongly positive for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), {{and when they were}} examined ultrastructurally they appeared as electron-dense amorphous masses located within the <b>processes</b> <b>of</b> <b>astrocytes,</b> most particularly in the perivascular feet.

Recent studies suggest a role <b>of</b> <b>astrocytes</b> in neuronal development. However, the mechanisms involved in the regulation <b>process</b> <b>of</b> <b>astrocytes</b> from FXS remain unclear. In this study, we found that astrocytes derived from a Fragile X model, the Fmr 1 knockout (KO) mouse which lacks FMRP expression, inhibited the proper elaboration <b>of</b> dendritic <b>processes</b> <b>of</b> neurons in vitro. Furthermore, astrocytic conditioned medium (ACM) from KO astrocytes inhibited proper dendritic growth of both wild-type (WT) and KO neurons. Inducing expression of FMRP by transfection of FMRP vectors in KO astrocytes restored dendritic morphology and levels of synaptic proteins. Further experiments revealed elevated levels of the neurotrophin- 3 (NT- 3) in KO ACM and the prefrontal cortex of Fmr 1 KO mice. However, the levels of nerve growth factor (NGF), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), and ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) were normal.

Synapses are enveloped with intricate <b>processes</b> <b>of</b> <b>astrocytes</b> known as perisynaptic astrocytic processes (PAPs). PAPs are motile structures displaying rapid actin-dependent movements and are characterized by Ca²⁺ elevations in response to neuronal activity. Despite a debated implication in synaptic plasticity, the role of both Ca²⁺ events in astrocytes and PAP morphological dynamics remain unclear. Results In the hippocampus, we found that PAPs show extensive structural plasticity that is regulated by synaptic activity through astrocytic metabotropic glutamate receptors and intracellular calcium signaling. Synaptic activation that induces long-term potentiation caused a transient PAP motility increase leading to an enhanced astrocytic coverage of the synapse. Selective activation of calcium signals in individual PAPs using exogenous metabotropic receptor expression and two-photon uncaging reproduced these effects and enhanced spine stability. In vivo imaging in the somatosensory cortex of adult mice revealed that increased neuronal activity through whisker stimulation similarly elevates PAP movement. This in vivo PAP motility correlated with spine coverage and was predictive of spine stability. Conclusions This study identifies a novel bidirectional interaction between synapses and astrocytes, in which synaptic activity and synaptic potentiation regulate PAP structural plasticity, which in turn determines {{the fate of the}} synapse.

40|$|Multiple {{sclerosis}} (MS) is a {{demyelinating disease}} of the central nervous system, causing neurological disabilities in young adults. Remyelination is the process in which lost myelin sheaths are restored along demyelinated axons. This is necessary to restore saltatory conduction and, more importantly, to prevent axonal loss. Remyelination does occur is MS, but ultimately fails as the disease progresses. The failure of remyelination is likely mediated by many factors, including the extracellular signalling environment. Expression of the extracellular matrix protein fibronectin (Fn) is transiently increased in areas of demyelination and its expression declines as remyelination proceeds. In chronically demyelinated lesions, where remyelination fails, Fn expression persists {{in the form of}} aggregates. These aggregates are most likely formed in the <b>process</b> <b>of</b> astrogliosis. Fn aggregates impair remyelination in animal models and may also contribute to remyelination failure in MS. In vitro, stimulation <b>of</b> <b>astrocytes</b> with the TLR 3 agonist Poly I:C or with the TLR 4 agonist LPS induces Fn aggregation. In this study we focused on astrocyte mediated Fn aggregation upon stimulation with Poly I:C and the role of integrins in this process. Using integrin-blocking antibodies, we demonstrated that astrocyte adhesion to Fn was mediated by β 1 and αVβ 5, but not by β 3. Stimulation <b>of</b> the <b>astrocytes</b> with Poly I:C did not influence their adhesion to Fn. The role of β 1 and αVβ 5 integrins in Fn adhesion might indicate their involvement in Fn aggregation. To address this hypothesis, the effect of integrin-blocking on Fn aggregation was assessed. Immunocytochemistry showed an increase in fibrillar Fn on the cell surface of Poly I:C stimulated astrocytes, which might indicate increased Fn aggregation. Blocking the RGD binding site, a renowned protein-recognition site present in fibronectin, did reduce fibrillar Fn expression, but did not abolish it, indicating that astrocytes are capable to form Fn fibrils in an RGD-independent manner. Furthermore, we show that stimulation <b>of</b> <b>astrocytes</b> with Poly I:C reduces their αVβ 5 cell surface expression. Concluding, we show that stimulation <b>of</b> <b>astrocytes</b> with Poly I:C decreases αVβ 5 cell surface expression, which might induces Fn fibril formation. Analysing the <b>process</b> <b>of</b> <b>astrocyte</b> mediated Fn aggregation and identifying which integrins are involved is crucial to develop means to disturb Fn aggregate deposition and facilitate Fn clearance in order to enhance remyelination in MS lesions. ...|$|R

In the SVZ, APP-like immunoreactivity was detected in the ependymal cells lining the LV {{and some of the}} subependymal cells. The latter were regarded as astrocytes, because they were positive for the glial markers, S- 100 protein (S- 100) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP).

40|$|Abstract Sodium (Na) {{homeostasis}} {{is crucial}} for life, and the Na+ level ([Na+]) of body fluids is strictly maintained at a range of 135 – 145 mM. However, {{the existence of a}} [Na+] sensor in the brain has long been controversial until Nax was identified as the molecular entity of the sensor. This review provides an overview of the [Na+]-sensing mechanism in the brain for the regulation of salt intake by summarizing a series of our studies on Nax. Nax is a Na channel expressed in the circumventricular organs (CVOs) in the brain. Among the CVOs, the subfornical organ (SFO) is the principal site for the control of salt intake behavior, where Nax populates the cellular <b>processes</b> <b>of</b> <b>astrocytes</b> and ependymal cells enveloping neurons. A local expression of endothelin- 3 in the SFO modulates the [Na+] sensitivity for Nax activation, and thereby Nax is likely to be activated in the physiological [Na+] range. Nax stably interacts with Na +/K+-ATPase where-by Na+ influx via Nax is coupled with activation of Na +/K+-ATPase associated with the consumption of ATP. The conse-quent activation of anaerobic glucose metabolism of Nax-positive glial cells upregulates the cellular release of lactate, and this lactate functions as a gliotransmitter to activate GABAergic neurons in the SFO. The GABAergic neurons presumably regulate hypothetic neurons involved in the con-trol of salt intake behavior. Recently, a patient with essential hypernatremia caused by autoimmunity to Nax was found. In this case, the hypernatremia was considered to be induced by the complement-mediated cell death in the CVOs, where Nax specifically populates...|$|R

In various types of cells, inositol 1, 4, 5 -trisphosphate-induced elevations of intracellular free Ca 2 + concentration ([Ca 2 +]i) have been reported to be uniform in single cells or originate at discrete sites from which they then propagate throughout the cells. These observations so far imply that a single cell functions as a minimal unit for inositol 1, 4, 5 -trisphosphate-induced Ca 2 + signaling. In this study, we examined the effects of histamine on [Ca 2 +]i <b>of</b> type- 2 <b>astrocytes</b> using fura- 2 -based digital imaging fluorescence microscopy and found an unusual type of Ca 2 + signaling in these cells. Histamine induced [Ca 2 +]i elevation in type- 2 <b>astrocytes</b> by means <b>of</b> histamine H 1 receptors. Submaximal concentrations of histamine (10 (- 7) - 10 (- 6) M) evoked multiple sites of oscillatory [Ca 2 +]i elevation in single type- 2 astrocytes. These Ca 2 + "hot spots" were localized in the <b>processes</b> <b>of</b> the <b>astrocytes</b> but not in the cell bodies. The time courses of [Ca 2 +]i oscillations in different hot spots were not synchronized, indicating that each of them formed an independent compartment of Ca 2 + signaling. When higher concentrations (10 (- 5) - 10 (- 4) M) of histamine were added, [Ca 2 +]i in the processes remained elevated at high levels and [Ca 2 +]i elevations propagated from the processes to the cell bodies. These results suggest that individual <b>processes</b> <b>of</b> type- 2 <b>astrocytes</b> can form minimal units for Ca 2 + signaling in response to submaximal concentrations of histamine and that single type- 2 astrocytes may function as multiple units for Ca 2 + signaling...|$|R
40|$|Brain inflammation, {{a common}} feature in {{neurodegenerative}} diseases, {{is a complex}} series of events, which can be detrimental and even lead to neuronal death. Nonetheless, several studies suggest that inflammatory signals are also positively influencing neural cell proliferation, survival, migration, and differentiation. Recently, correlative studies suggested that astrocytes are able to dedifferentiate upon injury and may thereby re-acquire neural stem cell (NSC) potential. However, the mechanism underlying this dedifferentiation process upon injury remains unclear. Here, we report that during the early response of reactive gliosis, inflammation induces a conversion <b>of</b> mature <b>astrocytes</b> into neural progenitors. A TNF treatment induces the decrease <b>of</b> specific <b>astrocyte</b> markers, such as glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) or genes related to glycogen metabolism, while a subset of these cells re-expresses immaturity markers, such as CD 44, Musashi- 1, and Oct 4. Thus, TNF treatment results in the appearance of cells that exhibit a neural progenitor phenotype {{and are able to}} proliferate and differentiate into neurons and/or astrocytes. This dedifferentiation process is maintained as long as TNF is present in the culture medium. In addition, we highlight a role for Oct 4 in this process, since the TNF-induced dedifferentiation can be prevented by inhibiting Oct 4 expression. Our results show that activation of the NF-κB pathway through TNF {{plays an important role in}} the dedifferentiation <b>of</b> <b>astrocytes</b> via the re-expression of Oct 4.

40|$|Astrocytes {{are highly}} {{specialized}} cells that can maintain {{the integrity of}} the synapse, facilitate nutrition and trophic support to neurons, and regulate metabolic coupling between neurons and glia. However, astrocytes are involved in resolving different types of injuries and in aging processes in the brain. Senescence has also been reported in the brain, and senescence-associated loss <b>of</b> <b>astrocyte</b> function is linked to neuronal dysfunction in age-related neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson's disease. For example, astrocyte senescence per se inhibits synapse maturation and affects synaptic transmission. In response to the cell’s bio-energetic state, mitochondria continuously undergo structural remodeling through fission and fusion processes. These tightly regulated events are believed to be involved in many cellular events such as apoptosis, senescence, and age-related diseases. Although, {{little is known about the}} age-related changes that occur in astrocytes and if these cells are able to generate a senescent phenotype mediated by mitochondria, in the present study we evaluated the involvement of mitochondrial remodeling in the senescence <b>process</b> <b>of</b> rat <b>astrocytes</b> in vitro. The results obtained showed that when comparing cells at population doubling two (PD 2) with cells at population doubling ten (PD 10) there is a significant increase in the activity of the senescence-associated β-galactosidase marker in PD 10 cells. In addition, PD 10 cells had increased mitochondrial volume, decreased superoxide production, and decreased mitochondrial membrane potential. Protein characterization evidenced changes in the balance between mitochondrial fission and fusion proteins. Collectively, our results demonstrated a senescent-astrocyte phenotype at PD 10, which is associated with metabolic and mitochondrial phenotype changes...|$|R
40|$|Simultaneous somatic patch-pipette {{recording}} <b>of</b> {{a single}} <b>astrocyte</b> to evoke voltage-gated calcium currents, and Ca^ 2 + imaging, {{were used to}} study the spatial and temporal profiles of depolarization-induced changes in intracellular Ca^ 2 +([Ca^ 2 +]_i) in the <b>processes</b> <b>of</b> cultured rat cortical astrocytes existing as pairs. Transient Ca^ 2 + changes locked to depolarization were observed as microdomains in the <b>processes</b> <b>of</b> the <b>astrocyte</b> pairs, and the responses were more pronounced in the adjoining astrocyte. Considering the functional significance of higher concentrations of glutamate observed in certain pathological conditions, Ca^ 2 + transients were recorded following pretreatment of cells with glutamate (500 lM for 20 min). This showed distance-dependent incremental scaling and attenuation {{in the presence of}} the metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) antagonist, α-methyl(4 -carboxy-phenyl) glycine (MCPG). Estimation f local Ca^ 2 + diffusion coefficients in the astrocytic processes indicated higher values in the adjoining <b>astrocyte</b> <b>of</b> the glutamate pretreated group. Intracellular heparin introduced into the depolarized astrocyte did not affect the Ca^ 2 + transients in the heparin-loaded astrocyte but attenuated the Ca^ 2 +([Ca^ 2 +]_i) responses in the adjoining astrocyte, suggesting that inositol 1, 4, 5 triphosphate (IP_ 3) may be the transfer signal. The uncoupling agent, 1 -octanol, attenuated the Ca^ 2 +([Ca^ 2 +]_i) responses in both the control and lutamate pretreated astrocytes, indicating the role of gap junctional communication. Our studies indicate that individual astrocytes have distinct functional domains, and that the glutamateinduced alterations in Ca^ 2 + signaling involve a sequence of intra- and intercellular steps in which phospholipase C (PLC), IP_ 3, internal Ca^ 2 + stores, VGCC and gap junction channels appear to play an important role...|$|R
40|$|She {{studied the}} effects of cystatin C (CysC) on {{astrocyte}} development. CysC is an endogenous inhibitor of cystein protease, known to be produced by mature astrocytes in the adult brain. Previously, CysC was isolated as a factor regulating astrocyte development through a newly developed expression cloning system using glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) -promoter activity as an indicator. An in situ hybridization study showed that the CysC gene started to be expressed in astrocyte progenitor cells at embryonic day 16 (E 16) in mouse cortex, when gliogenesis is initiated following the generation of neurons in the cortex. CysC is a secreted protein, thus {{it is possible that}} CysC produced by the astrocyte progenitors acts as an epigenetic factor to promote gliogenesis in the developing cortex in an autocrine/paracrine manner. Recently, it was reported that CysC is a cofactor of basic fibroblast growth factor- 2 (FGF- 2) and works to maintain and proliferate the neural stem cells (NSC) as an autocrine/paracrine factor in vitro (Taupin et al., 2000). She showed that the protease inhibitory activity, in the conditioned medium (CM) from primary cultured brain cells, increased day by day. She found one anti-CysC antibody that blocked the inhibitory activity of the CM, indicating that the primary cultured cells released CysC into the medium. She also demonstrated that CysC added to the culture medium increased the number and the <b>process</b> length <b>of</b> GFAP positive cells in the primary cultured brain cells. On the other hand, addition of the anti-CysC antibody decreased those. Another cystein protease inhibitor, E 64, increased the <b>process</b> length <b>of</b> GFAP positive cells but did not caused an increase the number of GFAP positive cells in the primary cultured brain cell. These results showed that CysC can modify astrocyte development in two ways: one is to increase the number <b>of</b> <b>astrocytes,</b> which is independent of its protease inhibitor activity and the other to increase the <b>process</b> length <b>of</b> <b>astrocytes,</b> which is dependent on its protease inhibitor activity...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} presents work in two parts. First, {{a presentation}} <b>of</b> effects <b>of</b> <b>astrocytes</b> on synapse formation of hippocampal neurons. The second describes a new near-field microscope for biological samples.;The formation of chemical synapses is a poorly understood {{process that is}} likely to critically rely on the presence of molecular cues that arise from presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons as well as associated glial cells. Rat hippocarnpal cultures were established in astrocyte-deplete and enriched conditions to ask whether the presence <b>of</b> <b>astrocytes</b> stimulated formation <b>of</b> chemical synapses. Co-culture with astrocytes selectively augmented formation of excitatory synapses. Immunostaining demonstrated that <b>astrocytes</b> stimulate export <b>of</b> synaptic proteins to the neurites, and the nerve terminal, which on ultrastructural examination were shown to contain increased number of synaptic vesicles within the presynaptic terminal. Also, local contact with astrocytes led to a selective augmentation of the magnitude of the N-type calcium current. The N-type calcium current is known to be associated with newly formed synapses. We propose that local interactions between the <b>process</b> <b>of</b> an <b>astrocyte</b> and developing pre- and postsynaptic terminals will augment calcium influx and thus synaptic transmission to place this tripartite structure at a competitive advantage over neighboring developing synapses that are devoid of interactions with astrocytes.;Sub-diffraction optical resolution achieved using near-field optical microscopy has the potential for new approaches and insights into sub-cellular function and molecular dynamics. Despite this potential it has been difficult to apply near-field microscopy to biology. Sample thickness causes the optical information to be comprised of a composite signal containing both near- and far-field fluorescence. To overcome this issue we have developed an approach in which a near-field optical fiber is translated toward the cell. Increased fluorescence intensity during z-translation contains two components; far-field fluorescence and combined near- and far-field fluorescence. Fitting a regression curve to the far-field intensity as the illumination aperture approaches the cell; it is possible to isolate near-field fluorescent signals. We demonstrate ability to resolve actin filaments in fixed glial cells. Comparison of composite signals with extracted near-field fluorescence demonstrates this approach significantly increases ability to detect sub-cellular structures at sub-diffraction resolution...|$|R

Some special staining is used to distinguish the specific structure of neuron, such as Nissl staining for Nissl body. It can distinguish neuron from other cells, and can be used to judge the degree of neuron injury. Some special staining is used as the assistance of pathological diagnosis of some nervous system diseases. For example, in the primary demyelinating disease, Luxol Fast Blue staining is used to mark the demyelinating region; Bodian staining is used to label the relatively preserved axon; Holzer staining can show the abundant fine <b>processes</b> <b>of</b> reactively proliferative <b>astrocytes,</b> and so on. It will get twice the result with half the effort if pathologists use special staining as the assistance of clinical neuropathological diagnosis...|$|R
40|$|Devic's neuromyelitis optica (NMO) is an {{idiopathic}} inflammatory demyelinating and necrotizing disease {{characterized by}} predominant {{involvement of the}} optic nerves and spinal cord. In Asian countries relapsing NMO has been known as opticospinal multiple sclerosis. It has long been debated if NMO is a variant of multiple sclerosis (MS) or a distinct disease. Recent {{studies have shown that}} NMO has more frequently a relapsing course, and results from attack to aquaporin- 4 which is the dominant water channel in the central nervous system, located in foot <b>processes</b> <b>of</b> the <b>astrocytes.</b> Distinctive pathological features of NMO include perivascular deposition of IgG and complement in the perivascular space, granulocyte and eosinophil infiltrates and hyalinization of the vascular walls. These features distinguish NMO from other demyelinating diseases such as MS and acute demyelinating encephalomyelopathy. An IgG-antibody that binds to aquaporin- 4, named NMO-IgG has high sensitivity and specificity. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies have revealed that more frequently there is a long spinal cord lesion that extends through three or more vertebral segments in length. Brain MRI lesions atypical for MS are found in the majority of cases. Treatment in the acute phase includes intravenous steroids and plasma exchange therapy. Immunosupressive agents are recommended for prophylaxis of relapses...|$|R
40|$|Mouse {{hepatitis}} {{virus strain}} JHM (MHV-JHM) causes a chronic encephalomyelitis in susceptible mice, with histological evidence of demyelination in the spinal cord. After intranasal inoculation, virus spreads retrogradely to several brain structures along neuroanatomic projections {{to the main}} olfactory bulb. In the absence of experimental intervention, mice become moribund before the spinal cord is infected. In this study, infusions of anti-MHV neutralizing monoclonal antibodies were administered to protect mice from the MHV-JHM-induced acute encephalitis and to allow survival until virus spread to the spinal cord. Under these conditions, virus was observed to enter specific layers (primarily laminae V to VII) in the gray matter of the upper spinal cord, consistent with transneuronal spread. While the brain structures which are the sources for virus spread to the spinal cord cannot be determined with certainty, the ventral reticular nucleus {{is likely to be}} important since it is consistently and extensively labeled in all mice and receives projections from subsequently infected areas of the spinal cord. After initial entry into the gray matter, virus rapidly spread to the white matter of the spinal cord. During the early stages <b>of</b> this <b>process,</b> extensive infection <b>of</b> <b>astrocytes</b> was noted, suggesting that cell-to-cell spread via these glial cells is an important part <b>of</b> this <b>process.</b> Reports from other laboratories using cultured cells strongly suggested that astrocytes serve as important regulators of oligodendrocyte function and, by extrapolation, have a major role in vivo in the <b>processes</b> <b>of</b> both demyelination and remyelination. Thus, our results not only outline the probable pathway used by MHV-JHM to infect the white matter of the spinal cord but also, with the assumption that infection <b>of</b> <b>astrocytes</b> leads to subsequent dysfunction, raise the possibility that infection of these cells contributes to the demyelinating process...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{observe the}} effect of nuclear {{transcription}} factor-κB (NF-κB) on cerebral edema in rats with traumatic brain injury (TBI). MethodsMale SD rats with fluid percussion injury (FPI) were selected. After separation and culture, rats' astrocytes all suffered FPI. The expression of NF-κB and the water content were detected at the animal and cellular levels, while the activity of NOX was evaluated at the cellular level. ResultsAccording to the results, the positive expression of NF-κB and expression of mRNA were significantly increased and the water content was increased for rats after TBI, while NF-κB inhibitor BAY 11 - 7082 could significantly reduce {{the effect of}} TBI. 1 and 3  h after FPI <b>of</b> <b>astrocytes,</b> the activation <b>of</b> NF-κB was increased and BAY 11 - 7082 could significantly improve the injury-induced swelling <b>of</b> <b>astrocytes.</b> After the injury <b>of</b> <b>astrocytes,</b> the activity <b>of</b> NOX was also increased, while BAY 11 - 7082 could reduce the activity of NOX. ConclusionsThe {{results show that the}} activation <b>of</b> NF-κB in <b>astrocytes</b> is a key factor in the <b>process</b> <b>of</b> cerebral edema after TBI of rats...|$|R
40|$|Astrocytes form an {{intricate}} partnership with neural circuits to influence numerous cellular and synaptic processes. One prominent organizational feature <b>of</b> <b>astrocytes</b> is the "tiling" {{of the brain}} with non-overlapping territories. There are some documented species and brain region-specific astrocyte specializations, but the extent <b>of</b> <b>astrocyte</b> diversity and circuit specificity are still unknown. We quantitatively defined the rules that govern the spatial arrangement <b>of</b> <b>astrocyte</b> somata and territory overlap in ferret visual cortex {{using a combination of}} in vivo two-photon imaging, morphological reconstruction, immunostaining, and model simulations. We found that ferret astrocytes share, on average, half of their territory with other astrocytes. However, a specific class <b>of</b> <b>astrocytes,</b> abundant in thalamo-recipient cortical layers ("kissing" astrocytes), overlap markedly less. Together, these results demonstrate novel features <b>of</b> <b>astrocyte</b> organization indicating that different classes <b>of</b> <b>astrocytes</b> are arranged in a circuit-specific manner and that tiling does not apply universally across brain regions and species.
