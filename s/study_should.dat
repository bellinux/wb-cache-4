Hutton is considered the father of geology, but his idea of a living Earth was forgotten in the intense reductionism of the 19th century.

Detailed treatments published in the 21st century have divided the family into around 125–130 genera and 1,400–1,500 species, which are then arranged into a number of tribes and subfamilies. The ICSG classification of the cactus family recognizes four subfamilies, the largest of which is divided into nine tribes. The subfamilies are: ...|$|E

30|$|This {{study has}} some {{limitations}} {{such as the}} small sample size and the short duration of follow-up (a year).

Another limitation is that there was no control group in this <b>study.</b> Future <b>studies</b> <b>should</b> include a control group to confirm the results of this study.|$|R
30|$|The {{present study}} has {{strengths}} {{such as the}} longitudinal assessment over 2  years; however, certain limitations should be noted.

Rather than use a work to study linguistic history, they recommend examining works through stylistics, which in literature they define as [...] "the study {{of a work of}} art or a group of works which are to be described in terms of their aesthetic function and meaning". Such studies can be done either as a search for a [...] "total meaning" [...] or a [...] "sum of individual traits". Ideally, such a <b>study</b> <b>should</b> [...] "establish some unifying principle, some general aesthetic" [...] in a work or genre, although some may be more difficult than others. As such, they reject stylistic studies which focus mainly on [...] "peculiarities of style" [...] or which are linked to extrinsic elements.|$|E

2500|$|The {{genesis of}} Parsley's church {{came into being}} in 1977, when as a Bible college student he began leading a Bible study in his parents' back yard. Seventeen people {{attended}} the first service. Soon {{it was decided that}} the Bible <b>study</b> <b>should</b> become a church. It originally became known as Sunset Chapel, and later Word of Life Church in Canal Winchester, Ohio. The church's first permanent facility was built in 1979. It is now known as Alpha Hall, which is one of four buildings on what for many years was the campus of Valor Christian College (the college moved to the main church campus in 2011). Growth soon required an addition to that building, and several years later the church built a bigger structure adjacent to Alpha Hall, which is now known as Dominion Hall. In 1986, ground was broken on [...] to begin what is now the church's Columbus campus. When it was dedicated, it was renamed World Harvest Church in honor of Lester Sumrall, who had befriended Parsley years earlier and became the younger pastor's mentor.|$|E

2500|$|When vWD is suspected, {{blood plasma}} {{of a patient}} must be {{investigated}} for quantitative and qualitative deficiencies of vWF. [...] This is achieved by measuring the amount of vWF in a vWF antigen assay and the functionality of vWF with a glycoprotein (GP)Ib binding assay, a collagen binding assay, or a ristocetin cofactor activity (RiCof) or ristocetin induced platelet agglutination (RIPA) assays. Factor VIII levels are also performed because factor VIII is bound to vWF which protects the factor VIII from rapid breakdown within the blood. Deficiency of vWF can then lead {{to a reduction in}} factor VIII levels, which explains the elevation in PTT time. Normal levels do not exclude all forms of vWD, particularly type 2, which may only be revealed by investigating platelet interaction with subendothelium under flow, a highly specialized coagulation study not routinely performed in most medical laboratories. A platelet aggregation assay will show an abnormal response to ristocetin with normal responses to the other agonists used. A platelet function assay [...] may give an abnormal collagen/adrenaline closure time, and in most cases, a normal collagen/ADP time. Type 2N may be considered if factor VIII levels are disproportionately low, but confirmation requires a [...] "factor VIII binding" [...] assay. Additional laboratory tests that help classify sub-types of vWD include von-willebrand multimer analysis, modified ristocetin induced platelet aggregation assay and vWF propeptide to vWF antigen ratio propeptide. In cases of suspected acquired von-Willebrand syndrome, a mixing <b>study</b> <b>should</b> be performed. Detection of vWD is complicated by vWF being an acute phase reactant with levels rising in infection, pregnancy, and stress.|$|E
