40|$|Most <b>surface</b> <b>imaging</b> <b>resist</b> schemes {{are based}} on the {{selective}} diffusion of a Si-containing compound into the resist. In the diffusion enhanced silylated resist process hexamethyldisilazane is being incorporated in the exposed regions during the silylation treatment. Upon deep ultraviolet irradiation (at 248 nm), novolac based resists will however crosslink to some extent. The crosslinking reaction influences the degree of silicon incorporation in the exposed resist and hence {{plays an important role in}} the imaging properties. The crosslinking reaction has been studied in detail in this work for two types of Plasmask deep-ultraviolet resists, along with its consequences on resist imaging. A decrease in silicon incorporation due to crosslinking puts a serious limitation on the useful process window for Plasmask 150 u, but the process window is not limited by crosslinking for Plasmask 301 u. A thorough investigation of the influence of crosslinking on the pattern deformation is also carried out...|$|E
40|$|High {{resolution}} {{processes are}} demonstrated with a positive-mode chemically amplified AXT top <b>surface</b> <b>imaging</b> <b>resist</b> system exposed {{with a low}} energy electron beam. Top surface imaging is an ideal match to low energy electron beam lithography because it allows thick resist layers to be patterned despite the limited penetration depth of the electron beam. The three key steps of the process are exposure, silylation, and etch development. All three steps influence the final process sensitivity, contrast, and resolution. The AXT has a poly(hydroxy styrene) base resin, and has been formulated both with and without a dye used to enhance optical absorption. We have achieved sub 100 nm resolution both with and without a postexposure bake. Critical area doses below 1 [*]μC/m 2 are demonstrated. The edge roughness and density of etch residue from silylation defects have been compared {{for a variety of}} oxygen plasma etch systems...|$|E
40|$|Silylation is a <b>surface</b> <b>imaging</b> {{technique}} {{which allows}} silicon to absorb into photoresist in specified areas. Photoresist containing silicon creates a hard-mask which is resistant to oxygen plasma. This {{allows for the}} development process to occur strictly in dry etch systems. <b>Surface</b> <b>imaging</b> is a desirable technique because it removes the need to expose through the photoresist stack. Traditional lithography techniques require a high dose of ultra-violet (UV) light in order to penetrate {{to the bottom of}} a photoresist stack. It is critical, for quality imaging, that the photoresist not be over or under exposed. This creates a process window dependent on two main variables; the photoresist thickness and the dose needed to penetrate through the photoresist stack. <b>Surface</b> <b>imaging</b> allows for a larger process window because the dose is not depended on the thickness of the <b>resist.</b> In <b>surface</b> <b>imaging,</b> the UV light only exposes the top-most layer of the photoresist material. <b>Surface</b> <b>imaging</b> removes the <b>resist</b> thickness variable, this will allow for a wider process window. Variation in photoresist thickness is also important; traditional lithography requires a uniform photoresist thickness {{across the surface of the}} wafer in order to optimize depth of focus (DOF). <b>Surface</b> <b>imaging</b> tends to be less effected by photoresist variation due to short depth requirements of the exposure. This allows for a relaxed depth of focus (DOF) requirement, as well as a larger process window...|$|R
40|$|Dry {{development}} of silylated resist {{has been studied}} using an 02 plasma generated by a multipolar electron cyclotron resonance source. Etch rate, uniformity, selectivity, and profile were investigated {{as a function of}} process parameters including microwave power, RF power, flow rate, sample area, pressure, temperature, and gas addition. It was found that etch rate increases as microwave and/or RF power increase. Vertical etch profile was obtained by using low pressure (3 mTorr) and 50 W RF power. As the area of the samples was increased from i to 81 cm 2, the etch rate decreased from 0. 85 to 0. 6 p~m/min at a flow of 10 sccm 02 but remained constant t 0. 9 ~m/min with 100 sccm 02. Etch rate was independent of temperature and decreased with the addition of N 2 or CF 4. Etch uniformity was within _ 3 % across a 150 mm wafer for most etch conditions. The selectivity of the silylated layer over the photoresist degraded from 445 to 14 as RF power was increased from 25 to 100 W. Residue-free surface and vertical profile have been obtained with features as small as 0. 1 ~m.

40|$|Summary: Recent {{advances}} in 3 -dimensional (3 D) <b>surface</b> <b>imaging</b> technologies allow for digital quantification of complex breast tissue. We performed 11 unilateral breast reconstructions with deep inferior epigastric artery perforator (DIEP) flaps (5 immediate, 6 delayed) using 3 D <b>surface</b> <b>imaging</b> for easier surgery planning and 3 D-printed molds for shaping the breast neoparenchyma.

40|$|Modern {{biology is}} faced with the {{challenge}} of understanding the specification, generation, and maintenance of structures ranging from cells and tissues to organs and organisms. By acquiring images directly from the block face of an embedded sample, <b>surface</b> <b>imaging</b> microscopy (SIM) generates high-resolution volumetric images of biological specimens across all of these scales. <b>Surface</b> <b>imaging</b> microscopy expands our range of imaging tools by generating three-dimensional reconstructions of embryo samples at high resolution and high contrast. SIM image quality is not limited by depth or the optical properties of overlying tissue, and intrinsic or extrinsic alignment markers are not required for volume reconstruction. These volumes are highly isotropic, enabling them to be virtually sectioned in any direction without loss of image quality. <b>Surface</b> <b>imaging</b> microscopy provided a more accurate three-dimensional representation of a chick embryo than confocal microscopy of the same sample.

40|$|Abstract. The {{recently}} developed Occamian approach for solving inverse problems {{was applied to}} <b>surface</b> <b>imaging</b> of cool stars. With a set of tests the effects of data noise and uncertainties of the stellar parameters on the solution have been investigated. The spot locations and spot configuration {{are found to be}} well determined in most cases. The spot contrast can be successfully restored in case of adequate atmospheric models and line profile calculations. A formal error analysis of the solution is applied {{for the first time to}} the <b>surface</b> <b>imaging</b> problem. It is suggested that the pole-to-equator gradient of the temperature is a consequence of the information distribution on the stellar surface, which is determined by the available observational data. From the analysis of the error distribution on the stellar surface under different conditions two practical advices have been formulated for successful <b>surface</b> <b>imaging.</b> First, a total number points of data ought to be a few times the number of unknown parameters, since only in such a case most of the stellar surface can be restored realiably. Second, the S/N ratio should be as large as possible, since its value affects proportionally the size of the area of the stellar surface with an acceptable level of the errors...|$|R
40|$|The {{limiting}} factor of electron-beam direct writing is the electron scattering especially on realisitic process wafers with topography and therefore variable resist film thicknesses. The ultimate lithographic performance {{can only be}} achieved if the scattering effects are reduced by proximity correction and by the top <b>surface</b> <b>imaging</b> principle. The project target was to develop e-beam sensitive bilayer and top <b>surface</b> <b>imaging</b> (TSI) singlelayer resistprocesses using the silylation techniques. At the surface the silicon incorporation of exposed areas differs from unexposed areas. The transfer of the silicon containing resist structures into the bottom resist is effected by a dry development process which is a compromise between CD loss and anisotropy. Quarter micron structures with high resist aspect ratio are feasible. For demonstration the developed resist processes were utilized for the double layer metallization of a 0. 8 #mu#m CMOS technology. While for the contact and via hole layer a conventional single layer resist process is usable the metallization layers need <b>surface</b> <b>imaging</b> processes.
