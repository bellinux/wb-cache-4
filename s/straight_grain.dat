25|$|Peridotites {{can take}} on a massive form or may be in layers. Layered peridotites may form the base layers of gabbroic complexes. Even though some layered peridotites appear to have no {{associated}} gabbro, they probably once were part of such a complex. Three main textures are found in peridotites: the first are well formed crystals of olivine surrounded by other minerals. These olivine crystals probably settled out of the magma first. Another texture is equal sized crystals with <b>straight</b> <b>grain</b> boundaries intersecting at 120Â°. This may result when slow cooling allowed recrystallization to minimize surface energy. A third texture has long crystals with ragged curvilinear boundaries, a result of internal deformation.|$|E
50|$|Flat-sawing {{produces}} the least wood waste and fastest sawing, but produces boards {{which are more}} susceptible to cupping and shrinkage, and which have a distinctive grain which may be aesthetically undesirable for some uses. Quarter sawing produces smaller boards than flat sawing, but has a <b>straighter</b> <b>grain,</b> which in addition to being visually pleasing, makes the lumber more stable.|$|R

It is slightly denser that E. regnans - estimates of density range from 720 kg/m3 to 830 kg/m3 - and harder too. The sapwood is pale brown, the heartwood light brown. It has an even texture, with <b>straight</b> <b>grains</b> sometimes interlocked, and well-defined rings. Gum veins are common.|$|R

50|$|The <b>straight</b> <b>grain</b> is {{oriented}} {{parallel with}} the warp threads and the selvedge.

The difference between the first three grains is that of cutting a tree along the grain, at an angle, and perpendicular to its direction of growth (mokume-gane) respectively, the angle causing the [...] "stretched" [...] pattern.|$|R

50|$|The cross grain runs {{perpendicular}} to the selvedge and parallel to the weft threads. The cross grain generally has more stretch than the <b>straight</b> <b>grain</b> since the weft threads are generally looser than the warp during weaving. Most garments (like pants or shirts) are cut on the <b>straight</b> <b>grain</b> with the cross grain parallel with the floor when the wearer is standing. This allows more stretch through {{the width of the}} garment, such as in a pants leg which needs more circumferential than vertical stretch. Garments are sometimes cut on the cross grain, generally because the pieces are too wide to fit on the <b>straight</b> <b>grain.</b>|$|E

50|$|The wood is {{versatile}} and very useful for construction. It is light, with <b>straight</b> <b>grains,</b> {{and easy to}} work. It is used for {{a great variety of}} products, including telephone poles, railroad ties, bridges, boats, plywood and flooring, furniture, sports equipment, and musical instruments. It is easy to break down into chips, particle board, or pulp for paper. Its value has led to overexploitation of wild populations of the tree, and destruction of the forest ecosystems in which it grows. The Siberian tiger is resident in these pine forests, and preservation of this tree species is one step in the conservation of the tiger.|$|R

5000|$|Quarter sawing is {{sometimes}} {{confused with the}} much less common [...] "rift sawing." [...] In quartersawn wood, only the center board of the quarter-log is cut with the growth rings truly perpendicular {{to the surface of}} the board. The smaller boards cut from either side have grain increasingly skewed. Riftsawn wood has every board cut along a radius of the original log, so each board has a perpendicular grain, with the growth rings oriented at right angles {{to the surface of the}} board. However, since this produces a great deal of waste (in the form of wedge-shaped scraps from between the boards) rift-sawing is very seldom used. Quartersawn wood is thus seen as an acceptable compromise between economical but less-stable flatsawn wood (which, especially in oak, will often display the distinct [...] "cathedral window" [...] grain) and the expensively-wasteful rift sawn wood, which has the <b>straightest</b> <b>grain</b> and thus the greatest stability.|$|R

50|$|Quarter sawing {{gets its}} name {{from the fact that the}} log is first {{quartered}} lengthwise, resulting in wedges with a right angle ending at approximately the center of the original log. Each quarter is then cut separately by tipping it up on its point and sawing boards successively along the axis. That results in boards with the annual rings mostly perpendicular to the faces. Quarter sawing yields boards with <b>straight</b> striped <b>grain</b> lines, greater stability than flatsawn wood, and a distinctive ray and fleck figure. It also yields narrower boards, because the log is first quartered, which is more wasteful.|$|R
40|$|The {{athletic}} demands {{we put on}} {{horses in}} the racing industry require 1. 5 to 3 year old, still growing horses, to be worked well above light exercise level. Therefore, the nutrient needs for such horses consist not only of maintenance, voluntary activity (play, group interaction) and growth but also of requirements for work. This leads to increased requirements for all nutrients. In practice, horse trainers alter energy intake of working youngsters according to body condition. The feeding levels are determined from experience and daily observation of horses and the choice of feed also often is made according to tradition and previous experience. Additional energy for growth and work is recommended for heat production when horses are kept in loose housing below thermal neutral temperature (Nordic countries). Although quality of protein is important, excess protein may have a detrimental effect {{on the performance of}} young horses. Exercise will increase load bearing qualities of the musco-skeletal system but if training and nutrition are not optimised, bucked shins, micro-fractures, haemorrhage and stress fractures may occur. Therefore, special attention needs to given to mineral and vitamin supply. There is a risk that young racehorses may receive diets deficient in calcium, relative to the increased need for accelerated bone metabolism at onset of training. In conjunction with this the requirements of vitamin D also increase in young horses entering training because of increased bone modelling. When feeding traditional <b>straight</b> <b>grains</b> a balancer or supplement are recommended. To maintain a healthy digestive tract and good welfare of young horses in training an adequate supply of structural fibre is required when stabled a level of at least 1. 2 % of BW as forage feed (DM) is recommended. In addition continued grazing during the growing and training period will help with temperament and prevention of behavioural problems but also with nutrient balance and digestive tract health. vo...|$|R

40|$|SUMMARY. Mosaic olivine textures, with <b>straight</b> riple <b>grain</b> {{boundaries}} {{meeting at}} angles of 12 o ~, {{are common in}} dunites. This is a well-known feature of annealed metals, and {{is the result of}} grain-boundary migration during recrystallization i which the system tends toward a state of minimum interfacial energies. Geometrically similar textures are present at the boundaries between such mosaic grains and strain-banded relict olivine grains. The unstrained mosaic grains make angular projections into the strained grains exactly at the junctions between the deformation bands. These are interpreted to be triple junctions with the two differently oriented bands acting as separate grains, and thus also due to recrystallization. BOTH Lauder (I 965, p. 479) and Challis (I 967, p. 200) have drawn attention to certain textural relationships involving strain-banded olivine grains in dunite, and both inter-pret these features in terms that support heir general contention that the intrusions of the New Zealand peridotite belt are the product of essentially magmatic processes. The purpose of this note is to propose an alternative explanation. The textural element in question is the geometry of the boundary between olivine grains with pronounced undulatory extinction bands and the adjacent smaller un...|$|R
