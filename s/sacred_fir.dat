5000|$|On lower slopes are farmlands which grow mostly field [...] "dent" [...] {{corn and}} forests which {{transition}} from alders and {{various types of}} oak to Montezuma pines and <b>sacred</b> <b>firs</b> with increasing elevation. The upper slopes are zacatonal. The summit is covered by snow {{part of the year}} and is considered to be the coldest location in Tlaxcala. On the lower slopes the climate is mild year round, but rainy during the summer months. The soils consist of crushed volcanic rock and sand with an underlying layer of clay and sand called tepetate at an average depth of about a meter. The dark and porous forest soils were formed from volcanic ash. From La Malinche streams flow in all directions forming small gorges in places which fill and run rapidly when torrential rains occur. At the base of the mountain emerge many springs, some of drinkable water, and others of thermal water heated in the volcano's interior.|$|R
500|$|The {{species was}} first {{reported}} by French mycologist Roger Heim in 1956 as {{a variety of}} Psilocybe mexicana before he officially described it under its current name a year later. Named for its association with the Nahua people also called Aztecs, P.aztecorum {{may have been one}} of the sacred mushroom species, or teonanácatl (A Nahuatl word translated variously as [...] "sacred mushroom" [...] or [...] "flesh of the gods"), reported in the codices of 16th-century Spanish chronicler Bernardino de Sahagún. The mushrooms are still used for spiritual ceremonies by Nahua Indians in the Popocatépetl region, although this traditional usage is waning. The variety P.aztecorum var. bonetii has smaller spores than the main variety, and is found at lower elevations with Montezuma pine (Pinus montezumae) and <b>sacred</b> <b>fir</b> (Abies religiosa). P.aztecorum may be distinguished from similar temperate species such as P.baeocystis and P.quebecensis by their ranges, and by differences in the morphology of microscopic structures like cystidia.|$|E

50|$|The <b>sacred</b> <b>fir</b> is the {{preferred}} tree for the monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus) to reside in colonies during its hibernation in the forests of the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt. Although monarch butterflies are known {{in other parts of}} the southern Mexican highlands as some specimens do not migrate, the bulk of them gather in a few protected fir forests near the towns of Angangueo (Michoacán) and Avándaro (State of Mexico), from December to March.|$|E
50|$|The <b>sacred</b> <b>fir</b> or Abies religiosa (known as oyamel in Spanish) is a fir {{native to}} the {{mountains}} of central and southern Mexico (Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt, Sierra Madre del Sur) and western Guatemala. It grows at high altitudes of 2100 - 4100 m in cloud forests with cool, humid summers and dry winters in most of its habitat regime. In the state of Veracruz, it grows with precipitation all year long. The tree is resistant to regular winter snowfalls.|$|E
50|$|Phaeocollybia pseudolugubris is {{a species}} of fungus in the family Cortinariaceae.

5000|$|The {{altitude}} of Los Volcanes varies between 2,589 m {{above sea level}} and 5,452 m above sea level.

Its diverse ecosystems consist of the pine and <b>sacred</b> <b>fir</b> (Abies religiosa, Oyamel in Nahuatl) of the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt pine-oak forests as well as high-mountain prairies. Its geological formations (hills, volcanic cones and slopes) are of volcanic origin with a predomination of basalt and andesitic rocks.|$|E

30|$|Due {{to their}} wide {{distribution}} and economic value, conifers, {{to which the}} genus Abies belongs, {{are among the most}} sought-after trees. The wood of Abies religiosa (Kuntch) Schldl. et Cham, also known as abeto (<b>sacred</b> <b>fir)</b> or oyamel, a conifer with wide distribution in Mexico and Guatemala, is very much appreciated due to its physical and mechanical properties [26, 27]. These trees develop under the geographic, climatic and ecological conditions characteristic of mountainous areas, within an altitudinal gradient from 2400 to 3600  meters above sea level (masl), notably along the so-called Neovolcanic Transversal Axis [28]. In the state of Veracruz in Mexico, it is found mostly at the Cofre de Perote National Park, where trees are distributed along circular bands within a gradient from 3000 to 3500  masl [26, 29].|$|E
40|$|Aim of study: The {{objectives}} {{of this work}} were to determine which morphological and fire severity variables may help explain the mortality of adult Abies religiosa (Kunth) Schltdl. & Cham., to model the probability of this species after being affected by crown fire, and to obtain more elements to classify the <b>sacred</b> <b>fir</b> in terms of fire resistance. This type of study is relevant to understand and estimate the impacts of crown fires on the climax forests formed by this species. Area of study: The burned forest was located in the southern Mexico City, borough. Material and methods: Morphological variables and fire severity indicators were collected for 335 Abies religiosa trees burned by a mixed severity fire. Logistic regression was used to analyze data and develop models that best explained tree mortality. Main results: Survival was 26. 9 %. The models for height (p≤ 0. 0001), diameter at breast height (p= 0. 0082), crown length (p≤ 0. 0001) and crown base height (p≤ 0. 0001) were significant, with a negative relationship between {{each one of these}} variables and probability of mortality. The significant severity variables were lethal scorch height (p≤ 0. 0001) and crown kill (p≤ 0. 0001), which have a direct relationship with probability of mortality. Highlights: This species is moderately fire-resistant. Crown kill ≥ 70 % markedly increases mortality. Silvicultural activities such as pruning, thinning and fuel management can reduce the risk of crown fires...|$|E
