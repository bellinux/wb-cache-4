25|$|In June 1932 the Mussel II began flying as a landplane {{again with}} a central <b>single</b> <b>wheel</b> undercarriage, with wing tip and tail skids. It flew, but was hard to handle {{on the ground and}} reappeared in October with the central float but no land wheels. During 1933 it gained {{attention}} in races against speedboats. Its last flight was in September 1933.|$|E
25|$|The {{aircraft}} uses retractable tricycle type {{landing gear}} by Messier-Dowty, with twin nosewheels and a <b>single</b> <b>wheel</b> on each main gear. A runway tailhook or a fairing for a brake parachute can be fitted under the tail, which can operate {{in conjunction with}} the landing gear's carbon brakes to shorten landing distances. A removable refueling probe can be attached in front of the cockpit, offset slightly to the right of centre.|$|E
25|$|Trucks with dual {{tires on}} the rear axle and two driven axles are {{designated}} as 4×4s despite having six wheels because the paired rear wheels behave as a <b>single</b> <b>wheel</b> for traction and classification purposes. True 6×6 vehicles which have three powered axles, and are classified as 6×6s regardless of how many wheels they have. Examples of these with two rear, one front axle are the 6-wheeled Pinzgauer, which is popular with defense forces around the globe, and 10-wheeled GMC CCKW made famous by the U.S. Army in World War II.|$|E
50|$|London Transport used {{overhead}} monorails and helibuses {{in early}} stories. Ground transport cars were also drawn with gyroscopes and <b>single</b> <b>wheels.</b>|$|R
50|$|In Europe, {{super singles}} became popular when the allowed weight of {{semitrailer}} rigs was increased from 38 to 40 tonnes. In this reform the trailer industry replaced two 10 t axles with dual wheels, with three 8 t axles on wide-base <b>single</b> <b>wheels.</b> The significantly lower axle weight on super singles {{must be considered}} when comparing road wear from <b>single</b> versus dual <b>wheels.</b> The majority of super singles sold in Europe have a width of 385 mm. The standard 385 tires have a legal load limit of 4500 kg. (Note that expensive, specially reinforced 385 tires approved for 5000 kg do exist. Their market share is tiny, except for mounting on the steer axle.) A high share of research on road wear from heavy vehicles have failed to consider relevant axle load on super singles, as they compare road wear from 10-tonne axle load both dual <b>wheels</b> and on <b>single</b> <b>wheels,</b> instead of the relevant 8 - 9 t axle load on <b>single</b> <b>wheels.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{off-road}} {{models are}} available with three and four axles; the layouts are 6×4, 6×6 and 8×8. The axles are with <b>single</b> <b>wheels</b> and equipped with CTI system.|$|R
25|$|The wings were {{mid-mounted}} {{and strongly}} tapered with slightly swept leading edges and marked curvature on the trailing edges. They were fitted with tabbed ailerons and flaps. There were three crew, a bomb aimer/observer {{housed in a}} partially glazed nose, the pilot in a conventional cockpit which merged into a raised rear fuselage and, in the extreme tail just beyond the fins, a rear gunner in a turret. The NC.1070 had retractable tricycle gear, the nose leg slightly offset to port and each leg with a large <b>single</b> <b>wheel.</b>|$|E
25|$|It had a circular-section {{semi-monocoque}} fuselage with a nose air intake. A range-only radar {{was fitted}} in the conical inlet cone {{of the air}} intake. The wings had a sweep angle of 55° at quarterchord. Two wing fences were fitted on the upper surface of each wing. The horizontal stabilizer was midway down the rear fuselage and two air brakes were fitted on its underside. The cockpit canopy was faired into the spine that {{ran the length of}} the top of the fuselage. The tandem undercarriage had a <b>single</b> <b>wheel</b> on the forward unit and twin wheels on the main unit with outrigger struts that retracted aft into wingtip fairings.|$|E
25|$|The AC Ace LM Prototype was {{a single}} piece from the year 1958 with the unusual chassis number LM5000, which John Tojeiro {{designed}} {{on behalf of the}} brothers Hurlock specifically for the AC factory at the 24 Hours of Le Mans and for further long distance racing]. The vehicle was only 737-kilogram and differed fundamentally from the standard model: it had a load-bearing, lightweight, tubular steel frame without the massive ladder structure, a new front axle with <b>single</b> <b>wheel</b> suspension, this time in the form of upper and lower triangular steering with coil spring / shock units, and a newly designed pendulum axle at the rear. The open aluminium body was much flatter, with larger overhangs at the front and rear and aerodynamically rounded with a lowered down front and high tail. It was designed by the body builder Cavendish Morton. The engine/ transmission unit, a tuned production unit, came from the Bristol Type 100D2 / S. After a test ride on the Brooklands circuit, just a few kilometres from the AC factory, the prototype, which was not yet mature, completed two assignments in 1958: in June as a factory car in the Le Mans 24-hour race and in September in the Rudac Racing Team at the RAC Tourist Trophy at the Goodwood Circuit. Due to changes in the regulations, the car was no longer able to compete in the next-class category in the FIA - Sportscar World Championship. The 'Bristol' engine / gearbox unit went back there, the racing car was sold without drive and later rebuilt. It still exists today as a collector's item.|$|E
50|$|The first {{prototype}} V-10 {{emerged with}} canted main undercarriage legs with <b>single</b> <b>wheels</b> {{on all four}} legs, {{as well as a}} retractable emergency escape chute extending below the cockpit and external auxiliary fuel tanks either side of the centre fuselage. As development progressed the main undercarriage legs were replaced with vertical units carrying twin wheels, twin nose undercarriage wheels after a period retaining the <b>single</b> <b>wheels,</b> an Auxiliary power unit (APU) installed behind the cockpit on the starboard side and emergency escape slide cables for use when the pallet is carried.|$|R
50|$|A single {{solid axle}} housing with 2 <b>single</b> <b>wheels</b> was {{used at the}} front while a single solid axle housing with 2 pairs of double wheels was used at the rear.|$|R
5000|$|The wheel size is 7.5-20" [...] {{and each}} wheel {{is held in}} place with ten nuts. Both axles on the bogie are fitted with double wheels as {{standard}} other than on the K-44ST, which made do with <b>single</b> <b>wheels</b> on the non-driven rearmost axle.|$|R
500|$|A special runway will be {{required}} for launch: {{it needs to be}} reinforced to tolerate the high equivalent <b>single</b> <b>wheel</b> load; necessitated by the Skylon's 325 tonnes takeoff weight; it will need to have heat resistant sections {{at the start of the}} take-off run and at the rotation zone; and it will have to be [...] long to allow the Skylon to accelerate to its [...] rotation speed, yet still have [...] to abort the launch and brake to a standstill if required. The Skylon would be able to land on a [...] Code F civil runway.|$|E
500|$|The prototype, {{internally}} {{designated as}} aircraft or TIS [...] "A", was a low-wing, all-metal, cantilever monoplane with two Mikulin AM-37 engines and a twin tail. The monocoque fuselage had four [...] ShKAS machine {{guns in the}} nose, each with 1,000 rounds. The pilot and the gunner/radio-operator were seated back-to-back, separated by an armor plate, under sliding canopies. The gunner had a dorsal ShKAS on a TSS-1 mount with 750 rounds {{that could be used}} once his canopy was slid forward. He also had a ventral ShKAS mounted below the armored floor that he could access by raising a hatch in the floor and kneeling down to fire the machine guns. The ventral gun was provided with 500 rounds of ammunition. A [...] UBK machine gun with 400 rounds and a [...] ShVAK cannon with 350 rounds were mounted in each wing root. Underneath the wings were two racks each capable of carrying a single [...] FAB-500 bomb. The wing had automatic leading edge slats and four split flaps separated by the engine nacelles. The <b>single</b> <b>wheel</b> landing gear retracted into the rear part of the nacelles, as did the tailwheel into the fuselage.|$|E

40|$|Within the BMBF project 'Unround Wheels', the unroundness, the {{mechanical}} properties and the microstructure of several wheel sets {{of different types}} have been analysed. The unroundness of rubber cushioned wheels is mainly influenced by the well-known threefold polygons which remain constant in shape and location during service-caused wear. No changes of {{the mechanical}} and microstructural properties of the tyres of the wheels in circumferencial direction have been found. <b>Single</b> <b>wheels</b> developed a more pronounced unroundness during service compared to rubber cushioned ones. The analyses of the <b>single</b> <b>wheels</b> showed a modification of the microstructure at the positions of several radius minima. It {{has been found that}} this modified structure differs only slightly from the surrounding perlitic matrix and is moreover strongly confined to the regions close to the running surface. This structure can therefore not be detected by the test methods used for quality control according to the UIC requirements. The state of service-caused hardening below the running surface of the tyres and <b>single</b> <b>wheels</b> revealed no relations to the measured unroundnesses. (orig.)

2500|$|The {{original}} 1904 gun and carriage {{was designed}} for the gun barrel and recoil mechanism to be moved rearwards on its carriage (i.e. the breech moved {{towards the end of}} the trail) when traveling. This was intended to equalise the weight born by the 2 gun carriage wheels and the 2 wheels of the limber towing the gun, hence minimising the weight born by any <b>single</b> <b>wheel.</b> Its cradle was difficult to make. [...] Mk I carriage had the usual field artillery wooden spoked wheels with iron tyres.|$|E
2500|$|To {{minimize}} drag, {{many modern}} gliders [...] have a <b>single</b> <b>wheel,</b> retractable or fixed, centered under the fuselage, which {{is referred to}} as monowheel gear or monowheel landing gear. Monowheel gear is also used on some powered aircraft, where drag reduction is a priority, such as the Europa XS. [...] Both monowheel gliders and monowheel power aircraft use retractable wingtip legs (with small castor wheels attached) to prevent the wingtips from striking the ground. [...] A monowheel aircraft may have a tailwheel (like the Europa) or a nosewheel (like the illustrated Schleicher glider).|$|E
2500|$|Any {{aircraft}} fuelled {{to fly the}} Atlantic {{was going}} to be heavy and undercarriage design was critical, as Martinsyde found to their cost. [...] The Atlantic used a split axle arrangement: on each side the short main leg extended from below the forward and innermost interplane strut. [...] There was a second member back to below the aft interplane strut and an axle from the large <b>single</b> <b>wheel</b> upwards and inwards, hinged to the lower fuselage longeron. [...] Shocks were absorbed by a combination of oleo-pneumatic and bungee elastic components. [...] At 21ft 0 in (6.40 m) the track was very wide.|$|E

2500|$|The Pensuti had {{a simple}} {{rectangular}} cross-section fuselage, with the open cockpit at the wing trailing edge. A three cylinder, inverted Y configuration Anzani air-cooled engine of 26kW (35hp) {{in the nose}} drove a two-blade propeller. [...] The triplane had a fixed undercarriage of wide track, with a <b>single</b> <b>wheel</b> {{at each end of}} a single axle with its extremities attached to extensions of the outer interplane struts. [...] Its cruciform tail had horizontal surfaces mounted {{on the top of the}} fuselage; the vertical surface was trapezoidal and extended equally above and below the fuselage. A small tailskid was carried on its lower tip.|$|E
2500|$|The {{fuselage}} seemed notably {{long and}} slender at the time, and the tail unit small. It was a semi-monocoque spruce structure, plywood covered {{apart from the}} G.R.P in the cockpit area, with the single piece canopy hinged on the starboard side. [...] The original tail unit was again a spruce structure with G.R.P. leading edges, its all moving tailplane mounted low on the fin, though later aircraft used a metal framed tailplane. The rudder and the rear part of the tailplane were fabric covered, the latter carrying trim tabs. On early aircraft the undercarriage was a non-retractable <b>single</b> <b>wheel</b> placed under {{the leading edge of}} the wing, plus a short skid under the nose and a tail bumper.|$|E
2500|$|AF Ser. No. 52-2220 – National Museum of the United States Air Force (NMUSAF), {{formerly}} The U.S. Air Force Museum, at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base near Dayton, Ohio. Its {{flight to}} the museum from Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Arizona on 30 April 1959 was the last flight of a B-36. This B-36J replaced the former Air Force Museum's original YB-36, AF Serial Number 42-13571 (see above). This {{was also the first}} aircraft to be placed in the Museum's new display hangar, and was not moved again until relocated to the Museum's latest addition in 2003.
