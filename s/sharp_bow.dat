500|$|While {{this was}} going on, the United States was {{negotiating}} with Great Britain over compensation for losses inflicted by British ships knowingly sold to the Confederacy during the Civil War (the Alabama Claims). Peru {{had been involved in}} an undeclared war with Spain (the Chincha Islands War) in 1864–66 and the US was not willing to prejudice its claims against the United Kingdom by performing a similar action for a belligerent power. Negotiations over the issue delayed the departure of the two monitors until January 1869, after Peru bought two steamers, Reyes and Marañon to tow the monitors. They only reached Pensacola, Florida, before machinery breakdowns forced them to wait 30 days for repairs to be completed. En route from Key West to the Bahamas, the ships were separated in heavy weather. When Reyes attempted to reattach her towrope after the storm moderated, she collided with the <b>sharp</b> <b>bow</b> of Manco Cápac and sank in 15 minutes. The monitor, short of coal and food, was forced to make port at Naranjo, Cuba, then held by rebels against the Spanish government. They allowed the ship to restock her supplies, but no coal was available so the crew loaded up enough wood to reach the Bahamas where they were able to send a local schooner to Nassau to inform the authorities of their plight. The ships finally reunited at St. Thomas in the Virgin Islands and had to wait for the Pachitea to arrive from Peru to tow Manco Cápac. While entering Rio de Janeiro on the night of 15 September, Manco Cápac ran aground; she was refloated the following day, but the damage required three months to repair. The ships were joined by the steam corvette [...] during this time. They reached the Strait of Magellan on 29 January 1870 and Callao on 11 May.|$|E

50|$|Hull shapes on sportboat's are {{typically}} {{designed so that}} the hulls plane at high speeds. These hull designs are characterized by fairly <b>sharp</b> <b>bows</b> {{to allow them to}} penetrate waves with reduced drag and a flatter underbody aft of the bow. The flat underbody develops lift as speeds increase and the hull rises higher in the water, which reduces the wetted area and decreases drag, allowing higher speeds to be achieved.|$|R

New Zealand trading scows travelled all around New Zealand as well as to Australia and to the west coast of America although the majority were based in the Hauraki Gulf of New Zealand.|$|R
5000|$|A galiot was {{a type of}} Dutch or German 20 to 400 GRT trade ship, {{similar to}} a ketch, with a rounded fore and aft like a fluyt. They had nearly flat bottoms to sail in shallow waters. These ships were {{especially}} favored for coastal navigation in the North Sea and Baltic Sea. To avoid excessive leeway, or leeward drift due to their flat bottoms, smaller vessels were usually fitted with leeboards. After 1830, a modernised type of galiot was developed that featured a <b>sharper</b> <b>bow</b> similar to a schooner. These vessels rarely had leeboards.|$|R

60|$|Then the carrying-steamer {{turned her}} <b>sharp</b> <b>bow</b> to the sou'-west, put on full steam, {{and made for}} the Thames--distant nearly 300 miles--with over 2000 trunks of fresh fish on board, for the breakfast, luncheon and dinner tables of the Great City.

60|$|For {{eight hours}} the Osprey {{struggled}} with the storm. The sea swept over her decks, and the dinghy was smashed into fragments, but the yacht rode with far greater ease than an ordinary vessel would have done, as, save for her bare mast, the wind had no hold upon her. There were no spars with weight of furled sails to catch the wind and hold her down; she was in perfect trim, and her <b>sharp</b> <b>bows</b> met the waves like a wedge, and suffered them to glide past her with scarce a shock, while the added buoyancy gained by reefing the bowsprit and getting the anchors below lifted her over seas that, as they approached, seemed as if they would make a clean sweep over her.|$|R
50|$|The boats pictured {{below are}} {{sometimes}} referred to as a dhow (as a kind of dhow) due to its location in the Indian Ocean dhow area. Some writers have mentioned that the jalbut was used first in the Persian Gulf and later it expanded to other areas. It is possible, as the number of crew and hull construction conform to the 19th century naval yawl-boat, that yals came in South-East Africa from the Russian Imperial Navy ships were running around the Africa or Soviet Navy ships were based in regions of the Indian Ocean and the yal influenced local jalbut or dhow design. Yals in Kenya can be supplied with one balanced mast. Note that the Russian yal and jalbut have a more similar style of dhow bow and stern also. The dhow bow has typically a much <b>sharper</b> <b>bow</b> configuration than that of its Kenyan counterparts.|$|R
6000|$|The {{use of the}} {{floating}} breakwater was to meet {{the full force of}} the seas and break them just before they reached the canoe. In spite of this some of them were so tremendous that, broken though they were, the swirling foam completely buried the craft for a second or two, but the <b>sharp</b> <b>bow</b> cut its way through, and the water poured off the deck and off the stooping figures like rain from a duck's back. Of course a good deal got in at their necks, sleeves, and other small openings, and wet them considerably, but that, as Moses remarked, [...] "was not'ing to speak ob." ...|$|E
6000|$|On {{came the}} large canoe like a war-horse of the deep, with the foam curling from its <b>sharp</b> <b>bow,</b> and the spear-heads of the savages glancing in the beams {{of the rising}} sun.

When about twenty yards distant, five or six of the savages in the bow rose, and laying aside their paddles, took up their spears. Jack and Peterkin raised their oars, while, with a feeling of madness whirling in my brain, I grasped my paddle and prepared for the onset. But before any of us could strike a blow, the sharp prow of the war-canoe struck us like a thunderbolt on the side and hurled us into the sea! ...|$|E
60|$|Heedless {{of these}} she {{continued}} her way. Her <b>sharp</b> <b>bow</b> crashed {{right through the}} side of the Danish boats, and having destroyed seven of them on her way she passed through the flotilla and continued her course. The dragon waved triumphantly from her mast as she passed under the walls of Yarmouth. These were crowded with Danes, who vainly showered arrows and javelins as she flew past, with the fleets of galleys rowing in her wake. A few minutes and she was out on the broad sheet of water beyond. The Danish galleys paused at the entrance. In so wild a storm they would have had difficulty in keeping their boats straight, while the great galley with her sails and oars would be able to maneuver freely, and could strike and run them down one by one.|$|E
60|$|Already the head-sails and the main-sail {{had been}} raised, while a hundred willing hands poled her {{off from the}} wharf. Now the wind caught her; heeling over, and quivering with eagerness like an {{unleashed}} hound she flew through the opening {{and out into the}} Channel. She was a famous little schooner, the Marie Rose of Winchelsea, and under her daring owner Cock Badding, half trader and half pirate, had brought back into port many a rich cargo taken in mid-Channel, and paid for in blood rather than money. Small as she was, her great speed and the fierce character of her master had made her a name of terror along the French coast, and many a bulky Eastlander or Fleming as he passed the narrow seas had scanned the distant Kentish shore, fearing lest that ill-omened purple sail with a gold Christopher upon it should shoot out suddenly from the dim gray cliffs. Now she was clear of the land, with the wind on her larboard quarter, every inch of canvas set, and her high <b>sharp</b> <b>bows</b> smothered in foam, as she dug through the waves.|$|R
60|$|The {{litter of}} {{splintered}} timbers, loose ropes and general wreckage on the forward {{deck of the}} Sea Bird gave her the appearance of having suffered more injury than really was the case. Instead of a <b>sharp,</b> narrow <b>bow,</b> as is usual on crafts of her kind, the hull flared very decidedly from the water-line to the deck, thus giving her greater carrying capacity; {{and it was this}} upper portion which had been cut into, leaving the lower part in fair condition.|$|R
6000|$|Falk was a Dane {{or perhaps}} a Norwegian, I can't tell now. At all events he was a Scandinavian of some sort, and a bloated {{monopolist}} to boot. It is possible he was unacquainted with the word, {{but he had a}} clear perception of the thing itself. His tariff of charges for towing ships in and out was the most brutally inconsiderate document of the sort I had ever seen. He was the commander and owner of the only tug-boat on the river, a very trim white craft of 150 tons or more, as elegantly neat as a yacht, with a round wheel-house rising like a glazed turret high above her <b>sharp</b> <b>bows,</b> and with one slender varnished pole mast forward. I daresay there are yet a few shipmasters afloat who remember Falk and his tug very well. He extracted his pound and a half of flesh from each of us merchant-skippers with an inflexible sort of indifference which made him detested and even feared. Schomberg used to remark: [...] "I won't talk about the fellow. I don't think he has six drinks from year's end to year's end in my place. But my advice is, gentlemen, don't you {{have anything to do with}} him, if you can help it." ...|$|R
60|$|Toward midday the fog lifted {{suddenly}} {{and the wind}} freshened, and lookouts were stationed in the tops. There was little hope indeed of any English merchantmen having come over so far toward the French coast, but British cruisers might be anywhere. A few distant sails could be seen far out on the horizon proceeding up or down channel; but the captain of La Belle Marie {{had no idea of}} commencing operations until very much further away from the shores of England. All day the vessel ran down the French coast; and although he was a captive, and every mile reeled off the log took him further from home, Ralph could not help admiring the speed at which the brig slipped through the water, cutting the waves with her <b>sharp</b> <b>bow</b> and leaving scarcely a ripple behind her, so fine and clean was her run. Very different was this smooth, gliding motion from the quick plunge and shock of the bluff-bowed fishing boat to which he was accustomed. The sails had been scrubbed until there was not a speck upon them. The masts were lofty and tapering, the rigging neat and trim, and every stay as taut as iron.|$|E
6000|$|This tale {{smacks of}} the salt sea. It is {{just the kind of}} story that the {{majority}} of boys yearn for. From the moment that the Sea Queen dispenses with the services of the tug in lower New York bay till the breeze leaves her becalmed off the coast of Florida, one can almost hear the whistle of the wind through her rigging, the creak of her straining cordage as she heels to the leeward, and feel her rise to the snow-capped waves which her <b>sharp</b> <b>bow</b> cuts into twin streaks of foam. Off Marquesas Keys she floats in a dead calm. Ben Clark, the hero of the story, and Jake, the cook, spy a turtle asleep upon the glassy surface of the water. They determine to capture him, and take a boat for that purpose, and just as they succeed in catching him a thick fog cuts them off from the vessel, and then their troubles begin. They take refuge on board a drifting hulk, a storm arises and they are cast ashore upon a low sandy key. Their adventures from this point cannot fail to charm the reader. As a writer for young people Mr. Otis is a prime favorite. His style is captivating, and never for a moment does he allow the interest to flag. In [...] "The Castaways" [...] he is at his best.|$|E

5000|$|In 1843, the A. A.

25|$|The {{new ship}} {{improved}} upon {{the design of}} Queen Mary with sufficient changes, including {{a reduction in the}} number of boilers to twelve instead of Mary twenty-four, that the designers could discard one funnel and increase deck, cargo and passenger space. The two funnels were self-supporting and braced internally to give a cleaner looking appearance. With the forward well deck omitted, a more refined hull shape was achieved, and a <b>sharper,</b> raked <b>bow</b> was added for a third bow-anchor point. She was to be eleven feet longer and of 4,000 tons greater displacement than her older sister ship, Mary.|$|R
25|$|The {{round bow}} of Murtaja was modeled after Eisbrecher I, a German {{icebreaker}} designed by engineer Ferdinand Steinhaus from Hamburg and built in 1871, even though Robert Runeberg, an experienced Finnish naval architect {{and son of}} the national poet of Finland, had recommended a <b>sharper</b> ice-cutting <b>bow</b> instead of the spoon-shaped one. The angle of the stem, {{the first part of}} the icebreaker to encounter ice and bend it under the weight of the ship, was 33 degrees. The hull was extremely strong for its size and the shell plating thickness at the ice belt, , was twice as thick as in the strongest winter ships at that time.|$|R
