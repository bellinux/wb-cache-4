5|$|A {{forward is}} a player {{position}} on the field whose responsibility is primarily offensive. Typically, a forward is dominant throwing with one hand or the other, and will primarily play {{on that side of}} the floor. Some players, known as creasemen, do not focus on one <b>side</b> <b>or</b> the other. These players instead focus their offensive attention near the crease area in front of the goaltender.|$|E
5|$|All these controversies {{have led}} {{ethnic groups in}} Macedonia to use terms in {{conflicting}} ways. Despite {{the fact that these}} terms may not always be used in a pejorative way, they may be perceived as such by the ethnic group to which they are applied. Both Greeks and ethnic Macedonians generally use all terms deriving from Macedonia to describe their own regional or ethnic group, and have devised several other terms to disambiguate the other <b>side,</b> <b>or</b> the region in general.|$|E

5|$|An old {{belief is}} that the {{southwest}} corner of a basement provides the most protection during a tornado. The safest place is the <b>side</b> <b>or</b> corner of an underground room opposite the tornado's direction of approach (usually the northeast corner), or the central-most room on the lowest floor. Taking shelter in a basement, under a staircase, or under a sturdy piece of furniture such as a workbench further increases chances of survival.|$|E
5|$|Before {{reaching}} Italy, Titus learnt that Galba {{had been}} murdered and replaced by Otho, the governor of Lusitania (modern Portugal). At the same time Vitellius and his armies in Germania had risen in revolt and prepared to march on Rome, intent on overthrowing Otho. Not wanting to risk being taken hostage by one <b>side</b> <b>or</b> the other, Titus abandoned the journey to Rome and rejoined his father in Judaea.|$|E
5|$|Bikes may {{experience}} {{a variety of}} longitudinal forces and motions. On most bikes, when the front wheel is turned to one <b>side</b> <b>or</b> the other, the entire rear frame pitches forward slightly, depending on the steering axis angle {{and the amount of}} trail. On bikes with suspensions, either front, rear, or both, trim is used to describe the geometric configuration of the bike, especially in response to forces of braking, accelerating, turning, drive train, and aerodynamic drag.|$|E

Three types of Force powers are introduced in this game: Light powers provide non violent advantages, Dark powers provide violent ones, while Neutral powers enhance athletic abilities. The game has two endings, {{depending on whether the}} player chooses to focus on the Light <b>Side</b> <b>or</b> the Dark Side.|$|E
5|$|On 2 April, local villagers buried Stojanović on a steep, wooded hillside. By {{the end of}} April 1942, most of the {{companies}} of the 4th Krajina National Liberation Partisan Detachment had joined the Chetnik <b>side</b> <b>or</b> disintegrated. Rade Radić became {{the commander of the}} Chetnik detachments in Bosanska Krajina. After the war, Radić was sentenced to death by the Supreme Court of Yugoslavia; he was executed by firing squad in 1945. Stojanović's remains were exhumed and reburied at Prijedor in November 1961.|$|E

5|$|The Exile defeats the Sith Lord, {{but before}} Traya dies, she {{delivers}} a prophetic {{vision of the}} future pertaining to the player's companions and the worlds that were visited {{over the course of the}} story. Depending on the Exile's alignment, they either order the destruction of Malachor V, escaping before it is destroyed, and travel into the Unknown Regions in search of Revan (light <b>side),</b> <b>or</b> remain on Malachor V as the new Dark Lord of the Sith (dark side).|$|E
5|$|The {{boundary}} line was nonetheless still {{fairly easy to}} cross. Local inhabitants were able to maintain fields on the other <b>side,</b> <b>or</b> even to live {{on one side and}} work on the other. Refugees were able to sneak across or bribe the guards, and the smuggling of goods in both directions was rife. The flow of emigrants remained large despite the increase in East German security measures: 675,000people fled to West Germany between 1949 and 1952.|$|E
5|$|The organelles of the endomembrane {{system are}} related through direct contact {{or by the}} {{transfer}} of membrane segments as vesicles. Despite these relationships, the various membranes are not identical in structure and function. The thickness, molecular composition, and metabolic behavior of a membrane are not fixed, they may be modified {{several times during the}} membrane's life. One unifying characteristic the membranes share is a lipid bilayer, with proteins attached to either <b>side</b> <b>or</b> traversing them.|$|E

5|$|The pony is {{typically}} a 2- to 5-litre cylinder. Its capacity determines {{the depth of}} dive and decompression duration for which it provides protection. Ponies may be fixed to the diver's buoyancy compensator (BC) or main cylinder behind the diver's back, or can be clipped to the harness at the diver's <b>side</b> <b>or</b> chest or carried as a sling cylinder. Ponies provide an accepted and reliable emergency gas supply but require that the diver is trained to use them.|$|E
5|$|When {{disturbed}} at its roosting site, {{an angry}} barn owl lowers {{its head and}} sways it from side to <b>side,</b> <b>or</b> the head may be lowered and stretched forward and the wings drooped while the bird emits hisses and makes snapping noises with its beak. A defensive attitude involves lying {{flat on the ground}} or crouching with wings spread out.|$|E
5|$|Who started {{shooting}} first is not certain; accounts by both participants and eyewitnesses are contradictory. The {{smoke from the}} black powder used in the weapons added to the confusion of the gunfight in the narrow space. Those loyal to one <b>side</b> <b>or</b> the other told conflicting stories, and independent eyewitnesses {{who did not know}} the participants by sight were unable to say for certain who shot first. The six or seven men with guns fired about 30 shots in around 30 seconds.|$|E

5|$|A soccer kick is {{performed}} when a fighter is standing to the <b>side</b> <b>or</b> {{in front of}} an opponent on the ground and kicks the grounded opponent's head. This is done in a style similar to an association football player kicking a football. Most practitioners aim to use their shins for the point of impact rather than the foot. While soccer kicks are usually delivered to the head, kicks {{to other parts of the}} body in a similar style are also referred to as soccer kicks.|$|E
5|$|Battles {{consist of}} both story-related boss fights and random {{encounters}} with standard enemies. Battles are turn-based, with the player characters and enemies moving around a small battle arena to perform actions. Once the player {{has laid out}} their strategy in the battle menu, the characters perform their assigned actions until the battle ends with victory for one <b>side</b> <b>or</b> the player pauses the action to change strategies. Instead of the grid-based battle system from the original Persona, party members and enemy units act in the same phase of a turn, rather than being restricted by their placement on the field.|$|E

The pair notice a red comet in the sky; Bran remarks that the men claim it is an omen of victory for one <b>side</b> <b>or</b> another in the war, but Osha insists it means one thing: dragons have returned.|$|E
