5|$|It {{is written}} in the same style as the Tory {{publications}} that attacked Dissenters, and was assumed by <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> be a genuine vindication of their view. The pamphlet raised embarrassing questions about {{the handling of the}} issue by the Tory ministry, and led to Defoe's arrest for seditious libel. His imprisonment, during which he fell into bankruptcy, was to have a lasting influence on his subsequent writings. In the years after his release, Defoe published several pamphlets that attempted to explain its purpose and his own views.|$|E
5|$|Puritans {{believed}} that God is sovereign {{over all of}} history and nature and that none of what were called his decrees would be frustrated. There was significant debate in the Assembly over the relationship of God's decree of predestination, or choice to save <b>some</b> <b>people,</b> <b>to</b> the redemption purchased by Christ's death. Many of the Reformed during this period taught that Christ died with the purpose only to save those who were eternally chosen to be saved, a doctrine called particular redemption. A vocal minority of the divines of the Assembly argued for a position known as hypothetical universalism. Edmund Calamy held such a view, and he argued that Christ's death, as well as saving {{those who had been}} chosen, offered salvation to all people on condition that they believe. The Assembly's Confession did not teach such a view, and its language is much more amenable to a particular redemption interpretation, but there is a general agreement among scholars that the Confession's language allows an hypothetical universalist interpretation.|$|E
5|$|The C5's {{users were}} an eclectic group. They {{included}} holiday camps who wanted C5s to rent to campers; the British Royal Family – Princes William and Harry each had one {{to drive around}} Kensington Palace before they {{were old enough to}} drive; Sir Elton John, who had two; the magician Paul Daniels, who bought a demonstration model he saw being driven around the BBC Television Centre car park; Sir Arthur C. Clarke, who had two shipped out to his home at Colombo in Sri Lanka; and the Mayor of Scarborough, Michael Pitts, who swapped his official Daimler for a C5. However, as The Times reported, some of the early buyers were disappointed by the vehicle's limitations, citing its slowness, its limited range and its inability to cope with steep hills, which led <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> return their C5s and ask for a refund.|$|E

5|$|The smaller ghetto was {{liquidated}} in mid-October 1941, {{which left}} the larger one. From late October to December 1941, the ghetto {{was subject to}} Aktions, selections of people for deportation and execution in Ponary. Gens was afraid that {{the actions of the}} Germans would result in a widespread massacre. He persuaded the Gestapo to let the Jewish police round up the deportees. Gens, backed by the Jewish police force, was responsible for deciding who was to be sent for resettlement and execution. In October, this brought him into conflict with the ghetto's rabbis, who argued Gens was acting against Jewish law. Gens disagreed and considered it to be lawful to sacrifice <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> save others.|$|E
5|$|The {{threat of}} the {{hurricane}} prompted widespread tropical cyclone warnings and watches along the eastern United States and prompted <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> evacuate. Damage was heaviest in southeastern North Carolina near New Bern, where the combination of high tides and swollen rivers flooded much of the town. Across North Carolina, the hurricane caused power outages, washed out roads, and damaged crops. Several houses were damaged, leaving about 1,000people homeless. Damage was estimated at $4.5million, and there were 21deaths in the state, mostly from drowning. Hurricane-force winds extended into southeastern Virginia, where there were two deaths. High tides isolated a lighthouse near Norfolk and covered several roads. Farther north, two people on a small boat were left missing in Maine, and another person was presumed killed when his boat sank in Nova Scotia.|$|E

25|$|On June 9, 1893, {{the front}} {{part of the}} {{building}} collapsed, killing 22 clerks and injuring another 68. This led <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> believe that the former church turned theater and storeroom was cursed. The building was repaired and used as a government warehouse until 1911.|$|E
25|$|Domestically, {{the lack}} of {{transparency}} in the Brazilian government and the little information made available about the nuclear program also led <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> believe that the military government would move forward with weaponization.

25|$|The {{original}} openings, {{with the}} sponsor names edited out, were revived on TV Land showings, with a TV Land logo superimposed {{to obscure the}} original sponsor's logo.

25|$|Urbanization {{might also}} force <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> live in slums when it {{influences}} land use by transforming agricultural land into urban areas and increases land value. During {{the process of}} urbanization, some agricultural land is used for additional urban activities. More investment will come into these areas, which increases the land value. Before some land is completely urbanized, there is a period when the land {{can be used for}} neither urban activities nor agriculture. The income from the land will decline, which decreases the people's incomes in that area. The gap between people's low income and the high land price forces <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> look for and construct cheap informal settlements, which are known as slums in urban areas. The transformation of agricultural land also provides surplus labor, as peasants have to seek jobs in urban areas as rural-urban migrant workers.|$|E

Horses replaced the dog as a pack animal and changed Native cultures in terms of warfare, trade, and even diet—the ability to run down bison allowed <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> abandon agriculture for hunting from horseback.|$|E
25|$|The map was {{featured}} {{on thousands of}} blogs before a Transport for London lawyer requested that the map be removed. It inspired <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> create anagram versions of their hometown's metro system with similar legal repercussions.

25|$|These {{factors include}} {{genetics}} and brain dysfunction and are studied by neuroscience. Psychological theories focus on personality traits and mental {{characteristics of the}} offender. Personality traits include sudden bursts of anger, poor impulse control, and poor self-esteem. Various theories suggest that psychopathology is a factor, and that abuse experienced as a child leads <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> be more violent as adults. Correlation has been found between juvenile delinquency and domestic violence in adulthood.|$|E

25|$|There is {{also the}} {{cognitive}} perspective. Theorists believe that people with panic disorder may experience panic reactions because they mistake their bodily sensations for life-threatening situations. These bodily sensations cause <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> feel as though {{are out of control}} which may lead to feelings of panic. This misconception of bodily sensations is referred to as anxiety sensitivity and studies suggest that the people who score higher on anxiety sensitivity surveys than other people, are fives {{times more likely to be}} diagnosed with panic disorder.|$|E
25|$|Alligators are {{generally}} timid towards humans {{and tend to}} walk or swim away if one approaches. This has led <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> the practice of approaching alligators and their nests {{in a manner that}} may provoke the animals into attacking. In Florida, feeding wild alligators at any time is illegal. If fed, the alligators will eventually lose their fear of humans and will learn to associate humans with food, thereby becoming both a greater danger to people, and at greater risk from them.|$|E
25|$|Unconditional {{election}} (also {{known as}} unconditional grace) is a Reformed doctrine relating to Predestination {{that describes the}} actions and motives of God in eternity past, before He created the world, where he predestinated <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> receive salvation, the elect, and the rest he left to continue in their sins and receive the just punishment, eternal damnation, for their transgressions of God's law as outlined in {{the old and new}} Testaments of the Bible. God made these choices according to his own purposes apart from any conditions or qualities related to those persons.|$|E
