A look-up table model for circuit simulation of the TFET was developed based on characteristics obtained from TCAD simulations. A TFET SRAM cell is proposed and its performance is analyzed. Our novel 8 T TFET SRAM cell operates at VDD= 1 V or lower. The Read and Write Static Noise Margins (SNM) are evaluated at 120 mV and 200 mV, with operation speeds of 3. 8 GHz and 800 MHz at VDD= 1 V in read and write, respectively. The cell leakage is less than 5 fA at VDD= 1 V.

40|$|Abstract. <b>Static</b> <b>random-access</b> <b>memories</b> (<b>SRAMs)</b> exhibit faults {{that are}} {{electrical}} in nature. Functional and electrical testing are performed to diagnose faulty operation. These tests are usually designed from simple fault models that describe the chip interface behavior without a thorough {{analysis of the}} chip layout and technology. However, there are certain technology and layout-related defects that are internal to the chip and are mostly time-dependent i nature. The resulting failures {{may or may not}} seriously degrade the input/output interface behavior. They may show up as electrical faults (such as a slow access fault) and/or functional faults (such as a pattern sensitive fault). However, these faults cannot be described properly with the functional fault models because these models do not take timing into account. Also, electrical fault models that describe merely the input/output interface behavior are inadequate to characterize every possible defect in the basic SRAM cell. Examples of faults produced by these defects are: (a) static data loss, (b) abnormally high currents drawn from the power supply, etc. Generating tests for such faults often requires a thorough understanding and analysis of the circuit technology and layout. In this article, we shall examine ways to characterize and test such faults. We shall divide such faults into two categories depending on the types of SRAMs they effect-silicon SRAMs and GaAs SRAMs...|$|R

5000|$|Electronic {{memory that}} does not require {{refreshing}} is available, called <b>static</b> <b>random-access</b> <b>memory</b> (<b>SRAM).</b> [...] SRAM circuits require more area, because an SRAM memory cell requires four to six transistors, compared to a single transistor and a capacitor for DRAM. As a result, data density is much lower in SRAM than in DRAM, and SRAM has higher price per bit. Therefore, DRAM {{is used for the}} main memory in computers, video game consoles, graphics cards and applications requiring large capacities and low cost. [...] The need for memory refresh makes DRAM timing significantly more complicated than SRAM circuits, but the density and cost advantages of DRAM justify this complexity.|$|E

50|$|In <b>static</b> <b>random-access</b> <b>memory</b> (<b>SRAM),</b> {{another type}} of {{semiconductor}} memory, the data is not stored as charge on a capacitor, but {{in a pair of}} a cross-coupled inverters, so SRAM {{does not need to be}} refreshed. The two basic types of memory have advantages and disadvantages. Static memory can be considered permanent while powered on, i.e. once written the memory stays until specifically changed and thus, its use tends to be simple in terms of system design. However, the internal construction of each SRAM cell requires six transistors, compared to the single transistor required for a DRAM cell, so the density of SRAM is much lower and price-per-bit much higher than DRAM.|$|E

Examples of non-volatile memory are flash memory (used as secondary memory) and ROM, PROM, EPROM and EEPROM memory (used for storing firmware such as BIOS).
