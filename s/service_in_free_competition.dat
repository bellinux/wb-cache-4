50|$|The first {{legislation}} in Canada dealing with competition {{was first introduced}} in 1889. The legislation prohibited conspiracies and agreements by businesses in restraint of trade. Inspired by the American Sherman Antitrust Act, the legislation was mostly incorporated into the Canadian Criminal Code two years later.

There is also a lot of scope for gamblers looking to identify good tips using such competitions as an information resource given some competitions publish current tips entered and historical records for the tipsters involved.|$|R
40|$|This article {{challenges}} {{a popular}} {{understanding of the}} Wealth of Nations. According to this reading of Smith, self-interested, economic actors <b>in</b> <b>free</b> <b>competition</b> with each other unintentionally create a self-constraining system. This system, the “invisible hand” which governs market transactions, functions both to regulate these self-interests and to produce economic growth and well-being such that no one actor or group of actors {{can take advantage of}} other actors or take advantage for very long. We suggest that this is a misreading of Smith. Smith is not a laissez- faire economist. Economic exchanges occur and markets are efficient, according to Smith, precisely because we are not merely non-tuistic, and economic growth depends on what today we call the rule of law. Smith was the Professor of Moral Philosophy at Glasgow, and argues precisely against, and may not have even imagined, a separation of ethics from economics, ethics from commerce; or ethics from his idea of a viable political economy. ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{concept of}} the social market economy {{received}} fundamental impulses from reflection and critique of historical economic and social orders, namely Smithian laissez-faire liberalism {{on the one hand}} and Marxian socialism on the other. Furthermore, various [...] "Third Way" [...] conceptions prepared the ground for the socio-economic concept. Already in the late nineteenth century, the Kathedersozialisten (Catheder Socialists), engaged in social reforms in the Verein für Socialpolitik, turning away from pure liberalism to demand a purposive state policy designed to regulate economic life and advocating a middle course between anarchic individualism, traditionalistic corporatism and bureaucratic etatism. In the early twentieth century, the Frankfurt sociologist and economist Franz Oppenheimer postulated a so-called [...] "Liberal Socialism", i.e. socialism achieved via liberalism, as the pursuit of a societal order, in which economic self-interest preserves its power and persists <b>in</b> <b>free</b> <b>competition.</b> This desirable order of freedom and equality was labelled by a later programmatic publication entitled Weder so - noch so. Der dritte Weg thus, nor thus. The third way.|$|R

40|$|In the {{introduction}} chapter it was claimed that greenhouse production has no longer arguments as a supply market. The {{products of the}} greenhouse industry became <b>in</b> <b>free</b> <b>competition</b> with those from field production {{from all over the}} world. In this competition the greenhouse industry has developed into a branch operative to a consumer market and through that self-condemned to bring better and cheaper products on the market than those from the open field. Many greenhouse products have a luxurious image, which even more is the case for flowers than for vegetables. That will be the reason that the critical view as exists on the production methods in agriculture in general, possible is even more critical on those used in greenhouses. Therefore, presentation of such products on a consumer market does not mean only high standards for quality, a great diversity and low prices, but also the production methods play a prominent part. Thus, greenhouse production will survive in future under conditions of sustainable production methods. This means low energy use, an effective use of raw materials and low environmental pollution...|$|R

Of course there are; and it is [...] to be hoped it will long {{continue}} so. If there are not some kinds [...] of commodities which foreigners can produce to better advantage [...] than we, then there will be no possibility of any foreign trade [...] whatever; since, if they can send us nothing, they can take [...] nothing from us. To deny this position, is to say that the export [...] and import trade of the United States (amounting in 1883 to more [...] than $1,500,000,000) is of no profit, and had best be entirely [...] destroyed, in order that a few industries in which we have no [...] natural advantages (and which employ less than one seventeenth of [...] the laborers in the United States) should be continued at a loss [...] to the general productiveness of our labor and capital, and so to [...] a general diminution of wages and profits.|$|R

The study empirically addresses several issues including: the nature of returns to scale, the impact of differing organizational forms on the volume of service produced and the efficiency of staffing patterns used by psychiatric clinics. An appraisal of two popular production functions is offered based on predictive performance. The results suggest the existence of decreasing retirns to scale; input hiring decisions that depart from cost minimization; and the potential important of a decentralized clinic organization for expansion of access to mental health services. production function allocative efficiency staffing...|$|R
