25|$|All {{nations in}} the Darkness series are monarchies with the {{exception}} of Kuusamo, in which seven princes have a hereditary power-sharing arrangement. While by no means all absolute monarchies, in all of them kings (or princes in Kuusamo) <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> executive power. There are foreign ministers, but no prime ministers and no cabinets - a foreign minister evidently reporting directly to the King. None of the people have family names, even if they are members of the nobility. To the extent that monarchs are limited in their power, the limitation comes mainly from hereditary aristocracies which still maintain many privileges of feudal times.|$|E

25|$|International {{experts have}} also {{weighed in on}} the controversies {{surrounding}} Brazil’s nuclear program. Hans Rühle, a former official from the German defense ministry who also worked with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) wrote an article in 2010 in which he indicated that Brazil {{might be on the}} path toward getting the bomb. He based his argument on the submarine project, which may involve the production of highly enriched uranium, and the fact that Brazil seeks to develop capacity to conduct all phases of the nuclear fuel cycle indigenously. While Rühle affirms that there is no hard proof of a nuclear weapons program in Brazil, he suggests that Brazil’s relations with Iran and defense of the Iranian nuclear program should be seen as a clue of the path Brazil wants to tread. Commenting on Rühle’s article, the Argentine scholars Federico Merke and Florencia Montal said that Brazil might develop the capacity to manufacture a bomb but that it didn’t <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> intention to do so.|$|E

500|$|An {{aspect of}} Vijayanagara {{architecture}} {{that shows the}} cosmopolitanism of the great city {{is the presence of}} many secular structures bearing Islamic features. While political history concentrates on the ongoing conflict between the Vijayanagara empire and the Deccan Sultanates, the architectural record reflects a more creative interaction. There are many arches, domes and vaults that show these influences. The concentration of structures like pavilions, stables and towers suggests they were for use by royalty. The decorative details of these structures may have been absorbed into Vijayanagara architecture during the early 15th century, coinciding with the rule of Deva Raya I and Deva Raya II. These kings are known to have employed many Muslims in their army and court, some of whom may have been Muslim architects. This harmonious exchange of architectural ideas must have happened during rare periods of peace between the Hindu and Muslim kingdoms. The [...] "Great Platform" [...] (Mahanavami Dibba) has relief carvings in which the figures <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> facial features of central Asian Turks who were known to have been employed as royal attendants.|$|E
500|$|Following his {{coronation}} at Pasargadae, Darius {{moved to}} Ecbatana. He {{soon learned that}} support for Bardiya was strong, and revolts in Elam and Babylonia had broken out. Darius ended the Elamite revolt when the revolutionary leader Aschina was captured and executed in Susa. After three months the revolt in Babylonia had ended. While in Babylonia, Darius learned a revolution had broken out in Bactria, a satrapy which had always been in favour of Darius, and had initially volunteered an army of soldiers to quell revolts. Following this, revolts broke out in Persis, the homeland of the Persians and Darius and then in Elam and Babylonia, followed by in Media, Parthia, Assyria, and Egypt. By 522 BCE, there were revolts against Darius {{in most parts of}} the Achaemenid Empire leaving the empire in turmoil. Even though Darius did not <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> support of the populace, Darius had a loyal army, led by close confidants and nobles (including the six nobles who had helped him remove Gaumata). With their support, Darius was able to suppress and quell all revolts within a year. In Darius's words, he had killed a total of eight [...] "lying kings" [...] through the quelling of revolutions. Darius left a detailed account of these revolutions in the Behistun Inscription.|$|E

[...] An early plan to continue the basic pattern of the previous records with one side of songs and the other instrumentals was dropped, Bowie instead adding lyrics that foreshadowed the more worldly concerns of his next album, Scary Monsters (And Super Creeps).|$|E
2500|$|McCulley {{also points}} out that human nature is {{inherently}} pro-cyclical, meaning, in Minsky's words, that [...] "from time to time, capitalist economies exhibit inflations and debt deflations which <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> potential to spin out of control. In such processes, the economic system's reactions to a movement of the economy amplify the movement – inflation feeds upon inflation and debt-deflation feeds upon debt deflation." [...] In other words, people are momentum investors by nature, not value investors. People naturally take actions that expand the high and low points of cycles. One implication for policymakers and regulators is the implementation of counter-cyclical policies, such as contingent capital requirements for banks that increase during boom periods and are reduced during busts.|$|E
2500|$|In the mid-1970s, Danzig {{started the}} Misfits, {{releasing}} the band's records {{through his own}} label, (originally known as Blank, then later as Plan 9). Danzig had attempted to get the Misfits signed to several record labels, {{only to be told}} that he would never have a career in music. The impetus for the band's name comes from Marilyn Monroe's last film, combined with Danzig considering himself to be a [...] "social misfit." [...] In October 1983, after releasing several singles and three albums, and gaining a small underground following, Danzig disbanded the Misfits due to increasing animosity among the band members and his dissatisfaction with their musical abilities. Danzig explained his decision: “It was difficult for me to work with those guys, because they weren't prepared to put in the hours practicing. I wanted to move things forward, and they didn't <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> same outlook. So {{it was time for me}} to move on.” ...|$|E

2500|$|The whole {{colony of}} army ants can consume up to 500,000 prey animals each day, so {{can have a}} {{significant}} influence on the population, diversity, and behavior of their prey. The prey selection differs with the species. Underground species prey primarily on ground-dwelling arthropods and their larvae, earthworms, and occasionally also the young of vertebrates, turtle eggs, or oily seeds. A majority of the species, the [...] "colony robbers", specialize in the offspring of other ants and wasps. Only a few species <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> very broad spectrum of prey seen in the raiding species. Even these species do not eat every kind of animal. Although small vertebrates that {{get caught in the}} raid will be killed, the jaws of the American Eciton are not suited to this type of prey, in contrast to the African Dorylus. These undesired prey are simply left behind and consumed by scavengers or by the flies that accompany the ant swarm. Only a few species hunt primarily {{on the surface of the}} earth; they seek their prey mainly in leaf litter and in low vegetation. About five species hunt in higher trees, where they can attack birds and their eggs, although they focus on hunting other social insects along with their eggs and larvae. Colonies of army ants are large compared to the colonies of other Formicidae. Colonies can have over 15 million workers and can transport 3000 prey (items) per hour during the raid period.|$|E
2500|$|Rebecca Sharp, called Becky, is Amelia's opposite, an {{intelligent}} {{young woman with}} a gift for satire. She is described as a short sandy haired girl who has green eyes {{and a great deal of}} wit. Fluent in both French and English, Becky has a beautiful singing voice, plays the piano, and shows great talent as an actress. Without a mother to guide her into marriage, Becky resolves that [...] "I must be my own Mamma". She thereafter appears to be completely amoral and without conscience and has been called the work's [...] "anti-heroine". She does not <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> ability to get attached to other people, and lies easily and intelligently to get her way. She is extremely manipulative and, after the first few chapters and her failure to attract Jos Sedley, is not shown as being particularly sincere. Never having known financial or social security even as a child, Becky desires it above all things. Nearly everything she does is with the intention of securing a stable position for herself, or herself and her husband after she and Rawdon are married. She advances Rawdon's interests tirelessly, flirting with men such as General Tufto and the Marquis of Steyne to get him promoted. She also uses her feminine wiles to distract men at card parties while Rawdon cheats them blind. Marrying Rawdon Crawley in secret was a mistake, as was running off instead of begging Miss Crawley's forgiveness. She also fails to manipulate Miss Crawley through Rawdon so as to obtain an inheritance. Although Becky manipulates men very easily, she does not even try to cultivate the friendship of most women. She is utterly hostile to Lady Bareacres and Lady Jane, the Dobbin sisters, and Lady Steyne see right through her. Amelia and (initially) Miss Crawley are exceptions to the rule.|$|E
