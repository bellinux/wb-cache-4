500|$|Nemesis Inferno is {{commonly}} compared with its Alton Towers counterpart, Nemesis, with many citing the latter as the superior ride. Nemesis has ranked favourably in Amusement Todays annual Golden Ticket Awards, {{being one of}} only seven roller coasters {{to appear in the}} top 50 steel roller coasters for all 15 years. Nemesis Inferno, on the other hand, has never made an appearance. In Mitch Hawker's worldwide Best Roller Coaster Poll Nemesis Inferno has an average ranking of 80, while Nemesis average ranking is 6. In a poll conducted by the Los Angeles Times, Nemesis received 37.93% of the vote for title of best roller coaster in England, while Nemesis Inferno received 0.32%. Jeremy Thompson of Roller Coaster Philosophy describes Nemesis as [...] "a vastly superior ride" [...] to Nemesis Inferno. Thompson describes Nemesis Inferno as [...] "something a bit better" [...] than his expectations; however, he was [...] "not <b>sure</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a particularly good ride or not".|$|E
500|$|Towards {{the end of}} 2009, Donna and Ringo's {{relationship}} {{goes through}} a rocky patch and during schoolies week, Donna sleeps with Andrew Robinson (Jordan Smith). Andrew later turns up in Erinsborough much to Donna's shock. Robbie said that Donna begins to [...] "freak out" [...] {{because she did not}} expect to see Andrew again and now he could tell everyone what happened between them. Robbie added [...] "Ringo and Donna were definitely going through a rocky patch for a while, but things were starting to look up. If she comes clean, they might find a way to work through it. But it doesn't look good." [...] Sam Clark said that Ringo and Donna's love for each other is very strong, but he was not <b>sure</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> strong enough to survive a betrayal. Robbie and Clark also said that the couple were heading in different directions career-wise and it would be challenging for them. Donna later begins an affair with Andrew after he helps her out and then puts pressure on her to give in to their attraction. Robbie said that Donna is [...] "flattered" [...] by Andrew's interest in her and when Ringo puts his career before her, Andrew tells Donna what she wants to hear. On Andrew and Donna's compatibility, Robbie said [...] "Andrew's more into the fashion scene than Ringo. He's suave and well-dressed, and he's an aspiring businessman. He's perfect for the world Donna is trying to get into." [...] However, Robbie admitted that Ringo is the perfect guy for Donna as they balance each other out well. Ringo leaves for Sydney after finding out Donna cheated on him and when he returns his relationship with Donna is [...] "frosty". Robbie commented on the ex-couple's future and said [...] "I think at the moment it's quite in the balance. It's right up to the network at the moment as to whether they'll get back together or not." ...|$|E
2500|$|Cyrus was in Ecbatana {{when the}} revolt had already begun. In Nicolaus's account, when Cyrus was let go, he fled from Astyages {{because he knew}} he might {{eventually}} be executed if Astyages discovered that Cyrus's true motive [...] was to join and fight alongside his father, if necessary. This is because when Cyrus was half way to becoming an adult he learned that Astyages had already tried to execute {{him when he was}} an infant, but it did not succeed, and as time passed, Astyages came to respect Cyrus for the similarities of character they shared. Meanwhile, Astyages was not <b>sure</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> safe to let Cyrus return to his homeland. Astyages eventually did, and it helped terminate the Median kingdom. When Astyages was tricked by Harpagus twice into believing Cyrus was not a danger to him, even when the revolt and impending signs of danger had already happened, Cyrus saw how easily Astyages could be swindled. For this reason, Cyrus may have taken advantage of this to bring freedom to his own kingdom.|$|E

2500|$|The couple {{arrived at}} the scene around 11:45p.m. After about ten minutes, a man walked up to Hollis' driver-side door and flashed a {{flashlight}} in his face, blinding him. Hollis, not <b>sure</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a prank or {{if he had been}} mistaken for someone else, told the man, [...] "Fellow, you've got me mixed up with someone else. You've got the wrong man." [...] The man had a pistol and told him something like, [...] "I don't want to kill you fellow, so do what I say", and ordered them {{to get out of the}} car. They both got out through the driver-side door. The man told Hollis to [...] "take off your [...] britches." [...] Larey pleaded with Hollis to please take them off, believing that if he did they would not be hurt, but, after Hollis removed his trousers, he was struck twice in the head with a heavy, blunt object. Larey explained in an interview three months later with Texarkana Gazette reporter Lucille Holland that the noise was so loud she thought he had been shot, but she learned later it was the sound of his skull cracking.|$|E

60|$|L. The {{fresh air}} of the Norwood hills is, or was, my dear; but they are spoiling that with smoke {{as fast as they}} can. And the palace (as they call it) is a better place for them, by much, than the old fair; and it is always there, instead of for three days only; and it shuts up at proper hours of night. And good use may be made of the things in it, if you know how: but as for its {{teaching}} the people, it will teach them nothing but the lowest of the lower Pthah's work--nothing but hammer and tongs. I saw a wonderful piece, of his doing, in the place, only the other day. Some unhappy metal-worker--I am not <b>sure</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> not a metal- working firm--had taken three years to make a Golden eagle.|$|E

60|$|Now {{the counsel}} {{did not give}} a decided opinion against the prosecution, but upon {{the face of the}} case they {{expressed}} great doubts upon it; for, with such a strange, disorderly, imperfect, and confused case as was laid before them, they could not advise a prosecution; and in my opinion they went no further. And, indeed, upon that case that went before them, I, who am authorized by the Commons to prosecute, do admit that a great doubt might lie upon the most deciding mind, whether, under the circumstances there stated, a prosecution could be or ought to be pursued. I do not say which way my mind would have turned, upon that very imperfect state of the case; but I still allow so much to their very great ability, great minds, and sound judgment, that I am not <b>sure,</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> res integra, I would not have rather hesitated myself (who am now here an accuser) what judgment to give.|$|E

Is Britain less likely to try and police the world, just behind the American behemoth, if the French are close to hand, whispering restraint in Britain’s ear?
