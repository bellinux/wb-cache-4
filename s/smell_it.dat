The {{nose of the}} bobcat is pinkish-red, {{and it has a}} base color of gray or yellowish- or brownish-red on its face, sides, and back. The pupils are round, black circles and will widen during nocturnal activity to maximize light reception. The cat has sharp hearing and vision, and a good sense of <b>smell.</b> <b>It</b> is an excellent climber, and swims when it needs to, but normally avoids water. However, cases of bobcats swimming long distances across lakes have been recorded.|$|E
5|$|The wet nose, or rhinarium, is a trait {{shared with}} other strepsirrhines {{and many other}} mammals, but not with haplorrhine primates. Although it is claimed to enhance the sense of <b>smell,</b> <b>it</b> is {{actually}} a touch-based sense organ that connects with a well-developed vomeronasal organ (VNO). Since pheromones are usually large, non-volatile molecules, the rhinarium is used to touch a scent-marked object and transfer the pheromone molecules down the philtrum (the nasal mid-line cleft) to the VNO via the nasopalatine ducts that travel through the incisive foramen of the hard palate.|$|E
5|$|Phallus impudicus, known colloquially as {{the common}} stinkhorn, is a {{widespread}} fungus recognizable for its foul odor and its phallic shape when mature, the latter feature giving rise to several names in 17th-century England. It is a common mushroom in Europe and western North America, where it occurs in habitats rich in wood debris such as forests and mulched gardens. It appears from summer to late autumn. The fruiting structure is tall and white with a slimy, dark olive colored conical head. Known as the gleba, this material contains the spores, and is transported by insects which are attracted by the odor—described as resembling carrion. Despite its foul <b>smell,</b> <b>it</b> is not poisonous and immature mushrooms are consumed in parts of France and Germany.|$|E

25|$|Ammonia or azane is a {{compound}} of nitrogen and hydrogen with the formula NH3. The simplest pnictogen hydride, ammonia is a colourless gas with a characteristic pungent <b>smell.</b> <b>It</b> is a common nitrogenous waste, particularly among aquatic organisms, and it contributes significantly to the nutritional needs of terrestrial organisms by serving as a precursor to food and fertilizers. Ammonia, either directly or indirectly, is also a building block for the synthesis of many pharmaceutical products and is used in many commercial cleaning products.|$|E

25|$|Pure {{water is}} usually {{described}} as tasteless and odorless, although humans have specific sensors that {{can feel the}} presence of water in their mouths, and frogs {{are known to be}} able to <b>smell</b> <b>it.</b> However, water from ordinary sources (including bottled mineral water) usually has many dissolved substances, that may give it varying tastes and odors. Humans and other animals have developed senses that enable them to evaluate the potability of water by avoiding water that is too salty or putrid.|$|E
25|$|All {{sound is}} {{inherently}} powerful. If a hunter kills a lion {{he can see}} it, touch it, feel it and <b>smell</b> <b>it.</b> But if he hears a lion he must act, fast, because {{the sound of the}} lion signals its presence and its power. Speech is a form of sound that shares this common power. Like other sounds, it comes from within a living organism. A text can be ignored; it is just writing on paper. But to ignore speech can be unwise; our basic instincts compel us to pay attention.|$|E

25|$|Fatalities from {{contaminated}} tempe bongkrèk {{were once}} {{common in the}} area where it was produced. Thus, its sale is now prohibited by law; clandestine manufacture continues, however, due to the popular flavor. The problem of contamination is not encountered with bean and grain tempehs, which have a different composition of fatty acids that is not favorable for the growth of B. gladioli, but encourages growth of Rhizopus instead. When bean or grain tempeh has the proper color, texture and <b>smell,</b> <b>it</b> is a very strong indication the product is safe. Yellow tempe bongkrèk is always highly toxic due to toxoflavin, but tempe bongkrèk with a normal coloration may still contain lethal amounts of bongkrek acid.|$|E

500|$|In 1992, Madonna {{released}} her controversial Sex book and her fifth studio album Erotica, both containing explicit sexual imagery {{and pictures of}} voyeuristic fantasies. She also starred in the erotic thriller Body of Evidence. During the same period, Madonna's appearance on David Letterman's talk show was noted for her controversial behavior. It included the singer using profanity that required censorship on television, and handing Letterman a pair of her panties and asking him to <b>smell</b> <b>it.</b> This made the episode the most censored in American network television talk-show history, {{while at the same}} time garnering the show some of the highest ratings it ever received. All releases were panned by critics and fans alike, calling Madonna a sexual renegade and claiming that [...] "she had gone too far" [...] and that her career was over. A song titled [...] "I'll Remember" [...] was included in the soundtrack of the film With Honors in early 1994. The song was well received by critics and was seen as Madonna's first positive step into reconnecting with the general public and repairing the damage that her provocative personality had caused to her career.|$|E
500|$|Madonna {{continued}} her provocative imagery in the 1993 erotic thriller, Body of Evidence, a film which contained scenes of sadomasochism and bondage. It was poorly received by critics. She also {{starred in the}} film Dangerous Game, which was released straight to video in North America. The New York Times described the film as [...] "angry and painful, and the pain feels real." [...] In September 1993, Madonna embarked on The Girlie Show World Tour, in which she dressed as a whip-cracking dominatrix surrounded by topless dancers. In Puerto Rico she rubbed the island's flag between her legs on stage, resulting in outrage among the audience. In March 1994, she appeared as a guest on the Late Show with David Letterman, using profanity that required censorship on television, and handing Letterman a pair of her panties and asking him to <b>smell</b> <b>it.</b> The releases of her sexually explicit book, album and film, and the aggressive appearance on Letterman all made critics question Madonna as a sexual renegade. Critics and fans reacted negatively, who commented that [...] "she had gone too far" [...] and that her career was over.|$|E
500|$|The road meanders through forest {{lands and}} fields as it {{continues}} northwesterly toward the Log Slide. This location gives motorists {{a chance to}} hike down to the lakeshore to see the Au Sable Point Lighthouse peeking above the trees {{to the east and}} the Grand Sable Dunes to the west. The American Motorcyclist Association said of this segment of the roadway that it is [...] "so close to the beach and lake that [...] can <b>smell</b> <b>it</b> when [...] rides." [...] The lighthouse is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and can be accessed from the Hurricane River Campground. The roadway crosses the Hurricane River and turns southerly away from Lake Superior. H-58 turns back eastward near Grand Sable Lake, running between the north shore of the lake and the Grand Sable Dunes on the south shore of Lake Superior. At the intersection with William Hill and Newburg roads, H-58 makes a 90° curve and travels northward for about three-quarters of a mile (1.2km). The road turns back eastward next to the Sable Falls parking lot. This lot also marks the eastern end of the segment of H-58 that road crews do not plow. The roadway exits the national park and runs to the community of Grand Marais. On the edge of town is the Woodland Township Park where hikers can walk along the beach {{to the base of the}} Grand Sable Dunes that form the east end of the Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore. These dunes reach heights of up to [...] at a 35° incline. Hikers are advised to use the access points along H-58 to get to the dunes instead of attempting the climb up the face.|$|E
