5|$|By 1989, {{the airline}} had 156 {{employees}} and 150,000 annual passengers. On 9 February 1989, Norsk Air's board {{decided to start}} the termination process if a sale was not made. The employees agreed to cut their wages 10 percent and not take sick days during the sales process. One of the main difficulties in the sales process was that Widerøe {{could not afford to}} purchase Norsk Air's hangar at the airport. Widerøe intended to continue operations at both Torp and Geiteryggen for a year to <b>see</b> <b>where</b> <b>to</b> establish its base. In fear that the airline would move to Skien, the municipalities of Sandefjord and Stokke, who owned the majority of the airport, agreed to purchase the hangar, which had been built for NOK20 million in 1987, for NOK11.5 million. Half the hangar would be rented to Widerøe for NOK500,000 per year. This was insufficient to cover the NOK1.2 million in annual interest costs.|$|E
2500|$|A {{major upgrade}} {{to the airport}} took place in 1985. The runway was {{extended}} to , a new terminal building was constructed and Norving built a new hangar with space for three Saab 340. The ownership of the airport was transferred to an inter-municipal enterprise owned by Skien Municipality (40%), Porsgrunn Municipality (30%), Bamble Municipality (10%) and Telemark County Municipality (10%). [...] The official opening took place in June 1987, following investments of NOK50 million. That year the airport had 60,000 passengers. Norving's Skien-based operations were bought by Norsk Air in 1988. Norsk Air was based at Sandefjord Airport and initially intended to operate out of both airports. The airline was bought by Widerøe in 1989 and Widerøe decided to continue operations at both Torp and Geiteryggen for a year to <b>see</b> <b>where</b> <b>to</b> establish its base.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm quite willing so to do," [...] {{returned}} Mr. Job, whose {{confidence and}} moral courage increased each instant. [...] "Quite willing; and am rather anxious for it, if I could only <b>see</b> <b>where</b> <b>to</b> go to inquire." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This?" [...] Miss Woodburn gave {{it another}} flirt, {{and looked at}} it with a glance of dawning recognition. [...] "Oh, this is a table-covah. Wouldn't you lahke <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>where</b> it's <b>to</b> go?" ...|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Portal vein and tributaries. (Middle colic vein {{hidden behind}} pancreas, {{but it is}} {{possible}} <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>where</b> it drains <b>to</b> the superior mesenteric.) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he said, [...] "I'm {{up against}} things and can't see my way. That is, I do <b>see</b> <b>where</b> I mean <b>to</b> go, but don't know if I ought." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am here, my friends, in {{the middle}} of a bush. I dare not move. It is so dark I cannot <b>see</b> <b>where</b> <b>to</b> put my foot. Can you lower me a lantern, and I will see if I can climb up?" ...|$|E
60|$|They advanced. They passed {{within a}} few feet of her, and observing the {{condition}} of the woman and the man, she saw that these must be led because for a certain reason they could not <b>see</b> <b>where</b> <b>to</b> go,--oh! never mind what she saw.|$|E
6000|$|The Princess stood dismayed at {{the sight}} of the terrible skein. If she did but turn it over to <b>see</b> <b>where</b> <b>to</b> begin, she broke a {{thousand}} threads, and not one could she disentangle. At last she threw it into the middle of the floor, crying: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't let's be silly," [...] she said, [...] "time's too short. Look, Jon, you {{can just}} <b>see</b> <b>where</b> I've got <b>to</b> cross the river. There, round the bend, where the woods begin." ...|$|R
60|$|Thus {{was spent}} {{a night of}} anxiety. The next day was little better, and the night {{following}} was worse. In addition to {{the violence of the}} wind and constant breaking over them of heavy seas, the darkness became so intense that it was difficult <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>where</b> damage <b>to</b> the fastenings occurred, and repairs became almost impossible.|$|R
6000|$|... “In that case,” the man said, “it is {{probable}} that they will search my house to-day. By this time they know every little corner of it, so I cannot <b>see</b> <b>where</b> I am <b>to</b> conceal you.” ...|$|R
60|$|The Guardian {{unlocked}} {{a closet}} and took from it a white robe, which the soldier threw over Ojo. It covered him {{from head to}} foot, but had two holes {{just in front of}} his eyes, so he could <b>see</b> <b>where</b> <b>to</b> go. In this attire the boy presented a very quaint appearance.|$|E
6000|$|... "Cap'n Bill isn't around here," [...] he said, {{letting his}} eyes wander over the dim garden, [...] "so {{we must go}} somewhere else {{if we want to}} find him. Besides, it's fast getting dark, and if we want {{to find a place to}} sleep we must get busy while we can <b>see</b> <b>where</b> <b>to</b> go." ...|$|E
60|$|She {{accordingly}} {{continued in}} her hiding-place until evening came on, and then, having recovered in some degree, by this interval of rest, from the excitement, fatigue, and terror {{which she had}} endured, she came out into a path again, leading little Edward by the hand. The moon was shining, and this enabled her to <b>see</b> <b>where</b> <b>to</b> go.|$|E
6000|$|... "You're a daisy!" [...] Devine exclaimed. [...] "It wouldn't {{surprise}} {{me if you}} thought of buying up the Canadian Pacific. All the same, I don't <b>see</b> <b>where</b> you're going <b>to</b> get the money. What do you think, Hester?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He's a-walking in his sleep. I wish we {{was allowed}} to follow him and <b>see</b> <b>where</b> he's going <b>to.</b> There, he's turned down by the tobacker-field. Out of sight now. It's a dreadful pity he can't rest no better." ...|$|R
60|$|At last {{we were on}} them, but paused {{because we}} could not <b>see</b> exactly <b>where</b> <b>to</b> strike and knew, each of us, that our first blow must be the last and fatal. A cloud had come up and dimmed what light there was, and we must {{wait for it to}} pass. It was a long wait, or so it seemed.|$|R
60|$|The others agreed {{readily to}} this {{sensible}} suggestion, {{and at once}} the boy began to harness Jim to the buggy. When all was in readiness the three took their seats in the buggy and Jim started cautiously along the way, Zeb driving while the Wizard and Dorothy each held a lighted lantern so the horse could <b>see</b> <b>where</b> <b>to</b> go.|$|E
6000|$|... "Hold your tongue, or I'll put my whip {{across your}} back. Get down {{and help me}} pull a log away. The horses couldn't <b>see</b> <b>where</b> <b>to</b> put their feet." [...] Jacko {{did as he was}} bid, and worked hard, but still grumbled at having been called a duffer. The animals were quickly led over, the logs were replaced, and the two were again {{galloping}} through the forest.|$|E
60|$|Stripped nearly {{naked in}} order that the murderous wolves might <b>see</b> <b>where</b> <b>to</b> strike without inflicting too serious an injury, he faced them with what was very like {{a smile on his}} face, while the blood was already flowing down his body from tiny gashes, and I {{understood}} that however much of anguish might come to him, never a cry of pain could be rung from his lips.|$|E
25|$|He {{also became}} engaged {{at that time}} to Caroline E. Jagger of Albany, New York. She was to follow Corbett to Portland to be married there once she had <b>seen</b> <b>where</b> she was <b>to</b> be living. Corbett and she were married in Portland, Oregon, in February 1853.|$|R
60|$|The boy now {{realized}} that King Kaliko had tricked him, and while professing to receive {{him as a}} guest had plotted to separate him from his comrades. One way had been left, however, by which he might escape and he decided <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>where</b> it led <b>to.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said I, [...] "but what {{troubles}} {{me is that}} queen's income. I don't <b>see</b> now <b>where</b> it's <b>to</b> come from, for old Goliah wont {{allow his}} people to be taxed for her, that's certain." ...|$|R
60|$|The flying magian {{ran from}} one {{apartment}} to another {{until he reached}} a dark room, into which the blind instinct of fear prompted him to rush, in the vain hope of concealment. Gobryas was foremost; he seized the wretched fugitive by the waist, and struggled to hold him, while the magian struggled to get free. Gobryas called upon Darius, who was close behind him, to strike. Darius, brandishing his sword, looked earnestly into the obscure retreat, that he might <b>see</b> <b>where</b> <b>to</b> strike.|$|E
6000|$|... "Cook!" [...] {{said the}} person addressed, with majestic scorn. [...] "I’m no cook; I’m Bill Simmons, the ’Battersea Bruiser,’ an’ I shipped on this ere little tub all for your dear captin’s sake. I’m {{going to put}} sich a ’ed on ’im that {{when he wants to}} blow his nose he’ll have to get a looking-glass to <b>see</b> <b>where</b> <b>to</b> go to. I’m going to give ’im a licking every day, and when we get to Fairhaven I’m going to foller ’im ’ome and tell his wife about ’im walking out with my sister." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{darkness}} {{fell and}} in it escape for me from that guarded place was impossible, since I could not <b>see</b> <b>where</b> <b>to</b> set my feet and one false step on the steep rock would have meant my death. From the direction of Rorke's Drift I could hear continuous firing; evidently some great fight was going on there, I wondered vaguely--with what result. A little later also I heard the distant tramp of horses and the roll of gun wheels. The captains below heard it too and said one to another {{that it was the}} English soldiers returning, who had marched out of the camp at dawn. They debated one with another whether {{it would be possible to}} collect a force to fall upon them, but abandoned the idea because the regiments who had fought that day were now at a distance and too tired, and the others had rushed forward with orders to attack the white men on and beyond the river.|$|E
50|$|During the Rake at the Gates of Hell arc, his {{presence}} {{alone in the}} world warped every human mind before eventually creating chaos and carnage. He also has a degree of control over the sins of mortal men, <b>seen</b> <b>where</b> he managed <b>to</b> kill a group of fishermen using their deviousness.|$|R
6000|$|If I {{could find}} a higher tree [...] Farther and farther I should <b>see,</b> [...] <b>To</b> <b>where</b> the grown-up river slips [...] Into the sea among the ships, ...|$|R
6000|$|... "In {{the morning}} I'll {{go with you}} <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>where</b> we ought <b>to</b> stake the other claims," [...] {{he said to the}} men. [...] "You can, of course, locate where you like, but this job will need some capital and {{you want to get the}} best {{frontage}} you can. That will help us later." ...|$|R
60|$|But {{to bring}} in the Devil playing at Push-pin with the World, or like Domitian {{catching}} Flies, that is to say, doing nothing to the purpose; this is not only deluding our selves, but putting a Slur upon the Devil himself; and, I say, I shall not dishonour Satan so much as to suppose any thing in it: However, as I must have a care too how I take away the proper Materials of Winter Evening Frippery, and leave the good Wives nothing of the Devil to fright the Children with, I shall carry the weighty Point no farther. No doubt the Devil and Dr. Faustus were very intimate; I should rob you of a very significant [6] Proverb, if I should so much as doubt it; no doubt the Devil shew'd himself in the Glass to that fair Lady who look'd in it to <b>see</b> <b>where</b> <b>to</b> place her Patches; but then it should follow too that the Devil is an Enemy to the Ladies wearing Patches, and that has some Difficulties in it which we cannot so easily reconcile; but we must tell the Story, and leave out the Consequences.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nimmie Amee still {{declared}} {{she would}} marry me, as she still loved me {{in spite of}} the Witch's evil deeds. The girl declared I would make the brightest husband in all the world, which was quite true. However, the Wicked Witch was not yet defeated. When I returned to my work the axe slipped and cut off my head, which was the only meat part of me then remaining. Moreover, the old woman grabbed up my severed head and carried it away with her and hid it. But Nimmie Amee came into the forest and found me wandering around helplessly, because I could not <b>see</b> <b>where</b> <b>to</b> go, and she led me to my friend the tinsmith. The faithful fellow at once set to work to make me a tin head, and he had just completed it when Nimmie Amee came running up with my old head, which she had stolen from the Witch. But, on reflection, I considered the tin head far superior to the meat one--I am wearing it yet, so you can see its beauty and grace of outline--and the girl agreed with me that a man all made of tin was far more perfect than one formed of different materials. The tinsmith was as proud of his workmanship as I was, and for three whole days, all admired me and praised my beauty. Being now completely formed of tin, I had no more fear of the Wicked Witch, for she was powerless to injure me. Nimmie Amee said we must be married at once, for then she could come to my cottage and live with me and keep me bright and sparkling.|$|E
60|$|He simply tells this story: he {{does not}} {{endeavour}} to explain. We are left to surmise who these Watchers of the Living may be, or, if they are indeed the Dead, why they should so closely and passionately watch a world they have left for ever. It may be--indeed to my mind it seems just--that, when our life has closed, when evil or good {{is no longer a}} choice for us, we may still have to witness the working out of the train of consequences we have laid. If human souls continue after death, then surely human interests continue after death. But that is merely my own guess at the meaning of the things seen. Plattner offers no interpretation, for none was given him. It is well the reader should understand this clearly. Day after day, with his head reeling, he wandered about this strange lit world outside the world, weary and, towards the end, weak and hungry. By day--by our earthly day, that is--the ghostly vision of the old familiar scenery of Sussexville, all about him, irked and worried him. He could not <b>see</b> <b>where</b> <b>to</b> put his feet, and ever and again with a chilly touch one of these Watching Souls would come against his face. And after dark the multitude of these Watchers about him, and their intent distress, confused his mind beyond describing. A great longing to return to the earthly life that was so near and yet so remote consumed him. The unearthliness of things about him produced a positively painful mental distress. He was worried beyond describing by his own particular followers. He would shout at them to desist from staring at him, scold at them, hurry away from them. They were always mute and intent. Run as he might over the uneven ground, they followed his destinies.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he answered, [...] "I guess I can {{weather the}} trouble, {{though it will}} mean a long, stiff pull and a general whittling down of expenses. I spent most of last night {{figuring}} on the latter, and I've got my plans worked out, though it was troublesome <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>where</b> I was <b>to</b> begin." ...|$|R
40|$|Professor Carol Nicolls {{suggests}} that academics and postgraduate students in {{education should be}} consciously positioned to influence current and future policy. Through their research they could be contributing to the foundations for building the evidence base for good policy in education, and through their research and scholarship, be <b>seen,</b> <b>where</b> necessary, <b>to</b> publicly challenge {{the status quo in}} policy both now and in the future. All of this is more likely to ensure that we achieve the very best outcomes for all in education in Australia...|$|R

His mission ended on March 15, 1540, when he travelled back to Portugal together with Francis Xavier.|$|R
