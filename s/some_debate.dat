5|$|There is <b>some</b> <b>debate</b> {{as to the}} {{decompression}} {{requirements for}} helium during short-duration dives. Most divers do longer decompressions; however, some groups like the WKPP have been pioneering the use of shorter decompression times by including deep stops.|$|E
5|$|North Korea was disqualified for {{cheating}} at the 32nd IMO in 1991 {{and again}} at the 51st IMO in 2010. It {{is the only country}} to have been accused of cheating. There is <b>some</b> <b>debate</b> as to whether North Korea was actually cheating, especially in the 51st IMO.|$|E
5|$|The {{extent to}} which cryovolcanism really occurs is a subject of <b>some</b> <b>debate,</b> as water, being denser than ice by about 8%, has {{difficulty}} erupting under normal circumstances. At Enceladus, it appears that cryovolcanism occurs because water-filled cracks are periodically exposed to vacuum, the cracks being opened and closed by tidal stresses.|$|E

5|$|The {{issue of}} whether birds should {{continue}} to be actively collected for research {{has been the subject of}} <b>some</b> <b>debate</b> among ornithologists (examples of this can be found in the lively exchanges between Remsen and Bekoff & Elzanowski, between Vuilleumier and Donegan, and between Dubois & Nemesio and Donegan).|$|E
5|$|The match {{record for}} the British Isles is {{considered}} complete, however the match record of the Victorian Rules and Association football matches in the Australian leg of the tour {{is a matter of}} <b>some</b> <b>debate.</b> The list of Victorian Rules matches was compiled by historian Greg Ryan and relied heavily on coverage of the matches in the Melbourne press. The frequency of matches suggests the list is complete.|$|E
5|$|Three {{subspecies}} {{were identified}} by Goldman in 1935, M.p. columbiana, M.p. pacifica, and M.p. pennanti. Later research has debated whether these subspecies could be positively identified. In 1959, E.M. Hagmeier concluded that the subspecies are not separable based on either fur or skull characteristics. Although <b>some</b> <b>debate</b> still exists, in general it is recognized that the fisher is a monotypic species with no extant subspecies.|$|E

5|$|Two endings {{were created}} for the special. The {{alternative}} ending is included on the DVD release of Green Wing, along with deleted scenes from the episode. The alternative ending was planned to be used if a third series {{was going to be}} commissioned, as this ending was much more ambiguous. It is known that the actors wanted the alternative ending, but after <b>some</b> <b>debate,</b> it was not shown.|$|E
5|$|When {{the meat}} was shriveling, flaking, and falling off, one {{anonymous}} donor gave the gallery $260 for replacement meat. (This number was of <b>some</b> <b>debate,</b> with $350 worth of meat listed in one vegetarian magazine.)

5|$|Although <b>some</b> <b>debate</b> remains {{whether it}} was six or seven championships held at one time, the {{contracts}} of Broken Matt (Hardy) and Brother Nero (Jeff Hardy) expired with TNA Wrestling on February 27, 2017 at midnight after negotiations were stalled by the company. Having previously filmed television weeks in advance, in storylines Matt and Jeff remained the TNA Tag Team Champions as their contracts expired.

50|$|Earlier in the campaign, on 11 January, {{a debate}} {{took place between}} Nigel Farage and Carwyn Jones, {{who was at the}} time the First Minister of Wales and leader of the Welsh Labour Party.

50|$|<b>Some</b> <b>debates</b> have pervaded {{the field}} of {{psychology}} since its genesis. Perhaps {{one of the most}} salient ones deals with the nature of personality.

5|$|In early January 1944, {{in order}} to rectify a {{shortage}} of labour in the primary production sector of the New Zealand economy, the New Zealand Government, {{in consultation with the}} United States and the United Kingdom, decided that it was necessary to release manpower from the military back into the civilian workforce. After <b>some</b> <b>debate,</b> it was decided that this manpower would come from the 3rd Division, while the 2nd New Zealand Division, which was fighting in Italy, would be allowed to remain intact.|$|E
5|$|The {{albatrosses}} comprise between 13 and 24 species (the {{number of}} species is still a matter of <b>some</b> <b>debate,</b> 21 being the most commonly accepted number) in four genera. These genera are the great albatrosses (Diomedea), the mollymawks (Thalassarche), the North Pacific albatrosses (Phoebastria), and the sooty albatrosses or sooties (Phoebetria). The North Pacific albatrosses {{are considered to be}} a sister taxon to the great albatrosses, while the sooty albatrosses are considered closer to the mollymawks.|$|E
5|$|The {{incident}} {{occurred at a}} time of unusually strained relations between the Muslim world and the West. This was a result of decades of Muslim immigration to Europe, recent political struggles, violent incidents such as September 11 and a string of Islamist terrorist attacks and Western interventions in Muslim countries. The cartoons were used as a tool by different political interests {{in a wide variety of}} local and international situations. <b>Some</b> <b>debate</b> surrounded the relationship between Islamic minorities and their broader societies, and the legal and moral limits that the press should observe when commenting on that minority or any religious minority group.|$|E

5|$|The nearby hill forts of Figsbury Ring, Quarley Hill, and Bury Hill were {{probably}} established {{around the same}} time as Danebury. All of a similar size, the hillforts were generally equally spaced, commanding similar sized territories and resources. There is <b>some</b> <b>debate</b> whether hill forts were purely defensive structures, and to what extent they were occupied. Cunliffe interprets the ramparts as essentially defensive, although he concedes that they may have been a means of displaying wealth and power, as Danebury would have been visible for miles around.|$|E
5|$|The {{proximate}} {{cause of the}} conflict was {{the death of a}} Praying Indian named John Sassamon in 1675. Sassamon had been an advisor and friend to King Philip; however, Sassamon's conversion to Christianity had driven the two apart. Accused in the murder of Sassamon were some of Philip's most senior lieutenants. A jury of twelve Englishmen and six Praying Indians found the Native Americans guilty of murder and sentenced them to death. To this day, <b>some</b> <b>debate</b> exists whether King Philip's men actually committed the murder.|$|E
5|$|There {{has been}} <b>some</b> <b>debate</b> over the {{relationship}} of Mammuthus to Loxodonta or Elephas. Some DNA studies suggest Mammuthus is {{more closely related to}} the former while others point to the latter. However, analysis of the complete mitochondrial genome profile of the woolly mammoth (sequenced in 2005) supports Mammuthus being more closely related to Elephas. Morphological evidence supports Mammuthus and Elephas as sister taxa while comparisons of protein albumin and collagen have concluded that all three genera are equally related to each other. Some scientists believe a cloned mammoth embryo could one day be implanted in an Asian elephant's womb.|$|E
5000|$|Historians {{have argued}} the {{etymology}} of Silwad's name. <b>Some</b> <b>debated</b> {{that it is}} derived from the words lisan and wad, meaning [...] "tongue of the valley," [...] as the town is surrounded by mountains from all sides, while the town appears as a tongue amidst the mountains. Others claim that [...] "Silwad" [...] comes from the words sal and wad, meaning [...] "a running valley." ...|$|R

30|$|During the {{preparation}} of the Guideline, there were <b>some</b> <b>debates</b> about the latter, but I am firmly of the belief that if the fascia is correctly sutured for all incisions more than 7 Â mm, then hernia formation should be almost impossible. Nevertheless, it was pointed out by peer reviewers that they had seen omental herniation through an umbilical port as small as 5 Â mm, so it was included in the recommendations.|$|R
5|$|There was <b>some</b> <b>debate</b> {{about the}} concept within the USAF, as many groups were {{attempting}} to gain funding for their own pet projects, like nuclear powered bombers. In {{a repeat of the}} earlier Toronto Star release, in 1955 an extensive article appeared in Look magazine that, among other claims, speculated that current UFO sightings were Soviet-built saucers. The article went on to describe such an aircraft with diagrams that were clearly influenced by the Avro design.|$|E
5|$|This was at {{odds with}} the Eisenhower administration's Atoms for Peace program, and {{resulted}} in pressure on federal officials to develop a civilian nuclear power industry that could help justify the government's considerable expenditures on the nuclear weapons program. In 1953 the Atomic Energy Commission presented a set of draft amendments to the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy for consideration. After <b>some</b> <b>debate,</b> this resulted in the Atomic Energy Act of 1954.|$|E
5|$|After {{the fall}} of France, the U.S. Army studied the reasons behind the {{effectiveness}} of the German campaign against the French and British forces. One aspect that was highlighted by this study was the use of self propelled artillery; however, by 1941, there was little available in the U.S. Army's arsenal {{that could be used in}} such a role. The Army had a number of M1897A5 guns, sufficient for the mass-production for such a weapon, and the M3 half-track was coming into production. After <b>some</b> <b>debate,</b> the Army decided to place M1897A5 guns on the M3 half-track chassis, which was designated the T12 GMC. The M1897A5 gun was originally adapted for the M3 chassis by placing it in a welded box riveted to the chassis behind the driver's compartment. It was accepted by the Army on 31 October 1941.|$|E
50|$|Actually {{there are}} <b>some</b> <b>debates</b> among the {{scholars}} how the Châ€™olan language should be classified.

And then the language of the hieroglyphs in turn becomes the ancestor of Châ€™ortiâ€™.The relationship shows as the chart below.|$|R
