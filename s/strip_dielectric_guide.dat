50|$|Ribline is a {{dielectric}} line machined {{from the}} substrate {{as a single}} piece. It has similar properties to insular imageline. Like imageline, it must be precisely machined. <b>Strip</b> <b>dielectric</b> <b>guide</b> is a low permittivity strip (usually plastic) placed on a high permittivity substrate such as alumina. The field is largely contained in the substrate between the strip and the ground plane. Because of this, this format {{does not have the}} precise machining requirements of standard imageline and ribline. Inverted <b>strip</b> <b>dielectric</b> <b>guide</b> has lower conductor losses because the field in the substrate has been moved away from the conductor, but it has higher radiation losses.|$|E

40|$|A {{software}} tool {{is presented to}} help in the teaching of the electromagnetic theory of open dielectric waveguides. The study of the modal spectrum of canonical closed waveguides is a basic topic in any course of electromagnetics or microwave engineering. However, surface-wave modes and leaky-wave modes in open waveguides are not yet so well known in the academic environment. Nevertheless, this study is necessary, since novel open dielectric waveguides have been proposed for millimeter-wave and optical electronics {{in order to reduce the}} conductor losses. Therefore, the comprehension of the phenomenon of leaky-wave modes and behavior is indispensable for any future microwave engineer, who has to work with the new millimeter-wave and optical technologies. This program constitutes the first tool explicitly conceived to help the teaching of the working principles of open <b>dielectric</b> <b>guides</b> loaded with printed circuits, and the associated practical leaky-wave antennas (LWAs). The code can be a very good supplement to understand how practical leaky-wave antennas work, after a basic theoretical understanding of leaky waves has been first obtained. From the appearance of leaky-wave modes in open waveguides to the design of a backward-to-forward leaky-wave antenna, some simple and very clarifying step-by-step exercises are presented to illustrate these not-so-well-known concepts. Although the program refers to a specific type of open <b>dielectric</b> <b>guides</b> (laterally-shielded, top-open, stub-loaded, rectangular dielectric waveguides with planar perturbations), the results are applicable to any open <b>dielectric</b> <b>guide,</b> helping to teach the basic theory and topics relating to leaky- and surface-wave modes in uniform and periodic structure...|$|R

40|$|A new leaky nonradiative <b>{{dielectric}}</b> <b>guide</b> with a double-layer {{dielectric slab}} is investigated {{in this paper}} by combining a multimode network theory with a mode-matching method. Numerical results show that proper selection of the permittivities can vary the leakage constant over a wide range, A leakage constant larger than 10 % of free-space wavenumber can be obtained easily without entering the cutoff region. Leaky-wave antennas with shorter length and medium gain can thus be developed. in addition, the present leaky guide possesses the advantages of simple fabrication and physical stability.

We show a proof of principle, with one-dimensional gratings, that the distinctly different nature of the gratings can provide complementary enhancement mechanisms, which we further exploit by tailoring the specific periodicities, and by introducing blazing. Having different periods at specific interfaces allows for more efficient diffraction into both plasmonic and <b>dielectric</b> <b>guided</b> modes. In addition, grating specific blazing exposes extra modes to normal incident light through symmetry breaking. Multiple optimization routes are possible depending on the choice of photonic phenomena...|$|R
40|$|Inefficient {{coupling}} between <b>dielectric</b> <b>guided</b> {{mode and}} plasmon mode {{has been overlooked}} in the past. The mechanism in it is essentially different from the conventional coupling between dielectric modes. Based on qualitative theoretical analysis, we proposed two methods to strengthen the coupling between dielectric waveguide modes and exterior plasmon whispering gallery modes. One is using a U-shaped bent waveguide to break the adiabatic mode conversion process, {{and the other is}} to render the dielectric mode of higher-order to reach phase matching with plasmon mode. Both the transmission spectrum of waveguide and the energy spectrum of cavity demonstrate that the coupling efficiencies can be greatly improved. These simple configurations are potential for wide applications, for example, tunable integrated optical devices, nanolasers and sensors...|$|R
40|$|The present work {{presents}} a <b>strip</b> <b>Dielectric</b> Breakdown (DB) model for an electrically impermeable crack in a piezoelectric material. In the DB model, the dielectric breakdown region {{is assumed to}} be a strip along the crack's front line. Along the DB strip, the electric field strength is equal to the dielectric breakdown strength. The DB model is exactly in analogy with the mechanical Dugdale model. Two energy release rates emerge from the analysis. An applied energy release rate appears when evaluating J-integral along a contour surrounding both the <b>dielectric</b> breakdown <b>strip</b> and the crack tip, whereas a local energy release rate appears when evaluating J-integral along an infinitesimal contour surrounding only the crack tip.

40|$|Theoretical {{analyses}} and experimental {{observations of the}} failure and fracture behaviors of piezoelectric materials are presented. The theoretical analyses {{are based on the}} Stroh formalism. A <b>strip</b> <b>dielectric</b> breakdown model is proposed to estimate the effect of electrical non-linearity on the piezoelectric fracture of electrically insulated cracks. The reviewed experiments include the indentation fracture test, the bending test on smooth samples, the fracture test on prenotched or pre-cracked samples, the environment-assisted fracture test, etc. For electrically insulated cracks, the experimental results show a complicated fracture behavior under combined electrical and mechanical loading. Fracture data are greatly scattered when a static electric field is applied. For electrically conducting cracks, the experimental results demonstrate that static electric fields can fracture poled and depoled lead zirconate titanate (PZT) ceramics. A charge-free zone model is introduced to understand the failure behavior of conducting cracks in the depoled lead zirconate titanate ceramics under electrical and/or mechanical loading. These theoretical and experimental results indicate that fracture mechanics concepts are useful {{in the study of the}} failure behaviors of piezoelectric materials. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.
