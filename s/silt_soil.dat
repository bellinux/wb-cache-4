40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the impact of soil types and properties on coastal saline soil reclamation and the response of plant growth to the reclamation processes in two soils. Two very heavy coastal saline soils were reclaimed in a three-year trial using drip irrigation with saline water. Chinese roses (Rosa chinensis) were planted, and soil indexes, growth characters, ion absorption and dry matter production were determined. Our results showed that significant salt leaching occurred in both soils, and the effect during the early period of reclamation was better in sandy loam than <b>silt</b> <b>soil.</b> There were higher emergence and survival rates of plants in sandy loam soil due to the rapid reclamation process, while plant growth and dry mass were greater in <b>silt</b> <b>soil</b> due to good fertilizer and water conservation. Most roots were present in the 0 - 20 -cm profile in both soils, but the fine root length value in <b>silt</b> <b>soil</b> was relatively high. These results indicate that water and nutrient management differed in the two soils. During soil reclamation, more attention should be paid to nutrient supply and maintaining soil moisture in sandy loam and to rapidly establishing suitable soil root-zone environments for plant emergence in <b>silt</b> <b>soil.</b> (C) 2015 Elsevier B.

In this study, the effects of soil types on the composition of Cabernet Sauvignon grapes and wine produced in the Helan Mountains were evaluated. Three different representative soil types [...] aeolian, sierozem and irrigation <b>silting</b> <b>soil</b> were studied. The compositions of grapes and wines were measured, and in addition, the weights of 100 -berry samples were determined.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the experimental determination of variability in permeability of sandy <b>silt</b> <b>soil</b> by blending with fly ash. The grain size, porosity, {{structure of the}} soil, specific gravity of the soil, viscosity and temperature are important factors in varying the permeability of the soil. Permeability is the flow conduction property of the soil. The void ratio with in the soil plays {{a vital role in}} varying the permeability. By blending with finer grains like fly ash in the soil with sandy silt the permeability will vary. This phenomenon can be observed through experimentation in the laboratory. The variation in the drainage property of the soil also observed. This paper includes all the variation in the flow property of the soil (sandy <b>silt</b> <b>soil)</b> by adequate mixing of the fly ash. Fly ash is a major solid by-product of the combustion of pulverized coal in thermal power plants. Five soil samples with different mixes of sandy silt and fly ash were obtained for comparison. Rigorous laboratory tests were performed to determine the individual properties. Tests such as Specific Gravity Test, Atterberg Limit Test (Liquid Limit, Plastic Limit and Plasticity Index), Relative Density Test, Particle Size Analysis, and Permeability Test were performed. From the results of these tests, it is observed that increase in fly ash content in soil Maximum Dry Density (MDD) decreased and Optimum Water Content (OMC) increased. Permeability is decrease with increase in fly ash in sandy <b>silt</b> <b>soil.</b> The decrease in permeability of sandy <b>silt</b> <b>soil</b> helps in stabilizing this soil and consequently increases the shear parameters of the sandy <b>silt</b> <b>soil...</b>|$|E

The stability of subgrade slope decreases as the strength degradation, while the evolution is different, which is semi-parabolic in the lower subgrade but rectilinear in the higher subgrade.
