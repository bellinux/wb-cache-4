50|$|The Keepers was {{the name}} given to a race of {{humanoid}} beings that inhabited the planet Urak. These skeletal beings native world was a barren world where their race struggled to exist. Their existence changed when their homeworld was visited by the Guardians of the Universe who were seeking a place that {{would serve as a}} <b>storage</b> <b>ground</b> for the Green Lantern Power Batteries. This came after it became apparent that members of the Green Lantern Corps began to suffer when their Power Rings ran out of charge. Thus, the Oans sought out a means of addressing this issue by providing easy access between a Green Lantern and their Power Rings. They learnt that the unique properties of Urak allowed for a temporal conduit between a Power Battery and Power Ring whereupon they made a pact with the native species. In exchange for rebuilding their world, the race would act as protectors and custodians of the Power Batteries that were stored in the Emerald Plains. Thus, the native inhabitants of Urak became known as the Keepers due to their new role. The unique composition of their homeworld led to the Power Batteries growing as if they were crops within the Emerald Fields. Though they held {{an important role in the}} Green Lantern Corps, their existence was not known to the Green Lanterns with even their Power Rings unable to identify the species.These conditions, however, led to a form of symbiosis as the Power Batteries provided energy that nourished Urak and fed its people. The energy of Willpower was thus infused into the singular DNA of the Keepers and provided them an amazingly potent force of will. As a result, they became beings that possessed an innate reserve of willpower which was overwhelming and not in proportion with their relatively common forms. This trait made their armor completely immune to the effects of Lantern Energy Construct that derived from Willpower in the Emotional Spectrum. Their strength of will made them capable of actually willing their own bodies to shut down and kill themselves. The lush homeworld allowed their race to prosper as shepherds in this role. Events changed for the race in 2012 when the Oans arrived on Urak and removed all the Power Batteries from the Keepers care who they referred to as undeserving parasites. This act led to Urak returning to its formerly barren existence with the Keepers struggling to simply survive, so they begin to attack another planets in order to steal their resources.|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn this paper, {{the seismic}} {{responses}} of base-isolated broad and slender cylindrical liquid <b>storage</b> <b>ground</b> tanks are investigated. Three types of isolation systems are considered. The seismic responses are {{compared with the}} corresponding responses of non-isolated tanks. Moreover, a parametric {{study was conducted to}} evaluate the effect of tank aspect ratio, isolation period, and friction coefficient of the FPS system on key responses of the tank. It was found that, base isolation is quite effective in reducing the earthquake response of ground liquid storage tanks. Generally speaking, 50 – 90 % reductions in both base shear and impulsive displacement responses were observed. The convective displacement was observed to be 20 – 70 % higher than that associated with fixed base tanks leading to an essential need of increasing the clear height above the liquid surface. Base isolation was found to be more effective for slender tanks in comparison with broad tanks...|$|E

40|$|The {{ecosystem}} {{provides us}} with all {{the goods and services}} that form the base of our economic, social cultural and spiritual life. Good scientific information will be required for managing the environment by using the Ecosystem approach. The groundwater is considered as a possible supplementary of alternative water source, and some factories already started shifting their water source from surface water to groundwater. Uncontrolled use of groundwater, however, may induce serious environmental problems, e. g., land subsidence, saltwater intrusion to the aquifer. The establishment of a balanced multi-sector and integrated groundwater resources and environmental management plan is deemed urgent to attain a sustainable groundwater resources use and to maintain a favorable groundwater quality in the Langat Basin. To achieve sustainable lifestyle in large scale ecosystem requires integrated and holistic approaches from all stakeholders. Through Aquifer Storage Recovery (ASR) it was determined a revolutionized water resources management, providing a sustainable supply while minimizing the environmental impact of surface storage.

Educational institutions are pursuing more training for less money, aerospace companies are reducing the cost of gaining ight heritage and the government is cutting budgets and their response times. Organizations are accomplishing this improved efficiency by moving away from large-scale satellite projects and developing pico and nanosatellites following the CubeSat specifications. One of the major challenges of developing satellites to the standard CubeSat mission requirements is meeting the exceedingly tight power, data and communication constraints. A MATLAB toolbox was created to assist the CubeSat community with understanding these restrictions, optimizing their systems, increasing mission success and decreasing the time building to these initial requirements.

Os frutos utilizados foram provenientes de um experimento em que, durante nove anos, aplicaram-se doses crescentes de K 2 O no solo. As maçãs foram coletadas na safra 1999 / 2000 e armazenadas em atmosfera controlada (AC) nas condições de 1 kPa O 2 / The {{objective of}} this study was to evaluate the effects of soil K fertilization on fruit mineral composition, quality and storability of 'Fuji' apples. Fruits from a longterm trial that evaluated apple response to annual soil applications of K 2 O for nine years were harvested in the 1999 / 2000 growing season and stored in controlled atmosphere (CA) of 1 kPa O 2 /< 0. 3 kPa CO 2 or 1 kPa O 2 / 2. 0 kPa CO 2. Apples were analyzed for quality and ripening parameters at harvest, after eight months of CA storage, and after seven days at 20 ºC after harvest and after CA storage. The increase on soil K fertilization raised fruit mass, diameter, titratable acidity, red color, and K contents while decreased flesh firmness. There was a significant interaction between K fertilization and storage atmospheres only for internal breakdown: when fruits were stored under 1 kPa O 2 /< 0. 3 kPa CO 2 no differences were determined between treatments.

40|$|Brown rot {{can lead}} to {{considerable}} fruit losses in peach orchards and cultural practices likely to contend this major disease have to be promoted. In order to limit peach brown rot incidence in a three-year-old mid-season maturing peach orchard of the cultivar 'Ruby Bright', four combinations of irrigation and soil management treatments were assessed: conventional (Cony) irrigation (I) and soil management (S) (Convl+ConvS); modified (Mod) irrigation and soil management (Modl+ConvS); conventional irrigation and modified soil management (Convl+ModS); and modified irrigation and soil management (ModI+ModS). Conventional irrigation and soil management in the tree row consisted of irrigation scheduling using tensiometer readings and herbicide use, respectively. Modified irrigation and soil management in the tree row consisted of water deprivation during stage III of fruit development and ground cover with white clover, respectively. For four consecutive years (2010 - 2013), in {{the conditions of the}} Middle Rhone Valley in France, the lowest and highest brown rot incidence were detected under (Modl+ModS) and (Convl+ConvS), respectively, whereas brown rot incidence under (Modl+ConvS) and (Convl+ModS) was intermediate. This lower brown rot incidence under the modified treatments occurred from one to two weeks before fruit maturity and was still observed for several days in post-harvest <b>storage.</b> <b>Ground</b> cover with white clover was shown to limit water availability in the soil after heavy rainfall compared to bare soil, probably limiting peach growth variations, well-known as a possible source of detrimental micro cracks at the fruit surface. This suggests that under our conditions appropriate cultural practices, water deprivation and a clover crop cover in the tree row possibly decrease peach disease sensitivity, which might lead to the reduced use of pesticide sprays to control brown rot in the orchard...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of heat recovery {{on the energy}} impact of air infiltration, and the systematic error due to the steady-state method were studied both experimentally and theoretically. Two methodologies suitable for measurement of the overall heat loss factors in full-size houses have been developed and validated. Dynamic measurements of Infiltration Heat Exchange effectiveness (IHEE), which expresses the air infiltration heat recovery as {{a fraction of the}} classical value of air infiltration energy consumption, showed that results from earlier steady-state measurements can be approximately applied to dynamic conditions when solar radiation is not present. However, this study has shown {{for the first time that}} IHEE is strongly dependent on air flow direction due to the impacts of air flow on the recovery or rejection of solar radiation energy. IHEE values greater than one and less than zero have been measured. These values are impossible in the absence of solar radiation. The results highlight the necessity of considering the air infiltration heat recovery and improving the current design methods for calculating the heating and cooling loads in buildings. The experimental and theoretical investigation show that steady-state methodology can: *be used without systematic error in the case of constant air flow *result in IHEE prediction error in a range of 1 % to 8 % when one-way dynamic air f 1 ow is present *cause significantly larger error when balanced dynamic air flow is present. The SSP (Single input and Single output data Pair) method can identify UAo of an enclosure using short term measurement data, typically a few hours long. It has overcome most of the typical problems in UA 0 identification, such as errors due to thermal <b>storage,</b> <b>ground</b> heat transfer, inter-correlated multi-inputs, and solar radiation. The STAM (Short Term Average Method) has also been developed which makes it possible for the first time to determine both the UA and the solar aperture precisely under outdoor conditions from a two-day or a three-day test.

Wether goats from five breed-types, Boer/Spanish, Spanish/Angora, Boer/Angora, Spanish, and Angora, assigned to grain-fed or pasture-fed, and grain-fed Boer/Spanish intact males were used to conduct this study. After slaughter, carcasses were evaluated for conformation and quality, then fabricated into standard bone-in primals. Leg and loin primals were randomly assigned to oven-broiling as steaks or oven-roasting to determine flavor and palatability of goat meat. Grain-fed racks were assigned to one of 12 packaging and storage treatments to determine shelf-life characteristics of goat meat. Shoulders from each breed-type and feeding treatment were formulated into ground goat patties containing 100 %, 75 %, or 55 % goat meat with ground beef to evaluate flavor and texture of ground goat meat. Grain-fed Boer/Spanish goat carcasses had higher (P< 0. 05) carcass and leg conformation scores, larger (P< 0. 05) rib-eye areas, and greater (P< 0. 05) leg circumferences than other grain-fed breed-types. Except for Angora goats, grain-fed carcasses had superior conformation and heavier live and carcass weights. Grain-fed goat carcasses had greater (P< 0. 05) actual and adjusted fat thickness; higher (P< 0. 05) marbling, feathering, and flank streaking; and lower (P< 0. 05) Warner-Bratzler shear values. After 14 days of refrigerated storage and 2 days of retail display, microbial levels were greater (P< 0. 05) than 6 log?? CFU/cm? on all goat racks or displayed steaks. With increased frozen storage, APCs tended to decrease. Lipid oxidation for frozen, vacuum-package rack primals increased (P< 0. 05) from 3 to 6 months. Retail storage of steaks from frozen goat racks tended to decrease slightly with increased retail display time, indicated by increasing log counts. Goat meat aromatic increased (P< 0. 05) as percentage of goat meat increased in ground goat patties. Increasing the percentage of goat meat from 55 % to 75 % increased (P< 0. 05) musty, grassy/grainy, and gamey aromatics and musty aftertaste. Boer/Spanish grain-fed goat carcasses seem to offer carcass conformation superior to other grain-fed breed-types.
