40|$|This {{report is}} {{the first in a series}} that {{examines}} approaches to uniting the efforts of paid national service participants and unpaid volunteers. It draws on the experiences of 14 national service programs that were represented at the Combining Service and Volunteerism Conference in Philadelphia in February 1998. This conference was the first major activity in P/PV's Spectrum of Service (SOS) project, a national initiative funded by The Ford Foundation to explore the ways in which programs can unite the work of paid and unpaid service providers in strengthening educational supports for children and youth. The report describes the origins of relatively new programs that systematically combine the work of paid and unpaid service providers, the challenges and <b>strategies</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>developed,</b> and the six good practices that have begun to emerge from these early efforts...|$|E
40|$|The {{financial}} crisis has highlighted {{the vulnerability of}} International Financial Centres (IFCs). However, very {{little is known about}} specialised IFCs, in particular about the impact on their niche activities and the <b>strategies</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>developed</b> to return to growth. This article addresses these questions by examining the case of Luxembourg. Firstly, the findings suggest that the increasing concentration of financial services companies has over time created agglomeration economies and contributed to making Luxembourg one of the few global specialist financial centres. IFCs such as Luxembourg are part of a new environment in which competitive advantage will increasingly be based less on regulatory issues and more on the diversity and quality of the services offered. Secondly, the evolution of the financial industry in Luxembourg suggests that a strategy of continuous innovation has been adopted to maintain the comparative competitiveness of the financial centre. ...|$|E
40|$|Information systems technology, computer-supported {{cooperative}} work practice, {{and organizational}} modeling and planning theories have evolved with only accidental contact to each other. Cooperative information systems {{is a relatively}} young research area which tries to systematically investigate the synergies between these research fields, driven by the observation that change management is the central issue facing all three areas today and that all three fields have indeed developed rather similar strategies to cope with change. In this paper, we therefore propose a framework which views cooperative information systems as composed from three interrelated facets, viz. the system facet, the group collaboration facet, and the organizational facet. We present an overview of these facets, emphasizing <b>strategies</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>developed</b> {{over the past few}} years to accommodate change. We also discuss the propagation of change across the facets, and sketch a basic software architecture intended to su [...] ...|$|E
40|$|The primary {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to investigate how adult patients with ADHD coped with their symptoms prior to diagnosis and treatment, what skills and compensation <b>strategies</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>developed</b> and what their self-perceptions of these strategies were. We used a qualitative approach to analyze interviews with 32 outpatients of a specialty care unit at a university hospital. Patients reported frequent use of diverse compensatory strategies with varying degrees of effectiveness. These were classified into five categories (organizational, motoric, attentional, social, psychopharmacological). In certain circumstances, ADHD symptoms were even perceived as useful. Before diagnosis and treatment, patients with ADHD may develop a variety of skills to cope with their symptoms. Several of these skills are perceived as helpful. Knowledge of self-generated coping strategies may help better understand patients and their histories and thus facilitate patient cooperation. Moreover, knowing ways in which such patients cope with their symptoms may help elucidate reasons for late or under-diagnosing of the disorder...|$|R
40|$|Focusing on the Tarlabaşı {{urban renewal}} project in Istanbul, this paper {{examines}} Turkey’s recent implementation of urban regeneration policies {{for the purpose}} of restructuring urban land markets. Turkey’s current urban regeneration model is premised on demolishing the whole regeneration area, and rebuilding it, together with local governments and the private sector. The implementation of this model has led to the restructuring of property markets in low-income housing areas, through the regularization/legalization of tenure structures, and revalorization of the areas. It is claimed that this model solves economic and socio-spatial problems, and therefore places Istanbul in the so-called global city hierarchy. However, as the Tarlabaşı urban renewal project demonstrates, the Turkish State’s regeneration model led to evictions, increasing the housing problems of the poor, deepening their poverty, and terminating the survival <b>strategies</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>developed</b> over the years through informal economic and social networks. This paper aims to analyse the impacts this model has had, by illuminating socio-spatial aspects of the Tarlabaşı neighbourhood such as labour market dynamics, income levels, and daily life practices...|$|R

[...] Centuries later, the Byzantines recommended this <b>strategy,</b> even though <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>developed</b> siege technology.|$|R
40|$|The {{dramatic}} {{success of}} “reduce the risk” and “back to sleep” campaigns in decreasing infant deaths due to SIDS is well known. However, rates of SIDS {{in many countries}} have reached a plateau, and other causes of sudden unexpected infant death, such as accidental suffocation in unsafe sleeping environments, have increased. As a result, campaigns and educational interventions need to be flexible to address the challenges of changing infant mortality patterns and new research findings. Families that have difficulty adhering to safe sleep and other reduce the risk recommendations require innovative and targeted methods to encourage behavior change. This panel will 1) explore {{the ways in which}} eight countries (Australia, Canada, Germany, Israel, United Kingdom, New Zealand, the Netherlands, and the United States) are addressing cultural and other challenges in the design of their campaigns; and 2) describe the <b>strategies</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>developed</b> to influence those who are hardest to reach and most difficult to engage...|$|E
40|$|Over the years, screen {{readers have}} been an {{essential}} tool for assisting blind users in accessing digital information. Yet, its sequential nature undermines blind people’s ability to efficiently find relevant information, despite the browsing <b>strategies</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>developed.</b> We propose {{taking advantage of the}} Cocktail Party Effect, which states that people are able to focus on a single speech source among several conversations, but still identify relevant content in the background. Therefore, oppositely to one sequential speech channel, we hypothesize that blind people can leverage concurrent speech channels to quickly get the gist of digital information. In this paper, we present an experiment with 23 participants, which aims to understand blind people’s ability to search for relevant content listening to two, three or four concurrent speech channels. Our results suggest that it is easy to identify the relevant source with two and three concurrent talkers. Moreover, both two and three sources may be used to understand the relevant source content depending on the task intelligibility demands and user characteristics...|$|E
40|$|People with Down {{syndrome}} {{are living}} longer lives today thanks to medical science. These people with their families {{are in need of}} assistance from goverments and professionals throughout their lives. It is therefore important to understand how familymembers affected by having a person with Down syndrome in the family. In this paper we focus on the siblings' experience. This study aims to examine four women's experiences of {{what it is like to}} have a sibling with Down syndrome and how the respondents have developed their role and identity as siblings, and what <b>strategies</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>developed</b> for this role. To examine this, a qualitative interviewguide was used. Respondents were recruited via the snowball method and the author's own contacts. As an interpretive framework for this essay, I have chosen to base much of my theory about role-and identity-concepts and the meaning of siblinghood and how gender is linked to the nursing ability and responsibility of an individual. The results show that respondents perceive their sibling relationship as normal with their disabled sibling. However, there has been some special treatment. The results also show that respondents have a very close relationship with their sibling with Down syndrome and that everyone can see a future where they have a caring and responsible role to their siblings...|$|E
40|$|Objectives. The aim of {{this study}} was to develop a greater {{understanding}} of the impact of RA on women’s self-image and self-presentation via an exploration of their clothing choices. Methods. Located within a qualitative symbolic interactionist approach, 15 women with RA (age range 38 – 74 years, disease duration 1 – 47 years) each participated in two interviews. The first explored the impact of RA on their feelings about their bodies and their appearance; the second explored the factors that informed their clothing choices and the way they presented themselves. All interviews were digitally recorded and transcribed verbatim, digital photographs of the women’s clothes and shoes were taken. Data were analysed jointly by both authors using thematic network analysis. Results. Shoes were identified as greatly influencing the women’s clothing choices and how they presented themselves. Three themes were identified that explored the structural and symptomatic impact of RA on the women’s feet, the <b>strategies</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>developed</b> to resolve their footwear needs outside of prescription footwear and the significant impact that footwear had on their clothing choices and self-presentation. Insights from these data highlight the polarity that exists between the clinical, functional attitudes towards shoes and their social status. Conclusion. While aesthetic issues challenge the acceptability of prescription footwear, problems also exist with the functionality and comfort of footwear available on high streets. A more collaborative approach to the design of footwear is required for both prescription and mainstream footwear to meet the needs of women with RA...|$|R
40|$|Postpartum {{women often}} suffer {{clinically}} significant depressive symptoms, a problem addressed by nurse-delivered screening programs. In the past, {{success of these}} identification programs was {{measured in terms of}} screening rates; however, merely evaluating the screening rate does little to inform how to implement depression screening in clinical practice. This article describes the experiences of nurses in implementing depression screening on a maternity unit. We evaluate the practice qualitatively, by asking nurses to describe their screening strategies and their views about implementation, as well as quantitatively by assessing their screening rates and the number of women identified. Utilizing a framework of program evaluation, 20 maternity unit nurses completed qualitative assessments investigating their day-to-day experiences with this practice. To include the perspectives of nurses that declined to participate in qualitative assessments, 14 additional maternity unit nurses completed a brief survey assessing their views. We also assessed screening rates, defined as the number of women screened divided by the number eligible for screening. Maternity unit nurses viewed depression screening positively and were able to screen patients in relatively few steps, which <b>they</b> implemented using <b>strategies</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>developed</b> themselves. Despite nurses 2 ̆ 7 ongoing concern about finding time to screen, they achieved high screening rates and, with one exception, indicated they would opt to continue voluntarily. Depression screening on the maternity unit is feasible and embraced by attending nurses. The clinical strategies used to implement screening are extensively described and provide a basis for implementation in other settings that serve perinatal women...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the course}} of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, {{millions}} of East European Jews made the decision to abandon their places of birth and migrate to larger cities throughout the world. This dissertation examines how mass migration prompted the development of new forms of Jewish communal organization and identification. Focusing on one city in Poland, Bialystok, this dissertation explores the strategies and organizations Jews developed as they tried to cope with the challenges of migrant life. When inhospitable conditions forced Jews to leave Bialystok in their search for better living conditions, they transplanted and reconfigured the institutions and <b>strategies</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>developed</b> in Bialystok to facilitate their adaptation to their new homes. Through a cross cultural analysis of the institutions, philanthropic organizations and writings of Bialystoker Jewish émigrés in the United States, Argentina, and Palestine, the three main places of Bialystoker émigré settlement, this dissertation highlights the shared and distinct forces that shaped East European Jewish migration, adaptation and acculturation {{at the turn of the}} century. ^ As Bialystoker Jewish émigrés settled throughout the world, they still maintained a close relationship with their former home. While both popular folklore and scholarship have portrayed Jewish life, culture and identity as primarily shaped by Jews 2 ̆ 7 diasporic mentality rooted in their dispersal from the biblical land of Israel, this dissertation illustrates how the institutions, philanthropy and writings of the transnational Bialystoker Jewish community belie the standard, static view of the Jewish diaspora. These East European Jews saw themselves as part of a diaspora stemming from Eastern Europe and the created new strategies to remain connected with their former home. This examination highlights how in its contemporary context, and in the perspective of history, the generalized notion a Jewish identity informed by one dispersal rooted only in Zion overlooks many of the complexities which informed the geographies of East European Jewish identity in the age of mass migration. ...|$|R

A subset of SNAREs is specifically recruited to the immediate vicinity of the inclusion membrane, and their accumulation is reduced around inclusions that lack IncA, demonstrating that IncA plays a predominant role in SNARE recruitment. However, interaction with the SNARE machinery is probably not restricted to IncA as at least another inclusion protein shows similarities with SNARE motifs and can interact with SNAREs. We modelled IncA’s association with host SNAREs.

Provides {{a brief overview of}} the issues surrounding poverty and risk in underdeveloped rural areas. Discusses a variety of strategies the rural poor have developed for coping with risk, including settling in safe areas; breeding plants and species that survive in difficult environments; diversifying sources of income; preserving flexibility and keeping options open; accumulating precautionary savings; forming strong and large households; seeking the protection of the rich and powerful; and sharing risk with a large network of friends and relatives. Analyzes the natural limits to the risk coping strategies of the poor, drawing on the theory of repeated games. Examines how wealth accumulation and risk sharing affect the evolution of inequality over time, presenting results derived from various modeling frameworks. Discusses several mechanisms through which poverty and vulnerability hurt growth. Takes stock of what has been learned about the relationship between risk, rural poverty, and economic development, identifying current gaps in knowledge and areas where empirical work is most needed to support or vindicate recent theoretical development.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{investigates the}} impact of various {{vegetation}} types on water balance variability in semi-arid Mediterranean landscapes, and the different <b>strategies</b> <b>they</b> may <b>have</b> <b>developed</b> to succeed in such water-limited environments. The existence of preferential associations between soil water holding capacity and vegetation species is assessed through an extensive soil geo-database focused on a study region in Southern Italy. Water balance constraints that dominate the organization of landscapes are investigated by a conceptual bucket approach. The temporal water balance dynamics are modelled, with vegetation water use efficiency being parameterized {{through the use of}} empirically obtained crop coefficients as surrogates of vegetation behavior in various developmental stages. Sensitivity analyses with respect to the root zone depth and soil water holding capacity are carried out with the aim of explaining the existence of preferential soil-vegetation associations and, hence, the spatial distribution of vegetation types within the study region. Based on these sensitivity analyses the degrees of suitability and adaptability of each vegetation type to parts of the study region are explored with respect of the soil water holding capacity, and the model results were found consistent with the observed affinity patterns...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{explored}} the interactional dynamics of intercultural Genetic Counselling sessions in clinics in Johannesburg. Genetic Counselling {{is a relatively}} young profession and although extensive research {{is available on the}} process there is a paucity of literature on what occurs in the interactions and even less is available on intercultural encounters. The selected methodology for the study was discourse analysis which concentrates on analysing what the discussions do rather than what they are about. The data comprised of 17 video recorded prenatal genetic counselling sessions with women who were at an increased risk of having a baby with a chromosome abnormality due to advanced maternal age. The sessions were conducted in English by six genetic counsellors. The video recordings were transcribed and the transcripts and recordings were analysed based on Principles of Discourse Analysis. It was apparent during the initial phases of the analysis that there was a distinct order to the interactions with six specific phases being identified. Certain phases appeared significant, and as a result openings, decision-making and counselling phases were analysed further. Counsellor dominance in the interactions manifested in the number of <b>strategies</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>developed</b> to guide the women through the counselling session. In their active participation, the counsellors identified the agenda and they controlled it throughout the interaction. During decision making, <b>they</b> used active <b>strategies</b> to assist the women to make a decision regarding having an amniocentesis performed. Even in the counselling segments where the counsellors and the women discussed issues related the women’s life, the initiation and development were controlled by the counsellors. In contrast to the counsellors’ dominance of interactional space, the women shared issues relating to their life world during the counselling segments. This apparent contrast seemed to create tension in the counsellors’ role as <b>they</b> <b>had</b> to either ‘educate’ or ‘counsel’. Tension was further created by the counsellors’ perceived obligations to practise in a particular way. Adhering to firmly embedded principles of the profession seemed to limit the counsellors’ practices and simultaneously prevented the achievement of these principles. The emerging tensions is thought {{to be related to the}} health care setting in which patients, as a result of social and political reason, have not been active participants in their healthcare decisions. The interactions were shaped by the health care system as it influenced the setting of the agenda, the order in the interactions and the counselling techniques used. The emerging phenomena could not be labelled as cultural and it was rather found that culture was inherent to the individuals and the setting in these interactions. The findings have implications for genetic counselling practice in South Africa as existing models of training and practice necessitate adapting to incorporate the insights gained. The contextual influences require consideration and the patients need to be made the focus of the sessions. A culturally sensitive model of genetic counselling as proposed in the study is thought to advance the profession towards true patient-centered Genetic Counselling practices...|$|R
40|$|Abstract only. Fishers from coastal {{communities}} have been facing hazards of different nature. Those stressors plus high fishing pressure {{have contributed to}} resources deterioration, which in turn affects peoples livelihood, creating a vicious circle. In order to understand this vicious circle and to explore how this could be turned around, {{in this paper we}} identified the main socioeconomic and environmental hazards people are confronted with and the coping <b>strategies</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>developed</b> to face them. Based on community perception, we undertook a study in two {{coastal communities}} in Yucatan, Mexico during 2008, using participatory observation and interviews. The study is based on theories of resilience and coping theory. High dependency on fishing makes coastal communities economy extremely vulnerable to fluctuations on fishing resources. Factors that have been affecting their fisheries include: hurricanes, red tides, pollution and illegal fishing. Social problems reported by members of both communities include alcoholism, drugs and political conflicts. A mix of proactive and reactive strategies has been developed by different groups of fishers {{in order to deal with}} uncertain ecological and social environment. Socio-economic conditions, skills, and networking, seem to influence the strategies each group of fishers have been developing to face different types of hazards. We present a conceptual framework to discuss the link between the type of strategies people develop and their adaptive capacity that allows them to respond to increasing stressors that affect their livelihoods...|$|E
40|$|Transitioning into {{adulthood}} {{is an exciting}} and challenging time for emerging adults, and is even more difficult for young adults with emotional and behavioral difficulties (EBD). Even though the number of transition-aged individuals with EBD is significant, few studies have explored the experiences of this population engaged in educational activities, and there is limited information regarding the personal experiences of emerging adults with EBD. The {{purpose of the study}} is to acquire {{a better understanding of the}} experiences of young adults diagnosed with an EBD who are working toward their academic goals. Further, this study may give voice to individuals who have not had the opportunity to share their experiences and beliefs. The researcher employed phenomenological research methods for this study. The purpose of phenomenology is to describe, rather than explain phenomena (Ehrich, 2003). Five participants, aged 18 to 25, and diagnosed with an Axis I disorder in the DSM-IV-TR, were selected using purposeful sampling. The researcher conducted one in-depth interview with the participants, and a brief follow up interview. Data were analyzed using the following seven steps: preliminary grouping, reduction and elimination, clustering the invariant constituents, identification and validation of the invariant constituents and themes by application, construction of an analysis and development of impressions of each participant, and construction of a composite description of the meanings and essences of the experience, representing the group as a whole. Although living with an EBD is a 2 ̆ 2 continuous struggle, 2 ̆ 2 it also provides opportunities for feelings of success and empowerment. Salient aspects of living with an EBD include its effect on the self, impact on relationships, and managing treatment, such as medication and therapy. Participants also discussed how EBD impacts their transition experiences and their ability to achieve their goals; relevant themes included academic challenges, issues regarding seeking assistance, and their selection of career choices. The participants are able to manage these challenges because of the supports they have received and coping <b>strategies</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>developed.</b> Furthermore, their own personality traits, such as determination, belief in themselves, and goal orientation have been integral in their journey towards achieving their academic and career goals...|$|E
40|$|When Samuel Morse {{invented the}} {{telegraph}} in 1843, meteorologists {{were among the}} first to promote the new technology, as it allowed them to communicate weather observations over large distances in real time. Today, meteorologists continue to be at the forefront of technological innovation, using the latest ICTs to collect, analyze and communicate weather information. Agrometeorologists, who specialize in agricultural applications of weather and climate information, are no exception. This issue of ICT Update illustrates a number of ICTs that are playing a crucial role in the agrometeorologists´ efforts to help farmers improve production, mitigate the impacts of natural hazards, and cope with climate variability and change. The first example relates to the main objective of agro-meteorology - to provide weather information to farmers. There are still many farmers in ACP countries who have limited or no access to reliable weather forecasts to help them plan their activities. Reidner Mumbi and Kelly Sponberg report how RANET is using low-cost satellite radio technology and a network of local radio stations to broadcast weather reports to farmers in the remotest areas. In another example of satellite technology, John Stephenson and Jim Williams describe how low-cost satellite reception systems are making real time weather and climate data more accessible to local natural resource managers. Such satellite receiver systems are getting cheaper, but the same cannot be said of the latest meteorological satellite programme of the European Space Agency and EUMETSAT. Anne Taube explains how the programme will benefit national meteorological services throughout Africa. Pest forecasting is another important area of agrometeorology. Under the right environmental conditions, such as rainfall, wind direction and humidity, insect pest populations can explode, with devastating effects. Keith Cressman explains how the FAO´s eLocust system - a palmtop computer, GPS device and HF radio equipment that run on a car battery is being used to monitor and to provide early warning of outbreaks of desert locusts in the Sahel. In the Caribbean, agrometeorology is above all concerned with natural hazard mitigation. Hurricanes and floods can and often do cause extensive damage to fisheries, farms, and island economies in general. Terry Ally explains how the Caribbean Disaster Emergency Response Agency (CDERA) is compiling a catalogue of digital hazard maps that will enable planners to assess flood risks, and small farmers to make sound business decisions. Kees Stigter, one of the world´s leading agrometeorologists, concludes with a cautionary note. He reminds us that ICTs are extremely useful tools, but when it comes to the provision of agrometeorological services to poor farmers, the starting point should always be the technologies and adaptive <b>strategies</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>developed</b> themselves. When Samuel Morse invented the telegraph in 1843, meteorologists {{were among the first}} to promote the new technology, as it allowed them to communicate weather observations over large distances in real time...|$|E

The expectations of middle managers can be complex and contradictory and therefore challenging. This research identifies the challenges middle {{managers of}} human services in the public sector encounter and the <b>strategies</b> that <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>developed</b> to deal with these. The support that senior managers in public sector organisations can offer to their middle managers in this process is also discussed. The study is qualitative and placed in a post-modernist position and social constructive perspective. Data is collected through the use of semi-structured interviews and examined using an interpretative thematic approach. The analysis identified a range of challenges for middle managers in the public sector and strategies these managers use to deal with them. Interestingly a number of identified challenges are also identified as a strategy depending on the support middle managers receive from the senior managers in their organisation. The findings identify that a strong strategic vision needs to be in place in public sector organisations to develop clear roles and responsibilities for middle managers with allocated resources. Middle managers need access to training, supervision and networking to deal with additional challenges such as changes in funding and information management. Recommendations are made to public sector organisations to support the development of effective strategies to deal with the challenges identified by their middle managers. Recommendations are made to middle managers in the public sector to prioritise and advocate for their own needs and requirements as they do for their clients and their staff. This research will support both senior and middle managers in public sector organisations in finding strategies to support middle managers to fulfil their role effectively...|$|R

40|$|It {{is assumed}} that on 16 February 2001, Albanians started {{fighting}} for their rights in Macedonia {{with the use of}} force. On that day armed groups attacked Macedonian police stations in the village of Tanuševci near Tetov. The clashes of various intensity lasted until major amendments to Macedonian constitution were adopted in November 2001. In the first stage of fighting (until May 2001), the Macedonians attempted to disarm the Albanian rebels and destroy the weapons which <b>they</b> <b>had</b> accumulated. This proved difficult because of the support which the latter had in Kosovo and the Prešev Valley, and the guerrilla <b>strategy</b> that <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>developed</b> earlier in Kosovo and now adopted. What is more, the Macedonian military actions were slowed down by Americans with the intention of limiting the number of casualties. In April, EU members and the US managed to establish a wide coalition. The major political parties of the country, both governing and oppositional (Macedonian and Albanian) decided to start negotiations concerning the conditions of the future peace treaty - that is, concessions for Albanians living in Macedonia and awarding them more rights. At the same time, the US and members of the EU states opposed the introduction of martial law in the country {{in order to deal with}} Albanian rebels by force. The leaders of Albanian parties in Macedonia and the main leaders of the Albanian revolution signed the Prizren Agreement, which was to provide a new plain for the future peace negotiations. Boris Trajkovski, the President of Macedonia, largely agreed with US and UE politics, but for the Prime Minister, his environment and most prominent Macedonian intellectuals - with Georgi Efremov, the President of MANU - the only solution was the division of the Macedonian territory and exchange of their minority groups. The representatives of the EU and US opposed such actions and emphasised that preserving the territorial integrity of Macedonia was absolutely crucial...|$|R
40|$|Professor Stigter what in {{your view}} {{have been the most}} {{significant}} contributions that ICTs have made to the study and practice of agrometeorology? In agrometeorology, as in any other environmental science, modern ICTs have contributed to new and better knowledge and applications. Examples can be found in weather, climate and yield forecasting, risk assessments, monitoring and early warning systems. Governments are now {{in a better position to}} warn farmers to enable them to prepare for calamities, and to reduce and mitigate the impacts of natural disasters on agricultural production to the best of their abilities. Better meteorological services are directly serving farmers in developed countries and, to a lesser but increasing extent, better off farmers in developing countries. What are {{in your view}} the most urgent agricultural problems facing farmers in ACP countries? The majority of poor and marginal farmers are confronted with a number of urgent problems. They have to farm under conditions of increasing climate variability and change, and degrading soils. This applies to the users of grasslands and forage crops for livestock in Inner Mongolia, where I am working right now, and to dryland and irrigated farming in central Sudan, where I worked for 15 years. It also applies to small rice farmers in Indonesia as well as to the millet growers in northern Nigeria, where I worked for ten years on intercropping and on agroforestry systems to protect crops from dry winds. Many of these farmers also face markets that are biased against them, and governments that are unwilling or unable to assist. And when they do receive assistance, the measures are often too limited in scope, or are incompatible with their actual needs. They are also usually devised from the top down, addressing the symptoms, rather than tackling actual problems from the bottom up. Do you believe that research in agrometeorology can help to overcome some of these problems? In my view, making agricultural meteorology more operational is not enough to help poor farmers. To provide effective agrometeorological services, we have to combine the adaptive <b>strategies</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>developed</b> themselves using indigenous innovations and experience absorbed from elsewhere, with other sources of knowledge. These sources include contemporary scientific knowledge, as well as the understanding of socio-economic systems necessary to create appropriate policy environments. In the application of scientific knowledge, ICTs are among the most powerful supportive components. But agrometeorological services have to be communicated to farmers in a participatory approach. Can you give some examples of agrometeorological interventions in which ICTs and indigenous knowledge have been combined with some measure of success? I am afraid I have yet to see clear examples. When I was president of the Commission for Agricultural Meteorology (CAgM) of the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) in the 1990 s, we tried to collect examples world-wide, but found few successful cases involving poor or marginal farmers. To a certain extent, this may be due to the lack of documentation, limited access to the ´grey´ literature (such as unpublished theses), language barriers or other constraints. That is why we are now trying again to collect such information. In China, for example, we are currently setting up a project in which we will try to identify examples of successful agrometeorological services. This may teach us about ICT components as well. Given the rapid technological advances in agrometeorology, is there a widening knowledge gap between providers and end users? This knowledge gap is very real and only strong policies towards agrometeorological services can overcome it. I strongly believe that providing such training for the staff of intermediary organizations - including local weather services and extension services - can help to bridge the gap. How have ICTs contributed to your own work? I am an experimental physicist by training, and all physics-related ICTs have always fascinated me. In our African research projects we have made ample use of ICTs in order to better understand traditional technologies and other forms of local knowledge. Yet, I believe that we have to be vigilant that technology never becomes a goal in itself. ICTs can be extremely useful tools and we must make maximum use of them, but when it comes to the provision of agricultural services to poor and marginal producers, indigenous technologies and local innovations must be our starting point because they represent the existing limitations best. mailto:cjstigter@usa. net Kees Stigter is an agrometeorologist, specialised in dryland agrometeorology; agroforestry against desertification, and traditional techniques of microclimate improvement, particularly in Africa and Asia.

40|$|While {{reading skills}} are an {{accepted}} key skill both {{for life and}} study, the capacity to read critically and apply reading concepts to solve problems and develop higher order conceptual understandings requires {{a high level of}} cognitive self-regulation that students do not always have. This chapter describes the development of and research into an environment, Mark-UP, designed to promote the self-monitoring inherent in regulating reading comprehension. The environment consists of a range of tools to assist learners in monitoring their comprehension through annotation, discussion, problem-solving and so on. The tool was applied to a class of undergraduate students in Interface and Information Design at an Australian university. The research involved questionnaires of the whole cohort as well as case studies of a number of student experiences with the environment, using interview and analysis of the students’ portfolios. The study found that, concerning students with weak academic skills, Mark-UP provided some support for their learning, but for stronger students it replicated cognitive <b>strategies</b> that <b>they</b> <b>had</b> already <b>developed.</b> The product was most effective for those students with moderate existing academic skills as it articulated and modeled strategies for reading that they could apply and go beyond to develop their own cognitive regulatory strategies for reading...|$|R
40|$|Anxiety {{has been}} {{increasingly}} {{recognized as a}} serious health concern in older adults and is reported by many caregivers. However, still relatively {{little is known about}} the experience or presentation of anxiety in later life or about how that anxiety relates to caregiving. Much of the research into late-life anxiety has focused on anxiety disorders and has been carried out with reference to younger age groups, using diagnostic and psychometric measures developed, in the main, for younger people. There appear to be few studies in the literature that explore late-life anxiety as an independent phenomenon or that examine the effects of contextual factors on that anxiety. No studies could be found that investigate non-clinical experiences of anxiety in later life, starting from the perspectives of older adults themselves; neither could any studies be found that specifically investigate anxiety-related experiences of elderly people caring for partners with stroke. The present study explores how older adults, caring for partners with stroke, understand and experience anxiety. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with nine older adults, aged from 65 to 80 years, who were living in the community and were caregivers for partners with stroke. Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA) was used to identify themes within their accounts. Three master themes were identified: the phenomenon of anxiety, views that influence anxiety, and the experience of anxiety. Emergent themes describe participants' shared, main sources of anxiety, the signs and symptoms by which they recognized anxiety and the <b>strategies</b> that <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>developed</b> to cope with anxiety. A range of views about self, caregiving and ageing was identified that appeared to shape the anxiety that participants experienced. Findings highlight the chronic nature of the anxiety experienced by older spousal caregivers and suggest ways in which older caregivers can successfully deal with that anxiety. They provide a useful foundation for further research that seeks to determine which older adults are likely to experience anxiety problems in caregiving and also for programmes that seek to support elderly people who are caring for partners with stroke...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. A.) - University of KwaZulu-Natal, 2004. This is a {{case study}} that {{investigated}} the Pitseng Primary School stakeholders' understanding of the purpose and objectives of Free Primary Education (FPE), the <b>strategies</b> that <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>developed</b> and adopted {{for the implementation of}} this programme, the challenges they encountered in their efforts to implement FPE, and how they addressed these challenges. Pitseng Primary School is located in the Leribe district in Lesotho. The study used the questionnaires which were administered to teachers and the governing body of Pitseng Primary School. Group interviews were conducted with 8 teachers and 3 members of the governing body. Individual interviews were conducted with 10 parents and the researcher used observations to collect and verify the data. This study was informed by critical, pragmatic and positivistic approaches to policy implementation. The findings of this study have revealed that the Pitseng Primary School's stakeholders understand the purpose of FPE as a vehicle to make all Basotho children get basic education, provide jobs for the needy Basotho people, eliminate hunger and malnutrition among the Basotho children, and reduce teenage and juvenile crime. The study has also found that there are no formally developed and adopted strategies for FPE implementation at Pisteng Primary. The government determines all the strategies, and the actions that various stakeholders take at the school/community level are an ad hoc response to the pressing demands of FPE implementation. Lack of resources, massive enrolment of pupils, lack of co-operation among stakeholders, and HIV/AIDS are some of the challenges that impede the effective implementation of FPE at Pitseng Primary School. The information that the government relayed to parents lacked insight of the practical implications for FPE implementation at Pitseng Primary and this has created a conflict between various stakeholders at the school regarding the implementation of this programme. To facilitate the school's efforts towards effective implementation of FPE and resource mobilisation, the study recommended that the stakeholders at Pitseng Primary School should hold regular meetings wherein they clarify the role and responsibilities that all parties have to play for the implementation of FPE. The government of Lesotho should give the school autonomy to develop appropriate strategies for the implementation of this programme...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{set out to}} {{undertake}} a curriculum review. Scale {{was chosen as the}} focus of the review because the Mathematics and Science Taskforce (1997) indicated that measurement was an area of the curriculum that needed priority attention, however comparatively little had been done to provide this by 2005. Scales are a common mathematical object. A search of many (Western) homes is likely to find a variety of scales being used for different purposes. They can be found on car dashboards, kitchen stoves, tape measures, and clocks. They will be found in graphs, newspapers, and magazines. Scales also underpin important mathematical learning over and above their everyday application to measurement and graphing. For example, concepts like gradient, rate of change, functions, and limits all rely on an understanding of scale. But how much do we know about how students learn to use scales? What does learning about scale involve? The thesis approaches the review through an exploration of student understanding of scale in the context of mathematics. It focuses on answering the question "what understanding of scales do students in Year 7 and 8 at the case study schools have?" A definition of scale is developed and is based on the mathematics to which the curriculum document indicates Year 7 and 8 students should have been exposed. This could be identified as the notion of a linear scale. Students in Years 7 and 8 were chosen because by that age the mathematics curriculum document implies students should have a good understanding of scale; at the same time, their errors and misconceptions are likely to indicate learning barriers that need to be addressed. The literature and the New Zealand mathematics curriculum were used to define a construct of scale appropriate to explore with Year 7 and 8 students. Two tests were then developed to measure understanding of that construct. Where possible, items were initially developed or adapted from the literature then, when early findings suggested new avenues for exploration, new items were developed to investigate further issues of understanding. Both tests were used at different schools in the format of a cognitive interview; Test 1 was also used at another school as a written test. Additional items were developed to use with groups of teachers in an attempt to challenge early findings; these teacher trials used a third assessment format requiring both a written answer and a written explanation of method. In Test 1 students were assessed with pairs of items. In each pair one item used a decontextualised number line, the other a measurement or graphing context promoted by the curriculum. During the cognitive interviews, the verbal responses of students were recorded on audiotape, while field notes were used to capture non-verbal data. Follow-up probe questions were used to clarify solution strategies and the understanding underlying these strategies. The written test was then used to identify if the interpretations made could be transferred. Test 2 repeated the data collection methodology from Test 1 but used a different structure within the test. In total, 45 cognitive interviews and 81 written tests were undertaken with students, while 32 teachers participated in the teacher trials. Facilities, point bi-serial correlation coefficients, and levels of significance were used to ascertain the fitness for purpose of the developed test items. Data collected during the cognitive interviews were also analysed using both qualitative and quantitative methods to ascertain patterns of response. The mathematics curriculum in New Zealand had assumed that students would develop understanding about scale from exposure to scales in measurement and graphing situations. This approach might have been appropriate if a scale was a simple (or single) object to be mastered but it is not. A scale is a mathematical tool of vast flexibility that can be applied in numerous forms {{to a wide range of}} situations. The results suggest that teaching of scale needs to be more deliberate, and also needs to be considered when curricula are designed. A high proportion of the students in the study <b>had</b> not <b>developed</b> the expected understanding of scale by Years 7 and 8. A complex series of factors were identified that impacted on how the students worked with scale. These included: their understanding of number and number symbols; their understanding of the measurement conventions that are foundational to scale; the <b>strategies</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>developed</b> to partition unmarked intervals; their strategies to decide on the value of a partition in marked intervals; their understanding of the role of the marks and spaces on the scale; and their ability to iterate a unit. These different bodies of understanding needed to be integrated and used in a coordinated manner for the students to become effective users of scale...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Frisklivssentrals in Norway is a {{community}} based health programmes intended as a preventive measure. Aim for frisklivssentral is helping vulnerable audiences with lifestyle changes. Basic offers the centres have is in physical activity, diet change and tobacco secession. In addition, the centres have offers mental health, sleep and alcohol habits. Work on healthy living centres are ruled by a guideline (Norwegian Directorate of Health, 2013 a). The work carried out at centres {{are affected by the}} supervisor's interpretation of the guidelines. The purpose of this task is to understand the influence of supervisors in the delivery of physical activity programmes in frisklivssentralen. The purpose of physical activity in frisklivssentrals is to make users able to engage in physical activity on their own after the prescription period. It also says in the guide that healthy lifestyle coaches will motivate users through autonomy, competence and relatedness. It is therefore used self-determination theory (Deci & Ryan, 2002) to discuss the findings and see how supervisors are doing this. The study is based on interviews with 7 mentors from 6 different frisklivssentrals in eastern Norway. To analyse the interviews a grounded theory approach is used. The findings of the analysis are presented through 5 core categories. Core categories presented in this study is the supervisor's prerequisites, user prerequisites, aim, strategy and approach and structural framework conditions. The supervisor's prerequisites, their habitus, affecting the remaining categories and shows together how the supervisor affect the services provided. Through goal they set for business and target users, through the framework factors <b>they</b> <b>have,</b> through approach and <b>strategies</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> towards users <b>develop</b> the offer {{in such a way that}} they can greatly motivate users through perceived autonomy support...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} a study {{exploring}} variation and change in language proficiency amongst international undergraduate students who had been identified as requiring English language support. Specifically, it investigates changes in IELTS scores and in students' perceptions of language proficiency in their first semester of study. The study employed a Concurrent Mixed Methods design in which quantitative and {{qualitative data were collected}} simultaneously and analysed separately before comparing results. Quantitative data was collected using an IELTS Academic test {{at the beginning and end}} of one semester, while qualitative data comprised two rounds of focus group interviews conducted in the same semester. 51 participants undertook both IELTS tests. The initial round of focus groups was attended by 10 participants and the final round by 15. This study found that the main improvement in proficiency as measured by IELTS was in Speaking. All four subscores of the Speaking test showed statistically significant gains: Fluency and Coherence and Pronunciation showed gains of almost half an IELTS band score and these were found to be highly statistically significant. There was little shift in Writing scores except in the subscore of Lexical Resource and only marginal mean score gains in Listening and Reading. The study distinguished between low-scorers, mid-scorers and high-scorers. The low-scorers obtained significantly higher scores after one semester of study, perhaps reflecting the more rapid progress often made at lower levels of language proficiency, while the mean improvement amongst mid-scorers and high-scorers was not found to be statistically significant. In investigating the relationship between IELTS scores and GPA, Listening and Reading were found to be strongly correlated with GPA in the first semester of study, while Speaking and Writing were not. Further investigation of correlation between their IELTS scores and GPAs found that this strong correlation between GPA and Listening and Reading was maintained in their second semester of study but was no longer maintained in their third semester. This finding points to a relationship between language proficiency test scores and academic achievement for students in their initial year of study, but primarily with the receptive macro-skills, which may have implications for setting entry requirements if borne out by larger studies. Focus group data suggested that students did not have unrealistic expectations of academic study, even if their perceptions of their English proficiency did not always match levels of proficiency as measured by IELTS. Students were able to articulate a range of <b>strategies</b> that <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>developed</b> to raise proficiency while studying at university, as well as a range of obstacles that hindered language development. A key finding in comparing the focus group data with the IELTS scores was that proficiency is a complex and contested notion.

40|$|The tobacco {{industry}} is a potent force in Albany. Since 1983 (not including 1988 - 89, were data are not available) tobacco interests spent $ 1. 3 million on campaign contributions to candidates and political party committees. Of this, $ 277, 905 went to legislative candidates, $ 38, 650 went to candidates for constitutional office, and the remaining $ 1 million went to party committees. The members of the 1997 - 98 legislature who collected the most money from campaign contributions were Assemblymember Jeffrey Klein(D-Bronx) ($ 16, 275), Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver (D-Manhattan) ($ 10, 425), Assemblymember Michael Bragman (D-Onondaga) ($ 8, 420), Senator Ronald Stafford (R-Plattsburgh) ($ 7, 500), and Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno (R-Brunswick) ($ 7, 300). The {{tobacco industry}} spent $ 5. 9 million on lobbying expenditures between 1992 and 1998. Of the $ 998, 884 contributed to party committees between 1983 and 1998 (not including 1988 - 89), $ 815, 840 (81. 7 %) was donated after 1994, when contributors realized that contributions to party committees were unlimited. As in other states, the tobacco industry donates more to Republicans than Democrats; Republican party committees received $ 752, 709 (75 %) of the money between 1983 - 98, while Democrats received $ 191, 175 (19 %). The information we have on tobacco industry political activity is incomplete and underestimates the magnitude of tobacco industry activity. Between 1998 and 1999, the tobacco industry {{was found to have}} under-reported its lobbying expenses on several occasions. In 1998, the Tobacco Institute admitted to under-reporting by $ 443, 572 and in 1999, Philip Morris admitted to under-reporting lobbying expenses 15 times over the period 1993 - 96. These developments indicated that the lobbying law was ineffective at providing accurate information for public disclosure, and prompted a revision of the law in 1999. However, the revision is insufficient to prevent this kind of influence to be accumulated by an industry such as the tobacco industry. These contributions are having an effect on policy making. On the average, for each $ 1000 contributed to an individual legislator, that legislator scored 1. 82 points more pro-tobacco on a 0 to 10 scale. At the same time, legislators who support the tobacco industry are rewarded; for each 1 point more pro-tobacco, contributions increase by an average of $ 380. Republican legislators were more pro-tobacco than Democrats by an average of 1. 39 points. As in most states, in New York State, progress in tobacco control begins at the local level. New legislation is generally passed first on Long Island, which inspires New York City to do the same. Legislation passed in New York City sparks progress in the upstate area, and until the Pataki Administration, at the state level. The importance of localities passing restrictions to initiate the momentum to pass state legislation is why preemptive state legislation is a major threat to tobacco control in New York State. The documents released through state litigation of the tobacco industry have {{played a critical role in}} the passage of tobacco control legislation in the face of an unsympathetic legislature and Governor. Advocates in other states should recognize that researching the documents can help them pressure political leaders and recognize industry front groups. The Long Island counties of Suffolk and Nassau lead the tobacco control movement in the downstate area, whereas Erie County sets the standard upstate. The ASSIST program has been successful in setting up local coalitions and galvanizing against industry tactics. The industry organizes and finances "grassroots" coalitions, and "smokers' rights" groups such as the National Smokers Alliance, mobilizes its Tobacco Action Network, forms alliances with other organizations affected by anti-tobacco bills and finances groups such as the United Restaurant, Hotel, and Tavern Association to oppose clean indoor air legislation. It promotes "studies" claiming that tobacco control legislation will hurt the hospitality business, even though objective studies have consistently shown no effect or a positive effect on the hospitality industry. At the state level the industry has sought to preempt local tobacco control activity; at the local level, the industry tries to pass weak laws promoting "accommodation" to prevent the passage of effective tobacco control policies. New York tobacco control advocates have vigorously – and generally successfully – opposed these efforts. Since 1986, New York City has distinguished itself as a national leader in tobacco control legislation. While its clean indoor air laws have not been the strongest in the country, they are remarkable in light of the city's size and the fact that Philip Morris' corporate headquarters are located in New York City. The city was also one of the first localities to sue the tobacco industry. Both Nassau County and Niagara County Boards of Health enacted regulations (in 1994 and 1998, respectively) to eliminate smoking in restaurants. However, both were overturned in lawsuits sponsored by the tobacco industry. Both rulings determined that the Boards of Health were in violation of the state constitution because they considered economics in their decisions. These decisions have discouraged counties from using Boards of Health to pass clean indoor air regulations. When Republican George Pataki succeeded Democrat Mario Cuomo as governor in 1994, state tobacco control legislation abruptly ceased. Pataki ignored the Health Department's tobacco advisory panel, the Commission for a Healthy New York, and only formulated tobacco control programs when he feared criticism from the media. Between 1990 and 1998 Pataki accepted $ 8050 from the tobacco industry. In November 1998, forty-six states agreed to a $ 206 billion dollar settlement with the tobacco industry. The agreement settled the states' claims for smoking-related Medicaid costs. New York State received $ 25 billion to be paid over 25 years as a result of the settlement agreement. In December 1999, health advocates, working the other interests, were able to increase the tobacco tax by 55 cents and dedicate part of the tobacco settlement funds to fund health care in New York State. New York's cigarette tax of $ 1. 11 per pack is the highest in the nation. Of the approximately $ 1. 5 billion generated annually by the settlement and additional tobacco tax, only $ 37 million annually is dedicated to the state tobacco control program. During the 1999 legislative session, the New York Medical Society supported the Civil Justice Reform Act which would provide the tobacco industry protection against product liability litigation. The tobacco industry has probably used every <b>strategy</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>developed</b> in fighting tobacco control policies in New York State. Despite these daunting challenges, advocates have achieved many notable successes and recognized and avoided counterproductive compromises. <b>They</b> <b>have</b> done so by exposing tobacco industry front groups and affiliations and holding politicians and organizations accountable for their actions...|$|R
40|$|Master of Public HealthPublic Health Interdepartmental ProgramKatie M. HeinrichMy {{public health}} field {{experience}} {{was conducted in}} McCook, Nebraska at a corporate wellness company called the “Wellness Partners. ” They are hired by other companies (which I will often refer to as employer groups or clients) to help them offer wellness incentives to their employees. Of the services I will list in a moment, a company can chose which ones {{they would like to}} purchase and offer their staff members. The majority of our clients opt for the entire package and offer their employees discounts on insurance for participating in the program. (I will often refer to the employees who chose to enroll in the program as “participants. ”) Wellness Partners is quite small, employing approximately 40 people. The owners started out in the insurance industry and by way of intuition saw the opportunity for their clients to lower health costs by improving employee health. In order to meet this need, they started up the Wellness Partners as a separate business. The company has been in operation for ten years. The <b>strategies</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> already <b>developed</b> are quite successful and the company finds itself in high demand and needing to establish a growth plan {{that will allow them to}} take on larger employer groups. When I first talked with the owner, I was impressed to find that someone with no public health background was able to construct such successful strategies for intervention-based wellness. From my educational research on the topic, I could tell that this company was using some of the most successful strategies the industry has to offer. 	The Wellness Partners offers a long list of services including health fairs, flu shot clinics, a comprehensive health risk assessment and accompanying lab tests, monthly publications and wellness challenges, and data management. One unique service that they are able to offer because of their size is individualized counseling. Every employee that chooses to participate in the wellness program has access to one-on-one calls with a registered nurse, dietician, exercise physiologist, and employee advocate. A need for extra intervention for high risk employees led to the creation of the Health Boost program. 	A large portion of my practicum focused on the Health Boost program. Health Boost is an additional program that is offered as a part of the full package to employer groups. It was developed in order to give extra support to those employees who are “high risk” or have the largest probability of costing their employer extra money in health care costs. An employee must fulfill one of the following criteria to enroll: •	Diagnosed Diabetic (Fasting blood glucose (FBG) > 125), •	Pre-Diabetic AND Obese (FBG> 110 - 125 AND BMI> 30), or •	Hypertensive: Blood Pressure 160 / 100 mm Hg or higher. Anyone meeting these criteria can be invited to join Health Boost which provides them with quarterly A 1 C kits (diabetics only), nurse consultations and unlimited access to the Health Boost team. The Health Boost team consists of a dietician, exercise physiologist, and mental health counselor who all collaborate for highly individualized wellness plans for the participants. Currently, the primary focus of the program is disease management. Weight management is a large contributor to disease management; however, has not been emphasized as an actual goal of the program. The company is looking to expand the program in two ways. First, they want to open up the program to anyone who is morbidly obese (BMI> 40) regardless of comorbidities. Second, they would like to add a weight management program to the existing strategies in Health Boost that would be offered to all Health Boost participants old and new. This new program is to be delivered primarily through print materials and should increase the reach and efficiency of the Health Boost program...|$|R
