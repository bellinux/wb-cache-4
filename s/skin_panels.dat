5|$|The {{leading edge}} of the wing has a {{honeycomb}} structure panel construction, providing strength with minimal weight; similar panels cover the flap shrouds, elevators, rudders and sections of the fins. The <b>skin</b> <b>panels</b> are integral with the stringers and are fabricated using computer-controlled machining, reducing production time and cost. Combat experience has shown that this type of panel is more resistant to damage. The skin is not load-bearing, so damaged skin sections can be easily replaced in the field, with makeshift materials if necessary. The ailerons are at the far ends of the wings for greater rolling moment and have two distinguishing features: The ailerons are larger than is typical, almost 50 percent of the wingspan, providing improved control even at slow speeds; the aileron is also split, making it a deceleron.|$|E
25|$|Vickers {{set up a}} {{partnership}} with the French aircraft manufacturer, Société des Avions Michel Wibault to exploit the patented system of all-metal construction developed by Michel Wibault. This used corrugated light alloy <b>skin</b> <b>panels,</b> and made for easy maintenance and inspection. As part of this partnership, Vickers placed an order with Wibault for a single Wibault 7, re-engined with a Bristol Jupiter VI radial engine, to act as a prototype for potential licensed production. The Wibault 7, and therefore the Vickers licensed copy, were single-engine high-wing parasol monoplanes.|$|E

The new design required the use of new production techniques, such as stamping and forging of large high-strength parts, extrusion of long sections, chemical milling of large <b>skin</b> <b>panels</b> and other new techniques.|$|E
2500|$|The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) {{investigated}} the crash {{and determined that}} the accident {{was caused by a}} structural failure that occurred at the wing-to-fuselage attach point, with the right wing failing just before the left one. The investigation disclosed [...] "evidence of fatigue cracks in the right wing's lower surface <b>skin</b> <b>panel,</b> with origins beneath the forward doubler....

25|$|The {{basic design}} of the Typhoon was a {{combination}} of traditional Hawker construction (such as used in the earlier Hawker Hurricane) and more modern construction techniques; the front fuselage structure, from the engine mountings {{to the rear of the}} cockpit, was made up of bolted and welded duralumin or steel tubes covered with <b>skin</b> <b>panels,</b> while the rear fuselage was a flush-riveted, semi-monocoque structure. The forward fuselage and cockpit skinning was made up of large, removable duralumin panels, allowing easy external access to the engine and engine accessories and most of the important hydraulic and electrical equipment.|$|E
25|$|The Vickers-Wibault {{construction}} {{method was}} based on the patents of Michel Wibault, who began working with Vickers in 1922. It was a way of producing an all-metal aircraft with an airframe built up from simple, non-machined metal shapes, covered with very thin e.g. 0.016 in (0.4mm) corrugated light alloy sheets. <b>Skin</b> <b>panels</b> were riveted {{to each other and to}} the underlying structure; the skin on the wings was not stressed. Vickers' first experience of the method was with the licence built Wibault Scout. The first Vickers design using this construction was the Vireo and the third, the Viastra, used a blend of Wibault and Vickers construction techniques.|$|E
25|$|The Su-57 will be {{the first}} {{operational}} aircraft in Russian Air Force service to use stealth technology. Similar to other stealth fighters such as the F-22, the airframe incorporates planform edge alignment to reduce its radar cross-section (RCS); the leading and trailing edges of the wings and control surfaces and the serrated edges of <b>skin</b> <b>panels</b> are carefully aligned at several specific angles {{in order to reduce the}} number of directions the radar waves can be reflected. Weapons are carried internally in weapons bays within the airframe, and antennas are recessed from the surface of the skin to preserve the aircraft's stealthy shape. The IRST housing is turned backwards when not in use, and its rear is treated with radar-absorbent material (RAM) to reduce its radar return. To mask the significant RCS contribution of the engine face, the partial serpentine inlet obscures most, but not all, of the engine's fan and inlet guide-vanes (IGV). The production aircraft incorporates radar blockers similar in principle to those used on the F/A-18E/F in front of the engine fan to hide it from all angles. The aircraft uses RAM to absorb radar emissions and reduce their reflection back to the source, and the canopy is treated with a coating to minimize the radar return of the cockpit and pilot.|$|E
50|$|Although foam-core panels gained {{attention}} in the 1970s, {{the idea of using}} stress <b>skinned</b> <b>panels</b> for construction began in the 1930s. Research and testing of the technology was done primarily by Forest Products Laboratory (FPL) in Madison, Wisconsin as part of a U.S. Forest Service attempt to conserve forest resources. In 1937, a small stressed-skin house was constructed and garnered enough attention to bring in First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt to dedicate the house. In a testament to the durability of such panel structures, it has endured the severe Wisconsin climate and was used by University of Wisconsin-Madison as a day care center up until 1998 when it was removed {{to make way for a}} new Pharmacy School building. With the success of the stress <b>skinned</b> <b>panels,</b> it was suggested stronger skins could take all of the structural load and eliminate the frame altogether.|$|R

40|$|Preflight {{thermal stress}} {{analysis}} {{of the space shuttle}} orbiter wing <b>skin</b> <b>panel</b> and the thermal protection system (TPS) was performed. The heated <b>skin</b> <b>panel</b> analyzed was rectangular in shape and contained a small square cool region at its center. The wing skin immediately outside the cool region was found to be close to the state of elastic instability in the chordwise direction based on the conservative temperature distribution. The wing skin was found to be quite stable in the spanwise direction. The potential wing skin thermal instability was not severe enough to tear apart the strain isolation pad (SIP) layer. Also, the preflight thermal stress analysis was performed on the TPS tile under the most severe temperature gradient during the simulated reentry heating. The tensile thermal stress induced in the TPS tile was found to be much lower than the tensile strength of the TPS material. The thermal bending of the TPS tile was not severe enough to cause tearing of the SIP layer...|$|R

2500|$|Adjoining the SRB attach {{fittings}} {{is a major}} ring frame. [...] The loads {{are transferred}} from the fittings to the major ring frame which then distributes the tangential loads to the intertank skin. [...] Two panels of the intertank skin, called the thrust panels, distribute the concentrated axial SRB thrust loads to the LOX and LH2 [...] tanks and to adjacent intertank <b>skin</b> <b>panels.</b> [...] These adjacent panels {{are made up of}} six stringer-stiffened panels.|$|E
2500|$|Another problem {{discovered}} by the jet fighters was unexpectedly dropping a wing at high speeds and high altitudes. This was traced to manufacturing defects in the wings that made no difference at low speeds and altitudes, but meant that each wing had a slightly different airfoil and hence, a different amount of lift. To counter this Sergey Ilyushin and his team developed a new manufacturing technique that reversed the traditional practice where the internal supporting members were affixed to the assembly jig and the aircraft's <b>skin</b> <b>panels</b> were then attached. This new method meant that the <b>skin</b> <b>panels</b> {{were placed in the}} jigs where the correct curvature and shape could be guaranteed and the internal structure was then fastened to them. This required that manufacturing joints be used along the chord lines of the wings and tail surfaces, which split the spars and ribs in half. [...] Similarly, the fuselage was built the same way, although it was split vertically along the centerline. This new technique did impose a small weight penalty, but had the unexpected advantage of greatly accelerating the assembly process as the internal equipment could be installed before the halves were joined together. This allowed several teams to work on a single sub-assembly before they were mated.|$|E
40|$|This is {{the second}} part {{on the design of}} a high aspect ratio HALE-UAV wing using {{composite}} materials. The first paper deals only with the static strength analysis. This paper is a continuation of the first paper and presents buckling and flutters analysis. The wing was made of a carbon/epoxy laminate with orthotropic arrangement, [0 °/ 0 °/ 45 °/- 45 °]ѕ. Buckling phenomenon was evaluated only at the upper wing box <b>skin</b> <b>panel</b> and used linear analytical equation to determine the critical buckling load in each <b>skin</b> <b>panel.</b> The results showed that the upper wing skin was not safe from buckling and it needs structural thickness improvement.

It was found that the designed wing structure has high flutter speed and it was safe from flutter phenomenon...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{accuracy}} of sound transmission loss (TL) predictions of aircraft double-walls using {{transfer matrix method}} (TMM) and statistical energy analysis (SEA) is examined in this paper. The studied system is composed of: (1) a laminate composite <b>skin</b> <b>panel</b> whose critical frequency is around 4000 Hz, (2) an air gap partially filled with a fibrous layer and (3) a sandwich trim panel with critical frequency around 2500 Hz. The structure is submitted to a diffuse acoustic field in the frequency range from 100 Hz to 10 kHz. A transfer path analysis shows that for this structure, including a highly-radiating trim with a low critical frequency, the resonant transmission through the cavity between panels is dominant over a large frequency range. This transmission path is not accounted for in the TMM formulation, resulting in an overestimation of the transmission loss compared to measurements and SEA computation. On the other hand, for practical purposes, both approaches are able to predict the impact in the TL of modifying {{the parameters of the}} <b>skin</b> <b>panel</b> for frequencies below its critical frequency...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: An {{approach}} {{based on}} a displacement compatibility model is presented for both riveted and bonded stiffened composite panels containing impact damage. This repre-sents the first application of the displacement compatibility model to the failure analysis of impacted stiffened composite panels, and some new results are obtained for the impact dam-age tolerance properties of stiffened composite panels. In the present analysis, the previous displacement compatibility model for a stringer/orthotropic <b>skin</b> <b>panel</b> is improved for a stringer/unbalanced <b>skin</b> <b>panel.</b> The impact damage is simplified as an elliptic hole based on the compressive failure mechanisms of impacted composite laminates and stiffened panels. Predictions for failure loads and damage arrest capability agree well with experimental re-sults for several composite panel configurations. The important results obtained in this study are: (1) damage arrest capability {{is dominated by the}} strength of the skin/stringer attachment; (2) distinct two-stage failure shows that the riveted panels have significant damage arrest ca-pability due to the high shear strength of the rivets; and (3) since the very low shear strength of the skin/stringer attachment, the co-cured panels have no damage arrest capability.

40|$|The {{invention}} disclosed here is {{a method}} for forming and curing an intricate structure of criss-crossing composite stringers and frames that are bonded to a <b>skin</b> <b>panel.</b> A structure constructed {{in accordance with the}} invention would be well-suited for use as a portion of an aircraft fuselage, a boat hull, or the like. The method is preferably practiced by applying uncured composite stringers to an uncured composite sheet panel. This is followed by placing cured frames crosswise over the stringers. The frames have openings at the locations where they intersect with the stringers which enables the frames to come into direct contact with the skin along most of their length. During the forming and curing process, the stringers are covered with a plurality of cauls, and the entire assembly of <b>skin</b> <b>panel,</b> stringers, frames and cauls is subjected to a vacuum bagging and curing process. The cauls serve to maintain both part shape and to control the flow of resin within the stringers as they are cured.
