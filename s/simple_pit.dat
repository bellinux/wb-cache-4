5|$|With the 2005 {{discovery}} of a new chamber and the 2008 {{discovery of}} two further tomb entrances, the valley is known to contain 63 tombs and chambers (ranging in size from KV54, a <b>simple</b> <b>pit,</b> to KV5, a complex tomb with over 120 chambers). It was the principal burial place of the major royal figures of the Egyptian New Kingdom, {{as well as a}} number of privileged nobles. The royal tombs are decorated with scenes from Egyptian mythology and give clues as to the beliefs and funerary rituals of the period. Almost all of the tombs seem to have been opened and robbed in antiquity, but they still give an idea of the opulence and power of the Pharaohs.|$|E
25|$|A {{ventilation}} improved pit (VIP) latrine adds certain {{design features}} to the <b>simple</b> <b>pit</b> latrine which reduces flies from exiting the latrine, {{thereby reducing the}} spread of diseases.|$|E
25|$|A <b>simple</b> <b>pit</b> latrine uses {{no water}} seal and {{collects}} human excreta in a pit or trench. This type of toilet {{can range from}} a simple slit trench to more elaborate systems with seating or squatting pans and ventilation systems. In developed countries they are associated with camping and wilderness areas, whereas they are common in rural or peri-urban areas {{of much of the}} developing world. Pit latrines are used in emergency situations.|$|E
50|$|The cremated bones {{could be}} placed in <b>simple</b> <b>pits.</b> Sometimes the dense {{concentration}} of the bones indicates a container of organic material, sometimes the bones were simply shattered.|$|R
50|$|Graves were <b>simple</b> <b>pits,</b> with bodies {{pointing}} to Mecca. Some {{of the unique}} structures were the gubbas, graves reserved for Muslim saints. They were whitewashed domes made of adobe bricks.|$|R
50|$|A {{mud tank}} is an open-top container, {{typically}} made of square steel tube and steel plate, to store drilling fluid on a drilling rig. They are also called mud pits, {{as they were}} once <b>simple</b> <b>pits</b> in the earth.|$|R
25|$|The {{ventilated}} improved {{pit latrine}} (VIP) is a pit latrine {{with a black}} pipe (vent pipe) fitted to the pit and a screen (flyscreen) at the top outlet of the pipe. VIP latrines are an improvement to overcome the disadvantages of <b>simple</b> <b>pit</b> latrines, e.g. fly and mosquito nuisance and unpleasant odors. The smell is carried upwards by the chimney effect and flies are prevented from leaving the pit and spreading disease.|$|E

2500|$|Sanitation {{technologies}} {{may involve}} centralized civil engineering structures like sewer systems, sewage treatment, surface runoff treatment and solid waste landfills. These structures {{are designed to}} treat wastewater and municipal solid waste. Sanitation technologies may also {{take the form of}} relatively simple onsite sanitation systems. This can in some cases consist of a <b>simple</b> <b>pit</b> latrine or other type of non-flush toilet for the excreta management part.|$|E
50|$|The {{wood of the}} Anacardiaceae has the {{frequent}} occurrence of simple small holes in the vessels, occasionally in some species {{side by side with}} scalariform holes (in Campnosperma, Micronychia, and Heeria argentea (Anaphrenium argenteum).

50|$|The protodynastic tombs were oval, 1.0 - 1.5m {{long and}} 1.5 - 2.0m deep. They {{contained}} <b>simple</b> <b>pits,</b> {{in which the}} deceased was laid down in a fetal pose, his head facing toward the west. Beside and around the deceased, several bowls and vases were placed; {{in some of the}} tombs, precious artifacts made of ivory and stone were found.|$|R
5000|$|Excavated tombs {{suggest the}} {{presence}} of elite members of society. Some of these elite members were buried in temple platforms with numerous ceramic offerings, spondyllus shell and jade ear ornaments. Skull deformations are seen in certain burials, which {{is a sign of}} elite membership. [...] Some tombs were made of adobe blocks with stone or wood beams for roofing; other burials were <b>simple</b> <b>pits.</b>|$|R
2500|$|In {{developing}} countries the construction cost for a <b>simple</b> <b>pit</b> toilet is between about [...] This cost figure {{has a wide}} range because the costs vary a lot {{depending on the type}} of soil, the depth and reinforcement of the pit, the superstructure that the user is willing to pay for, the type of toilet squatting pan or toilet seat chosen, the cost of labour, construction materials (in particular the cost of cement can differ a lot from one country to the next), the ventilation system and so forth.|$|E
2500|$|In a pourflush pit latrine, a {{squatting}} toilet with a {{water seal}} (U-trap or siphon) is used over {{one or two}} offset pits instead of a plain hole or seat. Therefore, these types of toilets do require water for flushing but otherwise have {{many of the same}} characteristics as <b>simple</b> <b>pit</b> latrines and are for this reason subsumed under the term [...] "pit latrine". The fecal sludge that is removed from the full pits of twin-pit pour-pour flush pit latrines is somewhat safer to handle and reuse than the fecal sludge from single pit pour-flush latrines, although significant health risks remain in either case and are a cause for concern.|$|E
2500|$|The facial pit {{underwent}} {{parallel evolution}} in pitvipers and some boas and pythons. It evolved once in pitvipers and multiple times in boas and pythons. The electrophysiology {{of the structure}} is similar between the two lineages, but they differ in gross structural anatomy. Most superficially, pitvipers possess one large pit organ {{on either side of}} the head, between the eye and the nostril (loreal pits), while boas and pythons have three or more comparatively smaller pits lining the upper and sometimes the lower lip, in or between the scales (labial pits). Those of the pitvipers are the more advanced, having a suspended sensory membrane as opposed to a <b>simple</b> <b>pit</b> structure.|$|E
50|$|The astronomical {{readings}} of the holes are largely {{a product of the}} interpretation of them as being <b>simple</b> <b>pits</b> without any structural features. This approach has required finding an explanation which tends towards the theory that the holes were repeatedly dug, filled and redug and excludes possibilities relating to any possible timber posts standing in them. The theory that they may have been used to hold temporary markers for use in astronomical observations gained credence in the 1960s.|$|R
50|$|In 1931-32 E.F. Schmidt {{recorded}} {{about eight}} hundred burials, of which only {{some have been}} fully described and published: 33 for the period Hissar I, 24 for Hissar II and 38 for Hissar III. Most of the graves are represented by individual burial in <b>simple</b> <b>pits,</b> with the skeleton laying on its side, in a flexed position and the skull oriented towards east and north-east. Some collective graves are attested and four rich graves of the Hissar IIIC period were found in 1931.|$|R
50|$|The largest collection, {{displaying}} items excavated at Agia Fotia cemetery near Sitia {{is housed}} in the first room. Sitia {{was one of the}} largest prehistoric cemeteries in Greece and many graves ranged from <b>simple</b> <b>pits</b> for child burials to extravagant early chamber tombs. The room also contains many notable vases and several hundred bronze blades of differing shapes and level of sharpness also found in the graves of Agia Fotia. Fish hooks dating back to early Minoan Crete are also exhibited.|$|R
2500|$|The female common ostrich lays her fertilised eggs in {{a single}} {{communal}} nest, a <b>simple</b> <b>pit,</b> [...] deep and [...] wide, scraped in the ground by the male. The dominant female lays her eggs first, {{and when it is}} time to cover them for incubation she discards extra eggs from the weaker females, leaving about 20 in most cases. A female common ostrich can distinguish her own eggs from the others in a communal nest. Ostrich eggs are the largest of all eggs, though they are actually the smallest eggs relative {{to the size of the}} adult bird — on average they are [...] long, [...] wide, and weigh , over 20 times the weight of a chicken's egg and only 1 to 4% the size of the female. They are glossy cream-coloured, with thick shells marked by small pits.|$|E
2500|$|As of 2013 pit latrines {{are used}} by an {{estimated}} 1.77 billion people. This is mostly {{in the developing world}} as well as in rural and wilderness areas. In 2011 about 2.5 billion people did not have access to a proper toilet and one billion resort to open defecation in their surroundings. Southern Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa have the poorest access to toilets. In developing countries the cost of a <b>simple</b> <b>pit</b> toilet is typically between 25 and 60 USD. Ongoing maintenance costs are between 1.5 and 4 USD per person per year which are often not taken into consideration. In some states of India the [...] "No Toilet, No Bride" [...] campaign has been used in rural areas to promote toilets by encouraging women to refuse to marry a man who does not own a toilet. This type of campaign is embedded in other change efforts promoted by the Indian government in the Clean India Mission.|$|E
2500|$|Pit latrines are {{sometimes}} {{also referred to}} as [...] "dry toilets" [...] but this is not recommended because a [...] "dry toilet" [...] is an overarching term used for several types of toilets and strictly speaking only refers to the user interface. Depending on the region, the term [...] "pit latrine" [...] may be used to denote a toilet that has a squatting pan with a water seal or siphon (more accurately termed a pour-flush pit latrine – very common in South East Asia for example) or simply {{a hole in the ground}} without a water seal (also called a <b>simple</b> <b>pit</b> latrine) – the common type in most countries in sub-Saharan Africa. Whilst a dry toilet can be with or without urine diversion, a pit latrine is almost always without urine diversion. The key characteristic of a pit latrine is the use of a pit, which infiltrates liquids into the ground and acts as a device for storage and very limited treatment.|$|E

50|$|The Bronze Age, {{which came}} to Ireland around 2000 BC, saw the {{production}} of elaborate gold and bronze ornaments, weapons and tools. There was a movement away from the construction of communal megalithic tombs to the burial of the dead in small stone cists or <b>simple</b> <b>pits,</b> which could be situated in cemeteries or in circular earth or stone built burial mounds known respectively as barrows and cairns. As the period progressed, inhumation burial gave way to cremation and by the Middle Bronze Age, remains were often placed beneath large burial urns.|$|R
50|$|In anatomy, posterolateral palatal pits are gaps at {{the sides}} {{of the back of the}} bony palate, near the last molars. Posterolateral palatal pits are present, in various degrees of development, in several members of the rodent family Cricetidae. Many members of the family lack them or have only <b>simple</b> <b>pits,</b> but Arvicolinae (voles, lemmings, and relatives) and Oryzomyini (rice rats and relatives) have more highly {{developed}} posterolateral palatal pits. Posterolateral palatal pits are also present in some other rodents, including Glis, Jaculus, Hystrix, Abrocoma, Ctenomys, Chinchilla, and Lagidium.|$|R

[...] Within the family Viperidae, the pit organ is seen only in the subfamily Crotalinae: the pitvipers. Despite the detection of IR radiation, the pits’ IR mechanism is dissimilar to photoreceptors; while photoreceptors detect light via photochemical reactions, the protein in the facial pits of snakes is a temperature sensitive ion channel. It senses infrared signals through a mechanism involving warming of the pit organ, rather than chemical reaction to light. This is consistent with the thin pit membrane, which allows incoming IR radiation to quickly and precisely warm a given ion channel and trigger a nerve impulse, as well as vascularize the pit membrane to rapidly cool the ion channel back to its original “resting” or “inactive” temperature.|$|E
2500|$|The {{ability to}} sense {{infrared}} thermal radiation evolved independently in various families of snakes. Essentially, it allows these reptiles to [...] "see" [...] radiant heat at wavelengths between 5 and 30 μm {{to a degree}} of accuracy such that a blind rattlesnake can target vulnerable body parts of the prey at which it strikes.

The facial pit underwent parallel evolution in pitvipers and some boas and pythons, having evolved once in pitvipers and multiple times in boas and pythons. The electrophysiology of the structure is similar between the two lineages, but they differ in gross structural anatomy. Most superficially, pitvipers possess one large pit organ {{on either side of the}} head, between the eye and the nostril (Loreal pit), while boas and pythons have three or more comparatively smaller pits lining the upper and sometimes the lower lip, in or between the scales. Those of the pitvipers are the more advanced, having a suspended sensory membrane as opposed to a <b>simple</b> <b>pit</b> structure. Within the family Viperidae, the pit organ is seen only in the subfamily Crotalinae: the pitvipers. The organ is used extensively to detect and target endothermic prey such as rodents and birds, and it was previously assumed that the organ evolved specifically for that purpose. However, recent evidence shows that the pit organ may also be used for thermoregulation. According to Krochmal et al., pitvipers can use their pits for thermoregulatory decision making while true vipers (vipers who do not contain heat-sensing pits) cannot.|$|E

40|$|International audienceFossil wood {{specimens}} {{from the}} late Early-early Middle Jurassic of Jameson Land, Eastern Greenland, have several unexpected features: tracheids of irregular size and shape, thinly pitted ray cell walls, heterogeneous rays, partially scalariform radial pitting, both areolate and <b>simple</b> <b>pits,</b> and pitted elements associated with rays. These characters diverge markedly from those typical of Jurassic wood, which usually conform to those of modern conifers. Although this combination of features is not encountered in any extant angiosperm, each has been documented in one or several extant homoxylous angiosperms, particularly Amborella, Trochodendron, and Tetracentron. As these wood specimens are not found in connection with any reproductive part, {{it is impossible to}} confidently assign them to the angiosperms. If a Jurassic angiosperm did exist, however, it might well have had a similar wood. This material is an early bench-mark in the evolution that led from homoxylous conifer-like wood to that of the angiosperms. Its particular biogeography (Arctic) could renew the discussion about the area of origin of the angiosperm...|$|R
40|$|Comparative {{study of}} the stem anatomy of Annona trees was carried out to {{facilitate}} identification of taxa when their reproductive parts are not available. Stem specimens of four out of the five species categorized as important under-utilized species were collected and subjected to anatomical studies. Macerated materials followed Schutze�s method of maceration and the transverse sections of the stem were cut using Reichert Sledge Microtome. Intrageneric characters observed are: epidermal layer uniseriate with round, oval to polygonal collenchyma cells. Wood is diffuse-porous, vessel elements are diffuse, vessels are of two types, that is, short/wide with <b>simple</b> <b>pits</b> and long/narrow with bordered pits.
