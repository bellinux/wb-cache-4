40|$|In {{this paper}} we are {{extending}} our earlier {{work on the}} mathematical modelling of lashed trailer dynamics. The trailer can be placed anywhere on the vehicle deck(s) of a Ro/Ro ship. The paper begins with a discussion on the cargo-securing manual as applied to an existing ship. Thereafter we present the developed mathematical model where the excitation of the lashed trailer {{is provided by the}} combined roll and pitch motions, incited by steep waves encountering the ship from the side. The characteristics of the lashings, {{as well as those of}} the trailer <b>support</b> (<b>trestle)</b> and suspension systems are taken into account. Ship motions are simulated with a panel code and they are imported to the mathematical model of the lashed trailer, thus providing an integrated environment for the investigation of the cargo securing system on board a Ro/Ro ship. © 2008 Taylor & Francis Group, London...|$|E
40|$|The {{prediction}} {{of the dynamic}} behaviour of lashed trailers placed at various locations on the vehicle deck(s) of a ferry is discussed. Excitations on the lashed trailers are produced by the combined roll and pitch motions, caused by steep waves encountered by the ship from various angles. Firstly, the typical requirements of the IMO's Cargo Securing Manual, as implemented for an existing ferry, are presented. Thereafter the mathematical model that has been developed {{for the needs of}} the present study is set out. The characteristics of the lashings, {{as well as of the}} trailer <b>support</b> (<b>trestle)</b> and suspension systems, are taken into account. Ship motions are simulated with a well-known panel code, and they are subsequently imported into the mathematical model of lashed trailers. This is a step towards an integrated 'performance-based' framework for the investigation of cargo safety on board that is ship and environment specific. © 2009 IMechE...|$|E
25|$|In 1934, a 20-year-old {{man from}} Ogden, Utah {{fell to his}} death as he {{attempted}} to stand up when the train was on its highest hill. He hit a number of <b>support</b> <b>trestles</b> on the way down.|$|R
50|$|The {{ride was}} built with wooden running rails {{which were in}} a trough, like usual scenic railways; only the trough is {{partially}} set into the landscape and is concrete in construction. The ride lacks the tradition <b>supporting</b> <b>trestles</b> of scenic railways; the track running in depressions made {{into the ground and}} along the top of a coastal wall at one point. The running rails have since been changed to steel.|$|R
50|$|In the United States, a {{table or}} desk <b>supported</b> by X-shaped <b>trestles</b> is usually called a sawbuck table.|$|R
50|$|A {{conventional}} steel rail with 50 to 80 lb/yd (25-40 kg/m) {{was installed}} on a central 4×6 inch (15×20 cm) wooden beam. This was <b>supported</b> by <b>trestles</b> 8 feet (2.5m) apart. 2×6 inch (5×15 cm) balancing boards {{attached to the}} sides of the trestles.|$|R
50|$|Personnel from Virginia Tech have {{described}} in detail {{how to build a}} stringer bridge using standard bridge design procedures, for example, by placing timber stringers across the abutment, using a bent to <b>support</b> a <b>trestle</b> or timber frame.

50|$|A {{number of}} {{accidents}} have {{occurred on the}} Roller Coaster since its opening, though all {{were related to the}} persons' own misconduct. In 1989, a 13-year-old girl stood up and fell 35 feet to her death. She was pronounced dead at the scene. At least two more deaths have occurred over the years. In 1934, Henry Howe, 20, of Ogden, Utah fell to his death as he attempted to stand up when the train was on its highest hill. Howe hit a number of <b>support</b> <b>trestles</b> on the way down. In 1946, James Young Hess was struck by the train as he was working on scaffolding on the ride. Hess suffered skull, leg and arm fractures and internal injuries before dying on September 1, 1946.|$|R

40|$|Elevated intze {{tanks are}} used to store large {{quantity}} of water. They {{are used to}} supply water under gravity. Intze tanks are known as modified version of cylindrical tanks. They may be shaft <b>supported</b> or <b>trestle</b> <b>supported.</b> Earlier IS: 1893 - 1984 considered elevated tanks as single degree of freedom systems. But IS: 1893 - 2002 (Part 2), suggests two mass model having impulsive and convective modes of vibration for elevated tanks. This paper presents a parametric study to analyze the effect of variation of height/diameter (h/d) ratio of tank container and tank capacities on parameters like time period, base shear, base moment and hydrodynamic pressure for both the modes. It is hoped, that this studywill be helpful to understand the seismic behaviour of intze tank supported on shaft...|$|R
2500|$|The [...] Beachley Viaduct is also {{of similar}} box girder {{construction}} as the Severn Bridge but is <b>supported</b> on steel <b>trestles</b> as it crosses the Beachley peninsula. The peninsula contains an army camp, which the bridge crosses.|$|R
50|$|Work on {{the bridge}} started on May 22, 1905, when a {{groundbreaking}} ceremony was led by Joe Moss. It was finished in December 1906 and, at that time, was the longest rail trestle in the United States and the third longest bridge {{of its kind in}} the world. It has 18 towers for <b>support.</b> Other <b>trestles</b> constructed since that time are longer, such as the Hi-Line Railroad Bridge in Valley City, North Dakota, which is 3860 ft long.|$|R
50|$|Construction {{began on}} November 1890 with the {{clearing}} {{of the right}} of way between James Street South and the Caledonia Road near the site of the Mountain View Hotel. The double tracks were 700 feet in length on a grade of 31% to overcome the 195-foot rise of the escarpment. Over half the line was <b>supported</b> on <b>trestles</b> which, at their maximum, held the 36-foot-long cars 50 feet above the ground. Stationary engines drew the cars to the top using steel cables.|$|R
50|$|A <b>trestle</b> <b>support</b> (called as well trestle legs) {{is mainly}} a {{horizontal}} {{piece of wood}} fitted with four divergent legs that serve, together with at least {{another one of the}} same type, to hold a board or several posts forming a temporary table or desk.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} a theory, combined with design equations, {{to compute the}} loads on structural elements, in particular those of trestle legs of tubular construction supporting load-out belt conveyors, where the trestle legs are substantially buried in gravity reclaim stockpiles. The stress conditions, both active and passive, that arise during filling and reclaim are examined {{taking into account the}} position of the <b>trestle</b> <b>supports</b> with respect to the load out conveyor discharge during filling, and reclaim hoppers during draw-down. The theory examines the various loading conditions due to the stored bulk solids focusing on the determination of the lateral or bending load distribution on the <b>trestle</b> <b>support</b> legs. The compressive, in-plane shear traction loads which may influence the buckling effect in the buried legs are also examined...|$|R
50|$|The West James Street Overpass is a {{historic}} bridge in Redfield, Arkansas. It carries West James Street (or Avenue) across the Union Pacific railroad tracks {{near the center of}} the community. It is a timber trestle structure, with six spans over a total length of 131 ft, a deck width of 20 ft, and an overall width of 26 ft. Its abutments are a combination of wood and concrete, and the posts <b>supporting</b> the <b>trestles</b> are mounted on concrete footings. It was built in 1924.|$|R
50|$|The viaduct was {{remarkable}} {{in being a}} rare example of a lattice girder <b>supported</b> on <b>trestles,</b> a combination of which {{there may have been}} only one other example (fortunately still extant) in Britain, at Bennerley Viaduct, though in that instance the trestles are not as high. On other well-known trestle-supported viaducts, such as Meldon, Belah, and Crumlin, the superstructure is not a lattice, being typically a Warren truss; and other lattice girders are low structures supported typically on iron caissons, such as Kew Railway Bridge.|$|R
50|$|Roy's {{first task}} (1784) was to measure a base line between Hampton Poor House and King's Arbour on Hounslow Heath, a {{distance}} of just over 5 miles (8 km). This was a painstaking process: three rods of about 20 ft. were <b>supported</b> on <b>trestles</b> and the ends aligned to an accuracy of a thousandth part of an inch. The first rod was then carried {{to the end of}} the third, an operation to be repeated 1370 times. The final measurement gave the length of the base as 27404.01 ft. (8352 metres).|$|R
50|$|Crushed {{material}} from the northern plant was carried to the storage bin by a conveyor belt <b>supported</b> on a <b>trestle</b> framework. All power was supplied by electric motors. Workshops for blacksmithing and fitting and two compressors, which supplied air via pipelines for rock drills at the quarries, were located nearby.|$|R
50|$|The Maginnis Irrigation Aqueduct, {{in rural}} Kimball County, Nebraska {{about five miles}} from Kimball, was built in 1912 by Patrick Maginnis. It {{consists}} of a woodend <b>trestle</b> <b>supporting</b> a galvanized steel flume, about 55 m long and about 4.5 m in maximum height. It {{was part of the}} Bay State Irrigation Canal.|$|R
50|$|The structure's {{design is}} based around a central 486 m double beam {{that runs the}} whole length of the {{single-track}} crossing. This is <b>supported</b> by a <b>trestle</b> made from four iron girders that have cross bracing and are riveted together. The trestles stand on stone piers. A footbridge ran adjacent to the track.|$|R
50|$|The bridge has 15 wooden spans <b>supported</b> by <b>trestle</b> piers, and {{the five}} spans in the main river channel have {{triangular}} reinforcing trusses. Each trestle consists of five posts, one vertical and two to each side of it at an angle. Up to half-way up the pier it is reinforced by solid horizontal planking, and above that by diagonal beams {{on each side of}} the pier. The five beams which support the roadway sit on a round-ended beam on top of each pier. The abutments are granite, and the piers have metal plates on their upstream faces to protect against debris.|$|R
60|$|The fire at {{the lower}} end was by far the largest and hottest. Great black cauldrons hung over it, and {{servants}}, both men and women, with red faces, bare and grimed arms, and long iron hooks, or pots and pans, were busied around it. At the other end, which was raised about three steps above the floor of the hall, other servants were engaged. Two young maidens were strewing fresh rushes on the floor; some men were setting up a long table of rough boards, <b>supported</b> on <b>trestles,</b> and then ranging upon it silver cups, drinking horns, and wooden trenchers.|$|R
40|$|Steel {{and wooden}} <b>trestles</b> <b>supported</b> {{railroad}} tracks on the West Side Dock at Kelleys Island.

50|$|The present nine-arch masonry viaduct replaces {{an earlier}} {{structure}} designed by Isambard Kingdom Brunel for the Cornwall Railway. The original viaduct was opened to traffic when {{the line was}} extended from Truro to Falmouth in 1863 and had a timber deck <b>supported</b> by timber <b>trestles</b> springing from eleven masonry piers. It was 756 ft long and 96 ft high.|$|R
50|$|Qanun {{is played}} on the lap while sitting or squatting, or {{sometimes}} on <b>trestle</b> <b>support,</b> by plucking the strings with two tortoise-shell picks (one for each hand) or with fingernails, and has a standard range of {{three and a half}} octaves from A2 to E6 that can be extended down to F2 and up to G6 in the case of Arabic designs.|$|R
25|$|On the {{afternoon}} of July 6, 1881, heavy thunderstorms caused a flash flood of Honey Creek, washing out timbers that <b>supported</b> the railroad <b>trestle.</b> A pusher locomotive sent from Moingona to check track conditions crossed the Des Moines River bridge, but plunged into Honey Creek when the bridge fell away at about 11pm, with a crew of four— Ed Wood, A.P. Olmstead, Adam Agar, and Patrick Donahue.|$|R
50|$|One of {{the methods}} of working {{employed}} at Craven's was shooting a wet slurry of asbestos from a pressure gun. The operators would stand under a railway car <b>supported</b> on large <b>trestles</b> and spray the asbestos slurry in a 2 in layer onto {{the underside of the}} railway car. This was done to provide sound insulation {{to the floor of the}} railway car prior to final assembly.|$|R
5|$|The three {{sections}} of decking were assembled {{on the broad}} central reservation of Princess Road, and were craned into position over a weekend when Princess Road was closed. The decking was temporarily <b>supported</b> by <b>trestles</b> until the arch was ready. The six sections of the arch were welded together on site into two halves before being lifted into position during a second weekend. The cables were connected on third weekend. The bridge was formally opened on 10 May 1997 by Alex Ferguson in a ceremony including the Lord Mayor of Manchester and Tony Wilson. The ceremony was concluded by them being driven over the bridge in a Rolls-Royce Silver Ghost, and {{was followed by a}} street festival.|$|R
