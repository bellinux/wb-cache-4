40|$|Problem statement: The {{variations}} of formyl proton Chemical Shifts (CS) of p-substituted benzaldehydes in aromatic solvents were investigated. The validity of several physical solvent and empirical <b>solvent</b> <b>scales</b> was examined. Also, to predict dipolarity-polarizability (&# 960; *) <b>solvent</b> <b>scale</b> for some aromatic solvents. Model designing was also achieved to rationalize the aromatic solvent {{effect on the}} formyl proton CS. Approach: The previously recorded formyl proton CS for p-X- benzaldehydes, with X were NMe 2, OMe, OC 3 H 7, H, Br, CHO and NO 2 in benzene, toluene, p-xylene, m-xylene and mesitylene were subjected to Factor Analysis (FA). Target Factor Testing technique (TFT) was performed for several <b>solvent</b> <b>scales</b> namely: Unity, the intrinsic aromatic solvent induced shift of TMS (IASISTMS), f(n), f(d), (n 2 - 1) /(n 2 + 2), (d- 1) /(d+ 2), E T (30) and &# 960; *. Iterative TFT was applied to predict unmeasured (&# 960; *) <b>solvent</b> <b>scale</b> for ethyl benzene, n-butyl benzene, sec-butyl benzene, tert-butyl benzene and isopropyl benzene. Results: It {{has been found that}} two factors were responsible for the variation in the formyl proton CS. The unity, f(n), (n 2 - 1) /(n 2 + 2), IASISTMS, E T (30) and &# 960; * were real factors. Model designing of the formyl proton CS in benzene, toluene, p-xylene, m-xylene and mesitylene were achieved. The models with lowest root mean square error (RMSE) have shown that Unity is a consistent term. The other term was either IASISTMS or &# 960; *. Iterative TFT predicted new &# 960; * values for ethylbenzene, n-butylbenzene, sec-butylbenzene, tert-butylbenzene and isopropylbenzene respectively. Conclusion: FA has revealed that two real factors are responsible for the variation of formyl CS in benzene, toluene, p-xylene, m-xylene and mesitylene solvents. TFT has shown to be a powerful technique in predicting new values of the &# 960; * <b>solvent</b> <b>scale.</b> Model designing for the formyl proton CS have revealed that the IASISTMS, &# 960; * and Unity are the best empirical <b>solvent</b> <b>scales</b> and were better than any physical <b>solvent</b> <b>scales</b> in reproducing the formyl CS.

Catalan solvent parameters, which showed modest correlation with the corresponding Abraham descriptors, proved to be successful in modeling melting point, boiling point, flash point, refractive index, surface tension, density, and solubility parameter of the solvents with geometric mean relative deviations (GMRD) of 7. 1, 6. 6, 4. 9, 3. 8, 9. 1, 6. 0, and 4. 2 %, respectively. The solute descriptors were obtained from regression equations between a solute's solubility in different solvents with an overall GMRD of 30. 0 %. The solute descriptors obtained in this way outperformed Abraham general solvation model in the calculation of aqueous solubility for 27 solutes of broad chemical ranges.

Besides these physicochemical aspects regarding solute-solvent interactions, important implications of this study for the solid phase peptide synthesis were also observed. Each class of peptide-resin displayed a specific salvation profile that was dependent on the amount {{and the nature of the}} resin-bound peptide sequence. Plots of resin swelling versus solvent (AN+DN) values allowed the visualization of a maximum salvation region characteristic for each class of resin. This strategy facilitates the selection of solvent systems for optimal solvation conditions of peptide chains in every step of the entire synthesis cycle. Moreover, only the AN and DN concepts allow the understanding of rules for solvation/shrinking of peptide-resins when in homogeneous or in heterogeneous mixed solvents.

The traditional Grunwald-Winstein <b>scale</b> of <b>solvent</b> ionizing power (Y) has proved to be inadequate due to contributions from nucleophilic assistance to solvolysis of t-butyl chloride, the standard substrate. As structural features of both the 1 - and 2 -adamantyl systems preclude not only the intervention of nucleophilic participation, but also the possibility of rate-determining elimination, the solvolyses of adamantyl derivatives much better reflect the true ionizing power of a particular solvent system. Recent studies have also shown that a single <b>scale</b> of <b>solvent</b> ionizing power is inadequate to correlate the specific rates of solvolysis of a number of leaving groups. Y X <b>scales</b> of <b>solvent</b> ionizing power based on the solvolyses of adamantyl derivatives have been reported for seven anionic leaving groups. In this dissertation, three additional Y X scales are defined. A Y ONO 2 scale is defined by the specific rates of solvolysis of 1 -adamantyl nitrate at 50. 0 ∘C. Constant integrated first-order rate coefficients are observed in all solvents except 2, 2, 2 -trifluoroethanol, where an autocatalytic mechanism is proposed to operate. It is found that Y ONO 2 values correlate much better with Y OTs values, based on 2 -adamantyl p-toluenesulfonate, than with Y OClO 3 values, based on 2 -adamantyl perchlorate. Distributions of products from the solvolysis of 1 -adamantyl nitrate in ethanol/water mixtures are also examined. The specific rates of solvolysis of 2 -adamantyl 2, 2, 2 -trifluoroethanesulfonate and 2 -adamantyl pentafluorobenzenesulfonate are used for the definition of, respectively, Y OTr and Y PFBS values. These sulfonates solvolyze at rates intermediate to those of the corresponding p-toluenesulfonate and trifluoromethanesulfonate (OTS < OTr < PFBS < OTf), thus providing a bridge in the 105 - to 106 -fold nucleofugality gap between the two latter leaving groups. Y OTr and Y PFBS values are correlated against Y OTs values and against Y OTf values. The results of these correlations suggest that the sensitivities of the rates of solvolysis of these sulfonates to the effects of specific electrophilic solvation decline as the ability of the particular sulfonate to disperse a developing negative charge internally increases...|$|R

These data are complemented previously reported rate constants for the quaternisation reaction of triethylamine with iodoethane {{in the same}} solvents and at similar temperatures. Each of these two reaction series is analysed {{in terms of the}} isokinetic relationship (IKR) with respect to solvent variation and of the isosolvent relationship (ISoR) with respect to temperature variation, using in the latter case five different empirical <b>solvent</b> <b>scales.</b> Statistically validated IKR and ISoR have been found for both reaction series. The resulting isokinetic temperatures of 347 K (phosphine series) and of 730 K (amine series) are discussed in terms of Linert's theory of the isokinetic relationship. The best ISoR correlation is obtained using the Dimroth-Reichardt E-T(N) <b>solvent</b> <b>scale</b> for the phosphine series and the Kamlet-Taft a(KT) <b>solvent</b> <b>scale</b> for the amine series. It is demonstrated that no real solvent can be envisaged as having the characteristics of an isokinetic solvent. The selectivity of the nucleophiles triethylphosphine and triethylamine in the attack on iodoethane is examined by treating together both reaction series in terms of the isoselective relationship (ISeR). The isoselective temperature with respect to solvent is found to be 289 K, which is close to the value of 302 K predicted by Exner and Giese's formula {{on the basis of the}} individual isokinetic temperatures. A novel ISeR analysis with respect to temperature is performed.

A new equation is developed for predicting the isoselective solvent parameter from individual isosolvent parameters and is shown to yield realistic values.

On the basis of the experimentally determined isoparameter values, in liquid alcohols as solvent it is proposed that the reaction between triethylphosphine and iodoethane follows a classic bimolecular nucleophilic substitution pathway, whereas the desolvation of triethylamine molecules has to be taken into account to describe the mechanism of the original Menshutkin reaction...|$|R

Torsional angles are taken also explicitly into account, while retaining correct hydrodynamic interactions. A comparison with literature data is presented to prove the effectiveness of the approach {{for a wide range of}} molecular dimensions and solvent environments...|$|R
40|$|An {{efficient}} IBLF-dts {{scheme is}} proposed {{to integrate the}} bounce-back LBM and FVM scheme to solve the Navier-Stokes equations and the constitutive equation, respectively, for the simulation of viscoelastic fluid flows. In order to improve the efficiency, the bounce-back boundary treatment for LBM is introduced in to improve the grid mapping of LBM and FVM, and the two processes are also decoupled in different time scales according to the relaxation time of polymer and the time <b>scale</b> of <b>solvent</b> Newtonian effect. Critical numerical simulations {{have been carried out}} to validate the integrated scheme in various benchmark flows at vanishingly low Reynolds number with open source CFD toolkits. The results show that the numerical solution with IBLF-dts scheme agrees well with the exact solution and the numerical solution with FVM PISO scheme and the efficiency and scalability could be remarkably improved under equivalent configurations...|$|R
40|$|Fully atomistic {{simulations}} of water/methanol mixtures of varying compositions (80 / 20 and 50 / 50) at chromatographic interfaces with different functionalizations are presented. The dynamical properties {{in terms of}} equilibration times and solvent exchange dynamics are characterized and found {{to depend on the}} different systems on the nanosecond time <b>scale.</b> The <b>solvent</b> density profile and the structuring of the stationary phase differ for derivatizations including (−CN, NO 2, −NH 2, −C 6 H 5) of the C 18 chain. The time scale and intensity of the water exchange dynamics differs for the different realizations of the chromatographic systems and ranges from 200 to 500 ps. Water exchange rates depend on solvent composition {{as well as on the}} functionalization of alkyl chains. Simulations with acridine as a probe molecule provide atomistic insight into the slot model...|$|R

Furfural {{has the potential to}} substitute fossil compounds on a large <b>scale</b> for polymers, <b>solvents,</b> fine chemicals and finally fuels. Industrial catalysts were reviewed and new catalysts were synthesized. The main difference to recent work is the abdication of supercritical fluids, organic solvents, phase modifiers and ionic liquids. With this also the contamination of the product is prevented and higher product qualities are obtained...|$|R

It is {{shown that the}} optical dynamics of HITCI in ethylene glycol occurs on distinctly different time <b>scales.</b> The ultrafast <b>solvent</b> response is modelled by a non-Markovian solvent oscillator, while the slow diffusional solvent motions are represented by an overdamped Markovian oscillator. With this model an oscillator-bath time correlation function is obtained that exhibits a bimodal behaviour: an initial fast Gaussian decay {{is followed by a}} slower, long exponential tail...|$|R
