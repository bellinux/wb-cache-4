40|$|For {{singular}} plane curves, {{the classical}} definitions of envelopes are vague. In order to define <b>envelopes</b> <b>for</b> singular plane curves, we introduce a one-parameter family of Legendre curves {{in the unit}} tangent bundle over the Euclidean plane and the curvature. Then we give a definition of an <b>envelope</b> <b>for</b> the one-parameter family of Legendre curves. We investigate properties of the <b>envelopes.</b> <b>For</b> instance, the <b>envelope</b> is also a Legendre curve. Moreover, we consider bi-Legendre curves and give a relationship between envelopes...|$|R

40|$|Commercially {{available}} products {{serve as}} good examples for the compounding pharmacist to produce quality compounded dosage forms. Their {{physical and chemical}} properties, when known, can provide valuable information for preparing similar dosage forms to patients. One of the important physical characteristics of preparations is their specific gravity. The specific gravity {{is defined as the}} density of the substance divided by the density of water at a given temperature. We purchased ten non-prescription products from a store in North Carolina. We tested three bottles of each product for their specific gravity using Densito 30 PX (Metter Toledo; Switzerland). The instrument is easy to use and allows calibration with a standard liquid (purified water or alcohol, U. S. P.) at different temperatures (0 oC to 40 oC). We measured each bottle of the same product thrice. The following products were tested for their specific gravity at room temperature: Alka-seltzer Plus (Bayer Health Care; Lot#- 276698 L); Children’s Advil (Wyeth Consumer Healthcare; Lot#-B 58397); Children’s Motrin (McNeil Consumer Healthcare; Lot#-ABM 011); Children’s Tylenol (McNeil Consumer Healthcare; Lot#-SSM 015); Children’s Zyrtec (McNeil Consumer Healthcare; Lot# <b>for</b> <b>bottle</b> 1 - 809301; Lot# <b>for</b> <b>bottles</b> 2 and 3 - 809302); Listerine (Lot#- 0619 LZ); Oral Health Rinse (TopCare; Lot#- 90 F 1001); Scope (Proctor & Gamble; Lot#- 95609187); Theraflu (Novartis Consumer Health; Lot# <b>for</b> <b>bottles</b> 1 and 3 - 10061769; Lot# <b>for</b> <b>bottle</b> 2 - 10063059); Tylenol Cold (McNeil Consumer Healthcare; Lot# <b>for</b> <b>bottles</b> 1 and 2 - 900009; Lot# <b>for</b> <b>bottle</b> 3 - 808311). The results are summarized in Table 1. The specific gravity for Children’s Motrin, Children’s Tylenol, Listerine, and Scope agree with previously published values using a pycnometer (1. 164, 1. 306, 1. 042, and 1. 009, respectively). 1 In general, the presence of suspended solid particles increases the specific gravity (e. g., Childrens Tylenol), whereas diluted hydroalcoholic solutions (e. g., Scope) have specific gravity near 1. 00 at room temperatur...|$|R
