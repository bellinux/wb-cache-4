Modeled on the United States Declaration of Independence, Stanton's declaration proclaimed that men and women are created equal. She proposed, among other things, a then-controversial resolution demanding voting rights for women. The final resolutions, including female suffrage, were passed, in no small measure, because of the support of Frederick Douglass, who attended and informally spoke at the convention.|$|E
5|$|In April 2012, the Boston Herald sparked an {{election}} controversy when it {{drew attention to}} Warren's Association of American Law Schools (AALS) directory entries from 1986 to 1995, which listed her as a minority professor.

Warren stated that she had self-identified as having Native American ancestry {{in order to meet}} others with a similar background. Harvard Law School had listed her as a minority professor in response to criticisms about a lack of faculty diversity, but Warren said that she was unaware of this until <b>she</b> <b>read</b> about it in a newspaper during the 2012 election.|$|E

Intrigued, she ordered copies of his work, and <b>she</b> <b>read</b> them with her cousins and friends around Volhynia. They were impressed by the understanding he showed toward women in La Physiologie du mariage, but felt that La Peau de chagrin portrayed them in a cruel and unforgiving light. Hańska {{wrote a letter to}} Balzac, signed it as L'Étrangère ("The Stranger"), and mailed it from Odessa on 28 February 1832.|$|E
5|$|Their {{relationship}} was further strained in 1946 when Fontaine made negative comments to an interviewer about deHavilland's new husband, Marcus Goodrich.
