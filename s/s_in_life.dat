40|$|Many {{interventions}} {{have been}} used to improve children 2 ̆ 7 s hand-related impairments or hand skill performance in functional activities so as to promote life participation. There is thus a need to have suitable instruments assessing children 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> participation <b>in</b> <b>life</b> situations that specifically require hand use in order to support and evaluate such interventions. This systematic review investigated the availability of potential instruments {{that can be used to}} assess children 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> participation specifically <b>in</b> <b>life</b> situations requiring hand use. Clinical utility and evidence for psychometric properties were also sourced. Database searches initially identified measures that were used to evaluate participation of children aged 2 - 12 years, involved self- or proxy report or interview administration and had generic application for a range of disabilities/diagnoses. These measures were further evaluated to determine if they fulfilled the above inclusion criteria and contained at least 60...|$|R

30|$|One of {{the main}} reasons for {{analyzing}} the age-at-death distribution is that doing so allows researchers to distinguish between delay and compression of mortality (Bergeron-Boucher et al. 2015; de Beer and Janssen 2016; Basellini et al. 2016). Delay is defined as the shift of the age-at-death distribution to the right (Vaupel 2010), which is reflected in an increase in the modal age at death (Canudas-Romo 2008). Compression is defined as a change {{in the shape of the}} age-at-death distribution resulting from a decline in the variability of the age at dying (Fries 1980; Wilmoth and Horiuchi 1999; Kannisto 2000). Until the 1970 <b>s,</b> increases <b>in</b> <b>life</b> expectancy <b>in</b> low-mortality countries were largely attributable to a decline in infant and child mortality and consequently compression. But in recent years, delay of mortality has been the main cause of increases <b>in</b> <b>life</b> expectancy <b>in</b> these countries (de Beer and Janssen 2016).|$|R

This study linked recollections about parental styles with academic success among university students and also {{examined the relationship between}} coping strategies and student academic success. Questionnaires on perceived parenting styles, coping strategies, and academic performance (self-recalled) were administered. Results indicated that recollected authoritative parenting style was conducive to higher academic performance, while permissive parenting style was detrimental and authoritarian parenting neither conducive nor detrimental.

These approaches all have in common the fact that they belong to currents of socio-constructivist thought.

40|$|This {{paper is}} based on The Works of Mary Birkett Card 1774 - 1817, an edition of the {{manuscript}} collection made by her son Nathaniel Card in 1834. The collection contains different genres and spans Card 2 ̆ 7 s life from childhood to near her death, forming a unique record of one woman 2 ̆ 7 s experience at the tum of {{the eighteenth and nineteenth}} centuries.

40|$|Emotional {{intelligence}} {{is the ability}} to recognise, understand and manage one 2 ̆ 7 s own and other 2 ̆ 7 s emotions (Salovey 2 ̆ 6 Mayer, 1990).

Despite the fact that emotional intelligence has been acknowledged as a foundation for student achievement and success in a higher education setting (Petrides Frederickson 2 ̆ 6 Furnham, 2004; Parker, Summerfeldt, Hogan 2 ̆ 6 Majeski, 2004; Lopes, et al. 2004; Pau 2 ̆ 6 Croucher, 1999), there is still limited empirical evidence to support the notion that emotional intelligence will enhance the student experience.

Failure to realize this personal aim <b>in</b> <b>life</b> leads to alienation from God, and death. The moral dilemma of Clement 2 ̆ 7 s interpretation of evil as failure of life 2 ̆ 7 s aim is not a conventional explanation of good and evil, but something much more: the option between real life and death.
