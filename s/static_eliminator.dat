50|$|Neutron {{radiation}} {{is essential to}} the working of nuclear reactors and nuclear weapons. The penetrating power of x-ray, gamma, beta, and positron {{radiation is}} used for medical imaging, nondestructive testing, and a variety of industrial gauges. Radioactive tracers are used in medical and industrial applications, as well as biological and radiation chemistry. Alpha radiation is used in <b>static</b> <b>eliminators</b> and smoke detectors. The sterilizing effects of ionizing radiation are useful for cleaning medical instruments, food irradiation, and the sterile insect technique. Measurements of carbon-14, can be used to date the remains of long-dead organisms (such as wood that is thousands of years old).|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to report {{significant}} progress in the development of the use of risk analysis and information in the non-reactor areas of the nuclear enterprise that is regulated by the US. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC). For the past quarter century, probabilistic risk assessment has been used to help guide safety and operational programs for commercial nuclear power plants that generate electricity. The non-reactor areas that NRC regulates includes all other aspects of the nuclear fuel cycle as well as medical and industrial applications of nuclear science. Risk insights and information could improve the way the NRC Office of Nuclear Materials Safety and Safeguards (NMSS) manages its regulatory processes: rulemaking, licensing, inspection and enforcement [I, 21. Beginning in February 2001, eight case studies were conducted of specific facilities (decommissioning, uranium recovery, and uranium enrich men t, gas chroma tog ra p hs, <b>static</b> <b>eliminators,</b> fixed gauges, transportation of the Trojan vessel package, and TMI- 2 fuel debris storage exemption) to gain insight on how these and other areas have been and potentially can be risk-informed. These studies involved site visits, analysis, and participation in meetings with stakeholders. The case studies were designed [3] to meet the following objectives...|$|R
