60|$|Although none of {{the party}} had ever set a <b>net</b> <b>on</b> <b>stakes</b> before, they had {{frequently}} heard of this manner of fishing, and their first attempt proved eminently successful. At low tide stakes had been driven into the sand, extending {{from the edge of}} the water towards high-water mark. <b>On</b> these the <b>nets</b> had been spread, and thus the misfortune which had attended the setting of the nets with floats and sinkers was avoided. The quantity of fish taken gave promise of an ample supply for the future. There were two Hearne-salmon (that is, spotted like trout), and one large common salmon, besides thirty white-fish, averaging between two to six pounds weight each, all of which were in excellent condition. The white-fish is of the salmon species, but white in the flesh, and being less rich than the salmon, is much preferred by those who have to use it constantly as an article of food.|$|R

She {{then went on}} to finish the year by {{recording}} another two quarterfinal appearances, in Linz, where she was the defending champion but fell to eventual champion Cibulková, and in Moscow, to eventual runner-up Daria Gavrilova. The loss to Gavrilova meant Pavlyuchenkova had failed to reach a semifinal throughout the season, her best result being seven quarterfinal showings. Nevertheless, she maintained her year-end ranking from the previous year, world no. 28.|$|R
