40|$|High-resolution {{geophysical}} {{and sediment}} core data {{are used to}} investigate the pattern and dynamics of former ice flow in Kvitøya Trough, northwestern Barents Sea. A new swath-bathymetric dataset identifies three types of submarine landform {{in the study area}} (streamlined landforms, meltwater channels and cavities, iceberg scours). Subglacially produced streamlined landforms provide a record of ice flow through Kvitøya Trough during the last glaciation. Flow directions are inferred from the orientations of streamlined landforms (drumlins, crag-and-tail features). Ice flowed northward for at least 135 km from an ice divide {{at the southern end of}} Kvitøya Trough. A large channel-cavity system incised into bedrock in the southern trough indicates that subglacial meltwater was present at the former ice-sheet base. Modest landform elongation ratios and a lack of mega-scale glacial lineations suggest that, although ice in Kvitøya Trough was melting at the bed and flowed faster than the likely thin and cold-based ice on adjacent banks, a major ice stream probably did not occupy the trough. Retreat was relatively rapid after 14 - 13. 5 14 C kyr B. P. and probably progressed via ice <b>sheet-bed</b> decoupling in response to rising sea level. There is little evidence for still stands during ice retreat or of ice-proximal deglacial sediments. Relict iceberg scours in present-day water depths of more than 350 m in the northern trough indicate that calving was an important mass loss mechanism during retreat...|$|R

Well, well, this morning, we had word from Apia; a hurricane was looked for, the ships were to leave the bay by 10 A.M.; it is now 3.30, and the flagship is still a fixture, and the wind round in the blessed east, so I suppose the danger is over. But heaven is still laden; the day dim, with frequent rattling bucketfuls of rain; and just this moment (as I write) a squall went overhead, scarce striking us, with that singular, solemn noise of its passage, which is to me dreadful.

We have recently shown that introduction of two N-methyl rests in the β <b>sheet-</b> and amyloid-core-containing sequence hIAPP(22 – 27), or NFGAIL converted this amyloidogenic and cytotoxic sequence into nonamyloidogenic and noncytotoxic NF(N-Me) GA(N-Me) IL.

NF(N-Me) GA(N-Me) IL also inhibits hIAPP-mediated apoptotic β cell death. By contrast, unmodified NFGAIL does not inhibit hIAPP amyloidogenesis and cytotoxicity, suggesting that N-methylation conferred on NFGAIL the properties of NF(N-Me) GA(N-Me) IL.

The previous paper erroneously rejected a set of <b>sheet-</b> prominence solutions, the recovery of which allows for a simple theoretical estimate of the mass of a quiescent prominence.

Recent structural work on mammalian VDAC- 1 has only used recombinant material, refolded from Escherichia coli inclusion bodies.

40|$|The {{modern history}} of disability, and of speech impediments in particular, {{has largely been}} written as one of medical {{discourse}} and (more recently) {{of social and cultural}} imaginations. The pathology of speech appears as an embodied, but ultimately intangible, issue due to the transient nature of sound itself. Once produced, it disappears, and seems to escape memory. In this text, stammering is approached as an object of material history. Drawing on the “paper trail” left by medical experts, popular entertainers and a handful of stammerers’ experiences, this paper examines the ways in which stammering was made material in the nineteenth century.

40|$|The {{present study}} analyzes, in {{parallel}} with published data for the Galaxy, neutral hydrogen (H I) absorption and deduced emission detected along seven lines of sight through the disk of M 31. It is shown that the brightness temperature of H I emission is coupled to the opacity of the gas. The Galactic relationship shows asymptotic trends at {{both large and small}} opacities. A simple yet effective physical model which accounts for this behavior consists of only two independent components: a high-opacity cool component of fixed mean temperature, and a low-opacity warm component of fixed mean brightness. A lower mean gas pressure by a factor of about 2 is argued to be the most plausible mechanism for accounting for a higher cool-component H I temperature in M 31. Deduced volume filling factors of the Galactic H I are about 1 and 15 percent, respectively, for the cool and warm components, while for M 31 they are 8 and 30 percent. The large ratio of surface to volume filling factors for both cool and warm H I suggests that these components are distributed predominantly as large <b>sheet-</b> or shell-like structures...|$|E

40|$|AbstractCell {{movement}} is {{mediated by the}} protrusion of cytoplasm in the form of <b>sheet-</b> and rod-like extensions, termed lamellipodia and filopodia. Protrusion is driven by actin polymerization, a process that is regulated by signaling complexes that are, as yet, poorly defined. Since actin assembly is controlled at the tips of lamellipodia and filopodia [1], these juxtamembrane sites are likely to harbor the protein complexes that control actin polymerization dynamics underlying cell motility. An understanding of the regulation of protrusion therefore requires the characterization of the molecular components recruited to these sites. The Abl interactor (Abi) proteins, targets of Abl tyrosine kinases [2 – 4], have been implicated in Rac-dependent cytoskeletal reorganization in response to growth factor stimulation [5]. Here, we describe the unique localization of Abi proteins in living, motile cells. We show that Abi- 1 and Abi- 2 b fused to enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP) are recruited to the tips of lamellipodia and filopodia. We identify the targeting domain as the homologous N terminus of these two proteins. Our findings are the first to suggest a direct involvement of members of the Abi protein family in the control of actin polymerization in protrusion events, and establish the Abi proteins as potential regulators of motility...|$|E

Recent activities at the National Research Council - Canada (NRC-C) and the University of California - Berkeley (UC-B) have resulted in bulk synthesis of few-walled, small diameter BNNTs. Both processes employ induction plasma technology to create boron vapor and highly reactive nitrogen species at temperatures in excess of 8000 K.

Strain has shown potential in serving as early indicator for a host of cardiac diseases such coronary disease, hypertension, etc. Therefore, it is crucial to develop techniques to accurately determine strain. There are many different methods to measure cardiac regional mechanics using a variety of techniques such as Doppler echocardiographic imaging as well harmonic phase algorithm (HARP). These methods are popular, as they have produced accurate systolic strains. However, both methods have their limitations. Previous studies have combined HARP with finite element modeling to compute 3 D circumferential, radial and longitudinal strains in mice, however they limited their calculations to the left ventricle.

40|$|The {{formation}} of the dust cloud {{that is associated with}} low-level helicopter operations in desert environments has been simulated using the Vorticity Transport Model together with a coupled model to represent the entrainment and subsequent transport of particulate matter through the flow. A simple thin-layer theory, supported by simulations performed using the more physically-representative numerical model, is used to explain the {{formation of}} characteristic <b>sheet-</b> and filament-like structures in the dust cloud in terms of the interactions between individual vortical filaments and the ground. In parts of the flow, for instance near the ground vortex that is formed under {{the leading edge of the}} rotor when in forward flight, the dust cloud becomes more space-filling than sheet-like in character, and the theory suggests that this is a result of the dust distribution having been processed by multiple vortices over a significant period of time. The distribution of the regions on the ground plane from which significant entrainment of dust into the flow takes place is shown to be influenced strongly by the unstable nature of the vortical structures within the flow. It is suggested that the effect of this vortical instability, when integrated over the timescales that are characteristic of the {{formation of the}} dust cloud, is to de-sensitize the gross characteristics of the dustcloud to the details of the wake structure at its inception on the rotor blades.

After 7 days of culture, microstructures were observed using hematoxylin and eosin staining and immunostaining using anti-CK 8 / 18 antibody. Albumin secretion rate was determined by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method. In addition, polarity-related proteins, E-cadherin, ezrin, and MRP 2 were observed with immunostaining. Results: Control spheroids without the use of alginate hydrogel beads showed extensive internal lack of epithelial hepatic cells. The spheroids containing alginate hydrogel beads exhibited <b>sheet-</b> or cord-like structures of epithelial hepatic cells, and it was clear that cell death of epithelial cells had been prevented. Albumin secretion data also supported the improvement of epithelial hepatic cell viability when alginate hydrogel beads were used. Localization of polarity-related proteins indicated the partial reconstitution of cell polarity in the spheroids using alginate hydrogel beads. Conclusion: Based on these data, we concluded that the application of alginate hydrogel beads was effective in improving the epithelial hepatic cell culture of multicellular spheroids...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{compares the}} {{stability}} of the U. S. Dual Banking system’s two bank groups, national and state banks, in light of the global financial crisis 2007 / 2008. The goal of the paper is to answer three distinct questions: first, is there a difference in the (balance <b>sheet-)</b> fragility between the two groups and, second, to what extent has the balance sheet fragility of both groups changed after the escalation of the financial crisis beginning in August 2007 ? Building on that, the third question asks {{to whether or not the}} respective regulatory agencies of both bank groups are responsible for these changes in balance sheet fragility in light of the financial crisis. To answer these questions the paper uses U. S. Call Report data containing full quarterly balance sheets and P&Ls of all U. S. commercial banks over the period 2005 - 2008. Anecdotal evidence as well as univariate and multivariate difference-in-difference methodology focusing on the immediate pre-crisis period Q 1 / 2005 to Q 3 / 2007 and the crisis period Q 3 / 2007 to Q 4 / 2008 are applied. Highly significant and robust results show that, ceteris paribus, national banks reduced their potential balance sheet fragility after the escalation of the crisis in August 2007 by reducing lending and liquidity creation stronger than state banks. Anecdotal evidence supports the empirical findings. Although both FDIC and OCC did not anticipate the adverse effects of the crisis, the OCC publicly showed an earlier reaction to liquidity-related problems than the FDIC. The paper is the first of its kind to analyze bank fragility around the escalation of the financial crisis and the role of the regulatory agencies. The paper holds especially interesting policy implications in the light of the current discussion about the future regulation of the banking markets...|$|E
40|$|A plug-like {{intrusion}} of Karroo dolerite, near Dordrecht in the Eastern Cape of the Republic, is described. Field mapping with the, aid of aerial photographs {{has revealed that}} the contact of the intrusion, for the most part, dips very steeply outwards. In the south- eastern and eastern areas, however, <b>sheet-</b> or sill-like forms appear to be given off from the main intrusion. In plan view the intrusion is roughly oval shaped, its longer axis being aligned in a north-westerly direction. Its surface area measures approximately 60 square kilometres (24 square miles). A large number of xenoliths composed exclusively of Stormberg sediments, pyroclastic rocks and minor lavas, {{are to be found}} cropping out within the dolerite intrusion. These xenoliths, many of which occur in positions far above or below their normal stratigraphic elevation, are extremely variable in size - the largest having an area of approximately 15 square kilometres (6 square miles). The xenoliths represent fragments of the original "roof" of sediments and pyroclastics which have collapsed into and been engulfed by the dolerite magma. This type of dolerite intrusion is known as a "belljar" intrusion. A superficial classification of the dolerites, based chiefly on textural and certain mineralogical features, is presented. In the area surrounding the main intrusion are a number of dolerite dikes and sheets. The youngest phase of igneous activity is represented by the Dragon's Back dike, which cuts across the complex in a north-westerly direction. Several veining phenomena, as well as an interesting variety of metamorphic and metasomatic rocks, are associated with the main dolerite intrusion. Six diatremes are situated {{in the vicinity of the}} intrusion. Pyroclastic rocks are represented by a variety of types, and are to be found outside the area of the intrusion, and as xenoliths within it. A tentative interpretation of the mechanism of formation of the intrusion, which appears to be related to volcanic activity and cauldron subsidence, is presented...|$|E
