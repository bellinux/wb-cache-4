40|$|<b>Salmefamol</b> {{is a new}} {{sympathomimetic}} drug with predominantly P 2 actions. In a {{double-blind trial}} {{in a group of}} twenty-four patients with airway obstruction, we have compared the effect of 100 tig of <b>salmefamol</b> given by metered aerosol with that ofa placebo aerosol. In the same patients we have also compared the aerosols with subcutaneous adrenaline and sub-cutaneous atropine, the sequence of treatments being determined by a latin square design. At all times <b>salmefamol</b> had a significantly greater bronchodilator effect than the placebo. Although the effects of atropine and adrenaline were greater at the earlier times of measurement, that of <b>salmefamol</b> was greater at 4 hr...|$|E

An {{economical}} {{method of}} comparing inhaled bronchodilators in reversible diffuse airways obstruction: with special {{reference to a}} β- 2 stimulant—salmefamol. A method is described for comparing the bronchodilator effect {{of a large number}} of drugs. It involves self-recording of peak expiratory flow rate by patients at home. From the experience gained, the method was used to compare isoprenaline, orciprenaline, terbutaline, salbutamol, and <b>salmefamol</b> with an inert pressurized aerosol. The results of the comparison show that the method is simple and practical and that <b>salmefamol</b> would seem to have a more prolonged bronchodilator effect than the other drugs tested...|$|E

It is simple to perform, and an accurate estimate of potency can be obtained in {{a small number of}} patients.

All proved to be active bronchodilators and were equipotent with isoprenaline or salbutamol. The assessment of bronchodilator drugs poses several problems. The natural variability of asthma and of patient response from day to day cause considerable difficulty (Hume and Gandevia, 1957; Hume and Rhys Jones, 1961). Even when initial measurements are the same on different days, the patient's response will depend on whether he is improving or getting worse at the time (Pain and Read, 1963). Further problems arise when considering what measurements t...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{work in our}} {{laboratory}} {{has shown}} that stimulation of beta 2 -adrenergic receptors on mouse anterior pituitary tumor cells causes the secretion of immunoreactive adrenocorticotropin (ACTH). The present {{study was designed to}} test the hypothesis that catecholamines can cause the release of ACTH in vivo by the direct stimulation of beta 2 -adrenergic receptors in the rat anterior pituitary. Systemic administration of a beta-adrenergic receptor agonist (-) -isoproterenol resulted in an increase in plasma ACTH levels in intact animals and in rats with transected pituitary stalks. This effect could be blocked by the beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist, propranolol, but not by the specific beta 1 -adrenergic receptor antagonist, practolol. <b>Salmefamol,</b> a beta 2 -adrenergic receptor agonist also elevated plasma ACTH levels in stalk-sectioned animals. Dexamethasone, a glucocorticoid that inhibits the synthesis and release of ACTH from the anterior pituitary but not the intermediate lobe, prevented the elevation of ACTH secretion by (-) -isoproterenol in stalk-transected rats. These data indicate that beta 2 -adrenergic receptors are present on anterior pituitary cells and suggest that catecholamines can directly stimulate ACTH secretion...|$|E
