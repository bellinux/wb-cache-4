2500|$|In 1934, {{producer}} Vinton Freedley {{came up with}} a {{new approach}} to producing musicals. Instead of commissioning book, music and lyrics and then casting the show, Freedley sought to create an ideal musical with stars and writers all engaged from the outset. The stars he wanted were Ethel Merman, William Gaxton and comedian Victor Moore. He planned a story about a shipwreck and a desert island, and for the book he turned to P. G. Wodehouse and Guy Bolton. For the songs, he decided on Porter. By telling each of these that he had already signed the others, Freedley gathered his ideal team together. A drastic last-minute rewrite was necessitated by a major <b>shipping</b> <b>accident,</b> which dominated the news and made Bolton and Wodehouse's book seem tasteless. Nevertheless, the show, Anything Goes, was an immediate hit. Porter wrote what is thought by many to be his greatest score of this period. The New Yorker magazine said, [...] "Mr. Porter is in class by himself", and Porter himself subsequently called it one of his two perfect shows, along with the later Kiss Me, Kate. Its songs include [...] "I Get a Kick Out of You", [...] "All Through the Night", [...] "You're the Top" [...] (one of his best-known list songs), and [...] "Blow, Gabriel, Blow", as well as the title number. The show ran for 420 performances in New York (a particularly long run in the 1930s) and 261 in London. [...] Porter, despite his lessons in orchestration from d'Indy, did not orchestrate his musicals. Anything Goes was orchestrated by Robert Russell Bennett and Hans Spialek. Now {{at the height of his}} success, Porter was able to enjoy the opening night of his musicals; he would make a grand entrance and sit in front, apparently relishing the show as much as any audience member. Russel Crouse commented, [...] "Cole's opening-night behaviour is as indecent as that of a bridegroom who has a good time at his own wedding." ...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACTThis study {{aimed to}} {{demonstrate}} and quantify {{the factors that}} influence ship safety and <b>ship</b> <b>accidents</b> and suggest policy recommendations for both government and the marine industry in Korea based on the application of system dynamics (SD). Korea was selected as the target country because a number of recent <b>ship</b> <b>accidents</b> have focused attention on ship safety in the region. Three factors that can influence ship safety were considered: economic factors, ship-handling and management factors, and government budget allocation of ship industry. SD was then applied to model the factors involved in <b>ship</b> <b>accidents.</b> Data on <b>ship</b> <b>accidents</b> in Korea from 2009 – 2014 were included in the model simulation. To measure the simulation accuracy, mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) analysis was employed. Following the simulation, a sensitivity analysis was conducted to determine the relationships among the factors involved in <b>ship</b> <b>accidents.</b> Finally, a simulation incorporating <b>ship</b> <b>accident</b> data and government budget allocated to the ship industry was performed. The results of this study can be used in government policy recommendations on ship safety to prevent and reduce <b>ship</b> <b>accidents...</b>|$|R

40|$|With the {{increased}} frequency of shipping activities, navigation safety {{has become a}} major concern, especially when economic losses, human casualties and environmental issues are considered. As a contributing factor, the sea state plays a significant role in shipping safety. However, the types of dangerous sea states that trigger serious <b>shipping</b> <b>accidents</b> are not well understood. To address this issue, we analyzed the sea state characteristics during <b>ship</b> <b>accidents</b> that occurred in poor weather or heavy seas based on a 10 -year <b>ship</b> <b>accident</b> dataset. Sea state parameters of a numerical wave model, i. e., significant wave height, mean wave period and mean wave direction, were analyzed for the selected <b>ship</b> <b>accident</b> cases. The results indicated that complex sea states with the co-occurrence of wind sea and swell conditions represent threats to sailing vessels, especially when these conditions include similar wave periods and oblique wave directions...|$|R

40|$|This study investigates {{determinants}} of the seaworthiness of <b>ships</b> involved in <b>accidents,</b> utilizing detailed data of individual tanker, container and bulk ship (U.

Ordered probit estimation results suggest that <b>ship</b> <b>accident</b> seaworthiness: 1) increases with ship size; 2) is greater if the ship is classified by the American Bureau of Shipping and manned by a licensed operator; and 3) is less for a tanker <b>ship,</b> for multi-ship <b>accidents,</b> at higher winds, {{if the weather is}} foggy, and for collision, fire/explosion and material/equipment failure accidents than for groundings. Estimated marginal <b>ship</b> <b>accident</b> seaworthiness probabilities suggest that policies that reduce fire/explosion and material/equipment failure accidents and increase the manning of ships by licensed operators are likely to be efficacious in improving <b>ship</b> <b>accident</b> seaworthiness.

50|$|On the Danube, chain {{ships were}} unable to travel {{downstream}} on the chain because of strong currents. If the chain boat was forced to stop suddenly, for example {{as a result of}} a chain breakage, there was a real danger that the barges at the rear would run into those at the front, causing a <b>shipping</b> <b>accident.</b> They therefore had large, side-mounted paddle wheels as auxiliary propulsion for the downstream journey which were driven by engines with a rating of 300-400 hp.|$|E
40|$|Abstract [...] This reseach is to {{evaluate}} {{the strength of the}} traditional ship constructions which focused on phinisi sailing motor vessel in efforts to improve their safety performance. This is because in recent years there has been an increase in traditional <b>ship</b> <b>accident</b> in Indonesian waters. The research was conducted by taking samples of the many <b>ship</b> <b>accidents</b> i. e. 100 GT- 150 GT. The results indicated that theoretically ships sailing in waters conditions under beaufort scale 4, 5, 6, which were generally navigable by traditional ships had adequate strength because their stress still smaller than the requirements on wood. However, in real conditions revealed any discrepancies with the technical requirements such as (i) no watertight bulkhead to separate the cargo hold and engine room; (ii) compaction cargoes which sometimes up to the deck; (iii) weaknesses in wooden construction that built traditionally under the influence of engine vibration. These facts in turn potentially large <b>ship</b> <b>accidents.</b> Indext Term [...] traditional ship, ship strength, ship safety. I...|$|R

40|$|Extract] This atlas {{documents}} ecologically {{and economically}} valuable intertidal marine habitats between Seo Reef and Kai-Wareg Reef, eastward of the Great North East (GNE) Shipping Channel in the Torres Strait. Areas of seagrass, algae and benthic macro-invertebrate habitats were identified during the surveys as being highly sensitive to <b>shipping</b> <b>accidents.</b> The diversity of habitats and their near pristine condition makes this area particularly valuable, with the habitats described important for subsistence and commercial fisheries and regional biodiversity. Torres Strait is also recognised {{as having a}} particularly high risk of <b>shipping</b> <b>accidents</b> as reefs, islands and shoals are {{in close proximity to}} the GNE Shipping Channel. The combination of high frequency of shipping traffic, complex navigation through reefs and islands, and highly sensitive and diverse marine habitats means the Seo Reef to Kai-Wareg Reef region is highly vulnerable to <b>shipping</b> <b>accidents</b> and oil spills. The Torres Strait Regional Authority Land and Sea Management Unit in delivering the Environmental Management Program conduct a range of programs that focus on long-term monitoring of valuable habitat resources. The information in this atlas provides managers, rangers and community members a baseline on which habitat community monitoring programs could be established. Seagrass has been identified by managers and rangers as an area of particular interest, with rangers from many communities identifying long-term seagrass monitoring a key priority of the local ranger program. The information in this atlas also will be incorporated into the National Oil Spill Response Atlas to assist in the planning and management of <b>shipping</b> <b>accidents</b> in the Torres Strait...|$|R
