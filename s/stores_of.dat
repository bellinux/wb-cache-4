5|$|Ants form {{symbiotic}} {{associations with}} a range of species, including other ant species, other insects, plants, and fungi. They also are preyed on by many animals and even certain fungi. Some arthropod species spend part of their lives within ant nests, either preying on ants, their larvae, and eggs, consuming the food <b>stores</b> <b>of</b> the ants, or avoiding predators. These inquilines may bear a close resemblance to ants. The nature of this ant mimicry (myrmecomorphy) varies, with some cases involving Batesian mimicry, where the mimic reduces the risk of predation. Others show Wasmannian mimicry, a form of mimicry seen only in inquilines.|$|E

5|$|By 1845, the {{population}} was 6,475. In 1846, there were useful roads to many communities as well as stage coaches and steamboats to Toronto, Queenston, and Niagara. Eleven cargo schooners were owned in Hamilton. Eleven churches were in operation. A reading room provided access to newspapers from other cities and from England and the U.S. In addition to <b>stores</b> <b>of</b> all types, four banks, tradesmen of various types, and sixty-five taverns, industry in the community included three breweries, ten importers of dry goods and groceries, five importers of hardware, two tanneries, three coachmakers, and a marble and a stone works.|$|E
5|$|During the 1906 {{legislative}} session, Beckham urged {{investigation and}} prosecution of corrupt insurance companies, {{following the lead of}} New York attorney Charles Evans Hughes. In particular, he recommended reducing the practice of deferred dividends, which allowed the insurance companies to keep large <b>stores</b> <b>of</b> cash on-hand for illegal purposes. He further advocated that insurance companies doing business in the state be required to invest a certain percentage of their earnings in Kentucky, bolstering the its economy and providing policyholders some protection against fraud.|$|E
5|$|Each Staffel was {{expected}} to make at least three firing passes. I./JG 3 took off and joined the lead Gruppe, IV Sturm./JG 3, with III./JG 3 following in the rear. The Bf 109s and Fw 190s of the Geschwader reached the area at about 09:20. Geschwaderkommodore Heinrich Bär led the attack. Some pilots made four passes, destroying AAA emplacements, fuel storage stations and vehicles. Nearly 300 aircraft were on the field, along with huge <b>stores</b> <b>of</b> equipment and fuel. The attack caused fires all over the airfield.|$|E

5|$|In {{cases of}} {{paracetamol}} overdose, the sulfate and glucuronide pathways become saturated, and more paracetamol is shunted to the cytochrome P450 system to produce NAPQI. As a result, hepatocellular supplies of glutathione become depleted, as {{the demand for}} glutathione is higher than its regeneration. NAPQI therefore remains in its toxic form in the liver and reacts with cellular membrane molecules, resulting in widespread hepatocyte damage and death, leading to acute liver necrosis. In animal studies, the liver's <b>stores</b> <b>of</b> glutathione must be depleted to less than 70% of normal levels before liver toxicity occurs.|$|E
5|$|Many {{species of}} bird, in {{particular}} honeyeaters, forage at the flower spikes, as do native and European honeybees. The response to bushfire varies. Some populations are serotinous: they {{are killed by}} fire and regenerate from large <b>stores</b> <b>of</b> seed which have been held in cones in the plant canopy and are released after a fire. Others regenerate from underground lignotubers or suckers from lateral roots. Although {{it has been used}} for timber, Banksia marginata is most commonly seen as a garden plant, with dwarf forms being commercially propagated and sold.|$|E
5|$|Native mammals, such as {{the brown}} antechinus and sugar glider, are {{important}} pollinators of B. paludosa. Several species of honeyeaters visit the flower spikes, as do ants and the European honey bee. The response to bushfire depends on the subspecies; subspecies paludosa regenerates from underground lignotubers, while plants of subspecies astrolux are killed by fire and regenerate from large <b>stores</b> <b>of</b> seed which have been held in cones in the plant canopy. B. paludosa is sometimes seen in cultivation, with dwarf forms being registered and sold.|$|E

50|$|A <b>store</b> <b>of</b> {{value is}} the {{function}} of an asset that can be saved, retrieved and exchanged at a later time, and be predictably useful when retrieved. More generally, a <b>store</b> <b>of</b> value is anything that retains purchasing power into the future.|$|R
5|$|Some {{dealers and}} antique shops remain, {{but many of}} the shops have come to be {{occupied}} by fashion boutiques, some branches of global designer brands. The street still has a reputation as a fashionable place for shopping, including the flagship <b>stores</b> <b>of</b> Ralph Lauren and Cartier. Fenwick have had a department store on Bond Street since 1891. The Phillips building at No.101 is still used for auctions; the company was bought in 2001 by Bonhams, who spent £30million expanding and refurbishing the premises. In 2015, Valentino announced plans to build a new flagship store on Old Bond Street.|$|E
5|$|The Billboard 200, {{published}} in Billboard magazine, is a weekly chart that ranks the highest-selling music albums and EPs in the United States. In 1983, {{the name of}} the chart was Top LPs & Tape. Before Nielsen SoundScan began tracking sales in 1991, Billboard estimated sales from a representative sampling of record stores nationwide, using telephone, fax or messenger service. Data were based on rankings made by the record <b>stores</b> <b>of</b> the best-selling records, not on actual sales figures.|$|E
5|$|The castle {{continued}} to fulfil several other local functions. During {{the outbreak of}} plague in 1666, the castle {{was used as an}} isolation ward for infected patients, and during the Napoleonic Wars the castle was used to hold the equipment and <b>stores</b> <b>of</b> the local Framlingham Volunteer regiment. Following the closure of the poorhouse, the castle was then used as a drill hall and as a county court, as well as containing the local parish jail and stocks.|$|E

5|$|This was a cashless society; the {{settlers}} bartered their <b>stores</b> <b>of</b> water, wood, vegetables, meat, fish and bird feathers for clothes, tea, sugar, tools, tobacco and other commodities not {{available on the}} island – {{but it was the}} whalers’ valuation that had to be accepted. These first settlers eventually left the island when they were bought out for £350 in September 1841 by businessmen Owen Poole and Richard Dawson (later joined by John Foulis) whose employees and others then settled on the island.|$|E
5|$|Acetylcysteine, {{also called}} N-acetylcysteine or NAC, works to reduce {{paracetamol}} toxicity by replenishing body <b>stores</b> <b>of</b> the antioxidant glutathione. Glutathione reacts with the toxic NAPQI metabolite {{so that it}} does not damage cells and can be safely excreted. NAC was usually given following a treatment nomogram (one for patients with risk factors, and one for those without) but the use of the nomogram is no longer recommended as the evidence base to support the use of risk factors was poor and inconsistent and many of the risk factors are imprecise and difficult to determine with sufficient certainty in clinical practice. Cysteamine and methionine have also been used to prevent hepatotoxicity, although studies show that both are associated with more adverse effects than acetylcysteine. Additionally, acetylcysteine {{has been shown to be}} a more effective antidote, particularly in patients presenting greater than 8 hours post-ingestion.|$|E
5|$|As {{the rest}} of the 3rd Light Horse Brigade {{advanced}} to Tiberias, their left flank moved over the site of the 1187AD Battle of Hattin. On 26 September, the 3rd Light Horse Brigade camped to the north of Tiberias, at Medjel on the shore of the Sea of Galilee. A squadron of the 9th Light Horse Regiment rode out at 12:30 to investigate reports of a considerable enemy force at Safed. By the time they arrived at 18:00, the force had withdrawn. Meanwhile, the 8th Light Horse Regiment restored order in the town and established guards on <b>stores</b> <b>of</b> grain while the remainder of the brigade rested after their night-time advance.|$|E

5|$|Collier's fleet {{arrived at}} the mouth of the river early on August 13. He boarded 123 marines onto the Hope, and ordered her and the Blonde up the river. Word of this reached the militia, and thrty-five men mustered to oppose them. The ships reached the log boom, and a firefight began between the two forces. The militia {{resistance}} was sufficient to keep the British from attempting a landing that day. Early the next morning, under the cover of fog, the marines were landed. They cut the log boom, seized a sloop carrying lumber, and set fire to a storehouse, seizing <b>stores</b> <b>of</b> flour, rice, corn, shoes, and ammunition before returning to the ships.|$|E
5|$|In recent years, {{the company}} has expanded, opening new <b>stores</b> <b>of</b> its own and {{acquiring}} competitors. In 2010, Triumph International acquired Beldona, the leading Swiss distributor of lingerie, and later purchased other distributors in Mexico and the United States. In the latter country, Triumph International has also acquired the majority stake in the luxury dealer Journelle and has since opened two Triumph stores in New York City. The Triumph International AG, headquartered in Munich, under which the company's German business is associated, was once again fully acquired by the company in 2011 through the exclusion of minority shareholders. Since then, company stocks have no longer been traded on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, {{and the company is}} wholly owned by the Braun and Spiesshofer families.|$|E
5|$|The French {{defenders}} of the island were weakened by years of isolation caused by the British blockade. Although the available French troops numbered between 3,000 and 4,000, there was an epidemic {{on the island and}} a significant proportion of the garrison, principally formed by the 66e Régiment, were unfit for duty. Apart from the capital, the rest of the island's defences were manned by a militia formed from local inhabitants, among whom morale was low and desertion rates high. Military and food <b>stores</b> <b>of</b> all kinds were in short supply and the governor, General Jean Augustin Ernouf was unable to maintain garrisons around the island's extensive perimeter.|$|E
