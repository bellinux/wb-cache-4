50|$|Porosity gives {{a measure}} of the water storage {{capability}} of soil but not all the water present in the soil pores is available for extraction by pumping for the use of humans or draining by gravity. The pores in the soil hold back sufficient quantity of water on account of forces like surface tension and molecular attraction. Hence the actual amount of water that can be extracted from the unit volume of aquifer by pumping or under the action of gravity is called as specific yield. The fraction of water held back in the aquifer is known as <b>specific</b> <b>retention.</b> Thus {{it can be said that}} porosity is the sum of specific yield and <b>specific</b> <b>retention.</b> Specific yield of soils differ from each other in the sense that some soil types have strong molecular attraction with the water held in their pores while others have less. It is found experimentally that cohessionless soils have high specific yield than cohesive soils because the former has significantly less molecular attraction then the latter. Coarse-grained soils or rocks such as coarse sandstone can have specific yields that are closer to their actual porosity in the range 20 to 35%. The case of fine grained materials is quite opposite to that range.|$|E

40|$|Unequivocal {{evidence}} of the viral nature of virus-like particles observed at the <b>specific</b> site of <b>retention</b> of tobacco rattle virus (TRV) in Paratrichodorus and Trichodorus nematodes has not previously been available. A new staining technique using safranin-O, which does not affect viral antigenicity, was used with an antiserum raised against the coat protein of TRV and prepared for use with immunogold labelling. Application of this method enabled the occurrence and localization of particles of TRV to be confirmed in the pharynx of the natural vector of the virus, Paratrichodorus anemones, and provided unequivocal evidence that the particles observed were TRV particles. The TRV particles were observed attached only to the cuticle lining the posterior tract of the pharyngeal lumen of the vector.

40|$|Building {{wetlands}} {{in small}} arable streams {{is a popular}} supplement to best management practice on arable fields. Particle bound phosphorus settle in the small constructed wetlands (CWs), receiving agricultural diffuse pollution. The sorption behavior of phosphorus is, however, redox-sensitive, and bound phosphorus may be remobilized in periods with low redox potential. This paper investigates changes in the redox potential in the free water of wetland Berg (Norway) during a three-year period, and how these redox changes affects the total phosphorus (TP) and total reactive phosphorus (TRP) retention. Despite eutrophic conditions in the wetland, the redox potential was never negative, and usually higher than 400 mV, indicating aerobic conditions. The relative retention was 44 % and 43 % for TP and TRP, respectively. The <b>specific</b> <b>retention</b> was 100 g TP and 43 g TRP m- 2 yr- 1. Loss of phosphorus was only observed during less than 19 % of the total period of time.

40|$|Numerous {{pathogens}} of humans, animals, {{and plants}} are transmitted by specific arthropod vectors. However, understanding the mechanisms governing these pathogen–vector interactions is hampered, in part, {{by the lack}} of easy-to-use analytical tools. We investigated whitefly transmission of Lettuce infectious yellows virus (LIYV) by using a unique immunofluorescent localization approach in which we fed virions or recombinant virus capsid components to whiteflies, followed by feeding them antibodies to the virions or capsid components, respectively. Fluorescent signals, indicating the retention of virions, were localized in the anterior foregut or cibarium of a whitefly vector biotype but not within those of a whitefly nonvector biotype. Retention of virions in these locations strongly corresponded with the whitefly vector transmission of LIYV. When four recombinant LIYV capsid components were individually fed to whitefly vectors, significantly more whiteflies retained the recombinant minor coat protein (CPm). As demonstrated previously and in the present study, whitefly vectors failed to transmit virions preincubated with anti-CPm antibodies but transmitted virions preincubated with antibodies recognizing the major coat protein (CP). Correspondingly, the number of insects that specifically retained virions preincubated with anti-CPm antibodies were significantly reduced compared with those that specifically retained virions preincubated with anti-CP antibodies. Notably, a transmission-defective CPm mutant was deficient in <b>specific</b> virion <b>retention,</b> whereas the CPm-restored virus showed WT levels of <b>specific</b> virion <b>retention</b> and transmission.
