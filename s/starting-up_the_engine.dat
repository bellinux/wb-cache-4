The report deals with the concept and mathematical model of a system based on the method of time differences. The {{results of the}} development of magneto-resistive pick-ups sensing the position of the rotor and blades are summarized. The principle methods of data evaluation are discussed, which became the basis for the elaboration of programs for data analysis and on-line display of instantaneous information about the vibration of turbine blades.

30|$|The social links {{represent}} the owner’s contacts that allow him/her to obtain resources and know-how. Weak links {{represent the}} owner’s contacts with clients and suppliers and are essential {{during the three}} stages. These results were observed during studies conducted by Duchesneau and Gartner (1990) and Vale and Guimarães (2010). The strong links, representing contacts with friends and relatives are more important during <b>the</b> decision of <b>starting-up</b> <b>the</b> business than during the performance after operations begun (Vale and De O Guimarães 2010). Thus, weak links are {{more important for the}} small business’ survival than strong links are, although the family also helps providing some capital in the business’ start-up. The social links inside and outside the company are important for developing the managerial abilities that will provide competitive advantage (Helfat and Peteraf 2003).|$|R
40|$|The {{fulfilling}} of {{the safety}} reguirements for a vessel-coolingsystem of a HTR cast-steel vessel leads to the application of an even-even-plate-type of cooling-system, which is block-independent and therewith, in principle, exchangeable. From the consideration of thermal accidents, the results obtained show that due to the fall-out of a cooling-disk, no damages {{are to be expected}} to the vessel, because of increased temperatures. For larger breakdowns, the time interval is sufficient for countermeasures to be taken. The dimensions of the cooling System of the control rods are such that for a fall-out of the top-cooling, too, a safe reactor Operation, and therefore also <b>the</b> <b>starting-up</b> of <b>the</b> reactor, remains possible at any time...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{life-cycle}} profiles of small firms’ cost {{and use of}} credit using a panel of Finnish firms. The choice of method matters for the conclusions drawn {{about the relationship between}} firm age and financing costs; the cross-sectional age profiles of financing costs are hump-shaped and consistent with hold-up theories, whereas methods that control for cohort fixed effects demonstrate that the financing costs decrease monotonically as the firms mature. The life-cycle profiles of the use of credit also indicate that firms are more dependent on financial intermediaries in the early periods of their lives. Furthermore, the cohorts born during recessions pay higher financing costs and use smaller amounts of bank loans, even after their creditworthiness is controlled for. The recession cohort effect appears to be more related to <b>the</b> experience of <b>starting-up</b> <b>the</b> firm in the recession than to the CEOs growing up in a recession during their early adulthood...|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>engine</b> thrust acts along <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> centreline. <b>The</b> {{aircraft}} [...] "holds" [...] <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> on <b>the</b> {{outer casing}} of <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> at {{some distance from}} <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> centreline (at <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> mounts). This arrangement causes <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> casing to bend (known as backbone bending) and the round rotor casings to distort (ovalization). Distortion of <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> structure has to be controlled with suitable mount locations to maintain acceptable rotor and seal clearances and prevent rubbing. A well-publicized example of excessive structural deformation occurred with the original Pratt & Whitney JT9D <b>engine</b> installation in <b>the</b> Boeing 747 aircraft. <b>The</b> <b>engine</b> mounting arrangement had to be revised {{with the addition of}} an extra thrust frame to reduce the casing deflections to an acceptable amount.|$|R
50|$|The YF120's {{variable}} cycle {{system worked}} by varying the bypass ratio of <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> for different flight regimes, allowing <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> {{to act like}} either a low bypass turbofan or nearly a turbojet. As a low bypass turbofan (like competitor F119), <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> performed similarly to comparable engines. When needed, however, <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> could direct more airflow through the hot core of <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> (like a turbojet), increasing the specific thrust of <b>the</b> <b>engine.</b> This made <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> more efficient at high altitude, high thrust levels than a traditional low bypass turbofan.|$|R

40|$|Various {{types of}} faults of <b>the</b> {{gasoline}} <b>engine</b> {{may result in}} similar symptoms. Sound analysis of engine has been conducted to diagnose <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> faults. This study presents a study of sound analysis of <b>the</b> normal <b>engine</b> and <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> with three different fault conditions. <b>The</b> gasoline <b>engine</b> was our target of this study. <b>The</b> <b>engine</b> sound has been recorded by using a microphone at <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> room for three directions. Three conditions of <b>engine</b> faults including <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> that is not smooth while idling, <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> that goes missing while idling and <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> that has no power are simulated. In the signal processing of the sound, we use five signal features including fundamental frequency, long term spectrum, energy, long term cestrum and zero crossing rate. Thereafter, the important differences between normal <b>engine</b> and <b>the</b> fault <b>engines</b> are concluded.

50|$|In {{some cases}} in jet <b>engines</b> <b>the</b> {{conditions}} in <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> due to airflow entering <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> or other variations {{can cause the}} compressor blades to stall. When this occurs the pressure in <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> blows out past the blades, and the stall is maintained until the pressure has decreased, and <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> has lost all thrust. The compressor blades will then usually come out of stall, and re-pressurize <b>the</b> <b>engine.</b> If conditions are not corrected, the cycle will usually repeat. This is called surge. Depending on <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> this can be highly damaging to <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> and creates worrying vibrations for the crew.|$|R

50|$|If a {{cylinder}} fills with liquid while <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> is turned off, <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> will refuse to turn when a starting cycle is attempted. Since the starter mechanism's torque is normally {{much lower than}} <b>the</b> <b>engine's</b> operating torque and momentum this will usually not damage <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> but may burn out <b>the</b> starter. <b>The</b> <b>engine</b> can be drained as above and restarted.

50|$|Combustion {{generates a}} great deal of heat, and some of this {{transfers}} to the walls of <b>the</b> <b>engine.</b> Failure will occur if the body of <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> is allowed to reach too high a temperature; either <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> will physically fail, or any lubricants used will degrade {{to the point that they}} no longer protect <b>the</b> <b>engine.</b> <b>The</b> lubricants must be clean as dirty lubricants may lead to over formation of sludge in <b>the</b> <b>engines.</b>|$|R
50|$|The path of ions and {{electrons}} through <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> approximates lines {{parallel to}} <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> walls; however, <b>the</b> particles actually orbit those lines while traveling linearly through <b>the</b> <b>engine.</b> <b>The</b> final, diverging, section of <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> contains an expanding magnetic field {{that drives the}} ions and electrons in steadily expanding spirals and ejects them from <b>the</b> <b>engine,</b> parallel and opposite to the direction of motion at velocities as great as 50,000 m/s.|$|R

50|$|In a turbofan, <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> {{is started}} when {{compressed}} air is blown through its high-pressure stages.

In both cases, <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> must be already spinning before igniting the fuel, so as to have the compressors attain enough speed to draw air and make it flow though <b>the</b> <b>engine.</b> When there is a sufficient amount of air flowing, the fuel is injected, and then <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> {{will be able to}} run by itself.|$|R
