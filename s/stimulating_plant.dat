50|$|The Greening of Planet Earth is a half-hour-long video {{produced}} by the coal industry, which argues that rising CO2 levels will be beneficial to agriculture, and that policies intending to reduce CO2 levels are therefore misguided.

It was produced in 1991 and released the following year. A sequel, entitled, The Greening of Planet Earth Continues, was released in 1998. The video was narrated by Sherwood Idso. After the video was made, it was distributed to thousands of journalists by a coal industry group. The video became very popular viewing in the George H. W.

50|$|Microbial {{inoculants}} are {{addition of}} microbes into {{a plant that}} would essentially help the plant grow by introducing nutrients, and <b>stimulating</b> <b>plant</b> growth. The preparation in mass quantities of any inoculum is performed by a process called fermentation. The first step to making it is by selecting a microbial strain, and letting it grow and increase in bacterial concentration. The greater the bacterial concentration the greater the fermentation yield would be (fermentation yield is ratio of bacterial concentration to mass of substrate) The bacterial concentration can be measured by monitoring the turbidity, wet or dry weight, or residual nutrient concentration. After the inoculant is ready then it gets transferred in a fermentor where oxygen and temperature most be highly monitored {{for the survival of}} the microbes and it can vary depending on the microbe that is being used. After enough time has passed for the microbes to be properly incubated the product is ready to be extracted purified and packaged.|$|E

5000|$|A Bio {{fertilizer}} (also bio-fertilizer) is {{a substance}} which contains living microorganisms which, {{when applied to}} seeds, plant surfaces, or soil, colonize the rhizosphere or {{the interior of the}} plant and promotes growth by increasing the supply or availability of primary nutrients to the host plant.Bio-fertilizers add nutrients through the natural processes of nitrogen fixation, solubilizing phosphorus, and <b>stimulating</b> <b>plant</b> growth through the synthesis of growth-promoting substances. Bio-fertilizers can be expected to reduce the use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides. The microorganisms in bio-fertilizers restore the soils natural nutrient cycle and build soil organic matter. Through the use of bio-fertilizers, healthy plants can be grown, while enhancing the sustainability and the health of the soil. Since they play several roles, a preferred scientific term for such beneficial bacteria is [...] "plant-growth promoting rhizobacteria" [...] (PGPR). Therefore, they are extremely advantageous in enriching soil fertility and fulfilling plant nutrient requirements by supplying the organic nutrients through microorganism and their byproducts. Hence, bio-fertilizers do not contain any chemicals which are harmful to the living soil.|$|E

Applications of the biostimulator Goteo produced comparable or slightly weaker effects compared to the treatments with IBA. Goteo stimulated elongation in new growth of cuttings when applied in watering or two-fold spraying methods. Application of the biostimulator resulted in increased levels of chlorophyll, soluble sugars and indole derivatives, while the contents of free amino acids and polyphenolic acids decreased. The above results indicate that, if necessary, Goteo may replace the synthetic auxin IBA in the propagation of ninebark in the future...|$|E

To assess the infl uence of fertilization and clipping on PAH dissipation in a nutrient-poor, aged PAH-contaminated soil, a 14 -mo phytoremediation study was conducted using perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne) as a model species. Six soil treatments were performed in replicate: unplanted; unplanted and fertilized; planted; planted and fertilized; planted and clipped; and planted, clipped, and fertilized. Plant growth, soil PAH concentrations, and the concentrations of total and PAH-degrading microorganisms were measured after 7 and 14 mo. Overall, planting (with nearly 80 % reduction in total PAHs) and planting + clipping (76 % reduction in total PAHs) were the most eff ective treatments for increased PAH dissipation after 14 mo. Fertilization greatly <b>stimulated</b> <b>plant</b> and total microbial growth, but negatively aff ected PAH dissipation (29 % reduction in total PAHs). Furthermore, unplanted and fertilized soils revealed a similar negative impact (25 % reduction) on PAH dissipation after 14 mo.

40|$|The role of {{earthworms}} {{as one of}} {{the most}} important groups of ecosystem engineers in human-modified and natural environments has been increasingly recognized only during the last 30 years, yet earthworms and humans have been acting together in building landscapes for millennia. This relationship is well represented in the pre-Columbian raised fields, in flood-prone savannas around the rim of Amazonia, but also by the potentially significant role of earthworms in the formation and resilience of Amazonian Dark Earths. Through the bioturbating action of earthworms, soil is biologically, chemically, and physically altered; nutrients are translocated; organic matter is decomposed and transformed; and the surrounding biota interacts as a large orchestra where the soil musicians play together on the various instruments but where earthworms take a leading role, enhancing microbial activity and generally <b>stimulating</b> <b>plant</b> growth.

40|$|Rhizobacteria {{are capable}} of <b>stimulating</b> <b>plant</b> growth {{through a variety of}} {{mechanisms}} that include improvement of plant nutrition, production and regulation of phytohormones, and suppression of disease causing organisms. While considerable research has demonstrated their potential utility, the successful application of plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) in the field has been limited by a lack of knowledge of ecological factors that determine their survival and activity in the plant rhizosphere. To be effective, PGPR must maintain a critical population density of active cells. Inoculation with PGPR strains can temporarily enhance the population size, but inoculants often have poor survival and compete with indigenous bacteria for available growth substrates. PGPR often have more than one mechanism for enhancing plant growth and experimental evidence suggests that the plant growth stimulation is the net result of multiple mechanisms of action that may be activated simultaneously. The aim of this review is to describe PGPR modes of action and discuss practical considerations for PGPR use in agriculture...|$|E
