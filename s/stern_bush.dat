40|$|The most {{sensitive}} {{component in the}} propulsion shafting system is the aft stern tube bearing, which is exposed to heavy static and dynamic propeller loads exerted to the bearing surface by the propeller shaft. The Faculty of Mechanical Engineering and Naval Architecture, University of Zagreb, and the American Bureau of Shipping intend {{to work on the}} development of the theoretical model of the stern tube journal bearing behaviour, which is proposed to be done in several stages. The initial stage is to consider nonlinear fl uid structural interaction, and this is the theory shown in this article. Owing to the fact that the shaft journal in operation lies on a lubricating fl uid fi lm, which separates the journal in the bearing from the bearing liner, the theoretical nonlinear model of the journal bearing may provide more insight in the behaviour of the shaft inside the bearing and help us to determine a more realistic elastic line of the shafting. The American Bureau of Shipping (ABS) initiated a research project to measure actual interaction between the shaft and the stern tube bearing with the goal of applying obtained knowledge in development of an accurate analytical/numerical model for shaftbearing analysis. The initial focus of the investigation was to capture the transient operation of the shaft inside the bearing and to observe the shaftâ€™s hydrodynamic lift during starting, stopping and reversing of the engine. Proximity probes were used to monitor the shaft bearing interaction with micron precision. The installed probes measure the distance between the shaft and the bearing at eight locations inside the aft <b>stern</b> <b>bush</b> and at four locations inside the forward <b>stern</b> <b>bush,</b> and utilize obtained data to defi ne the shaft orbit and dynamics as it revolves in the bearing. The results of presented measurements show that the shaft behaviour inside the <b>stern</b> <b>bush</b> is very different depending on the locati inside the bush. Therefore, an analytical approach, which uses a simplifi ed theory of shaft bearing interaction, provides no practical value since it neglects shaft dynamics and interaction between fl uid and the structure...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1990 The {{purpose of}} the present study was to test the selfconcept and store image {{congruency}} theory with an elderly population. The self-concept and store image congruency theory predicts that individuals patronize stores that they perceive as having an image similar to their own self-concept (Martineau, 1958). The present study specifically investigated the congruency between self-concept and the store image components of merchandise assortment (sizes and styles offered), fashion image and sales service (degree of courtesy, efficiency and knowledge of clothing). The present study examined whether congruency between self-concept and store image was related to the respondents' store patronage behavior. A sample of 70 individuals was obtained from the Salem Senior Center, an activity center for individuals older than 55 years of age. The Salem Senior Center is located in Salem, Oregon. Respondents completed a self-administered questionnaire. The statistical procedures used to analyze the data included descriptive statistics, Pearson-Product Moment correlations, and one-way analyses of variance (ANOVAs). As hypothesized, a positive relationship did exist between the sample's perceived clothing needs regarding clothing fit and the merchandise assortment regarding styles and size range offered at the patronized store. The respondents indicated that they patronized stores which had styles and size ranges which accommodate their perceived clothing needs. The respondents also indicated that they patronized stores that had salespeople with similar degrees of courtesy, efficiency and knowledge of clothing as the respondent. Contrary to prediction, no relationship existed between the respondent's fashion image of self and the fashion image of the store he/she patronized. The elderly in the present sample did not patronize stores which had a fashion image similar to the fashion image the respondent had of himself/herself. This finding may be related to the fact that the respondents held a low fashion image of themselves. They were not very interested in keeping up with the current fashions. Self-concept and store image variables were investigated by the demographic variables of age and income. The present sample of elderly were found to be homogeneous. No significant differences were found in their self-concept or store image by age or income. Additional analyses tested for significant differences in self-concept and store image variables by store type patronized. Again, the sample was found to be homogeneous. Regardless of store type patronized for apparel (department store, specialty store or discount store), all respondents had similar self-concepts and store images. The results of the present study partially support the findings of previous researchers (Dornoff & Tatham, 1972; Grubb & Grathwohl, 1967; Mason & Mayer, 1970; <b>Stern,</b> <b>Bush</b> & Hair, 1977). These previously cited researchers have all found evidence that consumers patronize stores that have images similar to their own self-concept...|$|E
50|$|Because of its {{inherent}} hardness {{and high}} density, Magkono {{has long been}} recognized {{as a substitute for}} the world-famous Lignum vitae (Guaicum officinale L.). Magkono is an excellent material for the bearing or <b>stern</b> <b>bushing</b> of a steamship's propeller shaft. Its other uses are as rollers, shears, saw guide blocks, tool handles, novelties, poles and piles for wharves and bridges, and posts for houses.|$|R
