5|$|Central to this discussion, it was {{announced}} in 2009, that the radius of Betelgeuse had shrunk from 1993 to 2009 by 15%, with the 2008 angular measurement equal to 47.0mas, {{not too far from}} Perrin's estimate. Unlike most earlier papers, this study encompassed a 15-year period at one specific wavelength. Earlier studies have typically lasted one to two years by comparison and have explored multiple wavelengths, often yielding vastly different results. The diminution in Betelgeuse's apparent size equates to a range of values between 56.0±0.1mas seen in 1993 to 47.0±0.1mas seen in 2008—a contraction of almost 0.9AU in 15years. What is not fully known is whether this observation is evidence of a rhythmic expansion and contraction of the star's photosphere as astronomers have theorized, and if <b>so,</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> periodic cycle might be, although Townes suggested that if a cycle does exist, it is probably a few decades long. Other possible explanations are photospheric protrusions due to convection or a star that is not spherical but asymmetric causing the appearance of expansion and contraction as the star rotates on its axis.|$|E

Like you talk about Northern Ireland, 'Sunday Bloody Sunday,' people sort of think, 'Oh, that time when 13 Catholics were shot by British soldiers'; that's not what the song is about. That's an incident, the most famous incident in Northern Ireland and it's the strongest way of saying, 'How long? How long {{do we have to}} put up with this?' I don't care who's who – Catholics, Protestants, whatever. You know people are dying every single day through bitterness and hate, and we're saying why? What's the point? And you can move that into places like El Salvador and other similar situations – people dying. Let's forget the politics, let's stop shooting each other and sit around the table and talk about it... There are a lot of bands taking sides saying politics is crap, etc. Well, <b>so</b> <b>what!</b> <b>The</b> real battle is people dying, that's the real battle." ...|$|E
500|$|Many reviewers {{took note}} of the rather overt {{religious}} symbolism in Simon's lyrics; one Irish blogger facetiously called So Beautiful or <b>So</b> <b>What</b> <b>the</b> year's best Christian music album, while American evangelical journalist Cathleen Falsani {{said it was the}} most significant record of spiritually reflective music in recent years. Writing for MSN Music, Robert Christgau found Simon's usual folk rock [...] "graced with global colors that sound as natural" [...] as his guitar and said his lyrics are imbued with gratitude for his wife's love and God, although he disagreed with Simon's view of God's benevolent nature. Andy Gill from The Independent was more critical and found Simon's ruminations on love, age, and mortality trivial, while Pitchfork Media critic Stephen M. Deusner said the record [...] "can be stodgy in its emotions and a bit too devoted to its motifs". At the end of 2011, So Beautiful or So What was voted the 14th best album of the year in The Village Voices Pazz & Jop, an annual poll of American critics nationwide. Christgau, the poll's creator, ranked it 3rd on his year-end list for The Barnes & Noble Review. Rolling Stone also named it the year's 3rd best record, while Mojo ranked it 15th.|$|E

2500|$|The literal {{meaning of}} the term [...] "schizoid" [...] is [...] "split type". In line with this, the schizoid {{character}} has the tendency to cleave the unitary functioning of the personality. This means that thinking tends to be dissociated from feeling. <b>So</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> schizoid thinks seems to have little apparent connection with how he feels or behaves.

2500|$|On 10 June, {{the auditor}} sent out {{letters to the}} Liverpool councillors {{reporting}} that the council's failure to set a rate that financial year had already caused a loss of £106,103, and notifying them of an extraordinary audit under section 20 of the Local Government Finance Act 1982. According to council deputy leader Derek Hatton, the letters {{had the effect of}} prolonging the dispute: [...] "According to McMahon's assessment of the situation, we had already broken the law. <b>So</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> hell had we to lose by doing it again?" [...] Their continued defiance took the form of a deficit budget involving a 9% rise in rates, which was to produce £236m, but [...] also approving £265m of spending. The budget was approved by 49 to 42 on 14 June, with five Labour councillors opposed. The council leadership saw the deficit budget as a tactic to comply with the law in one sense and so buy time.|$|E
2500|$|On 18 September 1942, Pius XII {{received}} a letter from Monsignor Montini (future Pope Paul VI), saying, [...] "the massacres of the Jews reach frightening proportions and forms." [...] Later that month, Myron Taylor, U.S. representative to the Vatican, warned Pius that the Vatican's [...] "moral prestige" [...] was being injured by silence on European atrocities, a warning which was echoed simultaneously by representatives from the United Kingdom, Brazil, Uruguay, Belgium, and Poland. Myron C. Taylor passed a US Government memorandum to Pius on 26 September 1942, outlining intelligence received from the Jewish Agency for Palestine which said that Jews from across the Nazi Empire were being systematically [...] "butchered". Taylor asked if the Vatican might have any information which might [...] "tend to confirm the reports", and if <b>so,</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> Pope {{might be able to do}} to influence public opinion against the [...] "barbarities". Cardinal Maglione handed Harold Tittmann a response to the letter on 10 October. The note thanked Washington for passing on the intelligence, and confirmed that reports of severe measures against the Jews had reached the Vatican from other sources, though it had not been possible to [...] "verify their accuracy". Nevertheless, [...] "every opportunity is being taken by the Holy See, however, to mitigate the suffering of these unfortunate people". In December 1942, when Tittmann asked Cardinal Secretary of State Maglione if Pius would issue a proclamation similar to the Allied declaration [...] "German Policy of Extermination of the Jewish Race", Maglione replied that the Vatican was [...] "unable to denounce publicly particular atrocities." [...] Pius XII directly explained to Tittman that he could not name the Nazis without at the same time mentioning the Bolsheviks.|$|E

60|$|This {{is one of}} {{the short}} but {{interesting}} books that Ballantyne wrote with the less well-off members of his readership in mind. All of these were of about 120 pages, and quite small books, that could be sold for only a shilling or two. The hero of many of them is a character called Will Osten, or Wandering Will. In this book he returns from a long trip away, during which his father had died, so his mother was very pleased to see him. But just before he died his father had been left a property in California--it was the time of the Gold Rush.

60|$|Next day {{the soldier}} {{was on the}} {{look-out}} at the same hour, and was rewarded {{by the appearance of}} two eyes, very mischievous and dangerous ones too, which were set in a buxom and by no means unprepossessing face. The lady who owned these charms looked very deliberately up the street, and very deliberately down the street, after which she bethought herself to look across the street, and started to perceive a stout, middle-aged gentleman, with a fiery face, who was looking at her with an expression of intense admiration. So much alarmed was she that she vanished behind the curtains and the major feared that he would see her no more. Fortunately, however, it became evident that the lady's alarm was not very overpowering, for within five minutes she was back at the window, where her eyes again fell upon the beaming face and jaunty figure of the major, who had posed himself in a striking attitude, which was somewhat marred {{by the fact that he}} was still enveloped in his purple dressing-gown. This time her eyes lingered a little longer than before and the suspicion of a smile appeared upon her features. On this the major smiled and bowed, and she smiled also, showing a pretty little line of white teeth as she did <b>so.</b> <b>What</b> <b>the</b> veteran's next move might have been no one can tell, for the lady solved the problem by disappearing, and this time permanently. He was very well satisfied, however, and chuckled much to himself while arraying himself in his long frock coat and immaculate collar before setting out for the club. He had been a sly old dog in his day, and had followed Venus almost as much as he had Mars during his chequered career.|$|E
6000|$|The {{exceedingly}} close resemblance {{attributed to}} twins {{has been the}} subject of many novels and plays, and most persons have felt a desire to know upon what basis of truth those works of fiction may rest. But twins have a special claim upon our attention; it is, that their history affords means of distinguishing between the effects of tendencies received at birth, and of those that were imposed by the special circumstances of their after lives. The objection to statistical evidence in proof of the inheritance of peculiar faculties has always been: [...] "The persons whom you compare may have lived under similar social conditions and have had similar advantages of education, but such prominent conditions are only a small part of those that determine the future of each man's life. It is to trifling accidental circumstances that the bent of his disposition and his success are mainly due, and these you leave wholly out of account--in fact, they do not admit of being tabulated, and therefore your statistics, however plausible at first sight, are really of very little use." [...] No method of inquiry which I had previously been able to carry out--and I have tried many methods--is wholly free from this objection. I have therefore attacked the problem from the opposite side, seeking for some new method by which it would be possible to weigh in just scales the effects of Nature and Nurture, and to ascertain their respective shares in framing the disposition and intellectual ability of men. The life-history of twins supplies what I wanted. We may begin by inquiring about twins who were closely alike in boyhood and youth, and who were educated together for many years, and learn whether they subsequently grew unlike, and, if <b>so,</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> main causes were which, in the opinion of the family, produced the dissimilarity. In this way we can obtain direct evidence of the kind we want. Again, we may obtain yet more valuable evidence by a converse method. We can inquire into the history of twins who were exceedingly unlike in childhood, and learn how far their characters became assimilated under the influence of identical nurture, inasmuch as they had the same home, the same teachers, the same associates, and in every other respect the same surroundings.|$|E
