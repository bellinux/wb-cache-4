50|$|In 1992, Petr and Janoschak {{won their}} {{national}} title and {{were selected for}} the 1992 Winter Olympics. During a practice session on February 10, Petr's right skate hit her left calf, requiring 22 <b>stitches.</b> They <b>finished</b> 12th at the Olympics. At the 1992 World Championships, they placed 12th.|$|R
50|$|Before {{the advent}} of {{computer}} technology, patches were made by hand. The general process, however, remains the same today. First, a fabric backing is cut to shape. To prevent fraying, {{the edges of the}} backing are heat-sealed. Then, the thread is stitched into place. Some designs incorporate the backing as the background of the patch, while others completely cover the backing with <b>stitches.</b> To <b>finish</b> the patch, iron-on adhesive may be applied to the reverse—a step that was not originally done.|$|R
50|$|Overcast {{stitches}} may be reversible, as {{when they}} are used to join together crochet block pieces of afghan blankets. There are several different kinds of overcast stitches. A straight overcast stitch is used for finishing edges in eyelets and cutwork fabric. A blanket <b>stitch,</b> used to <b>finish</b> edges of wool blankets, is another common overcast stitch.|$|R
5000|$|The blanket stitch is {{a stitch}} used to {{reinforce}} the edge of thick materials. Depending on circumstances, {{it may also be}} called a [...] "cable stitch" [...] or a [...] "crochet stitch". It is defined as [...] "A decorative <b>stitch</b> used to <b>finish</b> an unhemmed blanket. The stitch can be seen {{on both sides of the}} blanket." ...|$|R
50|$|Miller, a forward, was {{recruited}} to South Melbourne from Wagga Wagga and {{began his career}} in the 1970 VFL season, under coach Norm Smith. On debut against Collingwood in round 11, Miller went off injured in the first quarter with a gashed knee, which required 23 <b>stitches.</b> He <b>finished</b> the season with six appearances. In 1971 he played 12 games, including a hoodoo breaking win over Essendon at Windy Hill, in which he contributed a career best five goals. It was the first time South Melbourne had beaten Essendon at their home ground since 1954. He played one further season for South Melbourne, with 10 appearances in 1972.|$|R
5000|$|The {{guernsey}} {{came into}} being as a garment for fishermen who required a warm, hard wearing, yet comfortable item of clothing that would resist the sea spray. The hard twist given to the tightly packed wool fibres in the spinning process and the tightly knitted <b>stitches,</b> produced a <b>finish</b> that would [...] "turn water" [...] and is capable of repelling rain and spray.|$|R
50|$|At the 2011 Tour de France Hoogerland won the Mountain {{jersey in}} the 6th stage. After losing {{it in the}} 8th stage, Hoogerland managed to {{recapture}} it in the 9th stage. In that same stage, he was then involved in a dramatic crash after a fellow breakaway rider, Team Sky's Juan Antonio Flecha, was sideswiped by a France Télévisions car, causing Hoogerland to crash into a barbed wire fence. Despite deep cuts to his legs, requiring 33 <b>stitches,</b> Hoogerland <b>finished</b> the stage, losing nearly 17 minutes {{as a result of}} the crash. Flecha and Hoogerland were jointly awarded the Combativity award for the day. In November 2014 Hoogerland announced that he had reached a compensation agreement with insurance company AIG over the incident.|$|R
50|$|Textiles {{are often}} dyed, with fabrics {{available}} {{in almost every}} colour. The dyeing process often requires several dozen gallons of water for each pound of clothing. Coloured designs in textiles can be created by weaving together fibres of different colours (tartan or Uzbek Ikat), adding coloured <b>stitches</b> to <b>finished</b> fabric (embroidery), creating patterns by resist dyeing methods, tying off areas of cloth and dyeing the rest (tie-dyeing), or drawing wax designs on cloth and dyeing in between them (batik), or using various printing processes on finished fabric. Woodblock printing, still used in India and elsewhere today, is the oldest of these dating back to at least 220 CE in China. Textiles are also sometimes bleached, making the textile pale or white.|$|R
5000|$|Buttonhole {{stitches}} catch a loop of {{the thread}} {{on the surface}} of the fabric and needle is returned to the back of the fabric at a right angle to the original start of the thread. The <b>finished</b> <b>stitch</b> in some ways resembles a letter [...] "L" [...] depending on the spacing of the stitches. For buttonholes the stitches are tightly packed together and for blanket edges they are more spaced out. The properties of this stitch make it ideal for preventing raveling of woven fabric.|$|R
5000|$|During the night, Satan {{makes his}} initial {{appearance}} at the Cole place, killing Duncan, causing Sam's mule to run away, and badly injuring the family's dog [...] The next morning, {{while waiting for the}} doctor to <b>finish</b> <b>stitching</b> up the dog, Jim and May go to the general store for coffee. Unfortunately, the Curry boys are also there with cohorts and start harassing Jim. They eventually get into a fight, with the Curry sons driven out. Jed arrives and chastises his sons, telling them not to antagonize Jim any more if they are to get his ranch.|$|R
25|$|The Pockets: {{the pockets}} of a Neapolitan jackets are curved and applied as patches; the breast pocket is called “a barchetta”, which means “little boat”, due to the higher top corner of the pocket, which, along with the rounded bottom, gives it {{the shape of a}} stylized boat. The side pockets are equally curved, and their shape recalls that of a pot – hence the name “a pignata”. Neither of these {{features}} have any practical functionality, but they are particular to Neapolitan tailoring and they contribute to the sophisticated yet relaxed look of a jacket made in Naples. As an ultimate touch of elegance, double hand <b>finished</b> <b>stitching</b> runs throughout the sides of the patch pockets – a recurring feature in informal Neapolitan tailoring.|$|R
50|$|As El Mariachi wanders {{through the}} streets, he meets the {{kid with the}} guitar. He learns that the kid is being used by his father to mule drugs hidden in his guitar. He angrily confronts the boy, who tells him {{most people in the}} town works for Bucho. El Mariachi returns to Carolina and learns that Bucho paid to build her bookstore as another front for his drug-dealing. Unexpectedly, Bucho pays her a visit, and she hastily hides El Mariachi. She feigns ignorance of the commotion in town, and Bucho leaves. Carolina <b>finishes</b> <b>stitching</b> up El Mariachi's wounds. That evening, Carolina gives El Mariachi a new guitar, he plays for her before they make passionate love. Meanwhile, Bucho realizes that Carolina lied to him.|$|R
5000|$|Buttonhole or blanket {{stitches}} also catch a loop of {{the thread}} {{on the surface}} of the fabric but the principal difference is that the needle does not return to the original hole to pass back to the back of the fabric. In the classic buttonhole stitch, the needle is returned to the back of the fabric at a right angle to the original start of the thread. The <b>finished</b> <b>stitch</b> in some ways resembles a letter [...] "L" [...] depending on the spacing of the stitches. For buttonholes the stitches are tightly packed together and for blanket edges they are more spaced out. The properties of this stitch make it ideal for preventing raveling of woven fabric. This stitch is also the basis for many forms of needle lace. Examples of buttonhole or blanket stitches.|$|R
50|$|There {{are many}} {{interior}} changes that {{were incorporated into}} the new concept. The retro houndstooth-pattern seats of the coupe were replaced with modern leather and orange <b>stitching.</b> The metal <b>finishes,</b> accent panel finishes, and seats are all different colors. The rear seats are 6 in closer together {{to make room for}} the tonneau cover. The clarity of the circular gauges in square frames were improved by making the faces white with black chrome numbers and a red anodized needle. The deep-dish three-spoke steering wheel and four-pack gauge cluster carry over from the coupe concept. Chrome seat-belt buckles are designed to look like the iconic belts buckles in late 1960s GM cars. This reworked interior of the Camaro Convertible Concept is now a very close representation of what will be seen in the production version of the Camaro.|$|R
25|$|One of {{the more}} obvious {{differences}} is that crochet uses one hook while much knitting uses two needles. In most crochet, the artisan usually has only one live stitch on the hook (with the exception being Tunisian crochet), while a knitter keeps an entire row of stitches active simultaneously. Dropped stitches, which can unravel a fabric, rarely interfere with crochet work, due to a second structural difference between knitting and crochet. In knitting, each stitch {{is supported by the}} corresponding stitch in the row above and it supports the corresponding stitch in the row below, whereas crochet stitches are only supported by and support the stitches on either side of it. If a <b>stitch</b> in a <b>finished</b> crocheted item breaks, the stitches above and below remain intact, and because of the complex looping of each stitch, the stitches on either side are unlikely to come loose unless heavily stressed.|$|R
5000|$|Cross-stitch {{is a form}} of sewing and {{a popular}} form of counted-thread {{embroidery}} in which X-shaped stitches in a tiled, raster-like pattern are used to form a picture. The stitcher counts the threads on a piece of evenweave fabric (such as linen) in each direction so that the stitches are of uniform size and appearance. This form of cross-stitch is also called counted cross-stitch in order to distinguish it from other forms of cross-stitch. Sometimes cross-stitch is done on designs printed on the fabric (stamped cross-stitch); the stitcher simply stitches over the printed pattern. Cross-stitch is also executed on easily countable fabric called aida cloth but the threads are not actually counted.Fabrics used in cross-stitch include linen, aida, and mixed-content fabrics called 'evenweave' such as jobelan. All cross stitch fabrics are technically [...] "evenweave" [...] as the term refers {{to the fact that the}} fabric is woven to make sure that there are the same number of threads in an inch both left to right and top to bottom (vertically and horizontally). Fabrics are categorized by threads per inch (referred to as 'count'), which can range from 11 to 40 count. Aida fabric has a lower count because it is made with two threads grouped together for ease of stitching. Cross stitch projects are worked from a gridded pattern and can be used on any count fabric, the count of the fabric determines the size of the <b>finished</b> <b>stitching</b> if the stitchers counts and stitches over 2 threads. The <b>finished</b> <b>stitching</b> size is reduced by half if the stitcher counts and stitches over one fabric thread. These methods are commonly referred to as [...] "2 over 2" [...] - i.e. 2 embroidery threads used to stitch over 2 fabric threads; and [...] "1 over 1" [...] - i.e. 1 embroidery thread used to stitch over 1 fabric thread. There are different methods of stitching a pattern, including the cross-country method where one colour is stitched at a time, or the parking method where one block of fabric is stitched at a time and the end of the thread is [...] "parked" [...] at the next point the same colour occurs in the pattern.|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{there has}} been a {{particular}} interest in wearable electronics for electrocardiogram (ECG) recording. The ultimate goal is the integration of both sensors and electronics in clothes, for both clinical and non-clinical use. To date, textile ECG electrodes have been mainly based on the use of conductive metal fibers woven or <b>stitched</b> on a <b>finished</b> substrate. In this work, textiles electrodes for ECG are obtained by treating finished fabrics with the conductive organic polymer poly- 3, 4 -ethylenedioxythiophene doped with poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS). Compared to previous works based on the treatment of a whole piece of fabric by immersion in the PEDOT:PSS solution, the adoption of a novel screen printing technique enables to achieve good definition and control over the quantity of deposited polymer. The proposed fabrication approach compares favorably with the previous one. A small trial with 10 subjects, aimed to record 12 -lead ECG traces with clinical instrumentation, revealed the capability of the proposed electrodes to accurately capture the ECG signal morphology with performance comparable to off-the-shelf disposable gelled Ag/AgCl electrodes...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{explores the}} importance of sewing skills within HE fashion education. Recent literature has identified significant discussion concerning a graduate skills gap {{at the onset of}} employment. Some industry specialists fear that educators are not doing enough to promote the technical side of fashion. As a consequence, there are concerns of a widening gap in the uptake of technical job roles within the fashion sector. This research investigates potential reasons why students might not make these career choices, focusing mainly on the teaching of construction skills through the development of a resource tool to enhance the curriculum to bridge this recognised gap. To contextualise the development of this project, literature has examined key areas of interest. These include studies relating to skill gaps, manufacture and production techniques as well as the relationship between technical skill and career interests. This research has applied a variety of methodologies, which have explored the skills required for fundamental sewing processes, the value of sewing from educational and industry perspectives and issues relating to the recognised skills gap and career choices. Methods have included object-based study, interviews with manufacturers and a focus group with second year BA (Hons) fashion design students undertaking pattern cutting and manufacture sessions. To evaluate the effectiveness of the resource tool of <b>stitch</b> and garment <b>finishing</b> techniques, questionnaires, observations and examinations were conducted with undergraduate students undertaking sewing sessions. This research has revealed that the resource tool was successful in engaging students with garment construction techniques, and that this was most beneficial when used in conjunction with other methods. During testing it was apparent that students preferred to work more creatively, using inventiveness over memory of previously taught sewing skills when producing samples. Interestingly, the research has also highlighted two distinctions; that further technical knowledge in sewing appears to, in some instances, have limited the creativity of students’ fashion design outcomes when advancing from a foundation to intermediate level of study. However, there is also evidence to suggest that further engagement with sewing had a positive influence on their understanding of garment construction informing feasible design. There appears to be minimal evidence that links strong sewing skill with the ambition to choose careers in the manufacturing sector. The conclusions from this research, including the testing results from the resource tool, support the development of a technical curriculum within the BA curriculum, {{and the development of a}} qualification level prior to BA...|$|R
