5|$|Like New World monkeys, strepsirrhines rely on scent marking {{for much}} of their communication. This {{involves}} <b>smearing</b> secretions from epidermal scent glands on tree branches, along with urine and feces. In some cases, strepsirrhines may anoint themselves with urine (urine washing). Body postures and gestures may be used, although the long snout, non-mobile lips, and reduced facial enervation restrict the use of facial expressions in strepsirrhines. Short-range calls, long-range calls, and alarm calls are also used. Nocturnal species are more constrained {{by the lack of}} light, so their communication systems differ from those of diurnal species, often using long-range calls to claim their territory.|$|E

We conducted this study to assess the diagnostic accuracy of cervical Papanicolaou (Pap) <b>smears</b> for uterine glandular lesions and to compare the diagnostic utility of conventional and liquid-based cytology (LBC) <b>smears</b> for glandular lesions. Materials and Methods: Archived histopathology records of all cases reported as endocervical and endometrial adenocarcinoma in the study period were identified and the available corresponding Pap <b>smears</b> (in preceding 1 year) were retrieved. In addition, the Pap <b>smears</b> reported as glandular cell abnormalities (GCA) during the same study period were retrieved. The overall prevalence of GCA, sensitivity, and specificity of Pap <b>smears</b> for the detection of GCA was calculated. The diagnostic accuracy of conventional and LBC <b>smears</b> for the diagnosis of GCA was also compared. Results: The prevalence of GCA in our study was 0. 32 %. The overall specificity of Pap <b>smears</b> for the diagnosis of GCA was 60. 8 %, this was not significantly different between conventional and LBC <b>smears</b> (P = 0. 4).

Methods: Using three years of Medicare Part B 5 % Files (1995 – 1997), we differentiated between women undergoing screening Pap <b>smears</b> and those undergoing Pap <b>smears</b> for surveillance of previous abnormalities or Pap <b>smear</b> follow-up. We determined the proportion of elderly women under-going Pap <b>smear</b> testing and rates of downstream testing and procedures after an initial Pap <b>smear.</b> Results: Four million female Medicare beneciaries over 65 years underwent Pap <b>smear</b> testing between 1995 and 1997, representing 25 % of the eligible population.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To compare ThinPrep (TP) Papanicolaou <b>smears</b> (Cytyc Corp., Box- borough, Massachusetts, U. S. A.) with {{matching}} conventional Papanicolaou (CP) <b>smears</b> for specimen adequacy, cytologic quality, diagnostic accuracy and screening time. STUDY DESIGN: In this prospective study of 1, 024 women a split-sample, matched-pair design {{in favor of}} CP slides based on single-blind criteria was followed with a <b>smear</b> on a glass slide for CP and the remaining material collected in PreservCyt solution (Cytyc) for a TP <b>smear.</b> A Cytobrush (Medscand, Hollywood, Florida, U. S. A.) was used for <b>smear</b> preparation for CP. TP <b>smears</b> were processed in ThinPrep 2000 (Cytyc). <b>Smears</b> were stained with Papanicolaou stain and were interpreted according to the Bethesda system. RESULTS: The number of satisfactory but limited (SBL) cases with TP were 77 (7. 5 %) as compared to 127 (12. 4 %) with the CP method. This reduction in SBL <b>smears</b> with the TP method and consequent increase in satisfactory <b>smears</b> were highly significant (P<. 001) by McNemar's test. As regards unsatisfactory <b>smears</b> in discordant pairs, {{although the number of}} unsatisfactory <b>smears</b> was higher with TP (41 cases) as against CP (27 cases), the difference was not statistically significant (P<. 05). The split-sample method showed a high correlation between the CP and TP diagnoses. TP <b>smears</b> had a significant advantage over CP <b>smears</b> in the {{reduction in the number of}} ASCUS and AGUS cases (14 vs. 29) (P<. 05) and increased the pickup rate of LSIL, 6 vs. 1. Time taken to screen the TP <b>smears</b> was half that of CP <b>smears.</b> No cases of LSIL or HSIL were missed on TP <b>smears.</b> CONCLUSION: The liquid-based processor significantly improved the adequacy and quality of <b>smears,</b> resulting in fewer recall cases for SBL <b>smears,</b> leading to more definitive diagnoses in atypical cases, increasing the pickup rate of LSILs and reducing the screening time.

Materials and Methods: Guided FNAC was taken from 100 cases of clinically suspected lung tumor and FNAC <b>smears,</b> cytospin <b>smears,</b> and cellblocks of aspirated material were studied over a period of 2 years from September 2011 to September 2013. Results: The material adequacies were 80 % in FNAC <b>smears,</b> 83 % in cytospin <b>smears,</b> and 89 % in cellblocks. Additional information supported by cytospin <b>smear</b> and cellblock was 3 % and 9 %, respectively.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: This study examined, {{with the}} use of {{transmission}} electron microscopy (TEM), the aggressiveness of three self-etching adhesive systems in penetrating dentin <b>smear</b> layers of different thickness. METHODS: Dentin disks were produced from extracted human third molars. For the control group, the middle dentin surface was cryofractured to create a bonding surface that was devoid of a <b>smear</b> layer. The experimental teeth were polished with wet 600 or 60 -grit SiC paper to produce bonding surfaces with thin and thick <b>smear</b> layers. They were bonded using one of the three self-etching systems: Clearfil Mega Bond (Kuraray), Non-Rinse Conditioner and Prime&Bond NT (Dentsply DeTrey) and Prompt L-Pop (ESPE). Bonded specimens were then demineralized and embedded in epoxy resin for TEM examination. RESULTS: For Mega Bond, thin authentic hybrid layers between 0. 4 - 0. 5 microm were found. <b>Smear</b> layer and <b>smear</b> plugs were retained as part of the hybridized complex. For Non-Rinse Conditioner/Prime&Bond NT, the authentic hybrid layers were between 1. 2 - 2. 2 microm thick. <b>Smear</b> layer and <b>smear</b> plugs were completely dissolved in dentin with thin <b>smear</b> layers, but were partially retained as part of the hybridized complex in those with thick <b>smear</b> layers. For Prompt L-Pop, authentic hybrid layers were 2. 5 - 5 microm thick and <b>smear</b> layer and <b>smear</b> plugs were completely dissolved even in dentin with thick <b>smear</b> layers. SIGNIFICANCE: Contemporary self-etching systems may be classified as mild, moderate and aggressive based on their ability to penetrate dentin <b>smear</b> layers and their depth of demineralization into the subsurface dentin. The more aggressive system completely solubilized the <b>smear</b> layer and <b>smear</b> plugs and formed hybrid layers with a thickness approaching those of phosphoric acid conditioned dentin...|$|R

Smarting from Dino's attempts to assert dominance over the proceedings and especially his wife, Lana and Luca sneak off from the party for a dalliance in the garage.

Then Lana picks up a heavy spanner and hits Dino on the head with it. He is stunned by the blow. Lana prevails upon Luca to finish Dino off, and Luca, despite some momentary reluctance, clubs Dino one last time. Dino falls to the ground, apparently dead. Luca and Lana hear someone coming, so they drag Dino's body into his office. Unknown to them, Rita has witnessed the last part of the fight, and she hurries off to call the police. Then Angelo appears, seeking Luca. To Luca and Lana's horror, Dino is not dead – he crawls out of the office and grabs Angelo, seeking help.
