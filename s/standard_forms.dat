The choral arrangement of four voices (soprano, alto, tenor, and bass) has since become common in Western classical music. Homophony began by appearing in sacred music, replacing polyphony and monophony as the dominant form, but spread to secular music, for which {{it is one of the}} <b>standard</b> <b>forms</b> today.|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{dissertation}} is {{to compare}} South African law on <b>standard</b> <b>form</b> contracts against the corresponding German law. Thus, the responses of both legal systems to the special situation occurring in cases of <b>standard</b> <b>form</b> contracts will be compared and evaluated. Thereby, {{the focus of this}} dissertation is to determine whether South African law on <b>standard</b> <b>form</b> contracts provides adequate protection for the submitting party. German law on <b>standard</b> <b>form</b> contracts provides the basis and outline against which South African law will be critically evaluated. German law was selected for this task, as {{it was one of the}} first legal systems, which enacted legislation, and addresses the issue systematically. It should be noted that this dissertation does not aim to evaluate German law on <b>standard</b> <b>form</b> contracts. In the first part of this dissertation I will provide a brief definition of the notion of freedom of contract and consumer protection. I will then proceed to highlight the relevance of <b>standard</b> <b>form</b> contracts in modern society and outline the problems associated with such contracts. This will be followed by a discussion of whether <b>standard</b> <b>form</b> contracts can be considered as classical contracts. In the second part of this dissertation I will outline the law on <b>standard</b> <b>form</b> contracts in both jurisdictions. Concerning the German law, I will give a brief overview of what the relevant provisions state. Concerning South African law, I will briefly illustrate what the relevant common law appears to be without going into far too much depth. Such outlines of the applicable laws are necessary in order to acquaint the reader with some of the important themes that this dissertation will discuss in detail. In part three the actual comparison and evaluation will follow. The comparison will include a detailed illustration of the law on <b>standard</b> <b>form</b> contracts in both jurisdictions. Thereby, some repetition in regard to the applicable law cannot be avoided. Thereafter, the evaluation will more specifically investigate whether South African law is effective in achieving its aims and whether South Africa should introduce legislation on <b>standard</b> <b>form</b> contract terms...|$|R

He wrote it out in fair copy from rough notes, and he also had the loose pages bound into six volumes, catalogued them in his library with all his other books, and is likely to have suspected that eventually someone would find them interesting.|$|E

Wushu was introduced at both the high school and university level. The suppression of traditional teaching was relaxed during the Era of Reconstruction (1976–1989), as Communist ideology became more accommodating to alternative viewpoints. In 1979, the State Commission for Physical Culture and Sports created a special task force to reevaluate the teaching and practice of Wushu.|$|E
25|$|Massey and Denton {{propose that}} the {{fundamental}} cause of poverty among African Americans is segregation. This segregation has created the inner city black urban ghettos that create poverty traps and keep blacks {{from being able to}} escape the underclass. It is sometimes claimed that these neighborhoods have institutionalized an inner city black culture that is negatively stigmatized and purports the economic situation of the black community. Sociolinguist, William Labov argues that persistent segregation supports the use of African American English (AAE) while endangering its speakers. Although AAE is stigmatized, sociolinguists who study it note that it is a legitimate dialect of English as systematic as any other. Arthur Spears argues that there is no inherent educational disadvantage in speaking AAE and that it exists in vernacular and more <b>standard</b> <b>forms.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is rather simple, extracting a new theory of <b>standard</b> <b>form</b> {{contracts}} from the good bits of the spectrum of 2 ̆ 2 old 2 ̆ 2 ideas and combining them with some fresh rethinking. For something fresh, the authors choose to examine the German law on <b>standard</b> <b>form</b> contracts. The authors have tried to remain neutral observers but in extracting the best from the spectrum of ideas one necessarily states [...] in this instance, one of pragmatic compromise. Thus, this article will cull and identify elements from the spectrum specifically concerning <b>standard</b> <b>form</b> contracts and compare them with the German approach. This process is undertaken with a perspicuous and pragmatic eye to formulating a new systematic, comprehensive theory of <b>standard</b> <b>form</b> contracts. Section One of this article commences with some basic assumptions or premises which underlie the subsequent analyses. These assumptions clarify and restrict the scope of this study. For example, no inquiry is made into the existence and importance of <b>standard</b> <b>form</b> contracts or whether they are different from bargained-for contracts. Neither does this article address any need for a different legal treatment of <b>standard</b> <b>form</b> terms. The question is not if there should be a different body of rules for <b>standard</b> <b>form</b> terms, but how the rules should differ.

25|$|Abbreviations {{are written}} in one word whether they are created from single nouns, nouns with derivational suffixes, or compounds, and they are written with a full stop. If an {{abbreviation}} retains {{the ending of the}} original word, the full stop is still preserved (e.g. pság. < parancsnokság ‘headquarters’). Abbreviation of phrases normally contains as many elements as the original phrase contains (e.g. s. k. < saját kezével ‘by his/her own hand’) but there are exceptions (e.g. vö. < vesd össze ‘compare’). Case is usually kept in abbreviations (e.g. Mo. < Magyarország ‘Hungary’) but some abbreviations created from lowercase words use the uppercase (e.g. Ny < nyugat ‘west’).

25|$|Statements were {{collected}} from all the crew. These were all written out for presentation to the inquiry on <b>standard</b> <b>forms</b> in identical handwriting with similar phrasing. Quartermaster Johnston later described that pressure had been placed upon him to be loyal to the company, {{and that it had}} been suggested to him it would help the case if two torpedoes had struck the ship, rather than the one which he described. Giving evidence to the tribunal he was not asked about torpedoes. Other witnesses who claimed that only one torpedo had been involved were refused permission to testify. In contrast to his statement at the inquest, Captain Turner stated that two torpedoes had struck the ship, not one. In an interview in 1933, Turner reverted to his original statement that there had been only one torpedo. Most witnesses said there had been two, but a couple said three, possibly involving a second submarine. Clem Edwards, representing the seamen's union, attempted to introduce evidence about which watertight compartments had been involved but was prevented from doing so by Lord Mersey.|$|E
