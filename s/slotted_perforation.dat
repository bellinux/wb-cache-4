50|$|A tracing wheel, {{also known}} as a pattern wheel, pounce wheel, and dart wheel, is an {{instrument}} with multiple teeth on a wheel attached to a handle. The teeth can be either serrated or smooth. It is used to transfer markings from patterns onto fabric with or without tracing paper, this sewing tool also makes <b>slotted</b> <b>perforations.</b> Such markings might include pleats, darts, buttonholes, notches or placement s for appliques or pockets.|$|R
40|$|The {{benefits}} of using notch, slot and multiple circular perforations in plate fin heat sinks (PFHSs), are investigated numerically, using a conjugate heat transfer model. Comparisons show that {{each type of}} perforation can provide significantly reduced pressure drops over PFHSs but that fins with <b>slot</b> <b>perforations</b> provide the most effective design in terms of heat transfer and pressure drop. The practical {{benefits of}} each type of perforated fin for micro-electronics cooling is also explored and their capabilities of achieving low processor temperatures for reduced mechanical power consumption are quantified...|$|R
5000|$|The {{finalization}} of {{the device}} (prototype) {{in the end of}} 1972 was tasked to the special laboratory of the Research Institute of Oceanology of PSU [...] "Sevmorgeo". From the beginning of the work for the revision the existing device was carried out in two directions: hydro-slotting <b>perforation</b> and hydro-mechanical <b>slotting</b> <b>perforation.</b> The second variant differs from the first in that at the beginning the opening of the casing is produced with a circular saw, and then the rock eroded by working fluid (water and sand) jets. The works were done over three years. The work for improvements of the hydro-mechanical <b>slotting</b> <b>perforation</b> were terminated in the result of their further inexpedient. Firstly, it was not necessary to divide the process into two operations: cutting the casing with the circular saw and a further jet-slotting perforation, because the cutting of casing with jet-slotting perforation takes place in a matter of seconds. Second, the mechanism of the circular saw takes up a lot of space in the housing unit, it was impossible to use the energy of working fluid to full power for getting deep slots, the slots get small and not deep (not enough for occurs the unloading of the annular compressive stress conditions and increase the permeability in the near wellbore zone). The further project was focused for finishing the hydro-slotting perforation device only.|$|R
40|$|Non-uniform {{distribution}} of flow rate along horizontal wells results in early water/gas coning, early breakthrough of water/gas during flooding, etc. For injector wells, injection flow rate profile along the horizontal length leads to low sweep efficiency and to large oil-filled by-passed zones. In the current work, a variable {{distribution of}} flow open area along a horizontal well, {{with or without}} sand control, is proposed, to correct the flow rate profile along it. An uniform flow profile is achieved by means of unevenly spaced <b>slots</b> or <b>perforations</b> along the liner or sand control device. An analytical model was developed for flow inside and around the horizontal well with unevenly spaced <b>slots</b> or <b>perforations</b> along the liner or along the sand control device. The model couples flows in well and in the reservoir in well vicinity. The analytical model provides an explicit formula for slot/hole density along liners or screens in injection/production horizontal wells. Applications of the model to design horizontal well in cases of injection and production, with or without sand control, with inflow control device are discussed. The technology has been successfully applied in some oilfields onshore and offshore Brazil, where horizontal producer wells were equipped with specially perforated and slotted liners. The purpose is to homogenize flow along horizontal producer or injector wells, in order to delay gas and water coning and improve the sweep. The varying slot/perforation density is calculated by the analytical model, and the calculated option was implemented in some wells. P. D. Fernandes and M. G. F. da Silva and P. Bedrikovetsk...|$|R
25|$|The Northrop X-21 was a {{modified}} WB-66D with an experimental wing, designed to conduct laminar flow control studies. Laminar-flow control {{was thought to}} potentially reduce drag {{by as much as}} 25%. Control would be by removal of a small amount of the boundary-layer air by suction through porous materials, multiple narrow surface <b>slots,</b> or small <b>perforations.</b> Northrop began flight research in April 1963 at Edwards Air Force Base, but with all of the problems encountered, and money going into the war, the X-21 would be the last experiment involving this concept.|$|R
40|$|NASA's Aircraft Energy Efficiency (ACEE) program, {{which began}} in 1976, has mounted a {{development}} effort in four major transport aircraft technology fields: laminar flow systems, advanced aerodynamics, flight controls, and composite structures. ACEE has explored two basic methods for achieving drag-reducing boundary layer laminarization: the use of suction through the wing structure (via <b>slots</b> or <b>perforations)</b> to remove boundary layer turbulence, and the encouragement of natural laminar flow maintenance through refined design practices. Wind tunnel tests have been conducted for wide bodied aircraft equipped with high aspect ratio supercritical wings and winglets. Maneuver load control and pitch-active stability augmentation control systems reduce fuel consumption by reducing the drag associated with high aircraft stability margins. Composite structures yield lighter airframes that in turn call for smaller wing and empennage areas, reducing induced drag for a given payload. In combination, all four areas of development are expected to yield a fuel consumption reduction of 40 percent...|$|R
25|$|Laminar-flow {{control is}} a {{technology}} that offers the potential for significant improvement in drag coefficient which would provide improvements in aircraft fuel usage, range or endurance that far exceed any known single aeronautical technology. In principle, if 80 percent of wing is laminar, then overall drag could be reduced by 25 percent. The frictional force between {{the air and the}} aircraft surface, known as viscous drag, is much larger in a turbulent boundary layer than in a laminar one. The principal type of active laminar-flow control is removal of a small amount of the boundary-layer air by suction through porous materials, multiple narrow surface <b>slots,</b> or small <b>perforations</b> (boundary layer suction).|$|R

40|$|The {{current status}} of the laminar-flow control LFC {{technology}} is summarized. Factors that have previously inhibited the application of LFC are first reviewed. Involved are the effects of atmospheric ice crystals, surface irregularities, acoustical environment, and off-design operating conditions. Aircraft design trends that are different from turbulent aircraft are discussed as are various design requirements unique to the LFC systems. Current design approaches for the principal LFC systems are reviewed. These include the system for protection of the leading-edge region from surface contamination and icing and the system for removal of {{a portion of the}} boundary-layer air. The latter includes consideration of both multiple spanwise suction <b>slots</b> and distributed <b>perforations</b> and required differences between the wing-box and leading-edge box regions...|$|R
40|$|Slotted-Wall Tunnels Summary, Part I of {{this report}} {{describes}} {{a study of the}} lift interference effect in slotted-wall wind tunnels performed by a pure resistance electrical analogue. Both steady and oscillatory flow are considered. Special techniques devised to represent the singular behaviour of a point wing and at the edges of each slot are discussed in detail. Comparisons are made with an exact solution based on an equivalent homogeneous boundary condition for steady flow. For oscillatory flow experimental results are presented which show how the magnitude of the interference upwash changes with the frequency of the oscillation. 1. Introduction, Many of the wind tunnels used for both subsonic and transonic investigations have partially open walls consisting either of longitudinal <b>slots</b> or circular <b>perforations.</b> The boundaries of the tunnel influence the flow around the model, and there are several distinct interference effects, such as blockage interference on the stream velocity, lift interference on the model incidence and shock wave reflections from the walls...|$|R
40|$|Many {{techniques}} have been explored {{to reduce the}} overall size of a microstrip patch conductor in the low microwave frequency spectrum. These include using shorting pins and high dielectric constant material. Perforating or meshing the microstrip patch conductor {{has also been shown}} to give reasonable size reductions for a conventional patch antenna without compromising its radiation and impedance performance. We present a perforated shorted printed antenna which uses a shorting post as well as <b>perforation</b> <b>slots</b> that are embedded within the single layer printed antenna to reduce the surface area of the antenna. The antenna is small, with its overall dimensions of 0. 13 ? 0 × 0. 12 ? 0 × 0. 07 ? 0 making its size compatible with most portable devices. We also present a variation of the perforated shorted patch that allows multifrequency operation. This new printed antenna consists of a stacked shorted patch geometry, where the lower frequency element is fed by a probe and the upper frequency radiator is electromagnetically coupled to the feed. The lower frequency radiator is a perforated shorted patch. The upper frequency radiator is located below the other element and is {{in the shape of a}} shorted ring...|$|R
40|$|The {{trends of}} room and {{building}} environment designs valuing acoustical solutions for space and energy saving, {{as well as}} health and environmental friendly sound absorbers are increasing. Transparent/translucent absorbers, such as perforated glass, plastic panel, foil, and honeycomb-structures are merely some suitable choices for these demands. The absorption performance of the micro-perforated (slotted) transparent/translucent material/structure is limited, due to their special characteristics. The vibration of the foil will for example counteract the friction of the air drop with the internal surface of the hole and deteriorates the low frequency absorption performance of the structure. Astutely designed thicker and rigid perforated (slotted) panels will have lower or middle frequency absorptions, but reflects more sound waves at higher frequencies, causing the degrade of absorption coefficient in the high frequency ranges. The affects to the absorption of the parameters of micro <b>perforation</b> (<b>slot)</b> on the "rigid" panel (foil) absorber, like thickness, hole radius, hole distance, air gap depth, has been extensively considered. In this paper the discussion will {{be focused on the}} effects of other phenomenon like the vibration of the panels, the existence {{and the size of the}} grids in the air gap behind the front panel and multi-layered structures. The performance of absorber structures will be optimized. Some applications of transparent/translucent will also be introduced...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} requirements to existing heat-insulation layers in enclosure structures of wall panels has been carried out, a general principles on development of thermal insulation systems, substantiation on the necessity {{to develop a new}} wall panel design with improved thermal characteristics. The proposed design of the wall panel differs from the existing one in the fact that its external layer is made of protective sheets being perforated in their top and bottom parts with perforated aluminum foil layer placed on them. Air layer performs function of one of thermal insulation layers, and the second layer is made up in the form of several micro-modular sub-layers which are divided by perforated aluminum foil and a grid. An inner concrete layer is also separated from micro-modular layers by aluminum foil. Protective sheets and the grid can be made of aluminum or polyethylene. The arrangement of hollow micro-modular cells in the zone of negative temperatures prevents condensate accumulation. The arrangement of the perforated aluminum foil layers between micro- modular layers leads to increase in thermal resistance of the panel due to decrease of a radiant component in presence of several screens and does not interfere with a vapor permeability of thermal insulation layers from micro-modules. At the same time placement of a non-perforated foil layer on an inside panel layer interferes with penetration of water vapor from rooms in micro-modular thermal insulation layers. Technological principles lie in the arrangement of <b>perforation</b> <b>slots</b> in the top and bottom zones of protective sheets that allows to delete excess moisture from thermal insulation layers and air layer and also leads to improvement of thermo-technical characteristics, durability and reliability in construction operation as a whole. The executed calculations of heat and humidity fields in external enclosure structures confirm advantages of the presented technical solution. </p...|$|R
