25|$|Crompton's first mule had 48 {{spindles}} {{and could}} produce 1lb of 60s thread a day. This demanded a <b>spindle</b> <b>speed</b> of 1,700rpm, and a power input of 1/16hp.|$|E
25|$|A counter faller {{under the}} thread {{was made to}} rise {{to take in the}} slack caused by backing off. This could be used with the top faller wire to guide the yarn to the correct place on the cop. These were {{controlled}} by levers and cams and an inclined plane called the shaper. The <b>spindle</b> <b>speed</b> was controlled by a drum and weighted ropes, as the headstock moved the ropes twisted the drum, which using a tooth wheel turned the spindles. None of this would have been possible using the technology of Crompton's time, fifty years earlier.|$|E
50|$|Excessive <b>spindle</b> <b>speed</b> {{will cause}} {{premature}} tool wear, breakages, {{and can cause}} tool chatter, {{all of which can}} lead to potentially dangerous conditions. Using the correct <b>spindle</b> <b>speed</b> for the material and tools will greatly enhance tool life {{and the quality of the}} surface finish.|$|E
50|$|Micro{{drilling}} {{refers to}} the drilling of holes less than 0.5 mm. Drilling of holes at this small diameter presents greater problems since coolant fed drills cannot be used and high <b>spindle</b> <b>speeds</b> are required. High <b>spindle</b> <b>speeds</b> that exceed 10,000 RPM also {{require the use of}} balanced tool holders.|$|R
40|$|The {{need for}} {{miniature}} components in such applications as biomedical, aerospace, electronics, and mold production {{has led to}} the development of micro-milling processes that are characterized by high <b>spindle</b> <b>speeds</b> (up to 500, 000 rpm) and low cutting force magnitudes (< 1 N). Due to these high <b>spindle</b> <b>speeds,</b> the tooth passing frequency, and...|$|R
50|$|Cutting feeds and <b>speeds,</b> and the <b>spindle</b> <b>speeds</b> {{that are}} derived from them, are the ideal cutting {{conditions}} for a tool. If the conditions are less than ideal then adjustments are made to the <b>spindle's</b> <b>speed,</b> this adjustment is usually a reduction in RPM to the closest available speed, or one that is deemed (through knowledge and experience) to be correct.|$|R

50|$|The Seagate Barracuda is {{a series}} of hard disk drives {{produced}} by Seagate Technology. Most of the drives in this series have a <b>spindle</b> <b>speed</b> of 7200 RPM. The line initially focused on high-capacity, high-performance SCSI drives; since 2001, it became Seagate's most popular product as the hard disk drive industry started to move to a 7200 RPM <b>spindle</b> <b>speed.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The paper {{presents}} {{the method of}} the surveillance of the self-excited chatter vibration. At first, the workpiece modal parameters are estimated based on experimental data which leads to verification of computational model. Then, for selected surface points optimal <b>spindle</b> <b>speeds</b> are calculated. By considering sufficient amount of points {{it is possible to}} build a map of optimal <b>spindle</b> <b>speeds.</b> Experimental results show that this map may be used effectively for eliminating chatter in case of the process of ball end milling of a curved flexible detail...|$|R
5000|$|Varieties of {{spindles}} include grinding spindles, electric spindles, {{machine tool}} spindles, low-speed <b>spindles,</b> high <b>speed</b> <b>spindles,</b> and more.|$|R
50|$|Most {{metalworking}} {{books have}} nomograms or tables of <b>spindle</b> <b>speeds</b> and feed rates for different cutters and workpiece materials; similar tables {{are also likely}} available from the manufacturer of the cutter used.|$|R
50|$|Four {{distinct}} {{series of}} Quantum Bigfoot drives were produced over time, with differences in capacity, <b>spindle</b> <b>speed,</b> access time and supported interface speed.|$|E
50|$|The {{ratio of}} the <b>spindle</b> <b>speed</b> and the feed rate {{controls}} how aggressive the cut is, {{and the nature of}} the swarf formed.|$|E
5000|$|SK and HSK tooling, {{sometimes}} called [...] "Hollow Shank Tooling", {{is much more}} common in Europe where it was invented {{than it is in}} the United States. It is claimed that HSK tooling is even better than BT Tooling at high speeds. The holding mechanism for HSK tooling is placed within the (hollow) body of the tool and, as <b>spindle</b> <b>speed</b> increases, it expands, gripping the tool more tightly with increasing <b>spindle</b> <b>speed.</b> There is no pull stud with this type of tooling.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: We have {{analyzed}} {{the variations in}} cutting force during milling of a fiber-reinforced composite material. In particular, we have investigated the multiscale dynamics of the cutting force measured at different <b>spindle</b> <b>speeds</b> using multifractals and wavelets. The multifractal analysis revealed the changes in complexity with varying <b>spindle</b> <b>speeds.</b> The wavelet analysis identified the coexistence of important periodicities related to the natural frequency {{of the system and}} its multiple harmonics. Their nonlinear superposition leads to the specific intermittent behavior. The workpiece used in the experiment was prepared from an epoxy-polymer matrix composite reinforced by carbon fibers...|$|R
40|$|Actual and {{projected}} optimum High Speed Machining data for producing shuttle external tank liquid hydrogen barrel panels of aluminum alloy 2219 -T 87 are reported. The data included various machining parameters; e. g., <b>spindle</b> <b>speeds,</b> cutting speed, table feed, chip load, metal removal rate, horsepower, cutting efficiency, cutter wear (lack of) and chip removal methods...|$|R
30|$|The {{amplitude}} of cutting force {{is proportional to}} the milling feeding depth and the <b>spindle</b> feeding <b>speed,</b> and reduce with the increasing of <b>spindle</b> turning <b>speed,</b> and is little influenced by milling feeding.|$|R
50|$|The ST3000DM001 is a {{hard disk}} drive {{released}} by Seagate Technology in 2011. It has a capacity of 3 terabytes (TB) and a <b>spindle</b> <b>speed</b> of 7200 rpm.|$|E
50|$|Grinding {{wheels are}} {{designed}} to be run at a maximum safe speed, the <b>spindle</b> <b>speed</b> of the grinding machine may be variable but this should only be changed with due attention to the safe working speed of the wheel. As a wheel wears it will decrease in diameter, and its effective cutting speed will be reduced. Some grinders have the provision to increase the <b>spindle</b> <b>speed,</b> which corrects for this loss of cutting ability; however, increasing the speed beyond the wheels rating will destroy the wheel and create a serious hazard to life and limb.|$|E
50|$|Multiplication of {{the models}} based on {{stability}} lobe theory, which {{makes it possible to}} find the best <b>spindle</b> <b>speed</b> for machining, gives robust models for any kind of machining.|$|E
30|$|In this case, it can {{be found}} that the tool path on the {{machined}} surface is equal to the <b>spindle</b> rotation <b>speed,</b> rather than the <b>spindle</b> rotation <b>speed</b> multiplies the number of flutes.|$|R
50|$|<b>Spindle</b> <b>speeds</b> {{are reduced}} {{when working with}} carriers, due to the {{unbalanced}} nature of the setup. Care {{must also be taken}} by the operator when using carriers, as it is easy to get snagged on one.|$|R
30|$|According to Eq. (24), {{the feeding}} per tooth f is {{inversely}} proportional to the <b>spindle</b> turning <b>speed</b> n, thus the cutting forces decrease {{with the increase of}} <b>spindle</b> turning <b>speed</b> n. On the other hand, the cutting velocity v increases with <b>spindle</b> turning <b>speed</b> n, which can in turn increase the shear strain rate γ̇ of shear zone (Eq. (16)). According to the quasi-solid–liquid transition constitutive equation of sand mould cutting (Eq. (23)), the stress in the shear zone will increase the cutting forces. Based on a comprehensive consideration of the above two factors, the cutting forces, therefore, decrease with the increase of <b>spindle</b> turning <b>speed</b> n but disproportionately, as Figure  10 (c) shows.|$|R
50|$|<b>Spindle</b> <b>speed</b> becomes {{important}} {{in the operation of}} routers, spindle moulders or shapers, and drills. Older and smaller routers often rotate at a fixed <b>spindle</b> <b>speed,</b> usually between 20,000 and 25,000 rpm. While these speeds are fine for small router bits, using larger bits, say more than 1 in or 25 millimeters in diameter, can be dangerous and can lead to chatter. Larger routers now have variable speeds and larger bits require slower speed. Drilling wood generally uses higher spindle speeds than metal, and the speed is not as critical. However, larger diameter drill bits do require slower speeds to avoid burning.|$|E
50|$|<b>Spindle</b> <b>speed</b> (S): This is the {{rotation}} {{speed of the}} tool, and is measured in revolutions per minute (rpm). Typical values are from hundreds of rpm, up {{to tens of thousands}} of rpm.|$|E
50|$|Launched in late 1999, {{it had a}} 512 KB cache, 5400 RPM <b>spindle</b> <b>speed</b> and an ATA-5 interface. It was {{available}} in 4.3, 8.4, 13, 17.3 and 26 GB capacities with up to three platters.|$|E
30|$|The {{increasing}} of <b>spindle</b> feeding <b>speed</b> vX {{will lead}} to the higher thickness of cutting layer a derived from Eq. (24). So, the increase of cutting forces is proportional to that of <b>spindle</b> feeding <b>speed</b> as shown in Figure  10 (a).|$|R
50|$|Ultra-high speed {{grinding}} (UHSG) can run {{at speeds}} higher than 40,000 fpm (200 m/s), taking 41 sec to remove 1 in.3 of material, {{but is still}} in the R&D stage. It also requires high spindle power and high <b>spindle</b> <b>speeds.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Finishing {{involves}} a slow pass across {{the material in}} very fine steps to produce the finished part. In finishing, the step between one pass and another is minimal. Feed rates are low and <b>spindle</b> <b>speeds</b> are raised to produce an accurate surface.|$|R

50|$|In mid-2000, Quantum {{released}} the LCT 15. It lowered the <b>spindle</b> <b>speed</b> to 4400 RPM, but still had 512 KB of cache and an ATA-5 interface. Capacities available were 7.5, 15, 20.4 and 30 GB {{with up to}} two platters.|$|E
50|$|High-efficiency deep {{grinding}} (HEDG) uses plated superabrasive wheels, which never need dressing and {{last longer than}} other wheels. This reduces capital equipment investment costs. HEDG {{can be used on}} long part lengths, and removes material at a rate of 1 in3 in 83 sec. It requires high spindle power and high <b>spindle</b> <b>speeds.</b>|$|R

40|$|Motion {{and power}} {{transmission}} mechanisms {{are one of}} the most important components of machine tools. With these mechanisms that are designed with steps or without steps, speeds required for optimum processing in machine tools can be obtained. In this study, a computer program based on Visual BASIC programming language has been developed for computer aided kinematical design of ruppert mechanism which can be adapted for machine tools. With this program, distribution according to geometrical series of <b>spindle</b> <b>speeds</b> between minimum and maximum speeds in the system, number of teeth for gears that construct the mechanism, general and partial transmission rate, and standard output <b>spindle</b> <b>speeds</b> can be determined in tolerance limits by inputting required parameters belonging to ruppert mechanism.
