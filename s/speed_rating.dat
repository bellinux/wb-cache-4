Easy Jet won the 1969 All American Futurity, the highest race for Quarter Horse racehorses, and was named World Champion Quarter Race Horse in the same year.

Also, Hester was invited to throw the ceremonial opening pitch and sing Take Me Out to the Ball Game at the Chicago Cubs' 2007 home opener. Along with teammates Rex Grossman and Tommie Harris, Hester appeared on the February 2007 issue of Sports Illustrated for Kids. His reputation {{has also been}} bolstered by EA Sports' Madden NFL 08, where Hester's perfect 100 <b>speed</b> <b>rating</b> made him the fastest player in the game's history. Hester also appeared in a promotional video for the game. He appeared in commercials for Under Armour in 2008 and 2009. In 2013, Hester outran a cheetah in a race sponsored by National Geographic at Busch Gardens Tampa. The competition consisted of Hester running back and forth on a straight track to simulate laps, while the cheetah ran in a similar but separate track.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: In this paper, a {{regression}} model was constructed {{to optimize the}} relationships between the void fraction of foamed HDPE/wood-flour composites, the processing conditions (extruder’s die temperature and screw <b>speed</b> <b>rate),</b> and the formulation compositions [chemical foaming agent (CFA) concentration and the moisture content of wood flour] by applying a four-factor central composite design (CCD) statistical approach. Design Expert software was employed to carry out the experimental design, statistical analysis, and numerical optimization. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) of the model showed that the void fraction of HDPE/wood-flour composites was a strong function of the extruder’s die temperature, the screw <b>speed</b> <b>rate,</b> and the moisture content of wood flour, while independent of the CFA content within the studied range (0 1 %). In addition, the moisture content of wood flour and the extruder’s screw <b>speed</b> <b>rate</b> exhibited significant interaction effect on the void fraction of the foamed composites. The response surface optimization generated using the regression model suggests that HDPE/wood-flour composite foams with the highest void fraction can be achieved {{at the highest levels of}} extruder’s screw <b>speed</b> <b>rate</b> (120 rpm) and moisture content of wood flour (12 %), together with the lowest levels of extruder’s die temperature (170 C) and no chemical foaming agent.

He earned an AQHA Superior Race Horse award along with his Race Register of Merit.

500|$|Battles in SaGa Frontier 2 utilize a turn-based {{approach}} {{where the}} player must input specific commands for each character {{at the beginning}} of each combat round, with each action taking place in accordance with a character's <b>speed</b> <b>rating.</b> In any given round, player may choose to attack an enemy with an equipped weapon, as well as use magic spells to cause harm to their opponent or aid their allies. By continually attacking an enemy with weapons, characters randomly learn special weapon skills that can deal more damage, as well as combine with other party member's attack to form combo attacks. Combat scenarios are divided into three separate types, which are either selectable by the player or dictated automatically by the plot - Duel, which allows one-on-one combat; Team, where up to four characters may take part against an entire enemy group; or Strategic, which can contain a large number of characters in a strategy-like scenario. Each character may equip up to two different kinds of weapons, and may become more specialized in a particular field of combat by assigning them [...] "roles", which increase their proficiency with certain weapon and spell combinations as well as give them additional abilities. By winning battles, characters may increase their statistics based on their actions in combat, thus becoming more powerful.|$|E
500|$|Much of Tenebrae {{takes place}} during daytime, or in harshly over-lit interiors. Except for the finale and some night scenes, the entire movie is shot with clear, cold light permeating the surroundings. The {{lighting}} and camerawork used in Andrzej Żuławski's Possession (1981) was {{an influence on}} the film's look. Although tenebr(a)e means [...] "darkness" [...] or [...] "shadows" [...] in Latin, Argento ordered cinematographer Luciano Tovoli to use as much bright light as possible. The director intended that the film be set {{in the near future}} and wanted the lighting to help create a [...] "cold, stark and semi-futuristic look". Argento explained that this approach was also an attempt to imitate what he saw as the [...] "realistic manner of lighting" [...] used in television police shows. The director explained that he was adopting [...] "a modern style of photography, deliberately breaking with the legacy of German Expressionism. Today's light is the light of neon, headlights, and omnipresent flashes... Caring about shadows seemed ridiculous to me and, more than that, reassuring." [...] Argento filmed half-empty streets and shops where he could, in an attempt to reflect a futuristic setting where a disaster had diminished significantly the population of his imaginary city. Tovoli used Kodak 5247 film stock (125 ASA <b>speed</b> <b>rating)</b> for daylight scenes, and Kodak 5293 (250 ASA) for night shoots. Tovoli rated both at 300 ASA to ensure controlled overexposure of the negative during filming, for the benefit of under-developing in the lab and less colour loss. The ultimate aim was for the images to be [...] "crystal clear", and the night scenes to be awash with light.|$|E
