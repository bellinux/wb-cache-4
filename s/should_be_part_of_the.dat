5|$|Historically Bournemouth {{was part}} of Hampshire, with {{neighbouring}} Poole, just {{to the west of}} the border, in Dorset. At the time of the 1974 local government re-organisation, it was considered desirable that the whole of the Poole/Bournemouth urban area <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> same county. Bournemouth therefore became part of the non-metropolitan county of Dorset on 1 April 1974. On 1 April 1997, Bournemouth became a unitary authority, independent from Dorset County Council. For the purposes of the Lieutenancy it remains part of the ceremonial county of Dorset.|$|E

5|$|A UK Kennel Club survey {{puts the}} median {{lifespan}} of Miniature Schnauzers {{at a little}} over 12 years. About 20% lived to >15 years. While generally a healthy breed, Miniature Schnauzers may suffer health problems associated with high fat levels. Such problems include hyperlipidemia, which may increase the possibility of pancreatitis, though either may form independently. Other issues which may affect this breed are diabetes, bladder stones and eye problems. Feeding the dog low- or non-fatty and unsweetened foods may help avoid these problems. Miniature Schnauzers are also prone to comedone syndrome, a condition that produces pus filled bumps, usually on their backs, {{which can be treated}} with a variety of methods. Miniature Schnauzers should have their ears dried after swimming due to a risk of infection, especially those with uncropped ears; ear examinations <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> regular annual check up. Miniature Schnauzers are also prone to von Willebrand disease (vWD). vWD in dogs is an inherited bleeding disorder that occurs due to qualitative or quantitative deficiency of von Willebrand factor (vWF), a multimeric protein that is required for platelet adhesion.|$|E

25|$|Chatfield became First Sea Lord in January 1933 and was {{advanced}} to Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath in the 1934 New Year Honours. As First Sea Lord he won arguments that the Royal Navy should have 70 cruisers {{rather than the}} 50 cruisers that had been agreed at the Naval Conference of 1930, that the battleship still had {{an important role to}} play despite the development of the bomber and that the Fleet Air Arm <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Royal Navy rather than the Royal Air Force.|$|E
25|$|Patrick was not {{hostile to}} aviation, however. He {{underwent}} flight training and obtained his wings, then issued {{a series of}} reports to the War Department emphasizing the need to expand and modernize the Air Service. In his first annual report in 1922, he warned that the Air Service had been degraded by budget cuts to the degree that it could no longer meet its peacetime obligations, much less mobilize for war. In one of the Air Service's first inclusions in the army's promotion system after becoming a combatant arm, among the 669 lieutenant colonels on the 1922 candidate list for colonel, the first Air Service member (James E. Fechet) was 354th. Patrick supported and issued the first air doctrine for the service, Fundamental Conceptions (patterned on Army Training Regulation 10-5 Doctrines Principles and Methods), which outlined strategy and tactics for the air arm. Patrick was also critical of the policy that placed air units under the command of corps commanders and proposed that only observation squadrons <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ground forces, with all combat forces centralized under the control of an air force attached to General Headquarters.|$|E

500|$|Barrett, by the {{beginning}} of the recording sessions for A Saucerful of Secrets, was already shrinking into a delirious state of mind, exacerbated by his feelings of alienation from the rest of the band. The common interpretation of the lyrics is that they reflect his schizophrenia and it has been argued that they could also be read as a criticism of the other band members for forcing him out. King said of the song: [...] "The most alienated, extraordinary lyrics. It's not addressed to the band, it's addressed to the whole world. He was completely cut off." [...] Jenner said [...] "I think every psychiatrist should be made to listen to those songs [...] I think they <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> curriculum of every medical college along with those Van Gogh paintings like The Crows." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{story was}} {{influenced}} by popular conspiracy theories, spy stories, and science fiction. The original writer for Deus Ex, Sheldon Pacotti, returned to write the game's script with newcomer Sarah Paetsch. A major difference from the first game was the player's freedom to change factions throughout the game, something not available in the first game. A core part of the experience was the branching narrative, giving the player multiple options of progress despite missions having a linear progression. Paetsch estimated that the game contained over 30,000 lines of voiced dialogue. The game's subtitle referred to the unseen battle that took place both around people and within them. The suggestion that all endings of Deus Ex <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> canon series of events was suggested by a staff member {{who worked on the}} original game's Hong Kong storyline. The locations were chosen for their distinct feel and—in some cases—iconic landmarks. They also chose locations associated at the time with the organizations featured in-game, such as Seattle and the WTO. The Antarctica setting {{was influenced by}} the John Carpenter's film The Thing. Rather than use JC as the main protagonist due to his actions in Deus Ex making him a grand figure in world history, the team created newcomer Alex, someone who would share JC's roots and begin [...] "at the bottom of the pyramid". One of the themes included in the game was the nature of terrorism, and how people could be classified as terrorists or freedom fighters depending on circumstance.|$|E

2500|$|According to Swerdlow, [...] "the 'core' TS conundrum" [...] {{is a lack}} of {{consensus}} about the definition of Tourette syndrome. [...] Since vocal tics result from a [...] "motor event (ie, a contracting diaphragm moving air through the upper airways)", TS could be defined as a disorder of motor tics, eliminating the distinction between TS and the other tic disorders. [...] Individuals who have only tics may not be functionally impaired, raising the question of whether Tourette's as currently defined should be a DSM diagnosis. [...] Swerdlow highlights the importance of studies in new areas such as behavioral techniques, and says that [...] "the whole-cloth dismissal of psychologic forces in the pathobiology of TS was a strategic error". [...] Questions remain about whether co-occurring (comorbid) conditions <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> core definition, and why sensory phenomena, which are a core part of Tourette's, {{are not part of the}} diagnostic criteria.|$|E

Hopkins' instruction letter explicitly stated his vision for the hospital; first, to provide assistance to the poor of [...] "all races", no matter the indigent patient's [...] "age, sex or color"; second, that wealthier patients would pay for services and thereby subsidize the care provided to the indigent; third, that the hospital would be the administrative unit for the orphan asylum for African American children, which was to receive $25,000 in annual support out of the hospital's half of the endowment; and fourth, that the hospital and orphan asylum should serve 400 patients and 400 children respectively, fifth, that the hospital <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> university, and, sixth, that religion but not sectarianism should be an influence in the hospital.|$|E

We show that net product, net income, net expenditure and productivity change are complements, not substitutes. We also examine whether holding gains and losses <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> depreciation and conclude that in a general equilibrium setting, either productivity change or holding gains <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> an extended Weitzman-type net income measure, but not both. ...|$|R
