50|$|Although {{the economy}} {{recovered}} in 1983, the residual effects of high inflation and {{high interest rates}} {{had a profound impact}} on the <b>savings</b> <b>and</b> <b>loans</b> <b>industry.</b> <b>Savings</b> <b>and</b> <b>loan</b> associations were limited by interest rate ceilings. As a result of rising interest rates, many <b>savings</b> <b>and</b> <b>loan</b> institutions experienced frequent account withdrawals, as depositors moved their money to higher-earning accounts offered by commercial banks. The already struggling <b>savings</b> <b>and</b> <b>loans</b> <b>industry</b> posted large losses in 1981 and 1982. High mortgage rates eroded the value of mortgage-backed loans, the primary asset of <b>savings</b> <b>and</b> <b>loan</b> associations. These fixed-rate loans were sold at a loss in order to balance withdrawals. This asset liability mismatch was identified as the primary cause of the <b>savings</b> <b>and</b> <b>loan</b> crisis.|$|R

500|$|The administration's {{stance toward}} the <b>savings</b> <b>and</b> <b>loan</b> <b>industry</b> {{contributed to the}} savings and loan crisis. It is also suggested, by a {{minority}} of Reaganomics' critics, that the policies partially influenced the stock market crash of 1987, but there is no consensus regarding a single source for the crash. In order to cover newly spawned federal budget deficits, the United States borrowed heavily both domestically and abroad, raising the national debt from $997billion to $2.85trillion. Reagan described the new debt as the [...] "greatest disappointment" [...] of his presidency.|$|E

25|$|On top of {{the budget}} crisis, Bush started his presidential tenure as the <b>Savings</b> <b>and</b> <b>Loans</b> <b>industry</b> was collapsing. The {{federal and state governments}} had {{deregulated}} the industry in the late 1970s and early 1980s, and the industry ventured into riskier investments that destabilized it.

2500|$|Many of Hoover's {{efforts as}} Commerce Secretary {{centered}} on eliminating waste and increasing efficiency {{in business and}} industry.

One major achievement was to promote product standardizations. He promoted international trade by opening overseas offices to advise businessmen. Hoover was especially eager to promote Hollywood films overseas. His [...] "Own Your Own Home" [...] campaign was a collaboration to promote ownership of single-family dwellings, with groups such as the Better Houses in America movement, the Architects' Small House Service Bureau, and the Home Modernizing Bureau.

In the 1980s he had objected to political misjudgments that lengthened and deepened losses in the <b>savings</b> <b>and</b> <b>loan</b> <b>industry.</b> [...] Because criminal referrals had been lodged by a federal agency against President Clinton, his wife, and their partners in a real estate venture for their role in the failure of a modest-sized Arkansas S, Leach as chair of the House Banking Committee held four days of hearings (all in the same week) on the causes and consequences of the failure. While federal taxpayer losses (approximately $70 million) associated with this particular S were not as large as with bigger institutions around the country, no S anywhere failed with a higher percentage of losses relative to assets than the one in Arkansas.|$|E
5000|$|From the {{beginning}} of his term, Bush faced the problem of {{what to do about the}} federal budget debt. At $2.8 trillion in 1990, the deficit had grown to three times larger than it was in 1980. Bush was dedicated to curbing the deficit, believing that America could not continue to be a leader in the world without doing so. He began an effort to persuade the Democratic controlled Congress to act on the budget; with Republicans believing that the best way was to cut government spending, and Democrats convinced that the only way would be to raise taxes, consensus building proved difficult.Ultimately, Bush had no choice but to compromise with Congress, and to renege on his 1988 [...] "no new taxes" [...] campaign promise.

40|$|OTHER PEOPLE’S HOUSES ADDS TO A GROWING LITERATURE on {{the origins}} of the Financial Crisis of 2008. Jennifer Taub’s {{contribution}} provides one of the most comprehensive studies to date. She outlines the many causes of the crisis, dispels myths, and explains what has been done—or how little has been done—in the wake of the crisis, while keeping the perspectives of struggling homeowners front and center. Taub begins by showing how the 2008 crisis was a continuation of the <b>savings</b> <b>and</b> <b>loans</b> crisis of the 1980 s and 1990 s that brought countless farmers and banks to ruin. In both crises, the “same players” operated, she argues, just under “new names” and in “new institutions with the same frailties. ” 2 She also reveals how the United States Congress, under pressure from the <b>saving</b> <b>and</b> <b>loans</b> <b>industry,</b> dismantled the New Deal regulatory framework, thus allowing <b>savings</b> <b>and</b> <b>loans</b> institutions to operate with much more risk.

40|$|Regulatory {{authorities}} in the banking <b>and</b> <b>savings</b> <b>and</b> <b>loan</b> <b>industries</b> have mandated that institutions establish loan loss allowances for regulatory accounting principles (RAP) that may be in excess of amounts recorded by the institution in preparing its financial statements under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The issue is whether an institution can record different loan loss allowances under the two methods and, if so, under what circumstances. EITF DISCUSSION The Task Force reached a consensus that an institution could record different loan loss allowances under RAP and GAAP as the amounts computed by preparers of financial statements and regulators may differ due to the subjectivity involved in estimating the amount of loss {{or the use of}} arbitrary factors by regulators. However, auditors should be particularly skeptical in the case of GAAP/RAP differences and must justify them based on the particular facts and circumstances. It was observed that the <b>savings</b> <b>and</b> <b>loan</b> Guide requires GAAP financial statements to disclose differences in loan loss allowances as part of the reconciliation of GAAP/RAP differences.

40|$|Although the {{escalation}} literature has grown steadily {{over the past}} 20 years, there has been very little research bridging the gap between laboratory experiments and qualitative field studies on escalation. What has been missing are quantitative tests of escalation hypotheses in their natural context. This study helps fill such a gap by testing the responsi-bility hypothesis within the banking industry. It was predicted that the turnover of senior bank managers {{would lead to a}} deescalation of commitment to problem loans. Data collected from 132 California banks over a 9 -year period showed that bank executive turnover predicted both provisions for <b>loan</b> losses <b>and</b> the write-off of bad loans. In contrast, provisions and write-offs were not found to influence executive turnover. The implications of these results are discussed in terms of both {{the escalation}} literature and practical ways to improve decision making in the banking industry. During the 1980 s, the United States experienced a breakdown in its <b>savings</b> <b>and</b> <b>loan</b> (S&L) <b>industry</b> <b>and</b> a near bankruptcy of its commercial banking system.
