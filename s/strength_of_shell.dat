40|$|ABSTRACT Eggshells were {{subjected}} to puncture tests and the microstructure of the resulting fractures examined by scanning electron microscopy. The shell material fractured in a manner typical of brittle materials where a cone of material is forced inwards. According to established theory the fractures are due to tensile stress. This explains why the forces required to puncture the egg and to fracture the egg by quasistatic compression between flat surfaces are related; both tests respond to the resistance <b>of</b> the <b>shell</b> material to tensile fracture. Tests using a punch and die to impose shear fractures showed that the shear <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> the <b>shell</b> {{is greater than the}} tensile value. Furthermore, the shear <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> the <b>shell</b> material is directionally dependent with the shell showing greater resistance when punched from the outside.

40|$|Nonlinear finite-element {{analysis}} {{provides a}} powerful tool for assessing the buckling <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> <b>shells.</b> Since shells are generally sensitive to initial geometric imperfections, a reliable prediction <b>of</b> their buckling <b>strength</b> is possible only if the effect of geometric imperfections is accurately accounted for. A commonly adopted approach is to assume that the imperfection {{is in the form of}} the bifurcation buckling mode (eigenmode-affine imperfection) of a suitable magnitude. For <b>shells</b> <b>of</b> revolution under axisymmetric loads, this approach leads to the analysis <b>of</b> a <b>shell</b> with periodically symmetric imperfections. Consequently, sector models spanning over one or half the circumferential wave of the imperfection may be considered adequate.

Minimum requirements of firefighters’ protective clothing performance have been clearly established by various national and international standards for new clothing to ensure the reasonable safety of firefighters. However, there are no clear guidelines on the requirements for continuing performance of firefighters’ protective clothing. In general, the protection offered by firefighters’ protective clothing is expected to deteriorate over time, {{but it is still}} uncertain how destructive different exposures are and how long a piece of firefighters’ protective clothing can continue to protect a firefighter to an acceptable level. Non-destructive techniques are preferable in order to investigate how the performance of protective clothing may change with time since this allows firefighters’ protective clothing to return to service after a test. These non-destructive methods, which could be used to monitor the level of deterioration in firefighters’ protective clothing performance and to make decisions on retirement of individual pieces of protective clothing, would be extremely useful for fire departments in Canada and other countries. Thermal exposure {{is an important factor in}} ageing of firefighters’ protective clothing during firefighting operations. Outer shell and moisture barrier specimens made of common fabrics used in construction of firefighters’ protective clothing, and of different colours, were exposed to different levels of thermal exposure simulated using a cone calorimeter in single and multiple stages. Tensile <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> outer <b>shell</b> specimens, and tear strength, water vapour transmission rate, and water penetration pressure of moisture barrier specimens, which are critical aspects of performance of firefighters’ protective clothing, were measured. In order to explain the changes in performance after thermal exposure, the temperature profile of specimens during each thermal exposure was recorded. Furthermore, thermogravimetric analysis for each specimen material was carried out and images of the surface of specimens were obtained using scanning electron microscope. The test results demonstrated that tensile <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> outer <b>shell</b> specimens deteriorated faster than other aspects of performance. Two non-destructive techniques, colour measurement and near infrared spectroscopy, were implemented to correlate tensile <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> outer <b>shell</b> specimens with discoloration and reflectance spectrum. Two types of correlation between tensile strength and colour change were identified among the tested fabrics, depending on the initial fabric colour, which could be a basis to develop numerical models to predict tensile <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> outer <b>shell</b> specimens.
