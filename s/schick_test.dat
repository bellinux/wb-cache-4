Através de pareamente por idade e sexo foram selecionados, entre os vizinhos dos pacientes, 24 crianças (GRUPO CONTROLE). A maioria dos pacientes provinha de bairros ou municípios operários da Grande São Paulo, vivendo sob precárias condições educacionais de saneamento e higiene. Através da história pregressa de vacinação, observou-se que nos 2 grupos é elevado o número de crianças não vacinadas com as três doses iniciais da tríplice. Porém, no Grupo Positivo, êste fato é observado em 100 % das crianças. Não houve diferenças significativas em relação ao teste de Schick realizado entre os irmãos dos indivíduos dos dois grupos. Entretanto, as freqüências de Schick negativo foram 61, 5 % e 75, 5 %, respectivamente, para os Grupos Controle e Positivo.

A group of 29 patients, corresponding to 13. 5 % of the total number of patients with the disease, admitted to the Hospital Emílio Ribas during the period, was compared with a matched control group of 24 neighbourhood's children. Most of the patients came from the fringe area of the Great S. Paulo and their families and residential quarters were characterized by precarious social, educational and hygienic conditions. The number of children with previous history of complete vaccination (three primary doses of toxoid) was strikingly low in both groups. As expected, none of the children in the case group had completed the three doses immunization schedule. Although the frequencies of negative <b>Schick</b> <b>tests</b> were 81. 5 % and 75. 5 % in the control and case groups, respectively.

40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] Boston UniversityDiphtheria {{antitoxin}} titers {{were measured}} by the hemagglutination technic in the serums of 7 normal subjects before and after immunization with a small dose of diphtheria toxoid. The "booster" dose administered was 1 Lf of fluid diphtheria toxoid. Human Group O red blood cells treated with tannic acid and diphtheria toxoid as the sensitizing antigen were employed in the hemagglutination methods. Hemagglutinating titers were expressed in antitoxin units per milliliter of a serum {{when compared with the}} hemagglutinating titer of a known diphtheria antitoxin. On one of the 7 subjects the experiment was extended over a period of eighty-six days after the administration of the "booster" dose. The remaining 6 subjects were tested repeatedly during a period of from zero to fourteen or twenty-four days because this time proved to be sufficient for the demonstration of a secondary antibody response. In all cases a blood sample was taken before the injection of the toxoid. <b>Schick</b> <b>tests</b> had not been done for the last six months, and were avoided before beginning the experiment because the Schick toxin could have acted as an immunizing stimulus and interfered with the experiment. Five of the 7 subjects who had a certain basic immunity against diphtheria, as determined from the serum specimens obtained before the immunization, showed definite increases in hemagglutinating titers after the stimulus. In every one of 5 subjects in whom an antibody rise was observed the distribution of the hemagglutinating titers was characteristic of a secondary antibody response. One of the remaining 2 subjects had no basic immunity, and no change in titer, as determined by the hemagglutination technic, was noticable within fourteen days after the booster immunization. The other subject had a very low hemagglutinating titer before the injection of the "booster" dose, but the titer did not increase during the next eighteen days. The partial hemagglutination reactions obtained with undiluted serums on the fourth, seventh, tenth and eighteenth days after the stimulus was injected were considered as nonspecific. Five individual serum specimens were titrated by the intracutaneous rabbit method. for comparison. In two instances the correlation between the antitoxin contents as determined by both these methods was close. Generally, antitoxin values were lower when determined by the intracutaneous method. The lack of correlation could probably be explained by the great sensitivity of the hemagglutination methods; however, this sensitivity does not always rule out the possibility of nonspecific hemagglutination reactions between minor impurities in the antigen and antiserums. The hemagglutination technic used in this work enabled the estimation of as little as 0. 00097 unit of antitoxin per milliliter of a serum. The method is very sensitive and proved useful for the determination of the antibody response in diphtheria immunization...|$|R

The tests, an inexpensive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) fingerprick test for tetanus antibodies and a modification of the Schick skin test for susceptibility to diphtheria, were administered before the booster injection. One week later the ELISA test was repeated {{and the result of}} the modified <b>Schick</b> <b>test</b> read.

An initial ELISA titre of 0. 01 IU/ml or lower correctly identified all six children needing a full series of tetanus toxoid (sensitivity for a primary immune response 100 %) and falsely identified only 3 of 28 immune children as needing the series (specificity for immunity 89. 3 %).

40|$|Man, {{in contact}} with the {{pathogens}} in his environment, responds by developing immunity with or without symptomatic illness. The incidence of infectious disease in a community depends on the parasitic factor or “infection pressure,” and the host factor, “herd immunity,” i. e., the resistance of {{the community as a whole}} to the infection. Environment is only a secondary factor which alters the relative values of the two primary factors. Morbidity varies directly as the “infection pressure,” and inversely as the “herd immunity. ” The great difficulty heretofore has been to separate the two factors expressing morbidity. In diphtheria, to some extent, this is now possible by means of the <b>Schick</b> <b>test.</b> By using clues gained from the study of diphtheria, and examining the age-incidence, severity, and fatality, of other infections under various environmental conditions, the hypothesis is reached that herd-immunity increases with the herd's past experience of the bacterial causes of most, if not all, infectious diseases. This immunity may be acquired latently, without illness, and, even if not always enough to prevent symptomatic infection, may be such that severity and fatality are decreased. The process is an example of the general biological mechanism by which the members of a species acquire adaptative variations more suitable to the environment. Of recent years air-borne droplet infections have caused less fatality and trouble to the English herd than a century ago. The manifold increase of the density and of the motion in the English herd must have greatly raised the average infection-pressure, but since severity of clinical disease has diminished and incidence has not increased in proportion, the herd-immunity of the English must have outstripped the increase of infection-pressure, i. e., the herd has become more closely adapted to its bacterial environment. It must not, however, be forgotten that adaptive fluctuations in parasitic characters must also play some part in all the phenomena of infectious disease...|$|E
40|$|Thus far most {{of those}} {{procedures}} adopted {{for the production of}} antibody have been of an arbitrary nature with attention chiefly directed toward {{the quality and quantity of}} the antigen and the parenteral route of its introduction. It is, however, becoming more and more clear that the factors which govern the extent to which an animal of a given species will respond with elaboration of antibody to a given antigen are very complex. Age, hormonal equilibrium, dietary state, and such intrinsic factors are known to play a role, and it is becoming obvious that certain extrinsic factors, other than mere quantity and suitability of antigen, may also exert an influence. As an example of this, reference may be made to the work of Hartley"' 2 and of Timmerman and Brandwijk, 3 a repetition of which forms the basis of this note. In summary, their results showed that guinea-pigs immunized with diphtheria toxoid respond with antitoxin production to a degree directly related to the volume of material injected, the toxoid content being constant. Thus, when tests of the developed immunity were made by the multiple <b>Schick</b> <b>test</b> method at a given interval after immunization with a certain quantity of toxoid only 11 per cent of the pigs proved to be immune, whereas those pigs which had received in immunization the same amount of toxoid diluted tenfold failed to react to the test toxin in 40 per cent of instances. Several experiments of this nature gave results of a comparable character; the diluted toxoid always exerting a greater immunizing power than that exhibited by the undiluted material. Incidentally, Timmerman and Brandwijk call attention to a curious and unexplained observation, to the effect that this favoring action of dilution (or greater volume) is to be observed only if the tests of immunity are made within the first 8 weeks after immunization; tests at a later period, in their experience, showed that the immunity developed to the undiluted toxoid was the higher.

The scope of investigation has even been extended to cold-blooded animals, revealing hemagglutinins in the blood of turtles, 34 alligators, 6 and frogs. 30 Isohemagglutinins and bacterial agglutinins have also been reported 5 ' 3 to be present. A great many surveys have been made, which produced evidence for more than one theory of origin. From results of the <b>Schick</b> <b>test</b> performed on more than 150, 000 children,. Zingher 40 concluded that repeated exposure to infection with the diphtheria bacillus is the most important factor in the development of natural immunity. Parr and Avery 25 claim the importance of a racial factor. After a survey of family groups Hirszfeld and his colleagues" 6 postulated that immunity or susceptibility to diphtheria is inherited in correlation with blood groups. They believed the blood groups to be constitutional characters and susceptibility to diphtheria to be inherited in correlation with these. It naturally follows that the physiological appearance of antitoxins is also a constitutional character. An external stimulant can prematurely accelerate the formation of antibody only if the physiological capacity exists. This genetic connection between blood group and Schick reaction has been questioned. 28 Hirszfeld 17 has formulated a theory to account for the occurrence of normal antibodies. He regarded normal antibodies as biochemical organs whose formation is a serological reflex; just as reflexes such as sucking, etc., occur in many animals, so also many normal antibodies occur in the serum without specific stimulation. This occurs at certain times during the life of the individual, and this process of serological maturation was called serogenesis, in analogy to morphogenesis.

40|$|Background. The {{purpose of}} this work was to study the {{morphological}} characteristics of brain changes in patients with diabetic encephalopathy (DE) {{on the basis of}} autopsy material research. Materials and methods. The paper presents the results of 14 postmortem observations. The mean age of the patients was 51. 0 ± 3. 4 years. The pieces of the brain were fixed in a solution of IHC Zinc Fixative, serial paraffin sections were made with a thickness of 10 ± 1 μm. The preparations were stained with hematoxylin and eosin, Congo red, thionin according to the Nissl method, <b>Schick</b> <b>test</b> was applied, with silver nitrate impregnation according to the Bielschowsky method and gold chloride — by Cajal, morphometric examination was performed according to G. G. Avtandilov. The study of the preparations was carried out on the Olympus AX 70 microscope with a digital camera Olympus DP 50. Microphotography of the preparations was performed using the program Pro 3. 2. Results. The main cyto-angioarchitectonic manifestations of DE are: diffuse alteration of basal membranes and vascular endothelium of the microcirculatory bed, {{and to a lesser extent}} — arterioles, intracerebral arteries and veins. High density (specific volume) of the capillary network at DE morphologically reflects the pattern of capillary paralytic stagnation. Capillary stagnation is accompanied by a stasis of the blood, an increase in the perivascular capillary space (Virchow-Robin space), the width of which is the morphological equivalent of lymphatic dyscirculation. Early morphological damage to the capillary walls is thickening and cleft of the main membrane with the accumulation of Schick-positive substan­ces, focal proliferation of endotheliocytes. Late injuries include capillary fibrosis and hyalinosis, proliferation of pericytes, which is accompanied by a sharp violation of transcapillary transport. Violation of striatal and radial cytoarchitectonics in the I–IV layers of the brain, prolapse of neurons (neuronal depopulation) is manifested by focal prolapse of ganglionic and pyramidal cells. Conclusions. Early reversible morphological changes of neurons are neuronal swelling (hydrophonic degeneration of nerve cells), focal hyperchromatosis. Irreversible structural damage to neurons is the lysis of the nucleus and nucleolus with homogenization of the cytoplasm, formation of shadow cells, vacuolization of the cytoplasm, pericellular edema, lysis of the processes in combination with neurophagia. The combination of acute alternative damage to neurons with chronic (ischemic) ones — pycnosis is typical, as well as coring of nuclei with pronounced atrophy of the cytoplasm...|$|E
