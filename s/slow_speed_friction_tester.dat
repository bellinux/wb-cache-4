40|$|Abstract. Friction {{material}} {{is essential for}} automotive braking system. Based on previous study of existing friction material problems, hybrid biological fiber-reinforced resin-based friction materials (HBRMs, from the reinforced fiber component of resin-based friction materials) were explored in this study. Bamboo fiber, jute fiber and wool fiber (all have length of 3 - 5 mm) were processed to make three types of HBRMs and considered as three factors of biological reinforced fiber in test using orthogonal experimental design. Each factor had three levels of 1 %, 2 % and 3 % fiber mass fraction while the ratio of other raw materials remains unchanged. According to the orthogonal experimental design table, nine formulations (denoted as M 1 -M 9) were determined to test the HBRMs. For comparison, non-bio-fiber reinforced friction material (NBM) was added in the test. The properties of the HBRMs tested included Rockwell hardness, impact strength and density. The friction and wear performance of the braking materials was examined by a <b>speed</b> <b>friction</b> <b>tester.</b> The {{results show that the}} friction coefficient of the HBRMs was slightly higher than that of the NBM, indicating biological fibers affected the friction coefficient. The friction coefficient of the HBRMs decreased firstly with the increase of temperature and had the lowest value when the temperature reached 300 ℃, and it increased then as temperature increased.

40|$|Asperity {{friction}} is a main indicator {{for wear}} and heat conduction [1]. It occurs when thickness of oil film shrinks {{due to high}} load or <b>slow</b> <b>speed.</b> <b>Friction</b> is scientifically well known {{as long as it}} is dominated by laminar oil film effects. If film thickness shrinks, the friction coefficient depends mainly on surface properties. This inaccuracy is normally preceded in simulation by using friction coefficients defined by Coulomb’s law [2]. To improve simulation results, the simulated friction moment was compared to measurement on a component test rig. Friction moment is produced on every square millimetre of the bearing surface, but can only be measured as an integral. Research findings show that measured results can’t be met by using one global dry friction coefficient for the whole bearing surface, even though it is material dependent. By introducing locally resolved and asperity pressure dependent dry friction coefficients, it was possible to adapt the simulated friction moment to measure one with a deviation of less than 5 percent. By means of simulation it was possible to develop locally resolved results based on integral measurements; and improve modelling the frictional state of mixed lubrication...|$|R
40|$|A {{decoupled}} <b>slow</b> <b>speed</b> <b>friction</b> torque {{model has}} been developed to predict the running torque of a double-arched angular contact bearing when operating as a four-point, {{as well as a}} two-point contact bearing. The load distribution model from Amasorrain et al. (2003) and the kinematics model developed by Leblanc and Nelias (2007) have been combined after ignoring centrifugal and gyroscopic effects, a valid assumption for <b>slow</b> <b>speed</b> operation. Results from the model are compared with previous literature data, as well as with tests done on a specially-developed friction torque rig. The comparison with the literature results was done for two specific cases: (i) when only one out of the two contact lines in the four-point contact bearing is active (effectively creating a two-point contact bearing); and (ii) where both contact lines in the four-point contact bearing are active. Further, the comparison was done with a custom-built friction torque rig with FAG QJ 309 bearings, again for two cases: (i) bearings mounted with a specific clearance (two-point contact); and (ii) bearings mounted with larger size balls to obtain interference (four-point contact). All tests were performed at low <b>speeds.</b> The sliding <b>friction,</b> which is an important input to the friction torque model, is carefully measured on ball-on-plate test using the same interface roughness, speed and contact pressure conditions as seen in the QJ 309 friction test.

50|$|The {{two ways}} to measure road {{slipperiness}} are surface friction testing and stopping distance testing. Friction testing can use surface <b>friction</b> <b>testers</b> or portable <b>friction</b> <b>testers,</b> and involves allowing a freely moving object, usually a wheel, to move against the surface.

The wheel, allowed to roll freely, is slightly turned relative to the ground so that it partially slides. Sensors attached to the axis of the wheel calculate the friction between the wheel and the pavement by measuring the torque produced by {{the rotation of the}} wheel. Surface <b>friction</b> <b>testers</b> are used at airports and on major roadways before ice formation or after snow removal. The vehicle can relay the surface friction data back to the control centre, allowing gritting and clearing to be planned so that the vehicles are deployed most efficiently. Surface <b>friction</b> <b>testers</b> often include a water spraying system, to simulate the effects of rain on the road surface before the rain occurs. The sensors are usually mounted to small compact or estate cars or to a small trailer, rather than the large trucks used for other winter service equipment, as the surface <b>friction</b> <b>tester</b> works best when attached to a lightweight vehicle.|$|R

40|$|AN ABSTRACT OF THE THESIS OF Jacob Boone, for the Master of Science {{degree in}} Mechanical Engineering, {{presented}} on 10 / 28 / 2010, at Southern Illinois University Carbondale. TITLE: DESIGN, CONSTRUCTION, AND EVALUTAION OF UNIVERSAL <b>FRICTION</b> <b>TESTER</b> MAJOR PROFESSOR: Dr. Peter Filip Many {{different types of}} <b>friction</b> <b>testers</b> are currently available for testing specific frictional applications. Of these machines very few have versatility, and {{of the ones that}} do, the amount of versatility is limited. Since friction is a property specific to each system, all operating parameters need to match the specific application as closely as possible in order to obtain accurate data. This requires many research facilities to have several specific <b>friction</b> <b>testers</b> in order to provide the necessary testing capabilities. The goal of this project was to design a Universal <b>Friction</b> <b>Tester</b> (UFT) with enough versatility to reproduce most types of sliding friction situations. This was accomplished by providing a wide range of testing capabilities through the use of interchangeable system components. Results show that the UFT provides quality data over its entire operating range. It was shown that normal pressure, sliding speed, temperature and system stiffness all have drastic effects on frictional performance. By using a borosilicate glass disc, the friction surface was viewed in-situ during testing. This allowed insights into true surface temperature and contact area. In conclusion, the UFT can successfully take the place of several <b>friction</b> <b>testers</b> and thus provide many friction research capabilities while requiring fewer resources. The wide range of testing capabilities will allow the UFT {{to be used as a}} research tool for many types of advanced friction studies. Some of these may include true surface temperatures, true contact area, influence of conditions on stick-slip phenomenon, and thermo-elastic instabilities...|$|R

As part of a research project carried out by the SGE Spezialgeräteentwicklung GmbH, in cooperation with Fraunhofer IW Dresden, a <b>friction</b> <b>tester</b> has been developed, which realizes a velocity of up to 120 m/min, a temperature of up to 100 °C and a normal force of up to 100 N.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new contribution to model tire/road friction. It proposes a calculation of hysteretic {{component of the}} rubber friction based on a simplified viscoelastic-rough contact model. The mechanical behavior of rubber elements is represented through "Kelvin-Voigt" model. The hysteretic friction force is calculated from the dissymmetry of the contact pressure due to the rubber viscoelastic behavior in given operating conditions (load, slip velocity [...] .). To validate the model, a series of texture and friction data are measured using two machines respectively the Circular Track Meter and the Dynamic <b>Friction</b> <b>Tester,</b> through various test surfaces and compared to model results. The Circular Track Meter is a complementary measurement device to the Dynamic <b>Friction</b> <b>Tester</b> as texture measurements can {{be done on the}} exact same physical surface tracks where the Dynamic <b>Friction</b> <b>Tester</b> measuring pads have been in contact with the test surface. The obtained results show a very encouraging correlation between the model predictions to the experiment results, thus opening a promising and attractive way to predict tire-road friction. Some indications are given at the end to improve the modelling and to extend to it to a whole type/road friction model...|$|R
