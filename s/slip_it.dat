25|$|In March 1961, CIA officer Richard M. Bissel had {{contacted}} {{a member of}} the mafia to assassinate Castro. Bissel tapped Tony Varona to carry out the assassination. Varona was given thousands of dollars and poison pills. Varona had managed to hand off a vial of poison to a restaurant worker in Havana, who was to <b>slip</b> <b>it</b> into Castro's ice cream cone. Cuban Intelligence officers later found the vial frozen to the coils in a freezer.|$|E
25|$|The planned executions went as high {{as acting}} boss D'Arco. Furious over the failed hit on Chiodo, Amuso set up D'Arco to be killed at a Manhattan hotel. However, this hit also came undone after D'Arco saw a man hide {{a gun in his}} shirt, then <b>slip</b> <b>it</b> into the bathroom. Recognizing this as a classic setup for a hit, D'Arco fled for his life and turned himself over to the {{authorities}} to spare him and his family from Amuso and Casso and their increasingly erratic demands. He was the first boss of a New York crime family, acting or otherwise, to become an informant.|$|E
25|$|But in the meantime, a few {{innovative}} craftsmen {{could still}} give new impulses {{to the production}} of black-figure vases. The most imaginative potter of the time, also a talented businessman, was Nikosthenes. Over 120 vases bear his signature, indicating that they were made by him or in his workshop. He seems to have particularly specialized in producing vases for export to Etruria. In his workshop the usual neck amphoras, Little Masters, Droop and eye cups were produced, but also a type of amphora reminiscent of Etruscan bucchero pottery, named the Nikosthenic amphora after its creator. These pieces were found particularly in Caere, the other vase types usually in Cerveteri and Vulci. The many inventions in his workshop were not limited to forms. In Nikosthenes’ workshop {{what is known as the}} Six’s technique was developed, in which figures were painted in reddish brown or white atop a black glossy <b>slip.</b> <b>It</b> is not clear whether Nikosthenes also painted vases, in which case he is usually presumed to be identical with Painter N. The BMN Painter and the red-figure Nikosthenes Painter are also named after Nikosthenes. In his workshop he employed many famous vase painters, including the elderly Lydos, Oltos and Epiktetos. The workshop tradition was continued by Nikosthenes’ successor, Pamphaios.|$|E

60|$|He {{handed a}} little packet across to Rochester, who <b>slipped</b> <b>it</b> {{carelessly}} into his pocket.|$|R
500|$|My War was {{the first}} of four Black Flag {{releases}} in 1984, a year that also saw Family Man, <b>Slip</b> <b>It</b> In, and Live '84 appear from SST. [...] It is considered to have helped usher in post-hardcore along with such releases as Hüsker Dü's Zen Arcade and Minutemen's Double Nickels on the Dime the same year.|$|E

2500|$|Wallenda then {{crossed the}} high-wire on an {{ordinary}} bicycle with the tires and handlebars removed. Near completion, he paused, causing the bike to slide backward as it lost {{grip on the}} wire. He regained control and finished, then jumped onto the roof of Prudential Center and hugged {{his wife and three}} children. He explained in an interview: [...] "The back wheel started to <b>slip...</b> <b>It</b> was a little nerve-racking at the end." [...] Five years later, he said the slip was closest he ever came to disaster. [...] "It really shook me up", he recalled. [...] By completing the ride, Wallenda set the world record for both highest and longest bike ride on a high-wire. A representative from Guinness World Records was on hand to present him with a certificate documenting the achievement.|$|E

2500|$|With Roessler on board, Black Flag began earnest experimentation, {{sometimes}} to critical and audience disdain: One critic writes that <b>Slip</b> <b>It</b> In [...] "blurs {{the line between}} moronic punk and moronic metal"; another writes My War is [...] "a pretentious mess of a record with a totally worthless second side." [...] Rollins reports that Black Flag's set-lists in this era rarely included older crowd favorites like [...] "Six Pack" [...] or [...] "Nervous Breakdown", and that audiences were often irritated by the new, slower Black Flag. Violence against the band (and especially Rollins) was ever-present, although the vocalist was now an avid weight lifter, and more than able to defend himself. Furthermore, to Rollins' chagrin, Ginn's interest in marijuana steadily increased; as Rollins put it, [...] "By '86 it was 'Cannot separate the man from his Anvil case with a big-ass stash.'" [...] Despite the initial resistance to the new music and quasi-psychedelic direction, My War would later be cited as a formative influence on the grunge, stoner and sludge metal genres. The band would continue to evolve toward a more heavy metal sound, with 1985's Loose Nut featuring more polished production.|$|E
2500|$|In 2000, vice {{president}} Tim Wildmon {{spoke out against}} gay-straight alliance clubs in schools, stating, [...] "We view these kinds of clubs as an advancement of the homosexual cause." [...] In 2003, the AFA filed an amicus curiae brief in Lawrence vs Texas, arguing against repeal of Texas sodomy laws. In 2004, the AFA raised concerns about the movie Shark Tale because the group believed the movie was designed to promote the acceptance of gay rights by children. [...] On the October 11, 2005, AFA broadcast, Tim Wildmon agreed with a caller that cable networks like Animal Planet and HGTV featured [...] "evidence of homosexuality and lesbian people" [...] and added that [...] "you {{have to watch out}} for children's programs today as well because they'll <b>slip</b> <b>it</b> in there as well." [...] In 2007, the AFA spoke out against IKEA for featuring gay families in their television ads. [...] In June 2008, the AFA protested a Heinz television advertisement, shown in the United Kingdom, which showed two men kissing, which Heinz then withdrew. [...] On January 28, 2015, the AFA wrote to the Southern Poverty Law Center that the AFA now rejected the policy that homosexual conduct should be illegal.|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh, Uncle Peter!" [...] cried Mary Louise, distressed; but Peter was obdurate and Bub never whimpered. He {{even managed}} to close his knife, between kicks, and <b>slip</b> <b>it</b> into his {{trousers}} pocket.|$|E
