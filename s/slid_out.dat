5|$|The Cunard White Star Line's RMS Queen Elizabeth {{was named}} after her. She {{launched}} the ship on 27 September 1938 in Clydebank, Scotland. Supposedly, the liner started to slide into the water before Elizabeth could officially launch her, and acting sharply, she managed to smash a bottle of Australian red over the liner's bow just before it <b>slid</b> <b>out</b> of reach. In 1954, Queen Elizabeth sailed to New York on her namesake.|$|E
5|$|The next {{match was}} another {{standard}} match involving Shelton Benjamin and Kerwin White. White {{tried to get}} in the ring, but Benjamin <b>slid</b> <b>out</b> and tripped him. Benjamin threw White into the ring barricade, which led him to throw him back in the ring as the bell rang to officially start the match. In the ring, Benjamin body slammed White, which was followed by a running forearm. White retaliated with a dropkick to Benjamin's knee. The match concluded after White grabbed a golf club that he hid in the steel steps and tried to assault Benjamin with it. Benjamin, however, countered with a T-Bone Suplex and covered White and got the pinfall victory.|$|E
5|$|Problems on the backstraight {{had been}} mostly {{rectified}} although a wet track {{surface in the}} first and fourth turns appeared caused by water coming from under the grandstands. Race officials deliberated {{on the morning of the}} race before declaring the track safe following the completion of repairs. The drivers took to the track at 11:15a.m local time for a ten-minute practice session. Carpentier set the fastest time with a lap of 27.075 seconds; Franchitti was second and Jimmy Vasser rounded out the session's top three drivers. A second session, lasting 90 minutes, began at 12:20p.m. local time. Kanaan recorded the session's fastest lap with a time of 24.719 seconds, ahead of Bräck in second and Tracy third. Three yellow caution flags were shown: the first was for Max Papis who cut his right-rear tyre, the second was for Maurício Gugelmin who <b>slid</b> <b>out</b> of the groove and hit the turn one outside barrier. His car slid across the wall and stopped at the corner's exit. The final stoppage was for a track inspection after Castroneves' pit crew reported the driver's right rear tyre was cut.|$|E

60|$|He {{accompanied}} the command with a slow, dominant {{movement of the}} hickory rod he was carrying. The snake dropped its head, and <b>slid</b> noiselessly <b>out</b> of the cleft across the trail and down the hill.|$|R
60|$|Very {{slowly the}} wing of his {{antagonist}} seemed to broaden as the impetus of his blow turned it up. He saw the full breadth of it and then it <b>slid</b> downward <b>out</b> of his sight.|$|R
25|$|On June 9, 1991, 32-year-old Candy Taylor of Toledo, Ohio, fell to {{her death}} from Flight Commander, an Intamin Flight Trainer, located at Kings Island. Investigators {{determined}} that a design flaw in the seat divider could allow a rider to slide into an unoccupied seat and become free from the restraint. A coroner's report later revealed that the victim had a blood-alcohol level of 0.30 which may have also contributed. Speculation suggests the rider lost consciousness during the ride and <b>slid</b> <b>out</b> from the restraints.|$|E
25|$|Weatherly was {{considering}} retirement going into 1964, and he drove {{only a couple}} of races for Moore, until tragedy struck. While racing Moore's No. 8 Mercury at Riverside International Raceway, Weatherly began setting up for Turn 6 when he lost control and struck the concrete barrier, then slid across the racetrack where his car came to a stop. Weatherly was dead when workers got to his car. He died when his car hit the barrier, as his head <b>slid</b> <b>out</b> the window and hit the wall, suffering major head injuries. Moore retired No. 8 and switched to No. 1, and hired Billy Wade, the 1963 NASCAR Rookie of the Year, to drive. Wade had a strong year, winning four consecutive races and finishing fourth in points. Bobby Johns, Johnny Rutherford, and Darel Dieringer also saw time in the car, with Dieringer winning at Augusta Speedway.|$|E
2500|$|This Thielvar {{had a son}} called Hafthi. And Hafthi's {{wife was}} called Whitestar. Those two {{were the first to}} settle on Gotland. The first night they slept {{together}} she dreamt that three snakes were coiled in her lap. And {{it seemed to her that}} they <b>slid</b> <b>out</b> of her lap. She told this dream to her husband Hafthi. He interpreted it thus: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not a chance, R. C.," [...] I replied. [...] "Had {{that all}} figured. I never put any strain on your line until the wave went back. Then I <b>slid</b> him <b>out,</b> the leader broke, and I scooped him up." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "One, two, four--nine," [...] said Tom Platt, {{counting}} with a practised eye. [...] "Forty-seven. Penn, you're it!" [...] Dan let the after-tackle run, and <b>slid</b> him <b>out</b> of {{the stern}} {{on to the}} deck amid a torrent of his own fish.|$|R
60|$|But she was {{not really}} unforgiving, and very soon she <b>slid</b> quietly <b>out</b> of her hiding-place, and taking the silk from Laufer's hands began to weave it. So quick and clever was she that the blue dress was not only woven but embroidered, and Lineik was safe back in her tree before the prince returned.|$|R
2500|$|The {{design of}} the back of the card can either help or hinder second dealing. [...] A playing deck with only a solid color back makes second dealing very {{difficult}} to detect. [...] Less so are cards with a uniform pattern or a single logo, such as an airline promotional pack. [...] Easiest to detect are cards with a strong white border design, which appears stationary on the top card as the second card is <b>slid</b> <b>out</b> from underneath.|$|E
2500|$|... "Sergeant Quick arose, and {{announced}} that he was a signalman. He produced from somewhere a blue polka-dot neckerchief as large as a quilt. He tied it on a long, crooked stick. Then he went {{to the top of the}} ridge, and turning his back to the Spanish fire, began to signal to the Dolphin. Again we gave a man sole possession of a particular part of the ridge. We didn't want it. He could have it and welcome. If the young sergeant had had the smallpox, the cholera, and the yellow fever, we could not have <b>slid</b> <b>out</b> with more celerity.|$|E
2500|$|By the {{afternoon}} of the 18 August [...] of earthwork had <b>slid</b> <b>out.</b> The slide area was [...] wide and larger and larger cracks were forming in the road. Small slides occurred at roughly fifteen-minute intervals. In the evening the head engineer on the site stopped all train traffic and operations were changed so there were trains operating at both sides of the slide. The smaller slides continued and in the morning of 19 August the land under the tracks had slid away, leaving the rails hanging in mid-air over a distance of [...] The guard house was evacuated and it was taken by the slide the following day. In all [...] of earthwork had been carried away by then. When the slides finally had concluded after a month, nearly [...] of earth had slid into the fjord. It was at the time the most extensive landslide to hit one of NSB's lines.|$|E
60|$|The man and {{the woman}} shifted their hands accordingly, tightly {{gripping}} the sides of the car, and Jerry slowly and carefully released the brake. The drum began to revolve as the endless cable passed round it, and the car <b>slid</b> slowly <b>out</b> into the chasm, its trolley wheels rolling on the stationary cable overhead, to which it was suspended.|$|R
50|$|There was {{no single}} event {{that marked the}} breakdown. Rather, the two churches <b>slid</b> into and <b>out</b> of schism {{over a period of}} several centuries, punctuated with {{temporary}} reconciliations.|$|R
2500|$|One design {{common in}} early days, called a [...] "loose coupler", {{consisted}} of a smaller secondary coil inside a larger primary coil. The smaller coil was mounted on a rack {{so it could be}} slid linearly in or out of the larger coil. If radio interference was encountered, the smaller coil would be <b>slid</b> further <b>out</b> of the larger, loosening the coupling, narrowing the bandwidth, and thereby rejecting the interfering signal.|$|R
2500|$|The second {{match was}} between John [...] "Bradshaw" [...] Layfield (JBL) and Chris Jericho. The match began with Jericho {{trapping}} Layfield in the Walls of Jericho. JBL {{got to the}} ropes, however, and <b>slid</b> <b>out</b> of the ring with Jericho quickly following him. JBL strangled Jericho with the ring ropes and later, plunged him onto the ropes. Jericho recovered and clotheslined JBL out of the ring. When they got in again, JBL threw Jericho into the ring post, {{as a result of}} which, Jericho was busted open. JBL tried {{to take advantage of this}} situation, but Jericho still fought back. The fight went outside the ring, where JBL began clearing the ECW announce table. Jericho grabbed a steel chair and hit Layfield with it. The referee immediately disqualified Jericho, who ignored the fact that he had lost the match and started to strangle JBL with some wires by the ring, in the same process Layfield did to Jericho on Raw.|$|E
2500|$|O'Hare {{was last}} seen at the 5 o'clock {{position}} of the TBF. About that time, the turret gunner of the TBF, Alvin Kernan (AOM1/c) noticed a Japanese G4M Betty bomber above and almost directly behind O'Hare's 6 o'clock position. Kernan opened fire with the TBF's [...]50-cal. machine gun in the dorsal turret and a Japanese gunner fired back. Butch O'Hare's F6F Hellcat apparently {{was caught in a}} crossfire. Seconds later Butch's F6F <b>slid</b> <b>out</b> of formation to port, pushing slightly ahead at about 160 knots and then vanished in the dark. The Avenger pilot, Lieutenant Commander Phillips, called repeatedly to O'Hare but received no reply. Ensign Skon responded: [...] "Mr. Phillips, this is Skon. I saw Mr. O'Hare's lights go out and, at the same instant, he seemed to veer off and slant down into darkness." [...] Phillips later asserted, as the Hellcat dropped out of view, it seemed to release something drop almost vertically at a speed too slow for anything but a parachute. Then something [...] "whitish-gray" [...] appeared below, perhaps the splash of the aircraft plunging into the sea.|$|E
2500|$|Taima is a transient/Icelandic hybrid female {{killer whale}} born in captivity to Gudrun in 1989. Trainers believe that Gudrun's {{behavior}} towards Nyar may have confused Taima, as {{she may have}} learned by example that this was how to raise a calf. In May 1998, Taima {{gave birth to a}} male calf named Sumar. They were separated when he was about eight months old because of the aggression between them. On one occasion while performing, Taima started biting Sumar and throwing him out of the pool onto the trainer's platform. She then <b>slid</b> <b>out</b> herself, and continued to bite him. In November 2000, Taima gave birth to a male named Tekoa. The two were separated after only nine months due to aggression between them. On March 12, 2007, Taima gave birth to her third calf, Malia. Taima seemed to be a better mother this time, and no notable occurrences of aggression were reported; this may be in part {{due to the fact that}} Kalina acted as [...] "aunt" [...] to Malia and helped Taima to look after her. Kalina was a very experienced mother and would often be kept with Malia, while Taima was given time with her mate, Tilikum.|$|E
60|$|The four-fifteen express <b>slid</b> softly <b>out</b> of Paddington Station and Ashe Marson settled {{himself in}} the corner seat of his second-class compartment. Opposite him Joan Valentine had begun to read a magazine. Along the corridor, in a {{first-class}} smoking compartment, Mr. Peters was lighting a big black cigar. Still farther along the corridor, in a first-class non-smoking compartment, Aline Peters looked {{through the window and}} thought of many things.|$|R

'More than even, Slider,' {{returned}} Squeers; 'you'd {{have been}} even with him if he'd got married; but with the disappointment besides, you're a long way ahead. <b>Out</b> of sight, <b>Slider,</b> quite <b>out</b> of sight. And that reminds me,' he added, handing her the glass, 'if {{you want me to}} give you my opinion of them deeds, and tell you what you'd better keep and what you'd better burn, why, now's your time, Slider.' ...|$|R
50|$|Despite {{an elbow}} injury, Thiam topped the shot put with 14.91 m {{to take the}} lead in the third round. Solid marks from Ennis-Hill, Theisen-Eaton and Jones saw them remain in the top five. Her weakest event, Johnson-Thompson <b>slid</b> to <b>out</b> of the lead and into sixth place after a poor 11.68 m. Germany's Carolin Schafer moved into the top five with a {{personal}} best. Barbara Nwaba and Visser placed in the top three of this event but remained outside the top eight.|$|R
2500|$|Leading West Indian batsmen Chris Gayle and Shivnarine Chanderpaul {{returned}} {{for the opening}} Test of the 2009–10 Australian cricket season starting on 26 November in Brisbane, after the industrial dispute was resolved. Ponting scored 55 in an Australian innings victory, before many sections of the media attacked the West Indies lack-lustre performance. Ponting produced scores of 35 and 20 in the following Test in Adelaide, as the touring side responded to their critics by securing a draw. For {{the first time since}} 2002, Ponting <b>slid</b> <b>out</b> of the top ten Test batting rankings—dropping to 12th—as Australia faced the prospect of falling to third in the team rankings if they were not able to achieve victory in the final Test of the series. Matters got worse for Ponting, as former Australian fast-bowler Rodney Hogg voiced that he should be sacked as captain and replaced with New South Wales leader Simon Katich. He said the team had become a [...] "boys club" [...] and was not preparing adequately for the future. However, former Australian Test opening batsman Justin Langer labelled Hogg's comments as [...] "rubbish", something that was backed by Katich.|$|E
2500|$|... "Suddenly, I {{heard the}} clatter of Leycester's machine gun above {{the roar of the}} engine. I looked round to see what he was {{shooting}} at, and nearly had a heart attack. Slanting down from above, getting nicely into position thirty yards behind my tail, was an Albatros. [...] "I immediately heaved the old A-W round in a split-arse turn, tighter I think than I had ever turned before. I felt a flash of panic as I lost sight of the Hun, but Leycester must have been able to see him all right as he kept on firing. My sudden turn had done the trick. The Albatros overshot and suddenly appeared right in front of me. Because of the relative motion of our two aircraft, he seemed to hang motionless, suspended in mid-air. I could see the pilot's face as he looked back at me. I sent a two-second burst of Vickers (machine gun) fire into him. His aircraft seemed to flutter, then <b>slid</b> <b>out</b> of sight below my starboard wing. I was pretty certain that I had hit his petrol tank. Behind me, Leycester was still blazing away. He was using tracer (incendiary bullets), and it may have been one of his bullets that ignited the petrol pouring from the Hun's ruptured tank. When I caught sight of the Albatros again, it was burning like a torch and side-slipping towards the ground, trailing a streamer of smoke. For an instant I saw the German pilot, looking down {{over the side of the}} cockpit. Then the smoke and flames enveloped him." ...|$|E
