50|$|In restaurants, wine {{is usually}} {{served by the}} litre, 750 mL or 500 mL bottle, but a wine glass is {{measured}} in ounces. Similarly, fast food restaurants (e.g. McDonald's Quarter Pounder) often advertise measurements of food and drink in US customary units, but converted to metric units, because either the containers are made to US standards, or the franchise is US-based and uses a standard size for its products. Thus in Canada a 20 US fluid ounce bottled soft drink is labelled as 591 mL (or occasionally rounded up to 600 mL). Beer in bottles continues to be 12 imperial fluid ounces (labelled as 341 mL), but beer in cans is filled to 12 US fluid ounces (labelled as 355 mL). There is also a larger sized beer bottle which is labelled as containing 1.18 L. Some of these package sizes have been introduced since Canadian metrication began; for example, the traditional Canadian soft drink can was 10 imperial fluid ounces (284 mL), later marketed as 280 mL. Only in the early 1990s did the US-derived 355 mL size displace it. Television sets and computer screens are also measured in inches. Standard and special fasteners like alloys, nuts, bolts, washers, studs, tapping, <b>self</b> <b>drilling</b> screw and socket screware are often quoted in both imperial and metric; products range from 2/56 in diameter up to 4 in.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{research}} was to demonstrate a fluidless directional drilling and monitoring system (FDD) specifically tailored to address environmental drilling concerns for shallow buried wasted. The major concerns are related to worker exposure, minimizing waste generation, and confining the spread of contamination. The FDD is potentially applicable to Environmental Restoration (ER) activities for the Oak Ridge National Laboratory Waste Area Grouping 6 (WAG 6) shallow buried waste disposed in unlined trenches. Major ER activities for directional drilling are to develop a drilling system for leachate collection directly beneath trenches, and to provide localized control over leachate release to the environment. Other ER FDD activities could include vadose zone and groundwater monitoring of contaminant transport. The operational constraints pointed the research {{in the direction of}} purchasing a steerable impact hammer, or mole, manufactured by Steer-Rite Ltd. of Racine, Wisconsin. This drill was selected due to the very low cost ($ 25, 000) associated with procuring the drill, steering module, instrumentation and service lines. The impact hammer is a <b>self</b> propelled <b>drill</b> which penetrates the soil by compacting cut material along the sidewalls of the borehole. Essentially, it forces its way through the subsurface. Although the pneumatic hammer exhausts compressed air which must be handled at the borehole collar, it does not generate soil cuttings or liquids. This is the basis for the term fluidless. A stub casing muffler was attached to the entrance hole for controlling exhaust gas and any airborne releases. Other environmental compliance modifications made to the equipment included operating the tool without lubrication, and using water instead of hydraulic fluid to actuate the steering fins on the tool...|$|R

40|$|International audienceRecent {{developments}} in PDC bit modelling and single cutter analysis have enabled {{to design a}} new generation of cutting structures - based on the optimization of a specific interactive cutting mode - that generates, by the mere drilling action of the cutters, an axial force oriented in the drilling direction : a negative weight on bit. This paper presents the application of this new PDC bit design and shows that WOB can be significantly reduced {{in a wide range of}} formations. A monobloc 8 " 1 / 2 PDC bit was designed, tested in laboratory, and self penetration was clearly achieved in field conditions. A full PDC bit design methodology using a new PDC cutters geometry optimized for a maximum thrust effect, along with specific manufacturing procedures for high-level precision in cutter positioning, were developed for this specific new bit generation. Laboratory tests showed that it was possible to drill without WOB at a high rate of penetration and with a small increase in specific energy. Preliminary field tests in cement demonstrated that <b>self</b> penetration - <b>drilling</b> with the neutral point just above the bit - was possible with specific surface control, and a first operational application was conducted by Total E&P Angola. This new bit technology has the potential to increase bit performance, specifically in operating conditions where power is available but WOB is limited due to friction, buckling or reduced vertical depth. The ability to drill with reduced WOB - or even without any WOB - should extend the potential of existing drilling technologies such as Extended Reach Drilling, Coiled Tubing or Steerable Motor in sliding mode and reduce axial vibration, thus increasing the MTBF of downhole tools...|$|R

40|$|The Profiled Steel Sheet Dry Board (PSSDB) {{system is}} a thin-walled, {{lightweight}} composite structure consisting of Profiled Steel Sheeting connected to dry boards by means of <b>self</b> <b>drilling,</b> self tapping screws and is a structural load bearing system. The size of {{the model of the}} wall selected is 3000 mm x 3000 mm x 78 mm. It is a square section with window opening section at 1200 mm x 1200 mm and symmetrically positioned {{in the center of the}} specimen. The study is based on the concept that the load bearing capacity of the composite wall is derived from the individual components, namely the profiled steel sheeting, dry board and the interaction between these two. Therefore, an analytical method is essential to predict the behaviour of the PSSDB system as walling unit with window opening. A linear finite element model has been developed to predict the full range of behaviour of PSSDB panel. LUSAS (1999), a finite element package (LUSAS version 13. 4) has been employed for this purpose.

40|$|Horizontal shear {{interaction}} between profiled steel sheeting and concrete in composite slab is obtained through various means, such as frictional resistance due to indentation or embossment in the sheeting, interlocking at the steel and concrete interface resulting from curvature {{and shape of}} the sheeting profile under bending, and anchorage devices such as welded shear studs and crippled sheeting {{at the end of the}} span. Permanent end pour stops may provide some restraining effect to the slipping of the concrete, and hence may enhance the composite action. Despite the use of many types of devices, most reported test results of typical length composite slabs still exhibit partial shear interaction. This paper reports the enhancement of the horizontal shear interaction at the concrete-profiled steel sheeting interface of composite slab by using shear screws. Six full scale bending tests were conducted of which three specimens with different slenderness were enhanced with <b>self</b> <b>drilling</b> screws while another three were without screws. The test results show that the failure mode of composite slab can be improved to ductile type and the load carrying capacity can be increased by the presence of the shear screws. The load performance of the slab is also affected by the slenderness, which is the ratio of shear span to effective depth...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Self-drilling screws are {{the primary}} means of {{fastening}} for cold-formed steel members in cold-formed thin-gauge steel residential construction because it can drill their own holes and form their own threads. The fabrication of connections is the most labour intensive aspect of the cold-formed thin-gauge steel construction process, thus {{a better understanding of}} the behaviour of screw connections could lead to optimum connection design and reducing the cost of the fabrication. The study carried out to investigate the behaviour of single-shear connections using self-drilling screws in the cold-formed steel construction. The focus of this study is on the influence of the number of screws and screw spacing on the strength of <b>self</b> <b>drilling</b> screw connection. These parameters are varied to determine their influences on the connection strength. The failure load and failure modes were obtained and observed from the tests carried out in the laboratory. Bearing and tilting failures occurred during the testing of these specimens. The predicted connection strengths were calculated using American Iron and Steel Institute (AISI) design equations. A total of 24 specimens of single shear test showed that connection strength is linearly proportional to the number of screw in the connection. Results of the specimen with spacing more than 3 d show better correlation with the calculated results as compared to specimens with screw spacing less than 3 d...|$|E
40|$|Rapid {{development}} in construction industry {{has resulted in}} increasing to demand for effective and innovative construction systems. Nowadays, construction no longer depends on current systems such as using timber bases and reinforcement concrete structures There are many problems with the current techniques such as high costing, low quality, and long construction time. One of the viable solution is to employ Industrialised Building System (IBS) which is a more efficient construction technology. Profiled Steel Sheeting Dry Board (PSSDB) is one type of Industrialised Building System (IBS). The PSSDB is a composite system that comprises of two main components which are profiled steel sheeting (PSS) and dry board (DB). They are attached by <b>self</b> <b>drilling</b> and self tapping screws. This research study {{about the effect of}} Primaflex dry board thickness towards the screw stiffness which has not been done before. The objectives of this study are to identify the screw stiffness using Primaflex dry board from push out test and to evaluate and also identify effect of Primaflex with different thicknesses. The results from this study have two parts which are effect of dry board from different thickness and effect of the screw. The result show that the Pnmaflex that has 9 mm of thickness has higher screw stiffness (0. 46 kN) than Primaflex that has 6 mm of thickness (0. 40 kN). Moreover, the result of an effect of the screw, the screw is easy to fail when the thickness of Primaflex is 6 mm more than Primaflex 9 mm. It is because, the hold between Peva and Primafl'ex is strong when the dry board is thick. As a conclusion, the thick board has a higher stiffness than thin board...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background: A spiral implant is a conical {{internal}} helix implant with {{a variable}} thread design which confers the characteristic of <b>self</b> <b>drilling,</b> self tapping and self bone condensing. Reports have reported {{the effectiveness of}} this type of implants in several clinical situations. However, because there are no reports that specifically focus on {{one of the biggest challenges}} in oral rehabilitation, i. e. the full arch rehabitation, it was decided to perform a retrospective study. Materials and Methods: The study population was composed of 23 patients (12 females and 11 males, median age 57 years) for evaluation and implant treatment between January 2005 and June 2009. 206 Spiral family implants (SFIs) were inserted with a mean post loading follow-up of 23 months. Several variables were investigated: demographic (age and gender), anatomic (maxilla and mandible, tooth site), implant (type, length and diameter), surgical (surgeon, post-extractive, flapless technique, grafts) and prosthetic (implant/crown ratio, dentition in the antagonist arch, type of loading and CT planning) variables. Implant loss and peri-implant bone resorption were evaluated. Univariate and multivariate test were performed. Results: Survival and success rates were 97. 1 and 82. 5 %, respectively. Only implant length and implant/crown ratio were statistical significance in determining a better clinical outcome. Conclusion: In conclusion, SFIs are a reliable tool for most difficult cases of oral rehabilitation. No differences were detected among implant type. Length and implant/crown ratio can influence the crestal bone resorption with better result for longer fixtures and an higher implant/crown ratio. In addition banked bone derived from living donors can be used to restore alveolar ridge augmentation without adverse effects. Finally, flapless and CT-planned surgery did not significant increases the clinical outcome in most complex rehabilitation...|$|E
40|$|Computer aided joint {{replacement}} surgery {{has become}} very popular during recent years and is being done in increasing numbers all over the world. The accuracy of the system depends to a major extent, on accurate registration and immobility of the tracker attachment devices to the bone. This {{study was designed to}} asses the forces needed to displace the tracker attachment devices in the bone simulators. Bone simulators were used to maintain the uniformity of the bone structure during the study. The fixation devices tested were 3 mm diameter <b>self</b> <b>drilling,</b> self tapping threaded pin, 4 mm diameter self tapping cortical threaded pin, 5 mm diameter self tapping cancellous threaded pin and a triplanar fixation device ‘ortholock’ used with three 3 mm pins. All the devices were tested for pull out, translational and rotational forces in unicortical and bicortical fixation modes. Also tested was the normal bang strength and forces generated by leaning on the devices. The forces required to produce translation increased with the increasing diameter of the pins. These were 105 N, 185 N, and 225 N for the unicortical fixations and 130 N, 200 N, 225 N for the bicortical fixations for 3 mm, 4 mm and 5 mm diameter pins respectively. The forces required to pull out the pins were 1475 N, 1650 N, 2050 N for the unicortical, 1020 N, 3044 N and 3042 N for the bicortical fixated 3 mm, 4 mm and 5 mm diameter pins. The ortholock translational and pull out strength was tested to 900 N and 920 N respectively and still it did not fail. Rotatory forces required to displace the tracker on pins was to the magnitude of 30 N before failure. The ortholock device had rotational forces applied up to 135 N and still did not fail. The manual leaning forces and the sudden bang forces generated were of the magnitude of 210 N and 150 N respectively. The strength of the fixation pins increases with increasing diameter from three to five mm for the translational forces. There is no significant difference in pull out forces of four mm and five mm diameter pins though it is more that the three mm diameter pins. This is because of the failure of material at that stage rather than the fixation device. The rotatory forces required to displace the tracker are very small and much less that that can be produced by the surgeon or assistants in single pins. Although the ortholock device was tested to 135 N in rotation without failing, one has to be very careful not to put any forces during the operation on the tracker devices to ensure the accuracy of the procedure. ...|$|E
