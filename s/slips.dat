5|$|Although Harvey {{started as}} a wicketkeeper at school, he became a highly {{regarded}} cover fielder and later in his international career became an agile <b>slips</b> catcher. He bowled off spin from a three to four pace approach on rare occasions, taking only three wickets in his Test career. Away from the field, Harvey had a quiet and unassuming manner, in complete contrast to his dynamic batting, and his non-smoking, non-drinking set him apart from the prevailing cricket culture of his period.

To investigate the ball screw <b>slipping</b> mechanism, transformed coordinate system should be established firstly. Then it is used to set up mathematical modeling for the ball <b>slipping</b> caused by the three main reasons and the speed of <b>slipping</b> can be calculated. Later, the influence of the contact angle, helix angle and screw diameter for ball screw <b>slipping</b> will be analyzed according to the ball <b>slipping</b> model and <b>slipping</b> speeds equation and the <b>slipping</b> analysis will be obtained. Finally, curve of <b>slipping</b> analysis and that of mechanical efficiency of the ball screw analysis by Lin are compared, which will indirectly verify the correctness of the <b>slipping</b> model. The <b>slipping</b> model and the curve of <b>slipping</b> analysis established in this paper will provide theory basis for reducing <b>slipping</b> and improving the mechanical efficiency of a ball screw operating at high speeds...|$|R
5|$|Bradman {{thought his}} faster bowlers could not extract much bounce {{from the surface}} and soon removed the short leg fielder, and pursued a 63 {{off-side}} field with three <b>slips</b> and a deep point, trying to encourage the English openers {{to cut through the}} vacant area between the <b>slips</b> and extra cover. However, they declined Bradman's incentive and decided to bat in a low-risk manner, favouring straight-batted shots. After 80 minutes of batting, England's openers reached 50, the first time they had put on a half-century in the series. Hutton and Washbrook appeared set for the long haul, and did not react to the applause. They continued on cautiously, and persisted in eschewing the cross-batted cut and pull shots and relying on the safe accumulation of singles.|$|E

50|$|In {{materials}} science, a <b>slip</b> system {{describes the}} set of symmetrically identical <b>slip</b> planes and associated family of <b>slip</b> directions for which dislocation motion can easily occur and lead to plastic deformation.An external force makes parts of the crystal lattice glide along each other, changing the material's geometry.Depending {{on the type of}} lattice, different <b>slip</b> systems are present in the material.More specifically, <b>slip</b> occurs on close-packed planes (those containing the greatest number of atoms per area), and in close-packed directions (most atoms per length). The magnitude and direction of <b>slip</b> are represented by the Burgers vector.The picture on the right shows a schematic view of the <b>slip</b> mechanism.The <b>slip</b> planes and <b>slip</b> directions in a crystal have specific crystallographic forms.The <b>slip</b> planes are normally the planes with the highest density of atoms, i.e., those most closely spaced, and the direction of the <b>slip</b> is the direction in the <b>slip</b> plane that corresponds to one of the shortest lattice translation vectors.Often, this is the direction in which atoms are most closely spaced.A <b>slip</b> plane and a <b>slip</b> direction constitute a <b>slip</b> system.A critical resolved shear stress is required to initiate a <b>slip.</b> <b>Slip</b> is an important mode of deformation mechanism in crystals.For metals and technically used metallic alloys it {{is by far the most}} important deformation mechanism and subject to current research in materials science.|$|R

To get better resolution for co-seismic and post-seismic <b>slip</b> distribution, we imposed a weak constraint as a priori information of the co-seismic <b>slip</b> determined by seismic wave analyses. We found that the post-seismic <b>slip</b> during 100 days following the main-shock amount to as much moment release as the main-shock, and that the sites of co-seismic <b>slip</b> and post-seismic <b>slip</b> are partitioning on a plate boundary region in complimentary fashion.

40|$|A 2 -D {{model of}} a fault plane with inhomgeneous <b>slip</b> {{resistance}} is investigated using a finite element method. <b>Slip</b> is nucleated at a weak spot, and propagates initially in both directions. At {{one side of the}} nucleation point, the resistance to <b>slip</b> is assumed t o increase along the fault. This causes the <b>slipping</b> edge to reverse its direction. In this way unidirectional <b>slip</b> with o n e leading and one trailing edge emerges. At the leading edge <b>slip</b> is assumed to propagate according to a critical shear stress criterion combined with a <b>slip</b> weakening law. At the trailing edge, where the process of healing occurs, <b>slip</b> is assumed to be arrested in a n energy-neutral way. The simulations indicate that a steady state unidirectional <b>slip</b> is approached. The edge velocities can be very high and even overshoot the shear wave velocity.

40|$|Local <b>slip</b> {{velocity}} is {{an important}} factor in mass,momentum and heat transfer of riser reactors. Based on the EMMS model, the qualitative and quantitative analysis is made for local <b>slip</b> velocity and its components (the <b>slip</b> velocity in the dense phase (cluster), the <b>slip</b> velocity in the dilute phase and the <b>slip</b> velocity between dense phase and dilute phase). It is found that the <b>slip</b> velocity between dense phase and dilute phase makes the most contribution to the local <b>slip</b> velocity and clusters lead to the high local <b>slip</b> velocity, from which the correlation of local <b>slip</b> velocity with local voidage is derived. Using this correlation, the local gas-solids <b>slip</b> velocities in gas-solids up-risers are predicted. Calculation results are well consistent with experimental data. Furthermore, the effects of operating conditions on local <b>slip</b> velocities are discussed. It is concluded that local <b>slip</b> velocity increases with the increase of solids circulating rate and decreases with the increase of superficial gas velocity...|$|R

5|$|Halfway {{through the}} day, England fell to 5/119, and captain Yardley came in. He hit Toshack in the air, but Barnes {{was unable to}} {{complete}} the reflex catch at short leg. However, this error did not cost many runs. Yardley lofted Toshack into the on-side and the hands of Johnson at forward square leg to fall for 22 with the score at 6/141. Toshack's defensive bowling had caused the English skipper to lose patience and his departure for 22 left the score on 141/6. Toshack bowled Dick Pollard late in the innings to finish with 2/75 from 41 overs—including 20 maidens—as England ended with 363. Toshack was unbeaten on zero and was only at the crease for one minute as Australia replied with 221. In the second innings, Toshack removed Compton for a duck, caught in the <b>slips</b> by Miller, and ended with 1/26 as the rain-affected match ended in a draw. He also had Washbrook dropped in the <b>slips</b> cordon by Johnson, one of several times that the batsman was reprieved during the innings.|$|E
40|$|The {{interaction}} between <b>slip</b> bands and grain boundaries in commercial-purity titanium was examined using cross-correlation-based electron backscatter diffraction. At a low strain level, {{three types of}} interactions were observed: blocked <b>slip</b> band with stress concentration; <b>slip</b> transfer; and blocked <b>slip</b> band with no stress concentration. The stress concentration induced by the blocked <b>slip</b> band was fitted with Eshelby's theoretical model, from which a Hall-Petch coefficient was deduced. It {{was found that the}} Hall-Petch coefficient varies with the individual grain boundary. We investigated the geometric alignment between the <b>slip</b> band and various <b>slip</b> systems to the neighbouring grain. Stress concentration can be induced by the blocked <b>slip</b> band if the <b>slip</b> system is poorly aligned with prismatic, pyramidal or basal <b>slip</b> systems in the neighbouring grain. Transfer of <b>slip</b> across the boundary occurs when there is good alignment on prismatic or pyramidal <b>slip</b> systems. Other stress-relieving mechanisms are possible when the best alignment is not with the <b>slip</b> system that has the lower critical resolved shear stress. © 2014 Acta Materialia Inc.

30|$|We {{note that}} the {{connecting}} segments produce <b>slip</b> in the cross-slip plane. The amount of this <b>slip</b> can be estimated by considering a situation well after the recombination event, when the resulting loop has approximately spherical shape with radius R. The <b>slipped</b> area in the primary <b>slip</b> plane is then πR 2, and {{the area in the}} cross <b>slip</b> plane is, on average, Rycs/ 2. Hence, the ratio of the <b>slip</b> amount in the primary and the cross <b>slip</b> plane is of the order of 2 πR/ycs≈ 2 πρ/(ycsq). We will show later in “CDD(0)” section that, for typical hardening processes, the amount of <b>slip</b> in the cross <b>slip</b> plane caused by recombination processes can be safely neglected.|$|R
40|$|Prior {{knowledge}} of potentially slippery conditions {{has been shown}} to alter normal human gait in <b>slip</b> and fall experiments. Here we quantify the effects of two aspects of prior knowledge – awareness of a possible <b>slip</b> and prior <b>slip</b> experience – on normal gait. Sixty-eight subjects (40 F, 28 M) each walked over 48 high-friction surfaces (control trials) and 12 low-friction surfaces. Within- and between-subject changes in lower limb muscle activation, gait kinematics and ground reaction forces were analyzed in three non-slip control trials: one before and one after the first unexpected <b>slip</b> exposure, and a third after repeated <b>slip</b> exposures. Subjects knew they might <b>slip</b> in the latter two trials but not the first trial. Twenty subjects <b>slipped</b> during their first low-friction exposure (early <b>slip</b> group), 32 in later low-friction exposures (late <b>slip</b> group), and 16 subjects did not <b>slip</b> at all. Simultaneous changes in awareness and experience between the first two analyzed trials of the early <b>slip</b> group altered the muscle activity in both limbs, reduced the foot and knee angles at heel strike in the <b>slip</b> limb and reduced the ground reaction forces, impulses and utilized friction after heel strike in the <b>slip</b> limb. A change in only awareness between the first two analyzed trials of the late <b>slip</b> group produced the same kinematic changes seen in the early <b>slip</b> group, but only small muscle activity change and no kinetic changes. Subsequent <b>slip</b> experience in the late <b>slip</b> group produced the muscle activation and kinetic changes observed in the early <b>slip</b> group, but no further kinematic changes. These results showed that awareness of a potential <b>slip</b> primarily alters how the slip-limb approaches the floor, whereas prior <b>slip</b> experience primarily alters the anticipatory muscle activation and how the foot interacts with the floor. These muscle, kinematic and kinetic changes were consistent with a more cautious “normal” gait, and can reduce the external validity of <b>slip</b> and fall experiments...|$|R
