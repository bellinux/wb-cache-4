50|$|Perhaps because Freud himself {{began his}} career as a neurologist, many of today's neurologists take {{psychoanalysis}} somewhat more seriously than, <b>say,</b> experimental <b>psychologists</b> do. As a result, the neuropsychoanalytic group has been able to draw useful insights from a number of distinguished neuroscientists: Antonio Damasio, Eric Kandel, Joseph LeDoux, Helen Mayberg, Jaak Panksepp, VS Ramachandran, Oliver Sacks, Mark Solms and many others. (Some serve on the editorial board of the journal Neuropsychoanalysis).|$|R

Moreover, the research should bear no potential harm to the subject as an outcome of deception, be it physical pain or emotional distress. Finally, the code requires a debriefing session, in which the experimenter tells the subject about the deception, and gives subjects the option of withdrawing their data.|$|R

The purpose of this article is to identify for social work evaluators some of the ways program evaluation can differ from true experiments and to discuss issues that may affect the planning and conduct of evaluation efforts. The Appalachia Community Cancer Network is used as a case example, and illustrations of its approach using formative and process evaluation are presented...|$|R

I wonder by what ingenuity we brought on that confused state of mind when sense became nonsense, when figures wouldn't work, when dead languages wouldn't construe, when live languages wouldn't be spoken, when memory wouldn't come, when dulness and vacancy wouldn't go. I cannot remember that we ever conspired to be sleepy after dinner, or that we ever particularly wanted to be stupid, and to have flushed faces and hot beating heads, or to find blank hopelessness and obscurity this afternoon in what would become perfectly clear and bright in the freshness of to-morrow morning. We suffered for these things, and they made us miserable enough. Neither do I remember that we ever bound ourselves by any secret oath or other solemn obligation, to find the seats getting too hard to be sat upon after a certain time; or to have intolerable twitches in our legs, rendering us aggressive and malicious with those members; or to be troubled with a similar uneasiness in our elbows, attended with fistic consequences to our neighbours; or to carry two pounds of lead in the chest, four pounds in the head, and several active blue-bottles in each ear. Yet, for certain, we suffered under those distresses, and were always charged at for labouring under them, {{as if we had}} brought them on, of our own deliberate act and deed.

50|$|In {{contrast}} to psychoanalytic theorists, cognitive <b>psychologists</b> <b>say</b> that linguistic slips can represent a sequencing conflict in grammar production.

Evolutionary <b>psychologists</b> <b>say</b> that animals from fiddler crabs to humans use eyesight for collision avoidance, suggesting that vision is basically for directing action, not providing knowledge.|$|R

50|$|Evolutionary psychologists {{consider}} Charles Darwin's {{theory of}} natural selection to be important {{to an understanding of}} psychology. Natural selection occurs because individual organisms who are genetically better suited to the current environment leave more descendants, and their genes spread through the population, thus explaining why organisms fit their environments so closely. This process is slow and cumulative, with new traits layered over older traits. The advantages created by natural selection are known as adaptations. Evolutionary <b>psychologists</b> <b>say</b> that animals, just as they evolve physical adaptations, evolve psychological adaptations.|$|R

50|$|According to Isabel Briggs Myers, a person's {{decision-making}} process depends {{to a significant}} degree on their cognitive style. Myers developed a set of four bi-polar dimensions, called the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI). The terminal points on these dimensions are: thinking and feeling; extroversion and introversion; judgment and perception; and sensing and intuition. She claimed that a person's decision-making style correlates well with how they score on these four dimensions. For example, someone who scored near the thinking, extroversion, sensing, and judgment ends of the dimensions would {{tend to have a}} logical, analytical, objective, critical, and empirical decision-making style. However, some <b>psychologists</b> <b>say</b> that the MBTI lacks reliability and validity and is poorly constructed.|$|R

5000|$|In {{his book}} [...] "Why Therapy Works," [...] Cozolino {{proposed}} {{his theory of}} Social Status Schema. This theory proposes that we are programmed early in life, via emotional experience he calls Core Shame, to act as alphas or betas in social groups.

Cozolino <b>says</b> that while <b>psychologists</b> most often interpret shame {{as the result of}} early negative life experiences, he suggests that core shame may be a psychological consequence of a deeper biological strategy of natural selection to organize us into a group hierarchy with a higher probability of survival.|$|R
50|$|Other researchers, such as Dr. Mary M. Wagner of SRI International, {{find these}} {{comparisons}} unpersuasive.

In fact, the Association of Black <b>Psychologists</b> <b>says</b> that 14 percent of America’s children are African-American, but that the percentage in foster care and/or awaiting adoption is 29 percent.

These categories were numerical, reasoning, spatial, perceptual, memory, verbal fluency and verbal comprehension. However Raymond B. Cattell in 1963 agreed with the concept theorized by Spearman but put forth his findings about intelligence analyses. His analyses were that intelligence is further subdivided in two divisions known as fluid and crystallized intelligence.|$|R
