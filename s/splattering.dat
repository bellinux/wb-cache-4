5|$|Infamous is an action-adventure game set {{in an open}} world {{environment}} and played from a third-person perspective where the player controls Cole and primarily interacts {{with the world of}} Empire City through Cole's newly gained electricity-based powers; these are used for movement, offense and defense in combat, and either for better or worse in dealing with the citizens of Empire City. In order for Cole to use his powers, he must have stored electrical power, represented by a node meter on the player's heads up display (HUD). The player can recharge Cole by draining electricity from powered sources or from living beings; recharging also restores Cole's health, which is indicated by blood <b>splattering</b> onto the screen. The more damage that Cole takes, the more blood that covers the screen. When Cole's health is at a critical level, the screen will turn black and white, and if Cole takes a little bit more damage while the screen is black and white, a heartbeat will be heard and will get slower and slower as Cole takes more damage, until it is beating dangerously slow. At this point, further damage to Cole will kill him. If the player stays out of battle long enough, Cole's health will regenerate over time. The game features seventeen different electrical powers, ranging from simple bolts that do not consume Cole's energy to wide-field lightning storms that drain most of Cole's energy. The player can use such powers, giving the player options in certain situations. For example, the player may fire at a generator near foes to cause it to explode and cripple his opponents, then restrain them or fire at the body to kill the enemy.|$|E

25|$|The {{first known}} {{suggestion}} for viewing randomness {{in terms of}} complexity was made by Leibniz in an obscure 17th-century document discovered after his death. Leibniz asked how one could know if a set of points {{on a piece of}} paper were selected at random (e.g. by <b>splattering</b> ink) or not. Given that for any set of finite points there is always a mathematical equation that can describe the points, (e.g. by Lagrangian interpolation) the question focuses on the way the points are expressed mathematically. Leibniz viewed the points as random if the function describing them had to be extremely complex. Three centuries later, the same concept was formalized as algorithmic randomness by A. N. Kolmogorov and Gregory Chaitin as the minimal length of a computer program needed to describe a finite string as random.|$|E
25|$|Xining was {{subjected}} to aerial bombardment by Japanese warplanes in 1941 during the Second-Sino Japanese War. The bombing spurred all ethnicities in Qinghai, including the local Qinghai Mongols and Qinghai Tibetans, against the Japanese. The Salar Muslim General Han Youwen directed {{the defense of the}} city of Xining during air raids by Japanese planes. Han survived an aerial bombardment by Japanese planes in Xining while he was being directed via telephone from Ma Bufang, who hid in an air raid shelter in a military barracks. The bombing resulted in human flesh <b>splattering</b> a Blue Sky with a White Sun flag and Han being buried in rubble. Han Youwen was dragged out of the rubble while bleeding and he managed to grab a machine gun while he was limping and fired back at the Japanese warplanes and cursed the Japanese as dogs in his native Salar language.|$|E

25|$|However, {{the charges}} were known for their vagueness and lack of {{concrete}} criteria, and many people were executed simply because of accusations or association with the former KMT government. In despite of this, by March 1951, many large cities implemented the campaign upon the urgings of Mao. Mao argued {{that as long as}} the campaign targeted despised figures of society, the mass populace would be incited to support the campaign. Though he initially wanted to avoid inviting people outside the party, Mao's predictions was correct. Much of the trials of accused counterrevolutionaries had popular turnout, being heavily advertised on radio, and many of the invited civilians participated in the trials themselves. Jung Chang noted that in Beijing alone there were some 30,000 rallies attended by over 3 million people, and in one such rally, 200 people were paraded and executed with their blood <b>splattering</b> out on bystanders, and trucks carrying blood-stained corpses drove through the streets.|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "How Will I Know", {{directed}} by Brian Grant and choreographed by Arlene Phillips, was filmed {{prior to the}} release of the single and album. Unlike her previous music videos, Houston was given the opportunity to move beyond the staged performance settings to demonstrate elementary dance moves. The video is set against a strikingly designed, vividly colored setting of video screens and partitions. Houston's hair is dyed a honey color, and is held up by a dazzling colored bow. She is also seen accented by a tight, sleeveless gray dress made of metal mesh, reaching almost to her knees, accessorized with matching arm-bracelets. Houston is also seen interacting with animated dancers, in black outfits and wearing French-style makeup. The video also has a scene of <b>splattering</b> of paint and it's dripping down the screen. Houston's label-mate and family friend Aretha Franklin also makes a cameo appearance in the music video. In 2011, Kyle Anderson of MTV wrote that the video was [...] "eye-opening to watch her cut loose in a fun environment," [...] since her previous songs were ballads.|$|E

In this laboratory-based experiment, which did not use human subjects, 100 intravenous catheters of the same type with a retraction mechanism, were tested for blood <b>splatter.</b> Once blood was obtained from a simulated brachial vein containing mock venous blood, the devices were placed in a testing chamber and scientific filters labeled A, B 2 ̆ 6 C were used to capture blood <b>splatter</b> after activation. The blood <b>splatter</b> was examined visually and microscopically, and the filters were weighed pre- and post-activation on an analytical scale. The research questions in this study were: 1) do retractable intravenous devices produce blood <b>splatter,</b> and 2) does blood <b>splatter</b> frequency differ between visual methods vs. microscopy? The differences in filter mass, visual inspection, and microscopic analysis for presence of blood on filters were the units of analysis. Descriptive statistics, paired t-tests to determine pre and post activation filter weights and kappa statistics to assess degree of agreement between methods were {{used to analyze the}} data. For filters B and C, the proportions with blood detected by the naked eye were 12 and 13...|$|R

500|$|Romeo Void has {{generally}} been classified as a new wave or post-punk band. Some critics have noted dance elements in the music.

[...] Alan Niester, writing for The Globe and Mail, said that he weaved [...] "in and out [...] like a snake charmer" [...] and reminded him of Andy Mackay, a saxophonist that played with Roxy Music.|$|E

This is a must-buy series." [...] Earning a B+ rating in a review from Entertainment Weekly, Ken Tucker writes that Simone [...] " [...] her Birds of Prey storytelling powers and focuses them on the newly revived Barbara Gordon as Batgirl.
