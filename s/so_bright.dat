5|$|Betelgeuse is {{travelling}} supersonically {{through the}} interstellar medium at a speed of 30km per second (i.e. ~6.3AU per year) creating a bow shock. The shock is not created by the star, but by its powerful stellar wind as it ejects vast amounts of gas into {{the interstellar medium}} at a speed of 17km/s, heating the material surrounding the star, thereby making it visible in infrared light. Because Betelgeuse is <b>so</b> <b>bright,</b> {{it was only in}} 1997 that the bow shock was first imaged. The cometary structure is estimated to be at least 1 parsec wide, assuming a distance of 643 light-years.|$|E
5|$|Under normal conditions, the Sun is <b>so</b> <b>bright</b> {{that it is}} {{difficult}} to stare at it directly. However, during an eclipse, with so much of the Sun covered, it is easier and more tempting to stare at it. Looking at the Sun during an eclipse is as dangerous as looking at it outside an eclipse, except during the brief period of totality, when the Sun's disk is completely covered (totality occurs only during a total eclipse and only very briefly; it does not occur during a partial or annular eclipse). Viewing the Sun's disk through any kind of optical aid (binoculars, a telescope, or even an optical camera viewfinder) is extremely hazardous and can cause irreversible eye damage within a fraction of a second.|$|E
5|$|The most {{prominent}} variable star in Auriga is Epsilon Aurigae (Al Maz, Almaaz), an F0 class {{eclipsing binary star}} with an unusually long period of 27 years; its last minima occurred in 1982–1984 and 2009–2011. The distance to the system is disputed, variously cited as 4600 and 2,170 light-years. The primary is a white supergiant, and the secondary may be itself a binary star within a large dusty disk. Its maximum magnitude is 3.0, but it stays at a minimum magnitude of 3.8 for around a year; its most recent eclipse began in 2009. The primary has an absolute magnitude of −8.5 and an unusually high luminosity of , the reason it appears <b>so</b> <b>bright</b> at such a great distance. Epsilon Aurigae is the longest-period eclipsing binary currently known. The first observed eclipse of Epsilon Aurigae occurred in 1821, though its variable status was not confirmed until the eclipse of 1847–48. From that time forward, many theories were put forth as {{to the nature of}} the eclipsing component. Epsilon Aurigae has a noneclipsing component, which is visible as a 14th magnitude companion separated from the primary by 28.6 arcseconds. It was discovered by Sherburne Wesley Burnham in 1891 at the Dearborn Observatory, and is about 0.5 light-years from the primary.|$|E

25|$|Fakhr Al-Din Al-Turaihi, a Muslim {{scholar who}} lived in the 17th Century C.E, {{believed}} that the archangel Gabriel {{is the head of the}} cherubim. A Hadith in Shiite tradition tells us that Muhammad heard cherubs wailing and crying with sympathy for sinners in Heaven during his night journey, known as Isra and Mi'raj. Other traditions say that cherubs are <b>so</b> <b>bright</b> that the light of one of them could suffice the whole world. When Moses asked God to show him his face, he made one of his cherubs shine upon the mountain, shattering it to pieces. According to this tradition, God was showing Moses that since he could not bear to look at a cherub, he would not be able to bear looking at God.|$|E

The king and his soldiers held guard without sleeping for 3600 years {{and as a matter}} of gratitute lord Indra king of devas ordered his chief engineer viswakarma to build the city on the same lines of amaravati. He also presented the king with sivalingam that he personally worshipped. The great Tamil work Silappathikaram says that in puhar ships creaked in with wealth from all 7 continents, that devas in guise of humans came and worshipped in its temples and that the nights were <b>so</b> <b>bright</b> that even a small grain of white lentil dropped in the beach sand could be spotted by naked eye.|$|E

500|$|In massive stars, fusion {{continues}} {{until the}} iron core has grown so large (more than 1.4 [...] ) {{that it can}} no longer support its own mass. This core will suddenly collapse as its electrons are driven into its protons, forming neutrons, neutrinos, and gamma rays in a burst of electron capture and inverse beta decay. The shockwave formed by this sudden collapse causes the rest of the star to explode in a supernova. Supernovae become <b>so</b> <b>bright</b> that they may briefly outshine the star's entire home galaxy. When they occur within the Milky Way, supernovae have historically been observed by naked-eye observers as [...] "new stars" [...] where none seemingly existed before.|$|E

With optimum conditions, 10,000stars are visible with the naked eye at the park, clouds appear only as black holes in the starry sky, and the Milky Way is <b>so</b> <b>bright</b> that it casts a discernible shadow. In contrast, big city residents can see a few dozen stars at best, and even those in rural areas can typically only see 2,000–3,000stars.

500|$|... "It's Not the End of the World?" [...] is 3 minutes 25 seconds {{long and}} is in the key of C major.

The first verse follows on 38 seconds with Rhys accompanied by a basic 4/4 beat provided by drummer Dafydd Ieuan, sparse bass guitar and a melody line played by Huw Bunford on guitar. The first chorus enters at 1 minute 4 seconds with Rhys singing the words [...] "as our hair turns white, all the stars still shine <b>so</b> <b>bright</b> above, at least it's {{not the end of the}} world" [...] while Bunford plays a guitar counter-melody. Another bridge and verse follow before the second chorus appears at 2 minutes 2 seconds with Rhys this time singing [...] "as our hair turns grey everything is far from A-A-A-ok".
