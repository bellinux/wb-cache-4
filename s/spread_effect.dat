50|$|The {{coloration}} {{effect is}} one of the phenomenal effects of watercolor illusions. Pinna and Reeves, (2006) identified thirteen properties of the coloration effect through experiments of the water color illusion. All of the main properties can be seen with any pair of complementary (opposite in color space) contour lines. However, from the experiment described above, purple and orange have been found to produce the strongest effects. The thirteen properties are: the stimulus (1) is uniform, (2) solid and (3) can be perceived on a white, black or, colored background (the background does not affect the experiment as the color <b>spread</b> <b>effect</b> is superimposed on it without any mixing). (4) The orange hue is best observed if the object contains wiggly lines, though it is perceived with straight or dotted lines. (5) The effect can work with all basic colors, though (6) the effect is shown better when the lines have a high luminance contrast. (7) The line with the less luminance to the background will always produce the coloration effect. For example the light orange line spreads to produce the color spreading effect. (8) If the lines were reversed and the orange was on the outside than the orange hue would appear to be penetrating outward of the object while the purple line would be on the inside. Some other properties are the following: (9) the coloration extends about 45 visual degrees (found in experiments listed above); (10) the coloration is complete by 100 millisecond the smallest possible measurable unit due to the experiment equipment; (11) the line width that produces the best coloration effect is 6 arc minutes; (12) the color also spreads in directions other than the line; (13) and lastly it can induce a complementary color when one of the lines is achromatic and the other is chromatic.|$|E
30|$|To summarize, the PNP-AlGaN {{junction}} for DUV LEDs are explored and demonstrated. Assisted by {{the proposed}} PNP-AlGaN junctions, the current <b>spreading</b> <b>effect</b> can be improved. The improved current <b>spreading</b> <b>effect</b> is well attributed to increased the vertical resistance and the enhanced horizontal current flow. Moreover, {{we have also}} conducted the parametric study to reveal different PNP-junctions on the current <b>spreading</b> <b>effect,</b> the EQE and the WPE. We find that by properly increasing the thickness, the doping concentration, the AlN composition for the n-AlGaN insertion layer, and the number for the PNP-AlGaN junction, the current <b>spreading</b> <b>effect</b> can be improved. On the other hand, we also find that the current <b>spreading</b> <b>effect</b> can indeed enhance the EQE. However, the forward voltage may be increased if the PNP-AlGaN junction is not fully optimized, the cost {{of which is the}} reduced WPE. It is also worthy pointing out that the current spreading feature is the cooperative function of the thickness, the doping concentration, the AlN composition for the n-AlGaN insertion layer, and the number for the PNP-AlGaN junction. As a result, there is no unique answer for the best design of the PNP-AlGaN current spreading layer for DUV LEDs. However, we strongly believe that the findings in this work introduce the additional physical understanding to the PNP-AlGaN current spreading layer and the current <b>spreading</b> <b>effect</b> for DUV LEDs. Hence, this work is very useful for the community of optical semiconductor devices.|$|R

Specifically, this study uses a fully 2 -D model that solves drift–diffusion and Poisson equations to investi-gate current flow paths and radiative recombination regions. The ray-tracing technique {{was used to}} calculate the LEE of the top surface. First, this study discusses the current <b>spreading</b> <b>effect</b> of the lateral and conventional vertical LED and determines the efficiency droop even with a transparent conducting layer. Dif-ferent electrode configurations in the vertical LED were tested to optimize the current <b>spreading</b> <b>effect,</b> which, in turn, suppresses the carrier leakage and mitigates the efficiency droop under high injection conditions.

We explored whether the changing flows of sales and purchases, spillovers and commuting between 1982 and 2006 suggested a dominance of <b>spread</b> <b>effects</b> or backwash effects.

We study the consequences of home-biased public procurement on international specialisation. Using a general-equilibrium model with a monopolistically competitive sector, we find that a country will specialise in that sector if it has relatively large home-biased procurement (the “pull ” effect). Furthermore, home-biased procurement can counter agglomeration forces in that sector and thereby attenuate the overall degree of international specialisation (the “spread ” effect). Our empirical analysis, conducted on inputoutput data for the European Union, yields supporting evidence for the pull effect and some support for the <b>spread</b> <b>effect.</b> MARIUS BRÜLHART, Ecole de Hautes Etudes Commerciales of the University of Lausanne...|$|E

It also includes some others factors in determining economic growth disparity such as Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita, the concentration of economic activity areas, Human Development Index (HDI), the labour productivity of the region, the allocation of public investment {{as well as the}} accessibility among regions in the Aceh Province. To capture the goals of this study, it uses panel data during the period 2000 to 2010 consisting of 23 districts/cities of Aceh Province. The results show that the potential conditions for convergence because the dominant factor affecting the disparity without entering variable cumulative effect, the concentration of economic activity among regions have positive and negatively affected HDI. By entering variable cumulative effects, it turns HDI to have a negative effect, while the cumulative effect of the growth of inter-regional and the GDP per capita were positive. Thus, {{it can be said that}} the economic disparity among regions has the potential for convergence if and only if there is a policy intervention by the government in improving the quality of education, health, and consumer purchasing power to reduce the disparity.

40|$|Restricted until 25 Mar. 2010. High quality {{broadband}} {{services in}} mobile environments {{is essential for}} the next generation wireless communication system. Multiuser OFDM systems provide promising multiaccess techniques for high data rate transmission applications. However, in mobile environments, the Doppler <b>spread</b> <b>effect</b> or the carrier frequency offset (CFO) tend to destroy orthogonality among neighboring subcarriers and also among different users resulting in intercarrier interference (ICI) and Multiaccess interference (MAI) that severely degrade the performance of the system. Without efficient MAI and ICI suppression techniques in a mobile environment, one may resort to more complicated equalization and multiuser detection (MUD) techniques. As a result the receiver design for mobile multiuser OFDM systems is not simple. However, judicious code design in the transmitter of the multiuser OFDM systems, can either directly suppress MAI and ICI or help lower the complexity of multiuser detection techniques so that a low cost receiver is possible.; The code design problem to reduce MAI among multiple users is extensively studied in this work. First, the performance of a precoded multiuser OFDM (PMU-OFDM) system in a fast time-varying channel is evaluated and the criterion for the codeword design to suppress MAI and ICI is derived. In particular, it is proven that the use of M= 2 even or the M= 2 odd codewords of the M Hadamard-Walsh (HW) codes reduce the MAI due to the Doppler <b>spread</b> <b>effect</b> to a negligible amount. Later, the performance of two orthogonal codes for an MAI-free multicarrier CDMA (MC-CDMA) system in a CFO environment is studied in detail. It is shown that a proper subset of HW or carrier interferometry (CI) codewords achieves an MAI-free MC-CDMA system in the presence of CFO. Finally, it is demonstrated that employing CI codes for a fully-loaded MC-CDMA in a CFO environment leads to a sparse cross-correlation channel matrix that can be utilized to lower the complexity of the maximum likelihood, the parallel interference cancellation (PIC) and the decorrelating multiuser detectors...|$|E

Hence, one contribution {{of this paper is to}} test the effects of aggregation and scale on the identification of regional inequalities. Spatial data analysis is employed to examine the spatial dimension of inequality in Turkey and the relationship between spatial dependence and the dynamics of growth. The results indicate that overall inequalities are decreasing, however spatial dependence is becoming more dominant. The Theil index indicates that interregional inequalities are increasing while intra-regional inequalities are declining for all spatial partitions from 1980 to 1997.

40|$|The {{use of a}} {{transverse}} gradient undulator (TGU) {{is viewed}} as an attractive option for free-electron lasers (FELs) driven by beams with a large energy spread.

Our analysis, which includes the fundamental and the higher-order FEL eigenmodes, can provide {{an estimate of the}} mode content for the output radiation.
