5|$|With {{the ending}} of the oppressive State Security Law period in 2000, Rajab was able to begin working openly in the field of Human rights as {{one of the founders of}} the Bahrain Human Rights Society, one of the first human rights {{organizations}} in Bahrain. He subsequently fell out with some of the other founders. In 2002, following wide ranging political reforms by the Bahraini government which allowed independent human rights groups to operate, Rajab worked with Abdulhadi al-Khawaja and others to found the Bahrain Centre for Human Rights (BCHR), a nonprofit non-governmental organization which works to promote human rights in Bahrain. Rajab was Training Program Officer and <b>Senior</b> <b>Researcher</b> at BCHR. He later became Vice President and Head of International Relations until he later took over from Abdulhadi Alkhawaja as BCHR president, a position he still held as of August 2012. In 2011 he along with other found the Gulf Center for Human Rights. Rajab became the president of the newly found rights group.|$|E
5|$|In the 1950s, Butinov and Knorozov had {{performed}} a {{statistical analysis of}} several rongorongo texts and had concluded that either {{the language of the}} texts was not Polynesian, or that it was written in a condensed telegraphic style, because it contained no glyphs comparable in frequency to Polynesian grammatical particles such as the Rapanui articles te and he or the preposition ki. These findings have since been used to argue that rongorongo is not a writing system at all, but mnemonic proto-writing. However, Butinov and Knorozov had used Barthel's preliminary encoding, which Konstantin Pozdniakov, <b>senior</b> <b>researcher</b> at the Museum of Anthropology and Ethnography of the Russian Academy of Sciences in Saint Petersburg (until 1996), noted was inappropriate for statistical analysis. The problem, as Butinov and Knorozov, and Barthel himself, had admitted, was that in many cases distinct numerical codes had been assigned to ligatures and allographs, as if these were independent glyphs. The result was that while Barthel's numerical transcription of a text enabled a basic discussion of its contents for the first time, it failed to capture its linguistic structure and actually interfered with inter-text comparison.|$|E

25|$|David Pimentel, {{professor}} of ecology and agriculture at Cornell University, and Mario Giampietro, <b>senior</b> <b>researcher</b> at the National Research Institute on Food and Nutrition (INRAN), {{place in their}} study Food, Land, Population and the U.S. Economy the maximum U.S. population for a sustainable economy at 200 million. To achieve a sustainable economy world population {{will have to be}} reduced by two-thirds, says the study. Without population reduction, this study predicts an agricultural crisis beginning in 2020, becoming critical c. 2050. The peaking of global oil along with the decline in regional natural gas production may precipitate this agricultural crisis sooner than generally expected. Dale Allen Pfeiffer claims that coming decades could see spiraling food prices without relief and massive starvation on a global level such as never experienced before.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis study {{attempts}} {{to examine how}} some writers are more successful than others in writing scientific papers in English, in non-English speaking societies. To do so, {{interviews were conducted with}} 10 Iranian university teachers‘of TEFL: 5 junior, 2 middle-ranking and 3 <b>senior</b> <b>researchers.</b> The analysis is concerned not only with their difficulties, but also with their strategies to cope with them. Findings show that identification of their audience may distinguish <b>senior</b> <b>researchers</b> from others. Another important characteristic seems to be their learning strategies, and these strategies are divided into two categories. The first one focuses on reading academic papers in their field to learn typical writing patterns. This strategy was followed by all. The second involves giving direct attention to mastering English speakers’ language use, but these were employed by only 2 junior and 3 <b>senior</b> <b>researchers.</b> Half of these researchers seem to prefer simply to cope with their English. Efforts to adopt the second type, however, would appear to be successful in the long run...|$|R
