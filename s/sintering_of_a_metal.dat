Laser induced melting and resolidification accompanied by shrinkage are modeled using a temperature transforming model. The liquid flow of the melted low melting point metal driven by capillary and gravity forces is also included in the physical model. Both complete and partial shrinkages are considered in the model. Simulations are performed for both single line laser scanning and multiple-line laser scanning. The numerical results are compared with experimental results and a detailed parametric study is performed. The effects of the moving heat source intensity, the scanning velocity, the thickness of the powder layer and the number of existing sintered layers underneath on the sintering depth, the shape of the heat affected zone (HAZ) and the temperature distribution are discussed. The optimized dimensionless moving heat source intensity increases with increasing scanning velocity in order to achieve the desired sintering depth and bond the newly sintered layer to the previously sintered layers...|$|E

40|$|Two of {{the major}} {{problems}} in powder technology are cracking of the parts during die pressing and shape distortions during sintering, the latter being more severe the more the material shrinks. Limitations to the geometrical accuracy of the parts arise also from the (anisotropic) spring-back during unloading and ejection after pressing. These problems are addressed by finite element modelling. First, phenomenological and micromechanical models for powder compaction during die pressing are described including one with evolving anisotropy. Second, crack formation during pressing and ejection is modelled as a strain localization process in the finite element simulation. Third, a model for liquid phase sintering is described, which includes particle rearrangement, contact flattening by the solution/precipitation mechanism and grain coarsening. Finally the feasibility of the whole approach is demonstrated by simulating the pressing and <b>sintering</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> hard <b>metal</b> cutting tool and comparing pre dicted distortions with measured values...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{a simple}} and economical method for producing free-form microchannels in metal bodies. The concept for our process {{is based on a}} microscopic infiltration phenomenon that often occurs during liquid phase <b>sintering</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> mixture <b>of</b> <b>metal</b> powders with different melting points. <b>A</b> shaped compound <b>of</b> the metal powder with lower melting point and an organic binder are used as the sacrificial core that gives the shape <b>of</b> the microchannel. <b>A</b> body-metal powder compact that includes the sacrificial core is sintered at a temperature between the melting points of the sacrificial-core metal and body metal. The organic binder is removed during heating of the powder compact, and infiltration of molten sacrificial-core metal into the body-metal powder produces a microchannel and a lining layer. We examined following combinations of metal powders: titanium-aluminum, nickel-aluminum, copper-tin, and iron-copper. Metallographic observations confirmed that microchannels were produced in the metallic bodies in all these systems. Furthermore, {{in the case of the}} titanium body <b>metal</b> with <b>an</b> Al-Cu alloy sacrificial-core metal, the inner wall of the microchannel was smoother than the case of titaniumwith aluminum.
