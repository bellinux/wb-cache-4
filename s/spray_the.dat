40|$|AbstractA laser 2 -focus {{velocimeter}} (L 2 F) {{has been}} applied for measurements of velocity and size of droplets in diesel <b>sprays.</b> <b>The</b> maximum data acquisition rate of 15 MHz has been achieved by using FPGA in order to capture every droplet which appears in the micro-scale measurement volume. A method of evaluating the mass flow rate of droplets was proposed, and the distance between droplets was adopted {{as an indicator of}} the number density of droplets and the heterogeneous structure of <b>sprays.</b> <b>The</b> diesel fuel <b>spray</b> was injected intermittently into the atmosphere by using a 5 -hole injector nozzle. The orifice diameter of the injector nozzle was 0. 113 mm, and the injection pressure was set at 40 MPa by using a common rail system. Measurements were conducted in <b>the</b> <b>spray</b> on 10 planes from 5 to 25 mm downstream from the nozzle exit. It was shown that the velocity of droplet was the highest at <b>the</b> <b>spray</b> center and decreased towards <b>the</b> <b>spray</b> periphery. <b>The</b> size of droplet at <b>the</b> <b>spray</b> center decreased downstream and that at spray periphery increased downstream. The mass flow rate near <b>the</b> <b>spray</b> center was larger than that in <b>the</b> <b>spray</b> periphery region.

40|$|Traditional {{sprayers}} adopt large-area uniform pesticide application, {{resulting in}} a low effective utilisation of pesticide and a harmful effect to the natural environment. Variable-rate <b>spray</b> is <b>the</b> key point to precision chemical application. However, {{it is inevitable that}} <b>the</b> <b>spray</b> pressure sharply fluctuates during variable-rate spray, which will definitely influence <b>the</b> <b>spray</b> characteristics, such as spray droplet sizes, spray angles, spray droplet velocities, etc., and reduce the efficiency of pesticide applications. Therefore, the research on how to keep <b>the</b> <b>spray</b> pressure constant during the process of variable- rate spray has practical significance to precision pesticide applications. In order to achieve <b>the</b> stability of <b>spray</b> pressure for variable- rate spray, a sprayer with constant-pressure control was set up using a closed-loop proportion integration differentiation (PID) controller of constant-pressure water-supply, which employed the techniques of single-phase alternating current (AC) chopper variablevoltage control and PID feedback regulation. Using hollow-cone nozzles, <b>the</b> <b>spray</b> volume was changed by adjusting spray pressure, frequency, and duty cycle of electromagnetic valve switching. <b>The</b> <b>spray</b> features concerning <b>the</b> <b>spray</b> angle and <b>the</b> <b>spray</b> volume distribution were studied in laboratory. The conclusions are as follows: i) for a given input <b>spray</b> pressure, <b>the</b> closed-loop controller with AC chopper and PID feedback regulation can effectively control the pressure fluctuations during <b>the</b> variable-rate <b>spray</b> through varying <b>the</b> frequency and the duty cycle; ii) <b>the</b> <b>spray</b> angle was slightly affected by the flow-rate change through adjusting the frequency and the duty cycle of electromagnetic valves or changing the number of open nozzles. <b>The</b> <b>spray</b> angle changes were controlled within the range of the maximum deviation 0. 87 ° from mean value and the minimum deviation 0. 03 ° from mean value; iii) when <b>the</b> <b>spray</b> pressure was set as 0. 3 Mpa, the peak radial position of <b>the</b> <b>spray</b> volume distribution basically unchanged and <b>the</b> <b>spray</b> volume and <b>the</b> peak values of <b>the</b> <b>spray</b> distribution gradually increased with the increasing duty cycle.

25|$|As oranges are {{sensitive}} to frost, there are different methods to prevent frost damage to crops and trees when subfreezing temperatures are expected. A common process is to <b>spray</b> <b>the</b> trees with water so as to cover them with {{a thin layer of}} ice that will stay just at the freezing point, insulating them even if air temperatures drop far lower. This is because water continues to lose heat as long as the environment is colder than it is, and so the water turning to ice in the environment cannot damage the trees. This practice, however, offers protection only for a very short time. Another procedure is burning fuel oil in smudge pots put between the trees. These devices burn {{with a great deal of}} particulate emission, so condensation of water vapour on the particulate soot prevents condensation on plants and raises the air temperature very slightly. Smudge pots were developed for the first time after a disastrous freeze in Southern California in January 1913 destroyed a whole crop.|$|E
