Entries {{are divided into}} four major categories: the school system (204 items), preschool education (15 items), elementary education (48 items). and secondary education (16 items). Each category is then subdivid"d into (1) general concepts, (2) models of actual programs, and (3) training guides and manuals. There are no entries under the third subdivision for either elementary or secondary education. Titles which are highly recommended for trainers and trainers of trainers are marked with an asterisk and also listed separately. An alphabetical index of titles is appended.

40|$|This {{document}} repeats contribution 199 from interim meeting, {{where it}} was agreed with consensus that this document should be forwarded to ITU as American VDSL requirements. The ITU Boston meeting {{did not have time}} to review it, so we submitted it again through SG B, since it had consensus agreement, as a US position. Apparently, some companies reconsidered their endorsement at Study Group B meeting last week. This contribution can go to ITU as company or US position or not at all as the group decides. However, the editor requests we decide whether T 1 E 1. 4 has requirements with consensus support or not.

5000|$|XIV Corps held {{a conference}} of divisional commanders on 14 June and Cavan {{emphasised}} the importance of using the new manuals (SS 135, SS 143 and Fifth Army <b>document</b> <b>S.G.</b> 671 1) in planning the offensive. Discussion followed on {{the means by which}} the Guards Division and 38th Division were to meet the army commander's intent. The decision to patrol towards the red line, was left to the discretion of divisional commanders. An attack of this nature was not a breakthrough operation; the German defensive position [...] lay 10000 - 12000 yd behind the front line and would not be attacked on the first day but it was more ambitious than Plumer's plan, which had involved an advance of 1000 - 1750 yd. Notes were later sent to the divisions, from the next army conference held on 19 June.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The {{aim of this}} {{systematic}} {{study was}} to investigate patient outcomes and nutritional deficiencies following sleeve gastrectomy (SG) during a median follow-up of two years. Methods Over a period of 56 [*]months, all consecutive patients who underwent <b>SG</b> were <b>documented</b> in this prospective, single-center, observational study. The study endpoints included complication rates, nutritional deficiencies and percentage of excess weight loss (%EWL). Results From September 26, 2005 to May 28, 2009, 100 patients (female: male[*]=[*] 59 : 41) {{with a mean age of}} 43. 6 [*]years (range: 22 – 64) and a preoperative BMI of 52. 3 [*]kg/² (range: 36 – 77) underwent SG. The mean operative time was 86. 4 [*]min (range: 35 – 275). Major complications were observed in 8. 0 [*]% of the patients. During the follow-up period, 25 patients (25. 0 [*]%) underwent a second bariatric intervention (22 DS and 3 RYGBP). Out of the total 100 patients, 48 [*]% were supplemented with iron, 33 [*]% with zinc, 34 [*]% with a combination of calcium carbonate and cholecalciferol, 24 [*]% with vitamin D, 42 [*]% with vitamin B 12 and 40 [*]% with folic acid. The patients who received only a SG (n[*]=[*] 75) had %EWL of 53. 6, 65. 8 and 62. 6 [*]% after 6, 12 and 24 [*]months, respectively. Conclusions SG is a highly effective bariatric intervention for morbidly obese patients. Nutritional deficiencies resulting from the procedure can be detected by routine nutritional screening. Results of the study show that Vitamin B 12 supplementation should suggested routinely. </p...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{a snapshot of}} 19 diverse school settings that have committed themselves to whole-school reform to make a meaningful {{difference in the lives}} of their students. The schools in this study reflect schools across the country and represent various levels of readiness. Earlier findings in these schools indicated that "although schools are attending to many things, many of them are not attending to matters that make a difference in the way schools operate and in the outcomes for students. " Using Hord's five-dimensional model as a comprehensive design, the study's findings indicate that the key factor in whole-school reform is the leadership of the principal. Leadership practices in high-readiness schools were more effective than those in low-readiness schools in all areas under study: shared leadership, inspired responsibility for a shared vision, empowered decision-making, and inclusivity of staff. Principals in high-readiness schools were not coercive or controlling; they shared leadership, imaging it in the likeness of new conceptions of leadership. These principals were selective in their focus on a shared vision. Some elicited the dreams of others, while some shared their own visions and sought to mobilize efforts accordingly.
