5|$|Philosophically, the Smarta {{tradition}} {{emphasizes that}} all idols (murti) are icons to help focus on and visualize aspects of Brahman, rather than distinct beings. The ultimate goal in {{this practice is}} to transition past the use of icons, recognize the Absolute symbolized by the icons, {{on the path to}} realizing the nondual identity of one's Atman (soul, <b>self)</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Brahman. Popularized by Adi Shankara, many Panchayatana mandalas and temples have been uncovered that are from the Gupta Empire period, and one Panchayatana set from the village of Nand (about 24 kilometers from Ajmer) has been dated to belong to the Kushan Empire era (pre-300 CE). The Kushan period set includes Shiva, Vishnu, Surya, Brahma and one deity whose identity is unclear.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Imoen and Irenicus {{have been}} removed to an asylum called Spellhold, which is {{situated}} on an island. But Irenicus soon breaks his bonds and prepares to experiment on Imoen. Back in Athkatla, the party raises the money necessary and receives assistance from whichever organization it has decided to work with, and gains passage to the island on a ship sailed by Saemon Havarian. The heroes then manage to get inside Spellhold, but are there captured by Irenicus, who has taken control of the prison and had planned all along to bring the protagonist there. Irenicus subjects the protagonist to a ritual which takes the protagonist's soul. Imoen, who is revealed to also be a Child of Bhaal, has already been subjected to Irenicus's ritual, and her soul has gone to Irenicus's sister Bodhi. Bodhi then abandons the party to the maze beneath Spellhold so she may hunt them. When they face her, the now soulless protagonist loses self-control and transforms into a creature called the Slayer, one of the avatar forms of Bhaal, which scares off Bodhi. The hero returns to their normal <b>self,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> party battles Irenicus, forcing him to retreat. The party follows, and reaches the surface via the Underdark.|$|E

25|$|Unlike saints who {{recognized}} and preached {{a diversity of}} doctrines for self / God realisation and offered multiple paths to attain them, Nigamananda suggested the realisation of the oneness of <b>self</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> supreme universal self (or Parabrahman-परंब्रह्म) as the true and the highest goal of human life.|$|E
25|$|In August 2007 Blanke's lab {{published}} research in Science demonstrating that conflicting visual-somatosensory input in virtual reality could disrupt the spatial unity between the <b>self</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> body. During multisensory conflict, participants {{felt as if}} a virtual body seen {{in front of them}} was their own body and mislocalized themselves toward the virtual body, to a position outside their bodily borders. This indicates that spatial unity and bodily self-consciousness can be studied experimentally and is based on multisensory and cognitive processing of bodily information.|$|E
25|$|The {{three major}} schools of Hindu {{philosophy}} {{agree that the}} jiva (individual self) is related to Brahman (Self/God) but they differ in their explanations {{of the nature of}} this relationship. In Advaita Vedanta, the individual <b>self</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Self are deemed to be one and the same. Dvaita rejects this concept of identity and instead identifies the self (jiva) as a separate but similar part of Self, that only becomes one with the Absolute Atman upon Self Realisation (Moksha). Visishtadvaita explains that the nature of the self (jiva) and Brahman (God) is that the jiva is God with attributes; this essentially means that the jiva is both different and the same as God concurrently. Visishtadvaita (Attributive Monism) is thus similar to Achintya Bhedābeda Tattva (Inconceivable Difference-Non difference Reality). For an atheistic and dualistic view of the jiva and Ātman in ancient Hindu philosophy, see Samkhya one of the six schools of Indian Philosophy.|$|E

25|$|After the Restoration, as Dryden quickly {{established}} himself as the leading poet and literary critic of his day, he transferred his allegiances to the new government. Along with Astraea Redux, Dryden welcomed the new regime with two more panegyrics: To His Sacred Majesty: A Panegyric on his Coronation (1662) and To My Lord Chancellor (1662). These poems suggest that Dryden was looking to court a possible patron, but he was to instead make a living in writing for publishers, not for the aristocracy, and thus ultimately for the reading public. These, and his other nondramatic poems, are occasional—that is, they celebrate public events. Thus they are written for the nation rather than the <b>self,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Poet Laureate (as he would later become) is obliged to write {{a certain number of}} these per annum. In November 1662 Dryden was proposed for membership in the Royal Society, and he was elected an early fellow. However, Dryden was inactive in Society affairs and in 1666 was expelled for non-payment of his dues.|$|E
25|$|The {{meaning of}} waidan derives from wai (outside, exterior) and dan {{referring}} to alchemical operations, {{such as the}} preparation of chemical elixirs, made from cinnabar, realgar, and other substances generally involving mercury, sulfur, lead, and arsenic or else the animal and botanical products which are found in Chinese herbology and Traditional Chinese medicine. Waidan refers to practices relating {{to the process of}} making an elixir often containing herbal or chemical substances found outside of the body. This process involves esoteric oral instructions, building a laboratory, kindling and sustaining the special fires used in the production process, rules of seclusion and purification for the alchemist to follow, and various practices including the performance of ceremonies to protect the <b>self</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> ritual area. Waidan can also include following a dietary regimen which prescribes or proscribes certain foods. Preparing medicines and elixirs can be referred to as outer practices or waidan as these practices occur outside of the body until they are verified by the ingestion of medicines, herbs, and pills to bring about physical changes within the body, separate to the soul.|$|E
25|$|Identity fusion, a {{psychological}} construct rooted in social psychology and cognitive anthropology, {{is a form}} of alignment with groups in which members experience a visceral sense of oneness with the group. The construct relies on a distinction between the personal <b>self</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> social self. The personal self refers to the characteristics that make someone a unique person (e.g., tall, old, intelligent), while the social self pertains to the characteristics that align the person with groups (e.g., American, fraternity brother, student council member, etc.). As the name suggests, identity fusion involves the union of the personal and social selves. When fusion occurs, both the personal and social selves remain salient and influential but the boundaries between them become highly permeable. In addition, the theory proposes that fused persons come to regard other group members as “family” and develop strong relational ties to them as well as ties to the collective. Therefore, fused persons are not just bound to the collective; they are tied to the individual members of the collective.|$|E

25|$|The BBC novel The Eight Doctors {{was written}} by {{respected}} Doctor Who writer Terrance Dicks, the same author who wrote The Five Doctors. In it, he tries to reconcile the continuity errors of the 1996 movie, while having the Eighth Doctor meet and interact with each of his previous selves, although the Eighth Doctor visited each incarnation {{one at a time}} rather than all eight of them appearing in the same place. Later Eighth Doctor novel Interference – Book One sees the Eighth Doctor briefly meeting the Third, although this occasion results in the Doctor unwittingly changing his own history so that the Third Doctor will regenerate ahead of schedule (A change that is later 'reset' in the novel The Ancestor Cell thanks to the TARDIS taking action to preserve the original history). In the Past Doctor Adventures, the novel Heart of TARDIS features the Second and Fourth Doctors dealing with two different ends of the same crisis, with the Second Doctor trapped in a dimensional anomaly created by a government experiment and the Fourth recruited to stop the experiment destroying the world, but although they are at one point both in the Second Doctor's TARDIS, the Fourth Doctor and his companion hide {{on the opposite side of}} the console from his past <b>self</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Second is never aware of his future self. In The Colony of Lies, the Second Doctor briefly interacts with the Seventh Doctor in a VR simulation, but it is unspecified if this is the actual Seventh Doctor or just a VR program he left to advise his past self. In Wolfsbane, like in Heart of TARDIS, the Fourth and Eighth Doctors deal with separate ends of the same crisis, the Eighth stopping the threat in November 1936 while the Fourth ties up loose ends in December of the same year, but the two incarnations never meet directly, and due to the Eighth Doctor's current amnesia none of the other characters realize that the two Doctors are the same person.|$|E
500|$|Concurrent with Bogaert's {{suggestion}} that understanding asexuality {{will lead to}} a better understanding of sexuality overall, he discusses the topic of asexual masturbation to theorize on asexuals and [...] "'target-oriented' paraphilia, in which there is an inversion, reversal, or disconnection between the <b>self</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> typical target/object of sexual interest/attraction" [...] (such as attraction to oneself, labelled [...] "automonosexualism").|$|E
500|$|The Upanishads {{describe}} the universe, {{and the human}} experience, as an interplay of Purusha (the eternal, unchanging principles, consciousness) and Prakṛti (the temporary, changing material world, nature).

500|$|An {{additional}} {{similarity between}} The Word for World Is Forest and [...] "Vaster than Empires" [...] {{is the theme}} of first contact between humans and a new environment. In [...] "Vaster than Empires," [...] the forest is both the setting for the story and a character in it. The forest directly responds to the humans with fear, a response that is similar to the response of Osden, the empath, to the rest of society: [...] "the normal defensive-aggressive reaction between strangers meeting." [...] Thus Le Guin makes an analogy between contact between humans and aliens, and contact between individual humans; both are contact between the <b>self</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> [...] "other." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{scholar and}} {{translator}} Roy Liuzza commented that Tolkien's essay [...] "is usually credited with re-establishing the fabulous elements and heroic combats {{at the center}} of the modern reader's appreciation of the poem." [...] Liuzza at once went on to write, however, that [...] "the separation of the poem into 'mythical' and 'historical' elements is a false dichotomy". He argues that if myth can condense and hold the deepest sources of tension between <b>self</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> social order, and dramatises current ideologies by projecting them into the past, then even the hero Beowulf's mythic fights are at the same time throwing light on society and history.|$|E
