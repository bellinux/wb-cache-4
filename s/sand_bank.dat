She then sailed upstream, reaching Rustschuk on 11 October, and Giurgiu two days later. On 14 October, she was deployed at Lom. She was the last Austro-Hungarian monitor to withdraw towards Budapest and {{was the only one that}} failed to reach the city.

5|$|The RAF made {{a second}} attempt on 29 October, after {{the ship was}} moored off Håkøya Island outside Tromsø. Thirty-two Lancasters {{attacked}} the ship with Tallboys during Operation Obviate. As on Operation Paravane, No. 9 Squadron and No. 617 Squadron carried out the attack together, which resulted in only one near miss, partially the result of bad weather over the target. The underwater explosion damaged the port rudder and shaft and caused some flooding. Tirpitzs 38cm fragmentation shells proved ineffective in countering the high-level bombers; one aircraft was damaged by ground-based anti-aircraft guns. Following the attack, the ship's anchorage was significantly improved. A large <b>sand</b> <b>bank</b> was constructed under and around the ship to prevent her from capsizing, and anti-torpedo nets were installed. Tirpitz retained a one-degree list to port from earlier damage, and this was not corrected by counter-flooding to retain as much reserve buoyancy as possible. The ship was also prepared {{for her role as}} a floating artillery platform: fuel was limited to only what was necessary to power the turbo-generators, and the crew was reduced to 1,600 officers and enlisted men.|$|E

40|$|<b>Sand</b> <b>banks</b> and <b>sand</b> {{waves are}} two types of sand {{structures}} that are commonly observed on an off-shore sea bed. We describe the formation of these features using the equations of the fluid motion coupled with the mass conservation law for the sediment transport. The bottom features are a result of an instability due to tide–bottom interactions. There are at least two mechanisms responsible for the growth of <b>sand</b> <b>banks</b> and <b>sand</b> waves. One is linear instability, and the other is nonlinear coupling between long <b>sand</b> <b>banks</b> and short <b>sand</b> waves. One novel feature of this work is the suggestion that the latter is more important for the generation of <b>sand</b> <b>banks.</b> We derive nonlinear amplitude equations governing the coupled dynamics of sand waves and <b>sand</b> <b>banks.</b> Based on these equations, we estimate characteristic features for <b>sand</b> <b>banks</b> and find that the estimates are consistent with measurements...|$|R

500|$|On 19January 1918, Yavuz and {{the light}} cruiser , which had also been {{transferred}} to Ottoman service under the name Midilli, sailed from the Dardanelles to attack several British monitors stationed outside. The ships quickly sank [...] and [...] before {{turning back to the}} safety of the Dardanelles. While en route, Midilli struck five mines and sank, while Yavuz hit three mines and began to list to port. The ship's captain gave an incorrect order to the helmsman, which caused the ship to run aground. Yavuz remained there for almost a week, until Turgut Reis and several other vessels arrived on the scene on 22January; the ships spent four days trying to free Yavuz from the <b>sand</b> <b>bank,</b> including using the turbulence from their propellers to clear sand away from under the ship. By the morning of 26 January, Yavuz came free from the sandbank and Turgut Reis escorted her back into the Dardanelles.|$|E

The little babies died, and the old and weak died, and the wounded died. And worst of all, we had no water to quench our thirst, and for two days the sun beat down on us, and there was no shade. Many men and women waded out into the ocean and were drowned, the surf casting their bodies back on the beach. And there came a pest of flies. Some men swam to the sides of the schooners, but they were shot to the last one.

60|$|As for Blackbeard {{and those}} who were with him, they were that much richer, for there were so many the fewer pockets to fill.

About that time a royal proclamation had been issued offering pardon to all pirates in arms who would surrender to the king's authority before a given date.
