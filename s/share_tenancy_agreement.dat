40|$|Marshall's {{analysis}} of <b>share</b> <b>tenancy</b> leads to different {{and in some}} ways contradictory conclusions in terms of assessment of efficiency, according to the prevailing market conditions. The chapter argues that, {{as a consequence of the}} recent analysis carried out by many economists, the theory states that within <b>share</b> <b>tenancy</b> <b>agreements,</b> which are flexible in space and time, tenants may farm the land under weaker constraints and may also take into account their family's needs; at the same time, landlords may increase the value of their assets negotiating improvements on land by means of farmers' work. This analysis implies substantial criticisms to any law that forbids new sharecropping arrangements...|$|R

For example, a house in multiple occupation may have private bedrooms and shared communal areas: if five occupants share such a property with individual <b>tenancy</b> <b>agreements</b> then they may require up to five television licences if each private room contains a television receiver, while a similar property housing five occupants under a joint <b>tenancy</b> <b>agreement</b> may require only one television licence.|$|R

40|$|Reverse <b>share</b> <b>tenancy,</b> wherein poorer landlords {{rent out}} land to richer tenants on shares, {{is a common}} phenomenon. Yet it does not fit ex-isting {{theoretical}} models of sharecropping and has never before been modeled in the economics literature. We explain <b>share</b> <b>tenancy</b> con-tracts using an asset risk model that incorporates Marshallian ineffi-ciency and thereby provides a credible explanation for <b>share</b> <b>tenancy</b> more broadly, reverse tenancy included. When choosing the terms of an agrarian contract, the landlord considers the impact of her choice on the probability that she will retain future rights to the rented land. Thus, this model captures the effect of tenure insecurity and property rights on agrarian contracts. Among the main testable implications of the theoretical model are that, as property rights become more se-cure, reverse tenancy tends to disappear and that kin contracts tend to make <b>share</b> <b>tenancy</b> more likely...|$|R

40|$|The land-tenure {{systems in}} rural Asia have been {{experiencing}} {{more or less}} changes due to land policy and rapid technological progress under population pressure. The changes have been most significant in transforming the traditional <b>share</b> <b>tenancy</b> system. This is because some Asian countries have made efforts to abolish the traditional system, regarding it as a tenant-exploiting and econo-mically inefficient one. But actual conditions are different from such a point of view, particularly in case of reciprocal <b>share</b> <b>tenancy</b> and this type of tenancy system is still widely observed in rural Asia. Tenant farmers sometimes even refuse to transfer it to the modern type. Then, why is the <b>share</b> <b>tenancy</b> system prefered in many cases? This is a main theme of this paper. We {{are not able to}} answer this ploblem by the analysis using existing modern economic theories. Mecmwhile, {{it is very difficult to}} construct the new relevant theory at a stretch. So, at the first step, I will seek the fundamental factors to regulate the <b>share</b> <b>tenancy</b> system by reexa-mining economic theories of <b>share</b> <b>tenancy.</b> I begin with an account of classical and neoclassical view. Then I go no to deal with Cheung's challenge to these views, and the critics to Cheung theory, showing what kind of factors are important in understanding the reciprocal <b>share</b> <b>tenancy.</b> I next turn attention to economic aspects of bargaining and imperfect information which have been failed to notice, Finally, I suggest the way of reconstracting the more relevant theory...|$|R

40|$|For {{more than}} 2 centuries, economists have been {{interested}} in agricultural contracts, especially landowner-tenant contracts. The early work by Marshall (1890) argued that <b>share</b> <b>tenancy</b> was inefficient relative to owner cultivation and should not be expected to persist when other arrangements are available. Later D. Gale Johnson (1950) and Cheung (1969) argued that, if landowners can costlessly monitor and enforce tenants’ effort, then <b>share</b> <b>tenancy</b> can compete effectively with owner cultivation or cash rental. Subsequently, Stiglitz (1974) and Newberry and Stiglitz (1979) introduced principal-agent models in the more realistic case where monitoring is costly to study optimal landowner-tenant risk sharing given the need to study adequate tenant incentives. More recently, Prendergast (2002) suggested that the negative trade-off between effort incentives and risk is tenuous or wrong in principal-agent contracting, including <b>share</b> <b>tenancy</b> in agriculture. Allen and Lueck (2002) have also argued against risk sharing as a motive for <b>share</b> <b>tenancy</b> in developed countries {{because of the presence of}} well-developed instruments for risk sharing that are available regardless of tenancy arrangements. Based on transactions costs, they predict that cash rental is more likely than share rental when farmland value is low...|$|R

This paper examines the geography of farm <b>tenancy</b> <b>agreements</b> in England since 1995 and presents some findings from postal and telephone surveys on the possible future business trajectories of tenant farmers and the changing nature of landlord-tenant relationships. A clear north-south divide is identified in terms of farm <b>tenancy</b> <b>agreements</b> and a complex array of different <b>tenancy</b> <b>agreements</b> is demonstrated. The relationships between landlords and tenants are changing and the increasing variety of agreements provides evidence of a more fluid (post-feudal) system of agricultural leases. Nevertheless, high levels of uncertainty and negativity characterise tenant farmers' views on the impacts of CAP reforms. Crucially, the very identity of a tenant farmer is changing, towards an owner-occupier who rents additional land, and there is an urgent need for more detailed research on the 'consequential geographies' of farm property rights and the changing nature of landlord-tenant relationships...|$|R

In contrast, the highest observed sharing rates in the study area were in the neighborhood of 2 / 3, with most farmers contracted on 50 : 50 sharing arrangements.
