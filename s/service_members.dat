5|$|The psychiatrists {{responsible}} for creating and implementing screening procedures to exclude homosexuals from military service initially supported giving gay <b>service</b> <b>members</b> blue discharges. However, {{when they learned}} of the difficulties that blue-ticket holders faced in civilian life, they urged the military to discontinue the practice. William C. Menninger, {{who served as the}} Director of the Psychiatry Consultants Division for the Surgeon General of the United States Army from 1944 to 1946, tried to persuade the military to issue honorable discharges to gay <b>service</b> <b>members</b> who had not committed any crimes during their military service.|$|E

2500|$|... {{return to}} his unit. If a <b>Service</b> <b>member</b> starts to lose contact with his unit when he enters treatment, the impulse {{to get out of}} the war and return to safety takes over. He feels that he has failed his comrades and they have already {{rejected}} him as unworthy. The potential is for the <b>Service</b> <b>member</b> to become more and more emotionally invested in keeping his symptoms so he can stay in a safe environment. Much of this is done outside the <b>Service</b> <b>member's</b> conscious awareness, but the result is the same. The more out of touch the <b>Service</b> <b>member</b> is with his unit, the less likely he will recover. He is more likely to develop a chronic psychiatric illness and get evacuated from the war. This is one of the essential principles of CSC.|$|R
