However, right-hand drive is practical even where drivers drive on the right-hand side of the road as it allows a better view of the edge of the road, which is useful when driving on rough roads in mountainous districts. This did mean that drivers of cars with centrally located floor mounted gear shifts, such as the Ardea, needed to learn how to shift with the left hand. During the 1920s Italian leader Benito Mussolini required all Italian drivers to drive on the right, but Lancia would continue, through the 1950s, to <b>supply</b> <b>right</b> hand drive cars in areas viewed by other automakers as left hand drive markets.|$|E

40|$|Synopsis] In {{light of}} the expiry of the EU milk quota in April 2015, the German Federal Association of Dairy Farmers (Bundesverband Deutscher Milchviehhalter e. V. (BDM)) and the European Milk Board (EMB) have put forward a {{proposal}} for the future management of the dairy market. The central element of this proposal is a Monitoring Agency which will not only monitor the milk market on a permanent basis and analyse developments but also implement a Market Responsibility Programme {{in the event of}} a crisis. Both the number and amount of market adjustments should be carried out in a flexible manner, depending on the market situation. Based on the calculated milk production costs, a target price range is defined in which the average European milk producer price should move. This system requires the introduction of both a basic volume and <b>supply</b> <b>rights.</b> Depending on the market situation, <b>supply</b> <b>rights</b> amounting to 3 - 5 percent of the existing (basic) <b>supply</b> <b>rights</b> will be granted to or withdrawn from dairy farmers. As an additional intervention measure, a remunerated scheme for the voluntary suspension of production in the tendering or bidding process should be implemented, together with strategic storage. The costs of the instruments are to be covered from a market regulation fund Furthermore, in order for this system to function, the existing regulation on protection at the EU 2 ̆ 019 s external borders on the basis of the Uruguay Round must be maintained (Fink-Ke A 2013).

40|$|Few {{industry}} sectors {{have come}} under greater pressure to develop more sustainable product technologies than the automotive industry, and indeed examples of radical innovation in this sector are starting to emerge. Frequently, this product innovation also promises to create substantially different cost structures, brings new participants into the industry, and changes {{the way in which}} cars are owned and used. However, while myriad start-up enterprises have emerged around innovative automotive technologies, and while significantly different business models have been proposed, the mainstream industry and the leading vehicle manufacturers have thus far retained their dominance of the market for new cars, have retained there traditional value chains from materials <b>supply</b> <b>right</b> through to dealerships, have retained their traditional business model, and have retained their brand strategies more or less intact. Such innovation as has occurred in terms of business model, business process or market branding strategy has tended to be confined, incremental, marginal and conservative. While the need for significant further progress is undeniable, and while there is now legislative force to compel future compliance with carbon reduction targets in key markets like the European Union and Japan, the interests of preserving the existing business structures appear to have the potential to reduce the real rate of change in introducing novel technologies that could enable faster progress. This paper argues that the existing dominant industry, reinforced by a broader social construct {{of the role of the}} car, acts as a powerful force in guiding technology development along some pathways and not others. That is, while it might be the case that the effective utilization of innovative automotive technology might be greatest or optimized under novel sustainable business models, the incumbent industry overall shows a tendency to resist change in the business model which in turn will reduce the benefit of the innovative technology. This highlights a more general problem for any industry: the need to balance continuity and change, or to ensure a fit between the short term and the long term. The paper will draw upon examples and data from the industry around the world to illustrate the line of argument adopted. It will show the vanishingly unimportant impact of new entrants; the strategic control of new technologies by established vehicle manufacturers; the potentially destabilizing impact of Better Place; and the significance of multiple technology pathways into the future which means that there is unlikely to be ‘one best way’ as far as sustainable innovation in the automotive industry is concerned. The paper is grounded in transitions theory as articulated by authors such as Frank Geels and Rene Kemp, but combines that with the business model theorists such as Osterwelder...|$|E
40|$|O presente trabalho tem por finalidade avaliar o volume de ar medido em ligações prediais de água por meio de ensaios de laboratório. Este problema tem gerado várias ações judiciais impetradas pelos consumidores de água, em tramitação na justiça de diversas comarcas brasileiras, que reclamam dos valores cobrados a mais pelos serviços de saneamento em virtude do volume de ar registrado pelos hidrômetros. Devido ao grande interesse pelo tema, este trabalho procura esclarecer alguns pontos desse conflito, por meio de ensaios numa bancada que simula um trecho de rede interligada a um ramal predial. Adicionalmente, foram efetuados testes para avaliar a eficiência e aplicabilidade de válvulas redutoras de ar em ligações prediais, uma vez que a Lei Estadual 12. 645 / 97 permite aos consumidores de água de Minas Gerais a instalação desses equipamentos. Além da avaliação dos aparelhos, verificouse a eficiência de uma ventosa, instalada a montante do ramal predial no ponto mais alto da rede de abastecimento de água. Os resultados obtidos, sob condições normais de abastecimento de água, mostraram que a quantidade de ar na água medida pelos hidrômetros é comparável àquela encontrada na água no meio ambiente. Por outro lado, os resultados dos experimentos com abastecimento de água, logo após esvaziamento da rede interligada ao ramal predial, revelou que o volume de água que chega ao reservatório calibrado está compreendido entre 4 e 9 % do total do volume ar-água registrado pelo hidrômetro, para os experimentos efetuados no intervalo de tempo de teste de 180 s e pressão de 10 mca. Para o mesmo intervalo de tempo, porém com a pressão de 50 mca, o volume de água varia entre 6 e 21 % do volume total registrado pelo hidrômetro. Aumentando-se o intervalo de tempo para 300 s, e mantendo a pressão em 10 mca, o volume de água que efetivamente chega ao reservatório calibrado situa-se entre 7 e 20 % do volume total registrado pelo hidrômetro. Estes resultados evidenciam os erros cometidos pelo hidrômetro ao medir o escoamento bifásico ar e água. Para avaliar a eficiência de aparelhos destinados a reduzir o volume de ar nos ramais prediais, três dispositivos utilizados para reduzir o ar transportado junto com a água foram testados: eliminador de ar, bloqueador de ar e ventosa. Dentre as válvulas testadas, o eliminador de ar apresentou melhor desempenho, em termos de eficiência na retirada de ar, principalmente para as menores vazões. Já o bloqueador de ar, além de possuir desempenho {{inferior}} ao eliminador de ar testado, ao bloquear o ar transportado pela rede de abastecimento pode contribuir para que os bolsões de ar contidos no ramal predial retornem à rede de abastecimento, influenciando assim, no registro de ar por uma outra estrutura de medição próxima. Em relação aos outros aparelhos testados, a ventosa apresentou desempenho inferior ao bloqueador de ar e muito inferior ao desempenho do eliminador de ar. The {{purpose of}} the present work is to evaluate the volume of air measured in domestic water supply pipe connections. It is a current problem as shown by a series of suits running in courts in several cities questioning that the amounts charged by the water supply companies might have been increased by air in the water distribution network. Due to the high level of interest generated by the matter, the present work will try to clarify some conflicting points through essays performed in a hydraulic laboratory counter which simulates a part of a distribution pipe connected to a domestic water supply pipe. Additionally, tests were performed to evaluate the efficiency and applicability of air reducing valves in domestic water supply connections, once the Act 12645 / 97 allows Minas Gerais water consumers to have the installation of such equipment. In addition to the evaluation of such devices, the efficiency of air release valves was checked, installed upstream the domestic water supply pipe at the highest point of the water supply network. The results obtained under regular water supply conditions showed that the quantity of air in the water measured by the hydrometers is comparable to the one found in the environment water. On the other hand, the water <b>supply,</b> <b>right</b> after emptying the network connected to the domestic water supply pipe, revealed that the volume of water which gets to the gauged reservoir, comprehends 4 % and 9 % of the total air-water volume recorded by the hydrometer for the experiments performed in the test time interval of 180 seconds and a 10 mca pressure. For the same time interval, despite the 50 mca pressure, the volume of water varies from 6 % to 21 % of the total volume recorded by the hydrometer. By increasing the time interval to 300 seconds, and keeping the pressure at 10 mca, the volume of water that effectively gets to the gauged reservoir is between 7 % and 20 % of the total volume recorded by the hydrometer. Such results show clearly the mistakes made by the hydrometer when measuring the twophase outflow of water and air. In order to evaluate the efficiency of the apparatus aimed at reducing the volume of air in the domestic water supply, three devices used to reduce the air carried along with the water were tested: air eliminator, air blocker and air release valve. Among the valves tested, the air eliminator presented the best performance in terms of efficiency in the air withdrawal, especially for the smallest outflow. As to the air blocker, in addition to having a lower performance compared to the tested air eliminator, when blocking the air carried by the water supply network it can contribute so as the water pockets contained in the domestic water supply pipe return to the water supply network, therefore influencing in the air registration through another measuring structure next to it. Concerning the other apparatus tested, the air release valve has lower performance than the air blocker and a lot lower than the air eliminator performance. As to the apparatus tested air eliminator, for discharges lower than 0. 18 m 3 /h, the efficiency was 91 % and 99 % for pressures 0. 5 MPa and 0. 1 MPa, respectively. The results also revealed that the hydrometer, even after being specified adequately for the consumption measured, in the presence of air, may operate out of the recommended range, causing its mechanism to wear down and mistakes higher than 5 %. The results obtained cannot be generalized for water supply systems and it is still important to take into account that the volume of air measured in the experiments is peculiar of the tests bench. Therefore, as to the water supply networks, the volume of water carried into the water supply network will depend on the diameter and the pipes length and on the existence or not of devices aimed at eliminating the air out of such networks...|$|E
