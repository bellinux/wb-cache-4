5|$|As the {{president}} begins continuity-of-government procedures, Fisher shuts down the burning plant and averts {{a chain reaction}} to the next reserve. When he captures another <b>senior</b> <b>Engineer,</b> he learns about Sadiq's final plan: to disclose all U.S. military secrets. Sadiq kidnaps the Secretary of Defense and holds them at the Site F government bunker under Denver International Airport. Disregarding {{the president}}'s order, Fourth Echelon infiltrates the base. Despite Cole's infiltration of Sadiq's team, Sadiq's men capture Briggs and torture {{the secretary of defense}} into authorizing the transfer.

Gibraltar's defences were stronger {{than they had been}} in the earlier siege but still had many deficiencies. The fortress seemed at first sight to be well-armed, with 339 cannon in 1744, but this number concealed the fact that they consisted of at least eight different calibres, some made of brass and some of iron – which meant greatly differing levels of reliability – and they required many different types of spares and ammunition, adding to the garrison's logistical problems.|$|E

5|$|Prior to its {{rebranding}} {{and full}} move onto eighth-generation consoles, Final Fantasy XV (then called Final Fantasy Versus XIII) used lighting technology from Luminous {{along with a}} purpose-built proprietary gameplay engine.

5|$|Air Commodore Arthur William Murphy, DFC, AFC, FRAeS (17November 1891– 21April 1963) was a <b>senior</b> <b>engineer</b> and aviator in the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF). He {{accompanied}} Captain Henry Wrigley on {{the first}} trans-Australia flight from Melbourne to Darwin in 1919, a feat that earned both men the Air Force Cross. Murphy later {{played a leading role}} in military aircraft maintenance and production. A veteran of World WarI, he served first as a mechanic and then as a pilot with the Australian Flying Corps. Based in the Middle East, he flew with No.1 Squadron and was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross. Murphy was the first airman on the RAAF's strength when it formed in 1921, and rose to the rank of temporary air commodore during World WarII, commanding No.1 Aircraft Depot and No.4 Maintenance Group. He was also the RAAF's first Inspector of Air Accidents. A fellow of the Royal Aeronautical Society, Murphy retired from the military in 1946, and died in 1963 aged seventy-one.|$|E

He was given the brevet rank of lieutenant colonel on 1 January 1920, but this did not become substantive until 1 April 1932. Sturdee initially served as <b>Senior</b> <b>Engineer</b> Officer {{on the staff of}} the 3rd Military District at Victoria Barracks, Melbourne.

Responsive, semi-structured interviews were conducted with four <b>senior</b> <b>engineers.</b> Thirteen themes in four groupings emerged. The four groupings are: organization and retrieval, un-organized aspects, information keeping and preservation, and use of specialized tools. Themes not seen in other studies are: writing to remember and reporting to retrieve, and personal handbooks. The themes are described in detail. Implications for the design of information systems and future work are discussed. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract]: Aims: The {{leadership}} {{attributes of}} engineers have been deemed crucial lately and have reached {{to a point}} where the link between leadership and engineering is debatable. Hence, this project purports to survey on the leadership attributes of <b>senior</b> <b>engineers</b> within the construction industry in both Malaysia and Australia. The final outcome of this project would be to provide a comparative result of engineering leadership of these two countries as well as to see if the results support the literature review done on the leadership attributes. Methodology: A survey research methodology was used to gather data from <b>senior</b> <b>engineers</b> in the construction industry. The samples incorporated a total of 14 individual <b>senior</b> <b>engineers</b> from Malaysia and 21 engineers from Australia. An analysis was done by basic statistical methods and then analysed both quantitative and qualitatively. The outcome of this project would be obtained by quantitative survey and evaluation of the comparative study, which would depend on the aid of a questionnaire created. Analysis of the surveys relating to the leadership attributes found in the literature review would be conducted and the final results observed would then be extensively evaluated. ...|$|R

25|$|To further {{restrict}} access, the British built two defended {{positions on}} either side of the northern end of the Inundation, not only to guard against a surprise attack but to prevent desertion by disgruntled members of Gibraltar's garrison. The Advance Guard Room was built on the east side on the foundations of an earlier Spanish fortification which had controlled movement across the strip of land adjoining the Morass. After William Green became Gibraltar's <b>Senior</b> <b>Engineer</b> in 1761, he had the Advance Guard Room (renamed Forbes' Barrier) more heavily fortified and also had the Bayside Barrier constructed on the other side to control access to the causeway.
