A typical PWR has fuel assemblies of 200 to 300 rods each, and a large reactor would have about 150–250 such assemblies with 80–100 tonnes of uranium in all. Generally, the fuel bundles consist of fuel rods bundled 14×14 to 17×17. A PWR produces on the order of 900 to 1,600MWe. PWR fuel bundles are about 4meters in length.|$|E

50|$|A wholly {{sintered}} diamond blade is made {{by putting}} the steel core, together with the diamonds and the metal bond materials, into a mold and then sintering it in a <b>sintering</b> <b>furnace</b> equipment. Consequently, the diameter of wholly sintered diamond blades is not very large, normally not more than 400 mm. Because it is participating in the sintering process, the steel core cannot be quenched, so the hardness and strength of the core are not very high. This means that these types of diamond blade may deform in high-load and high-intensity cutting processes and can exhibit low cutting efficiency.|$|E

However, good methods for stripping cold-pressed materials from moving belts are hard to find. One alternative that avoids the belt-stripping difficulty altogether is the manufacture of metal sheets using opposed hydraulic rams, although weakness lines across the sheet may arise during successive press operations.|$|E

Therefore, in-situ FTIR gas phase measurements of the debinding and sintering of PM steel components were performed in reducing atmospheres.

In this study, we focused on three typical Chinese <b>sintering</b> <b>furnace</b> processes.

The total mercury concentrations in the <b>sintering</b> <b>furnace</b> flue gas were 17. 773, 31. 765 and 18. 275 mu g/m(3); the major mercury species was oxidized form, which accounted for 73. 4 - 94. 7 % of the total mercury. The mercury concentrations in the stack flue gas were 0. 373, 0. 533 and 0. 465 mu g/m(3), while its removal efficiencies by air pollution control devices (APCDs) were 97. 5 %, 81. 1 % and 96. 8 %, and its emission factors were 2. 49, 2. 71 and 1. 28 mg/t sinter. The main mercury inputs were iron ore, coal, coke and lime, where the iron ore input was 74. 84 - 92. 22 % of the total mercury quantity.

This makes SiC {{difficult to use}} in the fabrication of large structures, because pieces made from SiC cannot be joined together {{in the same way that}} metals can be welded. Therefore, the size of the monolithic ceramic structures that can be manufactured are limited by the size of the <b>sintering</b> <b>furnaces</b> (approximately 10 feet for sintered alpha silicon carbide). In order to make larger objects such as heat exchangers, many small ceramic pieces must be fused or joined. In addition, repair of the objects will require the use of field joining techniques. At present, no joining techniques for high-temperature structural ceramics are routinely available. The objective of this work at the Energy and Environmental Research Center (EERC) is to develop a patentable technique for joining large silicon based advanced ceramics in the field. The key to developing a successful technique will be the use of reactive joining compounds to lower the joining temperature but without leaving continuous channels of unreacted compounds that can weaken the joint or be conduits for corrosion at temperatures over 1, 400 C.

The tests involved two test specimen sizes, one with a thickness five-fold greater than the particle size of the material and the other with a three-fold greater thickness. The width of both test specimens was ten times that of their thickness and their length was double their width. The material utilized was an alumina-based refractory castable without cement. It is important to ascertain the influence of the thickness of double-torsion test specimens when materials with a coarse microstructure are involved.

However, the analysis of the mean values of R (R), obtained by the arithmetic average of the R values in the section of stable crack propagation and the total fracture energy (&# 947;wof), showed that these values are dependent on the size of the test specimens, indicating that this subject deserves further investigation...|$|R
