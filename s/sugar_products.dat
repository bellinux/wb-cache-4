25|$|Lichens {{are another}} example of mutualism. Lichens consist of a fungus (the mycobiont) and a {{photosynthetic}} partner (the photobiont), which is usually a green alga or a cyanobacteria. The mycobiont benefits from the <b>sugar</b> <b>products</b> of photosynthesis generated by the photobiont, and the photobiont benefits from the increased water retention and increased surface area to capture water and mineral nutrients conferred by the mycobiont. Many lichens are examples of obligate symbiosis. In fact, one-fifth of all known extant fungal species form obligate symbiotic associations with green algae, cyanobacteria or both.|$|E
25|$|The world {{demand for}} sugar {{is the primary}} driver of {{sugarcane}} agriculture. Cane accounts for 80% of sugar produced; {{most of the rest}} is made from sugar beets. Sugarcane predominantly grows in the tropical and subtropical regions (sugar beets grow in colder temperate regions). Other than <b>sugar,</b> <b>products</b> derived from sugarcane include falernum, molasses, rum, cachaça (a traditional spirit from Brazil), bagasse, and ethanol. In some regions, people use sugarcane reeds to make pens, mats, screens, and thatch.

Sugar crystals appear naturally white in color during the crystallization process. Sulfur dioxide is added to inhibit the formation of color-inducing molecules {{as well as to}} stabilize the sugar juices during evaporation. Refineries, often located nearer to consumers in North America, Europe, and Japan, then produce refined white sugar, which is 99 percent sucrose. These two stages are slowly merging.
