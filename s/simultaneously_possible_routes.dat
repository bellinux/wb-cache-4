50|$|When {{there is}} more than one <b>possible</b> <b>route</b> between the origin and {{destination}} airports, the task facing a flight planning system becomes more complicated, since it must now consider many routes in order to find the best available route. Many situations have tens or even hundreds of <b>possible</b> <b>routes,</b> and there are some situations with over 25,000 <b>possible</b> <b>routes</b> (e.g., London to New York with free-flight below the track system). The amount of calculation required to produce an accurate flight plan is so substantial that it is not feasible to examine every <b>possible</b> <b>route</b> in detail. A flight planning system must have some fast way of cutting the number of possibilities down to a manageable number before undertaking a detailed analysis.|$|R
