Coal mining in Shanxi is {{characterized}} by the most severe gob and subsidence in China, so its ecological restoration is strongly typical, exemplary and stimulating for the whole country. At present, most of domestic researches focus on land reclamation rather than the ecological restoration of <b>subsidence</b> <b>area</b> for coal mining. In terms of <b>subsidence</b> <b>area,</b> ecological restoration is no longer to simply restore the <b>subsidence</b> <b>area</b> to the available settlement land, but to establish a natural complex ecosystem which is totally or partially different from the function of original land and can be harmoniously integrated with the surrounding economy, society and economics, thus generating high economic, social and environmental benefits.

In this conspicuous uplift area, it appears that two elliptical uplift areas were superimposed. The eastern elliptical uplift area corresponds to the conspicuous uplift area observed by Onishi et al.

The western elliptical uplift has not been observed in the past. However, it had a maximum uplift that reached approximately 26  mm during the half-year observation period in 2012. In contrast, <b>subsidence</b> <b>areas</b> were observed in and around the uplift area mentioned above.

Firstly, key ecological patches were identified by GIS and RS methods. Secondly, we established corridors by minimum cost path model.

40|$|AbstractDue to the {{development}} of cities and towns, the shortage of constructible land becomes a serious problem for public. Thus, lots of industrial and residential buildings have to be built within mining <b>subsidence</b> <b>areas.</b> Such these construction works may break the relative balance of overburden strata over gobs and active the strata with secondary deformations and movements, and surface constructions would be induced to subside, partial crack and tilt even fall down. Hence, the foundations of these constructions are more complicated than any others due to their special geological conditions. Generally, a number of influence factors could control the mining subsidence process, and they are also difficult to describe with a quantitative point. The limits for different corresponding stability levels are also too vague to identify (stability level itself is not restricted.). Therefore, classical mathematical method or mechanics model could not be used here to treat this problem. In this paper, based on fuzzy mathematics, some key question such as establishing the assessment index system, calculating the weighting factors and building the membership functions are discussed. Finally, a fuzzy comprehensive evaluation model for stability of strata over gob affected by surface construction loads is established. It is a beneficial attempt to apply the fuzzy method in this research field. It evolves the mining <b>subsidence</b> <b>area</b> stability evaluation from the traditional qualitative description or the semiquantitative analysis, into the combination of qualitative and quantitative methods, and makes the entire evaluation process to become a quantitative calculation and analysis,which can provide a more scientific results for using the surface land in mining <b>subsidence</b> <b>area...</b>|$|R

For valid simulation, we put forward the methods and principles of simplifying foundation and sand cushion. The research results indicate that, if the ground deforms in patterns of negative curvature, tension or compression, the structure stress and the horizontal support displacement of transmission tower can be reduced by 25 % and 40 % respectively by using composite foundation compared with independent foundation. If the ground deforms in pattern of positive curvature, the tower can be also protected by using the composite foundation instead of the independent ones, but the effect is less than that in the former three deformation patterns.

The focus of this paper is placed on the settlement behaviour of a continuous 3 -span R. C. viaduct bridge supported on piles adjacent to highway embankment. Monitoring data accumulated over the last 12 years indicate that the observed pace of the settlement of the viaduct structure in other sections matches that of the ground. However, the bridge piers adjacent to the embankment have been suffering an additional approximately 1 cm settlement every year since the completion of the embankment construction. It was believed that the piers may suffer from enormous negative skin friction owing to the surcharge from the embankment and groundwater depression. This paper first summarizes the settlement analysis results to quantify the settlement of pile due to regional ground subsidence and the combined effects from ground water fluctuation and embankment surcharge loading.
