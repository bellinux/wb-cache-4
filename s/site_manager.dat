The aim {{of this paper is}} to examine and evaluate the specific training needs of construction <b>site</b> <b>managers</b> handling selected construction projects in Lagos State of Nigeria. A structured questionnaire survey was used to collect information on construction <b>site</b> <b>managers</b> in Lagos State. The data were analysed using descriptive statistics, mean score, weighted average, and t-test distribution. The result of the study revealed that there is common agreement that training of <b>site</b> <b>managers</b> should address human and industrial relations, building production and project management, then communication skills and computing. The paper concludes with recommendation to establish training institutes to take up the managerial training addressing the skill shortages of <b>site</b> <b>managers</b> to enhance efficiency in the construction industry.

40|$|Much of {{construction}} work is project-based, short-term and task-oriented; promoting {{a culture of}} continuous learning is inhibited. Very often, specialist and technical knowledge is not shared laterally, neither between fellow site personnel nor organisations. This is especially so for tacit knowledge, which <b>site</b> <b>managers</b> gain and use in solving their complex day-to-day problems. A research on knowledge management amongst construction SMEs is discussed. This study uses storytelling as a mechanism for unravelling the tacit knowledge of experienced <b>site</b> <b>managers.</b> As stories are told, wider learning is extracted through reflection and debriefing. The intention is to share this learning, first within the participating SMEs and subsequently to the construction industry at large. The research {{is at the same}} time exploring different ways in which any knowledge obtained can be shared or transferred. In this regard, this paper concentrates on representing stories or their lessons graphically. The paper reports two cases where two separate lessons from two different <b>site</b> <b>managers</b> were obtained by means of artistic impressions. Through subsequent feedback sessions with these <b>site</b> <b>managers,</b> the researchers were able to establish that the graphics had captured the hitherto tacit knowledge of these <b>site</b> <b>managers.</b> As well as capturing knowledge, the <b>site</b> <b>managers</b> opined that the graphics could be used to transfer information to others...|$|R
40|$|Waste {{management}} in refurbishment projects {{can be costly}} and harmful to the environment. Legislation on waste management sets limits, but the construction industry remains among the top contributors to waste generation. Well planned waste management can drive improvements in productivity and environmental sustainability. Site managers’ waste management strategies might include reducing waste generation, reuse, recycling and disposal. The aim is to analyse the administrative and physical factors influencing refurbishment site managers’ attitudes and behaviours towards waste management. Eight semi-structured interviews were held with <b>site</b> <b>managers,</b> two with project managers and two with environmental staff belonging to large contractors involved in housing and office refurbishment projects in Sweden. Waste management practices on refurbishment sites were found to differ. Influences on <b>site</b> <b>managers</b> arise at three organisational levels: top management (sustainability policies), local level (project budgets), and site level (physical factors including limited space). Disposal of waste is the last choice of most <b>site</b> <b>managers</b> given cost and company policies. <b>Site</b> <b>managers</b> devise waste management strategies based on environmental inventories and project size. In smaller projects, waste contractors are employed only for physical support and <b>site</b> <b>managers</b> have less flexibility due to limited physical space. Design-build procurement is viewed by <b>site</b> <b>managers</b> as more efficient for waste management; partnering is promoted for greener refurbishment projects. Client demand and company policy heavily influence practices. Unlike new construction, refurbishment clients seldom require green waste management {{to a higher standard}} than is typical of large contractors...|$|R

[...] Plans for developing the river for recreational use were also coming to fruition as it was reported in 1982 that, over the May bank holiday, the first pleasure cruise on the river in the 20th century would leave from the Mark Addy as part of a three-day experiment to see whether river cruises could be a success. [...] In 1983 over 100canal and river boats rode the flooded river for the Greater Manchester Waterways Festival, an event aimed at demonstrating how pleasure boating could [...] "transform the bleak waterway in the heart of Manchester". By 1984 two local men felt the waters were clean enough for them to brave a ten-mile (16km) charity fund-raising swim from Clifton to Manchester, although they were warned by a spokesman for the North West Water Authority that the cocktail of effluent and occasional untreated sewage meant that the Irwell was still [...] "a class 4 river– top of the pollution chart". [...] During 1985 the Croal–Irwell Valley local plan was launched, listing 187proposals for the improvement of the valley and in 1986 the Mersey Basin Campaign was announced. [...] The campaign was to cover a large area, from Rossendale in the north to Crewe in the south, and it was promised that £67m would be made available in the first three years for water- and land-based projects. [...] In September 1987 plans were revealed for a mile-long landscaped walkway in Manchester city centre and developers announced plans to develop three bricked-up railway arches {{on the side of the}} river, opposite Manchester Cathedral, into a wine bar and restaurant. In 1988 Manchester's first water bus made its maiden voyage from the New Bailey Landing Stage, then known as the Mark Addy Quay, on a five-mile (8km) inaugural round trip to Salford Quays By the end of the 1980s ambitious plans had been announced to turn Manchester into a top international tourist centre [...] "mainly based on the derelict areas around the waterways of Manchester, Salford and Trafford– the Irwell, the Irk, the ship canal and the Bridgewater Canal...bringing £500m of investment and 13,000newjobs over the next 10years".

40|$|The {{literature}} on middle managers tends to portray {{their role in}} rather negative terms. Middle managers are here stuck in between superiors and subordinates, with few opportunities for determining their work situation. In the construction industry, <b>site</b> <b>managers</b> play a role {{similar to that of}} the middle managers of large companies, located in between the firm's strategic decisions and day-to-day production work on construction sites. The aim of this study is to examine how <b>site</b> <b>managers</b> experience their work situation. Drawing on an interview study encompassing 13 <b>site</b> <b>managers</b> and seven foremen and top managers in 13 construction projects, the research suggests that <b>site</b> <b>managers</b> are generally pleased with their work situation even though they are critical of the demands made of them to handle a variety of heterogeneous activities. However, a work situation fraught with unanticipated challenges and ambiguities easily leads to excessive workloads and long working hours. It is concluded that the {{literature on}} middle managers presents too negative an image of middle management and thus needs to revise the assumptions regarding the nature of middle managerial work. In addition, the study also underlines the needs of construction firms to regard their middle managers as a central function and resource. <b>Site</b> <b>managers,</b> construction projects, middle managers,...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the past}} few decades, {{scholars}} have paid increasing attention to work of <b>site</b> <b>managers</b> in the construction industry. In particular, the work situations of <b>site</b> <b>managers</b> have been increasingly depicted as demanding and stressful. The reasons for these situations have been explained as arising from macro-level characteristics of the industry itself. This includes, for instance, the influence of structure (loose coupling) and culture (masculinity and paternalism) that is suggested to promote a particularly demanding work situations characterized by overwork, stress, fragmentation and pressure {{to be in control}} of all activities on site. This thesis takes a critical perspective {{on the assumption that the}} everyday work practices of <b>site</b> <b>managers</b> can be explained as causally derived from macro-level characteristics of the industry. Instead, a need to take into account the managers experiences, meaning-making and responses is called for. The aim of the thesis is to explore practical manifestations of site managers’ everyday work and how they experience and cope with their work life situations. For this aim, a case study design with an exploratory and interpretative approach has been chosen. The thesis discusses findings based on three appended papers. By applying an everyday practice lens on the managers work, the discussion highlights the emergence of four separate yet interrelated empirical phenomena that warrant further research. These are reproduction, normalization, autonomy and resistance. These phenomena are discussed in order to highlight nuances, complexities and paradoxes underlying <b>site</b> <b>managers</b> work and to conceptualize new understandings of work in the construction industry. Instead of viewing <b>site</b> <b>managers</b> work as derived from macro-level characteristics, the thesis argues for a need to increasingly consider how issues of overwork and workaholism become reproduced and resisted in context where these tendencies seem to be normalized. The thesis concludes by emphasizing the need for future research on <b>site</b> <b>managers</b> work situations to critically elaborate on the relationship between, on one hand masculine culture and identities vis-à-vis practices of (over) work, and on the other hand autonomy and resistance vis-à-vis control...|$|R

To date, little research on the use of coaching in the construction industry has been published and the coaching literature is primarily written by coaches with vested interests.
