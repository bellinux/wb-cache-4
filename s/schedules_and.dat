40|$|As {{production}} systems expand, {{there is a}} tendency for the <b>scheduling</b> <b>and</b> control activities to become complex, or at least more demanding with respect to the time required for their performance. Internal pressures exerted by the influence of an enlarging production system often stimulates an evaluation of current methods of production <b>scheduling</b> <b>and</b> control. These internal pressures could result in a loss of control over the production system with possible reverberations in any one or all of the <b>scheduling</b> <b>and</b> control activities. Problems of production <b>scheduling</b> <b>and</b> control usually manifest themselves in deviations from planned courses of action.

40|$|This paper {{initially}} {{discusses the}} state-of-the-art {{and the current}} limitations in the modeling, <b>scheduling</b> <b>and</b> control of flexible automation. To model flexible automation, {{it is argued that}} the simulation tools must provide enhanced capabilities to consider both controller interactions and the flow of resources that support production. It is also dem-onstrated that <b>scheduling</b> <b>and</b> control must be considered concurrently in real-time to effectively manage flexible manufacturing systems (FMSs). The complexity of the modem FMS further requires that the integrated <b>scheduling</b> <b>and</b> control function must be distributed among several coordinators with the system. The second part of the paper presents several research developments pertaining to the modeling, <b>scheduling</b> <b>and</b> control of flexible automation including: a Recursive, Object-Oriented Control Hierarchy for the integrated dis-tribution of <b>scheduling</b> <b>and</b> control; a Hierarchical Object-Oriented Programmable Logic Simulator €or the detailed modeling of FMSs; and a Hierarchical System Coordinator for implementing real-time <b>scheduling</b> <b>and</b> control. A physical emulator for an FMS which is being constructed is discussed as the example application in this presentation. Finally, the futureresearch plan and theeducational program based upon the developments is outlined. ...|$|R

In November 1960, the New Haven moved its station services from Union Station to a converted freight house slightly to the east to save money, leaving the B alone in the station. In March 1964, the Interstate Commerce Commission authorized the NYNH to cut all Berkshire Division services except the weekend trips.|$|E

5|$|Globally, women's {{access to}} health care remains a challenge, both in {{developing}} and developed countries. In the United States, before the Affordable Health Care Act came into effect, 25% of women of child bearing age lacked health insurance. In the absence of adequate insurance, women are likely to avoid important steps to self care such as routine physical examination, screening and prevention testing, and prenatal care. The situation is aggravated by the fact that women living below the poverty line are at greater risk of unplanned pregnancy, unplanned delivery and elective abortion. Added to the financial burden in this group are poor educational achievement, lack of transportation, inflexible work <b>schedules</b> <b>and</b> difficulty obtaining child care, all of which function to create barriers to accessing health care. These problems are much worse in developing countries. Under 50% of childbirths in these countries are assisted by healthcare providers (e.g. midwives, nurses, doctors) which accounts for higher rates of maternal death, up to 1:1,000 live births. This is despite the WHO setting standards, such as a minimum of four antenatal visits. A lack of healthcare providers, facilities, and resources such as formularies all contribute to high levels of morbidity amongst women from avoidable conditions such as obstetrical fistulae, sexually transmitted diseases and cervical cancer.|$|E
5|$|On 1 September 1993, NSB {{launched}} the Trøndelag Commuter Rail, {{of which the}} main service ran from Steinkjer to Trondheim. The initial plans called to the continued use of the Class 92 rolling stock, but saw change in <b>schedules</b> <b>and</b> the upgrading platforms for NOK15 million. At the same time, the stations of Alstad, Langstein and Fleskhus were closed. The service from Trondheim to Steinkjer had ten daily round trips. After six months operation, the service had experienced a 40 percent growth in patronage. This was further increased {{with the opening of}} Trondheim Airport Station on 15 November 1994, which cost NOK24 million. The upgrades to the airport also included a new taxiway, which resulted in second Værnes Tunnel being built. A station was also established to serve Levanger Hospital on 20 December 1995. On 10 November 1994, the line received automatic train control. NSB was split up on 1 December 1996 and the ownership of the tracks and infrastructure was inherited by the Norwegian National Rail Administration, while the operation of trains was taken over by the new NSB. From 1994, Di6 and Di8 locomotives were introduced, but the Di6 proved unreliable and returned to the manufacturer.|$|E

40|$|High-level {{synthesis}} is {{the process}} of automatically translating abstract behavioral models of digital systems to implementable hardware. Operation <b>scheduling</b> <b>and</b> hardware allocation are the two most important phases in the synthesis of circuits from behavioral specification. <b>Scheduling</b> <b>and</b> allocation can be formulated as an optimization problem. In this work, a unique approach to <b>scheduling</b> <b>and</b> allocation problem using the genetic algorithm (GA) is described. This approach is different from a previous attempt using GA (Wehn et al., IFIP Working Conference on Logic and Architecture Synthesis, Paris, 1990, pp. 47 – 56) in many respects. The main contributions include: (1) a new chromosomal representation for <b>scheduling</b> <b>and</b> for two subproblems of allocation; and (2) two novel crossover operators to generate legal schedules. In addition the application of tabu search (TS) to <b>scheduling</b> <b>and</b> allocation is also implemented and studied. Two implementations of TS are reported and compared. Both genetic <b>scheduling</b> <b>and</b> allocation (GSA) <b>and</b> tabu <b>scheduling</b> <b>and</b> allocation (TSA) have been tested on various benchmarks and results obtained for data-oriented control-data flow graphs are compared with other implementations in the literature. (A discussion on GSA was presented at the European Design Automation Conference Euro-DAC' 94 in Grenoble, France, and TSA at the International Conference on Electronics, Circuits and Systems — ICECS' 94 in Cairo, Egypt.)
