5|$|A lack {{of field}} {{observations}} limit our knowledge, but intraspecific conflicts {{are known to}} sometimes result in injury or death. The screamers (Anhimidae), some jacanas (Jacana, Hydrophasianus), the <b>spur-winged</b> <b>goose</b> (Plectropterus), the torrent duck (Merganetta) and nine species of lapwing (Vanellus) use a sharp spur on the wing as a weapon. The steamer ducks (Tachyeres), geese and swans (Anserinae), the solitaire (Pezophaps), sheathbills (Chionis), some guans (Crax) and stone curlews (Burhinus) use a bony knob on the alular metacarpal to punch and hammer opponents. The jacanas Actophilornis and Irediparra have an expanded, blade-like radius. The extinct Xenicibis was unique in having an elongate forelimb and massive hand which likely functioned in combat or defence as a jointed club or flail. Swans, for instance, may strike with the bony spurs and bite when defending eggs or young.|$|E
500|$|Outgrowths of bone {{covered in}} a sheath of horn which are found on some birds. Spurs are most {{commonly}} found on the feet or legs, though some birds possess spurs {{on the leading edge}} of the wings. Spurs on the feet or legs are usually formed from the lower portion of the [...] bone, whereas those on the wings are an extension of the radiale—one of the avian carpal bones. Their function appears to be for fighting and defence, rather than for predation. [...] Most galliformes have hind foot spurs. [...] Birds having carpal spurs include the <b>spur-winged</b> <b>goose,</b> spur-winged lapwing and screamers.|$|E
500|$|Members of {{both sexes}} possessed a large {{tuberous}} knob of bone exostosis situated {{at the base of}} the carpometacarpus of each wrist. Other wing bones also sometimes show similar structures. The knob was cauliflower-like in appearance, and consisted of up to two or three lobes. The knobs were about half the length of the metacarpus, were larger in males than females, and described as the size of a musket ball. One study measured the largest knob to be [...] in diameter. The knobs vary in size across individuals, and were entirely absent from 58% of specimens examined for the study. These are thought to be immature birds, or birds without territory. The carpometacarpi of males without the knobs were smaller on average than those with it, but there was little difference between the females. In life, the knobs would have been covered by tough cartilaginous or keratinous integument, which would have made them appear even larger. Carpal spurs and knobs are also known from other extant as well as extinct birds. Within Columbidae, the crowned pigeons and the Viti Levu giant pigeon have outgrowths on the carpometacarpus which are similar to those of the female Rodrigues solitaire. Other well known examples are the steamer ducks, the torrent duck, sheathbills, screamers, the <b>spur-winged</b> <b>goose,</b> and the extinct Xenicibis xympithecus.|$|E

50|$|The {{breeding}} season for <b>spur-winged</b> <b>geese</b> is variable across the range. In the north, breeding generally occurs from August to December, in eastern Africa from January to June and in southern Africa from August to May. This species is highly aggressive to other waterfowl (including conspecifics) during the {{breeding season}}. At {{this time of}} the year, the geese may violently put the spur on the bend of the wings to use in conflicts with other birds. Adult male geese are especially prone to attacking other adult males. The large nest is usually concealed in vegetation near water, but tree holes, cavities in rocks, old hamerkop, African fish eagle or social weaver nests and even the top of a termite mound and an aardvark burrow have been used as nests. When choosing a tree-nest site, they will generally select a nest located close to the ground at between 20 and 100 cm high in trees 3 to 4 m high. Generally, they prefer quiet, undisturbed stretches of riverbank and wetlands for nest sites.|$|R
50|$|Wading birds, even {{large and}} {{relatively}} slow-moving types {{such as the}} goliath heron (Ardea goliath), tend to be highly cautious about avoiding deep water in crocodile occupied wetlands whereas cormorants and waterfowl forage over deeper water and are easier for crocodiles to ambush, with Egyptian geese (Alopochen aegyptiaca) and <b>spur-winged</b> <b>geese</b> (Plectropterus gambensis) recorded as being taken largely while flightless due to molting their flight feathers. On the contrary, there are several records of them capturing wading birds. Guggisberg (1972) saw multiple cases of predation on marabou storks (Leptoptilos crumenifer) and around Lake Turkana several may frequent heronries to pick off fledglings. In one case, a crocodile was filmed capturing a striated heron (Butorides striata) in mid-flight. Osprey (Pandion haliaetus) {{are known to be}} grabbed while they dive for fish as are possibly African fish eagles (Haliaeetus vocifer) while crowned eagles (Stephanoaetus coronatus) have reportedly been ambushed on land at carrion. Crocodiles are occasionally successful in grabbing passerines such as weaver birds, including the abundant red-billed quelea (Quelea quelea), and swallows, having been observed to breach the water and {{in a matter of seconds}} sweep off a branch full of birds with remarkable success. Larger land birds, such as bustards, guineafowl, ground hornbills (Bucorvus sp.) and ostriches (Struthio camelus), may be taken when they come to water to drink but like most birds are seldom harassed and a minor part of the diet.|$|R
5000|$|Adults are 75 - 115 cm {{long and}} weigh on average 4 - 6.8 kg, rarely up to 10 kg, with males noticeably {{larger than the}} females. The {{wingspan}} can range from 150 to 200 cm.

However, 11 geese of this species banded in South Africa were found to average only 3.87 kg, with a range of 2.4 to 5.4 kg. Another study in South Africa found that 58 males weighed an average of 5.52 kg and measured 98.1 cm in total length; while 34 females averaged 3.35 kg in weight and 84.2 cm in total length. Among standard measurements, the wing chord is 42.5 to 55 cm, the bill is 5.7 to 6.4 cm and the tarsus is 5.7 to 12 cm.

40|$|The spectre of {{introduction}} of avian influenza in Zambia through migratory birds raises concerns for {{both human and}} animal health. Although avian influenza virus (AIV) surveillance has been on-going in wild waterfowl in Lochinvar national park (LNP) since 2006, {{little is known about}} the ecological drivers of AIV perpetuation in wild birds in Zambia. While several AIV subtypes have been isolated and characterized in Zambia, H 10 viruses have not been studied. During routine AIV surveillance conducted in November 2014, of the 287 faecal samples collected from ducks, <b>spur-winged</b> <b>geese</b> and pelicans, four H 10 N 1 viruses were isolated from ducks using embryonated eggs. In this study, the haemagglutinin (HA) and the neuraminidase (NA) genes of one of the isolates (designated A/duck/Zambia/ 36 / 2014 H 10 N 1 (Dk-Zb 14)) were amplified in a one-step reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Full length sequencing, phylogenetic and amino acid sequence analyses of the HA and NA genes was performed. The HA and NA gene phylogeny revealed that Dk-Zb 14 belonged to the Eurasian-Avian lineage. The HA gene was closely related to that of A/Pekin duck/South Africa/AI 1642 / 09 H 10 N 7. In contrast, the NA gene was closely related to that of A/pelican/Zambia/ 13 / 09 H 9 N 1 isolated in LNP. Dk-Zb 14 had fewer glycosylation sites (3) than those reported for most AIVs. A glutamine to isoleucine substitution at the receptor biding site (position 226) was observed in the HA gene. The HA gene cleavage site had PEIMQGR?GLF amino acid motif, which is similar to previously described H 10 isolates. Dk-Zb 14 and Pel-Zb 09 had ten amino acid differences within the NA gene. Additionally, the NA gene of Dk-Zb 14 had a lysine at position 432 which formed a second neuraminic acid binding site. Surface glycoprotein phylogeny suggests interspecies transmission and maintenance of AIVs among wild and possibly domestic ducks within the Southern Africa ecosystem. These findings highlight the need for continued monitoring of AIVs in wild and domestic birds in the region.

40|$|The {{perching}} {{ducks and}} related gooselike forms are a {{diverse array of}} some fourteen species that are largely subtropical to tropical in occurrence. Although they vary in size from as little as {{about a half a}} pound in the 2 ̆ 2 pygmy geese 2 ̆ 2 (Nettapus) to more than twenty pounds in the <b>spur-winged</b> <b>geese</b> (Plectropterus), all possess some common features. *These include a tendency toward hole-nesting, especially in trees; sharp claws; associated perching abilities; and long tails that presumably increase braking effectiveness when landing in trees. Nearly all species exhibit extensive iridescent coloration in the body, especially on the upper wing surface; this coloration is often exhibited by females as well as males. As a result, this tribe includes some of the most beautifully arrayed species of the entire family, of which the North American wood duck is an excellent example, as is the closely related Asian mandarin duck (Aix galericulata). The wood duck is the only perching duck that is native to the United States or Canada, but inasmuch as Mexico must be regarded as a part of North America, the inclusion of the muscovy duck as a North American species is fully justified. Perching ducks, together with all of the following groups of waterfowl included in this book, are representatives of the large anatid subfamily Anatinae. Unlike the whistling ducks, swans, or true geese, species of this subfamily have a tarsal scale pattern that has vertically aligned scutes (scutellate condition) above the base of the middle toe, and the sexes are usually quite different in voice, plumage, and sexual behavior. These sexual differences {{can be attributed to the}} weaker and less permanent pair bonds characteristics of true ducks, with a renewal of pair bonds typically occurring each year. As a result, pair-forming behavior tends to be more complex and elaborate in these species, as a dual reflection of the greater and more frequent competition for mates and the need for safeguards in reducing or avoiding mixed pairings between species during the rather hurried pair-forming period. In these species, the males typically assume the initiative in pair-forming activities, and thus they are usually more colorful, more aggressive, and have the more elaborate pair-forming behavior patterns. On the other hand, the females retain a subdued, often concealing plumage pattern, associated with their assumption of most or all incubation and brood-rearing responsibilities. As a result, humans usually find it easy to recognize the distinctively plumaged males of most species, while the females of related species are often so similar that even experienced observers may find it difficult to identify them with certainty. Following the initiation of incubation, the males in this subfamily typically abandon the females and begin their postnuptial molt, during which they become flightless for a time and usually also acquire a more female-like body plumage. Thus, unlike the species in the subfamily Anserinae, typical ducks have two plumages, and thus two body molts, per year. In males this double molt is most apparent, since the 2 ̆ 2 eclipse 2 ̆ 2 plumage attained following the postnuptial molt is usually less colorful and often quite female-like. Although in all the species which have so far been studied the female also has a comparable summer molt and plumage, in most cases this plumage is so similar to the winter plumage that separate descriptions are not necessary. In most cases the 2 ̆ 2 eclipse 2 ̆ 2 plumage of males is held for only a few months, presumably to allow the male to regain the more brilliant plumage associated with pair formation as early as possible. In some cases, however, this 2 ̆ 2 nuptial 2 ̆ 2 plumage is not regained until well into winter (e. g., ruddy duck, Baikal teal, blue-winged teal), so that 2 ̆ 2 summer 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 winter 2 ̆ 2 plumages may be more or less recognizable. The situation is further complicated in the oldsquaw, which has a third partial molt in the fall (affecting both sexes but most apparent in the male) and which is restricted to the scapular region. Except in such special cases, the two major plumages of the male are referred to in the species accounts as 2 ̆ 2 nuptial 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 eclipse 2 ̆ 2 plumages, while the 2 ̆ 2 adult 2 ̆ 2 plumage of females refers to both of the comparable breeding and nonbreeding plumages. The 115 species of waterfowl that belong to the subfamily Anatinae are grouped into a number of tribes, most of which include one or more native North American species. The only major tribe of Anatinae that is not represented in this continent is the shelduck tribe Tadornini, which has representatives in both South America and Eurasia. It is true that there are some old records of Atlantic coast occurrences for the ruddy shelduck (Tadorna ferruginea) and the common shelduck (Tadorna tadorna), as well as a few more recent sight records (Audubon Field Notes, 16 : 73; American Birds, 26 : 842; 27 : 41), but these are quite possibly the result of escapes from captivity...|$|R
50|$|The <b>spur-winged</b> <b>goose</b> (Plectropterus gambensis) {{is a large}} bird in {{the family}} Anatidae, related to the geese and the shelducks, but {{distinct}} from both of these {{in a number of}} anatomical features, and therefore treated in its own subfamily, the Plectropterinae.

50|$|Carpal spurs {{are also}} present in the torrent duck (Merganetta armata). These are {{different}} from the carpal spurs of the <b>spur-winged</b> <b>goose</b> as they are borne on the extensor process. The torrent duck spur has a stout base and tapers quickly to a point. The spurs are typically bigger and more sharply pointed in males than females (0.9-1.7 cm compared to 0.6-1.3 cm). The species name for the duck means ‘armed’, suggesting it was named specifically for its spurs.|$|E
50|$|The <b>spur-winged</b> <b>goose</b> is {{a common}} bird of African wetlands.

This common species feeds by grazing, but spends the middle part of the day resting by water. Its diet consists predominantly of plant matter such as the vegetative parts and seeds of grasses, sedges and aquatic plants, agricultural grains, fruit (e.g. figs) and tuberous crops, although it may occasionally supplement the diet with small fish or insects. Dispersal may occur in pursuit of feeding opportunities outside of the breeding season.|$|E

50|$|A lack {{of field}} {{observations}} limit our knowledge, but intraspecific conflicts {{are known to}} sometimes result in injury or death. The screamers (Anhimidae), some jacanas (Jacana, Hydrophasianus), the <b>spur-winged</b> <b>goose</b> (Plectropterus), the torrent duck (Merganetta) and nine species of lapwing (Vanellus) use a sharp spur on the wing as a weapon. The steamer ducks (Tachyeres), geese and swans (Anserinae), the solitaire (Pezophaps), sheathbills (Chionis), some guans (Crax) and stone curlews (Burhinus) use a bony knob on the alular metacarpal to punch and hammer opponents. The jacanas Actophilornis and Irediparra have an expanded, blade-like radius. The extinct Xenicibis was unique in having an elongate forelimb and massive hand which likely functioned in combat or defence as a jointed club or flail.

The average clutch size of the species is reportedly the smallest {{of any of the}} world's cranes, with an average of 1.6 eggs. Even if there are two eggs, usually only one chick successfully survives to hatch or fledge. The incubation period, roughly 33 to 36 days, is on average the longest of any crane and both parents participate. The chicks are immediately fed by both parents, which take shifts. After around 80 days, the chick(s) start to forage with their parents. At the first sign of any danger, the parents force their young into tall grasses to hide. The fledging period occurs at 100-150 days, the longest it takes any crane to fledge. The young remain with their parents for up to a year (when the next breeding period starts) and may gather in flocks with unrelated juveniles.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>spur-winged</b> <b>goose</b> (Plectropterus gambensis), {{the largest}} of Africa's waterfowl, has {{prominent}} carpal spurs which are not visible when the wings are folded. The spur {{is an extension of}} the radiale: one of the two distal carpal bones. It therefore has a completely novel origin compared to the spurs and spikes seen in screamer and other waterfowl. It is a stout, conical structure that is typically oval in cross-section, but sharp keels are present on the spur in some individuals. The genus name, Plectropterus, is from the Greek plektron, [...] "a cock’s spur" [...] and pteron, [...] "feathers" [...] or [...] "wings". It has been claimed that the spur is used in defence against predators although they have also been described as [...] "especially effective weapons" [...] making this species [...] "the most dangerous of all waterfowl". [...] When disturbed, the male often stretches both wings over the back in the usual manner of a stretching bird. This behaviour brings into view the spurs and white wing patches, and may possibly function as a simple threat display. It has also been claimed that a number of other bird species are known to fight by hitting each other with their wings; some, including screamers, lapwings and spur-winged geese, [...] "have evolved spurs to increase the damage they can wreak".|$|E
50|$|Despite its {{preference}} for ground-dwelling avian prey, a surprisingly {{considerable number of}} water birds may also be attacked. Waterfowl known to be attacked include the 1.18 kg South African shelduck (Tadorna cana), 1 kg yellow-billed duck (Anas undulata), the 4.43 kg <b>spur-winged</b> <b>goose</b> (Plectropterus gambensis) (Africa’s largest waterfowl species) and especially the peculiar, overly bold and aggressive 1.76 kg Egyptian goose (Alopochen aegyptiaca), {{which is one of}} the main prey species for martial eagles in Kruger National Park. Larger wading birds are also fairly frequently attacked including herons and egrets, flamingoes storks, ibises, spoonbills and cranes. The diversity and number of storks taken is particularly impressive. They are known to take 8 species of stork, ranging from the smallest known species, the 1.08 kg African openbill (Anastomus lamelligerus), to the tallest species in the world, the 6.16 kg, 1.5 m-tall saddle-billed stork (Ephippiorhynchus senegalensis). One naturalists observed up to a half dozen attacks in different parts of Africa on 3.45 kg white storks (Ciconia ciconia). Short of three attacks on spotted thick-knees (Burhinus capensis), which weigh about 0.42 kg, so far as is known small waders or shorebirds are ignored as prey. Other assorted avian prey may consists of ostrich (Struthio camelus) chicks (frequently resulting in the immediate ire of protective ostrich parents), sandgrouse, pigeons and doves, hornbills and crows. Beyond occasional captures of other birds of prey (covered later), one other impressive avian prey species is the southern ground hornbill (Bucorvus leadbeateri), which at 3.77 kg is probably the world’s largest hornbill. At the other end of the scale, some martial eagles may capture a few small social species of passerine, which are exceptionally small prey (the smallest recorded prey species for the eagle overall), potentially consisting of the 18.6 g red-billed queleas (Quelea quelea) and the 27.4 g sociable weavers (Philetairus socius), as practically every meat-eating bird in Africa may be attracted to these species’ colonial abundance.|$|E
50|$|Sexual size {{dimorphism}} in {{this species}} {{is perhaps the}} greatest in any neognath bird. Males were considerably larger than females, measuring 90 cm (35 in) in length and weighing up to 28 kg (62 lb), whereas females were 70 cm (28 in) and weighed 17 kg (37 lb). This is only 60% {{of the weight of}} a mature male. Their weight may have varied substantially due to fat cycles, meaning that individuals were fat during cool seasons, but slim during hot seasons, and may have been as low as 21 kg in males and 13 kg in females. Though male pigeons are usually larger than females, there is no direct evidence for the largest specimens actually being the males of the species, and this has only been assumed based on early works. Though the male was probably largest, this can only be confirmed by molecular sexing techniques, and not skeletal morphology alone.Members of both sexes possessed a large tuberous knob of bone exostosis situated {{at the base of the}} carpometacarpus of each wrist. Other wing bones also sometimes show similar structures. The knob was cauliflower-like in appearance, and consisted of up to two or three lobes. The knobs were about half the length of the metacarpus, were larger in males than females, and described as the size of a musket ball. One study measured the largest knob to be 32.9 mm in diameter. The knobs vary in size across individuals, and were entirely absent from 58% of specimens examined for the study. These are thought to be immature birds, or birds without territory. The carpometacarpi of males without the knobs were smaller on average than those with it, but there was little difference between the females. In life, the knobs would have been covered by tough cartilaginous or keratinous integument, which would have made them appear even larger. Carpal spurs and knobs are also known from other extant as well as extinct birds. Within Columbidae, the crowned pigeons and the Viti Levu giant pigeon have outgrowths on the carpometacarpus which are similar to those of the female Rodrigues solitaire. Other well known examples are the steamer ducks, the torrent duck, sheathbills, screamers, the <b>spur-winged</b> <b>goose,</b> and the extinct Xenicibis xympithecus.|$|E
40|$|<b>Spur-winged</b> <b>Goose</b> Muscovy Duck White-winged Wood Duck Comb Duck Hartlaub Duck Green Pygmy Goose Cotton Pygmy Goose African Pygmy Goose Ringed Teal North American Wood Duck Mandarin Duck Australian Wood Duck Brazilian Teal This {{group of}} 13 species of {{primarily}} perching waterfowl {{is a rather}} heterogeneous assemblage of birds that are not easily characterized. In addition to being generally perching and cavity-nesting, they also have fairly wide, rounded wings, elongated tails, and sometimes also relatively long legs. Many of the species exhibit {{a great deal of}} iridescent coloration in their plumage, even among females, and in a few species nearly the entire body plumage is iridescent. In some of these brilliantly colored forms, such as the comb duck, muscovy duck, and the <b>spur-winged</b> <b>goose,</b> there is a great difference in the sizes of the sexes even though they may be very similar in plumage patterning. In spite of their brilliant plumages, males of {{only a few of the}} species exhibit definite eclipse plumages, probably in part because most of the forms are tropical, with long or irregular breeding seasons. Pair bonding is generally seasonally established in the species that breed in temperate climates, while in the more tropical and seemingly more primitive species the pair bonds are weak and in a few cases apparently even nonexistent. The patterns of the downy young are typically well marked and characterized by white or yellow spots and stripes on a darker background; in many species they are not readily separable from the downy young of dabbling ducks. The two tribes are obviously closely related, and taxonomists are not agreed on which group some species such as the ringed teal, pink-eared duck, and Brazilian teal should be included in. However, to merge the tribes would make a comparatively large tribe and tend to obscure the well-defined differences in the behavior patterns and breeding biologies of these two groups...|$|E
