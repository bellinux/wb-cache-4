To evaluate the size and direction of such torques, or effective fields, a number of methods have been employed.

We derive an analytical formula for the harmonic Hall voltages to evaluate the effective field for both out of plane and in-plane magnetized systems. The formula agrees with numerical calculations based on a macrospin model. Two different in-plane magnetized films, Pt|CoFeB|MgO and CuIr|CoFeB|MgO are studied using the formula developed.

40|$|Hysteresis Current Control (HCC) {{is widely}} used due to its {{simplicity}} in implementation, fast and accurate response. However, the main issue is its variable switching frequency which leads to extraswitching losses and injecting high-frequency harmonics into the system current. To solve this problem, adaptive hysteresis current control (AHCC) has been introduced which produces hysteresis bandwidth which instantaneously results in smoother and constant switching frequency. In this paper the instantaneous power theory is used to extract the harmonic components of system current. Then fixed-band hysteresis current control is explained. Because of fixed-band variable frequency disadvantages, the adaptive hysteresis current control is explained that leads to fixing the switching frequency and reducing the high-frequency components in source current waveform. Due to these advantages of AHCC, the switching frequency and switching losses will be diminished appropriately. Some simulations are done in MATLAB/Simulink.

40|$|A {{magnetic}} field free current-induced deterministic switching is demonstrated in a perpendicularly magnetized all-metallic Pt/Co/Pt thin film {{system with a}} small tilt in anisotropy axis. We realized this in devices where the ultrathin Co layer was grown using an oblique angle sputter deposition technique that had resulted in a small tilt of magnetic anisotropy from the film normal. By performing out-of-plane magnetization hysteresis measurements under bias {{magnetic field}} applied along various in-plane directions the tilt angle {{was estimated to be}} around 3. 3 degrees (+/- 0. 3 degrees). A deterministic current-induced magnetization switching could be achieved when the in-plane current was applied perpendicular to the anisotropy tilt axis, but the switching was stochastic when the current was applied {{in the direction of the}} tilt (in the tilt plane). By preparing Pt/Co/Pt stacks with unequal top and bottom Pt thickness, sufficient spin-orbit torque (SOT) could be applied to switch the magnetization of the Co layer at current densities as low as 1. 5 x 10 (7) A/cm(2). The <b>switching</b> phase <b>diagram</b> (SPD) constructed by plotting the critical current density versus applied in-plane magnetic field (HIB x) confirms spin Hall effect based SOT mechanism to be responsible for the magnetization switching. The asymmetry observed in the SPD (about H-x(IB) = 0) is in agreement with the macrospin simulations and it suggests that the tilt in the magnetic anisotropy from the film normal makes the switching deterministic even without an in-plane magnetic field bias...|$|R

SMDs selectively integrate relevant output from network devices by means of tables. SMDs are modular and hierarchical, thereby providing top-down decomposition by means of levelling, allowing a complex network to be partitioned or structured into independent units of an amenable size so that the entire system can be more easily understood. An overview of the entire network or increasing levels of detail may be obtained while maintaining links and interfaces between the different levels. Furthermore, SMDs allow technical detail to be introduced in an integrated and controlled manner, thereby supporting student learning at both introductory and advanced levels. In effect, as students progress {{they do not have}} to learn a new conceptual model; rather they can build upon and extend their existing knowledge.

50|$|Speed flow {{diagrams}} {{are used to}} determine the speed at which the optimum flow occurs. There are currently two shapes of the speed-flow curve. The speed-flow curve also consists of two branches, the freeflow and congested branches. The diagram is not a function, allowing the flow variable to exist at two different speeds. The flow variable existing at two different speeds occurs when the speed is higher and the density is lower or when the speed is lower and the density is higher, which allows for the same flow rate. In the first speed-flow diagram, the freeflow branch is a horizontal line, which shows that the roadway is at freeflow speed until the optimum flow is reached. Once the optimum flow is reached, the <b>diagram</b> <b>switches</b> to the congested branch, which is a parabolic shape. The second speed flow diagram is a parabola. The parabola suggests that the only time there is freeflow speed is when the density approaches zero; it also suggests that as the flow increases the speed decreases. This parabolic graph also contains an optimum flow. The optimum flow also divides the freeflow and congested branches on the parabolic graph.|$|R
40|$|Background: Genetic {{switches}} are {{ubiquitous in}} nature, frequently {{associated with the}} control of cellular functions and developmental programs. In the realm of synthetic biology, it is {{of great interest to}} engineer genetic circuits that can change their mode of operation from monostable to bistable, or even to multistable, based on the experimental fine-tuning of readily accessible parameters. In order to successfully design robust, bistable synthetic circuits to be used as biomolecular probes, or understand modes of operation of such naturally occurring circuits, we must identify parameters that are key in determining their characteristics. Results: Here, we analyze the bistability properties of a general, asymmetric genetic toggle switch based on a chemical-reaction kinetic description. By making appropriate approximations, we are able to reduce the system to two coupled differential equations. Their deterministic stability analysis and stochastic numerical simulations are in excellent agreement. Drawing upon this general framework, we develop a model of an experimentally realized asymmetric bistable genetic switch based on the LacI and TetR repressors. By varying the concentrations of two synthetic inducers, doxycycline and isopropyl β-D- 1 -thiogalactopyranoside, we predict that {{it will be possible to}} repeatedly fine-tune the mode of operation of this genetic switch from monostable to bistable, as well as the switching rates over many orders of magnitude, in an experimental setting. Furthermore, we find that the shape and size of the bistability region is closely connected with plasmid copy number. Conclusions: Based on our numerical calculations of the LacI-TetR asymmetric bistable <b>switch</b> phase <b>diagram,</b> we propose a generic work-flow for developing and applying biomolecular probes: Their initial state of operation should be specified by controlling inducer concentrations, and dilution due to cellular division would turn the probes into memory devices in which information could be preserved over multiple generations.

As their characteristic spatial dimensions are sufficiently small, the shape of these nanoparticles becomes one of the dominant factors in determining their magnetic properties. A great variety of magnetic configurations which do not exist in bulk materials have been observed, and many new phenomena have been discovered recently.; In this thesis, we study the static and quasistatic properties of nanomagnets, including their phase diagrams, anisotropy and magnetization reversal processes. A recently developed scaling approach is shown to be effective for nanomagnetic systems, enabling researchers to use small systems to study larger ones. Regarding the numerical method, instead of the widely used Fast Fourier Transform, we have adapted a Cartesian Coordinates based Fast Multipole Method (FMM) for point dipolar magnetic systems and showed its superiority.; In this thesis, we first analyze the magnetic phase diagrams of single-domain nanoparticles with various geometric shapes, crystalline anisotropies and lattice structures. Then we mainly focus on two geometries: square and ring shapes. For square nanomagnets, a systematic study of the configurational anisotropy (CA) is performed varying their edge length, height, exchange coupling constant and external magnetic field. The CA is a special type of anisotropy, existing only in nanomagnets, which results from the deviation of the magnetization configuration from a uniform distribution. We identified four types of anisotropy symmetry, clarifying some existing confusion in literature. Then, the relation between CA and superparamagnetism is discussed. For ring structures, we have focused on their switching hysteresis curves, namely on their magnetization reversal processes. We discovered three new types of switching mechanisms and present here complete in-plane uniform field <b>switching</b> phase <b>diagrams.</b> We review all the possible (meta) stable states in ring structures and discuss in detail all six different types of switching process.

Spin transfer torque is a promising new mechanism to "write" magnetic storage elements in {{magnetic random access memory}} (MRAM) devices with magnesium oxide (MgO) -based magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) architecture. The first part of our work aims at a quantitative measurement of the spin transfer torque exerted on one of the ferromagnetic electrodes in exactly this type of tunneling structures used for MRAM applications. We use a technique called spin-transfer-driven ferromagnetic resonance (ST-FMR), where we apply a microwave-frequency oscillating current to resonantly excite magnetic precession, and we describe two complementary methods to detect this precession. We resolve previous controversies over the bias dependence of spin transfer torque, and present the first quantitative measurement of spin transfer torque in MgO-based MTJs in full bias range. We also analyze and test the potential to use the ST-FMR technique for microwave detection and microwave amplification. In {{the second part of the}} our work, we fabricate ferromagnetic nanoparticles made of CoFeB or Co embedded in the MgO tunnel barrier of a typical magnetic tunnel junction device, and study the spin transfer torque exerted on these nanoparticles 2 - 3 nm in size.

Essentially, a cPBN is a finite collection of Boolean Networks (BNs) with perturbation (each gene is allowed to randomly change its value at each instant time with a small perturbation probability). This modeling makes the resulting system behave as an ergodic Markov chain possessing a steady-state probability distribution. Switching a BN to another one corresponds to <b>switching</b> the wiring <b>diagram</b> of the network.
