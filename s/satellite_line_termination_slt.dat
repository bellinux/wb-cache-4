40|$|We {{report the}} results of a full-Stokes survey of all four 18 cm OH lines in 77 OH megamasers (OHMs) using the Arecibo Observatory. This is the first survey of OHMs that {{included}} observations of the OH satellite lines; only 4 of the 77 OHMs have existing <b>satellite</b> <b>line</b> observations in the literature. In 5 sources, <b>satellite</b> <b>line</b> emission is detected, with 3 of the 5 sources re-detections of previously published sources. The 2 sources with new detections of <b>satellite</b> <b>line</b> emission are IRAS F 10173 + 0829, which was detected at 1720 MHz, and IRAS F 15107 + 0724, for which both the 1612 MHz and 1720 MHz lines were detected. In IRAS F 15107 + 0724, the <b>satellite</b> <b>lines</b> are partially conjugate, as 1720 MHz absorption and 1612 MHz emission have the same structure at some velocities within the source, along with additional broader 1612 MHz emission. This is the first observed example of conjugate <b>satellite</b> <b>lines</b> in an OHM. In the remaining sources, no <b>satellite</b> <b>line</b> emission is observed. The detections and upper limits are generally consistent with models of OHM emission in which all of the 18 cm OH lines have the same excitation temperature.

The value of the GD ratio (an extended definition of the G ratio that accounts for the effect of resolved and unresolved <b>satellite</b> <b>lines)</b> is significantly enhanced at temperatures below the temperature of He-like maximum abundance. Furthermore it is shown that <b>satellite</b> <b>lines</b> are important contributors to the GD ratio such that GD/G> 1 at temperatures well above the temperature of maximum abundance. These new calculations demonstrate, with an improved treatment of the KLn (n>= 3) <b>satellite</b> <b>lines,</b> that K ALPHA <b>satellite</b> <b>lines</b> need to be included in models of He like spectra even at relatively high temperatures. The excellent agreement between spectra and line ratios calculated from R-matrix and distorted-wave data also confirms the validity of models based on distorted-wave data for highly charged systems, provided the effect of resonances are taken into account as independent processes.
