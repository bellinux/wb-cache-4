Efforts continued to develop a centralized intra-agency safety training program with establishment of the NASA Safety Training Center at the Johnson Space Center (JSC). The objective is to provide quality training for NASA employees and contractors on a broad range of safety-related topics. Courses developed by the Training Center will be presented at various NASA locations to minimize travel and reach the greatest number of people at the least cost. In FY 1991, as part of the ongoing efforts {{to enhance the}} total quality of NASA's safety work force, the Safety Training Center initiated development of a Certified Safety Professional review course. This course provides a comprehensive review of the skills and knowledge that well-rounded safety professionals must possess to qualify for professional certification. FY 1992 will see the course presented to NASA and contractor employees at all installations via the NASA Video Teleconference System...|$|E

40|$|In {{the last}} twenty years, {{aircraft}} maintenance outsourcing has driven strong growth in the third-party Maintenance Repair and Overhaul (MRO) facility industry. In the United States, deficiencies in <b>safety</b> <b>oversight</b> and regulation {{have played a role}} in some maintenance-related incidents. Since then, Congress wrote legislation to require the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to improve its <b>safety</b> <b>oversight,</b> particularly of offshore facilities. However, there has been no such pressure driving improvement in Australia. Questions have been raised about the poor practices in some offshore MRO facilities and about the <b>safety</b> <b>oversight</b> of offshored maintenance. This article argues that the existing system, based on International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) standards, cannot provide certainty that the planes of Australian-registered airlines are maintained to best practice standards. This is for two reasons: the regulations have gaps and enforcement of the regulations leaves much to be desired...|$|R
