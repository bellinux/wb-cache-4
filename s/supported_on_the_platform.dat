40|$|Abstract. The {{resources}} that product design relies on are more distributed than ever {{along with the}} varying of the global design environment. More and more resources outside of enterprises are needed during the product design process. The Modern Product Design platform supporting the product design under the circumstance of distributed resources will meet the requirement of the enterprise's product design and development under such conditions, and will simplify {{the implementation of the}} IT support system for integration of design resources outside of enterprises. In this paper the characteristics and supporting technologies of product modern design platform, which supporting the distributed design resource circumstance and centering on the enterprise, are studied. The building method of the platform is presented and a prototype of the product design platform is developed. Three subsystems are included in the platform; they are product requirements analysis system, product design planning system and design knowledge management system. Many design tasks can be <b>supported</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>platform,</b> such as product requirement analysis, concept design, detail design, and experiment. The distributing, implementing, tracking and managing of product design lifecycle tasks can also be <b>supported</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>platform.</b> The distributed design resources could be sealed as application components to provide design services. Design work flow model and knowledge flow model are built and controlled on the design platform. The design knowledge is managed based on the Six-Dimension Knowledge Classification...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the process of}} designing and implementing a debugger with a graphical user interface that is to execute under OS X on Apple Macintosh computers. Desired functionality have been specified, {{taking into account the}} experience of some debuggers I have had previous experience with. The areas requiring investigation have been specified and investigated one by one and smaller programs that solves the specific problem have been written and tested. These areas are: Launching a program {{under the control of the}} debugger. Attaching the debugger to an executing program that was not launched by the debugger. Suspend and resume execution of the target program. Target program signal and exception handling in the debugger. Stepwise execution of the target program. Breakpoints; points in the target program at which execution is to be stopped. Monitoring of the target program reading and/or writing of selected addresses in memory, i. e. watchpoints. Managing threads in the target program. Reading and writing of object files, i. e. files containing executable code. Disassembling machine code. Accessing CPU register contents of the target program. Accessing target program memory. Interpretion of machine code instructions. Design that facilitates porting of the debugger to other platforms and future changes. The work has been limited to finding solutions to in the thesis mentioned issues, not to compare different solutions of the same problem. The result is that solutions to all above mentioned areas have been found, although the solutions, in some cases, does not perform optimally due to the nature of the problem and the lack of hardware <b>support</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>platform</b> in question. <b>The</b> size of the project and the limited time available for a master's thesis have prevented the completion of the design of the debugger and the implementation of more than very basic functionality.

40|$|Providing {{performance}} and isolation guarantees for applications running in virtualized datacenter environments requires continuous {{management of the}} underlying physical resources. For communication- and I/O-intensive applications running <b>on</b> such <b>platforms,</b> <b>the</b> management methods must adequately deal with the shared use of the high-performance fabrics these applications require. In particular, new classes of latency-sensitive and data-intensive workloads running in virtualized environments rely on emerging fabrics like 40 +Gbps Ethernet and InfiniBand/RoCE with support for RDMA, VMM-bypass and hardware-level virtualization (SR-IOV). However, the benefits provided by these technology advances are offset by several management constraints: (i) {{the inability of the}} hypervisor to monitor the VMs’ usage of these fabrics can affect <b>the</b> <b>platform’s</b> ability to provide isolation and performance guarantees, (ii) the hypervisor cannot provide fine-grained I/O provisioning or perform management decisions for VMs, thus reducing the degree of consolidation that can be <b>supported</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>platforms,</b> and (iii) without such support it is harder to integrate these fabrics into emerging cloud computing platforms and datacenter fabric management solutions. This is made particularly challenging for workloads spanning multiple VMs, utilizing physical resources distributed across multiple server nodes and the interconnection fabric. This thesis addresses the problem of realizing a flexible, dynamic resource management system for virtualized platforms with high performance fabrics. We make the following key contributions: (i) A lightweight monitoring tool, IBMon, integrated with the hypervisor to monitor VMs’ use of RDMA-enabled virtualized interconnects, using memory introspection techniques. (ii) The design and construction of a resource management system that leverages IBMon to provide latency-sensitive applications performance guarantees. This system is built on microeconomic principles of supply and demand and can be deployed on a per-node (Resource Exchange) or a multi-node (Distributed Resource Exchange) basis. Fine-grained resource allocations can be enforced through several mechanisms, including CPU capping or fabric-level congestion control. (iii) Sphinx, a fabric management solution that leverages Resource Exchange to orchestrate network and provide latency proportionality for consolidated workloads, based on user/application-specified policies. (iv) Implementation and experimental evaluation using InfiniBand clusters virtualized with the Xen or KVM hypervisor, managed via the OpenFloodlight SDN controller, and using representative data-intensive and latency-sensitive benchmarks.

ConclusionAquatic exercise had positive effects when analyzing the sensory condition suggesting maintenance of postural control. However, when analyzed post aquatic exercise in closed eyes condition and the interaction effects of visual condition did not improve postural stability.

40|$|A {{series of}} recent {{algorithmic}} advances has delivered highly effective methods for pairing evaluation and parameter generation. However, the resulting multitude of options means many different variations of base field must ideally be <b>supported</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> target <b>platform.</b> Typical hardware accelerators {{in the form}} of co-processors possess neither the flexibility nor the scalability to support fields of different characteristic and order. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> other hand, extending the instruction set of a general-purpose processor by custom instructions for field arithmetic allows to combine the performance of hardware with the flexibility of software.
