25|$|Solar {{power in}} Israel and the Israeli solar energy {{industry}} {{has a history}} that dates to {{the founding of the}} country. In the 1950s, Levi Yissar developed a <b>solar</b> <b>water</b> <b>heater</b> to help assuage an energy shortage in the new country. By 1967 around one in twenty households heated their water with the sun and 50,000 solar heaters had been sold. With the 1970s oil crisis, Harry Zvi Tabor, the father of Israel's solar industry, developed the prototype <b>solar</b> <b>water</b> <b>heater</b> that is now used in over 90% of Israeli homes. Israeli engineers are {{on the cutting edge of}} solar energy technology, and its solar companies work on projects around the world.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Solar</b> <b>water</b> <b>heaters</b> {{can operate}} in any climate. Performance varies {{depending}} on how much solar energy is available at the site, as well as how cold the water coming into the system is. The colder the water, the more efficiently the system operates. [...] <b>Solar</b> <b>water</b> <b>heaters</b> reduce the need for conventional water heating by about two-thirds and pay for their installation within 4 to 8 years with electricity or natural gas savings. Compared to those with electric <b>water</b> <b>heaters,</b> Florida homeowners with <b>solar</b> <b>water</b> <b>heaters</b> save 50 to 85 percent on their water heating bills, according to the Florida Solar Energy Center.|$|R

2500|$|During the 1950s, Australia's Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) {{carried out}} world leading {{research}} into flat plate solar water heaters. A <b>solar</b> <b>water</b> <b>heater</b> manufacturing industry was subsequently established in Australia {{and a large}} proportion of the manufactured product was exported. Four of the original companies are still in business and the manufacturing base has now expanded to 24 companies. Despite an excellent solar resource, the penetration of solar water heaters in the Australian domestic market was only about 5% in 2006, with new dwellings accounting for most sales. By 2014, around 14% of Australian households had solar hot water installed [...] It is estimated that by installing a solar hot water system, it could reduce a family's CO2 emissions up to 3tonnes per year while saving up to 80% of the energy costs for water heating.|$|E
