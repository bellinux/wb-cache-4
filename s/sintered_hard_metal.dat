40|$|Protective layers exhibiting {{abrasive}} wear resistance similare {{to that of}} conventional WC/Co hard metal can be repeatably produced by laser cladding using powder mixtures consisting of hard material and binder components. As an advantage compared to sintered hard metals, the claddings can be immediately applied to the load bearing faces. Strong bonding to the base material can be achieved. Unlike <b>sintered</b> <b>hard</b> <b>metal,</b> the claddings show maximum wear resistence with non- dissolved hard material contents as low as 40 - 50 percent. Thus the claddings are rather ductile, which implies higher resistence to fatigue, impact, and thermal shock. The optimized WC/Co-NiBSi system performs best results with respect to wear, flaws, and cost. Fused tungsten carbide exhibits equivalent wear resistance but the layers may be flawed. Claddings with Stellite 21 binder show minimum wear at contents of 35 vol percent hard material, though cracking and debonding spoil the over-all performance.

40|$|The {{outgassing}} and sintering processes occurring {{during the}} heating period are very decisive {{for the quality}} of the <b>sintered</b> <b>hard</b> <b>metal.</b> The largest proportion of the compaction takes place in the solid state, i. e. before the formation of the liquid phase. In the intensive stage of shrinkage the reduction of porosity is determined by particle rearrangements. On the other hand the solution of tungsten and carbon in the cobalt binder is determined by diffusion-controlled processes. The formation of the eutectic and the solution of tungsten and carbon in the cobalt binder are characterized by calorimetric studies (DSC) and determination of the Curie temperature (magnetic transformation) by means of a special thermobalance. The effects are shown to be closely correlated with sintering conditions, cobalt content and WC grain size. Additionally in-situ measurement of volatile components during outgassing and sintering (evolved gas analysis by means of thermobalance-mass spectrometer coupling) allow s the characterization of relevant mechanisms (e. g. reduction of oxidic impurities of the binder and the hard material). The results yield new possibilities of optimization of temperature-time-atmosphere-profiles for the production of hard metals...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Extensive {{work has}} been {{performed}} on WC-Co hard metals for mining tools, tool inserts and other components. Cobalt is widely used as the binder metal because it’s good wetting behavior and solubility. However, the cost is high. Fe-Cr-Ni alloys show similar characteristics to Cobalt regard to melting temperature and crystal structure. Additionally, Fe-Cr-Ni alloys are a less expensive and nontoxic alternative. The present work analyze sintering characteristics of the WC / Fe-Cr-Ni alloys composite and development of new <b>sintered</b> <b>hard</b> <b>metal</b> composite for mining tools.

40|$|<b>Hard</b> <b>metals</b> are powder {{metallurgical}} products {{composed of}} WC and Co. Applications for such materials include cutting tools and wear resistant parts. Optimization of the <b>sintering</b> of <b>hard</b> <b>metals</b> {{requires an understanding}} of complex changes in the solid, liquid and gas phase chemistries.

40|$|Two of {{the major}} {{problems}} in powder technology are cracking of the parts during die pressing and shape distortions during sintering, the latter being more severe the more the material shrinks. Limitations to the geometrical accuracy of the parts arise also from the (anisotropic) spring-back during unloading and ejection after pressing. These problems are addressed by finite element modelling. First, phenomenological and micromechanical models for powder compaction during die pressing are described including one with evolving anisotropy. Second, crack formation during pressing and ejection is modelled as a strain localization process in the finite element simulation. Third, a model for liquid phase sintering is described, which includes particle rearrangement, contact flattening by the solution/precipitation mechanism and grain coarsening.

40|$|The most {{economic}} and {{most frequently used}} production route in powder technology is uniaxial die pressing of the powder at ambient temperature and subsequent sintering of the powder compact at high temperature.

In this project only sintered steels were considered. The main problem {{in the production of}} complex sinter metal parts is the occurrence of cracks that develop during pressing and ejection. Hence the primary goal of the present simulation effort was to investigate the conditions for crack formation and to formulate appropriate constitutive equations describing cracking as a consequence of strain localization. Another challenge for the powder metal industry is the increasing demand for geometrical accuracy. A controlling factor for the achievable accuracy is the elastic spring-back of the pressed part during unloading and ejec tion.

40|$|Kinetic {{analysis}} {{is a novel}} approach for understanding and improving processes during <b>sintering</b> of <b>hard</b> <b>metals</b> or other <b>hard</b> materials. With {{the determination of the}} kinetics using experimental results of property changes during heating, it is possible to obtain information about the specific mechanisms and to optimise the time-temperature atmosphere-profiles. Other new developments in the field of in-situ characterisation of processes during sintering are the application of macro devices for investigation of components instead of small material samples and the advancement of simultaneous techniques. The following processes are discussed: (1) desorption or vaporisation (and cracking respectively) of air, water, residues of milling liquids and lubricants; (2) melting of lubricants and WC-Co eutectics; (3) decomposition of residual hydrocarbons related to milling liquids and lubricants; (4) reduction of oxidic impurities and (5) mass transport phenomena and densification during sintering. These reactions result in length changes, mass changes, thermal effects and gas formation. They are characterised by means of thermoanalytical methods (Thermodilatometry, Differentia! Thermal Analysis, and Mass Spectrometry). Examples for the kinetic analysis of the results are presented. Kinetic {{analysis is}} a tool to model complex thermal behaviour with few parameters. The model can then be used for predictions and for process optimization. Simultaneous complex thermal analysis of outgassing, melting of the binder phase and sintering gives accurate insights into the relationship between these processes. This knowledge is important because with increasing temperatures of outgassing the sensitivity of product quality to process parameters also increases. If the outgassing takes place at unfavourable temperatures (where the shrinkage rates are too high if active surfaces are created or gasses are entrapped) pores or disturbances of the carbon balance may occur. This knowledge may also be used for the optimisation of technical processes. The thermoanalytical data are a key to understanding critical temperature ranges for product quality (initiation of reactions and ranges with high reaction rates). Thermoanalytical methods are particularly powerful for the determination of the influence of changes in material or process parameters...|$|R

METHODS: All of the workers in a <b>hard</b> <b>metal</b> company (583 men and 120 women) were examined for smoking, respiratory symptoms, ventilatory function, occupational history of exposure to <b>hard</b> <b>metal,</b> and present exposure to airborne cobalt. The ventilatory function indices (forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1), forced expiratory volume in one second per cent (FEV 1 %), peak expiratory flow (PEF), mid-maximal flow (MMF), forced expiratory flow at 50 % vital capacity (V 50), forced expiratory flow at 25 % vital capacity (V 25)) were standardised for height and age and expressed {{as a percentage of}} predicted values. RESULTS: Two way analysis of variance of indices of ventilatory function showed that an interaction of <b>hard</b> <b>metal</b> exposure and smoking decreased %V 50 for both men and women. Among the currently exposed men, those with asthmatic symptoms (defined as reversible dispnoea with wheeze) had significantly lower %FVC, %FEV 1 %, %PEF, %MMF, %V 50, and %V 25 than did workers without asthma. The ventilatory disfunction did not differ between exposed and non-exposed workers with asthmatic symptoms. Even among the men without asthmatic symptoms, %V 50 was significantly lowered by the interaction of <b>hard</b> <b>metal</b> exposure and smoking. The multilinear regression analysis of indices of ventilatory function for all of the subjects on sex, smoking (Brinkman index), exposure to <b>hard</b> <b>metal,</b> and asthmatic symptoms showed that asthmatic symptoms and smoking had significant effects on all variables and that the decrease in %V 25 was associated with <b>hard</b> <b>metal</b> exposure.

A full job history could be obtained for 95 % of the subjects. The cohort was followed up from January 1968  to December 1992.  The exposure was assessed by an industry specific job exposure matrix (JEM) characterising exposure to <b>hard</b> <b>metal</b> dust from 1  to 9  and other possibly carcinogenic exposures as present or absent. Smoking information was obtained by interview of former workers. Standard lifetable methods and Poisson regression were used for the statistical analysis of the data.  RESULTS—Mortality from all causes was close to the expected (standardised mortality ratio (SMR) 1. 02,  399  deaths) whereas mortality from lung cancer was significantly increased among men (SMR 1. 70; 46  deaths, 95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) 1. 24  to 2. 26). By workshop, lung cancer mortality was significantly higher than expected in <b>hard</b> <b>metal</b> production before <b>sintering</b> (SMR 2. 42; nine deaths; 95 %CI 1. 10  to 4. 59) and among maintenance workers (SMR 2. 56; 11  deaths; 95 %CI 1. 28  to 4. 59), whereas after sintering the SMR was lower (SMR 1. 28; five deaths; 95 %CI 0. 41  to 2. 98). The SMR for all exposures to <b>hard</b> <b>metal</b> dust at a level > 1 in the JEM was in significant excess (SMR 2. 02; 26  deaths; 95 %CI 1. 32  to 2. 96).

Furthermore, it was found that atopy, positive IgE antibody against cobalt, and age of 40 or older were significantly correlated with asthmatic symptoms. Multilogistic analysis on the same factors and smoking in all of the workers showed that the age, experience of <b>hard</b> <b>metal</b> exposure, and atopy were significant risk factors associated with the asthmatic symptoms. Multilogistic analysis of data for currently exposed and non-exposed workers also showed that age and atopy were risk factors, and that the exposure to cobalt at the low concentration (at or below 50 micrograms/m 3) but not at the higher concentration was a significant risk factor. Exposure to mist of coolants containing ionic cobalt, used during grinding, was not found to be any more hazardous in terms of onset of asthmatic symptoms than exposure to <b>hard</b> <b>metal</b> dust containing metallic cobalt. CONCLUSIONS: Accordingly, it is concluded that both environmental factors and individual susceptibility should be taken into consideration in efforts to reduce the prevalence of <b>hard</b> <b>metal</b> asthma...|$|R
