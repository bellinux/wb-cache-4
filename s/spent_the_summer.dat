Threatened by Harold's fleet, Tostig moved north and raided in East Anglia and Lincolnshire, {{but he was}} driven back to his ships by the brothers Edwin, Earl of Mercia, and Morcar, Earl of Northumbria. Deserted by most of his followers, Tostig withdrew to Scotland, where he <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> <b>summer</b> recruiting fresh forces. King Harold <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> <b>summer</b> on the south coast with a large army and fleet waiting for William to invade, {{but the bulk of}} his forces were militia who needed to harvest their crops, so on 8 September Harold dismissed them.|$|E
