50|$|In November 2011 DeLange {{released}} her new single DoLuv2LuvU. The song was the theme <b>song</b> <b>of</b> <b>Serious</b> Request 2011, a big charity-event held yearly by Dutch radio station 3FM. While promoting the single, DeLane heard {{her father was}} incurably ill. She immediately stopped all kinds of promotion and postponed the recording process of her new album DoLuv2LuvU. Though the song wasn't promoted, it still charted at #14. A day after her father's death, at January 10, 2012, she posted an acoustic version <b>of</b> her <b>song</b> Without You on Twitter, which featured on her 2007 live album. Later that year, Ilse revealed that the DoLuv2LuvU-album was shelved and she started recording a new album. This is because she didn't feel {{the flow of the}} album anymore after her father had died. She doesn't rule out the possibility it's going to be released in the future. In June 2012, the first single from her sophomore album, Hurricane was released. It charted at #23 in the Dutch Top 40. Her seventh album Eye Of The Hurricane, was released September 14, 2012 and got Platinum in only a few weeks. Second single Winter of Love rose to #20 and third single We Are One got to #33.|$|R

5000|$|Ialemus in Greek mythology was {{a similar}} {{personification}} {{to that of}} Linus, and hence also called a son of Apollo and Calliope, and the inventor <b>of</b> the <b>song</b> Ialemus, which {{was a kind of}} dirge, or at any rate a <b>song</b> <b>of</b> a very <b>serious</b> and mournful character, and is only mentioned as sung on most melancholy occasions. (Aeschyl. Suppl. 106 Eurip, Herc. Fur. 109, SuppL 283.) In later times, this kind of poetry lost its popularity, and was ridiculed by the comic poets. Ialemus then became synonymous with cold and frosty poetry, and was used in this sense proverbially. (Schol. ad Eurip. Orest. 1375, ad Apotton.Rhod. iv. 1304 Zenob. iv. 39.) ...|$|R

50|$|Burlesques <b>of</b> <b>serious</b> {{works were}} in great vogue on the London {{stage at the}} time and the tragi-comic song became a sensation. Its {{popularity}} grew the following year when it was adopted by the Anglo-American entertainer Sam Cowell, who took it into a broader range of venues.

By then the song had already spread to Australia and North America.|$|R

40|$|Ph. D. Thesis ABSTRACT Mgr. Veronika Kristková, LL. M., 2013 Position {{of victims}} of human rights {{violations}} in international law with focus on victims <b>of</b> <b>serious</b> violations <b>of</b> human rights and international humantiarian law This work focuses within the broad theme of " Position {{of the victims of}} the human rights violations in international law" on victims <b>of</b> <b>serious</b> human rights violations and <b>serious</b> violations <b>of</b> international humanitarian law (hereinafter only serious violations). The author decided to focus on the victims <b>of</b> <b>serious</b> violations because the research revealed that while the rights {{of victims of}} human rights violations are in general relatively settled in theory as well in practice of international law, the rights of the victims <b>of</b> <b>serious</b> violations is an area, which raises several doctrinal questions, encountered rapid development in recent years and continues to develop. Analysis of the rights of the victims <b>of</b> <b>serious</b> violations necessary must be based {{on the rights of the}} victims of human rights violations in general, which serves as a baseline for the analysis of the rights of the victims <b>of</b> <b>serious</b> violations. Only in comparison with the general rights of the victims of human rights violations the specificities of the rights of the victims <b>of</b> <b>serious</b> violations stand up.

40|$|I {{offer an}} account <b>of</b> <b>serious</b> crime {{that goes beyond}} victimizing crimes {{committed}} by individuals against other individuals. This approach extends the well-known framework offered by Von Hirsch and Jareborg to include crimes undermining welfare-producing institutions. I then consider how the seriousness of crime justifies preventive measures, including the criminalization of acts preparatory to the commission <b>of</b> <b>serious</b> crime. I shall defend preventive measures, including highly intrusive ones, for the most serious crimes, such as terrorism {{in the form of}} mass killing, but I shall take issue with very expansive conceptions <b>of</b> <b>serious</b> crime that include what are intuitively much less serious offences than terrorism or murder. In England and Wales, the Serious Crime Act (2007) lists relevant types <b>of</b> <b>serious</b> crime in its Schedule 1.

40|$|Why do the {{development}} of the number <b>of</b> <b>serious</b> road injuries and {{the development}} of the number of road fatalities differ? : an analysis {{of the differences between the}} developments. The number of road fatalities in the Netherlands and in many other highly motorized countries has been decreasing steadily for years. The decrease of the number <b>of</b> <b>serious</b> road injuries, however, has not kept pace. SWOV investigated what the explanations could be for this difference. The following research questions were used: 1. Can similar developments be observed in other countries?; 2. Which road user groups have shown a different development of the number <b>of</b> <b>serious</b> road injuries in recent years?; and 3. Which explanations can be found? In research question 2, a different development of the number <b>of</b> <b>serious</b> road injuries refers to a different development from that of the number of road fatalities. This can be a small decrease, a stagnant decrease or even an increase in the number <b>of</b> <b>serious</b> road injuries...|$|R

40|$|Over recent years, {{the focus}} in road safety has shifted towards a greater {{understanding}} <b>of</b> road crash <b>serious</b> injuries in addition to fatalities. Police reported crash data are often {{the primary source of}} crash information; however, the definition <b>of</b> <b>serious</b> injury within these data is not consistent across jurisdictions and may not be accurately operationalised. This study examined the linkage of police-reported road crash data with hospital data to explore the potential for linked data to enhance the quantification <b>of</b> <b>serious</b> injury. Data from the Queensland Road Crash Database (QRCD), the Queensland Hospital Admitted Patients Data Collection (QHAPDC), Emergency Department Information System (EDIS), and the Queensland Injury Surveillance Unit (QISU) for the year 2009 were linked. Nine different estimates <b>of</b> <b>serious</b> road crash injury were produced. Results showed that there was a large amount of variation in the estimates of the number and profile <b>of</b> <b>serious</b> road crash injuries depending on the definition or measure used. The results also showed that as the definition <b>of</b> <b>serious</b> injury becomes more precise the vulnerable road users become more prominent. These results have major implications in terms <b>of</b> how <b>serious</b> injuries are identified for reporting purposes. Depending on the definitions used, the calculation of cost and understanding of the impact <b>of</b> <b>serious</b> injuries would vary greatly. This study has shown how data linkage can be used to investigate issues of data quality. It has also demonstrated the potential improvements {{to the understanding of the}} road safety problem, particularly serious injury, by conducting data linkage...|$|R
40|$|This diploma thesis {{with the}} topic of,,The Concept <b>of</b> <b>Serious</b> Harm in Refugee Law" had three basic {{objective}}s.
