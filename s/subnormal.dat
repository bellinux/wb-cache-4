5|$|Beginning {{with only}} two {{teachers}} and 26 students in a single classroom in Towner Road, the new association rapidly expanded over the 1960s, building special schools at Margaret Drive and Jurong, a sheltered workshop at Geylang, a residential home at Tampines {{as well as their}} main administration centre, Lee Kong Chian Centre. SARC started a subcommittee for services for those with less severe intellectual disabilities in 1971 and a youth volunteering group the year after; the subcommittee was split into an independent organisation, the Association for the Educationally <b>Subnormal</b> (AESN), in 1976. In 1983 SARC launched the first early intervention programme in Singapore, prompting other organisations to follow suit and set up an adjunct subcommittee that became Special Olympics Singapore.|$|E
25|$|A {{composition}} {{series is}} a maximal <b>subnormal</b> series.|$|E
25|$|A {{refinement}} {{of a series}} is another series containing each {{of the terms of}} the original series. Two <b>subnormal</b> series are said to be equivalent or isomorphic if there is a bijection between the sets of their factor groups such that the corresponding factor groups are isomorphic. Refinement gives a partial order on series, up to equivalence, and they form a lattice, while <b>subnormal</b> series and normal series form sublattices. The existence of the supremum of two <b>subnormal</b> series is the Schreier refinement theorem. Of particular interest are maximal series without repetition.|$|E
25|$|A hyponormal compact {{operator}} (in particular, a <b>subnormal</b> operator) is normal.|$|E
25|$|A {{nilpotent}} {{series is}} a <b>subnormal</b> series such that successive quotients are nilpotent.|$|E
25|$|For a <b>subnormal</b> series, {{the length}} {{is the number}} of nontrivial factor groups.|$|E
25|$|A {{solvable}} group, or soluble group, is {{one with}} a <b>subnormal</b> series whose factor groups are all abelian.|$|E
25|$|Limited {{exponent}} range: results might overflow yielding infinity, or underflow {{yielding a}} <b>subnormal</b> number or zero. In these cases precision will be lost.|$|E
25|$|<b>Subnormal</b> numbers {{ensure that}} for finite floating-point numbers x and y, x − y = 0 if {{and only if}} x = y, as expected, but which did not hold under earlier floating-point representations.|$|E
25|$|Equivalently, a <b>subnormal</b> {{series for}} which {{each of the}} A'i is a maximal normal {{subgroup}} of A'i+1. Equivalently, a composition series is a normal series for which each of the factor groups are simple.|$|E
25|$|A {{study in}} Sweden {{investigated}} {{the impact of}} environmental factors on NMDs. The study indicated {{that there might be}} an impact of low or <b>subnormal</b> maternal BMI before and during pregnancy, maternal infection, such as rubella, and maternal smoking on fetal brain development, including neuronal migration. The roles of maternal BMI and congenital infections should be tested in future analytical studies.|$|E
25|$|First-level nurses make up {{the bulk}} of the {{registered}} nurses in the UK. They were previously known by titles such as RGN (registered general nurse), RSCN (registered sick children's nurse), RMN (registered mental nurse) and RNMS (registered nurse (for the) mentally <b>subnormal).</b> The titles used now are similar, including RNA (registered nurse adult), RNC (registered nurse child), RNMH (registered nurse mental health) and RNLD (registered nurse learning disabilities).|$|E
25|$|The race theory sees {{some support}} in {{findings}} by Marzi et al., where patients who show extinction also display aggravated delays in their reaction time to stimuli, both {{when compared to}} patients who have other forms of right-brain damage and undamaged patients. In the study, patients were shown {{to be able to}} focus their attention and improve reaction time, but still have <b>subnormal</b> performance. This theory is given further support by Gorea and Sagi’s inducing of extinction-like events in undamaged patients when presented with simultaneous stimuli of different intensities, with the lower intensity stimulus being extinguished by the mere presence of the high intensity stimulus.|$|E
25|$|Much {{discussion}} has occurred {{as to the}} level of Bryant's mental health. It is generally accepted that he has a <b>subnormal</b> IQ (estimated at 66, and in the lowest 2% of his age group) and {{at the time of the}} offences was in receipt of a Disability Support Pension on the basis of being mentally handicapped. Reports that he had schizophrenia were based on his mother's misinterpretation of psychiatric advice; Bryant had never been diagnosed with schizophrenia, nor any major depressive disorder. Media reports also detailed his odd behaviour as a child. However, he was able to drive a car and obtain a gun, despite lacking a gun licence or a driver's licence. This was a matter which, in the public debate that followed, was widely regarded as a telling demonstration of the inadequacy of the nation's gun laws.|$|E
25|$|In 1967, local {{authorities}} were empowered to provide family planning advice to any who requested {{it and to}} provide supplies free of charge. In addition, medical training was expanded following the Todd Report on medical education in 1968. In addition, National Health expenditure rose from 4.2% of GNP in 1964 to 5% in 1969 and spending on hospital construction doubled. The Health Services and Public Health Act 1968 empowered {{local authorities}} to maintain workshops for the elderly either directly or via the agency of a voluntary body. A Health Advisory Service was later established to investigate and confront the problems of long-term psychiatric and mentally <b>subnormal</b> hospitals in the wave of numerous scandals. The Family Planning Act 1967 empowered local authorities {{to set up a}} family planning service with free advice and means-tested provision of contraceptive devices while the Clean Air Act 1968 extended powers to combat air pollution. More money was also allocated to hospitals treating the mentally ill. In addition, a Sports Council was set up to improve facilities. Direct government expenditure on sports more than doubled from £0.9 million in 1964/65 to £2 million in 1967/68, while 11 regional Sports Councils had been set up by 1968. In Wales, five new health centres had been opened by 1968, whereas none had been opened from 1951 to 1964, while spending on health and welfare services in the region went up from £55.8 million in 1963/64 to £83.9 million in 1967/68.|$|E

Pringle brought attention to five previous reports, two of which were unpublished. Pringle's adenoma sebaceum would become a common eponym for the facial rash.|$|E

I am even <b>subnormal.</b> At twenty I {{believed}} myself passionate: one does at that age. But now, when I come to consider myself candidly, I find that I am really {{one of those who}} never deeply felt nor strongly willed. Everything is profoundly indifferent to me. I sometimes try to depress myself with the thought that the world is a cess-pool, that men are pathetic degenerates from the ape whose laboriously manufactured ideals are pure nonsense and find no rhyme in reality, that the whole of life is a bad joke which takes a long time coming to an end. But it really doesn't upset me. I don't care a curse. It's deplorable; one ought to care. The best people do care. Still, I must say I should like to get possession of Miss Toomis.
