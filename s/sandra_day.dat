50|$|The sisters {{moved to}} Detroit, Michigan, using the names Sandra and Carolyn Wu-San. There, they devoted {{their time to}} {{practicing}} the martial arts. Because of the girls' young age, talent, and unique bond as sisters, their practice evolved into a secret, perfected language that only they could share. Out of love for her sister, Sandra held back in her spars with Carolyn. The assassin David Cain saw this restraint in <b>Sandra</b> one <b>day</b> when he visited Detroit to see the siblings perform. Considering Sandra a kindred spirit, Cain murdered Carolyn, in order to remove the obstruction that blunted Sandra's true potential.|$|R

500|$|Reaching {{tropical}} storm status on November24, Sandra was the fourth-latest forming {{tropical storm}} in the Northeastern Pacific basin since reliable records began. Upon becoming a hurricane at 06:00UTC on November25, Sandra was the second-latest such storm on {{record in the}} Northeastern Pacific; only Hurricane Winnie of 1983—the only December hurricane on record in the basin—formed later. This also marked the record-tying 16th hurricane to form in the Pacific north of the equator and east of the International Dateline; this record is shared with 1990, 1992, and 2014. When it further became a major hurricane at 00:00UTC on November26, Sandra was the latest-forming such storm in the Northeastern Pacific basin on record. It surpassed the previous record set by Hurricane Kenneth in 2011 by nearly four <b>days.</b> <b>Sandra</b> was also the ninth major hurricane in the Northeastern Pacific proper and the eleventh east of the dateline, both setting a record for the most in a single season. Sandra's peak intensity with winds of 150mph (240km/h) and pressure of 934mbar (hPa; 27.58inHg) ranked it as the strongest November hurricane on record in the Northeastern Pacific, surpassing Hurricane Kenneth's 145mph (230km/h) and 940mbar (hPa; 27.76inHg). On a global scale, Sandra was the 30th major hurricane and [...] "record-shattering" [...] 25th Category4 or 5 storm of 2015; the previous records were 23 and 18, respectively, occurring in both 1997 and 2004.|$|R
50|$|On February 8, 2017, Thomas was {{revealed}} to be a contestant on the 34th season of Survivor, entitled Survivor: Game Changers. Amongst all the players that won on their first try, Thomas is the first male winner to play three times. He started on the Nuku tribe which won the first two challenges. Thomas was the only original Nuku member to remain on Nuku after the tribal split. At Nuku, he took the tribe fishing in the ocean, but at one point, he left the tribe, went back to camp and tried to find the hidden immunity idol but was unsuccessful. He later formed a bond with Malcolm Freberg, to whom Thomas suggested that they vote out fellow Heroes vs. Villains castmate <b>Sandra</b> Diaz-Twine. On <b>Day</b> 11, Jeff Probst announced that only one tribe would win immunity {{and the other two}} tribes would go to Tribal Council. Tavua won immunity. Probst then said that both Mana and Nuku would go to Tribal Council together and vote out one person. At the Nuku camp, Thomas suggested that they vote out Tai Trang for being sneaky, but Diaz-Twine wanted Sierra Dawn Thomas (no relation) out. During a chaotic Tribal Council, J.T. went to Brad Culpepper and told him that Sierra was the target and he should vote for Diaz-Twine. However, this plan backfired as Trang played his hidden immunity idol on Sierra and Mana's votes sent Freberg out of the game.|$|R

In her dedication speech, O'Connor advocated for civility among those in the legal profession and for avoiding personal attacks among lawyers. In December 2005, the school's moot courtroom was used for a real civil trial after the Marion County Courthouse was damaged the previous month.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the 20th century, a few Roman Catholics were appointed, but {{concerns}} about {{diversity of the}} Court were mainly in terms of geographic diversity, to represent all geographic regions of the country, as opposed to ethnic, religious, or gender diversity.

The 21st century saw the first appointment of a Hispanic justice (Sonia Sotomayor, 2009), if justice Benjamin Cardozo, who was a Sephardi Jew of Portuguese descent and appointed in 1932, is excluded.|$|E
30|$|Since {{the exact}} {{date of birth}} of π is unknown, one could imagine that π existed before the {{universe}} came into being and will exist after the universe is gone. Its appearance in the disks of the Moon and the Sun, makes {{it as one of}} the most ancient numbers known to humanity. It keeps on popping up inside as well as outside the scientific community, for example, in many formulas in geometry and trigonometry, physics, complex analysis, cosmology, number theory, general relativity, navigation, genetic engineering, statistics, fractals, thermodynamics, mechanics, and electromagnetism. Pi hides in the rainbow, and sits in the pupil of the eye, and when a raindrop falls into water π emerges in the spreading rings. Pi can be found in waves and ripples and spectra of all kinds and, therefore, π occurs in colors and music. The double helix of DNA revolves around π. Pi has lately turned up in super-strings, the hypothetical loops of energy vibrating inside subatomic particles. Pi has been used as a symbol for mathematical societies and mathematics in general, and built into calculators and programming languages. Pi is represented in the mosaic outside the mathematics building at the Technische Universität Berlin. Pi is also engraved on a mosaic at Delft University. Even a movie has been named after it. Pi is the secret code in Alfred Hitchcock’s ‘Torn Curtain’ and in ‘The Net’ starring <b>Sandra</b> Bullock. Pi <b>day</b> is celebrated on March 14 (which was chosen because it resembles 3.14). The official celebration begins at 1 : 59 p.m., to make an appropriate 3.14159 when combined with the date. In 2009, the United States House of Representatives supported the designation of Pi Day. Albert Einstein was born on Pi Day (14 March 1879).|$|R

5|$|This was {{the second}} time the Supreme Court had granted certiorari to the Oneida's land claim. Over a decade earlier, in Oneida Indian Nation of New York v. County of Oneida (1974), the Supreme Court had allowed the same suit to proceed by {{unanimously}} holding that there was federal subject-matter jurisdiction to hear the claim. Since then, Justices William O. Douglas and Potter Stewart had departed, replaced by John Paul Stevens and <b>Sandra</b> <b>Day</b> O'Connor.|$|E
5|$|In Waters v. Churchill (1994), the Court {{was faced}} with two differing {{accounts}} of the speech at issue. The question presented to the Court was whether the Connick test ought be applied to what the employer thought was said or what was actually said. The case revolved around a nurse dismissed for a conversation she had with a coworker. There was a discrepancy between what she argued was said and what her employer thought was said. Justice <b>Sandra</b> <b>Day</b> O'Connor, joined by a plurality of justices, opined that the Connick test must {{be applied to the}} speech the employer thought occurred, and on which it acted, rather than that which the finder of fact determines did occur.|$|E
5|$|During his 1980 campaign, Reagan pledged that, {{if given}} the {{opportunity}}, he would appoint the first female Supreme Court Justice. That opportunity came {{in his first year}} in office when he nominated <b>Sandra</b> <b>Day</b> O'Connor to fill the vacancy created by the retirement of Justice Potter Stewart. In his second term, Reagan elevated William Rehnquist to succeed Warren E. Burger as Chief Justice, and named Antonin Scalia to fill the vacant seat. Reagan nominated conservative jurist Robert Bork to the high court in 1987. Senator Ted Kennedy, a Democrat of Massachusetts, strongly condemned Bork, and great controversy ensued. Bork's nomination was rejected 58–42. Reagan then nominated Douglas Ginsburg, but Ginsburg withdrew his name from consideration after coming under fire for his cannabis use. Anthony Kennedy was eventually confirmed in his place. Along with his three Supreme Court appointments, Reagan appointed 83 judges to the United States courts of appeals, and 290 judges to the United States district courts.|$|E
5|$|Ruth Bader Ginsburg (born Joan Ruth Bader; March 15, 1933) is an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States. Ginsburg was {{appointed}} by President Bill Clinton and took {{the oath of office}} on August 10, 1993. She is the second female justice to be confirmed to the Court (after <b>Sandra</b> <b>Day</b> O'Connor), and one of four female justices to be confirmed (with Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, who are still serving). Following Justice O'Connor's retirement, and prior to Justice Sotomayor joining the Court, Ginsburg was the only female justice on the Supreme Court. During that time, Ginsburg became more forceful with her dissents, noted by legal observers and in popular culture. She is generally viewed as belonging to the liberal wing of the Court. Notable majority opinions Ginsburg has authored include United States v. Virginia, Olmstead v. L.C., and Friends of the Earth Inc. v. Laidlaw Environmental Services, Inc.|$|E
