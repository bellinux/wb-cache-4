40|$|BACKGROUND There is {{a popular}} belief in Chinese culture {{that the spirit of}} those who have died by suicide by hanging will haunt and torment the survivors, because they have died in rage and with {{feelings}} of hostility angry and oppressed women would use this method as an act of revenge. A tree is the most common suspension point in hanging occurring out of doors. But, bridge or climbing frames have also been used. In indoor causes, there is a large range of suspension points including doors, banisters, rafters and loft hatches or practicality any raised object.

Murray's lawyer advised patience until the toxicology results arrived, noting that [...] "things tend to shake out when all the facts are made known". [...] On February 8, 2010, Murray was charged with involuntary manslaughter by prosecutors in Los Angeles. Murray pleaded not guilty and was released after posting $75,000 (USD) bail.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{temperature}} and low particle volume concentration on the dynamic visosity of the Ah 03 /water and Ah 03 lEG/water-based nanofluids are investigated.

40|$|The town of Rio Grande has an {{industrial}} center composed of many fertilizer plants and a oil refinery. The monitoring of total particulate in suspension, by a governmental agency, has registered several events of {{high concentration of}} that pollutant over the last decade. Saraiva and Krusche (2001) have evaluated the meteorological time series, measured at Rio Grande meteostation, {{but they were not}} able to synthesize the atmospheric conditions which favor high concentrations of total particulate in <b>suspension.</b> Nevertheless, they <b>noticed</b> that they have a significant seasonal variation. We propose to use a larger dataset, obtained from NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis Project. The values of temperature, specific humidity, atmospheric pressure, and wind velocity, during periods of concentrations larger than 30 micrograms per cubic meter, in the years of 1990, 1994, and 1997, were selected in the area comprised from 20 degrees to 40 degrees S and from 40 degrees to 60 degrees W. For all 142 measurements, there are 52 high concentration events, 14 % observed in 1990, 29 % in 1994, and 57 % in 1997. 12 events happen in the summer, 18 in the autumn, 14 in the winter, and 8 in the spring. The events were grouped in seven classes, according to the similarity in the wind flow and surface pressure field. For each class, the average of all meteorological fields and of the sea surface temperature was determined. Class 1 is composed by 12 events, and 42 % of them happened in the autumn. It is characterized by a high pressure center to the east of Rio Grande, with a moderate breeze from northeast. In class 2, the high pressure center is over the town. There are 10 events in this class, 50 % of them happen in the winter. Class 3 has 7 components, 43 % of them happen in the spring, and they present the displacement of the high pressure center by the arrival of a cold frontal system, characterized by a convergence of by the establishment of a new high pressure center. There are 7 events in this class and 57 % of them happen in the autumn. Class 5, composed by 6 events, presents a high pressure center over the town, with southeast winds, and the number of events during summer, autumn, and winter is even. There are 3 summer events in class 7, which shows the establishment of a low pressure center. Sea surface temperature was low for classes 1, 2, and 4, which might enhance locally the high pressure effects, while class 3 is associated with higher sea surface temperature. Standard deviation of sea surface temperature indicates that the cold water is associated to discharges of La Plata river for class 1, and with the discharges of Patos Lagoon in class 2. The new dataset allowed us to build a classification of atmospheric conditions that favor high concentration of pollutants in the region of Rio Grande, along with a possible air-sea interaction with the local variations sea surface temperature.
