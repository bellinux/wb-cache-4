5|$|In November 1989, IBM {{scientists}} {{demonstrated a}} technology capable of manipulating individual atoms. The program, called IBM in atoms, used a <b>scanning</b> <b>tunneling</b> <b>microscope</b> to arrange 35 individual xenon atoms on a substrate of chilled crystal of nickel {{to spell out}} the three letter company initialism. It {{was the first time}} atoms had been precisely positioned on a flat surface.|$|E
5|$|The <b>scanning</b> <b>tunneling</b> <b>microscope</b> is {{a device}} for viewing {{surfaces}} at the atomic level. It uses the quantum tunneling phenomenon, which allows particles {{to pass through}} a barrier that would normally be insurmountable. Electrons tunnel through the vacuum between two planar metal electrodes, on {{each of which is}} an adsorbed atom, providing a tunneling-current density that can be measured. Scanning one atom (taken as the tip) as it moves past the other (the sample) permits plotting of tip displacement versus lateral separation for a constant current. The calculation shows the extent to which scanning-tunneling-microscope images of an individual atom are visible. It confirms that for low bias, the microscope images the space-averaged dimensions of the electron orbitals across closely packed energy levels—the Fermi level local density of states.|$|E

25|$|Atomic force <b>microscopes</b> and <b>scanning</b> <b>tunneling</b> <b>microscopes</b> employ {{converse}} piezoelectricity to {{keep the}} sensing needle close to the specimen.|$|R
50|$|The {{most common}} such {{materials}} are {{lead zirconate titanate}} and barium titanate. Aside from the uses mentioned above, their strong piezoelectric response is exploited {{in the design of}} high-frequency loudspeakers, transducers for sonar, and actuators for atomic force and <b>scanning</b> <b>tunneling</b> <b>microscopes.</b>|$|R
50|$|Nanosurf AG, {{headquartered}} in Liestal, Switzerland, is a manufacturer and supplier of nano-microscopes for industrial and academic research, {{as well as}} for educational purposes. Nanosurf’s atomic force <b>microscopes</b> (AFM) and <b>scanning</b> <b>tunneling</b> <b>microscopes</b> (STM) are used for metrological surface inspections and for the visualization of structures on the nanometer scale.|$|R
25|$|The <b>scanning</b> <b>tunneling</b> <b>microscope</b> {{can remove}} SAM {{molecules}} {{in many different}} ways. The first is to remove them mechanically by dragging the tip across the substrate surface. This {{is not the most}} desired technique as these tips are expensive and dragging them causes a lot of wear and reduction of the tip quality. The second way is to degrade or desorb the SAM molecules by shooting them with an electron beam. The <b>scanning</b> <b>tunneling</b> <b>microscope</b> can also remove SAMs by field desorption and field enhanced surface diffusion.|$|E
25|$|The {{operation}} of a <b>scanning</b> <b>tunneling</b> <b>microscope</b> (STM) relies on this tunneling effect. In that case, the barrier {{is due to the}} gap between the tip of the STM and the underlying object. Since the tunnel current depends exponentially on the barrier width, this device is extremely sensitive to height variations on the examined sample.|$|E
25|$|This is a sub-diffraction technique. Examples of {{scanning}} probe microscopes are the {{atomic force microscope}} (AFM), the <b>Scanning</b> <b>tunneling</b> <b>microscope,</b> the photonic force microscope and the recurrence tracking microscope. All such methods use the physical contact of a solid probe tip to scan the surface of an object, {{which is supposed to}} be almost flat.|$|E
50|$|A primitive, very non-biological form of {{mechanochemistry}} {{has been}} performed at cryogenic temperatures using <b>scanning</b> <b>tunneling</b> <b>microscopes.</b> So far, such devices provide the closest approach to fabrication tools for molecular engineering. Broader exploitation of mechanosynthesis awaits more advanced technology for constructing molecular machine systems, with ribosome-like systems as an attractive early objective.|$|R
40|$|It {{is known}} that the {{vibrational}} spectra of beetle-type <b>scanning</b> <b>tunneling</b> <b>microscopes</b> with a total mass of ≈ 3 – 4 g contain extrinsic ‘rattling’ modes in the frequency range extending from 500 to 1700 Hz that interfere with image acquisition. These modes lie below the lowest calculated eigenfrequency of the beetle {{and it has been}} suggested that they arise from the inertial sliding of the beetle between surface asperities on the raceway. In this paper we describe some cross-coupling measurements that were performed on three home-built beetle-type STMs of two different designs. We provide evidence that suggests that for beetles with total masses of 12 – 15 g all the modes in the rattling range are intrinsic. This provides additional support for the notion that the vibrational properties of beetle-type <b>scanning</b> <b>tunneling</b> <b>microscopes</b> can be improved by increasing the contact pressure between the feet of the beetle and the raceway...|$|R

Atomic Force Microscopy and <b>Scanning</b> <b>Tunneling</b> Microscopy are {{the most widely used}} from family of SPM, these techniques can be used in ambient conditions with simple sample preparation. AFM and STM are able to measure three-dimensional topography information from the atomic angstrom level to the micron scale with remarkable resolution.

25|$|In 2007, Iranian {{scientists}} at the Medical Sciences and Technology Center succeeded in mass-producing an advanced scanning microscope—the <b>Scanning</b> <b>Tunneling</b> <b>Microscope</b> (STM). By 2017, Iran ranked 8th in nanotechnologies. Iran has designed and mass-produced more than 35 kinds of advanced nanotechnology devices. These include laboratory equipment, antibacterial strings, power station filters and construction related equipment and materials.|$|E
25|$|An {{experiment}} {{indicating that}} positional molecular assembly is possible {{was performed by}} Ho and Lee at Cornell University in 1999. They used a <b>scanning</b> <b>tunneling</b> <b>microscope</b> to move an individual carbon monoxide molecule (CO) to an individual iron atom (Fe) sitting on a flat silver crystal, and chemically bound the CO to the Fe by applying a voltage.|$|E
25|$|First, the {{invention}} of the <b>scanning</b> <b>tunneling</b> <b>microscope</b> in 1981 which provided unprecedented visualization of individual atoms and bonds, and was successfully used to manipulate individual atoms in 1989. The microscope's developers Gerd Binnig and Heinrich Rohrer at IBM Zurich Research Laboratory received a Nobel Prize in Physics in 1986. Binnig, Quate and Gerber also invented the analogous atomic force microscope that year.|$|E

40|$|A {{piezoelectric}} tube of {{the type}} typically used for actuation in <b>Scanning</b> <b>Tunneling</b> <b>Microscopes</b> (STMs) and Atomic Force Microscopes (AFMs) is considered. Actuation of this piezoelectric tube is hampered {{by the presence of}} a lightly damped low frequency resonant mode. This resonant mode is first identified and then damped using a Positive Velocity and Position Feedback (PVPF) controller, a control technique which is proposed in this paper. Inputs are then shaped such that the closed loop system tracks a raster pattern. Keywords...|$|R
25|$|In a nanorecording application, {{a certain}} rotaxane is {{deposited}} as a Langmuir-Blodgett film on ITO-coated glass. When a positive voltage is applied {{with the tip}} of a <b>scanning</b> <b>tunneling</b> <b>microscope</b> probe, the rotaxane rings in the tip area switch to {{a different part of the}} dumbbell and the resulting new conformation makes the molecules stick out 0.3 nanometer from the surface. This height difference is sufficient for a memory dot. It is not yet known how to erase such a nanorecording film.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} {{important}} modern developments. The {{atomic force microscope}} (AFM) and the <b>Scanning</b> <b>Tunneling</b> <b>Microscope</b> (STM) are two early versions of scanning probes that launched nanotechnology. There are other types of scanning probe microscopy. Although conceptually similar to the scanning confocal microscope developed by Marvin Minsky in 1961 and the scanning acoustic microscope (SAM) developed by Calvin Quate and coworkers in the 1970s, newer scanning probe microscopes have much higher resolution, since they are not limited by the wavelength of sound or light.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} {{different}} ways of fabricating a QPC. It can be realized in a break-junction by pulling apart a piece of conductor until it breaks. The breaking point forms the point contact. In a more controlled way, quantum point contacts are formed in a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG), e.g. in GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructures. By applying a voltage to suitably shaped gate electrodes, the electron gas can be locally depleted and {{many different types of}} conducting regions can be created in the plane of the 2DEG, among them quantum dots and quantum point contacts. Another means of creating a QPC is by positioning the tip of a <b>scanning</b> <b>tunneling</b> <b>microscope</b> close to the surface of a conductor.|$|E
40|$|<b>Scanning</b> <b>tunneling</b> <b>microscopes</b> (STM) {{are used}} {{extensively}} for studying and manipulating matter at the atomic scale. In {{spite of the}} critical role of the STM tip, procedures for controlling the atomic-scale shape of STM tips have not been rigorously justified. Here, we present a method for preparing tips in situ while ensuring the crystalline structure and a reproducibly prepared tip structure {{up to the second}} atomic layer. We demonstrate a controlled evolution of such tips starting from undefined tip shapes...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{the concept of}} atomically precise manufacturing and aims to examine some likely aspects of the necessary infrastructure and knowledge that will be required from a theoretical standpoint. By way of introduction, I trace the history of Science Fiction’s influence on scientific research and examine some examples that have specifically inspired the thinking behind nanoscience and nanotechnology. More serious speculation, both in favour of and arguing against the possibility of bottom-up manufacturing is also discussed. I look at two schools of thought; directed assembly, typified by the ambition to assemble molecular structures piece by piece and self assembly, where networks of molecules form into arrays on substrates, imparting novel properties. Various methodologies and tools available to the nanotechnologist are examined. Density functional theory, as employed in the AIMpro code, and Molecular Mechanics are discussed, particularly in respect of their strengths and weaknesses for use in simulating the kind of nanoscale processes appropriate to nanomanufacturing. The theoretical basis behind <b>scanning</b> <b>tunneling</b> <b>microscopes</b> is also examined, with particular attention paid to their potential for upscaling in the future. Some components found within <b>scanning</b> <b>tunneling</b> <b>microscopes</b> are simulated using Density Functional Theory. Models of pure tungsten tips are studied at various levels of complexity in order to decide upon a reasonable compromise between accuracy and ease of computation. The nature of the interlayer interaction in few layer graphenes is examined and pristine and defected graphitic surfaces, are studied with a view towards their use as nano-workbenches. Their images as produced in <b>scanning</b> <b>tunneling</b> <b>microscopes</b> are simulated. Density Functional Theory is applied to organic molecules self-assembling on metallic substrates. Specifically, tetracene on a clean copper surface and on an oxygen-terminated copper surface is studied. Finally, I discuss {{the significance of the}} results of each section, taken individually and as a whole, and try to put it into perspective regarding the practicality of actually employing this paradigm realistically in the near future...|$|R

500|$|Two main {{types of}} {{electron}} microscopes exist: transmission and scanning. Transmission electron microscopes function like overhead projectors, with {{a beam of}} electrons passing through a slice of material then being projected by lenses on a photographic slide or a charge-coupled device. [...] Scanning electron microscopes rasteri a finely focused electron beam, as in a TV set, across the studied sample to produce the image. Magnifications range from 100× to 1,000,000× or higher for both microscope types. The <b>scanning</b> <b>tunneling</b> <b>microscope</b> uses quantum tunneling of electrons from a sharp metal tip into the studied material and can produce atomically resolved images of its surface.|$|E
500|$|Atomic {{dimensions}} {{are thousands of}} times smaller than the wavelengths of light (400–700nm) so they cannot be viewed using an optical microscope. However, individual atoms can be observed using a <b>scanning</b> <b>tunneling</b> <b>microscope.</b> To visualize the minuteness of the atom, consider that a typical human hair is about 1million carbon atoms in width. A single drop of water contains about 2sextillion (...) atoms of oxygen, and {{twice the number of}} hydrogen atoms. A single carat diamond with a mass of [...] contains about 10sextillion (1022) atoms of carbon.

40|$|The evanescently coupled photon <b>scanning</b> <b>tunneling</b> <b>microscopes</b> (STMs) {{have special}} {{requirements}} {{in terms of}} stability and optical access. We have made substantial improvements to the stability, resolution, and noise floor of our custom-built visible-photon STM, and will translate these advances to our infrared instrument. Double vibration isolation of the STM base with a damping system achieved increased rigidity, giving high tunneling junction stability for long-duration and high-power illumination.

40|$|Two beetle-type <b>scanning</b> <b>tunneling</b> <b>microscopes</b> are described. Both designs {{have the}} thermal {{stability}} of the Besocke beetle and {{the simplicity of the}} Wilms beetle. Moreover, sample holders were designed that also allow both semiconductor wafers and metal single crystals to be studied. The coarse approach is a linear motion of the beetle towards the sample using inertial slip–stick motion. Ten wires are required to control the position of the beetle and scanner and measure the tunneling current. The two beetles were built with different sized piezolegs, and the vibrational properties of both beetles were studied in detail. It was found, in agreement with previous work, that the beetle bending mode is the lowest principal eigenmode. However, in contrast to previous vibrational studies of beetle-type <b>scanning</b> <b>tunneling</b> <b>microscopes,</b> we found that the beetles did not have the “rattling” modes that are thought to arise from the beetle sliding or rocking between surface asperities on the raceway. The mass of our beetles is 3 – 4 times larger than the mass of beetles where rattling modes have been observed. We conjecture that the mass of our beetles is above a “critical beetle mass. ” This is defined to be the beetle mass that attenuates the rattling modes by elastically deforming the contact region {{to the extent that the}} rattling modes cannot be identified as distinct modes in cross-coupling measurements...|$|R

Storrs Hall, and Ralph Merkle. [...] The authors first discussed the [...] "fat fingers" [...] argument by attacking Smalley's {{notion that a}} chemical reaction must involve five to fifteen atoms, stating that many reactions involve only two reactants, one {{of which can be}} immobilized and the other attached to a single [...] "finger". They cited as evidence experimental and theoretical results indicating that using <b>scanning</b> <b>tunneling</b> <b>microscope</b> (STM) tips and related technologies {{could be used as a}} reactive structure for positional control and for interaction with surface-bound molecules. They also noted that atomically precise final products do not require precise control of all aspects of the chemical reaction. The authors noted that the [...] "sticky fingers" [...] problem is valid in some reactions, but argue that it would be fallacious to conclude that all reactions have this problem.|$|E
