500|$|With the {{creation}} of the Phoenix Sister Cities (PSC) organization in 1972, Phoenix {{became a member of the}} international <b>Sister</b> <b>City</b> <b>movement.</b> It would take the organization several years to become official, not filing for Articles of Incorporation until 1975, and not entering into their first Sister City agreement until 1976, with Hermosillo, Mexico. The organization's mission statement states their purpose is to [...] "create people-to-people relationships between the residents of Phoenix and its sister cities through commercial, educational, cultural and artistic exchange programs and events that create and sustain global, long-term, international partnerships and business opportunities for the citizens of Phoenix." [...] Phoenix has ten sister cities, as designated by the Phoenix Sister Cities Commission and Sister Cities International, shown in the table below. Phoenix and Prague have shared a Capital Cities relationship since May 1991, which was expanded to Sister City Status in 2013.|$|E
50|$|The sister city idea {{developed}} from the Civic Committee. Envisioned by President Eisenhower as the 'main cog' for citizen diplomacy, the sister city program grew throughout the 1950s and 1960s. The Civic Committee and the National League of Cities provided joint administrative support for the fledgling <b>sister</b> <b>city</b> <b>movement</b> until 1973.|$|E
50|$|Programs at {{that time}} focused on basic urban {{problems}} such as water and sanitation, health, housing, education and transportation. Begun in 1977, the national Technical Assistance Program (TAP) worked to create training programs to increase employment, establish cooperatives and credit unions or to create appropriate small-scale industries. Development agencies realized that industrializing countries experienced the same urban problems as developed nations. The <b>sister</b> <b>city</b> <b>movement</b> provided a mechanism for communities to share their experiences and growing pains. TAP focused on a spiral out benefits system. For example, a city project to improve surface drainage would indirectly aid the urban poor. These citizens would gain better sanitation and possible employment from the project. The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) provided seed grant money for the project.|$|E

Toilet Twinners receive a certificate, containing a photo of the twinned latrine, its location and GPS coordinates.|$|R

40|$|Sister City relationships, {{originally}} {{built on}} cultural understanding and peace through citizen diplomacy, are evolving in today’s society. Politicians increasingly demand real returns where local government is actively involved. Meaningful sister city links are an asset for any community and its nation. However full utilisation requires skills and commitment talked about but often lacking in delivery. Increased emphasis on economic development as primary motivator for having sister cities provides opportunities, but also presents risks as policy emphasis shifts from relationship-building to pragmatic, shorter term goals. New Zealand’s portfolio of sister cities reflect its {{place on the}} Pacific Rim and its political/ economic positioning as “part of Asia”. An upsurge in interest from and in China as the place to do business has coincided with a levelling off of sister city activities {{when they should be}} increasing. The reasons are varied, but demonstrate the challenges New Zealand faces in continuing as a front-runner in the <b>sister</b> <b>city</b> <b>movement.</b> Sister city policies require honest assessment. Limited resources demand better investment where opportunities are identified or disassociation where they are not. Success requires robust policy development, professionalism and an effective public relations campaign informing communities concerned of the possibilities their international links can present. </p...|$|E
