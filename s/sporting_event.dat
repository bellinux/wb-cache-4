40|$|M. Tech. Sport {{has become}} the {{broadest}} common cultural denominator in almost all societies (Lapchick, cited in Gouws, 1997). As a result, <b>sporting</b> <b>events</b> have become an increasingly popular means for achieving political, cultural and economic benefits for the host nation (Parent, 2008). Consequently, {{this has led to}} an increased demand in the value of diverse skills in the <b>sport</b> <b>event</b> management field. This is to cope with the increased complexities surrounding <b>sport</b> <b>event</b> management and thus requires a distinct body of knowledge and skills to be developed (Quatman, 2008). However, concern over the lack of a relevant base of common knowledge (NASPE-NASSM, 1993) as well as pertinent training programmes to prepare sport managers for the contemporary <b>sport</b> <b>events</b> industry has resulted in current graduates not necessarily meeting the needs or expectations of the industry. As a result, {{there appears to be a}} gap between the current event management curricula outcomes at higher education institutions (HEIs) in South Africa and the expected competencies of <b>sport</b> <b>event</b> managers in practice. The aim is therefore to develop guidelines for <b>sport</b> <b>event</b> management training in higher education institutions on various HEQF levels (DoL, 2008) to address the competencies required by managers for the South African context. This translates into objectives, namely: i) to identify, conceptualise and unpack <b>sport</b> <b>event</b> management competencies required by <b>sport</b> <b>event</b> managers, ii) to investigate the curricula of <b>sport</b> <b>event</b> management at higher education institutions in South Africa, iii) to investigate the importance of different competencies required by <b>sport</b> <b>event</b> managers in South Africa, iv) to investigate the current level of competencies of practitioners regarding <b>sport</b> <b>event</b> management in South Africa, v) to provide a background on the current education system in South Africa and vi) provide guidelines for <b>sport</b> <b>event</b> management training in higher education institutions at various HEQF levels (DoL, 2008) to address the competencies required by managers for the South African context. The research design is descriptive in nature, with quantitative methods in the form of questionnaires utilised to collect the data.

40|$|Abstract: Although <b>sports</b> <b>events</b> are {{considered}} a new field for urban and economic development, besides certain advantages that are obtained by hosting <b>sports</b> <b>events,</b> there are also many dangers. Upon considering the effects of <b>sports</b> <b>events,</b> studies on low-accuracy <b>sports</b> <b>events</b> are heavily relied on. These analyses often exaggerate advantages, underestimate costs and make an improper use of statistics. It appears that there positive effects and especially, financial advantages of <b>sports</b> <b>events</b> have often been exaggerated so that financial profits are often estimated too high, and costs are understated. By considering existing evidences and literature, this study aims to find an answer for this question: How much true are the topics propounded as to {{the positive effects of}} <b>sports</b> <b>events...</b>|$|R

40|$|Existing {{literature}} {{suggests that there is}} a relationship between the image of a destination and its <b>sport</b> <b>events</b> and that their common image associations lead to an image fit. This study aims to empirically explore the destination image, <b>sport</b> <b>event</b> image and the image fit, dividing them in cognitive and affective components, among spectators of <b>sport</b> <b>events.</b> Also, the interrelationships between these images are studied to fully grasp the dynamic relationship between event image and destination image. For this purpose, a survey was conducted among spectators (n= 140) of three running events held in three different cities in the Netherlands. The findings indicate that there is a moderate strong interrelationship between the images of a destination and its <b>sport</b> <b>event,</b> which leads to a positive cognitive and affective image fit. Policymakers should, therefore, focus on organizing <b>sport</b> <b>events</b> that match the positive characteristics of the destination in order to create more positive <b>sport</b> <b>event</b> images, as destination images and <b>sport</b> <b>event</b> images are not formed separately from each other...|$|R

40|$|Outside the {{high-profile}} mega types, the ubiquity {{and breadth of}} <b>sports</b> <b>events</b> can paradoxically make them less obvious choices for research. In addition, the overwhelming studies in <b>sports</b> <b>events</b> tend to involve economic impact analyses and consequently miss the many issues and additional impacts that such events engender. In reviewing the literature related {{to the study of}} <b>sport</b> <b>events</b> it become apparent {{that there has been a}} notable lack of critical commentary exploring the problems associated with applying traditional <b>event</b> categories to <b>sport</b> <b>events.</b> Moreover there is a deficiency of information concerning particular event types such as those associated with smaller events, along with those connected to parades and festivals. Therefore the aims of this chapter are twofold: first to introduce and evaluate current <b>sport</b> <b>event</b> typologies, and second to present an argument for <b>sports</b> <b>events</b> to be treated separately because of their complexity and nature. It will be contended that are two elements of distinction – a taxonomical distinction related to the specific criteria adopted for <b>sport</b> <b>events,</b> as well as an innate distinctiveness that aims to illustrate the special nature of <b>sport</b> <b>events.</b> For the sake of simplicity and clarity these two themes will be explored separately though it is acknowledged there will be some obvious overlaps...|$|R
