25|$|Two Audience Matches {{were played}} on Match Game PM, for a {{possible}} total of $10,000, or $20,000 after the <b>Star</b> <b>Wheel</b> was introduced.|$|E
25|$|The {{rules and}} {{gameplay}} {{were the same}} as before, including the <b>Star</b> <b>Wheel</b> Bonus, but the format was altered slightly. Each contestant on this version of Match Game played a two-game match against another contestant, and the Super Match was played after each game. As on Match Game PM, a contestant did not win any money for winning the game. There were also no returning champions on the daily syndicated series, as two new contestants began each match. The <b>Star</b> <b>Wheel</b> reduced the golden star sections to three, making it more difficult to double the winnings in the Head-to-Head match.|$|E
25|$|Once the contestant's Audience Match {{winnings}} {{were determined}} they then faced the <b>Star</b> <b>Wheel</b> {{to determine the}} stake for the Head-to-Head Match, with a maximum amount of $10,000 available. The <b>Star</b> <b>Wheel</b> was slightly modified for this Match Game series, as the contestant did not spin the actual wheel {{and there were no}} stars under the celebrities' names. Instead the wheel was fixed in place and the contestant spun a green arrow attached to its rim {{in order to determine the}} celebrity. Each celebrity had two red dots placed under their name and the stake was doubled if the wheel landed on one of them.|$|E

25|$|Match Game PM's Super-Match {{used two}} Audience Matches, {{with the answer}} values {{combined}} and multiplied by ten for the Head-To-Head Match, with a maximum of $10,000 available. When the <b>Star</b> <b>Wheel</b> was introduced, that potential payout grew to $20,000 if a contestant spun a double.|$|E
25|$|The {{introduction}} of the <b>Star</b> <b>Wheel</b> also brought about {{a change in the}} bonus payout structure. Each section included several gold stars, which doubled the stakes if the wheel stopped on one of them. The maximum prize was thus $10,000 on the daytime series, and $20,000 on Match Game PM.|$|E
25|$|The {{subsequent}} 1990–91 {{version of}} the show used a redesigned {{version of the}} <b>Star</b> <b>Wheel.</b> The wheel itself was stationary, and the contestant spun the pointer on a concentric ring to determine which celebrity he/she had to match. The prize was doubled if the pointer stopped on either of two circles within each section.|$|E

5000|$|The [...] "Deluxe" [...] model {{appeared}} in 1979. This bike looked {{nearly identical to}} the original CX500 Standard, with the exception of regular (85 mph) gauges and headlight (the mini fairing was removed) and black reversed Com <b>Star</b> <b>wheels</b> - 19 inch front and 16 inch rear. 1981 was the final year for the CX500 Deluxe model.|$|R

25|$|When the <b>Star</b> <b>Wheel</b> {{was first}} introduced, each section {{contained}} five {{stars in a}} continuous white border, and the prize was doubled if the wheel stopped with its pointer anywhere in that area. Beginning with the premiere of the 1979 syndicated version, the wheel was re-designed so that each section had three stars in separate, evenly spaced squares; the pointer now {{had to be on}} a square in order to double the money.|$|E
2500|$|Unlike any {{previous}} version, the Audience Match {{portion of the}} [...] "Super Match" [...] is not played for a payoff, but simply to determine {{the value of the}} Head-to-Head Match. The potential payoffs are $2,000–$1,500–$1,000 ($2,500–$2,000–$1,500 starting in season 2), or $500 ($1,000 starting in season 2) for an unsuccessful match. If the champion manages a lucky <b>Star</b> <b>Wheel</b> spin, as in earlier versions, the value is doubled for a payoff of up to $4,000 ($5,000 starting in season 2).|$|E
2500|$|A {{contestant}} who won {{money in}} the Audience Match then {{had the opportunity to}} win ten times that amount (therefore, $5,000, $2,500, or $1,000) by exactly matching another fill-in-the-blank response with one celebrity panelist. Originally, the contestant chose the celebrity; later, the celebrity who played this match was determined by the <b>Star</b> <b>Wheel.</b> In the very start of the 1970s series, Rayburn read the question before the celebrity was chosen, but this was changed after the first two shows. The format of these matches was much shorter and non-humorous, typically requiring the contestant and celebrity to choose from a number of similar familiar phrases, for example, [...] "Baseball _____" [...] (baseball game, baseball diamond, etc.). The contestant was instructed that their response must be an exact match, although singular/plural matches were usually accepted, whereas synonyms were not.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the design of}} a mechanism with the following specifications: continuous alternate motion, wide motion phases with constant angular velocity, parallel input and output shafts, and great strokes. Those specifications derive from a possible application in the textile field. The mechanism is composed of two <b>star</b> <b>wheels</b> properly coupled together: there are two counter-rotating input wheels, alternately coupling with slots first, then teeth at each side of the output wheel. As usual for <b>star</b> <b>wheels,</b> pins and slots handle the acceleration and deceleration phases, while the constant velocity phase is performed by coupling sectors of toothed gears. A proper design of pins and slots is performed, so {{that at the same time}} when a pin from one input wheel is releasing a slot, a pin from the other input wheel engages a slot on the other side of the output wheel, forcing the latter to an opposite motion. In this way the output wheel has a continuous and smooth alternate motion. By annihilating the arrest phases typical of <b>star</b> <b>wheels,</b> the proposed system eliminates the discontinuities in the acceleration diagram. The paper develops a complete parametrical analysis of the device, underlining the effect of the constraints on the shape of the motion laws with particular emphasis on the acceleration and deceleration phases. In this way the output wheel has a continuous and smooth alternate motion. With respect to an analogous mechanism realizing the same laws of motion, e. g., cams, this device is very compact and economical, also presenting parallel input and output shafts, and significantly reduces sliding and wea...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe Shields-Harary number (SH) is a graph {{parameter}} {{which has}} been interpreted in terms of network vulnerability. There is no known algorithm for calculating SH. In this paper, we study the Shields-Harary number for wheel graphs and wheel graphs with deleted outer edges. Wheels with sufficiently many outer edges deleted have the same value of SH as the <b>star.</b> <b>Wheels</b> and wheels with too few edges deleted have a different (but very close) value of SH, which is not precisely known. We show that infinitely many of these graphs have non-integral values of SH. Formerly, only one such graph was known...|$|R

50|$|The {{idea was}} taken up by John Lombe who, with his brother Thomas, engaged Sorocold to build a new, larger mill, based on the Italian pattern, {{on the site of}} the old one, {{completed}} in 1722.

The machinery when finished contained 10,000 spindles, with 25,000 spinning reel bobbins, nearly 5000 <b>star</b> <b>wheels,</b> over 9000 twist bobbins and 46,000 winding bobbins, all to be driven by a single water wheel.
