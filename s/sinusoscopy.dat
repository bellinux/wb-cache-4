25|$|Nasal {{endoscopy}} {{and clinical}} symptoms {{are also used}} to make a positive diagnosis. A tissue sample for histology and cultures can also be collected and tested. Allergic fungal sinusitis (AFS) is often seen in people with asthma and nasal polyps. In rare cases, <b>sinusoscopy</b> may be made.|$|E
30|$|According to the Brazilian Guidelines for Sinusitis [20], the {{clinical}} exam has {{sensitivity and specificity}} of 69 and 79  %, respectively, which makes the use of complementary diagnostic tools necessary. A number of authors report the use of computed tomography for the diagnosis of sinusitis. Nakai et al. [31] performed this exam 6  months following the placement of 15 zygomatic implants in nine patients and found an absence of {{signs and symptoms of}} sinusitis. Maló et al. [24] evaluated the association between zygomatic implants and maxillary sinusitis using <b>sinusoscopy</b> on 14 patients and found no cases of infection or inflammation of the mucosa surrounding the implants, demonstrating that titanium implants are compatible with the health and normal function of the maxillary sinus. However, the studies cited employed the original technique.|$|E
40|$|The {{experiences}} in treating sinusitis in 30 {{children and young}} men arepresented. The patients' age was within the range from 7 to 18. There were 16 boysand 14 girls. Ali the patients were examined in the clinic approach, that is, by the frontrhinoscopiy; the laboratory analyses were done {{as well as the}} biogram and the antibiogramof the nose beside x-raying of the paranasal cavities in the oxyphytomentalposition and <b>sinusoscopy.</b> The ophtalmological and the pediatrie examinations werealso carried out. Nine patients underwent the maxillary sinus trephination accordingto Caldwell-Luc; two patients underwent external ethmoidectomy while one patientunderwent the frontal sinus trephination according to Ruttemburg as well asendonasal back ethmoidectomy. The conservative treatment was given to 18 patients. A surgical intervention was done on 12 patients. Ali the patients were successfullytreated...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Sinus fungus ball (FB) is a {{non-invasive}} mycosis {{that affects}} immunocompetent hosts, most frequently localized in the maxillary sinus. The current golden standard treatment is surgical removal. OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate the effectiveness}} of an endonasal endoscopically assisted approach to remove a maxillary FB combined or not with a transoral approach (<b>sinusoscopy</b> via canine fossa). METHODS: A retrospective evaluation of paranasal FB treated by functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) + transoral approach, compared to those treated by a sole FESS procedure. RESULTS: In total, 65 out of 90 patients presented with a maxillary localization and were treated by FESS. Thirthy-three patients received a combined FESS + transoral approach and 32 received solely a FESS procedure. Antimycotic medical therapy was not used in any case. With a mean follow-up of 93 months, the treatment was successful in 62 patients (95, 4...|$|E
40|$|Three hundred sixty-seven {{successive}} patients {{suffering from}} chronic maxillary sinusitis (CMS) were thoroughly examined {{by means of}} maxillary <b>sinusoscopy,</b> a CT scan of the facial sinuses, and sinusomanometry (SMM). Ninety-eight cases of unilateral CMS, 269 cases of bilateral CMS, and 444 chronic ethmoidal sinusitis (CES) cases were evaluated. According to SMM, the maxillary ostia {{were divided into two}} groups: 1. maxillary ostium patency (MOP) group and 2. the maxillary ostium nonpatency (MONP) group. The unilateral and bilateral pathologies were separately analyzed so as to minimize the effects of general or systemic causes on the results. MONP is, in both bilateral and unilateral groups, significantly linked with the presence of ethmoidal sinusitis (P < 10 (- 6); P =. 026), while the correlation between MOP and the ethmoid status {{does not appear to be}} significant in either group. Thus, there seems to be a close relationship between CES and maxillary ostial dyspermeability in cases of CMS...|$|E
40|$|We {{report on}} 498 {{patients}} suffering from chronic maxillary sinusitis verified by <b>sinusoscopy</b> through the inferior meatus and by computed tomography of the sinuses, which permitted also {{the diagnosis of}} coexisting chronic ethmoidal sinusitis. The patients were treated by temporary drainage through a polyethylene drain tube left {{in place at the}} end of the antroscopy for daily lavage with saline solution and daily instillation in the sinus of thiamphenicol glycinate hydrochloride (similar to chloramphenicol) and N-acetyl-L-cysteine. We followed up 847 maxillary sinuses during the lavages according to 2 parameters: 1) recovery of a clean washout product at the macroscopic examination and 2) recovery of normal ostial patency as measured by sinusomanometry. We concluded that 1) the association with ethmoidal sinusitis does not significantly modify the treatment duration, and 2) fewer than 4 % of the maxillary sinuses are likely to recover normal parameters after the 23 rd day of lavage, and it is therefore useless to continue this treatment much longer. Of the maxillary sinuses, 36. 25 % were not submitted to any surgery. The results gained by the lavage technique have to be protected from recurrence by the treatment of general, focal, or local causes...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{evaluate}} morphological changes of maxillary sinus mucosa and to compare them with the levels of tryptase, myeloperoxidase (MPO) and eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) in sinus lavage, and also with subjective outcomes in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis after endosinusal treatment. Thirty patients with the symptoms of chronic rhinosinusitis were recruited for the study. Inclusion criteria were sinusitis symptoms persisting for more than 3 months and maxillary sinus mucosa thickening by > 6 mm, considered as maxillary sinusitis. Patients with asthma, polyposis, recent infection, systemic steroid therapy or previous sinus surgery were excluded. Patients were treated endosinusally with 2 mg dexamethasone and 40 mg gentamicin per maxillary sinus daily for 5 days. Patients rated their nasal/ chronic rhinosinusitis disease-specific symptoms and completed a self-administered questionnaire concerning sinusitis symptoms at inclusion and after 30 days. Sinus lavage with 5 ccm of saline was obtained prior to the first endosinusal treatment. Tryptase, MPO and ECP were determined from lavage fluid. Biopsy specimens of maxillary sinus mucosa were obtained by biopsy forceps during <b>sinusoscopy</b> through the inferior meatus in local anesthesia. Fifteen (50 %) patients showed improvement and symptom alleviation after the treatment (responders), and 15 (50 %) were unchanged or worsened (IR 0. 05) between the responders and nonresponders. Responders had a higher level of MPO and ECP in sinus lavage and higher number of mononuclears and eosinophils in biopsy specimens of maxillary sinus mucosa than nonresponders. There was no statistical difference in tryptase and other histologic parameters (number of mononuclears, edema, fibrosis, seromucous glands and goblet cell density) between responders or nonresponders. Eosinophilia in maxillary sinus mucosa specimens showed close correlation with ECP level in sinus lavage and inverse correlation with fibrosis (p< 0. 05). Other inflammatory cells (mononuclears and neutrophils) in maxillary sinus mucosa specimens did not correlate with the level of any cytokine in sinus lavage or with other histologic parameters. Globlet cell density correlated with ECP level (p< 0. 05) and inversely with MPO level in sinus lavage (p< 0. 01). Fibrosis showed close correlation with tryptase (p< 0. 01) and MPO (p< 0. 05) levels in sinus lavage and inversely with edema (p< 0. 01). Study results indicated higher levels of MPO and ECP in sinus lavage and higher number of mononuclears and eosinophils in biopsy specimens of maxillary sinus mucosa to predict better response to endosinusal steroid/ antibiotic treatment...|$|E
