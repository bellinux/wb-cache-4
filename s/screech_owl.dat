5|$|The {{wide range}} of {{habitats}} in the park supports a diverse population of birds including some, such as the vermilion flycatcher and the whiskered <b>screech</b> <b>owl,</b> uncommon elsewhere in the United States. Among the park's 107 bird species are great horned owls, cactus wrens, ravens, kestrels, turkey vultures, roadrunners, woodpeckers, hawks, quails, and hummingbirds, and one threatened species, the Mexican spotted owl.|$|E
5|$|Besides its prairie restorations {{and bodies}} of water, Silver Springs has areas of {{deciduous}} forests, and wetlands, {{both of which}} are populated with species of mammals, birds and insects. Bird life observed in the park includes: osprey, great horned owl, eastern <b>screech</b> <b>owl</b> and long-eared owl; bald eagle have been sighted further upstream along the Fox. Reptiles and amphibians are present in the park but are more elusive than other types of animal life.|$|E
5|$|Adult mockingbirds {{can fall}} victim to birds of prey such as the great horned owl, <b>screech</b> <b>owl</b> and sharp-shinned hawk, though their {{tenacious}} behavior makes them less likely to being captured. Scrub-jays also have killed and eaten mockingbirds. Snakes rarely capture incubating females. Fledgelings have been prey to domestic cats, red-tailed hawks, and crows. Eggs and nestlings are consumed by blue jays, fish crows and American crows, red-tailed hawks, swallow-tailed kites, snakes, squirrels, and cats. Blowfly larvae and Haemoproteus {{have been found in}} Florida and Arizona populations, respectively.|$|E

5|$|Pettigrew State Park is home {{to several}} species of birds of prey. Ospreys build their nests in {{the tops of the}} tallest trees in the park and feed on the {{abundant}} fish of Lake Phelps. The population of bald eagles is increasing and they are occasionally seen over the park. At least three species of owl, the great horned owl, barred owl and eastern <b>screech</b> <b>owl,</b> make their home in the forests of the park, as do red tailed and red shouldered hawks. American kestrel and northern harriers also find suitable habitats at Pettigrew State Park.|$|E

25|$|<b>Screech</b> <b>owls</b> are {{primarily}} solitary. During the late winter breeding season, however, males make nests in cavities, sometimes reusing abandoned nests of other animals, {{to try to}} attract females. The females select their mate based {{on the quality of}} the cavity and the food located inside. During the incubation period, the male feeds the female. These birds are monogamous, with biparental care. The young of most <b>screech</b> <b>owls</b> are altricial to semi altricial.|$|R

25|$|Similar {{to other}} owls, the <b>screech</b> <b>owl</b> females {{are larger than}} the males of their species. They have a compact size and shape. The screech owls are small and agile. They are about 7 to 10 inches tall and have a {{wingspan}} of about 18 to 24 inches. They have prominent, wide-set feather tufts with bright yellow/green eyes. They have different brownish hues with whitish, patterned underside. This coloration helps them get camouflage against the tree bark. They have well-developed raptorial claws and curved bill. They use them {{as a tool to}} tear their prey into pieces that are small enough for them to swallow. They tend to carry their prey to the nest and then eat it.|$|E
25|$|The Salmon Falls Creek {{watershed}} {{varies widely}} {{in terms of}} different habitats. Along the lower section of the creek, plentiful water flow and numerous springs create a rich riparian environment compared to an oasis, lined with coyote willow, dogwood, golden currant, cattail, mint and poison ivy. The upper section is a slow-moving waterway that supports a small wetland and extensive meadows. In contrast, {{the vast majority of}} the upper undeveloped watershed is a shrub-steppe sagebrush grassland, much of which is used for grazing. Many bird species use the Salmon Falls Creek canyon, including white-throated swift, canyon and rock wrens, cliff swallow, violet-green swallow, barn swallow, <b>screech</b> <b>owl,</b> long-eared owl, great horned owl, kestrel, red-tailed hawk, golden eagles and prairie falcon. Mule deer also inhabit areas of the middle and upper Salmon Falls Creek basin.|$|E
500|$|The {{barn owl}} {{was one of}} several species of bird first {{described}} in 1769 by the Tyrolean physician and naturalist Giovanni Antonio Scopoli in his [...] Anni Historico-Naturales. He gave it the scientific name Strix alba. [...] As more species of owl were described, the genus name Strix came to be used solely for the wood owls in the typical owl family Strigidae, and the barn owl became Tyto alba in the barn owl family Tytonidae. The name literally means [...] "white owl", from the onomatopoeic Ancient Greek tyto (τυτώ) for an owl – compare English [...] "hooter" [...] – and Latin alba, [...] "white". The bird is known by many common names which refer to its appearance, call, habitat, or its eerie, silent flight: white owl, silver owl, demon owl, ghost owl, death owl, night owl, rat owl, church owl, cave owl, stone owl, monkey-faced owl, hissing owl, hobgoblin or hobby owl, dobby owl, white-breasted owl, golden owl, scritch owl, <b>screech</b> <b>owl,</b> straw owl, barnyard owl, and delicate owl. [...] "Golden owl" [...] might also refer to the related golden masked owl (T. aurantia). [...] "Hissing owl" [...] and, particularly in the UK and in India, [...] "screech owl", refers to the piercing calls of these birds. The latter name is also applied to a different group of birds, the screech-owls in the genus Megascops.|$|E

50|$|Eastern <b>screech</b> <b>owls</b> inhabit open mixed woodlands, {{deciduous}} forests, parklands, wooded suburban areas, riparian woods along {{streams and}} wetlands (especially in drier areas), mature orchards, and woodlands near marshes, meadows, and fields. They {{try to avoid}} areas known to have regular activity of larger owls, especially great horned owls (Bubo virginianus). Their ability to live in heavily developed areas outranks even the great horned and certainly the barred <b>owl</b> (Strix varia); <b>screech</b> <b>owls</b> also are considerably more successful {{in the face of}} urbanization than barn owls (Tyto alba) following the conversion of what was once farmland. Due to the introduction of open woodland and cultivated strips in the Great Plains, the range of eastern <b>screech</b> <b>owls</b> there has expanded. Eastern <b>screech</b> <b>owls</b> have been reported living and nesting in spots such as along the border of a busy highway and {{on the top of a}} street light in the middle of a busy town square. They often nest in trees in neighborhoods and urban yards inhabited by humans. In such urban environments, they often meet their dietary needs via introduced species that live close to man such as house sparrows (Passer domesticus), and house mice (Mus musculus). They also consume anole lizards and large insects such as cicadas. They occupy the greatest range of habitats of any owl east of the Rockies. Eastern <b>screech</b> <b>owls</b> roost mainly in natural cavities in large trees, including cavities open to the sky during dry weather. In suburban and rural areas, they may roost in manmade locations such as behind loose boards on buildings, in boxcars, or on water tanks. They will also roost in dense foliage of trees, usually on a branch next to the trunk, or in dense scrubby brush. The distribution of the species is largely concurrent with the distribution of eastern deciduous woodlands, probably discontinuing at the Rocky Mountains in the west and in northern Mexico in the south due to the occupation of similar niches by other <b>screech</b> <b>owls</b> and discontinuing at the start of true boreal forest because of the occupation of a similar niche by other small owls (especially boreal owls (Aegolius funereus). Eastern <b>screech</b> <b>owls</b> may be found from sea level up to 1400 m in elevation in the eastern Rocky Mountains and up to 1500 m in the eastern Sierra Madre Oriental Mountains, although their altitudinal limits in the Appalachian Mountains, near the heart of their distribution, is not currently known.|$|R

2500|$|It {{was also}} {{confirmed}} that the bare-legged owl was distinct enough to warrant separation in its own genus. [...] The Puerto Rican <b>screech</b> <b>owl,</b> however, is just a slightly aberrant Megascops.

Its distinct coloration, approximated in the southern whiskered <b>screech</b> <b>owl</b> (Megascops trichopsis mesamericanus), is thus likely the result of strong genetic drift.|$|E

2500|$|The {{evolutionary}} relationships [...] of the scops and screech owls are {{not entirely}} clear. What is certain {{is that they are}} very closely related; they may be considered sister lineages which fill essentially the same ecological niche in their allopatric ranges. A <b>screech</b> <b>owl</b> fossil from the Late Pliocene of Kansas (which is almost identical to eastern and western screech owls) indicates a longstanding presence of these birds in the Americas, while coeval scops owl fossils very similar to the Eurasian scops owl have been found at S'Onix on Majorca. The scops and <b>screech</b> <b>owl</b> lineage probably evolved at some time during the Miocene (like most other genera of typical owls), and the three (see below) modern lineages separated perhaps roughly 5 million years ago. Note that there is no reliable estimate of divergence time, as Otus and Megascops are osteologically very similar, as is to be expected from a group that has apparently conserved its ecomorphology since before its evolutionary radiation. Like almost all scops and screech owls today, their common ancestor was in all probability already a small owl, with ear tufts and at least the upper tarsus ("leg") feathered.|$|E

25|$|Due to a nomenclatorial dispute, {{the generic}} name Scops {{is not used}} by either the scops or the <b>screech</b> <b>owls</b> (which when only a few species were known were placed together), nor by any other animal.
