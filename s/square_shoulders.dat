25|$|Square {{shoulder}} spades: Square shoulder spade coins have <b>square</b> <b>shoulders,</b> {{a straight}} or slightly curving foot, and three parallel {{lines on the}} obverse and reverse. They are found in quantities of up to several hundreds in the area corresponding to the Royal Domain of Zhou (south Hebei and north Henan). Archaeological evidence dates them to the early Spring and Autumn period, around 650 BC onwards. The inscriptions on these coins usually consist of one character, {{which can be a}} number, a cyclical character, a place name, or the name of a clan. The possibility that some inscriptions are the names of merchants has not been entertained. The crude writing is that of the artisans who made the coins, not the more careful script of the scholars who wrote the votive inscriptions on bronzes. The style of writing is consistent with that of the middle Zhou period. Over 200 inscriptions are known; many have not been fully deciphered. The characters {{can be found on the}} left or the right of the central line and are sometimes inverted or retrograde. The alloy of these coins is typically 80% copper, 15% lead, and 5% tin. They are found in hoards of hundreds, rather than thousands, sometimes tied together in bundles. Although there is no mention in the literature of their purchasing power, it is clear that they were not small change.|$|E
2500|$|Alexander Beatson, who {{published}} a {{volume on the}} Fourth Mysore War entitled View of the Origin and Conduct of the War with Tippoo Sultaun, described Tipu Sultan as follows: [...] "His stature was about five feet eight inches; he had a short neck, <b>square</b> <b>shoulders,</b> and was rather corpulent: his limbs were small, particularly his feet and hands; he had large full eyes, small arched eyebrows, and an aquiline nose; his complexion was fair, and the general expression of his countenance, not void of dignity".|$|E
2500|$|I {{saw that}} he had short hair, cut short, I thought; and I {{suddenly}} realized that his neck was oddly leathery and extremely filthy. [...] "That chap's got a very dirty and wrinkled neck!" [...] I said to myself. His body was as large as a medium-sized native's and he had thick <b>square</b> <b>shoulders,</b> not sloping at all... he seemed to be quite as tall as I. Then I saw {{that it was not a}} man. It was not an orang-utan. I had seen one of these large apes a short time before. It was more like a monstrously large siamang, but a siamang has long hair, and there was no doubt that it had short hair.|$|E

25|$|Sloping {{shoulder}} spades: Sloping shoulder spades {{usually have}} a sloping shoulder, with the two outside lines on the obverse and reverse at an angle. The central line is often missing. This type is generally smaller than the prototype or <b>square</b> <b>shoulder</b> spades. Their inscriptions are clearer, and usually consist of two characters. They {{are associated with the}} Kingdom of Zhou and the Henan area. Their smaller size indicates that they are later in date than the <b>square</b> <b>shoulder</b> spades.|$|R
40|$|In many cases, the {{stability}} of complex structures in colloidal systems is enhanced by a competition between different length scales. Inspired by recent experiments on nanoparticles coated with polymers, we use Monte Carlo simulations to explore the types of crystal structures that can form in a simple hard-core <b>square</b> <b>shoulder</b> model that explicitly incorporates two favored distances between the particles. To this end, we combine Monte Carlo-based crystal structure finding algorithms with free energies obtained using a mean-field cell theory approach, and draw phase diagrams for two different values of the <b>square</b> <b>shoulder</b> width {{as a function of}} the density and temperature. Moreover, we map out the zero-temperature phase diagram for a broad range of shoulder widths. Our results show {{the stability}} of a rich variety of crystal phases, such as body-centered orthogonal (BCO) lattices not previously considered for the <b>square</b> <b>shoulder</b> model...|$|R
60|$|He {{shrugged his}} high, <b>square</b> <b>shoulders,</b> as though indifferent; but I fancied, nevertheless, that a shade of {{annoyance}} lingered {{in his face}} for a moment.|$|E
60|$|He {{turned his}} back again and sat down with a thud; his <b>square</b> <b>shoulders</b> were shaking. Harold March darted out of the doorway into the back garden with its steep slope of statues.|$|E
6000|$|Rob {{started for}} {{school at the}} same time, looking so much like him with his books and bag and <b>square</b> <b>shoulders</b> and steady air that his mother laughed as she turned away, saying heartily: 'Bless both my dear professors, for better creatures never lived!' ...|$|E

50|$|The Gibson Guitar Company {{introduced}} its first <b>square</b> <b>shouldered</b> (similar to the Martin design) dreadnought guitar, the Hummingbird, in 1960, although Gibson's initial {{response to the}} Martin Dreadnought was the round shouldered J-35, which it introduced in 1934.|$|R
50|$|Romulan {{fashion of}} the late 24th century had {{distinctive}} <b>squared</b> <b>shoulders.</b> Hair is generally cut straight across the brow close to the eyebrows, with longer locks framing the face, cut following the cheekbones, a style reminiscent of a helmet.|$|R
6000|$|Higgledy piggledy, packed we lie, [...] Rats in a hamper, swine in a stye, [...] Wasps in a bottle, frogs in a sieve, [...] Worms in a carcase, fleas in a sleeve. [...] Hist! <b>square</b> <b>shoulders,</b> settle {{your thumbs}} [...] And buzz for the bishop--here he comes.|$|E
60|$|Her {{companion}} {{was a fine}} Western type of self-made man. He {{was tall}} and broad-shouldered, but walked a little stooping, like a man of fifty. He wore a long Prince Albert frock-coat, hanging loosely from his rather <b>square</b> <b>shoulders.</b> His white vest was noticeably soiled by his watch chain, and his tie was disarranged.|$|E
60|$|When we {{returned}} to camp, Haught and his sons were there. Even at a distance their horses, weapons, and persons satisfied my critical eye. Lee Haught was a tall, spare, superbly built man, with <b>square</b> <b>shoulders.</b> He had a brown face with deep lines and sunken cheeks, keen hazel eyes, heavy dark mustache, and hair streaked a little with gray. The only striking features of his apparel were his black sombrero and long spurs.|$|E
50|$|Both of the Berettas, and the K100, {{have the}} archetypal <b>square</b> <b>shouldered</b> lock {{protruding}} from the otherwise round barrel, easily visible at the ejection port with the slide fully forward. This <b>square</b> <b>shoulder</b> is rotated in behind a solid column of steel running {{the length of the}} slide forward of the ejection port, and on the left side out of view, when the slide and barrel are fully forward in battery. This locks the slide forward in battery. Given that the MP9 uses the same basic locking mechanism, and has a cyclical rate of fire of 900 rounds/min, the rotating barrel lock has shown itself to be capable of very fast lock times.|$|R

60|$|With that {{he dropped}} his coarse grey horseman's coat from his shoulders, and, {{extending}} his strong brawny arms {{with a look of}} determined resolution, he offered himself to the contest. The soldier was nothing abashed by the muscular frame, broad chest, <b>square</b> <b>shoulders,</b> and hardy look of his antagonist, but, whistling with great composure, unbuckled his belt, and laid aside his military coat. The company stood round them, anxious for the event.|$|E
6000|$|I caught myself {{regarding}} the shadow that spread itself out before me, multiplied itself in blue tints of various intensity, shuffled itself like {{a pack of}} cards under the many lights, the <b>square</b> <b>shoulders,</b> the silk hat, already worn with a parliamentary tilt backward; I found I was surveying this statesmanlike outline with a weak approval. [...] "A MEMBER!" [...] I felt the little cluster of people that were scattered about the lobby must be saying.|$|E
6000|$|... "All very well, Roger Harcomb," [...] cried a burly, bull-necked young man, whose <b>square</b> <b>shoulders</b> {{and massive}} limbs told of {{exceptional}} personal strength. [...] "You pass too lightly over the matter. We {{are not to}} be so easily overcrowed. The Lord Loring hath given his proofs; but we know nothing of his squires, save that one of them hath a railing tongue. And how of you, young sir?" [...] bringing his heavy hand down on Alleyne's shoulder.|$|E
50|$|Starting in 1995, Sui's {{designs were}} showcased {{regularly}} in Vogue Patterns. Her debut with the style magazine featured dresses from her Spring/Summer 1995 collection inspired by period pulp comics and the puffed sleeve, <b>square</b> <b>shouldered,</b> floral dress fashion popular {{during the war}} rationing years of 1940's era fashion. Vogue would later announce this 1940s floral style as the season's trend.|$|R
60|$|Harvey was his father's {{shadow in}} those days, {{and the two}} strolled along side by side, Cheyne using the grades {{as an excuse for}} laying his hand on the boy's <b>square</b> <b>shoulder.</b> It was then that Harvey noticed and admired what had never struck him before--his father's curious power of getting at the heart of new matters as learned from men in the street.|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{belongs to}} this village, anyway, doesn't she?" [...] he queried, {{still trying to}} speak calmly. He had risen {{to his feet and}} stood with <b>squared</b> <b>shoulders,</b> legs wide apart, and hands buried in the pockets of his tightly-fitting trousers. An ugly, ill-tempered, masterful man, who showed in every line of his {{attitude}} that he meant to be supreme lord in his own household.|$|R
60|$|He {{was not a}} man {{you would}} look at twice, ordinarily, he was smoking a great El Sol cigar. He wore clothes that were {{anything}} but new, a slouch hat, and coarse grained, square-toed boots. His trousers were creased at the knees. His head fell forward a little from his <b>square</b> <b>shoulders,</b> and leaned a bit to one side, as if meditatively. He had a light brown beard that was reddish in the sun, and he was rather short than otherwise.|$|E
60|$|To {{our right}} the unequal massive towers of St. Mary's Church soared aloft into the {{ethereal}} radiance of the air, very black on their shaded sides, glowing {{with a soft}} phosphorescent sheen on the others. In the distance the Florian Gate, thick and squat under its pointed roof, barred the street with the <b>square</b> <b>shoulders</b> {{of the old city}} wall. In the narrow, brilliantly pale vista of bluish flagstones and silvery fronts of houses, its black archway stood out small and very distinct.|$|E
60|$|In {{the small}} doorway stood {{the figure of}} a man who was so large as almost to fill up the entrance, and so black, by {{contrast}} with the glowing background, that neither feature nor form was distinguishable save his sharp outline. The outline, however, was a remarkably telling one. It told of a broad chest and <b>square</b> <b>shoulders,</b> of massive limbs, and an easy air, and a sturdy attitude, and suggested difficulty in the way of entering that hut without leave asked and obtained.|$|E
40|$|The {{system with}} the <b>square</b> <b>shoulder</b> (SS) {{potential}} is considered {{in the frame of}} Mode Coupling Theory (MCT) approach. An approximation for the structure factor is used that emphasizes the quasibinary character of the system. The qualitative phase diagram is constructed that includes continuous and discontinuous glass-glass transitions. The phase diagram is governed by two swallow tails connected with two $A_ 4 $ singularities. Comment: 8 pages, 5 figure...|$|R
5000|$|The [...]17 Ackley Bee is a wildcat {{centerfire}} {{rifle cartridge}} named after its designer, P.O. Ackley, {{and is a}} [...]218 Bee case necked down to [...]17 caliber with a <b>squarer</b> <b>shoulder</b> and less body taper. Being a rimmed case it was popular with single shot rifles such as the Martini Cadet and Low Wall Winchester. The caliber is well suited to varmint hunting particularly where minimal pelt damage is required.|$|R

60|$|This treatment, which succeeded {{so well in}} Mr. Meeker's case, Honora had {{previously}} applied to others of his sex. Like most people with a future, she began young. Of late, for instance, Mr. George Hanbury had shown a tendency to regard her as his personal property; for George had a high-handed way with him,--boys being an enigma to his mother. Even in those days he had a bullet head and a red face and <b>square</b> <b>shoulders,</b> and was rather undersized for his age--which was Honora's.|$|E
6000|$|He {{grounded}} his old gun, and, {{turning his}} head, {{glanced at the}} coloured lithograph of Garibaldi in a black frame on the white wall; a thread of strong sunshine cut it perpendicularly. His eyes, accustomed to the luminous twilight, made out the high colouring of the face, the red of the shirt, {{the outlines of the}} <b>square</b> <b>shoulders,</b> the black patch of the Bersagliere hat with cock's feathers curling over the crown. An immortal hero! This was your liberty; it gave you not only life, but immortality as well! ...|$|E
60|$|He looked with {{a sudden}} sense of astonishment at Clyffurde, {{as if he were}} only seeing him now for the first time. His keen dark eyes took in with a rapid glance the Englishman's {{powerful}} personality, the <b>square</b> <b>shoulders,</b> the head well erect, the strong Anglo-Saxon chin firmly set, the slender hands always in repose. In the whole attitude of the man there was an air of will-power which had never struck de Marmont quite so forcibly as it did now, and a virility which looked as ready to challenge Fate as it was able to conquer her if she proved adverse.|$|E

60|$|In {{the attic}} which filled the whole top story, Harz had pulled a canvas to the window. He {{was a young}} man of middle height, <b>square</b> <b>shouldered,</b> active, with an angular face, high cheek-bones, and a strong, sharp chin. His eyes were {{piercing}} and steel-blue, his eyebrows very flexible, nose long and thin with a high bridge; and his dark, unparted hair fitted him like a cap. His clothes looked as if he never gave them a second thought.|$|R
