RNDr. Jiří Tůma, DrSc., Department of Algebra Abstract: The work {{summarizes}} {{two main}} papers, A New Type of 2 -block Colli- sions in MD 5 and On the Number of <b>Binary</b> <b>Signed</b> Digit Representations of a Given Weight, while containing also the wider {{introduction to the}} topic of crypt- analysis of MD 5 and <b>binary</b> <b>signed</b> digit representations (BSDR's). In the first paper we have implemented and applied Stevens algorithm to the newly proposed initial message differences and constructed a new type of collisions in MD 5. In the second paper we have introduced and proved a new improved bound for the number of optimal BSDR's and also a new recursive bound for the number of BSDR's of a given integer with a given overweight. In addition to the results in mentioned papers, the generalized result is stated with the new bound for the number of optimal D-representations of natural numbers with D = { 0, 1, 3 }.

40|$|We {{scrutinize the}} monthly {{realized}} stock-bond correlation based upon high frequency returns. In particular, {{we use a}} probit model to track {{the dynamics of the}} sign of the correlation relative to its various economic forces. The sign is predictable to a large extent with bond market liquidity being the most important variable. Moreover, stock market volatility, inflation uncertainty, short rate volatility, and bond volatility have significant effects upon the sign. In addition, we use quantile regressions to pin down the systematic variation of the extreme tails of the realized stock-bond correlation over its economic determinants. We document that the correlation behaves di¤erently when it is large negative (0. 10 quantile) as opposed to when it is large positive (0. 90 quantile). Nevertheless, the empirical findings are only partially robust to using other, possibly less precise, measures of the stock-bond correlation.

50|$|Arithmetic shifts can {{be useful}} as {{efficient}} ways to perform multiplication or division of signed integers by powers of two. Shifting left by n bits on a signed or unsigned binary number {{has the effect of}} multiplying it by 2n. Shifting right by n bits on a two's complement <b>signed</b> <b>binary</b> number has the effect of dividing it by 2n, but it always rounds down (towards negative infinity). This is different from the way rounding is usually done in signed integer division (which rounds towards 0). This discrepancy has led to bugs in more than one compiler.|$|E

BackgroundA recent study suggested that a binary endocardial appearance is a highly sensitive and specific discriminator of AFD from other causes of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). MethodsFourteen patients with AFD (55. 4 ± 9. 9 years, 9 men) and 14 patients with HCM (57. 2 ± 10. 9 years, 9 men) {{were randomly selected from}} a dedicated patient database. Two-dimensional echo images were blindly reviewed by 2 experienced echocardiographers. ResultsMaximum left ventricular (LV) wall thickness, LV end-systolic dimension, fractional shortening, and left atrial size were similar in the 2 patient groups. The LV end-diastolic dimension was smaller in patients with HCM (p = 0. 04). A <b>binary</b> <b>sign</b> was present in 8 of 28 patients (29 %). The sensitivity and specificity of the <b>binary</b> <b>sign</b> as a discriminator of AFD from HCM were 35 % and 79 %, respectively.
