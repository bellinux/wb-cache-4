6000|$|... "I'm going ahead," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Dave,</b> resolutely. He and his {{companion}} had provided themselves with sticks, and Gus had also picked up two stones.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's no use," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Dave,</b> finally. [...] "We'll {{go back to}} Bixter, {{take another}} look around, {{and then return to}} Clayton and home." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank fortune, that peril is a {{thing of}} the past!" [...] <b>said</b> <b>Dave,</b> fervently; and the other boys and Captain Marshall echoed his sentiments.|$|E
