25|$|Consistent {{with the}} broader scope of <b>systems</b> <b>engineering,</b> the <b>Systems</b> <b>Engineering</b> Body of Knowledge (SEBoK) has defined {{three types of}} systems engineering: (1) Product <b>Systems</b> <b>Engineering</b> (PSE) is the {{traditional}} <b>systems</b> <b>engineering</b> focused {{on the design of}} physical systems consisting of hardware and software. (2) Enterprise <b>Systems</b> <b>Engineering</b> (ESE) pertains to the view of enterprises, that is, organizations or combinations of organizations, as systems. (3) Service <b>Systems</b> <b>Engineering</b> (SSE) {{has to do with the}} engineering of service systems. Checkland defines a service system as a system which is conceived as serving another system.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to calculate, design and evaluate support structure safety of regional wind <b>system</b> <b>engineering.</b> First of all, wind loading was calculated based on the building structure norm. Secondly, support structures of regional wind <b>system</b> <b>engineering</b> were designed using CAD. Finally, structure safety of regional wind <b>system</b> <b>engineering</b> was analyzed with finite element ANSYS software. The results showed that the wind <b>system</b> <b>engineering</b> structure is away from harmful fluctuating. Wind load cycle does not match resonance phenomenon. Under fluctuating wind loads, the engineering windbreak structure displacement and stress were dynamic amplification effect.

25|$|In 1990, a {{professional}} society for <b>systems</b> <b>engineering,</b> the National Council on <b>Systems</b> <b>Engineering</b> (NCOSE), {{was founded by}} representatives {{from a number of}} U.S. corporations and organizations.

As a result of growing involvement from systems engineers outside of the U.S., the name of the organization was changed to the International Council on <b>Systems</b> <b>Engineering</b> (INCOSE) in 1995.
