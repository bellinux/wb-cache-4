Salt {{levels in the}} flesh, which reached 11 to 14 % (wet weight basis) during the ripening period, were found to retard histamine formation. During normal spoilage of ice chilled fish, histamine levels had been reported to exceed 50 mg/ 100 g flesh as it approached the limit of edibility whilst, in the heavily salted fish, levels remained below 20 mg/ 100 g flesh throughout the ripening periods of 18 months for the 4 °C batches and 3 months for the 25 °C batches. This was the case when the samples were set up and the salt allowed penetrating the flesh at 4 °C. When, however, the samples were set up and initially stored at ambient (10 - 15 °C) temperature the histamine levels in the flesh rose above 20 mg/ 100 g before enough salt had penetrated to inhibit its generation.

Irrespective of sex, all fish exhibited various clinical signs of barotrauma, including a prolapsed cloaca (60 % of fish); gastric herniation (46 %); ruptured swim bladder (73 %); organ displacement (48 %); and kidney (3 %), liver (73 %) and coloemic-cavity haemorrhaging (33 %);with the frequency of nearly all positively associated with capture depth. Reproductive stage was also an important barotrauma predictor (reflecting related morphological changes) with a general trend towards <b>spent</b> <b>fish</b> least likely to incur the various clinical signs—especially for a prolapsed cloaca (also common among immature or resting fish and significantly affected by food in the digestive tract) and a ruptured swim bladder (common among ripe or spawning fish).

40|$|I- Virginia's river {{fisheries}} for American shad {{have been}} under moratorium since 1994. The moratorium is partial since the three stocks (in the James, York, and RappahannockE rivers) are harvested to an unknown degree in an offshore mixed-stock fishery. Current tA research efforts have three objectives: (1) to determine current status of the stocks rel-ative to historical levels, (2) to determine appropriate target catch-rate levels for restoration, and (3) to develop new assessment tools so that a future moratorium can be avoided. Current status is being evaluated by monitoring catch rate of commercial fishers who are paid to fish with historical methods in historical locations; the contem-porary catch rates are compared to those recorded in logbooks completed voluntarily by fishers prior to the closure. We propose to define restoration targets in terms of his-toric catch rates recorded in logbooks. This requires determination of relative catching power of historic (multifilament) and modern (monofilament) nets. Two novel assess-ment methods are being evaluated: index-removal and change-in-ratio methods. These are based on comparing the catch rate and catch composition, respectively, of ripening fish and <b>spent</b> <b>fish</b> {{near the mouth of}} the river. During a moratorium, the parameters should be the same for ripening and <b>spent</b> <b>fish,</b> thus providing a critical check on the model assumptions. Maturity information is needed to forecast recruitment but previ-ous estimates of maturity-at-age schedules are biased. Improved estimates can be obtained using a new statistical method which requires that there be a moratorium. It is unfortunate for society when a fish population declines to the point where a mora-torium must be declared but a moratorium can provide important opportunities for testing methods and estimating parameters. The harvest of American shad (Alosa sapidissi-ma) in Virginia's rivers and the Virginia portion of Chesapeake Bay has been prohibited since 1994, when a moratorium was declared by the Virginia Marine Resources Commission (VMRC) in response to declining harvest and catch rates. A moratorium was established in Maryland waters in 1980.

40|$|In {{majority}} of the marine fishes from tropical areas, maturation is a continuous process resulting in the occurrence of mature fishes throughout the year. In several Indian marine fishes, because of multiple spawning, a truly <b>spent</b> <b>fish</b> is scarcely found and also difficult to identify.

As the eggs contained in the ovary are progressively ripened and shed, the ovary itself grows smaller, and to the naked eye, seems to reverse the stages by which it attained fuji maturity. The ovaries of such fi shes, though superficially resemble the normal stages III to V, differ from them in macroscopic appearance as well as microscopic structure to some extent. It occurred to the authors that such partially spent ovaries of fishes yield clues to the frequency or spawning in different species.

40|$|Samples from {{commercial}} trawl landings for reductional purposes {{show that the}} Norwegian catches recorded as Norway pout in the fishery statistics consist of 50 — 70 prosent blue whiting during the autumn and 30 — 60 prosent during late spring and summer. The contribution is somewhat lower in the winter. Blue whiting of the 0 -group enters the fishery in the autumn, and this yearclass dominates the catches then and throughout winter and spring. The catches in the summer consist of older, <b>spent</b> <b>fish.</b> Material collected during 9 research vessel surveys support this pattern. The 0 -group fish entering {{the area in the}} autumn seem all the years, apart from the 1969 yearclass, to have left the area as I-group fish the succeding summer. Hydrographic observations made during the cruises indicate that the young fish and the older fish inhabit different water and depth regimes. The 0 -group seems in the autumn to be confined to the incoming Atlantic water along the shelfedge of the North Sea Plateau towards the Norwegian Deep. The older fish are found somewhat deeper in the colder, deep water of the Norwegian Deep. The older fish can accordingly be distributed in a wider volume of water. Furthermore, a more pelagic occurrence then the younger fish makes them less available to bottom trawl, and it is suggested that the resources of older fish in the North Sea are greater than the catches indicate. Echo integrator recordings made during the surveys indicate that the 1969 yearclass was stronger represented in the North Sea than the 1970 and 1971 yearclasses. Similarly the 1972 yearclass seems to have been stronger in the North Sea than the 1971 and 1973 yearclasses. No spawning is recorded neither in the Norwegian Sea nor in the North Sea, and it is concluded that the immigration of 0 -group fish in the autumn and of older, <b>spent</b> <b>fish</b> in the late spring and summer originates from the spawning areas west of the British Isles. Apart from yearclass strength, it is suggested that the amount of 0 -group fish entering the Norwegian Deep each autumn is strongly influenced by the influx of Atlantic water at that time.

40|$|The {{proportion}} of mature fish at age or length {{is one of}} the most important population attributes in assessing reproductive potential. This pro-portion is usually named the maturity ogive. The most crucial step in estimating this proportion deals with maturity staging assessed by macro-scopic or histology analysis. Macroscopic analysis is relatively inexpensive but usually introduces large amount of error. Histology is the most accuratemethod formaturity staging but is expensive and time consuming. Here,wepropose using the gonadosomatic index (GSI) as an alternative way to estimate thematurityogives. A logisticmultinomialmodelwas implemented to separate immature,mature-active, andmature-inactive fish, based only on their value of GSI.

The lengths of fish at age did not differ between individuals infected with H. diceraus and uninfected ones.

40|$|Rationalization” or {{the change}} to catch share {{management}} in fisheries {{has been shown to}} lead to the slowing of fishing activity, input and effort consolidation, cost savings, as well as new market and product development. The effects of rationalization on fishermen’s behavior become more complex when one accounts for the spillover effects that catch share programs can create in other fisheries and other regions. The possession of secure harvesting privileges in one catch share fishery allows quota shareholders to expand operations in other fisheries since their share of the catch share fishery is protected (a “diversification” effect). However, there is an opportunity cost related to the slowing of the rate of fishing, given that more time <b>spent</b> <b>fishing</b> in the catch share fishery means there will be less time available for fishing elsewhere. Therefore, it is possible that more efficient vessels may expand their operations and specialize in the catch share fishery leaving the selling/lessor vessels to specialize in another fishery and/or region (a “specialization” effect). Which outcome is more likely is an empirical question, which we address by examining the recently implemented U. S. West Coast Groundfish Trawl Catch Share Program.

A total of 175 individuals were caught monthly between April 2001 and June 2002 in the Lajes Reservoir, Brazil, {{one of the}} largest impoundment areas in the state of Rio de Janeiro. The reproductive classes were based upon changes in the testicular morphology and stages of germinative cells, i. e., resting, early maturing, late maturing, mature, partially spent and totally <b>spent.</b> <b>Fish</b> in the resting class showed testes with spermatogonia and spermatocytes along the wall of seminal lobules, while spermatids were present in the lumina of the lobules. During early maturing, active spermatogenesis occurs throughout the testis; in the late maturing and mature classes, the lobules are swollen with sperm that are typical of fish in breeding condition. Spent testes presented seminal lobules with residual spermatozoa, coinciding with decreasing GSI and greatly reduced sperm production. Overall, the testicular morphology and class of maturity development of O. hepsetus in the Lajes reservoir did not differ significantly from those of closely related species in other lentic environments.

40|$|Pfiesteria spp. are mixotrophic armored {{dinoflagellates}} populating the Atlantic {{coastal waters}} of the United States. They have been a focus of intense research due to their reported association with several fish mortality events. We have now used a clonal culture of Pfiesteria piscicida and several new environmental isolates to describe growth characteristics, feeding, and factors contributing to the encystment and germination of the organism in both laboratory and environmental samples. We also discuss applied methods of detection of the different morphological forms of Pfiesteria in environmental samples. In summary, Pfiesteria, when grown with its algal prey, Rhodomonas sp., presents a typical growth curve with lag, exponential, and stationary phases, followed by encystment. The doubling time in exponential phase is about 12 h. The profiles of proliferation under a standard light cycle and in the dark were similar, although the peak cell densities were markedly lower when cells were grown in the dark. The addition of urea, chicken manure, and soil extracts did not enhance Pfiesteria proliferation, but crude unfiltered spent aquarium water did.
