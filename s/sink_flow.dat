This is in striking contrast to canonical constant-pressure turbulent boundary layers that show such comprehensive log scaling only at ultra-high Reynolds numbers. This demonstrates that ultra-high Reynolds number is not necessary for comprehensive log scaling to occur; while specific details of the <b>sink</b> <b>flow</b> are special, the relevance to general turbulent boundary layers is that the <b>sink</b> <b>flow</b> {{underscores the importance of}} the streamwise invariance condition that needs to be met in a general flow for obtaining log scaling.

40|$|The {{time history}} of the velocity, size, and {{deformation}} of a bubble moving in the flow field around a point source or sink is studied analytically. Consideration {{is given to the}} case where the changes in the bubble velocity, size, and deformation are caused by the dynamic forces of the fluid, rather than the initial perturbation of the bubble shape. The effect of viscosity and gravitation is neglected. The flow is considered irrotational and the velocity potential is assumed to exist. The gas, vapor, or their mixture inside the bubble undergoes a polytropic process. The governing equations for the translatory motion, size, and deformation of the bubble are derived by perturbation theory. The analysis is general and may be applied to an initially spherical as well as nonspherical bubble. It is disclosed that the time {{history of the}} bubble's translating velocity in a <b>sink</b> <b>flow</b> is monotonically increasing, while in a source flow it varies following two typical patterns depending upon the initial velocity. In a <b>sink</b> <b>flow,</b> an initially spherical bubble can maintain a nearly spherical shape over a rather long distance as it grows, while in a source flow, the bubble shape varies with time in various ways, depending on the initial velocity.

Measurements revealed the existence of non-universal logarithmic laws, in both inner and defect coordinates, even when the mean velocity descriptions departed strongly from the universal logarithmic law (with universal values of the Kármán constant and the inner law intercept). Systematic dependences of slope and intercepts for inner and outer logarithmic laws on the strength of the pressure gradient were observed. A theory based on the method of matched asymptotic expansions was developed in order to explain the experimentally observed variations of log-law constants with the non-dimensional pressure gradient parameter (Δp=(ν/ρU 3 τ) dp/dx).

40|$|The work {{reported}} in this thesis is an experimental and theoretical investigation of the so-called <b>sink</b> <b>flow</b> boundary layers. These are two-dimensional (in the mean), favourable-pressure-gradient (FPG) boundary layer flows where the boundary layers experience stream-wise acceleration inside a two-dimensional convergent channel with smooth and plane walls. The boundary layers studied are mainly turbulent with few cases that may be identified as reverse-transitional. The <b>sink</b> <b>flow</b> turbulent boundary layers (TBLs) are the only smooth-walled layers that are in ‘perfect equilibrium’ or ‘exact self-preservation’ {{in the sense of}} Townsend (1976) and Rotta (1962). The present boundary layer experiments were conducted in an open-return low-speed wind tunnel. The <b>sink</b> <b>flow</b> conditions were established on the test-plate by using a contoured test-section ceiling for creating a convergent channel with smooth and plane walls. The strength of the streamwise FPG was varied by changing the freestream speed in the test-section. Few zero-pressure-gradient (ZPG) turbulent boundary layers were also measured in the same tunnel for which the contoured ceiling was replaced by a straight one. The velocity measurement techniques used include conventional Pitot-tubes for mean flow measurements and hotwire/crosswire probes for turbulence measurements. For measurement of skin friction in ZPG flows, Preston-tube was used while for the sink flows the so-called surface hotwire method was employed. Static pressures were measured on the test-surface using an alcohol-based projection manometer. Boundary layers were tripped {{at the beginning of the}} test-plate to ensure quick transition to turbulence. The mean velocity scaling in <b>sink</b> <b>flow</b> TBLs in the presence of strong FPG has been studied systematically, especially in view of the apparent pressure-gradient-dependence of the logarithmic laws {{reported in}} the literature (Spalart & Leonard, 1986; Nickels, 2004; Chauhan et al., 2007). The experimental study of <b>sink</b> <b>flow</b> TBLs carried out over a wide range of streamwise FPGs has shown that the mean velocity profiles (in inner coordinates) exhibit systematic departures from the universal logarithmic law as the pressure gradient parameter ∆p is varied. Even so, each of these profiles exhibits a logarithmic region, albeit non-universal, whose constants are functions of the pressure gradient. Systematic dependence of these constants on the pressure gradient parameter ∆p is observed. Moreover, the wake region is uniformly absent in all these profiles. In other words, each profile looks like a ‘pure wall-flow’, in the sense of Coles (1957), only if it is viewed in relation to its own non-universal logarithmic law. To support the experimental observation of the pressure-gradient-dependence of logarithmic laws in <b>sink</b> <b>flow</b> TBLs, a theory based on the method of matched asymptotic expansions has been applied to <b>sink</b> <b>flow</b> TBLs and this theory reveals a systematic dependence of inner and outer logarithmic laws on the pressure gradient parameter ∆p. This dependence is essentially a higher-order effect and therefore becomes significant only in the presence of relatively strong pressure gradients. Comparison of the theory with the experimental data demonstrates that the disappearance of the universal logarithmic law in strong FPG situations does not necessarily imply the absence of classical inner-outer overlap region. The overlap may still manifest itself as a logarithmic functional form with constants that are strongly influenced by the magnitude of the FPG. An immediate use of the non-universal log laws is towards the estimation skin friction in strong-pressure-gradient equilibrium and near-equilibrium TBL flows and this issue has been studied in some detail. It is shown that the conventional Clauser-chart method for estimation of skin friction (which gives fairly accurate results for ZPG or mild-pressure-gradient flows), originally proposed by Clauser (1954), can be modified to deal with the situations involving strong streamwise pressure gradients, provided that the equilibrium or near-equilibrium TBL under consideration is not very close to relaminarization or separation. In such cases, the overlap layer manifests itself in the form of non-universal logarithmic laws that are dependent on the local strength of the pressure gradient. Using these non-universal log laws in conjunction with the measured pressure distribution (necessary for obtaining the acceleration parameter K) and a measured mean velocity profile, it is possible to obtain the local skin friction coefficient to an accuracy which is typical of skin friction measurements. This modified Clauser-chart method (MCCM) employs a two-fold iterative procedure (one iteration on Cf and the other on ∆p) in contrast to the conventional method that involves only one iteration (on Cf alone). As a by-product of this MCCM, one obtains the local pressure gradient parameter ∆p and the slope 1 /κ and intercept C of the non-universal log law for that profile. It is also demonstrated that the arm´MCCM is quite robust to the changes in the universal values of K´arman constant κ 0 and intercept C 0 for the ZPG turbulent boundary layer. Various aspects of the large-scale structure in turbulent and reverse-transitional <b>sink</b> <b>flow</b> boundary layers subjected to streamwise FPGs have also been investigated. The use of <b>sink</b> <b>flow</b> configuration allows systematic characterization of the large-scale structure with the strength of the FPG as a parameter where the characterization is not contaminated by the upstream history effects. The large-scale structure is identified by cross-correlating the wall-shear stress fluctuation with the streamwise velocity fluctuation. The structure orientation is found to be linear over a large wall-normal extent typically extending from y/δ of 0. 1 to 0. 6. Beyond y/δ = 0. 6, the correlation under consideration becomes very weak to allow any conclusive results. The average structure inclination angle αavg is found to decrease systematically with increase in the streamwise FPG. This result is important and has implications towards modeling of the near-wall region. Further it is found that the structure gets elongated considerably as the FPG is increased, i. e. the streamwise spatial extent of the structure increases. Taken together, it is observed that the structure becomes flatter and longer with the increase in FPG. Structural models are proposed for <b>sink</b> <b>flow</b> TBLs in the form of either the shape of individual hairpin vortices or the possible structural self-organization. These models are then discussed in the light of present experimental results. It is also shown that the process of relaminarization of a TBL by strong FPG may be better appreciated by appealing to these structural models. The validity of Taylor’s hypothesis for structure angle measurements in the present study has been established experimentally. This exercise is important since the flows under consideration are highly accelerated and sometimes even reverse-transitional. In most of the previous work on the validity of Taylor’s hypothesis, at least for the measurements similar to the present work, the emphasis has been on ZPG turbulent boundary layers. The present exercise is therefore crucial for accelerating flows. Possible reasons for the observed validity of Taylor’s hypothesis have also been identified − specifically it is seen that the condition ∆xp/L << 1 needs to be met for Taylor’s hypothesis to be valid in pressure gradient flows. Investigation of the structure convection velocity from the space-time correlations has revealed that the convection velocity of a typical structure in the present <b>sink</b> <b>flow</b> boundary layers is almost equal to the local mean velocity (more than 90 %). This implies that the structure gets convected downstream almost along with the mean flow. Near-wall ‘active’ and ‘inactive’ motions in <b>sink</b> <b>flow</b> TBLs have been studied, discussed and compared with the corresponding results for ZPG turbulent boundary layers from five different aspects: (i) turbulent diffusion of TKE, (ii) quadrant statistics, (iii) profiles of the streamwise turbulence intensity, (iv) event correlation length scales obtained from conditional sampling on the instantaneous flux signal and (v) profiles of the Townsend parameter Tp =(−uv) /u 2. Near-wall inactive motion is seen to be related to the strength of the large-eddy structure in the outer region of TBL flow. For APG flows the near-wall inactive motion is known to be more intense (Bradshaw, 1967 b) than the ZPG flows, say at the same K´arman number δ+. This observation is consistent with a stronger large-eddy structure that may be perceived from the stronger wake component in the mean velocity variation and the larger mean entrainment in an APG turbulent boundary layer as compared to the ZPG flow at same δ+. In <b>sink</b> <b>flow</b> TBLs, the large-eddy structure is much weaker in comparison to the ZPG flow at same δ+ which is consistent with the absence of wake component in the mean velocity profile as well as the zero mean entrainment into the layer. A <b>sink</b> <b>flow</b> TBL represents, a state of weakest large-eddy structure and hence minimum intensity of inactive motion compared to any other equilibrium or near-equilibrium TBL flow having the same K´arman number δ+.

The main diagnostics are flow visualization using dye, laser induced fluorescence (LIF), particle streak photographs and particle image velocimetry (Ply).

It is found that the characteristic inclination angle of the structure undergoes a systematic decrease with the increase in strength of the streamwise favourable pressure gradient. Detectable wall-normal extent of the structure is found to be typically half of the boundary layer thickness. Streamwise extent of the structure shows marked increase as the favourable pressure gradient is made progressively severe. Proposals for the typical eddy forms in <b>sink</b> <b>flow</b> turbulent and reverse-transitional flows are presented, and the possibility of structural self-organization (i. e. individual hairpin vortices forming streamwise coherent hairpin packets) in these flows is also discussed. It is further indicated that these structural ideas may be used to explain, from a structural viewpoint, the phenomenon of soft relaminarization or reverse transition of turbulent boundary layers when subjected to strong streamwise favourable pressure gradients. Taylor's 'frozen turbulence' hypothesis is experimentally shown to be valid for flows in the present study even though large streamwise accelerations are involved, the flow being even reverse transitional in some cases. Possible conditions, which are required to be satisfied for the safe use of Taylor's hypothesis in pressure-gradient-driven flows, are also outlined.
