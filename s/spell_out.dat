When giving his contact address, he would slowly <b>spell</b> <b>out</b> 'Keynsham' letter by letter, and this became an amusing feature for many young listeners.|$|E

5|$|Albion {{were one}} of the {{founding}} members of the Football League in 1888 and have spent the majority of their existence in the top tier of English football. They have been champions of England once, in 1919–20, and have been runners-up twice but they have had more success in the FA Cup, winning it five times. The first came in 1888, the year the league was founded, and the most recent in 1968, their last major trophy. They also won the Football League Cup at the first attempt in 1966. The club's longest consecutive period in the top division spanned twenty-four years between 1949 and 1973, and from 1986 to 2002 they spent their longest ever <b>spell</b> <b>out</b> of the top division. They currently play in the Premier League.|$|E

His debut came after {{starting a}} 4–1 away defeat to Sheffield Wednesday in the League Cup on 11 August 2015.

He suffered a broken nose on his return as an 89th-minute substitute in a 3–1 away win over Barnet on 28 November 2015, and continued to struggle with his shin injury. Beardsley's first Mansfield goal in over nine years came on 30 January 2016 with a header from Malvind Benning's corner on 60 minutes in a 1–0 away victory over Crawley. He finished 2015–16 with 16 appearances and one goal as Mansfield ranked in 12th-place in League Two. He was released by the club in May 2016.|$|E
5|$|Mills {{signed for}} Second Division club Leicester City on 2 March 1989 {{as part of}} the deal that saw Phil Turner join County for a fee of £125,000, with over two months of 1988–89 remaining.

He made 13 consecutive appearances for Leicester before missing the last two matches of 1988–89, his new club finishing 15th in the Second Division. His first goal for Leicester was the only goal in a 1–0 win away to Stoke City on 25 November 1989. Other than a <b>spell</b> <b>out</b> of the team from early September to mid November 1989, Mills was a regular in the Leicester team that ranked 13th place in the Second Division in 1989–90, making 30 appearances and scoring four goals.

5|$|On 20 November, Grayson reiterated {{his desire}} to keep Kisnorbo but stated {{that he had to}} prove his fitness before being offered a new deal at Leeds. Kisnorbo got an {{infection}} on his Achilles tendon injury, and stepped up his rehab by going to the USA for treatment. Kisnorbo returned to Leeds' training ground Thorp Arch during mid January. However, on 11 March 2011, it was confirmed that he would not play again in the 2010–11 season. As Kisnorbo's contract was set to expire in June 2011, he had to prove his fitness to the coaching staff at Leeds in the hope of earning a new contract, or be free to join another club. In March 2011, Kisnorbo returned to full training with Leeds after his long <b>spell</b> <b>out</b> injured.|$|E

Unaware of Taylor's suit, Beckham filed suit against Taylor for possession of the capitol and executive building in Franklin County circuit court – a court believed to be favorable to the Democratic cause. Marshall also filed suit against Beckham and state senator L. H. Carter to prevent them from exercising any authority in the state senate, where the lieutenant governor was the presiding officer.|$|E

5|$|Donkey Kong Country is a {{platform}} game where players must complete 40 different side-scrolling levels (or 41 in the Game Boy Color version) and recover the Kongs' banana hoard, {{which has been}} stolen by the Kremlings. Each level is uniquely themed and consists of varying tasks such as swimming, riding in mine carts, launching out of barrel cannons, or swinging from vine to vine. The player begins {{with a minimum of}} six lives. Players lose a life if they get hit by any enemy or fall off the screen. To defeat an enemy, players can either execute a roll, jump or hand slap (a move only usable by Donkey Kong). However, some enemies cannot be taken down in this manner, so the player must throw a barrel or use the assistance of an animal. Enemies vary in difficulty, usually becoming tougher to take down as the game progresses. When the player has lost all their lives, the game is over. However, the player can gain additional lives by collecting items scattered throughout the levels, including bananas, golden letters that <b>spell</b> <b>out</b> K–O–N–G, extra life balloons, and golden animal tokens that lead to bonus levels. There are also many secret passages that can lead to bonus games where the player can earn additional lives or other items, as well as gain possible shortcuts through the level.|$|E
5|$|After {{making a}} mistake that led to York conceding a goal late on in a 1–1 draw away to Forest Green on 26 November 2011, he was {{replaced}} in the line-up by McGurk for the next match at home to Lincoln three days later. This {{was the start of}} a second extended <b>spell</b> <b>out</b> of the team for Smith that season, before returning to play as a defensive midfielder in a 3–5–2 formation for York's FA Trophy first-round replay away to Solihull Moors on 13 December 2011. He scored his first goal of the season in the 11th minute of this match, converting Scott Kerr's cross at the far post, with York going on to win 3–0. However, he returned to the bench for the subsequent league match against Kidderminster on 19 December 2011, with York reverting to their usual 4–3–3 formation. With York reverting to 3–5–2 for a 1–1 draw away to Mansfield on 26 December 2011, Smith returned as a defensive midfielder, but after picking up his fifth yellow card of the season was suspended for the reverse fixture at home to Mansfield on 1 January 2012. Smith captained York to victory in the 2012 FA Trophy Final at Wembley Stadium on 12 May 2012, with Newport County being beaten 2–0. This was the first time York had won a national knockout competition. Eight days later, he captained York to a 2–1 victory over Luton in the 2012 Conference Premier play-off Final at Wembley Stadium, meaning the club regained Football League status after eight years with promotion to League Two.|$|E
25|$|There are two {{standards}} for listing verbs in dictionaries.
