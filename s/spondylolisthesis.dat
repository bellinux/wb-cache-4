5|$|Nash has {{a medical}} {{condition}} called <b>spondylolisthesis,</b> which causes muscle tightness and back pain. Due to the condition, {{when he is not}} playing in basketball games, he lies on his back rather than sitting on the bench to keep his muscles from stiffening.|$|E
25|$|<b>Spondylolisthesis</b> is {{the forward}} {{displacement}} of a vertebra and retrolisthesis is a posterior displacement of one vertebral body {{with respect to}} the adjacent vertebra to a degree less than a dislocation.|$|E
25|$|Other {{compressive}} spinal causes include lumbar spinal stenosis, {{a condition}} in which the spinal canal (the spaces the spinal cord runs through) narrows and compresses the spinal cord, cauda equina, or sciatic nerve roots. This narrowing can be caused by bone spurs, <b>spondylolisthesis,</b> inflammation, or a herniated disc, which decreases available space for the spinal cord, thus pinching and irritating nerves from the spinal cord that travel to the sciatic nerves.|$|E
25|$|After {{suffering}} from sciatica caused by two bulging discs in his back, a <b>spondylolisthesis</b> (vertebral displacement) and a bone spur that {{interfered with the}} nerve, Agassi retired from professional tennis on September 3, 2006, after losing {{in the third round}} of the US Open to Benjamin Becker. He is the founder of the Andre Agassi Charitable Foundation, which has raised over $60million for at-risk children in Southern Nevada. In 2001, the Foundation opened the Andre Agassi College Preparatory Academy in Las Vegas, a K-12 public charter school for at-risk children. He has been married to fellow tennis player Steffi Graf since 2001.|$|E
25|$|About 90% of {{the time}} sciatica {{is due to a}} spinal disc {{herniation}} pressing on one of the lumbar or sacral nerve roots. Other problems that may result in sciatica include <b>spondylolisthesis,</b> spinal stenosis, piriformis syndrome, pelvic tumors, and compression by a baby's head during pregnancy. The straight-leg-raising test is often helpful in diagnosis. The test is positive if, when the leg is raised while a person is lying on their back, pain shoots below the knee. In most cases medical imaging is not needed. Exceptions to this are when bowel or bladder function is affected, there is significant loss of feeling or weakness, symptoms are long standing, or there is a concern of a tumor or infection. Conditions that may present similarly are diseases of the hip and early herpes zoster before the rash appears.|$|E
25|$|Sciatica is {{generally}} {{caused by the}} compression of lumbar nerves L4, or L5 or sacral nerves S1, S2, or S3, or by compression of the sciatic nerve itself. When sciatica is caused by compression of a dorsal nerve root (radix), it is considered a lumbar radiculopathy (or radiculitis when accompanied with an inflammatory response). This can occur {{as a result of}} a spinal disk bulge or spinal disc herniation (a herniated intervertebral disc), or from roughening, enlarging, or misalignment (<b>spondylolisthesis)</b> of the vertebrae, or as a result of degenerated discs that can reduce the diameter of the lateral foramen (natural hole) through which nerve roots exit the spine. The intervertebral discs consist of an annulus fibrosus, which forms a ring surrounding the inner nucleus pulposus. When there is a tear in the anulus fibrosus, the nucleus pulposus (pulp) may extrude through the tear and press against spinal nerves within the spinal cord, cauda equina, or exiting nerve roots, causing inflammation, numbness, or excruciating pain. Inflammation of the spinal canal can also spread to adjacent facet joints and cause lower back pain and/or referred pain in the posterior thigh(s). Pseudosciatic pain can also be caused by compression of peripheral sections of the nerve, usually from soft tissue tension in the piriformis or related muscles.|$|E
2500|$|Diagnosis {{is made by}} a {{practitioner}} based on the history, symptoms, and physical examination. [...] At {{some point in the}} evaluation, tests may be performed to confirm or rule out other causes of symptoms such as <b>spondylolisthesis,</b> degeneration, tumors, metastases and space-occupying lesions, as well as to evaluate the efficacy of potential treatment options.|$|E
2500|$|Pain {{caused by}} a {{compression}} or irritation of the sciatic nerve by {{a problem in the}} lower back is called sciatica. [...] Common causes of sciatica include the following lower back and hip conditions: [...] spinal disc herniation, degenerative disc disease, lumbar spinal stenosis, <b>spondylolisthesis,</b> and piriformis syndrome. [...] Other acute causes of sciatica include coughing, muscular hypertension, and sneezing.|$|E
2500|$|Some of {{the terms}} {{commonly}} {{used to describe the}} condition include herniated disc, prolapsed disc, ruptured disc and slipped disc. Other phenomena that are closely related include disc protrusion, pinched nerves, sciatica, disc disease, disc degeneration, degenerative disc disease, and black disc. The popular term slipped disc is a misnomer, as the intervertebral discs are tightly sandwiched between two vertebrae to which they are attached, and cannot actually [...] "slip", or even get out of place. The disc is actually grown together with the adjacent vertebrae and can be squeezed, stretched and twisted, all in small degrees. It can also be torn, ripped, herniated, and degenerated, but it cannot [...] "slip". Some authors consider that the term [...] "slipped disc" [...] is harmful, as it leads to an incorrect idea of what has occurred and thus of the likely outcome. However, during growth, one vertebral body can slip relative to an adjacent vertebral body, a deformity called <b>spondylolisthesis.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Dysplastic <b>spondylolisthesis</b> (a.k.a. type 1) {{results from}} {{congenital}} abnormalities {{of the upper}} sacral facets or inferior facets of the fifth lumbar vertebra, and accounts for 14% to 21% of all <b>spondylolisthesis.</b>|$|E
50|$|Degenerative <b>spondylolisthesis</b> with spinal {{stenosis}} {{is one of}} the most common indications for spine surgery (typically a laminectomy) among older adults. Both minimally invasive and open surgical techniques are used to treat <b>spondylolisthesis.</b>|$|E

50|$|Forward {{displacement}} of a proximal vertebra {{in relation to}} its adjacent vertebra in association with an intact neural arch, and {{in the presence of}} degenerative changes is known as degenerative <b>spondylolisthesis.</b> Degenerative <b>spondylolisthesis</b> narrows the spinal canal and symptoms of spinal stenosis are common. Of these, neural claudication is most common. Any forward slipping of one vertebra on another can cause spinal stenosis by narrowing the canal. If this forward slipping narrows the canal sufficiently, and impinges on the contents of the spinal column, it is spinal stenosis by definition. If there are associated symptoms of narrowing, the diagnosis of spinal stenosis is confirmed. With increasing age, the occurrence of degenerative <b>spondylolisthesis</b> becomes more common. The most common <b>spondylolisthesis</b> occurs with slipping of L4 on L5. Frymoyer showed that <b>spondylolisthesis</b> with canal stenosis is more common in diabetic women who have undergone oophorectomy (removal of ovaries). The cause of symptoms in the legs can be difficult to determine. A peripheral neuropathy secondary to diabetes can have the same symptoms as spinal stenosis.|$|E
