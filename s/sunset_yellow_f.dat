40|$|Abstract: The {{influence}} of a permitted <b>yellow</b> food colour, <b>Sunset</b> <b>yellow</b> –FCF on root tips of Allium sativum was investigated {{with a view to}} ascertaining its mitodepressive effect. Root tips of Allium sativum were treated with five concentrations of <b>Sunset</b> <b>yellow</b> like 100 ppm, 250 ppm, 500 ppm, 750 ppm and 1000 ppm and with distilled water as control. The time of action of the respective concentration of solutions were 2 hrs, 4 hrs and 6 hrs. Exposure to different concentrations of <b>Sunset</b> <b>yellow</b> showed an inhibitory effect on cell division of Allium sativum root tips. It caused a general decline in mitotic index value. <b>Sunset</b> <b>yellow</b> diminishes the mitotic index in correlation with the increased concentration and duration of treatment.

40|$|AbstractThis study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} the biochemical influence of broccoli and beet extracts on selected individual additives NaNO 2 or <b>sunset</b> <b>yellow</b> treated rats, {{in addition to the}} gene expression of some antioxidant enzymes. Forty-two male rats were assigned to seven groups of six rats in each group. The control group was fed a diet without an additive for four weeks. Group (2) received NaNO 2, groups (3) received NaNO 2 co-administered with broccoli extract (4) NaNO 2 co-administered with beet extracts, Group (5) received <b>sunset</b> <b>yellow,</b> Group (6) received <b>sunset</b> <b>yellow</b> co-administered with broccoli extract, and Group (7) received <b>sunset</b> <b>yellow</b> co-administered with beet extract, for four weeks. At the end of the experiment, blood, liver, kidney, and brain samples were taken for biochemical and/or molecular analysis. The mRNA expression of antioxidant enzymes was determined by reversing transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The obtained results revealed that rats co-administered with beet or broccoli extracts had a significant decrease in serum levels of AST, ALT, ALP, urea, total lipids, and triglycerides, as well as a significant increase in reduced glutathione (GSH), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-px), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) enzyme activities, compared to the normal control group. Oral administration of NaNO 2 or <b>sunset</b> <b>yellow</b> caused a significant increase in serum levels of AST, ALT, ALP, urea, total lipids, and triglycerides, as well as a significant decrease in GSH, GSH-px, and SOD compared to the positive group. In conclusion, this study showed that broccoli and beet extracts have a protective effect against NaNO 2 or <b>sunset</b> <b>yellow</b> in rat treated groups...|$|R

Dietary exposure to synthetic colours was estimated using food-frequency questionnaire data obtained from 142 primary school children aged 8 - 9 years in three districts of Hong Kong. Dietary exposure to synthetic colours for an average primary school student was considerably lower than the threshold for acceptable daily intake (ADI) for their ages, except for <b>sunset</b> <b>yellow</b> FCF. Data obtained showed that the average daily intake of <b>sunset</b> <b>yellow</b> FCF (E 110) was 51 % over the ADI threshold in 9 -year-old boys.

40|$|In this work, {{competitive}} adsorption of four food dyes (<b>Sunset</b> <b>Yellow,</b> Allura Red, tartrazine, and Brilliant Black) by heated pine wood is studied using multivariate calibration. Partial {{least squares}} PLS 1 and principal component regression PCR are effectively applied for simultaneous determination of food dyes with high accuracy (96. 2 – 103. 6 %) and low relative prediction error (2. 3 – 6. 9 %). Using multivariate calibration, the dyes are detected down to 0. 11, 0. 15, 0. 24, and 0. 29 mg L− 1. The removal of dyes increased at acidic solution and H-bonding {{is the main}} controlling mechanism. The maximum removal capacities (according to Langmuir model) are 3. 4, 2. 5, 4. 8, and 7. 1 mg g− 1 for tartrazine, Brilliant Black, Allura Red, and <b>Sunset</b> <b>Yellow,</b> respectively, at pH 2. 0 and 25 °C.

40|$|The azo dye, <b>sunset</b> <b>yellow,</b> is a prototypical, chromonic {{liquid crystal}} in which {{assembly}} {{in aqueous solution}} at high volume fraction leads to lyotropic mesophases with a “package of properties distinct in almost every aspect” (Lydon, J. Curr. Opin. Colloid Interface Sci. 2004, 8, 480). In particular, the isotropic to nematic transition in such phases, the consequence of stacking of dye molecules in chains, is difficult to bring into correspondence with athermal theories for rigid rods as well as modifications that consider chain interactions with one another. Chromonic mesogens, small molecules that stack to form lyotropic liquid crystals, prompt structural questions {{that have yet to}} be answered; a full understanding of structure should inform colligative properties. Herein, the single crystal structure of a guanidinium salt of the <b>sunset</b> <b>yellow</b> dianion, a known chromonic mesogen, is reported. The compound crystallizes as a dihydrate, tetrahydrofuran solvate in the orthorhombic space group Pnna, with a = 6. 8426 (5) Å, b = 20. 048 (1) Å, c = 21. 466 (2) Å. The <b>sunset</b> <b>yellow</b> molecules, point group approximately Cs, are disordered about a crystallographic diad axis. The structure is informative because pairwise interactions in the disordered crystal structure show a remarkable correspondence with the stereochemistry of <b>sunset</b> <b>yellow</b> molecules in solution and in the liquid crystal phase. The solution structure is here simulated by the combination of molecular dynamics,metadynamics, and quantum chemical computations. The comparable disorder in the fluid and solid states suggests the possibility that stacked aggregates adhere to growing crystals intact. Computations were used to evaluate proposals that stacking faults and branching points lower the X-ray correlation lengths while preserving extended structures. Evidence is found forstacking faults but not branches. The solution stereochemistry and stereodynamics has implications for the geometry of long rods, for which understanding is a prerequisite for reckoning properties of vexing chromonic mesophases...|$|R
