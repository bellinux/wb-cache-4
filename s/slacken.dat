5|$|The {{first session}} on Thursday began in heavy rain. Although some cars {{attempted}} {{to carry out}} wet weather testing, the conditions forced all the teams back to their garages. Once the rain began to <b>slacken</b> off cars returned to the track, but the rain continued throughout the entire session. No one was able to improve on their qualifying times from the previous day.|$|E
5|$|China's power {{began to}} decline in the 16th century when the rulers of the {{subsequent}} Ming Dynastyneglected the importance of China's trade from sea power. The Ming rulers let China's naval dominance and its grip on the Spice trade <b>slacken,</b> and the European powers stepped in. Portugal, with its technological advances in naval architecture, weaponry, seamanship and navigation, took over the Spice Trade and subdued China's navy. With this, European Imperialism {{and the age of}} European Hegemony was beginning, although China still retained power of many of its areas of trade.|$|E
5|$|Sturdee {{attempted}} {{to widen the}} distance by turning two points to the north to prevent Spee from closing to {{within the range of}} his numerous secondary guns. Spee counteracted this maneuver by turning rapidly to the south, which forced Sturdee to turn south as well to keep within range. This allowed Scharnhorst and Gneisenau to turn back north and get close enough to engage with their secondary 15cm guns. Their shooting was so accurate that it forced the British to haul away a second time. After resuming the battle, the British gunfire became more accurate; Scharnhorst was hit several times and fires broke out. The pace of her gunfire started to <b>slacken,</b> though she continued to score hits on Invincible. Sturdee then turned to port in an attempt to take the leeward position, but Spee countered the turn to retain his favorable position; the maneuvering did, however, reverse the order of the ships, so Scharnhorst now engaged Inflexible.|$|E
40|$|Artículos en revistasThis {{article is}} {{concerned}} with the effect of cable <b>slackening</b> on stiffness computation of railway overheads. A previous model based on the catenary equation serves as the basis to include cable <b>slackening.</b> The influence of cable <b>slackening</b> is highlighted by comparing both models. A discussion of the comparison between the cable <b>slackening</b> model and traditional finite element formulations is presented. Although the method presented is applied to railway overheads, this methodology can be easily applied to general vertical cable nets. The proposed method shows good agreement with finite element results and the computational time is greatly reduced. The main influence of cable <b>slackening</b> is the smoothing of stiffness distribution at the local vicinity of the <b>slackening</b> dropper and consequently reducing the average stiffness of the railway overhead. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R

The cattle kraal came under renewed assault and was evacuated by 10:00 pm, leaving the remaining men in a small bastion around the storehouse. Throughout the night, the Zulus kept up a constant assault against the British positions; Zulu attacks only began to <b>slacken</b> after midnight, and they finally ended by 2:00 am, being replaced by a constant harassing fire from Zulu firearms until 4:00 am.|$|E
25|$|While Dessaix and Wolfskeel battled, Grouchy {{sent the}} {{divisions}} of Pully and Sahuc across the Piave at San Nichiol. The troopers encountered Kalnássy's IX Armeekorps brigade {{in the open}} and hustled the Austrians back to Cimadolmo and San Michele, where they took up a strong defensive position. Guérin d'Etoquigny's division crossed around 9:00 AM, allowing the other two divisions {{to move to the}} left in support of Dessaix. By this time, the French artillery fire began to <b>slacken.</b> In their haste to help Dessaix, the French gunners had left their reserve ammunition behind.|$|E
25|$|The H.F. Bailey crossed Leman Bank {{and reached}} the Mount Ida around 1230 hrs. By this time the ship's {{starboard}} lifeboat had been carried away, she was listing heavily to starboard and lying head on to the seas, and her position offered no lee for the lifeboat to come alongside. The H.F. Bailey made an attempt to throw a line to the stricken vessel but was twice struck by the heavy seas and flung back. Coxswain Blogg made another attempt to come alongside, before deciding {{that it was too}} dangerous and {{that he would have to}} wait for the sea to <b>slacken.</b>|$|E

25|$|About this time, the Light Cavalry Brigade of Colonel Makwitz, had {{completed}} his manoeuvre from the left, reached the right flank, and was formed {{up in two}} lines: also the four Battalions that had been detached from the 6th Brigade (General Krafft's), arrived upon the right of Saint-Amand-la-Haye, and came into action. The battle on both sides on {{this part of the}} Field continued to rage with unabated violence and with such indefatigable ardour did the Prussians continue the struggle, that when the fire of their skirmishers was observed to <b>slacken,</b> from the men having expended their ammunition, the soldiers of the 11th Hussars rushed into the midst of them, and supplied them with such cartridges as they had of their own; an act of devotion to which many of them fell a sacrifice.|$|E
25|$|At {{one point}} in the 19th century, Stanley became one of the world's busiest ports. However, the ship-repair trade began to <b>slacken</b> off in 1876 with the {{establishment}} of the Plimsoll line, which saw the elimination of the so-called coffin ships and unseaworthy vessels that might otherwise have ended up in Stanley for repair. With the introduction of increasingly reliable iron steamships in the 1890s the trade declined further and was no longer viable following the opening of the Panama Canal in 1914. Port Stanley continued to be a busy port supporting whaling and sealing activities {{in the early part of}} the 20th century, British warships (and garrisons) in the First and Second World War and the fishing and cruise ship industries in the latter half of the century.|$|E
25|$|BMW {{said the}} flexible, {{stretchable}} water resistant translucent man-made fabric skin– polyurethane-coated Spandex, is resilient and durable. It resists {{high or low}} temperatures, does not swell or shrink and the movement does not <b>slacken</b> or damage the fabric. The body changes its shape according to exterior conditions and speeds, and it also allows the driver to change its shape at will. The fabric is stretched over a moveable frame; essential shapes are formed beneath the skin by an aluminium wire structure, though at points where movement is needed (ducts, door openings, spoiler) flexible carbon struts are used. The shape of the frame is controlled by many electric and hydraulic actuators; for example, the headlights are revealed when small motors pull the fabric back in an eyelid like fashion. As the fabric is translucent the taillights shine through it.|$|E

500|$|Kriegsmarine Commander of Submarines (...) Karl Dönitz {{devised a}} plan to attack Scapa Flow by {{submarine}} {{within days of the}} outbreak of war. Its goal would be twofold: first, that displacing the Home Fleet from Scapa Flow would <b>slacken</b> the British North Sea blockade and grant Germany greater freedom to attack the Atlantic convoys; second, the blow would be a symbolic act of vengeance, striking at the same location where the German High Seas Fleet had surrendered and scuttled itself following Germany's defeat in the First World War. Dönitz hand-picked Kapitänleutnant Günther Prien for the task, scheduling the raid for the night of 13/14 October 1939, when the tides would be high and the night moonless.|$|E

500|$|The {{garrison}} of Badajoz, ably {{commanded by}} Gen. Rafael Menacho, initially put up strong resistance and by 3 March the French had made little progress against the powerful fortress. On that day, however, Menacho {{was killed on}} the ramparts by a chance shot; command of the garrison fell to Brig. Gen. José Imaz and the Spanish defense started to <b>slacken.</b> [...] The walls were finally breached on 10 March. Soult was anxious to press the siege since he had learned that Masséna, in command of a disintegrating army plagued by sickness, starvation and an unusually harsh Portuguese winter, had retreated from Portugal. Concerned that the British would now be free to send a contingent to relieve Badajoz, Soult sent a deputation into the town to demand the garrison's surrender. Imaz duly capitulated and the French took possession of the fortress on 11 March.|$|E
500|$|Two {{thirds of}} the [...] were to fire a {{creeping}} barrage of shrapnel immediately ahead of the advance, while {{the remainder of the}} field guns and [...] howitzers were to fire a standing barrage, [...] further ahead on German positions and lift to the next target, when the infantry came within [...] of the barrage. Each division was given four extra batteries of field artillery, which could be withdrawn from the barrage at the divisional commander's discretion to engage local targets. The field batteries of the three reserve divisions were placed in camouflaged positions, close to the British front line. As each objective was taken by the infantry, the creeping barrage was to pause [...] ahead and become a standing barrage, while the infantry consolidated. During this time the pace of fire was to <b>slacken</b> to one round per-gun per-minute, allowing the gun-crews a respite, before resuming full intensity as the barrage moved on. The heavy and super-heavy artillery was to fire on German artillery positions and rear areas and [...] were to fire a barrage {{over the heads of the}} advancing troops.|$|E
500|$|However, {{whether this}} {{regionalisation}} of the legions was partnered by {{a drop in}} the professionalism of the troops is contested. Antonio Santosuosso argues that the strict discipline and high motivation of the days of Marius had lapsed, but Andrew Alfoldi states that the Illyrian troops were both valiant and warlike, and Tacitus described German recruits as being natural mercenaries (Latin: vivi ad arma nati). It seems that discipline in the legions did <b>slacken,</b> with soldiers granted permission to live with wives outside of military lodgings and permitted to adopt a more lavish and comfortable lifestyle, in contrast to the strict military regimen of earlier years. However, {{it is by no means}} certain that this led to any reduction in the effectiveness of the legions, due to the greater ferocity and stature of the barbari recruits. [...] The flavour of the Roman military, however, was now dictated by the increasing number of regional recruits, leading to a partial barbarisation of Rome's military forces beginning in this period. The barbarisation of the lower ranks was paralleled by a concurrent barbarisation of its command structure, with the Roman senators who had traditionally provided its commanders becoming entirely excluded from the army. By 235AD the Emperor himself, the figurehead of the entire military, was a man born outside of Italy to non-Italian parents.|$|E
