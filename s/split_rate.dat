We find that <b>split</b> <b>rated</b> bonds average a 7 -basis-point yield premium over nonsplit rated bonds of similar credit risk. The yield premium increases from 5 basis points for one-notch splits to 15 (20) basis points for two-notch (three-notch) splits. These findings indicate that investors demand higher yields for <b>split</b> <b>rated</b> bonds {{to compensate for the}} information opacity of such bonds. In addition, the yield premium for <b>split</b> <b>rated</b> bonds is higher during economic recessions, indicating investors are more risk averse during economic downturns.

40|$|Economic theory {{suggests}} that switching from a general property tax to a split-rate tax increases land use efficiency and stimulates urban core development while preserving the environment and reducing urban sprawl. Under split-rate property taxation, land is typically taxed at a significantly higher rate than improvements. Beginning in 1965 Hawaii experimented with a statewide split-rate property tax system to encourage economic growth and effect land reform. The experiment was ended in 1977. Following the transfer of property taxing powers to the counties in 1978, some counties brought back the split-rate property tax at times. Since 2006, Kauai County has adopted the unusual practice of taxing improvements {{at a higher rate}} than land for most property classes.

40|$|The {{majority}} of {{experts agree that}} taxes are distortionary in nature. This is relatively true {{for all of the}} different groups of taxes, but for the corporate taxes is exceptionally obvious. The existence of the corporate tax system can affect the company’s behavior in number of ways {{and one of the most}} criticized is the ability for distortion of the choice of the sources of finance. In the following article, we explore the effects from corporate taxation on investment, through the methodological frame of the effective marginal tax rates. The objective is to analyze the investment decision in the case of isolated implementation of corporate taxes which means that the effects from the so-called “double taxation”, induced by the personal taxes are not taken in consideration. We hope to prove that these conditions generate “uneven” distribution of the burden across the projects covered with different sources of finance. Also, we intend to test and explore the properties of some alternative corporate tax systems which are widely known as neutral, such as: the comprehensive business income tax system (CBIT), the imputation corporate tax system (ICT), the full imputation corporate tax system (FICT), the allowance for corporate equity tax system (ACE) and the <b>split</b> <b>rate</b> corporate tax system (SRCT).

The model evolves via non–linear particle splitting, with a non–local <b>splitting</b> <b>rate</b> which is constrained by boost–invariance and multiple scattering. The <b>splitting</b> <b>rate</b> saturates at high density, so like the gluon emission rate in the JIMWLK evolution. In the mean field approximation obtained by ignoring fluctuations, the model exhibits the hallmarks of the BK equation, namely a BFKL–like evolution at low density, the formation of a traveling wave, and geometric scaling. In the full evolution including fluctuations, the geometric scaling is washed out at high energy and replaced by diffusive scaling. It is likely that the model belongs to the universality class of the reaction–diffusion process. The analysis of the model sheds new light on the Pomeron loops equations in QCD and their possible improvements. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the relationships between}} split ratings and ratings migration. We find that bonds with split ratings {{are more likely to}} have future rating changes. A one-notch (more-than-one-notch) <b>split</b> <b>rating</b> increases the probability of rating change within one year of initial issuance by about 3 % (6 %). Furthermore, we find that about 30 % of <b>split</b> <b>rated</b> bonds have their two ratings converge after four years of initial issuance. The rating convergence tapers off after three years, and the rating agency with a higher (lower) initial rating generally maintains a higher (lower) rating in subsequent years if the two ratings do not converge. We also show that rating transition estimation can be improved by taking into consideration split ratings. We find that one-year rating transition matrices are significantly different between non-letter-split rated bonds and letter-split rated bonds, and we show that the difference has an economically significant impact on the pricing of credit spread options and VaR-based risk management models. Overall, our results suggest that split ratings contain important information about subsequent rating changes. ...|$|R

The modification was made by casting a thin film of a Nafion-type material {{on the surface of}} cation-exchange membrane, and by processing with a strong polyelectrolyte the surface of anion-exchange membrane.

The effect of mass transfer growth is explained by higher surface hydrophobicity of the modified membrane that enhances electroconvection. The decrease in water <b>splitting</b> <b>rate</b> in the case of cation-exchange membrane is due to homogenization of its surface layer. In the case of anion-exchange membrane the effect is due to grafting of quaternary ammonium bases onto the original membrane surface layer.

A seller may market a house by direct negotiations with buyers, without the intermediation of real estate brokers, or by listing {{the house with a}} broker.

We conclude that the competitive pressure of direct negotiations between sellers and buyers, relative free entry of brokers and the inappropri-ateness of the cartel hypothesis cast serious doubt about a general consensus of opinion that the brokerage system is characterized by price fixing, excessive commissions and excessive marketing costs.

40|$|Abstract—Csiszár and Körner’s {{characterization}} of the rateequivocation region of a general wiretap channel involves two auxiliary random variables: U, which represents <b>rate</b> <b>splitting</b> and V, which represents channel prefixing. For some channels, {{one or both of}} these auxiliary random variables are unnecessary, simplifying the expression and evaluation of the rate-equivocation region. In this paper, we provide new conditions under which channel prefixing or <b>rate</b> <b>splitting</b> does not improve the rateequivocation region. In particular, we show that when the main channel is more capable than the eavesdropping channel, channel prefixing is unnecessary; the entire rate-equivocation region can be achieved by <b>rate</b> <b>splitting</b> alone. Conversely, we show under a mild assumption that if the main receiver is not more capable, then channel prefixing is strictly necessary. Moreover, we show that if the main channel is more capable but not less noisy, then <b>rate</b> <b>splitting</b> is strictly necessary. Next, we focus on the set of cyclic shift symmetric channels. We prove that for these channels, if in addition I(X; Y) − I(X; Z) is maximized at the uniform distribution, then <b>rate</b> <b>splitting</b> is unnecessary.
