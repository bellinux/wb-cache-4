40|$|Four {{groups of}} field {{experiments}} including foliage dressing {{with a regular}} amount of rare earth elements (REEs), <b>soil</b> <b>dressing</b> with a regular amount of REEs, <b>soil</b> <b>dressing</b> with a triple regular amount of REEs and the control were carried out in Panggezhuang Village, Daxing County, Beijing, where REE fertilizers are widely applied. The input and output fluxes {{of all kinds of}} REEs in the soil and plant system were measured using ICP-MS. The results show that the total amount of REEs carried by rain, snow, irrigation water, composite fertilizer and dust is at a very low level in the control field, which is only about 19. 3 g center dot nm(- 1) per year. The amounts of REE input in the fields with application of extraneous REEs are much higher than that under control. The total amounts of REE input in the fields with foliage <b>dressing</b> and <b>soil</b> <b>dressing</b> are 9. 7 and 106 times higher than that under control, respectively. However, the total outputs of REEs via wheat and infiltrated water are quite similar among the four experimental fields. Uptake of wheat is the main way of output and concentrations of REEs in different organs follow a descending order of roots > leaves > stems > crusts > seeds. Based on calculation, the amount of REE output is slightly higher than that of input in the control field, which implies that it is hard for REEs to accumulate in the soils without application of REE fertilizers. In the fields with the application of extraneous REEs, the amount of REEs in soils can increase with the increasing input of REEs. If REE-fertilizers are applied regularly via <b>soil</b> <b>dressing</b> with the ordinary amount, the concentrations of REEs in the surface soils may double in 159 years. The speed of REE accumulation with foliage dressing is much lower than that with <b>soil</b> <b>dressing,</b> and it needs 2008 years to double the concentrations of REEs in surface soils...|$|R

The experimental design was a randomized split blocks one with four levels of <b>soil</b> <b>dressing</b> and four levels of foliar fertilization, with five replications. Micronutrient <b>soil</b> <b>dressing</b> was studied as FTE- 12 at doses of 0, 60, 120 and 180 kg ha- 1. The four levels of foliar fertilization were: LF 0 (without fertilizer), LF 1 (15 leaf fertilization, using the amount of 1158. 75 g Fe ha- 1, 844. 65 g Mn ha- 1, 391. 5 g ha- 1 Zn, 322. 65 g ha- 1 Cu and 216 g ha- 1 B), LF 2 (15 leaf fertilization, using twice the quantities of level LF 1) and LF 3 (15 leaf fertilization, using three times the amount of level LF 1). At 13 months after planting the micropropagated plantlets was carried out the floral induction treatment and five months later the fruit harvest determining the following variables: fruit weight and median diameter, soluble solids content (SS) and titratable acidity (TA). Both fruit weight and diameter increased with increasing doses of micronutrients applied to the soil and to the leaves, of plants grown both on bagana soil cover and plastic mulch. On the other hand fruit pulp quality was little affected by the treatments studied. There were a small increase of SS contents for plants grown on bagana soil cover and a small decrease of titratable acidity for those grown on plastic mulch, in both cases just in response to micronutrient foliar application...|$|R

Those models were consisted of stratified soil layers and two different percolation systems (open and closed system percolation) and operated by 12. 5 cm (M- 1 to M- 6), 15 cm (M- 7 to M- 8) and 20 cm (M- 9 to M- 10) <b>soil</b> <b>dressing</b> with stratifled polluted paddy fields. The stratifled paddy field models were constructed in an iron box (30 x 50 x 70 cm) with three layers of soil; those were plow layer(layer I; 0 - 12. 5 cm), plowsole (layer II; 12. 5 - 22. 5 cm), and subsoil(layer III, 22. 5 - 65 cm) and constructed with Andosol or alluvial(layer I),Cd-polluted soil or Cd-polluted soil with alluvial (layer II) and gravel or Cd-polluted soil with gravel(III layer). In open system percolation models was planed in plowsole and subsoil but in the closed system percolation models, soil layers were planed under saturated condidon. The two percolation systems were applied to paddy field models by controlling the ground water level at 57. 5 cm and 12. 5 cm for the open system and closed system model, espectively, usinga subsurface drainage pipe. In open system percolation, the pressure head of the plowsole and subsoil were negative but inclosed system showed positive pressure. In the open system percolation models, plowsole and subsoil temperature almost similar to the air temperature but in closed system percolation models were higher than the air temperature. The soil redox(Eh) value in plow layer of both percolations was about- 190 mV. But in the plowsole and subsoil were in oxidative condition(650 mV) in open system percolation models. On the other hand, in the plowsole and subsoil were in reducdon state(- 200 mV) in closed system percolation models. The average SPAD values in closed system percolation models were lower than the open system percolation models. In the harvesting period, the 14 th leaf was dry about 78 % in closed system percolation but 43 % in open system percolation models; this result indicated that the difference of photosynthesis ability of rice plants in two systems during ripening time. Moreover, the plant length, number of stem, number and weight of pamicles, number and weight of grains were lower in open system percolation models than the closed system percolation models. Accumuladon of cadmium in roots of each soil layer, stem and leaves and rice grain were higher in open system percolation than the closed system percolation models.

40|$|Among the {{research}} {{on the history of}} Chinese agriculture in Japan, the previous research on paddy field cultivation utilized "hard-work" and "heavy-fertilizing" as analytical indicators. There is a problem with such cultivation that the amount of energy invested is large, while that of energy generated from the production is small. In order to comprehensively examine the overall picture of paddy field cultivation, it is effective to analyze it from a "soil fertility" perspective. This {{is a good example of}} effective research, because an improvement of soil fertility is not synonymous with an increase in fertilizer application. Although oil cakes were common as fertilizer by the middle of the Qing Period, and it was an age when "heavy-fertilizing" was just beginning. The application of fertilizer dependent on oil cakes can cause physiological disorders of various kinds. To solve this problem, the application of combustion ash had been considered to be effective. However, compared to the supply of oil cakes, that of combustion ash was not sufficient. Therefore, determining whether the increase in application of oil cakes led to an improvement of soil fertility remains a matter to reconsider. In Pre-modern China, there were some other methods that were considered effective to improve soil fertility, such as winter flooded paddy fields, <b>soil</b> <b>dressing</b> and paddy-upland rotation fields, etc [...] However, when viewed from the modern agricultural perspective, some of them are regarded as illogical.

The environmental fate of tylosin (TYL) and oxytetracycline (OTC) orally administered for five days to 40 calves (20 mg/kg and 60 mg/kg, respectively) was monitored for 6 months in manure, in soil and in surface water. TYL showed a rapid degradation, falling below the limit of quantification after 45 days. For OTC drug half-life in manure was calculated (T 1 / 2 el= 30 days); only traces (lower than the limit of detection, 10 ppb) were found in soil and ground water. Ten ppb is the Safety Limit recommended by the EMEA [2] for drug residues in soil.

40|$|In organic farming, plant {{production}} depends {{almost exclusively on}} nutrient deriving from the decomposition of exogenous organic matter in soil which is able to provide significant quantities of several important nutrients for the plant growth. However, in the soil the timing and amount of mineralization often does not coincide with crop nutritional need, making in-season fertilization necessary.

Short-term open field experiment was conducted at the Mediterranean Agronomic Institute of Bari (MAIB) located in Apulia region (Southern Italy) in order study the effects of different fertilization scenarios based on equilibrated nutritional requirement on tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill, cv.

In <b>soil</b> <b>dressing</b> phase, three months before planting, biochar (BCH), organic fertilizers (OF), combined treatment (BCH+OF), cattle manure and vineyard wood compost (MVC), dairy wastes industry and vineyard wood compost (DVC) and unamended soil as control (CON) were established. In the pre-crop phase, organic and/or mineral fertilizers were incorporated into the previous treatments except CON and BCH in order to achieve balanced N, P and K application rates for tomato plants. Different fertilization scenarios significantly increased the yields over CON and BCH treatments, maintaining fruits quality. In short period of time, most of the soil parameters remained invariable, only available phosphorus significantly increased in the treatments which received organic fertilizers maybe due to the slight reduction in soil pH.

40|$|The {{development}} of low-input farming systems requires {{knowledge of the}} extent to which management characteristics influence the soil as a habitat for micro-organisms and a medium for plant growth. This paper presents a study of long-term effects of organically and conventionally cultivated systems on a range of soil physical, chemical and biological characteristics in Denmark. Seven soils were included, falling into three groups (I¯III). Each group consists of an organically managed soil (Org) referenced by one or two conventionally managed soils (Conv) with the same soil type (sandy loam) and pedological history. All organically managed soils were dairy farm soils (H), which had been organically managed for 46, 47 and 40 years, respectively. They had forage crop rotations and received animal manure. The conventional soils were either dairy farm soils or soils grown to annual cash crops (P). Undisturbed core samples were used for assessing dry bulk density and water retention. Undisturbed cubic samples were used for assessing wet stability of macro-aggregates, clay dispersibility, microbial biomass C, -glucosidase activity, ergosterol, and the abundance of different groups of fungi. Penetration resistance and ease of soil fragmentation were measured in the field. The quantifying methods were supplemented by a visual inspection of soil structure of the top 30 cm soil in the field. Irrespective of agricultural system, the use of tractors and heavy machinery had caused compaction of the subsoil in the form of a dense pan below ploughing depth. In group I, the H-soils were heavily trafficked and this overshadowed the long-term effects of the diversified crop rotations and animal manure applications on the physical parameters. Generally, the results highlight the paramount influence of soil tillage and traffic in agriculture. Further, the results confirm the positive effects of organic manures and diversified crop rotations on soil quality aspects. Microbial biomass C was found to be higher in organically than in conventionally managed dairy farm soils, and appeared to correlate linearly to the volume of 0. 2 ¯ 3. 0 m pores (`protective' pore space). The simple model did, however, not explain a lower microbial biomass for two <b>soils</b> <b>dressed</b> only with synthetic fertilisers. The results further indicated that the contribution of the different biotic mechanisms responsible for macro-aggregation varied from soil to soil. The results revealed promising correlations between quantitative scientific laboratory methods and descriptive methods in the field...|$|R

He repeated to himself that he must fly, but the heaviness in his limbs chained him to her side; he had no will, no strength; he was a reed, bending to every word she spoke and to every look. Her fascination was not human, the calm, voluptuous look of her eyes was too cruel; and she was poised like a serpent about to spring.|$|R
40|$|Many {{problems}} remain unsolved as {{to sandy}} soils which show different physical and mechanical properties of their own. It {{is known that}} the physical and mechanical properties of sandy soils are considerably {{different from those of}} clay soils. This study was practised to obtain fundamental data on the improvement of sandy soils. The authors investigated the coefficient of water permeability, pF-soil moisture characteristic, removing of fine particles from the soil sample during percolation and the changes of consistency limit of sandy <b>soils</b> with clay <b>dressing</b> under laboratory condition. The conclusions obtained are summarized as follows; 1. In the permeability test, the coefficient of water permeability of sandy <b>soils</b> with clay <b>dressing</b> decreased with increasing in clay content and the decreasing ratio of the coefficient is larger in a state of lower clay content. 2. The coefficient of removing fine particles from the soil sample during percolation decreased with increasing of clay content and the decreasing ratio of the coefficient is large in a state of lower clay content. Moreover, the supressing effect on the removing fine particles from the soil sample during percolation becomes very large by adding silt fractions to the soil sample. 3. The flow curves and the flow index increased when content of clay in soil sample was increased. When content of clay in soil sample is under about 30 per cent, the soil sample is nonplastic and we cannot obtain the properties above mentioned. 砂粒子のような粗粒分が主要構成分となっている砂質土は粘質土とは多くの点で相違がある. 砂質上の改良には, 粘土のような細粒分を客土することが一般に考えられることであるが, 実際にはそれほど単純ではない. すなわち. 施工時の水分状態, 原土および客入土の粒度組成, 原土の構造性並びに締固めエネルギーの大きさなど施工条件によって改良効果に大きな差が生じる. こうした現状を踏まえて, 本報では, 透水試験, 細粒分の洗脱試験およびコンシステンシー測定など, 混合系の基本的問題について検討した. 得られた結果は以下のとおりである. 1. 透水試験においては, 混合試料中の粘土含有率の小さい段階で透水抑制作用に著しい効果がみられる. 2. 細粒分の洗脱試験では, 粘土含有率が増えるにしたがって洗脱率は減少するが, 減少の度合は粘土含有率の小さい初期の段階で大きい. また, シルト分の混入による洗脱抑制効果はかなり大きい. 3. 砂・粘土混合試料のコンシステンシーについては, 粘土含有率が増えるにしたがって流動曲線は上昇し, 流動指数は増大するが, 粘土含有率が 30 %以下では非塑性状態を呈するため, こうした関係を求めることが困難である...|$|R
40|$|In {{field trials}} on soils of known copper status, plots of oats and "barley were given foliar and seedbed copper treatments, and in {{factorial}} pot experiments, oats {{under various conditions}} of water supply and illumination were also grown on deficient and treated soil. The following conclusions were made {{from the results of}} observations and experiments. In fields on a few farms in South East Scotland, copper deficiency is lowering cereal yields and sometimes causing withertip. The soils in these fields are in the Eckford or Hobkirk Series, and have an E. D. T. A. extractable copper level of about 0. 5 p. p. m. ^Ithertip is seen most frequently when the preceding winter is dry, but {{there appears to be no}} correlation between its occurrence and weather conditions during the growing season. Oat plants, nevertheless, generally absorb less copper from sandy soil at about 80 water capacity than from soil at 40, and the uptake in young plants may be decreased when illumination is reduced. On deficient soils, similar increases in grain yield appear to be caused by foliar treatments of 5 and 10 lb. per acre copper oxychloride, although even 0. 8 lb. is sufficient to cure withertip. Field seedbed oopper dressings are less effective at raising grain production than foliar treatments, and cause no response in straw yield. Under greenhouse conditions, on the other hand, copper treatment of deficient soil nay increase "both grain and straw yields, l?o evidence was found of copper toxicity in the field, "but a temporary reduction in the yield of young plants in pots occurred when sandy soil contained about 8 p. p. ra. applied copper The concentration of copper in "barley plants is generally higher than that in oats, although there are varietal differences in oats, "barley and wheat. The concentration is also higher in young plants than in those at maturity, and is influenced by moisture and light conditions. In the field, foliar treatments and moderate applications of copper to the seedbed have little effect on the copper level in mature plants, hut a heavy <b>soil</b> <b>dressing</b> in pots may raise the concentration in the "rain. Copper deficient oat plants contain a larger concentration of moisture than copper treated plants. Iron absorption may be reduced in young oat plants containing a high level of copper, and small copper dressings on a deficient soil may cause an increase in uptake of manganese. E. B. T. A. extraction of field soils gives a guide to the availability of copper near deficiency levels, and generally recovers 20 to 30 of foliar applications and about 50 of soil dressings for up to two years. The applied copper remains readily available to plants. The sampling date, however, influences the result of an E. D. T. A. extraction of a soil, particularly after copper treatment. The comparatively high concentration of copper in urban rain water makes copper deficiency unlikely in or near built up areas...|$|R
