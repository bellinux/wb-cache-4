50|$|From October 2002 - January 2003, {{the wing}} {{was the lead}} unit for a short notice, voluntary, out-of-cycle AEF {{deployment}} to Bagram AB, Afghanistan. Bagram had been a massive Soviet base during the decade when they occupied Afghanistan (1979-89), but was almost completely destroyed in that period and civil war afterwards. The 111th aircraft <b>supported</b> <b>joint</b> combat flight operations with US Army, Special Forces, and coalition ground forces in Afghanistan. The A-10s were flown and maintained in the most primitive conditions, yet the 111th personnel flew 100% of the assigned tasking for their entire deployment - at four times the normal sortie rate of home. Other unique aspects of the operation were total 'blacked out' night-time operations (no lights on the field or camp - everything was done by night vision goggles); an extensive number of mines/UXOs around and on the air field; extreme weather conditions and enemy shelling using BM-12 107mm rockets.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Systematic {{longitudinal}} {{observations were}} made as typically developing toddlers {{and young children}} with autism and with Down syndrome interacted with their caregivers in order to document how joint engagement developed over a year-long period and how variations in joint engagement experiences predicted language outcome. Children with autism displayed a persistent deficit in coordinated joint attention; children with Down syndrome were significantly less able to infuse symbols into joint engagement. For all groups, variations in amount of sym-bol-infused <b>supported</b> <b>joint</b> engagement, a state in which the child attended to a shared object and to language but not actively to the partner, contributed to differences in expressive and receptive language outcome, over and above initial language capacity...|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} the second in a two-part series {{describing}} research sponsored by the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) to study the structural integrity of joint bars. In Part I, observations from field surveys of joint bar inspections conducted on revenue service track were presented [1]. In this paper, finite element analyses are described to examine the structural performance of rail joints under various loading and tie-ballast support conditions. The primary purpose of these analyses is to help interpret and understand the observations from the field surveys. Moreover, the finite element analyses described in this paper are applied to conduct comparative studies and to assess the relative effect of various factors on the structural response of jointed rail to applied loads. Such factors include: discrete tie support (i. e. <b>supported</b> <b>joint</b> versus suspended joint with varying spans between effective ties), bolt pattern (four versus six bolts), initial bolt tension, and easement. In addition, results are shown for 90 lb rail joined with long-toe angle bars compared to 136 lb rail joined with standard short-toe joint bars...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Digital Image Watermarking is {{that the}} method that embeds {{knowledge}} known as a watermark or digital signature or tag or label into a transmission object such watermark may be detected or extracted later to form associate assertion regarding the ob-ject. There square measure varied techniques with that the method of watermarking may be performed. we've summarized these techniques in brief. In this work, we tend to square measure presenting few recent watermarking algorithms. One ofthem may be a sturdy digital image watermarking algorithmic program <b>supported</b> <b>Joint</b> DWT-DCT Transformation. This methodology exploits strength of 2 common frequency domains method; DCT and DWT, to get more physical property and hardiness. the thought of inserting watermark within the combined rework is predicated on {{the very fact that}} joint rework may eliminate the downside of every alternative. then, associate elective watermarking methodology may be obtained. the opposite is powerful Blind Digital Image Watermarking mistreatment DWT and twin coding Technique. This algorithmic program exploits the random sequence generated by Arnold and Chaos transformations. separate ripple transformation of third level decomposition is employed to convert the image into its frequency domain...|$|E
40|$|The most {{critical}} mechanism {{on board the}} proposed space station is the continously rotating joint which must accurately align the solar power units with the sun during earth orbit. The feasibility of a multiple, discrete bearing <b>supported</b> <b>joint</b> driven by a self-loading, pinch drive actuator was investigated for this application. This concept appears to offer greater protection against catastrophic jamming, less sensitivity to adverse thermal gradients, greater accessibility to inorbit servicing or replacement and greater adaptability to very large (5 m) truss members than to more conventional continuous support bearing/gear reducer joints. Analytical trade studies performed herein establish that a discrete cam roller bearing support system having eight hangers around a continuous ring would provide sufficient radial and bending stiffness to prevent any degradation in the fundamental frequencies of the solar wing structure. Furthermore, {{it appears that the}} pinch roller drive mechanism can be readily sized to meet or exceed system performance and service life requirements. Wear life estimates based on experimental data for a steel roller coated with an advanced polyimide film show a continuous service life more than two orders of magnitude greater than required for this application...|$|E
40|$|This study {{compared}} {{between the}} roles of the socio-pragmatic and data-driven aspects of caregiver input in the vocabulary development of both Typically Developing (TD) Children and children with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). The role of Joint Attention (JA) and <b>Supported</b> <b>Joint</b> Engagement (SJE) episode types, as well as Follow-In (FI) Comments, in the vocabulary development of TD Children and children with ASD, was investigated. The children with ASD consisted of two groups: High-Verbal (HV) and Low-Verbal (LV) children with ASD, in order to assess the effects of the different aspects of caregiver input on different initial language levels. Overall, Initiating Joint Attention (IJA), Responding to Joint Attention (RJA), Joint Attention that is Mutually established (MJA), as well as the FI utterances that were produced during these three episode types during the first three visits, significantly predicted later receptive and expressive language scores at visit 6, while utterances produced during PA, as well as utterances that were not FIs, negatively predicted later receptive and expressive language scores at visit 6. SJE measures did not predict later vocabulary scores, as shown in previous literature. The findings suggest that in these groups of children, the socio-pragmatic aspects played a larger role with LV children with ASD, whereas it played a milder role with both HV children with ASD, {{as well as with the}} TD children...|$|E
