5|$|Storm <b>surges</b> {{caused by}} extratropical {{cyclones}} {{have been recorded}} along the coastal areas. These storm <b>surges</b> are formed from strong winds that blow towards the land. They are formed due to {{the interaction between the}} semi-permanent South Pacific High and a low pressure system over the Atlantic, southeast of Argentina, creating strong winds from the south or southwest. The sudestada, which brings the worst storm <b>surges,</b> occurs when there is a high pressure system over southern Argentina in the Atlantic Ocean that interacts with a low pressure over Uruguay and southern Brazil, causing strong winds from the southeast. Storm <b>surges</b> have caused flooding of coastal areas, leading to extensive property loss and other damage. It is also the main natural factor in the erosion of coastlines. The flooding as a result of storm <b>surges</b> are particularly destructive in flat coastal areas such as the Rio de La Plata shores, and the Salado Basin.|$|E

Parts of the Outer Banks received 2–5inches (50–125mm) of rain and winds of up to 50mph (80km/h), and the Coast Guard station at Cape Hatteras reported a wind gust of 78mph (125km/h). The storm produced storm <b>surges</b> of 3– along the Outer Banks, and 1– along the southeastern coast of Virginia. These <b>surges,</b> combined with strong winds and high sea swells, resulted in minor flooding, mainly in Ocracoke and Hatteras Village, North Carolina. A weak waterspout also touched down on Silver Lake near Ocracoke and moved onshore, but only minor roof damage was reported. Sporadic power outages were also reported. One person died after suffering injuries in the high surf, and 40 other people had to be rescued from riptides and storm <b>surges.</b> Damage in the region amounted to $100,000 (2002USD).|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this master's thesis is to describe the existing <b>surge</b> tank solutions and additional improvements, and to simulate the hydraulic behavior of the <b>surge</b> tanks and how it affects the hydropower plant. The high head hydropower plant Torpa and the low head hydropower plant Åna-Sira are used for the case study, thus the <b>surge</b> tanks can be simulated under different hydraulic conditions. Turbine pressures and mass oscillations after a complete turbine shutdown, and turbine regulation parameters from operating the hydropower plant, are simulated in the LVTrans software. The result is a <b>Surge</b> Tank Atlas, where the <b>surge</b> tank solutions are described with conceptual drawings, advantages and disadvantages, and documentation from the simulations. This <b>Surge</b> Tank Atlas provides a useful tool to compare different <b>surge</b> tank solutions for both a high head and low head hydropower plant. Some of the conclusions are valid for both hydropower plants and all the <b>surge</b> tank solutions. Increasing the distance from <b>surge</b> tank to turbine, decreasing the <b>surge</b> tank volume or a strong throttling of the <b>surge</b> tank will increase the water hammer significantly, {{and to some extent}} reduce the mass oscillations. An optimal throttling of the <b>surge</b> tank will stabilize the running of the hydropower plant, reduce the <b>surge</b> tank mass oscillations and hence the necessary height and volume of the <b>surge</b> tank. Other conclusions vary between the open and the closed <b>surge</b> tank, and the high and low head hydropower plant. The closed <b>surge</b> tank shows a better dampening of the water hammer than the open <b>surge</b> tank for both hydropower plant, the closed <b>surge</b> tank can be throttled stronger than the open <b>surge</b> tanks, and the <b>surge</b> tanks at the low head hydropower plant requires more volume than for the high head plant, even though the hydraulic head is a tenth of the high head hydropower plant. Hence there are some significant differences in the hydraulic behavior between the <b>surge</b> tank solutions and the high head and the low head hydropower plant, that will be presented and discussed in the <b>Surge</b> Tank Atlas...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. A 1995 <b>surge</b> of Variegated Glacier, Alaska, USA, is {{discussed}} {{in the context of}} its six 20 thcenturypredecessors, especially the previous <b>surge</b> in 1982 / 83 which was studied in detail. The averagetime between <b>surge</b> initiations is 15 years. The 1995 <b>surge</b> was considerably weaker than itspredecessors, having a single phase or at most a very weak second phase. The 1995 <b>surge</b> confirmsthat there is a seasonal cycle, with <b>surge</b> initiation in winter and termination {{in the first part of}} the meltseason, and a correlation between weather and both <b>surge</b> termination date and <b>surge</b> extent.

40|$|<b>Surge</b> {{is a limit}} cycle {{oscillation}} in {{the pressure}} rise acid mass flow across an axial flow compressor. The generation of <b>surge</b> oscillations in axial flow compressors is investigated by a bifurcation analysis of the Moore-Greitzer model. The work reported in this paper {{is an extension of}} previous work by McCaughan which distinguished between deep <b>surge</b> and classic <b>surge.</b> In the present study, both deep <b>surge</b> and classic <b>surge</b> limit cycles are computed by using a continuation algorithm. The bifurcation mechanisms for the onset and termination of deep <b>surge</b> and classic surge: oscillations are discovered. It is found that the generation of deep <b>surge</b> is independent of the presence of classic <b>surge.</b> Classic <b>surge</b> limit cycles originate at a Hopf bifurcation and are found to terminate at a saddle loop. The occurrence of stable classic <b>surge</b> oscillations depends on the relative locations of the Hopf bifurcation point and the saddle loop. By modeling the effect of rotational disturbances at the compressor inlet as a perturbation to the compressor characteristic, it is shown that the rotational disturbance introduced by preswirl, inlet guide vanes, or air injection, can be used to manipulate the location of the bifurcation points so as to avoid stable classic <b>surge...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract: <b>Surge</b> is a {{dangerous}} instability that can occur in compressors. It is avoided using a valve that reduces the compressor pressure. The control of this valve {{is important for the}} compressor safety but it also has a direct influence on the acceleration performance. Compressor <b>surge</b> control is investigated by first studying the <b>surge</b> phenomenon in detail. Experimental data from a dynamic compressor flow test bench and <b>surge</b> cycles measured on an engine is used to tune and validate a model capable of describing <b>surge.</b> A concept named time to <b>surge</b> is introduced and a sensitivity analysis is performed to isolate the important characteristics that influence <b>surge</b> transients in an engine. It is pointed out that the controller clearly benefits from a feed-forward term due to the small time frames associated with the transition to <b>surge.</b> In the next step this knowledge is used in the design of a novel <b>surge</b> controller. This <b>surge</b> controller is then compared to two other controllers and it is shown that it avoids <b>surge</b> and improves the acceleration performance by delivering both higher engine torque and turbo shaft speed after a gear change...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: The {{purpose of}} this CHETN is to examine changes in peak <b>surge</b> {{elevation}} and wave height due {{to changes in the}} frictional resistance of a marsh. Landscape features with vegetation have the potential to reduce storm <b>surge</b> elevations and dissipate wave energy. Land elevations greater than the storm <b>surge</b> elevation act as a physical barrier and create bathymetric resistance for the <b>surge</b> and waves. Landscape features such as marshes also have the potential to create frictional resistance and affect storm <b>surge</b> and wave energy even when below the <b>surge</b> elevation. This is the third in a series of technical notes on the influence of marshes on storm <b>surge</b> and waves. The analysis in this note isolates the sensitivity of the modeled storm <b>surge</b> elevation and wave height to the magnitude of bottom friction change and indicates, in a qualita-tive sense, {{the degree to which a}} marsh density may reduce storm <b>surge</b> elevation and wave height on the coast.

The importance of centrifugal compressors for natural gas transmission is discussed, and the causes of <b>surge</b> and the consequences of current <b>surge</b> control approaches are explained. Previous technology development, including findings from early GMRC research, previous <b>surge</b> detection work, and selected publications, are presented. The project is divided into three Phases to accomplish the project objectives of verifying near <b>surge</b> sensing, developing a prototype <b>surge</b> control system (sensor and controller), and testing/demonstrating the benefits of direct <b>surge</b> control. Specification for the direct <b>surge</b> control sensor and controller developed with guidance from the industry Oversight Committee is presented in detail. Results of CFD modeling conducted to aid in interpreting the laboratory test results are shown and explained. An analysis of the system dynamics identified the data sampling and handling requirements for direct <b>surge</b> control. A detailed design process for <b>surge</b> detection probes has been developed and explained in this report and has been used to prepare drag probes for the laboratory compressor test and the first field test. The <b>surge</b> detection probes prepared for testing have been bench tested and flow tested to determine and calibrate their sensitivity to flow forces as shown in data presented in this report. The <b>surge</b> detection drag probes have been shown to perform as expected and as required to detect approaching <b>surge.</b> Laboratory test results of <b>surge</b> detection in the SwRI centrifugal compressor demonstrated functionality of the <b>surge</b> detection probes and a change in the impeller inlet flow pattern prior to <b>surge.</b> Although the recirculation cannot be detected because of the specific geometry of this compressor, there are changes that indicate the approach of <b>surge</b> that can be detected.
