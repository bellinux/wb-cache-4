40|$|During {{the past}} 2 decades, {{atherosclerosis}} and its clinical sequelae have increasingly {{been recognized as}} an inflammatory disease. Examination of multiple circulating <b>inflammatory</b> <b>biomarkers</b> has shown that they independently predict cardiovascular risk in patients with and without overt cardiovascular disease.

Statins, a class of drugs that reduce levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and <b>other</b> <b>inflammatory</b> <b>biomarkers,</b> have been the most thoroughly studied anti-inflammatory agents to reduce cardiovascular risk. However, all such trials are necessarily confounded by the ability of statins to markedly reduce cholesterol, a well-known causal risk factor for adverse vascular outcomes. Nevertheless, the provocative results of several key statin trials have provided the scientific basis to test the hypothesis that reducing inflammation will improve cardiovascular outcomes with novel and specific anti-inflammatory agents. These newer drugs promise to reduce inflammatory marker levels without affecting lipids, glucose, or blood pressure.

40|$|BACKGROUND/AIMS: Although both {{endostatin}} and cathepsins S {{have been}} associated with higher mortality, data in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) are scarce. METHODS: A longitudinal cohort study of 207 prevalent patients undergoing hemodialysis. RESULTS: Cathepsins S and L were associated with soluble receptors for tumor necrosis factor (sTNFR 1 and sTNFR 2, rho between 0. 28 and 0. 43, p < 0. 001 for all). Weaker or absent associations between endostatin, cathepsins S and L were seen with <b>other</b> <b>inflammatory</b> <b>biomarkers,</b> that is, CRP, interleukin 6, pentraxin 3, and TNF. In Cox and Laplace regression models adjusted for age, sex, dialysis vintage, and diabetes: standard deviation increments of endostatin was associated with a lower mortality (hazard ratio 0. 75, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0. 57 - 0. 98), and with 6. 8 months longer median survival.

Objective We investigated the associations between <b>inflammatory</b> <b>biomarkers</b> and future AF in a large general cohort. Methods Available markers were white blood cells (WBCs) with subgroups, fibrinogen, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), and osteoprotegerin (OPG). A total of 6315 {{men and women from}} a population survey in Tromsø, Norway in 1994 to 1995 were followed for a mean of 10. 9 years. Mean age at baseline was 60 years. Measurements of height, weight, blood pressure, heart rate, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, WBC count, and information on diabetes, angina, myocardial infarction, and antihypertensive treatment, were obtained at baseline. Fibrinogen, hs-CRP, and OPG were obtained at a follow-up visit. The outcome measure was first-ever AF, documented on an electrocardiogram. The Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to estimate hazard ratios of AF. Results In the multivariable analysis, adjusted for traditional cardiovascular risk factors and <b>other</b> <b>inflammatory</b> <b>biomarkers,</b> hs-CRP was associated with AF in men only (hazard ratio = 1. 14 for a 1 SD increase; 95 % CI, 1. 02 – 1. 28). There was a significant increase in AF across quartiles of WBCs in men (P = 0. 007) and in the total study population (P = 0. 004). OPG was associated with AF in patients free of coronary heart disease at baseline. Fibrinogen and subgroups of WBCs showed no significant association with AF. Conclusion This population-based cohort study showed that hs-CRP was independently associated with AF in men, but apparently not in women, and that patients with WBCs in the upper quartile had increased risk of AF...|$|R

Objective: Our aim was to investigate the effects of isolated soy isoflavones on <b>inflammatory</b> <b>biomarkers</b> [von Willebrand factor, intracellular adhesion molecule 1, vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM- 1), E-selectin, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1, C-reactive protein (CRP), and endothelin 1 concentrations]. Differences with respect to single-nucleotide polymorphisms in selected genes [estrogen receptor alpha (XbaI and PvuII), estrogen receptor beta [ER beta (AluI) and ER beta[cx] (Tsp 5091), endothelial nitric oxide synthase (Glu 298 Asp), apolipoprotein E (Apo E 2, E 3, and E 4), and cholesteryl ester transfer protein (TaqIB) ] and equol production were investigated. Design: One hundred seventeen healthy European postmenopausal women participated in this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover dietary intervention trial. Isoflavone-enriched (genistein-to-daidzein ratio of 2 : 1; 50 mg/d) or placebo cereal bars were consumed for 8 wk, with a washout period of 8 wk between the crossover. Plasma inflammatory factors were measured at 0 and 8 wk of each study arm. Results: Isoflavones improved CRP concentrations [odds ratio (95 % Cl) for CRP values > 1 mg/L for isoflavone compared with placebo: 0. 43 (0. 27, 0. 69) ]; no significant effects of isoflavone treatment on <b>other</b> plasma <b>inflammatory</b> markers were observed. No significant differences in the response to isoflavones were observed according to subgroups of equol production.

We assessed the effect of hormonal contraceptive use on inflammatory cytokines including CRP, monocyte chemotactic protein- 1, soluble tumor necrosis factor (sTNF), interleukin- 6 (IL- 6), and soluble CD 40 ligand. We used 79 female subjects (19 to 30 years old) who were combined oral contraceptives users (n= 29), combined vaginal contraceptive users (n= 20), and nonusers (n= 30) with CRP values of ≤ 1 (n= 46) or ≥ 3 (n= 33). Information on medical history, physical activities, and dietary and sleeping habits were collected. Both oral and vaginal contraceptive users had higher levels of CRP (P< 0. 0001), compared to nonusers. Only oral contraceptive users exhibited elevated sCD 40 L (P< 0. 01). When comparing the groups with CRP ≤ 1 and CRP ≥ 3, levels of IL- 6 and sTNF-RI were positively correlated with CRP among oral contraceptive users. We did not observe the same elevation for <b>other</b> <b>inflammatory</b> <b>biomarkers</b> for the CRP ≥ 3 group among vaginal contraceptive users.

40|$|International audienceBackground: Chronic {{inflammation}} is a {{key feature}} of colorectal cancer (CRC), meaning that <b>inflammatory</b> <b>biomarkers</b> may be useful for its diagnosis. In particular, high neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) expression {{has been reported in}} CRC. Thus, we investigated whether serum NGAL and NGAL/MMP- 9 could be potential biomarkers for the early detection of CRC. Concurrently, we studied <b>other</b> <b>inflammatory</b> <b>biomarkers</b> such as soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 and 2 (sTNFR- 1, sTNFR- 2), and C reactive protein (CRP). Methods: The AGARIC multicenter case–control study was performed in eastern France and included patients admitted for elective surgery either for a priori non-metastatic incident CRC (n[*]=[*] 224) or for benign causes (n[*]=[*] 252). Pre-operative serum levels of NGAL, NGAL/MMP- 9, sTNFR- 1, sTNFR- 2 and CRP were measured. Results: Median values of serum NGAL, NGAL/MMP- 9, sTNFR- 1, sTNFR- 2 and CRP were significantly higher in CRC patients than in controls. Receiver Operating Characteristic analysis provided relatively poor values of area under the curve, ranging from 0. 65 to 0. 58. Except for NGAL/MMP- 9, all biological parameters were strongly correlated in CRC cases and, less strongly in controls. Multivariate odds ratio (OR) of CRC comparing the extreme tertiles of serum NGAL was 2. 76 (95 % confidence interval (CI) : 1. 59 - 4. 78; p[*]<[*] 0. 001),. Lower but significant multivariate associations were observed for sTNFR- 1, and sTNFR- 2 : OR[*]=[*] 2. 44 (95 % CI : 1. 34 - 4. 45, p[*]=[*] 0. 015) and 1. 93 (95 % : CI 1. 12 - 3. 31), respectively. No independent association was found between case–control status and NGAL/MMP- 9. Among CRC cases, maximal tumor size was an independent determinant of serum NGAL (p[*]=[*] 0. 028) but this association was reduced after adjustment for CRP (p[*]=[*] 0. 11). Conclusion: Despite a significant increase in serum NGAL and <b>other</b> <b>inflammatory</b> markers among CRC patients, our findings suggest that they may not be suitable biomarkers for the diagnosis and especially early detection of CRC...|$|R

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Knowledge {{of the effect of}} nut consumption on metabolic syndrome (MetS) components is limited. We assessed the effects of nut intake on adiposity, serum lipids, insulin resistance, and <b>inflammatory</b> <b>biomarkers</b> in patients with MetS. METHODS AND RESULTS: In a randomized, parallel-group, 12 -week feeding trial, 50 patients with MetS were given recommendations for a healthy diet with or without supplementation with 30 g/day of raw nuts (15 g walnuts, 7. 5 g almonds and 7. 5 g hazelnuts) (Nut and Control diet groups, respectively). Adiposity measures, serum lipids, insulin, Homeostasis Model Assessment (HOMA), interleukin- 6 (IL- 6) and <b>other</b> <b>inflammatory</b> <b>biomarkers,</b> and 48 -h fecal fat were determined basally and at study's completion. Moderate weight loss, decreased adiposity, and lower blood pressure occurred similarly after both diets. The Control, but not the Nut diet, was associated with significant (P< 0. 05) reduction of LDL-cholesterol, with mean changes of - 0. 36 versus - 0. 13 mmol/L, respectively (between-group differences, P= 0. 154). The Nut diet reduced fasting insulin by 2. 60 μU/mL (95 % CI, - 4. 62 to - 0. 59) and HOMA-insulin resistance by 0. 72 (- 1. 28 to - 0. 16) (P< 0. 05 versus Control diet; both). Among inflammatory markers, the Nut diet resulted in changes of median plasma IL- 6 of - 1. 1 ng/L (- 2. 7 to - 0. 1; P= 0. 035 versus Control diet), but adjustment for weight loss attenuated the significance of the association. Stool fat decreased with the Control diet and slightly increased with the Nut diet (P< 0. 05 for between-group differences). CONCLUSION: Patients with MetS show decreased lipid responsiveness but improved insulin sensitivity after daily intake of 30 g of mixed nuts...|$|R
40|$|SummaryCurrent {{evidence}} supports that inflammation {{is a major}} driving force underlying the initiation of coronary plaques, their unstable progression, and eventual disruption; patients with a more pronounced vascular inflammatory response have a poorer outcome. Biomarkers are {{generally considered to be}} proteins or enzymes – measured in serum, plasma, or blood – that provide independent diagnostic and prognostic value by reflecting an underlying disease state. In the case of coronary artery disease (CAD), <b>inflammatory</b> <b>biomarkers,</b> have been extensively investigated; more evidence exists for C-reactive protein (CRP). Using high sensitivity (hs) assays, epidemiologic data demonstrate an association between hs-CRP and risk for future cardiovascular morbidity and mortality among those at high risk or with documented CAD. Moreover, a series of prospective studies provide consistent data documenting that mild elevation of baseline levels of hs-CRP among apparently healthy individuals is associated with higher long-term risk for cardiovascular events. Yet, the predictive value of hs-CRP is found to be independent of traditional cardiovascular risk factors. Recent studies suggest that, besides CRP, <b>other</b> <b>inflammatory</b> <b>biomarkers</b> such as cytokines [interleukin (IL) - 1, IL- 6, IL- 8, monocyte chemoattractant protein- 1 (MCP- 1) ], soluble CD 40 ligand, serum amyloid A (SAA), selectins (E-selectin, P-selectin), myeloperoxidase (MPO), matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), cellular adhesion molecules [intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM- 1), vascular adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM- 1) ], placental growth factor (PlGF) and A 2 phospholipases may have a potential role for the prediction of risk for developing CAD and may correlate with severity of CAD. Finally, indications suggest that the increased risk associated with inflammation may be modified with certain preventive therapies and biomarkers may help to identify the individuals who would benefit most from these interventions...|$|R

Since thrombosis and inflammation are interrelated, we evaluated the {{combination of}} soluble P-selectin (sPsel) with <b>other</b> <b>inflammatory</b> <b>biomarkers</b> for the diagnosis of DVT. Methods: Sixty-two positive and one hundred and sixteen patients with negative DVT, by duplex scan, were prospectively evaluated for sPsel, D-dimer, C-reactive protein (CRP), microparticles (MPs; total, leukocyte, and platelet-derived and tissue factor positive microparticles), and clinical Wells score. Results: Biomarkers and clinical scores that differentiated DVT positives from negatives were sPsel (87. 3 vs 53. 4 ng/mL, P <. 0001), D-dimer (5. 8 vs 2. 1 mg/ L, P <. 0001), CRP (2. 1 vs 0. 8 mg/mL, P <. 0005), andWells score (3. 2 vs 2. 0, P <. 0001). For MP analysis, platelet-derived MPs were found to differentiate DVT from negatives. Using multivariable logistic regression, a combination of sPsel and Wells score could establish the diagnosis of DVT (cut point 90 ng/mL þWells 2), with a specificity of 96 % and positive predictive value (PPV) of 100 %, and could exclude DVT diagnosis (cut point 60 ng/mL and Wells < 2) with a sensitivity of 99 %, a specificity of 33 %, and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 96 %.

The objective of this study is to analyze the prevalence of pruritus in hemodialysis patients and the possible factors implicated in its genesis. In a cross-sectional study, 101 patients on hemodialysis at our center were screened for pruritus. The relationship of various factors with pruritus was evaluated. Of the 101 patients included, 31 (30. 7 %) had pruritus at the time of examination. Patients with pruritus were significantly older than those without pruritus (P= 0. 0027). Pruritus tended to be more prevalent in patients undergoing dialysis 3 times a week than in those undergoing daily dialysis, but the difference did not reach statistical significance (P= 0. 0854). Lower transferrin saturation levels were found in patients with pruritus than in those without pruritus (P= 0. 0144). C-reactive protein levels were significantly higher in patients with pruritus than in those without pruritus (P= 0. 0013). There was no significant difference between the groups in the levels of the <b>other</b> <b>inflammatory</b> <b>biomarkers</b> measured. However, there was a tendency toward a correlation between the levels of alpha- 1 -glycoprotein and the intensity of pruritus (P= 0. 0834). Our results suggest a possible relationship of the inflammatory response upregulation to pruritus. Additionally, there was a positive relationship between pruritus and iron deficiency, possibly associated with inflammatory elevation of hepcidin. A better understanding of the factors implicated in the genesis of pruritus related to end-stage renal disease is crucial in the development of more effective treatments for this symptom...|$|R
40|$|Background: Adiponectin (APN) is a {{secretory}} protein synthesized by adipocytes {{and plays}} a potential role in regulating the inflammatory response {{by many of}} autocrine or paracrine. The mechanism of APN participation in the inflammation of COPD remains unknown. So, we investigated serum and induced sputum adiponectin as a <b>biomarker</b> of systemic <b>inflammatory</b> response and to find its relation with <b>other</b> <b>inflammatory</b> <b>biomarkers</b> like, IL- 8, IL- 6 and TNF-α. The aim of the work was also to find out {{its role in the}} pathogenesis of cachexia in COPD patients. Patients and methods: The study included 80 subjects including 60 COPD patients (20 stable and 40 exacerbated) and 20 age and sex-matched healthy control subjects. The adiponectin, interleukin- 8, interleukin- 6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha levels were measured in serum, induced sputum by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Serum CRP level was measured using the nephelometric method. Body mass index (BMI) was estimated for COPD patients and its relation to the <b>inflammatory</b> <b>biomarkers</b> was studied. Results: Adiponectin levels in COPD patients were significantly higher than those in control subjects (P <  0. 001). CRP, APN, IL- 8, IL- 6, TNF-α were significantly higher in the exacerbated COPD patients compared to the stable group (P <  0. 001, P <  0. 001, P <  0. 001, P <  0. 001 and P <  0. 001, respectively). The ratio of APN level in serum to induced sputum was (3. 1) in AECOPD patients and (2. 4) in stable COPD patients while for IL- 8, IL- 6 & TNF-α the ratios were all <(1). Conclusion: Adiponectin could play a role as a <b>biomarker</b> of systemic <b>inflammatory</b> response in COPD patients. Also, its rise in the exacerbation period denotes that this may also be a biomarker of the exacerbation phase. While IL- 8, IL- 6, TNF-α could be used to reflect the airway inflammation in induced sputum.

40|$|Background Traditionally, procalcitonin (PCT) is {{considered}} a diagnostic marker of bacterial infections. However, slightly elevated levels of PCT have also been found in patients with heart failure. In this context, {{it has been suggested}} that PCT may serve as a proxy for underrecognized infection, endotoxemia, or heightened proinflammatory activity. Nevertheless, the clinical utility of PCT in this setting is scarce. We aimed to evaluate the association between PCT and the risk of long-term outcomes. Methods and results We measured at admission PCT of 261 consecutive patients admitted for acute heart failure (AHF) after excluding active infection. Cox and negative binomial regression methods were used to evaluate the association between PCT and the risk of death and recurrent rehospitalizations, respectively. At a median follow-up of 2 years (IQR: 1. 0 – 2. 8), 108 deaths, 170 all-cause rehospitalizations and 96 AHF-rehospitalizations were registered. In an adjusted analysis, including well-established risk factors such as natriuretic peptides and indices of renal function, the logarithm of PCT was associated with a higher risk of death (HR = 1. 43, CI 95 %: 1. 12 – 1. 82; p = 0. 004), all-cause rehospitalizations (IRR = 1. 22, CI 95 % 1. 02 – 1. 44; p = 0. 025) and AHF-rehospitalizations (IRR = 1. 28, CI 95 %: 1. 02 – 1. 61; p = 0. 032). The association with these endpoints persisted after adjustment for <b>other</b> <b>inflammatory</b> <b>biomarkers</b> such as white blood cells, C-reactive protein and interleukins.

40|$|Positron {{emission}} tomography (PET) imaging with radiotracers that target translocator protein 18 [*]kDa (TSPO) {{has become a}} popular approach to assess putative neuroinflammatory processes and associated microglia activation in psychotic illnesses. It remains unclear, however, whether TSPO imaging can accurately capture low-grade inflammatory processes such as those present in schizophrenia and related disorders. Therefore, we evaluated the validity of TSPO as a disease-relevant marker of inflammation using a translational approach, which combined neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative mouse models with PET imaging in patients with recent-onset schizophrenia and matched controls. Using an infection-mediated neurodevelopmental mouse model, we show that schizophrenia-relevant behavioral abnormalities and increased inflammatory cytokine expression are associated with reduced prefrontal TSPO levels. On the other hand, TSPO was markedly upregulated in a mouse model of acute neurodegeneration and reactive gliosis, which was induced by intrahippocampal injection of kainic acid. In both models, the changes in TSPO levels were not restricted to microglia but emerged in various cell types, including microglia, astrocytes and vascular endothelial cells. Human PET imaging using the second-generation TSPO radiotracer [(11) C]DPA- 713 revealed a strong trend towards reduced TSPO binding in the middle frontal gyrus of patients with recent-onset schizophrenia, who were previously shown to display increased levels of inflammatory cytokines in peripheral and central tissues. Together, our findings challenge the common assumption that central low-grade inflammation in schizophrenia is mirrored by increased TSPO expression or ligand binding. Our study further underscores the need to interpret altered TSPO binding in schizophrenia with caution, especially when measures of TSPO are not complemented with other markers of inflammation. Unless more selective microglial markers are available for PET imaging, quantification of cytokines and <b>other</b> <b>inflammatory</b> <b>biomarkers,</b> along with their molecular signaling pathways, may be more accurate in attempts to characterize inflammatory profiles in schizophrenia and other mental disorders that lack robust reactive gliosis...|$|R
40|$|Background: Obesity and {{overweight}} {{are major}} public health problems. Various factors, such as daily nutritional habits, physical inactivity, and genetic, {{are related to}} the prevalence of obesity. Recently, it was revealed that the gut microflora may also {{play an important role in}} weight management. Thus, this study aimed to determine the anti-obesity effects of Lactobacillus casei strain Shirota (LcS) compared with those of orlistat in an animal model fed a high-fat diet (HFD). Design: Thirty-two male Sprague-Dawley rats were assigned to four groups fed various diets as follows: a standard diet group, HFD group, HFD supplemented with LcS (108109 colony-forming units (HFD-LcS) group, and HFD group treated with Orlistat (10 mg/kg body weight)). After 15 weeks, the weights of organs, body weight, body fat mass and serological biomarkers were measured. In addition, histological analysis of the liver and adipose tissue was performed. Results: Body weight, body mass index, fat mass, leptin and glucose levels were lower, and high-density lipoprotein and adiponectin levels were higher in the HFD-LcS and HFD-orlistat groups than in the HFD group. In addition a significant difference in body fat mass was observed between HFD-LcS group with HFD-orlistat group (19. 19 ± 5. 76 g vs. 30. 19 ± 7. 98 g). Although the interleukin- 6 level was significantly decreased in the HFD-LcS and HFD-orlistat groups compared with the HFD group, no significant change was observed in <b>other</b> <b>inflammatory</b> <b>biomarkers.</b> Conclusion: The results of the present study show that LcS supplementation improves body weight management and the levels of some related biomarkers. In addition, LcS supplementation showed a better result in fat mass and alanine aminotransferase reduction than Orlistat. Further studies are needed to elucidate the anti-obesity effects of LcS, with a longer period of supplementation...|$|R

SETTING: University Medical Center Utrecht. PATIENTS: Hyperandrogenic PCOS women (HA-PCOS, n = 34), normoandrogenic PCOS women (NA-PCOS, n = 34), non-PCOS reference population (n = 32), PCOS offspring (n = 14, age 6 - 8 years), and a paedriatic reference population (n = 30). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S) : Clustering profile of adipocytokines (IL- 1 b, IL- 6, IL- 13, IL- 17, IL- 18, TNF-α, adiponectin, adipsin, leptin, chemerin, resistin, RBP 4, DPP-IV/sCD 26, CCL 2 /MCP- 1), growth factors (PIGF, VEGF, sVEGF-R 1), soluble cell adhesion molecules (sICAM- 1 /sCD 54, sVCAM- 1 /sCD 106), and <b>other</b> <b>inflammatory</b> related proteases (MMP- 9, S 100 A 8, Cathepsin S). Differences in median biomarker concentrations between groups, and associations with the free androgen index (FAI; Testosterone/SHBG x 100). RESULTS: The cluster analysis identified leptin, RBP- 4, DPP-IV and adiponectin as potential discriminative markers for HA-PCOS with a specifically strong correlation in cases with increased BMI. Leptin (R 2 = 0. 219) and adiponectin (R 2 = 0. 182) showed the strongest correlation with the FAI. When comparing median protein concentrations adult PCOS women with or without hyperandrogenemia, the most profound differences were observed for leptin (P < 0. 001), DPP-IV (P = 0. 005), and adiponectin (P < 0. 001). Adjusting for age, BMI and multiple testing attenuated all differences. In PCOS offspring, MMP- 9 (P = 0. 001) and S 100 A 8 (P < 0. 001) concentrations were significantly higher compared to a healthy matched reference population, even after correcting for age and BMI and adjustment for multiple testing. CONCLUSION: In this preliminary investigation we observed significant differences in adipocytokines between women with or without hyperandrogenic PCOS and non-PCOS controls, mostly influenced by BMI. Leptin and adiponectin showed the strongest correlation with the FAI in adult women with PCOS. In PCOS offspring <b>other</b> <b>inflammatory</b> <b>biomarkers</b> (MMP- 9, S 100 A 8) were increased, suggesting that these children may exhibit increased chronic low-grade inflammation.

40|$|There {{is a lack}} of {{objective}} tools to reliably diagnose exacerbations in bronchiectasis. The primary aim {{of this study was to}} assess the ability of fluorine- 18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (18 F-FDG PET/CT) to detect sites of active inflammation in children with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) -related bronchiectasis with or without exacerbations. The secondary aim was to assess whether 18 F-FDG-PET/CT results are in agreement with local and systemic inflammatory markers and markers of HIV disease activity. Forty-one children with HIV-related bronchiectasis underwent 18 F-FDG PET/CT. Data on the presence of a clinical exacerbation were recorded. Serum was collected for CD 4 count, HIV viral load, C-reactive protein (CRP) and cytokines IL- 8, INF-γ and TNF-α. Induced sputum samples were processed for microbiological culture and for IL- 8, INF-γ and TNF-α. Mean age of all children was 8. 2 ± 2. 2 years. Twelve subjects showed 18 F-FDG lung uptake while six of them had an exacerbation. There was no difference in the 18 F-FDG uptake in participants with or without an exacerbation (P= 0. 613). Fluorine- 18 -FDG-PET had a good correlation with the presence of consolidation (P= 0. 01, OR= 6. 67). The mean CRP was higher in the subjects with 18 F-FDG uptake when compared to those without uptake (51. 96 ± 95. 12 vs. 13. 26 ± 19. 87), although this difference was not significant (P= 0. 09). In conclusion, the 18 F-FDG-PET technique could not reliably predict the presence of an exacerbation in children with HIV, and its diagnostic value was limited to identifying disease activity on the scan in acute pneumonia cases. Fluorine- 18 -FDG-PET had no significant correlation with CRP (or) with <b>other</b> <b>inflammatory</b> <b>biomarkers</b> and markers of HIV disease activity.

40|$|Interferon-γ (IFNγ) is a {{pleiotropic}} cytokine {{that plays}} an important role in many inflammatory processes, including autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS). Demyelination is a hallmark of MS and a prominent pathological feature of <b>several</b> <b>other</b> <b>inflammatory</b> diseases of the central nervous system, including experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, an animal model of MS. Accordingly, in this study we followed the effect of IFNγ in the demyelination and remyelination process by using an experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis model of demyelination/remyelination after exposure of mice to the neurotoxic agent cuprizone. We show that demyelination in response to cuprizone is delayed in mice lacking the binding chain of IFNγ receptor. In addition, IFNγR−/− mice exhibited an accelerated remyelination process after cuprizone was removed from the diet. Our results also indicate that the levels of IFNγ were able to modulate the microglia/macrophage recruitment to the demyelinating areas. Moreover, the accelerated regenerative response showed by the IFNγR−/− mice was associated with a more efficient recruitment of oligodendrocyte precursor cells in the demyelinated areas. In conclusion, this study suggests that IFNγ regulates the development and resolution of the demyelinating syndrome and may be associated with toxic effects on both mature oligodendrocytes and oligodendrocyte precursor cells...|$|R
40|$|Interface {{dermatitis}} includes {{diseases in}} which the primary pathology involves the dermo-epidermal junction. The salient histological findings include basal cell vacuolization, apoptotic keratinocytes (colloid or Civatte bodies), and obscuring of the dermo-epidermal junction by inflammatory cells. Secondary changes of the epidermis and papillary dermis along with type, distribution and density of inflammatory cells are used for the differential diagnoses of the various diseases that exhibit interface changes. Lupus erythematosus, dermatomyositis, lichen planus, graft versus host disease, erythema multiforme, fixed drug eruptions, lichen striatus, and pityriasis lichenoides are considered major interface diseases. <b>Several</b> <b>other</b> diseases (<b>inflammatory,</b> infective, and neoplastic) may show interface changes...|$|R
40|$|International audienceSeveral medical {{conditions}} sharing similar {{signs and symptoms}} {{may be related to}} immune adjuvants. These conditions described as ASIA (Autoimmune/inflammatory Syndrome Induced by Adjuvants), include a condition characterized by macrophagic myofasciitis (MMF) assessing long-term persistence of vaccine derived-alum adjuvants into macrophages at sites of previous immunization. Despite increasing data describing clinical manifestations of ASIA have been reported, biological markers are particularly lacking for their characterization and follow up. We report an extensive cytokine screening performed in serum from 44 MMF patients compared both to sex and age matched healthy controls and to patients with various types of inflammatory neuromuscular diseases. Thirty cytokines were quantified using combination of Luminex® technology and ELISA. There was significant mean increase of serum levels of the monocytechemoattractant protein 1 (CCL 2 /MCP- 1) in MMF patients compared to healthy subjects. MMF patients showed no elevation of other cytokines. This contrasted with inflammatory patients in whom CCL 2 /MCP- 1 serum levels were unchanged, whereas <b>several</b> <b>other</b> <b>inflammatory</b> cytokines were elevated (IL 1 β, IL 5 and CCL 3 /MIP 1 α). These results suggest that CCL 2 may represent a biological marker relevant to the pathophysiology of MMF rather than a non specific inflammatory marker and that it should be checked in the other syndromes constitutive of ASIA...|$|R
40|$|Malaria is {{a deadly}} {{infectious}} disease {{caused by the}} intraerythrocytic protozoan parasite Plasmodium. The four species of Plasmodium known to affect humans all produce an inorganic crystal called hemozoin (HZ) during the heme detoxification process. HZ is released from the food vacuole into circulation during erythrocyte lysis, while the released parasites further infect additional naive red blood cells. Once in circulation, HZ is rapidly taken up by circulating monocytes and tissue macrophages, inducing the production of pro-inflammatory mediators, such as interleukin- 1 β (IL- 1 β). Over the last few years, {{it has been reported}} that HZ, similar to uric acid crystals, asbestos and silica, is able to trigger IL- 1 β production via the activation of the NOD-like receptor containing pyrin domain 3 (NLRP 3) inflammasome complex. Additionally, recent findings have shown that host factors, such as fibrinogen, have the ability to adhere to free HZ and modify its capacity to activate host immune cells. Although much has been discovered regarding NLRP 3 inflammasome induction, the mechanism through which this intracellular multimolecular complex is activated remains unclear. In the present review, the most recent discoveries regarding the capacity of HZ to trigger this innate immune complex will be discussed, as well as the impact of HZ on <b>several</b> <b>other</b> <b>inflammatory</b> signalling pathways...|$|R
40|$|Hyperproliferation of keratinocytes (KCs) in {{psoriasis}} {{has been}} found to be associated with excessive activation of a phospholipase C (PLC) /protein kinase C (PKC) signal transduction system. The molecular species of PLCs which are activated in psoriasis have not been thoroughly investigated. It was envisaged that if glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) -specific PLC was activated in the membrane of psoriatic epidermal cells, it would render these cells devoid of those proteins which are anchored to the cell membrane through their GPI moiety. In order to test this possibility, four GPI proteins (CD 16, CD 55, CD 58, and CD 59) were determined immunohistochemically in normal and psoriatic skin. In normal skin, CD 55 and CD 59 were strongly expressed on epithelium and vascular structures, whereas CD 16 and CD 58 were strongly expressed only on epithelium. The expression of all four GPI proteins was decreased in non-lesional psoriatic skin and virtually abolished in lesional psoriatic skin. A control transmembrane protein, CD 46, was strongly expressed in normal and non-lesional psoriatic skin, and its expression was not significantly decreased in psoriatic lesions. The absence or reduction of GPI proteins was not seen in the lesions of <b>several</b> <b>other</b> <b>inflammatory</b> and proliferative diseases studie...|$|R
40|$|TNF-alpha is a {{cytokine}} {{thought to}} be involved in the pathogenesis of asthma and in <b>several</b> <b>other</b> <b>inflammatory</b> conditions. Given recent evidence that mast cells (MC) are an important source of TNF-alpha, we investigated the effects of two anti-inflammatory drugs, nedocromil sodium (NED) and sodium cromoglycate (SCG), on rat MC-derived TNF-alpha. We established that at least 2 h pretreatment with NED or SCG followed by washing was required to inhibit TNF-alpha-dependent cytotoxicity by rat peritoneal MC (PMC). A maximum inhibition of TNF-alpha occurred after 6 h treatment. The inhibitory effect of NED and SCG (10 (- 5) - 10 (- 3) M) was concentration-dependent (20 - 37 % for NED and 16 - 37 % for SCG). The time-course analysis and the use of cycloheximide, an inhibitor of protein synthesis, provided strong evidence that new protein synthesis by the MC is required for this inhibitory effect. Furthermore, 24 h treatment with 1 mM NED inhibited the levels of mRNA for TNF-alpha by 59 - 83 %. In addition to the effect on TNF-alpha-dependent cytotoxicity by MC, 20 min pretreatment with 10 (- 4) M NED and SCG inhibited antigen-stimulated TNF-alpha release (6 h) by 42 % and 48 %, respectively. Interestingly, the functionally distinct intestinal mucosal MC (IMMC) is unresponsive to these drugs with regard to histamine secretion. However, as with PMC, 2 h pretreatment with NED or SCG inhibited TNF-alpha-dependent cytotoxicity by IMMC. These effects may be important in the action of these drugs in vivo in the late phase reaction in asthma or <b>other</b> <b>inflammatory</b> conditions...|$|R
40|$|Longitudinally {{extensive}} {{transverse myelitis}} (LETM) is a characteristic feature of Neuromyelitis Optica (NMO), {{but it can}} also occur in <b>several</b> <b>other</b> <b>inflammatory</b> diseases of the central nervous system (CNS). An IgG autoantibody that binds to aquaporin- 4 (AQP 4), the predominant water channel of the CNS, is a reliable biomarker of the NMO spectrum disorders, and if detected predicts the recurrence of the myelitis. In this study, we compared the clinical and neuroimaging characteristics of AQP 4 -IgG+ and AQP 4 -IgG- LETM patients. Thirty-seven first-ever LETM patients were retrospectively evaluated and divided into two groups according to the presence of AQP 4 autoantibodies. AQP 4 -IgG was detected in the serum and in the cerebrospinal fluid of sixteen patients. The female to male ratio was higher in AQP 4 -IgG+ patients. Intractable nausea and vomiting and paroxysmal tonic spasms often accompanied the LETM in AQP 4 -IgG+ patients. T 2 -weighted spinal cord MRI revealed that inflammatory lesions extending into the brainstem and involving the central grey matter occurred more frequently in AQP 4 -IgG+ LETM patients. Hypointense lesions on T 1 -weighted spinal cord MRI were detected more frequently in the seropositive group, and their presence correlated with attack severity. In conclusion, this study provides clinical and spinal cord neuroimaging clues that can help distinguishing AQP 4 -IgG+ LETM patients...|$|R
40|$|We have {{recently}} reported that administration of recombinant tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) to hepatitis B virus (HBV) transgenic mice reduces the hepatic steady-state content of HBV-specific mRNA {{by up to}} 80 % {{in the absence of}} liver cell injury. In the current study, we analyzed the regulatory effects of <b>several</b> <b>other</b> <b>inflammatory</b> cytokines in the same transgenic model system. Hepatic HBV mRNA content was reduced by up to 90 % following administration of a single noncytopathic dose (100, 000 U) of interleukin 2 (IL- 2). Comparable effects were produced by administration of alpha and beta interferons (IFN-alpha and IFN-beta), but only after multiple injections of at least 500, 000 U per mouse. Importantly, the regulatory effect of IL- 2 was completely blocked by the prior administration of antibodies to tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), which did not block the effect of IFN-alpha or IFN-beta. In contrast to these observations, recombinant IFN-gamma, IL- 1, IL- 3, IL- 6, TNF-beta, transforming growth factor beta, and granulocyte-monocyte colony-stimulating factor were inactive in this system. These results suggest that selected inflammatory cytokines can down-regulate HBV gene expression in vivo by at least two pathways, one that is dependent on TNF-alpha and another that is not. These results imply that antigen-nonspecific products of the intrahepatic HBV-specific inflammatory response may contribute to viral clearance or persistence during HBV infection...|$|R
