40|$|De novo {{assembly}} of the transcriptome is crucial for functional genomics studies in bioenergy research, {{since many of the}} organisms lack high quality reference genomes. In a previous study we <b>successfully</b> <b>de</b> novo assembled simple eukaryote transcriptomes exclusively from short Illumina RNA-Seq reads [1]. However, extensive alternative splicing, present in most of the higher eukaryotes, poses a significant challenge for current short read assembly processes. Furthermore, the size of next-generation datasets, often large for plant genomes, presents an informatics challenge. To tackle these challenges we present a combined experimental and informatics strategy for de novo assembly in higher eukaryotes. Using maize as a test case, preliminary results suggest our approach can resolve transcript variants and improve gene annotations...|$|E

The optimization of the actual hyper-systolic communication layout is a non-trivial task if more than 64 processing nodes are involved.

40|$|Whole Genome Shotgun (WGS) {{sequences}} of plant species often contain {{an abundance of}} reads that are derived from the chloroplast genome. Up to now these reads have generally been identified and assembled into chloroplast genomes based on homology to chloroplasts from related species. This re-sequencing approach may select against structural differences between the genomes especially in non-model species for which no close relatives have been sequenced before. The alternative approach is to de novo assemble the chloroplast genome from total genomic DNA sequences. In this study, we used k-mer frequency tables to identify and extract the chloroplast reads from the WGS reads and assemble these using a highly integrated and automated custom pipeline. Our strategy includes steps aimed at optimizing assemblies and filling gaps which are left due to coverage variation in the WGS dataset. We have <b>successfully</b> <b>de</b> novo assembled three complete chloroplast genomes from plant species {{with a range of}} nuclear genome sizes to demonstrate the universality of our approach: Solanum lycopersicum (0. 9 Gb), Aegilops tauschii (4 Gb) and Paphiopedilum henryanum (25 Gb). We also highlight the need to optimize the choice of k and the amount of data used. This new and cost-effective method for de novo short read assembly will facilitate the study of complete chloroplast genomes with more accurate analyses and inferences, especially in non-model plant genomes...|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe {{present the}} first global {{computer-aided}} sequencing algorithm for the de novo determination of short nucleic acid sequences. The method compares the fragment ion spectra generated by collision-induced dissociation of multiply charged oligodeoxynucleotide-ions to the m/z values predicted employing established fragmentation pathways from a known reference sequence. The closeness of matching between the measured spectrum and the predicted set of fragment ions {{is characterized by}} the fitness, which takes into account the difference between measured and predicted m/z values, the intensity of the fragment ions, the number of fragments assigned, and the number of nucleotide positions not covered by fragment ions in the experimental spectrum. Smaller values for the fitness indicate a closer match between the measured spectrum and predicted m/z values. In order to find the sequence most closely matching the experimental spectrum, starting from a given nucleotide composition all possible oligonucleotide sequences are assembled followed by identification of the correct sequence by the lowest fitness value. Using this concept, sequences of 5 - to 12 -mer oligodeoxynucleotides were <b>successfully</b> <b>de</b> novo determined. High sequence coverage with fragment ions was essential for obtaining unequivocal sequencing results. Moreover, the collision energy was shown {{to have an impact on}} the interpretability of tandem mass spectra by the de novo sequencing algorithm.

40|$|The Brassica genus {{comprises}} many economically important worldwide cultivated crops. The well-established {{model of}} the Brassica genus, U’s triangle, consists of three basic diploid plant species (Brassica rapa, Brassica oleracea, and Brassica nigra) and three amphidiploid species (Brassica napus, Brassica juncea, and Brassica carinata) that arose through interspecific hybridizations. Despite being extensively studied because of its commercial relevance, several aspects {{of the origin of}} the Brassica species and the relationships within and among these six species still remain open questions. Here, we <b>successfully</b> <b>de</b> novo assembled 60 complete chloroplast genomes of Brassica genotypes of all six species. A complete map of the single nucleotide variants and insertions and deletions in the chloroplast genomes of different Brassica species was produced. The chloroplast genome consists of a Large and a Small Single Copy (LSC and SSC) region between two inverted repeats, and while these regions of chloroplast genomes have very different molecular evolutionary rates, phylogenetic analyses of different regions yielded no contradicting topologies and separated the Brassica genus into four clades. B. carinata and B. juncea share their chloroplast genome with one of their hybridization donors B. nigra and B. rapa, respectively, which fits the U model. B. rapa, surprisingly, shows evidence of two types of chloroplast genomes, with one type specific to some Italian broccoletto accessions. B. napus clearly has evidence for two independent hybridization events, as it contains either B. rapa chloroplast genomes. The divergence estimation suggests that B. nigra and B. carinata diverged from the main Brassica clade 13. 7 million years ago (Mya), while B. rapa and B. oleracea diverged at 2. 18 Mya. The use of the complete chloroplast DNA sequence not only provides insights into comparative genome analysis but also paves the way for {{a better understanding of the}} phylogenetic relationships within the Brassica genus...|$|E

Defesa: Curitiba, 22 / 02 / 2016 Inclui referências : f. 68 - 77 Resumo: A compreensão dos mecanismos dinâmicos que levam à formação de estados turbulentos em sistemas dinâmicos espacialmente estendidos constituem um dos maiores problemas da física matemática contemporânea. Observa-se que frequentemente estas transições acontecem de maneira intermitente, i. e, a dinâmica alterna de uma maneira aparentemente {{irregular}} entre estados de caos temporal e turbulentos. O estudo do início intermitente da turbulência é ainda mais importante se consideramos a aplicação em potencial na compreensão de sistemas que apresentam eventos extremos em suas evoluções temporais, há uma semelhação notável no comportamento dinâmicos de sistemas com eventos extremos e intermitência em sistemas espac ialmente estendidos. Neste trabalho, estudamos uma transição de um estado laminar para aos temporal para turbulência, que acontece de maneira intermitente, na equação de Shrödinger não-linear unidimensional forçada e amortecida. Este modelo representa vários problemas físicos distintos, particularmente oferece uma descrição precisa da dinâmica de envelope de ondas em um meio levemente não-linear, dispersivo e conservativo. As propriedades estatísticas da série temporal da energia da onda sugere que a transição acontece de acordo com um mecânismo dinâmico conhecido na literatura, que se chama intermitência co- induzida por variabilidade da dimensão instável. A análise posterior das distribuições dos expoentes de Lyapunov a tempo finito confirma que a perda de estabilidade transversal de um atrator caótico de baixa dimensionalidade, imerso no espaço de fase de Fourier, é de fato o mecânismo subjacente à intermitência, e portanto leva o sistema ao estado turbulento. Especificamente para o modelo estudado, o aumento da amplitude de forçamento induz a perda de estabilidade transversal de um atrator de baixa energia, o que leva a emergência de intermitência no sistema, e posteriormente turbulência. Adicionalmente, foi possível decompor a dinâmica nos chamados modos longitudinais, mistos e transversais. Posteriormente, mapeamos de maneira aproximada as regiões de instabilidade transversal máxima no atrator caótico de baixa dimensionalidade, e então perturbamos o sistema para inibir a ocorrência de eventos extremos intermitentes. Abstract: The {{understanding of}} the dynamical mechanisms {{that lead to the}} formation of turbulent states in spatially extended dynamical systems constitutes a major problem in modern mathematical physics. It is observed that often these transitions o ur intermittently, i. e., the dynamics shifts in a seemingly random way between states of temporal chaos and turbulent states. The study of intermittent onset of turbulence is even more important if we consider the potential application in the understanding of systems that possess extreme events in their temporal evolution, there is a great resemblance in the behavior of extreme events dynamics and intermittent spatially extended systems. In this work, we studied a transition from a laminar state to temporal chaos to turbulence which happens in an intermittent way, in the one-dimensional for ed and damped nonlinear Shrödinger equation, a model that represents diferent physical problems, particularly it provides an accurate description of the envelope dynamics of waves in slightly nonlinear, dispersive and conservative medium. The statistical properties of the time series of the wave energy show that the transition takes place accordingly with a known dynamical behavior named in the literature as on-off intermittency induced by unstable dimension variability. The further analysis of the distribution of the finite time Lyapunov exponents confims that the loss of transverse instability of a low dimensional chaotic attractor, embedded in the Fourier phase spa e, is indeed the underlying mechanism behind the intermittency, and therefore leads the system to a turbulent state. In the specific case of the studied model, the increase in intensity of the for ing amplitude induces the loss of transverse stability in a low-energy attractor, which leads to the emergence of intermittency and then spatiotemporal chaos in the system. Additionally, we were able to <b>successfully</b> <b>de</b> compose the dynamics into the so called longitudinal, mixed and transverse modes. It was then possible to approximately map the regions of maximum transverse instability in the low-dimensional chaotic attractor, and perturb the system in order to inhibit the ocurrence of intermittent extreme events.

Activation of ChREBP was required for the increased expression of glycolytic and lipogenic genes as well as glucose- 6 -phosphatase (G 6 pc) that was associated with the effects of fructose administration. We found that fructose-induced G 6 PC activity is a major determinant of hepatic glucose production and reduces hepatic glucose- 6 -phosphate levels to complete a homeostatic loop. Moreover, fructose activated ChREBP and induced G 6 pc in the absence of Foxo 1 a, indicating that carbohydrate-induced activation of ChREBP and G 6 PC dominates over the suppressive effects of insulin to enhance glucose production. This ChREBP/G 6 PC signaling axis is conserved in humans. Together, these findings support a carbohydrate-mediated, ChREBP-driven mechanism that contributes to hepatic insulin resistance...|$|R
