40|$|A {{firm that}} {{accounts}} for consumer behavior sets the <b>selling</b> <b>price</b> of a product considering the reference price of consumers. In the literature, a reference price is usually modeled as depending on past <b>selling</b> <b>prices.</b> That is, past <b>selling</b> <b>prices</b> implicitly constrain the current <b>selling</b> <b>price</b> of a product. In this article, the author explicitly measures this constraint with an optimal control framework. He works on the structural properties of a general demand function, which depends on both <b>selling</b> and reference <b>prices.</b> Analytical results prove the following claims. Adjusting reference prices effects increase the price elasticity of demand, the demand function becoming flatter. Thus, the reference price effect weakens the market power of the firm. Also, the reference price effect constitutes a main driver {{of the dynamics of}} the <b>selling</b> <b>price.</b> But contrary to intuition, <b>selling</b> <b>price</b> dynamics does not systematically imitate reference price dynamics...|$|R

40|$|This paper empirically {{examines}} the macroeconomic {{factors that affect}} the rental rates and <b>selling</b> <b>prices</b> of office space. The data are {{in the form of}} quarterly time series which are used for the period of 1996 : 1 to 2012 : 4 period. In addition, quantitative methods in the form of Vector Error Correction Model (VECM) are also used in this study. The results showed that there is a long-term relationship between macroeconomic variables with the rental rate and <b>selling</b> <b>prices</b> of office space. IRF and FEVD showed that the rental rates and <b>selling</b> <b>prices</b> responded permanently to the shocks that occured on macroeconomic variables. Moreover, the rental rate is predominantly influenced by the rental rate followed by the service sector employment, the <b>selling</b> <b>price,</b> exchange rate, inflation, interest rates and economic growth. Conversely, the <b>selling</b> <b>price</b> is predominantly influenced by the rental rate followed by service sector employment, the exchange rate, economic growth, the <b>selling</b> <b>price,</b> infllation and interest rates.

5000|$|A {{market maker}} or {{liquidity}} provider {{is a company}} or an individual that quotes both a buy and a <b>sell</b> <b>price</b> in a financial instrument or commodity held in inventory, hoping {{to make a profit}} on the bid-offer spread, or turn. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission defines a [...] "market maker" [...] as a firm that stands ready to buy and sell stock on a regular and continuous basis at a publicly quoted price.|$|E
50|$|Market {{makers are}} {{broker-dealer}} institutions that quote a buy and <b>sell</b> <b>price</b> and facilitate transactions for financial assets. Such assets include equities, government and corporate debt, derivatives, and foreign currencies. After receiving an order, the market maker immediately sells from its inventory or makes a purchase {{to offset the}} loss in inventory. The differential between the buying and selling quotes, or the bid-offer spread, is how the market-maker makes a profit. A major contribution of the market makers is improving the liquidity of financial assets in the market.|$|E
5000|$|The {{bid price}} (also {{known as the}} buy price) and the ask price (also known as the <b>sell</b> <b>price)</b> of a {{security}} are the prices (and often quantities) at which buyers and sellers are willing to purchase or sell that security. The bid shows the current price at which a buyer is willing to purchase shares, while the ask shows the current price at which {{they are willing to}} sell. The quantities at which these trades are placed are referred to as [...] "bid size" [...] and [...] "ask size". For instance, if a trader submits a limit order to buy 1,000 shares of MSFT at $28.00, this order will appear in a market maker for MSFT's book with a bid of $28.00 and a bid size of 1000.

40|$|This diploma thesis {{analyses}} {{land prices}} in the Savinja statistical region. The analysis is performed {{on the basis of}} data including advertised and <b>selling</b> <b>prices</b> of wooded areas as well as agricultural and building land. All <b>selling</b> <b>prices</b> also comprise a general market value determined by means of the real estate mass appraisal conducted by the Surveying and Mapping Authority of the Republic of Slovenia (GURS). In the beginning, the treated region is analysed as a whole. To perform a detailed analysis of the relevant land prices and general market values, an analysis {{at the level of the}} local communities is also included. The analysis of the discrepancy between advertised and <b>selling</b> <b>prices</b> shows that advertised prices are in all cases higher than the selling ones. However, the analysis of the discrepancy between <b>selling</b> <b>prices</b> and general market values reveals that general market values are lower than relevant <b>selling</b> <b>prices.</b> On the basis of the results, it was established that there exist the biggest discrepancy between advertised <b>prices,</b> <b>selling</b> <b>prices</b> and general market values in the sphere of building land, and the smallest in the one of wooded areas.

50|$|Unlike {{continental}} European trading hubs such as Zeebrugge and TTF, trades {{made at the}} NBP are {{not required}} to be balanced, and there is no fixed penalty for being out of balance. Instead, shippers out of balance {{at the end of the}} day are automatically balanced through the 'cash-out' procedure whereby the shipper is automatically made to buy or sell the required quantity of gas to balance their position at the marginal system buy or <b>sell</b> <b>price</b> for that day. This cash out process is not considered to be a penalty in the same way as those imposed on shippers in continental markets, because the cash-out prices are often very close to the spot price. As a result of this daily market liquidity, the UK's NBP is frequently used to balance a shipper's position on the continent by way of the Bacton - Zeebrugge interconnector.|$|E

We develop a trade-weighted performance measure and {{examine the impact of}} trading intervals, price spreads, and market timing on performance. We find that different investor types gain or lose from different sources. For example, we discover that individual investors have poor market timing ability but potentially gain during short-run trading intervals as their average <b>sell</b> <b>price</b> is consistently higher than the average purchase price. In contrast, we find that foreign investors consistently generate gains from trade due to good market timing, although their average <b>sell</b> <b>price</b> is lower than the average purchase price. Also, we find that foreign investors extract significant portion of their gains by trading against Japanese institutional investors when Japanese investors trade before their fiscal-year end.

40|$|The waste {{management}} is a pregnant problematic in the European continent and in France too. The new paradigm called circular economy aims to be driver for the waste valorization. This objective is particularly {{applied in the}} civil engineering, the first generator of CDW (Construction and Demolition Waste) in France. In this context, except the eco-construction, the recycling or reusing is currently necessary for the CDW valorization. But, the economic criteria such <b>sell</b> <b>price</b> or manufacturing cost are brakes to facilitate the waste valorization. In addition, using the waste is confronted to standards and NIMBY (Not In My BackYard). To lift these brakes, the waste upcycling allows producing high quality materials from CDW. This choice {{seems to be a}} relevant orientation in terms of economic and technology. For further details, the recycling plant can produce high quality materials with a <b>sell</b> <b>price</b> more competitive than the high quality raw materials. This economic advantage can guarantee the investment necessary to set up this kind of plant. For example, the Esterel group has chosen this orientation since several years. The obtained results of the materials valorization are compared to the results from a study realized by the French energy agency. Finally, this comparison allows concluding about the relevancy of the CDW upcycling, which can be economically sustainable...|$|E
