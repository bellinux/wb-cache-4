2500|$|An {{important}} {{shift in}} philosophy in the Catalogs {{occurred in the}} early 1970s, when Brand decided that the early stance of emphasizing individualism should be replaced with one favoring community. [...] He had originally written that [...] "a realm of intimate, personal power is developing"; regarding this as important in some respects (to wit, the soon-emerging potentials of personal computing), Brand felt that the overarching project of humankind {{had more to do}} with living within natural systems, and this is <b>something</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> in common, interactively.|$|E
2500|$|... "Pete" [...] {{also tells}} host Ponek that the Angels were hired by Cutler {{because of some}} rowdy, anxious on-stage {{incidents}} during the Stones' Oakland and Miami concerts weeks earlier. As security guards, Pete said [...] "we ain't into that security", but that they agreed after the beer offer. He also claimed that, other than being told to [...] "just keep people off the stage", Cutler gave the Hells Angels very little specific instructions for stage security: [...] "They didn't say nothing to us about any of that." [...] And although the Angels are not security guards, [...] "If we say we're going to do <b>something,</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> it. If we decide to do it, it's done. No matter what, how far {{we have to go}} to do it." [...] The similar lack of detailed security instructions by the concert's management was also mentioned by Barger during his telephone call-in.|$|E

Teach us <b>something</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not know, not something which we do. Why preach to us about a text which we fully understand, and believe already? ...|$|E

60|$|An {{occasion}} for manifesting this skill did {{not fail to}} present itself soon--as indeed it seldom does to such a hero of romance as young Otto was. Fate seems to watch over such: events occur to them just {{in the nick of}} time; they rescue virgins just as ogres are on the point of devouring them; they manage to be present at court and interesting ceremonies, and to see the most interesting people at the most interesting moment; directly an adventure is necessary for them, that adventure occurs: and I, for my part, have often wondered with delight (and never could penetrate the mystery of the subject) at the way in which that humblest of romance heroes, Signor Clown, when he wants anything in the Pantomime, straightway finds it to his hand. How is it that,--suppose he wishes to dress himself up like a woman for instance, that minute a coalheaver walks in with a shovel-hat that answers for a bonnet; at the very next instant a butcher's lad passing with a string of sausages and a bundle of bladders unconsciously helps Master Clown to a necklace and a tournure, and so on through the whole toilet? Depend upon it there is <b>something</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not wot of in that mysterious overcoming of circumstances by great individuals: that apt and wondrous conjuncture of THE HOUR AND THE MAN; and so, for my part, when I heard the above remark of one of the archers, that Otto had never a feather in his bonnet, I felt sure that a heron would spring up in the next sentence to supply him with an aigrette.|$|E
5000|$|Cherokee/Choctaw author Louis Owens {{discusses}} {{his feelings}} about his status of not being a real Indian because he's not enrolled.

Listening to my mother's stories about Oklahoma, about brutally hard lives and dreams that cut across the fabric of every experience, I thought I was Indian." ...|$|R

5000|$|After {{numerous}} {{attempts to find}} more characteristics of performatives, and after having met with many difficulties, Austin makes {{what he calls a}} [...] "fresh start", in which he considers [...] "more generally the senses in which to say something may be to do something, or in saying <b>something</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> something".|$|E

[...] "That was just <b>something</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> with Anne and it made the cut," [...] Colleen Dengel told BuzzFeed in 2017. Nevertheless, it took three more days of filming to get the shot of the girls up in the stairwell the way Frankel wanted it, a look she believes {{was inspired by a}} similar scene with twin girls in The Shining.|$|R
5000|$|As {{pre-production}} for Three Snakes and One Charm began, several {{songs were}} written with Chris and Rich Robinson on different {{sides of the}} United States. Rich would write and record music in Atlanta, GA and send his results to Chris in Los Angeles, CA. [...] "The long-distance writing was just <b>something</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> to get the process more concrete," [...] Rich told Acoustic Guitar magazine in 1996. [...] "I {{had a lot of}} bits and pieces that I'd written on tour and I needed to hear what Chris would do with them." ...|$|R
5000|$|Ed Droste {{described}} Shields overall aesthetic as [...] "very in-your-face", {{saying that}} [...] "the drums and vocals are clearer and louder. Its not as dreamy and pastoral and sleepy as past efforts, {{and theres a}} lot of raw vocal takes, which is <b>something</b> <b>we</b> <b>dont</b> normally do." [...] Rossen elaborated, [...] "Previous records were definitely dreamier with lots of layered vocals and weve started pairing those back and taking them away, taking them away. Thats what we went for on this record: clearer performances and more direct arrangements." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{lyrics of}} the song, such as [...] "We turn our water into wine/ it's <b>something</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> all the time/ it doesn't cost a single dime/ And its beautiful" [...] are noted to be {{remarkable}} for both their simplicity {{and their ability}} to convey so much with so little.|$|E
5000|$|According to Austin's {{preliminary}} informal description, {{the idea}} of an [...] "illocutionary act" [...] can be captured by emphasizing that [...] "by saying <b>something,</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> something", as when someone issues an order to someone to go by saying [...] "Go!", or when a minister joins two people in marriage saying, [...] "I now pronounce you husband and wife." [...] (Austin would eventually define the [...] "illocutionary act" [...] in a more exact manner.) ...|$|E

5000|$|... "Community is <b>something</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> together. It's {{not just}} a container," [...] said {{sociologist}} David Brain. Infrastructure, roads, water, sewer, electricity and housing provides the shell within which people live. It is within this shell that people do the things together {{that allow them to}} sustain livelihoods. These include {{but are not limited to}} education, health care, business, recreation, and spiritual celebration. People working together with shared understandings and expectations are what provide a place of strong community.|$|E

That's in the books, and that's <b>something</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> and <b>something</b> to be proud of.

5000|$|He {{described}} {{his time in}} the military as [...] "a very mild deployment" [...] as a Public Affairs Officer. He said that he wrote his collection of short stories based on his service and return to civilian life because: ...what I really want — and I think what a lot of veterans want — is a sense of serious engagement with the wars, because it's important, because it matters, because lives are at stake, and it's <b>something</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> as a nation. That's something that deserves to be thought about very seriously and very honestly, without resorting to the sort of comforting stories that allow us to tie a bow on the experience and move on.|$|R
5000|$|Joe Nickell, {{writing in}} the Skeptical Inquirer, {{observed}} the use of slaying in the Spirit during a Benny Hinn healing crusade in 2001. He compared the practice to hypnosis, writing that participants [...] "merely engage in a form of role-playing that is prompted by their strong desire to receive divine power {{as well as by}} the influence of suggestion that they do so ... In short, they behave just as if 'hypnotized. A professional hypnotist stated that [...] "This is <b>something</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> every day".|$|E
50|$|It is {{very hard}} to generalize {{about the ways in which}} discussions of {{philosophical}} topics shifted in the Renaissance, mainly because to do so requires a detailed map of the period, <b>something</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not yet have. We know that debates about the freedom of the will continued to flare up (for instance, in the famous exchanges between Erasmus and Martin Luther), that Spanish thinkers were increasingly obsessed with the notion of nobility, that duelling was a practice that generated a large literature in the sixteenth century (was it permissible or not?).|$|E

[...] This, she said, was [...] "not on." [...] She also complained that the government had shown no interest in including the Mara family in the reconciliation process.
