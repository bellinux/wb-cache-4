40|$|Samples of non-striated {{fracture}} surfaces within clastic {{materials of}} Late Pliocene–Pleistocene age from the Teruel grabens (eastern Spain) have been analysed using a stress inversion method based on observations of slip sense. The results obtained at 21 sites are compared with Late Miocene–Early Pliocene extensional stress tensors previously inferred from striated faults {{in the same}} area. The similarity between both sets of stress states suggests that the extensional Miocene–Pliocene stress field essentially continues (with minor changes) into Pliocene–Pleistocene times. The main changes involve (a) the dominant trend of σ 3 trajectories, which evolve from ESE to ENE; (b) the waning of the compressional component caused by Europe–Iberia–Africa convergence; and (c) the progressive trend towards a multidirectional extension regime. Stress deflection caused by large-scale extensional faults as well as switching of σ 2 and σ 3 axes induced by fracture development are common within this stress field. They produce groups of local <b>stress</b> <b>ellipsoids</b> with σ 3 axes orthogonal {{to each other and}} either orthogonal or parallel to the faults bounding the grabens. The regional consistency of the new results gives support to the new inversion method and demonstrates its utility in research on young sedimentary rocks, where ‘gaps’ in palaeostress records may exist due to absence of striated faults...|$|R

The asymptotic limit of low magnetic Reynolds number is assumed. Large-eddy simulations with the dynamic Smagorinsky model are performed in a computational box sufficiently large to minimize the effect of periodic boundary conditions. The initial microscale Reynolds number is about 170 and the magnetic interaction parameter N varies between 0 and 50. We find that except for a short period of time when N = 50, the flow evolution is strongly influenced by nonlinearity and cannot be adequately described by any of the existing theoretical models. One particularly noteworthy result is the near equipartition between the rates of Joule and viscous dissipations of the kinetic energy observed at all values of N during the late stages of the decay. Further, the velocity components parallel and perpendicular to the magnetic field decay at different rates, whose value depends on the strength of the magnetic field and the stage of the decay. This leads to a complex evolution of the Reynolds <b>stress</b> anisotropy <b>ellipsoid,</b> which goes from being rod-shaped, through spherical to disc-shaped. We also discuss the possibility of the power-law decay, the comparison between computed, experimental and theoretical decay exponents, the anisotropy of small-scale fluctuations, and the evolution of the spectral energy distributions. © 2010 Cambridge University Press.

An <b>ellipsoid</b> pressure vessel model of sternal forces is presented together with its application for optimal wire placement in the sternum. Sternal forces were calculated by computational simulation using an ellipsoid chest wall model. Sternal forces were correlated with different sternal thicknesses and radio-density as measured by computerized tomography (CT) scans of the sternum. A comparison of alternative placement of trans-sternal wires located either at the levels of the costal cartilages or the intercostal spaces was made. The ellipsoid pressure vessel model shows that higher levels of stress are operative at increasing chest diameter (P < 0. 001). CT scans show that {{the thickness of the}} sternal body is on average 3 mm and 30 % thicker (P < 0. 001) and 53 % more radio-dense (P < 0. 001) at the costal cartilage levels when compared with adjacent intercostal spaces. This results in a decrease of average sternal stress from 438 kPa at the intercostal space level to 338 kPa at the costal cartilage level (P = 0. 003).

40|$|Massive {{multistage}} {{hydraulic fracturing}} using horizontal wells {{has been an}} integral part of the natural resource industry in Canada. The process uses long horizontal wells divided into many stages to access large volumes of oil and gas bearing formations. Each well is divided into fracture stages. Fluids are pumped down into each stage of the well to generate a fracture which increases the porosity and permeability of the formation to allow economic resource extraction. The in situ geomechanical stresses of the formation do not remain static during the fracturing of the rock. Each fracture creates a volume change within the formation which in turn leads to alteration of the stress and strain conditions within the rock mass. There is the possibility that the alteration of stress conditions will have an effect on the initiation and propagation of subsequent stages of the multi-stage hydraulic fracture operation. This phenomenon is known as ‘stress shadowing’. Stress shadowing occurs when the minimum compressive stress in the formation is increased due to the fracturing of the rock. Increasing the minimum compressive horizontal stress can have several effects, including the rotation or diversion of fracture propagation, stages that do not initiate, thinner fractures, and reduced porosity and permeability within the fracture stage. Currently, many hydraulic fracture operations do not invest in advanced mathematical models of geomechanics. Some pressure monitoring is carried out during operations, but the data are inadequate to warrant advanced numerical methods to predict stress change and its effects. This thesis presents a semi-analytical solution for the <b>stresses</b> around an <b>ellipsoid</b> (the Eshelby Solution) for use in predicting fracture geometry and stress shadow effects. The program is quick to use and can be linked to field data. A study of field data from the Montney Formation is presented.

40|$|The {{publication}} presents {{results of}} the study aimed at reconstruction of recent crustal stresses for Central and South-Eastern Asia with application of the method of cataclastic analysis of displacements caused by ruptures, which was proposed by Yu. L. Rebetsky. Two sources of seismic data were referred to: (1) the catalog comprising data from publications covering the period from 1904 to 1992, and (2) the Global Centroid Moment Tensor (CMT) Database of earthquake mechanisms ([URL]), which covers the period from 1978 to 2010. The method of cataclastic analysis in its earliest version was applied in 1996 and 1997 when seismic data from the first catalog were analyzed, and it yielded only parameters of stress ellipsoids; the reconstructions were published in a Russian-Chinese journal (it does not exist now). In this paper, these reconstructions are presented in new graphical formats of GIS. Data from the Global CMT Database were analyzed by the method of cataclastic analysis in the new revision with application of its stages 1 and 2. Based on the calculations, orientations of axes of principal <b>stresses,</b> types of <b>ellipsoids,</b> correlations between spherical and deviatoric components of stress tensors, and reduced stresses were determined. The two sets of reconstructions are compared in this paper. The catalog of earthquake focal mechanisms for the period from 1904 to 1992 consolidated information provided by different authors, and thus focal data for many seismic events were highly inconsistent; therefore, the reliability of reconstructions based on such data seems to be lower than that on the basis the Global CMT Database for the period from 1978 to 2010. Some of the reconstructed stress tensor parameters are mapped. For the areas which data are given in the Global CMT Database and considered as more reliable, mapping is based on stress parameters calculated from such data. For the areas that are not covered by the Global CMT Database, reconstructions based on the first catalog are mapped. In the maps showing consolidated patterns of the state of stresses, spacious areas of horizontal extension of the crust in Tibet are clearly identified. In the south, such areas are bordered by regions of horizontal compression of the crust in Himalaya; in the north and north-east, they are bordered by regions of horizontal shear of the crust in East Kunlun. According to results of calculations at stage 2 of the method of cataclastic analyses, the crust in the central part of Tibet is subject to intensive confining pressure and lateral compression that is reduced in the neighboring regions. The crust in the southern and northern parts of Pamir is also subject to horizontal extension and shear. Regions of horizontal compression are located to the north, west and south of Pamir. Regulations of the field of recent tectonic stresses of Tibet and Pamir, which are revealed in this study, {{can be explained by the}} concept of ‘tectonic spreading’ of these regions due to gravity, which causes intensive horizontal spreading of the crust in Himalaya when the southern boundary of Tibet bends outwards and spreads over the Indian ‘indenter’ moving in the north–north-eastern direction. It is suggested by the data on horizontal extension of the crust in Tibet and underthrusting shear stresses over the horizontal zones that the impact Indian ‘indenter’ does not go beyond the crust of Pamir and the crust of the central parts of Tibet which is located above the long-term active mantle plume.    </p...|$|R

As a consequence, {{a large amount of}} data on sub-seismic deformation patterns from thrust-related an-ticlines is available in the literature. We provide a review of deformation pattern templates fromfield data in forelandfold-and-thrust-belts and show that the most frequent trends of sub-seismic syn-orogenic deformation structureshosted in km-scale thrust-related folds frequently and paradoxically indicate a syn-thrusting strike-slip stressfield con-figuration, with a near-verticalσ 2 and a sub-horizontalσ 3, rather than a contractional one where the latter is expectedto be the vertical principal axis of the <b>stress</b> <b>ellipsoid.</b> This apparent inconsistency between sub-seismic syn-orogenicdeformation structures and stressfield orientation is here named“theσ 2 paradox”. Field data support a possible expla-nation of the paradox, provided by the major role played by inherited early-orogenic extensional deformation struc-tures on thrust fault nucleation. Nucleation of major thrusts and their propagation is facilitated and driven by thepositive inversion and linkage of the early-orogenic sub-seismic extensional inheritance developed in the forelandbasin.

40|$|The spatial {{distribution}} of faults is usually described as a fractal set characterised by the fractal dimension. In this work, we have filtered fault patterns interpreted from digital elevation models, aerial photographs and field maps, by using structural geological parameters of the <b>stress</b> <b>ellipsoid</b> (stress tensor direction and stress ratio R 0) and age of deformation. From these filtered structural maps, we have obtained the fractal dimension associated with the fracture patterns developed during Permo-Triassic and Alpine tectonic events on a Variscan granitic massif located in the Spanish Central System. Oriented fractal dimensions were calculated on several transects crossing the fault-filtered maps. The fractal dimension (D), calculated by 1 -D box-counting, describes an ellipse on a polar plot with the short axis as the minimum value (DHmin) and the long axis as the maximum value (DHmax) of the fractal dimensions measured. From these analyses, we have defined the F-parameter {{as a function of}} the maximum value, minimum value and vertical value of fractal dimension (Dz), FZ(DzKDHmin) /(DHmaxK DHmin). Finally we have established, from a local scale analysis, a perpendicular relationship between the principal axes of the ellipse of the fractal spatial anisotropy of fractures and the principal axes of the stress tensor (sHmax, sHmin and sz) that generates this dynamic pattern of fractures. Furthermore, the F-parameter and the stress ratio R 0 are equivalents and, applied in this area, both show a triaxial extension...|$|E
40|$|The {{detailed}} {{structural analysis}} of a large sector of the Eastern Dolomites has been carried out. The field work based on existing unpublished geological maps, has been concentrated on {{the reconstruction of the}} major tectonic elements {{as well as on the}} unravelling of the complex regmatic system affecting the area. Mesostructural data have been collected throughout the area and analysed using well tested computer aided methodologies. From each station of measurements the three principal stress axes have been obtained. These results permit to reconstruct the tectonic stratigraphy of the area. According to the superposition of striae and similar relationships criteria, four compressional events have been recognised. The average directions of the sigma 1 axes are N 58 °, N 26 °, N 346 ° and N 307 °, from older to younger, respectively. Unfortunately, due to the age of the affected rocks (Permian-Triassic), only the relative chronology of the phases has been established. However, by comparison with the results of a similar study carried out in other sectors of the Southern Alps, these phases can be tentatively dated as pre-Oligocene, Chattian-Burdigalian, Serravalian-Tortonian and Late Messinian-Early Pliocene, respectively. The results also allow some conclusions concerning the temporal evolution of the <b>stress</b> <b>ellipsoid</b> whose shape changed from triaxial and purely compressional (subvertical sigma 3), to triaxial and transcurrent (subvertical sigma 2) via an intermediate stage with uniaxial geometry (sigma 2 = sigma 3).

A best estimate of laboratory modulus acquired by comparing three different sources was E/sub l/ = 70 GPa. Therefore, the modulus reduction factor for the Climax granite appears to be E/sub f//E/sub l/ = 0. 37. In turn, our estimate of in situ rock-mass deformability was used to back-calculate in situ values for the normal stiffness of the granite joints. Our analysis of former stress measurements by the US Geological Survey (USGS) shows that the horizontal stresses in the vicinity of SFT-C vary greatly with azimuth.

The regional foliation of the augen gneisses developed at lower amphibolite facies conditions and {{is associated with a}} top-to-west sense of shear. The granitoid protolith is preserved in the kilometre-scale low-strain domain of the Piantonetto Valley and mainly consists of a porphyritic metagranite including joints, leucocratic dykes and biotite-rich schlieren. In this low-strain domain, the Alpine deformation is mainly localized in discrete ductile shear zones within weakly foliated metagranite. The shear zones mostly dip towards S–SE in a shallow (shear zones 1) to steep inclination (shear zones 2). The shear zones show typical features that can be explained by reactivation of pre-existing joints and planar compositional heterogeneities. Palaeostress and strain analysis indicate that shear zones and the metagranite foliation both formed {{in the presence of a}} strong component of flattening. The kinematics of individual shear zones depends on the orientation of the original heterogeneities (acting as nucleation planes) and by partitioning of strain components at the kilometre-scale with concentration of the flattening component to the Piantonetto low-strain domain. The strain geometry and the kinematics of individual shear zones within Piantonetto are not directly connected to the top-to-west sense of tectonic transport observed elsewhere in the Gran Paradiso nappe. However, the bulk <b>stress</b> <b>ellipsoid</b> reconstructed for the incipient shear zone network within very weakly deformed granites is oriented consistently with the bulk direction of tectonic transport within the Gran Paradiso massif. We conclude that the shear zone network of the Piantonetto Valley is representative of the incipient stages of ductile deformation of a granite nappe.
