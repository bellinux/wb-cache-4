This observation could be {{explained by the fact that}} extended <b>shallow</b> planar soil slides are clearly a much larger phenomenon than the fewer embankment slips defined as embankment <b>shallow</b> planar soil slide or <b>shallow</b> soil slip and involve greater quantities of soil material. Moreover, 16 cases of significant gully erosion were detected and involved lower quantities of soil material. Nevertheless, regarding the damaged areas, embankment <b>shallow</b> planar soil slide or <b>shallow</b> soil slip are clearly responsible for most of the road maintenance needed and also represent a large part of agriculture land losses, especially in terraces subject to failure processes but also due to land down-slope buried by deposits. Extended <b>shallow</b> planar soil slides are also playing an important role in burying agriculture lands.|$|R

5|$|While similar lifeforms {{have been}} known to exist in <b>shallower</b> oceanic {{trenches}} (>7,000m) and on the abyssal plain, the lifeforms discovered in the Challenger Deep may represent independent taxa from those <b>shallower</b> ecosystems. This preponderance of soft-shelled organisms at the Challenger Deep may be a result of selection pressure. Millions of years ago, the Challenger Deep was <b>shallower</b> than it is now. Over the past six to nine million years, as the Challenger Deep grew to its present depth, many of the species present in the sediment of that ancient biosphere were unable to adapt to the increasing water pressure and changing environment. Those species that were able to adapt may have been the ancestors of the organisms currently endemic to the Challenger Deep.|$|E

40|$|<b>Shallow</b> mixing layers are {{commonly}} observed in compound/composite channels, at {{the confluence of}} two rivers, between rivers and harbor entrances, between main channels and groyne fields, etc. The growth of <b>shallow</b> mixing layers determines the lateral exchange of pollutants and sediments and has great practical importance. The development (growth/decay) of a mixing layer is the combined result of the transverse velocity shear and the bottom friction. This thesis {{is devoted to the}} devising of reliable a mathematical model for <b>shallow</b> flows, and improvement of knowledge in the physics of the <b>shallow</b> mixing layers. Based on the BGK Boltzmann equation, a high resolution numerical scheme for horizontal <b>shallow</b> water flows, which is capable of capturing both wave and diffusion, is formulated, verified and evaluated. This model is applied to <b>shallow</b> mixing layers. The applicability of the model to <b>shallow</b> mixing layers is investigated. Linear stability analysis as an initial value problem is applied to <b>shallow</b> mixing layers to investigate the validity of the traditional normal mode analysis for <b>shallow</b> mixing layers.

The major features of the ME-based <b>shallow</b> parser are POSs and the context words in a sentence.

5|$|The Andean Volcanic Belt {{consists}} of three main volcanic zones: the Northern Volcanic Zone (from 2° N to 5° S), the Central Volcanic Zone (16° to 28° S) and the Southern Volcanic Zone (33° to 46° S). Active volcanism occurs where the Nazca Plate subducts beneath the South American Plate. The plates are separated by <b>shallower</b> subduction zones, with no present-day volcanism. These <b>shallower</b> zones {{have been attributed to}} the high speed of the plate collision, the young age of the subducting oceanic lithosphere and the curvature of the subducting plate. The most plausible theory is that variations in buoyancy of a subducting plate creates a flat subduction zone. The Cocos, Juan Fernandez and Nazca Ridges are associated with such volcanic gaps where they collide with the oceanic trench. The subduction of spreading ridges can also diminish volcanism, as observed in the Chile Rise further south. The buoyancy of these crustal structures may hinder subduction, reducing water supply to the mantle and inducing the formation of melts.|$|E
40|$|As <b>shallow</b> reefs {{continue}} to decline, scientists {{are searching for}} the key to their persistence; as it turns out, they may just need {{to look a little}} deeper. Healthy and stable mesophotic coral reef communities are being discovered around the world and inspired the Deep Reef Refugia Hypothesis (DRRH), which suggests that mesophotic reefs are acting as a refuge for depauperate <b>shallow</b> communities by bolstering populations and enhancing sexual reproduction. However, several assumptions of this hypothesis remain untested: (1) vertical and horizontal spatial isolation has not led to reproductively isolated of <b>shallow</b> and deep conspecifics, and (2) larvae generated from deep corals are attracted to and survive in <b>shallow</b> coral reef habitats. This project was conducted on the barrier reef of Belize where the reefs grow along the vertical wall and <b>shallow</b> and mesophotic coral populations are separated by limited horizontal distance. Although 8 microsatellite markers demonstrated no population structure between <b>shallow</b> and mesophotic O. franksi, fine scale morphometric analysis using 25 landmarks revealed clear differences between mesophotic and <b>shallow</b> colonies. Gametes from Orbicella franksi inhabiting the <b>shallow</b> (14 - 20 m) and the upper mesophotic (27 - 32 m) were crossed and found to be compatible. Larvae produced in reciprocal crosses between deep and <b>shallow</b> parents developed normally and were equally viable as larvae obtained from intradepth crosses. While larvae from <b>shallow</b> parents did not exhibit any settlement preference between tiles conditioned at <b>shallow</b> depths versus in the mesophotic zone, there was significantly more mesophotic larvae that preferred to settle on <b>shallow</b> conditioned tiles. Yet, no difference was seen in the post-settlement survival between depths. These results suggest a close coupling between <b>shallow</b> and mesophotic reefs through gamete and larval export that likely play an increasingly vital role in <b>shallow</b> reef persistence and recovery...|$|R
