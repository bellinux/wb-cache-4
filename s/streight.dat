25|$|The Union Army {{occupied}} Tennessee in 1862 and for {{the duration}} of the war, taking control of strategic cities and railroads. Forrest continued to lead his men in small-scale operations until April 1863. The Confederate army dispatched him with a small force into the backcountry of northern Alabama and west Georgia to defend against an attack of 3,000 Union cavalrymen commanded by Colonel Abel <b>Streight.</b> <b>Streight</b> had orders to cut the Confederate railroad south of Chattanooga, Tennessee, to cut off Bragg's supply line and force him to retreat into Georgia. Forrest chased Streight's men for 16 days, harassing them all the way. Streight's goal changed to escape the pursuit. On May 3, Forrest caught up with Streight's unit east of Cedar Bluff, Alabama. Forrest had fewer men than the Union side, but he repeatedly paraded some of them around a hilltop to appear a larger force, and convinced <b>Streight</b> to surrender his 1,500 exhausted troops.|$|E

25|$|After {{his victory}} at Stones River, Rosecrans {{occupied}} Murfreesboro for almost six months while Bragg rested in Tullahoma, establishing a long defensive line that {{was intended to}} block Union advances against the strategic city of Chattanooga in his rear. In April, Union cavalry under Col. Abel <b>Streight</b> moved against the railroad that supplied Bragg's army in Middle Tennessee, hoping it would cause them to withdraw to Georgia. Streight's brigade raided through Mississippi and Alabama, fighting against Nathan Bedford Forrest. Streight's Raid ended when his exhausted men surrendered near Rome, Georgia, on May 3. In June, Rosecrans finally advanced against Bragg in a brilliant, almost bloodless, campaign of maneuver, the Tullahoma Campaign, and drove Bragg from Middle Tennessee.|$|E
50|$|Union {{forces from}} <b>Streight's</b> own 51st Indiana, 73rd Indiana Infantry, 80th Illinois Infantry, and 3rd Ohio Infantry regiments were placed under <b>Streight's</b> command. This force {{encompassed}} approximately 1,700 troops. The original {{intent was to}} have this force mounted suitably for fast travel and attacks; however, due largely to wartime shortages, <b>Streight's</b> brigade were equipped with mules.

2500|$|Rome's {{iron works}} were an {{important}} manufacturing center during the Civil War, supplying many cannons and other armaments to the Confederate effort. In April 1863 {{the city was}} defended by Confederate General Nathan Bedford Forrest against Union Colonel Abel Streight's [...] "lightning mule" [...] raid from the area east of modern-day Cedar Bluff, Alabama. General Forrest tricked Colonel <b>Streight</b> into surrendering {{just a few miles}} shy of Rome. Realizing their vulnerability, Rome's city council had allocated $3,000 to build three fortifications. Although these became operational by October 1863, efforts to strengthen the forts continued as the war progressed. These forts were named after Romans who had been killed in action: Fort Attaway was on the western bank of the Oostanaula River, Fort Norton was on the eastern bank of the Oostanaula, and Fort Stovall was on the southern bank of the Etowah River. The Confederates later built at least one other fort on the northern side of the Coosa River.|$|E

While Dodge's portion of the expedition was successful, <b>Streight's</b> incursion was disastrous. His command performed [...] various engagements thereafter in northwestern Mississippi and West Tennessee. In December, his forces engaged in a skirmish near Rawhide, twelve miles north of Florence, Alabama {{that resulted in the}} capture of 20 prisoners.|$|R
50|$|When {{granted the}} English Royal Charter in 1670 by King Charles II of England, the Hudson’s Bay Company, under the {{governorship}} of the king's cousin Prince Rupert of the Rhine, was granted “the sole Trade and Commerce {{of all those}} Seas, <b>Streights,</b> Bays, Rivers, Lakes, Creeks, and Sounds, in whatsoever Latitude they shall be, that lie within {{the entrance of the}} <b>Streights</b> commonly called Hudson's <b>Streights,</b> together with all the Lands, Countries and Territories, upon the Coasts and Confines of the Seas, <b>Streights,</b> Bays, Lakes, Rivers, Creeks and Sounds, aforesaid, which are not now actually possessed by any of our Subjects, or by the Subjects of any other Christian Prince or State”, “and that the said Land be from henceforth reckoned and reputed as one of our Plantations or Colonies in America, called Rupert's Land.” The Royal Charter made the “Governor and Company …, and their Successors, the true and absolute Lords and Proprietors, of the same Territory, Limits and Places aforesaid, and of all other the Premisses sic,” and granted them the authority “to erect and build such Castles, Fortifications, Forts, Garrisons, Colonies or Plantations, Towns or Villages, in any Parts or Places within the Limits and Bounds granted before in these Presents, unto the said Governor and Company, as they in their Discretion shall think fit and requisite.” Following merger with the North West Company in 1821, the Hudson’s Bay Company’s monopoly privileges and licence were extended to trade over the whole of British North America by including a region called the North-Western Territory.|$|R

2500|$|During {{the winter}} and spring, both sides {{occupied}} themselves with their favoriteand generally profitlesspractice of sending cavalry on raids. Almost a third of Bragg's army consisted of cavalry16,000 effectives versus about 9,000 Union. In a February raid against Fort Donelson (the Battle of Dover) Confederate Maj. Gen. Joseph Wheeler, commanding two brigades of cavalry, failed to capture the garrison in Dover, Tennessee or disrupt Union shipping on the Cumberland River. In March, Rosecrans sent a detachment to cut Bragg's communications, but it was forced to surrender in the Battle of Thompson's Station. Also in March, Confederate Brig. Gen. Nathan Bedford Forrest raided Rosecrans's communications at Brentwood, a station on the Nashville & Decatur Railroad, in the Battle of Brentwood. Confederate Brig. Gen. John Hunt Morgan made his famous raid into Indiana and Ohio, an operation that cavalry historian Stephen Z. Starr called [...] "militarily insane", that ended in Morgan's capture. Confederate Maj. Gen. Earl Van Dorn who was brought into the Army of Tennessee's area of operation by Johnston, was unsure of his mission, {{in which he was}} supposed to take position, and of who would serve under him. He was unsuccessful in cutting Rosecrans's communications between February and May, with raids that included two minor cavalry fights north of Spring Hill in March, and Forrest's pursuit and capture of Col. Abel <b>Streight</b> in Streight's Raid in Alabama in April. In May, Van Dorn was murdered and Forrest assumed command of the cavalry on Bragg's left flank; most of Van Dorn's Mississippi troopers were transferred back to their home state in May. The Confederates lost 4,000 cavalrymen during this period but did cause Rosecrans some concern over his supply lines. The Union lost 3,300 men and received little in return.|$|E
2500|$|Although Bethlem {{had been}} {{enlarged}} by 1667 to accommodate 59 patients, the Court of Governors of Bethlem and Bridewell observed {{at the start}} of 1674 that [...] "the Hospitall House of Bethlem is very olde, weake & ruinous and to small and <b>streight</b> for keepeing the greater numbr of lunaticks therein att psent". With the increasing demand for admission and the inadequate and dilapidated state of the building it was decided to rebuild the hospital in Moorfields, just north of the city proper and one of the largest open spaces in London. The architect chosen for the new hospital, which was built rapidly and at great expense between 1675 and 1676, was the natural philosopher and City Surveyor Robert Hooke. He constructed an edifice that was monumental in scale at over [...] wide and some [...] deep. The surrounding walls were some [...] long and [...] deep while the south face at the rear was effectively screened by a 714-foot (218 m) stretch of London's ancient wall projecting westward from nearby Moorgate. At the rear and containing the courtyards where patients exercised and took the air, the walls rose to [...] high. The front walls were only [...] high but this was deemed sufficient as it was determined that [...] "Lunatikes... are not to [...] permitted to walk in the yard to be situate betweene the said intended new Building and the Wall aforesaid." [...] It was also hoped that by keeping these walls relatively low the splendour of the new building would not be overly obscured. This concern to maximise the building's visibility led to the addition of six gated openings [...] wide which punctuated the front wall at regular intervals, enabling views of the facade. [...] Functioning as both advertisement and warning of what lay within, the stone pillars enclosing the entrance gates were capped by the figures of [...] "Melancholy" [...] and [...] "Raving Madness" [...] carved in Portland stone by the Danish-born sculptor Caius Gabriel Cibber.|$|E
