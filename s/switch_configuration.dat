We construct an analogy between <b>switch</b> <b>configurations</b> and the codewords of certain error control codes for which we use space covering ideas to derive relations between speedup and number of <b>switch</b> <b>configurations.</b> To derive the necessary speedup for nonblocking, we use two sphere packing bounds: the Hamming bound and the Gilbert–Varshamov bound. To construct nonblocking switches with a given speedup we use maximum distance separable codes. We consider both multicast and point to point scenarios.
