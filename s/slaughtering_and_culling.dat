40|$|Recent {{international}} {{developments in}} the area of infectious disease control and nontariff trade barriers, along with possible zoonotic concerns, have provoked a revival of interest in Johne’s disease in Canada and elsewhere. The bacterium causing Johne’s disease, Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis, is distributed worldwide and causes chronic granulomatous enteritis, also known as paratuberculosis, in domestic and exotic ruminants, including cattle. The subclinical form of this disease results in progressive weight loss, reduced milk production, lower <b>slaughter</b> value, <b>and</b> premature <b>culling,</b> with possible impacts on fertility and udder health. Eventually, infection can lead to the clinical form that manifests as chronic diarrhea, emaciation, debilitation, and eventual death. Currently, available tests to detect infected animals produce many false-negative results and some false-positives, particularly in subclinically infected animals, thus making their interpretation and utilization challenging in control programs...|$|R
40|$|Part I of this 2 -part review {{examined}} the clinical stages, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and epidemiology of Johne’s disease, providing information relevant to Canada, where available. In Part II, {{a critical review}} of the economic impacts of the disease, risk factors, and important control measures are presented to enable Canadian bovine practitioners to successfully implement control strategies and participate in control programs. In cattle positive by enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay, there is a 2. 4 times increase {{in the risk of}} their being <b>culled,</b> <b>and</b> their lactational 305 -day milk production is decreased by at least 370 kg. Reduced <b>slaughter</b> value <b>and</b> premature <b>culling</b> account for losses of CDN$ 1330 per year per infected 50 -cow herd. Research has failed to show a consistent association between Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis test status and reduced fertility or risk of clinical or subclinical mastitis. Host level factors include age and level of exposure, along with source of exposure, such as manure, colostrum, or milk. Agent factors involve the dose of infectious agent and strains of bacteria. Environmental management factors influence the persistence of the bacteria and the level of contamination in the environment. Emphasizing a risk factor approach, various control strategies are reviewed, including a number of national control programs currently in place throughout the world, specifically Australia, The Netherlands, and the United States. By reviewing the scientific literature about Johne’s disease, control of the disease could be pursued through informed implementation of rational biosecurity efforts and the strategic use of testing <b>and</b> <b>culling...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to: l) determine the contribution of federal land grazing to beef production in Utah and the 11 western states, and 2) trace the impact of hypothetical incremental reductions in federal land grazing in the 11 western states on total beef supply and retail beef prices in the United States. The federal land animal units in the 11 western states were obtained from Bureau of Land Management and Forest Service records. The animal units were converted into the number of breeding cows and feeder calves totally dependent on federal land grazing, with the help of animal units per breeding cow. The animal units per breeding cow were calculated from a representative stock count chart of a typical 50 cow Utah ranch. The same chart provided percentage proportions of the number of calves and feeder calves. These feeder calves are the animals that originate and are totally dependent on federal lands. The minimum contribution of federal land grazing in the 11 western states to total beef supply in the United States ranges between dressed beef from feeder calves <b>and</b> <b>cull</b> cows on one end, <b>and</b> <b>slaughter</b> animals <b>and</b> <b>cull</b> cows on the other. The actual minimum contribution is somewhere to the middle of these extremes. The hypothetical incremental reductions in federal land grazing were calculated in terms of percentage {{reduction in the number of}} cows, calves and feeder calves, and the resultant decreases in beef tonnage on the lower and upper limits of minimum contribution of these lands to total beef supply in the United States. These reductions in beef supply were compared to total United States 2 ̆ 7 beef supply and reductions in total beef supply were estimated in percentage. To estimate the economic and other impacts on individual ranchers, local communities and regional economy, the feed grain in corn equivalents and forage production were compared to livestock and poultry requirements in the 11 western states. It appears that Utah is deficient both in feed grain and roughage production as compared to requirements. The 11 western states as a group were surplus in 1974 in both feed grain and roughage production as compared to livestock and poultry requirements. The contribution of federal lands in roughage production was also estimated. The importance of federal rangelands 2 ̆ 7 contribution, in my study is only 25 percent of total roughage production in the 11 western states and is discussed in the light of other benefits that would be lost if grazing were eliminated from federal lands. Lastly, the impact of reduction in federal grazing in the 11 western states on retail beef prices was estimated by using the concept of price elasticity of demand. It was concluded that an increasingly higher percentage increase in retail prices would occur for given percentage decreases in beef supply (by way of hypothetical incremental reduction in federal land grazing) for increasingly inelastic coefficients of elasticity...|$|R

40|$|Economic losses due to cattle {{mortality}} <b>and</b> <b>culling</b> have {{a substantial}} impact on the feedlot industry. Since criteria for <b>culling</b> may vary <b>and</b> may affect measures of cumulative mortality within cattle cohorts, {{it is important to}} assess both mortality <b>and</b> <b>culling</b> when evaluating cattle losses over time and among feedlots. To date, there are no published multivariable assessments of factors associated with combined mortality <b>and</b> <b>culling</b> risk. Our objective was to evaluate combined mortality <b>and</b> <b>culling</b> losses in feedlot cattle cohorts and quantify effects of commonly measured cohort-level risk factors (weight at feedlot arrival, gender, and month of feedlot arrival) using data routinely collected by commercial feedlots. We used retrospective data representing 8, 904, 965 animals in 54, 416 cohorts from 16 U. S. feedlots from 2000 to 2007. The sum of mortality <b>and</b> <b>culling</b> counts for each cohort (given the number of cattle at risk) was used to generate the outcome of interest, the cumulative incidence of combined mortality <b>and</b> <b>culling.</b> Associations between this outcome variable and cohort-level risk factors were evaluated using a mixed effects multivariable negative binomial regression model with random effects for feedlot, year, month and week of arrival. Mean arrival weight of the cohort, gender, and arrival month and a three-way interaction (and corresponding two-way interactions) among arrival weight, gender and month were significantly (P < 0. 05) associated with the outcome. Results showed that as the mean arrival weight of the cohort increased, mortality <b>and</b> <b>culling</b> risk decreased, but effects of arrival weight were modified both by the gender of the cohort and the month of feedlot arrival. There was a seasonal pattern in combined mortality <b>and</b> <b>culling</b> risk for light and middleweight male and female cohorts, with a significantly (P < 0. 05) higher risk for cattle arriving at the feedlot in spring and summer (March–September) than in cattle arriving during fall, and winter months (November–February). Our results quantified effects of covariate patterns that have been heretofore difficult to fully evaluate in smaller scale studies; in addition, they illustrated the importance of utilizing multivariable approaches when quantifying risk factors in heterogeneous feedlot populations. Estimated effects from our model could be useful for managing financial risks associated with adverse health events based on data that are routinely available...|$|R

Little is known of the dynamics of this novel virus in poultry and human populations, which is essential for developing effective long-term control strategies for this zoonosis. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the impact of screening <b>and</b> <b>culling</b> of infected poultry on the evolution of the H 7 N 9 epidemic. Methods: A mathematical model for transmission dynamics of avian influenza A H 7 N 9 virus in human and poultry populations was constructed. Parameters in the model were estimated using publicly available nationwide surveillance data on animal and human infections. Results: By fitting a two-host model, it was shown that screening for H 7 N 9 in poultry <b>and</b> <b>culling</b> could effectively decrease the number of new human H 7 N 9 cases. Furthermore, the elimination of circulating H 7 N 9 virus is possible if an intensive, but technically feasible, poultry screening <b>and</b> <b>culling</b> policy is adopted. Conclusions: Screening <b>and</b> <b>culling</b> infected poultry is a critical measure for preventing human H 7 N 9 infections in the long term.

Carcass characteristics were measured at 24 h postmortem for 75 carcasses from 5 populations consisting of cull beef cows commercially identified as fed (B-F, n = 15); cull beef cows commercially identified as nonfed (B-NF, n = 15); cull dairy cows commercially identified as fed (D-F, n = 15); cull dairy cows commercially identified as nonfed (D-NF, n = 15); and A-maturity, USDA Select grade steers (SEL, n = 15). Nine muscles were excised from each carcass [m. infraspinatus, m. triceps brachii (lateral and long heads), m. teres major, m. longissimus dorsi (also termed LM), m. psoas major, m. gluteus medius, m. rectus femoris, and m. tensor fasciae latae] and subjected to Warner-Bratzler shear force testing and objective sensory panel evaluation after 14 d of postmortem aging. Carcass characteristics differed (P 2 ̆ 6 #; 2 ̆ 6 #; 0. 05) among the 5 commercially identified slaughter groups for the traits of lean maturity, bone maturity, muscle score, HCW, fat color, subjective lean color, marbling, ribeye area, 12 th-rib fat thickness, and preliminary yield grade. Carcasses from commercially identified, fed cull cows exhibited more (P 2 ̆ 6 #; 2 ̆ 6 #; 0. 01) weight in carcass lean than did commercially identified, nonfed cull cows. There was a group 2 ̆ 6 #; 2 ̆ 6 #;muscle interaction (P = 0. 02) for Warner-Bratzler shear force. Warner-Bratzler shear force and sensory overall tenderness values demonstrates that muscles from the SEL group were the most tender (P 2 ̆ 6 #; 2 ̆ 6 #; 0. 01), whereas muscles from the BNF group were the least tender (P 2 ̆ 6 #; 2 ̆ 6 #; 0. 01).

40|$|At 9 abattoirs {{throughout}} the state, samples of blood, {{liver and kidney}} were collected from the three cattle categories (cull dairy cows, <b>cull</b> beef cows <b>and</b> finished steers) at slaughter. In all, 2612 cattle were sampled for the following assays: copper (Cu), haemoglobin (Hb) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx, a selenoenzyme) on whole blood, inorganic iodine (I) in plasma, and Cu in liver and Selenium (Se) in a subset of liver and kidneys. The survey documented the overall status of Cu, I and Se in Irish cattle at <b>slaughter</b> <b>and</b> compared the trace element status of three categories of cattle. It also {{examined the effects of}} housing / season (late spring versus late autumn). I deficiency was the most prevalent mineral deficiency in all three bovine categories. Overall, in spite of whatever supplementation was being used preslaughter, 69 % of samples had low (< 50 µg/L) plasma inorganic I status (51 % at the end of spring, 84 % at the end of autumn). Overall, in spite of whatever supplementation was being used preslaughter, liver Cu status was low (2, {{with a wide range of}} error (0. 9 - 2. 6 times). However, as liver biopsy seldom is a practical option in commercial herds, blood tests usually are used for routine assessment of mineral status in live cattle. GPx levels in whole blood closely reflect blood Se status. In spite of whatever supplementation was being used preslaughter, blood GPx status was low (< 40 iu/g Hb) in 11 % of samples (4 % at the end of spring, 16 % at the end of autumn). In a subset of the data, blood GPx and Se levels in bovine kidney and liver had positive linear relationships but predictability was poor. A similar conclusion applies to levels of Se in liver and kidney. Also, liver Se correlated better with blood GPx (R 2 = 0. 443) than with kidney Se (R 2 = 0. 264). Cattle slaughtered off grass in late autumn had lower Cu, I and Se status than those slaughtered out of sheds in late spring. Finished beef steers <b>and</b> <b>cull</b> suckler cows had lower Cu and Se status than cull dairy cows. Liver and kidney had few high Cu or Se levels, indicating that current inputs of minerals do not pose a threat of toxicity to cattle, or to the human food chain. Mean PII levels in dairy cows were too low to pose a threat of excessive milk I levels for human consumption. Other research at Grange shows that trace element supplementation and trace element status in bovine blood, especially from dairy cows, improved nationally in recent years. However, this survey shows clearly that current national inputs of Cu, I and Se are inadequate to maintain normal trace element status in finished steers <b>and</b> <b>cull</b> (especially beef) cows at slaughter. This report concludes that current national inputs of Cu, I and Se are inadequate to maintain normal trace element status in finished steers <b>and</b> <b>cull</b> (especially beef) cows at <b>slaughter,</b> <b>and</b> from current inputs, the risk of Cu or Se toxicity to cattle, or to the human food chain, is minimal.
