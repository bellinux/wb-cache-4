Present-day critics have focussed increasingly on the Carry Brattle subplot; it has been suggested, <b>supported</b> <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>by</b> the similarity of passages from The Vicar, from the Autobiography, and from The Small House at Allington referring to Johnny Eames, that some aspects of her portrayal {{are based on the}} novelist's own early adulthood in London.|$|E

5|$|Port Republic Road was widened by {{the city}} of Harrisonburg to four lanes from US 11 to I-81 in 1994, from I-81 to Neff Avenue in 2004, and from Neff Avenue to the city limit by 2006. Port Republic Road in the city of Harrisonburg and SR 659 in Rockingham County from the city to US 340 were {{transferred}} from the secondary system to the primary highway system as SR 253 by a resolution passed by the Commonwealth Transportation Board on March 17, 2005. The transfer was <b>supported</b> <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>by</b> the planned relocation of Rockingham Memorial Hospital from north of the James Madison University campus in the city to southeast of the city in Rockingham County, a process that began in 2004 and was completed when the hospital opened in 2010. SR 253 was expanded to a four-lane divided highway from SR 704 (Boyers Road) north to the city limit, thus connecting with the four-lane highway built {{by the city}}, starting in early 2010. The expansion project was completed in early 2012, although the new divided highway opened to traffic in June 2011. The project included construction of a small piece of SR 280a highway planned as the Southeast Connector that is intended to connect SR 42, US 11, SR 253, and US 33 south of Harrisonburgat its intersection with SR 253 next to Rockingham Memorial Hospital.|$|E

The single defender {{was known as the}} three-quarter-back, and he was <b>supported</b> <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>by</b> two half-backs from mid-field who would be in charge of orchestrating the game with short passing. Up front, the seven forwards were split into four wing forwards and three centre forwards.

Dulcie remained unmarried, sold the home and began a boarding house for single women.

25|$|Agriculture and {{livestock}} have been traditionally {{important for the}} state, and while it only provides about four percent of the state’s GDP, down from eighteen percent in 1970, it employs a far larger percentage of the population, with it being {{the basis of the}} economy in many rural areas. 28.24% of state land is used for agriculture, mostly raising corn, wheat, alfalfa, sorghum and squash. There is also intensive farming in areas of a number of important crops. Much of the large scale farming is irrigated and is <b>supported</b> <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>by</b> the state government, with loans and help with infrastructure such as water and roads. However, most farmland is seasonal, meaning it is worked only during the rainy season. Grains such as barley, wheat, oats and alfalfa are almost exclusively planted on irrigated land along with certain vegetables such as broccoli, garlic, carrots, lettuce, onions and cauliflower. Most nonirrigated land is planted with corn, followed by beans mostly for auto or local consumption. Leading cash crops are beans, cabbage, alfalfa, onions, lettuce and sorghum.|$|E
