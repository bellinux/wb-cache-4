50|$|Amphiprion melanopus, {{also known}} as the {{cinnamon}} clownfish, red and black anemonefish, black-backed anemonefish or dusky anemonefish is a widely distributed anemonefish chiefly found in the western and southern parts of the Pacific Ocean.. The <b>species</b> <b>scientific</b> <b>name</b> 'melanopus' is Greek, meaning black feet in reference to the black pelvic fins. Like all anemonefishes it forms a symbiotic mutualism with sea anemones and is unaffected by the stinging tentacles of the host anemone. It is a sequential hermaphrodite with a strict sized based dominance hierarchy: the female is largest, the breeding male is second largest, and the male non-breeders get progressively smaller as the hierarchy descends. They exhibit protandry, meaning the breeding male will change to female if the sole breeding female dies, with the largest non-breeder becomes the breeding male.|$|E

40|$|An {{inventory}} of angiosperm flora of Satchari National Park, located in Habiganj district, is prepared {{on the basis}} of collected materials and observation made from November 2008 to December 2009. From the study site, 245 angiosperm species including cultivated and planted in 183 genera under 72 families are documented. Of 245 species recorded here, 86 species are represented by herbs, 46 by shrubs, 73 by trees, 37 by climbers and 3 by epiphytes. The survey has also confirmed the occurrence of seven threatened angiosperm species, one tree fern and one gynosperm in the Park area. For each <b>species</b> <b>scientific</b> <b>name,</b> local name (wherever available), family, habit and habitat are provided with citation of specimens...|$|E

40|$|In {{the domain}} of {{biological}} classification there are several taxon name matching services that can search for a <b>species</b> <b>scientific</b> <b>name</b> in a large collection of taxonomic names. Many of these services are available online, and many others run on computers of individual scientists. While these systems may work very well, most suffer {{from the fact that}} the list of names used as a reference, and the criteria to decide on a match, are hard-coded in the engine that performs the name matching. In this paper we present BiOnym, a taxon name matching system that separates reference names lists, search criteria and matching engine. The user is offered a choice of several taxonomic reference lists, including the option to upload his/her own list onto the system. Furthermore, BiOnym is a flexible workow, which embeds and combines techniques using lexical matching algorithms as well as expert knowledge. It is also an open platform allowing developers to contribute with new techniques. In this paper we demonstrate the benefits brought by this approach in terms of the efficiency and effectiveness of the information retrieval process with respect to other solutions...|$|E
40|$|The {{easiest way}} to locate {{references}} in a PDF file is by clicking on the binocular icon on the tool bar and then typing in a heading. When located keep clicking next to find all subject matter relating to the topic requested. References are both general and specific so when searching for topics such as egg-binding these will appear under a general section and also in a species account if it relates directly to that species. CLASSIFICATION Follows the revised 3 rd edition of A Complete Checklist of the Birds of the World by R. Howard and A. Moore published by Helm in 2003. <b>Species</b> <b>scientific</b> <b>name</b> and relationships have conformed to this but as the Parrot Society Magazine index is avicultural in content some leeway is given. For example Trichoglossus haematodus has been split to conform with the latest views but in several instances where subspecies are now considered invalid these are still given entries under their original avicultural name. SUBSPECIES Where subspecies have historically been designated a common name entries reflect this by being given their own entry otherwise they are bracketed under the main species. See Yellow-streaked and Black Lory for examples. AVICULTURAL NAMES Those presently in common usage in the UK are used with the odd exception. Where articles have been published originating from countries such as Australia and America those name are given along-side those in common usage in the UK. Lack of space precludes all available alternatives being included. MUTATIONS Where {{there are only a}} limited number of references to mutations these are incorporated into the main body of references only if it does not confuse the issue, otherwise they are given their own space at the end of each species entry. Layout for mutations may vary but is done solely to eliminate confusion...|$|E
