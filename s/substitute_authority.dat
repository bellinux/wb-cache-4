In 1996 the name was changed to the current one.The OPC views heritage as a public service and as a factor in territorial development on a local and regional scale. Therefore, it bases its action on the principles of bringing management closer to the people and <b>substituting</b> <b>authority</b> with cooperation.

This paper examines accounting's role in controlling the firm to ensure resources are put to their highest-value use. Accounting, together with employment contracts, compensation arrangements, debt contracts, internal and external auditors, and the board of directors including its audit and compensation committees comprise a package of mechanisms that have evolved to govern the firm. These institutional devices become the firm's efficient contracting technology. As accounting is part of that contracting technology, the accounting controls and systems that evolve and get implemented are efficient and the accounting methods that are used in calculating the numbers that form part of the firm's contractual arrangements are, likewise, efficient.

For example, marriage ages in Medieval England varied depending on economic circumstances, with couples delaying marriage until their early twenties when times were bad, but might marry in their late teens after the Black Death, when there was a severe labour shortage; by appearances, marriage of adolescents was not the norm in England.|$|R

A broad-based Islamist party, the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) was born shortly afterwards in Algiers on 18 February 1989, and came into legal existence in September 1989. The front was led by two men. Abbassi Madani—a professor at University of Algiers and ex-independence fighter—represented a relatively moderate religious conservatism and symbolically connected the party to the Algerian War of Independence, the traditionally emphasized source of the ruling FLN's legitimacy. His aim was to [...] "Islamise the regime without altering society's basic fabric." [...] Ali Benhadj, a charismatic preacher and high school teacher appealed to a younger and less educated class. An impassioned orator, he {{was known for his}} ability to both enrage or calm at will {{the tens of thousands of}} young hittiestes who came to hear him speak. However, his radical speeches and opposition to democratic rule alarmed non-Islamists and feminists. Neither Madani or Benhadj were committed to democracy. In December 1989 Madani was quoted as saying:We do not accept this democracy which permits an elected official to be in contradiction with Islam, the Shari'a, its doctrines and values. and in February 1989, Benhadj stated:There is no democracy because the only source of power is Allah through the Koran, and not the people.

No doubt it is a good plan sometimes to let the child decide for himself, but when you pretend to allow him to decide let him do it really. When you go out with him to take a walk, if it is so nearly immaterial which way you go that you are willing that he should determine the question, then lay the case before him, giving him {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} the different ways, and let him decide; and then act according to his decision. But if you have determined in your own mind which way to go, simply announce your determination; and if you give reasons at all, do not give them in such a way as to convey the idea to his mind that his obligation to submit is to rest partly on his seeing the force of them. For every parent will find that this principle is a sound one and one of fundamental importance in the successful management of children--namely, that it is much easier for a child to do what he does not like to do as an act of simple submission to superior authority, than for him to bring himself to an accordance with the decision by hearing and considering the reasons. In other words, it is much easier for him to obey your decision than to bring himself to the same decision against his own will.|$|R

In most of Western Europe, later marriage and higher rates of definitive celibacy (the so-called [...] "European marriage pattern") helped to constrain patriarchy at its most extreme level. The rise of Christianity and manorialism had both created incentives to keep families nuclear and thus the age of marriage increased; the Western Church instituted marriage laws and practices that undermined large kinship groups. From {{as early as the}} 4th century, the Church discouraged any practice that enlarged the family, like adoption, polygamy, taking concubines, divorce, and remarriage. The Church severely discouraged and prohibited consanguineous marriages, a marriage pattern that has constituted a means to maintain clans (and thus their power) throughout history. The church also forbade marriages in which the bride did not clearly agree to the union. After the Fall of Rome, manorialism also helped weakened the ties of kinship and thus the power of clans; as early as the 9th century in Austrasia, families that worked on manors were small, consisting of parents and children and occasionally a grandparent. The Church and state had become allies in erasing the solidarity and thus the political power of the clans; the Church sought to replace traditional religion, whose vehicle was the kin group, and <b>substituting</b> the <b>authority</b> of the elders of the kin group with that of a religious elder; at the same time, the king's rule was undermined by revolts {{on the part of the}} most powerful kin groups, clans or sections, whose conspiracies and murders threatened the power of the state and also the demand of manorial lords for obedient, compliant workers.

This thesis {{investigates the}} conceptions {{of love and}} the descriptions of the beloved in the poetries of Nazim Hikmet and Cegerxwin, two socialist poets of Turkish and Kurdish languages respectively, with a particular focus on the poets’ relationships to their traditional literatures and the ideological meanings that they attributed to love and the beloved. I first provide information about the political and literary climate against which Nazim Hikmet and Cegerxwin produced their works in order for locating each poet within their respective literary traditions. Then, I focus on the poets’ relationships to tradition and on the main features of their poetries as a background to investigate the ideological dimensions of their understandings of love. Nazim Hikmet’s letters to Piraye involves reappropriations of the imageries of love from the Islamic mystical poetry. I read this as the poet’s attempt to transform divine love into material love. Moreover, rather than emphasizing the physical beauty of the beloved, Nazim Hikmet portrayed his beloved {{with reference to the}} social reality of which she was a part. This was a move that challenged the understandings of love reflected in both the Divan poetry and Turkish poetry in the process of modernization. Furthermore, Nazim Hikmet offered segments from the lives other people as constitutive elements of his treatment of the relationships between the lover and the beloved. From a socialist perspective, thus, Nazim Hikmet articulated a conception of the personal relationship as a medium through which to attain the social and the universal. This study reveals that Cegerxwin also challenged and transformed the way love is treated in the classical Kurdish poetry in a similar vein. On the one hand, Cegerxwin added modern images to the classical metaphors of love. On the other hand, he adopted a materialist understanding of love by exposing the sexuality of the beloved. Cegerxwin also transformed the type of lover: In contrast to the passive image of the lover that permeates the classical Kurdish poetry, Cigerxwin’s lovers are active agents within the Kurdish nation-making process. Besides these, Cigerxwin made the national homeland the subject of love: Cast as the female body at which male love and desire is directed, homeland appears as the object of love in Cigerxwin’s poems. The thesis concludes that beneath Nazim Hikmet’s and Cegerxwin’s negations of the Islamic mystical love, there lied a rejection of traditional forms of authority. While Nazim Hikmet <b>substituted</b> traditional <b>authority</b> with social consciousness, Cegerxwin put forward the principle of national sovereginty in its stead. Yekdeş, Ömer FarukM. S...|$|R

40|$|The Book of Margery Kempe is primarily, {{and most}} importantly, a manual of spiritual {{instruction}} mediated {{through the body}} and voice of an illiterate female mystic. Excluded by her gender and her illiteracy from the ecclesiastical traditions of auctoritas, Margery Kempe largely relies upon visual and oral learning and her female experience to create her own parallel auctoritas in her spiritual autobiography. Kempe 2 ̆ 7 s text centralizes female maternal, sexual, and social experience as its mystical locus and validates that experience as a corollary to her spiritual teaching. Through its contextualization of prevalent themes in affective mysticism, of the iconographic and textual motifs of affective piety, and of the influences of late medieval heterodoxies, The Book of Margery Kempe translates Kempe 2 ̆ 7 s mysticism into spiritual instruction and presents Kempe as a spiritual auctor. Margery Kempe 2 ̆ 7 s tears, visions, and locutions mark her as a mystical medium for God 2 ̆ 7 s message of contrition and conversion. The textual and iconographic traditions of affective piety become Kempe 2 ̆ 7 s textual metaphors, mnemonic devices, and corporeal links. The process of seeing and hearing books read to her, Kempe 2 ̆ 7 s primary venue of oral learning, <b>substitutes</b> for the <b>authority</b> of literacy in her Book.

It is an open secret, that the memorial is put forth as a counterblast to a manifestation of opinion of a contrary character, on the part of certain members of the same ecclesiastical body, who therefore have, as I suppose, an equal right to declare themselves [...] "stewards of the Lord and recipients of the Holy Ghost." [...] In fact, the stream of tendency towards Naturalism, the course of which I have briefly traced, has, of late years, flowed so strongly, that even the Churches have begun, I dare not say to drift, but, at any rate, to swing at their moorings. Within the pale of the Anglican establishment, I venture to doubt, whether, at this moment, there are as many thorough-going defenders of [...] "plenary inspiration" [...] as there were timid questioners of that doctrine, half a century ago. Commentaries, sanctioned by the highest authority, give up the [...] "actual historical truth" [...] of the cosmogonical and diluvial narratives. University professors of deservedly high repute accept the critical decision that the Hexateuch is a compilation, in which the share of Moses, either as author or as editor, is not quite so clearly demonstrable as it might be; highly placed Divines tell us that the pre-Abrahamic Scripture narratives may be ignored; that the book of Daniel may be regarded as a patriotic romance of {23} the second century B.C.; that the words of the writer of the fourth Gospel are not always to be distinguished from those which he puts into the mouth of Jesus. Conservative, but conscientious, revisers decide that whole passages, some of dogmatic and some of ethical importance, are interpolations. An uneasy sense of the weakness of the dogma of Biblical infallibility seems to be {{at the bottom of a}} prevailing tendency once more to <b>substitute</b> the <b>authority</b> of the [...] "Church" [...] for that of the Bible. In my old age, it has happened to me to be taken to task for regarding Christianity as a [...] "religion of a book" [...] as gravely as, in my youth, I should have been reprehended for doubting that proposition. It is a no less interesting symptom that the State Church seems more and more anxious to repudiate all complicity with the principles of the Protestant Reformation and to call itself [...] "Anglo-Catholic." [...] Inspiration, deprived of its old intelligible sense, is watered down into a mystification. The Scriptures are, indeed, inspired; but they contain a wholly undefined and indefinable [...] "human element"; and this unfortunate intruder is converted into a sort of biblical whipping boy. Whatsoever scientific investigation, historical or physical, proves to be erroneous, the [...] "human element" [...] bears the blame; while the divine inspiration of such statements, as by their nature are out of reach of proof or disproof, is still asserted with all the vigour inspired by conscious safety from attack. Though the proposal to treat the Bible [...] "like any other book" [...] which caused so much {24} scandal, forty years ago, may not yet be generally accepted, and though Bishop Colenso's criticisms may still lie, formally, under ecclesiastical ban, yet the Church has not wholly turned a deaf ear to the voice of the scientific tempter; and many a coy divine, while [...] "crying I will ne'er consent," [...] has consented to the proposals of that scientific criticism which the memorialists renounce and denounce.|$|R

Characteristics of the milieu of the modern child are absurdity, chaos, secularism and horizontalism, loneliness, materialism and industrialism tend to depersonalize modern man. Relativism leads to a hyperdynamic and pluriform culture. Prevailing philosophies (existentialism and neo-positivism on one hand and nee-empiricism and nee-realism on the other) determine and dominate contemporary thought. This is the background against which children have to receive religious education nowadays. Contemporary tendencies confront teacher, parent and catechist with problems which demand an answer. 2. The origin of modern existentialist theology: Modern existentialist theology has its origin in the old Gnostics and the "Aufklarung", especially the positivism of Lessing and the anti-metaphysical conclusions of Kant. The search for a concept of reality developed into phenomenology, nee-positivism, neo-realism and secularism. Hegelian dialectics and existentialism with their anti-metaphysical tendencies and anthropocentrism were the cradle of the "new" theology. Contributory factors are the emerging natural and technical sciences, historical criticism, Barthianism, Bible criticism, pietism, nineteenth century modernism, contemporary problems of Biblical interpretation for modern man and the relative neglect by the church of "secular" matters. 3. The nature of ecistentialist theology: The Bible is regarded as mythological writing that needs to be interpreted existentially in {{order to be}} comprehensible to modern man. Jesus is conceived of as a human model and not as Saviour. Radicalists plead for the abandonment of religion by the church. For them the church is an altruistic institution for the advancement of human happiness and welfare in this world. Love for one's fellowman is considered to be the sole standard of morality. 4. The implications of existentialist theology for religious education: Recent years have seen the publication of some text-books and educational articles on religious education, which reveal undeniable features of existentialist theology. In Chapter 4 of this thesis a few of these books and articles are discussed as examples of the influence on religious education of the "new" theology. 5. Critical evaluation of existentialist tendencies: in theology and religious education. Modern theology has many valuable contributions to make to religious education, summoning us to responsicle faith in God, demanding a greater interest in man and his world, giving Christ a central position in religion, opening up new perspectives of the human element in Holy Scripture and disclosing the dangers of a purely conventional religious attitude. On the other hand, modern theology contains many negative and dangerous elements. It is humanistic, dualistic and superficial. Atheism is a direct result of the abandonment of religion. Religion disappears in love of one's fellow man and for Christology and Pneumatology the "new" theologians <b>substitute</b> anthropology. The <b>authority</b> of the Bible is denied while the concrete is absolutized and; idolized. If the church agreed to become merely a welfare organisation, it would lose the true message of the Gospel. 6. The correct understanding and interpretation of Holy Scripture: Modern theology compels the teacher to ascertain what the writers of the Bible were saying to the people of their own day. Modern theology also requires the teacher to declare the eternal truths contained in Holy Scripture and to expound its character as the Word of the living God for the present time. To aid the teacher in interpreting the Bible intelligibly to modern children, Chapter 6 of this thesis presents some hermeneutic principles which take into account the socio-historical background as well as the purpose and real meaning of the respective pericopes. 7. Other methodological and didactic guidelines for an intelligible religious education for the present time: Chapter 7 of this thesis presents methodological and didactic guidelines for the teacher in religious education, such as will help him to avoid the adverse and will enable him to utilise the beneficial elements in the new theological tendencies. The author pleads for real Christian emphasis in the teaching of all school subjects, for purposeful religious education, for actuality and existential experience of the Biblical subject matter for education towards responsibility for stimulation of independent thinking, for implementation of meaningful exercises, for accentuation of perceptivity rather than objective knowledge and memory, for involvement of the scholar in the truths he is learning, for development of a proper conception of the unity of Scripture, for understanding of the child in his situation, for cogent proclamation of the risen Christ (also to be seen in the lives of his modern disciples) and for education in compassion for one's suffering fellow man.
