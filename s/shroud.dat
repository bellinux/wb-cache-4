5|$|The <b>Shroud</b> Exhibit And Museum, {{located in}} White Sands Mall, showcases a {{full-sized}} back-lit photographic transparency of the <b>Shroud</b> of Turin, a religious relic believed {{by some to}} be the burial cloth of Jesus Christ. They also feature a working VP8 Image Analyzer, {{the only one in the}} world where one can walk in and interact with this old analog computer. This town was founded the same year (1898) that Secundo Pia took the first photograph of the <b>Shroud</b> which started the modern investigation into the <b>Shroud.</b> This is highlighted in the museum. In 1977 in Albuquerque, they held the conference that resulted in the 1978 study of the <b>Shroud</b> with more scientists from New Mexico than any other state. The displayed photograph was created from the 1978 photographs made by Barrie M. Schwortz as part of the <b>Shroud</b> of Turin Research Project (STURP). The displays include historical background materials, scientific information, kiosks with a variety of information, videos available for viewing and an exhibit of electronic image analysis of the <b>shroud,</b> among other interesting artifacts.|$|E
5|$|Occasionally, {{radiocarbon}} dating techniques date {{an object of}} popular interest, for example the <b>Shroud</b> of Turin, a piece of linen cloth thought by some to bear an image of Jesus Christ after his crucifixion. Three separate laboratories dated samples of linen from the <b>Shroud</b> in 1988; the results pointed to 14th-century origins, raising doubts about the shroud's authenticity as an alleged 1st-century relic.|$|E
5|$|It is {{difficult}} to make a single, definitive description of the folkloric vampire, though there are several elements common to many European legends. Vampires were usually reported as bloated in appearance, and ruddy, purplish, or dark in colour; these characteristics were often attributed to the recent drinking of blood. Blood was often seen seeping from the mouth and nose when one was seen in its <b>shroud</b> or coffin and its left eye was often open. It would be clad in the linen <b>shroud</b> it was buried in, and its teeth, hair, and nails may have grown somewhat, though in general fangs were not a feature. Although vampires were generally described as undead, some folktales spoke of them as living beings.|$|E
50|$|In {{the mid-nineteenth}} century the futtock band was introduced, being a metal collar fitted to the mast below the top, to which the lower point of the futtock <b>shrouds</b> is {{attached}}. Before this the futtock <b>shrouds</b> were attached to the lower <b>shrouds</b> that rose directly to the top. In this arrangement lower <b>shrouds</b> must support a greater load, requiring the use of catharpins to provide bracing between port and starboard <b>shrouds.</b>|$|R
50|$|In {{the most}} {{traditional}} ships, the futtock <b>shrouds</b> {{can be used}} {{to gain access to the}} tops. Sailors ascend ratlines on the ordinary <b>shrouds</b> until nearly at the top, then transfer to the futtock <b>shrouds</b> which will be reaching upwards and outwards above them. Using the futtock <b>shrouds</b> involves climbing the underside of an overhanging rope at about 45 degrees. Futtock <b>shrouds</b> may or may not have ratlines.|$|R

Eyewitnesses in Portland, Seattle, and Reno, and all those who personally interacted with Cooper were interviewed. A series of composite sketches was developed.|$|E
5|$|Kor (John Colicos), a revered Klingon warrior, is in Quark's Bar {{telling stories}} of past battles {{to his friend}} Lieutenant Commander Jadzia Dax (Terry Farrell). She notices Lieutenant Commander Worf (Michael Dorn) nearby and invites him to meet Kor, who greets Worf happily, saying that anyone who is so {{strongly}} disliked by the Klingon government {{is a friend of}} his. He explains to Jadzia and Worf that he is on the station as part of his plan to find the legendary Sword of Kahless. The sword is the original bat'leth, used by Kahless to defeat the tyrant Molor. Kor received a <b>shroud</b> from a Vulcan science team, which he believes once held the Sword. He gives it to Jadzia to test the shroud's authenticity. As he returns to his quarters, Kor is attacked by a Lethean who reads his thoughts in order to find out about the Sword and then removes his memories of the attack. Jadzia finds him the following morning, and thinks that he has passed out from too much alcohol. She has verified the authenticity of the <b>shroud.</b> Captain Benjamin Sisko (Avery Brooks) lends the trio a Runabout to travel into the Gamma Quadrant to search for the sword on a planet where the Vulcan team found the <b>shroud.</b>|$|E
5|$|Some relics, such as purported {{remnants}} of the Crown of Thorns, receive only a modest number of pilgrims, while the <b>Shroud</b> of Turin (which is associated with an approved Catholic devotion to the Holy Face of Jesus), has received millions, including popes John Paul II and Benedict XVI.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{introduces}} a FEA method for vibration characteristics analysis of an aero-engine <b>shrouded</b> turbine blade and makes an actual modal {{analysis of this}} <b>shrouded</b> blade based on this method in UG software environment. The first six natural frequencies and mode shapes of this <b>shrouded</b> blade are calculated. And also, the dynamic characteristics of the <b>shrouded</b> turbine blade are discussed in detail according to the analysis results. The FEA method and the vibration characteristics analysis results in the paper {{can be used for}} optimal design and vibration safety verification of this aero-engine <b>shrouded</b> turbine blade...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} {{is to improve the}} {{performance}} of electrodes prepared via atmospheric plasma spray by means of gas <b>shrouding</b> which is expected to apparently reduce the oxygen content of the plasma plume and subsequently improve the coating quality. Electrodes with dual-layer coating for alkaline water electrolysis were deposited on Ni-coated perforated substrates. Microstructure and morphology were studied by SEM. Element content was measured by EDS. Enthalpy probe was employed for measuring plasma temperature and velocity as well as the gas composition. For verifying and better understanding the <b>shrouding</b> effect numerical calculation was carried out according to the experimental settings. Electrochemical test was carried out to validate the <b>shrouding</b> effect. The results showed slight protecting effect of gas <b>shrouding</b> on plasma plume and the final coating. Overall the dual-layer region, the measured oxygen fraction was 3. 46 % and 3. 15 % for the case without gas <b>shrouding</b> and with gas <b>shrouding</b> respectively. With gas <b>shrouding</b> the coating exhibited similar element contents as the coating sprayed by VPS while no obvious improvement was observed in the microstructure or the morphology. Evident electrochemical improvement was nevertheless achieved that with gas <b>shrouding</b> the electrode exhibited similar performance as that of the VPS sprayed electrode...|$|R
5|$|A stone coffin {{found during}} the 2012 {{excavation}} was opened {{for the first}} time, revealing a lead coffin inside. An investigation with an endoscope revealed {{the presence of a}} skeleton along with some head hair and fragments of a <b>shroud</b> and cord. The skeleton was at first assumed to be male, perhaps that of a knight called Sir William de Moton who was known to have been buried there, but later examination showed it to be of a woman—perhaps a high-ranking benefactress. She may not necessarily have been local, as lead coffins were used to transport corpses over long distances.|$|E
5|$|CNN cited {{a senior}} U.S. {{official}} as saying {{three sets of}} photographs of bin Laden's body exist: Photos taken at an aircraft hangar in Afghanistan, described as the most recognizable and gruesome; photos taken from the burial at sea on the USS Carl Vinson before a <b>shroud</b> was placed around his body; and photos from the raid itself, which include shots of {{the interior of the}} compound as well as three of the others who died in the raid.|$|E
5|$|One of the surprises of {{the impacts}} was {{the small amount}} of water {{revealed}} compared to prior predictions. Before the impact, models of Jupiter's atmosphere had indicated that the break-up of the largest fragments would occur at atmospheric pressures of anywhere from 30 kilopascals to a few tens of megapascals (from 0.3 to a few hundred bar), with some predictions that the comet would penetrate a layer of water and create a bluish <b>shroud</b> over that region of Jupiter.|$|E

50|$|The {{main purpose}} of the top is to anchor the <b>shrouds</b> of the topmast that extends above it. <b>Shrouds</b> down {{to the side of}} the hull would be at too acute an angle from the mast, so struts running out from the mast are added to take the place of the hull for a smaller copy (the topmast) of the lower mast and its rigging. Placing a few timbers between these struts {{produces}} a useful platform, the top. The futtock <b>shrouds</b> carry the load of the upper <b>shrouds</b> into the mast below.|$|R
40|$|An {{anisokinetic}} <b>shrouded</b> nozzle {{system was}} designed for sampling particles at a constant low flow rate from a ventilation duct to an aerodynamic particle sizer (APS). <b>Shrouded</b> anisokinetic nozzles are a means for sampling from a moving airstream with higher particle transmission than with unshrouded isokinetic nozzles. This <b>shrouded</b> nozzle sampling system was evaluated in an experimental ventilation duct system. Aspiration and transport efficiency measurements were made for five particle sizes in the range 1 - 13 μm at each of three duct air speeds in the range 2. 2 - 8. 8 m/s. Under these conditions, the <b>shrouded</b> nozzle system showed improved performance compared to buttonhook isokinetic nozzles, especially for larger particles and higher air speeds. Measured transmission efficiencies through the <b>shrouded</b> nozzle sampling system were generally higher and more reliably predictable than those through buttonhook isokinetic nozzles. Model predictions of transport and aspiration efficiencies of the <b>shrouded</b> nozzle system showed good agreement with measurements over {{the entire range of}} experimental conditions. The <b>shrouded</b> nozzle sampling system could be used to measure concentrations in ventilation ducts with an APS for particles in the diameter range 1 - 13 μm.

5|$|X-ray {{analysis}} {{shows that there}} were a few preparatory drawings made with chalk before the paint was applied. This is left exposed in some areas, most noticeably in the Virgin's veil and mantle and in Christ's <b>shroud.</b> Infrared photography reveals little underdrawing but shows that the canvas underwent several changes before it was completed; Mary Salome was repositioned slightly to the left, the sizes of Nicodemus' arm and shoulder were reduced, and the Magdalen's face was painted over the Virgin's mantle.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to these new roles for noble sub-castes, Andriamasinavalona singled out the Antehiroka as sacred royal advisers and custodians of ancestral traditions related to circumcision. This clan was formed of the descendents of Andriampirokana and his two sons, themselves descendents of a vazimba king. Andriampirokana befriended King Ralambo and played an integral part in establishing the tradition of circumcision in Imerina. The collection of water gourds and arranging of freshly woven mats {{for use in the}} ceremony were made the responsibility of this clan. The Antehiroka were also tasked with delivering royal benedictions, receiving hasina (tribute) on behalf of the king, and wrapping deceased sovereigns in the traditional lambamena <b>shroud.</b> In Antananarivo, the Antehiroka were placed in Ampamaho, the location of their clan tomb. In the countryside, Andriamasinavalona decreed that they should inhabit Ambohitrinimanga and Amboditsiry.|$|E
5|$|Morell {{continued}} {{to appear in}} Hammer's horror films in the ensuing decade. He had parts in the Shadow of the Cat (1960), She (1964, again with Peter Cushing) and its sequel Vengeance of She (1967), the lead in The Plague of the Zombies (1965), and The Mummy's <b>Shroud</b> (1966). He also starred with Cushing in Hammer's Cash on Demand, playing the same role he had played opposite Richard Vernon in the original TV play, The Gold Inside. He turned down the opportunity of reprising the title role in Hammer's feature film adaptation of Quatermass and the Pit (1967). He {{did not wish to}} repeat himself.|$|E

5000|$|Futtock <b>shrouds</b> are rope, wire or {{chain links}} in the rigging of a {{traditional}} square rigged ship. They run from the outer edges of a top downwards and inwards to a point on the mast or lower <b>shrouds,</b> and carry the load of the <b>shrouds</b> that rise {{from the edge of}} the top. This prevents any tendency of the top itself to tilt relative to the mast.|$|R

5|$|She and Charles had six {{children}} together. Before {{her first child}} Charles's birth, Lucinda had a premonition that her son would not live very long. She told her mother that the dress she sewed for him was like a funeral <b>shroud,</b> and after baby Charles's death at age two, she buried him in it. Lucinda's second child, a daughter named Rosette, also died in infancy. Dalton often references these lost child infants in her poetry. Her third child, Clifford, was born on February 18, 1875. Charles was a joint owner of a store in Beaver and also hauled freight to surrounding areas. However, his income was not sufficient to support his four wives and many children.|$|E
5|$|The {{encryption}} {{resembles the}} RSA algorithm. This algorithm encodes data in 3-byte blocks. First, the each byte is permuted through an 8-position permutation, then the bits are {{split into two}} 12-bit integers (by taking the low 4 bits of the second byte and the 8 bits of the first byte as the first 12-bit integer, and the 8 bits of the third byte and the 4 high bits of the second integer as the second 12-bit integer). Each is individually encrypted by taking them to the 3491st power, mod 4097; the bits are then reassembled into 3 bytes. The encrypted text is then stored in a string variable {{as part of the}} program. To <b>shroud</b> the would be visible and noticeable text it is compressed with the simple Lzw before final storage. As the Macintosh Common Lisp compiler compresses the main program code into the executable, this was not that necessary.|$|E
5|$|The highest hills are Càrnan (273m or 896ft), Hecla (Old Norse: Hooded <b>shroud)</b> (219m or 719ft) and Macphee's Hill (224m or 735ft). The {{last was}} named when a relief ship sent by MacNeil of Barra {{was sent to}} {{discover}} why communications from the island had ceased. A crewman called Macphee was sent ashore and returned to report that the residents had all died of disease. Fearing the plague, his shipmates refused to allow him back on board. He survived for a year, and climbed the hill every day {{to look out for}} a rescue. When the island was re-settled The MacNeil granted him land there.|$|E

5|$|The {{spacecraft}} {{in which}} the telescope and instruments were to be housed was another major engineering challenge. It would have to withstand frequent passages from direct sunlight {{into the darkness of}} Earth's shadow, which would cause major changes in temperature, while being stable enough to allow extremely accurate pointing of the telescope. A <b>shroud</b> of multi-layer insulation keeps the temperature within the telescope stable and surrounds a light aluminum shell {{in which the}} telescope and instruments sit. Within the shell, a graphite-epoxy frame keeps the working parts of the telescope firmly aligned. Because graphite composites are hygroscopic, there was a risk that water vapor absorbed by the truss while in Lockheed's clean room would later be expressed in the vacuum of space; resulting in the telescope's instruments being covered by ice. To reduce that risk, a nitrogen gas purge was performed before launching the telescope into space.|$|E
5|$|As a newly {{inducted}} {{member of}} the Scions, the player follows Thancred to Thanalan to investigate abductions and the theft of crystals along trade routes in the area. The culprits {{are members of the}} Amalj'aa beast tribe who capture the adventurer to be sacrificed to their primal god, Ifrit. The attempt fails as the Echo protects the player from Ifrit's brainwashing. The adventurer counters by defeating Ifrit and is hailed as a hero, with emissaries from all three Grand Companies jockeying for the privilege of recruiting said hero. While attending rallies at each of the three cities honoring the memory of those fallen at Carteneau, the player meets the twins Alphinaud and Alisaie who question the purpose of such nationalist displays. The adventurer's next mission is to forge relations with the Sylphs of the Black <b>Shroud,</b> a peaceful beast tribe whose radical sect once summoned Ramuh to defend the forest from Garlean incursion. While searching for the Sylph elder, the player encounters Lahabrea for the first time—an immortal Ascian bent on destroying the Mothercrystal. The Scions, Thancred in particular, resolve to investigate this new foe.|$|E
5|$|Holden's {{standardisation}} of six airbags in March 2008 for MY09 {{made the}} VE {{eligible for the}} ANCAP side pole test, yielding additional scoring points. The second stage of the VE's safety rollout in October 2008 for MY09.5 included {{the addition of a}}n energy absorbing steering column <b>shroud</b> and redesigned rear door latches across the VE range. The inclusion of a seat belt reminder on the Omega sedan yielded another point, thus allowing the Omega sedan to score five-stars, or a score of 33.45 when tested the following December. The Omega Sportwagon was the next model to be awarded the full five stars the following February, following the addition of a seat belt reminder in Sportwagon production. The remaining VE models, including the Ute and WM Statesman/Caprice, which had already received most of the safety upgrades, received the seat belt reminder as standard fitment as of MY10 production from August 2009. As a result, all VE sedan and Sportwagon variants along with the extended length WM models received the five-star rating. The VE Ute officially received the rating on 19 October 2009, making the entire line-up of Australian-made Holdens five-star ANCAP rated.|$|E

40|$|Supersonic {{coherent}} gas jets are {{now widely}} used in electric arc furnace steelmaking {{in order to increase}} the gas-liquid mixing, reaction rates and energy efficiency of the process. However, there has been limited research on the basics physics involved in supersonic coherent jet. In this study, Computational fluid dynamics simulations of the supersonic jet with and without <b>shrouding</b> flame were carried out and validated against experimental data. The numerical results showed that the potential core length of the supersonic jet with <b>shrouding</b> flame is over 4 times longer than that of a supersonic jet without flame <b>shrouding</b> which were in good agreement with the experimental data. The CFD model results were then used to analyse the flame <b>shrouding</b> effect on the central supersonic jet...|$|R
40|$|The present work {{involves}} Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) {{modeling and}} validation of head and power {{characteristics of a}} Top <b>Shrouded</b> Turbine with Nonradial Rectangular Blades (TSTNRB) operated in backswept mode. Following the successful validation reported here and in two previous studies by the authors. CFD {{has been used to}} simulate the performance of different kinds of impellers viz. Straight Blade Paddle (SBP), Rushton Turbine (RT), Top <b>Shrouded</b> Turbine with Radial Rectangular Blades (TSTRRB), Top <b>Shrouded</b> Turbine with Radial Trapezoidal Blades (TSTRTB), Top <b>Shrouded</b> Turbine with Non-radial Rectangular Blades (TSTNRB), Top <b>Shrouded</b> Turbine with Curved Blades (TSTCB), and Both side <b>Shrouded</b> Turbine with Radial Trapezoidal Blades (BSTRTB), to compare them for pump-mix action. Baffle-impeller interaction has been modeled using the sliding mesh approach. Standard k-epsilon model has been used for turbulence modeling. The power number, head number, and flow number have been computed for each impeller. The impellers have been rated on the basis of head generated by them for equal specific power input. An attempt has been made to explain why different impellers operating at the same speed and handling the same inlet flow rate should give different heads. How this insight can be used to conceptualize better designs of pump-mix impeller is illustrated. (C) 2007 American Institute of Chemical Engineers...|$|R
