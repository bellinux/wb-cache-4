50|$|Less {{well-known}} but plentiful is {{a family}} of projectors based around a design originated by Sawyer's and later sold under other brand names. That manufacturer's first slide projectors, in the late 1950s, had used straight trays. In 1963, the Sawyer's Rotomatic, the first version using circular trays (called Rototrays), was introduced. These are distinguished by the round tray being in an upright orientation, like a Ferris wheel. Unlike the Carousel tray's use of a locking collar to hold the <b>slide</b> in the <b>tray,</b> the Rototray held slides in place using friction {{against the side of}} each slide. Projectors using the 100-slide Rototray were backward-compatible with the TDC-Universal straight <b>slide</b> <b>trays</b> that had been popular since the late 1950s. The 1960s would also see the introduction of a plethora of less popular tray designs, most incompatible with each other, introduced by manufacturers possibly hoping to profit from the Razor-and-blades business model.|$|R

30|$|The thin {{sections}} were prepared by laying samples set in open sample trays with clean glass slides. Sample numbers were {{marked on the}} glass slide with diamond scriber. Sample number checked against the marked number on the glass slides to ensure the sample identity is correct. The samples were ground to a flat surface using only diamond abrasive with distilled water. Sample grinding was done by hand on a flat plate for the core samples. Samples that required stabilization (the side wall core samples) prior to grinding, were stabilized. Epoxy stabilization was done in a plastic using Epon 815 -diethylene-triamine. The glass <b>slide</b> <b>tray</b> was ensured to be next to the samples. The sample was allowed to cure at room temperature. Final grinding of the surface to be mounted on the glass slide was done using 400 -mesh diamond plate. Lapping was done using glass impregnated plate.  10 ×-power magnification microscopes were used in observing {{the progress of the}} grinding. The prepared slides were analyzed using petrographic microscope.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} the use of {{immersive}} spherical imaging techniques to document, visualize and investigate architectural space. This technology can be used in the classrooms and design studios to augment traditional instructional and design investigation tools. As opposed to cylindrical imaging found in the popular QuickTime VR format, spherical imaging provides a 360 -degree view in all directions - horizontally and vertically. The ability to capture and display a full sphere can be crucial for many interior architectural spaces. Spherical panoramas can originate from real, synthetic or hybrid source images. In addition to the ability to embed links to web pages or other panoramas, a unique feature of this technology allows the viewer to navigate through a scene as well as pause at any point and view the space in all directions. In addition, the technology allows the user to sketch over the scene in an intelligent manner such that the sketched artifacts rotate correctly when the target view shifts. The software also integrates with collaborative tools to allow synchronous viewing of shared panoramas over the Internet. These features allow for a truly immersive and interactive experience of the space that can be quite useful in a design studio setting. Finally, this paper describes ongoing efforts to integrate this technology with an interactive web-based, databasedriven virtual <b>slide</b> <b>tray</b> system for the storage, sorting, and display of multimedia content...|$|R

50|$|Small {{portable}} toolboxes {{are sometimes}} called hand boxes or portable tool storage. Most portable toolboxes have one handle {{on top and}} a lid that opens on a hinge.

Portable toolboxes sometimes use <b>slide</b> out <b>trays</b> or cantilever trays in lieu of the removable tote tray. Metal toolboxes (typically steel) weigh more than plastic ones. A plastic toolbox laden with tools can weigh the same as a comparable steel box does when empty. Metal boxes are also subject to rusting and their sharp edges can mark the surfaces of things they are banged against. Metal is, however, known for being stronger than plastic, so one should balance its disadvantages against the need to withstand abuse and support the weight of many tools.|$|R

40|$|Periphyton is {{a complex}} mat, {{predominantly}} made up of algae, found attached to submerged surfaces in the photic zone of a waterbody. In the early 1990 's this brown substance was observed to cover plants, stones and most submerged surfaces around the shoreline of Lough Gill in NW Ireland. Analysis of the water indicated a mesotrophic system, however such a substantial growth of periphyton warranted further investigation. A monitoring programme was established with six sample sites spread around the littoral zone. Three artificial substrates were used to measure periphyton; glass <b>slides,</b> <b>trays</b> of washed stone and a plastic substrate (to simulate the macrophyte Littorella uniflora). Substrates were submerged for periods of 1 month from February 1997 to May 1998. Phytoplankton samples were also collected. Diatoms always dominated the biomass on slides, with peaks during spring and autumn. Green and blue/green algae became prominent {{in the summer and}} autumn. Diatom genera included Cymbella, Gomphonema, Nitzschia and Synedra. Chlorophyta included Chaetophora, Stigeodonium and Utothrix, and the main Cyanophyta were Anabaena and Aphanocapsa. During 1997 periphyton biomass from glass slides ranged from 25 g/m 2 (May) to < 1 g/m 2 (November), in the same period AFDW ranged between 14 g/m 2 and < 1 g/m 2 with algal numbers ranging between 16, 200 cells/mm 2 and 124 cells/mm 2. During April 1998 periphyton biomass exceeded anything seen during 1997 with dry weight from 24 g/m 2 to 36 g/m 2, AFDW from 11 g/m 2 to 19 g/m 2 and cell numbers were greatly increased (18, 850 cells/mm 2 to 41700 cells/mm 2). A substantial proportion of cells suspended in the waters of the littoral zone were periphytic in origin. These diatoms dominated littoral phytoplankton during spring and considerably influenced phytoplankton populations {{throughout the rest of the}} year. In periods of peak periphyton growth, clots of algae became suspended through wind and wave action during stormy weather which temporarily reduced water clarity. Considerable spatial variation was observed between the sites. This would seriously effect site selection in a monitoring program. Wind patterns and associated water movement may influence growth variability on substrates; those sites with greater exposure having greater levels of growth. Glass slides suspended in the water column were more indicative of periphyton on natural substrates, whilst trays of washed stones and artificial Littorella were found to trap excessive amounts of inorganic sediment. The quantity of periphyton, irrespective of spatial and temporal trends, appears to be remarkably greater than other lakes in the west of Ireland...|$|R

Special detailed finite element modeling was required to obtain good agreement between analytical and test vibration modes. An orthotropic panel in the overall model was developed. Orthotropic stiffness for this panel were obtained from finely detailed statically loaded SPAR models which included stiffness and allowed for partial relative <b>sliding</b> of the <b>tray</b> clamping attachments.

40|$|Investing {{in solar}} drying {{technology}} Cue: Drying produce {{in the open}} air works. But in Kenya, Winnie Onyimbo discovers another way of drying fruits and vegetables that can fetch a good price at the market. She speaks to a lady who is passionate about solar drying technology. Margaret Mimoh is from Honey Care Africa Ltd, a cooperative which - as the name suggests - makes money from beekeeping. But recently, members of her cooperative have decided to take up another initiative. They have decided to invest in solar drying technology to preserve and keep fruits all year round. Solar drying works by trapping heat inside a box or frame covered with plastic sheets, with a wire mesh base to allow air to circulate. The trapped heat causes the fruits or vegetables to lose their moisture, and dries them out ? but the heat is not enough to cook them. Margaret Mimoh explains how it is done ? starting with the selection process. IN:	?First you have to get?? OUT:	?give it a longer shelf life. ? DUR?N:	 5 ? 20 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: That was Winnie Onyimbo speaking to Margaret Mimoh from Honey Care Africa Ltd. Could investing in solar trying technology be worth it? The interview comes from a resource pack produced by CTA. Transcript Mimoh	First you have to get ripe fruits, not over-ripened because if it?s over- ripened then slicing will be a problem because it will get mashed. So what happens is you have to wash the fruit, then you peel it and then you slice it in small slices maybe three millimetres to about five millimetres thick and then you place them on the drier, on the drying tray and then you put them inside the drier itself then you leave it there to dry. Onyimbo	I would like you to give me a brief explanation on what the solar drier that is used for drying looks like? Mimoh	The structure that is used for drying fruit is a very simple one. It is sort of, we should say, like a frame, maybe one metre by one metre and then it is covered with netting mesh, black netting mesh and then with a clear polythene sheet. The reason why we have the black netting and the clear polythene sheet is heat is allowed to get into the drier itself through the sheet and then it is absorbed by the netting mesh which now allows the air to circulate into the solar drier easily and then it extracts the moisture from the fruits allowing them to dry. Onyimbo	How big is it? Mimoh	The bigness will depend on the quantity of fruits {{that you would like to}} dry, like drying three kilos of fruit you will need one metre by one metre square of the frame with about two or three drying trays inside it. Onyimbo	So this is a kind of drier that you use to dry fruits, please explain to me what is this that I am seeing? Mimoh	This is the polythene sheet, it is very simple and it is locally available. We are always careful to get the right material for drying because when sunlight passes through this, there might be some chemical reaction between the polythene and the heat under and the fruit. Onyimbo	I am also seeing it is a bit different from the polythene that we are used to, this seems to be harder, harder to touch? Mimoh	Yes it is hard because even if you put a very light one there will not be as much heat as possible that would go in and dry the fruit so we use these ones so that you have more heat and also durability because you know when there is a lot of heat it tends to wear out. So we also do not want to be replacing like each and every time. The polythene sheet covers the three sides. You see on the three sides you have the polythene sheet and on the top side and then on the front side where you <b>slide</b> in the <b>trays</b> you have the netting mesh and this netting mesh - as I explained - it is locally available also in the market and it has to be black because black absorbs heat. Then when you open this (SFX opening drier) you have the <b>trays.</b> You <b>slide</b> them inside here and then you will be placing your fruits here on this tray here just the small pieces that you have cut, the slices you place them on the tray. Onyimbo	What advantages does this solar drier have in comparison to drying fruits in the open sun? Mimoh	There are aspects of health issues and hygiene. So if you basically maybe just take fruits and dry them {{in the open air}} of course you are exposing them to a lot of dust then maybe bacteria and those kind of things. And also the other thing is the nutritional value that is in the fruit will definitely be lost because it is exposed so it will not dry. There is no air circulating when you are drying in the open air. Onyimbo	How about the time spent, is it faster drying in a drier than drying in the open sun? Mimoh	When we have enough sunlight it would take a whole day, just one day, but if you do not really have good weather there is not enough sunlight it would take even two-to-three days to dry. Onyimbo	Where can materials for such a solar drier be found by a smallscale farmer in Africa? Mimoh	The materials are locally available in the market. So basically we say that they will need to be trained on how to fabricate the driers and how to go about the process of the drying. So it is not that the material is difficult to get, it is locally available in the market. The netting mesh in fact it is even used for tents. Onyimbo	Are there any nutrients that are lost when drying? Mimoh	In the fruits not really it is only the water that is lost during drying but most of the nutrients are maintained. So it is just as nutritious as the fresh fruit only that it does not have water. When you are drying it is only that you are removing water from it to give it a longer shelf life.
