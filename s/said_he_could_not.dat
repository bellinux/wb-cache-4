5|$|Just {{after midnight}} on September 6, the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade was ordered back to Pusan {{in order to}} travel to Japan and merge with other Marine units to form the 1st Marine Division. This was done after a heated {{disagreement}} between Walker's command and MacArthur's command. Walker <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> hold the Pusan Perimeter without the Marines in reserve, while MacArthur <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> conduct the Inchon landings without the Marines. MacArthur responded by assigning the 17th Infantry Regiment, and later the 65th Infantry Regiment, would be added to Walker's reserves, but Walker did not feel the inexperienced troops would be effective. Walker felt the transition endangered the Perimeter {{at a time when}} it was unclear if it would hold.|$|E
5|$|Walker had protested in vain against {{releasing}} the brigade, believing {{he needed it}} and all the troops then in Korea {{if he were to}} stop the North Korean offensive against the Pusan Perimeter. The order prompted a heated disagreement between Walker's command and MacArthur's command. Walker <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> hold the Pusan Perimeter without the Marines in reserve, while MacArthur <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> conduct the Inchon landings without the Marines. MacArthur responded by assigning two newly arrived units of the 3rd Infantry Division, the 17th Infantry Regiment and the 65th Infantry Regiment to Walker's reserves. Walker did not feel the inexperienced troops would be effective, and believed the transition endangered the Pusan Perimeter {{at a time when it}} was unclear if it could hold back the North Koreans. The brigade moved to Japan and merged with the 1st Marine Division. It was deactivated as an independent unit for the last time on 13 September 1950.|$|E
5|$|After Waters' {{departure}} in 1985, Wright {{began to}} contribute to Pink Floyd again, beginning with sessions for the album A Momentary Lapse of Reason. However, he did not legally rejoin as an equal to Gilmour and Mason, and was a salaried musician for the resulting tour, as his contract <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> rejoin as a full member. On the album credits, his name was listed after Mason and Gilmour and his photo did not appear on the cover.|$|E

5|$|Shortly after {{negotiations}} with the union ended, the mine owners met secretly with Sheriff Bowers in Colorado Springs. They told Bowers they intended to bring in hundreds of nonunion workers, {{and asked if he}} could protect such a large force of men. Bowers <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not,</b> for the county lacked the financial resources to pay and arm more than a few deputies. The mine owners offered to subsidize an initial force of a hundred or so men. Bowers agreed, and immediately began recruiting ex-police and ex-firefighters from Denver.|$|E
5|$|In January 2010, {{there was}} a full reading of the one-act version of the play. Despite an {{unfinished}} script and a performance by amateur actors, it evoked a strong response from the audience. Later that year, Stephen Waldschmidt, an artistic associate of Burnt Thicket Theatre, asked to read the script of She Has a Name, and later <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> put it down. He was initially reluctant to attach himself to the play because of the immensity and ugliness of the issues therein, but he ultimately worked with Kooman to expand it into a full-length play with an extra hour of material {{by the end of}} 2010. The result is a play that can be performed in 90 minutes but may last up to two hours. Burnt Thicket Theatre served as the play's initial production company.|$|E
5|$|Lewis Archer is {{a fictional}} {{character}} from the British ITV soap opera, Coronation Street, played by Nigel Havers. The character was created and introduced as a love interest for Audrey Roberts (Sue Nicholls). Executive producer Kim Crowther revealed the team wanted {{an actor who}} was slightly younger than Audrey and who was very charming. Various actors were considered for the part, but the casting director suggested Havers as {{she knew he was}} a big fan of the show. The actor <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> turn down a chance to appear in Coronation Street as his character had an interesting story arc. Havers was contracted until July 2010 and he made his debut as Lewis in the episode broadcast on 18 December 2009.|$|E

5|$|On 15 November at 6:42a.m., the Kaštela TG {{commenced}} a naval {{bombardment of}} targets in Split {{and on the}} islands of Brač and Šolta. The order was issued aboard VPBR-31 Split and the JNA Maritime Military Sector command and JNA bases in Split were advised of the attack. The JNA based in Split did not join the bombardment. Letica notified the JNA Maritime Military Sector commanding officer Major General Nikola Mladenić of the attack, but Mladenić <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> control the situation because his headquarters was denied a supply of electricity. The European Community Monitor Mission (ECMM) was also notified; they promised to make efforts to stop the bombardment. Shortly after, Letica ordered the coastal artillery to commence fire against the Kaštela TG. Besides several near-misses, the coastal artillery fire scored a direct hit against VPBR-31 Split, that was attributed to the Marinča Rat-based battery on Šolta. Croatian sources said Mladenić ordered the bombardment in retribution {{for the loss of}} Mukos.|$|E
5|$|On 5 August 1999, a Haringey social worker, Barry Almeida, took Climbié to an NSPCC centre in Tottenham, {{where she}} was {{assigned}} to Sylvia Henry. There was some confusion {{as to why the}} centre was being referred to for the case. Henry later contacted Almeida and was told, according to Henry, that Climbié had moved out of the borough, thereby closing the case. Almeida <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> remember whether this conversation did take place. On the same day, Kouao met Arthurworrey and Jones at the Haringey social services department, and claimed that Climbié had poured boiling water over herself to stop the itching caused by the scabies and that she had used utensils to cause the other injuries. The social worker and police officer believed her, deciding that the injuries were probably accidental, and allowed Climbié to return home the following day, which she did.|$|E
5|$|On August 2, 2008, Judah lost to Joshua Clottey by {{technical}} {{decision in}} a fight for the vacant IBF Welterweight title at the Palms Casino Resort in Las Vegas. Judah began the busier fighter, showing quick hands and throwing effective combinations behind a jab. Clottey began steadily closing the distance between himself and his opponent from the third round, landing {{an increasing number of}} punches that took their toll on Judah. In round four, Clottey landed an uppercut that caused Judah to lose his balance, {{and by the end of}} the round, Judah had blood running down his nose. Judah staged a comeback in the sixth round, but in the middle of the seventh round, Clottey landed a right hand that hurt Judah and caused him to back into a corner. In round nine, Judah suffered a cut over his right eye and the fight was stopped after he <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> see. The referee had ruled the cut was caused by an accidental clash of heads and so the fight went to the scorecards. Two judges scored the fight 86–85 and the other judge scored it 87–84, all in favor of Clottey.|$|E

5|$|Around {{the same}} time as the group was {{rejected}} by Nintendo, Romero was approached by Scott Miller of Apogee Software, who wanted him to publish more levels for his previous Pyramids of Egypt—an adventure game where the player navigates mazes while avoiding Egyptian-themed traps and monsters—through Apogee's shareware model. Miller was pioneering a model of game publishing where part of a game would be released for free, with the remainder of the game available for purchase from Apogee. Romero <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not,</b> as Pyramids of Egypt was owned by Softdisk, but that it did not matter as the game he was now working on was much better, and sent Miller the Mario demo. Miller was impressed, and the Ideas from the Deep agreed to create a new game for Apogee before Christmas of 1990—only a few months away—split into three parts to match Apogee's shareware model of giving away the first part for free to attract interest in the whole. Hall suggested a console-style platformer in the vein of Super Mario Bros., as they had the technology made for it; he further recommended a science fiction theme, and developed a short introduction that convinced the team to make Commander Keen in Invasion of the Vorticons.|$|E
5|$|Despite Lady Tichborne's {{insistence that}} the Claimant was her son, {{the rest of the}} Tichbornes and their related {{families}} were almost unanimous in declaring him a fraud. They recognised Alfred Tichborne's infant son, Henry Alfred, as the 12th baronet. Lady Doughty, Sir Edward's widow, had initially accepted the evidence from Australia but changed her mind soon after the Claimant's arrival in England. Lady Tichborne's brother Henry Seymour denounced the Claimant as false when he found that the latter neither spoke nor understood French (Roger's first language as a child) and lacked any trace of a French accent. The Claimant was unable to identify several family members and complained about attempts to catch him out by presenting him with impostors. Vincent Gosford, a former Tichborne Park steward, was unimpressed by the Claimant, who, when asked to name the contents of a sealed package that Roger left with Gosford before his departure in 1853, <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> remember. The family believed that the Claimant had acquired from Bogle and other sources information that enabled him to demonstrate some knowledge of the family's affairs, including, for example, the locations of certain pictures in Tichborne Park. Apart from Lady Tichborne, a distant cousin, Anthony John Wright Biddulph, was the only relation who accepted the Claimant as genuine; however, as long as Lady Tichborne was alive and maintaining her support, the Claimant's position remained strong.|$|E
5|$|At {{his trial}} in Clearwater, Florida, Chandler {{said that he}} met the Rogers women and gave them directions, but he never saw them again except in {{newspaper}} coverage and on billboards. He never told the authorities {{that he had seen}} the women again. He acknowledged that he was on Tampa Bay that nightthe police had evidence of three ship-to-shore telephone calls made from his boat to his home during the time frame of the murdersbut Chandler maintained that he was fishing alone. He claimed that he had returned home late because his engine would not start, which he attributed to a gas line leak. He said that he had called the Coast Guard and the Florida Marine Patrol, and had flagged down a patrol boat, but both were too busy to help. He said that he subsequently fixed the line with duct tape and returned safely to shore. However, there were no records of distress calls from Chandler to either the Coast Guard or the Marine Patrol that night, nor were there any Coast Guard boats on the bay the following morning that could have helped him. According to a boat mechanic, who testified for the prosecution, Chandler's explanation of repairing the boat's alleged gas leak was not tenable because the fuel lines in his boata Baylinerwere directed upward. A leak would have sprayed fuel into the air rather than into the boat, and the corrosive gasoline would have eaten away the adhesive properties of the duct tape Chandler maintained he had used to repair the purported leak. Under interrogation from Pinellas County prosecutor, Douglas Crow, Chandler then <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> remember.|$|E
