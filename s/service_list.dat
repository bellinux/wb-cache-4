25|$|Orthalicus reses reses {{is listed}} as {{threatened}} on the United States Fish and Wildlife <b>Service</b> <b>list</b> of endangered species, since 2 August 1978. It was originally listed as Orthalicus reses. However, Othalicus reses comprises two recognized taxa, and only Orthalicus reses reses is threatened. In the time of listing, the Florida Game and Fresh Water Fish Commission favored listing, since intensive development has reduced the range to Stock Island. Leslie Hubricht and Alan Solem supported listing. Solem believed that collecting or expansion of tourist facilities could have drastic effects. The primary threat to Orthalicus reses reses {{at the time of}} listing was habitat loss due to development. Additional threats include pesticides, hurricanes, vegetation trimming along utility corridors, over-utilization of the habitat areas, and non-native predators. Trends in those threats are continuing at the same level, except for predation, the threat level for which is unknown. The population trend is unknown in 2009.|$|E

At {{the time of}} inclusion the population was estimated at 70 individuals. In 1968, recovery efforts began to increase {{the population in the}} wild. In 1972, when the estimated population was 16 individuals, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) at the Luquillo Aviary began efforts to breed parrots in captivity and yielded good results. In June 2006, it was reported by the USFWS that its birds in captivity had successfully hatched 39 chicks (the yearly average is around 16). In 2006, 22 birds were released in the Rio Abajo State Forest to initiate a second wild population, and a further 19 [...] were released at the same site on 27 December 2008.|$|E

[...] Ray {{determined}} that there was no credible evidence of any criminal activity by any individual in the matter. [...] It attributed the improper collection of the files by Marceca due to his having an outdated Secret <b>Service</b> <b>list</b> of White House passes, as Marceca had originally claimed. It stated that even though Marceca's statements were sometimes [...] "contradictory and misleading", they were [...] "sufficiently transparent" [...] and there was insufficient evidence to prove that Anthony Marceca had made false statements to Congress during his testimony. [...] The report ascribed the FBI files matter to [...] "a failure of process at many levels," [...] saying that the Secret Service had provided critically erroneous data, and that this was compounded by the White House's informal process of requesting sensitive information by [...] "inexperienced, untrained, and unsupervised personnel with backgrounds as political operatives." ...|$|E
