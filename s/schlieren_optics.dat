40|$|Eight antigenically unique {{immunoglobulins}} {{have been}} identified in purified equine anti-p-azophenyl-β-lactoside (Lac) antibody isolated from a single horse. The Fc fragments of the γGa-, γGb-, γGc-, and -γA-globulins have been shown to possess unique antigenic determinants. Common γG- and γA-Fc fragment antigenic determinants, which were absent from the 10 Sγ 1 - and γM-globulins, have also been observed. All antibody populations share two antigenically distinct light (B, L) chain variants. The association of anti-Lac antibody with the hapten p-(p-dimethylamino-benzeneazo) -phenyl-β-lactoside has been measured by equilibrium dialysis and by fluorescence quenching. A variation in the affinity of anti-Lac antibody for hapten has been observed. The affinity of antibody was unaltered by enzymatic removal of the Fc fragments by peptic digestion or dissociation of the two combining sites on the papain 3. 5 S Fab fragments, indicating that the observed heterogeneity of affinities was not a direct function of the heterogeneity in structure of the Fc fragments. Isolated heavy (A, H) chains of γA-anti-Lac antibody have been shown to have retamed affinity for Lac dye by equilibrium dialysis and by analytical ultracentrifugation, employing a combination of <b>schlieren</b> and absorption <b>optics.</b> The heavy (A, H) chains from two physically separable, antigenically distinct antibody populations, isolated from the same animal and having affinity for the same haptenic determinant, have been found to differ in their amino acid composition. Anti-Lac antibody light (B, L) chains have also been shown to be chemically heterogeneous, and contained populations of polypeptide chains possessing, and populations lacking methionine. The relevance of the observed structural heterogeneity of equine anti-Lac antibody to the problem of defining the mechanism of acquisition of immunological specificity is briefly discussed...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of an experimental investigation aimed at verifying some of the interesting conclusions of the numerical study by Jenny et al. concerning the instability and the transition of the motion of solid spheres falling or ascending freely in a Newtonian fluid. The phenomenon is governed by two dimensionsless parameters: the Galileo number G, and the ratio of the density of the spheres to that of the surrounding fluid ρs/ρ. Jenny et al. showed that the (G, ρs/ρ) parameter space may be divided into regions with distinct features of the trajectories followed eventually by the spheres after their release from rest. The characteristics of these ‘regimes of motion’ as described by Jenny et al., agree well with what was observed in our experiments.

40|$|The dual bell is {{a nozzle}} concept for {{altitude}} adaption. The flow separates at the contour inflection in sea level mode in a mainly controlled and symmetrical way, reducing the side load generation {{and increasing the}} thrust.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to develop an optical method of leak detection. Various modifications of <b>schlieren</b> <b>optics</b> were explored with initial emphasis on leak detection of the plumbing within the orbital maneuvering system of the space shuttle (OMS pod). The schlieren scheme envisioned for OMS pod leak detection was that of a high contrast pattern on flexible reflecting material imaged onto a negative of the same pattern. We find that the OMS pod geometry constrains the characteristic length scale of the pattern to the order of 0. 001 inch. Our experiments suggest that optical modulation transfer efficiency will be very low for such patterns, which will limit the sensitivity of the technique. Optical elements which allow a negative of the scene to be reversibly recorded using light from the scene itself were explored for their potential in adaptive single-ended schlieren systems. Elements studied include photochromic glass, bacteriorhodopsin, and a transmissive liquid crystal display.

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown that copepods exhibit complex behaviors. Copepods are ocean-dwelling {{crustaceans}} that form the base of the marine food web. With the increase in global temperatures, there has been an increase in naturally occurring harmful algal blooms. The purpose of this project was {{to determine the effects of}} harmful algal blooms such as Karenia brevis and Alexandrium fundyense on the escape behaviors of the small North Atlantic copepod, Temora longicornis. The experiments were performed in the <b>schlieren</b> <b>optics</b> system tank. A siphon was used to mimic the fish’s mouth. Data were collected via a high speed camera. Detection distance, escape distance, and escape speed were analyzed. Temora longicornis escape ability was not affected in terms of escape speed and escape distance after feeding on A fundyense. Copepods exposed to K. brevis, however, exhibited the furthest escape distance, largest average escape speed, and highest maximum speed of all other treatments. This conspicuous escape behavior increases the probability that they will fall prey to visual predators. Increased predation rates on HAB-affected copepods may facilitate the bioaccumulation of brevetoxins up the marine food chain with possible deleterious effects on humans consuming these fish.

The IMS has developed micromechanical SLMs with viscoelastic control layers (VCL) and with cantilever beam mirrors (CBM) on a silicon backplane with complete CMOS addressing circuitry.

40|$|The nozzle are {{currently}} presenting {{the most promising}} optimisation possibilities to supply the increasing needs of the aerospace industry. The dual bell nozzles allow the altitude adaptation of the flow. The inflection forces the flow to a stable and symmetrical separation, generating an optimised thrust for sea level operation.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the structure of the wake behind gas bubbles rising at high Reynolds numbers in highly purified water. It describes a <b>schlieren</b> <b>optics</b> technique to visualise the wake. The technique does not contaminate the water, and so does not affect the zero-stress condition at the bubble surface. It is first shown that zigzagging bubbles have a double-threaded wake of which the axially vorticity components periodically switch sign; some distance downstream of the bubble the wake is unstable. It is explained that this wake structure signifies that the bubble experiences a lift force; the magnitude of the lift force is estimated by two different indirect methods. The results suggest that the zigzag motion is not maintained by periodic vortex shedding, contrary to what was found in earlier investigations. In {{the second part of the}} paper we study the collision of bubbles with a vertical wall. It is shown that in the collision the bubble loses its wake, which subsequently impinges on the wall and reorganises into a coherent, approximately spherical, vortex blob. The presence of vorticity plays a crucial role in the collision. The experimental findings have been incorporated in a simple model to describe the path of a bubble after the collision, which is shown to yield good agreement with what is observed in the experiments...|$|E

SLMs can be employed for various applications like projection displays, direct-writing systems for photolithographic processes and optical signal processing. This dissertation gives {{an overview of the}} studies on a micromechanical SLM with a deformable oil film as actuator placed on a CMOS-circuit with mirror-layer on top. The oil film deforms due to electrostatic forces at the surface where an electric field is applied. Incident light is transmitted through the deformed oil film and reflected by the mirror layer. The local oil film deformations result in a spatial phase modulation. A simple <b>Schlieren</b> <b>optics</b> can convert the phase modulation into an intensity pattern for image projection. This work presents the first SLM devices with a deformable oil film that is addressed by a CMOS active matrix. This new technology is called moving liquid mirror (MLM).

40|$|International audienceThe {{ballistic}} {{impact properties}} of a borosilicate ('pyrex') glass was studied using mild steel rods accelerated using a light gas gun. High-speed photography at sub-microsecond framing rates was used along with <b>schlieren</b> <b>optics</b> {{to investigate the}} propagation of elastic shock waves and fracture fronts. Flash X-radiography was used to visualize the deformation of rods as they penetrated the comminuted glass normally. The rod was seen initially {{to dwell on the}} surface for at least 3 μs creating a Hertzian cone-crack. Later on, between 40 and 60 μs, self-sharpening of the projectile was observed as the 'wings' of the heavily deformed front end sheared off. After this event, the front of the rod speeded up. X-rays also showed that the pattern of fissures within the comminuted glass was observed to be very similar shot-to-shot. X-radiography was also used to examine the mechanisms occurring during oblique impact of rods at 45 °. In oblique impact, bending of the rod rather than plastic deformation ('mushrooming') takes on the role of distributing the load over an area larger than that of the original rod diameter. High-speed photography of the rear surface of a glass block on which a fine grid had been placed confirmed that the comminuted glass moved as larger interlocked blocks. The experiments were modelled using the QinetiQ Eulerian hydrocode GRIM making use of the Goldthorpe fracture model.

The expected audience includes plasma scientists that are current and potential users of this technique.

40|$|The {{experimental}} and numerical examination of laminar lean premixed combustion of methane air mixtures at high pressures under normal and microgravity is {{the aim of}} this thesis. The elimination of buoyancy under microgravity is essential for the exact determination of the flammability limit and the burning velocity and furthermore allows the analysis of flame instabilities. First the lean flammability limit for upward combustion of methane was determined by the pressure increase inside the combustion chamber for pressures up to 70 bar under normal gravity. The chamber was equipped with an optical access which was used for filming the combustion in the microgravity experiments. These experiments were conducted at the Bremen drop tower which allows 4, 7 sec microgravity. In the experiments the combustion chamber was first filled with a predefined methane air mixture which was then ignited by a spark. The combustion was then filmed by a high speed camera with <b>schlieren</b> <b>optics.</b> These films were used to determine the flame speeds and the burning velocity. The burning velocity for mixtures close to the flammability limit were ca. 1 mm/s. The flammability limit under microgravity is leaner than under normal conditions. Furthermore flame front instabilities were observed. The development of the amplitudes of the cellular instabilities were different to each other and a small change in the initial conditions had a large influence on the behavior of the flame front. The numerical simulations of one-dimensional plane flames in an idealized combustion chamber were conducted with the program FlameMaster.
