5000|$|As of 2011, the 400 ft Monarch Place remains <b>Springfield's</b> tallest skyscraper; {{however, the}} city's lack of {{numerous}} skyscrapers is now looked on {{as a positive}} trait by city advisors such as the Urban Land Institute, who write that <b>Springfield's</b> [...] "Metro Center now stands out from its peers, most of which long ago demolished the human-scale architecture that made their downtowns livable."
