50|$|Gota is a gold {{or silver}} ribbon and lace from Lucknow, various other {{coloured}} ribbons of varying width, woven in a <b>satin</b> or <b>twill</b> weave {{may also be}} referred to as gota. It is used along with kinari work. The dresses with gota work are used for special occasions or religious occasions. Gota is crafted using appliqué technique with a strip of gold or silver or various other coloured ribbons of different widths woven in a <b>satin</b> or <b>twill</b> weave. It involves placing woven gold cloth onto fabrics such as georgette or bandhini to create different surface textures.|$|R
50|$|A satin fabric {{tends to}} have a high luster due to the high number of floats on the fabric. Because of this it is used in making bed sheets. Many {{variations}} can be made of the basic satin weave including a granite weave and a check weave. <b>Satin</b> weaves, <b>twill</b> weaves, and plain weaves are the three basic types of weaving by which the majority of woven products are formed.|$|R
50|$|Plain weave (also called tabby weave, linen weave or taffeta weave) is {{the most}} basic of three {{fundamental}} types of textile weaves (along with <b>satin</b> weave and <b>twill).</b> It is strong and hard-wearing, used for fashion and furnishing fabrics.|$|R
50|$|The way {{the warp}} and filling threads {{interlace}} {{with each other}} is called the weave. The majority of woven products are created with one of three basic weaves: plain weave, <b>satin</b> weave, or <b>twill.</b> Woven cloth can be plain (in one colour or a simple pattern), or can be woven in decorative or artistic design.|$|R
2500|$|A {{characteristic}} {{common with}} the rest of the Holy Week in Spain is usage of the nazareno or penitential robe for some of the participants in the processions. This garment consists in a tunic, [...] capirote (a hood with conical tip) used to conceal the face of the wearer, and sometimes a cloak. The fabrics normally used in these garments are velvet, damask, <b>satin</b> or <b>twill.</b> [...] The Nazarenos of some brotherhoods also can wear gloves, scapulars, stoles and the tunic fastened with cincture or belts of espartos. The exact colors and forms of these robes depend on the particular brotherhood, in Malaga normally the colors of the Nazarenos of the section of the Christ and the Virgin are different. Usually the nazarenos carry candles and they go before the thrones.|$|R
30|$|Among 150  g/m 2 fabrics of {{different}} materials (i.e. sample A, B and C) air permeability is highest for 100 % polyester filament fabric because of smooth and hairiness free yarns (Table  3). Hairy yarns in 100 % cotton and cotton blends offers more {{resistance to air flow}} and therefore lead to lower air permeability. Among plain, <b>twill</b> and <b>satin</b> fabrics of 200  g/m 2 weight (i.e. sample D, E and F), satin woven fabric offers highest air permeability, whereas twill fabric shows the least. This {{is due to}} the longer floats and larger pore sizes (Table  2) in <b>satin</b> structure. <b>Twill</b> fabric with compact structure offer the lowest air permeability. Further, air permeability decreases as the fabric weight increases due to compact structure with smaller pores and higher thickness.|$|R

40|$|The {{collections}} of fabrics based on Latvian folk weaving traditions {{for a modern}} interior decoration practice is presented. 33 samples with using different variations of two, three, four block overshot waves, block <b>twills</b> and block <b>satins,</b> rose path <b>twills,</b> huskaback weave cover {{a wide range of}} applications. Such as table clothes, curtains, bead spreads, upholstery materials, furniture covers, wall hangings and rugs. Samples are produced as two face or double fabrics on ordinary sample loom with four to eight shafts by using long draft or on manufacture loom by using 10 - 16 shafts with pointed threading. Car upholstery fabrics are produced on Downier loom. Some examples from two collections are discussed in this paper...|$|R
50|$|Precursors {{for carbon}} fibers are {{polyacrylonitrile}} (PAN), rayon and pitch. Carbon fiber filament yarns {{are used in}} several processing techniques: the direct uses are for prepregging, filament winding, pultrusion, weaving, braiding, etc. Carbon fiber yarn is rated by the linear density (weight per unit length, i.e. 1 g/1000 m = 1 tex) or by number of filaments per yarn count, in thousands. For example, 200 tex for 3,000 filaments of carbon fiber is three times as strong as 1,000 carbon filament yarn, but is also three times as heavy. This thread can then be used to weave a carbon fiber filament fabric or cloth. The appearance of this fabric generally depends on the linear density of the yarn and the weave chosen. Some commonly used types of weave are <b>twill,</b> <b>satin</b> and plain. Carbon filament yarns can also be knitted or braided.|$|R
40|$|The {{compression}} of typical glass fibre woven fabrics, namely plain, <b>twill,</b> <b>satin,</b> and noncrimped stitch-bonded fabric, was studied experimentally by performing {{a series of}} mechanical tests on dry and resin impregnated assemblies of fabrics. This was followed by microstructural studies of corresponding laminates cured under different degrees of compression. The experiments included investigations {{on the effects of}} applied pressure, speed of compression, fabric orientation, number of plies and different resin systems on fibre volume fraction,Vf, of the compressed assembly. It was found that the {{compression of}} dry fabrics followed a power-law relationship between pressure and Vf where the power law index, b, was determined to be approximately equal to 10. 3, 9. 8 and 9. 1 for assemblies consisting of plain, twill and 5 harness satin weaves, respectively. A mathematical analysis was performed for the viscoelastic compression of resin impregnated assemblies of fabrics and a model was developed incorporating the deformation of the fibre network and resin flow through the reinforcement. A methodology was devised for the geometrical representation of plain weaves in the microstructural analysis of cured laminates. The microstructural studies then provided data for the area and geometrical parameters of the yam cross-section; the mean amplitude, wavelength and phase angle of the yarn waveform and the distance between plies at different compression pressures. Cross-sections of laminates with each of the considered fabrics were compared in terms of fibre area fractions, porosity and void content, for the different compression pressures. The aim for the microstructural analysis was to elucidate the mechanism of compression and to follow the development of fibre and pore structure under different degrees of compression. It was concluded that the compression of resin impregnated woven fabrics could be considered as a combination of four modes of deformation; (a) the elimination of a resin rich interlayer between adjacent layers of fabric; (b) the nesting of layers of fabric by slipping while under compression; (c) the deformation of the yam waveform which results in the reduction of thickness of individual plies and (d) the compression and deformation of the cross-sections of individual yarns...|$|R
