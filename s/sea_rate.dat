30|$|Amongst {{the goals}} of the AMADEUS {{detector}} are the investigation of the background for acoustic detection in the deep <b>sea</b> (<b>rate</b> of neutrino-like signals, localization of background sources, and levels of ambient noise), the study of signal and background correlations on different length scales, the development and test of filter and reconstruction algorithms, the evaluation of different sensors and sensing methods, and the study of hybrid optoacoustical detection methods. These studies will allow to evaluate the feasibility of acoustic particle detection with a future large volume detector. This paper introduces the generation of acoustical signal, describes the AMADEUS detector (Section 3), and discusses the online data handling (Sections 4 and 5). In Section 6 an example for offline analysis is given and first results are presented.|$|E

40|$|Using 19 {{years of}} {{satellite}} altimeter data, the <b>sea</b> level rising <b>rate</b> over the South China Sea is analyzed. The {{results show that}} the basin-averaged <b>sea</b> level rising <b>rate</b> of the SCS is about 4. 5 mm/year over the period of 1993 - 2011, which is much larger than the global <b>sea</b> level rising <b>rate</b> of 3. 2 mm/year since 1993. The steric effect analysis based on Levitus??? dataset shows that the total steric effect can only explain a half of the <b>sea</b> level rising <b>rate</b> in the SCS. Both of the rising rates of the satellite sea level and the steric sea level are geographically non-uniform. The water mass contributions to the sea level rising, including water transport through the straits and fresh water flux at the sea surface, are investigated as well to explain another half of <b>sea</b> level rising <b>rate.</b> However, due to the constraint of accuracy of transport rate from re-analysis dataset, the sea level rising budget is not closed in the current study...|$|R
40|$|Our {{goal is to}} {{determine}} vertical crustal movement rates from tide gauge and satellite altimetry measurements. Tide gauges measure sea level, but as they are fixed to the crust, they sense both sea surface height variations and vertical crustal movements. The differential <b>sea</b> level <b>rates</b> of sufficiently nearby stations are a good means {{to determine}} differential crustal movement <b>rates,</b> when <b>sea</b> level height variations can be assumed to be homogeneous. Satellite altimetric measurements determine sea surface height variations directly {{and can be used}} to separate the crustal signal from the sea surface height variations in tide gauge measurements. The correction of the tide gauge <b>sea</b> level <b>rates</b> for the <b>sea</b> surface height contribution requires collocation of the satellite pass and the tide gauge station. We show that even if this is not the case, the satellite altimetric observations enable correction of differential tide gauge rates for the effects of <b>sea</b> surface <b>rate</b> inhomogeneities. We apply the methodology to an area of broad scientific interest, due to its high seismic risk and its location as standpoint for a proposed major bridge connecting Sicily to the Italian mainland. We find that the Southern Calabria and the eastern Sicily tide gauges have a deficit in sea level increase of 1 - 2 mm/yr with respect to the north western Sicilian tide gauge. The satellite altimetric observations show that this differential movement must be caused by a tectonic component, because the <b>sea</b> surface <b>rates</b> are higher offshore eastern Sicily compared to offshore western Sicily. The satellite altimetric rates show that the <b>sea</b> surface <b>rates</b> are inhomogeneous in the Mediterranean and have larger amplitudes as we move away from the coast than immediately offshore. Our technique can be applied to any part of the world where tide gauge observations are available, because satellite altimetric observations are global...|$|R

40|$|Recognition {{of climate}} {{patterns}} {{is needed to}} characterise and understand the various climate mechanisms that culminate in the behaviour of the atmosphere or the ocean. The analysis of the periodic patterns in the oscillating sea levels {{is an important step}} in determining {{the presence or absence of}} non-periodic accelerating behaviours due to global warming or other effects. This is true for periodic patterns with a multi-decadal scale. Fast periodic (sub-decadal) patterns would not matter much if one is looking at long range accelerations. The analysis of high quality tide gauge records of the Pacific spanning more than 100 yr permits to evidence the multi-decadal oscillations of sea levels and their influence on the <b>sea</b> level <b>rate</b> of rise that may be computed by a linear fitting with different time windows. Without at least 65 - 70 yr of recorded data, the computed <b>sea</b> level <b>rate</b> of rise differs considerably from the actual long-term <b>sea</b> level <b>rate</b> of rise. These high quality long-term tide gauges show a non-accelerating oscillating behaviour with different periodicities in different locations. This result is consistent with a picture of locally and globally oscillating sea levels without any major sign of sharp positive accelerations at the present time...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Anaerobic {{oxidation}} {{of methane}} (AOM) and sul-fate reduction (SRR) were investigated in sediments {{of the western}} Black Sea, where upward methane transport is con-trolled by diffusion. To understand the regulation and dy-namics of methane production and oxidation in the Black <b>Sea,</b> <b>rates</b> of methanogenesis, AOM, and SRR were deter-mined using radiotracers in combination with pore water chemistry and stable isotopes. In the Danube Canyon and the Dnjepr palaeo-delta AOM did not consume methane ef-fectively and upwards diffusing methane created an extended sulfate-methane transition zone (SMTZ) that spread over more than 2. 5 m and was located in brackish and limnic sed-iment.

40|$|Although N 2 -fixing {{cyanobacteria}} {{contribute significantly}} to oceanic sequestration of atmospheric CO 2, {{little is known about}} how N 2 fixation and carbon fixation (primary production) interact in natural populations of marine cyanobacteria. In a developing cyanobacterial bloom in the Baltic <b>Sea,</b> <b>rates</b> of N 2 fixation (acetylene reduction) showed both diurnal and longer-term fluctuations. The latter reflected fluctuations in the nitrogen status of the cyanobacterial population and could be correlated with variations in the ratio of acetylene reduced to 15 N 2 assimilated. The value of this ratio may provide useful information about the release of newly fixed nitrogen by a cyanobacterial population. However, although the diurnal fluctuations in N 2 fixation broadly paralleled diurnal fluctuations in carbon fixation, the longer-term fluctuations in these two processes were out of phase. ...|$|R

A positive directional relationship from freight rate to newbuilding price is found and freight rate is more sensitive to market changes than newbuilding price. These results indicate that investment in new ships is encouraged by a strong freight market...|$|R

40|$|Sea {{levels are}} rising around the world, {{and this is}} a {{particular}} concern along most of the coasts of the United States.

40|$|Trait {{evolution}} {{over time}} periods spanning generations, not millennia, is increasingly observed {{to be above}} the natural baseline in populations experiencing human-induced perturbations. We investigated the relative speed of trait change by comparing rates of evolution in haldanes and darwins for primarily size at maturation as measured by probabilistic maturation reaction norm midpoints for fish stocks from the Pacific, North Atlantic, Barents Sea, Eastern Baltic, and the North <b>Sea.</b> <b>Rates</b> in haldanes for 23 stocks ranged from - 2. 2 - 0. 9 and from 0. 5 - 153 in kdarwins for 26 stocks. The highest rates of evolution corresponded to the most heavily exploited stocks; rates slowed after moratoria were introduced. The estimated rates in fish life-history characteristics were comparable to other examples of human-induced evolution, and faster than naturally-induced rates. Stocks with high growth showed slower evolutionary change, even under high mortality, suggesting that compensatory somatic growth can slow the rate of trait evolution. Regardless of whether trait changes are due to exploitation or environmental factors, the costs of ignoring trait evolution are high. As management strategies should be based upon precautionary principles, the effect of changing traits must {{be integrated into the}} fisheries assessment process...|$|R
