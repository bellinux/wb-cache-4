50|$|Foredge <b>shelving</b> (or {{fore-edge}} <b>shelving)</b> {{is a book}} <b>shelving</b> technique. Books {{are typically}} <b>shelved</b> upright with the spines facing outwards. However, when a book is too tall to stand upright on a shelf it may be <b>shelved</b> horizontally, i.e., flat, or with the spine resting on the shelf (spine <b>shelving),</b> or alternatively with the foredge, i.e., {{the part of the}} book opposite the spine, resting on the shelf, (foredge <b>shelving).</b>|$|R

50|$|Mobile <b>shelving,</b> mobile aisle <b>shelving,</b> roller racking, or rolling stack, are terms {{applied to}} <b>shelving</b> or storage units fitted with wheeled {{traction}} systems. Units can be closely packed when access is not required, {{but can be}} readily moved to open up an aisle to allow access. By {{eliminating the need for}} a permanently open aisle between every unit, a smaller proportion of floor space can be allocated to storage than in the case of conventional fixed <b>shelving,</b> or a higher capacity of storage can be met using the same footprint as fixed <b>shelving.</b>|$|R

Prior to his involvement, the trio began writing together in September 2015 and completed dozens of songs. They decided to <b>shelve</b> them upon working with Feldmann to start fresh, and they proceeded to record another 28 songs; in all, the group recorded upwards of 50. The band, {{as well as}} Feldmann, would regularly spend 18 hours in the studio a day, aiming to start and complete multiple songs in that timeframe. The album's title comes from the band's home state of California, and its artwork was illustrated by the street artist D*Face.|$|E

40|$|Parametrically tunable audio {{equalizers}} are conventionally realized using allpass digital lter networks. They {{consist of}} rst-order <b>shelving</b> lters and second-order equalizing lters. In this paper, ladder wave digital lters (WDFs) with parametrically tunable coecients are proposed as <b>shelving</b> and equalizing lters. Similar to the allpass realization, {{the transfer function}} power complementary property of WDFs is used to obtain ecient <b>shelving</b> and equalizing lters. However, unlike the allpass structures, the transfer function and the tunable parameters of the ladder WDF are derived from the analog lter equivalent of the digital <b>shelving</b> and equalizing lters. For the <b>shelving</b> WDF, the cut-o frequency and gain are tunable, while for the equalizing WDF, the tunable parameters are the center frequency, 3 -dB bandwidth and gain. The transfer functions are derived and shown {{in terms of the}} tunable coecients for both the <b>shelving</b> and equalizing WDFs. Key Words: Tunable parameters, audio <b>shelving</b> lters, equalizing lters, wave digital lters. 1...|$|R

50|$|The primary {{aspect of}} the {{management}} of physical evidence is the provision of suitable storage facility. Storage facilities for evidence can vary in size from a single secure cabinet in an office to large dedicated warehouses.The physical storage of evidence in modern departments is often accomplished using hi-density <b>shelving</b> systems. These systems allow use of only one aisle to access several rows of <b>shelving</b> by means of rolling carriages that have <b>shelving</b> mounted to them.This results in storing double the amount of evidence in the same space {{that would be used}} on static <b>shelving.</b> These hi-density system can accommodate <b>shelving,</b> <b>shelving</b> with lockable drawers, bulk rack, pallet rack, and lockable cabinets. In addition hi-density style systems can lock off specific aisles for the various degrees of security often needed for items such as guns and drugs.|$|R

Inspired {{by the events of}} the 1991 University of Iowa shooting, and initially scheduled for a 2007 release, producers and investors decided to <b>shelve</b> Dark Matter out of respect for the Virginia Tech massacre in April 2007. The drama received negative to mixed reviews upon its limited 2008 release. Streep played a U.S. government official who investigates an Egyptian foreign national suspected of terrorism in the political thriller Rendition (2007), directed by Gavin Hood. Keen to get involved in a thriller film, Streep welcomed the opportunity to star in a film genre for which she was not usually offered scripts and immediately signed on to the project. Upon its release, Rendition was less commercially successful, and received mixed reviews.|$|E
5|$|The Briarcliff {{library is}} open seven days per week, except in August {{when it is}} closed each Sunday.

5|$|Britain {{contributed to}} the Manhattan Project by helping {{initiate}} the effort to build the first atomic bombs in the United States during World War II, and helped carry it through to completion in August 1945 by supplying crucial expertise. Following the discovery of nuclear fission in uranium, scientists Rudolf Peierls and Otto Frisch at the University of Birmingham calculated, in March 1940, that the critical mass of a metallic sphere of pure uranium-235 was as little as , and would explode {{with the power of}} thousands of tons of dynamite. The Frisch‚ÄìPeierls memorandum prompted Britain to create an atomic bomb project, known as Tube Alloys. Mark Oliphant, an Australian physicist working in Britain, was instrumental in making the results of the British MAUD Report known in the United States in 1941 by a visit in person. Initially the British project was larger and more advanced, but after the United States entered the war, the American project soon outstripped and dwarfed its British counterpart. The British government then decided to <b>shelve</b> its own nuclear ambitions, and participate in the American project.|$|E

5|$|During the 1997 season, Webber was {{approached}} by Mercedes-AMG to compete in sportscar racing. Although he initially declined the offer he was persuaded {{at the end of}} the year when invited to participate in a test session for the team at the A1-Ring in Austria. Mercedes-AMG were suitably impressed with Webber, and he was signed as the official Mercedes works junior driver for the 1998 FIA GT Championship, alongside reigning champion Bernd Schneider. Travelling around the world, including the United States, Japan and Europe, the pair won five of the ten rounds on their way to second in the overall standings, beaten to the Championship by teammates Klaus Ludwig and Ricardo Zonta by just eight seconds in the final race at Laguna Seca. Webber remained with the Mercedes-AMG team for 1999, and was promoted to his own race car for the season. However, his sportscar career came to an early end after he flipped twice on the Mulsanne Straight during practice for the 1999 24 Hours of Le Mans race. An aerodynamic fault on the team's Mercedes-Benz CLRs caused Webber to become spectacularly airborne during both practice and race-day warm up, with the same fate befalling teammate Peter Dumbreck five hours into the race. Both drivers escaped uninjured, but the crashes forced Mercedes to <b>shelve</b> their sportscar program for the year and Webber to reconsider a return to open wheel racing.|$|E
5|$|The Hollywood Reporter ran {{a front-page}} story on January 13 that Hearst papers were about to run a series of editorials attacking Hollywood's {{practice}} of hiring refugees and immigrants for jobs {{that could be done}} by Americans. The goal was to put pressure on the other studios to force RKO to <b>shelve</b> Kane. Many of those immigrants had fled Europe after the rise of fascism and feared losing the safe haven of the United States. Soon afterwards, Schaefer was approached by Nicholas Schenck, head of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's parent company, with an offer on the behalf of Louis B. Mayer and other Hollywood executives to RKO Pictures of $805,000 to destroy all prints of the film and burn the negative. Once RKO's legal team reassured Schaefer, the studio announced on January 21 that Kane would be released as scheduled, and with one of the largest promotional campaigns in the studio's history. Schaefer brought Welles to New York City for a private screening of the film with the New York corporate heads of the studios and their lawyers. There was no objection to its release provided that certain changes, including the removal or softening of specific references that might offend Hearst, were made. Welles agreed and cut the running time from 122 minutes to 119 minutes. The cuts satisfied the corporate lawyers.|$|E
