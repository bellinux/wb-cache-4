25|$|The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is {{an action}} {{role-playing}} {{game with a}} third-person perspective. Players control Geralt of Rivia, a monster hunter known as a Witcher. Geralt walks, runs, rolls and dodges, and (for {{the first time in}} the series) jumps, climbs and swims. He has a variety of weapons, including bombs, a crossbow and two swords (one steel and one silver). Players can draw out, switch and <b>sheathe</b> their swords at will. There are two modes of melee attack; light attacks are fast but weak, and heavy attacks are slow and strong. Players can block and counter enemy attacks with their swords. Swords have limited endurance and require regular repair. In addition to physical attacks, Geralt has five magical signs at his disposal: Aard, Axii, Igni, Yrden and Quen. Aard prompts Geralt to unleash a telekinetic blast, Axii confuses enemies, Igni burns them, Yrden slows them down and Quen offers players a temporary, protective shield. The signs use stamina, and cannot be used indefinitely. Players can use mutagens to increase Geralt's magic power. They lose health when they are attacked by enemies, although wearing armour can help reduce health loss. Health can be restored with meditation or consumables, such as food and potions. Players control Ciri, Geralt's adoptive daughter who can teleport short distances, in certain parts of the game.|$|E
25|$|Muhammad Shah I's draft on Vijayanagara Empire's {{treasury}} in 1365 incensed {{the king}} king Bukka Raya I, who insulted the envoy with {{the draft and}} besieged the fort of Mudgal held by no less than 800 Muslim troops. Many men, {{women and children were}} killed. The fortress fell and its garrison was massacred before any relief could reach it. Ferishta's claim of only one survivor narrating the incident to the Sulatn may be one-sided. Muhammad in response attacked Bukka's army and vowed to not <b>sheathe</b> his sword until he avenged the massacre by killing 100,000 Hindus. At Raichur Doab, Muhammad killed 70,000 Hindus. He pursued Bukka throughout his dominions and the slaughtered no less than 400,000 Hindus around Vijaynagara. Bukka sued for peace and even the Muslim officers were moved to beg on hopes the slaughter might cease. Muhammad replied that though he had killed four times the number of Hindus than his promise, he will not desist until the draft on treasury was honored. The envoys agreed to this, resulting in an end to the war. The Hindus shocked by the bloodshed called on both parties to avoid killing non-combatants in the future. Muhammad agreed and the agreement, though sometimes violated, was to some extent successful in stopping the atrocities during the long period of intermittent warfare between the two kingdoms.|$|E

40|$|Load-bearing cold-formed steel (CFS) walls <b>sheathed</b> {{with double}} layers of gypsum {{plasterboard}} {{on both sides}} have demonstrated good fire resistance and attracted increasing interest for use in mid-rise CFS structures. As the main connection method, screw connections between CFS and gypsum <b>sheathing</b> {{play an important role}} in both the structural design and fire resistance of this wall system. However, studies on the mechanical behavior of screw connections with double-layer gypsum <b>sheathing</b> are still limited. In this study, 200 monotonic tests of screw connections with single- or double-layer gypsum <b>sheathing</b> at both ambient and elevated temperatures were conducted. The failure of screw connections with double-layer gypsum <b>sheathing</b> in shear was different from that of single-layer gypsum <b>sheathing</b> connections at ambient temperature, and it could be described as the breaking of the loaded <b>sheathing</b> edge combined with significant screw tilting and the loaded <b>sheathing</b> edge flexing fracture. However, the screw tilting and flexing fracture of the loaded <b>sheathing</b> edge gradually disappear at elevated temperatures. In addition, the influence of the loaded edge distance, double-layer <b>sheathing</b> and elevated temperatures is discussed in detail with clear conclusions. A unified design formula for the shear strength of screw connections with gypsum <b>sheathing</b> is proposed for ambient and elevated temperatures with adequate accuracy. A simplified load–displacement model with the post-peak branch is developed to evaluate the load–displacement response of screw connections with gypsum <b>sheathing</b> at ambient and elevated temperatures...|$|R

2500|$|Bridges {{worked in}} Jamaica where {{his books and}} {{publications}} caused difficulties. His annals, volume 2 {{was the subject of}} a libel case thousands of miles away in England. The case revolved around two men, Louis Celeste Lecesne and his brother-in-law John Escoffery, who were thrown off the island using powers under an Aliens Act. His libel against Lecesne and Escoffery was that Bridges wrote that they [...] "were impatient to <b>sheathe</b> their daggers in the breasts of its white inhabitants". The case resulted in the publisher having to withdraw the second volume of the book. With the publisher's assistance the volume was amended and reissued. This was not the last time that Bridges' behaviour would be discussed in London.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{not all of}} Dorgon's {{policies}} were equally popular nor easily implemented. The controversial July 1645 edict (the [...] "haircutting order") forced adult Han Chinese men to shave the front of their heads and comb the remaining hair into the queue hairstyle which was worn by Manchu men, on pain of death. The popular description of the order was: [...] "To keep the hair, you lose the head; To keep your head, you cut the hair." [...] To the Manchus, this policy was a test of loyalty and an aid in distinguishing friend from foe. For the Han Chinese, however, it was a humiliating reminder of Qing authority that challenged traditional Confucian values. The Classic of Filial Piety (Xiaojing) held that [...] "a person's body and hair, being gifts from one's parents, {{are not to be}} damaged." [...] Under the Ming dynasty, adult men did not cut their hair but instead wore it {{in the form of a}} top-knot. [...] The order triggered strong resistance to Qing rule in Jiangnan and massive killing of Han Chinese. It was Han Chinese defectors who carried out massacres against people refusing to wear the queue. Li Chengdong, a Han Chinese general who had served the Ming but surrendered to the Qing, ordered his Han troops to carry out three separate massacres in the city of Jiading within a month, resulting in tens of thousands of deaths. At the end of the third massacre, there was hardly a living person left in this city. Jiangyin also held out against about 10,000 Han Chinese Qing troops for 83 days. When the city wall was finally breached on 9 October 1645, the Han Chinese Qing army led by the Han Chinese Ming defector Liu Liangzuo (劉良佐), who had been ordered to [...] "fill the city with corpses before you <b>sheathe</b> your swords," [...] massacred the entire population, killing between 74,000 and 100,000 people. The queue was the only aspect of Manchu culture which the Qing forced on the common Han population. The Qing required people serving as officials to wear Manchu clothing, but allowed non-official Han civilians to continue wearing Hanfu (Han clothing).|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this paper}} was to report 2 {{patients}} (3 eyes) with proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) who showed marked <b>sheathing</b> of the retinal arterioles that was ultimately attributed to calcification following vitrectomy. Cases: Case 1 involved a 65 -year-old female with PDR who underwent bilateral vitrectomy for traction retinal detachment. Postoperatively, bilateral retinal redetachment (reRD) was observed. <b>Sheathing</b> of the retinal arterioles was observed at the same time, yet was not apparent preoperatively. Case 2 involved a 71 -year-old female with PDR who underwent vitrectomy for vitreous hemorrhage. Postoperatively, reRD was observed, and fundus findings showed <b>sheathing</b> of the retinal arterioles. In both patients, silicone oil tamponade and retinopexy were performed at reoperation, but <b>sheathing</b> of the retinal arterioles persisted postoperatively. Fluorescein fundus angiography showed that retinal blood flow was maintained, and no vessel leakage occurred. In addition, no <b>sheathing</b> of the retinal veins was observed. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) showed a higher intensity for retinal arterioles with <b>sheathing</b> than for normal retinal arterioles. Conclusion: Vessel <b>sheathing</b> in our 2 patients (3 eyes) differed from the <b>sheathing</b> seen in vasculitis. Based on the hyperintensity on OCT, this <b>sheathing</b> may have been due to retinal artery calcification induced by hypoxia and inflammation associated with reRD...|$|R

40|$|Incombustibility is one {{important}} {{advantage of the}} sheet steel <b>sheathed</b> shear wall over wood panel <b>sheathed</b> shear wall. Compared to shear wall <b>sheathed</b> with plywood and OSB panel, shear wall <b>sheathed</b> with flat sheet steel behaved lower shear strength. Although shear wall <b>sheathed</b> with corrugated sheet steel exhibited high nominal strength and high stiffness, the shear wall usually behaved lower ductility resulting from brittle failure at {{the connection between the}} <b>sheathing</b> to frames. This research is aimed at developing modifications on the corrugated <b>sheathing</b> to improve the ductility of the shear wall as well as derive practical response modification factor by establishing correct relationship between ductility factor ? and response modification factor R.

40|$|Gypsum {{board is}} the most {{commonly}} used <b>sheathing</b> material in Canadian residential construction. Current Canadian standards recognize the role of gypsum-board <b>sheathing</b> in bracing studs to prevent weak-axis buckling and in resisting in-plane shear, but do not recognize its potential contribution to axial compressive resistance of a <b>sheathed</b> wall. The research in this thesis, therefore, investigates this contribution for light-frame wood stud walls <b>sheathed</b> with gypsum-board {{on both sides of the}} stud. The axial compressive resistance of bare and gypsum-board <b>sheathed</b> studs were computed using new finite element models that account for the nonlinear wood stress-strain relationship and nonlinear shear load-slip response of gypsum-board-to-stud fastener connections. These models were validated using full-scale test data for 100 bare and 19 <b>sheathed</b> studs, and with an idealized responses of fastener connections derived using test data from 283 monotonic and 15 load-reversal tests. The strength distributions of the axial capacities of bare and <b>sheathed</b> studs were quantified by conducting Monte Carlo simulations using these models. As a result, it was determined that gypsum-board <b>sheathing</b> increases the axial compressive resistance of wood studs by a factor of 1. 05 to 1. 56, depending on the stud size, stud length, gypsum-board thickness, and fastener spacing. A modification factor that conforms to the current CAN/CSA- 086 - 09 equations (CWC, 2009) to account for the strength increment provided by the gypsum-board <b>sheathing</b> was then derived as a function modulus of elasticity of the wood for various stud sizes and lengths, gypsum-board thicknesses, and fastener spacings. The revised equation was used to compute the factored axial compressive resistance of 2400 and 3600 mm long gypsum-board-sheathed 38 x 89 and 38 x 140 mm wood studs. A total of 15 additional stud designs are recommended to be included in Part 9 “Housing and Small Buildings” of National Building Code of Canada (NRC, 2010) when the extra strength provided by 12. 7 mm or 15. 9 mm gypsum-board <b>sheathing,</b> with a maximum fastener spacing of 300 mm, is accounted for...|$|R

40|$|Fire {{performance}} of {{light gauge steel}} framed (LSF) walls <b>sheathed</b> with gypsum plasterboards has been investigated using experimental and numerical studies by many researchers in the past. Provision of cavity or external insulation, improving the thermal-mechanical properties of plasterboard, and changing the stud geometry are several options previously employed to enhance the Fire Resistance Level (FRL) of such wall systems. Past studies of steel <b>sheathed</b> cold-formed steel (CFS) framed walls {{have shown that the}} use of steel <b>sheathing</b> improves the shear strength of LSF walls. However, such studies have not investigated the possible improvements to the fire {{performance of}} LSF walls due to the use of steel <b>sheathing</b> in addition to plasterboards. This numerical study investigates the thermal performance of three common LSF wall configurations <b>sheathed</b> with steel sheets on both sides under fire conditions. Three steel <b>sheathing</b> configurations (internal and/or external <b>sheathing)</b> were considered for each LSF wall. Thermal Finite Element (FE) models were developed and used to simulate the heat progression across the walls, following validation using previous experimental studies. The walls were exposed to ISO 834 - 1 standard fire curve on one side. Results were then compared with those from LSF walls <b>sheathed</b> only with plasterboards. Internal steel <b>sheathing</b> was found to be capable of reducing the ambient side temperatures compared to plasterboard only walls due to the lower emissivity of steel, whereas external steel <b>sheathing</b> increased them further. Although the stud hot flange (HF) temperatures are generally increased with the addition of steel sheets, provision of back-blocking was able to eliminate this deficiency. A novel arrangement is proposed for back-blocking which is found to significantly delay the stud temperature rise and improve the FRL. The use of corrugated steel sheet profiles is found to reduce both the stud and ambient side plasterboard temperatures. The results from this study give useful information to develop load bearing and non-load bearing LSF walls with superior fire performance. This paper presents the details of this numerical study and the results...|$|R

5000|$|As {{part of the}} USRA, {{two common}} boxcar designs were developed: a single <b>sheathed</b> car and a double <b>sheathed</b> car. When the USRA boxcars were being {{designed}} there wasn't an industry consensus on which was better, so both were built. Freight car design was still in flux {{in the early part}} of the 20th century. As John White points out in The American Freight Car, most cars were really composites, not completely wood or steel, and even after steel cars had become the norm, wood had its uses and advantages. Still, steel underframes had come to replace wood underframes, but as metallurgy improved, there were new designs developed that took advantage of the improved technology. USRA double <b>sheathed</b> boxcars had a fishbelly underframe while the USRA single <b>sheathed</b> cars did not. In general, double <b>sheathed</b> boxcars are like girder bridges, so all the support needs to come from the frame. Those cars need a stronger frame, hence the fishbelly underframe. Single <b>sheathed</b> cars are like truss bridges, with the metal side bracing acting as the main structural support for the “bridge.” While some engineers did not trust the steel bracing to support a single <b>sheathed</b> car and ordered fishbelly frames for strength, others valued the savings in weight and ordered cars with simpler frames like the USRA SS design.|$|R
