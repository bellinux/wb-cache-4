40|$|Historically, various {{techniques}} {{have been used}} in acoustics to attempt to establish and to measure sound pressures. At present the most accurate, precise, and convenient methods over a broad range of frequencies involve the primary calibration of laboratory <b>standard</b> <b>microphones</b> by “reciprocity techniques. ” The adoption of these reciprocity techniques followed many years of exacting work involving other measurement techniques and other investigators. In the paper, Absolute Pressure Calibrations of Microphones [1], Richard K. Cook provided both theoretical and practical understanding of these new techniques.

5000|$|For {{airborne}} acoustics, the reciprocity {{technique is}} currently the most precise method available for microphone calibration (i.e. has the smallest uncertainty of measurement). [...] Free field reciprocity calibration (to give the free-field response, {{as opposed to the}} pressure response of the microphone) follows the same principles and roughly the same method as pressure reciprocity calibration, but in practice is much more difficult to implement. As such it is more usual to perform reciprocity calibration in an acoustical coupler, and then apply a correction if the microphone is to be used in free-field conditions; such corrections are standardised for laboratory <b>standard</b> <b>microphones</b> (IEC/TS 61094-7) and are generally available from the manufacturers of most of the common microphone types.|$|R

5000|$|The Varitone was a woodwind {{pickup and}} effects unit, {{allowing}} direct amplification {{of the instrument}} (i.e. without a <b>standard</b> <b>microphone)</b> {{and the introduction of}} various electronic effects. It was marketed in 1967 by the Selmer Company, which developed units for flute, saxophone, and clarinet. The system included an integrated pickup microphone and a control box which allowed the player to use effects such as tremolo, basic EQ ("bright" [...] and [...] "dark"), simultaneous sub-octaves and echo in conjunction with a purpose built amplifier. The ceramic microphone was developed to withstand high sound pressure and moisture levels, and built into the head joint of the flute, the neck-joint of the saxophone, and the barrel joint of the clarinet. The pickup was wired to a preamplifier and control box which was either mounted to the bottom key guard, clipped to the player's belt, or hung on a cord around the players neck.|$|E
5000|$|In {{order to}} take a {{scientific}} measurement with a microphone, its precise sensitivity must be known (in volts per pascal). Since this may change over the lifetime of the device, {{it is necessary to}} regularly [...] calibrate measurement microphones. This service is offered by some microphone manufacturers and by independent testing laboratories. Microphone calibration by certified laboratories should ultimately be traceable to primary standards a (National) Measurement Institute that is a signatory to International Laboratory Accreditation Cooperation. These could include [...] the National Physical Laboratory in the UK, PTB in Germany, NIST in the USA and the National Measurement Institute, Australia, where the reciprocity calibration (see below) is the internationally recognised means of realising the primary standard. Laboratory standard microphones calibrated using this method are used in-turn to calibrate other microphones using comparison calibration techniques (‘secondary calibration’), referencing the output of the ‘test’ microphone against that of the reference laboratory <b>standard</b> <b>microphone.</b>|$|E
50|$|Intercom {{systems are}} widely used in TV {{stations}} and outside broadcast vehicles such as those seen at sporting events or entertainment venues. There are essentially {{two different types of}} intercoms used in the television world: two-wire party line or four-wire matrix systems. In the beginning, TV stations would simply build their own communication systems using old phone equipment. However, today there are several manufacturers offering off-the-shelf systems. From the late 1970s until the mid-90s, the two-wire party line-type systems were the most popular, primarily due to the technology that was available at the time. The two-channel variety used a 32-volt impedance-generating central power supply to drive external stations or belt packs. This type of format allowed the two channels to operate in <b>standard</b> <b>microphone</b> cable, a feature highly desired by the broadcasters. These systems were very robust and simple to design, maintain and operate but had limited capacity and flexibility as they were usually hardwired. A typical user on the system could not choose whom to talk to. He would communicate with the same person or group of people until the system was manually reconfigured to allow communication with a different group of people. Two-wire routers or source assignment panels were then implemented to allow quick re-routing. This reconfiguration was usually handled at a central location, but because voltage is used on the circuit to power the external user stations as well as communicate, there would usually be a pop when the channels were switched. So while one could change the system on-the-fly, it was usually not desirable {{to do so in the}} middle of a production, as the popping noise would distract the rest of the television crew.|$|E

Afterwards a listening test validates the previous results. Additionally several practical remarks regarding HRTF measurement and available HRTF sets are given.

30|$|We {{present a}} novel {{approach}} to real-time spatial rendering of realistic auditory environments and sound sources recorded live, in the field. Using a set of <b>standard</b> <b>microphones</b> distributed throughout a real-world environment, we record the sound field simultaneously from several locations. After spatial calibration, we segment from this set of recordings a number of auditory components, together with their location. We compare existing time delay of arrival estimation techniques between pairs of widely spaced microphones and introduce a novel efficient hierarchical localization algorithm. Using the high-level representation thus obtained, we can edit and rerender the acquired auditory scene over a variety of listening setups. In particular, we can move or alter the different sound sources and arbitrarily choose the listening position. We can also composite elements of different scenes together in a spatially consistent way. Our approach provides efficient rendering of complex soundscapes which would be challenging to model using discrete point sources and traditional virtual acoustics techniques. We demonstrate {{a wide range of}} possible applications for games, virtual and augmented reality, and audio visual post production.|$|R
40|$|In <b>standard</b> <b>microphone</b> array {{processing}} for distant speech recognition, the beamformed output is postfiltered to reduce residual noise. Postfiltering is usually performed through a Weiner filter whose parameters are estimated {{from both the}} beamformer output and the signals captured at the microphones themselves. Conventional postfiltering methods assume diffuse or incoherent noise at the various microphones in order to estimate these parameters. When the noise does not conform to this assumption they perform poorly. We propose an alternate postfiltering mechanism that attenuates noise by estimating and separating out the contributions of speech and noise explicitly. Experiments on a corpus of in-car two-channel recordings show that the proposed postfiltering algorithm outperforms conventional postfilters significantly under many noise conditions...|$|E
