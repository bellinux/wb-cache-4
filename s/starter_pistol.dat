On {{the day of the}} Homecoming football game, the Wreck leads the Ramblin' Wreck Parade, then leads the football team onto the field.|$|E
5|$|Having {{escaped the}} {{buildings}} {{in a variety}} of ways (including through doors and out of windows), some students found themselves impeded by a river that adjoined the school. However, some were able to use rowing boats as a means of escape. Saari started fires at several other locations within the school buildings, and the fire in the exam room damaged some of the bodies so badly that they had to be identified from DNA and dental records. Nine of the victims were found in the exam room, and one in a nearby corridor. It was later ascertained that this student had fled the burning classroom and then died in the corridor. Eight of the victims were female students, one a male student, and one a male member of staff. All of the students killed were in their 20s, and the teacher was in his 50s. A 21-year-old woman was shot in the head but had two operations in the days after sustaining her injury, and was reported as being in a satisfactory condition. A further ten students were treated for minor injuries including sprains and cuts from broken glass. All the victims were classmates of Saari's. Saari was originally from Pohjois-Pohjanmaa, but lived in Kauhajoki where he was enrolled on his catering course at the college. It was later revealed that the male student was probably a close friend of Saari's. The pair had spent an evening out together in February 2008 when they were threatened with a <b>starter</b> <b>pistol.</b> A photo of them together had been circulating on the Internet, in which Saari jokingly points at his friend's head with his forefinger. The names of the other victims were withheld by police.|$|E
25|$|Des Plaines {{police were}} {{convinced}} Gacy was behind Piest's disappearance and checked Gacy's record, discovering {{that he had}} an outstanding battery charge against him in Chicago and had served a prison sentence in Iowa for the sodomy of a 15-year-old boy. A search of Gacy's house on December 13 was ordered by a judge at the request of detectives and turned up several suspicious items: a 1975 high school class ring engraved with the initials J.A.S., various driver's licenses, handcuffs, a two-by-four with holes drilled in the ends, books on homosexuality and pederasty, a syringe, male clothing too small for Gacy, a 6mm Brevettata <b>starter</b> <b>pistol</b> and a photo receipt from the pharmacy where Robert Piest worked. Police decided to confiscate Gacy's Oldsmobile, along with other PDM vehicles, and assigned two two-man surveillance teams to follow Gacy, while they continued their investigation of Gacy regarding Piest's disappearance.|$|E

500|$|The 60th Boat Race {{took place}} on 1 April 1903.

500|$|During {{this time}} Moon joined his first serious band: the Escorts, {{replacing}} {{his best friend}} Gerry Evans.

In April 1964, at age seventeen, he auditioned for the Who as a replacement for Doug Sandom. The Beachcombers continued as a local cover band after his departure.|$|E
500|$|Oxford won the toss {{and elected}} {{to start from}} the Surrey station, handing the Middlesex {{side of the river}} to Cambridge. [...] On a strong tide, umpire Pitman {{attempted}} to start the race at 3:35p.m. [...] After he shouted [...] "Are you ready?", Cambridge squared their blades and were dragged away from their stakeboat, and rowed on despite Pitman failing to correctly discharge the <b>starter</b> <b>pistol.</b> [...] Worse, he failed to notice the departing Light Blues who were already one third of a length ahead before Oxford got on their way. [...] Somewhat dismayed by the disadvantageous start, author and the number seven for this year's race George Drinkwater stated they [...] "rowed like a beaten crew from the first stroke." ...|$|E

50|$|On {{an outdoor}} 400 metres running track, the 100 m is {{run on the}} home straight, with the start usually being set on an {{extension}} {{to make it a}} straight-line race.

5000|$|Although he had {{a history}} of mental illness, police {{investigated}} his claims that he was part of a four-man operation to assassinate the president. He claimed that he had been approached by three Latino men staying at the Alan Hotel who gave him the <b>starter</b> <b>pistol,</b> and asked him to shoot it into the ground to create a diversion, so they could then shoot the president from their hotel room during the distraction. According to Harvey, he fired seven blank rounds from the <b>starter</b> <b>pistol</b> on the hotel roof on the night of May 4, to test how much noise it would make. He then spent the night in a room taken by one of the men, whom he knew as [...] "Julio", but who was later identified as a 21-year-old illegal Mexican alien who gave the name Osvaldo Espinoza Ortiz. At the time of his arrest, Harvey had eight spent rounds in his pocket, as well as 70 unspent blank rounds for the gun.|$|E

50|$|The {{band was}} formed in 1919.

While the inventor of the scramble band technique remains in debate, the HUB maintains a strong claim to the title.

5|$|Runners {{start the}} race from a {{standing}} position along a curved starting line and after hearing the <b>starter's</b> <b>pistol</b> they head towards the innermost track to follow the quickest route to the finish. In 800m races athletes begin at a staggered starting point before the turn in the track and they must remain in their lanes for the first 100m of the race. This rule was introduced {{to reduce the amount}} of physical jostling between runners in the early stages of the race. Physiologically, these middle-distance events demand that athletes have good aerobic and anaerobic energy producing systems, and also that they have strong speed endurance.|$|R
5000|$|An impulse {{response}} is {{a recording of}} the reverberation that is caused by an acoustic space when an ideal impulse is played. However, an ideal impulse is a mathematical construct, and cannot exist in reality, {{as it would have}} to be infinitesimally narrow in time. Therefore, approximations have to be used: the sound of an electric spark, <b>starter</b> <b>pistol</b> shot or the bursting of a balloon, for instance. A recording of this approximated ideal impulse may be used directly as an {{impulse response}}. Techniques involving starter pistols and balloons are sometimes referred to as transient methods, and the response is contained at the beginning of the recording in an impulse.|$|E
50|$|The {{races are}} run every August during, {{and as a}} feature of, the Tillamook County Fair. Drivers use {{stripped}} Model T Fords with stock mechanicals. Five cars are lined up with the engines off at the start line of the Averill Arena horse racing track. Drivers stand next to the grandstands. When the <b>starter</b> <b>pistol</b> fires, the drivers run {{to the opposite side}} of the front straight, grab a live 20-pound pig from a bin, then must hand-crank their car and drive it one lap. They then stop, kill the engine, get a different pig, and race another lap. The first driver to complete three laps in this manner without losing their pig is the winner.|$|E
