500|$|Despite his accident, Herbert {{suffered}} {{no physical}} injuries, {{except for a}} bruised left knee. He expressed disappointment in his late exit in his final Formula One race, saying that [...] "I'm pretty disappointed {{to have a good}} race ruined by a failure such as that." [...] Herbert left Formula One after 12 years with 161 race starts and 3 wins. Jaguar technical director Gary Anderson traced the suspension failure to a broken link on the rear right <b>suspension</b> <b>rod.</b> Herbert continued to participate in motor racing in 2001 driving in the 24 Hours of Le Mans and the American Le Mans Series. He later abandoned plans to drive in CART and became a test driver for the Arrows team in February 2001. Diniz, meanwhile, could not find a race seat and became a shareholder in the Prost team to assist in helping the outfit become more competitive.|$|E
2500|$|Buller, Verstappen, Chang, Cao, Goddard {{were also}} {{caught up in}} the incident. Additionally, one of Pommer's front wheels was danging off its <b>suspension</b> <b>rod</b> and Fuoco {{appeared}} to have sustained bodywork damage. Merhi was forced to switch to a worn tyre as he sustained a puncture by running over carbonfibre shrapnel. Since the track was blocked with multiple cars stranded, the race was red-flagged to a halt. Several cars were repaired by their teams to enable their drivers to continue racing. The cars of Ocon, Blomqvist, Cao, Goddard and Kanamaru were too heavily damaged and were forced to retire. Seventy minutes later, the Grand Prix restarted behind the safety car. Fuoco chose to drive into the pit lane since his team repaired his car until the last minute before the restart. The safety car was withdrawn after two laps and racing resumed with Rosenqvist leading teammate Auer. Auer slipstreamed onto the back of Rosenqvist and passed him on the run down to Lisboa corner for the lead. However Auer again out-braked himself and ran deep at the turn. Cassidy took advantage of his error to claim third. On the same lap, King lost sixth place to Coletti while Wells overtook Cheng for 15th and Verstappen moved past Buller.|$|E
50|$|The Atom’s {{suspension}} {{derives from}} single seat racing cars and is fully adjustable, requiring only a spanner/wrench. Both {{front and rear}} double unequal length wishbones and inboard, pushrod-operated dampers contribute to the Atom’s dynamic handling. Adjustable <b>suspension</b> <b>rod</b> ends feature inboard rubber/metal bushings to promote a more comfortable road-going ride. The front and rear Bilstein dampers are also adjustable. Stacked helper coil springs and main coil springs produce a low spring rate for minor deflections and a higher rate for large ones.|$|E
50|$|The two side-spans are {{suspension}} bridges, each 270 ft long, {{with the}} <b>suspension</b> <b>rods</b> anchored {{both at the}} abutments and through rods contained within the bridge's upper walkways. The pedestrian walkways are 143 ft above the river at high tide.|$|R
50|$|The bridge {{underwent}} significant renovations from 1980-84. New cable anchors and <b>suspension</b> <b>rods</b> {{were installed}} and {{the bridge was}} re-painted. The cost of the renovations was over $2.8 million {{which is more than}} the original purchase price when adjusted for inflation up until the 1980s.|$|R
25|$|The rail deck is {{supported}} above the arches by twelve 14 inch square columns at 9ft 11in centres. <b>Suspension</b> <b>rods</b> supported the road deck, and both decks had {{two layers of}} diagonally laid three-inch deck timbers on suitable wrought iron cross girders (and rail-bearers {{in the case of}} the rail deck).|$|R
5000|$|For {{materials}} requiring fabrication, such as {{reinforcing steel}} and structural steel, the architect and engineer need to verify details furnished by the fabricator {{as well as}} the required quantities are met. The details from the fabricator reflect both material availability and production expediency. One tragic example of a submitted alternate design is the <b>suspension</b> <b>rod</b> and bolting details resulting in the Hyatt Regency walkway collapse. The steel fabricator was unable to produce lengths of steel as originally designed and proposed using shorter lengths. The proposed alternate compounded the loads on the bolts, which resulted in the skywalks collapsing on July 17, 1981. 114 people were killed.|$|E
5000|$|Certain {{load-bearing}} structures with discrete structural components can {{be subject}} to the [...] "zipper effect", where the failure of a single structural member increases the load on adjacent members. In the case of the Hyatt Regency walkway collapse, a suspended walkway (which was already overstressed due to an error in construction) failed when a single vertical <b>suspension</b> <b>rod</b> failed, overloading the neighboring rods which failed sequentially (i.e. like a zipper). A bridge that can have such a failure is called fracture critical, and numerous bridge collapses have been caused by the failure of a single part. Properly designed structures use an adequate factor of safety and/or alternate load paths to prevent this type of mechanical cascade failure.|$|E

50|$|Barry {{designed}} a bascule bridge with two bridge towers built on piers. The central span was {{split into two}} equal bascules or leaves, which could be raised to allow river traffic to pass. The two side-spans were suspension bridges, with the <b>suspension</b> <b>rods</b> anchored both at the abutments and through rods contained within the bridge's upper walkways.|$|R
50|$|Much {{like its}} London counterpart, the Franz Joseph Bridge {{featured}} {{a combination of}} stay and <b>suspension</b> <b>rods.</b> The latter formed a cable which held the diagonal stay rods. The main span was 100 m long and 9.76 m wide, while the entire structure was over 240 m long. The bridge was gradually strengthened and rebuilt in the 1890s.|$|R
50|$|Original {{beadboard}} paneling {{remains on}} the second story, along with the original window surrounds and their rosette corners. The original wooden trusses are still visible in the factory wing, {{making it possible to}} see that its third floor is carries by <b>suspension</b> <b>rods</b> from the roof trusses. The stable has been extensively modified after its original use was discontinued, but it retains its original stair as well and some of its woodwork.|$|R
5000|$|An anti-sway or {{anti-roll}} bar {{is intended to}} force {{each side of the}} vehicle to lower, or rise, to similar heights, to reduce the sideways tilting (roll) of the vehicle on curves, sharp corners, or large bumps. With the bar removed, a vehicle's wheels can tilt away by much larger distances (as shown by the SUV image at right). Although there are many variations in design, a common function is to force the opposite wheel's shock absorber, spring or <b>suspension</b> <b>rod</b> to lower, or rise, to a similar level as the other wheel. In a fast turn, a vehicle tends to drop closer onto the outer wheels, and the sway bar soon forces the opposite wheel to also get closer to the vehicle. As a result, the vehicle tends to [...] "hug" [...] the road closer in a fast turn, where all wheels are closer to the body. After the fast turn, then the downward pressure is reduced, and the paired wheels can return to their normal height against the vehicle, kept at similar levels by the connecting sway bar.|$|E
50|$|Its {{principal}} (Russell Street) elevation is a symmetrical tripartite {{composition of}} dark red face brickwork dressed with contrasting painted cement Classical details. The central main entry is articulated with rendered architraves and flanking rusticated pilasters that extend the full {{height of the}} building to meet the parapet. The entry double door leaves have been replaced with modern glazed aluminium framed leaves. Above the main entry, a cantilevered concrete balcony with large decorative console brackets and a wrought iron balustrade doubles as an entry awning. Above the balcony, a glazed arch-headed aperture with rendered architrave extends to the underside of a rendered frieze below the parapet. Its detailed glazing pattern includes multi-paned margins (some panes fitted with coloured leadlights), three sashes and a door leaf (opening off the stair half landing within). The outer sections of the facade beyond the rusticated pilasters mirror each other. At ground level, walls are rendered and include a centrally placed single door and fanlight flanked by double hung sash windows. Above, smaller highlights align with {{the top of a}} heavy masonry transom. Physical evidence including decorative <b>suspension</b> <b>rod</b> brackets and cover flashings confirms the location of proposed awnings abutting these transoms. Window and fanlight sashes are original, but the door openings have been fitted with modern aluminium framed glazed leaves. Cantilevered balconies at first floor level are decorated to match the central balcony. Above the balconies, walls are finished in face brick with a rendered frieze decorated with widely spaced rosettes. French doors with fanlights are centrally placed and flanked by double hung sashes. Door leaves and upper sashes are multi paned. The elevation is crowned by a stepped rendered parapet decorated with cornices, consoles, and a central pediment.|$|E
40|$|A {{fractured}} <b>suspension</b> <b>rod</b> of drop-tank was analyzed. Fractographic features {{showed that}} the <b>suspension</b> <b>rod</b> has failed by overload. The fracture was associated with bending of the webs at the eye-end. The bending {{was found to have}} taken place due to loads acting on the <b>suspension</b> <b>rod</b> in the horizontal plane. There were no evidences of progressive failure like fatigue. Also, no metallurgical abnormalities were responsible for the failure. The source of excessive load in the horizontal plane needs to be established and corrective measures incorporated to avoid recurrence of similar failures...|$|E
25|$|A simple {{staircase}} {{with square}} balusters, turned newel post and molded rail {{rises from the}} central hall to the second story. The balustrade continues along the stairwell in the second floor hallway. Like the first floor, many original finishes remain. A door in the hallway conceals a short stair to the attic, which also mostly remains as it was originally constructed. Modern metal <b>suspension</b> <b>rods</b> {{have been added to}} support the ceiling, and one of the original wooden tie beams has been replaced with a metal one.|$|R
50|$|The {{bridge was}} built in six months between June and November 1929 {{at a cost of}} $350,000. In 1931, the Incline Railway, or simply the Incline (also known as a funicular), was added beside the bridge to reach the bottom of the gorge. In the 1950s, a {{miniature}} railroad was built by the edge of the gorge and an aerial tram was opened in 1969. In the early 1980s, the bridge was renovated with new cable anchors, <b>suspension</b> <b>rods</b> and paint. A Skycoaster attraction was added in 2003 with riders being swung out {{over the edge of the}} gorge.|$|R
40|$|The multi-scale {{description}} of dilute or semi-dilute <b>suspensions</b> involving <b>rods</b> {{has been successfully}} accomplished and applied in many scenarios of industrial interest. Many processes involve, however, the flow of <b>rod</b> <b>suspensions</b> in very narrow gaps whose thickness is {{much smaller than the}} rod length. In these conditions, the evolution of rod orientation is expected to be affected by confinement effects. In the present work, we propose a multi-scale {{description of}} rod orientation in confined conditions and simple shear flows...|$|R
40|$|We {{analyze the}} current state of the {{prospects}} and problems of using computer technology to determine the operating parameters of movement of the vehicle. Scientific works related to the study of the properties of the vehicle smooth ride are studied. The following example shows that the modern researches of smooth ride do not pay enough attention to issues associated with the processes that occur in the <b>suspension</b> <b>rod</b> of a vehicle. Scientific works related to the choice of the optimal and simple CAD system for conducting computer simulation tests are overviewed. We developed an animating model of experimental car in SOLIDWORKS environment with the staff <b>suspension</b> <b>rod</b> and the <b>suspension</b> <b>rod</b> based on four-stage arm mechanism, which allows a wide range of tests of components of the vehicle. Methodology and hardware-software complex for testing a car are developed. A test of a vehicle of category N 1 is conducted. A computer simulation of the motion of the smooth ride of the car with <b>suspension</b> <b>rod</b> based on four-stage arm mechanism is conducted. The comparative analysis of <b>suspension</b> <b>rod</b> performance based on four-stage arm mechanism is conducted. ...|$|E
40|$|Worth noticing in {{this picture}} are the two conical {{stainless}} steel supports protruding from {{the front end of}} the magnet:to each of them was attached a titanium <b>suspension</b> <b>rod</b> having the other end fixed to the cryostat outer room temperature vacuum vessel. The person is P. Viret connecting signal wires for diagnostics. See also 7702690 X...|$|E
40|$|One of the {{critical}} factors {{in the design of}} a cryogenic tank is the method of suspending the inner vessel within the outer vessel. A thermally inferior suspension system can nullify the effect of using high performance thermal insulation. The authors describe a new design of support system in which the central <b>suspension</b> <b>rod</b> is under tensile stress while the concentric tubular support is subjected to compressive stress due to acceleration loads. The design not only provides a long thermal conduction path, but also eliminates thermal contraction stresses, while allowing marginal assembly misalignments...|$|E
50|$|Best's Covered Bridge {{is located}} about 8 mi west of Windsor's village center, {{just south of}} VT 44 on Churchill Road. It is a {{single-span}} laminated arch structure, with a total length of 37 ft and a roadway width of 12.5 ft (one lane). It rests on stone abutments. The arch is formed out of five layers of planking that have been laminated and bolted together. The floor stringers are supported by iron <b>suspension</b> <b>rods</b> descending from the arches, which are complemented by wooden posts rising above the arches. The arches are protected by a post-and-beam frame structure, its exterior clad in vertical boarding, with a metal roof overhead.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{analyses}} {{possible causes}} of {{failure of the}} rotating footbridge over the Ustka port channel. In July, 2015, strange behaviour of this object was observed {{in the form of}} excessive vibrations of bridge platform <b>suspension</b> <b>rods,</b> with the accompanying acoustic effects. A preliminary geotechnical analysis has revealed that this destructive effect was caused by the nearby construction works, namely construction of a fishing basin and communication routes in the area close to the bridge, which affected the bridge lashing rod foundation settings. Ground vibrations generated by certain construction activities were likely to have direct impact on decreasing the bearing capacity of these rods and increasing the susceptibility od the piles to extraction. After detecting the above problems in bridge operation, its geodetic monitoring was started. The data recorded during this monitoring, along with the results of force measurements in the rods, have made the basis for a series of numerical simulations, performed in the Finite Element Method (FEM) formalism. The bridge structure was analysed in the conditions defined as the emergency state. Extreme efforts of bridge elements and its dynamic characteristics were examined. A possible source of strange behaviour of the footbridge during its operation which was recognised during these simulations was the coincidence of the global natural frequency of the entire bridge structure with local vibrations of <b>suspension</b> <b>rods,</b> at the frequency approximately equal to 1 Hz. This situation was likely to lead to the appearance of the so-called internal resonance phenomenon. As a final conclusion of the research, recommendations were formulated on possible object oriented corrective actions...|$|R
2500|$|Below {{the point}} where the two {{branches}} rejoin, a new bridge carries the M180 motorway over the channel. Next come Castlethorpe bridge and Broughton bridge, both maintained by the Environment Agency. Broughton is an inverted suspension bridge, which replaced an earlier bridge in the mid- to late 19th century, but this reused the earlier abutments. The single span is supported by two wrought iron arched ribs, with vertical and diagonal <b>suspension</b> <b>rods,</b> supporting timber decking. Another railway bridge follows, this time linking [...] to Grimsby, and now carrying trains run by South TransPennine. The intake formerly owned by British Steel plc is on the west bank by the bridge, supplying water to the steel industry in Scunthorpe.|$|R
40|$|The ATLAS Barrel Toroid air-core magnet (BT) will be {{composed}} by 8 superconducting coils, each one 25 m long and 5 m wide. In order {{to validate the}} technologies and manufacturing processes, a smaller model (9 m long) of one BT coil, named B 0, is now under construction. This paper presents a general overview of the B 0 project status, with special regard to the components for which the LASA Lab. is responsible: (a) the aluminium-clad NbTi conductor; (b) the double coils winding and impregnation; (c) {{the components of the}} cryostat (vacuum chamber, thermal shield and <b>suspension</b> <b>rod).</b> (6 refs) ...|$|E
5|$|Chlorine {{is widely}} used for purifying water, {{especially}} potable water supplies and water used in swimming pools. Several catastrophic collapses of swimming pool ceilings have occurred from chlorine-induced stress corrosion cracking of stainless steel <b>suspension</b> <b>rods.</b> Some polymers are also sensitive to attack, including acetal resin and polybutene. Both materials were used in hot and cold water domestic plumbing, and stress corrosion cracking caused widespread failures in the USA in the 1980s and 1990s. The picture on the right shows a fractured acetal joint in a water supply system. The cracks started at injection molding defects in the joint and slowly grew until the part failed. The fracture surface shows iron and calcium salts that were deposited in the leaking joint from the water supply before failure.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{motion of}} an {{ellipsoidal}} particle {{immersed in a}} flow of a Newtonian fluid was obtained in the pioneering work of Jeffery in 1922. Suspensions of industrial interest usually involve particles {{with a variety of}} shapes. Moreover, <b>suspensions</b> composed of <b>rods</b> (a limit case of an ellipsoid) aggregate, leading to clusters with particular shapes that exhibit, when immersed in a flow, an almost rigid motion. In this work, we revisit the modeling and simulation of <b>suspensions</b> involving <b>rods</b> throughout the different scales of description (microscopic, mesoscopic and macroscopic) and the different concentration regimes: dilute, semi-dilute, semi-concentrated and concentrated, involving gradually richer physics...|$|R

Compat., vol. 52, no. 3, pp. 684 - 90, Aug. 2010) {{we dealt with}} current {{injection}} measurements to test the lightning protection system of a newly built pharmaceutical plant. In a tentative extrapolation, the measurements were extrapolated to actual lightning. Here, we extend the model and calculate {{the response of the}} installation on lightning currents and include resonances in the cable trays and test cables contained in it. It turned out that <b>suspension</b> <b>rods</b> between roof support and cable tray were indispensable to suppress the resonances. The time dependence of the present results and the earlier simplified model given in differ greatly, but the amplitudes of induced voltages appear to be of the same order of magnitude...|$|R
5000|$|Horkstow {{is one of}} [...] "only a handful" [...] {{of early}} {{suspension}} bridges in Britain to remain as originally designed, {{but it has not}} survived completely unscathed. In 1979, repairs were needed after the tractor unit of a 23-ton articulated lorry fell through into the river, destroying a quarter of the bridge deck and damaging the attached <b>suspension</b> <b>rods,</b> though the rest of the structure remained intact. In the 1990s, the bridge was strengthened [...] - [...] the deck relaid using a tropical hardwood timber to support a 5 t load and the underground parts of the suspension chains replaced with high-tensile bars [...] - [...] while retaining its appearance and functionality. The works earned engineers C Spencer Ltd a commendation in the 1999 Institution of Civil Engineers Historic Bridge Awards.|$|R
