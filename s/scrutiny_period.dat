It tested the political cost hypothesis for the full industry, for the large and mid-cap firms and for the firms fined by the Competition Commission. The discretionary component of total accruals was used as proxy for earnings management – calculated by using the Modified Jones Model. It was found that, in the event period, no earnings-decreasing discretionary accruals could be detected for the full industry and the large-mid cap firms. However, there were earnings-decreasing accruals for firms fined by the Competition Commission although the results were not statistically significant...|$|R

50|$|When {{applied to}} the Sun, this science is called {{helioseismology}} and has been ongoing for a few decades by now. The solar surface helium abundance was derived very accurately for the first time, which has definitely shown the importance of microscopic diffusion in the solar structure. Helioseismology analyses have also unveiled the solar internal rotational profile, the precise extent of the convective envelope {{and the location of}} the helium ionization zone. Despite enormous technical challenges, it was thus tempting to apply similar analyses to stars. From the ground this was only possible for stars close to the Sun such as α Centauri, Procyon, β Virginis... The goal is to detect extremely small light variations (down to 1 ppm) and to extract the frequencies responsible for these brightness fluctuations. This produces a frequency spectrum typical of the star under <b>scrutiny.</b> Oscillation <b>periods</b> vary from a few minutes to several hours depending of the type of star and its evolutionary state. To reach such performances, long observing times devoid of day/night alternations are required. Space is thus the ideal asteroseismic laboratory. By revealing their microvariability, measuring their oscillations at the ppm level, CoRoT has provided a new vision of stars, never reached before by any ground-based observation.|$|R

50|$|A nation’s {{current account}} balance is {{influenced}} by numerous factors - its trade policies, exchange rate, competitiveness, forex reserves, inflation rate and others.Since the trade balance (exports minus imports) is generally the biggest determinant of the current account surplus or deficit, the current account balance often displays a cyclical trend. During a strong economic expansion, import volumes typically surge; if exports are unable to grow at the same rate, the current account deficit will widen. Conversely, during a recession, the current account deficit will shrink if imports decline and exports increase to stronger economies.The currency exchange rate exerts a significant influence on the trade balance, and by extension, on the current account. An overvalued currency makes imports cheaper and exports less competitive, thereby widening the current account deficit (or narrowing the surplus). An undervalued currency, on the other hand, boosts exports and makes imports more expensive, thus increasing the current account surplus (or narrowing the deficit).Nations with chronic current account deficits often come under increased investor <b>scrutiny</b> during <b>periods</b> of heightened uncertainty. The currencies of such nations often come under speculative attack during such times. This creates a vicious circle where precious foreign exchange reserves are depleted to support the domestic currency, and this forex reserve depletion - combined with a deteriorating trade balance - puts further pressure on the currency. Embattled nations are often forced to take stringent measures to support the currency, such as raising interest rates and curbing currency outflows.|$|R

STUDY DESIGN: Using the capture-recapture method, the prevalence of NTD was estimated {{on the basis of}} five different registries on births affected by NTD. RESULTS: Total prevalence over the 1988 - 1998 period varied between 1. 43 and 1. 96 per 1000 live and still births. No decrease in total prevalence was found to have taken place during that <b>period.</b> <b>Scrutiny</b> of the last 2 years, 1997 and 1998, in which increased folic acid intake might be expected to have had an effect, did not give any indication that the prevalence of NTD was falling. CONCLUSIONS: A decrease in the Dutch prevalence of NTD during the study period could not be demonstrated due to the relatively small number of women using folic acid periconceptionally. This does not mean automatically that periconceptional folic acid use is ineffective in reducing the Dutch prevalence of NTD. Further monitoring is neede...|$|R
40|$|Deciding {{whether or}} not the colonial state was {{interested}} in supporting economic development depends upon the interpretation of a vast and often internally contradictory range of correspondence and government decisions in numerous offices, the field of activity under <b>scrutiny,</b> and the <b>period</b> under examination. Mining and railways, the focus here, were kindred enterprises {{in the late nineteenth and}} early twentieth centuries. Both were dependent on heavy machinery, the same kinds of energy resources, and, in different ways, a cooperative State. Railways were generally more certain bets for investment, while mining was more regularly the problem child of the colonial world. The present paper examines the relationship between the colonial state and railway construction and mining in colonial Burma and Ghana from the mid- 1890 s, in the context of the building of the coast-Kumasi route and the Mandalay-Lashio railway and the latter’s connection with the Burma mining railway. It was during the construction of these particular lines that tensions over routes regarding their comparative merits relative to economic development or military and political security occurred. The activities of the railway engineers and mining entrepreneurs examined here indicate the unplanned nature of railway expansion and other aspects of economic development. But these two case studies also suggest some of the dangers of emphasizing too much a singular imperial world over local nuances in seeking to understand colonial history...|$|R

40|$|Brass Bands {{have become}} a clichéd {{representation}} of northern working-class culture. Hence, in 1974, Peter Hennessy described a band contest at the Albert Hall: A roll call of the bands is like an evocation of industrial history. From Wingates Temperance and Black Dyke Mills to more modern conglomerates [ [...] . ]. Grown men, old bandsmen say, {{have been known to}} cry at the beauty of it all […]. Of all the manifestations of working-class culture, nothing is more certain than a brass band to bring on an attack of the George Orwells. Even the most hardened bourgeois cannot resist romanticizing the proletariat a little when faced with one. This stereotype, which emerged in the nineteenth century, generated the following research questions: What musical and social elements in the performance of brass band music strengthened working-class cultural identity in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries? How did bands, which thrived in large numbers in the Southern Pennines, emerge as a musical and cultural metonym of the industrial landscape? This thesis therefore examines internal and external reporting of elements of brass musicianship in brass bands that constructed working class and northern identities. An outline of music-making in the north shows how the region supported bands’ development when they began to emerge from the 1830 s. Brass musicianship and musical performance strengthened working-class cultural identity. Explorations of musical performances, leisure, rational recreation, social networks, gender and region, all combine to produce a fuller understanding of the northern working class between c. 1840 and 1914. Such influences – of class, gender and region – contributed to brass bands producing primary examples of working-class identity. Not only have brass bands been under-explored in the history of leisure, but they also add {{to the understanding of the}} origins of stereotypes about working-class culture and northern identity that emerged, and came under <b>scrutiny,</b> in this <b>period...</b>|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{traces the}} {{development}} of an independent dental profession {{in the first half of}} 20 th century Britain. First, the relevant sociological literature is reviewed and the framework of the empirical study that forms the core of the thesis is spelled out. Then the campaign for the prohibition of unregistered practice of dentistry which culminated in the passing of the Dentists Act, 1921 is analysed. The organisation of oral care services at the end of the 19 th century is sketched out and the efforts of dental practitioners to form viable and credible professional associations, to change their legal status and to expand and stabilise the market for their services are described. The second half of the thesis is devoted to the 1921 - 1956 period which ended with the adoption of the Dentists Act, 1956 which gave dentists self-regulatory powers. This Act forms the framework within which dentistry is practised in Britain today. The main issue under <b>scrutiny</b> in this <b>period</b> is how dental practitioners endeavoured to protect the occupational monopoly granted to them in 1921. As with the study of the pre- 1921 period, three areas of concern [...] -professional organisation, legislative action and the control of the market for dentists' services [...] -provide the framework of the analysis. Successive chapters are devoted to the long and difficult process of achieving unity of organisation among dentists; to the numerous attempts to amend the Dentists Act, 1921 to strengthen the profession's control of its area of work; and to the profession's struggle against attempts by the state and others to modify the system of providing oral care services, particularly by introducing new categories of dental personnel. A concluding chapter examines the issues of why dentists chose to engage in the pursuit of professional status and why their collective occupational strategies were on the whole successful. <p...|$|R

40|$|From {{the late}} 1950 s to about 1970, {{philosophers}} of education began {{to adopt a}} mode of philosophizing characterized as "the linguistic turn," after a similar change in general philosophy. This involved a {{move away from the}} older "isms" approach rooted in metaphysics towards linguistic and conceptual analysis. The linguistic turn has been attributed to intellectual history [...] the influence of ideas on a field. The central argument of this study, however, is that during the 1950 s, factors external to academia, but acting upon it, interacted with concerns by educational philosophers themselves to create the conditions for the linguistic turn. These factors included the attacks on public schooling and "educationists," the teacher education reform movement, the Ford Foundation funding of liberal arts oriented teacher preparation, and, within the academy, the concern on the part of educational philosophers for the academic legitimacy of their discipline. These factors led philosophers of education to model their discourse more closely on the reigning paradigm in general philosophy, linguistic analysis. The attacks on public schooling were centered on progressivism for its alleged anti-intellectualism and subversive character. Philosophers of education were the particular targets of these critics. Teacher preparation in education schools also came under <b>scrutiny</b> during this <b>period.</b> The Ford Foundation's Fund for the Advancement of Education underwrote major programs that centered teacher preparation in a liberal arts curriculum, with only minimal coursework devoted to professional training. In addition, the National Commission for the Accreditation of Teacher Education (NCATE) supported such a reorientation, with a concomitant weakening of educational philosophy's place in teacher education programs. Philosophers of education responded by lobbying for the inclusion of their courses in certification requirements, forging an alliance with the American Philosophical Association, reducing the social activism that had characterized earlier educational philosophers' efforts, and adopting the more academically legitimate methods of general philosophy. In the short term these actions assured educational philosophy a place in teacher education programs. In the long run, however, the linguistic turn may have jeopardized the survival of educational philosophy as an academic field by creating a chasm between philosopher and practitioner...|$|R
40|$|The {{link between}} fiscal policy and {{economic}} growth has raised {{a great deal of}} debate at both theoretical and empirical level. Public expenditure and national income have been the focus of public finance, since the amount of public expenditure has been increasing over time in almost all countries in the world. The aim {{of this study is to}} empirically examine the effects of different types of government expenditures on economic growth, with particular attention to the Italian case. The first chapter of this dissertation offers a literature review on the relationship between the size of government {{and economic growth}} to show how findings follow a contrasting pattern. Moreover, the more recent strand of the literature attempts to evaluate the influence of functional breakdown of public spending on economic growth, thus going beyond the simple division between productive and unproductive expenditure. Studies that disaggregate public expenditures in healthcare, education, defence, infrastructures, housing sector and other expenditures categories show that the results change according to the specific countries under <b>scrutiny,</b> the analysed <b>period</b> and methodologies applied. Chapter two and three examine the empirical relationship between government spending composition and economic growth within an endogenous growth framework as developed by Ghosh and Gregoriou (2008) with two public goods, one being a priori more productive than the other. In particular, the added value of the second chapter lies in its empirical analysis which is based on a panel of 19 Italian regions over the period 1996 - 2007. Our interest is to estimate the influence of economic and functional expenditure categories of the general government on real per capita GDP growth rate. The functional breakdown of expenditures includes six components, which have been obtained aggregating the thirty sectoral expenditure components on the basis of the available data. Interestingly, inside functional categories we distinguish between capital and current items. Using dynamic panel GMM estimators, economic and functional components seem not to have any significant effect on growth. However, the results improve when we take into account spatial correlation through a spatial lag model. Although there is no evidence of spatial autocorrelation in our specifications, the results show that the capital and current expenditure behaviour is driven by capital transfers and financial assets. In addition, it is also induced by current expenditure on personnel, purchases on goods and services, interest expense and other unclassified current expenditures. As for the functional components, the main result is given by capital expenditure on economic affairs, such as infrastructures, which plays an important role in augmenting the economic growth rate among Italian regions in the period investigated here. Current expenditure on health, and capital and current expenditure on general public services had a negative and statistically significant effect on growth. The third chapter offers an empirical investigation of the relationship between government spending composition and economic growth by using a historical time-series (for the period 1862 - 2007) on the Italian case. Our aim is to estimate the effects of economic and functional components of government spending on economic growth both in the short- and long-run. After testing our series for unit roots with structural breaks, we divided the sample period into two main sub-samples and estimate the influence of the different components of public spending by means of an ARDL model. Regarding the first sample (1970 - 2007), the most surprising results is the negative effect of capital expenditure on economic growth, both in the short- and in the long-run. In particular, capital expenditure appears to have been excessively high during the <b>period</b> under <b>scrutiny,</b> thus resulting unproductive at margin. On the other hand, current expenditure has an insignificant effect on economic growth both in the short- and in the long-run. Among functional components, expenditures on defence and economic affairs have a statistically significant effect on economic growth in the short-run. In contrast, the latter maintains a significant or even negative effect on real per capita GDP in the long-run only. As for the second sample period (1862 - 1969), we split it endogenously so as to establish two structural break dates. Overall, the results vary across sub-samples, but educational spending shows a positive and statistically influence on per capita GDP in the long-run...|$|R

Historically sited ideologies and cultural impacts have placed contemporary Chinese women at a crossroads of identity confusion : between adhering to the "rationality" of prevailing definitions of the "good woman" from a traditional perspective, and the "craving" for independence and success outside {{the confines of the}} home. Tensions in the ongoing redefinition of women's identity have led to both increasing diversity and to contestation in the presentation of women in media discourse. This thesis explores how women's identity is discursively constructed and how the presentation of women in Chinese print media is affected by the ambivalence inherent in such contested ideologies and cultures. It does so from three perspectives - descriptive, interpretative, and explanatory - focusing on history-honored Confucianism concerning images of ideal family identity of women before the Mao era, what one may call a neutralized gender ideology of the heroic model work identity of women during the Mao era, influences of Western cultures and feminist critiques with an associated emphasis on consumerism and individualism flooding into China in the post Mao era, and new Confucianism {{at the turn of the}} century with its emphasis on reviving traditional values. All are drawn upon in the thesis in terms of their influence on reconstructing contemporary Chinese women's identity. The dynamic transformation of stereotypical representations and the inherent contestation embedded within the conflicting double standard of being a contemporary ideal for women, reflects complex social change amidst rapid economic development and political renovation. In 1995, the Fourth World Women's Conference was held in Beijing offering a good impetus towards the development of Women's Studies in China. Since then research on women and issues of gender has attracted increasing attention involving multi-disciplinary co-operation. In 2005, UNESCO established a Chair of Media and Gender in the Communication University of China, officially beginning a significant new era of gender/media studies in China. Drawing on Fairclough's argument that, "Language use is constitutive both in conventional ways which help to reproduce and maintain existing social identities, relations and systems of knowledge, and in creative ways which help to transform them. " (Fairclough, 1995, p. 55) and van Zoonen's assertion that, "The women's movement is not only engaged in a material struggle about equal rights and opportunities for women, but also in a symbolic conflict about definitions of femininity" (van Zoonen, 1994, p. 12), this thesis concentrates on such themes as espoused in media texts, seen contrastively and historically in the Chinese context. Its methodological focus is an evidence-based discourse analytical exploration combining both linguistic and ethnographic methods, and integrating both critical and social perspectives in the study of media texts. The data collected and drawn upon are texts from 1995 to 2005 and onwards, covering those from a national newspaper (People's Daily 人民日报Renmin Ribao), a women's magazine – (Women of China 中国妇女Zhongguo Funü), an academic journal – (Collection of Women's Studies 妇女研究论丛Funü Yanjiu Luncong), and a selection of official documents (PD editorials etc.). The comparative framework – both diachronically between 1995 to 2005 datasets and synchronically between datasets of PD, WOC, CWS and PD editorials attempts to reflect changing social recognition about gender constructs as well as different media appraisals on gender ideology. Data drawn from interviews with journalist practitioners and journalism scholars are also included as counterpoints to the media and to scholarly texts and analysis. Selected narratives from these "insider" voices are documented and analysed, providing important insights into the processes in which the newspaper reports construct specific understanding and categorization of women's identity, and how they may reveal under scrutiny the ideological positions of different media during moments of social transition. The timeframe under <b>scrutiny</b> is a <b>period</b> of women's development in China since the Fourth World Women's Conference held in Beijing in 1995 – regarded as indicated above, as a very important landmark in the second/current Chinese feminist wave (Tan & Liu, 2005). The key metaphorical construction of Chinese women's identity as "Holding up Half the Sky" in a "Harmonious Society" is investigated against various data sets. The findings reveal the tensions of persistence and resistance of certain ideologies, as well as an uneasy compromising process of the relationship between women and nation, women and family, women and self in the process of addressing an overarching and pervasive Work/Family conflict among contemporary Chinese women. The focus on discursive creativity and inter-textuality throughout this analysis of media discourse corresponds to the nature of dynamic social changes taking place in modern China.
