Malmö Stad therefore voted to nationalise the ownership of both Malmö IP and other sport fields in the city in 1935, the motion passed with a small margin, 25 voted for nationalization and 23 voted for continued private ownership.

25|$|Inter{{national}} {{and national}} events {{for the sport}} include the Winter Paralympics, World Championships, World Cups, Continental Cups, National Championships, IPCAS Races and IPCAS Para-Snowboard. Skiers from 39 different countries actively compete in para-alpine skiing in a sport {{is that one of}} eight governed by the International Paralympic Committee <b>Sports</b> <b>Committee,</b> with rules for para-alpine skiing set forth in the IPCAS Rules and Regulations. Event specific rules may be created for events like the Paralympic Games. One set of rules was created in 1994 and were specified in the IPC Handbook. This was used to govern IPC-sanctioned events like the Paralympic Games for many years. Competition rules for classes use rules set by or modified from rules created by the International Ski Federation (ISF). These rules were set at the 42nd International Ski Conference in 2000. The two rule sets worked in concert with each other, with the ISF rules specifying the rules for alpine skiing, and the IPC providing modifications for para-alpine skiing. The IPC Alpine Sports Assembly Executive Committee can determine if skiers are eligible to compete in IPC sanctioned events at their own discretion regardless of what the rules say. National Paralympic Committees can have their own rule sets at national competitions.|$|E

In the months prior to the London Games, Brunei attracted media attention as it was noted that the nation was one of only three countries—along with Saudi Arabia and Qatar—never to have sent a female athlete to the Olympics. The three athletes that were selected to compete at the London Games were Ak Hafiy Tajuddin Rositi in the men's 400 metres, Maziah Mahusin in the women's 400 metres and Anderson Lim in the men's 200 metre freestyle swimming competition.
