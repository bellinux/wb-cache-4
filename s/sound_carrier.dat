5000|$|In {{order to}} provide mono [...] "compatibility", the NICAM signal is {{transmitted}} on a subcarrier alongside the <b>sound</b> <b>carrier.</b> This means that the FM or AM regular mono <b>sound</b> <b>carrier</b> is left alone for reception by monaural receivers.|$|E

50|$|At {{this point}} the IF signal {{consists}} of a video carrier signal at one frequency and the <b>sound</b> <b>carrier</b> at a fixed offset. A demodulator recovers the video signal. Also at {{the output of the}} same demodulator is a new frequency modulated <b>sound</b> <b>carrier</b> at the offset frequency. In some sets made before 1948, this was filtered out, and the sound IF of about 22 MHz was sent to an FM demodulator to recover the basic sound signal. In newer sets, this new carrier at the offset frequency was allowed to remain as intercarrier sound, and it was sent to an FM demodulator to recover the basic sound signal. One particular advantage of intercarrier sound is that when the front panel fine tuning knob is adjusted, the <b>sound</b> <b>carrier</b> frequency does not change with the tuning, but stays at the above-mentioned offset frequency. Consequently, it is easier to tune the picture without losing the sound.|$|E

50|$|So the FM <b>sound</b> <b>carrier</b> is then demodulated, amplified, {{and used}} to drive a loudspeaker. Until {{the advent of the}} NICAM and MTS systems, {{television}} sound transmissions were invariably monophonic.|$|E
50|$|This {{would have}} meant that the NTSC <b>sound</b> <b>carrier</b> {{frequency}} of 4.5 MHz above the picture carrier, would have also been the standard for Europe, and hence been a lot more common world wide.|$|E

50|$|The {{frequencies}} {{are chosen}} {{such that they}} cause minimal interference to the picture. The {{difference between the two}} <b>sound</b> <b>carriers</b> is 15.5 times the line frequency (15.5 x 15625 Hz = 242187.5 Hz) which, being an odd multiple of half line frequency, reduces the visibility of intermodulation products between the two carriers. The pilot tone frequency is 3.5 times line frequency (54687.5 Hz). The modulated tone frequency is 117.50 Hz for stereo transmission and 274.1 Hz for bilingual transmission. Absence of this tone is interpreted as a monaural transmission.|$|R

In the 1970s, the statue of the dog and gramophone, His Master's Voice, were cloaked in bronze and was awarded by the record company (EMI) to artists and or music producers and or composers as a Music Award and often only after selling more than 100.000 <b>sound</b> <b>carriers</b> such as LP's.|$|R
