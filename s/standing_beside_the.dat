5|$|The spatial {{structure}} and {{positioning of the}} mirror's reflection are such that PhilipIV and Mariana appear to be standing on the viewer's side of the pictorial space, facing the Infanta and her entourage. According to Janson, {{not only is the}} gathering of figures in the foreground for Philip and Mariana's benefit, but the painter's attention is concentrated on the couple, as he appears to be working on their portrait. Although they can only be seen in the mirror reflection, their distant image occupies a central position in the canvas, in terms of social hierarchy as well as composition. As spectators, our position in relation to the painting is uncertain. It has been debated whether the ruling couple are <b>standing</b> <b>beside</b> <b>the</b> viewer or have replaced the viewer, who sees the scene through their eyes. Lending weight to the latter idea are the gazes of three of the figures—Velázquez, the Infanta, and Maribarbola—who appear to be looking directly at the viewer.|$|E

2500|$|Albers {{attempted}} to popularize {{the game in}} Germany in 1821 with updated rules. The starting setup {{is the same as}} for medieval Courier Chess. [...] The king, queen, courier (bishop), knight, and rook have their modern powers. [...] The bishop (or archer) can move one square diagonally, or leap diagonally to the second square. [...] The fool, <b>standing</b> <b>beside</b> <b>the</b> queen, moves one square in any direction. [...] The sage, <b>standing</b> <b>beside</b> <b>the</b> king, combines the powers of the fool and the knight. [...] The pawn moves like the modern pawn, except that after reaching the farthest rank it must remain there for two moves before taking up its new career as a piece. [...] Castling is permitted, if all squares between the king and the rook are vacant, the king has not been checked, the rook is not en prise, neither has moved, and no square between them is under attack. [...] The king moves to the bishop's square, and the rook leaps over him to the courier's square, in either wing. [...] The rule on stalemate has not been preserved; the subject was unsettled in Germany well into the nineteenth century.|$|E

In Ukraine's final game, against England, Marko Dević scored a [...] "ghost goal" [...] in the second half, with Ukraine losing 1–0 to a Wayne Rooney goal. Dević's shot was hooked clear from behind the England {{goal-line}} by Shevchenko's former Chelsea teammate John Terry under {{the eyes of the}} additional assistant referee <b>standing</b> <b>beside</b> <b>the</b> goal (as confirmed by video replays). The incident reopened football's goal-line technology debate. Replays, however, also showed Artem Milevskiy should have been ruled offside before Dević's shot. After this game, Shevchenko announced he would retire from international football, having been Ukraine's youngest and oldest goalscorer and record marksman with 48 goals in 111 appearances.|$|E
