The redevelopment will also see the Mander Centre be fully refurbished and reconfigured. A number of larger stores will be created, replacing smaller ones.

25|$|Deciding {{to retail}} the Lorna Jane label themselves, in 1990, Smith and Clarkson opened their first store, in an upper floor of Brisbane's Broadway on the Mall {{shopping}} centre. Early successes confirmed for Smith {{the viability of}} her dream.

Smith and Clarkson were ecstatic at the windfall, until they realised that this meant they had no stock left. The story of Clarkson riding back to Smith's workshop on a bicycle with $25,000 cash in a bag has become a famous anecdote about the early successes of the business.|$|E

In 2006, Costco lost a lawsuit against the state of Washington in which it was seeking to purchase wine directly from the producer, bypassing the state retail monopoly. In Australia, Costco has to comply with regulations set by each state they choose trade in; their first store in the state of Victoria benefits from some of the most liberal alcohol licensing laws in the country, with retailers permitted to sell alcohol on shelves within the <b>store,</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> manner similar to most European countries.

25|$|The new Haussmann boulevards created {{space for}} new stores, {{and it became}} easier for {{customers}} to cross the city to shop. In a short time, the commerce in novelties, fabrics and clothing began to be concentrated in a few very large department stores. Bon Marché was opened in 1852 by Aristide Boucicaut, {{the former chief of}} the Petit Thomas variety <b>store,</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> modest building. His venture expanded rapidly, its income growing from 450,000 francs a year to 20 million. Boucicaut commissioned a new building with a glass and iron framework designed in part by Gustave Eiffel. It opened in 1869 and became the model for the modern department store. The Grand Magasin du Louvre opened in 1855 inside the vast luxury hotel built by the Péreire brothers next to the Louvre and the Place Royale. It was the first department store that concentrated on luxury goods, and tried both to provide bargains and be snobbish. Other department stores quickly appeared: Printemps in 1865, the Grand Bazar de l'Hôtel de Ville (BHV) in 1869, and La Samaritaine in 1870. They were soon imitated around the world.|$|E

Mulder, who accompanied Whitney on the raid, chases Dacyshyn to a building construction site. Whitney follows, and is killed when Dacyshyn pushes her down an elevator shaft. Scully, seeking a resolution, asks Joe, who has not yet heard {{of the discovery of}} Bannan's head, if he senses that she is still alive. He replies that she is. Discouraged but still determined, Mulder decides to investigate the incidents further. He starts by driving Scully's car to Nutter's Feed <b>Store</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> small town near the abductions, as the human remains contain acepromazine, an animal tranquilizer. When Dacyshyn coincidentally arrives moments later, Mulder slips out and follows him. Dacyshyn notices him, however, and runs his car off the road. Mulder survives and manages to tail Dacyshyn, who exits his truck after the engine fails, to a small compound in a former barn. Mulder enters, and the commotion caused by a two-headed guard dog brings Dacyshyn out from one of the buildings. The compound is being used by an east-European medical team that has been murdering people and stealing their organs for years. The field where Father Joe had earlier discovered the bodies turned out to be their dumping ground. Mulder enters the building to find that the team has been using the organs and body parts in an attempt to keep Tomczeszyn alive. At that moment, they attempt to place Tomczeszyn's head on the body of the second abducted woman. Mulder tries to save her from the gruesome fate, but a doctor comes from behind and injects him with a tranquilizer. Helpless, Mulder is taken outside to be murdered by Dacyshyn.|$|E

She first met Gordon in 2000 while she was employed in Palm Beach, Florida at a Neiman Marcus <b>store</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> mall where she advised customers about cosmetics products. Merryman did not recognize the race-car driver at their first meeting, though her friends were excited to meet him during the same encounter. Initially Merryman turned down Gordon's request to take her out for lunch. One year after their initial encounter, they began {{a relationship}}. They were romantically-linked for 11 months. Merryman and Gordon vacationed together in Saint-Jean, Saint Barthélemy in the Caribbean in January 2003 to celebrate the New Year. This relationship caused difficulty for his then-ongoing marriage to Brooke Sealy. Sealy discovered Gordon's relationship with Merryman and subsequently divorced the race-car driver. Gordon's wife, who also went by the name Jennifer Brooke Gordon, cited Merryman by name in her divorce papers with the racecar driver. Merryman was featured in the October 2003 issue of Playboy magazine, where she was interviewed about her relationship with Gordon. Merryman stated that Gordon had confided in her: [...] "He got married when he was 23 and has been on the racetrack since he was a kid. He used to tell me all the time he {{never had a chance to}} have fun." [...] She reflected on what she had learned after her period of time with Gordon, saying in the future she would avoid relationships both with men of his occupation and those who were married. Gordon did not comment on Merryman's 2003 appearance in the magazine. When asked about the article, Gordon refused to comment on it. He stated: [...] "It's not even worth commenting on. All I want to talk about is being fast". Gordon's divorce was finalized in June 2003.|$|E
