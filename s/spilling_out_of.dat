5|$|On {{the morning}} of February 19, 1845, a large {{earthquake}} resulted in a substantial mudflow. This mudflow flowed down {{the valley of the}} Lagunillas River for approximately , <b>spilling</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the river channel and killing much of the local population. After reaching an alluvial fan, the mudflow split into two branches. The larger portion of it joined the Lagunillas River and flowed into the nearby Magdalena River, while the smaller portion was diverted by hills in front of Lagunillas Canyon, turned 90degrees to the north until it reached the Sabandija River, and then flowed east with the Sabandija River, until it rejoined the other branch of the mudflow at the junction of the Sabandija and the Magdalena. It is estimated that 1000people were killed in the mudflows.|$|E

The creek wound on the plain {{for the rest of}} its course to its confluence with the Santa Ana River. coast live oaks (Quercus agrifolia), California sycamores (Platanus racemosa), white alders (Alnus rhombifolia), native willows (Salix species), and other riparian habitat vegetation lined the route of the creek and its primary tributaries. The creek and adjacent habitats supported a wide variety of birds, amphibians, fish, insects, and mammals.|$|E

25|$|The {{match between}} Liverpool and Nottingham Forest began as {{scheduled}} at 3:00pm. Fans were still streaming into pens 3 and 4 {{from the rear}} entrance tunnel as the match began. For some time, problems {{at the front of}} the Liverpool central goal pens went largely unnoticed except by those inside it, and by a few police at that end of the pitch. Liverpool's goalkeeper, Bruce Grobbelaar, reported fans from behind him pleading to him for help as the situation worsened. The police at first attempted to stop fans from <b>spilling</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the pens, some believing this to be a pitch invasion. At approximately 3:05pm in match action, Peter Beardsley kicked a shot which struck Nottingham Forest's goal bar. Possibly connected to the excitement, a surge in pen 3 caused one of its metal crush barriers to give way, thrusting people forward on top of one another, and into the pen's front fences.|$|E

Mozart had also {{recently}} died. Count Waldstein, in his farewell note to Beethoven, wrote: [...] "Through uninterrupted diligence you will receive Mozart's spirit through Haydn's hands." [...] Over the next few years, Beethoven responded to the widespread feeling that he was a successor to the recently deceased Mozart by studying that master's work and writing works with a distinctly Mozartean flavour.|$|E

2500|$|The {{most common}} types of optical {{cavities}} consist of two facing plane (flat) or spherical mirrors. The simplest {{of these is}} the plane-parallel or Fabry–Pérot cavity, consisting of two opposing flat mirrors. While simple, this arrangement is rarely used in large-scale lasers due to the difficulty of alignment; the mirrors must be aligned parallel within a few seconds of arc, or [...] "walkoff" [...] of the intracavity beam will result in it <b>spilling</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the sides of the cavity. However, this problem is much reduced for very short cavities with a small mirror separation distance (L < 1nbsp&cm). Plane-parallel resonators are therefore commonly used in microchip and microcavity lasers and semiconductor lasers. In these cases, rather than using separate mirrors, a reflective optical coating may be directly applied to the laser medium itself. The plane-parallel resonator is also the basis of the Fabry–Pérot interferometer.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{competitor}} to take off, at 5:10, was Andre Beaumont, followed [...] by Roland Garros and Eugène Gilbert. [...] Frey {{took off}} at 5:35, made a circuit {{of the field}} and landed: after some adjustments he tried again at 6:00, but damaged a wheel and had to delay his attempt for repairs. The next competitor was not ready, and the following, Garnier, only made a short flight. He was followed by Jules Védrines, who immediately after take off attempted to land since his aircraft was not handling properly. [...] The crowd had begun to get out of control at around six, <b>spilling</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the enclosures onto the flying field, and although no-one other than the aviators, their assistants and race officials were meant to enter the flying area, a party of government ministers had also left their grandstand. In an effort to avoid the spectators he crashed, escaping injury but severely damaging his aircraft. At 6:22 Le Lasseur de Ranssay departed and at 6:30 Andre Train was called to the starting line.|$|E

2500|$|On 1 December, Kiev's District Administrative Court banned further {{protests in}} {{downtown}} Kiev at both Maidan Nezalezhnosti and European Square, {{as well as}} in front of the Presidential Administration and Interior Ministry buildings, until 7 January 2014. Opposition forces planned the rally on the 1st to take place at St. Michael's Square, which is not among the banned rally locations, with a march towards Maidan Nezalezhnosti. During the 1 December rally, protesters followed through and defied the ban and marched form St. Michael's Square to re-take Maidan Nezalezhnosti. Protesters broke several windows in the city council building, followed by crowds <b>spilling</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Maidan Nezalezhnosti to the Presidential Administration building at Bankova Street and the Cabinet building (Hrushevskoho Street). People chanted [...] "Out with the thugs" [...] and sang the Ukrainian anthem. The opposition party Batkivshchyna claimed as much as 500,000 protesters turned out for the rallies, and opposition leader Petro Poroshenko claimed 350,000 were on Maidan Nezalezhnosti. Other news agencies reported over 100,000 in Maidan Nezalezhnosti alone, and the total number of protesters to be from 400,000 to 800,000. One poll had 70% of the surge in protesters attributable to the violence of 30 November.|$|E

This tilted plate fascinated her. Why did it not fall down? It was ridiculous. It was not in the nature of things for a mush-plate to up- end itself on the table, even if a man or so had been killed.|$|E
