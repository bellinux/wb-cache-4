5|$|The Rolls-Royce R was a British {{aero engine}} {{designed}} and built specifically for air racing purposes by Rolls-Royce Limited. Nineteen R engines were assembled in a limited production run between 1929 and 1931. Developed from the Rolls-Royce Buzzard, it was a 37-litre (2,240cu in) capacity, <b>supercharged</b> V-12 capable of producing just under 2,800horsepower (2,090kW), and weighed 1,640pounds (770kg). Intensive factory testing revealed mechanical failures which were remedied by redesigning the components, greatly improving reliability.|$|E
5|$|Titanium metal {{is used in}} {{automotive}} applications, {{particularly in}} automobile and motorcycle racing where low weight and high strength and rigidity are critical. The metal is generally too expensive for the general consumer market, though some late model Corvettes have been manufactured with titanium exhausts, and a Corvette Z06's LT4 <b>supercharged</b> engine uses lightweight, solid titanium intake valves for greater strength and resistance to heat.|$|E
5|$|On 20 January 1989, off Vieques Island, Iowas Turret One fired {{six of the}} {{experimental}} shells using the <b>supercharged</b> powder bags. Skelley claimed {{that one of the}} 16inch shells traveled , setting a record for the longest conventional 16inch (406.4mm) shell ever fired. Although the shells had been fired without serious incident, Meyer and Petty Officer First Class Dale Eugene Mortensen, gun chief for Turret One, told Skelley that they would no longer participate in his experiments. Skelley asked Turret Two's gun chief, Senior Chief Reggie Ziegler, if he could use Turret Two for his experiments; Ziegler refused. Skelley then asked Lieutenant Phil Buch, Turret Two's officer in charge, and Buch acquiesced.|$|E
5|$|In the Australasian and Middle Eastern markets, {{to further}} {{differentiate}} the Aurion from its Camry sibling, Toyota equipped the Aurion exclusively with a 3.5-litre V6 engine. With the Camry, the company only offered the 2.4-litre four-cylinder version. Previously in these markets, {{prior to the}} introduction of the Camry XV40, Toyota had offered both four- and a six-cylinder powerplants. Along with the naturally aspirated version, Toyota produced an Australia-only <b>supercharged</b> TRD Aurion between 2007 and 2009 as tuned by Toyota Racing Development (TRD). At its release, Toyota claimed this performance variant to be the world's most powerful front-wheel drive car. The powertrains used in the Asian specification Camry vary slightly from those of the Aurion. As well as the 3.5-litre V6, two four-cylinder engines are offered in either 2.0- or a 2.4-litre form. These engines are teamed with a six-, four- and five-speed automatic transmissions, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Kingsley Amis, in The James Bond Dossier, {{noted that}} {{although}} Bond {{is a very}} good shot and the best in the Secret Service, he is still beaten by the instructor, something that added realism to Bond's character. Amis identified a number of skills where Bond is very good, but is still beatable by others. These included skiing, hand-to-hand combat, underwater swimming and golf. Driving was also an ability Amis identified where Bond was good, but others were better; one of those who is a better driver than Bond is Sir Hugo Drax, who causes Bond to write off his battleship-grey <b>supercharged</b> Bentley 4½ Litre. Bond subsequently drives a Mark II Continental Bentley, which he uses in the remaining books of the series, although he is issued an Aston Martin DB Mark III with a homing device during the course of Goldfinger.|$|E
5|$|Later in 1923, he {{was hired}} by the Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft as a car {{salesman}} at their Dresden outlet. Caracciola continued racing, driving a Mercedes 6/25/40hp to victory in four of the eight races he entered in 1923. His success continued in 1924 with the new <b>supercharged</b> Mercedes 1.5-litre; he won 15races during the season, including the Klausenpass hillclimb in Switzerland. He attended the Italian Grand Prix at Monza as a reserve driver for Mercedes, but did not take part in the race. He drove his 1.5-litre to five victories in 1925, and won the hillclimbs at Kniebis and Freiburg in a Mercedes 24/100/140hp. With his racing career becoming increasingly successful, he abandoned his plans to study mechanical engineering.|$|E
5|$|Mercedes-Benz {{returned}} to Grand Prix racing {{at the start}} of the 1937 season with a new car. The W125 was a vast improvement on its predecessor, its <b>supercharged</b> eight cylinder 5.6-litre engine delivered significantly more power than the W25: 650 brake horsepower compared to 500. The first major race of 1937 was the Avusrennen where 300,000people turned out to see the cars race on the newly re-constructed track. In order to keep speeds consistently high, the north curve was turned into a steeply banked turn, apparently at the suggestion of Adolf Hitler. Driving a streamlined Mercedes-Benz, Caracciola won his heat against Rosemeyer, averaging around , although a transmission failure forced him to retire in the final. Following the AVUS race, Caracciola, along with Rosemeyer, Nuvolari and Mercedes' new driver, Richard Seaman, went to race in the revived Vanderbilt Cup in America, and in doing so missed the Belgian Grand Prix, which took place six days later. Caracciola led until lap22, when he retired with a broken supercharger.|$|E
5|$|Caracciola {{used the}} prize money—17,000Reichsmarks—to {{set up a}} Mercedes-Benz {{dealership}} on the prestigious Kurfürstendamm in Berlin. He also married his girlfriend, Charlotte, whom he had met in 1923 while working at the Mercedes-Benz outlet in Dresden. He continued racing in domestic competitions, returning again to Freiburg {{to compete in the}} Flying Kilometre race where he set a new sports car record in the new Mercedes-Benz 2-litre Model K, and finished first. Caracciola entered the Klausenpass hillclimb and set a new touring car record; he also won the touring car class at the Semmering hillclimb before driving a newly <b>supercharged</b> 1914 Mercedes Grand Prix car over the same route to set the fastest time of the day for any class. The recently completed Nürburgring was the host of the 1927 Eifelrennen, a race which had been held on public roads in the Eifel mountains since 1922. Caracciola won the first race on the track, and returned to the Nürburgring a month later for the 1927 German Grand Prix, but his car broke down and the race was won by Otto Merz. However, he won 11 competitions in 1927, almost all of them in the Ferdinand Porsche-developed Mercedes-Benz Model S.|$|E
25|$|Jaguar first {{introduced}} the <b>supercharged</b> XJR in X300 production; the first <b>supercharged</b> road car manufactured by the company.|$|E
25|$|In the beginning, {{the formula}} was {{largely based on}} pre-World War II {{regulations}} defined by engine capacity. The regulation expected to bring a new balance between <b>supercharged</b> and normally aspirated cars. Non-supercharged 4.5-litre pre-war Grand Prix cars were allowed to race against the pre-war 1.5-litre <b>supercharged</b> 'voiturettes', while pre-war <b>supercharged</b> 3-litre Grand Prix cars were banned. The first race under the new regulations was the 1946 Turin Grand Prix held on 1 September, the race being won by Achille Varzi in an Alfa Romeo 158 Alfetta.|$|E

25|$|The 2013 Ford Mustang Shelby GT350 {{is powered}} by a 5.0 liter V8 engine offered in both natural and <b>supercharged</b> versions. The {{naturally}} aspirated model delivers a total of 430 HP, but Shelby is also offering a new cold air package that will increase the car’s output to 450 HP. In the <b>supercharged</b> version, the GT350 is offered in either a Ford Racing <b>supercharged</b> 525 HP or a 624 HP version. The engine can be combined with a manual gearbox with a short throw shifter as standard, or an automatic transmission for the normally aspirated engine as an option.|$|E
25|$|The Kestrel was {{produced}} in 40 distinct variants which {{can be divided into}} three main groups: normally aspirated, medium <b>supercharged,</b> and fully <b>supercharged.</b> One variant, the Kestrel VIII, was configured as a 'pusher engine' for the Short Singapore flying boat. Apart from supercharging, the variant differences centred on varying compression ratios and propeller reduction gearing.|$|E
25|$|P-1A {{modified}} with a <b>supercharged</b> 510hp (380kW) Packard 1A-1530 engine.|$|E
25|$|The <b>supercharged</b> {{engine was}} not cleared for {{use at the}} time of the first flight on October 19 and the Ju 49 used instead the unsupercharged L88 version. Externally this {{installation}} was characterised by a tall, inline vertical stack of exhausts, unlike the single sloping pipe of the L88a. By summer 1932, the <b>supercharged</b> engine was flight-ready and installed, and the research program proper began.|$|E

25|$|The two Gurnard prototypes had {{different}} engines. The Gurnard II, {{the first to}} be completed, had a 525hp (392kW) Rolls-Royce Kestrel IIS <b>supercharged</b> water-cooled inline and the Gurnard I a 525hp Bristol Jupiter X <b>supercharged</b> radial engine. Accordingly, the Gurnard II had a smooth and pointed cowling, with a drum-shaped radiator between the undercarriage legs, whilst the radial engine had a narrow chord Townend ring, with the rear part of its cylinders visible from the side.|$|E
25|$|Chevrolet {{announced}} the C7 Z06 at the 2014 Detroit Auto Show. The 2015 Z06 Corvette has 650bhp from the <b>supercharged</b> LT4 aluminum 6.2L V-8 engine.|$|E

25|$|Other {{changes for}} 2007 include better brakes, revised suspension, and Land Rover's Terrain Response system. <b>Supercharged</b> Range Rovers have an {{electronic}} rear differential (optional on other models).|$|E
25|$|The Type 146 was {{designed}} to be powered by a <b>supercharged</b> Bristol Perseus sleeve valve radial engine, but this was not ready and the older, lower-horsepower Mercury IX was used instead.|$|E
25|$|The {{interiors}} {{had stayed}} relatively {{the same with}} exclusions ie. <b>Supercharged</b> trim black piano finish until 2006.5, (NAS 2007) where an updated interior was brought. Another major change was in 2010.|$|E
25|$|A {{project to}} build a modern replica of the 1939 Bugatti Model 100 air racer used twin Suzuki Hayabusa engines {{in place of the}} {{original}} design's pair of <b>supercharged</b> straight-eight engine.|$|E
25|$|Fw 190 D-0: The first D-0 {{prototype}} {{was completed}} in October 1942 with a <b>supercharged</b> Junkers Jumo 213 including a pressurized cockpit and other features making them more suitable for high-altitude work.|$|E
25|$|A {{variety of}} civil utility {{aircraft}} {{also used the}} R-760, including models built by Beechcraft, Cessna, Curtiss-Wright, Howard DGA-8, Stearman, Stinson, and Waco. These aircraft generally used the various <b>supercharged</b> versions of the R-760.|$|E
25|$|The Asso XI was {{a family}} of water-cooled, <b>supercharged</b> V12 piston aeroengines {{produced}} in the 1930s by Italian manufacturer Isotta Fraschini, and fitted {{on a number of}} aircraft types built by CANT, Caproni and others.|$|E
25|$|Pierre Clerget {{designed}} {{a range of}} Clément-Bayard aircraft engines including a 7-cylinder <b>supercharged</b> radial, the 4-cyl 40hp used on the Demoiselle, a 4-cyl 100hp used on 'Hanriot Etrich' monoplanes, and a V8 200hp airship engine.|$|E
25|$|The 1929 Trophy {{race was}} {{to be held at}} Cowes. With little money {{forthcoming}} from the Ministry aircraft and engine development had to be private ventures, with government money only being used to purchase the completed product. The costs of the 1927 and 1929 meetings was stated to be £196,000 and £220,000 respectively. Rolls-Royce had now developed the <b>supercharged</b> R engine, giving Supermarine's designer R.J. Mitchell far more power for his new S.6 than the naturally aspirated Napier Lion VIIB of the S.5. Gloster's first racing monoplane, the Gloster VI, had stayed with the Lion, but was also now <b>supercharged</b> as the Lion VIID.|$|E
25|$|The Tungsten Silver Ford Mustang GT coupe concept {{included}} a glass roof and functional hood scoops, {{as well as}} a red and charcoal leather interior accented by billet-aluminum hardware and a <b>supercharged</b> MOD 4.6L engine rated nearly 400 horsepower.|$|E
