The <b>signal</b> <b>device</b> must rise above the mailbox and be visible at a distance, and must not obscure the mailbox owner's name or impede vehicular or pedestrian traffic. Canada Post requires all rural mailboxes to have a minimum interior dimensions of 45cm in length by 17.5cm in width by 17.5cm in height for a rectangular mailbox, and 45cm in length by 25cm in diameter {{in the case of a}} cylindrical mailbox.|$|E

50|$|In 1899 Gray {{moved to}} Boston where he {{continued}} inventing. One of his projects {{was to develop}} an underwater <b>signaling</b> <b>device</b> to transmit messages to ships.

5000|$|The {{dead body}} of a U.N.I.T. soldier is found on the moor, and the Doctor and the Brigadier go to investigate, leaving Sarah at the inn. A Zygon {{disguised}} as Harry arrives at the inn and takes the <b>signal</b> <b>device,</b> but Sarah is suspicious of Harry's behaviour and pursues him with a troop of soldiers. She follows him into a barn, where he is hiding on the upper level. He attacks Sarah with a pitchfork, but falls from the ledge and dies, reverting to his original form. Before he can be taken away, though, Broton [...] "disperses" [...] the corpse. When the Doctor and the Brigadier return, Sarah wonders how the aliens knew they had the <b>signal</b> <b>device.</b> U.N.I.T. search the inn, and Broton sends the Skarasen to attack the village. As the <b>signal</b> <b>device</b> starts to beep, the Doctor takes it to lure the monster away while the Brigadier tries to trace the activating signal. As he runs onto the moor, the semi-organic device attaches itself to the Doctor's hand, so as the Skarasen approaches him {{he is unable to}} remove the device.|$|E
50|$|When U.N.I.T. {{arrive at}} the quarry, the Doctor and the captives escape from the ship before it explodes. They trace Broton's target to London, close to the Thames, and the Brigadier and the Duke explain that the Prime Minister is {{attending}} the first international energy conference at Stanbridge House, which is near the river. Because the Duke {{is the president of}} the Scottish Energy Commission, the disguised Broton will have a pass into the meeting. When U.N.I.T. and the Doctor reach Stanbridge House, Broton has placed the <b>signal</b> <b>device</b> in the basement to lure the Skarasen. The Doctor confronts him, they fight, and the Brigadier shoots Broton dead. The Skarasen emerges from the Thames, and the Doctor throws the <b>signal</b> <b>device</b> into its open mouth. Satisfied, the monster swims away, heading back to Loch Ness.|$|E

50|$|Potts held no patents on the device, but is {{generally}} regarded as its inventor. In 1924 the traffic <b>signal</b> <b>device</b> was being made commercially, and in 1928 a legal dispute arose between manufacturers.

5000|$|In 1953, Norton-Honer {{introduced}} the Sonic Ray Gun, which {{was essentially a}} 7½-inch flashlight mounted on a pistol grip. Pressing the trigger activated not only the flashlight beam (which had interchangeable colored lenses for differently colored [...] "rays") but also an electronic buzzer. It could therefore {{be used as a}} pretend raygun but also as an actual Morse Code <b>signal</b> <b>device.</b>|$|E

50|$|In January 1976, {{a patent}} was issued for the Chemiluminescent <b>Signal</b> <b>Device,</b> with Vincent J. Esposito, Steven M. Little, and John H. Lyons {{listed as the}} inventors (Patent 3,933,118). This patent {{recommended}} a single glass ampoule that is suspended in a second substance, that when broken and mixed together, provide the chemiluminescent light. The design also included a stand for the <b>signal</b> <b>device</b> {{so it could be}} thrown from a moving vehicle and remain standing in an upright position on the road. The idea was this would replace traditional emergency roadside flares and would be superior, since it was not a fire hazard, would be easier and safer to deploy, and would not be made ineffective if struck by passing vehicles. This design, with its single glass ampoule inside a plastic tube filled with a second substance that when bent breaks the glass and then is shaken to mix the substances, most closely resembles the typical glow stick sold today.|$|E
50|$|As a Legion of Super-Heroes member, Bouncing Boy {{possesses}} a Legion Flight Ring.
