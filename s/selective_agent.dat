5|$|Predators of the {{tawny owl}} include large birds such as Ural owls, eagle owls, {{northern}} goshawks, golden eagles, and common buzzards. Pine martens may raid nests, especially where artificial nest boxes make the owls easy to find, and several instances {{have been recorded}} of Eurasian jackdaws building nests {{on top of a}} brooding female tawny owl leading to the death of the adult and chicks. A Danish study showed that predation by mammals, especially red foxes, was an important cause of mortality in newly fledged young, with 36% dying between fledging and independence. The mortality risk increased with fledging date from 14% in April to more than 58% in June, and increasing predation of late broods may be an important <b>selective</b> <b>agent</b> for early breeding in this species.|$|E
5|$|However, {{contrary}} to {{the expectations of the}} Red Queen hypothesis, Hanley et al. found that the prevalence, abundance and mean intensity of mites was significantly higher in sexual geckos than in asexuals sharing the same habitat. Furthermore, Parker, after reviewing numerous genetic studies on plant disease resistance, failed to find a single example consistent with the concept that pathogens are the primary <b>selective</b> <b>agent</b> responsible for sexual reproduction in their host. At an even more fundamental level, Heng and Gorelick and Heng reviewed evidence that sex, rather than enhancing diversity, acts as a constraint on genetic diversity. They considered that sex acts as a coarse filter, weeding out major genetic changes, such as chromosomal rearrangements, but permitting minor variation, such as changes at the nucleotide or gene level (that are often neutral) to pass through the sexual sieve. The adaptive function of sex, today, remains a major unresolved issue in biology. The competing models to explain the adaptive function of sex were reviewed by Birdsell and Wills. A principal alternative view to the Red Queen hypothesis is that sex arose, and is maintained, as a process for repairing DNA damage, and that genetic variation is produced as a byproduct.|$|E

2500|$|Lenski {{chose to}} carry out the {{experiment}} with the bacteria grown in a glucose-limited minimal medium called DM25, which was initially developed by Bernard Davis for use in isolating auxotrophic mutants of E. coli using penicillin as a <b>selective</b> <b>agent.</b> DM25 is supplemented with a low concentration of glucose. Lenski chose this concentration to simplify analysis of the populations' evolution by reducing clonal interference, in which multiple versions of alleles are competing in an evolving population, while also reducing the possibility of the evolution of ecological interactions. [...] This concentration of glucose used supports a maximum population of 500 million cells of the ancestor in a 10 mL culture, though the maximum now varies among the evolved populations.

60|$|Now, what is thus true within narrow limits, {{and in a}} short {{space of}} time about the {{deliberate}} action of man, Darwin showed to be also true within wider limits and spread over longer geological epochs about the unconscious action of nature. And herein consisted his great advance upon the earlier evolutionism of Lamarck, Goethe, and Erasmus Darwin. For while these instinctive pioneers of the evolutionary spirit saw clearly that animals and plants betrayed signs of common descent from {{one or a few}} original ancestors, they did not see what was the mechanism by which such organisms had been differentiated into so many distinct genera and species. They caught, indeed, at the analogy of variation under domestication and in the wild state, but they missed the subtler and deeper analogy between human and natural selection. Now, variation alone would give us a world consisting not of definite kinds fairly well demarcated one from the other, but of innumerable unclassified and unorganisable individuals, all shading off indefinitely one into the other, and incapable of being reduced by human ingenuity to any orderly hierarchical system. Furthermore, it would give us creatures without special adaptation of any kind to the peculiar circumstances of their own environment. To account for adaptation, for the almost perfect fitness of every plant and every animal to its position in life, for the existence (in other words) of definitely correlated parts and organs, we must call in the aid of survival of the fittest. Without that potent <b>selective</b> <b>agent,</b> our conception of the becoming of life is a mere chaos; order and organisation are utterly inexplicable save by the brilliant illuminating ray of the Darwinian principle. That is why Darwin destroyed at one blow the specious arguments of the early teleologists; he showed that where Chambers and even Erasmus Darwin had seen the working of a final cause, we ought rather to recognise the working of an efficient cause, whose outcome necessarily but fallaciously simulates the supposed features of an a priori finality.|$|E

40|$|International audienceDespite the {{increasing}} number of genomic tools, identifying the genetics underlying adaptive complex traits remains challenging in the model species Arabidopsis thaliana. This is due, at least in part, to the lack of data on the geographical scale of adaptive phenotypic variation. The aims of this study were (i) to tease apart the historical roles of adaptive and nonselective processes in shaping phenological variation in A. thaliana in France and (ii) to gain insights into the spatial scale of adaptive variation by identifying the putative <b>selective</b> <b>agents</b> responsible for this selection. Forty-nine natu- ral stands from four climatically contrasted French regions were characterized (i) phe- nologically for six traits, (ii) genetically using 135 SNP markers and (iii) ecologically for 42 variables. Up to 63 % of phenological variation could be explained by neutral genetic diversity. The remaining phenological variation displayed stronger associations with ecological variation within regions than among regions, suggesting the impor- tance of local <b>selective</b> <b>agents</b> in shaping adaptive phenological variation. Although climatic conditions have often been suggested as the main <b>selective</b> <b>agents</b> acting on phenology in A. thaliana, both edaphic conditions and interspecific competition appear to be strong <b>selective</b> <b>agents</b> in some regions. In a first attempt to identify the genetics of phenological variation at different geographical scales, we phenotyped worldwide accessions and local polymorphic populations from the French RegMap in a genome- wide association (GWA) mapping study. The genomic regions associated with pheno- logical variation depended upon the geographical scale considered, stressing the need to account for the scale of adaptive phenotypic variation when choosing accession pan- els for GWAS...|$|R

40|$|On {{a common}} view of evolution, natural {{selection}} {{is the major}} force that produces evolutionary change. Selection is thought to operate on different types (genotypes or phenotypes) in populations so as to generate differential reproductive survival of these types. This should engender changes in population composition. The conception of selection as a 'force' {{should be considered as}} a convenient shorthand that easily misleads us. Selection is not a factor over and above items such as temperature regimes, predators, and so forth. These items do causal work in evolutionary processes. The term 'selection' is merely an placeholder for them. Differential reproductive survival thus appears to depend on particular environmental items that influence different types in different ways. Such items are properly regarded as the <b>selective</b> <b>agents.</b> On the face of it, selection processes must always be due to the operation of such agents. I argue that this is a mistaken assumption. Processes of selection may well occur in the absence of <b>selective</b> <b>agents.</b> That is because environmental factors may contribute to differential reproductive survival even if they do not affect different genotypes or phenotypes in different ways.

The second objective involved the use of Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy and chemometric analysis for the differentiation of: Listeria monocytogenes epidemic clones (ECs); viable versus heat-killed populations; different mixed strains and mixed species of Listeria; and different injury treatments and repair in Listeria populations. Nitrite- or acid-injured Listeria at approximately 10 CFU/ml were recovered in mLRB medium, and cell populations enumerated at various times (12 to 48 h) of incubation at 37 oC.
