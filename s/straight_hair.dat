5|$|Humans, horses, and orangutans {{are among}} the few species that may grow their head hair very long. Humans are {{believed}} to have lost their fur 2.5–3 million years ago as hominids when transitioning from a forest habitat to the open savanna, as an effect of natural selection, since this development made it possible to run fast and hunt animals close to the equator without getting overheated. An exception was however head hair, which was kept to provide thermal insulation of the scalp from the sun, to protect against ultra-violet radiation exposure, and also to provide cooling (when sweat evaporates from soaked hair). The ability to grow <b>straight</b> <b>hair,</b> has been observed among Homo sapiens sub-groups in less sunny regions further away from the equator. Relative to kinky Afro-textured hair, <b>straight</b> <b>hair</b> allows more UV light to pass to the scalp (which is essential for the production of vitamin D, that is important for bone development).|$|E
25|$|The white race, with oval face, <b>straight</b> <b>hair</b> and nose, {{to which}} the civilised people of Europe belong and which appear to us the most {{beautiful}} of all, is also superior to others by its genius, courage, and activity.|$|E
25|$|Because of the then-prevalent {{notion that}} <b>straight</b> <b>hair</b> was more {{acceptable}} than kinky hair, many black people began exploring solutions for straightening, or relaxing, their tresses. One post-slavery solution was {{a mixture of}} lye, egg and potato, which burned the scalp upon contact.|$|E

50|$|Cowlicks {{are more}} obvious in <b>straight,</b> thick <b>hair.</b> In people with <b>straight,</b> coarse <b>hair</b> the scalp will {{show in the}} center of the whorl because the light penetrates to the scalp. Both men and women have cowlicks, which can be covered by longer hair so the whorl is not visible.|$|R
25|$|For African hair types, salon dreadlocks can {{be formed}} by evenly {{sectioning}} and styling the loose hair into braids, coils, twists, or using a procedure called dread perming specifically used for <b>straight</b> <b>hair.</b> For European, Indigenous American, Asian, and Indian hair types, Backcombing and Twist and Rip {{are some of}} the more popular methods of achieving starter dreadlocks.|$|E
25|$|In {{people with}} {{naturally}} curly or <b>straight</b> <b>hair,</b> the hairstyle is instead typically created {{with the help}} of creams, gels or other solidifying liquids to hold the hair in place. Particularly popular in the African-American community of the late 1960s, the hairstyle is often shaped and maintained with the assistance of a wide-toothed comb colloquially known as an Afro pick.|$|E
25|$|From the mid 80s {{until the}} early 90s, mullets were popular in {{suburban}} and rural areas among working-class men. This contrasted with a conservative look preferred by business professionals, with neatly groomed short hair for men and sleek, <b>straight</b> <b>hair</b> for women. Some men also wore bangs in styles such as regular frontal or side swept bangs {{but they were not}} as big as women or girls bangs. Hairsprays such as AquaNet were also used in excess by fans of glam metal bands such as Poison.|$|E
50|$|The Hygen Hound stands {{approximately}} 19 to 24 in {{high and}} weighs around 44 to 55 lbs kg. They have a thick, shiny coat with <b>straight</b> <b>hairs.</b> They {{can be found}} in yellow and red, chestnut (with or without black shading) and black with bright chestnut colors, sometimes combined with white markings.|$|R
50|$|When eating Douglas-fir needles, they {{carefully}} remove the fine resin ducts (which resemble coarse, <b>straight</b> <b>hairs)</b> along each {{edge of the}} needle, discarding these or using them for nest lining.

5000|$|... ==Description== It is a loosely tufted plant {{growing from}} a stout stem base, {{reaching}} to 10-25 cm tall. The basal leaves are 3- (rarely 5-) foliate, hairy above, and densely tomentose beneath, the petioles and stems with long, <b>straight</b> <b>hairs.</b> The inflorescence is branched, bearing several fairly large flowers. The flowers have five petals, pale yellow, inversely heart-shaped, longer than sepals.|$|R
25|$|African-Americans began {{sponsoring}} {{their own}} beauty events. The winners, {{many of whom}} wore <b>straight</b> <b>hair</b> styles and {{some of whom were}} of mixed race, adorned Black magazines and product advertisements. In the early 20th century, media portrayal of traditional African hair styles, such as braids and cornrows, was associated with African-Americans who were poor and lived in rural areas. In {{the early decades of the}} Great Migration, when millions of African Americans left the South for opportunities in northern and midwestern industrial cities, many African Americans wanted to leave this rural association behind.|$|E
25|$|One popular {{version of}} these systems classifies afro-textured hair as 'type 4' (<b>straight</b> <b>hair</b> is type 1, wavy type 2, and curly is type 3, with the letters A, B, and C used to {{indicate}} the degree of coil variation within each type), with the subcategory of type 4C being most exemplary of this hair type (Walker, 1997). However, afro-textured hair {{is often difficult to}} categorize because of the many different variations among individuals. Those variations include pattern (mainly tight coils), pattern size (watch spring to chalk), density (sparse to dense), strand diameter (fine, medium, coarse), and feel (cottony, wooly, spongy).|$|E
25|$|An {{individual}} hair's {{shape is}} never completely circular. The cross-section of a hair is an ellipse, which can tend towards a circle or be distinctly flattened. Asiatic heads of <b>straight</b> <b>hair</b> are formed from almost-round hairs, and Caucasian hair's cross sections form oval shapes. Afro-textured hair has a flattened cross-section and is finer, and its ringlets can form tight circles with diameters {{of only a}} few millimeters. In humans worldwide, Asiatic hair is the most common, whereas afro-textured hair is the least common. This is because the former hair texture is typical of the large populations inhabiting East Asia as well as the indigenous peoples of the Americas.|$|E
50|$|Endiandra muelleri subsp. muelleri is a tree {{reaching}} 30 metres {{tall with}} a trunk diameter of 75 cm. The {{base of the}} tree may be buttressed and flanged. The brown bark is irregular, with craters, depressions, and loose plates of bark. Leaf bearing twigs are green coloured with fine flat <b>straight</b> <b>hairs.</b> New shoots feature bright pink or red leaves and fawn coloured hairs.|$|R

The mantle is with black spots.|$|R
50|$|Erigeron klamathensis is {{native to}} the Klamath Ranges of southwestern Oregon and northwestern California. It is a {{perennial}} herb up to 20 cm (8 inches) tall, producing a woody taproot. The stem is covered with stiff, <b>straight</b> <b>hairs,</b> unlike some related species. Leaves are most on the stem rather than crowded close to the ground. Each stem can produce 1-5 flower heads, each {{with as many as}} 30 purple or lavender ray florets surrounding numerous yellow disc florets.|$|R
25|$|The Hadendoa Beja of Northeast Africa {{were called}} Fuzzy-Wuzzies by British colonial troops during the Mahdist War {{of the late}} 19th century due to their often large and mop-like hairstyles, which they shaped by {{applying}} butter or mutton fat. In Somalia, some young men of the nomadic and sedentary communities would grow their hair long and carefully comb it into rather large bushes, which they would then hold in place with ghee. This elaborate hairstyle was quite distinct from another coiffure found among other Somalis, who would instead grow long and fluff out their fine, <b>straight</b> <b>hair</b> and place a chewing stick and comb in the center.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} put a {{priority}} on their schoolwork, ClariS have not released photos of themselves {{to the public and}} employ illustrators to draw their likenesses. When drawn, Clara is depicted wearing pastel pink items, and Alice is shown wearing blue items. Images of the crescent moon are used as a motif to represent Clara, and the sun is used to represent Alice, which comes from their personal preferences. Clara is shown with slightly wavy hair and no bangs, while Alice is drawn with <b>straight</b> <b>hair</b> with bangs. To further preserve their anonymity, Clara and Alice have not told anyone they know (aside from their families) that they debuted as music artists. Both admit that they are otaku, and have taken an interest in anime and anime music. Clara says that she keeps her otaku interests a secret from others at school, and Alice has called herself a Disney otaku.|$|E
25|$|Lauren Cassidy, {{played by}} Karle Warren: She is Amy's daughter, {{six years old}} {{at the start of the}} series. A mostly well-adjusted girl, she is going through the pains of {{childhood}} and preadolescence with divorced parents, but a loving family. She struggles over her father's relationship with Leesha, whom she likes at first. When Lauren is 12, her uncle Peter takes her for her haircut and she returns home with her long <b>straight</b> <b>hair</b> cut into a hipper, shoulder-length cut. Her boyfriend Victor turns out to be the son of her mother's boyfriend, David McClaren, which causes Lauren to feel awkward and disgusted. When Amy becomes pregnant with David's child, Lauren reveals what a total blow to her social life this will be and is furious. She later becomes accepting and supporting of her mother after she miscarries. Toward the end of the series, Lauren begins to hang out with a group of friends who embrace the straight edge culture, which puts her at odds with her mother.|$|E

50|$|The leaf blades are undivided, usually bearing {{branched}} {{veins and}} more than one row of sori {{on either side of the}} costa. They always have unbranched hairs, while many species have branched hairs with a single gland at the apex. Some species have hydathodes, some of which are cretaceous (leaving a lime deposit on the leaf around them). The sporangia bear one to two (occasionally as many as six) stiff, simple <b>straight</b> <b>hairs</b> without glands at the tip of the sporangium.|$|R
500|$|Social {{pressures}} at {{the time}} were heavily influencing these Americans (women) to have, <b>straight</b> <b>hair,</b> like white people did. This resulted in the Black is beautiful movement, wherein African Americans wore their long natural hair, that was however, untreated and unmodified. More recently, hair-extensions have become widespread. Scholars have pointed out the continued pressure on black women to have straight smooth hair. Amelia Jones points out that dolls for children, such as Barbies, add to this pressure, citing as an example a new, black Barbie with <b>straight</b> <b>hair.</b> Blacks, she believes, should be able to be themselves without feeling pressured to [...] "tame" [...] their hair.|$|E
500|$|He also {{developed}} her hair styles for the series, which Roddenberry insisted must be unique and futuristic {{so that the}} viewers could believe they were seeing the future on television. She originally appeared with <b>straight</b> <b>hair</b> in promotion photos, but this was changed to a beehive, which was so solid looking that Bob Justman joked that [...] "You could hit it with a sledgehammer and never make a dent." [...] It was created by weaving two Max Factor wigs into a mesh cone. Whitney described {{the application of the}} wig, saying [...] "they nailed it to my head every morning." [...] It was created by placing a cone on her head and then weaving the blonde hair from two separate wigs together resulting in such an unusual look that Whitney said she was unrecognizable without it. In the press, she explained that on the show, Rand would have stuck her head in a machine which would have made up her hair instantly. The wig was later stolen from the Desilu lot after Whitney was no longer on the series; it was never recovered.|$|E
500|$|All of Bundy's known {{victims were}} white females, most of middle-class backgrounds. Almost all {{were between the}} ages of 15 and 25 and most were college students. He {{apparently}} never approached anyone he might have met before. (In their last conversation before his execution, Bundy told Kloepfer he had purposely stayed away from her [...] "when he felt the power of his sickness building in him.") Rule noted that most of the identified victims had long <b>straight</b> <b>hair,</b> parted in the middle—like Stephanie Brooks, the woman who rejected him, and to whom he later became engaged and then rejected in return. Rule speculated that Bundy's animosity toward his first girlfriend triggered his protracted rampage and caused him to target victims who resembled her. Bundy dismissed this hypothesis: [...] "hey ... just fit the general criteria of being young and attractive", he told Hugh Aynesworth. [...] "Too many people have bought this crap that all the girls were similar ... almost everything was dissimilar ... physically, they were almost all different." [...] He did concede that youth and beauty were [...] "absolutely indispensable criteria" [...] in his choice of victims.|$|E

500|$|Quinn {{is portrayed}} by actress Dianna Agron. In casting Glee, series creator Ryan Murphy sought out actors who could {{identify}} with the rush of starring in theatrical roles. Instead of using traditional network casting calls, he spent three months on Broadway looking for unknown actors. Agron was the last primary actor to be cast, having won the role only days before the pilot began filming. Agron auditioned for Glee coming from a background in dancing and acting. She has been taking dance classes {{since the age of}} three, appeared in many music theatre productions and has appeared in television roles for Skidmarks, , and Heroes. Agron said in a 2009 interview pertaining to her casting session: [...] "I nearly bailed on my audition for the show. I was so nervous". With her wholesome good looks, Agron certainly looked the part, but the producers wondered if she appeared too innocent. Agron said in an interview: [...] "They told me to come back with <b>straight</b> <b>hair</b> and to dress sexier. Later that week, I started work." [...] Agron auditioned with Frank Sinatra's [...] "Fly Me to the Moon". The Glee producers said [...] "we really lucked out in finding Agron to play Quinn".|$|E
500|$|The episode {{begins with}} Walter smoking his own strain of {{marijuana}} {{while listening to}} [...] "Roundabout" [...] by the band Yes. The scene was originally removed out of concern it would be airing on network television, but was later reinserted because [...] "the story itself had so many different genres playing. We had a noir element. We had a musical element. and it just really played funnier coming from an altered state of Walter", according to co-producer Tanya Swerling. Jeff Pinkner added [...] "We {{set out to do}} an episode that explored Walter's state of mind — he's dealing with some very upsetting news. When we realized that the way Walter would deal with such news would be to try to anesthetize himself with copious amounts of marijuana, well, singing and dancing became a natural outcome." [...] Music supervisor Charles Scott IV and J.R. Wyman are big Yes fans, and consequently chose the song that appeared in the opening scene. As the episode was done with a 1940s aesthetic, every department had to act accordingly. Torv's normally <b>straight</b> <b>hair</b> was placed into a curl hairdo fashionable for the time period, and lighting changes were made to reflect the period as well. New furniture was brought in for various sets, such as Walter's lab and Nina's office at Massive Dynamic, which was then removed in preparation for the following week. The ending was a challenge for the producers, as it was supposed to end with Ella's version of the story conclusion and Walter still feeling upset over Peter's absence, but they felt this ended making viewers feel depressed. They debated ways to make it a happier tone, so Wyman added the Observer scene to change the feeling of the episode, and prepare viewers for next week.|$|E
