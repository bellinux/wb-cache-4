5|$|In 1776 Bewick {{became a}} partner in Beilby's workshop. The joint {{business}} prospered, becoming Newcastle's leading engraving service with an enviable reputation for high quality work and good service. In September 1776 he went to London for eight months, finding the city rude, deceitful and cruel, and much disliking the unfairness of extreme wealth and poverty side by side. He returned to his beloved Newcastle as <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>could,</b> but {{his time in the}} capital gave him a wider reputation, business experience, and an awareness of new movements in art.|$|E
5|$|In November 2004, {{at the age}} of 26, Soyer severed his {{spinal cord}} during an {{accident}} while riding his motorbike on his parents' farm. He was keen to exercise as <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> during his rehabilitation. He tried several sports, including wheelchair tennis, wheelchair rugby and wheelchair basketball, following his accident in an attempt to find one that made him feel able-bodied. He drove dune buggies and tried kayaking, and in 2007 was learning how to para-glide.|$|E
5|$|The {{first of}} three sons born in Adelaide,Unley to Martin and Jeanne (née Richardson), Chappell was steeped in the game from an early age. His father was a noted Adelaide grade cricketer who put a bat in his hands as <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> walk, and his {{maternal}} grandfather was famous all-round sportsman Vic Richardson, who captained Australia {{at the end of}} a nineteen-Test career. Chappell was given weekly batting lessons from the age of five, as were younger brothers Greg and Trevor, who both also went on to play for Australia.|$|E
60|$|Barrington {{only looked}} at him, but the farmer {{felt as though}} {{somebody}} had struck him in the face, and, <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> conveniently <b>could,</b> bade Miss Barrington good-night.|$|R
6000|$|As <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> decently <b>could,</b> <b>he</b> {{followed}} her to her studio, where he found her lying in sullen dejection on the big divan. [...] "Bee Bee, you are missing a good dinner," [...] he began, gently.|$|R
6000|$|... "Is {{your mother}} well?" [...] he asked {{of the little}} girl. It {{seemed to him that}} he had better not speak to Imogene, who still kept that little {{distance}} from the rest, and get away <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> decently <b>could.</b>|$|R
5|$|As <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> walk, Braille {{spent time}} {{playing in his}} father's workshop. At the age of three, the child was playing {{with some of the}} tools, trying to make holes in a piece of leather with an awl. Squinting closely at the surface, he pressed down hard to drive the point in, and the awl glanced across the tough leather and struck him in one of his eyes. A local {{physician}} bound and patched the affected eye and even arranged for Braille to be met the next day in Paris by a surgeon, but no treatment could save the damaged organ. In agony, the young boy suffered for weeks as the wound became severely infected; an infection which then spread to his other eye, likely due to sympathetic ophthalmia.|$|E
5|$|At {{that first}} meeting on 28 January 1981, which lasted over seven hours, Heidemann offered Kujau a deposit of only 100,000DMs to agree the deal, which Kujau did not accept. At a second meeting the {{following}} day, the reporter revealed an additional lure {{he had brought}} with him: a uniform which he said was Göring's. Kujau tentatively agreed to provide the diaries and told Heidemann that he would call him as <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> arrange to receive them from East Germany. As a sign of good faith Heidemann lent the uniform to the forger, to show alongside his collection of other uniforms from the top Nazis; for his part, Kujau gave the journalist a painting purportedly by Hitler. Both the painting and uniform were fakes.|$|E
5|$|Reedman carried {{instructions}} from Salisbury to {{spend up to}} £3million on European weapons, aircraft and equipment as <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>could.</b> The Rhodesian government now believed that it would almost certainly declare independence unilaterally and, knowing the purchase of materiel would be more difficult following this, wished to have the Rhodesian Security Forces' necessary ammunition, weapons, spare parts and other equipment in place beforehand. Soon after arriving in Portugal, Reedman contacted the Lisbon-based Zoio brothers, José, Luiz and Jean, who had recently supplied the Portuguese Armed Forces in Angola with British-made weapons in direct contravention of NATO's embargo against arming Portugal's African-based troops. The Zoios were interested in stocking Rhodesia's arsenal, and promptly agreed to arrange an order of weapons from a third party on Reedman's behalf {{in exchange for a}} letter of credit from the Rhodesian government.|$|E
60|$|She greeted Jack very graciously, {{but with}} a certain polite condescension of which she is past mistress. I am sure Jack felt it, for, <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> decently <b>could,</b> <b>he</b> got up to go. Alicia asked him to remain to dinner.|$|R
50|$|By April 19, 2000 {{the larger}} ad hoc {{committee}} said it was {{putting the finishing touches}} on the Code of Conduct and were getting ready to send it to Byyny to review. WAAKE-UP! pressured Byyny to sign it <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> possibly <b>could.</b>|$|R
60|$|Lady O'Moy and Miss Armytage drove alone {{together}} into Lisbon. The adjutant, still occupied, would follow <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> possibly <b>could,</b> whilst Captain Tremayne {{would go on}} directly from the lodgings which he shared in Alcantara with Major Carruthers--also of the adjutant's staff--whither he had ridden to dress some twenty minutes earlier.|$|R
5|$|Opeth was {{scheduled}} to perform in Jordan without a crew due to the fear of terrorist attacks in the Middle East. Opeth's tour manager distributed 6,000 tickets for the concert, but before the band left for Jordan, drummer Lopez called Åkerfeldt stating he was having an anxiety attack and could not perform, forcing the band to cancel the show. In early 2004, Lopez was sent home from Canada after more anxiety attacks on tour. Opeth decided against cancelling {{the remainder of the}} tour, with Lopez's drum technician filling in for two concerts. Lopez promised that he would return to the tour as <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>could,</b> but two shows later Opeth asked Strapping Young Lad drummer Gene Hoglan to fill in. Lopez returned to Opeth for the Seattle show on the final leg of the Deliverance and Damnation tour. Per Wiberg also joined the band on tour to perform keyboards, {{after more than a year}} on tour.|$|E
5|$|It was {{not until}} 12 January that Dukovac added to his tally, a Yakovlev Yak-1. On 25 February, Dukovac flew five sorties. On the first he and his wingman downed a Yak-1 each, and on the second he shot down a Yak and a P-39. During his fifth mission, he was shot down by P-39s and crash-landed, {{injuring}} his spine. He was evacuated to a field hospital, but returned to 15./JG 52 as <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> walk, ten days later, {{only to find that}} he had just three pilots fit for duty. Despite the pending arrival of newly trained pilots, the loss of another two pilots by mid-March led the Luftwaffe to decide that attempting to maintain 15./JG 52 was futile, and the men were sent home to the NDH. During its three tours, the Staffel had accounted for a total of 297 Soviet aircraft, of which Dukovac had 37 confirmed and eight unconfirmed aerial victories, seven of which were later confirmed. At the beginning of July, the Luftwaffe reconsidered its decision, and the newly promoted Hauptmann Dukovac and a group of veteran and fresh pilots began to make their way back to the Eastern Front. They were transported to Romania and then the Slovak Republic, but no aircraft were provided, and on 21 July the pilots were advised that the HZL was to be disbanded. Despite this, in August they were moved to an airfield in East Prussia, where they took delivery of ten Bf 109G-14s. At the beginning of September they flew to Lithuania in preparation to rejoin the fray.|$|E
25|$|At Canton, Douglas {{convinced}} Charles Elliot, {{the chief}} superintendent at Canton, to charter Cambridge as {{a de facto}} warship to protect British shipping in the Pearl River delta. As <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>could,</b> Elliot ended the hire of Cambridge.|$|E
6000|$|As <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> decently <b>could</b> Harold went to {{his room}} and opened the {{important}} letter. In it the reticent-girl had uttered herself with unusual freedom. It was a long letter, and its writer must have gone to its composition at once after the door had closed upon her visitors. It began abruptly, too: ...|$|R
60|$|Mrs Jarley was not proof {{against the}} poet's insinuating manner, and Mr Slum entered {{the order in}} a small note-book as a three-and-sixpenny one. Mr Slum then withdrew to alter the acrostic, after taking a most affectionate leave of his patroness, and {{promising}} to return, <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> possibly <b>could,</b> with a fair copy for the printer.|$|R
25|$|Finally, in 1884 THH {{sank into}} another depression, {{and this time}} it precipitated his {{decision}} to retire in 1885, at the age of only 60. He resigned the Presidency of the Royal Society in mid-term, the Inspectorship of Fisheries, and his chair <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> decently <b>could,</b> and took six months' leave. His pension was a fairly handsome £1500 a year.|$|R
25|$|Michael Colin Cowdrey {{was born}} on his father's tea {{plantation}} at Ootacamund, Madras Presidency, although his birthplace was usually misrecorded as Bangalore 100 miles to the north. His father made an application for him to join the prestigious Marylebone Cricket Club while still an infant. Cowdrey had no schooling in India, but his father and servants taught him cricket as <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> walk.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{his good}} work and {{popularity}} {{with the people}} he ruled, Güemes Padilla lasted only five years in office. Although King Charles IV was the nominal ruler of Spain, his queen, Maria Louisa of Parma, and her lover, Manuel de Godoy, held most of the power. Godoy was not in agreement with Güemes Padilla's reforms and lack of territorial ambitions in the Pacific Northwest. Godoy replaced him as <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>could.</b>|$|E
25|$|Prior to the battle, Shapur I had {{penetrated}} {{several times}} deeply into Roman territory, conquering and plundering Antioch in Syria in 253 or 256. After defeating the usurper Aemilianus and assuming the purple for himself, Valerian {{arrived in the}} eastern provinces as <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> (254 or 255) and gradually restored order. Soon he had to confront a naval Gothic invasion in northern Asia Minor. The Goths ravaged Pontus and moved south into Cappadocia. An attempt from Valerian and his army in Antiocheia to intercept them failed because of the plague. While his army was in that weakened state, Shapur invaded northern Mesopotamia in 260, probably in early Spring.|$|E
60|$|The crowds had dispersed. But for {{the green}} arches which still stood as they were erected Casterbridge life had resumed its {{ordinary}} shape. Henchard went down Corn Street till he came to Farfrae's house, where he knocked, and left a message {{that he would be}} glad to see his employer at the granaries <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> conveniently <b>could</b> come there. Having done this he proceeded round to the back and entered the yard.|$|R
60|$|Another {{of those}} bows he so detested! Mountebank! Never, never {{would he be}} able to stand the fellow! But he must not, would not, show it. And, <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> decently <b>could,</b> <b>he</b> went, taking his lonely way back through this region, of which his {{knowledge}} was almost limited to Lord's Cricket-ground, with a sense of doubt and desolation, an irritation more than ever mixed with the resolve to be always at hand if the child wanted him.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Die soon {{understood}} the whole matter. His young friend Harcourt {{was going into}} Parliament with the special object of becoming a solicitor-general <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> possible. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> so become by means only of two moving powers. He must be solicitor-general either to the Whigs or to the Tories. To which he should be so was a question mainly indifferent to Mr. Harcourt himself, and also to Mr. Die in framing his advice.|$|R
25|$|As McMahon expected, WCW did address Hart and the {{aftermath}} of the screwjob on Nitro from the Mid-South Coliseum in Memphis that same night. Mike Tenay and Tony Schiavone strongly criticized McMahon and Michaels for their actions. The show started with Bischoff making reference to Hart's impending arrival in WCW and his punching McMahon in the face, and he then used his on-air persona as the mouthpiece for the New World Order to claim (kayfabe) that Hart was to join the nWo as <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> be signed to WCW. Hollywood Hogan, Kevin Nash, Scott Hall, {{and the rest of the}} nWo members stood with Canadian flags and sang the Canadian national anthem.|$|E
25|$|Born in Unley, South Australia, Chappell was {{the second}} of three sons born in Adelaide to Arthur Martin and Jeanne Ellen (née Richardson), a Cornish Australian family. He was steeped in the game from a very early age: his father Martin was a noted grade cricketer in Adelaide who put a bat in his hands as <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> walk, while his {{maternal}} grandfather was the famous all-round sportsman Vic Richardson, who had captained Australia in Test cricket. Elder brother Ian and younger brother Trevor also played for Australia, and Greg closely followed in Ian's footsteps to the top. Given weekly lessons by coach Lynn Fuller, the brothers fought out fierce backyard cricket matches, with no holds barred. The fraternal relationship between Ian and Greg became legendary in Australian cricketing history for volatile verbal slanging matches, even during hard fought Test matches, which had their genesis in the family backyard.|$|E
25|$|Gershwin was of Russian Jewish and Ukrainian Jewish ancestry. His grandfather, Jakov Gershowitz, {{had served}} for 25 {{years as a}} {{mechanic}} for the Imperial Russian Army to earn the right of free travel and residence as a Jew, finally retiring near Saint Petersburg. His teenage son, Moishe Gershowitz, worked as a leather cutter for women's shoes. Moishe Gershowitz met {{and fell in love}} with Roza Bruskina, the teenage daughter of a furrier in Vilnius. She and her family moved to New York due to increasing anti-Jewish sentiment in Russia, changing her first name to Rose. Moishe, faced with compulsory military service if he remained in Russia, moved to America as <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> afford to. Once in New York, he changed his first name to Morris. Gershowitz lived with a maternal uncle in Brooklyn, working as a foreman in a women's shoe factory. When he married Rose on July 21, 1895. Gershowitz soon Americanized his name to Gershwine.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Gray {{visited his}} patient shortly after Mr. Middlemas's departure--as <b>soon,</b> indeed, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> be admitted. <b>He</b> {{found her in}} violent agitation. Gray's {{experience}} dictated the best mode of relief and tranquillity. He caused her infant {{to be brought to}} her. She wept over it for a long time, and the violence of her agitation subsided under the influence of parental feelings, which, from her appearance of extreme youth, she must have experienced for the first time.|$|R
60|$|Peter {{said that}} he {{supposed}} that this was so, but {{all the time he}} kept thinking what a pity it was that Killy ever killed his feathered neighbors. As <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> conveniently <b>could</b> <b>he</b> politely bade Killy good-by and hurried home to the dear Old Briar-patch, there to think over how queer it seemed that a member of the hawk family should nest in a hollow tree {{and a member of the}} Swallow family should dig a hole in the ground.|$|R

25|$|Grant {{was born}} in West Dean on 16 June 1874, on the Wiltshire/Hampshire border, but moved {{with his family to}} Bath in childhood. He left school as <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>could,</b> and {{followed}} in his father's footsteps to become a gardener, and then later worked as a waterworks inspector. He played club cricket for the Bath Cricket Club, and impressed enough to be selected for Somerset County Cricket Club in 1899. He opened the bowling and collected two wickets on his debut, against Kent at the Angel Ground in Tonbridge. Grant played once more for Somerset that season, taking a further two wickets against Gloucestershire. Though he made three further first-class appearances for Somerset—two in 1900 and one in 1901—he did not take any further wickets for the county, and finished his first-class career with five appearances, four wickets and a bowling average of 36.00. He also scored 66 runs at an average of 11.00.|$|E
25|$|A bad student, {{violent and}} inattentive, at 12 Cutolo was already roaming {{the streets with}} a gang of teenagers, {{committing}} petty burglaries and harassing shopkeepers. As <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> drive he bought a car, both for prestige and because it allowed him greater mobility in his raids. At the age of 21, on February 24, 1963, he committed his first homicide. He killed a man whose girlfriend had been slapped by Cutolo due to an alleged insult. In the ensuing fight, Cutolo pulled out a gun and shot him to death. He was {{convicted and sentenced to}} life imprisonment, reduced to 24 years after appeal. He was sent to Poggioreale prison in Naples. Entering the prison world on a murder conviction made Cutolo a “tough guy”. In prison Cutolo learned the rules of the criminal world: he became a man of honour, paid respect to more powerful inmates, and started gathering personal prestige because of his striking personality. He never lost sight of his ambition and his desire {{to become one of the}} biggest bosses of the Neapolitan underworld.|$|E
25|$|After the Alvord mine in California was {{destroyed}} in a fire, Burnham stayed in California until 1894 to wrap up his family's affairs with the mine and left for the South African Republic as <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> to join his brother Fred already in Bulawayo, Matabeleland. He soon found work as a mining engineer and {{was in charge of}} the assay laboratory and smelting room at the Langlaagte Royal Mine in the Transvaal.

25|$|The thirty-one {{years during}} which Huxley {{occupied}} {{the chair of}} natural history at the Royal School of Mines included work on vertebrate palaeontology and on many projects to advance the place of science in British life.

He promised to come in <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> possibly <b>could.</b> If Westover thought Jackson ought to be got home at once, and was not fit to travel alone, he asked him to send a hospital nurse with him.|$|R
60|$|One day I was {{listening}} to some conversation upon this subject when an American student said that for some time he had been under sentence for a slight breach of the peace and had promised the constable that he would presently find an unoccupied day and betake himself to prison.
