Swirls appear at points (xp, yp, c) and (−xp, yp, −c) in state-A. In state-B the swirls are at points (−xp, −yp, c) and (xp, −yp, −c). With micromagnetic simulations we demonstrate the possibility of a nucleation-free switching between those states, with possible applicability in devices.

40|$|This two-part {{paper is}} {{intended}} to clarify definitions in dual transformer modeling that are vague, provide accurate modeling guidelines, clarify misconceptions about numerical instability, provide a unified dual model for {{a specific type of}} transformer, and introduce new paths of research to the power systems/electrical machinery community for low-frequency transients. Part I discussed the topology of duality-based models and some important issues, such as the most common approaches to derive dual models and their variety, the equivalence of negative inductance and mutual couplings to represent the leakage inductance of three-winding transformers, and the numerical oscillations caused by the use of nontopological models. This part of the paper discusses and compares white-, gray-, and black-box models. The paper also reviews hysteresis models (static and dynamic) and highlights the differences between the air-core inductance and <b>saturation</b> <b>inductance.</b> The available dual models for the representation of the transformer tank are then presented. A unified and accurate model of a three-phase core-type transformer adequate for all low-frequency transients is presented. Finally, concrete guidelines are presented for the appropriate selection of the model topology and parameters for different low-frequency transient studies...|$|E

40|$|The {{induction}} machine model parameters {{need to be}} estimated with good accuracy to ensure a good performance of the drive. Due to the magnetic <b>saturation,</b> the <b>inductances</b> vary {{as a function of}} the flux level. The magnetizing curve can be identified at standstill, but more accurate results are obtained if the identification is performed as the machine is running. In this paper, the magnetic saturation is modeled using a power function, and adaptation laws for the function parameters are proposed. The adaptation method is implemented in the control system of a sensorless drive.

40|$|Accurate {{inductance}} {{calculation of}} permanent-magnet synchronous machines is a relevant topic, since the inductances determine {{a large part}} of the electrical machine behavior. However, the inductance calculation, as well as the inductance measurement, is never a completely straightforward task when saturation occurs. In this paper, the total flux in the d and q axes are obtained from finite- element method or measurements and therefore include saturation and cross-couplings. The inductances are obtained from analytical post-processing based on an equivalent magnetic circuit. The originality of this method is that it accommodates the changes in the magnet flux and the inductances with the level of <b>saturation.</b> The resulting <b>inductance</b> values are the ones seen by the converter or the grid, as found by a more accurate approach...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—This paper compares {{two methods}} {{to compute the}} pa- rameters of a line-start {{synchronous}} reluctance (LSSR) machine, by means of ﬁnite element analysis. In both methods, both {{the impact of the}} skin effect on the rotor parameters and the impact of <b>saturation</b> on magnetizing <b>inductances</b> are taken into account. The ﬁrst method is based on an equivalent single-phase model of the machine. A pulsating ﬂux is imposed along the d- and q-axes separately, so as to compute the machine parameters along both d- and q-axes. Magnetizing inductances are achieved {{as a function of the}} ﬂux, and the rotor resistances and leakage inductances are obtained as a function of rotor frequency. The second method is based on the d-q axis model of the LSSR machine. A rotating mag- netic ﬁeld is imposed, and the d-q axis parameters are estimated simultaneously from the ﬁeld solution. In addition, such a method allows the cross-saturation to be considered as well...|$|R

A Vernier structure is {{integrated with the}} axial-flux PM machine to include the magnetic gear effect and improve output torque. The sensorless control strategy of the proposed machine, including initial rotor position estimation and rotating position estimation, is proposed for flux-modulation motors in this paper. The initial rotor position estimation {{is based on the}} technique of rectangular pulse voltage injection and the rotating rotor position estimation is based on the sliding mode observer (SMO). The <b>saturation</b> effect on <b>inductances,</b> which is the theoretical basis of the rectangular pulse voltage injection, makes the stator parameter variation in different loads and affects the SMO estimation. To overcome this problem, a novel online parameter self-adjustment procedure for the SMO is introduced.

40|$|Zusammenfassung (dt.) Abstract: Four {{different}} control {{strategies for}} {{the control of the}} inverter currents of a doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG) system are analysed and evaluated by means of simulation using Matlab/Simulink. Special attention is paid to the behaviour of the generator during asymmetrical grid voltage dips. Different control schemes are employed to reduce torque and DC-link voltage oscillations and the resulting additional loads on the system during such dips. The field-oriented control (FOC) scheme is the one usually deployed for the control of DFIGs in wind power plants and is used as the reference system within this study. The inverter currents are regulated by proportional-integral controllers (PI) in a rotating coordinate system in which they are represented by dq-components. These components are direct quantities. A positive-negative-sequence current control (PNC) strategy is used to control the positive-sequence currents and the negative-sequence currents separately in two contra-rotating coordinate systems using PI-controllers. In contrast to the first two control strategies, frequency-selective current controllers (FSC) serve to regulate the currents in a static coordinate system. In this case the currents are represented by two components which are alternating quantities. Combining the FSC and PNC strategies will produce frequency-selective positive-negative-sequence current controllers (FSC(PN)). These control the currents in a static coordinate system. The currents are represented by alternating components as in frequency-selective control but separate reference values for the negative-sequence currents are provided as in positive-negative-sequence control. Theoretical reasoning suggests and simulations prove that the three proposed alternative control strategies can improve the behaviour of DFIG-systems during slight asymmetries in the grid voltage. During severe dips the effect is limited by several constraints, namely by the inverter rating (limited inverter voltages and currents), by time delays introduced by the component calculation for PNC and FSC(PN) and by the nonlinear behaviour of the DFIG-system (<b>saturation</b> of mutual <b>inductance).</b> Nevertheless, the proposed novel control strategies could be applied beneficially to other systems, such as photovoltaic inverters or full-scale inverters for wind power plants...|$|R
40|$|This thesis deals withmodeling {{and control}} of an {{electric}} drive equipped with a permanentmagnet assisted synchronous reluctance (PMSynRel) machine for a {{plug-in hybrid electric vehicle}} application. In {{the first part of the}} thesis, a special use of the PMSynRel machine in consideration, known as an integrated charger concept, is investigated. The integrated charger feature allows using the PMSynRel machine as a part of the vehicle’s on-board charging system when charging the battery from the grid. A finite-element based analysis is performed providing important insights into the machine operation during the charging process. Dynamic models are developed that facilitate the controller development and the estimation of the efficiency during charging. In the second part of the thesis, position sensorless control of the PMSynRel drive when applied in an automotive application is considered and analyzed thoroughly. First, a fundamental-excitation based rotor-position estimation technique is investigated. The study shows that the impact of current dynamics on the resulting torque dynamics has to be considered in some very demanding applications. Second, focus is put on signalinjection based sensorless control methods. Impacts of nonlinearities, such as magnetic <b>saturation,</b> cross-saturation and <b>inductance</b> spatial harmonics, on sensorless control performance are investigated and methods to improve the sensorless control quality are summarized and presented. An approach to determine the feasible region for operating sensorless at low-speeds without directly measuring the differential inductances is proposed. For the PMSynRel drive in consideration, the achievable maximum torque is limited when operating sensorless following the maximum-torque-per-ampere (MTPA) current reference trajectory at low-speeds. An optimization approach is therefore proposed which extends the output torque when operating sensorless while still maintaining a relatively high efficiency. To initialize the sensorless control correctly from standstill, the impact of the saturated magnetic bridges in the rotor is also investigated. Finally, torsional drive-train oscillations and active damping schemes are considered. An off-vehicle setup for implementing and evaluating different active damping schemes is proposed. Of particular interest for sensorless operation in automotive applications, the impact of slow speed estimation on the possibility to achieve good active damping control is investigated and a design approach that allows the implementation of an active damping scheme using estimated speed is suggested.

40|$|Direct-driven {{permanent}} magnet synchronous generator {{is one of}} the most promising topologies for megawatt-range wind power applications. The rotational speed of the direct-driven generator is very low compared with the traditional electrical machines. The low rotational speed requires high torque to produce megawatt-range power. The special features of the direct-driven generators caused by the low speed and high torque are discussed in this doctoral thesis. Low speed and high torque set high demands on the torque quality. The cogging torque and the load torque ripple must be as low as possible to prevent mechanical failures. In this doctoral thesis, various methods to improve the torque quality are compared with each other. The rotor surface shaping, magnet skew, magnet shaping, and the asymmetrical placement of magnets and stator slots are studied not only by means of torque quality, but also the effects on the electromagnetic performance and manufacturability of the machine are discussed. The heat transfer of the direct-driven generator must be designed to handle the copper losses of the stator winding carrying high current density and to keep the temperature of the magnets low enough. The cooling system of the direct-driven generator applying the doubly radial air cooling with numerous radial cooling ducts was modeled with a lumped-parameter-based thermal network. The performance of the cooling system was discussed during the steady and transient states. The effect of the number and width of radial cooling ducts was explored. The large number of radial cooling ducts drastically increases the impact of the stack end area effects, because the stator stack consists of numerous substacks. The effects of the radial cooling ducts on the effective axial length of the machine were studied by analyzing the crosssection of the machine in the axial direction. The method to compensate the magnet end area leakage was considered. The effect of the cooling ducts and the stack end area effects on the no-load voltages and inductances of the machine were explored by using numerical analysis tools based on the three-dimensional finite element method. The electrical efficiency of the {{permanent magnet}} machine with different control methods was estimated analytically over the whole speed and torque range. The electrical efficiencies achieved with the most common control methods were compared with each other. The stator voltage increase caused by the armature reaction was analyzed. The effect of <b>inductance</b> <b>saturation</b> as a function of load current was implemented to the analytical efficiency calculation...|$|R
40|$|Synchronous motors {{are used}} mainly in large drives, {{for example in}} ship {{propulsion}} systems and in steel factories' rolling mills because of their high efficiency, high overload capacity and good performance in the field weakening range. This, however, requires an extremely good torque control system. A fast torque response and a torque accuracy are basic requirements for such a drive. For large power, high dynamic performance drives the commonly known principle of field oriented vector control has been used solely hitherto, but nowadays {{it is not the}} only way to implement such a drive. A new control method Direct Torque Control (DTC) has also emerged. The performance of such a high quality torque control as DTC in dynamically demanding industrial applications is mainly based on the accurate estimate of the various flux linkages' space vectors. Nowadays industrial motor control systems are real time applications with restricted calculation capacity. At the same time the control system requires a simple, fast calculable and reasonably accurate motor model. In this work a method to handle these problems in a Direct Torque Controlled (DTC) salient pole synchronous motor drive is proposed. A motor model which combines the induction law based "voltage model" and motor inductance parameters based "current model" is presented. The voltage model operates as a main model and is calculated at a very fast sampling rate (for example 40 kHz). The stator flux linkage calculated via integration from the stator voltages is corrected using the stator flux linkage computed from the current model. The current model acts as a supervisor that prevents only the motor stator flux linkage from drifting erroneous during longer time intervals. At very low speeds the role of the current model is emphasised but, nevertheless, the voltage model always stays the main model. At higher speeds the function of the current model correction is to act as a stabiliser of the control system. The current model contains a set of inductance parameters which must be known. The validation of the current model in steady state is not self evident. It depends on the accuracy of the saturated value of the inductances. Parameter measurement of the motor model where the supply inverter is used as a measurement signal generator is presented. This so called identification run can be performed prior to delivery or during drive commissioning. A derivation method for the inductance models used for the representation of the saturation effects is proposed. The performance of the electrically excited synchronous motor supplied with the DTC inverter is proven with experimental results. It is shown that it is possible to obtain a good static accuracy of the DTC's torque controller for an electrically excited synchronous motor. The dynamic response is fast and a new operation point is achieved without oscillation. The operation is stable throughout the speed range. The modelling of the magnetising <b>inductance</b> <b>saturation</b> is essential and cross saturation has to be considered as well. The effect of cross saturation is very significant. A DTC inverter can be used as a measuring equipment and the parameters needed for the motor model can be defined by the inverter itself. The main advantage is that the parameters defined are measured in similar magnetic operation conditions and no disagreement between the parameters will exist. The inductance models generated are adequate to meet the requirements of dynamically demanding drives...|$|R
