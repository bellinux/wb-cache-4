40|$|Many {{decision}} makers operate in dynamic {{environments in which}} markets, competitors, and technology change regularly. The ability to detect and respond to these regime shifts is critical for economic success. We conduct three experiments to test how effective individuals are at detecting such regime shifts. Specifically, we investigate when individuals {{are most likely to}} underreact to change and when they are most likely to overreact to it. We develop a system-neglect hypothesis: Individuals react primarily to the signals they observe and secondarily to the environmental system that produced the signal. The experiments, two involving probability estimation and one involving prediction, reveal a behavioral pattern consistent with our system-neglect hypothesis: Underreaction is most common in unstable environments with precise signals, and overreaction is most common in stable environments with noisy signals. We test this pattern formally in a statistical comparison of the Bayesian model with a parametric specification of the system-neglect model. regime <b>shift,</b> <b>belief</b> revision, subjective probability, change points, underreaction, overreaction...|$|E

40|$|We build a {{workable}} game of common-property resource extraction under rational Bayesian {{learning about the}} reproduction prospects of a resource. We focus on Markov-perfect strategies under truthful revelation of beliefs. For reasonable initial conditions, exogenously <b>shifting</b> the prior <b>beliefs</b> of one player toward more pessimism about the potential of natural resources to reproduce can create anti-conservation incentives. The single player whose <b>beliefs</b> have been <b>shifted</b> toward more pessimism exhibits higher exploitation rate than before.

However, the overall conservation incentive is weak, making the aggregate exploitation rate higher than before the pessimistic <b>shift</b> in <b>beliefs</b> of that single player.

40|$|We {{construct}} {{a theory of}} persistent civil conflicts, where persistence {{is driven by the}} endogenous dynamics of inter-ethnic trust and trade. In times of peace, agents belonging to two groups are randomly matched to trade bilaterally. Trade hinges on trust and cooperation. The onset of conflict signals that the aggressor has a low propensity to cooperate, harming future trust and trade. Agents observe the history of conflicts and update their beliefs over time. The theory predicts that civil wars are persistent. Moreover, even accidental conflicts that do not reflect economic fundamentals erode trust, and can plunge a society into a vicious cycle of recurrent conflicts (a war trap). The incidence of conflict can be reduced by policies abating cultural barriers, fostering inter-ethnic trade and human capital, and <b>shifting</b> <b>beliefs.</b> Coercive peace policies, such as peacekeeping forces or externally imposed regime changes, have no enduring effect...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: Research {{illustrates}} that people hold {{beliefs about the}} causes and solutions to illness. This study aimed to assess the consistency in these beliefs {{in terms of their}} variation according to type of problem and whether they are consistent with each other. Further, the study aimed to assess whether they are open to change and whether changing beliefs about cause resulted in a subsequent <b>shift</b> in <b>beliefs</b> about solutions. Design: Experimental factorial 3 (problem) × 2 (manipulated cause) design using vignettes. Methods: Two hundred seventy-nine participants rated their beliefs about the cause and solution of one of three problems (depression, obesity and sleep problems) following a vignette which described the causes as either psychological or biomedical. Results: Beliefs about causes and solutions varied according to type of problem indicating that beliefs are illness specific. The results also showed that people hold beliefs about causes and solutions which are consistent with each other as an endorsement of a psychological cause was consistently reflected in a belief that a psychological solution was most appropriate and effective. A similar pattern was seen for beliefs about biomedical causes and solutions. Finally, the results showed that beliefs were open to manipulation and that a <b>shift</b> in <b>beliefs</b> about causes resulted in a parallel <b>shift</b> in <b>beliefs</b> about solutions. Conclusions: People hold beliefs about causes and solution which vary according to type of problem.

40|$|Abstract: We {{construct}} a dynamic theory of civil conflict hinging on inter-ethnic trust and trade. The model economy is inhabited by two ethnic groups. Inter-ethnic trade requires imperfectly observed bilateral investments and one group has to form beliefs {{on the average}} propensity to trade of the other group. Since conflict disrupts trade, the onset of a conflict signals that the aggressor has a low propensity to trade. Agents observe the history of conflicts and update their beliefs over time, transmitting them to the next generation. The theory bears a set of testable predictions. First, war is a stochastic process whose frequency depends {{on the state of}} endogenous beliefs. Second, the probability of future conflicts increases after each conflict episode. Third, "accidental " conflicts that do not reflect economic fundamentals can lead to a permanent breakdown of trust, plunging a society into a vicious cycle of recurrent conflicts (a war trap). The incidence of conflict can be reduced by policies abating cultural barriers, fostering inter-ethnic trade and human capital, and <b>shifting</b> <b>beliefs.</b> Coercive peace policies such as peacekeeping force...|$|R
40|$|Dopamine is {{implicated in}} a {{diverse range of}} {{cognitive}} functions including cognitive flexibility, task switching, signalling novel or unexpected stimuli as well as advance information. There is also longstanding line of thought that links dopamine with belief formation and, crucially, aberrant belief formation in psychosis. Integrating these strands of evidence would suggest that dopamine plays {{a central role in}} belief updating and more specifically in encoding of meaningful information content in observations. The precise nature of this relationship has remained unclear. To directly address this question we developed a paradigm that allowed us to decompose two distinct types of information content, information-theoretic surprise that reflects the unexpectedness of an observation, and epistemic value that induces <b>shifts</b> in <b>beliefs</b> or, more formally, Bayesian surprise. Using functional magnetic-resonance imaging in humans we show that dopamine-rich midbrain regions encode <b>shifts</b> in <b>beliefs</b> whereas surprise is encoded in prefrontal regions, including the pre-supplementary motor area and dorsal cingulate cortex. By linking putative dopaminergic activity to belief updating these data provide a link to false belief formation that characterises hyperdopaminergic states associated with idiopathic and drug induced psychosis...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} an attempt to explain {{currency}} crises and exchange rate movements in open emerging markets during the 1990 s. A model is developed that allows a systematic comparison and evaluation of three competing explanations for crises: weak economic fundamentals, contagion and sunspots, i. e. exogenous <b>shifts</b> in agents' <b>beliefs.</b> Markov-switching regimes models and panel methodologies confirm that exogenous <b>shifts</b> in <b>beliefs</b> and in particular contagion, i. e. a high degree of real integration and financial interdependence among affected countries, are core explanations for the financial crisis of the 1990 s. The model has a remarkably good out-of-sample predictive power.

40|$|What {{happens when}} the unstoppable force of {{liberalization}} collides with the immovable object of national financial institutions in the advanced industrial democracies? To answer this question and evaluate alternative mechanisms to explain institutional change, {{this article examines the}} cases of the three large European economies with concentrated share ownership—France, Germany, and Italy. In the formal legal mechanism, interest coalitions adopt new laws, leading actors to deviate from formerly stable patterns of behavior in shareholding. In the joint <b>belief</b> <b>shift</b> mechanism, collective actors use a triggering event to jointly reevaluate their views of how the world works and thus how their interests can best be pursued. Using the metric of patient capital, this article shows that institutional change took place in France but not in Germany or Italy, despite the fact that Germany and Italy experienced significant regulatory change in the area of corporate governance while France did not. This evidence fits joint <b>belief</b> <b>shift</b> and is inconsistent with the formal legal mechanism. It is likely that the importance of the two mechanisms of institutional change depends on the degree of strategic interdependence among institutional actors: where it is high, the joint <b>belief</b> <b>shift</b> mechanism is likely to precipitate change; and where it is low, the formal legal mechanism is likely to precipitate change...|$|R
40|$|In our {{contemporary}} Western society, death has become taboo. Despite its inevitability, {{we focus on}} maintaining youthfulness and well-being, while fearing death’s intrusion in our daily activities. In contrast, the ancient Greeks embraced death more openly and effectively, developing a variety of rituals to help them grieve the dead and, in the process, alleviate anxiety and suffering. The book examines conceptions of death and the afterlife in the ancient Greek world, revealing few similarities—and many differences—between ancient and modern ways of approaching death. Exploring the cultural and religious foundations underlying Greek burial rites and customs, it traces the evolution of these practices during the archaic and classical periods. It also explains {{the relationship between the}} living and the dead as reflected in grave markers, epitaphs, and burial offerings and discusses the social and political dimensions of burial and lamentation. The book also describes <b>shifting</b> <b>beliefs</b> about life after death, showing how concepts of immortality, depicted so memorably in Homer’s epics, began to change during the classical period. Death in the Greek World straddles the boundary between literary and religious imagination and synthesizes observations from archaeology, visual art, philosophy, politics, and law. The book places particular emphasis on Homer’s epics, the first literary testimony of an understanding of death in ancient Greece...|$|R
40|$|The {{debate has}} long raged over whether mothers should {{stay home with}} their {{children}} or return to the workforce following {{the birth of a}} child. Recent discourse on the modern family supports a paradigm shift to a more egalitarian family picture, evidencing the <b>shifting</b> <b>beliefs</b> of each new generation. However, women still expect to be primarily responsible for childcare in concert with pursuit of career aspirations. Research has shown a positive relationship between a mother’s education and being in the labour force. Consistent with the views of the human capital approach and the possibility that a recent dip in maternal employment does not signify a trend, my first hypothesis is that the higher the education of the mother, the less likely she is to cite looking after children as her main activity. My second hypothesis is that the higher the education of the mother, the more likely she is to be employed. My hypothesis that education and employment would be positively related was supported by my findings. The introduction of marriage as a control variable highlighted the difference in the proportion of lesser-educated women’s employment status. It would appear from my findings that the correlation between highly educated women and being a stay-at-home mom may be trending upward...|$|R

40|$|Fashion {{photography}} is often disparaged {{as a commercial}} endeavor, intended solely to whet the public’s appetite for consumer goods and expensive apparel. Only within {{the past couple of}} decades has it emerged as a subject of historical analysis. When looking back over decades of fashion photography, it becomes clear that it is a medium that expresses the Zeitgeist, the spirit of the times, providing an almost uncanny tool for exposing changes in artistic influence, commercial impact, and social and cultural customs in society. It is an important cultural feedback loop that both reflects self-identity and helps shape it. Fashion photography’s stylistic evolution from pictorialism of the early 20 th century to today’s provocative depictions of violence shows us that our notion of morality “is not a set of fixed absolutes stating a monolithic culture’s unchanging standards of acceptability, but, rather, constantly <b>shifting</b> <b>beliefs</b> that can be molded and challenged to reflect the myriad social and cultural groups of western culture” (Arnold xiii). For my senior thesis, I want to examine current depictions of sexualized violence against women in fashion photography.

40|$|Graduation date: 1974 Purpose of the Study The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} if eighth grade students taking industrial arts education for the first time would experience a significant <b>shift</b> in <b>beliefs</b> about the problem solving process and have class performance altered by participation in project Occupational Versatility. In order to accomplish this, the following procedures were considered. Procedures The design for this investigation was a variation of the experimental four-group design utilizing a pre-test and post-test. The treatment for this experimental study was project Occupational Versatility, which is an individualized industrial arts education program. The Childhood Attitude Inventory for Problem Solving was used to establish and assess whether there was a <b>shift</b> in <b>beliefs</b> about the problem solving process. A five point rating scale was used to verify a significant shift in class performance in terms of self-sufficiency, productivity and adaptability. The statistical treatments used to analyze the measured results were the One Way Analysis of Variance and the Pearson Product-Moment correlation coefficient. The following basic conclusions were drawn from the data obtained in this study. 1. There was a difference in the students' beliefs about the problem solving process and class performance between the combined treatment and the combined control group, in regard to all factors. This <b>shift</b> in <b>beliefs</b> about problem solving and class performance was attributed to the treatment group's participation in project Occupational Versatility. 2. There was a significant relationship at post-test in the students' class performance and problem solving beliefs, within the combined treatment group and within the combined control group. However, within the combined control group, these factors are not as highly related. Recommendations On the basis of the findings and conclusions drawn in this study, it is recommended that: 1. A realistic problem solving ability instrument be developed based upon the four technology approach of power, electricity, materials processes and graphic communications. This performance test should be basic and general to all four areas and should be developed to be utilized for assessing actual problem solving ability of junior high school students. 2. Occupational Versatility should be given consideration as an approach for accomplishing the broad educational goals of industrial arts...|$|R

40|$|Overview: Research {{in higher}} {{education}} has shown a link between an instructor’s reflective practice and student learning. However, reflection can fail when instructors have insufficient knowledge on what to reflect on or how to change. This {{highlights the importance of}} support for reflective practice. In this workshop, participants will learn about the existing teaching square model, which supports the development of reflective practice and self-assessment. In this model four participants form a ‘square’ and observe each other teaching, following a round of observations, participants meet and share how the observations impacted them. We will share our experience of forming and implementing a teaching square as well as how the experience impacted our teaching practices and beliefs. During the workshop, participants will plan a teaching square they can implement and will be shown how to document their learning. We will also explore ideas for how to evaluate the impact of a teaching square. Description and Rationale: We utilized the teaching square model of peer observation and self-reflection to help enhance our teaching practice. The model involves observing each other’s classes twice over the semester. After each observation, we shared what we learned about our own teaching by observing each other. As an interdisciplinary science group with different levels of teaching experience, our goals were diverse: receiving feedback on teaching practices, observing different teaching styles and strategies in action, and looking for ways to refresh our teaching practices and practice self-reflection. Outcomes: We all enhanced aspects of our teaching practices and gained transformative insights. Enhancements included embedding real world applications into lessons, developing opportunities for active learning, facilitating group discussions and using classroom technology more effectively. Transformative impacts included increased confidence, an increased ability to recognize strengths in our current teaching practices, and <b>shifting</b> <b>beliefs</b> {{about the role of the}} instructor in the classroom...|$|R
40|$|Rachel Corrie {{was a young}} American {{woman who}} {{died at the age}} of twenty-three in Gaza in 2003. She was killed when an Israeli Occupation Force {{bulldozer}} ran over her while she was defending a Palestinian house from demolition. Her martyr's death, combined with the force of her descriptions of her experiences as an activist in Palestine, not only provoked response from other activists; it became material for a number of theatrical projects, among them productions by the Royal Court Theatre in London, Bread and Puppet Theatre in the US, and in a production I recently wrote and directed here in New Zealand. This thesis considers the example of Rachel Corrie's activism in Palestine and the theatrical performances it engendered in order to examine the role of theatre in and as an activist project. The theatre is an important component of the ongoing movement for social change. It assembles temporary communities and it portrays issues in ways that are both accessible and open to debate. But theatricality is just as often a key component of activist actions outside the theatre building: in street performances and demonstrations, and also in the way some activists can be seen to pursue their political objectives on a daily basis. Finally, the theatre is a material act of production which can challenge the dominant model of production and thus has the potential to be become an activist project as itself. As a result of my analyses of this material, I hope to provide a framework of understanding both for myself and others, of the likely role of theatre in and as an activist project, and this understanding will be of assistance in the cultural task of <b>shifting</b> <b>beliefs</b> in the movement for social change. The key theorists used in this thesis are Walter Benjamin and Raymond Williams...|$|R
