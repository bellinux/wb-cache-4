5000|$|... 70mm film used {{in still}} cameras, like Mamiya and Hasselblad, and 70mm print film used in IMAX {{projectors}} {{have the same}} gauge or height as 120 film. With 70mm <b>cine</b> <b>projector</b> film, the perforations are inset by 2.5mm {{to make room for}} the old-style optical sound tracks; a standard established by Todd-AO in the 1950s. IMAX cameras use 65mm film, which have perforations and pitch that match-up to the 70mm film used in IMAX projectors.|$|R
5000|$|The tape {{is pulled}} from the <b>supply</b> <b>reel</b> by a capstan and pinch roller, {{similar to those used}} in audio tape recorders.|$|R
50|$|Early VHS-C {{cassettes}} did {{not have}} a mechanism to ratchet or lock the <b>supply</b> <b>reel</b> when not in use, making them susceptible to spilling tape inside the shell. Consequently, manufacturers placed a label on their camcorders and adapters to warn the user to check that the tape is not slackened before inserting a cassette. The user could dissipate the slack by manually turning the take-up gear. Later cassettes corrected this problem by adding teeth to the <b>supply</b> <b>reel</b> to lock it in place when no upward pressure is applied. The spindle of the camcorder or VCR supplies pressure to float the reel's turntable and teeth above the shell, allowing it to rotate freely when in use.|$|R
5000|$|The {{frames are}} later played {{back in a}} <b>ciné</b> <b>projector</b> at a {{specific}} speed, called the [...] "frame rate" [...] (number of frames per second). While viewing, a person's eyes and brain merge the separate pictures {{to create the illusion}} of motion. The first ciné camera was built around 1888 and by 1890 several types were being manufactured. The standard film size for ciné cameras was quickly established as 35mm film and this remained in use until transition to digital cinematography. Other professional standard formats include 70 mm film and 16mm film whilst amateurs film makers used 9.5 mm film, 8mm film or Standard 8 and Super 8 before the move into digital format.|$|R
5000|$|Lennon {{dubbed the}} {{technique}} [...] "flanging" [...] after producer George Martin jokingly {{told him it}} was produced using a [...] "double-bifurcated sploshing flange". Only years later did Martin learn that another technique, also called flanging, was already in use. The term referred to an engineer's alternately pressing and releasing his finger against the flange (rim) of the <b>supply</b> <b>reel</b> on one of two synchronized tape machines as the same audio signal was combined and transferred to a third machine, slightly slowing the machine then allowing it to come back up to speed and in sync with the other, applying a [...] "swooshing" [...] comb filtering effect to the combined audio signal. Alternatively, the engineer could press the flange of one <b>supply</b> <b>reel</b> then the other to achieve a fuller effect.|$|R
40|$|Semi-automatic-wire {{labeling}} equipment installs heat-shrink identification sleeves on small-diameter wires for moderate-size production runs. <b>Supply</b> <b>reel</b> contains wire of desired {{diameter and}} is cut into lengths {{set on the}} measuring rolls. Required number of identification sleeves are slipped over wire, which is then placed through sleeve-releasing mechanism. Sleeves are shrunk at 350 degrees F in an infrared oven...|$|R
50|$|The EIAJ {{format is}} a {{standard}} half-inch format used by various manufacturers. EIAJ-1 is an open-reel format. EIAJ-2 uses a cartridge that contains a <b>supply</b> <b>reel,</b> but not the take-up reel. Since the take-up reel {{is part of the}} recorder, the tape has to be fully rewound before removing the cartridge, which is a relatively slow procedure.|$|R
40|$|Spark-erosion cutting using a wire {{electrode}} paid {{off from a}} <b>supply</b> <b>reel</b> is a highly precise process for cutting all metals and some ceramic materials. In order to compensate for wear, the {{wire electrode}} is continuously unreeled from the <b>supply</b> <b>reel</b> and pulled through the cutting joint at a speed of some centimeters per second. In order to avoid thermally caused wire breaks, the wire electrode has a non-conductive core which is provided with a conductive coating. During the preferably short pulses applied, current flows in a less than 10 m thick coating below the surface due to the skin effect, so that conductivity is not diminished {{as a result of}} the non-conductive core. For the non-conductive core, a high tensile strength material capable of accepting high tensile forces can be used. The non-conducting core prevents a thermally caused break in the wire electrode...|$|R
40|$|Progress in the mechanical/structural {{assembly}} of the beam builder is reported. The following structures were investigated: cross brace magazine/dispenser subsystem; and rolling mill <b>supply</b> <b>reel,</b> guide, and drive. The fabrication facility design and a detail design of all major subsystem components are discussed. The number of spot welds per structural joint were reduced which enables the doubling of length of truss which can be produced within known electrode life limits...|$|R
50|$|The above {{describes}} a typical transport system; however, manufacturers engineered many alternative designs. For example, some designs used a horizontal transport deck where the operator simply set the tape <b>reel</b> in the <b>supply</b> <b>reel</b> bay, {{closed the door}} and pressed the load button, then a vacuum system would draw the tape along the path and onto a take-up hub within the mechanism. Some designs eliminated the vacuum columns in favor of a microprocessor-controlled direct drive design.|$|R
5000|$|Historically, movie {{projectors}} {{prior to}} modern automation {{would include a}} bell, activated by centrifugal force when the <b>supply</b> <b>reel</b> reached an appropriate speed. Two projectors would be used, requiring that the projectionist switch between the [...] "operating" [...] and [...] "ready" [...] projectors when a cue mark was visible on the screen in the upper right corner. The bell alerted the projectionist (who had likely viewed the movie too many times to ensure alertness) that attention was required.|$|R
5000|$|It {{has been}} claimed that George Martin's pseudoscientific {{explanation}} of ADT ("We take the original image and we split {{it through a}} double-bifurcated sploshing flange") given to Lennon originated the phrase flanging in recording, as Lennon would refer to ADT as [...] "Ken's flanger", although other sources claim the term originated from pressing a finger on the tape recorder's tape <b>supply</b> <b>reel</b> (the flange) to make small adjustments to the phase of the copy relative to the original.|$|R
50|$|Reel-to-reel or open-reel {{audio tape}} {{recording}} is {{the form of}} magnetic tape audio recording in which the recording medium is held on a reel, rather than being securely contained within a cassette. In use, the <b>supply</b> <b>reel</b> or feed reel containing the tape is mounted on a spindle; {{the end of the}} tape is manually pulled out of the reel, threaded through mechanical guides and a tape head assembly, and attached by friction to the hub of a second, initially empty takeup reel.|$|R
5000|$|Because {{the supply}} and take-up spools of the {{recording}} tape were no longer individually powered as in the UNITYPER 1, a mechanical solution consisting of a differential spring, ratching escapement and slip clutches was developed to overcome the problem of [...] "differential moment" [...] of accurately moving tape across the head. This was necessary because the <b>supply</b> <b>reel</b> is always decreasing in effective diameter while the take up reel is increasing in effective diameter as the tape moves from one reel to the other during encoding, and again when backspacing or rewinding.|$|R

50|$|Frippertronics (a term {{coined by}} poet Joanna Walton, Fripp's girlfriend {{in the late}} 1970s) is an analog delay system {{consisting}} of two side-by-side reel-to-reel tape recorders. The machines are configured so that the tape travels from the <b>supply</b> <b>reel</b> of the first machine to the take-up reel of the second, allowing sound recorded by the first machine to be played back later on the second. The audio of the second machine is routed back to the first, causing the delayed signal to repeat while new audio is mixed in with it. The amount of delay (usually three to five seconds) is controlled by increasing or reducing {{the distance between the}} machines.|$|R
50|$|WARQ {{signed on}} the air as WXRY on February 6, 1971 in mono with a Beautiful/Easy Listening music format. Later, the station {{converted}} to FM stereo, still with a Beautiful/Easy Listening music format <b>supplied</b> on <b>reel</b> to reel tape by Schulke.|$|R
5000|$|The capstan is a {{rotating}} spindle used to move recording tape through {{the mechanism of}} a tape recorder. The tape is threaded between the capstan and one or more rubber-covered wheels, called pinch rollers, which press against the capstan, thus providing friction necessary for the capstan to pull the tape. The capstan is always placed downstream (in the direction of tape motion) from the tape heads. To maintain the required tension against the tape heads and {{other part of the}} tape transport, a small amount of drag is placed on the <b>supply</b> <b>reel.</b> Tape recorder capstans have a function similar to nautical capstans, which however have no pinch rollers, the line simply being wound around them.|$|R
5000|$|The three biggest {{problems}} with paper tape were: * Reliability. It was common practice to follow each mechanical copying of a tape with a manual hole-by-hole comparison.* Rewinding {{the tape was}} difficult and prone to problems. Great care was needed to avoid tearing the tape. Some systems used fanfold paper tape rather than rolled paper tape. In these systems, no rewinding was necessary nor were any fancy <b>supply</b> <b>reel,</b> takeup reel, or tension arm mechanisms required; the tape merely fed from the supply tank through the reader to the takeup tank, refolding itself back into exactly the same form as when it was fed into the reader.* Low information density. Datasets much larger than a few dozen kilobytes are impractical to handle in paper tape format.|$|R
25|$|In most cassettes, the {{magnetic}} tape {{is attached to}} each spool with a leader, usually made of strong plastic. This leader protected the weaker magnetic tape from the shock occurring when the tape reached the end. Leaders can be complex: a plastic slide-in wedge anchors a short fully opaque plastic tape to the take-up hub; one or more tinted semi-opaque plastic segments follow; the clear leader (a tintless semi-opaque plastic segment) follows, which wraps almost {{all the way around}} the <b>supply</b> <b>reel,</b> before splicing to {{the magnetic}} tape itself. The clear leader spreads the shock load to a long stretch of tape instead of to the microscopic splice. Various patents have been issued detailing leader construction and associated tape player mechanisms to detect leaders. Cassette tape users would also use spare leaders to repair broken tapes.|$|R
40|$|The {{proposed}} tape {{transport mechanism}} {{consists of three}} servos: the capstan servo which controls the speed required by the tape transport system, the take-up <b>reel</b> servo and <b>supply</b> <b>reel</b> servo, which will rotate at a slightly different speed from the capstan servo to provide the necessary tape tension control. The mathematical model {{of the system is}} derived. Since the proposed system is a multi-input/multi-output (MIMO) system, the mathematical model is arranged into a state-space representation of the system. The controller designed for the tape transport system is the linear quadratic regulator (LQR). Since steady-state error is present, and intended design specification is not fully met, an input gain matrix TV is implemented. Simulation is carried out using MATLAB to investigate the step responses of the uncompensated tape transport system, with the linear quadratic regulator and with the linear quadratic regulator with the implementation of TV.

5000|$|In 1968, {{the record}} {{producer}} for The Litter, Warren Kendrick, devised {{a method to}} precisely control flanging by placing two 15 IPS (inches per second) stereo Ampex tape recorders side by side. The take-up reel of recorder A and <b>supply</b> <b>reel</b> of B were disabled, as were channel 2 of recorder A, channel 1 of recorder B and the erase head of recorder B. The tape was fed left-to-right across both recorders and an identical signal was recorded on each channel of the tape, but displaced by approximately 18 inches {{along the length of}} the tape. During recording, an ordinary screwdriver was wedged between the recorders to make the tape run [...] "uphill" [...] and [...] "downhill." [...] The same configuration was employed during the playback/mixdown to a third recorder. The screwdriver was moved back and forth to cause the two signals to diverge, then converge. The latter technique permits zero point flanging; i.e., the lagging signal crosses over the leading signal and the signals change places.|$|R
40|$|GWPD 4 —Measuring {{water levels}} {{by use of}} an {{electric}} tape VERSION: 2010. 1 PURPOSE: To measure the depth to the water surface below land-surface datum using the electric tape method. Materials and Instruments 1. An electric tape, double-wired and graduated in feet, tenths and hundredths of feet.

50|$|The {{vacuum system}} {{provided}} a physical buffer between the precision {{movements of the}} capstan and the large movements of the reels by storing a short length of tape in the vacuum column under relatively low tension. The vacuum columns were chambers open at one end, the openings being {{in line with the}} tape path before and after the capstan and roller assemblies. The amount of tape in the column was controlled by four optical or vacuum sensors {{on the sides of the}} columns. The control electronics kept the curve of the tape loop between the two inner sensors, cueing the <b>supply</b> <b>reel</b> to feed more or the take-up reel to take more as necessary. The outer two sensors, at the very top and bottom of the columns, served to sense malfunctions in the feed mechanism during operation, prompting the control electronics to shut off all operation of the tape transport and vacuum system to prevent damaging the tape. Because of the tension provided by the vacuum columns and the design of the tape path, tape was usually kept in sufficient contact with the relatively high-friction coating on the capstan that a pinch roller was not used.|$|R
5000|$|A plastic {{filament}} is <b>supplied</b> from a <b>reel,</b> either {{commercially available}} or home made, and fed into a heated liquefier {{where it is}} melted. This melt is then extruded by a nozzle while the incoming filament, still in solid phase, acts as a ‘‘plunger.’’ ...|$|R
50|$|The Teletype Model 28 RT Set is {{punched tape}} message and data relay set that receives, punches, prints, stores, reads and transmits five-level paper tape. The {{receiving}} unit accepts incoming electrical signals and punches and prints the intelligence on five-level paper tape. The sending unit reads and translates the taped intelligence into electrical impulses for transmission either cross-office or cross-country. The paper tape readers and punches can be geared at {{speeds up to}} 200 words-per-minute. Gears are also available for slower speed operation at 60, 75 or 100 words-per-minute. Optional three-speed gear-shift mechanisms are also available for manual speed change operation at speeds of 60, 75 and 100 words-per-minute. The tape handling unit contains a large capacity tape <b>supply</b> <b>reel</b> capable of storing up to 3000 feet of paper tape, an intermediate tape storage bin that handles approximately 100 feet of paper tape and a tape winder reel that will store 1000 feet of paper tape. The Model 28 RT Set, less cabinet, is 35 inches high, 8.5 inches wide and 20 inches deep and weighs 110 pounds. The Model 20 RT Set cabinet, which houses up to two RT Sets, is 60 inches high, 28 inches wide and 27 inches deep and weighs 300 pounds. The RT Set cabinets may be side mounted.|$|R
5|$|Joseph Sachs {{had also}} invented an {{electric}} fire engine vehicle {{consisting of a}} wagon on which a spring-supported platform held an electric motor which operated two rotary water pumps. The motor was <b>supplied</b> with a <b>reel</b> of electric cable {{and it could be}} regulated from either side of the vehicle.|$|R
5000|$|Where {{limited space}} is available, {{and a fresh}} water tank cannot be fitted, the machine will still retain its demand tank, {{but it will be}} fed from an outdoor [...] "garden" [...] water tap via a {{separate}} <b>supply</b> hose <b>reel.</b> This, of course, requires that the property has an external cold water tap, which can be hard to find on some commercial sites. However, by carrying a range of different fittings, a tap key (for taps that have their handle removed to avoid unwanted water usage), and enough hose on the reel, the cleaner will usually be able to handle this situation.|$|R
40|$|Magnetic tape {{recorder}} employs a single capstan for simultaneously driving the <b>supply</b> and take-up <b>reels</b> {{in such a}} manner that the tape passing between the reels is kept under a predetermined constant tension. This recorder operates with little power and is sufficiently rugged to withstand the severe stresses encountered in high-altitude balloon flight tests...|$|R
50|$|The main {{advantage}} of the RCA tape cartridge over reel-to-reel machines is convenience. The user {{is not required to}} handle unruly tape ends and thread the tape through the machine before use, making the medium of magnetic tape more friendly to casual users. In addition, since the cartridge carries both <b>supply</b> and take-up <b>reels,</b> the cartridge {{does not have to be}} rewound before the tape is removed from the machine and stored. Because of these conveniences, the RCA tape cartridge system did see some success in schools, particularly in student language learning labs.|$|R
50|$|The paper rolls were 120 ft long. A {{metal bar}} above the take-up reel allowed a {{finished}} plot {{to be torn}} off and removed. The drum would then be advanced using the manual controls and the fresh paper end taped to the take-up reel. The standard pen was a ball-point, but liquid ink pens were available, and typically used for higher quality plots intended for publication. Other paper stock could be taped to the drum if desired. A chart drive switch was provided {{to turn off the}} motorized paper <b>supply</b> and take-up <b>reels</b> for this purpose.|$|R
5000|$|A {{more recent}} {{development}} (which suits {{a small number}} of applications better) allows for induction sealing to be used to apply a foil seal to a container without the need for a closure. In this case, foil is supplied pre-cut or in a <b>reel.</b> Where <b>supplied</b> in a <b>reel,</b> it is die cut and transferred onto the container neck. When the foil is in place, it is pressed down by the seal head, the induction cycle is activated and the seal is bonded to the container. This process is known as direct application or sometimes [...] "capless" [...] induction sealing.|$|R
5000|$|Fly reels {{are often}} rated for a {{specific}} weight and type of fly line in combination with a specific strength and length of backing. For example, the documentation <b>supplied</b> with a <b>reel</b> may state that the reel can take 150 yd of 50 pound-test backing and 30 yd of fly line. An angler {{should be able to}} [...] "load" [...] the reel with the specified length of line and backing and still have sufficient room between the line and the spool's edge. As well, many modern reels are designed to take interchangeable spools. Such spools can be quickly switched, thus allowing an angler to change the type of line in a matter of minutes.|$|R
50|$|Modern {{professional}} recorders usually use a three-motor scheme. One motor with {{a constant}} rotational speed drives the capstan. This, usually {{combined with a}} rubber pinch roller, ensures that the tape speed does not fluctuate. The other two motors, which are called Torque Motors, apply equal and opposite torques to the supply and take up reels during recording and play back functions and maintain the tape's tension. During fast winding operations the pinch roller is disengaged and the take up <b>reel</b> motor is <b>supplied</b> with a higher voltage than the supply motor. The cheapest models use a single motor for all required functions; the motor drives the capstan directly and the <b>supply</b> and take-up <b>reels</b> are loosely coupled to the capstan motor with slipping belts or clutches. There are also variants with two motors, in which one motor is used for rewinding only.|$|R
