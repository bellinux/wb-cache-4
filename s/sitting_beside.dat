The remix video with Songz premiered two days later on Valentine's Day on BET's 106 & Park. Songz appears in both versions of the video, whereby he is seen modelling shirtless at a photoshoot, but only performs his verses in the remix video. Carey praised Songz for bringing something artistically different to the videos.|$|E
5|$|Co-produced by Phil Spector and {{featuring}} the latter's signature Wall of Sound {{in a live}} setting, the fundraiser album was delayed for three months due to protracted negotiations between Harrison and two record companies keen to protect their business interests, Capitol and Columbia/CBS. Besides the main performers, the musicians and singers on the recording include Badfinger, Jim Horn, Klaus Voormann, Alla Rakha, Jim Keltner, Jesse Ed Davis and Claudia Linnear. The box set's original packaging included a 64-page book containing photos from the concerts; the album cover, designed by Tom Wilkes, consisted of {{an image of a}} malnourished child <b>sitting</b> <b>beside</b> an empty food bowl.|$|E

25|$|The stone {{appears in}} several {{chapters}} of Edward Rutherfurd's novel, London (1997). In the second chapter {{we see it}} as the marker stone for all the roads in Roman Londinium, and also <b>sitting</b> <b>beside</b> the wall of the Governor's Palace as mentioned above as a hypothesis of its use or origin. It is seen again in the ninth chapter where the main family unit of the novel bring in the character of the foundling who is found propped up against it. The stone {{is one of the many}} central focus points in the novel that the author uses to tie the different time periods together.|$|E
25|$|Dionysus was {{exceptionally}} attractive. One of the Homeric hymns recounts how, while {{disguised as}} a mortal <b>sitting</b> <b>beside</b> the seashore, a few sailors spotted him, believing he was a prince. They attempted to kidnap him and sail him far away to sell for ransom or into slavery. They tried to bind him with ropes, but no type of rope could hold him. Dionysus turned into a fierce lion and unleashed a bear on board, killing those he came into contact with. Those who jumped off the ship were mercifully turned into dolphins. The only survivor was the helmsman, Acoetes, who recognized the god and tried to stop his sailors from the start.|$|E
25|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 13th century, in the year 1202, Richard de Morins, a canon of Merton, became prior of Dunstable, and with his election the priory entered upon the most interesting period of its history. From 1210 he took over as Dunstable's chronicler. He was evidently a man of very varied interests, and considerable capacity for affairs. Before he had been prior a year he was dispatched on the king's business to Rome; and it was probably owing to his influence that the lordship of Houghton Regis, with other gifts, were confirmed to the priory in 1203. So far as we know, he only went abroad once again, when he attended the Lateran council of 1215, and remained afterwards in Paris for a year to study at the University; but the annals show that he maintained all through his life a keen interest in the affairs of Europe and the East. In 1206 he was made a visitor for all the religious houses of the diocese of Lincoln (except those of the exempt orders), by the authority of the papal legate; in 1212 he was appointed by the pope to preach the cross in Bedfordshire, Hertfordshire and Huntingdonshire, and in the same year was commissioned to make an estimate of the losses suffered by the clergy and the religious in the diocese through the exactions of King John. In 1223 and 1228 he was made visitor to his own order, first in the province of York, and afterwards in the dioceses of Lincoln and Coventry; and last of all, in 1239, when he must have been quite an old man, he helped to draw up and submit to the pope an account of the difficulties between the Archbishop of Canterbury and his suffragans on the subject of visitation. During his term of office, in the year 1219, he secured the right of holding a court at Dunstable for all pleas of the Crown, and of <b>sitting</b> <b>beside</b> the justices itinerant at their visits to the town: a privilege which brought him into less happy relations with the townsmen, and may have helped to hasten their revolt against his authority in 1228. He also successfully established the right of his house to Harlington church in 1223. The priory was twice visited by Henry III. during the time of Richard de Morins: once after the siege of Bedford Castle, and again {{in the midst of the}} troubles connected with the burgesses, whom he attempted to pacify, at the prior's earnest request.|$|E

500|$|On January 9, 2010, the Pakistani {{television}} network AAJ TV showed a video {{that had been}} released by the Tehrik-i-Taliban. The video showed al-Balawi, <b>sitting</b> <b>beside</b> Hakimullah Mehsud, vowing to avenge {{the death of the}} Pakistan Taliban leadership: [...] "We will never forget the blood of our emir, Baitullah Mehsud. We will always demand revenge for him inside America and outside." [...] Hakimullah Mehsud replaced his cousin Baitullah Mehsud as the chief of the Tehrik-i-Taliban after Baitullah was killed by a U.S. drone attack. Al-Balawi's father confirmed that the video showed his son.|$|E
500|$|Poe {{regularly}} visited Virginia's grave. As {{his friend}} Charles Chauncey Burr wrote, [...] "Many times, {{after the death}} of his beloved wife, was he found at the dead hour of a winter night, <b>sitting</b> <b>beside</b> her tomb almost frozen in the snow". Shortly after Virginia's death, Poe courted several other women, including Nancy Richmond of Lowell, Massachusetts, Sarah Helen Whitman of Providence, Rhode Island, and childhood sweetheart Sarah Elmira Royster in Richmond. Even so, Frances Sargent Osgood, whom Poe also attempted to woo, believed [...] "that [...] was the only woman whom he ever loved".|$|E
500|$|Three years later, Alexandra blamed sixteen-year-old Olga, who was <b>sitting</b> <b>beside</b> her seven-year-old brother, {{for failing}} to control the misbehaving Tsarevich Alexei during a family dinner. The spoiled Alexei teased others at the table, refused to sit up in his chair, wouldn't eat his food and licked his plate. The Tsarina's {{expectation}} was unreasonable, said Grand Duke Konstantin Konstantinovich of Russia, a distant cousin of the imperial family. [...] "Olga cannot deal with him", {{he wrote in his}} diary on March 18, 1912. Court official A. A. Mossolov wrote that Olga was already seventeen, but still [...] "she had the ways of a flapper", referring to her rough manners and liking for exuberant play.|$|E

500|$|As soon {{as editor}} Julian Clarke began {{selecting}} shots for the film, they were color graded by EFILM's Tim Stipan {{to ensure that}} they matched with each other. Stipan colored the characters slightly differently, such as giving Deadpool a [...] "dark, modern touch" [...] and Colossus a [...] "particular vibrancy and substance". Clarke edited each scene focusing on humor, choosing between alternate takes of jokes. He removed jokes made after Vanessa is kidnapped because they felt inappropriately timed, and cut down other scenes with less jokes such as Wilson being tortured as they were [...] "too much. You took too long to recover [...] get back in the irreverent spirit of the movie.". During editing, a linear version of the film was produced. They decided to go with interweaving the timelines to balance the different serious and silly tones. A sequence removed from the film saw Wilson and Vanessa travel to Mexico looking for a cure after he turned down the recruiter. It was removed for pacing reasons, and was replaced with a short scene of Wilson <b>sitting</b> <b>beside</b> his window that was originally filmed to show him thinking about his diagnosis, but in the new context implies him re-thinking the recruiter's offer.|$|E
500|$|The video premiered on October 22, 2008. It is set by a pool, {{as well as}} in a mansion. It {{begins with}} Gaga {{emerging}} from the pool wearing a mirror masquerade mask and a black sleeveless latex bodysuit with a jagged shoulder pad, with two Great Danes beside her. She throws the mask aside and the song begins with a facial shot of Gaga singing it. Gaga wears a metallic sticker on her left cheek in this shot. Featured in the video are scenes of Gaga in a mansion and dancing poolside with her dancers in a turquoise leotard. Gaga attends a wild party where every man and woman tries their luck on a strip poker game. The party gets wilder when all the party's guests strip down to their underwear, dance around, and share kisses with each other. The video also features several white mannequins on her swimming pool deck. During the musical interlude before the [...] "I won't tell you that I love you" [...] hook, Gaga is shown in her trademark [...] "Pop Music Will Never Be Low Brow" [...] sunglasses while <b>sitting</b> <b>beside</b> the pool. The video ends with the head shot of Gaga singing the Mum-mum-mum-ma hook.|$|E
500|$|The video premiered on February 7, 2009 on CMT. The video commences with a close-ups of Swift's and Colletti's mouths as {{they speak}} via telephone. He begins, [...] "All I want is you. Do you love me?" [...] She affirms, and {{he asks for}} another chance. The video {{transitions}} to Swift sitting {{on the living room}} floor, next to a fireplace. She performs as she flashbacks to memories with Colletti. The two frolic on a brown couch and play with a deck of cards. The video then transitions to Swift and her friend having lunch at a restaurant, where Swift's friend informs her of Colletti's betrayal. The two converse and, then, Swift is seen walking on the streets during nighttime. She sees Colletti arriving at a house with groceries and, after staring at each other, a redheaded woman walks out of the house. In a panic, Swift runs away and the video transcends to the phone call, which commenced {{in the beginning of the}} video, with Colletti repeating, [...] "Will you give me another chance?" [...] A rapid flashback of cut-scenes is played and, after its conclusion, Swift denies his request, hangs up, and cries. Cut-scenes feature Swift and Colletti frolicking, Swift walking in the streets, and her <b>sitting</b> <b>beside</b> the fireplace. To date, the video has over 124 million views on YouTube.|$|E

500|$|According to the Hindu scripture Padma Purana, Brahma saw {{the demon}} Vajranabha (Vajranash in another version) {{trying to kill}} his {{children}} and harassing people. He immediately slew the demon with his weapon, the lotus-flower. In this process, the lotus petals fell {{on the ground at}} three places, where springs emerged creating three lakes: the Pushkar Lake or Jyeshta Pushkar (greatest or first Pushkar), the Madya Pushkar (middle Pushkar) Lake, and Kanishta Pushkar (lowest or youngest Pushkar) lake. When Brahma came down to the earth, he named the place where the flower ("pushpa") fell from Brahma's hand ("kar") as [...] "Pushkar". It is also said that the sacred Sarasvati River emerged at Pushkar as five streams. The three lakes were assigned their presiding deities as the Hindu Trinity Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva, respectively. When Brahma came down to the earth, he named the place where the lotus fell as 'Pushkar'. Brahma then decided to perform a yagna at the place, at the main Pushkar Lake. However, his wife Savitri (called Sarasvati in some versions) could not be present at the designated time to perform the essential part of the yagna. Brahma, therefore, married a Gujjar,a dominant agricultural race named Gayatri and completed the yagna with his new consort <b>sitting</b> <b>beside</b> him. However, when Savitri finally arrived at the venue, she found Gayatri sitting next to Brahma in her rightful place. Agitated, she cursed Brahma that he would be worshipped only in Pushkar. As a result of this, yagna performed in the presence of all the gods, it is said that a dip in the lake created at this place is credited with holiness, assuring salvation from all sins. It {{is now one of the}} five holiest centres of pilgrimage for Hindus.|$|E
500|$|The {{following}} track, [...] "Enjoy", a song {{concerning the}} links between sex and fear, has been considered as [...] "decidedly trippy", and [...] "Posts most abrasive track". NME described it in its 1995 review as, [...] "a dark and deranged techno thing". Over military drums and [...] "squalls of noise", Björk sings about [...] "her hedonistic tendencies". The orchestral interlude [...] "You've Been Flirting Again", like the previous track [...] "Enjoy", features [...] "mysterious or open-ended lyrics". They are an attempt to describe the nature of flirting, which is [...] "ambiguous and slippery"; the playfulness of the song's title contrasting with the [...] "weightiness" [...] of its words. [...] "Isobel" [...] is a string-laden, orchestral trip hop song, with a [...] "visually rich narrative". Craig McLean of The Face called the track [...] "Broadway on breakbeats". Various critics have discussed the song's distinctive tempo, with Pulse!s Tom Lanham comparing it to [...] "a camel making {{its way across the}} desert", and Rolling Stones Lorraine Ali writing that the song [...] "snakes along like a patient desert caravan". Conceived by Björk as [...] "part autobiography part storytelling", its lyrics concern Isobel, a woman magically born in a forest who finds people in the city [...] "a bit too clever for her", eventually retreating back to nature and sending them a message of instinct through trained moths. Inspired by South American literature—particularly Gabriel García Márquez—the track's lyrics discuss [...] "the duality between reason and emotions, between intuition and intellect"; in the singer's own words, [...] "asking how 20th century civilisation clashes with nature and, in places like Iceland and Thailand, people really believe they can have a TV remote control {{in one hand and a}} ghost <b>sitting</b> <b>beside</b> them".|$|E
