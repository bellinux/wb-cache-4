5|$|Geneticists {{often use}} viruses as vectors to {{introduce}} genes into cells {{that they are}} <b>studying.</b> <b>This</b> is useful for making the cell produce a foreign substance, or to study the effect of introducing a new gene into the genome. In similar fashion, virotherapy uses viruses as vectors to treat various diseases, as they can specifically target cells and DNA. It shows promising use {{in the treatment of}} cancer and in gene therapy. Eastern European scientists have used phage therapy as an alternative to antibiotics for some time, and interest in this approach is increasing, because of the high level of antibiotic resistance now found in some pathogenic bacteria.|$|E
5|$|The {{aviation}} industry had been <b>studying</b> <b>this</b> problem for some time. From the mid-1940s, {{there was much}} interest in using nuclear-powered aircraft in the bomber role. In a conventional jet engine, thrust is provided by heating air using jet fuel and accelerating it out a nozzle. In a nuclear engine, heat is supplied by a reactor, whose consumables last for months instead of hours. Most designs also carried {{a small amount of}} jet fuel for use during high-power portions of flight—take-off and high-speed dashes.|$|E

25|$|In the {{investigations}} on radiant heat in air {{it had been}} necessary to use air from which all traces of floating dust and other particulates had been removed. A very sensitive way to detect particulates is to bathe the air with intense light. The scattering of light by particulate impurities in air and other gases, and in liquids, is known today as the Tyndall Effect or Tyndall Scattering. In <b>studying</b> <b>this</b> scattering during the late 1860s Tyndall was a beneficiary of recent improvements in electric-powered lights. He also had the use of good light concentrators. He developed the nephelometer and similar instruments that show properties of aerosols and colloids through concentrated light beams against a dark background and are based on exploiting the Tyndall Effect. (When combined with microscopes, {{the result is the}} ultramicroscope, which was developed later by others).|$|E
25|$|Faced {{with limited}} amounts of {{existing}} relevant information from available sources {{upon which to}} base the aircraft's design, Miles turned {{to the field of}} ballistics instead. He had reasoned that, as it was widely known that bullets could attain supersonic speeds, aerodynamic properties that would enable an aircraft to be capable of becoming supersonic would likely to be present amongst such shapes. In particular, as a result of <b>studying</b> <b>this</b> design data, the emerging aircraft would feature both a conical nose and very thin elliptical wings complete with sharp leading edges. This contrasted against many early jet aircraft, which were furnished with round noses, thick wings and hinged elevators, resulting in these aircraft possessing critical Mach numbers that were below the speed of sound and thus were less suitable for research into high subsonic speeds (in dives) than the earlier Supermarine Spitfire with its thinner wings. In 1943, RAE tests conducted using Spitfires had proved that drag was the main factor that would need to be addressed by high-speed aircraft.|$|E

500|$|The term [...] "economic {{sociology}}" [...] {{was first}} used by William Stanley Jevons in 1879, later to be coined {{in the works of}} Durkheim, Weber and Simmel between 1890 and 1920. Economic sociology arose as a new approach to the analysis of economic phenomena, emphasizing class relations and modernity as a philosophical concept. The relationship between capitalism and modernity is a salient issue, perhaps best demonstrated in Weber's The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism (1905) and Simmel's The Philosophy of Money (1900). The contemporary period of economic sociology, also known as new economic sociology, was consolidated by the 1985 work of Mark Granovetter titled [...] "Economic Action and Social Structure: The Problem of Embeddedness". This work elaborated the concept of embeddedness, which states that economic relations between individuals or firms take place within existing social relations (and are thus structured by these relations as well as the greater social structures of which those relations are a part). Social network analysis has been the primary methodology for <b>studying</b> <b>this</b> phenomenon. Granovetter's theory of the strength of weak ties and Ronald Burt's concept of structural holes are two best known theoretical contributions of this field.|$|E
500|$|Differences between Hydnellum species {{tend to be}} more {{distinguishable}} {{in younger}} specimens. Fruitbody development is greatly influenced by environmental factors such as levels of rainfall, drying winds, and temperature. The blue tooth (H.caeruleum), for example, develops a deeper blue color when it grows during cooler autumn weather. [...] Optimal growth occurs during periods of frequent light rains and high humidity; if the habitat dries out, growth will stop, but may resume after further precipitation. This intermittent growth affects the fruitbodies of different species to variable extents, leading to large variations in form, surface texture, and color. The morphological variability of fruitbodies and the dependence of their appearance upon environmental conditions has made Hydnellum a difficult group to study. Canadian mycologist Kenneth A. Harrison, who described several new species from North America, noted [...] "he remarkable longevity of individual sporophores of many species and the changes in appearance that occur during the long period of their development have confused all workers <b>studying</b> <b>this</b> group." [...] For example, H.aurantiacum, initially white, becomes in turn shades of orange, rusty-brown, and brownish-black. Its fruitbody initially has a turbinate (cushion-like) shape with a lumpy surface, later becoming flattened to funnel-shaped with a smooth to corrugated surface texture.|$|E

2500|$|As a {{relatively}} complex virus, EBV {{is not yet}} fully understood. Laboratories around the world continue to study the virus and develop new ways to treat the diseases it causes.

Although many viruses are assumed to have this property during infection of their natural hosts, {{there is not an}} easily managed system for <b>studying</b> <b>this</b> part of the viral lifecycle.
