40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} synthesizing a supervisory control scheme for the <b>start-up</b> <b>procedure</b> of a distillation column. We use techniques from the areas of hybrid and discrete event systems theory to solve the problem: First, the detailed plant model is approximated by an automaton. Then, a discrete control scheme is generated for the abstract (automaton) model. By construction, the automaton behaviour covers the detailed model behaviour. Hence, the controller not only forces the abstraction but also the underlying detailed plant model to obey the specications.

An investigation of the emulsion polymerisation of styrene in an isothermal continuous flow stirred reactor has been carried out. The important phenomena of sustainable oscillations and large conversion overshoot after start-up have been studied. Experimental {{studies have shown that}} conversion, number of polymer particles, molecular weights, and all other related properties often oscillate widely with time, and a steady state was not always achieved. The effect of <b>start-up</b> <b>procedures</b> in continuous emulsion polymerisation reactors have not previously beer. investigated in detail. Different <b>start-up</b> <b>procedures</b> were studied to determine their effect on the behaviour of the reactor. The effects of the initial concentration of soap and initiator, and the initial reaction temperatures have been studied experimentally in relation to the mean residence time of the reactor. Changes in <b>start-up</b> <b>procedures</b> were found to have a significant effect not only on the transients before a steady state, but also on the ultimate state achieved. Evidence was obtained supporting the theory that monomer droplets can be a locus of initiation and propagation in emulsion polymerisation of styrene in a CFSR at high level of conversion. Two possible mechanisms have been proposed to explain the phenomena of the high levels of conversion in the CFSR.

40|$|The {{influence}} of the reaction start-up procedure on the oxidation of a polyol, methyl a-D-glucopyranoside, was investigated. Results were obtained from semi-batch experiments with Pt catalysts and molecular oxygen as oxidant. Three types of reaction <b>start-up</b> <b>procedures</b> were applied {{with respect to the}} pretreatment of the catalyst slurry: reductive, oxidative, and inert. The experimental results are described by a recently developed dynamic electrochemical kinetic model. The reductive start-up results in the highest initial catalyst activity, compared with the other <b>start-up</b> <b>procedures.</b> It was found that the catalyst needs pretreatment before the reaction is started, as inert start-up resulted in no catalytic activity at all. The formation of inactive platinum oxides (i. e., overoxidation) is the main cause of catalyst deactivation under oxygen-rich conditions, for a weak reducing compound, and is independent of the start-up procedure. It also appeared that the rate of overoxidation is lower in the absence of reaction, which could be modelled with the assumption that overoxidation needs free sites to take place. The mechanism of catalyst deactivation has been verified through intermediate catalyst reactivation. The model adequately describes this reactivation step...|$|E

40|$|The present work {{proposes a}} <b>start-up</b> <b>procedure</b> for a doubly-fed {{induction}} generator (DFIG) {{driven by a}} wind turbine. In the DFIG topology the stator is connected direct to the grid while the rotor is connected to a back-to-back converter. This structure requires some care during grid synchronization to avoid undesired overloads. The main goal of a <b>start-up</b> <b>procedure</b> {{is to reduce the}} stresses on the electrical and mechanical components during synchronization. In this work, it is achieved by equalization among the induced stator voltage, the voltage over the filter capacitor and the grid voltage. A phase-locked-loop (PLL) computes the grid voltage phase displacement required for the system control orientation and synchronization procedures. Previous to the starting-up, the output currents set-points of the grid-side converter and rotor-side converter are computed in order to produce the same grid voltage over the filter capacitors and on the stator terminals. The whole procedure is summarized in seven different steps: turbine acceleration by the pitch control, DC-link pre-charge; initialization of the filter current controllers; filter synchronization; DC-Link voltage adjust; rotor current controllers' initialization and stator synchronization.

Model predictions show that the overall conversion decreases with the increase of initial styrene content in the reactor, and is not affected by the degree of micromixing. However, for the nonazeotropic feed, the copolymer composition distribution becomes wider with the increase of initial acrylonitrile content in the reactor.

40|$|The {{performance}} of polymer electrolyte fuel cells (PEFC) depends on many different aspects: Besides the operating parameters, which influences on performance are mainly understood, {{the history of}} the fuel cell operation has an essential impact. This fact is reflected in the strong increase of the investigations of degradation processes. During long-term operation, the {{performance of}} polymer electrolyte fuel cells shows a continuous descent while the operating conditions remain the same. In an analogous manner, the start-up procedure of fuel cells and the conditioning of their components - especially of the membrane electrode assembly during to the start-up procedure - have also a significant influence on the cell performance, but are frequently neglected in these studies. Therefore, investigations of the start-up procedure, which are comparable to the degradation investigations, are necessary. During the corresponding start-up process the membrane is humidified for enabling a sufficient proton conductivity of the polymer electrolyte. Simultaneously, the first electrochemical operation leads to a closer connection of the different components of the MEA. The DLR has investigated the influence of different <b>start-up</b> <b>procedures</b> on the performance of a PEFC. The MEAs used in these experiments consisted of commercial Nafion membranes and electrodes from ETEK which were pressed together during the assembly of the cells. In this contribution the characterisation of different <b>start-up</b> <b>procedures</b> by in-situ methods like polarization curves and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) (at the end of each start-up procedure) will be presented. By means of these investigations two basic results can be proven: In comparison to a constant current at start-up, sequentially alternating operating points with increasing current densities yield higher performance {{at the end of the}} procedure. Thereby, an increase of the cell performance is coupled with a reduction of the time requirement for steady-state operation...|$|E
40|$|Starting up a fan or modifying its {{setting point}} either by {{rotational}} speed variations or blade angle changes, obviously results in new ventilation {{conditions in the}} network, which is, of course, {{the object of the}} operation. However, since transient phenomena may then occur, particularly in complex networks, there may be a need to simulate these situations prior to any action. This is all the more true, if we are dealing with a multiple interactive fan system. Simulations with a transient model have shown that the flow in certain airways could be temporarily reversed due to the pressure variations that reach both its ends with a different time lag. This phenomenon may cause dangerous situations to occur in cases of fire or outburst of methane. It is also true that the air flow could be reversed in secondary and less powerful fans, while still rotating in the normal direction. The study and the experimental investigation of the extension of the reverse flow characteristic is therefore justified from two points of view: • a numerical simulation model for transient flow conditions must be capable of handling temporary reversed flows, and thus have appropriate fan characteristic curves available over the entire operating domain; • while operating fans, reversed flows should be avoided or at least reduced. Therefore, the design of <b>start-up</b> <b>procedures</b> or real time control algorithms should take these phenomena into account. A particular interesting application is the operating of two fans in parallel. In order to investigate experimentally the characteristic curves of a fan under reversed flow conditions a small scale model was built. This facility was designed in such a manner {{that it was possible to}} carry out experiments concerning flow reversions and to try out sequential <b>start-up</b> <b>procedures</b> for two fans in parallel...|$|E
