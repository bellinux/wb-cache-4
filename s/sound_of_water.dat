The towline had apparently fouled on the aft sphere hatch and wrenched it open. With the <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> entering the aft compartment, Pisces III became inverted and began to sink back to the seabed. The aft sphere was now fully flooded. The additional weight of water now added over a tonne of extra weight to the submersible.|$|E

60|$|Then {{they led}} him to the hall, where Eric clothed himself and rested, and he sent back the thrall Jon to Coldback, bidding him tell Saevuna, Eric's mother, that he was safe. But he was {{somewhat}} weak all that day, and the <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>waters</b> roared in his ears.|$|R
60|$|She woke in {{the morning}} to a <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> dashed on a courtyard, to {{sunlight}} streaming through a lattice. She thought she was in a foreign country. And Skrebensky was there an incubus upon her.|$|E
60|$|Between us and {{the mouth}} of the gulley rose, or rather sank, a sheer precipice that was {{apparently}} three or four hundred feet in depth, and at its foot we could hear the <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>water.</b>|$|E
60|$|Drip! drip! drip! It {{was like}} the <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> {{dripping}} from a leak in a roof. It was directly under me, and, quick as thought, I knew the sound was made by my own dripping blood.|$|E

60|$|The {{four sides}} of the stockade had been manned by that time. Lingard, {{ascending}} the banquette, looked out and saw the lagoon shrouded in white, without {{as much as a}} shadow on it, and so still that not even the <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> lapping the shore reached his ears. He found himself in profound accord with this blind and soundless peace.|$|E
