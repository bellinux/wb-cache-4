40|$|Mathematical {{simulations}} {{are already}} frequently {{used for the}} design of <b>single-screw</b> <b>extruders</b> for plastics processing and have the advantage of saving not only time and personnel, but are also economical. In order to obtain simulation results for the feed section of <b>single-screw</b> <b>extruders</b> with a good accuracy, not only the friction coefficients but also the pressure coefficients (the quotient of radial and axial pressure) of plastic bulk materials must be determined. It is of great importance that the determination of these material indices is based on the real conditions of the extrusion process. With this background in mind, available measurement devices for the determination of pressure coefficients, coefficients of friction, and density of plastic bulk materials were used to set boundary conditions for calculations in this work. A measurement device was then developed, which determines the material indices of the plastic bulk materials in the dynamic state. Measurements on several plastic bulk materials show that with rising axial pressure the product of coefficient of friction and pressure coefficient decreases. On the other hand this product rises for all examined plastic bulk materials with increasing velocity. The influence of temperature on the product of coefficient of friction and pressure coefficient is substantially more complex. The dependence of the friction characteristics and the plastic bulk density on temperature, axial pressure, and velocity are determined by means of a statistical testing plan and a regression analysis, and can be quantified by a regression equation. The regression equations are used in a model, which describes the processes in the feed section of <b>single-screw</b> <b>extruders</b> in two dimensions...|$|R

40|$|Models {{to predict}} the {{evolution}} of the morphology of immiscible liquid-liquid systems and of solid agglomerates dispersion in <b>single-screw</b> <b>extruders</b> were adapted to compute global distributive and dispersive mixing indices. Using these indices, the direct assessment of the mixing ability of a given screw or a comparison of distinct screws becomes readily available. In the case of liquid-liquid systems, the degree of distributive mixing is computed from the extent of deformation of the individual drops, whereas the degree of dispersive mixing is determined by the reduction in drop size. For solid-liquid systems, distributive mixing is quantified by a normalized Shannon entropy, whereas dispersive mixing is defined from the extent of size reduction. The effect of material properties, operating conditions, and geometry of the screw and die is investigated. Finally, the indices are used to determine (via optimization) the operating conditions and the screw geometry that maximize the mixing efficiency.

40|$|Thermoplastic {{encapsulation}} {{has been}} extensively studied at Brookhaven National Laboratory`s (BNL) Environmental and Waste Technology Center (EWTC) as a waste encapsulation technology applicable {{to a wide range}} of waste types including radioactive, hazardous and mixed wastes. Encapsulation involves processing thermoplastic and waste materials into a waste form product by heating and mixing both materials into a homogeneous molten mixture. Cooling of the melt results in a solid monolithic waste form in which contaminants have been completely surrounded by a polymer matrix. Heating and mixing requirements for successful waste encapsulation can be met using proven technologies available in various types of commercial equipment. Processing techniques for thermoplastic materials, such as low density polyethylene (LDPE), are well established within the plastics industry. The majority of commercial polymer processing is accomplished using extruders, mixers or a combination of these technologies. Extruders and mixers are available in a broad range of designs and are used during the manufacture of consumer and commercial products as well as for compounding applications. Compounding which refers to mixing additives such as stabilizers and/or colorants with polymers, is analogous to thermoplastic encapsulation. Several processing technologies were investigated for their potential application in encapsulating residual sorbent waste in selected thermoplastic polymers, including <b>single-screw</b> <b>extruders,</b> twin-screw extruders, continuous mixers, batch mixers as well as other less conventional devices.

40|$|Extruders are a {{fundamental}} {{part of any}} extrusion or compounding line. <b>Single-screw</b> <b>extruders</b> are of general-purpose application, while intermeshing twin-screw machines have found special application niches, mainly because of their good mixing capabilities. When only small quantities of (expensive or experimental) materials are available, it is often necessary to extrude at small, laboratorial scales. In addition, the in-situ characterization of material structure and viscoelastic properties is essential for understanding the interplay between process parameters and the final properties of the extrudate. The aim of this work is to couple a novel small scale modular single / twin-screw extrusion system, with well-controlled outputs in the range 30 - 300 g/h, to a slit die able to perform in-line rheo-optical characterization. The mini-extruder is equipped with ports that allow sample collection or non-intrusive analysis to be performed along its axis at desired locations. Rheometrical functions such as shear viscosity and normal-stress differences can be measured simultaneously with small angle light scattering patterns or optical microscopy imaging. Both rheological and optical validations of the equipment are presented and a preliminary study of a model polymer blend is reported.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the mineral and antinutrient composition of extruded snack produced from different blends of high quality cassava and tigernut flour. The extruded snacks were produced using a <b>single-screw</b> laboratory <b>extruder</b> at constant feed moisture (27 %), screw speed (60 rpm) and barrel temperature (80 C).

Understanding of the complex mechanism of dispersion and exfoliation of the clay tactoids may allow us to better control the final morphology and the homogeneity of clay nanocomposites and thus their macroscopic properties. The first step we propose in this study consists of a multiscale' approach of the exfoliation state of the extruded polypropylene/montmorillonite nanocomposite. We used three extruders designs: a <b>single-screw</b> <b>extruder,</b> a twin-screw extruder, and an optimized-screw extruder with adapted shear. The rheological analysis, the WAXS diffractograms, and the TEM micrographs all show different nanocomposite morphologies. A statistical TEM image analysis methodology was developed to evaluate the different particle parameters (thickness, length, aspect ratio, interparticle distance). The results obtained show a correlation between the size of the tactoids and the shear intensity...|$|E
40|$|In this study, thermal, {{mechanical}} and fire retardant properties of silane-crosslinked low-density polyethylene (XLPE) containing ethylene-vinylacetate (EVA) copolymer, alumina trihydrate (ATH) and antimony trioxide (Sb 2 O 3) have been studied. Samples were prepared in a <b>single-screw</b> <b>extruder</b> and the silane type was vinyltrimethoxy silane (VTMOS). Incorporation of ATH and Sb 2 O 3 into polyethylene at sufficiently high loading introduces good fire retardancy expressed by {{limiting oxygen index}} (LOI). However, some tensile properties decreased. These limitations could be overcome by silane crosslinking. By incorporation of EVA into XLPE gel content increased and curing time decreased. Differential scanning calorimetric (DSC) analysis indicated the existence of two distinct melting endothermic peaks corresponding to two different crystalline phases. Results from mechanical properties showed that mechanical properties of XLPE/EVA blends improve by increasing EVA content up to 15 wt%...|$|E
