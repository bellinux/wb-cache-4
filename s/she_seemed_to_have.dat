25|$|On 17 March 1920, {{at the age}} of 23, {{while she}} was walking on a street with her mother, a delinquent youth struck her in the back with an iron bar for no {{apparent}} reason. As a result of that injury, she was confined to bed for three months. Although <b>she</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> recovered, and was able to move around for over a decade thereafter, the complications from that incident eventually confined her to bed for 28 years, from April 1934 to the end of her life.|$|E
25|$|After some {{search for}} the girl, I interviewed a nightclub dancer who had just scored in a small {{emotional}} part in a play that did not run (The Noose). <b>She</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> the quality I wanted, a sort of rough poignancy. She at once displayed more sensitive, easily expressed emotion than I had encountered since Pauline Lord. She and (Hal) Skelly were the perfect team, and they made the play a great success. I had great plans for her, but the Hollywood offers kept coming. There was no competing with them. She became a picture star. She is Barbara Stanwyck.|$|E

She has listed Jane {{as one of}} Soap Opera's forgotten characters, claiming her as a favourite out of the golden era of Neighbours. Cooper once described her as [...] "Seemingly mousey girl, who turned into a heartbreaker" [...] and opines that <b>she</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> liking for a [...] "succession of older men". Jane is referred to in Emily Barr's fictitious novel [...] "Out of My Depth", in which character Amanda is watching her on [...] Neighbours. Jane is mentioned in radio presenter Tony Horne tour guide book [...] "Hornes Down Under" [...] in which he states he was not excited about visiting the set of Neighbours because in his opinion nothing good happened after the departures of Jane and Mike.|$|E

500|$|While Leigh made Streetcar in 1951, Olivier {{joined her}} in Hollywood to film Carrie, {{based on the}} {{controversial}} novel Sister Carrie; although the film was plagued by troubles, Olivier received warm reviews and a BAFTA nomination. Olivier began to notice a change in Leigh's behaviour, and he later recounted that [...] "I would find Vivien sitting {{on the corner of}} the bed, wringing her hands and sobbing, in a state of grave distress; I would naturally try desperately to give her some comfort, but for some time she would be inconsolable." [...] After a holiday with Coward in Jamaica, <b>she</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> recovered, but Olivier later recorded, [...] "I am sure that... must have taken some pains to tell me what was wrong with my wife; that her disease was called manic depression and what that meant—a possibly permanent cyclical to-and-fro between the depths of depression and wild, uncontrollable mania. He also recounted the years of problems he had experienced because of Leigh's illness, writing, [...] "throughout her possession by that uncannily evil monster, manic depression, with its deadly ever-tightening spirals, she retained her own individual canniness—an ability to disguise her true mental condition from almost all except me, for whom she could hardly be expected to take the trouble." ...|$|E
500|$|After Thomas G. W. Settle's record {{flight in}} the Piccards Century of Progress, the balloon was again {{returned}} to the Piccards, who decided to fly it to the stratosphere on their own. Jean would concentrate on the science, while Jeannette would pilot the balloon. DeVorkin wrote that, [...] "Energetic and forceful, <b>she</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> {{a better chance of}} obtaining a pilot's license than Jean, who was preoccupied with restoring the gondola and balloon and convincing scientists to provide instruments to fly". She studied at Ford Airport in Dearborn, Michigan under Edward J. Hill, a balloonist and Gordon Bennett Cup winner, who agreed to serve as flight director for the Piccards' planned stratospheric flight. Henry Ford offered the use of his hangar and brought Orville Wright (with his brother Wilbur, inventor of the airplane and first human to fly a heavier-than-air powered aircraft) to observe a flight of Jeannette's in 1933. Her son Don was a crew member that day and shook hands with Wright, [...] "I was a little kid and he [...] attention to me." [...] On June 16, 1934, Jeannette flew her first solo flight. Later that year, the National Aeronautic Association made her the first woman licensed balloon pilot in the U.S. Auguste wrote to Jean in June 1934, [...] "Hopefully you will make your flight ahead of other competitors. It would be nice, if the name of Piccard through Jeannette, would once more be placed on the record list of the F.A.I." ...|$|E

2500|$|In early reviews, both Slate Dana Stevens and the Los Angeles Times Carina Chocano wrote {{articles}} {{claiming the}} film propagated sexist attitudes, a topic {{which was the}} primary focus of a Slate magazine podcast in which New York editor Emily Nussbaum said: [...] "Alison [...] made basically zero sense. She was just a completely inconsistent character.... she was this pleasant, blandly hot, peculiarly tolerant, yet oddly blank nice girl. <b>She</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> no actual needs or desires of her own...."

2500|$|Very {{few details}} survived about ʻAkahi's life. On September 28, 1840, American Protestant missionary Rev. Cochran Forbes complained about her {{adherence}} to the Roman Catholic faith. Forbes wrote in his journal, [...] "Akahi the head woman of Kealia with her husband is pleased with popery, {{because they do not}} require holiness of life as a test of communion. She will probably become a papist as she is unwilling to abandon her lusts." [...] Her former husband Kalanimoku had also been baptized a Roman Catholic but later joined the Protestant church. In 1841, she noted as the [...] "chief woman" [...] in Kealakekua, Hawaii and in 1845, she made a deposition in the case of Richard Charlton. <b>She</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> resided exclusively on the island of Hawaii with occasional trips to Honolulu.|$|E

[...] She took great umbrage at the fact that her nickname is short for [...] "Mrs. Bitch." [...] As a teen, she was raped and later gave birth to an autistic child who was put into the custody of his grandparents. Hardships in life made her significantly more willing to risk her life under fire since <b>she</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> nothing to lose.

2500|$|On December 5, 1995, the Church staffers {{contacted}} David Minkoff, a Scientologist {{medical doctor}} who twice prescribed McPherson Valium and chloral hydrate without examining her. They requested {{for him to}} prescribe an antibiotic to McPherson because <b>she</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> an infection. [...] Minkoff refused and stated that McPherson {{should be taken to}} a hospital and he needed to see her before prescribing anything. They objected, expressing fear that McPherson would be put under psychiatric care. Dr. Janice Johnson, a senior medical officer at Flag Land Base who was assigned to care for McPherson, stated that McPherson had been gasping and had labored breathing while en route. [...] However they passed a total of four hospitals along the way to their ultimate destination. When they arrived at Minkoff's hospital 45 minutes north of Clearwater, McPherson exhibited no vital signs. Hospital staff attempted to resuscitate her for 20 minutes before declaring her dead.|$|E

2500|$|Describing {{the show}} as {{simultaneously}} [...] "spellbinding, exhausting to watch and hugely slick" [...] and calling Knowles [...] "the planet's greatest superstar", Michael Cragg of musicOMH noted that the highlights included songs from the Sasha Fierce disc of the album. Caryn Ganz of Rolling Stone magazine praised the show, saying, [...] "She worked, and worked it relentlessly, never missing a note, a beat of choreography, or a chance to strike a pose, hold it, and be adored." [...] Jayson Rodriguez of MTV News, commented [...] "Through six outfit changes, bombastic ballads, high-energy singles and a daring high-wire journey from the stage {{to the center of}} the arena, Beyoncé delivered over and over again." [...] A writer of Billboard magazine noted that Knowles [...] "brought all the fierceness" [...] on stage for the tour. The Australians Patrick Emery noted that Knowles showcased her self-assurance and professionalism in [...] "full view" [...] further praising the [...] "carefully" [...] choreographed show. Comparing her performance with Michael Jackson's, Renee Michelle Harris of the South Florida Times writes, [...] " [...] owns the stage with her trademark swagger and intensity... showcasing her powerful vocals without missing a note, often while engaged in vigorous, perfectly executed dance moves...no one, not Britney, not Ciara and not Rihanna can offer what she does—a complete package of voice, moves and presence." [...] Tamara Hardingham-Gill of the Daily Mail awarded the performance five out of five stars and noted that Knowles' vocal abilities were showcased during the ballads of the show where she was [...] "note perfect throughout". She concluded her review by saying that although it was [...] "too early" [...] to compare Knowles with Michael Jackson, [...] "she certainly proved that she is one of the most exciting and talented performers around and may well go down in history as such." [...] Comparing her with Diana Ross and Tina Turner, Holly Burnes of The Daily Telegraph noted that Knowles proved she was the [...] "world's best female performed" [...] with her performance and added, [...] "Whether crumping, sweeping across the stage in towering heels, or simply standing still, Beyonce was dynamite, blasting the benchmark for concert performers forever... Good luck trying to follow that act whoever you are." [...] Simon Colling from The West Australian described the performance as [...] "powerhouse" [...] and added, [...] "Beyonce's high-energy, high-voltage mix of song (loud, commercial R) and dance recalled names like Tina Turner, Aretha Franklin and rapper Missy Elliott. Sometimes her booming vocals were so over the top <b>she</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> come down with a case of Mariah Carey syndrome." [...] Writing that there were [...] "ska, reggae, girlish pop, jazz, rap, soul, gospel, Middle Eastern, rock and body-thumping club remixes", Joanna Horowitz of The Seattle Times added, [...] "The only thing is, while she can wrap her voice and body around just about any style, she doesn't really have her own signature, at least musically. And while all the variety kept the concert interesting, it came off a little unfocused... But for a show that's as much about style as music, you gotta hand it to Beyoncé. The evening played out like a hip-hop Cirque du Soleil — sequins galore, dramatic dance numbers, and Beyoncé at one point soaring". The Observers Barbara Ellen wrote, [...] "she is a performer who can shape-change at will. Whether charismatic and soulful, or teasing and flirty, Beyoncé is, above all, in charge. Probably the most 'in charge' of any female artist I've seen onstage... she is a force of nature – delivering one of the most enjoyable well-paced shows I've seen in years." [...] However, she noted that Knowles is [...] "so steeped in professionalism that what should be magical can become mechanical."
