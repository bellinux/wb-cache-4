40|$|Background: The {{burden of}} rising health care {{expenditures}} {{has created a}} demand for information regarding the clinical and economic outcomes associated with Complementary and Alternative Medicines. Clinical controlled trials have found <b>St.</b> <b>John</b> 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>wort</b> to {{be as effective as}} antidepressants in the treatment of mild to moderate depression. The objective {{of this study was to}} develop a model to assess the cost-effectiveness of <b>St.</b> <b>John</b> 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>wort</b> based on this evidence. Methods: A Markov model was constructed to estimate health and economic impacts of <b>St.</b> <b>John</b> 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>wort</b> versus antidepressants. Outcomes were treatment costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and Net Monetary Benefits (NMB). Probabilistic analyses were conducted on key model parameters. Results: The average NMB across 5000 simulations identified <b>St.</b> <b>John</b> 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>wort</b> as the strategy with the highest net benefit. The total cost savings for SJW were 359. 66 and 202. 56 per individual for venlafaxine and sertraline respectively, with a gain of 0. 08 to 0. 12 QALYs over the 72 weeks of the model. Limitations: A lack of direct comparative clinical trial data comparing SJW to venlafaxine and limited data with sertraline as a comparator was a major limitation. Conclusions: In this model, <b>St.</b> <b>John</b> 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>wort</b> was shown to be a cost-effective alternative to generic antidepressants. Patients are more likely to receive treatment for a duration consistent with professional guidelines for treatment of major depression due to reduced incidence of adverse effects, improving outcomes.

40|$|Coral reef {{ecosystems}} of the Virgin Islands Coral Reef National Monument, Virgin Islands National Park and {{the surrounding}} waters of <b>St.</b> <b>John,</b> U. <b>S.</b> Virgin Islands are a precious natural resource worthy of special protection and conservation. The mosaic of habitats including coral reefs, seagrasses and mangroves, are home to a diversity of marine organisms. These benthic habitats and their associated inhabitants provide many important ecosystem services to the community of <b>St.</b> <b>John,</b> such as fishing, tourism and shoreline protection. However, coral reef ecosystems throughout the U. S. Caribbean are under increasing pressure from environmental and anthropogenic stressors that threaten to destroy the natural heritage of these marine habitats. Mapping of benthic habitats is an integral component of any effective ecosystem-based management approach. Through {{the implementation of a}} multi-year interagency agreement, NOAA’s Center for Coastal Monitoring and Assessment - Biogeography Branch and the U. S. National Park Service (NPS) have completed benthic habitat mapping, field validation and accuracy assessment of maps for the nearshore marine environment of <b>St.</b> <b>John.</b> This work is an expansion of ongoing mapping and monitoring efforts conducted by NOAA and NPS in the U. S. Caribbean and replaces previous NOAA maps generated by Kendall et al. (2001) for the waters around <b>St.</b> <b>John.</b> The use of standardized protocols enables the condition of the coral reef ecosystems around <b>St.</b> <b>John</b> to be evaluated in context {{to the rest of the}} Virgin Island Territories and other U. S. coral ecosystems. The products from this effort provide an accurate assessment of the abundance and distribution of marine habitats surrounding <b>St.</b> <b>John</b> to support more effective management and conservation of ocean resources within the National Park system. This report documents the entire process of benthic habitat mapping in <b>St.</b> <b>John.</b> Chapter 1 provides a description of the benthic habitat classification scheme used to categorize the different habitats existing in the nearshore environment. Chapter 2 describes the steps required to create a benthic habitat map from visual interpretation of remotely sensed imagery. Chapter 3 details the process of accuracy assessment and reports on the thematic accuracy of the final maps. Finally, Chapter 4 is a summary of the basic map content and compares the new maps to a previous NOAA effort. Benthic habitat maps of the nearshore marine environment of <b>St.</b> <b>John,</b> U. <b>S.</b> Virgin Islands were created by visual interpretation of remotely sensed imagery. Overhead imagery, including color orthophotography and IKONOS satellite imagery, proved to be an excellent source from which to visually interpret the location, extent and attributes of marine habitats. NOAA scientists were able to accurately and reliably delineate the boundaries of features on digital imagery using a Geographic Information System (GIS) and fi eld investigations. The <b>St.</b> <b>John</b> habitat classification scheme defined benthic communities on the basis of four primary coral reef ecosystem attributes: 1) broad geographic zone, 2) geomorphological structure type, 3) dominant biological cover, and 4) degree of live coral cover. Every feature in the benthic habitat map was assigned a designation at each level of the scheme. The ability to apply any component of this scheme was dependent on being able to identify and delineate a given feature in remotely sensed imagery...|$|R

In spite of these restrictions, the population of <b>St.</b> <b>John</b> has risen in {{the past fifteen years}} as has the number of tourists that visit the island.

The purpose of this thesis is to evaluate the extent of the effects of human developments on nitrogen loading of the bays on <b>St.</b> <b>John,</b> U. <b>S.</b> Virgin Islands. This is accomplished by taking nitrogen samples of the bays, using ArcGIS and the Nitrogen Loading Model to estimate the nitrogen loading of the bays, and correlating historical nitrogen concentrations with increases in population. While the analysis of nitrogen samples of the bays is inconclusive, the Nitrogen Loading Model estimates that bays with greater levels of development have higher amounts of nitrogen loading.

Methods Prospective clinical trials assessing the effect of <b>St</b> <b>John</b> 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>wort</b> (SJW) extracts on metabolism by CYP 3 A were identified through computer-based searches (from their inception to May 2005) of Medline, Cinahl, PsycINFO, AMED, Current Contents and Embase, hand-searches of bibliographies of relevant papers and consultation with manufacturers and researchers in the field. Two reviewers selected trials for inclusion, independently extracted data and recorded details on study design. Results Thirty-one studies met the eligibility criteria. More than two-thirds of the studies employed a before-and-after design, less than one-third of the studies used a crossover design, and only three studies were double-blind and placebo controlled. In 12 studies the SJW extract had been assayed, and 14 studies stated the specific SJW extract used. Results from 26 studies, including all of the 19 studies that used high-dose hyperforin extracts (> 10 mg day(- 1)), had outcomes consistent with CYP 3 A induction. The three studies using low-dose hyperforin extracts (< 4 mg day(- 1)) demonstrated no significant effect on CYP 3 A. Conclusion There is reasonable evidence to suggest that high-dose hyperforin SJW extracts induce CYP 3 A. More studies are required to determine whether decreased CYP 3 A induction occurs after low-dose hyperforin extracts. Future studies should adopt study designs with a control phase or control group, identify the specific SJW extract employed and provide quantitative analyses of key constituents...|$|R
40|$|Herbal {{medicines}} {{are often}} used in combination with conventional drugs, and this may give rise to the potential of harmful herb-drug interactions. This paper updates our knowledge on clinical herb-drug interactions with an emphasis of the mechanistic and clinical consideration. In silico, in vitro, animal and human studies {{are often used}} to predict and/or identify drug interactions with herbal remedies. To date, a number of clinically important herb-drug interactions have been reported, {{but many of them}} are from case reports and limited clinical observations. Common herbal medicines that interact with drugs include <b>St</b> <b>John</b> 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>wort</b> (Hypericum perforatum), ginkgo (Ginkgo biloba), ginger (Zingiber officinale), ginseng (Panax ginseng), and garlic (Allium sativum). For example, <b>St</b> <b>John</b> 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>wort</b> significantly reduced the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) and blood concentrations of cyclosporine, midazolam, tacrolimus, amitriptyline, digoxin, indinavir, warfarin, phenprocoumon and theophylline. The common drugs that interact with herbal medicines include warfarin, midazolam, digoxin, amitriptyline, indinavir, cyclosporine, tacrolimus and irinotecan. Herbal medicines may interact with drugs at the intestine, liver, kidneys, and targets of action. Importantly, many of these drugs have very narrow therapeutic indices. Most of them are substrates for cytochrome P 450 s (CYPs) and/or P-glycoprotein (P-gp). The underlying mechanisms for most reported herb-drug interactions are not fully understood, and pharmacokinetic and/or pharmacodynamic mechanisms are implicated in many of these interactions. In particular, enzyme induction and inhibition may {{play an important role in}} the occurrence of some herbdrug interactions. Because herb-drug interactions can significantly affect circulating levels of drug and, hence, alter the clinical outcome, the identification of herb-drug interactions has important implications...|$|R

We find that the chrysophaentins show similar activity against all S. aureus strains, regardless of their drug sensitivity profiles. The synthetic chrysophaentin fragments indeed mimic the natural compounds in their spectrum of antibacterial activity, and therefore represent logical starting points for future medicinal chemistry studies of the natural products and their analogs...|$|R

This information will be used while planning and managing facilities expansion. In addition to these physical attributes of the property and facilities Iowa State University desired a way of recording growing conditions to inform the design and manage of a school garden program. Geographic information systems (GIS) were evaluated as a possible solution to managing this spatially variable information. Using ArcGIS, Global Positioning System (GPS), data available from government agencies, and data collected on-site, we built a GIS for Gifft Hill School. In 2010, we collected and mapped environmental variation at candidate locations for school gardens. By mapping land cover and current and planned buildings, we determined the most suitable locations for initial school gardens using ArcGIS model builder and calculated site areas for budgeting purposes. We combined GIS and GPS to plan a trail through dense vegetation between the two Gifft Hill School campuses. The use of GIS to collect and manage information about the site and facilities {{has been successful in}} initial planning and construction activities...|$|R
40|$|Drug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus is a {{continuing}} public health concern, both {{in the hospital and}} community settings. Antibacterial compounds that possess novel structural scaffolds and are effective against multiple S. aureus strains, including current drug-resistant ones, are needed. Previously, we have described the chrysophaentins, a family of bisdiarylbutene macrocycles from the chrysophyte alga Chrysophaeum taylori that inhibit the growth of S. aureus and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). In this study we have analyzed the geographic variability of chrysophaentin production in C. taylori located at different sites on the island of <b>St.</b> <b>John,</b> U. <b>S.</b> Virgin Islands, and identified two new linear chrysophaentin analogs, E 2 and E 3.

The United States lacks a regulatory system for herbal products. Although only limited research on herbs has been published, <b>St</b> <b>John</b> 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>wort</b> shows promise as a treatment for depression. Ginkgo biloba extract is possibly effective for cerebrovascular insufficiency and dementia. Feverfew is used extensively in Canada for migraine prophylaxis but needs more rigorous study. Ephedrine has been regulated by many states because its misuse has been associated with several deaths. Echinacea is being tried as an agent for immune stimulation, and garlic is under study for cholesterol-lowering properties, but both require more study. Physicians should educate themselves and their patients about the efficacy and adverse interactions of herbal agents and the limitations of our present knowledge of them...|$|R
40|$|In {{recent years}} the use of herbal {{remedies}} has increased in western society, bringing withit {{an increase in the}} risk and frequency of adverse effects and interactions with conventional prescription and proprietary medications. Problems asociated with herbal remedies include lack of quality control, lack of government regulations regarding safety and efficacy, a paucity of clinical trials and inadequate information on adverse effects and drug-herbal interactions. This article discusses these problems in the context the historical evolution of botanical-source medications and reviews problems associated with specific herbals including those with serious toxicity such as ephedra, borage, coltsfoot and calamus, as well as those with demonstrated interactions with conventional drugs such as <b>St.</b> <b>John</b> 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>wort.</b> Mechanisms are discussed where known. Some two dozen individual herbs are tabulated with respect to their traditional use, pharmacological activity and potential for interactions.

40|$|Two {{billion people}} around the world do not access to clean {{drinking}} water. 98 % of deaths caused by water related illness occur in the developing world. The humidification dehumidification desalination system currently being developed at the Lienhard Research Laboratory is a water treatment technology with low operational requirements that make it ideal for operation in the developing world. Researchers in the lab have just developed a novel design methodology for optimizing the performance of an HDH system based on thermal balancing, similar to the methodology used in heat exchanger design. An experimental pilot sized unit was built to test this methodology on a packed bed humidifier. Non-dimensional entropy generation was shown to have a minimum value for varied mass flow ratio as well as for varied water inlet temperature. At its optimal performance condition, the humidifier built for this thesis has a temperature pinch of 2. 8 °C and an enthalpy pinch of 14. 8 kJ/kg dry air. For the first time in literature, this thesis has experimentally shown that the balanced condition of HCR= 1 corresponds to the condition of minimum entropy generation, validating the design methodology previously proposed at the Lienhard Lab. by Maximus Gladstone <b>St.</b> <b>John.</b> Thesis (<b>S.</b> B.)
