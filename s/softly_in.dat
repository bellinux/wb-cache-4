The soundtrack features 11 songs—most of which appeared in various scenes in the film—plus a piece from the film's score, [...] "Trouble In Woodsboro"/"Sidney's Lament", by Beltrami. The Alice Cooper version of [...] "School's Out" [...] appeared in the film following the closure of Woodsboro high school, but it was replaced with a cover version of the song by The Last Hard Men on the album.

500|$|The song's melody oscillates {{over the}} chords of C major and C diminished, a chord favoured by Harrison in his Indian music-inspired {{compositions}} for the Beatles. Acknowledging Harrison's {{statement that the}} tune is [...] "slightly Indian", Everett considers [...] "Blue Jay Way" [...] {{to be related to}} the ragas Kosalam and Multani. According to author Simon Leng, however, Harrison based the song partly on Raga Marwa. Following the inclusion of a raga-style introduction (or alap) in his previous Indian compositions, [...] "Love You To" [...] and [...] "Within You Without You", [...] "Blue Jay Way" [...] begins with a preview of the song's melody played <b>softly,</b> <b>in</b> free time, over the opening drone. Author Ian Inglis credits the song's incorporation of ambient drone, specifically its role in providing [...] "an anchorage point for vocal and instrumental improvisation", as one of the first examples of a musical device that soon became prevalent in the work of Fairport Convention, the Incredible String Band and other folk artists.|$|E

500|$|... (Holy), in {{contrast}} with other compositions of mass and Requiem where it is often illustrated with great vocal and instrumental forces (particularly Verdi's Requiem), is here expressed in extremely simple form. The sopranos sing <b>softly</b> <b>in</b> a very simple rising and falling melody of only three notes, which the male voices repeat, accompanied by arpeggios on the harp and a dreamy rising melody in the violins (sometimes just a solo violin). The pattern appears several times, with the melodies increasing in ambitus, and the volume reaching forte on [...] "" [...] (the highest). The orchestra changes tone, the dreamy accompaniment is replaced by firm and powerful major chords with a horn fanfare marked forte, and the male voices declare [...] "" [...] (praise in the highest). This is answered by the sopranos in diminuendo, and the music softens and reverts to the dreamy harp arpeggios that it began with as the violin melody floats upwards to the final note in E flat major and the full choir repeats,with the altos finally joining: [...] "".|$|E
500|$|... As {{she tries}} to sleep, Brahms's Lullaby plays <b>softly</b> <b>in</b> the background. She then levitates off her bed using her stomach muscles to move {{the top half of}} her body. Knowles said that the {{levitation}} shot was the hardest one as she had difficulties making her neck look straight. She added that the scene represents the nightmare and the white bird flying above her takes her into her dream, which unfolds after the screech of an electric guitar. Knowles is transported to a desert and several clouds are present in the background. She wears a black Roberto Cavalli dress and boots; as the music begins, her two backup dancers wearing Gareth Pugh pieces appear. The scene changes into a computer-generated sci-fi landscape where Knowles is inscribed with a circle and square in a similar fashion to Leonardo da Vinci's Vitruvian Man. The first chorus is brought in by a subtle glass-breaking sound effect as the sci-fi special effects disappear and Knowles appears in a silver one-shouldered mini dress on a white background. Accompanied by her backup dancers, she performs sophisticated, street and hip-busting dance moves.|$|E
500|$|Osborne {{describes}} the scenes that follow—Cavaradossi's interrogation, his torture, Scarpia's sadistic tormenting of Tosca—as Puccini's musical equivalent of grand guignol to which Cavaradossi's brief [...] "Vittoria! Vittoria!" [...] {{on the news}} of Napoleon's victory gives only partial relief. Scarpia's aria [...] "Già, mi dicon venal" [...] ("Yes, they say I am venal") is closely followed by Tosca's [...] "Vissi d'arte". A lyrical andante based on Tosca's act 1 motif, {{this is perhaps the}} opera's best-known aria, yet was regarded by Puccini as a mistake; he considered eliminating it since it held up the action. Fisher calls it [...] "a Job-like prayer questioning God for punishing a woman who has lived unselfishly and righteously". In the act's finale, Newman likens the orchestral turmoil which follows Tosca's stabbing of Scarpia to the sudden outburst after the slow movement of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. After Tosca's contemptuous [...] "E avanti a lui tremava tutta Roma!" [...] ("All Rome trembled before him"), sung on a middle C monotone [...] (sometimes spoken), the music gradually fades, ending what Newman calls [...] "the most impressively macabre scene in all opera." [...] The final notes in the act are those of the Scarpia motif, <b>softly,</b> <b>in</b> a minor key.|$|E

500|$|Adult males {{communicate}} with loud bellows—low pitched sounds that consist of snore-like inhalations and resonant exhalations {{that sound like}} growls. These sounds {{are thought to be}} generated by unique vocal organs found in koalas. Because of their low frequency, these bellows can travel far through air and vegetation. Koalas may bellow at any time of the year, particularly during the breeding season, when it serves to attract females and possibly intimidate other males. They also bellow to advertise their presence to their neighbours when they enter a new tree. These sounds signal the male's actual body size, as well as exaggerate it; females pay more attention to bellows that originate from larger males. [...] Female koalas bellow, though more <b>softly,</b> <b>in</b> addition to making snarls, wails, and screams. These calls are produced when in distress and when making defensive threats. Young koalas squeak when in distress. As they get older, the squeak develops into a [...] "squawk" [...] produced both when in distress and to show aggression. When another individual climbs over it, a koala makes a low grunt with its mouth closed. Koalas make numerous facial expressions. When snarling, wailing, or squawking, the animal curls the upper lip and points its ears forward. During screams, the lips retract and the ears are drawn back. Females bring their lips forward and raise their ears when agitated.|$|E

2500|$|For {{the next}} flight the Marine Corps {{recommended}} their representative, Major Chester L. Fordney, to join Settle as instrument operator (the experiments were vital to justify financing of the flight). Fordney himself [...] "was crazy for tying up with an adventurer like Settle". On November 20 they lifted off from the Goodyear-Zeppelin facilities in Akron, Ohio, watched by {{only a few hundred}} spectators. Nevertheless, the flight received national publicity as radio transmissions from the stratosphere were broadcast on radio networks. Century floated at peak altitude for two hours, and landed <b>softly</b> <b>in</b> Bridgeton, New Jersey marshes in the confluence of Delaware and Cohansey rivers, incidentally, a few miles from Jean Piccard's home. It was already dark, so Settle and Fordney spent the night in the chilling cold of the gondola. They dumped radio batteries during descent, so in the morning Fordney waded five miles through the swamp in search for help. The balloon's barograph, examined by the National Bureau of Standards, confirmed the world altitude record of 18,665 meters (61,237 feet). The flight earned Settle the Harmon Trophy and the FAI Henri de la Vaulx medal. Earlier in 1933 the USSR-1 had flown to 62,230 feet, but it was not recognized by the FAI, so Settle and Fordney became the official record holder until the flight of Explorer II in 1935.|$|E
2500|$|The {{score for}} the Scream series was {{provided}} by Marco Beltrami, starting with Scream in what was his feature film debut. Beltrami was brought onto the production of Scream after Craven's assistant Julie Plec requested input on the now defunct site [...] "Hollywood Cafe", asking for opinions on was [...] "new", [...] "fresh" [...] and [...] "wonderful" [...] and was provided with Beltrami's name by several people. Craven sent for samples of Beltrami's work and was impressed by what he heard, bringing him to the set to view the first thirteen minutes of the film featuring the introduction and murder of the character Casey Becker. Craven had Beltrami produce music based on this scene and then demonstrate it, impressing Craven enough to hire him. For Scream (1996), {{the decision was made}} to intentionally use music to raise the tension in scenes where it was unnecessary when the characters were entering a situation where the audience may expect a killer to suddenly appear, only to not deliver on that expectation, part of the film's theme of playing with horror conventions. Craven and editor Patrick Lussier provided Beltrami with advice on how best to deliver the music during scary and tense scenes as Beltrami had no prior experience in developing a horror score. Beltrami intentionally avoided conventional horror score styles and approached the film as a western, taking influence from Ennio Morricone, prolific composer of many western films, in the creation of Screams music. When scoring a theme for the character of Dewey, Beltrami approached him as a sheriff but also as a [...] "quirky" [...] character, using a Morricone-style guitar accompaniment to maintain the Western approach. An acoustic cover of Blue Öyster Cult's [...] "Don't Fear the Reaper" [...] plays <b>softly</b> <b>in</b> the background to Sidney and Billy's discussion of their relationship, which analyst Jeff Smith describes as ...|$|E
