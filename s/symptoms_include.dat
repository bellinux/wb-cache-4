5|$|Although the lilac-brown bolete {{was once}} {{considered}} edible, caution is typically recommended in modern field guides when considering this bolete {{for the table}} after several poisonings were reported in northeastern North America. <b>Symptoms</b> <b>include</b> severe gastrointestinal distress with vomiting, diarrhea, and nausea that generally lasts less than 24 hours.|$|E
5|$|Apart from headache, about 50% of {{patients}} experience neck pain or stiffness, nausea, and vomiting. Other <b>symptoms</b> <b>include</b> dizziness and vertigo, facial numbness or weakness, unusually blurry or double vision, neuralgia, fatigue, or a metallic taste in the mouth. Leaking CSF {{can sometimes be}} felt or observed as a discharge from the nose or ear.|$|E
5|$|Ethylene glycol {{poisoning}} is poisoning {{caused by}} drinking ethylene glycol. Early <b>symptoms</b> <b>include</b> intoxication, vomiting and abdominal pain. Later symptoms may include a decreased level of consciousness, headache, and seizures. Long term outcomes may include kidney failure and brain damage. Toxicity and death may occur even after drinking a small amount.|$|E

5|$|Excess {{intake of}} calcium may cause hypercalcaemia, {{but because of}} the inefficient {{absorption}} of calcium by the intestines a more likely cause is excessive vitamin D intake or excessive secretion of parathyroid hormone. It can also occur due to the bone destruction that occurs when tumours metastasise to bone. This results in deposition of calcium salts into the heart, the blood vessels, and the kidneys. <b>Symptoms</b> <b>include</b> anorexia, nausea, vomiting, memory loss, confusion, muscle weakness, increased urination, dehydration, and metabolic bone disease. Chronic hypercalcaemia may lead to soft tissue calcification, which can lead to serious consequences: for example, calcification of the vascular wall can lead to a loss of elasticity and the disruption of laminar blood flow, and thence to plaque rupture and thrombosis. Likewise, inadequate calcium or vitamin D intake results in hypocalcaemia, often caused by inadequate secretion of parathyroid hormone or defective receptors to it in cells. <b>Symptoms</b> <b>include</b> neuromuscular excitability, potentially causing tetany and defects in cardiac conduction.|$|E
5|$|Hypokalemia, a {{deficiency}} of potassium in the plasma, {{can be fatal}} if severe. Common causes are increased gastrintestinal loss (vomiting, diarrhea), and increased renal loss (diuresis). Deficiency <b>symptoms</b> <b>include</b> muscle weakness, paralytic ileus, ECG abnormalities, decreased reflex response; and in severe cases, respiratory paralysis, alkalosis, and cardiac arrhythmia.|$|E
5|$|In medicine, kitsunetsuki is a culture-bound {{syndrome}} {{unique to}} Japanese culture. Those {{who suffer from}} the condition believe they are possessed by a fox. <b>Symptoms</b> <b>include</b> cravings for rice or sweet adzuki beans, listlessness, restlessness, and aversion to eye contact. Kitsunetsuki is similar to but distinct from clinical lycanthropy.|$|E

5|$|Pain {{typically}} {{occurs when}} the stomach is empty, between meals {{and in the early}} morning hours, but it can also occur at other times. Less common ulcer <b>symptoms</b> <b>include</b> nausea, vomiting, and loss of appetite. Bleeding can also occur; prolonged bleeding may cause anemia leading to weakness and fatigue. If bleeding is heavy, hematemesis, hematochezia, or melena may occur.|$|E
5|$|The {{early signs}} of AML are often vague and nonspecific, and may be {{similar to those of}} {{influenza}} or other common illnesses. Some generalized <b>symptoms</b> <b>include</b> fever, fatigue, weight loss or loss of appetite, shortness of breath, anemia, easy bruising or bleeding, petechiae (flat, pin-head sized spots under the skin caused by bleeding), bone and joint pain, and persistent or frequent infections.|$|E
5|$|A katipo bite {{produces}} the toxic syndrome latrodectism; <b>symptoms</b> <b>include</b> extreme pain and, potentially, hypertension, seizure, or coma. Bites are rare, an antivenom is available, and no deaths {{have been reported}} since 1901. The katipo is particularly notable in New Zealand as the nation is almost entirely devoid of dangerous native wildlife; this unique status means the spider is well known, despite being rarely seen.|$|E

5|$|Asthma is {{a common}} {{long-term}} inflammatory disease of the airways of the lungs. It is characterized by variable and recurring symptoms, reversible airflow obstruction, and bronchospasm. <b>Symptoms</b> <b>include</b> episodes of wheezing, coughing, chest tightness, and shortness of breath. These episodes may occur {{a few times a}} day or a few times per week. Depending on the person, they may become worse at night or with exercise.|$|E
5|$|Cholangitis can be life-threatening, and is {{regarded}} as a medical emergency. Characteristic <b>symptoms</b> <b>include</b> yellow discoloration of the skin or whites of the eyes, fever, abdominal pain, and in severe cases, low blood pressure and confusion. Initial treatment is with intravenous fluids and antibiotics, but there is often an underlying problem (such as gallstones or narrowing in the bile duct) for which further tests and treatments may be necessary, usually in the form of endoscopy to relieve obstruction of the bile duct. The word is from Greek chol-, bile + ang-, vessel + -itis, inflammation.|$|E
5|$|Diagnosis of a {{pneumothorax}} {{by physical}} examination alone {{can be difficult}} (particularly in smaller pneumothoraces). A chest X-ray, computed tomography (CT) scan, or ultrasound is usually used to confirm its presence. Other conditions that can result in similar <b>symptoms</b> <b>include</b> a hemothorax (buildup {{of blood in the}} pleural space), pulmonary embolism, and heart attack. A large bullae may look similar on a chest X-ray.|$|E

5|$|Endometrial {{cancer is}} a cancer that arises from the {{endometrium}} (the lining of the uterus or womb). It {{is the result of}} the abnormal growth of cells that have the ability to invade or spread to other parts of the body. The first sign is most often vaginal bleeding not associated with a menstrual period. Other <b>symptoms</b> <b>include</b> pain with urination, pain during sexual intercourse, or pelvic pain. Endometrial cancer occurs most commonly after menopause.|$|E
5|$|In a fatal attack, however, it manifests very quickly. In {{a number}} of cases, death has {{occurred}} within 24 hours of {{the onset of the}} infection, while other cases do not last longer than around five days. The virus attacks endothelial cells, rupturing capillaries and causing blood loss and haemorrhaging; once this reaches the heart, the haemorrhage kills quickly through shock. <b>Symptoms</b> <b>include</b> lethargy and an unwillingness to eat, a rapid heartbeat, and decreased blood-cell count, as well as cyanosis of the tongue, mouth ulcers, and oedema of the head and trunk.|$|E
5|$|Like other {{spitting}} cobras, {{this species}} {{is known for}} its ability to project venom at a potential threat. The venom is an irritant to the skin and eyes. If it enters the eyes, <b>symptoms</b> <b>include</b> extreme burning pain, loss of coordination, partial loss of vision, and permanent blindness. N. nigricollis {{is known for its}} tendency to liberally spit venom and bite with only the slightest provocation.|$|E
