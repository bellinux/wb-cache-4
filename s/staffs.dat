5|$|During the Polish–Soviet War (1919–1921), {{some one}} hundred Russian ciphers were {{broken by a}} sizable cadre of Polish cryptologists who {{included}} army Lieutenant Jan Kowalewski and three world-famous professors of mathematics — Stefan Mazurkiewicz, Wacław Sierpiński and Stanisław Leśniewski. Russian army <b>staffs</b> were still following the same disastrously ill-disciplined signals-security procedures as had Tsarist army <b>staffs</b> during World War I, to the decisive advantage of their German enemy. As a result, during the Polish-Soviet War the Polish military were regularly kept informed by Russian signals stations about the movements of Russian armies and their intentions and operational orders.|$|E

30|$|The {{objective}} of the simulation study is to compare different <b>staff</b> mix scenarios and evaluate them against the performance measures.

Considering <b>staffing</b> cost is important because <b>staffing</b> cost directly affects financial performance and sustainability. The <b>staff</b> utilization level also affects the quality of care. As reported in Rose et al. (2012), adequate <b>staff</b> and <b>staff</b> support improves the performance of ACCs.|$|R

They regularly attacked supply convoys heading for Jerusalem. At that time, neither the Israeli nor Jordanian military <b>staffs</b> had prepared for the strategic importance of the place.|$|E
