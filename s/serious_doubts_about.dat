5|$|Critical {{reception}} of the show was good to average, with a general appreciation for the realistic portrayal of Middle America. Generally speaking, however, there were <b>serious</b> <b>doubts</b> <b>about</b> whether the show {{would be able to}} stay on the air very long, though it has since gone on to complete five seasons. The episode's viewership of just over seven million was characterized as disappointing, though it did relatively well among men aged 18 to 34.|$|E

Nominee Robert Leffingwell, a darling of liberals, {{is viewed by}} many conservative senators as an appeaser. Others, including the pivotal character of Senator Seabright (Seab) Cooley of South Carolina, have <b>serious</b> <b>doubts</b> <b>about</b> Leffingwell's character.

25|$|However, {{there are}} <b>serious</b> <b>doubts</b> <b>about</b> the used methods and the {{interpretation}} of the results, especially the use of 0.5 as cut-off point for the effect-size. A complete reanalysis and recalculation based on the same FDA data discovered that the Kirsch study suffered from important flaws in the calculations. The authors concluded that although {{a large percentage of the}} placebo response was due to expectancy, this was not true for the active drug. Besides confirming drug effectiveness, they found that the drug effect was not related to depression severity.|$|E
25|$|The already-strained {{relationship}} with Ray Saidel in New Hampshire was finally broken during negotiations between Saidel and TVR in May 1959. Derek Harris, the TVR chairman, attempted to pressure Saidel into purchasing fifty cars per year (rather than the previously agreed upon twenty-five.) Saidel {{walked out of}} the negotiations and made it clear {{in a letter to the}} factory, dated 18 June, that he felt TVR's expectations to be extremely unrealistic. By July 1959, the situation at TVR was dire; there were significant inconsistencies in pricing and in financial recordkeeping, stocks of components were not being properly managed, the factory did not employ enough skilled workers, and there were <b>serious</b> <b>doubts</b> <b>about</b> the capability of the company's leadership.|$|E

50|$|Some {{have claimed}} {{that as many as}} 39 executions have been carried out in the face of {{compelling}} evidence of innocence or <b>serious</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>about</b> guilt in the US from 1992 through 2004. Newly available DNA evidence prevented the pending execution of more than 15 death row inmates during the same period in the US, but DNA evidence is only available in a fraction of capital cases. As of 2010, 139 prisoners on death row have been exonerated by DNA or other evidence, which is seen as an indication that innocent prisoners have almost certainly been executed.|$|R
25|$|More than a {{month after}} the {{groundwater}} contamination was discovered, TEPCO started to contain the radioactive groundwater. They assumed that the radioactivity had escaped early {{in the beginning of the}} disaster in 2011, but NRA experts had <b>serious</b> <b>doubts</b> <b>about</b> their assumption. According to them, other sources could not be excluded. Numerous pipes were running everywhere on the reactor grounds to cool the reactors and decontaminate the water used, and leaks could be anywhere. TEPCO's solution resulted in redirection of the groundwater flows, which could have spread the radioactive contamination further. Besides that, TEPCO had plans for pumping groundwater. At that time the turbine buildings of units 2 and 3 contained 5000 and 6000 cubic meters of radioactive water. With wells in contact with the turbine-buildings, this could spread the radioactivity into the ground. The NRA announced that it would form a task force to find the leaks and to block the flow of the groundwater to the coastline, because the NRA suspected that the groundwater was leaking into the sea.|$|E
500|$|The {{popularity}} of The Adventures of Robin Hood brought deHavilland {{a new level}} of fame as a movie star, but this new status was not reflected in her subsequent film assignments at Warner Bros. Her next several roles were more routine and less challenging. In the romantic comedy Four's a Crowd (1938), she played Lorri Dillingwell, a [...] rich girl being romanced by a conniving public relations man looking to land an account with her eccentric grandfather. In Ray Enright's romantic comedy Hard to Get (1938), she played another dizzy rich girl, Margaret Richards, whose desire to exact revenge on a gas station attendant leads to her own comeuppance. While deHavilland was certainly capable of playing these kinds of characters, her personality was better suited to stronger and more dramatic roles, according to Judith Kass. By this time, deHavilland had <b>serious</b> <b>doubts</b> <b>about</b> her career at Warner Bros.|$|E
500|$|Freyberg and Blamey {{also had}} <b>serious</b> <b>doubts</b> <b>about</b> the {{feasibility}} of the operation but failed to express their reservations and apprehensions. The campaign caused a furore in Australia, when it became known that when General Blamey received his first warning of the move to Greece on 18 February 1941, he was worried but had not informed the Australian Government. He {{had been told by}} Wavell that Prime Minister Menzies had approved the plan. The proposal had been accepted by a meeting of the War Cabinet in London at which Menzies was present but the Australian Prime Minister had been told by Churchill that both Freyberg and Blamey approved of the expedition. On 5 March, in a letter to Menzies, Blamey said that [...] "the plan is, of course, what I feared: piecemeal dispatch to Europe" [...] and the next day he called the operation [...] "most hazardous". Thinking that he was agreeable, the Australian Government had already committed the Australian Imperial Force to the Greek Campaign.|$|E
2500|$|Mathematical papers {{about the}} Riemann {{hypothesis}} {{tend to be}} cautiously noncommittal about its truth. Of authors who express an opinion, most of them, such as [...] or , imply that they expect (or at least hope) that it is true. The few authors who express <b>serious</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>about</b> it include [...] who lists some reasons for being skeptical, and [...] who flatly states that he believes it is false, {{and that there is}} no evidence whatever for it and no imaginable reason that it would be true. The consensus of the survey articles ( [...] , , and [...] ) is that the evidence for it is strong but not overwhelming, so that while it is probably true there is some reasonable <b>doubt</b> <b>about</b> it.|$|R

Surprisingly, Kingsfield agrees with his assessment and invites him to sit back down, which he does. Brooks makes an unsuccessful suicide attempt and drops out of school. The study group is torn apart by personal bickering. With final exams looming, Hart and Ford prepare feverishly {{in a hotel room}} for three days.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} and critiques the Australian Federal Government's {{efforts to}} put pressure on universities to increase the links between business and universities and to adopt more business practices. Examination of the 1992 and 1993 World Competitiveness Reports reveal ratings which cast <b>serious</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>about</b> the effectiveness of Australian business and industry. The 1991 Australian Mission on Management Skills Report substantially challenges the appropriateness of practices in Australian management and management training. However problems which have been identified are 1;kely to be neglected in an economic upturn. It is argued that Australian government policies encouraging wide adoption of business practices and values reflect the short term planning strategies characteristic of English speaking countries and the inability of government and business leaders in these countries to remedy thei...|$|R
500|$|Secrets reveal {{themselves}} steadily {{throughout the}} episode. Xander fears that his future marriage will turn {{him into an}} argumentative drunk like his father. He attempts to avoid his fears through the song [...] "I'll Never Tell", singing [...] "'coz there's nothing to tell", after summoning Sweet to Sunnydale to show him that he and Anya will be happy. Amid the various annoyances Xander and Anya express through this song, some verses are clear-sighted observations of behavior, such as Anya's accusation that Xander—once in love with Buffy—uses Buffy as a mother figure to hide behind. Anya also avoids the truth by burying herself in wedding plans without thinking critically about what being married will entail; instead she considers Xander an accessory to her desired lifestyle. Of all the characters, Anya is the most preoccupied with the style of singing and songs, demanding to know if Spike sang [...] "a breakaway pop hit, or a book number", and asking Dawn if the pterodactyl she facetiously says {{she gave birth to}} also broke into song. Anya and Xander's duet is the only song in the episode to address the audience directly. During the long single-shot scene when she and Xander talk over each other insisting to Giles that evil must be at play, Anya refers to the audience, saying [...] "It was like we were being watched... Like there was a wall missing ... in our apartment... Like there were only three walls and not a fourth wall." [...] Albright asserts that Anya's constant preoccupation with her and others' performances indicates that she has <b>serious</b> <b>doubts</b> <b>about</b> her future supporting role as Xander's wife.|$|E

40|$|This article {{investigates the}} {{importance}} of the endogenous selection of partners for trust and cooperation in market exchange situations, where there is information asymmetry between investors and trustees. We created an experimental-data driven agent-based model where the endogenous link between interaction outcome and social structure formation was examined starting from heterogeneous agent behaviour. By testing various social structure configurations, we showed that dynamic networks lead to more cooperation when agents can create more links and reduce exploitation opportunities by free riders. Furthermore, we found that the endogenous network formation was more important for cooperation than the type of network. Our results cast <b>serious</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>about</b> the static view of network structures on cooperation and can provide new insights into market efficiency...|$|R
50|$|The long {{half-life}} of {{the product}} initiated first chemical experiments on the gas phase atomic chemistry of copernicium. In 2000, Yuri Yukashev in Dubna repeated the experiment {{but was unable to}} observe any spontaneous fission events with half-life of 5 minutes. The experiment was repeated in 2001 and an accumulation of eight fragments resulting from spontaneous fission were found in the low-temperature section, indicating that copernicium had radon-like properties. However, there is now some <b>serious</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>about</b> the origin of these results. To confirm the synthesis, the reaction was successfully repeated by the same team in January 2003, confirming the decay mode and half-life. They were also able to calculate an estimate of the mass of the spontaneous fission activity to ~285, lending support to the assignment.|$|R

Others have been released on the basis of weak cases against them, sometimes involving prosecutorial misconduct; resulting in acquittal at retrial, charges dropped, or innocence-based pardons. The Death Penalty Information Center (U.S.) has published a list of 10 inmates [...] "executed but possibly innocent". At least 39 executions are claimed to have been carried out in the U.S. in the face of evidence of innocence or <b>serious</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>about</b> guilt.|$|R
2500|$|Concerns {{about the}} economy and {{efficiency}} of Manitoba Hydro's development program led the provincial government to form a commission of inquiry in 1977.

5000|$|Other {{accounts}} suggest Punjabi Kshatriya origins for the Shahi dynasty. Xuanzang clearly {{describes the}} ruler of Kapisa/Kabul, whom he had personally met, as a devout Buddhist and a Kshatriya and not a Tu-kiue/Tu-kue (Turk). [...] The fact that Xuanzang (AD 644) specifically describes {{the ruler of}} Kapisa as Kshatriya, and that of Zabul at this time being known as Shahi casts <b>serious</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>about</b> the speculated connections of the first Shahis of Kabul/Kapisa to the Kushanas or the Hephthalites. Neither the Kushanas, the Hunas/Hephthalites nor the Turks (or Turushkas) have ever been designated or classified as Kshatriyas in any ancient Indian tradition. Therefore, {{the identification of the}} first line of Shahi kings of Kapisa/Kabul with the Kushanas, Hunas, or Turks obviously seems to be in gross error.|$|R
