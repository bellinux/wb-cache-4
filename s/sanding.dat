5|$|The {{first batch}} of twenty {{locomotives}} was ordered in April 1941, although {{the changes in}} design to the Light Pacific arrangement meant that production was delayed until late 1944. Due to wartime contract work at Brighton works, the boilers were built under contract at the North British Locomotive Company. Before {{the first of the}} class had been delivered, the order was increased to thirty, with a second batch of ten ordered in September 1944. Deliveries from Brighton works began in May 1945 with prototype No. 21C101 Exeter, and proceeded at the rate of about two locomotives per month. The class was gradually run in on the Central Section until October 1945, when they were successfully trialled on Plymouth and Kentish services. By the time the first fifteen had entered traffic a further order of fifteen was placed, with these entering service between June and October 1946. From this batch onwards, traction was improved by the addition of steam <b>sanding</b> to the front driving wheel, with covers added to protect the motion from sand falling from the filler pipes.|$|E
5|$|Some lead {{compounds}} are colorful {{and are used}} widely in paints, and lead paint is a major route of lead exposure in children. A study conducted in 1998–2000 found that 38 million housing units in the US had lead-based paint, down from a 1990 estimate of 64 million. Deteriorating lead paint can produce dangerous lead levels in household dust and soil. Deteriorating lead paint and lead-containing household dust are the main causes of chronic lead poisoning. The lead breaks down into the dust and since children {{are more prone to}} crawling on the floor, it is easily ingested. Many young children display pica, eating things that are not food. Even a small amount of a lead-containing product such as a paint chip or a sip of glaze can contain tens or hundreds of milligrams of lead. Eating chips of lead paint presents a particular hazard to children, generally producing more severe poisoning than occurs from dust. Because removing lead paint from dwellings, e.g. by <b>sanding</b> or torching creates lead-containing dust and fumes, it is generally safer to seal the lead paint under new paint (excepting moveable windows and doors, which create paint dust when operated). Alternately, special precautions must be taken if the lead paint is to be removed. In oil painting it was once common for colours such as yellow or white to be made with lead carbonate. Lead white oil colour was the main white of oil painters until superseded by compounds containing zinc or titanium in the mid-20th century. It is speculated that the painter Caravaggio and possibly Francisco Goya and Vincent Van Gogh had lead poisoning due to overexposure or carelessness when handling this colour.|$|E

25|$|Once {{the wood}} surface is {{prepared}} and stained, the finish is applied. It usually consists of several coats of wax, shellac, drying oil, lacquer, varnish, or paint, and each coat is typically followed by <b>sanding.</b>|$|E
25|$|Glue smears and {{droplets}} {{are sometimes}} present around the joints of furniture. They {{can be removed}} {{using a combination of}} scraping, scrubbing and <b>sanding.</b> These approaches remove surface glue, but not the glue beneath the wood surface. Sub-surface glue will reduce the absorption of stain by wood, and may alter the scratch pattern created by <b>sanding.</b> Both these effects will influence {{the way in which the}} wood colours when stains are used to finish the wood. To overcome this problem it may be necessary to locally stain and touch-up areas previously covered by glue to ensure that the finish on such areas matches that of the surrounding wood.|$|E

Flexibility and strength are essential with willow, allowing Lowe to bend and manipulate the wood to his needs.|$|E
25|$|Many common {{building}} materials used before 1975 contain asbestos, such as some floor tiles, ceiling tiles, shingles, fireproofing, heating systems, pipe wrap, taping muds, mastics, and other insulation materials. Normally, significant releases of asbestos fiber {{do not occur}} unless the {{building materials}} are disturbed, such as by cutting, <b>sanding,</b> drilling, or building remodelling. Removal of asbestos-containing materials is not always optimal because the fibers can be spread into the air during the removal process. A management program for intact asbestos-containing materials is often recommended instead.|$|E

30|$|Now {{coming to}} the effect of {{gradation}} of <b>sand</b> on the strength, it can be seen for any type of clay used in this study, the gradation of <b>sand</b> has shown a significant influence on the strength of clay–sand mixture at any percentage of <b>sand.</b> The gradation effect is prominently seen with natural clay–sand series rather than artificial clay–sand series. It can be further observed from the figures that maximum strength at the optimum level of clay–sand combination, clay-medium <b>sand</b> mixtures have shown to have maximum strength, followed by clay-fine <b>sand</b> and clay-coarse <b>sand</b> mixtures. An exception to this behavior is only kaolinite-sand series, where clay–coarse <b>sand</b> series has shown higher strength when compared to medium and fine <b>sand</b> series. This may be explained based on the observations reported by Prakasha and Chandrasekaran [8], that inclusion of <b>sand</b> grains in a clay matrix leads to an increase in pore pressure resulting in a decrease in undrained shear strength. Probably, in the presence of lesser quantity coarse <b>sand</b> fractions in pure kaolinite clay, the pore pressures developed may be less compared that of medium <b>sand</b> and fine <b>sand.</b> However, at optimum <b>sand</b> content, kaolinite- medium <b>sand</b> has shown to have higher strength than kaolinite clay-coarse <b>sand.</b> More detailed studies may throw light on this aspect of clay–sand interactions with different grades of <b>sand.</b> Further, it was observed that, {{it was not possible to}} prepare clay-coarse <b>sand</b> specimens when the <b>sand</b> content was above 60 %, except in the case of bentonite-coarse <b>sand</b> series. Hence, the results could not be obtained for those percentages of <b>sand</b> i.e., 70 and 80 % <b>sand.</b> It is to be noted that, since this was a preliminary attempt to understand the effect of gradation of <b>sand</b> clearly, this study was restricted to use of individual grades of <b>sand</b> and not in combination.|$|R

25|$|<b>Sanding</b> of {{the bowling}} ball surface was another {{technique}} {{to soften the}} ball's surface. Once the track area {{is located on the}} ball, the bowler would sand the track area to make the surface more abrasive, allowing the ball to hook more. And, bowlers would apply solvents to the ball's surface during tournament play—rubbing the chemicals into the cover using a rag. More rules by the ABC had to be passed, including restrictions from doctoring the bowling ball's surface at any time once the ball has passed inspection by an official.|$|E
25|$|Hazards {{to health}} and safety also exist from {{post-processing}} activities done to finish parts {{after they have been}} printed. These post-processing activities can include chemical baths, <b>sanding,</b> polishing, or vapor exposure to refine surface finish, as well as general subtractive manufacturing techniques such as drilling, milling, or turning to modify the printed geometry. Any technique that removes material from the printed part has the potential to generate particles that can be inhaled or cause eye injury if proper personal protective equipment is not used, such as respirators or safety glasses. Caustic baths are often used to dissolve support material used by some 3D printers that allows them to print more complex shapes. These baths require personal protective equipment to prevent injury to exposed skin.|$|E
25|$|Addressable {{systems are}} usually more {{expensive}} than conventional non-addressable systems, and offer extra options, including a custom level of sensitivity (sometimes called Day/Night mode) which can {{determine the amount of}} smoke in a given area and contamination detection from the FACP that allows determination {{of a wide range of}} faults in detection capabilities of smoke detectors. Detectors become contaminated usually as a result of the build up of atmospheric particulates in the detectors being circulated by the heating and air-conditioning systems in buildings. Other causes include carpentry, <b>sanding,</b> painting, and smoke in the event of a fire. Panels can also be interconnected to monitor a very large number of detectors in multiple buildings. This is most commonly used in hospitals, universities, resorts and other large centres or institutions.|$|E
40|$|Emerita analoga, Pacific coast <b>sand</b> crabs, are an {{important}} biological component of the swash zone ecosystem. They have evolved the ability to burrow into <b>sand,</b> and burrowing speed is commonly used {{as an indicator of}} performance relevant for fitness in this species. <b>Sand</b> grain size varies among beaches, and crabs may be better adapted to to burrow in some <b>sand</b> types. We performed a completely crossed 3 -factor experiment to determine how the <b>sand</b> grain size associated with beach-of-origin and rearing conditions influence burrowing in coarse and fine <b>sand.</b> Crabs from a fine <b>sand</b> beach and a coarse <b>sand</b> beach were housed in both fine and coarse <b>sand.</b> The burrowing speed of each crab was tested in fine and coarse <b>sand</b> five times over ten weeks. Crabs were housed individually during the ten weeks, in either coarse or fine <b>sand.</b> We found a significant difference in burrowing times throughout sessions. Crabs from both beaches, housed in both <b>sand</b> types, burrowed faster in coarse <b>sand</b> than in fine <b>sand.</b> However, neither beach-of-origin nor rearing <b>sand</b> type influenced burrowing speed. There was also no difference in mortality among treatments. These results indicate that, although the abiotic factor, <b>sand</b> grain size, influences burrowing speed, this effect is not altered with long term exposure to different <b>sand</b> types...|$|R
