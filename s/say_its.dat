500|$|SAS spokespeople <b>say</b> <b>its</b> {{employee}} benefits are provided for business, not altruistic, reasons. The company evaluates new benefits using three criteria: {{whether it would}} benefit the company culture, whether it would serve {{a significant number of}} employees and whether it would save more money than is spent on it. According to academics, the company's practices improve the loyalty, focus and creativity of its staff. Professor Jeffrey Pfeffer from the Stanford Graduate School of Business estimated that the company saves $60–$80 million annually in expenses related to employee turnover. SAS has an annual employee turnover of three to five percent, while the software industry's average is 20 to 25 percent. According to USA Today, the workplace culture has created [...] "intensely loyal" [...] staff who care about the company's well-being. [...] Even though there are unlimited sick days, the average employee takes only two. The 40,000 free medical visits provided to employees annually are estimated to cost the company $4.5 million USD, but save it $5 million USD due to the employee productivity lost when staff spend their work-hours in waiting rooms at other hospitals.|$|E

The device is described as a combination white noise generator and AM radio receiver modified to sweep back and forth through the AM band selecting split-second snippets of sound. Critics of the device <b>say</b> <b>its</b> effect is subjective and incapable of being replicated, and since it relies on radio noise, any meaningful response a user gets is purely coincidental, or simply the result of pareidolia.|$|E

For example, there are several words in AAVE referring to white people that {{are not part of}} mainstream American English; these include gray as an adjective for whites (as in gray dude), possibly from the color of Confederate uniforms; and paddy, an extension of the slang use for [...] "Irish". [...] "," [...] which is pejorative, is another general term for a white person; it might derive from the Ibibio word afia, which means [...] "light-colored", from the Yoruba word ofe, spoken in hopes of disappearing from danger, or via Pig Latin from [...] "foe". However, most dictionaries simply <b>say</b> <b>its</b> etymology is unknown. Kitchen refers to the particularly curly or kinky hair at the nape of the neck, and siditty or seddity means [...] "snobbish" [...] or [...] "bourgeois".|$|E
2500|$|Figure3 shows a bipolar {{current mirror}} with emitter {{resistors}} {{to increase its}} output resistance.. That is, the resistors RE cause negative feedback that opposes change in current. In particular, any change in output voltage results in less change in current than without this feedback, which means the output resistance of the mirror has increased. [...] Transistor Q1 is diode connected, which is to <b>say</b> <b>its</b> collector-base voltage is zero. Figure4 shows the small-signal circuit equivalent to Figure3. Transistor Q1 is represented by its emitter resistance rE ≈ VT/IE (VT = thermal voltage, IE = Q-point emitter current), a simplification made possible because the dependent current source in the hybrid-pi model for Q1 draws the same current as a resistor 1/gm connected across r. The second transistor Q2 is represented by its hybrid-pi model. Table 1 below shows the z-parameter expressions that make the z-equivalent circuit of Figure2 electrically equivalent to the small-signal circuit of Figure4.|$|E

2500|$|As West grew older, {{she turned}} to broader {{political}} and social issues, including humankind's propensity to inflict violent injustice on itself. Before and during World War II, West traveled widely, collecting material for books on travel and politics. In 1936–38, she made three trips to Yugoslavia, a country she came to love, seeing it as the nexus of European history since the late Middle Ages. Her non-fiction masterpiece, Black Lamb and Grey Falcon is an amalgamation of her impressions from these trips. New York Times reviewer Katherine Woods wrote: [...] "In two almost incredibly full-packed volumes {{one of the most}} gifted and searching of modern English novelists and critics has produced not only the magnification and intensification of the travel book form, but, one may <b>say,</b> <b>its</b> apotheosis." [...] West was assigned by Ross' magazine to cover the Nuremberg Trials for The New Yorker, an experience she memorialized in the book A Train of Powder. In 1950 she was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.
