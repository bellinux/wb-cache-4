25|$|The Industrial Pavilion, {{built in}} 1938–39 and later extended, {{is a large}} {{industrial}} structure with external brick walls and a <b>saw</b> <b>tooth</b> roof. It occupies {{the southwest corner of}} the site, with its southeast wall fronting directly onto Gregory Terrace.|$|E
25|$|Internally the {{building}} is broken up {{into a series of}} long narrow bays which follow the line of the <b>saw</b> <b>tooth</b> roof above. The high face of the <b>saw</b> <b>tooth</b> roof form in each bay is clad with timber lattice which allows the interior space to be naturally lit and ventilated. Entry to the pavilion is through chain wire gates located centrally {{at the end of each}} bay. In plan, each of bays is very similar in that it consists of a central passage flanked by open cattle pen space on either side and storage accommodation enclosures to each end of the bay. These storage/accommodation enclosures are clad with a combination of FC cladding and timber weatherboards. Walls between the bays are timber framed and clad to half height with the upper portion being finished with timber battens. The floor surface throughout the pavilions is concrete and generally follows the gentle slope of the site.|$|E
25|$|The Stock Pavilion is on {{the eastern}} side of the Beef Cattle Pavilion. It has a series of skillion roofs set in a <b>saw</b> <b>tooth</b> pattern as the {{building}} follows the slope. They are clad with corrugated iron. The walls are weatherboard and the upper section is timber lattice. Doors on eastern side are sheet metal double doors, but two central doors now have steel roller doors.|$|E

Externally the walls are clad with timber weatherboards while the individual ends to the skillion roof forms are clad with a combination of FC sheeting and timber lattice.

500|$|In a <b>saw</b> <b>tooth</b> profile the diver ascends and descends {{a number}} of times during the dive. Each ascent and descent {{increases}} the risk of decompression sickness if there are any bubbles already in the diver's tissues. The increase in risk depends on the ascent rate, magnitude and duration of the upwards excursion, [...] the saturation levels of the tissues, and to some extent the time spent after returning to depth. Accurate assessment of the increase of risk is not currently (2016) possible, but some dive computers make an adjustment to the decompression requirement based on violations of recommended maximum ascent rate as an attempt to compensate.|$|E
2500|$|Filing is {{combination}} of grinding and <b>saw</b> <b>tooth</b> cutting using a file. Prior {{to the development}} of modern machining equipment it provided a relatively accurate means for the production of small parts, especially those with flat surfaces. [...] The skilled use of a file allowed a machinist to work to fine tolerances and was the hallmark of the craft. [...] Files can vary in shape, coarseness, and whether the teeth or single cut or double cut depending on what application the file is to be used for. Today filing is rarely used as a production technique in industry, though it remains as a common method of deburring.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — A new {{technique}} {{was developed for}} the investigation of chatter formation considering the instability of the closed-loop system formed by machine tool structure and metal-cutting process. Machine tool structure indicates the importance of different system components and it’s dominating mode frequencies whereas the metal cutting process indicates {{the effect of the}} instability of chip formation-chip serration frequency. The mechanisms of the investigation of chatter explained by the technique were experimentally verified during end milling operation of medium carbon steel (AISI 45) considering the chips and types of discreteness in the form of serrated <b>saw</b> <b>teeth.</b> Experimental investigations have been conducted on the chips and common types of discreteness in the form of serrated <b>saw</b> <b>teeth.</b> Mechanism of formation of these teeth has been studied and the frequency of their formation ha...|$|R

40|$|In {{the present}} work {{a review of}} the {{existing}} theories of chatter formation has been conducted and the weaknesses of the most widely accepted ‘Regenerative Chatter theory’ in explaining various phenomena related to chatter formation have been identified. An attempt has been made in this work to determine the common causes of chatter formation in different metal cutting operations, namely, turning, thread cutting and end milling conducted on plain carbon steel AISI 1040. Experimental investigations have been conducted during the above types of machining processes to identify the marks of instability and chatter on the formed chips. It has been identified that in all the three machining operations the chips formed show a common type of discreteness in the form of secondary <b>saw</b> <b>teeth,</b> which appear at the free edge of the chip. Mechanism of formation of these teeth has been studied and the frequencies of their formation have been determined for different cutting conditions. Apart from the secondary <b>saw</b> <b>teeth</b> primary <b>saw</b> <b>teeth</b> have also been identified at the main section of the chip and their frequencies were also determined. At the same time the natural vibrations of the main system components have been identified and the acceleration amplitudes at the prominent natural frequencies during actual machining were recoded using a dedicated vibration monitoring system. The frequencies of secondary chip serration and the natural frequencies of the system components were plotted against cutting speed. Acceleration amplitudes at the prominent natural frequencies were also plotted separately against cutting force. Based on comparison and analysis of these two frequency and amplitude graphs it was concluded that chatter (vibration with relatively high amplitude) appears in the system when the frequency of secondary <b>saw</b> <b>teeth</b> approaches values equal to half or integer multiple of a prominent natural frequency of the system resulting in resonance. In the case of thread cutting and turning the main vibrating component was identified as the tool holder {{and in the case of}} end milling the main vibrating components were the tool holder and the spindle. Severe vibration/chatter was found to appear during end milling when the tool and the spindle simultaneously entered into resonance. This occurred when the chip serration frequency got close to the spindle’s natural frequency, which was approximately twice the value of the natural frequency of the tool holder in the conducted experiments...|$|R
