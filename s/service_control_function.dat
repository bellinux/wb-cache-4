40|$|Abstract. Next-generation network {{architectures}} aim at {{the convergence}} of services (e. g. telephony, television, Web access, online games, and new services) over a common IP core. Additionally, the integration of wired and wireless access technologies will offer users ubiquitous access to all those services. Telecommunications networks rely on signalling protocols to perform key <b>service</b> <b>control</b> <b>functions</b> such as locating and authenticating users, establishing communication sessions, reserving resources, charging, etc. Signalling is crucial for network operators and so requires a transport service with very high availability and low delay. Traditionally, operators have deployed dedicated and highly redundant signalling networks following ITU-T standards. More recently, and motivated by the current evolution towards IP, the IETF has defined SIGTRAN, a new protocol suite intended to transport signalling protocols over IP. This paper addresses the problem of configuring the protocol mechanisms existing at different layers of the SIGTRAN architecture in a coordinated way, {{with the goal of}} creating a redundant network topology able to meet the stringent availability levels required for signalling in carrier-grade networks. The proposed solution is described and evaluated numerically...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} {{scalable}} software architecture for distributed traffic generation {{capable of producing}} Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game (MMORPG) packet flows in a statistically accurate manner for thousands of concurrent players. The main challenge, to achieve truly massive scale traffic generation, has been achieved by introducing kernel based virtualization, pioneered by the network simulator/emulator IMUNES, into the User Behaviour Based Network Traffic Generation (UrBBan-Gen, introduced in our earlier work). The UrBBan-Gen software architecture consists of four modules: <b>Service</b> repository, <b>Control</b> <b>function</b> and user interface, Behaviour process, and Traffic generation process. IMUNES has been integrated into the virtualization part of the Traffic generation process, which has resulted in two improvements: 1) {{increasing the number of}} generated packet flows while accurately replicating the required statistical properties, and, 2) introducing the ability to run various network scenarios in simulated, as well as real networks, under realistic traffic loads. With respect to the traffic generation capabilities of the previous version of UrBBan-Gen, which was based on Linux containers, the IMUNES based solution demonstrates higher scalability, lower packet loss rates, and lower CPU load for both the UDP traffic at high packet rate and “thin” TCP traffic flows typical for MMORPGs...|$|R

A comparison of the new schedulability conditions with existing, less accurate, conditions show the efficiency gain obtained by using exact conditions. Examples ar [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Task {{difficulty}} is widely cited in current theory regarding cognitive <b>control</b> and fronto-parietal <b>function.</b> Ongoing debate surrounds {{the extent to}} which global difficulty across multiple cognitive demands is the main driver of lateral frontal activity. Here, we examine a commonly cited behavioral marker of difficulty in these accounts: time-on-task (ToT), as assessed by response time. Specifically, we investigate the task-dependent scaling of frontal BOLD responses with ToT during hierarchical cognitive control. We observe a paradoxical relationship, whereby rostral regions show greater scaling with ToT on a first-order task, despite showing greater recruitment on a second-order task; caudal regions show the converse relationships. Together, these results demonstrate that ToT does not reflect a single dimension of difficulty that uniformly drives lateral frontal activity. Rather, this discrepancy in the mean and scaling of BOLD requires that multiple, distinct processes are instantiated across these fronto-parietal regions in the <b>service</b> of cognitive <b>control</b> <b>function.</b> Comment: 20 page main text with figures in-line; 5 page supplemen...|$|R

The scarce bandwidth is not only consumed by placing and receiving calls on a portable, but by performing routine <b>control</b> <b>functions</b> to ensure universal service and increased quality of <b>service.</b> Among the <b>control</b> <b>functions</b> performed by a wireless network is finding the location of called mobiles. The registration area planning problem attempts to achieve this with minimal impact on the network's bandwidth. In this paper, we develop a grouping genetic algorithm to efficiently solve the registration area planning problem. The problem is NP-complete, therefore the literature has concentrated on heuristics to find good solutions in an acceptable time. The goal of registration area planning is to group wireless network cells into contiguous areas to minimize location update costs subject to paging bound and preset constraints. Therefore, the registration area planning problem is a grouping problem and grouping genetic algorithms, which {{have been shown to be}} a useful tool in solving these types of problems, are an applicable solution methodology. The proposed grouping genetic algorithm, GGARAP, has been extensively tested.

Design/methodology/approach – It discusses the literature of corporate governance and public service motivation and reflects it against practice evidenced in documentation for the UK Corporate Governance Code, codes for boards of different levels of public organizations, and both formal and informal evaluations of practice. Findings – The use of independent, non-executives directors in public bodies encapsulates {{the tension in the}} private sector between the service role of directors and how they control managers. The paper gives a preliminary investigation of three public bodies, comparing how reform of their governance has affected tensions in accountability and director motivation.
