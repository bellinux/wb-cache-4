40|$|Corrosion of {{reinforcement}} {{is one of}} the most common causes of deterioration in reinforced concrete bridges. Anchorage, prior to shear and bending moment resistance, is the main uncertainties in the evaluation of the structural behavior of corroded reinforced concrete bridges. Thus, to assess the remaining load-bearing capacity of deteriorated existing bridges, models to estimate the remaining bond and anchorage capacity are needed. Most of our knowledge on the structural behavior of corroded reinforced concrete structures is based on experimental investigations of artificially corroded concrete specimens. In this study, the anchorage capacity of naturally corroded steel reinforcement was investigated experimentally. The test specimens were taken from edge beams of a bridge, Stallbackabron, in Sweden. Since the dimensions and the amount {{of reinforcement}} were given on beforehand, it was only the test set-up which could be chosen freely. A test set-up consisting of a four point bending test indirectly supported with suspension hanger was considered to be the best alternative with the least disturbance and influence of the natural damages. Detailed design was done by using a non-linear finite element method. It was seen that the edge beams needed to be strengthened with transverse reiforcement, else they would have failed in a local failure at the suspension hole or in shear. The technique adopted for the strengthening was an internal mounting of steel reinforcement using epoxy as adhesive. The bond and anchorage behavior was examined in tests through measurements of applied load, free-end slip and mid-span deflection. A first test showed that additional measures were needed to ensure anchorage of the <b>strengthening</b> <b>bars.</b> In subsequent tests, they were therefore anchored at the top of the beam with hexagonal nuts and flat steel plates.

40|$|In {{spite of}} the fact that {{post-tensioning}} frameworks require specific learning and mastery to create, collect and introduce, the idea is anything but difficult to clarify. Envision a progression of wooden pieces with openings penetrated through them, into which an elastic band is strung. In the event that one holds the finishes of the elastic band, the squares will hang. Post-tensioning can be shown by setting wing nuts on either end of the elastic band and winding the elastic band so that the squares are pushed firmly together. In the event that one holds the wing nuts subsequent to winding, the pieces will stay straight. The fixed elastic band is practically identical to a post-tensioning tendon that has been extended by pressure driven jacks and is held set up by wedge-sort securing gadgets. To completely welcome the advantages of post-tensioning, it is useful to know a tiny bit about concrete. Concrete is exceptionally solid in pressure however frail in strain, i. e. it will break when strengths act to force it apart. In ordinary RCC development, if a load, for example, the autos in a parking carport are acting on a section or beam, the beam will have a tendency to sag or deflect. This deflection will bring about the base of the beam to stretch somewhat. Indeed, even a slight stretching is typically enough to bring about breaking. Steel <b>strengthening</b> <b>bars</b> ("rebar") are ordinarily inserted in the solid as ductile reinforcement to confine the cracks. Rebar is what is called "passive" support anyway; it doesn't convey any drive until the concrete has as of now deflected enough to break. Post-tensioning tendons, then again, are viewed as "dynamic" fortifying. Since it is prestressed, the steel is successful as fortification despite the fact that the concrete may not be broken. Post-tensioned structures can be intended to have insignificant redirection and splitting, even under full load...|$|R
40|$|Upgrading or {{strengthening}} of existing reinforced concrete (RC) infrastructure is an emerging demand nowadays. Near Surface Mounted (NSM) technique is very promising approach for flexural {{strengthening of}} RC members. However, premature failure such as concrete cover separation failure {{have been a}} main concern in utilizing this technique. In this study, U-wrap end anchorage with carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) fabrics is proposed to eliminate the concrete cover separation failure.

40|$|Repeated {{cyclic loading}} of {{reinforced}} concrete (RC) {{structures such as}} bridges can cause reduced service life and structure failure due to fatigue even when the stress ranges applied to the structural components are very low. These problems can be mitigated by using fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) composites to increase the structures’ load carrying capacity and fatigue life or service life. Strengthening of this sort may be a suitable way to prolong the service life of concrete structures. FRP strengthening involves externally bonding a plate, sheet or rod of the strengthening material {{to the surface of}} the concrete member or placing the strengthening element in grooves cut into the member’s surface. The bonding of plates or sheets to the surface is often referred to as EBR (externally bonded reinforcement) whereas the placement of <b>strengthening</b> <b>bars</b> in grooves carved into the member’s surface is referred to as NSM (Near Surface Mounted) reinforcement. When this research project was initiated, it was not clear whether EBR or NSM strengthening was more effective at alleviating the effects of fatigue loading, and there were many aspects of their use that warranted further investigation. The main objectives of the work presented in this thesis were to study the behaviour of materials and structures under fatigue loading, to assess the structural challenges presented by fatigue loading of members strengthened with EBR plates or NSM bars, and to identify analytical models suitable for the design and analysis of FRP-strengthening elements and strengthened concrete members. The scientific approach adopted in this work is based on experimental fatigue loading tests of RC beams strengthened with EBR plates and NSM bars together with the development and assessment of analytical methods for describing the fatigue behaviour of tested strengthened beams and numerical models for predicting the behaviour of bond joints under fatigue loading. The analytical models were then verified against experimental results.

40|$|The {{flexural}} {{performance of}} a reinforced concrete (RC) beam can be improved using the near-surface mounted (NSM) FRP strengthening technique. In the NSM technique, grooves are first cut in the concrete cover, and FRP bars are then placed in the grooves using a suitable bonding adhesive. In such an FRP-strengthened RC beam, debonding failure at the two bar ends may occur due to local high interaction forces in the bar-end regions between the RC beam and the FRP bars. This paper presents a theoretical investigation into these interaction forces in RC beams strengthened with NSM FRP rectangular bars (including FRP strips with a narrow rectangular section as a special case). By introducing and defining two interfacial stiffness parameters, an analytical solution for the tangential and the normal interaction forces between the beam and the NSM bars is first obtained based on the analytical solution developed by Smith and Teng for beams strengthened with an externally bonded FRP plate. The accuracy of the analytical solution is demonstrated by comparing its predictions with those from a 3 -D linear elastic finite element (FE) model. The numerical results from both the analytical solution and the 3 -D FE model confirms the existence of high interaction forces in the bar-end regions as the cause for bar-end debonding failure which has been commonly observed in tests. While the present paper is focused on RC beams strengthened with NSM rectangular bars, the proposed approach is general and is applicable {{to a range of}} similar problems such as RC beams <b>strengthened</b> with NSM <b>bars</b> of other cross-sectional shapes (e. g. circular and elliptical shapes) as well as timber beams <b>strengthened</b> with NSM <b>bars.</b> Department of Civil and Environmental Engineerin...|$|R

To assess the performance and reliability of small-scale testing on near-surface mounted (NSM) FRP strengthening systems, an experimental program was carried out {{on a series of}} nine NSM FRP <b>strengthening</b> systems (<b>bars</b> and strips), in the framework of an international round robin testing (RRT). Eleven laboratories and seven manufacturers and suppliers participated in this extensive international exercise, which regarded both NSM and EBR FRP strengthening systems.

The results show no significant influence of the concrete strength on both failure modes and loads. On the other hand, axial stiffness and surface treatment of the FRP NSM systems strongly affect both the bond strength and the parameters identifying the bond laws. Differences of bond strength experimentally recorded for the same FRP NSM systems tested according to different setups range between 10 and 25 %.
