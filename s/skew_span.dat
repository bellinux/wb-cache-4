50|$|The ribbed skew arch {{is a form}} of {{the false}} skew arch in which several narrow regular arches or ribs, offset {{laterally}} with respect to one another, are used to approximate a true skew arch.Motivated by the lack of skilled stonemasons in the 18th century United States, the design was first proposed in 1802 for a crossing of the Schuylkill River in Philadelphia by British-born American architect Benjamin Henry Latrobeand later championed by French civil engineer A. Boucher.Because the series of arch ribs are all regular arches this method of construction has the advantage of being less demanding of unskilled artisans but it has received considerable criticism as being weak, susceptible to frost damage, ugly and wasteful of materials.Although Latrobe's bridge was never built as proposed, his method of construction was later to be used extensively by the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad throughout the Philadelphia area, including an ambitious viaduct designed by Gustavus A.

Most railway viaducts {{at the time were}} brick built but the {{foundations}} of the Bennerley Viaduct were subject to a great deal of coal mining subsidence therefore, the lighter wrought iron design was chosen. The viaduct was built between May 1876 and November 1877 and forms part of the Great Northern Railway Derbyshire Extension which was built in part to exploit the coalfields in Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire. The contract was given by the Great Northern Railway (GNR) to Benton & Woodiwiss with the line laid out by, and the viaduct designed by Richard Johnson (Chief Civil Engineer of the GNR); Samuel Abbott was the resident engineer. The viaduct consists of 16 lattice work deck spans, each 76 feet 7 inches long supported on wrought iron columns with stone capped blue brick foundations. There were three additional iron skew spans at the Ilkeston end of the viaduct which carried the railway line over the Erewash Canal and the Midland Railway's Erewash Valley Line. A <b>skew</b> <b>span</b> crosses its abutments and or piers at an angle other than a right angle. At the Awsworth end of the viaduct there was a section of embankment (including bridges of more conventional brick construction) which has been demolished. The Nottingham Canal passed under this section. The viaduct was built for the railway line between Awsworth Junction and Derby on the Derbyshire and Staffordshire Line and opened in January 1878. Bennerley Ironworks was originally due north of the viaduct served by sidings connected to both the Great Northern line and the Midland Railway Erewash Valley line. After the demolition of the ironworks a British Coal distribution depot served by sidings from the former Midland Railway occupied the same site. This has now also been demolished.|$|E
40|$|Fatigue Cracking often {{occurs in}} {{composite}} bridges with unstiffened girder web gaps {{at the ends}} of transverse stiffeners. In this project, researchers sought to better understand bridge diaphragm deflection behavior and advance the ability to estimate web gap distortional stress. Trends from the parametric studies led to general observations that may assist in identifying fatigue-prone bridges. Variables that influence diaphragm deflection behavior include girder spacing, bridge <b>skew,</b> <b>span</b> length, and deck thickness. Transverse load distribution properties appear to play the most significant role in determining the magnitude of differential deflection. Parameter study stress trends indicate that out-of-plane distortional stress in fatigue prone web gaps primarily depends on web gap properties, bridge span length, and angle of skew. Differential deflection and web gap dimension trends apply to a varied spectrum of bridge configurations. The research resulted in a method to assess bridge girder differential deflection and distortional stress in actual steel bridges without complex analysis and modeling. Proposed procedures for evaluating out-of-plane stress should prove practical and aid in screening, identifying, and assessing bridges vulnerable to distortion -induced fatigue cracking.

Effects of support reactions for different spans have been studied. The analysis provides the useful information about the variation of support reactions with respect to change in skew. The negative reactions were observed with increase in the span and skew angles. It was found that in skew T-beams bridges, the high positive and negative reactions develop close to each other. Negative reactions were very less in the 8 m right span and introduced at an angle of 500 and onwards, while for 16 m right span it was introduced an angle of 300.

40|$|In today 2 ̆ 7 s textbooks, {{analyzing}} prestressed {{members and}} bridges takes a two-dimensional approach. Two-dimensional analysis {{is the only}} way to analyze prestressed bridges and members because otherwise the hand calculations are extremely difficult. Skewed bridges, however, need to be analyzed and designed three-dimensionally. Based on engineering inspection, it is possible to tell how a non-skewed symmetric bridge will behave. However, the knowledge of how a skewed bridge will behave cannot be obtained by inspection only. Finite element analysis can be used to model a bridge and discover how the bridge will react to dead loads and post-tensioning forces. When a bridge is built on a skew, the acute corners of the bridge support much less concrete weight than the obtuse corners of the bridge. If the post-tensioning force causes a decrease in load at the acute corners of the skewed bridge and if the skew of the bridge is great enough, there is a concern that there could be uplift at these acute corners of the bridge. Uplift at any corner of the bridge should not be allowed. The objective of this study is to investigate a simple <b>span</b> <b>skewed</b> box girder bridge to see if any uplift occurs at the acute corners of the bridge due to post-tensioning forces. After careful study of a <b>skewed</b> simple <b>span</b> cast-in-place post-tensioned box girder bridge, it was found that the post-tensioning force actually transfers more downward force into the acute corners of the bridge. Based on this study, the post-tensioning force will not cause uplift in the acute corners of the skewed bridge...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — During {{the past}} years, {{due to the}} {{decrease}} of the minimum feature size in CMOS technology, the on-chip clock frequencies have increased dramatically ranging into the GHz domain.

In order {{to cope with this}} skew, synchronization strategies have been developed which rely on either analogue or digital multitap delay-lines. In order for the synchronization mechanism to function properly, all tap-delays of the delay-line should have the same values within few percentages. This paper presents a technique, based on the oscillation method, to measure tap-delays of a delay-line with an accuracy of ± 10 ps. A chip has also been implemented in an UMC 0. 18 µm CMOS technology to prove our assumption. The measurements carried out on the chip confirmed the above mentioned accuracy...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{quantify}} the influence of temperature changes on integral abutment bridge movements, thirty-two Sokkia RS 30 N reflective targets were strategically attached to a bridge along its length. These targets were surveyed every month for twelve consecutive months. These changes in length coincided with restraint conditions between purely fixed and simply supported. Movement of expansion joints was also recorded. The movements of the expansion gaps at opposite corners appear to exhibit similar movements. This behavior indicates a type of twisting motion occurring within the bridge {{as a result of}} unequal movements at the east and west sides of each abutment. This motion suggests that the bridge abutments experience forces that incite weak axis bending in the abutments, especially in the north abutment. These quantitative bridge movements were compared to predicted behavior from a finite-element model. A detailed finite-element model of the bridge was created using SAP 2000 (Computers and Structures, Inc.) software. The detailed model was developed using solid elements for all components of the bridge except piles and bents. Longitudinal surface springs were placed at the abutment elements in order to simulate the soil-abutment interaction. A typical temperature load was assigned to the bridge deck and girder elements to compare the calculated stress concentrations in the model with the observed cracking on the abutment. The model produced high stress concentrations in the abutment adjacent to the bottom girder flange. This corresponded to the same location of observed cracking. The finite-element model also showed lateral movement of the north abutment. This lateral abutment contributed to the unequal movements of the bridge spans. Once the comparison between the measured bridge behavior of the survey and the findings of the detailed finite element model was completed, a simplified model was used to evaluate the bending moment and stresses in the abutment of the 400 South Street Bridge. The simplified model was also used to perform a parametric study on the influence of <b>skew,</b> <b>span</b> length, and temperature gradient on weak-axis abutment moments...|$|E

While patients with hemispatial neglect mistakenly bisect horizontal lines to the right of centre, neurologically healthy individuals show a mean leftward error.

We were able to manipulate this bias by using an asymmetrical gaze-contingent window, which revealed more of the scene on one side of fixation-causing participants to saccade more often in that direction. A second experiment demonstrated the same change in eye movements occurring rapidly from trial to trial, and investigated whether it would carry over and effect attention during a line bisection task. There was some carry-over from gaze-contingent scene viewing to the eye movements during line bisection. However, despite frequent initial eye movements and many errors to the left, manual responses were not affected by this change in orienting.

The loadings were multiple point loads representing two HS 20 AASHTO vehicles, and the loads were positioned to produce maximum bending moments in the girders. Convergence studies to evaluate the precision of the finite element models were also done, and comparisons were made {{with the results of}} other studies. An extensive parametric study was done to determine the most important variables and to gain an understanding of the response of the skew bridge. Expressions for the design moments in interior and exterior girders were then developed. These take into account the span and spacing of girders, the stiffness of the girders relative to the slab stiffness, and the angle of skew. The format is the use of the static moment for a girder, with modifications to this moment based on girder span and spacing, slab to girder stiffness ratio, and skew angle.

40|$|The {{geometry}} of the real four-qubit Pauli group, being embodied {{in the structure of}} the symplectic polar space W(7, 2), is analyzed in terms of ovoids of a hyperbolic quadric of PG(7, 2), the seven-dimensional projective space of order two. The quadric is selected in such a way that it contains all 135 symmetric elements of the group. Under such circumstances, the third element on the line defined by any two points of an ovoid is skew-symmetric, as is the nucleus of the conic defined by any three points of an ovoid. Each ovoid thus yields 36 / 84 elements of the former/latter type, accounting for all 120 skew-symmetric elements of the group. There are a number of notable types of ovoid-associated subgeometries of the group, of which we mention the following: a subset of 12 skew-symmetric elements lying on four mutually <b>skew</b> lines that <b>span</b> the whole ambient space, a subset of 15 symmetric elements that corresponds to two ovoids sharing three points, a subset of 19 symmetric elements generated by two ovoids on a common point, a subset of 27 symmetric elements that can be partitioned into three ovoids in two unique ways, a subset of 27 skew-symmetric elements that exhibits a 15 + 2 x 6 split reminding that exhibited by an elliptic quadric of PG(5, 2), and a subset of seven skew-symmetric elements formed by the nuclei of seven conics having two points in common, which is an analogue of a Conwell heptad of PG(5, 2). The strategy we employed is completely novel and unique in its nature, as are the results obtained.

While the intrados of a [...] "true" [...] skew arch is smooth and cylindrical, the intrados of this type of [...] "false" [...] skew arch has a stepped appearance.

40|$|An {{extensive}} {{analytical and}} experimental investigation was undertaken {{to study the}} load distribution characteristics of simply supported and two-equal-span continuous skew composite concrete slab on compact steel girder bridges. Detailed parametric studies were conducted to find the effect of several parameters upon the load distribution characteristics in skew bridges {{at different stages of}} loading. In this work, both the nonlinear finite element method and the yield-line theory were employed in the theoretical analyses. The finite element method was used to study the behaviour and response of skew composite bridges in the elastic and post-elastic ranges of loading. The nonlinear finite element analysis was also used to conduct a parametric study and to evaluate the ultimate-load capacity of skew bridges. Moreover, the analysis through yield-line theory was utilized to yield different general formulae to predict the failure load of skew composite bridges. The most probable failure patterns were based on both the experimental and parametric studies. Five small-scale models of four-girder and five-girder skew composite bridges were constructed and tested to failure in order to verify the analytical approaches and to study the load distribution characteristics of skew bridges with varying parameters. The tested models were divided into two groups. The first group consisted of three simply supported single <b>span</b> <b>skew</b> composite bridge models with an angle of skew of 45 ∘ while the second group consisted of two two-equal-span continuous skew composite bridge models with the same angle of skew as the first group. Good comparisons between the theoretical and experimental results for all five models were shown. The analysis of the results from the parametric study revealed that the ultimate-load capacity and the load distribution characteristics of skew composite bridges are influenced by several factors such as: angle of skew, aspect ratio of the bridge, load position, type of interconnection of different elements of the bridge, continuity, presence of transverse diaphragms, and the sectional moment capacities.

40|$|A new precast-prestressed {{cross section}} was {{recently}} {{developed by a}} consortium of engineers from the six New England states, New York {{and members of the}} northeast region of PCI. The northeast extreme Tee (NEXT) beam is efficient for medium Bridge spans (50 to 80 ft long). Field formwork savings are introduced by having a flange cast integrally during fabrication of the beams at the precasting plant. Job safety is increased because a working platform is created. The flange width of the NEXT Beams can be adjusted during fabrication to accommodate roadways of different widths and skew angles. Because the section is new with complexity in its shape, the present design guidance cannot be used to evaluate LLDFs for NEXT beams {{within the context of the}} AASHTO LRFD. In particular, the use of live-load distribution factors (LLDFs) equations in LRFD for NEXT beams is not straightforward. The distance between the beam webs is variable depending on whether it is measured within a beam module or between adjacent modules. In absence of detailed information a PCI technical committee evaluated LLDFs (through AASHTO 2010 Bridge specification) for the NEXT beams used in the Brimfield Bridge by two different approaches and found one of them conservative. The conservative approach was single stem which uses the average spacing (between webs ([S 1 +S 3]/ 2)) for use in the LLDF equations [...] The committee expressed concerns about whether trends of LLDFs would be similar for other parametric sets, and would like to standardize the methodology for the Bridge projects in Massachusetts with NEXT beam as the girder. To verify the conservativeness of single stem methodology (for the evaluation of LLDFs) for other parameters this research project was initiated. LLDFs are evaluated based on the two approaches and compared with the LLDFs obtained through finite element modeling. The results of 40 - 3 D finite element models have been used to compare the LLDFs obtained from AASHTO 2010 Bridge design specification. The results were also used to compare different parameters that affect LLDFs of NEXT beams including <b>span,</b> <b>skew</b> angle, and beam end fixity. The finite element models were created using a Bridge prototype that is being instrumented for future field verification of the analyses. The models were created using frame elements for the beams and shell elements for the cast in place deck. The integral abutment and foundation of the Bridges was included in the models in which piles are created using frame elements and abutments are created using shell elements. The results indicate that the approach taken for the design of NEXT beams is in general conservative for interior girders of the Bridge. On the contrary such the adopted approach was not yielding the higher value of LLDFs. The variation in strains due to losses are compared by two methods (strains variation obtained from field data and strain variation obtained based on AASHTO equation of losses) to verify the AASHTO equation of losses...|$|R
