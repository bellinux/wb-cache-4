40|$|Varied electrostatics {{experiments}} followed Benjamin Franklin's pioneering atmospheric investigations. In Knightsbridge, Central London, John Read (1726 – 1814) {{installed a}} <b>sensing</b> <b>rod</b> {{in the upper}} part of his house and, using a pith ball electrometer and Franklin chimes, monitored atmospheric electricity from 1789 to 1791. Atmospheric electricity is sensitive to weather and smoke pollution. In calm weather conditions, Read observed two daily electrification maxima in moderate weather, around 9 am and 7 pm. This is likely to represent a double diurnal cycle in urban smoke. Before the motor car and steam railways, one source of the double maximum smoke pattern was the daily routine of fire lighting for domestic heating. ...|$|E
40|$|The retina avoids signal {{saturation}} {{through the}} use of both dim-light <b>sensing</b> <b>rod</b> and bright-light sensing cone photoreceptor circuits. Photoreceptors are responsible for converting an image into an electrical signal, which is transmitted to bipolar cells and ganglion cells. Amacrine cells modulate the interaction between bipolar cells and ganglion cells through inhibitory signaling, and therefore play a large part in inner retinal processing. However, inhibitory connections between amacrine cells are a little understood signaling component of the retina. Within this study, amacrine cells within the mouse retina were separated into two categories: narrow-field glycinergic and wide-field GABAergic. Amacrine cells were subjected to a light stimuli under dark-adapted, light-adapted, and receptor isolated conditions, and the peak amplitude and charge transfer of the L-IPSC was measured. Wide-field amacrine cells received an increase in the percentage of inhibition from glycine after light adaptation. There is an overall decrease in spontaneous activity with light adaptation, but an increase in the percent of glycinergic spontaneous activity. Spatial inhibition to narrow-field amacrine cells becomes narrower with light adaptation. L-IPSC peak amplitude decreases with light adaptation with application of a full-field light stimulus, and also decreases as the distance between the stimulus and the cell body increases...|$|E
40|$|In Micro-rolling process, {{metal sheet}} is {{imprinted}} with micron level textures by feeding into {{the gap between}} one smooth roll and one textured roll. To enhance the rollability of thin metal sheet and dimensional accuracy, high density current is sent through workpiece to soften the material by increasing temperature. This manufacturing process is called by Electrically-Assisted Micro-rolling (EAμR). EAμR, as a high efficiency and environment protection manufacturing process, {{can be used for}} production of key components in Micro-electromechanical Systems and bio-engineering. To control the quality of product, it is essential to monitor the pressure distribution in workpiece-roll interface during micro-rolling process. Comparing with process monitoring in conventional rolling process, sensing method in micro-rolling process monitoring not only demands to maintain surface integrity of roll surface, but also is limited by narrow space for sensors installation. Thus, a new sensing method based on embedded capacitance sensor array has been developed and prototyped for real-time monitoring in Electrically-Assisted Micro-rolling process. In the optimal structural design of embedded sensor, Finite element modeling is investigated to study the influence of sensor parameters and electrical current on sensor. To improve the spatial resolution of embedded sensor array mounted in a limited space, a new pressure reconstruction algorithm is presented to retrieve continuous spatial distribution of rolling pressure from a limited number of measured points. In this context, three research tasks has been identified and examined {{during the course of this}} thesis: 1) Design of a new embedded sensing method and its modeling The new sensing method monitors micro-rolling process by an embedded capacitance sensor array integrated into smooth roll of micro-rolling mill. The new embedded sensor using limited sensor installation space provides a new method to measure contact pressure between roller and workpiece without damaging the roller surface. It consists of a cylindrical plastic rod as the physical carrier of sensor array, a group of metal foils attached on cylindrical surface as receiving layer of capacitance array, and a thin plastic film as dielectric material of capacitance. The excitation layer of capacitance sensor is attached on inner surface of mounting hole in smooth roll. When the <b>sensing</b> <b>rod</b> is mounted into mounting hole, a series of capacitance is formed along axial direction of roll. In the design of mechatronics system, multi-physics modeling, based on finite element method, is developed not only to study the relationship between sensor parameters and the sensitivity of sensor, but to understand the thermal and electro-magnetic effect of electrical current passing through workpiece quantitatively as well. 2) Development of prototyping micro-rolling sensing system Micro-rolling sensing system is developed for real-time monitoring of Electrical-Assisted Micro-Rolling process. The whole system consists of one or two embedded capacitance sensor arrays, smooth roll, and capacitance measurement electronic device. Two 1 x 12 pixel capacitance sensor arrays are inserted into sensor mounting holes in smooth roll. Two pieces of printed circuit boards (PCB) are mounted at both ends of smooth roll for capacitance measurement and wireless data transmission. The electronic device measures capacitance in <b>sensing</b> <b>rod</b> using capacitance-to-digital converter chip for stable and precise capacitance measurement. To decrease the noise caused by signal cable, ZigBee communication module is used to transmit the digital signal from circuit to remote PC. In PC receiver, software interface has been developed for real-time monitoring and data analysis. A calibration process on micro-rolling mill has been investigated to calibrate the relationship between capacitance increase of each electrode and rolling pressure. 3) Reconstruction of Spatio-Temporal Distribution of rolling pressure Since roll misalignment and unevenness of workpiece can cause unexpected pressure distribution, monitoring of spatio-temporal distribution of rolling pressure at workpiece-roll interface is critical to control the accuracy of channel dimension. During micro-rolling process, micro-rolling sensing system embedded in rolling mill can transfer a set of capacitance data. To convert capacitance increases of one dimensional sensor array to pressure distribution along axial direction of roll, Back-proejection method is investigated to solve the inverse problem. The pressure-to-capacitance transducer is calculated by numerical method. To increase the spatial resolution of pressure-to-capacitance conversion, interpolation method is investigated to estimate the continuous deformation of dielectric layer under rolling pressure from limited number of sensing points. In this context, three interpolation methods (Kriging, Thin Plated Spline, and Bezier interpolation) and four back-projection methods (Tikhonov regularization, iterative Tikhonov regularization, Landweber iteration, and Offline Iteration Online Reconstruction) are discussed. The best combination of interpolation and back-projection method is determined by numerical experiment. In addition to these focal areas, prototyped micro-rolling sensing system has been equipped to micro-rolling mill for pressure monitoring during EAμR. Pressure reconstruction algorithm has also been tested by outputs of micro-rolling sensing system. The experimental verification was utilized for reliability evaluation of embedded sensing method and pressure reconstruction algorithm...|$|E

40|$|Electronmicroscopical {{investigation}} {{was made on}} the fine structure of the chordotonal sensillum in antenna of Drosophila melanogaster. The sensillum is composed {{of a pair of}} sense cells, and three types of satellite cells, i. e. a scolopale cell, an envelope cell and a cap cell. These three cells are arranged from proximal to distal layer in this order. Each sense cell is bipolar, sending an axon to the antennal nerve and a distal-process toward the third articular membrane. The distal process is a slender prolongation containing an axial filament in its proximal part and a ciliary structure in its distal part. The axial fila-ment splits into several branches at its apical part and comes in contact with the base of a cilium, which dilates to show a sieve-like structure at its distal part. The two cilia different in length from each other enter into the cap and closely adhere to its inner surface. The cap reaches the third articular membrane. The scolopale, a <b>sense</b> <b>rod,</b> which is surrounded by an envelope cell and a few cap cells derives from the scolopale cell. Some discussions were made with reference to the functional mechanism of the chordotonal sensillum...|$|R
50|$|The {{best example}} of the {{distinction}} between acuity and hyperacuity comes from vision, for example when observing stars on a night sky. The first stage is the optical imaging of the outside world on the retina. Light impinges on the mosaic of receptor <b>sense</b> cells, <b>rods</b> and cones, which covers the retinal surface without gaps or overlap, just like the detecting pixels in the film plane of digital cameras. Each receptor accepts all the light reaching it but acts as a unit, representing a single location in visual space. This compartmentalization sets a limit to the decision whether an image came from a single or a double star (resolution). For a percept of separately articulated stars to emerge, the images of the two must be wide enough apart to leave at least one intervening pixel relatively unstimulated between them. This defines the resolution limit and the basis of visual acuity.|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} use of nanomechanical torsional resonators for frequency-shift-based infrared (IR) thermal <b>sensing.</b> Nanoscale torsion <b>rods,</b> ~ 1 μm {{long and}} 50 – 100 nm in diameter, provide both extraordinary thermal isolation and excellent angular displacement and torque sensitivities, of order ~ 10 ^(– 7) rad·Hz^(– 1 / 2) and 10 ^(– 22) (N·m) Hz^(– 1 / 2), respectively. Furthermore, these nanorods act as linear torsional springs, yielding a maximum angular displacement of 3. 6 ° and a dynamic range of over 100 dB; this exceeds {{the performance of}} flexural modes {{by as much as}} 5 orders of magnitude. These attributes lead to superior noise performance for torsional-mode sensing. We demonstrate the operational principles of torsional-mode IR detection, attaining an uncooled noise equivalent temperature difference (NETD) of 390 mK. By modeling the fundamental noise processes, we project that further reduction of device size can significantly improve thermal responsivity; a room-temperature NETD below 10 mK appears feasible...|$|R
40|$|How are antonym {{relations}} acquired? What {{types of}} lexical {{information can be}} extracted from corpora and how? How can this information be encoded in a lexicon? The work in this book was developed {{within the framework of}} WordNet. A further elaborated lexical model is suggested, as well as methods for implementing it. The first part of the book is a study of adjectives co-occurring with adjectives. English direct antonyms, e. g. short-long, have previously been shown to co-occur in the same sentence significantly more often than expected according to the null hypothesis that the words of a corpus are randomly distributed. Using further elaborated methods that account for variation in sentence length, the studies in this book show that this is true also for Swedish direct antonyms, e. g. kort-long 'short'-'long'. However, there are various reasons why words co-occur; most word pairs from the same semantic scale co-occur more often than expected according to the null hypothesis. It is further shown that so called indirect antonyms, such as småväxt-reslig 'short of stature'-'stately' co-occur sententially less often than the direct antonyms of the same scales. It is also shown {{that the vast majority of}} the co-occurring antonyms appear in parallel context. These characteristics may facilitate the acquisition of antonym relations, and can also be used to find semantically related words in corpora. The second part of the book focus on the co-occurrence of adjectives and nouns, i. e. the semantic range of adjectives, which can be used to distinguish the various meanings of an adjective. The semantic ranges of full 'full' and tom 'empty' are described and compared in a case study. It is found that the semantic ranges of the words overlap only in the so-called container sense while only full is used in the so-called <b>rod</b> <b>sense.</b> The polysemy of the words and their diverging semantic ranges may explain why the two words do not co-occur significantly more often than expected, as other direct antonyms do. A case study of stor 'large' and 28 synonyms of stor describes the semantic ranges of the 29 words. The words were organised according to the most frequently modified semantic category of each word. This grouping was used as a basis to distinguish groups of synonyms, so called synsets, and to code the words in the Swedish WordNet. Four meanings of stor were distinguished: concrete dimension, importance, countable quantity, and uncountable quantity. The most frequent meaning found in corpora was not the core meaning, concrete dimension, which was outnumbered by both countable quantity and uncountable quantity. A study of the early use of stor in children shows that they in fact only use stor in the concrete-dimension sense, validating that this is the core meaning of stor. An explanation of the semantic shift of stor from the central meaning to importance, countable quantity, and uncountable quantity is suggested within a cognitive semantic framework. Various computer programs facilitating research such as presented in this book is also described...|$|R
