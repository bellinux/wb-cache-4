50|$|During the dormant season, or when green {{vegetation}} {{is covered}} with snow, eastern cottontails consume twigs, buds, and bark of woody vegetation. In Connecticut important winter foods include gray birch (Betula populifolia), red maple, and <b>smooth</b> <b>sumac</b> (Rhus glabra).|$|E
5000|$|Transition Zone (6,500 to 8,000 feet) - With mild {{summers and}} cold winters, the {{temperate}} Transition Zone {{is characterized by}} many plants common to the Rocky Mountains. Ponderosa pine, deciduous Gambel oak, <b>smooth</b> <b>sumac,</b> maples, and other mountain species grow in the upper canyon.|$|E
50|$|Rhus glabra, the <b>smooth</b> <b>sumac,</b> (also {{known as}} white sumac, upland sumac, or scarlet sumac) is {{a species of}} sumac in the family Anacardiaceae, native to North America, from {{southern}} Quebec west to southern British Columbia in Canada, and south to northern Florida and Arizona in the United States and Tamaulipas in northeastern Mexico.|$|E
50|$|By extension, {{the name}} was also applied by the colonial European hunters, traders, and {{settlers}} to various shrubs of which the bark or leaves {{are used in the}} mixture, most often Bearberry (Arctostaphylos spp.) and to lesser degree, Red Osier Dogwood (Cornus sericea) and Silky Cornel (Cornus amomum), and even to Canadian Bunchberry (Cornus canadensis), Evergreen Sumac (Rhus virens), Littleleaf Sumac (Rhus microphylla), <b>Smooth</b> <b>Sumac</b> (Rhus glabra), and Staghorn Sumac (Rhus typhina).|$|E
5000|$|In North America, the <b>smooth</b> <b>sumac</b> (R. glabra) and the staghorn sumac (R. typhina) are {{sometimes}} {{used to make}} a beverage termed [...] "sumac-ade", [...] "Indian lemonade", or [...] "rhus juice". This drink is made by soaking the drupes in cool water, rubbing them to extract the essence, straining the liquid through a cotton cloth, and sweetening it. Native Americans also use the leaves and drupes of the smooth and staghorn sumacs combined with tobacco in traditional smoking mixtures.|$|E
50|$|This plant {{grows in}} the canyons of the Snake, Salmon, and Imnaha Rivers in western Idaho and far eastern Oregon. The sandy soil overlies talus, and the often steep canyon slopes are easily eroded. The habitat is dry and {{relatively}} warm native grassland with some shrubs. Common grasses include bluebunch wheatgrass (Agropyron spicatum), sand dropseed (Sporobolus cryptandrus), and pine bluegrass (Poa secunda). Other plants in the habitat include yellow alyssum (Alyssum alyssoides), yarrow (Achillea millefolium), tufted evening primrose (Oenothera caespitosa), <b>smooth</b> <b>sumac</b> (Rhus glabra), rubber rabbitbrush (Chrysothamnus nauseosus), and hackberry (Celtis reticulata).|$|E
50|$|One of {{the easiest}} shrubs to {{identify}} throughout the year (unless mistaken for Toxicodendron vernix (formerly Rhus vernix), poison sumac, {{in the absence of}} mature fruit) <b>smooth</b> <b>sumac</b> has a spreading, open-growing shrub growing up to 3 m tall, rarely to 5 m. The leaves are alternate, 30-50 cm long, compound with 11-31 leaflets, each leaflet 5-11 cm long, with a serrated margin. The leaves turn scarlet in the fall. The flowers are tiny, green, produced in dense erect panicles 10 - 25 cm tall, in the spring, later followed by large panicles of edible crimson berries that remain throughout the winter. The buds are small, covered with brown hair and borne on fat, hairless twigs. The bark on older wood is smooth and grey to brown.|$|E
5000|$|The species produce galls on the staghorn sumac (Rhus typhina), {{an eastern}} North American variety of sumac, {{and they are}} also found on the <b>smooth</b> <b>sumac</b> (Rhus glabra). The gall is {{variously}} called [...] "sumac leaf gall" [...] and [...] "red pouch gall" [...] as it sometimes appears red in colour. The galls occur when female aphids lay a single egg {{on the underside of}} the sumac leaf, inducing the leaf to form a sac over the egg. According to Hebert et al, the eggs [...] "give rise to a series of parthenogenetic generations, which remain within the gall. Winged females leave the gall in late summer and fly to moss, where they establish asexually reproducing colonies. The colonies produce the males and sexual females responsible for recolonizing sumac each spring." [...] In 1989, it was reported that the use of alternate plant hosts by the aphids dates from 48 million years before present. When identified, this was the oldest known documented insect-plant relationship; much older relationships have subsequently been discovered. See more at Paleoparasitology.|$|E
40|$|We {{waited until}} June to allow new <b>smooth</b> <b>sumac</b> shoots to grow above the prairie plants before wiping the {{herbicide}} {{directly onto the}} <b>smooth</b> <b>sumac</b> foliage (Figure 2). When the tallest prairie grasses were about 0. 5 m tall, the rope wick was set at a height of about 0. 7 m. Where <b>smooth</b> <b>sumac</b> was dense, we had to drive slowly or make an immediate second application perpendicular to the first to apply an adequate amount of herbicide for control. The label guidelines need to be followed, but the herbicide concentration is greater (about 2 : 1 or 3 : 1 ratio of water to herbicide) for a rope wick application than for a broadcast application. Since all tested herbicides controlled <b>smooth</b> <b>sumac,</b> herbicide selection can be based on cost. We coupled <b>smooth</b> <b>sumac</b> control on Nine Mile Prairie with the three-year prescribed burning rotation. Each year, we shredded the sumac and applied the herbicide to the <b>smooth</b> <b>sumac</b> in the burned portion of the prairie. Before treatment, some portions of the prairie had a nearly com-plete overstory of <b>smooth</b> <b>sumac.</b> Those areas were returned to open prairie. We estimated 95 %â€“ 98 % overall control of <b>smooth</b> <b>sumac</b> on Nine Mile Prairie, and we expect to have to repeat the control measures in five to eight years...|$|E
40|$|<b>Smooth</b> <b>sumac</b> (Rhus glabra L.) is a resprouting shrub {{native to}} the tallgrass prairie region that {{increases}} in density without an active disturbance regime. Our objective was to use prescribed fire and herbicides to decrease <b>smooth</b> <b>sumac</b> density as a strategy to improve a degraded tall grass prairie remnant. In two separate experiments repeated in space and time, we used prescribed fire in combination with herbicides at various rates and two application methods to develop an effective management scheme for reducing <b>smooth</b> <b>sumac.</b> We used a randomized complete block design with 13 herbicide treatments and a control with three replicates in burned and non-burned areas. Results were similar in both experiments in which herbicide treatment and burning were the significant main effects. All herbicide treatments reduced <b>smooth</b> <b>sumac</b> stem density compared to the control, but no distinct advantage was detected regarding specific herbicide, application rate, or whether the herbicide was applied as a broadcast spray or with a hand-held wick. We expected burning to make the plant more susceptible to herbicides, but burning increased stem density. In this tallgrass prairie remnant, we determined that herbicides were the most effective management tool in reducing <b>smooth</b> <b>sumac</b> stem density...|$|E
40|$|The {{herbicide}} 2, 4 -D LV 4 ester provides excellent low-cost <b>smooth</b> <b>sumac</b> control. Prescribed burning before {{herbicide application}} does not substantially improve sumac control, but may ease herbicide application and provide other benefits. <b>Smooth</b> <b>sumac</b> (Rhus glabra L.) {{is a native}} deciduous shrub that forms dense thickets from widely spreading roots. It {{is found in the}} Sandhills, mixed-grass, and tallgrass areas throughout Nebraska. Introduced cool-season grasses, such as Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis L.), invade the thickets, and production of desirable forage species is reduced below the dense canopies. Trees and other shrubs readily establish in aging sumac thickets, accelerating the conversion of grassland to woodland. Small amounts of <b>smooth</b> <b>sumac</b> may be desirable because it provides wildlife habitat and food and has attractive fall foliage...|$|E
40|$|Patterns {{of plant}} {{community}} organization in 35 hill prairies from northeast Iowa were studied. The influence of grazing, woody species invasion and habitat factors on diversity and dominant species distribution was also investigated. The invasive {{process of the}} prairies by Juniperus virginiana was assessed by studying spatial distribution, age and size structure of four populations under different ecological conditions;The results indicate that hill prairies from northeast Iowa {{are part of a}} continuum that connects them to the tall grass prairie that once covered Iowa. They make up the driest part of the gradient and converge in structure with those hill prairies in Wisconsin, Illinois and Minnesota;Five community-types were distinguished and described. Andropogon gerardii, A. scoparius, Sporobolus heterolepis and Bouteloua curtipendula, the most important grasses, as well as <b>smooth</b> <b>sumac</b> Rhus glabra, behave differently under various conditions of topography, moisture availability and grazing intensity. Invasion of hill prairies by <b>smooth</b> <b>sumac</b> seems to be related with fire suppression. <b>Smooth</b> <b>sumac</b> is probably involved in a facilitation-like mechanism that promotes the establishment of eastern red cedar, Juniperus virginiana, when grazing is eliminated. Progressive or massive invasions of hill prairies by eastern red cedar can culminate in closed communities with total elimination of prairie species...|$|E
40|$|White-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) {{populations have}} in the past, and {{continue}} today, to increase in the Great Plains and North America. However, their impact on native plant species and endangered ecosystems such as the tallgrass prairie is poorly documented. To better understand the consequences of increasing deer numbers for native shrubs in grasslands, we assessed {{the extent of their}} summer browsing activity on six shrub species (wild plum, rough-leaved dogwood, <b>smooth</b> <b>sumac,</b> fragrant sumac, and coralberry) along transects that spanned riparian margins to upland tallgrass prairie. The proportion of terminal shoots browsed was quantified along established white-tail deer trails and in parallel transects off trails in watersheds that varied in fire history at the Konza Prairie Biological Station (Kansas). Proximity to deer trails was a strong determinant of deer browsing activity. Along trails, 20 % of the twigs surveyed (N = 60, 032) were browsed, whereas off trails less than I % of twigs (N = 14, 785) were browsed. Coralberry and rough-leaved dogwood comprised 80 % of the shrub cover along trails, whereas wild plum, prickly ash, <b>smooth</b> <b>sumac,</b> and fragrant sumac had less cover, in that order. However, browsing was greatest on wild plum and rough-leaved dogwood (between 40 % and 50 % of available twigs), and the proportion of twigs browsed out of the total twigs used was highest for rough-leaved dogwood. Based on preference ratios (use/ abundance), white-tail deer are likely to have the greatest impact on the less common wild plum and <b>smooth</b> <b>sumac</b> as well as rough-leaved dogwood. Interestingly, white-tail deer avoided the most common shrub, coralberry, at this time of year. Our results suggest that even in summer, when deer tend also to forage on herbaceous species in grasslands, deer browsing may have significant local impacts on woody species of tallgrass prairies in the Great Plains. Concurrent increases in woody plant cover and abundance in grasslands throughout the Great Plains suggest that deer browsing is not yet intense enough to prevent shrub expansion into tallgrass prairie...|$|E
30|$|The {{study was}} {{conducted}} from 2011 â€“ 2013 in tallgrass prairie in Ringgold County, Iowa in the Grand River Grasslands (GRG) of Iowa, USA (40 Â° 34 â€™N, 94 Â° 10 â€™W). The GRG is in the glaciated plains of the Central Tallgrass Prairie Ecoregion and {{has been described as}} one of the premier places to restore a functioning tallgrass prairie ecosystem (Missouri Department of Conservation [2010]). Annual precipitation was 968 Â mm in 2011 (+ 97 Â mm above long-term mean), 798 Â mm in 2012 (âˆ’ 73 Â mm below long-term mean), 874 Â mm in 2013 (+ 3 Â mm above long-term mean and averaged 870 Â mm during the three year study (+ 1 Â mm above long-term mean) (Iowa Environmental Mesonet [2014]). Soils are loess hills with glacial till side slopes with slopes in some areas exceeding 9 %. Subsoils have high clay content ranging from 42 to 48 % and native vegetation was tallgrass prairie (USDA NRCS [2013]). Herbaceous vegetation across all study pastures was dominated by perennial C 4 graminoids (Andropogon gerardii (big bluestem), Schizacyrium scoparium (little bluestem), and Sorghastrum nutans (Indiangrass) with a component of exotic C 3 graminoids and legumes (Schedonorus arundinacea (tall fescue), Bromus inermis (smooth brome), Lotus corniculatus (birdsfoot trefoil), and Trifolium spp. (clover). In these study pastures, S. orbiculatus was the most common shrub regardless of the spatial scale of assessment and occurred more often than any other shrub species including Rhus glabra (<b>smooth</b> <b>sumac),</b> Rosa multiflora (multiflora rose), Cornus drummondii (dogwood), Prunus spp. (plum) and Rubus spp. (raspberry) (Scasta [2014]).|$|E
40|$|A prairie site at Pipestone National Monument {{in southwestern}} Minnesota was burned each spring from 1983 - 1987. During {{the past century}} of use, much of the site had been invaded by various, non-native, cool-season grasses and {{broadleaf}} weeds. Also, various woody species have invaded parts of the site. Annual bums generally induced positive changes in native remnants, primarily with big bluestem (Andropogon gerardii Vitman) and prairie dropseed (Sporobolus heterolepis A. Gray) increasing cover from 6. 4 to 21. 0 %. Cover of native forbs also increased, from 6. 5 to 12. 8 %, due to increased vigor of existing plants and establishment of new individuals. While some tree and shrub species were pennanently damaged, wild plum (Prunus americana Marsh), chokecherry (Prunus virginiana L.), and <b>smooth</b> <b>sumac</b> (Rhus glabra L.) re-sprouted from underground parts each year {{and were able to}} maintain or slightly increase pre-bum cover levels, although stature was reduced. Dense stands of quackgrass (Agropyron repens Beauv.) were reduced in height and vigor, but, unlike stands dominated by other species, were not open to establishment of prairie species. In general, while prescribed burning triggered increases of diversity, cover, and vigor of native prairie species, this was not a uniform effect across the site as most changes occurred within and along the edges of existing prairie remnants. Essentially no changes were observed within the large stands of quackgrass in which additional suppression of the sod is required, which could be accomplished by delay of spring burning, summer mowing, and plantings of native plant materials...|$|E

40|$|The stems {{are fairly}} densely armed with {{straight}} or hooked prickles, {{some of which}} are strongly flattened. The leaves are compound with toothed margins and essentially glabrous on both surfaces. The leaves on flowering stems are in groups of three and the petioles are armed with prickles. On first year stems the leaves are often in groups of five with the lower two lacking petioles. The flowers are white and loosely clustered at the ends of the branches. The fruit is a moderately succulent, blackish, raspberry-like, glabrous drupelet. Identification Tips: R. nigerrimus is very similar to R. leucodermis, which occupies the same geographic area. The former can be distinguished most readily by its leaves, which are glabrous on both surfaces, rather than pubescent on the underside. Phenology: Blooms in May and early June. Fruits begin to ripen in late June. By mid-July most fruits are mature or overmature. Range: Local endemic, restricted to an area approximately 20 by 4 miles along the Snake River in Whitman and Garfield cos., WA in the Columbia Basin physiographic province. Habitat: Occurs primarily along the bottom of steep, narrow drainages and somewhat moist areas on adjacent slopes on tributaries to the Snake River in the bluebunch wheatgrass/ Sandbergâ€™s bluegrass association of Daubenmire (1970). Soils are generally derived from loess, volcanic ash, and weathered basalt. The associated vegetation typically consists of other shrubs, forbs, and grasses, with an occasional hardwood overstory component. Associated species include Lewisâ€™s mockorange (Philadelphus lewisii), Himalayan blackberry (Rubus discolor), whitebark raspberry (Rubus leucodermis), <b>smooth</b> <b>sumac</b> (Rhus glabra), willow (Salix sp.), Woodâ€™s rose (Rosa woodsii), black cottonwood (Populus tricocarpa), black hawthorn (Crataegus douglasii), oceanspray (Holodiscus discolor), and stinging nettle (Urtica dioica).
