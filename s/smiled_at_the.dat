500|$|In {{the opening}} match of the tour, a draw against North Zone, Hassett made 73. In a high-scoring match in hot {{conditions}} against the Prince's XI in Delhi, he struck 187 and 124 not out in Australia's 8/424 declared and 5/304. The team {{was scheduled to}} play East Zone in Calcutta, but the city was gripped in deadly riots as independence activists agitated against British rule. Australia batted first and made only 107, before East Zone replied with 131. Led by Hassett's 125, Australia posted 304 to leave the hosts a target of 281. On the final day, pro-independence rioters broke through the security presence and invaded the pitch {{for the second time}} during the match, while East Zone were batting. East Zone batsman Denis Compton told the rioters to talk to Hassett, saying that the Australian skipper controlled proceedings. Hassett <b>smiled</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> leader of the irate demonstrators and asked [...] "You wouldn't happen to have a cigarette, would you, old boy?" [...] The rioters calmed down and play resumed.|$|E
500|$|The {{team was}} {{scheduled}} to play East Zone, but the city was gripped in deadly riots as independence activists agitated against British rule. The match went ahead, but on the first day, thousands of protestors invaded the pitch, interrupting play for an hour. Elsewhere in the city, 23 people were killed. Miller scored only 17 and one, both times dismissed by Chandu Sarwate, and did not bowl. On the final day, Miller's friend Compton, who was playing for East Zone while on deployment with the British Army in India, was nearing a century as his team closed in on victory. The rioters broke through the security presence and invaded the pitch again. The leader of the demonstrators ran up to Compton and said: [...] "Mr Compton, you very good player, but you must stop". In later years, Miller would quote this remark whenever Compton came to the crease in matches featuring both of them. Compton told the rioters to ask Hassett, saying that the Australian skipper controlled proceedings. Hassett <b>smiled</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> leader of the irate demonstrators and asked [...] "You wouldn't {{happen to have a}} cigarette, would you, old boy?" [...] The rioters calmed down and play resumed. Compton brought up his century with the winning runs. In 2005, the ECB and Cricket Australia decided that the player adjudged the Player of the Series in the Ashes would be awarded the Compton-Miller Medal, recognising their friendship and rivalry.|$|E
2500|$|The years which {{followed}} {{were those of}} a maturation of her vocation. Thérèse prayed without great sensitive emotions, she multiplied the small acts of charity and care for others, doing small services, without making a show of them. She accepted criticism in silence, even unjust criticisms, and <b>smiled</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> sisters who were unpleasant to her. She prayed always much for priests, and in particular for Father Hyacinthe Loyson, a famous preacher {{who had been a}} Sulpician and a Dominican novice before becoming a Carmelite and provincial of his order, but who had left the Catholic Church in 1869. Three years later he married a young Protestant widow, with whom he had a son. After excommunication had been pronounced against him, he continued to travel round France giving lectures. While clerical papers called Loyson a [...] "renegade monk" [...] and Leon Bloy lampooned him, Thérèse prayed for her [...] "brother". She offered her last communion, 19 August 1897, for Father Loyson.|$|E

2500|$|Following the 1904 Olympics, Rose bested Coe {{again at}} an event hosted by the Boston Athletic Association. [...] Coe {{reportedly}} became determined to break Rose's world record and [...] "labored faithfully to perfect his style." [...] In February 1905, a large crowd was drawn to watch Coe at the indoor games of the Lawrence Light Guard Athletic Association held in the armory at Medford, Massachusetts. [...] Rose attended the event as a guest and wished Coe luck before his first toss. [...] Coe fell short of the record on his first four throws. [...] As Coe prepared for his final throw, Rose said, [...] "Come on now, old boy, you are in grand form this evening, and {{with just a little}} more power on your next put, you ought to place my mark well in the shade." [...] The Boston Globe described the final throw as follows:"Coe <b>smiled</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> encouraging remark of his famous rival, and then made steady for his final put. [...] The padded shot was carefully poised in his right hand, a firm grip was secured and then, with a lightning-like hop and spring, he drove the ball down the half. [...] He secured splendid altitude, and when it dropped beyond his previous mark, Rose exclaimed, 'You've got it, Coe, and I congratulate you.'" ...|$|E
