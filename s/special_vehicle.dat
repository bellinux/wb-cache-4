25|$|The {{creation}} of the Komodo first started on October 26, 2011 when President Yudhoyono personally visited a PT Indonesian Aerospace weapon system exhibition. During his visit, he gave a challenge to Pindad's Product Development Team to make an indigenous 4×4 tactical vehicle. Pindad's <b>Special</b> <b>Vehicle</b> Division technicians bore the responsibility to make the said vehicle. In the course of developing the vehicle, Pindad looked at other armored tactical vehicles that were being produced and sold such as the Armored Multi-Purpose Vehicle, the Nexter Aravis and the Sherpa Light family. During the visit, PT Pindad president Adik Aviantono Sudarsono was told to prepare on the production process of the vehicle when President Yudhoyono requested Pindad to have a working prototype ready in two months after his visit. Production of the Komodo was based at Pindad's factory in Bandung, West Java. The {{creation of}} a working Komodo prototype was completed in March 2012.|$|E

25|$|For 2007, Ford's <b>Special</b> <b>Vehicle</b> Team {{launched}} Shelby GT500, {{a successor}} to the 2003/2004 Mustang SVT Cobra. The GT500 shared basic design characteristics {{with that of the}} Mustang V6 and GT. It retained the same basic live axle rear suspension setup of the Mustang V6 and GT, with some minor durability enhancements such as thicker sheetmetal supports and extra welds, as well as redesigned strut towers to accommodate a wider engine. The supercharged 5.4L 32-valve DOHC V8 engine with an iron block and aluminum heads was rated at 500hp (373kW) @ 6000rpm and 480lb·ft (650N·m) of torque @ 4500rpm. The Tremec TR6060 6-speed manual transmission used a 3.31:1 rear drive ratio. Wheels are 18×9.5inch with P255/45ZR18 tires in the front and P285/40ZR18 tires in the rear. Brembo 14-inch disc brakes with aluminum four-piston calipers are on the front with 11.8-inch disc brakes with single-piston calipers in the rear.|$|E
25|$|The {{market was}} forced to restructure. An ambitious plan {{entitled}} Reconstruction and Renewal was produced in 1995, with proposals for separating the ongoing Lloyd's from its past losses. Liability for all pre-1993 business was to be compulsorily transferred (by RITC) into a <b>special</b> <b>vehicle</b> named Equitas (which would require {{the approval of the}} UK's Department of Trade & Industry (DTI)) at a cost of around $21bn. Many Names faced large bills, but the plan also provided for a settlement of their disputes, a tax on recent profits, and the write-off of nearly $5bn of debts, skewed towards those with the most severe losses. The plan was debated at length, modified, and eventually strongly supported by the Association of Lloyd's Members (ALM) and most leaders of Names' action groups. Money was raised in many ways, including the sale and leaseback of the Lloyd's building, and a tax on future business. Individual offers were accepted by 95 per cent of Lloyd's names. The past liabilities of all Names were transferred to Equitas in September 1996.|$|E

2500|$|Walt Disney had a {{longtime}} interest in transportation, and trains in particular. Disney's {{passion for the}} [...] "iron horse" [...] led to him building a miniature live steam backyard railroad—the [...] "Carolwood Pacific Railroad"—on the grounds of his Holmby Hills estate. Throughout all the iterations of Disneyland during the seventeen or so years when Disney was conceiving it, one element remained constant: a train encircling the park.

2500|$|The [...] Series II Station Wagon {{introduced}} a twelve-seater option {{on top of}} the standard ten-seater layout. This was primarily to take advantage of UK tax laws, by which a vehicle with 12 seats or more was classed as a bus, and was exempt from Purchase Tax and <b>Special</b> <b>Vehicle</b> Tax. This made the twelve-seater not only cheaper to buy than the 10-seater version, but also cheaper than the seven-seater [...] Station Wagon. The twelve-seater layout remained a highly popular body style for decades, being retained on the later Series and Defender variants until 2002, when it was dropped. The unusual status of the twelve-seater remained until the endsuch vehicles were classed as minibuses and thus could use bus lanes and (if registered correctly) could be exempt from the London Congestion Charge.|$|E
