50|$|The <b>straight</b> <b>key</b> {{is simple}} and reliable, but the rapid pumping action needed to send a string of dots (or dits as most {{operators}} call them) poses some significant drawbacks.

In {{the early days of}} telegraphy, a number of professional telegraphers developed a repetitive stress injury known as glass arm or telegrapher's paralysis. ‘Glass arm’ or ‘Telegrapher's paralysis’ may be reduced or eliminated by increasing the side play of the <b>straight</b> <b>key</b> by loosening the adjustable trunnion screws.

50|$|With <b>straight</b> <b>keys,</b> side-swipers, and, to an extent, bugs, {{each and}} every telegraphist {{has his or her}} own unique style and pattern when {{transmitting}} a message. An operator's style is known as his ‘fist’. To other telegraphers, every fist is unique, and can be used to identify the telegrapher transmitting a particular message. This had a huge significance in the world wars, as it could be used to track the location of individual ships and submarines. See traffic analysis. However, electronic keyers (single paddle or iambic) will produce ‘perfect’ Morse at a set speed, thus only inter-character and inter-word spacing can produce a semblance of a fist.|$|R

50|$|A <b>straight</b> <b>key</b> is {{the common}} {{telegraph}} key as seen in various movies. It is a simple bar with a knob on top and a contact underneath. When the bar is depressed against spring tension, it forms a circuit and allows electricity to flow. Traditionally, American telegraph keys had flat topped knobs and narrow bars (frequently curved). British telegraph keys had ball shaped knobs and thick bars. This appears to be purely a matter of culture and training, but the users of each are tremendously partisan. Straight keys {{have been made in}} numerous variations for over 150 years and in numerous countries. They are the subject of an avid community of key collectors. The straight keys used in wire telegraphy also had a shorting bar that closed the electrical circuit when the operator was not actively sending messages. This was to complete the electrical path to the next station so that its sounder would operate, as in the operator receiving a message from the next town. Although occasionally included in later keys for reasons of tradition, the shorting bar is unnecessary for radio telegraphy, except as a convenience when tuning the transmitter.|$|E

50|$|Meanwhile, Citra starts {{flirting with}} Aldi, {{although}} he notices {{none of her}} various manoeuvres. Aldi decides he will lie no longer, and when his parents come to dinner, he comes out to them. His father has an asthma attack, such is his shock and disgust, and his mother leaves with his father, urging Aldi to revert to how he used to be. Things further come to a head when Citra and Key walk in on the two men as they are kissing. But instead of admitting {{it was all a}} deception, Nesta states that he really is in love with Key. Nesta has turned truly chocolate (or <b>straight).</b> <b>Key</b> initially rejects Nesta for lying to her, but returns to him after having run through the Jakarta night to stop him before he leaves forever. So it seems we have the conclusion: Nesta is turned straight by the charms of the pretty Key; Citra is still alone due to her distrust of men; Aldi is also to spend his life alone as a sad but out homosexual. However, in the final scene, as is demanded by romantic comedies, everyone is provided with a partner: Citra wins the attention of a cool rocker at a pop concert, and then Aldi appears hand in hand with Citra’s boss, Dani. Incidentally, the punk-looking Dani is played by Fauzi Baadila, one of Indonesia’s most in-demand young actors, someone generally associated with far more macho roles.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. The Eastern Greenland case (1931 – 33) is {{the only}} {{territorial}} dispute in the polar regions ever to have been decided by an international court. Norway challenged Denmark’s claim to sovereignty over all of Greenland {{on the grounds that}} Denmark had established effective occupation in a limited area only. The Permanent Court of International Justice (PCIJ) held that effective occupation in the polar regions requires relatively little actual exercise of sovereign rights, and that Denmark therefore did indeed have sovereignty over the entire island. Both parties in the dispute based many of their arguments on historical evidence, most notably the records of a series of diplomatic overtures to other states made by Denmark between 1915 and 1921. These documents, the Norwegians argued, showed that the Danes themselves did not believe that they had sovereignty over the entire island. The Danes, on the other hand, contended that their sovereignty dated back to the Middle Ages. The Court found the Danish arguments more convincing. However, the dissenting opinion of Justice Dionisio Anzilotti upheld the Norwegian interpretation. This paper re-examines the issue in the light of historical evidence, found recently in Canadian archives, that was not available to the Court. These new documents indicate that Anzilotti’s view was the correct one. While the 1933 decision in favour of Denmark can be upheld on other than historical grounds, a re-assessment of the historical evidence and arguments presented to the PCIJ is essential to set the record <b>straight.</b> <b>Key</b> words: sovereignty, Eastern Greenland, polar regions RÉSUMÉ.

40|$|Abstract. Although {{the process}} of {{establishing}} a memory of a location is necessary for navigation, relatively {{little is known about}} the information that humans use when forming place memories. We examined the relative importance of distance and angular information about landmarks in place learning. Participants repeatedly learned a target location in relation to three distinct landmarks in an immersive computer-generated (virtual) environment. Later, during testing, they attempted to return to that location. The configurations of landmarks used during testing were altered from those participants learned in order to separate the effects of metric distance information and information about inter-landmark angles. In general, participants showed greater reliance on distance information than angular information. This reliance was affected by nonmetric relationships present during learning, as well as by the degree to which the learned environment contained right or <b>straight</b> angles. <b>Key</b> words: landmarks, landmark-based navigation, place learning, virtual environments, virtual realit...|$|R

5000|$|Swing: The kettlebell swing (sometimes {{called the}} Russian swing to {{distinguish}} it from the American swing) is a basic ballistic exercise used to train the posterior chain {{in a manner similar}} to broad jumping. The kettlebell is swung from just below the groin to somewhere between the upper abdomen and shoulders, with arms nearly <b>straight.</b> The <b>key</b> to a good kettlebell swing is effectively thrusting the hips, not bending too much at the knees and sending the weight forwards, as opposed to squatting the weight up, or lifting up with the arms. This requires an intense contraction of the gluteal, abdominal and latissimus muscles. The swing can also be performed with a release and catch of the kettlebell, which helps train the proper swing pattern where the arms aren't pulling up at the top. This can be done with two hands switching to a supinated catch. The one-arm swing presents a significant anti-twisting challenge, and can be used with an alternating catch switching between arms. Further variations include the walking swing taking a step forward at the apex of each swing, the outside swing where the kettlebell swings outside the leg, and the kneeling swing, swinging between the legs in a one-leg half-kneeling position.|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} to critically examine {{the value of}} the curled Tenckhoff catheter for continuous ambulatory peritineal dialysis (CAPD) access with respect to the incidence of catheter-related complications. In the setting of a prospective, randomised, double-blind comparison, we were unable to demonstrate any advantage of the curled Tenckhoff catheter over the conventional <b>straight</b> type. <b>KEY</b> WORDS: Curled Tenckhoff catheter; straight Tenckhoff catheter. C ontinuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) is an increasingly popular mode of treatment for end-stage renal failure. While less than 20 % of dialysis patients in the United Kingdom were being maintained on CAPD in December 1981 (1), this figure had risen to 41 % by December 1986 (2). We have shared a similar experience in our own unit, where in September 1988, 60 % of the dialysis population were on CAPD. Mechanical problems related to the catheters remain an important source of complications in CAPD patients, exceeded in frequency only by peritonitis. One recent development addressing this problem has been the introduction of catheters with curled tips. Anticipated benefits of this new design feature were lessening of abdominal discomfort by decreasing the jet effect of dialysate inflow and a reduction in the incidence of catheter migration (3). Previous studies comparing different types of catheters have produced conflicting results and have consisted mainly of retro-spective analyses (4 - 8). In view of the lack of a clear consensus of opinion in the literature, we formulated a randomised, prospective, double-blind study to compare curled catheters with conventional straight catheters...|$|R
40|$|We have {{recently}} shown that in non-equilibrium spin systems at criticality {{the limit of}} the fluctuation-dissipation ratio X(t,tw) for t >> tw >> 1 can be measured using observables such as magnetization or energy [Phys.
