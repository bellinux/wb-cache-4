40|$|This study {{evaluated}} the ISO 5353 <b>Seat</b> <b>Index</b> <b>Point</b> Tool (SIPT) {{as an alternative}} to the SAE J 826 H-point manikin for measuring military seats. A tool was fabricated based on the ISO specification and a custom backangle measurement probe was designed and fitted to the SIPT. Comparisons between the two tools in a wide range of seating conditions showed that the mean SIP location was 5 mm aft of the H-point, with a standard deviation of 7. 8 mm. Vertical location was not significantly different between the two tools (mean - 0. 7 mm, sd 4. 0 mm). A high correlation (r= 0. 9) was observed between the back angle measurements from the two tools. The SIPT was slightly more repeatable across installations and installers than the J 826 manikin, with most of the discrepancy arising from situations with flat seat cushion angles and either unusually upright or reclined back angles that caused the J 826 manikin to be unstable. The investigators who performed the measurements indicated that the SIPT was easier to use. The data show that the SIPT is a reasonable substitute for the SAE J 826 manikin when ease-of-use considerations favor the SIPT, such as restricted space around the seat, low seat heights, or low cushion angles. Human posture measurements in seats with large discrepancies between the tools will be needed to determine which provides a better prediction of sitter position...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: A {{system to}} measure the {{visibility}} of agricultural tractor operators was designed and evaluated according to ISO standards, and a blind area diagram around the tested tractor was created based on the manual method recommended by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). Methods: A visibility measurement system was designed and evaluated based on the ISO 5006 and ISO 5721 - 1 standards. Two bulbs used to simulate the operator's eyes were mounted on a bar with a supporting frame. A wooden frame {{was used to determine}} the <b>seat</b> <b>index</b> <b>point</b> position. The 12 -m visibility test circle was divided into six sectors of vision, and the test tractor was placed {{at the center of the}} circle. Artificial light was supplied in the darkened environment, and shadow or masking effects were measured manually around the 12 -m circle. Results: When the bulbs were placed at the operator’s eye level, front visibility was good; no masking was found in the “A ” vision sector, but larger masking widths were found in the “B ” and “C ” vision sectors. Since the masking width exceeded 700 mm, additional tests, such as movement of the light sources to both sides of the operator’s eye level, were performed. Less than six masking effects were found in the semi-circle of vision to the front, and more than one masking was found in the “B ” and “C ” visual fields. The minimum distance between the centers of two masking effects exceeded 2500 mm when measured as a chord on the semi-circle of vision. A blind area diagram was created to define the exact nature of the blind spots and mirror visibility. Conclusions: Visibility evaluation is an effective way to enable proper and safe operation for agricultural tractor operators. Inclusion of this visibility evaluation test in the general testing process might aid tracto...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: We {{investigated}} {{the effect of}} tidal-range change and sediment compaction on reconstructions of Holocene relative sea level (RSL) in New Jersey, USA. We updated a published sea-level database to generate 50 sea-level <b>index</b> <b>points</b> and ten limiting dates that define continuously rising RSL in New Jersey during the Holocene. There is scatter among the <b>index</b> <b>points,</b> particularly those older than 7 ka. A numerical model estimated that paleotidal range was relatively constant during the mid and late Holocene, but rapidly increased between 9 and 8 ka, leading to an underestimation of RSL by 0. 5 m. We adjusted the sea-level <b>index</b> <b>points</b> using the paleotidal model prior to assessing the influence of compaction on organic samples with clastic deposits above and below (an intercalated sea-level <b>index</b> <b>point).</b> We found a significant relationship (p 0. 01) with {{the thickness of the}} overburden (r 0. 85). We altered the altitude of intercalated <b>index</b> <b>points</b> using this simple stratigraphic relationship, which reduced vertical scatter in sea-level reconstructions.

Diatom and pollen analyses and radiocarbon dating have been undertaken for three sampling sites, from which eight sea-level <b>index</b> <b>points</b> have been obtained. These <b>index</b> <b>points</b> come from a small homogeneous area and similar palaeoenvironments. Some published sea-level <b>index</b> <b>points</b> from Morecambe Bay have been re-evaluated and validated by means of diatom analysis. An enhanced sea-level database with 28 <b>index</b> <b>points</b> {{has been used for}} the reconstruction of Holocene sea-level history. Relative sea-level rose rapidly around 6870 - 6510 BC at a maximum rate of + 36. 7 mm yr- 1. Subsequently, the rate of sea-level change has varied between - 8 mm yr- 1 and + 12 mm yr- 1. The rate of relative sea-level changes for the last 3500 years is not clear. Uplift driven by deglaciation {{is believed to have been}} interrupted in the early Holocene by a rapid rise in relative sea-level.

40|$|A proper methodological {{approach}} of investigating Holocene sea level changes {{is a prerequisite}} in order that the sea-level <b>index</b> <b>points</b> can be useful and significant. This requires the correct identification of the indicative meaning. The indicative meaning of the sea level indicator {{is defined as the}} altitudinal relationship of the local environment in which it accumulated to the contemporaneous reference tide level. This study identifies the <b>index</b> <b>points</b> using the litho-, bio-, and chrono-stratigraphic approach. The sea level indicator is derived from the regressive contact of the intercalated peat and marine clastic sequence, while the indicative meaning is estimated based upon the relationship with the contemporary samples. The study was carried out at two contrasting coastal locations, the fossil sites from Meru and Mardi in Kelang in the west and Penur (north and south transects) in Kuantan in the east, while the contemporary sites are from various ecological environments from both areas. Microfossil analysis of pollen and diatoms indicates that the former are more applicable, and defined the changing microfossil assemblages within the regressive contact of the sea level indicator samples. Seven sea level <b>index</b> <b>points</b> are identified. The finding agrees to the general assumptions of high mid-Holocene sea level history in peninsular Malaysia.

This study aimed {{to examine the relationship}} between local meteorological conditions and online search trends for terms related to knee pain, hip pain, and arthritis. Five years of relative online search volumes for these terms were obtained for the 50 most populous cities in the contiguous United States, along with corresponding local weather data for temperature, relative humidity, barometric pressure, and precipitation. Methods from the climate econometrics literature were used to assess the casual impact of these meteorological variables on the relative volumes of searches for pain. For temperatures between - 5 °C and 30 °C, search volumes for hip pain increased by 12 <b>index</b> <b>points,</b> and knee pain increased by 18 <b>index</b> <b>points.</b> Precipitation had a negative effect on search volumes for these terms.

40|$|Holocene {{relative}} sea-level reconstructions {{provide information}} on differential land movements, palaeo-landscapes, occupational history, palaeo-ecology of coastal areas and are important for climate change studies. For The Netherlands most coastal regions have a well-established sea level curve. However, {{this is not the}} case for the Wadden area. Up until recently, there were not enough reliable <b>index</b> <b>points</b> to establish a separate curve for the Northern Netherlands. Van de Plassche (1982) assumed on the basis of the little basal peat data available (two <b>index</b> <b>points)</b> that the curve for the Western Netherlands was also applicable to the North of the country. Using a modelling approach, Kiden (2002) suggested a lower curve based on postglacial isostatic subsidence. The data to support such hypothesis was expanded recently to 15 <b>index</b> <b>points</b> as presented by Kiden & Vos (in prep). We now present data on a sea level curve valid for the Dutch Wadden area, based on published and previously unpublished data to a dataset of 49 basal peat 14 C samples.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} new late Holocene relative sea-level reconstructions in the Humber Estuary, {{and examines}} {{the relationship between}} sea-level change and the salinisation of the groundwater resource. Relative sea-level reconstructions were produced using lithological and biostratigraphical analyses from two sites. Single and multi-proxy transfer functions were developed using diatom and foraminifera training sets from three sites in the Humber Estuary, with the multi-proxy transfer function providing the best performance. However, {{the application of the}} transfer functions was limited by the availability of modern analogues and generally poor preservation of microfossils. Eight new sea-level <b>index</b> <b>points</b> were produced, providing constraints of relative sea-level change between 4022 - 1470 cal years BP. The reconstructions were consistent with existing data, offering new constraints for the previously identified expansion and contraction of estuarine conditions during the late Holocene. In the outer estuary, two sea-level <b>index</b> <b>points</b> provided a record for an expansion between 3395 - 3227 cal years BP not previously constrained by sea-level <b>index</b> <b>points.</b> In the inner estuary, the sea-level <b>index</b> <b>points</b> indicated an expansion of estuarine conditions at 4022 cal years BP. Two of the points now provide the youngest constraints for the inner estuary. Multiple sea level and groundwater abstraction scenarios for time periods in the past and future were undertaken using a numerical model. These determined the contribution of sea level and abstraction to changes in the groundwater and saline intrusion; sea-level rise increased saline waters within the aquifer, and abstraction induced additional saline intrusion. Future sea-level rise will also result in an increase in aquifer salinity. A lack of data and consensus over the current conditions of the aquifer and groundwater was identified, with significant further research across multiple disciplines required for sustainable management and use of the groundwater resource...|$|R
