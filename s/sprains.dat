5|$|People with OCD report activity-related {{pain that}} {{develops}} gradually. Individual complaints usually consist of mechanical symptoms including pain, swelling, catching, locking, popping noises, and buckling / giving way; the primary presenting symptom {{may be a}} restriction {{in the range of}} movement. Symptoms typically present within the initial weeks of stageI; however, the onset of stageII occurs within months and offers little time for diagnosis. The disease progresses rapidly beyond stageII, as OCD lesions quickly move from stable cysts or fissures to unstable fragments. Non-specific symptoms, caused by similar injuries such as <b>sprains</b> and strains, can delay a definitive diagnosis.|$|E

40|$|Objective: Ankle <b>sprain</b> is {{the most}} {{frequently}} occurring acute injury in tennis, accounting for 20 – 25 % of all injuries. In the current paper, we assess the cause of ankle <b>sprain</b> and suggest possibilities to be considered during diagnosis. Methods: We assessed a professional tennis player with a partial tear of the long peroneal tendon after an ankle <b>sprain</b> by physical exam, X-ray and MRI. Results: Conservative treatment by means of soft cast and propriocepsis training led to full recovery. Conclusion: Peroneal tendon disorders {{must be part of}} the differential diagnosis after ankle <b>sprain</b> in the professional athlete. A n ankle <b>sprain</b> {{is the most}} frequent occurring acute injury in tennis, accounting for 20 – 25 % of all injuries.

Obesity, smoking, weight gain during pregnancy, stress, poor physical condition, poor posture and poor sleeping position may also contribute to low back pain. A full list of possible causes includes many less common conditions. Physical causes may include osteoarthritis, degeneration of the discs between the vertebrae or a spinal disc herniation, broken vertebra(e) (such as from osteoporosis) or, rarely, an infection or tumor of the spine.|$|E
5|$|Health {{issues in}} American {{football}} comprise {{a large number}} of health risks associated with participating in the sport. Injuries are relatively common in American football, due to its nature as a full-contact game. Injuries occur during both practice and games. Several factors can affect the frequency of injuries: epidemiological studies have shown older players can be at a greater risk, while equipment and experienced coaches can reduce the risk of injury. Common injuries include strains, <b>sprains,</b> fractures, dislocations, and concussions. Concussions have become a concern, as they increase the risk of mental illnesses like dementia and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). In individual leagues like the National Football League (NFL) and National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), a public injury report is published containing all injured players on a team, their injury and the game-day status of each player.|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Since {{most studies}} on ankle <b>sprain</b> are medical and sports-related {{and not much}} {{epidemiologic}} and etiologic data {{from the general population}} exist in this field, the present study evaluates the relationship between Q angle and anthropometric measures with ankle <b>sprain</b> in the general population. Methods: In the present case-control study, all of the patients over 18 years age presenting to emergency departments (ED) of two educational Hospitals, complaining from ankle <b>sprain,</b> were evaluated during more than 1 year. A checklist consisting of demographic data, height, weight, body mass index (BMI), and history of ankle <b>sprain,</b> as well as degree of Q angle was filled for all participants. The correlation of mentioned variables with incidence of ankle <b>sprain</b> was calculated using SPSS 22. Results: 300 patients with ankle <b>sprain</b> were evaluated (53. 5 % male). Mean age of the patients was 37. 03 ± 14. 20 years. Mean weight, height, and BMI were 71. 71 ± 11. 26 (43 – 114), 168. 74 ± 8. 63 (143 – 190) and 25. 14 ± 3. 19 (18. 41 – 38. 95), respectively. Mean Q angle of the patients was 12. 78 ± 3. 19 degrees (5 – 23). There was a significant correlation between weight (p < 0. 001), BMI (p = 0. 001), history of <b>sprain</b> (r: 0. 26, p < 0. 001) and Q angle (p = 0. 002) with incidence of ankle <b>sprain.</b> In addition, there was a significant statistical correlation between weight (p = 0. 031), BMI (p = 0. 020) and Q angle (p = 0. 004) with history of ankle <b>sprain.</b> In patients with a history of ankle <b>sprain,</b> Q angle was wider by about 2 degrees. Conclusion: It seems that the prevalence of ankle <b>sprain</b> directly correlates with high weight, BMI, and Q angle and is more prevalent in those with a history of <b>sprain.</b> Although the findings of the present study show a statistically significant correlation between these factors and ankle <b>sprain,</b> the correlation is not clinically significant. </p...|$|R
40|$|This study {{presents}} a free-fall mechanical supination <b>sprain</b> simulator {{for evaluating the}} ankle joint kinematics during a simulated ankle supination <b>sprain</b> injury. The device allows the foot {{to be in an}} anatomical position before the sudden motion, and also allows different degrees of supination, or a combination of inversion and plantarflexion. Five subjects performed simulated supination <b>sprain</b> trials in five different supination angles. Ankle motion was captured by a motion analysis system, and the ankle kinematics were reported in plantarflexion/dorsiflexion, inversion/eversion and internal/external rotation planes. Results showed that all <b>sprain</b> motions were not pure single-plane motions but were accompanied by motion in other two planes, therefore, different degrees of supination were achieved. The presented <b>sprain</b> simulator allows a more comprehensive study of the kinematics of ankle <b>sprain</b> when compared with some previous laboratory research designs...|$|R

5|$|At that time, Antoine had {{a student}} named Martin Jeanfils, an {{employee}} at the Corbeau coal. A few years ago, Jeanfils was certain to get a gift of healing by treating knee and foot <b>sprains</b> {{of his wife and}} himself, and was then consulted by patients in Jemeppe. Antoine and he were sued on 16 January 1907 on the grounds of illegal practice of the art of healing. Jeanfils explained to the court that he just wanted to do disappear the pain, and that he always sent his patients to doctors. For his part, Antoine told the judge that he simply {{put his hand on the}} forehead of patients and that he prescribed drugs; he denied the charge, and all the witnesses heard testified of the altruism of Antoine, who distributed money to the poor. Antoine and Jeanfils appeared before the Criminal Court on 15 June 1907, and the courtroom was entirely filled. Dr. Delville and the parents of a child cured by Antoine testified at the witness box, Mr. Dupret then pronounced the indictment. Adjourned, The judgment was adjourned and was finally, on 21 June 1907, President Hamoir acquitted the two men, who were absent in court then. Following an appeal by the prosecutor, Antoine and Jeanfils appeared before the Court again on 16 October 1907. The General Advocate Meyers made the indictment, analyzing the legislation of 1918 on the illegal art of healing, claiming that it was not what Antoine did. On 22 October of the same year, the acquittal was confirmed, and Meyers was deeply thanked by several faithful.|$|E
5|$|Having {{escaped the}} {{buildings}} {{in a variety}} of ways (including through doors and out of windows), some students found themselves impeded by a river that adjoined the school. However, some were able to use rowing boats as a means of escape. Saari started fires at several other locations within the school buildings, and the fire in the exam room damaged some of the bodies so badly that they had to be identified from DNA and dental records. Nine of the victims were found in the exam room, and one in a nearby corridor. It was later ascertained that this student had fled the burning classroom and then died in the corridor. Eight of the victims were female students, one a male student, and one a male member of staff. All of the students killed were in their 20s, and the teacher was in his 50s. A 21-year-old woman was shot in the head but had two operations in the days after sustaining her injury, and was reported as being in a satisfactory condition. A further ten students were treated for minor injuries including <b>sprains</b> and cuts from broken glass. All the victims were classmates of Saari's. Saari was originally from Pohjois-Pohjanmaa, but lived in Kauhajoki where he was enrolled on his catering course at the college. It was later revealed that the male student was probably a close friend of Saari's. The pair had spent an evening out together in February 2008 when they were threatened with a starter pistol. A photo of them together had been circulating on the Internet, in which Saari jokingly points at his friend's head with his forefinger. The names of the other victims were withheld by police.|$|E
40|$|Prevention of ankle <b>sprain,</b> {{the most}} common {{sporting}} injury, is only possible once risk factors have been identified. Voluntary strength, proprioception, postural sway, and range of motion are possible risk factors. A systematic review was carried out to investigate these possiblities. Eligible studies were those with longitudinal design investigating ankle <b>sprain</b> in subjects aged ⩾ 15 years. The studies had to have measured range of motion, voluntary strength, proprioception, or postural sway before monitoring incidence of lateral ankle <b>sprain.</b> Dorsiflexion range strongly predicted risk of ankle <b>sprain.</b> Postural sway and possibly proprioception were also predictors. Therefore the preliminary evidence suggests that people with reduced ankle dorsiflexion range may be at increased risk of ankle <b>sprain...</b>|$|R

40|$|Acute ankle {{injuries}} are common problems and {{often lead to}} persistent pain. To investigate the underlying mechanism of ankle <b>sprain</b> pain, the response properties of spinal dorsal horn neurons were examined after ankle <b>sprain.</b> Acute ankle <b>sprain</b> was induced manually by overextending the ankle of a rat hindlimb in a direction of plantarflexion and inversion. The weight-bearing ratio (WBR) of the affected foot {{was used as an}} indicator of pain. Single unit activities of dorsal horn neurons in response to plantarflexion and inversion of the foot or ankle compression were recorded from the medial part of the deep dorsal horn, laminae IV-VI, in normal and ankle-sprained rats. One day after ankle <b>sprain,</b> rats showed significantly reduced WBRs on the affected foot, and this reduction was partially restored by systemic morphine. The majority of deep dorsal horn neurons responded to a single ankle stimulus modality. After ankle <b>sprain,</b> the mean evoked response rates were significantly increased, and afterdischarges were developed in recorded dorsal horn neurons. The ankle sprain-induced enhanced evoked responses were significantly reduced by morphine, which was reversed by naltrexone. The data indicate that movement-specific dorsal horn neuron responses were enhanced after ankle <b>sprain</b> in a morphine-dependent manner, thus suggesting that hyperactivity of dorsal horn neurons is an underlying mechanism of pain after ankle <b>sprain...</b>|$|R

To examine the underlying mechanisms of the acupuncture-induced analgesia, the effects of electroacupuncture (EA) on weight-bearing forces (WBR) of the affected foot and dorsal horn neuron activities were examined in a rat model of ankle <b>sprain.</b> Ankle <b>sprain</b> was induced manually by overextending ligaments of the left ankle in the rat. Dorsal horn neuron responses to ankle movements or compression were recorded from the lumbar spinal cord using an in vivo extracellular single unit recording setup 1 day after ankle <b>sprain.</b> EA was applied to the SI- 6 acupoint on the right forelimb (contralateral to the <b>sprained</b> ankle) by trains of electrical pulses (10 Hz, 1 -ms pulse width, 2 -mA intensity) for 30 min. After EA, WBR of the <b>sprained</b> foot significantly recovered and dorsal horn neuron activities were significantly suppressed in ankle-sprained rats. However, EA produced no effect in normal rats. The inhibitory effect of EA on hyperactivities of dorsal horn neurons of ankle-sprained rats was blocked by the α-adrenoceptor antagonist phentolamine (5 mg/kg ip) but not by the opioid receptor antagonist naltrexone (10 mg/kg ip). These data suggest that EA-induced analgesia in ankle <b>sprain</b> pain is mediated mainly by suppressing dorsal horn neuron activities through α-adrenergic descending inhibitory systems at the spinal level...|$|R
