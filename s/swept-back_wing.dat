50|$|Charles Healy Day had {{designed}} the preceding Sloan H series of aircraft, and continued the line under the Standard Aero Corporation (later Standard Aircraft Corporation). Four companies, Standard, Dayton-Wright, Fisher Body, and Wright-Martin, delivered 1,601 J-1s between June 1917 and June 1918. The Standard J-1 can be differentiated from the Curtiss JN series by its slightly <b>swept-back</b> <b>wing</b> planform, triangular king posts above the upper wings, {{and the front}} legs of the landing gear which were mounted behind the lower wing's leading edge, just about where the forward wing spar of the lower wing panel attaches to the fuselage.|$|E
50|$|The Saab 29 Tunnan is a first-generation jet fighter, {{possessing}} {{the distinction of}} being the first Swedish aircraft to be specifically designed to use jet propulsion. Visually, it was a small, chubby aircraft featuring an integral single central air intake forming the aircraft's nose, the pilot being housed within a bubble canopy located directly above the air intake on the upper-forward section of the fuselage, and a very thin mid-mounted <b>swept-back</b> <b>wing.</b> The two-spar wing is a single piece structure attached to the fuselage by four bolts. The undercarriage was hydraulically retracted during flight and was designed to be suitable for landing upon rough grass airstrips.|$|E
40|$|The {{available}} {{foreign and}} American data relating to Reynolds number {{effects on the}} maximum lift coefficients of <b>swept-back</b> <b>wings</b> are summarized and discussed. The data show that at low Reynolds numbers (below about 2. 0 x 10 (exp 6)) higher maximum lift coefficients were measured in most cases for moderately <b>swept-back</b> <b>wings</b> than for unswept wings of similar plan form; at high Reynolds numbers, however, increasing sweepback resulted in decreasing maximum lift coefficients. A smaller rate of increase of the maximum lift coefficient with Reynolds number was measured for the <b>swept-back</b> <b>wings</b> than for similar unswept wings in the critical range of Reynolds number. Increasing the Reynolds number resulted in decreases in the maximum lift coefficients of the two wings of approximately triangular plan form that were investigated...|$|R

50|$|The J 29 {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{production}} fighters with a <b>swept-back</b> <b>wing,</b> being the first Western European fighter to be introduced with such a wing configuration. It was fast and agile, and set the world speed record on a 500 km closed circuit in 1954 at 977 km/h (607.05 mph). Two S 29C (reconnaissance variant) additionally set an international speed record of 900.6 km/h (559.4 mph) over a 1,000 km closed-circuit course in 1955. The crash record in early service was poor, mainly due to the inexperience with swept-winged aircraft and the lack of a two-seat, dual control Tunnan trainer variant: this meant that Swedish fighter pilots could only be trained using two seat variants of the de Havilland Vampire (a straight-winged jet), before going solo in a Tunnan. 99 pilots were killed during military practice flights in Sweden.|$|E
5000|$|Because {{development}} of the XP-86 had reached an advanced stage, the idea of changing the sweep of the wing was met with resistance from some senior North American staff. Despite stiff opposition, after good results were obtained in wind tunnel tests, the swept-wing concept was eventually adopted. Performance requirements were met by incorporating a 35° <b>swept-back</b> <b>wing,</b> using NACA 4-digit modified airfoils, using NACA 0009.5-64 at the root and NACA 0008.5-64 at the tip, with an automatic slat design based on that of the Messerschmitt Me 262 and an electrically adjustable stabilizer, another feature of the Me 262A. Many Sabres had the [...] "6-3 wing" [...] (a fixed leading edge with 6 inches extended chord at the root and 3 inches extended chord at the tip) retrofitted after combat experience was gained in Korea. This modification changed the wing airfoils to the NACA 0009-64 mod at the root and the NACA 0008.1-64 mod at the tip.|$|E

5000|$|A {{complementary}} approach uses differential twist or wash out, {{together with}} a <b>swept-back</b> <b>wing</b> planform and a suitable airfoil section. Prandtl, Pankonin and others discovered that washout was fundamental to the yaw stability in a turn of the Horten brothers flying wings of the 1930s and 1940s. Due to the necessity for elevons to be located near the wingtips, {{the one on the}} upward-moving wing causes drag that impedes turning as it deflects the high-pressure airflow under the wing. The Hortens described a [...] "bell shaped lift distribution" [...] across the span of the wing, with more lift in the center section and less at the tips due to their reduced angle of incidence, or washing out. The restoration of outer lift by the elevon creates a slight thrust for the rear (outer) section of the wing during the turn. When displaced, this vector essentially pulls the trailing wing forward to compensate for the [...] "adverse yaw" [...] caused by the elevon. It did not work well in practice.|$|E
50|$|The second {{lateral motion}} is an oscillatory {{combined}} roll and yaw motion called Dutch roll, {{perhaps because of}} its similarity to an ice-skating motion {{of the same name}} made by Dutch skaters; the origin of the name is unclear. The Dutch roll may be described as a yaw and roll to the right, followed by a recovery towards the equilibrium condition, then an overshooting of this condition and a yaw and roll to the left, then back past the equilibrium attitude, and so on. The period is usually on the order of 3-15 seconds, but it can vary from a few seconds for light aircraft to a minute or more for airliners. Damping is increased by large directional stability and small dihedral and decreased by small directional stability and large dihedral. Although usually stable in a normal aircraft, the motion may be so slightly damped that the effect is very unpleasant and undesirable. In <b>swept-back</b> <b>wing</b> aircraft, the Dutch roll is solved by installing a yaw damper, in effect a special-purpose automatic pilot that damps out any yawing oscillation by applying rudder corrections. Some swept-wing aircraft have an unstable Dutch roll. If the Dutch roll is very lightly damped or unstable, the yaw damper becomes a safety requirement, rather than a pilot and passenger convenience. Dual yaw dampers are required and a failed yaw damper is cause for limiting flight to low altitudes, and possibly lower Mach numbers, where the Dutch roll stability is improved.|$|E
5000|$|Ailerons are not fitted, with {{roll control}} being {{provided}} by wing-mounted spoilers {{at low speed}} (which are disabled if the sweep angle exceeds 57°), and by differential operation of the all-moving tailerons at high speed. Full-span slats and flaps are used to increase lift both for landing and combat, with slats being set at 17° for landing and 7° for combat, while flaps are set at 35° for landing and 10° for combat. An air bag filled up the space occupied by the <b>swept-back</b> <b>wing</b> when the wing was in the forward position and a flexible fairing {{on top of the}} wing smoothed out the shape transition between the fuselage and top wing area. The twin tail layout helps in maneuvers at high angle of attack (AoA) while reducing the height of the aircraft to fit within the limited roof clearance of hangars aboard aircraft carriers.Two triangular shaped retractable surfaces, called glove vanes, were originally mounted in the forward part of the wing glove, and could be automatically extended by the flight control system at high Mach numbers. They were used to generate additional lift (force) ahead of the aircraft's center of gravity, thus helping to compensate for the nose-down pitching tendencies at supersonic speeds. Automatically deployed at above Mach 1.4, they allowed the F-14 to pull 7.5 g at Mach 2 and could be manually extended with wings swept full aft. They were later disabled, however, owing to their additional weight and complexity. The air brakes consist of top-and-bottom extendable surfaces at the rearmost portion of the fuselage, between the engine nacelles. The bottom surface is split into left and right halves, the tailhook hangs between the two halves, an arrangement sometimes called the [...] "castor tail".|$|E

In the case of the <b>swept-back</b> <b>wing</b> the pressure distributions remain qualitatively similar at subsonic and supersonic speeds. Thus a distribution similar to the Ackeret type of distribution appears on the root sections of the <b>swept-back</b> <b>wing</b> at Mach= 0.

40|$|The {{positions}} of boundary-layer transition were ascertained experimentally for a <b>swept-back</b> <b>wing</b> and a wing without sweepback which were alike {{in all other}} respects and were compared for the same angle of attack (R(sub e) = 5. 6 x 10 (exp 5)). The <b>swept-back</b> <b>wing</b> in a definite range of angle of attack resulted in a backward shift of the transition point on the suction side of the wing. The favorable effect of sweepback on {{the position of the}} transition point is confirmed, consequently. In addition to decreasing the drag at high Mach numbers, the <b>swept-back</b> <b>wing</b> is acknowledged to have additional advantages. These are: (1) Decrease of the pressure drag.
