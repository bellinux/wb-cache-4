25|$|Furthermore, in 2013, a {{study was}} {{conducted}} in order to better understand the genetic variation in gorillas by using reduced representation sequencing. This <b>study</b> <b>consisted</b> <b>of</b> a sample of 12 western lowland gorillas and two eastern lowland gorillas all in captivity. The study found that western lowland gorillas {{are more likely to be}} heterozygous than homozygous. Most pure (meaning they are not inbred) western lowland gorillas have a hom/het ratio that ranges from 0.5 to 0.7. Therefore, because of variation in these gorillas, it has been concluded that they display a moderate substructure within the western lowland population in general.|$|E
25|$|Researchers Irving Kirsch and Thomas Moore have contested the {{pharmacological}} {{activity of}} antidepressants in {{the relief of}} depression, and state that the evidence is most consistent a role as active placebos. Their <b>study</b> <b>consisted</b> <b>of</b> a meta analysis incorporating data from both published studies and unpublished data obtained from the FDA via a Freedom of Information Act request. Overall, antidepressant pills worked 18% better than placebos, a statistically significant difference, but not one that is clinically significant. In a later publication, Kirsch concluded that the overall effect of new-generation antidepressant medication is below recommended criteria for clinical significance.|$|E

The cost of the triplication process was expected to be as high as A$1 billion, as project activities included the organization of corresponding bus services for the rail line, changes to stations and platforms along the line, and the improvement of the signalling system.|$|E
25|$|Music {{has proven}} {{useful in the}} {{recovery}} of motor skills. Rhythmical auditory stimulation in a musical context in combination with traditional gait therapy improved the ability of stroke patients to walk. The <b>study</b> <b>consisted</b> <b>of</b> two treatment conditions, one which received traditional gait therapy and another which received the gait therapy {{in combination with the}} rhythmical auditory stimulation. During the rhythmical auditory stimulation, stimulation was played back measure by measure, and was initiated by the patient's heel-strikes. Each condition received fifteen sessions of therapy. The results revealed that the rhythmical auditory stimulation group showed more improvement in stride length, symmetry deviation, walking speed and rollover path length (all indicators for improved walking gait) than the group that received traditional therapy alone.|$|E
25|$|A 2005 {{mortality}} {{study of}} creosote workers {{found no evidence}} supporting {{an increased risk of}} cancer death, as a result of exposure to creosote. Based on the findings of the largest mortality study to date of workers employed in creosote wood treating plants, {{there is no evidence that}} employment at creosote wood-treating plants or exposure to creosote-based preservatives was associated with any significant mortality increase from either site-specific cancers or non-malignant diseases. The <b>study</b> <b>consisted</b> <b>of</b> 2,179 employees at eleven plants in the United States where wood was treated with creosote preservatives. Some workers began work in the 1940s to 1950s. The observation period of the study covered 1979- 2001. The average length of employment was 12.5 years. One third of the study subjects were employed for over 15 years.|$|E

[...] The <b>study</b> <b>consisted</b> <b>of</b> telephone questionnaires of the caregivers of 32 cats, and analysis of blood samples from some of them.

[...] 97% of the caregivers perceived their cats to be healthy, including those with low taurine levels.|$|E
