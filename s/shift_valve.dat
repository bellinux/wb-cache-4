5000|$|The {{original}} Ultramatic did not switch automatically {{between high}} and low gearing ratios; the driver selected high or low ratio through the column shift lever. The intention was that in normal driving, the high (1:1) ratio would be selected at all times, and the two stage, dual turbine torque converter (actually a total of four turbines were employed) used to reduce gearing for starting off. At a speed of 15 - 56 mph (depending on rear axle ratio which affected the rate of governor pressure rise), governor pressure overcame the opposing throttle pressure, as determined by carburetor linkage position, causing the Direct <b>Shift</b> <b>Valve</b> to apply the direct drive clutch. This [...] "locked" [...] the torque converter, giving direct mechanical drive from the engine to the rear wheels, eliminating the power-robbing slippage of the torque converter at cruising speeds. On the highway, the Ultramatic delivered the same economy and power as a manual transmission. With the exception of Borg-Warner, major automotive manufacturers did not generally employ a locking torque converter until nearly thirty years later.|$|E

40|$|Presented at the Conference Active Flow and Combustion Control 2014, September 10 - 12 2014, Berlin, GermanyThe current {{investigation}} examines {{the impact of}} a new pulsed unsteady combustion to the turbine sealing cavity, which prevents hot gas ingestion into the inner machine. Sealing flow is ensured by relatively cold secondary air blowing radially through the rotor-stator-wheel space. The interaction between the sealing flow and the main gas flow however causes aerodynamic losses. These losses as well as the secondary compressor air should be kept at a minimum in order to increase the efficiency of the whole machine. The Hot-Acoustic-Testrig (HAT) allows an investigation of the subject under realistic flow conditions. Therefore a specific measurement section has been designed, which features a plenum to provide secondary air to the main flow. To simulate an pressure increasing combustion, a setup with 6 fast <b>shifting</b> <b>valves</b> was realized. The unsteady flow was measured by pressure tabs with a high time resolution. In the next step a characteristic linear cascade was designed to replace the turbine stator and generate a typical stator wake. Measurements of the total pressure loss over the cascade vanes have been conducted by means of a five-hole probe and by Particle Image Velocimetry. A considerable pressure loss inside the vane wake was observed at a Mach number Ma = 0. 35. The nvestigation is a subproject of the Collaborative Research Center 1029 Substantial efficiency increase in gas turbines through direct use of coupled unsteady combustion and flow dynamics and gives an outlook to further steps.

A simpler model with one degree of freedom for an elastic plate as transmission element proves to be too crude. But a more sophisticated model with axisymmetric finite elements for the plate shows good agreement. The simulations are compared to experiments performed with a scaled model for two different cases.

50|$|Rivet guns vary in {{size and}} shape and {{have a variety of}} handles and grips. Pneumatic rivet guns {{typically}} have a regulator which adjusts the amount of air entering the tool. Regulated air entering passes through the throttle valve which is typically controlled by a trigger in the hand grip. When the trigger is squeezed, the throttle valve opens, allowing the pressurized air to flow into the piston. As the piston moves, a port opens allowing the air pressure to escape. The piston strikes against the rivet set. The force on the rivet set pushes the rivet into the work and against the buck. The buck deforms the tail of the rivet. The piston is returned to the original position by a spring or the <b>shifting</b> of a <b>valve</b> allowing air to drive the piston back to the starting position.|$|R

40|$|A {{continuous}} step {{gradient elution}} process is suggested using several columns fixed in parallel to a multifunctional valve. The {{positions of the}} columns are changed in a periodic manner by <b>shifting</b> the <b>valve</b> at discrete times. Thus, the inlet streams into a certain column can be modulated in each time interval. Through one port, the feed is supplied whereas through the next port, eluent with increasing modifier concentration is dosed. In this work, the principle was studied for a normal-phase high-performance liquid chromatography system using the separation of a binary mixture of two cycloketones as an example. In these experiments, four columns were used. The feed stream was introduced in a relatively weak solvent and then three gradient steps using stronger solvents followed. In order to study the concept quantitatively, a mathematical model describing the column dynamics was developed. In preliminary experiments, the most relevant thermodynamic and kinetic parameters of the chromatographic system have been determined. In particular, the dependence of the adsorption isotherms on the mobile phase composition was analyzed. The influence of extra column volumes on the process performance was also considered. Four gradient elution experiments were carried out varying {{the shape of the}} step gradients. Besides a modulation of the eluent composition, flow rate gradients have also been considered. In the experiments performed, the separation process turned out to be stable and reproducible. The experimental results were compared with the model predictions. Due to the relatively good agreement found, the model can be applied to design the step gradient process and to evaluate its potential compared to conventional isocratic elution...|$|R
40|$|A {{product line}} of {{improved}} electrohydraulic linear actuators has been developed. These actuators are designed especially {{for use in}} actuating valves in rocket-engine test facilities. They are also adaptable to many industrial uses, such as steam turbines, process control valves, dampers, motion control, etc. The advantageous features of the improved electrohydraulic linear actuators are best described with respect to shortcomings of prior electrohydraulic linear actuators that the improved ones are intended to supplant. The flow of hydraulic fluid to the two ports of the actuator cylinder is controlled by a servo valve that is controlled by a signal from a servo amplifier that, in turn, receives an analog position-command signal (a current having a value between 4 and 20 mA) from a supervisory control system of the facility. As the position command changes, the servo <b>valve</b> <b>shifts,</b> causing a greater flow of hydraulic fluid {{to one side of}} the cylinder and thereby causing the actuator piston to move to extend or retract a piston rod from the actuator body. A linear variable differential transformer (LVDT) directly linked to the piston provides a position-feedback signal, which is compared with the position-command signal in the servo amplifier. When the position-feedback and position-command signals match, the servo valve moves to its null position, in which it holds the actuator piston at a steady position...|$|R
40|$|It is {{well known}} that in a {{hydraulic}} servomechanism the ram exhibits in the open-loop a linear motion in addition to its usual oscillatory motion for a sinusoidal input. This phenomenon, called drift, gives rise to an apparent instability of the system and the study of the dynamic behaviour becomes difficult. A theoretical investigation into the causes and remedy of this phenomenon is made on a loaded system with an asymmetric linear hydraulic motor controlled by an open-centre three-way spool valve. The original non-linear system equation in dimensionless form is derived taking into account the effects of leakage, compressibility (both fixed and varying) and area ratio, and solved numerically by the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method. It is shown that the determination of the reverse flow boundary is essential prior to the study of drijt, since the rate of drift will be maximum near the boundary frequency. I t is also shown that while the effect of compressibility due to the change in initial volume is mainly responsible for driji for an area ratio of I: 2, the effect of area ratio itself is predominant for an area ratio not equal to I: 2. I t is observed that in most of the cases the drift can be removed by giving a proper input <b>shift</b> to the <b>valve.</b> A method of calculating the input shift required is suggested and the effects of different system parameters on its magnitude are studied.

40|$|In {{this paper}} some results {{concerning}} {{the evolution of}} 3 D fluid flow pattern through all four strokes in combustion chambers with entirely different bowl-in-piston geometry layouts ranging from ”omega” to “simple cylinder” were presented. All combustion chambers i. e. those with „omega“ bowls, with different profiles, and those with „cylinder“ bowls, with different squish area ranging from 44 % to 62 %, were with flat head, vertical valves and identical elevation of intake and exhaust ports. A bunch of results emerged by dint of multidimensional modeling of nonreactive fluid flow in arbitrary geometry with moving objects and boundaries. The fluid flow pattern during induction and compression in all cases was extremely complicated and entirely three-dimensional. It {{should be noted that}} significant differences due to geometry of the bowl were encountered only in the vicinity of TDC. Namely, in the case of “omega” bowl all three types of organized macro flows were observed while in the case of “cylinder” bowl no circumferential velocity was registered at all. On the contrary, in the case of “cylinder” bowl some interesting results concerning reverse tumble and its center of rotation <b>shifting</b> from exhaust <b>valve</b> zone to intake valve zone during induction stroke and vice-verse from intake valve zone to exhaust valve zone during compression were observed while in the case of “omega” bowl no such a displacement was legible.

For that reason it is not affected by the geometry of the bowl...|$|R
40|$|Clonal {{cultures}} of Pseudo-nitzschia pungens were isolated {{at various times}} from seven sites in the North Sea. During the mitotic cell cycle, the two plate-shaped chloroplasts were girdle-appressed during interphase and mitosis. After cytokinesis, the chloroplasts moved onto the parental valve and remained there during {{the formation of the}} new hypovalve and until separation and re-arrangement of the sibling cells within the cell chain had been completed. Clones were almost always heterothallic and {{cultures of}} opposite mating type isolated from different localities were compatible. Meiosis I was cytokinetic and accompanied by chloroplast division. Meiosis II involved karyokinesis but not cytokinesis and preceded the rearrangement and contraction of the two gametes. Sexual reproduction involved physiological anisogamy. With one exception, gamete behaviour was clone-specific, gametes being active in clones of one mating type but passive in clones of the other mating type. Auxospore development was accompanied by deposition of a transverse and then a longitudinal perizonium. Infrequently, triploid auxospores and presumably haploid auxospores were produced. The four chloroplasts of diploid auxospores did not divide, and behaved synchronously during the two acytokinetic mitotic cycles accompanying the deposition of the initial thecae. Just before the first division of the initial cell, the chloroplasts <b>shifted</b> onto the <b>valves</b> (two per valve). The division of the initial cell was not accompanied by chloroplast division and so the two daughter cells received two chloroplasts each. Two modes of abrupt cell size reduction were detected. One occurred during initial cell formation when part of the expanded auxospore aborted. The other pattern was more gradual and was observed in growing cultures; during successive cell divisions a frustule constriction appeared and intensified, one chloroplast split into two, and part of the protoplast aborted.

We designed procedures to both repair and induce growth of hypoplastic atrioventricular valves and ventricles to achieve 2 -ventricle repairs. Midterm data were assessed for reliability of catch-up growth, resulting quality of atrioventricular valves, and adequacy of 2 -ventricle repairs. MethodsThe 24 consecutive infants (14 female and 10 male) with unbalanced atrioventricular canal defects had significant hypoplasia of 1 atrioventricular valve and/or ventricle (an echocardiography-derived z value of ≤− 3. 0 standard errors {{of the mean}} below expected). Operative approaches included the following: (1) Staged repair was performed, with complete valve repair, partial closure of the atrial septal, and ventricular septal defects, and (usually) pulmonary artery banding. After adequate growth, repair was completed. A vestigial mitral valve (4 – 7 mm) in 3 patients led to partitioning the large tricuspid valve, creating a second mitral valve. (2) Repair with a <b>shift</b> in atrioventricular <b>valve</b> partitioning was performed to increase hypoplastic atrioventricular valve size. (3) Repair with snared atrial septal defects and ventricular septal defect was performed to allow intracardiac shunting. The hypoplastic atrioventricular valves and hypoplastic ventricles were reassessed on local follow-up (5 – 15 years). ResultsThe initial z scores were − 2. 8 to − 7. 4 for hypoplastic atrioventricular valves and − 1. 0 to − 7. 5 for hypoplastic ventricles. Follow-up z scores were − 0. 6 to − 2. 7 for hypoplastic atrioventricular valves and − 2. 0 to + 1. 8 for hypoplastic ventricles. Another 11 patients were also judged to be within normal limits. Three reoperations were for mitral valve regurgitation, and 1 reoperation was for mitral valve replacement. One patient died of central nervous system bleed just before extracorporeal membrane oxygenation weaning, and 2 patients died of late potassium overdose, for an 88 % survival. Survivors are well with 2 -ventricle repairs, and 15 of 19 patients are not taking cardiac medications. ConclusionsIncreasing atrioventricular valve flow reliably induced growth.
