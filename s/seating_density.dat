Beranek, Music, Acoustics and Architecture (Wiley, New York, 1962), p. 543] that audience absorption {{is proportional to the}} area they occupy and not to their number is subjected to a statistical hypothesis test. A two variable linear regression model of the absorption with audience area and residual area as regressor variables is postulated for concert halls without added absorptive materials. Since Beranek's contention amounts to the statement that audience absorption is independent of the <b>seating</b> <b>density,</b> the test of the hypothesis lies in categorizing halls by <b>seating</b> <b>density</b> and examining for significant differences among slopes of regression planes of the different categories. Such a test shows that Beranek's hypothesis can be accepted. It is also shown that the audience area is a better predictor of the absorption than the audience number. The absorption coefficients and their 95 % confidence limits are given for the audience and residual areas. A critique of the regression model is presented...|$|E

40|$|Economic {{studies were}} {{conducted}} for three general fuel conserving options: (1) improving fuel consumption characteristics of existing aircraft via retrofit modifications; (2) introducing fuel efficient derivations of existing production aircraft and/or introducing fuel efficient, current state-of-the-art new aircraft; and (3) introducing an advanced state-of-the-art turboprop airplane. These studies {{were designed to}} produce an optimum airline fleet mix for the years 1980, 1985 and 1990. The fleet selected accommodated a normal growth market by introducing somewhat larger aircraft while solving for maximum departure frequencies and a minimum load factor corresponding to a 15 % investment hurdle rate.

40|$|This paper {{continues}} and expands several themes {{from previous}} studies of commercial airline cost functions. A well specified industrial cost function reveals characteristics about the market players, such as economies of scale and the cost elasticities with respect to operational styles. Using a translog specification, and its restricted first-order form, this paper updates previous parameter estimates, reworks the experimental design, and gives new analysis to describe the spectrum of choices facing airline firms in recent years. The translog model in this paper allows the energy cost share to interact with other variables and illuminate what factors may exacerbate cost sensitivity to energy prices, an advance in this specific area of interpretation. The result shows that fuel cost shares tend to be higher with older equipment, smaller fleet sizes, and to be increasing in aircraft size and <b>seating</b> <b>density.</b> The restricted first-order model indicates that older aircraft designs are more costly to operate, even accounting for operational style. This may imply that airlines with poorer access to capital suffer a cost disadvantage, particularly during a fuel spike - also a new contribution of the paper. Finally, the first-order model does not reject constant returns to scale (CRS) for fleet expansion, or increasing returns to scale (IRS) in aircraft size, which are the expected results...|$|E

It is important to understand the average aircraft size as it is an important determinant of employees needed to service the operation of a particular airline. Further, economies of scale generally mean that all other things being equal, an airline's CASM declines with increasing <b>seat</b> <b>density</b> (for instance, two small jet engines on a small commercial jet aircraft generally cost not much less to maintain than two large jet engines on a large commercial jet aircraft).|$|R

This thesis continues and expands several themes {{from previous studies}} of commercial airline cost functions. A well specified industrial cost function reveals characteristics about the market players, such as economies of scale and the cost elasticities with respect to operational styles. These parameters are updated, the experimental design reworked and new analysis is given to describe the spectrum of choices facing airline firms in recent times. I first construct a cost function for recent data using methods similar to Caves, Christensen and Tretheway (1984). As an energy intensive business, the US airline industry has seen its energy cost share rise and fall over time with potentially destabilizing effects. The model in this paper allows the energy cost share to interact with other variables and illuminate what factors may exacerbate cost sensitivity to energy prices. It was found that fuel cost shares tend to be higher with older equipment, smaller fleet sizes, and to be increasing in aircraft size and <b>seating</b> <b>density.</b> The translog results include a positive cost of older aircraft designs, suggesting that airlines with poorer access to capital may suffer a cost disadvantage, particularly during a fuel spike.

Their research accounts statistically for other possible stressors such as income and general life stress. “We find that a more proximal index of density is correlated with multiple indices of stress wherein a more distal index of density is not.” Concerns arising from {{the results of this study}} suggest that small deviations in increased <b>seat</b> <b>density,</b> controlled against income stress, would elevate the log of cortisol (i.e. stress levels) and diminish task performance and mood.|$|R

The study's main findings demonstrate how challenging the successful running of a European long-haul low-cost carrier can be. In particular, on-going operating profit appears to be very sensitive to variations in demand and fuel prices, despite the use of new, highly efficient B 787 s. The findings show any prospective long-haul low-cost carrier that pursuing a demand focussed network strategy can ensure financial viability.

50|$|Within {{two years}} of Pan Am's {{introduction}} of jet equipment on the bulk of its internal German services from/to West Berlin, its market share rose from 58% to 68%.

(Pan Am's second year of jet operations from Tempelhof saw load factors steadying while the third saw a slight increase.) The lower <b>seat</b> <b>density</b> in BEA's re-configured Viscounts combined with higher flight frequencies, superior catering and increased promotion proved insufficient to counter the appeal of Pan Am's new jets, which were laid out in a comparatively tight, 34 in pitch seating configuration. This resulted in BEA's market share declining from 38% at the beginning of this period to 27% at its end.

Although the DC-6B was a less advanced aircraft than either the Viscount or the Caravelle, it was more economical. By the early 1960s, Pan Am had a fleet of 15 DC-6Bs stationed at its Tempelhof base, which were configured in a higher-density seating arrangement than competing airlines' aircraft. (Pan Am's DC-6Bs were originally configured in a 76-seat, all-economy layout. The subsequent introduction of subsidies for all scheduled internal German services from/to West Berlin resulted in steady network growth as well as service frequency and passenger load increases. To cope with the sharply higher traffic volumes, aircraft <b>seat</b> <b>densities</b> were increased twice - initially to 84 and subsequently 87 seats.) This fleet eventually grew to 17 aircraft, which gave Pan Am the biggest aircraft fleet among the three main scheduled operators flying from West Berlin. It furthermore enabled it {{to compensate for the}} DC-6's lack of sophistication with higher frequencies than its competitors, thereby attaining a higher market share (60%) and capturing a greater share of the lucrative business travel market than its rivals. During that period, Pan Am moreover achieved an ultra short-haul load factor of 70% on its eight scheduled internal routes from Berlin, making the airline's Berlin routes the most profitable in its worldwide scheduled network.|$|R

5000|$|Within {{two years}} of Pan Am's {{introduction}} of jet equipment on the bulk of its internal German services from/to West Berlin, its market share rose from 58% to 68% while BEA's declined from 38% {{at the beginning of}} this period to 27% at its end. The lower <b>seat</b> <b>density</b> in BEA's re-configured Viscounts combined with higher flight frequencies, superior catering and increased promotion proved insufficient to counter the appeal of Pan Am's new jets, despite these being laid out in a comparatively tight, 34 in pitch seating configuration. On the other hand, BEA's reduced capacity in the domestic air travel market between West Berlin and West Germany enabled it to attain higher load factors than its competitors.From August 1968, BEA supplemented its Tempelhof-based Viscount fleet with de Havilland Comet 4B series jetliners. Although these aircraft could operate from Tempelhof's short runways without payload restrictions, they were not suited to the airline's ultra short-haul operation from Berlin (average stage length: 230 mi) given the high fuel consumption of the Comet, especially when operating at the mandatory 10,000 ft altitude inside the Allied air corridors. This measure was therefore only a stopgap until most of BEA's Berlin fleet was equipped with 97-seat, single-class BAC One-Eleven 500s. BEA's re-equipment of its Berlin fleet with brand-new One-Eleven 500 jets was central to the airline's competitive strategy to regain ground lost to Pan Am's 727s. The new One-Eleven 500, which BEA called the Super One-Eleven, operated its first scheduled service from Berlin on 1 September 1968. It began replacing the airline's Berlin-based Viscounts from 17 November 1968.Air France, West Berlin's third scheduled carrier, which had suffered a continuous traffic decline ever since the transfer of Berlin operations to more distant Tegel at the beginning of 1960 due to Tempelhof's operational limitations that made it unsuitable for its Caravelles, was worst affected by the equipment changes at the latter airport during the mid- to late-1960s. To reverse growing losses on its Berlin routes resulting from load factors as low as 30%, Air France decided to withdraw from the internal German market entirely and instead enter into a joint venture with BEA. This arrangement entailed the latter taking over the former's two remaining German domestic routes to Frankfurt and Munich and operating these with its own aircraft and flightdeck crews from Tempelhof. It also entailed repainting the fins of the BEA One-Eleven 500s in a neutral, dark-blue scheme featuring Super One-Eleven titles instead of BEA's [...] "Speedjack" [...] motif. The Air France-BEA joint venture became operational in spring 1969 and terminated in autumn 1972.|$|R

40|$|Soil {{and surface}} seat {{hydraulic}} properties were determined from simulated rainfall experiments by the inverse method {{applied to the}} Richards equation. Measurements used for the estimation include the soil water pressure head versus time at two distances from the soil surface, the transient infiltration rate at the soil surface and the drainage rates {{at the bottom of}} the soil profile. Seat properties were evaluated using a model that simulates changes in the <b>seat</b> bulk <b>density</b> with respect to time and space. Uncertainties, correlations and sensitivities of the soil and seat parameters were quantified to evaluate the accuracy of the model estimation and to compare the information content of each measurement type to parameter estimations. It appears that the uncertainties related to three seat parameter estimations, namely the parameter related to the dynamics of seat formation, the modelled seat thickness and the initial bulk density, were larger than 50 % of the parameter values, because of the tow sensitivity of the model to them and their multiple correlations. In addition to seat hydraulic parameter estimation, bulk density profiles of the soil surface were measured after the rainfall simulations using the X-ray method. The exponential-decay shape assumed in the soil surface seat model was found to correctly reproduce the measured distribution of bulk density with depth. However, the measurements showed a less developed seat than that suggested by the bulk density profile estimated from rainfall experiments. Finally, bulk density measurements were used as given input parameters of the model. Setting the initial bulk density and its maximal. change over time at the measured values greatly decreased the seat parameter uncertainties. The method proposed could be used to improve the experimental design used to quantify the seat's hydraulic properties using inverse techniques...|$|R
