5000|$|The {{reversed}} gambler's fallacy {{may appear}} to apply {{in the story of}} Joseph Jagger, who hired clerks to record the results of roulette wheels in Monte Carlo. He discovered that one wheel favored nine particular numbers, and was able to win large sums of money by betting on them until the casino started rebalancing the roulette wheels daily. In this situation, the observation of the wheel's behavior provided information about the physical properties of the wheel rather than its [...] "probability" [...] in some abstract sense, a concept which is the basis of both the gambler's fallacy and its reversal. Even a biased wheel's past results will not affect future results, but the results can provide information about what <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>results</b> the wheel tends to produce. However, if it is known for certain that the wheel is completely fair, then past results provide no information about future ones.|$|E
5000|$|Granqvist et al. {{claimed that}} Persinger's work was not [...] "double-blind." [...] Participants were often {{graduate}} students {{who knew what}} <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>results</b> to expect, {{and there was the}} risk that the experimenters' expectations would be transmitted to subjects by unconscious cues. The participants were frequently given an idea of {{the purpose of the study}} by being asked to fill in questionnaires designed to test their suggestibility to paranormal experiences before the trials were conducted. Granqvist et al. failed to replicate Persinger's experiments double-blinded, and concluded that the presence or absence of the magnetic field had no relationship with any religious or spiritual experience reported by the participants, but was predicted entirely by their suggestibility and personality traits. Following the publication of this study, Persinger et al. dispute this. One published attempt to create a [...] "haunted room" [...] using environmental [...] "complex" [...] electromagnetic fields based on Persinger's theoretical and experimental work did not produce the sensation of a [...] "sensed presence" [...] and found that reports of unusual experiences were uncorrelated with the presence or absence of these fields. As in the study by Granqvist et al., reports of unusual experiences were instead predicted by the personality characteristics and suggestibility of participants. One experiment with a commercial version of the God helmet found no difference in response to graphic images whether the device was on or off.|$|E

Data from HEOS 1 and OGO 5 are then analyzed, in which four observations of neutral sheet structures with large change of magnetic field direction were made.

The geometry of the magnetic field in the reconnection region appears to be similar to that described by Petschek. In one case the reconnection rate is in agreement with Petschek's prediction, but in the other three cases it is much larger than his limit. The reconnection rates observed do, however, agree with Sonnerup's (1972) limit...|$|E

People living nearby would be exposed to it con-tinuously for however many decades they lived there. If some cancers are caused by ambient levels of (say) 0. 01 ppm, I want to discuss the likely ef-fects on the numbers of cancers and the age dis-tribution of these cancers that would result from a different ambient concentration- 0. 00 I ppm, or 0. 1 ppm, for example. I believe that what should in general be expected in such circumstances is that the age distribution of the cancers that are caused will be the same whatever the dose rate may be; lower dose rates will simply cause fewer cancers than higher dose rates would do, but the age dis-tribution will be almost identical. Moreover, the actual number of extra cancers will, when the dose rate is sufficiently low, simply be proportional to the dose rate: if the dose rate is low, halving it will halve the numbers of cancers, quartering it will just quarter the number of cancers, and so on; no "threshold " should be anticipated.
