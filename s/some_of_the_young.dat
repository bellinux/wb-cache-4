After lead singer Prodigy left the group, Mindless Behavior did not release any material. As seen in many interviews, there had only been Princeton, Roc Royal, and Ray Ray, which meant that there hadn’t been a lead singer introduced. For almost two years, Mindless Behavior participated in interviews, and even held shows for their fans, without a lead singer. However, many of these shows included nothing but the band performing dance routines, while Prodigy’s voice played in the background. Elijah Johnson replaced him as the lead singer in April 2014.|$|E

500|$|In January 2011, it was {{announced}} that Whitney would be part of an upcoming storyline on sexual exploitation. Whitney is left alone and vulnerable, and falls for a man, Rob Grayson, played by Jody Latham, who exploits her for financial gain. EastEnders worked alongside charity Comic Relief on the storyline, which started planning in 2010. The storyline culminated during Red Nose Day 2011 on 19 March 2011, in a special ten-minute episode. Gilly Green, Head of UK Grants at Comic Relief, said: [...] "It is vital that we continue to alert young people to the dangers if we are to stop them being exploited and the opportunity to work with EastEnders will make a huge audience aware of this issue. We have been working with the EastEnders script writers and <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> women from projects we support to ensure the story reflects the reality of young people caught up in sexual exploitation." [...] Kevin Cahill, Chief Executive of Comic Relief, added [...] "We have worked over many years with EastEnders in all kinds of ways. It's been a real pleasure this year to work together on a piece of serious drama, in the best traditions of public service, which will highlight an important issue and also, because it occurs on the night of Comic Relief, actually help raise crucial funds to help young women caught up in it." [...] The storyline begins when Bianca is sent to prison and Whitney rejects her family, moving in with Janine and attempting to make money by stealing from The Queen Victoria, causing her to get sacked, working for Max, whom she tries to kiss as she has a crush on him, and pickpocketing. When she is caught, Rob rescues her from the situation and offers her what McGarty called a [...] "dream life", which Whitney thinks is her chance to move up in the world as she feels lonely and has no friends.|$|E

[...] Aristotle regarded the kind of laws adopted by Crete and Sparta as especially apt to produce virtuous and law-abiding citizens, although he also criticises the Cretans and Spartans themselves as incompetent and corrupt, and built on a culture of war.|$|E

The mambo faded away, and a new {{generation}} came into their own with the boogaloo, the jala-jala and the shing-a-ling. Some of the older, established band leaders took a stab at recording boogaloos—Tito Puente, Eddie Palmieri, and even Machito and Arsenio Rodríguez. But the establishment didn't have their hearts in it. As Puente later recounted: [...] "It stunk [...] [...] [...] I recorded it {{to keep up with the}} times. The young boogaloo upstarts were outselling their older counterparts. Johnny Colón claims that [...] "Boogaloo Blues" [...] sold over four million copies domestically. By the end of the 1960s though, the Latin music establishment shut down boogaloo airplay and the movement fizzled out. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> boogaloo artists, like Willie Colón, were able to transition into the next phase—salsa.|$|E

There, Goodman and his band, including Gene Krupa, Bunny Berigan, and the singer Helen Ward, found a large crowd of young dancers, raving and cheering the hot music they had heard on the Let's Dance radio show. Herb Caen wrote that [...] "from the first note, the place was in an uproar." [...] One night later, at Pismo Beach, the show was another flop, and the band thought the overwhelming reception in Oakland had been a fluke.|$|E

2500|$|In the 1960s, Sir Anthony Caro {{became a}} leading figure of British {{sculpture}} [...] {{along with a}} younger generation of abstract artists including Isaac Witkin, Phillip King and William G.

2500|$|Polygynous {{marriage}} was preferred among the Logoli and other Abalulya sub ethnic groups. Taking additional wives {{was regarded as}} one of the fundamental indicators of a successfully established man. Large families enhanced the prestige of Logoli men. Logoli men with large families were also capable of obtaining justice, as they would be feared by people, who would not dare to use force to take their livestock or other goods from them. [...] Interviews with some of the contemporary Logoli men and women who recently made polygynous marriages yielded data which suggest that marrying another wife is usually approached with considerable thought and deliberation by the man. It may or may not involve or require the consent of the other wives and prospective wife's parents. A type of [...] "surrogate pregnancy" [...] arrangement was reported to have been observed, in which some wives who are unable to bear children, find fulfillment in the children and family provided by a husband taking additional wives. [...] Some of the men indicated that they were pressured by their parents to marry another wife, who could contribute additional income to the family. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> polygynous men indicated that they were trapped in polygyny because of the large number of single women who needed and were willing to take them as husbands although they were already married. Most of those second and third wives were older women who had not yet married.|$|E
2500|$|During the {{breeding}} season, the female boa emits a scent from her cloaca to attract males, which may then wrestle {{for the right}} to breed with her. During breeding, the male curls his tail around the female's and the hemipenes (or, male reproductive organs) are inserted. Copulation can last from a few minutes to several hours, and may occur several times over a few-week period. After this period, ovulation may not occur immediately, but the female can hold the sperm inside her for up to one year. When the female ovulates, a midbody swell can be noticed that appears similar to the snake having eaten a large meal. The female then sheds two to three weeks after ovulation, in what is known as a postovulation shed which lasts another 2–3 weeks, which is longer than a normal shed. The gestation period, which is counted from the postovulation shed, is around 100–120 days. The female then gives birth to young that average [...] in length. The litter size varies between females, but can be between 10 and 65 young, with an average of 25, although <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> may be stillborn or unfertilized eggs known as [...] "slugs". The young are independent at birth and grow rapidly for the first few years, shedding regularly (once every one to two months).

2500|$|The vast {{majority}} of books (including both of Guralnick's books) on Presley contain details of his many romances and alleged affairs including many while {{he was married to}} Priscilla. It has also been reported that Presley [...] "adored to fondle and suck women's toes, and those in his entourage who were given the job of choosing companions for him would often be asked to check the girls' feet." [...] However, according to Alan Fortas, an all-Memphis football halfback who became a bodyguard and part of the Presley entourage, [...] "Elvis needed someone to baby more than he needed a sex partner. He craved the attention of someone who adored him without the threat of sexual pressure, much as a mother would." [...] Furthermore, [...] "Elvis befriended <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> girls who used to cluster adoringly in his driveway, or outside the fence ... Some of the girls were as young as fourteen. Fortas said they were frequent houseguests who attended his concerts as part of 'Elvis's personal traveling show.' Out in the backyard, they romped with Elvis in the Doughboy pool and challenged him to watermelon-seed spitting contests. They also slipped into his bedroom ... for rambunctious pillow fights. Sometimes they would all sit cross-legged with him on the bed, flipping through his fan magazines or admiring his stuffed-animal collection. Often they would all lie down together and cuddle. But what went on was horseplay, not foreplay." [...] Therefore, Guralnick writes that for [...] "the more experienced girls it wasn't like with other Hollywood stars or even with other more sophisticated boys they knew." [...] Although they offered to do things for Presley, [...] "he wasn't really interested. What he liked to do was to lie in bed and watch television and eat and talk all night..." ...|$|E
