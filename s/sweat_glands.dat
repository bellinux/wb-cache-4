5|$|Living mammal {{species can}} be {{identified}} {{by the presence of}} <b>sweat</b> <b>glands,</b> including those that are specialized to produce milk to nourish their young. In classifying fossils, however, other features must be used, since soft tissue glands and many other features are not visible in fossils.|$|E
5|$|The {{capybara}} has a heavy, barrel-shaped {{body and}} short head, with reddish-brown fur {{on the upper}} part of its body that turns yellowish-brown underneath. Its <b>sweat</b> <b>glands</b> {{can be found in the}} surface of the hairy portions of its skin, an unusual trait among rodents. The animal lacks down hair, and its guard hair differs little from over hair.|$|E
5|$|Bats may avoid flying {{during the}} day to prevent {{overheating}} in the sun, since their dark wing-membranes absorb solar radiation. Bats {{may not be able}} to dissipate heat if the ambient temperature is too high. Unlike birds which have air sacs or other mammals which have <b>sweat</b> <b>glands,</b> bats have no means to cool themselves by evaporation, though they may use saliva to cool themselves in an emergency.|$|E
50|$|<b>Sweat</b> <b>gland</b> removal or {{destruction}} is one surgical option available for axillary hyperhidrosis (excessive underarm perspiration). There are multiple methods for <b>sweat</b> <b>gland</b> removal or destruction, such as <b>sweat</b> <b>gland</b> suction, retrodermal currettage, and axillary liposuction, Vaser, or Laser <b>Sweat</b> Ablation. <b>Sweat</b> <b>gland</b> suction {{is a technique}} adapted for liposuction.|$|R
40|$|The <b>sweat</b> <b>gland</b> {{structure}} and function cannot be regenerated by itself during the treat and cure of severe full-thickness burn injury patients. To identify the biological characteristics and function of stem cell populations in human <b>sweat</b> <b>gland,</b> it will provide novel knowledge for human <b>sweat</b> <b>gland</b> regeneration in dermis. We developed a highly efficient and stable method to isolate and culture human <b>sweat</b> <b>gland</b> cells derived from infant polydactylism sample. Much more <b>sweat</b> <b>gland</b> tissue {{can be obtained from}} infant polydactylism sample compared to the samples from adult chest, neck and palm. In our study four types of cells had been distinguished in <b>sweat</b> <b>gland</b> tissue by relative specific markers in <b>sweat</b> <b>gland</b> tissue, including luminal cells in duct (K 1 b), peripheral cells in duct (K 1), secretory gland cells (K 8) and myoepithelial gland cells (SMA). Based on comparison of in vitro differentiation potential into keratinocytes in four types of <b>sweat</b> <b>gland</b> cells, K 1 b+ luminal cells in duct only take three days to differentiate into K 14 +K 5 + keratinocytes and may responsible for restoring epidermal injure. Our data suggested that stem cells exist in duct part of <b>sweat</b> <b>gland.</b> We also designed a novel in vitro 3 D culture system for regeneration of secretory gland tissue. K 8 + secretory gland cells exhibited an excellent ability for building gland structure. Whether stem cells in duct is also contributed to reinforce secretory gland cell when dermal <b>sweat</b> <b>gland</b> injure occurs, it is still unclear. The next study will focus on high throughput analysis using gene microarray on four types of <b>sweat</b> <b>gland</b> cells and several doubts for human <b>sweat</b> <b>gland</b> stem cells may be answered...|$|R

5|$|The patagium is {{the wing}} membrane. The patagium is {{stretched}} between {{the arm and}} hand bones, down the lateral {{side of the body}} and down to the hind limbs. This skin membrane consists of connective tissue, elastic fibers, nerves, muscles, and blood vessels. The muscles keep the membrane taut during flight. The skin on the body of the bat, which has one layer of epidermis and dermis, as well as the presence of hair follicles, <b>sweat</b> <b>glands</b> and a fatty subcutaneous layer, {{is very different from the}} skin of the wing membrane. The patagium is an extremely thin double layer of epidermis; these layers are separated by a connective tissue center, rich with collagen and elastic fibers. The membrane has no hair follicles or <b>sweat</b> <b>glands,</b> except between the fingers. Unlike birds whose stiff wings deliver bending and torsional stress to the shoulders, bats have a flexible wing membrane which can only resist tension. To achieve flight, a bat exerts force inwards at the points where the membrane meets the skeleton, so that an opposing force balances it on the wing edges perpendicular to the wing surface. However, this adaptation does not permit bats to reduce their wingspan as birds do, which means they cannot travel over long distances like birds can.|$|E
5|$|Water {{is needed}} by many birds {{although}} their mode of excretion {{and lack of}} <b>sweat</b> <b>glands</b> reduces the physiological demands. Some desert birds can obtain their water needs entirely from moisture in their food. They may also have other adaptations such as allowing their body temperature to rise, saving on moisture loss from evaporative cooling or panting. Seabirds can drink seawater and have salt glands inside the head that eliminate excess salt out of the nostrils.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{publication}} of the experiment in American Medicine, physician Augustus P. Clarke criticized the experiment's validity. Clarke noted {{that at the time of}} death there is a sudden rise in body temperature as the lungs are no longer cooling blood, causing a subsequent rise in sweating which could easily account for MacDougall’s missing 21 grams. Clarke also pointed out that, as dogs do not have <b>sweat</b> <b>glands,</b> they would not lose weight in this manner after death. Clarke's criticism was published in the May issue of American Medicine. Arguments between MacDougall and Clarke debating the validity of the experiment continued to be published in the journal until at least December that year.|$|E
40|$|Background. <b>Sweat</b> <b>gland</b> {{carcinoma}} {{is a rare}} malignancy with a high metastatic potential {{seen more}} commonly in elderly patients. The scalp {{is the most common}} site of occurrence and it usually spreads to regional lymph nodes. Liver, lungs, and bones are the most common sites of distant metastasis. Late lung metastasis of <b>sweat</b> <b>gland</b> adenocarcinoma after a time span of 5 years is extremely rare. Aim. We report a patient with late lung metastasis of a primary <b>sweat</b> <b>gland</b> carcinoma 10 years after initial surgical resection. Conclusion. <b>Sweat</b> <b>gland</b> carcinomas are rare cancers with a poor prognosis. Surgery in the form of wide local excision and lymph node dissection is the mainstay of treatment. Late pulmonary metastases with a latency of 10 years have never been reported in the literature. This is the first clinical documentation of late lung metastasis from <b>sweat</b> <b>gland</b> carcinoma with a latency period of 10 years...|$|R
40|$|AbstractExtramammary Paget’s {{disease of}} the scrotum with <b>sweat</b> <b>gland</b> {{adenocarcinoma}} is a rare malignant tumor. This study aims to summarize the clinicopathologic characteristics related to the prognosis of scrotal Paget’s disease with underlying <b>sweat</b> <b>gland</b> adenocarcinoma. Clinical datum of four patients with scrotal Paget’s disease with <b>sweat</b> <b>gland</b> carcinoma, treated in Beijing Chao-Yang Hospital from 2002 to 2009 was analyzed, and a literature review was conducted. The typical manifestation of scrotal Paget’s disease with <b>sweat</b> <b>gland</b> carcinoma was eczematoid-like skin lesions. All patients underwent primary lesion resection plus inguinal lymphadenectomy. Three patients had inguinal lymph metastasis. One of them developed distant metastases in bone and bone marrow and died of metastatic carcinoma. The dead patient had higher serum carcinoma embryonic antigen (CEA) level, Her- 2 overexpression and shorter disease course than the other patients. The other patients were observed for at least 3 years, and lived without tumor. Scrotal Paget’s disease with <b>sweat</b> <b>gland</b> adenocarcinoma may be prone to inguinal lymph node and bone metastasis. Serum CEA level, Her- 2 overexpression, dermis and lymphovascular invasion {{may be associated with}} the prognosis of scrotal Paget’s disease with <b>sweat</b> <b>gland</b> adenocarcinoma. The primary lesion resection plus inguinal lymphadenectomy is the major treatment for scrotal Paget’s disease with <b>sweat</b> <b>gland</b> adenocarcinoma. The effect of combination chemotherapy in the treatment of metastatic extramammary Paget’s disease remains to be proven by prolonged follow-up and wide experience...|$|R
40|$|Introductions: <b>Sweat</b> <b>gland</b> {{carcinoma}} is {{very rare}} with a reported incidence of less than 0. 005 % of all tumour specimens resected surgically (Tulenko and Conway, 1965) [1]. Case report: A sixty year old male patient presented to us with a solitary swelling over the left chest wall since two months. Discussion: Cutaneous apocrine gland carcinoma, a subtype of <b>sweat</b> <b>gland</b> carcinoma, is a very rare malignant neoplasm arising in areas of high apocrine <b>sweat</b> <b>gland</b> density. The variability of the histological features even in the same tumour, and its rarity, have contributed to some confusion regarding the classification of <b>sweat</b> <b>gland</b> carcinoma. Conclusions: <b>Sweat</b> <b>gland</b> carcinomas are a rare group of tumours with potential for local destruction as well as distant metastasis. Wide surgical excision along with regional lymph node dissection {{in the presence of}} clinically positive nodes is the recommended treatment. However, a frequent follow up is essential to detect early recurrence as well as distant metastasis...|$|R
5|$|Many {{sleeping}} birds bend {{their heads}} over {{their backs and}} tuck their bills in their back feathers, although others place their beaks among their breast feathers. Many birds rest on one leg, while some may pull up their legs into their feathers, especially in cold weather. Perching birds have a tendon locking mechanism that helps them {{hold on to the}} perch when they are asleep. Many ground birds, such as quails and pheasants, roost in trees. A few parrots of the genus Loriculus roost hanging upside down. Some hummingbirds go into a nightly state of torpor accompanied with a reduction of their metabolic rates. This physiological adaptation shows in nearly a hundred other species, including owlet-nightjars, nightjars, and woodswallows. One species, the common poorwill, even enters a state of hibernation. Birds do not have <b>sweat</b> <b>glands,</b> but they may cool themselves by moving to shade, standing in water, panting, increasing their surface area, fluttering their throat or by using special behaviours like urohidrosis to cool themselves.|$|E
5|$|The {{adrenal gland}} {{produces}} aldosterone, a mineralocorticoid, {{which is important}} in the regulation of salt ("mineral") balance and blood volume. In the kidneys, aldosterone acts on the distal convoluted tubules and the collecting ducts by increasing the reabsorption of sodium and the excretion of both potassium and hydrogen ions. Aldosterone is responsible for the reabsorption of about 2% of filtered sodium in the kidneys, which is nearly equal to the entire sodium content in human blood under normal glomerular filtration rates. Sodium retention is also a response of the distal colon and <b>sweat</b> <b>glands</b> to aldosterone receptor stimulation. Angiotensin II and extracellular potassium are the two main regulators of aldosterone production. The amount of sodium present in the body affects the extracellular volume, which in turn influences blood pressure. Therefore, the effects of aldosterone in sodium retention are important for the regulation of blood pressure.|$|E
5|$|The coat has dark blotches or patches (which can be orange, chestnut, brown, {{or nearly}} black in colour) {{separated}} by light hair (usually white or cream in colour). Male giraffes become darker as they age. The coat pattern has been claimed {{to serve as}} camouflage in the light and shade patterns of savannah woodlands. While adult giraffes standing among trees and bushes are hard to see at even a few metres' distance, they actively move into the open to gain the best view of an approaching predator, obviating any benefit that camouflage might bring. Instead, the adults rely on their size and ability to defend themselves. However, camouflage appears to be important for calves, which spend {{a large part of}} the day in hiding, away from their mothers; further, over half of all calves die within a year, so predation is certainly important. It appears, therefore, that the spotted coat of the giraffe functions as camouflage for the young, while adults simply inherit this coloration as a by-product. The skin underneath the dark areas may serve as windows for thermoregulation, being sites for complex blood vessel systems and large <b>sweat</b> <b>glands.</b> Each individual giraffe has a unique coat pattern.|$|E

5000|$|Discussion of <b>sweat</b> <b>gland</b> tumors can be {{difficult}} and confusing due to the complex classification and redundant terminology {{used to describe the}} same tumors.

In addition, a single lesion may contain a mixture of cell-types. [...] There has also been a change in understanding about how tumors that were previously believed to strictly derive from specific <b>sweat</b> <b>gland</b> types may, in fact, derive from both eccrine or apocrine glands.|$|R
25|$|Sweating {{dissipated}} heat through evaporation. Early humans, like chimpanzees now, had few <b>sweat</b> <b>glands,</b> {{and most of}} them were located in the palms of the hand and the soles of feet. At times, individuals with more <b>sweat</b> <b>glands</b> were born. These humans could search for food and hunt for longer periods before being forced back to the shades. The more they could forage, more and healthier offspring they could produce, and higher the chance they had to pass on their genes for abundant <b>sweat</b> <b>glands.</b> With less hair, sweat could evaporate more easily and cool the body of humans faster. A few million years of evolution later, early humans had sparse body hair and more than 2 million <b>sweat</b> <b>glands</b> in their body.|$|E

The differentiation between apocrine and eccrine metastatic <b>sweat</b> <b>gland</b> carcinoma is often difficult. The criteria's are inadequate to be of any practical utility. Case Report Two cases of metastatic <b>sweat</b> <b>gland</b> adenocarcinoma (one of eccrine and the other one of apocrine origin) are being reported on account of the rarity and different outcome. Conclusion <b>Sweat</b> <b>gland</b> carcinomas are rare cancers with a poor prognosis often presenting as histological surprises.

40|$|Recently, Biedermann et al. (2010) have {{demonstrated}} that human eccrine <b>sweat</b> <b>gland</b> cells can develop a multilayered epidermis. The question still remains whether these cells can fulfill exclusive and very specific functional properties of epidermal keratinocytes, such as the incorporation of melanin, a feature absent in <b>sweat</b> <b>gland</b> cells. We added human melanocytes to eccrine <b>sweat</b> <b>gland</b> cells to let them develop into an epidermal analog in vivo. The interaction between melanocytes and sweat gland-derived keratinocytes was investigated. The following results were gained: (1) macroscopically, a pigmentation of the substitutes was seen 2 - 3 weeks after transplantation; (2) we confirmed {{the development of a}} multilayered, stratified epidermis with melanocytes distributed evenly throughout the basal layer; (3) melanocytic dendrites projected to suprabasal layers; and (4) melanin was observed to be integrated into former eccrine <b>sweat</b> <b>gland</b> cells. These skin substitutes were similar or equal to skin substitutes cultured from human epidermal keratinocytes. The only differences observed were a delay in pigmentation and less melanin uptake. These data suggest that eccrine <b>sweat</b> <b>gland</b> cells can form a functional epidermal melanin unit, thereby providing striking evidence that they can assume one of the most characteristic keratinocyte properties...|$|R

40|$|Bullae and <b>sweat</b> <b>gland</b> {{necrosis}} remain rare cutaneous manifestation, {{and these}} conditions can be misdiagnosed as Vibrio vulnificus infections or other soft tissue infections {{because of their}} low index of suspicion.

The patient reported that after the ingestion of clams, he slept for 12 hr in a heavily intoxicated state. Then the skin lesions started as a reddish patch that subsequently became hemorrhagic bullae. V. vulnificus infection, cellulitis, and necrotizing fasciitis were considered in initial differential diagnosis. However, on the basis of <b>sweat</b> <b>gland</b> necrosis on histopathologic examinations and negative results on bacterial cultures, we made the diagnosis of bullae and <b>sweat</b> <b>gland</b> necrosis. Therefore, bullae and <b>sweat</b> <b>gland</b> necrosis should also be considered in chronic alcoholic patients who present with bullae and a previous history of unconsciousness...|$|R
