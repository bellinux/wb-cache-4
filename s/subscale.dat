40|$|Abstract Background The mini-Mental Adjustment to Cancer Scale (mini-MAC) is a well-recognised, popular {{measure of}} coping in {{psycho-oncology}} and assesses five cancer-specific coping strategies. It {{has been suggested}} that these five <b>subscales</b> could be grouped to form the over-arching adaptive and maladptive coping <b>subscales</b> to facilitate the interpretation and clinical application of the scale. Despite the popularity of the mini-MAC, few studies have examined its psychometric properties among long-term cancer survivors, and further validation of the mini-MAC is needed to substantiate its use with the growing population of survivors. Therefore, this study examined the psychometric properties and dimensionality of the mini-MAC in a sample of long-term cancer survivors using Rasch analysis. Methods RUMM 2030 was used to analyse the mini-MAC data (n= 851). Separate Rasch analyses were conducted for each of the original mini-MAC <b>subscales</b> as well as the over-arching adaptive and maladaptive coping <b>subscales</b> to examine summary and individual model fit statistics, person separation index (PSI), response format, local dependency, targeting, item bias (or differential item functioning -DIF), and dimensionality. Results For the fighting spirit, fatalism, and helplessness-hopelessness <b>subscales,</b> a revised three-point response format seemed more optimal than the original four-point response. To achieve model fit, items were deleted from four of the five <b>subscales</b> – Anxious Preoccupation items 7, 25, and 29; Cognitive Avoidance items 11 and 17; Fighting Spirit item 18; and Helplessness-Hopelessness items 16 and 20. For those <b>subscales</b> with sufficient items, analyses supported unidimensionality. Combining items to form the adaptive and maladaptive <b>subscales</b> was partially supported. Conclusions The original five <b>subscales</b> required item deletion and/or rescaling to improve goodness of fit to the Rasch model. While evidence was found for overarching <b>subscales</b> of adaptive and maladaptive coping, extensive modifications were necessary to achieve this result. Further exploration and validation of over-arching <b>subscales</b> assessing adaptive and maladaptive coping is necessary with cancer survivors. </p...|$|R

The specifications were concluded in February 1979, and the main differences from the EMB-311 were the more powerful PT6A-25C engine, raised rear cockpit, {{and the addition of}} ejection seats. Eventually, the original specifications underwent a major modification, including a smaller fuselage with an upright cruciform tail instead of a swept-back tail; a more domed canopy; extended elevators; greater distance between the nosewheel and back wheel; reduction of the wing root; and an increased wingspan, tailplane, and landing gear. By late 1979, a full-scale mock-up was built with a cockpit for the evaluation of flight instruments, and a <b>subscale,</b> radio-controlled research model was designed to evaluate the free-flight characteristics before building a full-scale prototype.|$|E
25|$|Within the Big Five {{model of}} personality, need for {{cognition}} {{has been found}} to relate positively to openness to experience most strongly and to a more moderate extent to conscientiousness, particularly the competence and achievement striving facets, and to relate inversely to an extent to neuroticism. Regarding Cloninger's temperament traits, need for cognition has been related negatively to harm avoidance and positively to persistence and was unrelated to reward dependence or novelty seeking. Need for cognition has only a weak positive relationship with sensation seeking, specifically a weak correlation with the boredom susceptibility <b>subscale</b> but no relationship to the other subscales. Need for cognition has a modest inverse correlation with negative affect. NFC had no significant correlation with a broad measure of overall positive affect, although it was positively correlated with feelings of activity, interest, and alertness. Need for cognition has been positively related to other, theoretically unrelated, personality characteristics such as self-esteem, masculine sex-role attitudes, and absorption. It is also negatively related to social anxiety (more strongly in females than males). It has been speculated that people who more carefully analyse their world feel a greater sense of mastery, and hence greater self-esteem, although {{it is also possible that}} higher self-esteem may lead to greater motivation to engage in thinking. Need for cognition may be related to masculine sex-role due to the stereotype associating masculinity with rationality. Regarding absorption, people high in need for cognition may find it easier to devote their attentional processes exclusively to intellectual tasks. Regarding social anxiety, it is possible that greater attention to cognitive activity may be associated with reduced attention to social cues associated with negative evaluation.|$|E

The {{purpose of this study was}} to validate the factor structure of multiple-item <b>subscales</b> of the EORTC QLQ-C 30 and to improve their reliability by means of an item response analysis by using the multidimensional partial credit model. MethodsA total of 2295 patients with complete data were used for the analysis. One- and nine-dimensional partial credit models were used to fit the data to validate the construct validity of the multiple-item <b>subscales</b> of the QLQ-C 30. ResultsThe model comparison showed that the nine-dimensional factor structure of multiple-item <b>subscales</b> was satisfactory. The multidimensional partial credit model fit data of the multiple-item <b>subscales</b> of the QLQ-C 30 reasonably well. The estimated test reliabilities of each domain obtained from the multidimensional approach were higher than those obtained from the unidimensional approach. ConclusionsThe constructs represented by the multiple-item <b>subscales</b> of the QLQ-C 30 were validated.

2500|$|At a broad level, the {{construct}} of trait nature connectedness is associated with well-being. [...] This means that individuals who are highly connected to nature also report higher psychological well-being (i.e. greater acceptance of self), and social well-being (i.e. socially integrated). Emotional well-being (i.e. positive emotions and life satisfaction), is related to nature connectedness but less consistently However, psychological and social well-being are consistently related to nature connectedness suggesting that feeling connected to nature is related to participant's well-being in their personal and social lives. Trait nature relatedness is significantly correlated with psychological well-being and its 6 dimensions (autonomy, environmental mastery, positive relations with others, self-acceptance, purpose in life, and personal growth). More specifically, nature relatedness relates to all six dimensions (in a sample with undergraduate students), and relates with autonomy, purpose in life, and personal growth (in a sample with business people). It also significantly relates to positive affect in both populations. Finally, nature connectedness is associated with mindfulness. In recent years, {{a great deal of}} research has examined the benefits of mindfulness such as increased self-awareness, self-esteem, resilience and reduced maladaptive rumination. The awareness <b>subscale</b> (of mindfulness) correlates with nature connectedness but the other <b>subscale</b> of mindfulness (the acceptance <b>subscale)</b> does not consistently correlate. As the authors state, this suggests that mindfulness is related to a person's awareness in nature and their experiences in nature but not with whether they accept these experiences or not.|$|E
