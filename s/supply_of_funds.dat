Felipe Ángeles {{and the rest}} of Villa's staff officers argued for Villa to withdraw his resignation, defy Carranza's orders, and proceed to attack Zacatecas, a strategic railroad station heavily defended by Federal troops and considered nearly impregnable. Since the colonial era, Zacatecas was the source of much of Mexico's silver, and thus a <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> <b>funds</b> for whoever held it. Villa accepted his staff's advice and cancelled his resignation, and the División del Norte defied Carranza and attacked Zacatecas. Attacking up steep slopes, the División del Norte defeated the Federals in the Toma de Zacatecas (Taking of Zacatecas), the single bloodiest battle of the Revolution, with Federal casualties numbering approximately 7,000 dead and 5,000 wounded, and unknown numbers of civilian casualties. (A memorial to and museum of the Toma de Zacatecas is on the Cerro de la Bufa, a key defense point where the Federal Army was entrenched.) ...|$|E

6000|$|The {{next step}} was to call a general council of all the chieftains and nobles of the land, and also the notables, as they were called, or {{principal}} officers and municipal authorities of the towns. The main point of interest for the consideration of this assembly was, whether the country would submit to the necessary taxation for raising the necessary funds. William had ample power, as duke, to decide upon the invasion and to undertake it. He could also, without much difficulty, raise the necessary number of men; for every baron in his realm was bound, by the feudal conditions on which he held his land, to furnish his quota of men for any military enterprise in which his sovereign might see fit to engage. But for so distant and vast an undertaking as this, William needed a much larger <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> <b>funds</b> than were usually required in the wars of those days. For raising such large supplies, the political institutions of the Middle Ages had not made any adequate provision. Governments then had no power of taxation, like that so freely exercised in modern times; and even now, taxes in France and England take the form of grants from the people to the kings. And as to the contrivance, so exceedingly ingenious, by which inexhaustible resources are opened to governments at the present day--that is, the plan of borrowing the money, and leaving posterity to pay or repudiate the debt, as they please, no minister of finance had, in William's day, been brilliant enough to discover it. Thus each ruler had to rely, then, mainly on the rents and income from his own lands, and other private resources, for the comparatively small amount of money that he needed in his brief campaigns. But now William perceived that ships must be built and equipped, and great stores of provisions accumulated, and arms and munitions of war provided, all which would require a considerable outlay; and how was this money to be obtained? ...|$|E

Governments may chose to stimulate the VC industry either by directly investing in the industry, or by indirect measures. Panel data analyses suggest that national governments react on macro-economic impulses: the <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> government <b>funds</b> to the VC industry increases (resp. decreases) when the overall economic situation is negative (resp. positive), and when the <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> private VC in previous years is smaller. Contrary to expectations, high (resp. low) overall levels of seed and start-up investments lead to higher (resp. lower) <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> government VC <b>funds.</b> No significant relation between the level of high-tech VC investments and the <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> government VC <b>funds</b> is found.

50|$|It is {{important}} to note that as the <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> <b>funds</b> to the bank rises, some of the rationed people will get a loan, but at the same interest rate, which is still at the profit maximising level.

50|$|In {{macroeconomic}} perspective one of {{the consequences}} of the imperfect capital markets is insufficient investment. Since most of the time firms finance their investment from credit markets, lack of <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> <b>funds</b> leads to insufficient amount of investment causing inefficient allocation of funds in the economy. Even though it was true that every agent could borrow at the amount they were willing to, we could not have reached the efficient allocation because of the high market interest rate causing from the cost of screening and monitoring of the banks.|$|E
50|$|Open market {{operations}} are one tool within monetary policy {{implemented by the}} Federal Reserve to steer short-term interest rates. Using the power {{to buy and sell}} treasury securities, the Open Market Desk at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York can supply the market with dollars by purchasing U.S. Treasury notes, hence increasing the nation's money supply. By increasing the money supply or Aggregate <b>Supply</b> <b>of</b> <b>Funding</b> (ASF), interest rates will fall due to the excess of dollars banks will end up with in their reserves. Excess reserves may be lent in the Fed funds market to other banks, thus driving down rates.|$|R

50|$|It follows {{then that}} if {{the level of the}} {{interest}} rate that maximises the bank's expected return is lower than the level after which risky types drop out, there might be credit rationing, if the <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> <b>funds</b> is low enough. If the optimal rate (from {{the point of view of}} the bank) is between r1 and r2, then only some of the risky types will be rationed (the safe types are unwilling to borrow at such a rate); they will not be given credit even at higher rates. If the optimal rate is below r1, then borrowers of both types will be rationed.|$|E

5|$|In economics, the {{loanable funds}} {{doctrine}} {{is a theory}} of the market interest rate.

50|$|With the Truce {{more normal}} times arrived. The {{borrowing}} requirement went to zero {{with the arrival}} of the temporary peace and this probably helped the transition to voluntary lending. After the Truce ended in 1621 expenditures for war again rose steeply, but this time the Republic, and in particular Holland, had no trouble borrowing on average 4 million guilders annually, which helped keep down the rise in taxation that might otherwise have been necessary. By 1640 confidence in Holland's public debt (and the <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> <b>funds</b> available for borrowing) had risen so much, that a refinancing of the outstanding debt with a much lower interest rate of 5 percent was possible (followed in 1665 by a conversion to 4 percent).|$|E
5000|$|Second, Keynes re-analyzed {{the effect}} of the {{interest}} rate on investment. In the classical model, the <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> <b>funds</b> (saving) determines the amount of fixed business investment. That is, under the classical model, since all savings are placed in banks, and all business investors in need of borrowed funds go to banks, the amount of savings determines the amount that is available to invest. Under Keynes's model, the amount of investment is determined independently by long-term profit expectations and, to a lesser extent, the interest rate. The latter opens the possibility of regulating the economy through money supply changes, via monetary policy. Under conditions such as the Great Depression, Keynes argued that this approach would be relatively ineffective compared to fiscal policy. But, during more [...] "normal" [...] times, monetary expansion can stimulate the economy.|$|E
50|$|In perfect {{capital market}} case, {{assuming}} complete markets, perfect rationality of agents and under full information, the equilibrium occurs where {{the interest rates}} clear the market, with the <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> <b>funds</b> equal to the demand. This type of equilibrium is called Arrow-Debreu equilibrium, which is defined {{as there is a}} set of prices (in this case interest rates) under which demand and supply of the market are equal to each other. Moreover, we can analyze the firm's investment decision and its owner's consumption/saving decision separately (Fisher separation theorem). In addition to that, even in case of bankruptcy risk, the resulting optimum choice of firm will be efficient as the interest rate increases to capture the bankruptcy risk. Therefore, the possibility of default of the borrower is not a main driving force that leads to imperfect capital markets.|$|E
