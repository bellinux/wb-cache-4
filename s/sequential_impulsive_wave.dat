Additionally, a ghost cell method (GFM) is used to treat the boundary conditions near the particle-fluid interface.

40|$|The {{existence}} of large [...] scale magnetic {{fields in the}} universe {{has led to the}} observation that if gravitational waves propagating in a cosmological environment encounter even a small magnetic field then electromagnetic radiation is produced. To study this phenomenon in more detail we {{take it out of the}} cosmological context and at the same time simplify the gravitational radiation to <b>impulsive</b> <b>waves.</b> Specifically, to illustrate our findings, we describe the following three physical situations: (1) a cylindrical <b>impulsive</b> gravitational <b>wave</b> propagating into a universe with a magnetic field, (2) an axially symmetric <b>impulsive</b> gravitational <b>wave</b> propagating into a universe with an electric field and (3) a `spherical' <b>impulsive</b> gravitational <b>wave</b> propagating into a universe with a small magnetic field. In cases (1) and (3) electromagnetic radiation is produced behind the gravitational wave. In case (2) no electromagnetic radiation appears after the wave unless a current is established behind the wave breaking the Maxwell vacuum. In all three cases the presence of the magnetic or electric fields results in a modification of the amplitude of the incoming gravitational wave which is explicitly calculated using the Einstein [...] Maxwell vacuum field equations.
