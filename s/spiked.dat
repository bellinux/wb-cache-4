5|$|Players {{control a}} monocle- and pith helmet–wearing Velociraptor driving a jeep. The {{aim of the}} game is to attain a high score by {{performing}} stunts, damaging the jeep during collisions, collecting orbs, and killing the other Velociraptor which run around the area. The vehicle is equipped with a <b>spiked</b> ball and chain which can be deployed from the tailgate as many times as the player wishes. Deploying the <b>spiked</b> ball increases the difficulty of maneuvering the vehicle. The ball can be released from the chain at any time, if done so during a turn the weapon is launched forward. Players kill other Velociraptor by ramming them with the jeep or crushing them with the <b>spiked</b> ball which is dragged behind the vehicle. Slain dinosaurs can be dragged to exporters by the <b>spiked</b> ball and chain to gain extra points. Exporters are teleporting devices which transport the slain dinosaurs to the future.|$|E

40|$|Objective: Ripples (80 - 250. Hz) {{have been}} shown to be a more {{specific}} biomarker for the epileptogenic zone than epileptic <b>spikes</b> in intracranial EEG and even surface EEG. Ripples often co-occur with <b>spikes.</b> We investigated the spatiotemporal relation between <b>spikes</b> and ripples, and differences between <b>spikes</b> that do and do not co-occur with ripples. Methods: We marked 50 time points with <b>spikes</b> in bipolar surface EEG during NREM sleep in patients with focal or multifocal epilepsy. We marked ripples that occurred with <b>spikes</b> and calculated parameters relating <b>spikes</b> and ripples: the duration, amplitude and slope of <b>spikes,</b> the timing of the start of ripples and <b>spikes</b> and the proportion of overlap. Results: In total 219 ripples and 5995 individual <b>spikes</b> were marked in 31 patients. <b>Spikes</b> with ripples were on average shorter, had higher amplitude and higher slope than <b>spikes</b> without ripples. 64 % of ripples started before <b>spikes</b> started. <b>Spikes</b> occurred on 13 (5 - 26) channels per patient, and ripples on 3 (0 - 14) channels, which were also <b>spike</b> channels.

40|$|Cerebellar Purkinje cells receive two {{different}} excitatory inputs from parallel and climbing fibers, causing simple and complex <b>spikes,</b> respectively. Purkinje cells present three modes of simple <b>spike</b> firing, namely tonic, silent and bursting. The influence of complex <b>spike</b> firing on simple <b>spike</b> firing {{has been extensively}} studied. However, it is unknown whether and how the simple <b>spike</b> firing mode may influence complex <b>spike</b> waveform and firing rate in vivo. We studied complex <b>spike</b> firing during tonic and silent mode periods in non-anesthetized mice. We found that complex <b>spike</b> firing rate is not influenced by simple <b>spike</b> firing modes, but that the complex <b>spike</b> waveform is altered following high frequency simple <b>spike</b> firing. This alteration is a specific decrement of the second depolarizing component of the complex <b>spike.</b> We demonstrate that the amplitude of the second depolarizing component is inversely proportional to the simple <b>spike</b> firing rate preceding the complex <b>spike</b> and that this amplitude is independent of previous complex <b>spike</b> firing.

40|$|<b>Spike</b> {{trains are}} unreliable. For example, {{in the primary}} sensory areas, <b>spike</b> {{patterns}} and precise <b>spike</b> times will vary between responses to the same stimulus. Nonetheless, information about sensory inputs is communicated {{in the form of}} <b>spike</b> trains. A challenge in understanding <b>spike</b> trains is to assess the significance of individual <b>spikes</b> in encoding information. One approach is to define a <b>spike</b> train metric, allowing a distance to be calculated between pairs of <b>spike</b> trains. In a good metric, this distance will depend on the information the <b>spike</b> trains encode. This method has been used previously to calculate the timescale over which the precision of <b>spike</b> times is significant. Here, a new metric is constructed based on a simple model of synaptic conductances which includes binding site depletion. Including binding site depletion in the metric means that a given individual <b>spike</b> has a smaller effect on the distance if it occurs soon after other <b>spikes.</b> The metric proves effective at classifying neuronal responses by stimuli in the sample data set of electro-physiological recordings from the primary auditory area of the zebra finch fore-brain. This shows that this is an effective metric for these <b>spike</b> trains suggesting that in these <b>spike</b> trains the significance of a <b>spike</b> is modulated by its proximity to previous <b>spikes.</b> This modulation is a putative information-coding property of <b>spike</b> trains...|$|R
5000|$|Complex <b>spikes</b> are slow, 1-3 Hz <b>spikes,</b> {{characterized}} by an initial prolonged large-amplitude <b>spike,</b> followed by a high-frequency burst of smaller-amplitude action potentials. They are caused by climbing fiber activation and can involve the generation of calcium-mediated action potentials in the dendrites. Following complex <b>spike</b> activity, simple <b>spikes</b> can be suppressed by the powerful complex <b>spike</b> input.|$|R
40|$|Activation of the {{climbing}} fiber input powerfully excites cerebellar Purkinje cells via hundreds of widespread dendritic synapses, triggering dendritic <b>spikes</b> {{as well as}} a characteristic high-frequency burst of somatic <b>spikes</b> known as the complex <b>spike.</b> To investigate the relationship between dendritic <b>spikes</b> and the spikelets within the somatic complex <b>spike,</b> and to evaluate the importance of the dendritic distribution of climbing fiber synapses, we made simultaneous somatic and dendritic patch-clamp recordings from Purkinje cells in cerebellar slices. Injection of large climbing fiber-like synaptic conductances at the soma using dynamic clamp was sufficient to reproduce the complex <b>spike,</b> independently of dendritic <b>spikes,</b> indicating that neither a dendritic synaptic distribution nor dendritic <b>spikes</b> are required. Furthermore, we found that dendritic <b>spikes</b> are not directly linked to spikelets in the complex <b>spike,</b> and that each dendritic <b>spike</b> is associated with only 0. 24 +/- 0. 09 extra somatic spikelets. Rather, we demonstrate that dendritic <b>spikes</b> regulate the pause in firing that follows the complex <b>spike.</b> Finally, using dual somatic and axonal recording, we show that all spikelets in the complex <b>spike</b> are axonally generated. Thus, complex <b>spike</b> generation proceeds relatively independently of dendritic <b>spikes,</b> reflecting the dual functional role of climbing fiber input: triggering plasticity at dendritic synapses and generating a distinct output signal in the axon. The encoding of dendritic <b>spiking</b> by the post-complex <b>spike</b> pause provides a novel computational function for dendritic <b>spikes,</b> which could serve to link these two roles {{at the level of the}} target neurons in the deep cerebellar nuclei...|$|R
