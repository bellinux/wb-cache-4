50|$|In many projects, {{schedule}} performance (completing {{the work}} on time) is equal in importance to technical performance. For example, some new product development projects place a high premium on finishing quickly. It is not that cost is unimportant, but finishing the work later than a competitor may cost {{a great deal more}} in lost market share. It is likely that these kinds of projects will not use the lightweight version of EVM described in the previous section, because there is no planned timescale for measuring schedule performance. A second layer of EVM skill can be very helpful in managing the schedule performance of these “intermediate” projects. The project manager may employ a critical path or critical chain to build a project <b>schedule</b> <b>model.</b> As in the lightweight implementation, the project manager must define the work comprehensively, typically in a WBS hierarchy. He/she will construct a project <b>schedule</b> <b>model</b> that describes the precedence links between elements of work. This <b>schedule</b> <b>model</b> can then be used to develop the PV curve (or baseline), as shown in Figure 2.|$|E
50|$|It {{should be}} noted that {{measuring}} schedule performance using EVM does not replace the need to understand schedule performance versus the project's <b>schedule</b> <b>model</b> (precedence network). However, EVM schedule performance, as illustrated in Figure 2 provides an additional indicator — one that can be communicated in a single chart. Although it is theoretically possible that detailed schedule analysis will yield different conclusions than broad schedule analysis, in practice there tends to be a high correlation between the two. Although EVM schedule measurements are not necessarily conclusive, they provide useful diagnostic information.|$|E
40|$|Most of the {{literature}} on scheduling of multi-product batch process does not consider the uncertainties in demand and variability in processing times. We develop a simulation based variable production <b>schedule</b> <b>model</b> for a multi-product batch facility assuming zero wait transfer policy and single product campaign. The model incorporates the demand uncertainties and processing time variability. The impact of demand uncertainties is evaluated in terms of total annual cost, which comprises of the backorder and inventory costs per year. The effect of variability in processing time is measured by the annual production time. We also develop a constant production <b>schedule</b> <b>model</b> that has uncertain demand arrival, but the schedule is independent of demand variations. We compare the variable production <b>schedule</b> <b>model</b> with constant production <b>schedule</b> <b>model</b> in terms of the total annual cost incurred and subsequent results are presented.

40|$|Abstract. Batch {{service is}} a kind of {{specific}} stochastic service system which has broad application background. However, in practical, batch service exists commonly as one or several steps in a production or business process. Workflow management system (WfMS) is a powerful tool to support business processes modeling and execution. It has gained extensive attention from both industry and academic domain. But, it is a pity that the traditional WfMSs do not take the batch service into consideration, let alone provide the relevant supporting mechanism. This paper has done some in-depth research to introduce batch service to WfMS. It first discusses the batch service <b>schedule</b> <b>model</b> and proposes a workflow model to support it. Then, the problem and issues about improving the traditional WfMS to support batch service as well as the design and implementation details are analyzed deeply. ...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, {{parameterized}} dataflow {{has evolved}} {{as a useful}} framework for modeling synchronous and cyclo-static graphs in which arbitrary parameters can be changed dynamically.

This paper addresses this void; specifically, the paper investigates efficient {{field programmable gate array}} (FPGA) -based implementation of parameterized cyclostatic dataflow (PCSDF) graphs.

40|$|Purpose: This {{study is}} to develop a {{systematic}} approach for determining the most efficient patient appointment <b>scheduling</b> (PAS) <b>model</b> for a specific healthcare setting with its multiple appointments requests characteristics in order to increase patients’ accessibility and resource utilization, and reduce operation cost. In this study, three general appointment <b>scheduling</b> <b>models,</b> centralized <b>scheduling</b> <b>model</b> (CSM), decentralized <b>scheduling</b> <b>model</b> (DSM) and hybrid <b>scheduling</b> <b>model</b> (HSM), are considered. Design/methodology/approach: The integration of discrete event simulation and data envelopment analysis (DEA) is applied to determine the most efficient PAS model. Simulation analysis is used to obtain the outputs of different configurations of PAS, and the DEA based on the simulation outputs is applied to select the best configuration in the presence of multiple and contrary performance measures. The best PAS configuration provides an optimal balance between patient satisfaction, schedulers’ utilization and the cost of the scheduling system and schedulers’ training. Findings: In the presence of high proportion (more than 70 %) of requests for multiple appointments, CSM is the best PAS model. If the proportion of requests for multiple appointments is medium (25 %- 50 %), HSM is the best. Finally, if the proportion of requests for multiple appointments is low (less than 15 %), DSM is the best. If the proportion is in the interval from 15 % to 25 % the selected PAS model could be either DSM or HSM based on expert idea. Similarly, if the proportion is in the interval from 50 % to 70 % the best PAS model could be either CSM or HSM. Originality/value: This is the first study that determines the best PAS model for a particular healthcare setting. The proposed approach {{can be used in a}} variety of the healthcare settings.

In this paper, two <b>scheduling</b> <b>models</b> are proposed- joint <b>scheduling</b> <b>model</b> and aggregator <b>scheduling</b> <b>model.</b> They are used to study the effects of scheduling of EV charging on the day-ahead market price of electricity at various penetration levels of the EVs. Results from studies on an IEEE 30 -bus test system show that, at lower penetration of EVs, a simple scheduling method using fixed-period charging during low demand periods can be used, without a large increase in market price. But at higher penetration levels, the opposite holds true, requiring advanced scheduling methods such as proposed in this paper. Between the two, joint <b>scheduling</b> <b>model</b> results in a lower increase in electricity price and is further tested on a simplified Nordic day-ahead market model.
