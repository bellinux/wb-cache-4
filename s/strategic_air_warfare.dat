50|$|The {{theoretical}} {{distinction between}} tactical and <b>strategic</b> <b>air</b> <b>warfare</b> was developed {{between the two}} world wars. Some leading theorists of <b>strategic</b> <b>air</b> <b>warfare</b> during this period were the Italian Giulio Douhet, the Trenchard school in the United Kingdom, and General Billy Mitchell in the United States. These theorists were highly influential, both on the military justification for an independent air force (such as the Royal Air Force) and in influencing political thoughts on a future war as exemplified by Stanley Baldwin's 1932 comment that the bomber will always get through.|$|E

50|$|These early {{developments}} of aerial warfare led to two distinct branches {{in the writings}} of air warfare theorists: tactical air warfare and <b>strategic</b> <b>air</b> <b>warfare.</b> Tactical air warfare was developed as part of a combined-arms attack which would be developed to a significant degree by Germany, and which contributed much {{to the success of the}} Wehrmacht during the first four years (1939-42) of World War II. The Luftwaffe became a major element of the German blitzkrieg.|$|E
5000|$|Reactivated an {{intermediate}} command echelon of Strategic Air Command in March 1951, the 42d Air Division [...] "equipped and trained its assigned units to conduct <b>strategic</b> <b>air</b> <b>warfare</b> using nuclear or conventional weapons {{anywhere in the}} world. It also trained and maintained air refueling assets. Tankers from units assigned to the 42d supported the Eielson Tanker Task Force and, over the years, occasionally deployed to Spain for Spanish Area Support. The division conducted numerous staff assistance visits and simulated no notice inspections, and participated in exercises such as Buy None and Global Shield." ...|$|E

50|$|The {{following}} year, the division's bombardment units {{upgraded to}} the Boeing B-47 Stratojet and {{expanded to include}} air refueling squadrons flying Boeing KC-97 Stratotankers. The 98th Air Refueling Squadron moved to Lake Charles from MacDill Air Force Base, Florida in November 1953 and {{was assigned to the}} division. The squadron was inactivated a few days later and its personnel and equipment were transferred to the 68th wing's 68th Air Refueling Squadron. The division monitored and coordinated the units' manning, equipping, and training for global <b>strategic</b> <b>air</b> <b>warfare</b> on a global scale. In fulfilling its mission, the division participated in numerous tactical exercises.|$|E

"The 38th Air Division {{began on}} 10 October 1951 at Hunter Air Force Base, Georgia, {{to develop and}} prepare {{policies}} and procedures pertaining to bombardment, air and ground training, operations, flying safety, and security.

Its subordinate units participated in numerous training missions, which included simulated radar bombing and polar grid navigation, plus the Strategic Air Command bombing and navigation competition. During the 1950s, the division participated in and supported exercises such as Operations War Dance, Grey Warrior and Dark Night, and flew numerous air refueling sorties." ...|$|E
5000|$|Some leading theorists of <b>{{strategic}}</b> <b>air</b> <b>warfare,</b> namely strategic bombing {{during this}} period were the Italian Giulio Douhet, the Trenchard school in Great Britain, and General Billy Mitchell in the United States. These theorists thought that aerial bombardment of the enemy's homeland would be {{an important part of}} future wars. Not only would such attacks weaken the enemy by destroying important military infrastructure, they would also break the morale of the civilian population, forcing their government to capitulate. Although area bombing theorists acknowledged that measures could be taken to defend against bombers - using fighter planes and anti-aircraft artillery - the maxim of the times remained [...] "the bomber will always get through". These theorists for strategic bombing argued that it would be necessary to develop a fleet of strategic bombers during peacetime, both to deter any potential enemy, and also {{in the case of a}} war, to be able to deliver devastating attacks on the enemy industries and cities while suffering from relatively few friendly casualties before victory was achieved.|$|E
