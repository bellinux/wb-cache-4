5|$|In {{the period}} of rapid {{economic}} growth after World War II, environmental policies were downplayed {{by the government and}} industrial corporations; as a result, environmental pollution was widespread in the 1950s and 1960s. Responding to rising concern about the problem, the government introduced several environmental protection laws in 1970. The oil crisis in 1973 also encouraged the efficient use of energy because of Japan's lack of natural resources. Current environmental issues include urban air pollution (NOx, <b>suspended</b> <b>particulate</b> matter, and toxics), waste management, water eutrophication, nature conservation, climate change, chemical management and international co-operation for conservation.|$|E

40|$|Drip {{irrigation}} is {{the most}} effective and reliable method for reclaimed wastewater irrigation. Emitter clogging is the major problem for extending the drip irrigation technology. The existence of <b>suspended</b> <b>particulates</b> in irrigation water is the main reason for the emitter clogging. However, the reclaimed wastewater quality is extremely complex, and there is a series of physical, chemical, and biological reactions between <b>suspended</b> <b>particulates</b> and other materials contained such as microorganisms, which make the characteristics of <b>suspended</b> <b>particulates</b> in reclaimed wastewater complicated. In this paper, two types of widely used wastewaters treated with fluidized-bed reactor (FBR) and biological aerated filter (BAF) processes respectively were selected. The scanning electron microscope (SEM) technology and fractal theory were used to quantitatively describe the characteristics of the surface topography of <b>suspended</b> <b>particulates.</b> The results showed that the <b>suspended</b> <b>particulates</b> in two reclaimed wastewater were flocculent and porous. The pore system mainly consisted of solid <b>suspended</b> <b>particulates,</b> and most areas between the particulates were filled with microbes and extracellular polymers (EPS). The complex structure of biofilms was formed. That the biofilms grew and detached in irrigation system and deposited continuously at the inlet and outlet of labyrinth path was the major reason for the emitter clogging. The surface topography of <b>suspended</b> <b>particulates</b> in both reclaimed wastewaters showed fractal and multifractal characteristics, and the fractal dimension could not characterize the local and microsingularity of particulates but multifractal dimension could. The uniformity of the distribution of sediment pores increased with the size. Comparatively, the uniformity of <b>suspended</b> <b>particulates</b> in reclaimed wastewater treated by FBR was lower. With operation of reclaimed wastewater irrigation system, the average discharge of emitters decreased continuously with obvious fluctuations. The clogging degree of emitters was low during the first 256 h, and the clogging degree of the two types of reclaimed water was similar. But then, the degree of clogging increased greatly, and the FBR treatment on the emitters discharge were more obvious than BAF. It was closely related to the growth, detachments and sediment of biofilms in the irrigation system. Hence, using the reclaimed wastewater treated by BAF for drip irrigation is more suitable...|$|R

25|$|Atmospheric aerosol particles, {{also known}} as {{atmospheric}} particulate matter, particulate matter (PM), particulates, or <b>suspended</b> <b>particulate</b> matter (SPM) are microscopic solid or liquid matter suspended in Earth's atmosphere. The term aerosol commonly refers to the particulate/air mixture, {{as opposed to the}} particulate matter alone. Sources of particulate matter can be natural or anthropogenic. They have impacts on climate and precipitation that adversely affect human health.|$|E
25|$|Two {{alternative}} size-selective criteria, {{often used}} in atmospheric monitoring, are PM10 and PM2.5. PM10 is defined by ISO as particles which pass through a size-selective inlet with a 50% efficiency cut-off at 10 μm aerodynamic diameter and PM2.5 as particles which pass through a size-selective inlet with a 50% efficiency cut-off at 2.5 μm aerodynamic diameter. PM10 corresponds to the “thoracic convention” as defined in ISO 7708:1995, Clause 6; PM2.5 corresponds to the “high-risk respirable convention” as defined in ISO 7708:1995, 7.1. The United States Environmental Protection Agency replaced the older standards for particulate matter based on Total <b>Suspended</b> <b>Particulate</b> with another standard based on PM10 in 1987 and then introduced standards for PM2.5 (also known as fine particulate matter) in 1997.|$|E
40|$|ICP-MS {{method was}} {{used to analyze the}} {{concentration}} of heavy metals in the North and South discharging pollution river in Tianjin. Concentrations of 13 heavy metals in river water, <b>suspended</b> <b>particulates,</b> sediment, and soil sampled near the riverbank were obtained from lab examination. Results suggest that concentrations of these heavy metals ranged greatly, difference between concentrations in water and <b>suspended</b> <b>particulates</b> even exceed 10 magnitudes. Concentrations of Zn, Cu, Cr, Pb, Ni and Mo account for more than 90 % of the overall amount of heavy metals in each compartment. About 24 % of total amount of these metals was dissolved in the river water, dominant metals such as Zn, Cu, Cr and Pb are mostly (70 %- 90 %) absorbed on the <b>suspended</b> <b>particulates</b> and tend to deposit to the sediment. Average ratio between concentration of heavy metals in <b>suspended</b> <b>particulates</b> and sediment are 1. 3 - 11. 2, the high ratio may be caused by some high values in sample site of 1, 13, 17, 19, 20 and 23 ranged from 10. 9 to 55. 7, which indicate newly received waste water rich in some heavy metals near these sample sites. The composition of heavy metals and their spacial distribution style in river water, <b>suspended</b> <b>particulates,</b> sediment and soil are all similar, which indicate the possible transfer processes of heavy metals from water to other compartments and through soil runoff to water...|$|R

Greater Cairo's volatile aromatic hydrocarbon levels are higher than many other similar cities. Air quality measurements in Cairo have also been recording dangerous levels of lead, carbon dioxide, sulphur dioxide, and <b>suspended</b> <b>particulate</b> matter concentrations due to decades of unregulated vehicle emissions, urban industrial operations, and chaff and trash burning. There are over 4,500,000 cars on the streets of Cairo, 60% of which are over 10 years old, and therefore lack modern emission cutting features like catalytic converters. Cairo has a very poor dispersion factor because of lack of rain and its layout of tall buildings and narrow streets, which create a bowl effect.|$|E
25|$|Pollution is a {{major concern}} in Patna. According to the CAG report, tabled in the Bihar Legislative Assembly in April 2015, respirable <b>suspended</b> <b>particulate</b> matter (RSPM) level (PM-10) in Patna was 355, three-and-a-half times higher than the {{prescribed}} limit of 100 micro-gram per cubic metre, primarily due to high vehicular and industrial emissions and construction activities in the city. In May 2014, a World Health Organization survey declared Patna the second most air polluted city in India, only after Delhi, with the survey calculating the airborne particulate matter in the state capital's ambient air (PM-2.5) to be 149 micro-grams, six times more than the safe limit, which is 25 micro-grams. Severe air pollution in the city has caused a rise in pollution-related respiratory ailments, such as lung cancer, asthma, dysentery and diarrhoea. The dense smog in Patna during winter season results in major air and rail traffic disruptions every year.|$|E
25|$|Air pollution, or <b>suspended</b> <b>particulate</b> matter locally {{generated}} from the increased number of automobiles in the area, from point sources such as factories, dust carried into the air by construction activity, and the contribution of similar pollutants from the Los Angeles area has regularly caused the Inland Empire to be at, or near, the bottom of many air quality ratings. In 2004, the EPA rated the San Bernardino-Riverside area as having the worst particulate air pollution in the United States, (although the San Joaquin Valley in central California had the worst overall air pollution). Air pollution in the Los Angeles region is still an issue, although improvements have been made over the years. But the problem is exacerbated in the Inland Empire, which is surrounded by mountains on {{the north and the}} east. Prevailing winds move bad air eastward from Los Angeles, but once the pollution reaches the Inland Empire it cannot be carried further east as it becomes trapped by the mountains surrounding the region.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: This {{analysis}} {{assessed the}} association between blood pressure, meteorology, and air pollution in a random population sample. METHODS: Blood pressure measurements of 2607 men and women aged 25 to 64 years {{who participated in the}} Augsburg Monitoring of Trends and Determinants in Cardiovascular Disease survey were analyzed in association with 24 -hour mean concentrations of air pollutants. RESULTS: During the air pollution episode in Europe in January 1985, an association between blood pressure and air pollution was observed, which disappeared after adjustment for meteorology. Continuous concentrations of total <b>suspended</b> <b>particulates</b> and sulfur dioxide were associated with an increase in systolic blood pressure of 1. 79 mm Hg (95 % confidence interval [CI] = 0. 63, 2. 95) per 90 micrograms/m 3 total <b>suspended</b> <b>particulates</b> and 0. 74 mm Hg (95 % CI = 0. 08, 1. 40) per 80 micrograms/m 3 sulfur dioxide. In subgroups with high plasma viscosity levels and increased heart rates, systolic blood pressure increased by 6. 93 mm Hg (95 % CI = 4. 31, 9. 75) and 7. 76 mm Hg (95 % CI = 5. 70, 9. 82) in association with total <b>suspended</b> <b>particulates.</b> CONCLUSIONS: The observed increase in systolic blood pressure associated with ambient air pollution could be related to a change in cardiovascular autonomic control...|$|R

25|$|Respirable <b>suspended</b> <b>particulate</b> matter, of {{less than}} 10 {{micrometers}} (µm) in size, can {{be present in the}} drift from cooling towers. Larger particles above 10µm in size are generally filtered out in the nose and throat via cilia and mucus but particulate matter smaller than 10µm, referred to as PM10, can settle in the bronchi and lungs and cause health problems. Similarly, particles smaller than 2.5µm, (PM2.5), tend to penetrate into the gas exchange regions of the lung, and very small particles (less than 100 nanometers) may pass through the lungs to affect other organs. Though the total particulate emissions from wet cooling towers with fresh water make-up is much less, they contain more PM10 and PM2.5 than the total emissions from wet cooling towers with sea water make-up. This is due to lesser salt content in fresh water drift (below 2,000ppm) compared to the salt content of sea water drift (60,000ppm).|$|E

5000|$|A {{nephelometer}} [...] is {{an instrument}} for measuring concentration of <b>suspended</b> <b>particulates</b> in a liquid or gas colloid. A nephelometer measures <b>suspended</b> <b>particulates</b> by employing a light beam (source beam) and a light detector set to one side (often 90°) of the source beam. Particle density is then {{a function of the}} light reflected into the detector from the particles. To some extent, how much light reflects for a given density of particles is dependent upon properties of the particles such as their shape, color, and reflectivity. Nephelometers are calibrated to a known particulate, then use environmental factors (k-factors) to compensate lighter or darker colored dusts accordingly. K-factor is determined by the user by running the nephelometer next to an air sampling pump and comparing results. There is a wide variety of research-grade nephelometers on the market as well as open source varieties.|$|R
