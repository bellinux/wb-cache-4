40|$|Abstract — Sorting {{is one of}} {{the most}} basic {{problems}} of computer science and has been discussed continuously since the evolution of computer science. Several algorithms have been devised and applied and the work is still unfinished. For the parallel computing sorting is of same relevance as for sequential and very primitive problem domain too. Grain size is very important aspect of any parallel algorithm and is decisive in term of complexity. For the sorting problems minimum unit for sorting is two elements, since we apply a swap operation if required, and the two elements are sorted. This is considered to be the <b>single</b> <b>step</b> <b>operation.</b> In this paper we will increase primitive unit to four elements and four elements will be sorted in a single step. By applying this technique we can improve the performance of many parallel algorithms. Keywords—Parallel sorting; Bitonic; shear sort; Direct mapping...|$|E

40|$|In {{a series}} of 100 surgically treated patients, Zenker's {{diverticulum}} (ZD) appeared mostly as a typical geriatric disorder (50 % over 70 years) in which not only oesophageal symptoms but also pulmonary symptoms (37 %) {{may lead to a}} life-threatening situation. In 60 % of the patients, associated upper gastrointestinal pathology was observed, most frequently being gastro-oesophageal reflux (30 patients). In 30 % of the manometric studies of the oesophageal body and lower oesophageal sphincter, clear pathological patterns were observed. Morphological examinations, enzymohistochemistry, immunohistochemistry showed clear pathological changes not only {{at the level of the}} cricopharyngeal muscle but also at the level of the striated muscles of the cervical oesophagus. These clinical, manometric and morphological changes suggest that ZD is one expression of a more complex neurogenic disorder. They also justify the extramucosal myotomy of the cricopharyngeal wall and the striated muscle wall of the cervical oesophagus as well, as the cardinal step of operation. This myotomy was combined with a diverticulopexy resulting in no postoperative mortality and a minimum of morbidity.

40|$|It is {{frequent}} within tritium {{processing systems}} {{that a small}} amount of hydrogen isotopes (Q{sub 2 }) must be separated from an inert gas such as He, Ar and N{sub 2 }. Thus, a study of presently available technologies for effecting such a separation was performed. A base case and seven technology alternatives were identified and a simple design of each was prepared. These technologies included oxidation-adsorption-metal bed reduction, oxidation-adsorption-palladium membrane reactor, cryogenic adsorption, cryogenic trapping, cryogenic distillation, hollow fiber membranes, gettering and permeators. It was found that all but the last two methods were unattractive for recovering Q{sub 2 } from N{sub 2 }. Reasons for technology rejection included (1) the method unnecessarily turns the hydrogen isotopes into water, resulting in a cumbersome and more hazardous operation, (2) the method would not work without further processing, and (3) while the method would work, it would only do so in an impractical way. On the other hand, getters and permeators were found to be attractive methods for this application. Both of these methods would perform the separation in a straightforward, essentially zero-waste, <b>single</b> <b>step</b> <b>operation.</b> The only drawback for permeators was that limited low-partial Q{sub 2 } pressure data is available. The drawbacks for getters are their susceptibility to irreversible and exothermic reaction with common species such as oxygen and water, and the lack of long-term operation of such beds. More research is envisioned for both of these methods to mature these attractive technologies...|$|E
40|$|A {{solid-phase}} material {{suitable for}} large-scale chromatography should possess a high binding capacity for the target protein {{and have a}} high specificity of binding, {{in order to produce}} high purity products in a <b>single</b> <b>step</b> <b>operation.</b> The matrix and the attached ligand should be stable to cleaning solutions such as 0. 5 M sodium hydroxide. The ligand should be non-toxic and show and low rate of leakage from the matrix. Finally the ligand should be inexpensive to produce and immobilise onto the solid-phase matrix. Thiophilic chromatography has been used to purify immunoglobulins from bovine and human colostral whey (1, 2) and may have the potential to be suitable for large scale operation. The first thiophilic chromatography matrix (T-gel) was produced by reacting divinylsulphone-activated agarose wth 2 -mercaptoethanol. It has the chemical structure, P-OCH 2 CH 2 SO 2 CH 2 CH 2 SCH 2 CH 2 Oh where P represents the solid-phase. This small non-toxic ligand was shown to purify immunoglobulins from blood serum (3, 4, 5), tissue culture supernatants (6) and ascites fluid (7, 8) in the presence of ammonium and potassium sulphate salts. High purity (> 90 %) separations of immunoglobulins can be acheived in a single step. Modifications to the chemical structure of the ligand have been made (7) in an attempt to improve the purity of immunoglobulins produced from a tissue culture supernatant. The aims of this study are to determine the optimal conditions for the purification of immunoglobulins from cheese whey uing T-gel and to evaluate the separations performed by modified T-gel ligands.

Both compounds can inhibit bacterial cellular lipid biosynthesis and exhibited potent inhibitory activity against {{a broad range}} of antibiotic-resistant strains. We have accomplished an enantioselective total synthesis of platensimycin as it is described in Chapter 1. This chiral pool-based synthesis starts from the commercially available natural product (+) -carvone, which determines the stereochemistry of the final product. An asymmetric Horner-Wadsworth-Emmons reaction successfully set up the critical trisubstituted E -olefin. The key step was an innovative intramolecular Diels-Alder reaction, which provided the complex oxatetracyclic core together with four stereocenters, including two quaternary chiral centers present in the molecule, in a <b>single</b> <b>step</b> <b>operation.</b> Chapter 2 described our formal total synthesis of platencin. This concise synthesis utilized only nine steps starting from a commercially available material with 11 % overall yield, featuring a Michael cyclization to produce a symmetric diketone key intermediate and a radical cyclization to provide the complex core structure. ^ My thesis work also involved the design and synthesis of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (CoV) chymotrypsin-like protease (3 CLpro) inhibitors.

This thesis {{presents the results of}} an experimental and numerical study carried out to determine whether an EM forming process could be used to sharpen the radius of part pre-formed using a stamping process. Two processes were studied; a <b>single</b> <b>step</b> EM forming <b>operation</b> and a “hybrid forming” operation consisting of a conventional pre-forming step and an EM corner fill, both considering aluminum alloy AA 5754. The <b>single</b> <b>step</b> EM process proved unable to form acceptable samples due to excessive sample distortion, but was used to gain insight into the EM forming process. The hybrid operation consisted of pre-forming 1 mm AA 5754 sheet into a v-shape with a 20 mm outer radius using a conventional stamping operation and then reducing or “sharpening” the radius to 5 mm using EM forming. Sharpening the radius to 5 mm using conventional stamping was not achievable. The hybrid operation proved successful in forming the 5 mm radius, thus demonstrating that the material could be formed beyond its conventional formability limit using the hybrid operation. Numerical models were used to gain insight into the processes and the challenges involved in their numerical simulation. The numerical simulations showed that EM corner fill operation produces very high strain rates (10, 000 - 100, 000 s- 1) and complex three dimensional stress and strain states. The effect of the high strain rates could not be properly assessed, since no constitutive data was available for such high strain rates. The predicted stress states show that the process was not plane stress and that large through-thickness compressive stresses are produced that are favorable to damage suppression and through-thickness shear strains that increase ductility. The high strain rates and the complex stress and strain states are considered the likely causes for the observed increase in formability. The models provided valuable insight, but did not predict the final shape exactly and the possible reasons behind this are analyzed. The research indicates that features that are not achievable using traditional stamping techniques can be obtained with the hybrid EM forming process...|$|R
