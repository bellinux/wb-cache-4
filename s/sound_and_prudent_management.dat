40|$|Once bitten twice shy? A {{study on}} the {{effectiveness}} of administrative sanctions to discipline bank board members Marina Brogi 1 Inadequate corporate governance and risk management practices have been indicated among the determinants of the recent financial crisis and this refuelled the debate {{on the effectiveness of}} supervision and the overall architecture of prudential supervision for the safeguard of the stability of the overall banking system and of single banks. The design of the right incentives for a sounder and more prudent management of banks has attracted increasing attention. Though bank compensation issues are often addressed, little research focuses on board responsibility, reputation, name shame and hence on the role that well-designed administrative sanctions could play in the discipline of board members. First and foremost it is important to include sanctions in the corporate governance framework and to consider their impact on reputation. Secondly {{it is important to understand}} sanction effectiveness as a corporate governance measure. Based on a complete data set of inspections conducted and administrative sanctions issued by the Bank of Italy, the paper pursues the twofold objective of proposing a framework for the role of sanctions within the corporate governance of banks and assessing sanction effectiveness in the discipline of board members and in improving bank organization thereby enhancing <b>sound</b> <b>and</b> <b>prudent</b> <b>management...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{determinants}} {{and effects}} of administrative sanctions on banks performance: the Italian evidence The recent financial turmoil has refuelled {{the debate on the}} effectiveness of supervision and the overall architecture for the safeguard and stability of the international financial system. From this perspective, the design of the right incentives for a <b>sounder</b> <b>and</b> more <b>prudent</b> <b>management</b> of banks has attracted increasing attention, especially for those who are attempting to identify an effective discipline for bank organizations and their board members. Coherently with the evolution of financial markets and the increase of challenges which supervisory authorities have to face in order to guarantee a more reliable financial system, we move throughout an analysis of the evolution which has been characterizing the supervisory behaviour during last decade, in order to highlight which are the latest objectives supervisors are going to pursue in their undertaking. Thus, in order to investigate the effectiveness of the supervisory enforcements, we take into consideration the role of on-site inspections and sanctions inflicted by supervisory authorities. In particular, coherently with the objective to perform an analysis upon the effectiveness of supervisory action, we research for the determinants {{and effects of}} administrative sanctions issued by the Bank of Italy upon the Italian banks during the period from 1998 to 2009, in order to investigate, if any, a relation within the financial performance achieved by those banks before and after the sanction. To perform this analysis, we created a complete dataset including the entirety of administrative sanctions issued by the Bank of Italy during this period, which we matched with the economic performance achieved before and after the sanction by the banks included in our analysis. Because of its relevant conclusions, we consider this paper as particularly relevant for China and other Asian countries, given their developing financial infrastructure and extreme reliance on banks in providing financing to the economy...|$|R

40|$|This {{study has}} {{examined}} the trends in growth and instability in Indian agriculture at the district level and has identified distinctive features and drivers of productivity growth across districts. The productivity of crop sector has shown tremendous variations across districts both for {{the country as a}} whole and within a state.

The instability in productivity continues to persist and there are wide variations in instability across different districts. To mitigate the consequences of persisting instability, large-scale promotion of stabilization measures like insurance should be pursued vigorously. The analysis of district level data has revealed the important role of modern inputs in enhancing the productivity of crop sector.

Along with fertilizer-use, rainfall, irrigation, source of irrigation, better human resources and road connectivity have emerged as the other critical determinants of agricultural productivity.

He probably accomplished the tranquility of the island through diplomacy, as he himself married Lonomaikanaka, the daughter of Ahu-a-ʻI, and he afterwards married his son Kalaninuiomamao to Ahia, the granddaughter of Kuaana-a-ʻI and cousin to Kuahuia's son, Mokulani, and thus by this double marriage securing the peace and allegiance of the Hilo chiefs.

[...] But the late 1963 demolition of Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan had spawned a nascent historic preservation movement, and the 1905 Boathouseshared many features with the famous station. A preservation group, The Friends of Prospect Park, including in its membership, poet Marianne Moore, built public awareness over disappearing historical structures and threatened flora within the park.

40|$|Economic {{development}} {{requires the}} use of natural resources. Increasing population makes increasing demand on such resources thereby leading to the degradation of the environment. Excessive use of resources can lead to a situation where declining supply can no longer satisfy the demand. Hence, without conservation <b>and</b> <b>prudent</b> <b>management</b> of resources the environment cannot be preserved. This paper examines the case of water supply, which is the fundamental requirement for the sustenance of all life forms on earth. The human population is expected to double to at least 8 billion in the next 30 years and the worldwide demand for water is estimated to increase by a staggering 650 percent. However, the total supply of fresh water in the world is limited as 99 percent of the earth’s water is either saline or frozen. Of the remaining 1 percent most is ground water and soil moisture. The net availability of fresh water for human consumption is one-hundredth of 1 percent. And not even all of that can be used. Hence, how can the continued availability of fresh water resources to satisfy the growing need of the rising population be satisfied? Conservation of fresh water can be achieved to some extent by reducing the demand by imposing a price/or raising the prevailing price on {{the use of}} water. However, while conservation can stretch the supply by reducing demand, for ensuring the long-run adequacy of supply, it is necessary to apply a <b>prudent</b> environmental <b>management</b> policy which will prevent the destruction of forests and natural resources and apply a policy of active regeneration of forests. While the supplies of water make the forests survive and grow, preservation of forests allows water resources to survive. Forests cannot be preserved unless the destruction of hundreds and thousands of wetlands to make way for human settlement and industrial development is prevented and property rights of landless people are recognised. Thus for a <b>prudent</b> <b>and</b> efficient <b>management</b> of water resources to be effective, the state must adopt the ecologically sustainable approach to development.
