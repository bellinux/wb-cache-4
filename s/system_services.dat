To cope {{with the problem of}} declining network service dependability caused by safety threats, we proposed an autonomic method for optimizing <b>system</b> <b>service</b> performance based on Q-learning from the perspective of autonomic computing. First, we get the operations by utilizing the nonlinear mapping relations of the feedforward neural network. Then, we obtain the executive action by perceiving the state parameter changes of the network <b>system</b> in the <b>service</b> performance. Thirdly, we calculate the environment-rewarded function value integrated the changes of the <b>system</b> <b>service</b> performance and the service availability. Finally, we use the self-learning characteristics and prediction ability of the Q-learning to make the <b>system</b> <b>service</b> to achieve optimal performance. Simulation results show that this method is effective for optimizing the overall dependability and service utility of a system...|$|R

25|$|The early {{versions}} of Windows are {{often thought of}} as graphical shells, mostly because they ran on top of MS-DOS and use it for file <b>system</b> <b>services.</b> However, even the earliest Windows versions already assumed many typical operating system functions; notably, having their own executable file format and providing their own device drivers (timer, graphics, printer, mouse, keyboard and sound). Unlike MS-DOS, Windows allowed users to execute multiple graphical applications at the same time, through cooperative multitasking. Windows implemented an elaborate, segment-based, software virtual memory scheme, which allows it to run applications larger than available memory: code segments and resources are swapped in and thrown away when memory became scarce; data segments moved in memory when a given application had relinquished processor control.|$|E

The user interface is usually referred to as a shell and is essential if human interaction is to be supported.

With Windows Vista, Microsoft aimed {{to solve the problem}} in two ways: [...] First, local users no longer log into Session 0, thus separating the message loop of a logged-in user's session from high-privilege <b>system</b> <b>services,</b> which are loaded into Session 0. [...] Second, a new feature called User Interface Privilege Isolation (UIPI) was introduced, whereby processes can be further protected against shatter attacks by assigning an Integrity Level to each process. Attempts to send messages to a process with a higher Integrity Level will fail, even if both processes are owned by the same user. However, not all interactions between processes at different Integrity Levels are prevented by UIPI.

[...] Biomass tariffs were lowered by 10–15% on average, particularly for small systems. [...] The biomass tariff system itself was greatly simplified, with now four size categories and two fuel categories. [...] The degression for biomass was increased from 1% to 2%.
