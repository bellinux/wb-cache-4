"Yes, we {{can keep}} this road, which {{is no doubt that}} by which we {{travelled}} before, as far as the village which I heard them call Noyelle, then we shall have to <b>strike</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> the left, for that place was not far from Abbeville, and shall have to follow the Somme up some distance, unless we can find means of crossing it." ...|$|E

Move cautiously; take plenty of time until you are outside the lines; then see to it that you waste not a single moment, but push forward at your best speed, for the new day is near at hand." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Stepping {{out from}} behind my tree and looking back, I saw, through the black pillars of the nearer trees, the flames of the burning forest. It was my first fire coming after me. With that I looked for Weena, but she was gone. The hissing and {{crackling}} behind me, the explosive thud as each fresh tree burst into flame, left little time for reflection. My iron bar still gripped, I followed in the Morlocks' path. It was a close race. Once the flames crept forward so swiftly on my right as I ran that I was outflanked and had to <b>strike</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> the left. But at last I emerged upon a small open space, and as I did so, a Morlock came blundering towards me, and past me, and went on straight into the fire! ...|$|E

60|$|Then the thrall {{let himself}} {{down into the}} hole and Gizur went after him. But Swanhild {{sat there in the}} shadow of the rock, her chin resting on her hand, and waited. Presently, as she sat, she saw two men ride round the base of the fell, and <b>strike</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> the right towards a turf-booth which stood the half of an hour's ride away. Now Swanhild was the keenest-sighted of all women of her day in Iceland, and when she looked at these two men she knew one of them for Jon, Eric's thrall, and she knew the horse also--it was a white horse with black patches, that Jon had ridden for many years. She watched them go till they came to the booth, and it seemed to her that they left their horses and entered.|$|E
60|$|A hurried {{consultation}} {{was held}} {{between the two}} sheiks, and {{it was decided to}} <b>strike</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> the south-east again, {{and as soon as the}} followers arrived with the camels the united parties left the road and made across the country, Edgar taking his place on the camel behind Rupert. He still felt like one in a dream, and even now could scarce believe that it was really Rupert who was riding before him. The latter, who had been looking forward to the meeting, was yet scarcely less surprised at what had taken place. It had seemed such a hopeless task looking for Edgar over so wide an expanse of country that he could scarcely credit that he had succeeded in finding him, and for a time the feelings were so deep on both sides that hardly a word was spoken. It was not, indeed, until the camels came to a halt late in the evening that they began to talk naturally.|$|E
60|$|They mount; {{and this}} Parish tocsin happily ceases. They ride slowly Eastward, towards Sainte-Menehould; still hoping the Sun-Chariot of a Berline may {{overtake}} them. Ah me, no Berline! And near {{now is that}} Sainte-Menehould, which expelled us in the morning, with its 'three hundred National fusils;' which looks, belike, not too lovingly on Captain Dandoins and his fresh Dragoons, though only French;--which, in a word, one dare not enter the second time, under pain of explosion! With rather heavy heart, our Hussar Party <b>strikes</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> the left; through byways, through pathless hills and woods, they, avoiding Sainte-Menehould and all places which have seen them heretofore, will make direct for the distant Village of Varennes. It is probable {{they will have a}} rough evening-ride.|$|R
50|$|The {{last step}} in the process is to plot the lines of {{position}} LOP and determine the vessel's location. Each assumed position is plotted first. Best practise is to then advance or retire the assumed positions to correct for vessel motion during the interval between sights. Each LOP is then constructed from its associated AP by <b>striking</b> <b>off</b> the azimuth <b>to</b> the body, measuring intercept toward or away from the azimuth, and constructing the perpendicular line of position.|$|R

He was commended as International Reporter of the Year for his reports which Bob Geldof described as [...] "vivid, intelligent, moving and brave". Vallely {{was one of the}} few correspondents to leave the easy air routes to the feeding camps and <b>strike</b> <b>off</b> across country <b>to</b> find out what was really going on, according to Paddy Coulter, then Head of Media for the aid agency Oxfam. He uncovered a number of scandals the Marxist government were trying to keep hidden, was pronounced [...] "an enemy of the revolution", arrested by the secret police and was expelled from the country. He subsequently reported from across Africa, and elsewhere, covering wars and events in 30 different countries across the globe.|$|R
25|$|Unlike Lavoshin's formation, {{the eight}} 107 Squadron Phantoms from Hatzerim were flying a {{slightly}} different route to the target. These failed to spot any opening in the cloud cover over the target and therefore requested an alternate target. The Phantoms were diverted to bomb Syrian armor near Hushniyah, on the Golan Heights. Their strike decimated a tank column and allowed Israeli forces to push Syrian forces back over the pre-war ceasefire lines. The trailing 69 Squadron aircraft, having heard the 107 <b>strike</b> called <b>off,</b> returned <b>to</b> base after dumping their bombs and excess fuel in the Mediterranean, a decision which would later lead to much criticism from fellow pilots.|$|R

On 1 February 2016, after many delays over whether the UCLASS would specialize in strike or intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) roles, {{it was reported that}} {{a significant portion of the}} UCLASS effort would be directed to produce a Super Hornet-sized carrier-based aerial refueling tanker as the Carrier-Based Aerial-Refueling System (CBARS), with [...] "a little ISR" [...] and some capabilities for communications relay, and <b>strike</b> capabilities put <b>off</b> <b>to</b> a future version of the aircraft.

60|$|Still {{men were}} without {{faith in the}} strike. When Daylight, with his heavy outfit of flour, arrived {{at the mouth of}} the Klondike, he found the big flat as desolate and tenantless as ever. Down close by the river, Chief Isaac and his Indians were camped beside the frames on which they were drying salmon. Several old-timers were also in camp there. Having {{finished}} their summer work on Ten Mile Creek, they had come down the Yukon, bound for Circle City. But at Sixty Mile they had learned of the <b>strike,</b> and stopped <b>off</b> <b>to</b> look over the ground. They had just returned to their boat when Daylight landed his flour, and their report was pessimistic.|$|R

50|$|Ordered not to {{concentrate}} on any particular ship, but to cripple as many as possible, planes from Natoma Bay conducted two strikes against the enemy within {{an hour and a}} half. At 09:26 a third strike, with 500 pound SAP bombs in lieu of torpedoes, was launched. At 11:18, a fourth <b>strike</b> was sent <b>off</b> <b>to</b> push the maneuvering enemy away from Leyte Gulf, but with neither torpedoes nor armor-piercing bombs aboard, the planes took off carrying only general purpose bombs and depth charges. At noon, Natoma Bay's fighters, launched previously for CAP, were landed, rearmed and sent up again. At 12:56 and at 15:08, the 5th and 6th strikes were launched to further pursue the enemy as it retreated toward San Bernardino Strait. Fighter planes, armed with 250 pound (113 kg) general purpose bombs, were among those dispatched with the last strike.|$|R

6000|$|August 10th, at {{six in the}} morning, Schwerin, {{and under}} him the Young Dessauer,--who {{had arrived in the}} Southwestern suburbs of Breslau overnight, with 8,000 foot and horse, and had posted {{themselves}} in a vigilant Anti-Neipperg manner there, and laid all their plans,--appear at the Nicolai Gate; and demand, in the common way, transit for their regiments and baggages: [...] "bound Northward," [...] as appears; [...] "to Leubus," [...] where something of Pandour sort has fallen out. So many troops or companies at a time, that is the rule; one quantity of companies you admit; then close and bolt, till it have marched across and out at the opposite Gate; after which, open again for a second lot. But in this case,--owing to accident (very unusual) of a baggage-wagon breaking down, and people hurrying to help it forward,--the whole regiment gets in, escorted as usual by the Town-guard. Whole regiment; and marches, not straight through; but at a certain corner <b>strikes</b> <b>off</b> leftward <b>to</b> the Market-place; where, singular to say, it seems inclined to pause and rearrange itself a little. Nay, more singular still, other regiments (owing to like accidents), from other Gates, join it;--and--in fact--"Herr Major of the Town-guard, in the King's name, you are required to ground arms!"

2500|$|In early 1932, May was {{involved}} in another manhunt, this time for Albert Johnson, soon known as the [...] "Mad Trapper of Rat River." [...] While serving a search warrant for illegal trapping on the Rat River, Constable King of the RCMP was shot and wounded by Johnson, sparking off a long chase that became front-page news across the continent. Johnson killed Constable Edger Millen. May was again hired {{to see if he}} could find Johnson, who had seemingly disappeared. On February 13, May solved the mystery when he noted a set of footprints leading off from caribou tracks in the middle of the frozen river. Johnson had been following their tracks to hide his own, but had <b>to</b> <b>strike</b> <b>off</b> the path <b>to</b> set up camp at night. Following the trail over the next few days, the RCMP rounded a bend on the river on February 17 to find Johnson in the middle of the trail again, unable to dodge for the bank without his snowshoes on. A firefight broke out during which one of the RCMP officers was seriously wounded and Johnson killed. May arrived just after the action ended. He landed beside the injured officer and flew him [...] to a doctor and was credited with saving his life.|$|R
