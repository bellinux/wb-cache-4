5|$|In the 1980s and 1990s, Sky Sports and the BBC's Grandstand {{programme}} {{covered the}} British Hockey League and Superleague and their important games and competitions regularly. However, in 2001 the Superleague sold its broadcasting rights to 'Premium TV Ltd' {{who planned to}} set up a new sports channel, which never materialised. British ice hockey was left without coverage from any television network. This situation continued through the final seasons of the Superleague and into the first seasons of the Elite League. In 2005, Elite League officials concluded an agreement with the North American Sports Network to provide a weekly highlights and news programme. These usually provide highlights from a game recorded the previous weekend and are an hour in length. In September 2007 the Elite League announced a deal with Sky Sports for a weekly show of Elite League highlights. In 2010 Sky Sports showed the playoff final between the Belfast Giants and Cardiff Devils live, {{this was the first time}} <b>Sky</b> <b>had</b> shown a live game for several years. Sky Sports have recently announced plans to show 8 live games along with a weekly highlight show during the 2010–11 season. In season 2013–14 Premier Sports acquired the rights to film and broadcast 23 games from the Elite League with a live game shown every Saturday night from 23 November onwards.|$|E
5|$|In past Zelda titles, {{the team}} had made {{numerous}} new fields for player exploration, but this time they limited the number of overworlds to three and expanded their content so players {{would be able to}} full appreciate them through repeated visits. The team also created the world based on their experiences with Twilight Princess: feeling that the overworld and dungeons were too large with puzzles too thinly dispersed, the team both sought to compact areas and have environmental puzzles in the overworld. The biggest difficulty was ensuring that players could reach areas quickly while still discovering new features and puzzles. The creation of the Skyloft overworld was due to difficulties connecting the three Surface-based overworlds with each other due to drastically contrasting environments. The sky was initially going to be presented similar to the course selection screen from the Super Mario series, but this was changed to an overworld with its own quests and population so Link had a place where he could prepare for his adventures. An initial idea, when jumping down from the sky seemed unlikely to be approved, was to have a huge tower acting as a central hub, with the height at which Link jumped lengthening the duration of his free fall. Once the concept of traveling from the <b>sky</b> <b>had</b> been chosen instead, the Loftwing mounts were created so it looked and felt more rational to players. These overlapping gameplay mechanics triggered the creation of Skyloft, along with elements of the early game such as the Knight Academy. The continual movements and routines of Skyloft's people were modeled after similar time-driven mechanics from , with similar links between character-specific side quests and the main narrative. Despite the aerial element, the mechanics necessary for free navigation meant a Loftwing racing minigame could not be implemented.|$|E
25|$|There {{were some}} {{questions}} about whether <b>Sky</b> <b>had</b> even been in the car that morning to begin with. Motorists who had passed the parked Acura did not report seeing anything unusual, not even a child in it. At Biryukova's apartment complex in Redmond, neighbors {{said she and her}} children rarely went out, and none of them had seen Sky for at least two weeks. Solomon was not aware of anyone having seen his son other than his ex-wife since an April doctor visit. However, Maile told the police that <b>Sky</b> <b>had</b> indeed been in the car that morning.|$|E

25|$|The Aztec world {{consisted}} of three main parts: the earth world on which humans lived (including Tamoanchan, the mythical origin of human beings), an underworld which belonged to the dead (called Mictlan ("place of death")), and the upper plane in the sky. The earth and the underworld were both open for humans to enter, whereas the upper plane in the sky was impenetrable to humans. Existence was envisioned as straddling the two worlds in a cycle of birth, life, death and rebirth. Thus {{as the sun was}} believed to dwell in the underworld at night to rise reborn in the morning and maize kernels were interred to later sprout anew, so the human and divine existence was also envisioned as being cyclical. The upper and nether worlds were both thought to be layered. Mictlan had nine layers which were inhabited by different deities and mythical beings. The <b>sky</b> <b>had</b> thirteen layers, the highest of which was called Omeyocan ("place of duality") and served as the residence of the progenitor dual god Ometeotl. The lowest layer of the sky was a verdant spring-like place with abundant water called Tlalocan ("the place of Tlaloc").|$|E
500|$|The {{growth of}} the rivalry during the 1990s {{attracted}} the attention of broadcasters and has led to fixtures being rescheduled from the 3pm blackout period to primetime viewing in the United Kingdom. League matches are often broadcast on Sky Sports – once as early as 11:15am, while cup games have aired on mainstream channels, BBC One and ITV. At the height of the rivalry, the games on <b>Sky</b> <b>had</b> been billed as title deciders, and play was summarised by Martin Tyler and Andy Gray. The April 2003 match at Highbury, advertised as [...] "Face Off", was seen by a British audience of 3.4million, while the 2005 Cup final was watched by more than 480million viewers worldwide.|$|E

500|$|In October 2005 a {{group of}} {{students}} from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology carried out an experiment with 127 one-foot (30cm) square mirror tiles, focused on a [...] wooden ship at a range of around 100feet (30m). Flames broke out on a patch of the ship, but only after the <b>sky</b> <b>had</b> been cloudless and the ship had remained stationary for around ten minutes. It was concluded that the device was a feasible weapon under these conditions. The MIT group repeated the experiment for the television show MythBusters, using a wooden fishing boat in San Francisco as the target. Again some charring occurred, along {{with a small amount of}} flame. In order to catch fire, wood needs to reach its autoignition temperature, which is around 300°C (570°F).|$|E
500|$|The {{magazine}} was {{originally intended to}} be a vehicle for reprinting novels. [...] The title and format were an echo of Two Complete Detective Books Magazine, which had been published, also by Fiction House, in the 1930s. [...] The first issue included Isaac Asimov's Pebble in the Sky, and L. Ron Hubbard's [...] "The Kingslayer". [...] Both of these were reprints: Pebble in the <b>Sky</b> <b>had</b> been published by Doubleday earlier in the year, and [...] "The Kingslayer" [...] had appeared in Hubbard's short story collection The Kingslayer, published by Fantasy Publishing Company, Inc., in 1949. [...] Subsequent issues abandoned the policy of reprinting two novels, and for a while each issue featured one original story and one reprint. [...] In some later issues both stories were original.|$|E
500|$|Earthless' last studio album, Rhythms from a Cosmic <b>Sky,</b> <b>had</b> {{come out}} in 2007, and their live album Live at Roadburn (on which {{an early version of}} [...] "From the Ages" [...] was recorded) in 2008; further {{releases}} had been delayed since then as members of Earthless were becoming increasingly pre-occupied with other matters. Constant touring in 2008 and 2009 kept the band out of the studio, drummer Mario Rubalcaba began playing with Off! and guitarist Isaiah Mitchell became involved with Howlin' Rain. Mitchell also moved to northern California, which reduced the available time to rehearse with Earthless (who are based in San Diego). After three rehearsals, the band recorded the album in two days, recording much of it live the first day and additional details the following day, in San Francisco with producer Phil Manley in his studio, Lucky Cat Recording.|$|E

500|$|Lana was a [...] "pretty" [...] Canadian {{high school}} student. She left her {{old high school}} due to {{homophobic}} bullying, {{and as a result}} she became [...] "very closeted". Describing the character, Natasha Norton from AfterEllen stated [...] "She comes across at first as a touch flighty, as if she can't quite make up her mind as to who she wants to be, but it soon becomes abundantly clear that Lana's carefully constructed façade has a purpose." [...] Following her arrival in Erinsborough, Lana befriended Serena Bishop (Lara Sacher). They both learned that they had been taken advantage of by [...] "sleazy" [...] photographer Chris Cousens (Simon Mallory). Serena's cousin, Sky, took an instant dislike to Lana. <b>Sky</b> <b>had</b> learned that Lana had flirted with her boyfriend, leaving her [...] "less than impressed". During a game of basketball, Sky began feuding with Lana, and they started a brawl on the court. Of filming the fight, Neval stated, [...] "We wanted to make it look spontaneous, and really gritty and brawly. It {{was a lot of fun}} learning how to choreograph a fight and how to be aware of the other actor and not actually hurt them." ...|$|E
500|$|Notwithstanding the {{excellent}} {{state of the}} wooden panel prior to its 1998 restoration, the painting was unevenly covered with layers of dust and yellowed varnish. This was particularly pronounced {{in the area of}} the sky, obscuring many fine details and altering this area's colouring. Once these layers were removed, it was discovered that the original grey-blue <b>sky</b> <b>had</b> been repainted with broad strokes of a deep blue dye mixed with a fixing agent. An analysis of the blue pigments in the painting showed that the original blue colour, still discernible as a bright line above the horizon, was composed of azurite, while the blue pigment in more superficial layers was true ultramarine or lapis lazuli. The ultramarine layer has been identified as prussian blue, a pigment which was favoured from the early 18th century onwards. Additional alteration of the painting is well attested in parish accounts; the painting was [...] "varnished and somewhat restored" [...] by the painter Aline Bernard (1841–1910) in 1885, and a second time in 1907 by a Nils Janzon. The latter restoration was probably limited to the addition of a thick layer of varnish.|$|E

Routine British artillery night firing stopped around half an hour before dawn and birdsong could be heard. At [...] the mines began to detonate. After the explosions, the British artillery began to fire at maximum rate. A creeping barrage in three belts [...] deep began and counter-battery groups bombarded all known German artillery positions with gas shell. The nine attacking divisions and the three in reserve began their advance as the German artillery reply came scattered and late, falling on British assembly trenches after they had been vacated.|$|E

500|$|Lacking a {{publisher}} for Diamond Trust of London, Rohrer moved onto other {{projects such as}} Inside a Star-Filled Sky and Sleep is Death. He also took on work at Gun, a video games consultancy firm, and there he made contact with Mark Seremet, CEO of Zoo Publishing. Zoo was interested in pursuing Diamond Trust of London as a limited physical release on their indiePub label, and so work on the game resumed. To provide the game's soundtrack, Rohrer approached his friend and former band-mate, Tom Bailey. This {{was the first time}} that Rohrer had collaborated with others on his games. He cited this collaboration as helping to [...] "restore [...] creative momentum" [...] for the project. To avoid hearing exactly the same music every time the game is played, Rohrer developed a music generation engine which would arrange Bailey-composed loops procedurally depending on the game's state. If the lid of the Nintendo DS is closed with headphones plugged in while the game is still running, it will act as a random music generator. [...] Rohrer's previous project, Inside a Star Filled <b>Sky,</b> <b>had</b> used entirely computer generated music, but he felt that the thematic demands of Diamond Trust of London required Bailey's handcrafted compositions and musicianship.|$|E
500|$|The {{panels are}} in {{relatively}} good condition given their age. The Philadelphia version is better preserved; it has superior tonalities and more prominent colours. [...] In 1906, Roger Fry {{gave it a}} well-documented restoration with overpaint removed. Fry {{was at the time}} Curator of Paintings at the Metropolitan Museum and performed restorations despite a formal lack of training; the St Francis was the second restoration he undertook. He attributed the work to Hubert van Eyck, and thought the Turin version a copy. His removal of a section at the top revealed a red border; he wrote that van Eyck had [...] "conceived it as a miniature in oil on panel, and that it might indicate a date not very far removed from the drawings of the Turin Book of Hours" [...] (Milan-Turin Hours). In 1926 he recorded: [...] "When it came to me, the panel was considerably larger at the top, and dull opaque sky concealed the join where the extra piece had been added on to satisfy some owner who did not appreciate the compressed composition [...] of the original. The <b>sky</b> <b>had</b> been enlivened... with a crowd of small white-cloud like forms suggesting the presence of a cohort of angels." [...] His restoration removed more than 10 centimetres; before the restoration it measured , afterwards [...]|$|E
500|$|Beneath a Steel Sky {{became the}} second game to use Revolution's Virtual Theatre engine, after Lure of the Temptress. According to Cecil, the {{original}} version of the engine seemed less applicable in Beneath a Steel Sky, {{as the ability to}} issue commands conflicted with the gameplay they intended to create. Lure of the Temptress had one story that was moved forward by a key event, whereas Beneath a Steel <b>Sky</b> <b>had</b> multiple threads. In one way this presented them with [...] "exciting gameplay opportunities, but in others it cordoned off more ambitious ideas in terms of multilinearity." [...] As a consequence, some of the engine's features were scaled back. Tony Warriner and David Sykes, both Revolution co-founders and programmers, had to update the engine, which was part of the new deal with Virgin Interactive. As an example of change in the updated engine, Virtual Theatre 2.0, Warriner explained that in Lure of the Temptress, the system controlled everything, for instance specific routines to a door. So if there was a door on-screen, the door-routine was called up to handle it. The consequence was that every door looked the same and acted the same, so if a door was somewhat different from the last one, it caused a problem. This was changed in the new system, as it was object oriented and no distinction was made between a proper object like a door or key.|$|E
