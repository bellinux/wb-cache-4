The discussion of the SGR program is broken into three categories: (1) general research and development, dealing with reactor physics, fuels and materials, components, etc., (2) experimental reactors, operating or in some phase of design or constnuction, and (3) power demonstration reactors, operating or in a design or constnuction phase.

40|$|A core {{parameter}} {{study of}} the operating costs was performed for a 300 - Mwe <b>sodium</b> <b>graphite</b> <b>reactor,</b> a scale-up of the Hallam Power Reactor. The {{results of the study}} indicate that the core design is nsar optimum and that core modifications would reduce the power costs by less than 5 %. The lattice spacing, fuel rod diameter, and sodium flow can be varied within a rather broad range without significant changes in power generation costs. The effect of the fuel cladning thickness is more significant; fuel cycle costs can be reduced if stainless steel canning is replaced with zirconium canning. Use of UC in place of uraniummolybdenum fuel would also permit cost reductions. (D. L. C. ...|$|E

The safety of this design is due to its unusually low operating pressure, absence of chemically incompatible materials in the core, and excellent stability under atatic and dynamic conditions.

40|$|Nuclear {{parameter}} variations {{are presented}} for <b>sodium</b> <b>graphite</b> <b>reactors</b> using Pu-spiked natural U as fuel. The fuel feed {{is assumed to}} be natural U, and the important variables are the initial amount of excess reactivity, lattice spacing, and alpha, the ratio of Pu/sup 239 / to U/sup 235 / in the feed material. The system is called "steady state" in that the ratios, N/sub 40 /N/sub 49 / = sigma /sub c(49) // sigma /sub a(40) / and N/sub 41 //N/sub 4 9 / = sigma /sub c(49) / / sigma /sub a(41) /, obtained from setting the build-up equations to zero are assumed for the feed concentrations, and the feed material to the reactor is always the same. During irradiation, the U/sup 235 / and U/sup 238 / concentrations steadily decline while the Pu isotope concentrations initially increase, then decline. To ensure sufficient plutonium for feed material, it is necessary to remove the fuel from the reactor before the Pu content drops below its initial value. Although the reactivity variations presented were calculated specifically for <b>sodium</b> <b>graphite</b> <b>reactors,</b> they may be applied to any thermal reactor using Pu-spiked natural U as fuel. The reactivity changes are determined primarily by the fuel characteristics and are only slightly dependent on the other material in the reactor core.
