30|$|In this article, an {{iterative}} regularization model (IRM) with adaptive parameter is addressed. IRM {{has gained}} a lot of attentions. But constant <b>scale</b> <b>parameter</b> becomes very sensitive for the fast convergence. It becomes very important to optimize the <b>scale</b> <b>parameter</b> adaptively. Therefore, we introduce a novel IRM with varying <b>scale</b> <b>parameter</b> {{because of the fact}} that when the <b>scale</b> <b>parameter</b> is smaller, the number of the iteration will enhance by IRM. A method to estimate a <b>scale</b> <b>parameter</b> is proposed according to the trend of the <b>scale</b> <b>parameter.</b> And the theoretical justification for this approach can be inferred.

[...] The prior for the variance also has two hyperparameters, one specifying the sum of squared deviations of the pseudo-observations associated with the prior, and another specifying once again the number of pseudo-observations. [...] Note that each of the priors has a hyperparameter specifying the number of pseudo-observations, and in each case this controls the relative variance of that prior.

Satellite laser ranging (SLR) data are used in the orbit determination algorithm, which consists of dynamics model, observation model and filtering algorithm composed of the batch unscented transformation. TOPEX/Poseidon SLR data are used by utilizing the normal point (NP) data observed from ground station. The filtering algorithm includes a repeated series of processes to determine the appropriate <b>scaling</b> <b>parameters</b> for the batch unscented transformation. To determine appropriate <b>scaling</b> <b>parameters,</b> general ranges of the <b>scaling</b> <b>parameters</b> of α, β, κ, λ are established.

Appropriate <b>scaling</b> <b>parameters</b> are determined for observation data obtained from several observatories, by analyzing the relationship between tuning properties of the <b>scaling</b> <b>parameters</b> and estimated orbit precision.
