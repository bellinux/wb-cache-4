40|$|Peralkaline silicic magmas were erupted at Pantelleria in {{a variety}} of eruptive typologies and magnitudes: {{pyroclastic}} flows, Plinian to strombolian pumice fallout and lava flows. The initial cycle (330 - 180 ka) was characterized mainly by effusive activity, and was followed by an intermediate cycle (181 - 85 ka), characterized by a clear drift to explosive activity. This period, onto we focus, is bracketed by six ignimbrite-forming eruptions (older and intermediate of the two caldera collapses at 140 and 50 ka that characterize the volcanological history of the island, which drained silicic and variably peralkaline magma for a cumulative volume close to 6 km 3 DRE. These ignimbrites lack of continuity among the few outcrops (commonly in vertical scars) and also suffer from <b>strong</b> <b>welding</b> and rheomorphism. First reconstructions and correlations [Mahood and Hildreth, 1986], although still valid for many aspects, suffer from the poor precision of K/Ar ages, especially when Ar excess and xenocrystic contamination are common, as is the case for Pantelleria lavas and pyroclastic rocks. Recently, new correlations based on paleomagnetic methods [Speranza et al., 2012] succesfully identified and correlated two welded pyroclastic breccias outcropping in the NE and SW sectors of the island with the old caldera collapse, and also demonstrated the equivalence of two other ignimbrite units previously considered as separate eruptions. Based on 14 new 40 Ar/ 39 Ar ages (laser heating on anorthoclase feldspar separates) ages and petrographic data, we propose an updated stratigraphy for the intermediate period and to provide accurate age brackets to the correlations. Recently, the application of 40 Ar/ 39 Ar methods on much younger (age < 20 ka) silicic lavas and tephra at Pantelleria [Scaillet et al., 2011], demonstrated highly precise and contributed to unravel the complex post-Green Tuff stratigraphy. Our results can be summarized as follows: - The pre-La Vecchia caldera eruptive history ended with the emplacement of two trachytic ignimbrites (at 181 ± 1. 2 ka and 171 ± 1. 7 ka), which were emplaced only in the south sector of the island. Both were truncated by the old (La Vecchia) caldera collapse. - The age of the old caldera collapse is now tightly constrained between 139 - 146 ka, i. e. the new age of the welded pyroclastic breccia (previously undated). that represents the caldera-forming eruption [Speranza et al., 2012]. - After the La Vecchia caldera collapse, the first ignimbrite eruption occurred at 123 ka with a trachy-comenditic and crystal-rich unit emplaced in the NE to NW sectors of the island. - At 107 ka a crystal-rich trachytic ignimbrite was erupted, together with some fines-rich lobes that (K/Ar ages) were previously considered as two different units, but with similar 40 Ar/ 39 Ar ages. - Higher up in the stratigraphic sequence, two previously considered different ignimbrites (for an inferred volume of erupted magma close to 1. 5 km 3 DRE) demonstrated coeval by 40 Ar/ 39 Ar dating, and together are part of an eruptive paroxysm at 85 ka comparable in magnitude to the Plinian eruption of the Green Tuff (age 50 ka), - The the recurrence time of the above mentioned eruptions, for a cumulative erupted magma volume close to 6 km 3 DRE, suggest {{that at the end of}} the inter-eruptive period 85 - 50 ka the production and evolution rates of pantellerite magma peaked to reach a maximum peralkalinity...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{purpose of}} the work was to {{determine}} the capabilities of the pulse effect of electric current and pressure to produce welded joints of various component parts of different thickness from 18 - 10 stainless steel and titanium. Application of electric current pulses on the surfaces of contacting metallic conductors leads to considerable changes in the surface structure. Depending on the initial state of the surfaces and parameters of the pulse effect this can result in melting without formation of joints, formation of a <b>strong</b> <b>welded</b> joint with characteristics no worse than those of welded metals, and in destruction of the contact zone. A combination of a short electric pulse with simultaneous application of mechanical pressure in the weld zone causes high-speed deformation of the contact zone. The process of joint formation itself does not cause any appreciable diffusion during welding. The greatest energy emission and the maximal heating occur on the contacting surfaces being welded with the passage of an electric current pulse through the welding zone. Simultaneously with intensive heating, and due to applied pressure, high-speed deformation of materials takes place and a <b>strong</b> <b>welded</b> joint is formed. Optimal parameters for the welding of titanium and 18 - 10 stainless steel have been determined {{on the basis of the}} tests conducted.

40|$|Though butt-welds {{are among}} the most {{preferred}} joining methods in aerostructures, their strength dependence on inelastic mechanics is generally the least understood. This study investigated experimental strain distributions across a thick aluminum U-grooved weld and identified two weld process considerations for improving the multipass weld strength. One is the source of peaking in which the extreme thermal expansion and contraction gradient of the fusion heat input across the groove tab thickness produces severe angular distortion that induces bending under uniaxial loading. The other is the filler strain hardening decreasing with increasing filler pass sequences, producing the weakest welds on the last weld pass side. Both phenomena are governed by weld pass sequences. Many industrial welding schedules unknowingly compound these effects, which reduce the weld strength. A depeaking index model was developed to select filler pass thickness, pass numbers, and sequences to improve depeaking in the welding process. The result was to select the number and sequence of weld passes to reverse the peaking angle such as to combine the <b>strongest</b> <b>weld</b> pass side with the peaking induced bending tension component side to provide a more uniform stress and <b>stronger</b> <b>weld</b> under axial tensile loading...|$|R

Preparation is needed for all forms of welding and all types of joints. Generally, butt welds require very little preparation, but some is still needed for the best results.

50|$|Despite its diversity, {{forge welding}} had many {{limitation}}s. A primary limitation {{was the size}} of objects that could be forge welded. Larger objects required a bigger heat source, and size reduced the ability to manually weld it together before it cooled too much.

50|$|The oldest flux {{used for}} forge welding was fine silica sand. The iron or steel would be heated in a {{reducing}} environment within the coals of the forge.

Electrodes containing calcium fluoride (CaF2), sometimes known as basic or low-hydrogen electrodes, are hygroscopic and must be stored in dry conditions. They produce <b>strong</b> <b>welds,</b> but with a coarse and convex-shaped joint surface. Electrodes coated with cellulose, especially when combined with rutile, provide deep weld penetration, but because of their high moisture content, special procedures must be used to prevent excessive risk of cracking.

40|$|Abstract- Resistance Spot Welding (RSW) is {{a process}} that is widely used in the {{automotive}} industries. The parameters that are used to develop a spot weld are the welding current, weld time and electrode force. Electrode force was not used as a control parameter due to the use of pneumatic system to actuate the welding electrode. The pneumatic system does not allow the development of closed loop control system; therefore electrode force was not used to control the growth of the spot weld nugget. This reported work looks into the ability to control electrode force dynamically during welding by using servomechanism. Force profiles were introduced in this work and the electrode force during welding was controlled to follow these force profiles. Based on the findings, the developed controller was able to control the electrode force during welding to follow the given force profiles. Decreasing the electrode force during welding facilitates the initiation of spot weld growth earlier in the weld cycle which in turn produces bigger <b>weld</b> diameter and <b>stronger</b> <b>weld</b> strength.

The interface effect is best quantified by the value of J integral, J(interface), obtained over a path around the interface of the bodies in the yield zone. The paper presents finite element analysis of minute yield zone, formed at Mode I crack tip in linear elastic regime, across a strength mismatched interface to determine J(interface). The yield zone, treated as Dugdale's cohesive zone, is isolated from the bimetallic body domain and modeled alone under the action of cohesive stresses. Effect of farfield load at the interface is obtained separately.

40|$|Abstract. There {{are many}} steels which are {{stronger}} than 2000 MPa, with toughness values exceeding 100 MPa m 1 / 2 and which have been in commercial service for many decades. Examples include the marageing alloys and carbide–free bainitic steels. By contrast, welding consumables with a proof strength in excess of 1000 MPa {{are few and far}} between. This is because whereas wrought steels can be thermomechanically processed to optimise their performance, most weld metals have to used in the as–cast condition and with impurity concentrations which are greater than is desirable. The weld metal can readily be made strong but without an accompanying ability to absorb energy during fracture, it cannot be used in practice. A variety of experimental and theoretical approaches towards <b>stronger</b> <b>weld</b> metals are assessed here. The modern trend has been towards low-carbon mixed microstructures of bainite and martensite. This is because none of the other phases such as allotriomorphic ferrite and Widmanstätten ferrite are capable of the required strength. Conventional wisdom that the toughness of martensite can be enhanced by increasing the nickel concentration has in general proved to be unreliable. Nickel is effective only when the manganese concentration is kept to a minimum. The mechanism of the synergy between manganese and nickel is discussed in the light of recent high–resolution experiments conducted at Chalmers University and ESAB in Sweden...|$|R

The weld geometries used included mainly T-joint samples, and also butt welds were done, and some further analyses were done on CWF and shear samples made previously. Three different Design of Experiments (DOE) matrices were used to create three sets of T-joint samples which were analyzed to understand the interactions among the process parameters. The usual analysis of variance was extended by multivariate analysis to better define the individual roles of each of the process parameters. Cross-sections of the various types of welds were examined. DOE matrices were also performed on butt welds where the samples were either 3 mm thick welded to 3 mm thick samples, or 6 mm thick to 6 mm thick welds.
