50|$|A {{worm gear}} is {{a species of}} helical gear, but its helix angle is usually {{somewhat}} large (close to 90 degrees) and its body is usually fairly long in the axial direction. These attributes give it screw like qualities. The distinction between a worm and a helical gear is {{that at least one}} tooth persists for a full rotation around the helix. If this occurs, it is a 'worm'; if not, it is a 'helical gear'. A worm may have as few as one tooth. If that tooth persists for several turns around the helix, the worm appears, superficially, to have more than one tooth, but what one in fact sees is the same tooth reappearing at intervals {{along the length of the}} worm. The usual <b>screw</b> <b>nomenclature</b> applies: a one-toothed worm is called single thread or single start; a worm with more than one tooth is called multiple thread or multiple start. The helix angle of a worm is not usually specified. Instead, the lead angle, which is equal to 90 degrees minus the helix angle, is given.|$|E
50|$|The Pentalobe {{security}} <b>screw</b> (Apple <b>nomenclature),</b> or pentalobe <b>screw</b> drive, is a five-pointed tamper-resistant system primarily used by Apple in its products. Pentalobe screws {{have been}} used by Apple since 2009, when they were first implemented in the 15-inch MacBook Pro. They have since been used on other MacBook Pro, MacBook Air and iPhone models. Apple attracted criticism upon the introduction of the pentalobe screw; it was seen as an attempt to lock individuals out of their devices.|$|R
