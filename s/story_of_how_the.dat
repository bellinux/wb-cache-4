5|$|Stymied, Black {{and fellow}} Group member Lara Means (Kristen Cloke) {{investigate}} the ship, finding several bodies {{hidden in a}} crate, all having died of exposure.

However, they all agree that after she boarded, crew were discovered daily, dead of exposure on the ship's bow; Law had the woman chained up in the belief she was responsible.|$|E
5|$|The American robin has a {{place in}} Native American mythology. The <b>story</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> <b>the</b> robin got its red breast by fanning the dying flames of a campfire to save a Native American man and a boy is {{similar to those that}} {{surround}} the European robin. The Tlingit people of Northwestern North America held it to be a culture hero created by Raven to please the people with its song. One of the houses of the Raven Tribe from the Nisga'a Nation holds the robin as a house crest.|$|E
5|$|In The Greek Myths (1955), Robert Graves views Oenopion as his {{perennial}} Year-King, at {{the stage}} where the king pretends to die {{at the end of}} his term and appoints a substitute, in this case Orion, who actually dies in his place. His blindness is iconotropy from a picture of Odysseus blinding the Cyclops, mixed with a purely Hellenic solar legend: the Sun-hero is captured and blinded by his enemies at dusk, but escapes and regains his sight at dawn, when all beasts flee him. Graves sees the rest of the myth as a syncretism of diverse stories. These include Gilgamesh and the Scorpion-Men, Set becoming a scorpion to kill Horus and the story of Aqhat and Yatpan from Ras Shamra, as well as a conjectural <b>story</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> <b>the</b> priestesses of Artemis Opis killed a visitor to their island of Ortygia. He compares Orion's birth from the bull's hide to a West African rainmaking charm and claims that the son of Poseidon should be a rainmaker.|$|E

5|$|S Club 7 {{first came}} to public {{attention}} in 1999, when they starred in their own television series, Miami 7. The show first aired on CBBC on BBC One and was a children's sitcom based {{on the lives of}} the group who had moved to Miami, Florida in search of fame in America. The show was also launched in the United States, airing on Fox Family, and later on ABC Family; it was retitled S Club 7 in Miami for American audiences. The show eventually celebrated worldwide success and was watched by 90 million viewers in over 100 different countries. The group also filmed two specials between the first two series of their show. The first, Back to the '50s—which aired on CITV, instead of CBBC—told the <b>story</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> <b>the</b> group found themselves back in 1959. In the second TV special, Boyfriends & Birthdays, Stevens' boyfriend gave her an ultimatum of staying with him or remaining with S Club.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} home of Clan MacIntyre is likewise {{the subject of}} conjecture. There is general agreement that the clan arose in the Hebrides, the islands west of the Scottish mainland. Some accounts, however, identify Skye as the ancestral home, while another tradition holds Islay {{to have been the}} locale. The <b>story</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> <b>the</b> clan made its way to the mainland and settled along the shore of Loch Etive in the vicinity of Ben Cruachan is again shrouded in myth and magic. It is said that seeking fresh pastures for their cattle they were initially obstructed by a mountain spirit. After testing their perseverance and courage the spirit instructed them to make their new home where the white cow in their herd should first lie down to rest. This site became known as Glen Noe.|$|E

50|$|<b>Stories</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> <b>the</b> Kipferl — and so, ultimately, the {{croissant}} — {{was created}} are widespread and persistent culinary legends, {{going back to}} the 19th century.

50|$|Mott {{was founded}} in 1904 when {{territory}} was opened to settlers. There are conflicting <b>stories</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> <b>the</b> city was named.

5|$|The Powerpuff Girls Movie was {{released}} in the United States on July 3, 2002, by Warner Bros. and Cartoon Network.

25|$|This is {{the central}} {{district}} of the region. One of the most notable vineyards {{in this area is}} known as Doctorberg, and its wines as Bernkasteler Doctor.

25|$|The {{trial began}} on February 5, 1923. Day after day the {{prosecution}} called {{a series of}} victims, bilked out of their life savings, to the stand. The star witness, however, was Len Reamey, one of the gang's bookmakers, fourth in the hierarchy behind Blonger, Duff, and bookmaker Jackie French. Reamey provided the inside <b>story</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> <b>the</b> gang defrauded hundreds of victims and divided the spoils among themselves. When the prosecution rested after seven weeks of testimony, the defense attorneys surprised everyone by resting their case without presenting a witness, and further by offering to forgo their closing arguments if the prosecution did the same. Van Cise directed the special prosecutors to call their bluff, and so the case went immediately to the jury without any closing arguments.|$|E
50|$|The first {{noble rot}} wines were likely created by accident—both the Hungarians and the Germans have similar <b>stories</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> <b>the</b> harvest was delayed for some reason, but the mouldy grapes were vinified anyway and then {{found to be}} delicious. Given that {{propensity}} to noble rot {{was a factor in}} Hungarian vineyard demarcations some 50 years before a messenger was supposedly mugged on his way to Schloss Johannisberg in Germany, the Hungarians probably have a better case.|$|R
50|$|There {{are many}} <b>stories</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> <b>the</b> charango {{came to be}} made with its {{distinctive}} diminutive soundbox <b>of</b> armadillo.
