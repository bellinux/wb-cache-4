40|$|A {{test was}} devised to {{investigate}} a forced spring transition from perennial ryegrass, back to Tifway (419) bermudagrass with <b>scalping</b> as the main treatment. <b>Scalping</b> of the turf was combined with various nitrogen and aerification treatments performed initially on May 22, 1997. Turfgrass aeration, either with or without extra nitrogen applications, when combined with an initial <b>scalping</b> operation, did not enhance bermudagrass transition by twenty-eight days after treatment (DAT), {{at the end of}} June 1997. Turfgrass color, quality and density were adversely affected from initial aerification treatments, especially when combined with initial <b>scalping,</b> The turf recovered best from multiple applications of nitrogen (applied at <b>scalping</b> and again at 7 DAT). Turfgrass density (visual estimates) showed that in conjunction with <b>scalping,</b> two applications of nitrogen, totaling 1. 5 lbs. /month, without aerification, provided a dense turf at 16 DAT, which was second only to the untreated control plot. At 27 DAT, <b>scalping</b> + N + N + aerification treated plots had the highest estimate of visual density, eventually showing a benefit from aerification. <b>Scalped</b> and aerified turf alone (no nitrogen) had unacceptable turf density at 16 DAT and 27 DAT. Generally, two 0. 75 lb. /N/m applications with aerification proved beneficial over the single application of nitrogen plus aerification, when both turfs were initially <b>scalped.</b> Although non-significant statistically, the additional treatment of nitrogen provided 10 % more bermudagrass cover than the single application of nitrogen, for turfs both overseeded and <b>scalped.</b> <b>Scalping</b> alone, plus a single application of N, produced 33 % less bermudagrass by June 30, then that of the untreated control...|$|R

5|$|Humans, horses, and orangutans {{are among}} the few species that may grow their head hair very long. Humans are {{believed}} to have lost their fur 2.5–3 million years ago as hominids when transitioning from a forest habitat to the open savanna, as an effect of natural selection, since this development made it possible to run fast and hunt animals close to the equator without getting overheated. An exception was however head hair, which was kept to provide thermal insulation of the <b>scalp</b> from the sun, to protect against ultra-violet radiation exposure, and also to provide cooling (when sweat evaporates from soaked hair). The ability to grow straight hair, has been observed among Homo sapiens sub-groups in less sunny regions further away from the equator. Relative to kinky Afro-textured hair, straight hair allows more UV light to pass to the <b>scalp</b> (which is essential for the production of vitamin D, that is important for bone development).|$|E

5000|$|Back-lay sports {{arbitrage}} {{is often}} called [...] "scalping" [...] or [...] "trading". <b>Scalping</b> is not actually arbitrage, but short term trading. In the context of sports arbitrage betting a <b>scalping</b> trader or scalper looks to make lots of small profits, which in time can add up. In theory a trader could turn a small investment into large profits by re-investing his earlier profits into future bets so as to generate exponential growth. <b>Scalping</b> relies on liquidity in the markets and that the odds will fluctuate around a mean point. A key advantage to <b>scalping</b> on one exchange is that most exchanges charge commission only on the net winnings in a particular event, thus ensuring that even the smallest favorable difference in the odds will guarantee some profit.|$|R

5|$|The maximum {{terminal}} hair length {{depends on}} the length of the anagen (period of hair growth) for the individual. Waist-length hair or longer is only possible to reach for people with long anagen. The anagen lasts between 2 and 7 years, for some individuals even longer, and is followed by shorter catagen (transition) and telogen (resting) periods. At any given time, about 85% of hair strands are in anagen. The fibroblast growth factor 5 (FGF5) gene affects the hair cycle in mammals including humans; blocking FGF5 in the human <b>scalp</b> (by applying a herbal extract that blocked FGF5) extends the hair cycle, resulting in less hair fall and increased hair growth.|$|E
