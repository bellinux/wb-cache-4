5000|$|Numerous {{frameworks}} {{are available}} that describe development {{and help to}} organize observations of learning behavior. Intelligence theories {{date back to the}} 19th century and the early 20th century, such as Charles Spearman's concept of general intelligence factor, or g. Though there were exceptions (e.g., Thorndike), most theories of intelligence included g, a general index of cognitive ability.An intelligence theory that has drawn considerable attention is Cattell-Horn-Carroll (CHC), which is grounded in extensive factor analytic research from cognitive ability test databases, as well as studies of development and heritability. CHC is actually an amalgam of Cattell-Horn Gf-Gc theory and Carroll's three-tier model. proposed a framework with the broadest level a general intelligence factor conceptually similar to Spearman's g. This general factor was divided into eight narrower abilities, each consisting of narrow factors. Cattell-Horn's model was similar on several fronts, including its hierarchical structure. In the 1990s, Carroll's model was combined with Cattell-Horn's work by Flanagan, McGrew, and Ortiz (2000). [...] CHC contains three strata: stratum III is g, stratum II consists of broad cognitive abilities, and stratum I consists of narrow cognitive abilities. The broad cognitive abilities (stratum II) include fluid reasoning (or Gf, forming and recognizing logical relationships among patterns, inferencing, and transforming novel stimuli) and comprehension-knowledge (or Gc, using language and acquired knowledge). There is on-going discussion by proponents of CHC about g's importance in the framework. The Structure of Intellect (SOI) model includes three axes (with 5-6 components per axis) that form a 3-dimensional cube; because each dimension is independent, there are 150 different potential aspects of intelligence. [...] Howard Gardner has written about several categories of intelligence, as opposed to a hierarchical model.Neuropsychologists have sought to map various mental abilities onto brain structures. In so doing they have created frameworks that include factors and sub-components. Luria organized brain functions into now-familiar categories, such as speech and memory. Luria's conception of attention included three units: Unit 1 (brainstem and related areas) regulates cortical activity and levels of alertness, Unit 2 (lateral and posterior regions of neocortex) analyzes and stores newly received information, and Unit 3 (frontal lobes) programs and regulates activity. [...] More recently, the PASS (Planning, Attention, Successive, and <b>Simultaneous)</b> <b>model</b> yields both a global index of ability while emphasizing specific cognitive processes. For example, [...] "successive" [...] refers to information that is perceived, interpreted, and/or remembered in a serial order (e.g., language), whereas [...] "simultaneous" [...] refers to material that is perceived, interpreted, and/or remembered as a whole (e.g. visual-spatial).|$|E

The purpose of this thesis is to show the difference between sequential and simultaneous models that we use in traffic planning for our calculations of trip distribution and mode choice.

Using our data, we estimate simpler models with more restrictive assumptions commonly found in the literature, and find substantial differences between these estimates and those from the <b>simultaneous</b> <b>model.</b> For example, the positive relationship between worktime and health found in other studies disappears when the relevant simultaneities are accounted for.

40|$|Correct {{interaction}} of asynchronous hardware protocols requires verification. Performance {{and power of}} asynchronous hardware circuits and protocols can be vastly improved by modifying them with judicious application of timing constraints. A methodology is presented for verifying larger asynchronous protocols through compositional model checking with symbolic methods. This approach uses Relative timing constraints for modeling timed asynchronous hardware protocols and hence is generic for timed and untimed protocols. This paper illustrates the modeling technique for interleaving and simultaneous models with relative timing, which helps in pruning state space. Properties which are verified for ensuring correctness of composed models are explained. Case studies of a linear pipeline controller and C-Element are discussed by applying BDD and SAT methods. The <b>simultaneous</b> <b>model</b> yields better execution times when compared to interleaving for large number of compositions.

The empirical results show that the proposed approach not only better fits the data of consumer choice and negotiated price, but it also provides additional insights into buyers' and sellers' behaviors in comparison with models that study only consumer choice or the negotiated price, but not both simultaneously. choice models, negotiation, simulation-based estimation methods...|$|E
