25|$|Another {{prominent}} {{feature on}} many folding knives is the opening mechanism. Traditional pocket knives and Swiss Army knives commonly employ the nail nick, while modern folding knives more often use a <b>stud,</b> <b>hole,</b> disk, or flipper {{located on the}} blade, all which {{have the benefit of}} allowing the user to open the knife with one hand.|$|E
50|$|A {{hoof pick}} or {{horseshoe}} nail can help remove the plug prior to insertion of a screw-in stud. A special instrument called a T-tap {{is used to}} clean out the stud holes before the stud is screwed in, or {{it can be used to}} re-tap the <b>stud</b> <b>hole</b> if the threads are damaged. Additionally, a small metal brush can be used to help clean threads which are especially dirty. A wrench is used to tighten or loosen the studs.|$|E

An actuator (20) exerts a compressive- and/or tractive force for expansion and constriction of the recess and/or deformation of the retaining element. The recess is designed in form of a <b>stud</b> <b>hole</b> or a slot. The actuator is designed as a mechanical element, piezoelectric element, thermo-mechanical element, and hydraullicaly or pneumatically acting element. USE - Flexibly deformable retaining element e. g. electrostatic retaining element and vacuum retaining element, for electrostatically retaining a plate shaped substrate e. g. wafer or mask, at a surface for processing semiconductor components or producing micromechanical elements. ADVANTAGE - The retaining element allows positionable retaining of the substrate at the surface by electrostatic force effect or low pressure, so that flatness deviations or undesired deformations of the substrate can be compensated in a simple and secure manner...|$|E

5000|$|For {{cost-saving}} purposes, the CB650 {{was designed}} to be produced on the same production line as the CB550 predecessor, using the existing tooling. The CB650's cylinder block was a new design, but it shared the <b>stud</b> <b>holes</b> of the earlier bike, which may explain why the bike could not be a full 650cc machine. Likewise, the frame was almost identical to that of the CB550. Handlebar levers and instruments (speedometer and tachometer) were also carried over from the earlier model. The CB650 produced a claimed [...] @ 9,000 rpm.|$|R
5000|$|... "Filing-to-fit" [...] {{of certain}} parts during {{production}} limited interchangeability. The exposed rear sight had no protective ears and was vulnerable to breakage. The adjustable front sight {{could be lost}} if the retaining screw wasn't tightly secured. The weapon was susceptible to jamming if grime clogged the bolt's locking recess in the receiver. The two small magazine guide retaining pins and corresponding receiver <b>stud</b> <b>holes</b> were tapered allowing disassembly and assembly only from one direction—right to left for disassembly, and left to right for assembly; adding unacceptable levels of complexity in a combat environment. The retaining pins had to be delicately pounded out whenever the bolt needed to be removed for cleaning. During the reassembly process, if the retaining pins were inserted {{too much or too}} little when reassembling, the receiver might not fit back into the tight confines of the stock.|$|R
50|$|Minibrix were {{construction}} kits manufactured from 1935 to 1976 in the UK. Developed in 1935, they enabled {{children to}} build their own miniature houses. Like the later and more famous construction toy, Lego, Minibrix consisted primarily of interlocking bricks with moulded studs on the surface, but being invented before the availability of modern plastics they were made of hard rubber which had the necessary ability to deform under pressure to allow firm interlocking of <b>studs</b> and <b>holes.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Several {{manufacturers}} produce MDM {{machines for}} the specific purpose of removing broken tools (drill bits, taps, bolts and studs) from work pieces. In this application, the process is termed [...] "metal disintegration machining" [...] or MDM. The metal disintegration process removes only {{the center of the}} tap, bolt or <b>stud</b> leaving the <b>hole</b> intact and allowing a part to be reclaimed.|$|R
50|$|Lego Technic system expands on {{the normal}} LEGO bricks {{with a whole}} range of new bricks that offer new {{function}} and building styles. The most significant change from normal LEGO is that single-stud wide bricks ('beams') have circular holes through their vertical face, positioned in-between the <b>studs.</b> These <b>holes</b> can accommodate pins, which enable two beams to be held securely together side-by-side, or hinged at an angle. The holes also act as bearings for axles, on which gears and wheels can be attached to create complex mechanisms. Stud-less beams (studs are the bumps traditionally associated with Lego parts), referred to as 'liftarms' were first introduced in 1989 and through the 1990s and 2000s and increasing number of liftarm designs have been introduced over time.|$|R
5000|$|The Attachment Unit Interfaces {{that were}} used with 10BASE5 [...] "thick net" [...] in the 1980s and 1990s used DA15 {{connectors}} for connectivity between the Medium Attachment Units and (Ethernet) network interface cards, albeit with a sliding latch to lock the connectors together {{instead of the usual}} hex <b>studs</b> with threaded <b>holes.</b> The sliding latch was intended to be quicker to engage and disengage and to work in places where jackscrews could not be used for reasons of component shape.|$|R
40|$|An {{explanation}} is {{provided for the}} slab behaviour in composite beams at web holes where the concrete slab carries heavy vertical shear. This {{is based on the}} truss concept, and requires consideration of shear <b>studs</b> in the <b>hole</b> region as vertical tension members. According to this, a structural action between the concrete slab and shear connectors for carrying or transferring vertical shear to the steel beam was clearly identified. On the basis of the slab behaviour identified, truss idealizations capable of determining the slab shear carrying capacity in a rational manner were developed. Then, the ultimate strength for composite beams at web holes was formulated including the truss idealizations. Another ultimate strength analysis accounting for the slab shear carrying capacity in a simple manner, which was also developed during this research project, is given. This provided the fundamental solution procedure for the plastic analysis used. A series of nine tests was carried out with particular attention being directed to the verification of the proposed truss analogy. The major test parameters included the configurations of the <b>studs</b> in the <b>hole</b> region, the width of the concrete slab and stud detailing near the high moment end of the hole. The ultimate strength predictions were made by the two methods developed, and compared with previous and present test results...|$|R
50|$|Traditional five-card <b>stud</b> {{involves}} one <b>hole</b> {{card with}} four cards face-up, making it simple {{for even a}} novice to read the possible hand strength of an opponent effectively. The transparency of a player's hand cuts out much of the element of uncertainty found in more popular games like Texas hold 'em, Omaha hold 'em and Seven-card stud. In order to enlarge that element of uncertainty variants {{increase the number of}} hole cards, add a high-low split, play with a stripped deck, introduce a twist round, enable the player to do a 'roll your own' game or even create new and interesting hand rankings.|$|R

2500|$|The helmet is {{considered}} to be a Celtic version of a Roman auxiliary helmet, combining a Roman shape with La Tène style decoration. It is in the shape of a conical cap with a peaked neck guard. It is made from a single sheet of bronze, possibly spun finished, and has repoussé decoration in the La Tène style, similar to that found on the Waterloo Helmet, on the neck guard and on the fragmentary side pieces. On the neck guard are two flat domed bosses with criss-cross grooves which would originally have held red glass enamel <b>studs.</b> There are <b>holes</b> on either side for attachment to a chin-strap or cheekpiece, and a hole at the top of the helmet for the attachment of a plumed top-knot. On the outer margin of the helmet are incised two strokes which could represent the Roman number [...] "II".|$|R
40|$|Creep {{degradation}} of steam carrying {{vessels in the}} power generation industry is a concern {{that needs to be}} constantly monitored. The Weldcore® process has been earmarked as a potential method of creep sampling which will allow for thick-walled sections to be analysed. A component of the process involves plugging the resultant hole after removing a creep sample using a novel welding technique called friction hydro pillar processing. At the commencement of this study, insufficient data was available to warrant safe industrial application of the process. This research was conducted to evaluate the performance of 10 CrMo 910 friction hydro pillar process welds. The effects of downward force, <b>stud</b> taper angle, <b>hole</b> taper angle and hole base diameter on process response, defect population, static properties and dynamic performance were evaluated. The variation of downward force showed that higher forces produce significantly smaller defects and higher fatigue life. The occurrence of defects was linked to process parameters and geometry thereby identifying the correct parameters for safe use in the power generation industry. Flash formation was identified as an early indicator of weld defects and can assist with quality control in industrial applications. Methods of standardising the plunge depth and forge force were developed to identify the correct magnitudes for different geometries, without the need for testing. Defects were shown to populate specific regions of the weld and produce variations in fatigue life. Crack initiation sites were detected which will aid in identifying areas of focus in further research and development. Temperature measurements were linked to the occurrence of defects and crack initiation sites and have been identified as a method of identifying defective welds. The effects of process parameters and <b>stud</b> and <b>hole</b> taper angles on energy inputs and near interface temperatures were statistically evaluated. Downward force was shown to have the largest effect on energy input rates, total energy input and temperatures at the 11. 5 mm and 20. 5 mm positions. Smaller <b>hole</b> and <b>stud</b> taper angles produced lower energy inputs and were identified as more energy efficient than the larger taper angles. A regression model was also developed to predict the fatigue life of welds and can assist with critical process related decision making. A range of hole base diameters were identified which produced welds with low defect populations and fatigue performance {{similar to that of the}} parent plate. Larger hole base diameters were shown to produce significant defects along the hole bottom fillet, in the weld nugget and along the bond line. Temperature measurements of the larger diameter welds showed a delay in response and are attributed to a delayed contact of plasticised stud material with the sidewall. Welds with hole base diameters larger than 11 mm produced unrepeatable and defective welds, and also required higher energy inputs making smaller diameters more desirable. Analysis of all welds in this study revealed that clearance and interfacial pressures characterise the quality of friction hydro pillar process welds, therefore models were developed to aid in critical decision making with respect to downward force and geometry. This study has successfully evaluated the effects of process parameters and geometry on the properties of friction hydro pillar process welds and thereby has increased understanding of the process...|$|R
