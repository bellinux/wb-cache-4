40|$|The {{dissertation}} investigates {{whether there}} is a place of refuge for women characters within and/or beyond American literary texts written by men {{around the turn of the}} twentieth century. Besides major and minor texts of leading American men of letters, Henry Adams and Henry James, the texts also include two Dutch novels, Multatuli's Max Havelaar and Frederik van Eeden's Van de koele meren des doods. In examining these texts, the dissertation seeks for a male feminist practice that does not immediately turn into a male practice of appropriation and violence, I adopt a feminist practice of exposing gender representations in canonical male-authored texts, giving particular attention to the results of their representations for women. The question I ask of them is also a question I ask of my critical practice: is a genuine representation of female characters by male authors possible? The metaphors of feminism as a "no man's land" and American literature as a "territorial battle" connect issues central in Adams, James, Multatuli, and Van Eeden. The inclusion of the Dutch texts "within" American literature takes place not only on the basis of intertextual links with Harriet Beecher Stowe's Uncle Tom's Cabin, but also because their preoccupation with gender resembles gender systems in texts of Henry Adams and Henry James. All these male authors share an interest in the representation of women in their literary works. Henry Adams argues in The Education that there is "no refuge" for modern American women except "such as the male created for himself. " After analyzing the Dutch novels, James's The Wings of the Dove, and Adams's Esther, his South <b>Seas</b> <b>letters,</b> and The Education of Henry Adams, I locate these dubious moments of refuge for women within male representation in strategies of idealizations of female alterity, self-reflexivity, exposure of the cultural construction of gender, and silence. Whether these places of refuge for women within the borders of the male texts go beyond already staked out territories into "no man's land" is a question at the heart of the dissertation...|$|R

However, the group eventually chose to make the flag about human-animal equality, not about animals themselves.The colors white, green and blue were chosen to represent the natural habitats of animals: sky, land, and <b>sea.</b> The <b>letter</b> V is an inverted pyramid intended to symbolize the ability to do the impossible.|$|R

John Foxe gives a detailed account of his martyrdom, and of the letters he wrote before his death. His character seems by all accounts to have been very amiable. A letter from one Careless to him when in prison addresses him as a 'meek and loving lamb of Christ.' He went cheerfully to the stake at Smithfield at 9 a.m. on 27 January.

The Khazar alliance with the Byzantine empire began to collapse in the early 10th century. Byzantine and Khazar forces may have clashed in the Crimea, and by the 940s emperor Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus was speculating in De Administrando Imperio about ways in which the Khazars could be isolated and attacked. The Byzantines during the same period began to attempt alliances with the Pechenegs and the Rus', with varying degrees of success. Sviatoslav I finally succeeded in destroying Khazar imperial power in the 960s, in a circular sweep that overwhelmed the Khazar fortresses like Sarkel and Tamatarkha, and reached as far as the Caucasian Kassogians/Circassians and then back to Kiev. Sarkel fell in 965, with the capital city of Atil following, c. 968 or 969.|$|R

40|$|R. L. Stevenson’s Pacific travels {{shaped the}} last part of the author’s life both as a man and as a writer, {{changing}} his personal and authorial attitude. His first cruise from San Francisco to the Pacific on the yacht Casco was not only ‘the dream of a life realised’ (Letters 193), but also represented a business opportunity, since the literary agent S. S. McClure suggested that he write travel letters with the promise of an income able to defray the expenses of his journey and provide a good profit. Stevenson’s letters were later to become a volume of anthropological considerations on the culture of the Pacific, In the South Seas (1890). The neat difference between the letters and this volume, which however share the same content, relies on the author’s own idea that his cruise had posed several ‘questions of race and civilization’ (Letters 6 : 213), requiring a strong sociological focus hardly to be conveyed through letter-writing. The aim of this paper is to present Stevenson’s account of his Pacific experience as conveyed through both In the South <b>Seas</b> and his <b>letters,</b> in order to underline the author’s growing anthropological, historical and legal commitment, which was to have a crucial influence on his Pacific narrative fiction...|$|R
