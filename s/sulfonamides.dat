5|$|In her research, Fraser worked {{predominantly}} in infectious disease, studying general infection, puerperal fever, {{scarlet fever}} and septic sore throat among other bacterial infections. She began studies on scarlet fever {{in the early}} 1930s, and along with Dr. Helen Plummer isolated the precipitin present in the strains of streptococci {{likely to lead to}} disease. These findings were important in determining the types of antitoxins which might be employed for immunization to neutralize the disease. The type of research Fraser was engaged in required that the bacteria of the disease which created a toxin be isolated, so that it could be injected into a horse. Repeated injections of small doses of toxin allowed the horse to become immune to the disease. The serum created from the blood of animals which had been immunized, contained an antibody (known at the time as an antitoxin), which could then be injected into humans to cure the disease. Development of the <b>sulfonamides</b> rendered immunization against scarlet fever unnecessary, but she continued to study other aspects of the disease. In 1941, she typed the streptococci of scarlet fever which was an important breakthrough for tracking the epidemiology of the disease. Fraser also conducted research in an attempt to develop an antigen for tuberculosis. With the development of penicillin, her research after 1947, shifted focus to the study of antibiotics including bacitracin, penicillin, polymixin, and subtilin. Fraser studied various preparations of penicillin against the tubercular bacillus and as a treatment for gonorrhoea. Rising through the ranks of assistant professor and associate professor, Fraser became a full professor in 1949 teaching preventative medicine for the Bachelor of Science or nursing degree for the remainder of her career. In 1955 Fraser was appointed as a professor of microbiology and held that post until her retirement a decade later.|$|E

40|$|Binding {{parameters}} of the N-phenyl benzene sulfonyl hydrazide, <b>sulfonamide,</b> and nanosulfonamide interaction with human serum albumin were determined by calorimetry method. The obtained binding parameters indicated that <b>sulfonamide</b> in the second binding sites has higher affinity for binding than the first binding sites. The binding process of <b>sulfonamide</b> to HSA is both enthalpy and entropy driven. The associated equilibrium constants confirm that <b>sulfonamide</b> binds to HSA with high affinity (2. 2 × 106 and 3. 86105 [*]M− 1 for first and second sets of binding sites, resp.). The obtained results indicate that <b>sulfonamide</b> increases the HSA antioxidant property. Nanosulfonamide has much more affinity for HSA (3. 6 × 106 [*]M− 1) than <b>sulfonamide...</b>|$|R

25|$|Hypersensitivity {{reactions}} are less common in nonantibiotic <b>sulfonamides,</b> and, though controversial, {{the available evidence}} suggests those with hypersensitivity to sulfonamide antibiotics {{do not have an}} increased risk of hypersensitivity reaction to the nonantibiotic agents. A key component to the allergic response to sulfonamide antibiotics is the arylamine group at N4, found in sulfamethoxazole, sulfasalazine, sulfadiazine, and the anti-retrovirals amprenavir and fosamprenavir. Other sulfonamide drugs do not contain this arylamine group; available evidence suggests that patients who are allergic to arylamine <b>sulfonamides</b> do not cross-react to <b>sulfonamides</b> that lack the arylamine group, and may therefore safely take non-arylamine <b>sulfonamides.</b> It has therefore been argued that the terms 'sulfonamide allergy' or 'sulfa allergy' are misleading, and should be replaced by a reference to a specific drug (e.g. 'cotrimoxazole allergy').|$|E
25|$|In bacteria, {{antibacterial}} <b>sulfonamides</b> act {{as competitive}} inhibitors of the enzyme dihydropteroate synthase (DHPS), an enzyme involved in folate synthesis. <b>Sulfonamides</b> are therefore bacteriostatic and inhibit growth and multiplication of bacteria, {{but do not}} kill them.

40|$|The {{kinetics}} of the hydrolyses {{of secondary}} and tertiary N-amidomethylsulfonamides were studied at 50 C. Both types of N-amidomethylsulfonamide hydrolyse through acid- and base-catalysed processes, {{as indicated by}} the pH–rate profiles. The order of reactivity for the acid-catalysed pathway implies a mechanism involving protonation of the amide followed by expulsion of a neutral amide and formation of a sulfonyliminium ion. In the base-catalysed region, compound 5 c, which is substituted at both amide and <b>sulfonamide</b> nitrogen atoms, hydrolyses by nucleophilic attack of hydroxide ion at the amide carbonyl carbon atom to form benzoic acid and a <b>sulfonamide.</b> In contrast, compound 5 b, which contains a <b>sulfonamide</b> NH group, hydrolyses to benzamide and <b>sulfonamide</b> products by an E 1 cbrev mechanism involving ionisation of the <b>sulfonamide.</b> Compound 5 a, which contains an amide NH, also hydrolyses to <b>sulfonamide</b> and amide products, probably by an E 2 mechanism...|$|R
40|$|UnrestrictedWe {{identified}} 49 novel HIV- 1 IN inhibitors {{with a wide}} inhibitory profile. Furan and <b>sulfonamide</b> based inhibitors {{were tested}} in vitro against HIV- 1 IN. Their inhibitory profiles were investigated to identify structural properties responsible for IN inhibition. In the presence of cofactor Mn 2 +, 22 compounds containing a central furan ring yielded six analogues showing IC 50 < 10 µM. From 27 compounds containing a <b>sulfonamide</b> dithiazine moiety, eight analogues showed IC 50 < 10 µM. Furan-based compound inhibition depends on a carboxylic acid moiety bound to a central furan ring. Compounds containing a salicylic acid group were most potent. <b>Sulfonamide</b> analogues show greatest inhibition with two aromatic moieties consisting of a secondary <b>sulfonamide</b> dithiazine ring and an acetophenone.

40|$|Tertiary N-acyloxymethyl- and N-[(aminocarbonyloxy) methyl]sulfonamides were {{synthesised}} {{and evaluated}} as novel classes of potential prodrugs of agents containing a secondary <b>sulfonamide</b> group. The chemical and plasma hydrolyses {{of the title}} compounds were studied by HPLC, Tertiary N-acyloxymethylsulfonamides are slowly and quantitatively hydrolysed to the parent <b>sulfonamide</b> ill pH 7. 4 phosphate buffer, with half-lives ranging from 20 h, for 7 d, to 30 days, for 7 g. Quantitative formation of the parent <b>sulfonamide</b> also occurs in human plasma, the half-lives being within 0. 2 - 2. 0 min for some substrates. The rapid rate of hydrolysis can be ascribed to plasma cholinesterase, {{as indicated by the}} complete inhibition observed at. [eserine] = 0. 10 mM. These results suggest that tertiary N-acyloxymethylsulfonamides are potentially useful prodrugs for agents containing a secondary <b>sulfonamide</b> group, especially with pK(a) 8, combining a high stability in aqueous media with a high rate of plasma activation. In contrast, N-[(aminocarbonyloxy) methyl]sulfonamides 7 h-j do not liberate the parent <b>sulfonamide</b> either in aqueous buffers or in human plasma and thus appear to be unsuitable for development as <b>sulfonamide</b> prodrugs.
