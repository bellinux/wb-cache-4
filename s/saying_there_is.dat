5|$|The Roman {{military}} occupation {{of a significant}} part of what is now northern Scotland lasted only about 40 years; although their influence on the southern section of the country, occupied by Brythonic tribes such as the Votadini and Damnonii, would still have been considerable between the first and fifth centuries. The Welsh term Hen Ogledd ("Old North") is used by scholars to describe what is now the North of England and the South of Scotland during its habitation by Brittonic-speaking people around AD 500 to 800. According to writings from the 9th and 10th centuries, the Gaelic kingdom of Dál Riata was founded in the 6th century in western Scotland. The 'traditional' view is that settlers from Ireland founded the kingdom, bringing Gaelic language and culture with them. However, some archaeologists have argued against this view, <b>saying</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> no archaeological or placename evidence for a migration or a takeover by a small group of elites.|$|E

25|$|The British Broadcasting Company {{broadcast}} {{its first}} radio bulletin from radio station 2LO on 14 November 1922. Wishing to avoid competition, newspaper publishers persuaded {{the government to}} ban the BBC from broadcasting news before 7 PM, and to force it to use wire service copy instead of reporting on its own. On Easter weekend in 1930 (18 April), this reliance on newspaper wire services left the radio news service with no information to report after <b>saying</b> <b>There</b> <b>is</b> no news today. Piano music was played instead. The BBC gradually gained {{the right to edit}} the copy and, in 1934, created its own news operation. However, it could not broadcast news before 6 PM until World War II. Gaumont British and Movietone cinema newsreels had been broadcast on the TV service since 1936, with the BBC producing its own equivalent Television Newsreel programme from January 1948. A weekly Children's Newsreel was inaugurated on 23 April 1950, to around 350,000 receivers. The network began simulcasting its radio news on television in 1946, with a still picture of Big Ben. Televised bulletins began on 5 July 1954, broadcast from leased studios within Alexandra Palace in London.|$|E
25|$|In {{her version}} of events, she had fled civil war in Somalia, was forced into an {{arranged}} marriage with a man whom she had never met, and was not present at her own wedding. Upon escaping she was forced into hiding in the Netherlands, for her ex-husband and father's brothers would have been by Somali custom, required to perform an honor killing. The accounts of various witnesses varied greatly from hers. According to them, she left Somalia prior to any mass violence, and led a comfortable, upper-middle class life in neighboring Kenya, where she attended a Muslim Girls' school and received a full western-style education with focus on the Humanities and Science, her brother attended a Christian school, she lied to the Dutch immigration service about coming from Somalia {{in order not to}} be sent back to Kenya, and they allege she met her husband a few days before her wedding. After several meetings with him, they allege she agreed to the marriage, even though her mother said Ayaan should finish her education so she could afford to leave him if the marriage should have been unsuccessful. They also allege that Hirsi Ali was present at the wedding, something her brother later denied, and according to several witnesses appeared to be enjoying herself. Hirsi Ali denies all of this. On her way to Canada, she says she travelled to Holland by train during a stopover in Germany, and applied for political asylum. During her stay in Holland she regularly received letters from her father. The documentary also quoted several native Somalians as <b>saying</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> no tradition of honor killing in Somalia, something that is disputed.|$|E

500|$|The book did, however, receive {{consistent}} criticism. The {{most common}} complaint {{was on the}} speed of the plot – the School Library Journal summarises all the comments, saying that [...] "the events move a little slower than in previous installments..."

[...] Children's Literature also criticised the repetition of previous content, <b>saying</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> [...] "..entirely too much front matter [...] sags with the necessity of replaying earlier story lines." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite their organic appearance, Oliver's {{own view}} was that her work was not {{grounded}} in nature's structures. [...] Nevertheless, critics have identified the lifelike qualities of early pieces that resembled shells, claws or tails, or noted the apparent similarities to biological forms. McDonald commented that [...] "For Oliver to deny nature is akin to Balthus <b>saying</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> nothing erotic about his paintings or Rothko claiming his works aren't abstract." [...] Both major reviews of Oliver's work (Fenner's 1995 essay and Fink's 2002 journal article) draw attention to dualism and contradiction in the sculptures: Fenner describes them as [...] "delicate and ephemeral, [...] structurally robust and durable"; Fink sees them as [...] "ethereal but solid, fluid yet rigid, open but closed".|$|E

500|$|Besides {{crediting}} Trijata for acts {{attributed to}} others in the original epic, later literature adds new elements which grant Trijata a bigger role. In the Ramayana, just before meeting Hanuman, the thought of suicide crosses Sita's mind, but she never attempts it. In the Prasannaraghava, Trijata and Sita engage in a [...] "friendly conversation" [...] before Ravana comes to meet her. After Ravana's departure, Sita tells Trijata of her intent to commit suicide and urges Trijata to help her create a wood pyre. Trijata, however, refuses, <b>saying</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> not enough firewood. The Kakawin Ramayana also narrates that, when Sita sees the illusory severed heads of Rama and Lakshmana, she prepares a pyre. Trijata is ready to die with Sita, but first wants to inform her father Vibhishana. She returns with the news of Rama's well-being. Later on, after seeing Rama and Lakshmana bound by Indrajit's Nagapasha, Sita instructs Trijata to again create a pyre, but Trijata holds off until she can confirm the truth from her father, and returns with the news that Rama is alive.|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} plates {{of the war}} grouping, Goya's sympathies appear to lie with the Spanish defenders. These images {{typically}} show patriots facing hulking, anonymous invaders who treat them with fierce cruelty. As the series progresses, {{the distinction between the}} Spanish and the imperialists becomes ambiguous. In other plates, it is difficult to tell to which camp the distorted and disfigured corpses belong. Some of the titles deliberately question the intentions of both sides; for example, Con razon ó sin ella can mean with or without reason, rightly or wrongly, or for something or for nothing. Critic Philip Shaw notes that the ambiguity is still present in the final group of plates, <b>saying</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> no distinction between the [...] "heroic defenders of the Fatherland and the barbaric supporters of the old regime". There have been a variety of English translations offered for the plate titles. In many instances, the satirical and often sardonic ambiguity and play on Spanish proverbs found in Goya's carefully worded original titles is lost.|$|E

Chandler and Joey decide to break it open when they cannot find any other way of getting the birds out. Phoebe's reckless driving gets her and Ross to JFK Airport and, after buying a ticket to get past security, they search the information boards for Rachel's flight number. When they cannot locate her flight {{on any of the}} information boards, Ross calls and checks the number with Monica but discovers they are at the wrong airport; Ross and Phoebe drove to JFK, while Rachel was flying out of nearby Newark Airport. Phoebe phones Rachel, who has already boarded her flight, to stall her for time. When a passenger (Jim Rash) overhears Phoebe <b>saying</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a problem with the fictitious [...] "left phalange" [...] of the plane, he gets off the plane, prompting everyone else to leave. Chandler and Joey, who are emotionally attached to the foosball table, find they are unable to bear breaking it open, so Monica nonchalantly offers to do it for them. After they retrieve the birds, Chandler suggests Joey keeps them.|$|E

2500|$|Because {{the loss}} of {{swerving}} is so trivial compared to the crash that occurs if nobody swerves, the reasonable strategy {{would seem to be}} to swerve before a crash is likely. Yet, knowing this, if one believes one's opponent to be reasonable, one may well decide not to swerve at all, in the belief that he will be reasonable and decide to swerve, leaving the other player the winner. This unstable situation can be formalized by <b>saying</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> more than one Nash equilibrium, which is a pair of strategies for which neither player gains by changing his own strategy while the other stays the same. (In this case, the pure strategy equilibria are the two situations wherein one player swerves while the other does not.) ...|$|E

But later, caught between the company's guns {{and the local}} miners, the blacks and the Italians throw down their coal shovels and take up the union cause. C. E. Lively, an agent provocateur for the coal company who has infiltrated the union, tries to goad the miners towards violence, which Kenehan says will only weaken their cause.
