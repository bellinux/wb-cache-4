5|$|Banksia lemanniana {{has been}} shown to have a low to {{moderate}} <b>susceptibility</b> to dieback from the soil-borne water mould Phytophthora cinnamomi, unlike many Western Australian banksias. A study on cultivated plants in South Australia inoculated with P.cinnamomi and P.citricola found B.lemanniana to have an overall low <b>susceptibility</b> overall to both organisms, although 2-to-3-week-old seedlings appeared more vulnerable than 10-month-old ones.|$|E

40|$|The second-order <b>susceptibilities</b> in the ZnO {{films have}} been studied systemically. In very thin films, we observe an {{enhancement}} of second-order <b>susceptibilities,</b> which is larger than that of single-crystal ZnO. It was also observed that the second-order <b>susceptibilities</b> for ZnO films depend on the thickness {{but not on the}} film growth technique used (reactive sputtering or plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition). We suggest a mechanism to explain the reduction in the second-order <b>susceptibilities</b> of the thicker films. (C) 2002 American Institute of Physics...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} acid, oxgall, and H 2 O 2 on <b>susceptibilities</b> to {{antibiotics}} and nisin were examined for 13 strains of bifidobacteria. <b>Susceptibilities</b> to ampicillin, cloxacillin, penicillin, vancomycin, kanamycin, neomycin, paramomycin, streptomycin, chloramphenicol, erythromycin, tetracycline, and nisin A were assayed by a microdilution broth method. Acid-, oxgall- and H 2 O 2 -stressed variants were produced and assayed. Exposure to a pH of 2. 0 for 60 min reduced <b>susceptibilities</b> to cloxacillin and nisin A but increased <b>susceptibilities</b> to ampicillin, vancomycin, aminoglycosides, chloramphenicol, and erythromycin in a strain-dependent manner. Exposure to oxgall (0. 3 %) for 90 min increased <b>susceptibilities</b> to cell wall-directed antibiotics and aminoglycosides but increased resistances to tetracycline and nisin A. Oxidative stress increased the <b>susceptibilities</b> of 70 % of the strains to ampicillin and chloramphenicol, of 50 % of the strains to cloxacillin and tetracycline, and of 40 % of the strains to erythromycin {{but did not}} affect <b>susceptibilities</b> to vancomycin, kanamycin, and nisin A. This study shows that exposure of bifidobacteria to stressful conditions resembling those in the gastrointestinal tract may substantially modify their <b>susceptibilities</b> to antibiotics and may thus affect their probiotic capacities, especially when they are used {{for the management of}} intestinal infections and antibiotic-associated diarrhea...|$|R
40|$|The role of retarded intermolecular {{interactions}} (polariton effects) in the nonlinear optical <b>susceptibilities</b> of condensed phases is studied. A systematic {{method for}} calculating these <b>susceptibilities</b> is developed, {{based on the}} derivation of reduced equations of motion which couple the electronic variables to the Maxwell (internal) electric field E. The <b>susceptibilities</b> are obtained by iteratively solving these equations in powers of E. Thus, the common introduction of intermediate <b>susceptibilities</b> with respect to either the external or the local electric field is avoided. Our method allows for the incorporation of polariton dynamics into the equations of motion. A clear distinction between microscopic and macroscopic polariton effects is made. Explicit forms for the linear (χ(1)) and second order (χ(2)) <b>susceptibilities</b> in molecular crystals are derived, which microscopically account for polariton–phonon scattering. Our theory provides an explanation for a recent series of linear and nonlinear optical experiments in naphtalene crystals which were found to contradict existing theories of nonlinear <b>susceptibilities.</b> ...|$|R
5|$|Because of its higher <b>susceptibility</b> {{and lower}} {{reliance}} on fire for reproduction, the optimal fire interval for B.prionotes {{is higher than}} for other Banksia species with which it occurs. One simulation suggested an interval of 18 years was optimal for B.prionotes, compared to 15 years for B.hookeriana and 11 years for B.attenuata. The same model suggested that B.prionotes is quite susceptible to reductions in fire intervals. On the other hand, it shows little <b>susceptibility</b> to increases in fire interval: although senescence and death are often observed in plants older than about 30 years, healthy stands have been observed that have escaped fire for 50 years. These stands have a multi-aged structure, demonstrating the occurrence of successful inter-fire recruitment.|$|E

40|$|The {{magnetic}} <b>susceptibilities</b> of Mg-Cd alloys {{at several}} temperatures are measured by Gouy's method in a vacuum. The alloys between pure Cd and 60 % Mg are diamagnetic and those between 60 % Mg and pure Mg are paramagnetic. In the disordered states the magnetic <b>susceptibilities</b> of the alloys {{are independent of}} temperature and in a linear relation with the compositions. In the ordered states the diamagnetic alloys increase their <b>susceptibilities</b> and the paramagnetic ones also increase their <b>susceptibilities.</b> In the appendix the difference of the Brillouin zone of the close-packed hexagonal structure between the ordered state and the disordered one is discussed...|$|R

In addition, many of the strongly magnetic minerals discussed below are paramagnetic above a critical temperature (the Curie temperature or Néel temperature). In Table 2 are given <b>susceptibilities</b> for some iron-bearing minerals. The <b>susceptibilities</b> are positive and {{an order of magnitude}} or more larger than diamagnetic <b>susceptibilities.</b>|$|R
5|$|Genetic {{predisposition}} for DPB <b>susceptibility</b> {{has been}} localized to two HLA haplotypes (a nucleotide or gene sequence difference between paired chromosomes, {{that is more}} likely to occur among a common ethnicity or trait) common to people of East Asian descent. HLA-B54 is associated with DPB in the Japanese, while HLA-A11 is associated with the disease in Koreans. Several genes within this region of class I HLA are believed to be responsible for DPB, by allowing increased <b>susceptibility</b> to the disease. The common genetic background and similarities in the HLA profile of affected Japanese and Korean individuals were considered in the search for a DPB gene. It was suggested that a mutation of a suspected disease-susceptibility gene located somewhere between HLA-B and HLA-A had occurred on an ancestral chromosome carrying both HLA-B54 and HLA-A11. Further, it is possible that a number of genetic recombination events around the disease locus (location on a chromosome) could have resulted in the disease being associated with HLA-B54 in the Japanese and HLA-A11 in Koreans. After further study, it was concluded that a DPB <b>susceptibility</b> gene is located near the HLA-B locus at chromosome 6p21.3. Within this area, the search for a genetic cause of the disease has continued.|$|E

5|$|In 1922 Rabi {{returned}} to Cornell {{as a graduate}} chemistry student, and began studying physics. In 1923 he met, and began courting, Helen Newmark, a summer-semester student at Hunter College. In order to be near her when she returned home, Rabi continued his studies at Columbia University, where his supervisor was Albert Wills. In June 1924 Rabi landed {{a job as a}} part-time tutor at the City College of New York. Wills, whose specialty was magnetism, suggested that Rabi write his doctoral thesis on the magnetic <b>susceptibility</b> of sodium vapor. The topic did not appeal to Rabi, but after William Lawrence Bragg gave a seminar at Columbia about the electric <b>susceptibility</b> of certain crystals called Tutton's salts, Rabi decided to research their magnetic <b>susceptibility,</b> and Wills agreed to be his supervisor.|$|E
40|$|The QCD vacuum condensates {{and various}} vacuum <b>susceptibilities</b> are all {{important}} parameters which characterize the nonperturbative {{properties of the}} QCD vacuum. In the QCD sum rules external field formula, various QCD vacuum <b>susceptibilities</b> play important roles in determining the properties of hadrons. In this paper, we review the recent progress in studies of vacuum <b>susceptibilities</b> together with their applications to the chiral phase transition of QCD.

40|$|We {{study the}} conserved charge fluctuations, as {{quantified}} by the corresponding <b>susceptibilities,</b> in strongly interacting matter as motived by the quark-gluon plasma. Using the gauge-gravity correspondence approach, we study {{the patterns of}} conserved charge fluctuations in two types of holographic models for QCD, the D 4 /D 8 and the D 3 /D 7 models. We compute and compare the quark number <b>susceptibilities</b> in both models and find an interesting common feature of the two: at very strong coupling higher order <b>susceptibilities</b> are suppressed and the conserved charge fluctuations become purely Guassian. In light of the state-of-the-art lattice QCD results we also discuss what {{we can learn from}} these <b>susceptibilities</b> about the underlying degrees of freedom in the 1 ∼ 2 T_c quark-gluon plasma and examine the viability of different ideas such as holography, quasi-particles, as well as bound states. From analyzes of second order <b>susceptibilities</b> we conclude that the bound states exist and are important in the 1 ∼ 2 T_c region. We further construct and make predictions for several ratios of fourth-order <b>susceptibilities</b> that can sensitively reveal such bound states.

40|$|We studied QCD {{with two}} flavors of {{dynamical}} staggered quarks at finite temperature, with a bare sea quark mass of about 17 MeV. We report investigations of baryon, isospin, charge and strangeness <b>susceptibilities,</b> {{as well as}} screening masses obtained from correlators of local and one-link separated meson operators. These were studied as functions of valence quark mass at several temperatures. Our results for <b>susceptibilities</b> deviate significantly from ideal gas values, and even more from the weak coupling series. We also report the first measurement of off-diagonal quark number <b>susceptibilities</b> below the transition temperature, Tc, where they are the main contribution to charge fluctuations.

5|$|The {{variation}} of plant <b>susceptibility</b> to pests was probably known {{even in the}} early stages of agriculture in humans. In historic times, the observation of such variations in <b>susceptibility</b> have provided solutions for major socio-economic problems. The grape phylloxera was introduced from North America to France in 1860 and in 25 years it destroyed nearly a third (100,000km²) of the French grape yards. Charles Valentine Riley noted that the American species Vitis labrusca was resistant to Phylloxera. Riley, with J. E.
