A prospective study was therefore conducted to investigate the DSM-IV definition and to provide an empirical operationalization of premature ejaculation. In this study 140 men suffering from lifelong premature ejaculation were interviewed separately from their partners. Various means of assessing the intravaginal ejaculation latency time (IELT) were compared: assessment by <b>spontaneous</b> <b>answer,</b> by questionnaire, by imagining foreplay and intercourse and estimating the ejaculation time without a clock or with a clock, and by stop-watch measurement at home over a one-month period. The number of thrusts and feelings of control during foreplay and intercourse were also assessed. A total of 110 men used the stop-watch method. Ninety {{percent of all the}} subjects ejaculated within one minute of intromission, with 80 % actually ejaculating within 30 seconds. The age of the men and duration of their relationship were not correlated with IELT; however, the IELT tended to be longer for couples who had a higher frequency of intercourse. There was only a moderate correlation between the various methods of assessing IELT. The results suggest that premature ejaculation could be operationally defined as an IELT < 1 min in more than 90 % of episodes of sexual intercourse, independent of age and duration of relationshi...|$|R

40|$|Nowadays {{cultural}} landscape {{is under a}} transformation process. In cities with an exponential growing urbanization a new one is being created. People are arriving to the urbanized areas from different backgrounds bringing their own roots to an “anonymous” city. Understanding different cultures is becoming crucial in planning to understand {{which will be the}} future of those areas. Syncretistic cultures that merge from the movement of masses are new and mixed. The Home is a concept that is strictly connected to the culture of living, connecting to the neighbourhood and the basic 'building block' of the living city. Informal settlements are the <b>spontaneous</b> <b>answer</b> to the spatial need of home. Slums are often a constitutive part of the city landscape. Informal settlements stretch for kilometres {{on the outskirts of the}} city but they also jostle in the nooks of the historical city centres. They need to be studied as consistent reality of the urban fabric, identifying, case by case, both their material development –in architectural terms- and their cultural heritage - often alien from the context - as settlers frequently come from other regions or countries. The phenomenon of informality, seen as a cultural answer to the need of a house, in an exponential growing economy and city, has always been present and was widely studied it in the history of architecture and of the urban fabric.

40|$|The problem {{investigated}} {{is that of}} {{the relationship}} between success in foreign language learning by junior children and the organisation of their learning groups, in particular, the use of undifferentiated (mixed- ability) classes. Four distinctive methods are used:- (i) historical survey of the background to foreign language teaching; (ii) appraisal of rationale; (iii) dissection of teachers views about mixed-ability foreign language learning using a questionnaire; (iv) experimental evaluation of learning success with specially designed oral attainment tests. An extensive survey employs three contrasted regional studies viz. England, Germany and Sweden. In all three countries the overall approach is now more comprehensive and flexible and non-selective. Mainly oral methods rely on cooperative children and informal, adaptable teachers; carefully graded structural components of language are learnt "naturally" in situations. There is increasing Interest in teaching foreign languages to younger children of all abilities. Certain aspects of this approach seem weakly developed. There is scant agreement about aims end the criteria of success. Many principles lack foundation; {{it is not clear how}} far they secure consolidation and continuity in learning. Little attention is paid to the feasibility of suiting a generalised approach to the specific characteristics of various learning groups. Dissection of teachers' views reveals some group differences over basic issues and much dissatisfaction. Attainment testing of streamed and unstreamed children in four schools indicates higher scores (a) for streamed children, (b) for girls. Superior performances are most marked in <b>spontaneous</b> question <b>answering.</b> Yet, absolute differences are small and overlap is marked. To use these results as a basis for selective teaching seems inadvisable. The operation of specific and peculiar factors within the mixed-ability class deserves urgent and careful scrutiny. We need to appraise teacher attitudes, to analyse the components of childrens' success, and to explore further the possibilities of using differentiated and individualised instruction techniques...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: According to {{contemporary}} knowledge about pain, every painful stimulus is generated, transmitted and interpreted {{in the same}} way for newborns and adults. Newborns have all the anatomical, functional and neurochemical elements necessary to nociception. Nevertheless, the manifestation and communication of pain in newborns are different from adult people, demanding other physiological and behavioral indicators to assess it. Objective: To identify, among nurses and physicians, their knowledge, beliefs and practices regarding assessment, non-pharmacological treatment and other measures to relieve-treat pain in newborns. Methods: Descriptive and exploratory stud of 16 doctors and 27 nurses (86, 0 % of staff) who work in a neonatal intensive care unit belong to a university hospital in São Paulo, Brasil. The date were collected through a questionnaire with open and closed questions, and underwent Kappa, Chi-Square and Fischer tests, in order to verify associations and agreements among the answers. Results and conclusions: The interviewed professionals believe that newborns actually feel pain. They recognize its importance and refer performing frequent evaluations of pain status, although demonstrating poor practice identify newborn pain from physiological or behavioral treatment of pain: the professionals know some important measures, but do not make use of then in theirs practices. There was no significant association between <b>spontaneous</b> and directive <b>answers,</b> regarding physiological and behavioral signs of pain...|$|R
30|$|The {{procedure}} {{for the data}} collection included interviewing each of the Haitian HST volunteers {{participating in the study}} at a location convenient to them in Port-au-Prince and environs. Interviews were conducted by a research team member from the United States and took place in October 2011, {{as part of a larger}} research project on the effectiveness of the HST program in general. A translator was used with each participant. The interview process began with the researcher explaining the informed consent and ensuring the full understanding of the participant. Creswell et al. (2007) recommended that narrative interviews utilize several open-ended, broad, topic-specific questions, limiting the use of structure during the interview. Therefore, the interviews were organized and conducted with non-directive, chronologically oriented questions pertaining to the HST and life pre- and post-earthquake. Open-ended questions included, “What was your life like before the earthquake?” and “How were you affected by your experience working as an HST volunteer?” An important component of the narrative inquiry process is asking questions that allow the participant to guide his or her responses in a way that is meaningful to him or her (Reissman 1993). Participants’ <b>spontaneous</b> <b>answers</b> to the scripted questions were followed by clarifying questions and reflections to draw out greater depth in response. The four interviews were between 40 and 60  min in duration for each participant.|$|E
40|$|Our first {{objective}} was to detect misconceptions about the microscopic nature of sound among senior university students enrolled in different engineering programmes (from chemistry to telecommunications). We sought to determine how these misconceptions are expressed (qualitative aspect) and, only very secondarily, to gain a general idea {{of the extent to}} which they are held (quantitative aspect). Our second {{objective was}} to explore other misconceptions about wave aspects of sound. We have also considered the degree of consistency in the model of sound used by each student. Forty students answered a questionnaire including open-ended questions. Based on their free, <b>spontaneous</b> <b>answers,</b> the main results were as follows: a large majority of students answered most of the questions regarding the microscopic model of sound according to the scientifically accepted model; however, only a small number answered consistently. The main model misconception found was the notion that sound is propagated through the travelling of air particles, even in solids. Misconceptions and mental-model inconsistencies tended to depend on the engineering programme in which the student was enrolled. However, students in general were inconsistent also in applying their model of sound to individual sound properties. The main conclusion is that our students have not truly internalised the scientifically accepted model that they have allegedly learnt. This implies a need to design learning activities that take these findings into account in order to be truly efficient. Postprint (published version...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: The cross {{cultural}} differences in perception of menopausal symptoms {{are well known}} and these differences in perception of hypoglycemic symptoms in Russian-speaking and Caucasian postmenopausal women have been reported. Aims and objectives: This study assessed cross - linguistic and cross - {{cultural differences}} in symptomatology of self reported hypoglycemia, between Punjabi and Hindi speaking diabetic post menopausal women. Material and Methods: Thirty Punjabi speaking and 20 Hindi speaking diabetic postmenopausal women aged over 50 years, were recruited for this study. Each subject was asked, {{what happens to you}} when you have low sugar? in the language of her choice, and <b>spontaneous</b> <b>answers</b> were recorded verbatim. Statistical analysis: The data so obtained was analyzed by paper and pen method to obtain an understanding of the frequency of self reporting of various symptoms and then analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Science ver. 19. 0. Results: Symptoms of hollowness, cold sweats and headache correlated significantly (P < 0. 0001, P = 0. 0001 and P = 0. 03 respectively). One difference was noted in women from rural vs. urban background: Inability to concentrate was more frequent in urban women (4 / 23) vs rural women (0 / 27) (P < 0. 0001). Discussion: To our knowledge, this is the first exploratory work highlighting the differences in self reported hypoglycemia symptomatology, based on linguistic background. In India and other countries with multi ethnic, multi linguistic societies, linguistic competence in hypoglycemia history taking is important. Limitations: Incidence of hypoglycemia in the subjects enrolled was not assessed. Many of the subjects in the Punjabi speaking cohort were bilingual. Some symptoms of hypoglycemia may have been missed or over-reported by participants. Conclusion: Diabetes care professionals should be aware that persons with diabetes from varying linguistic backgrounds may report symptoms of hypoglycemia differently...|$|E
40|$|Master of ArtsDepartment of Modern LanguagesEarl K. BrownThis paper {{reports on}} a study that {{analyzes}} how a sequential bilingual speaker (L 1 Mexican Spanish, L 2 American English) uses stylistic phonetic variation in different speech types during an interview (short <b>answer,</b> <b>spontaneous</b> speech, dramatic anecdote, reading) to construct a dynamic gay persona. There are many stylistic variables that can interact when an individual is creating a persona in an interaction, and this becomes even more complex when analyzing L 1 speech as well as L 2 speech as there are two collections of stylistic phonetic variables (indexical fields) interacting from two different cultural ideologies available to the interlocutors. It is problematic to assign one distinct variable to an identity, such as gay, as it homogenizes a diverse social group of individuals and underestimates members' ability to manage perceptual salience of their identity as a gay individual based on context and social pressure(s). While the field of Lavender Linguistics (language use associated with the LGBTQ community) has shown {{that there are many}} resources {{that can be used to}} "sound gay," this case study focuses on how a speaker stylistically creates a gay persona throughout the interview through stylistic variation of two principle variables: 1) word-final /s/ duration, and 2) center of gravity of word-final /s/...|$|R

Though the teachers' social attention was always given immediately for all spontaneous speech, if the child's spontaneous verbalizations were requests for materials, those materials were withheld until she had responded to the teachers' questions about those materials. When she was silent, the teachers withheld their attention and the materials. A high frequency of verbal behavior was quickly established. When both teacher attention and materials were provided only when the child was not verbalizing, the child's frequency of talking immediately decreased. When social attention and materials were again made contingent upon <b>spontaneous</b> speech and <b>answering</b> questions, the child's frequency of talking quickly increased to its previous high level. The content of the child's verbal behavior which increased was primarily a repetition of requests to the teachers with little change noted in the non-request verbalizations, or verbalizations to other children. A further experimental analysis demonstrated that social interaction per se was not the reinforcer which maintained the increased verbalization; rather, for this child, the material reinforcers which accompanied the social interaction {{appeared to be the}} effective components of teacher attention...|$|R

The motherchild interactions were recorded in a free play situation, and the data registrations and analysis were carried out using the CHILDES (Child Language Data Exchange System) computer program. Through the comparison using proportions test, it was verified that there were variations on mother’s conversation directed to these two groups of children. The analysis of the mother’s semantic contingency pointed that the used continuity expressions with children that presented typical language development.

This study aims {{to compare the}} food attitudes (i. e., hedonic- and nutrition-based) of children using both an implicit pairing task and an explicit forced-choice categorization task suitable for the cognitive abilities of 5 - to 11 -year-olds. A dominance of hedonically driven attitudes was expected for all ages in the pairing task, designed to elicit affective and <b>spontaneous</b> <b>answers,</b> whereas a progressive emergence of nutrition-based attitudes was expected in the categorization task, designed to involve deliberate analyses of the costs/benefits of foods. An additional exploratory goal was to evaluate differences in the attitudes of normal and overweight children in both tasks. Children from 3 school levels (n= 184; mean age = 8. 03 years) were individually tested on computers in their schools. They performed a pairing task in which the tendencies to associate foods with nutritional vs. culinary contexts were assessed. Next, {{they were asked to}} categorize each food into one of the following four categories: “yummy”,”yucky” (i. e., hedonic categories), “makes you strong”, or”makes you fat” (i. e., nutritional categories). The hedonic/culinary pairs were very frequently selected (81 % on average), and this frequency significantly increased through school levels. In contrast, in the categorization task, a significant increase in nutrition-driven categorizations with school level was observed. Additional analyses revealed no differences in the food attitudes between the normal and overweight children in the pairing task, and a tendency towards lower hedonic categorizations among the overweight children. Culinary associations can reflect cultural learning in the French context where food pleasure is dominant. In contrast, the progressive emergence of cognitively driven attitudes with age may reflect the cognitive development of children who are more reasonable and influenced by social norms...|$|E
40|$|In {{previous}} papers {{we presented}} our research that analyzed the role individual social capital might play in economic development. Our data on three different frontier markets illustrates the current challenges {{both in terms}} of data collection process as well as analyzing the collected data. Researchers of social capital access have to deal with multiple sources of spherical aberration in the data collection process. It is not only the aforementioned difficulties of measuring social capital alone that influence data collection process, data, und results. The changing cultural environment in cross-cultural studies bears on the analysis as well as the instruments of any research. Cultural differences in the definition not only of the ties, but also of the items themselves as the terms used can encounter alienation from the original through translations and through use in the specific cultural setting (Van der Gaag & Snijders 2004 : 33). Finally, the artificiality of the interview situation itself can cause aberrations the real representation of the data. The interview situation is extracted from everyday life and misses real-life incentives, but expects <b>spontaneous</b> <b>answers</b> to thought-provoking questions that are unlikely to have been previously considered by the respondents. All these phenomena are thought to lead to an underestimation of available social resources (Van der Gaag & Snijders 2004 : 27, Lin 2001 : 43). In addition to external factors that appear to be normal to the interviewee, but not necessarily to the researcher involved, a range of behavioral and psychological patterns influence the respondents ’ answers-possibly universally. More or less conscious forms of selective perception lead to over- and underestimation of available social capital. Studies on the phenomenon of social desirability in its different aspects have shown that the interviewee more or less consciously follows an agenda of self-presentation: the 2 | P a g...|$|E

The mediated kind of communication {{used by the}} informants, their common social activities and their self-perceived identity were the aspects explored {{in order to establish}} the stage of integration into the majority. The study is based on the four stages minority group identity development theory: unexamined identity, conformity, resistance and separatism, integration. In this paper second generation immigrants are referred to as the minority. The hypothesis formulated {{at the beginning of this}} study was that second generation immigrants resist the majority by forming their own group with own culture, different from the native Swedish one. The research was conducted through ten structured interviews, some of them enriched with additional information provided by <b>answering</b> <b>spontaneous</b> auxiliary questions, according to each informant’s case. The study revealed integration of the target group into the majority and the typical means of communication mentioned by the informants outlined a type of youth culture rather than a non-Swedish culture. Therefore in this case communication reinforces identity and facilitates integration, contrary to the formulated hypothesis. Second generation immigrants have a clear image of their mixed identity, of their minority group and of the majority group, typical for the integration stage. The study concludes that the aspects of communication studied affect positively the development of identity for second generation immigrants and help their integration into the majority...|$|R

CEEB has been conducted on behalf of the European Commission in the Central and Eastern European countries each year in autumn since 1990. Below is a very small selection of Mr. Kucia's research findings. Throughout the 90 s people in the four countries increasingly saw their countries' future tied up with the EU, since economic and political connections to the EU were growing and prospects for EU membership were increasing. Regional co-operation within CE did not gain much popular recognition. However, initially high levels of enthusiasm for the EU were gradually superseded by a more realistic approach or even scepticism. Poland was the exception in this respect; its population was more positive about the EU in 1996 than ever before. Mr. Kucia concludes that, since the political "elites" in CE are more positive about the EU than the people they serve, they should do their best to bring people round to their beliefs, lest the project of European integration become purely the business of the elites, as Mr. Kucia claims it has been in the EU up till now. He accuses the governments of the region, the EU authorities and the media of failing to provide appropriate information, especially about the two subjects which most affect them, association with the EU and the PHARE assistance programme. Respondents were asked to rank in order the countries or regions they saw their country's future most closely tied up with. In the period 92 - 96 the EU received the highest ratings in all of CE. The ratings were highest in CZ in 92 and 93 (46 %) and in Poland in 96 (46 %). They were the lowest in Hungary (22 % in 94). After the EU came "Other Western European countries (non EU) ", that is Austria, Sweden and Finland (before they joined the EU in 1995), Switzerland and Norway. Mr. Kucia puts the high ratings of these countries down to historical connections and geographical proximity, particularly in the case of Austria. The USA always came second in Poland, and in Hungary too its standing has always been higher than in CZ or SK. Indeed Mr. Kucia suggests that the USA's standing is disproportionately low in especially the CZ. Germany was nominated frequently by Hungarians, though in the CZ and SK, figures have been consistently low (1 - 2 %). "Other CE/EE countries" increased their ratings in all of CE except Poland between 92 and 96. With regard to these last figures, Mr. Kucia makes an interesting note. Assuming that for the respondents in the four countries this category covered the Visegrad 4, least support was found in Poland, whose government was the most in favour of close political co-operation within the V 4, while most support was in evidence in CZ and SK, for whose governments V 4 was simply not a priority. Again, there is evidence of a divide between the political elites and the people. Russia has occupied a consistently modest rank. It was the highest in PL, fairly low in H and SK and the lowest in CZ. The Slovak government's policy of closer ties with Russia is reflected in a growth in the figures from 2 % in 93 to 6 % in 95. Every year the <b>spontaneous</b> <b>answer</b> "we should depend on ourselves" appeared, which Mr. Kucia interprets as either a sign of isolationism and disillusionment or as a call for self-reliance. Unfortunately he regards both these tendencies as unfeasible in the uniting Europe. Moving to more general conclusions, Mr. Kucia finds that the concept "Central Europe" does not have much meaning for Central Europeans. He believes that this is probably due to the failure to establish a viable regional co-operation network. Group discussions also revealed that people thought themselves European as a consequence of being Czech or Polish etc. Thus European identity is based on national identities. Generally within the surveyed period, the numbers of those who said they often think themselves European decreased, while the numbers of those who said they never think themselves European increased from 41 % in PL, 36 % in CZ, and 30 % in H in 1990, to 67 % in CZ, 58 % in PL, and 51 % in H in 1995...|$|R
40|$|Objective The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to analyze the level of knowledge on tumours and their prevention among rural inhabitants. Material and Methods The research involved 500 residents of villages in Podkarpackie Province in south-east Poland. The age of the researched ranges from 18 – 30 years; mean age – 26. 96 ± 0. 84 (range [18, 30], median 25. 95 %CI [18, 9, 29, 01]). The researched group was represented in 47. 59 % by women in 52. 41 % by men. In order to obtain the research material, a standardized questionnaire was applied which included questions focused mainly on assessment of the level of knowledge on tumours (causes, symptoms, ways of treatment, prevention), as well as questions with both <b>spontaneous</b> and prompted <b>answers.</b> Results 34. 72 % of respondents confirmed the occurrence of tumours in their family; the most frequently occurring was a lung tumour (9. 4 %). While assessing the degree of relationship it was proved that among parents’ of the respondents, neoplastic disease had occurred in 3. 22 % of cases, and in 22. 36 % of cases it affected grandparents. In self-assessment, a low level of knowledge was indicated by 35. 35 % of respondents: average by 30. 45 %, hard to determine by 32 %, while 2. 18 % stated that their level of knowledge was high. The most frequently enumerated risk factors were: smoking (36. 61 %), improper diet (15. 03 %), and improper lifestyle (9. 83 %). UV radiation was a risk factor for 16. 18 %; however, a solarium only for 1. 93 % of respondents. For 37. 94 %, a medical examination was a diagnostic method in neoplastic disease. Conclusions According to self-assessment, every third respondent stated having a low or average level of knowledge. The most frequently used source of knowledge was the Internet, and much more rarely a doctor or a nurse. Very few of the respondents could enumerate the tests applied in the early detection of neoplastic diseases...|$|R
