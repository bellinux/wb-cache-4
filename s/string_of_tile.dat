By {{keeping track of the}} strands as they weave back and forth through the assembly, we show that surprisingly sophisticated calculations can be performed using linear self-assembly. Examples range from generating an addition table to providing O(1) solutions to CNF-SAT and DHPP. We classify the families of languages that can be generated by various types of DNA molecules, and establish a correspondence to the existing classes ET 0 L_(ml) and ET 0 L_(fin). Thus, linear self-assembly <b>of</b> <b>string</b> <b>tiles</b> can generate the output languages of finite-visit Turing Machines...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Approaches to DNA-based {{computing}} by self-assembly {{require the}} use of DNA nanostructures, called tiles, that have e cient chemistries, expressive computational power, and convenient input and output (I/O) mechanisms. We have designed two new classes <b>of</b> DNA <b>tiles,</b> TAO and TAE, both of which contain three double-helices linked by strand exchange. Structural analysis of a TAO molecule has shown that the molecule assembles e ciently from its four component strands. Here we demonstrate a novel method for I/O whereby multiple tiles assemble around a single-stranded (input) sca old strand. Computation by tiling theoretically results in the formation of structures that contain single-stranded (output) reported strands, which can then be isolated for subsequent steps of computation if necessary. We illustrate the advantages of TAO and TAE designs by detailing two examples of massively parallel arithmetic: construction of complete XOR and addition tables by linear assemblies <b>of</b> DNA <b>tiles.</b> The three helix structures provide exibility for topological routing of strands in the computation, allowing the implementation <b>of</b> <b>string</b> <b>tile</b> models. 1...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{first and}} third authors and others [2, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12] have studied sets of “tiles” (a {{generalization}} of pixels or voxels) in two and three dimensions that have a property called strong normality (SN) : For any tile P, only finitely many tiles intersect P, and any nonempty intersection <b>of</b> these <b>tiles</b> must also intersect P. This paper presents extensions of the basic results about SN sets <b>of</b> <b>tiles</b> to n dimensions. One of our results is that if SN holds for every n + 1 or fewer tiles in a locally finite set <b>of</b> <b>tiles</b> in Rn, then the entire set <b>of</b> <b>tiles</b> is SN. Other results are that SN is equivalent to hereditary local contractibility, that simpleness <b>of</b> a <b>tile</b> in an SN set <b>of</b> <b>tiles</b> is equivalent to contractibility of its shared subset, and that deletion <b>of</b> a simple <b>tile</b> in an SN set <b>of</b> <b>tiles</b> preserves the homotopy type of the union <b>of</b> all the <b>tiles...</b>|$|R
