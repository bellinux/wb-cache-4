40|$|Excessive {{behaviour}} {{of vehicles}} {{is often the}} subject of study, motivated by either the development of active safety systems uch as ESP, or the improvement of vehicle performance such as for racecars. In all of these cases, combined slip {{needs to be taken}} into account. In many cases however, the full set of tyre characteristics is not available. Consequently, one needs to work with inaccurate combined slip properties based on estimated slip <b>stifnesses</b> and friction levels. It would be a great advantage if combined slip characteristics could be estimated accurately, especially for truck tyres and racecar tyres, where facilities are rare and testing is very expensive. For passenger cars and light van tyres, about 60 % of the testing effort is spent in combined slip. This means time and costs which could be saved by this accurate estimation. Moreover, apart from this reduction of the testing effort, the estimation could be a tool for assessment in testing tyres in combined slip leading to better quality tests results. Anyhow, it will permit to derive combined slip characteristics when no test-data are available. First, some fundamental aspects in tyre modelling are given with the MF-Tyre Model (Magic Formula) treated in detail. Combined slip as described by the MF-Tyre model is discussed with the characteristics derived and compared with different passenger car tyres. In parallel, combined slip is also studied from a more fundamental scope using the physical Brush Model, with special focus on the ratio between tyre forces under pure slip and combined slip conditions (the weighting functions). Various methods to derive these weighting functions based on pure slip characteristics without testing are treated. Among these, two methods lead to satisfactory results, the Slip Circle Sinusoidal Method (SCS) presented by Pottinger and especially the Practical Slip Similarity Method (PSS), derived and developed by the authors. Among others, these methods will be compared with the Magic Formula fits and the experimental results with observed deviations for the PSS-method in shear force with measurement results bounded by 5 % for large tyre load and less than 8 % for low tyre load. A comparision of the SCS-method and PSS-method with the MF-fits for large slip suggests improvements of the Magic Formula tyre model, Between the various estimations for the prediction of the combined slip based on pure slip characteristics, the Slip Circle Method and the Practical Slip Similarity Method, derived and developed by the authors will lead to a satisfactory prediction with respect to measurement data. In addition, estimated combined slip outside of the measurement range is discussed...|$|R

40|$|Sustainable {{development}} is gaining popularity {{around the globe}} nowadays. Governments are under pressure, on many fronts, to embed sustainable development in policies, practice, and operations to secure the planet's future. Adding to this, increased populations, {{and the need for}} more infrastructures, have unfortunately led to the unacceptable depletion of raw materials, increasing amounts of construction and demolition waste (C&DW) and accelerated deterioration of the natural environment in many places worldwide. For the conservation of natural resources, reuse and recycling of C&DW is the most obvious way to achieve sustainability in the construction sector. Currently, recycled aggregate (RA) is produced from C&DW in modern recycling facilities, under good quality control provisions which could lead to improve its performance compared with the earlier days of recycling. In addition to C&DW, large amounts of industrial and mining by-products such as fly ash, slag, limestone powders, aggregate dust, etc. are dumped in landfills. Fly ash has been used successfully in concrete for a long time due to its numerous advantages across a wide range of properties, including aspects of durability. A concrete produced with the combination of PFA and RA i. e. recycled aggregate concrete (RAC) is obviously more sustainable and economical than conventional natural aggregate concrete (NAC). To date, statistics show that a considerable proportion of the world's RA is used for low-utility applications due to perceived risks and uncertainty over their performance formed as a result of previous history of use when RA was produced manually and low strength cement and higher water to cement ratios were used. Despite the advances in recycling, materials and concreting technologies, this impression prevails. However, to increase the use of RA, it is believed that the quality of RAC should be improved by chemical and mineral additives. For cost effectiveness, quality-improving additives should be abundant, safe, and inexpensive; PFA and new generation polymer-based superplasticizer (SP) are deemed to be a good option. The aims of this study are to investigate the possibility of producing good quality RAC that {{could be used as a}} substitute for NAC in normal strength concrete members, and to study its fundamental properties. An attempt has been made to create superplasticized RAC concretes, in which new generation polymer-based SP and PFA produced to the latest European standards were used. PFA was used to partially replace fine aggregate and cement in ordinary and self-compacting concretes. The thesis also includes an investigation into the potential of utilising an aggregate by-product (red granite dust (RGD) in producing environmentally beneficial RAC. The findings show that good performance RAC can be produced with the help of SP and PFA. The study also revealed that it is possible to utilise RGD to substitute up to 30 % of cement without substantially influencing the performance of concrete, while also providing cost savings. Strengths and <b>stifnesses</b> of the ensuing RAC either with SP, PFA, or RGD were comparable, or better than, a wide range of counterpart NACs. The author's produced RAC concretes can replace NAC concrete used unnecessarily for many applications including structural concrete. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

40|$|In {{the past}} decade, a {{combination}} of unfitted finite elements (or XFEM) with the Nitsche method has become a popular discretization method for elliptic interface problems. This development started with the introduction and analysis of this Nitsche-XFEM technique in the paper [A. Hansbo, P. Hansbo, Comput. Methods Appl. Mech. Engrg. 191 (2002) ]. In general, the resulting linear systems have very large condition numbers, which depend {{not only on the}} mesh size $h$, but also on how the interface intersects the mesh. This paper is concerned with the design and analysis of optimal preconditioners for such linear systems. We propose an additive subspace preconditioner which is optimal {{in the sense that the}} resulting condition number is independent of the mesh size $h$ and the interface position. We further show that already the simple diagonal scaling of the <b>stifness</b> matrix results in a condition number that is bounded by $ch^{- 2 }$, with a constant $c$ that does not depend on the location of the interface. Both results are proven for the two-dimensional case. Results of numerical experiments in two and three dimensions are presented, which illustrate the quality of the preconditioner.

Maximum design ground acceleration in Slovenia was assumed in modal response spectrum analysis, which was followed by dimensioning, according to EC 8 as well.

40|$|The {{present study}} focusses on {{algorithmic}} aspects related to deformation dependent loads in nonlinear static finite element analysis. If the deformation dependency is considered {{only on the}} right hand side, a considerable {{increase in the number}} of iterations follows. It may also cause failure of convergence in the proximity of a critical points. If in turn the deformation dependent loading is included within the consistent linerarization, an additional left hand side term emerges, the so-called load <b>stifness</b> matrix. In this paper several numerical test cases are used to show and quantify the influence of the two different approaches on the iteration process. Consideration of the complete load stiffness matrix may result in a cumbersome coding effort, different for each load case, and in certain cases its derivation is even not practicable at all. Therefore also several formulations for approximated load stiffness matrices are presented. It is shown that these simplifications not only reduce the additional effort for linearization and implementation, but also keep the iterative costs relatively small and still allow the calculation of the entire equilibrium path.

40|$|When {{compared}} to tests on reinforced concrete (RC) walls with a rectangular or barbelled cross-section, only very few tests on RC walls with open cross-section exist. Most of these walls {{were subjected to}} unidirectional or bidirectional loading along {{one or both of}} the principal axes of the wall section. It was rare that tests were done using load paths that did not follow the principal axes. This article presents a review of experimental tests of non-rectangular RC walls with open cross-section. The summary comprises tests on individual non-rectangular walls with different cross-sections such as for example L-shaped or U-shaped walls which were tested under quasi-static or dynamic loads. The tests are described with their prototype structure, test objectives, investigated parameters, loading protocols and test conclusions. Emphasis is placed on observations that are specific to non-rectangular walls, which include out-of-plane buckling of the free end of wall segments and significant deviations from the hypothesis that plane sections remain plane. The importance of bidirectional loading for non-rectangular walls is stressed because the critical loading direction for design may be different from loading in the principal directions of the section and because loading along one direction reduces the <b>stifness</b> of the wall for subsequent loading in the direction orthogonal to the previous one...|$|E

Analytical expressions for optimum values of main system parameters including primary and secondary dampings, mass ratio and secondary and primary springs stiffness ratios are also newly presented.

Disk degeneration often leads to tearing of the annulus fibrosus (AF) and extrusion of the nucleus pulposus. As the current surgical strategies are suboptimal, reconstruction of the AF tissue by a tissue engineering strategy has emerged as an alternative. However, regeneration of the AF is challenging due to its complex and non-homogeneous structure.

A hybrid code using Lighthill's nonlinear piston theory and Lanes's linear potential theory was developed to include these nonlinear effects. Lighthill's theory was {{used to calculate the}} unsteady pressures on the noninterference surface regions of the airfoils in cascade. Lane's theory was used to calculate the unsteady pressures on the remaining interference surface regions. Two airfoil profiles was investigated (a supersonic throughflow fan design and a NACA 66 - 206 airfoil with a sharp leading edge). Results show that compared with predictions of Lane's potential theory for flat plates, the inclusion of thickness (with or without camber) may increase or decrease the aeroelastic stability, depending on the airfoil geometry and operating conditions. When thickness effects are included in the aeroelastic analysis, inclusion of camber will influence the predicted stability in proportion to the magnitude of the added camber. The critical interblade phase angle, depending on the airfoil profile and operating conditions, may also be influenced by thickness and camber.

Parameter for assesing the impact of vibration on the building, which is widely recognized and compared to the criteria given in standard, is peak particle velocity. Based on the peak particle velocity we can determine the minimum distance between the source and existing building, in order to avoid construction damage.

These classifications {{are needed to}} calculate the fatigue life of these joints and {{should be included in}} the design codes. For years bridge design was mainly based on static loading. Due to the development of modern light weight steel structures and extremely increasing traffic loading fatigue design becomes more and more important. A review of all available data on orthotropic decks and related fatigue test results is included. The majority of the full scale fatigue testing on orthotropic decks has been carried out by members of a European Working Group. The statistical analysis procedure used to derive the weld classes for Eurocode 3 is used to place all of the main joints in the appropriate class, and to rank different designs of each joint. In addition, recommendations are made for both good joint design and those to be avoided. The composite action between the steel deck plate and the surfacing on orthotropic decks is an important aspect of the performance, in particular because the <b>stifness</b> of the combined unit helps to reduce strains in the welded structure as well as in the surfacing, which results in a longer lifetime.

The grouting boreholes are frequently drilled {{close to the}} tunnel wall, an area where rock stresses can be low and fractures can more easily open up during grout pressurization. In this paper we suggest that data from hydraulic testing and grouting {{can be used to}} identify grout-induced fracture opening, to estimate fracture stiffness of such fractures, and to evaluate its impact on the grout performance. A conceptual model and a method are presented for estimating fracture stiffness. The method is demonstrated using grouting data from four pre-excavation grouting boreholes at a shallow tunnel (50 m) in Nygard, Sweden, and two post-excavation grouting boreholes at a deep tunnel (450 m) in Aspo HRL, Sweden. The estimated stiffness of intersecting fractures for the boreholes at the shallow Nygard tunnel are low (2 - 5 GPa/m) and in agreement with literature data from field experiments at other fractured rock sites. Higher <b>stifness</b> was obtained for the deeper tunnel boreholes at Aspo which is reasonable considering that generally higher rock stresses are expected at greater depths. Our method of identifying and evaluating the properties and impact of deforming fractures might be most applicable when grouting takes place in boreholes adjacent to the tunnel wall, where local stresses might be low and where deforming (opening) fractures may take most of the grout.

40|$|This thesis {{proposes a}} {{generalization}} {{of the projected}} gradient method with variable metric to an abstract Banach space setting. The motivation is the increasing interest in optimization problems posed in a Banach space and the current lack of general, globally convergent optimization methods therefor. Global convergence of the new variable metric projection type (VMPT) method is shown by adapting the assumptions of the finite dimensional setting appropriately using two different norms. Many aspects of the method are discussed, in particular different globalization strategies, the incorporation of second order information leading to Newton and quasi-Newton type methods and an application to proximal gradient methods. Similarities to existing numerical methods are pointed out and the application to a model problem is presented. The application of the new method to a topology optimization problem using a phase field model is discussed in detail. It is shown that the weak conditions for global convergence are satisfied. A semismooth Newton method for {{the solution of the}} arising subproblem is presented and local converence is shown on the descrete level. The various numerical results are compared to the literature and to other state-of-the-art solvers, showing the superior performance of the new method. An existing modern time stepping scheme is enhanced by the introduction of adaptively chosen time step sizes, based on the theoretical results of the thesis. Multiple choices for the variable metric are discussed analytically and numerically and a problem specific scaling is derived. Moreover, reasonable choices for the problem parameters such as the <b>stifness</b> tensor interpolation are analyzed.

Using a combination of serum ALT, bilirubin and albumin levels to predict the presence of significant fibrosis, the sensitivity and specificity were 19 % and 98 % respectively, with positive predictive value of 84 % and negative predictive value of 96 %. Conclusion: The prevalence of significant fibrosis in Chinese CHB patients was high, affecting {{more than half of the}} patients over the age of 55 years. LSM correlated well with known factors associated with more severe disease, including older age, male sex, higher bilirubin and ALT, and lower albumin. The combination of serum bilirubin, ALT and albumin levels may be used to predict significant underlying fibrosis. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

The aim ofthis {{study was to investigate}} the {{prevalence of}} significant fibrosis in a Chinese population with CHB by liver <b>stifness</b> measurement (LSM), and its correlation with liver biochemistry and demographic factors. Methods: All CHB patients seen at Hepatitis Clinic, Queen Mary Hospital, Hong Kong for CHB between January to July 2006 with LSM by transient elastography were included. Results: Of the 898 patients included with a median age of 44, 323 (36 %) had significant fibrosis as defined by LSM of > 8. 1 kPa. Males had a higher median liver stithess measurement (MLSM) than females (7. 3 vs 5. 9 kPa, p 0. 001), and those positive for HBeAg had higher MLSM than HBeAgnegative patients (7. 3 and 6. 4 kPa respectively, p = 0. 017). In patients 65 years of age, the MLSM was 6. 0, 6. 0, 6. 4, 7. 6, 8. 7 and 11. 6 kPa respectively (p 5 xULN, the MLSM was 5. 7, 6. 7, 8. 4, 11. 7 and 19. 1 kPa respectively (p i 0. 001).

40|$|Microalbuminuria (MA) plays a {{significant}} prognostic {{role for the}} evaluation of cardiovascular risk in patients with essential hypertension. It is beeing considered as a general marker of vascular disease which is not confined to the renal bed alone. If the aortic mechanical properties are involved in this process is not yet elucidated. Towards this direction we evaluated the elasticity of ascending thoracic aorta in 162 non-diabetic patients with uncomplicated essential hypertension stage II to III (aged 54 +- 10 years, 82 males, 75 with MA [mean albumin excretion 20 - 200 mg/ 24 hours in 3 consecutive 24 hours urinary collections] kai 87 normoalbuminurics). The aortic distensibility (AoD) and the aortic strain (AoS) were calculated combining ultrasound measurements of aortic diameters with sphygmomanometric measurements of BP at the brachial level. The 2 subgroups of patients, those with and those without MA, exhibited similar demographic parameters and lipid levels. Patients with MA had significantly higher systolic BP, pulse pressure and left ventricular mass index (LVMI), in comparison with normoalbuminuric patients. Both indicators of aortic elasticity were significantly reduced in MA patients comparing with the patients without MA (1, 6 +- 0, 9 vs 3, 2 +- 2, 1 dyne- 1. cm 2. 10 - 6, p< 0, 001 and 0, 039 +- 0, 017 vs 0, 069 +- 0, 019, p< 0, 001 respectively). Indicators of aortic elasticity negatively corellated with 24 hour urinary albumin excretion (UAE) (p< 0, 001) and LVMI (p< 0, 001), while UAE corellated possitively with LVMI (p< 0, 001). Using models of multiple regression analysis we found that age, mean BP and UAE corellated independently with AoD and AoS in the total population of our study (p< 0, 001 for all corellations). In conclusion, hypertensive patients with MA show a further deterioration of aortic elastic properties in corellation with those who do not have MA. The unfavorable consequences caused by the increment of large arteries <b>stifness,</b> possibly represent a logical explanation for the increased cardivascular risk of patients with essential hypertension and MA. ...|$|E
40|$|The masonry panel, as the {{vertical}} loads is concerned, are suposed {{to influence the}} structural behavior of the building, contributing for the overall <b>stifness</b> of the construction, both {{in the case of}} structural masonry, {{and in the case of}} a masonry panels in reinforced concrete structures. It is recognized that the interaction between the masonry panels and the supporting elements is expressed by a partial transference of loads, through the panels, to the supporting element. The rest of the load is transferred to the fixed points of the supporting beam, by means of a mechanism of compression arch that is developed in the masonry panel. The present study is aiming to contribute for a better knowledge of the main aspects of the lightweight concrete block masonry panel and the supporting element behaviour, as well as the composite action between them. An analysis was done, using a finite element model, of a uniformly vertically loaded (in the top) solid block masonry panel and supporting beam test (the beam spans between supports), for the determination of internal stress distributions in masonry. The finite element model accounts for the linear, and, eventually nonlinear behaviour of masonry caused by non-linear material characteristics of the masonry constituents. The elastic block properties were estimated from uniaxial and triaxial compression tests, and from flexure strength tests. The mortar properties were obtained from uniaxial and triaxial compression test on mortar samples and triaxial compression and direct shear tests on blockwork couplets which incorporated a mortar joint. The strength of the mortar joint under tension was obtained from a flexure strength test on mortar samples, as well as on solid blockwork couplet (with a vertical joint). A series of uniaxial compression tests in a compressive test machine was also carried out on panels of solid blockwork (lightweight concrete blocks) for the determination of masonry compressive strength. These characteristics were used as data into an incremental finite element program that models the nonlinear block and joint properties and simulates progressive block and joint failure [...] .

40|$|Sandwich {{materials}} are structures made of two stiff skins and a softer lightweight core in between them. The {{function of the}} core is to separate the face sheets without significantly increasing the weight, thus increasing the moment of in- ertia of the structure. This makes sandwich structures convenient and eficient to resist bending and buckling loads while keeping a light weight, especially for applications where the weight is a critical factor (such as naval, aerospace, the transport industry and sporting equipment). For applications requiring resistance to impact loading (such as ship hulls, armors, helmets...) sandwich materials have good capabilities in absorbing energy. The face sheets are designed to resist penetration/fracture, while the core is comprised of a material able to deform at a controlled level of stress providing isolation and damping of vibrations. The possible modes of failure of a sandwich panel are: face yielding or fracture, face and core indentation, face wrinkling (local buckling of the face sheets), core failure (usually in shear), and failure in the bonding between the core and the face sheets. This last one is the most diffcult to analyze because delamination {{is affected by the}} nature of the interface between the two ma- terials and also depends on the kind of adhesive being used. Oftentimes the adhesive is stronger than the core itself, so the bond is not a problem unless an interfacial crack appears which may propagate and separate the structure. Functionally graded materials (FGM) are characterized by the gradual vari- ation of the composition over the volume, which implies a gradual variation of the mechanical properties. This concept can be used in a sandwich struc- ture in order to enhance its performance and better tailor its properties. More precisely, the concept of FGM can be used in sandwich structures to im- prove the interface between the face sheets and the core, making it a smooth transition between materials, in order to mitigate the bonding failure and de- lamination at the interface. Multi-material Additive Manufacturing has created the opportunity of building structures that contain diferent materials with very dissimilar me- chanical properties integrated in the same body. This technology can allow manufacturing complex parts while controlling at a microscopic scale the lo- cal composition of the material being printed, which can be used to generate functionally graded materials. In this project, the device used is a Strata- sys Objet 260 Connex 3 which can print blending up to three diferent base materials in the same part, although only a two material gradation has been studied. The objective of this work is to design, manufacture, and model the me- chanical behavior of functionally graded sandwich beams, in order to obtain optimized combinations of <b>stifness</b> and damping. For this purpose, the vis- coelastic mechanical properties of the base 3 -D printed materials (i. e. Ve- roCyan and TangoBlack+) have been obtained experimentally using varioustechniques. Three diferent designs of graded sandwich structures have been proposed and modeled: linear graded face sheets, quadratic graded face sheets and quadratic graded core...|$|E
40|$|Efectuou-se um estudo prospectivo e observacional em 1200 doentes, maiores de 18 anos, com hipertensão essencial e sem eventos cardiovasculares (CV) prévbs que foram referenciados entre 1991 e 1998 para realização de MAPA no Serviço de Cardiologia do Hospital Infante D. Pedro, Aveiro (HIP), na Unidade de Hipertensão e Risco CV do Hospital Pedro Hispano (HPH), Matosinhos e na Clínica Cross/Moss do Porto. O objectivo {{principal}} deste estudo foi avaliar, nesta população, seguida durante 8 - 12 anos, o valor preditivo de morbi-mortalidade CV da pressurometria ambulatória de 24 horas (MAPA), nomeadamente de diversos índices e valores dela extraída, tais como: (i) valores médios da pressão arterial (PA) de 24 -h, diurna e nocturna; (ii) queda tensional noctuma, (iii) diferentes padrões de queda tensional nocturna em particular do padrão Non Dipper; (iv) PA diferencial de 24 h, diurna e nodurna; (v) frequência cardíaca de 24 horas (vi) Ambulatory Arterial <b>Stifness.</b> Foram incluídos registos de MAPA de 1200 doentes, de um total de 2644, dos quais 53, 8 % eram mulheres e 10, 2 % eram diabéticos. Ao longo de um {{follow up}} médio de 8, 2 + 3, 0 anos, verificaram-se 62 óbitos e 152 eventos CV fatais e não fatais compreendendo 79 AVC, 51 eventos coronários e 22 classificados de outros eventos cardiovasculares. O estudo permitiu concluir que: 1 - A MAPA foi superior a PA casual como preditor de eventos CV globais e de acidentes cerebrovasculares (AVC). 2 - De entre os valores da MAPA, o valor preditivo dos valores sistólicos (de 24 h, diurnos e nocturnos) foi superior ao dos respectivos valores diastólicos e o dos valores nocturnos foi superior ao dos valores diurnos. 3 - 0 s eventos CV totais e os eventos coronários foram mais frequentes nos homens do que nas mulheres, sem diferença relativamente ao AVC. O valor preditivo independente da MAPA (sobretudo da PAS e da PP 24 h) foi superior nas mulheres vs homens relativamente aos eventos globais e AVC. 4 - 0 s padrões non-dipper e reverted-dipper de queda tensional nocturna associaram-se a pior prognóstico cardiovascular, relativamente ao padrão dipper. Contudo, dentro do padrão non-dipper, somente os doentes com queda tensional nocturna entre 0 - 4, 9 % -non-dippers 1 (mas não os doentes com queda tensional nocturna entre 5,O- 9, 9 % -non-dippers 2) apresentaram risco CV superior ao do padrão dipper e semelhante ao do padrão reverted-dipper. Este achado poderá implicar a reclassificação do padrão non-dipper e do risco CV a ele associado. 5 - O índice de rigidez arterial derivado da MAPA (AASI) correlaciona-se com outros índices (ex. a velocidade da onda de pulso) e contribui para estratificar o risco CV (eventos CV e AVC). O valor preditivo CV do AASI não é globalmente superior ao da PP 24 h, embora em alguns casos o AASI possa acrescentar informação prognostica adicional a PP. It was done a prospective observational study in a hypertensive population with 1200 patients, older than 18 years with essential hypertension e without previous cardiovascular events (CV) that were referenced for ABP record between {{the period of}} 1991 to 1998 to Infante D. Pedro Hospital, (HIP) Aveiro, Pedro Hispano Hospital (HPH) Matosinhos and to Cross/Moss Clinic, Oporto. The principal aim {{of the study was}} to evaluate in this population followed during 8 - 12 years the predictive value of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality of ABP values namely the different indexes and values obtained from ABP such as (i) mean values of 24 h BP, daytime and nightime BP (ii) BP dipping (iii) the different patterns of BP dipping, especially non dipper pattern (iv) 24 h daytime and nightime pulse pressure (v) 24 h heart rate (vi) ambulatory arterial stiffness. They were included 1200 records of ABP from 1200 patients from a total of 2644,from witch 53, 8 % were women, 10, 2 % were diabetics. During a mean period follow up of 8. 2 + 3. 0 years, were observed 62 deaths and 152 fatal and non fatal cardiovascular events of witch 79 strokes, 51 coronary events (DC) and 22 classified as other cardiovascular events. The study could cqnclude: 1 - ABP is superior to casual BP as CV predictor of global CV events and cerebrovascular events (AVC). 2 -From ABP values, the predictive value of systolic blood pressure values (24 h, daytime and nightime) was superior to the respective diastolic values and the nightime values were superior to the respective daytime values. 3) Global CV events and coronary events were more frequent in men than in women, with no differences for stroke. The independent predictive value of ABP, (especially SBP and 24 h PP) was superior in women vs men relatively to global CV events and stroke. 3 - Those with nightime dipping classified as non dipper and reverted dipper pattern was associated to a worst CV prognosis compared to those who have a dipper pattern. However in the non dipper pattern only those with nightime dipping between 0 - 4,g 0 h-non dippers 1 (but not those patients with nightime dipping between 5 - 9, 9 % -non dippers 2) were associated to a higher CV risk compared to the dipper pattern but similar to the reverted dipper pattern. This fact may imply the reclassification of the non dipper pattern and also the CV risk that is associated to him. 4) The ambulatory arterial stiffness (AASI) was correlated with other indexes (ex: PWV) and contributes to stratify CV risk (global CV events and stroke) However the predictive CV value of AASl is not inherently superior to 24 h PP, but in some cases can addict some prognosis information.
