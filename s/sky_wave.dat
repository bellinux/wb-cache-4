500|$|The Mexican government, {{eager to}} get even with its {{northern}} neighbors for dividing up North America's radio frequencies without giving any to Mexico, granted Brinkley a 50,000-watt radio license and construction began on XER-AM, his new [...] "border blaster" [...] across the bridge from Del Rio in Villa Acuña, Coahuila (since renamed Ciudad Acuña). [...] As construction got underway, Fishbein and the U.S. State Department desperately searched {{for a way to}} shut Brinkley down. Under heavy pressure from the State Department, the Mexican government halted construction on XER-AM, but it was only temporary. [...] Within weeks, construction resumed and soon two [...] towers reached into the sky. XER, at 840kilohertz on the AM dial, radiated by a <b>sky</b> <b>wave</b> antenna, made its first broadcast in October 1931. [...] Brinkley called it the [...] "Sunshine Station Between the Nations".|$|E

2500|$|Although {{intended}} as a bomber and never before deployed by the USAF to a combat zone, the first B-57s to be deployed to South Vietnam were not operated in an offensive role. [...] The need for additional reconnaissance assets, especially those capable of operating at night, led to the deployment of two RB-57E aircraft on 15 April 1963. [...] Under project Patricia Lynn these aircraft provided infrared coverage using their Reconofax VI cameras. [...] Later in August 1965, a single RB-57F would be deployed to Udorn, RTAB {{in an attempt to}} gather information about North Vietnamese SAM sites, first under project Greek God and then under project Mad King. In December another RB-57F would be deployed for this purpose, under project <b>Sky</b> <b>Wave.</b> Neither project garnered useful results and they were terminated in October 1965 and February 1966 respectively.|$|E
40|$|Wide band {{magnetic}} direction finding {{from two}} stations {{is used to}} determine lightning locations and ionospheric height during two nocturnal maritime thunderstorms near Florida. A comparison of calculated lightning locations with radar reflectivity data of the two storms indicates systematic direction-finding errors {{to be on the}} order of 1 deg. From the lightning locations and measured arrival times of the first and second <b>sky</b> <b>waves,</b> ionospheric reflecting heights for both <b>sky</b> <b>waves</b> were determined. The effective heights for the first and second <b>sky</b> <b>waves</b> may differ, leading to large errors in single-station determinations of ionospheric height, such as in the method described by Kinzer (1974). The distribution of peak electric fields for the strokes studied is shown to be in reasonable agreement with other determinations, indicating the reliability of the present measurements...|$|R
50|$|At {{distances}} {{greater than}} about 500 km, <b>sky</b> <b>waves</b> reflected several {{times at the}} ionosphere must be added. Therefore, mode theory is here more appropriate.

50|$|Sectional: the {{structure}} is divided into usually two sections with insulators between, usually center-fed. This collinear arrangement enhances low-angle (ground wave) radiation and reduces high-angle (<b>sky</b> <b>wave)</b> radiation. This increases {{the distance to the}} mush zone where the ground wave and <b>sky</b> <b>wave</b> are at similar strength at night. This type of antenna is known as an anti-fading aerial. Practical sectionals with 120 over 120 degrees, 180 over 120 degrees and 180 over 180 degrees are presently in operation with good results.|$|E

50|$|It can be mitigated to {{some extent}} {{by the use of}} a tall mast {{radiator}} of up to about 0.6 wavelengths height, which increases the ground wave field strength while reducing high-angle <b>sky</b> <b>wave</b> radiation.|$|E
50|$|HF {{communications}} {{are in the}} 2-30 MHz band, {{which provides}} Beyond Line-Of-Sight (BLOS) communication (HF <b>Sky</b> <b>Wave</b> or HF Ground Wave) optimized for transmission up to 300 nmi km. HF also provides direct Line-Of-Sight (LOS) communications.|$|E
50|$|When {{distances}} {{are less}} than about 500 km (depending on frequency), then ray theory is appropriate. The ground wave and the first hop (or <b>sky)</b> <b>wave</b> reflected at the ionospheric D layer interfere with each other.|$|E
50|$|In the VLF range, the {{transfer}} function {{is the sum of}} a ground wave which arrives directly at the receiver and multihop <b>sky</b> <b>waves</b> reflected at the ionospheric D-layer (Figure 1). For the real Earth's surface, the ground wave becomes dissipated and depends of the orography along the ray path. For VLF waves at shorter distances, this effect is, however, of minor importance, and the reflection factor of the Earth is Re = 1, in a first approximation.|$|R

50|$|Night effect : Radio waves {{reflected}} {{back by the}} ionosphere {{can cause}} signal strength fluctuations 30 to 60 nautical miles (54 to 108 km) from the transmitter, especially just before sunrise and just after sunset. This is more common on frequencies above 350 kHz. Because the returning <b>sky</b> <b>waves</b> travel over a different path, {{they have a different}} phase from the ground wave. This has the effect of suppressing the aerial signal in a fairly random manner. The needle on the indicator will start wandering. The indication will be most erratic during twilight at dusk and dawn.|$|R
50|$|In mediumwave broadcasting, a mush zone is {{a region}} where the ground wave and <b>sky</b> <b>wave</b> from a {{transmitter}} are received at approximately equal signal strength, resulting in interference between the two, which will typically cause fading and distorted audio.|$|E
5000|$|The {{inversion}} effectively reduces <b>sky</b> <b>wave</b> {{radiation from}} a transmitter [...] - [...] normally VHF and UHF signals travel on into space {{when they reach}} the horizon, the refractive index of the ionosphere preventing signal return. With temperature inversion, however, the signal is {{to a large extent}} refracted over the horizon rather than continuing along a direct path into outer space.|$|E
50|$|At {{frequencies}} between 3 and 30 MHz, a {{large portion}} of the energy from a horizontally polarized antenna reflects off the ground, with almost total reflection at the grazing angles important for ground wave propagation. That reflected wave, with its phase reversed, can either cancel or reinforce the direct wave, depending on the antenna height in wavelengths and elevation angle (for a <b>sky</b> <b>wave).</b>|$|E

But in the blood-red glare, with their black faces and yellow figures, they looked like devils carrying instruments of torture. In the dim garden behind them a distant voice was heard calling out brief directions. When the priest heard the voice, a terrible change came over his countenance.|$|R

50|$|At shorter distances, {{only the}} first hop <b>sky</b> <b>wave</b> is of importance. The D-layer can be {{simulated}} by a magnetic wall (Ri = -1) with a fixed boundary at a virtual height h, which means a phase jump of 180° at the reflection point. In reality, the electron density of the D-layer increases with altitude, and the wave is bounded as shown in Figure 2.|$|E
50|$|Whenever {{both the}} {{receiving}} or transmitting antenna are placed at significant heights {{above the ground}} (relative to the wavelength), waves specularly reflected by the ground will travel a longer distance than direct waves, inducing a phase shift which can sometimes be significant. When a <b>sky</b> <b>wave</b> is launched by such an antenna, that phase shift is always significant unless the antenna {{is very close to}} the ground (compared to the wavelength).|$|E

60|$|While I {{was taking}} {{advantage}} of a temporary halt, to feed and water my pony, Lieutenant MacNaghten of the 16th Lancers pointed them out to me, and we watched them through our glasses. It was a strange sight. Little figures running about confusedly, tiny puffs of smoke, a miniature officer silhouetted against the <b>sky</b> <b>waving</b> his sword. It seemed impossible to believe that they were fighting for their lives, or indeed in any danger. It all looked so small and unreal. They were, however, hard pressed, and had signalled that they were running out of cartridges. It was then five o'clock, and the approach of darkness was accelerated by the heavy thunderclouds which were gathering over the northern mountains.|$|R

50|$|The station's most {{important}} transmitter was at Berlin-Britz (on 612 kHz). Later a second transmitter at Hof in Bavaria {{was added to}} improve reception in the southern parts of East Germany (on 684 kHz), which was switched on at sunset to cover Germany with <b>sky</b> <b>wave</b> While the facility at Hof has been closed and carted off to Mühlacker in 1994, Berlin-Britz remained in service until 2013, transmitting the programmes of Deutschlandradio Kultur; it was finally dismantled in 2015.|$|E
5000|$|When using {{medium to}} high {{frequency}} radio telecommunication, there are radio waves which travel both {{parallel to the}} ground, and towards the ionosphere, {{referred to as a}} ground wave and <b>sky</b> <b>wave,</b> respectively. A skip zone is an annular region between the farthest points at which the ground wave can be received and the nearest point at which the refracted sky waves can be received. Within this region, no signal can be received because, due to the conditions of the local ionosphere, the relevant sky waves are not reflected but penetrate the ionosphere.|$|E
5000|$|Since the {{vertical}} wire {{is the actual}} radiating element, the antenna radiates vertically polarized radio waves in an omnidirectional radiation pattern, with equal power in all azimuthal directions. [...] The axis of the horizontal wire makes little difference. The power is maximum in a horizontal direction or at a shallow elevation angle, decreasing to zero at the zenith. This makes it a good antenna at LF or MF frequencies, which propagate as ground waves with vertical polarization, but it also radiates enough power at higher elevation angles to be useful for <b>sky</b> <b>wave</b> ("skip") communication. The effect of poor ground conductivity is generally to tilt the pattern up, with the maximum signal strength at a higher elevation angle.|$|E

50|$|Early RDF {{systems were}} useful largely for long wave signals. These signals {{are able to}} travel very long distances, which made them useful for {{long-range}} navigation. However, when the same technique was being applied to higher frequencies, unexpected difficulties arose due to the reflection of high frequency signals from the ionosphere. The RDF station might now receive the same signal from two or more locations, especially during the day, which caused serious problems trying to determine the location. This led to the 1919 introduction of the Adcock antenna (UK Patent 130,490), which consisted of four separate monopole antennas instead of two loops, eliminating the horizontal components and thus filtering out the <b>sky</b> <b>waves</b> being reflected down from the ionosphere. Adcock antennas were widely used with Bellini-Tosi detectors from the 1920s on.|$|R
5000|$|The {{theory of}} ray {{propagation}} of VLF waves breaks down at larger distances {{because in the}} sum of these <b>waves</b> successive multihop <b>sky</b> <b>waves</b> are involved, and the sum diverges. In addition, it becomes necessary {{to take into account}} the spherical Earth. Mode theory which is the sum of eigen-modes in the Earth-ionosphere waveguide is valid in this range of distances. The wave modes have fixed vertical structures of their vertical electric field components with maximum amplitudes at the bottom and zero amplitudes at the top of the waveguide. In the case of the fundamental first mode, it is a quarter wavelength. With decreasing frequency, the eigenvalue becomes imaginary at the cutoff frequency, where the mode changes to an evanescent wave. For the first mode, this happens at ...|$|R
