5|$|The {{species can}} hunt singly, in pairs, and in groups, relying on sharp {{eyesight}} to locate prey. In some cases, supposed cooperative hunting may be incidental, {{a result of}} group members fishing individually in close proximity; truly coordinated hunting may only occur where the prey cannot be taken by a single giant otter, such as with small anacondas and juvenile black caiman. The giant otter seems to prefer prey fish that are generally immobile on river bottoms in clear water. Prey chase is rapid and tumultuous, with lunges and twists through the shallows and few missed targets. The otter can attack from both above and below, <b>swiveling</b> at the last instant to clamp the prey in its jaws. Giant otters catch their own food and consume it immediately; they grasp the fish firmly between the forepaws and begin eating noisily at the head. Carter and Rosas have found captive adult animals consume around 10% of their body weight daily—about , in keeping with findings in the wild.|$|E
25|$|The {{aircraft}} {{was equipped with}} a full <b>swiveling</b> tail wheel. There {{is no mention of}} the auxiliary wheel being retractable.|$|E
25|$|The <b>swiveling</b> {{nose of the}} {{airframe}} {{was sent}} to Eglin Field for armament tests, although the weapons were never fired in the air.|$|E
25|$|The medal has a <b>swiveling</b> bar suspension, {{attached}} to the medal with a single-toe claw and a horizontal pin through the upper edge of the medal, with double scroll claw supports on the medal rim.|$|E
25|$|The medal {{was struck}} in silver {{and is a}} disk, 36 millimetres in {{diameter}} and with a raised rim on both sides. The suspender is an ornamented scroll pattern <b>swiveling</b> type, affixed to the medal {{by means of a}} single-toe claw and a pin through the upper edge of the medal.|$|E
25|$|FFA 223 re-equipped with AEG G.II bombers in August 1915. The twin-engined giant was {{manned by}} a pilot, {{two or three}} observers, and two <b>swiveling</b> machine guns. Even as the new bombers came on board, the unit also {{received}} its first single-seat fighter with a synchronized gun, a Fokker Eindekker.|$|E
25|$|The Queen Elizabeth II {{versions}} {{reverted to}} <b>swiveling</b> suspenders. While the double scroll claw supports {{of the earlier}} versions were retained, the suspender is affixed {{to the top of}} the medal rim without the hitherto used claw and pin attachment. However, some version one medals were issued with the same attachment as the King George VI version.|$|E
25|$|Production was {{authorized}} in January 1949, {{with the first}} production F-89A flying in September 1950. It had AN/APG-33 radar and an armament of six 20mm (.79in) T-31 cannons with 200 rpg. The <b>swiveling</b> nose turret was abandoned, and 300US gal (1,100l) fuel tanks were permanently fitted to the wingtips. Underwing racks could carry 16 5in (127mm) aerial rockets or up to 3,200lb (1,455kg) of bombs.|$|E
25|$|The medal {{was struck}} in silver {{and is a}} disk, 36 millimetres in {{diameter}} and with a raised rim on both sides. The suspender is an ornamented scroll pattern <b>swiveling</b> type, affixed to the medal {{by means of a}} claw and a horizontal pin through the upper edge of the medal. On the Queen Victoria version the suspender mount is a double-toe claw, while the King Edward VII version has a single-toe claw.|$|E
25|$|Tactical F-111s were {{fitted with}} {{shoulder}} rails {{on the four}} inner <b>swiveling</b> pylons to mount AIM-9 Sidewinder air-to-air missiles for self-defense. Australian F-111Cs were equipped to launch the Harpoon anti-ship missile, and the Popeye stand-off missile. FB-111As could carry the same conventional ordnance as the tactical variants, but their wing pylons were more commonly used for either fuel tanks or strategic nuclear gravity bombs. They could carry up to four AGM-69 SRAM nuclear missiles on the pylons.|$|E
25|$|Modern unloaders use rotary dump devices, which {{eliminate}} {{problems with}} coal freezing in bottom dump cars. The unloader includes a train positioner arm that pulls the entire train to position each car over a coal hopper. The dumper clamps an individual car against a platform that swivels the car upside down {{to dump the}} coal. <b>Swiveling</b> couplers enable the entire operation to occur while the cars are still coupled together. Unloading a unit train takes about three hours.|$|E
25|$|Two {{versions}} of suspender were also produced. The first medals, including the dated ones, had a straight suspender that was {{wide enough to}} accept the 38 millimetres (1½ inches) wide ribbon. The suspender was changed to a narrower width in 1875, to accept a new 32 millimetres (1¼ inches) wide ribbon. Both types of suspender were <b>swiveling</b> and were affixed to the medal {{by means of a}} double-toe claw and a horizontal pin through the upper edge of the medal.|$|E
25|$|The 67 X (also Toronado 67X, Esso 67X) is a Canadian-built automobile, {{based on}} the Toronado, that was {{designed}} and manufactured by automobile customizer George Barris for Canada's Expo 67, where they were raffled off in a contest sponsored by Esso. Only four of these vehicles were ever made, but they included <b>swiveling</b> seats, a sofa, and even a refrigeration unit, with an overall sleek-looking design. Commercials for this vehicle were aired in the Stanley Cup Playoffs final game between the Montreal Canadiens and Toronto Maple Leafs.|$|E
25|$|Ching's {{performance}} during the 2009 season earned him Dynamo's Golden Boot {{for the third}} straight year with eight goals and three assists. He became seventh Dynamo player to make 100th starts for the club in all competitions and assisted on Cam Weaver's game-tying goal in the 80th minute of a 2-1 loss at Columbus Crew on September 13. In the 2008–09 CONCACAF Champions League Ching played all 90 minutes of both legs of the quarterfinal series vs. C.F. Atlante. He appeared in five games of the 2009–10 CONCACAF Champions League, making three starts. In the 2009 MLS Cup Playoffs, he netted the game-winning goal in 95th minute of a 1-0 overtime win vs. Seattle, <b>swiveling</b> to volley a shot into the left side netting for his 50th Dynamo goal in all competitions.|$|E
25|$|Though {{his mother}} favored his {{retirement}} from public life, Roosevelt, his wife, and Roosevelt's {{close friend and}} adviser, Louis Howe, were all determined that Roosevelt continue his political career. Roosevelt convinced many people that he was improving, which he believed to be essential prior to running for public office again. He laboriously taught himself to walk short distances while wearing iron braces on his hips and legs by <b>swiveling</b> his torso, supporting himself with a cane. He was careful never to be seen using his wheelchair in public, and great care was taken to prevent any portrayal in the press that would highlight his disability. However, his disability was well known before and during his presidency and became {{a major part of}} his image. He usually appeared in public standing upright, supported on one side by an aide or one of his sons.|$|E
25|$|The {{weapon was}} moved long {{distances}} via rail on {{a variant of}} a Schnabel car; the whole chassis was hung between two huge pedestal-mounted <b>swiveling</b> arms fixed to five-axle bogies. When it reached its destination, the weapon was detached from its supporting arms, driven to its intended firing location, then the chassis was lowered to the ground by lowering the suspension on its continuous track units' roadwheels on each side to distribute the recoil forces more evenly in preparation for firing. The Karl-Gerät proved to have no problems moving over normal soil, but under no circumstances was it allowed to make turns on soft soil lest it throw a track. The chassis had to be backed into position to fire, which expedited movement to a new position, but the firing position had to be precisely leveled and the approach route prepared ahead of time to fill in soft spots and any ditches, etc. It could only be loaded at zero elevation, so {{it had to be}} re-aimed between every shot.|$|E
25|$|The Corsair's {{aerodynamics}} were {{an advance}} over those of contemporary naval fighters. The F4U {{was the first}} U.S. Navy aircraft to feature landing gear that retracted into a fully enclosed wheel well. The landing gear oleo struts — each with their own strut door enclosing them when retracted — rotated through 90° during retraction, with the wheel atop {{the lower end of}} the strut when retracted; a pair of rectangular doors enclosed each wheel well, leaving a streamlined wing. This <b>swiveling,</b> aft-retracting landing gear design was common to the Curtiss P-40 (and its predecessor, the Curtiss P-36), as adopted for the F4U Corsair's main gear and its erstwhile Pacific War counterpart, the Grumman F6F Hellcat. The oil coolers were mounted in the heavily anhedraled center-section of the wings, alongside the supercharger air intakes, and used openings in the leading edges of the wings, rather than protruding scoops. The large fuselage panels were made of aluminum and were attached to the frames with the newly developed technique of spot welding, thus mostly eliminating the use of rivets. While employing this new technology, the Corsair was also the last American-produced fighter aircraft to feature fabric as the skinning for the top and bottom of each outer wing, aft of the main spar and armament bays, and for the ailerons, elevators and rudder. The elevators were also constructed from plywood. The Corsair, even with its streamlining and high speed abilities, could fly slowly enough for carrier landings with full flap deployment of 60°.|$|E
500|$|Governor-General Frontenac {{ordered the}} {{construction}} of a second, more imposing fort in 1692. It was rebuilt in 1702-1703 to protect the nearby fur trading post. With extensive cannons and <b>swiveling</b> wall guns, it was the [...] "most substantial castle-like fort" [...] near Montreal. It was eventually destroyed in 1776 by Benedict Arnold, under American military control, but the ruins have been maintained since then. In 2003, it was classified as a historic site.|$|E
500|$|The medal is a {{circular}} bronze disc [...] in diameter. On the front, the state emblem {{appears in the}} center on a raised circle surrounded by four copies of the vajra, the mythical weapon of Indra, the ancient Vedic King of Gods. The motif symbolizes the sacrifice of Rishi Dadhichi, who gave his bones to the Gods to make the vajra to kill the demon Vritra. The medal is suspended from a straight <b>swiveling</b> suspension bar. On the rear, around a plain center, are two legends separated by lotus flowers. The words Param Vir Chakra are written in Hindi and English. A purple ribbon, [...] long, holds the Param Vir Chakra.|$|E
500|$|In {{a review}} of her 2002 Radio City Music Hall concert, Stephen Holden of The New York Times {{described}} Peters as [...] "the peaches-and-cream embodiment of an ageless storybook princess... inside a giant soap bubble floating toward heaven. A belief {{in the power of}} the dreams behind Rodgers and Hammerstein's songs, if not in their reality, was possible." [...] Peters made her solo concert debut at Lincoln Center in New York City in 2006. Holden, reviewing this concert, noted, [...] "Even while <b>swiveling</b> across the stage of Avery Fisher Hall like a voluptuous Botticelli Venus in Bob Mackie spangles... she radiated a preternatural innocence.... For the eternal child in all of us, she evokes a surrogate childhood playmate". Peters was the headliner at the 2009 Adelaide Cabaret Festival in Adelaide, Australia. The Sunday Mail wrote that Peters showed [...] "the verve, vigour and voice of someone half her age." ...|$|E
500|$|When Kaga {{was being}} designed, {{the problem of}} how to deal with exhaust gases in carrier {{operations}} had not been resolved. The <b>swiveling</b> funnels of [...] had not proved successful and wind-tunnel testing had not provided an answer. As a result, Akagi and Kaga were given different exhaust systems to evaluate in real-world conditions. Kagas funnel gases were collected in a pair of long horizontal ducts which discharged at the rear of each side of the flight deck, in spite of predictions by a number of prominent naval architects that they would not keep the hot gases away from the flight deck. The predictions proved to be correct, not least because Kaga was slower than the Akagi which allowed the gases to rise and interfere with landing operations. Another drawback was that the heat of the gases made the crew's quarters located on the side of the ship by the funnels almost uninhabitable.|$|E
500|$|The {{unexpected}} {{commercial and}} critical success of Maxwell's Urban Hang Suite helped establish Maxwell {{as a serious}} performer in the music industry. He was described by critics as [...] "part {{of a new generation}} of smooth soul crooners", and he obtained a reputation among fans as a sex symbol, which according to one journalist, was due to his [...] "wild" [...] afro and [...] "extravagant cheekbones". His concert performances in promotion of the album attracted many female fans. One sold-out concert at New York City's Radio City Music Hall was praised by Rolling Stone, who compared him to R singers such as Gaye, Prince, Frankie Beverly, and Luther Vandross. The magazine highlighted Maxwell's showmanship, [...] "down-to-earth" [...] attitude and body movements including dropping down to his knees, <b>swiveling</b> his hips in a [...] "slow grind", and crawling across the stage while singing. Essence writer Jeannine Amber compared his stage presence to Teddy Pendergrass. According to some journalists, Maxwell's appeal to female fans was due to the respectful and sincere nature of his lyrics regarding women. In Contemporary Musician (1998), Mary Alice Adams examined the personal impact of his debut album on listeners: ...|$|E
500|$|... "The Bubble" [...] {{received}} generally positive reviews. The Atlantic writer Scott Meslow {{called the}} episode [...] "a {{fine example of}} Parks and Recreation at its funniest" [...] and along with [...] "Li'l Sebastian" [...] served as an [...] "ideal capper to a remarkably strong third season of the series". Meslow added that Ron's intervention {{on behalf of his}} co-workers demonstrates he is a [...] "much better manager than he lets on". Henry Hanks of CNN called it a very funny episode and said scenes of Ron <b>swiveling</b> around his circular desk to avoid talking to members of the public were [...] "masterfully executed". Alan Sepinwall of HitFix said he enjoyed Marlene's attempts to seduce Ben, and especially loved the subplot with Chris making changes to the parks department. He praised Nick Offerman's [...] "marvelously minimalist" [...] performance, especially while trying to avoid people in his swivel desk. Matt Fowler of IGN said the episode was hilarious and demonstrated [...] "how marvelously great this series is at creating a truly lovable ensemble". He also praised the subplot with Pamela Reed and the [...] "ridiculous filthiness" [...] of the fourth floor.|$|E
500|$|The four collaborated {{to write}} {{numerous}} [...] "minutes of gameplay" [...] documents, which conveyed how the game would feel. Church later gave the example, [...] "You {{hear the sound}} of a security camera <b>swiveling,</b> and then the beep of it acquiring you as a target, so you duck behind the crate and then you hear the door open so you throw a grenade and run out of the way". The documents would [...] "hint" [...] at the gameplay systems involved, and at the emergent possibilities in each situation. Although Neurath was involved in these initial design sessions, he believed that the project [...] "was always Doug Church's vision at heart". Church and Grossman refined several of the team's documents and defined the game's design and direction, and Grossman wrote the game's original design document. Grossman built on ideas that he first explored while writing and designing Ultima Underworld IIs tomb dimension, which he later called a [...] "mini-prototype" [...] for System Shock. These concepts included the minimization of dialogue trees and a greater focus on exploration. The team believed that dialogue trees [...] "broke the fiction" [...] of games; Church later commented that the dialogue trees in the Ultima Underworld series were like separate games in themselves, disconnected from main experience of being immersed in the environment. There were also concerns about realism.|$|E
500|$|Reviews for Xtort {{were almost}} universally positive. Jon Wiederhorn of Entertainment Weekly called it [...] "the {{heaviest}} and most danceable disc in [...] 12-year career" [...] while giving it an A-. Heidi MacDonald of CMJ New Music Monthly compared Xtort to getting {{hit with a}} wrecking ball, saying, [...] "When KMFDM does what it does best, {{it is the best}} at what it does, namely jack-hammer industrial anthems that hit with stunning precision and power." [...] Sandy Masuo of Rolling Stone called the album [...] "the product of a first-rate lineup," [...] and praised the album's diversity, saying, [...] "The 10 tracks on Xtort are grounded in KMFDM's smart synthesis of metallic crunch, <b>swiveling</b> rhythms and sophisticated electronics, but it's the organic elements that give the album a zesty twist." [...] Kevin M. Williams of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the album an [...] "essential" [...] rating, and said, [...] "KMFDM has some major mojo working with Xtort".Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic was less enthusiastic, saying, [...] "it would be nice to hear [...] branch out and start to experiment a little bit more", and commenting that while Xtort did not sound much different from previous releases, [...] "KMFDM sounds as good as they ever have, and several tracks rank among their best." [...] Liz Armstrong of the Daily Herald thought the guest contributors added significant differences to their individual songs.|$|E
500|$|James Montgomery of MTV News wrote Beyoncé has {{returned}} [...] "to claim her throne" [...] {{and that the}} message in the video [...] "hammers the point home with all the subtlety of a jackhammer". He highlighted the [...] "elaborate, hip-displacing dance routines, haute-couture costuming, wide-screen cinematography and expensive-looking sets". Larry Fitzmaurice of Pitchfork Media wrote that [...] "a thousand YouTube bedroom dancers flood the Internet with their own takes" [...] were {{to come in the}} near future. Rolling Stone praised Beyoncé's dance moves and wrote that it is the latest addition [...] "to the canon of dance pop videos with over-the-top apocalyptic imagery". Nick Neyland of Prefix Magazine wrote Beyoncé made the best music video of 2011, commending its [...] "big budget extravagance, full of preposterous costumes and ridiculously over the top dance routines". Sarah Anne Hughes of The Washington Post wrote that Beyoncé uses [...] "the non-violent tactic of dance to fight off some bad guys in riot gear" [...] and that Beyoncé's alter ego Sasha Fierce [...] "is out in full force as she uses an army of <b>swiveling</b> and shimmying women, her middle finger and two hyenas on leashes to keep control of a post-apocalyptic society". Billboard magazine wrote that Beyoncé made a triumphant return in the elaborate music video for [...] "Run the World (Girls)" [...] after creating classic clips for [...] "Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)", [...] "Crazy in Love", and [...] "Ring the Alarm".|$|E
500|$|Manohla Dargis of The New York Times deplored the film's pacing as [...] "mostly just plods" [...] {{and said}} it lacked humor. Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film only 2 out of 4 stars, feeling, [...] "for every slam-bang action sequence, there are far too many {{sluggish}} scenes." [...] David Edelstein of New York magazine misses the [...] "centrifugal threat" [...] of Alfred Molina's character, adding that [...] "the three villains here don't add up to one Doc Ock" [...] (referring to Alfred Molina's portrayal of the character in Spider-Man 2). James Berardinelli felt director Sam Raimi [...] "overreached his grasp" [...] by allowing so many villains, specifically saying, [...] "Venom is one bad guy too many." [...] Roger Ebert, who gave Spider-Man 2 a glowing review, gave the sequel 2 out of 4 stars and thought Church never expressed how Sandman felt about his new powers, something Molina, as Doc Ock in Spider-Man 2, did [...] "with a vengeance"; he said the film was [...] "a mess," [...] with too many villains, subplots, romantic misunderstandings, conversations and [...] "street crowds looking {{high into the air}} and shouting 'oooh!' this way, then <b>swiveling</b> and shouting 'aaah!' that way." [...] The New Yorker's Anthony Lane, who gave Spider-Man 2 a favorable review, gave the film a negative review, characterizing the film as a [...] "shambles" [...] which [...] "makes the rules up as it goes along." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} played by Madonna {{as a part}} of the promotional campaigns for the Confessions on a Dance Floor album, in London's night clubs, {{including}} the Koko Club and G-A-Y. During the performances at the clubs, Madonna emerged from a glitter ball while wearing a purple jacket, velvet pedal pushers and knee-high boots. In the Confessions Tour, the song was the fourth performance of the evening and was part of the equine segment of the show. Madonna wore a skin-tight, full body black leotard. As the performance of [...] "Like a Virgin" [...] ended, Madonna sat on a platform and announced [...] "Ladies and Gentleman! Thank you for coming to our show. The night is young, and the show has just begun." [...] A huge assortment of steel rods and gymnastic equipment were planted on the stage. Madonna started singing the song, as her dancers started running around, displaying routines in parkour. Madonna climbs on blocks to sing the song as well as to strike poses. As the final chorus approached, Madonna went to the front of the stage and struck poses while holding on to the steel rods. The song continued with Madonna <b>swiveling</b> around the rods and the dancers continuing their routine. The performance ends with Madonna disappearing through the middle of the stage and her dancers doing a final vault before the lights are turned off. In the Sticky & Sweet Tour, [...] "Jump" [...] was sampled in the song [...] "Into the Groove" [...] during which Madonna performed stunts in the air.|$|E
500|$|Bedtime Stories {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics. J. Randy Taraborrelli, author of , praised the album for being [...] "considerably more tame in tone and image than [...] ethereal sounding, sexually explicit" [...] content. AllMusic critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine gave the album {{four out of}} five stars, claiming that it is a [...] "warm album" [...] and that it [...] "offers her most humane and open music". Jim Farber from Entertainment Weekly gave the album a positive review as well, giving it a B+ grade, and writing that [...] "the new tracks work less as individual songs than as a sustained mood" [...] and that Madonna [...] "still has something to reveal". Barbara O'Dair of Rolling Stone also gave the album a three-and-a-half stars out of five, writing that [...] "Madonna has come up with awfully compelling sounds". Billboard, while giving the album a positive review, commented that it [...] "sticks to a pop recipe that yields hits galore, with little excess baggage". In 2015, Billboard ranked it as Madonna's sixth best album; [...] "while not as hardcore as 1992's Erotica, Bedtime captured Madonna in transition, <b>swiveling</b> away from explicit sexuality and relying on R and balladry before she dove headfirst into dance music four years later. Songs like 'Human Nature', 'Secret' and 'I'd Rather Be Your Lover' proved more compelling than most of the New Jack music being released in the mid-90s, and 'Take a Bow' added a classic slow jam to Madge's canon". Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine gave Bedtime Stories a positive review and {{four out of five}} stars, writing that it is [...] "a fluffy-pillowed concept album that unfolds like a musical fairy tale".|$|E

Dick, an American {{representative from the}} Goodyear Zeppelin Company, recalled [...] "The only entrance to the smoking room, which was pressurized to prevent the admission of any leaking hydrogen, was via the bar, which had a <b>swiveling</b> air lock door, and all departing passengers were scrutinized by the bar steward {{to make sure they}} were not carrying out a lit cigarette or pipe." ...|$|E
2500|$|Goddard {{determined}} {{early that}} fins alone were {{not sufficient to}} stabilize the rocket in flight and keep it on the desired trajectory {{in the face of}} winds aloft and other [...] disturbing forces. He added movable vanes in the exhaust, controlled by a gyroscope, to control and steer his rocket. (The Germans used this technique in their V-2.) He also introduced the more efficient <b>swiveling</b> engine in several rockets, basically the method used to steer large liquid-propellant missiles and launchers today.|$|E
2500|$|The Tilt-A-Roll is a <b>swiveling</b> {{toilet paper}} {{dispenser}} invented by Curtis Batts in 1996, a Dallas-native industrial engineer. His patents on the invention, summarize its design as [...] "An adjustable angle coupling secures the yoke to the mounting assembly and permits {{rotation of the}} yoke about an axis directed orthogonally through the spindle such that the paper roll can be oriented to unroll paper either from over or from under the roll as desired." [...] An inventor named Rocky Hutson demonstrated a similar device he called the T.P. Swivel to the producers of the television program PitchMen in late 2009.|$|E
