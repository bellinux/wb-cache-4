On Saturday 24 February in 1990 Roman, armed with bucket and <b>secateurs</b> arrived, much to Mr. growers shock when he began picking, himself. Roman started at 6am and finished at 9 pm that evening; he picked half the entire vineyard himself and returned on Sunday the 25th to finish it off. This process was repeated in a Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon vineyard which formed the 3 single site wines produced in 1990. Crushing was performed by Roman using empty bottles to squash the fruit in a bucket, then transferred by that bucket, to one of the 3 small ex-dairy tanks bought -all bought for $100- a quick, non-temperature controlled wild-yeast fermentation ensued and the wines were pressed in a borrowed basket press and matured in 3 separate third-hand barrels. The vintage was finished in 11 days. Much to Roman’s delight the wines were superb and they sold out - paying for more buckets, 3 more barrels, and rent for a shed to house wines. The process was repeated the next year and the year after that. Clarendon Hills grew from the determination one man had to make wine ‘after work’ and ‘on the weekends’ of his 9-to-5. A local news paper even ran a story [...] "Tin shed wines take on the world", which made Roman cringe but slowly Clarendon Hills grew, it afforded more devices to make the process less labour-intensive and slowly grow his vineyard repertoire. In 1994 Roman left the Australian Government laboratories and devoted himself to Clarendon Hills 100%. The 1994 vintage saw Roman employ his first employee and rebranded his $30 Clarendon Hills Shiraz as 1994 Clarendon Hills Astralis. It was the first bottle in Australia to be priced at $100. It sold out. On Roman pressed for many years, making and selling the wines himself. Travelling the world over to show people the wines he made. This was the most logical avenue Roman considered, as he made the wines, who better to sell them?! The recipe was spot-on and he continues to show the wines himself.|$|E

40|$|The ‘Conseil Général du Département du Nord’ is {{the manager}} of 480 ha of Flemish dunes located at the far North of France. These spaces, {{initially}} preserved {{by the action of}} the ‘Communauté Urbaine de Dunkerque’ are now the property of the ‘Conservatoire de l’Espace Littoral et des Rivages Lacustres’. Characterised by an aelian dynamism and by the winter flooding of their damp depressions, these systems had represented a very high patrimonial richness before man, by these actions (the pumping of the aquifers, the parcelling out of dune massifs, the fixation of sand by plantations, the destruction of rabbits), reduced to nothing the natural expression of perturbations (storms, floods, important sandbanks) and made dune massifs become wastelands and low marshes and dry lawns disappear. The first step for preservation was the in extremis safeguard and the maintenance by <b>secateurs</b> (1989) then by motor scythes (1992) of micro-habitats with a high richness over a 2 ha total surface lost in very important pre-forested systems. Rapidly, the objectives of preservation obliged us to put into practice the restoration of natural environments by stripping and clearing the ground (1994 and 1997). But these operations of a large scale (10 ha) were always based on a ‘fixist’ and ‘museographical’ approach to the environment (the maintenance of a representative sample of habitats). The management which consists of stopping certain pioneer and post-pioneer stages of vegetation can in fact correspond to a counter-natural step as these dune systems make the proof of a very high dynamism and permanent evolution. Today the management of dune space is done by bulldozers: first the pre-forested vegetation is totally destructed (16 ha in 2004) leaving systems of bare sand freely evolving and accepting their spontaneous wastelanding over more than 50 % of their surfaces. The return to uncontrolled vegetal dynamism is only accepted if perturbations are periodically created in order to regularly produce the starting or reappearance conditions of the different series of vegetation. The last stage of our managing operations would consist, with a middle-term effect, in reducing the stability of the edging dune row and in favouring the development of wind passages with their devastation or saving effects on the dune we intend to preserve...|$|E

The experiment was arranged using a block design, consisting of 270 plant samples. The experiment consisted of three fynbos species, Coleonema album, Erica verticillata and Leucospermum cordifolium. Each species was subjected to three treatments, the control with no applications, liquid Kelpak® and Kelpak® Plantit® disks (hereafter referred to as disks). The control consisted of 10 plants samples, {{for each of the}} three species, arranged is numerical order 1 - 10. The liquid Kelpak® consisted of 40 plant samples. These 40 plants were divided into 4 groups, containing 10 plants and each group having a different treatment with group 1; 300 ml, group 2; 200 ml, group 3; 100 ml and group 4; 50 ml. The disks consisted of 40 plant samples. These 40 plants were divided into 4 groups, containing 10 plants each and each group having a different treatment with group 1, 2 disks, group 2, 1 disk, group 3, ½ disk and group 4 ¼ disk. The objectives of this study were to assess the desired application of Kelpak® by analysing the physiological improvements or growth responses on of Coleonema album, Erica verticillata and Leucospermum cordifolium. Prior to planting, pre-trial measurements were recorded of each individual cutting. A standard ruler was used to measure the root length and shoot length of each plant, measurements were taken in millimetres. The weight of each plant was measured with a Radwag AS 220 /C/ 2 analytical scale in grams. Plant growth, in terms of plant height was measured on a weekly basis. Plant height was measured with a standard ruler, from the surface of the medium to the tip of the tallest leaf. Watering during the trial period was conducted, using a hand held hose with a rosehead sprayer twice a week and during the third month of the trial once a week. Each container received an average of 250 ml of water. The final week of the trial final readings of the plants was conducted. Plants were carefully harvested and their roots were rinsed with tap water. A standard ruler was used to measure the root length and shoot length of each plant. The roots and shoots were then separated with a <b>secateurs</b> from each other. The fresh weight of each root and shoot weighed and recorded. The combined total weight in grams was captured. The roots and shoots were placed in a manila brown paper bag and placed in a laboratory oven at 55 °C for 48 hours. The plants were then removed from the oven and the dry weight of each root and shoot weighed. The combined total was also recorded. The results indicated that liquid Kelpak® and Kelpak® Plantit® disk had an effect on the growth of fynbos species at different application rates. Liquid Kelpak® and Kelpak® Plantit® disks had significantly increased the shoot, root growth and total weight of plants in C. album grown in 15 cm pots over an 18 week period. The liquid Kelpak® indicated higher growth rates in the initial growing stages of C. album as the liquid was immediately available to the plant. The Kelpak ® Plantit® disks had better influence on the growth over a longer period as the disk dissolved at a slower rate which eventually became available to the plant. The liquid Kelpak® and Kelpak® Plantit® disks had significantly increased the dry root weight and post-harvest root length of E. verticillata grown in 15 cm pots over a period. The Kelpak® Plantit® disks indicated higher growth rates in the dry root weight of E. verticillata but both the liquid and the disk had a positive effect on the post-harvest root length. The results also indicated that the successful rooting of E. verticillata was attributed to rooting hormone Seradix 2 under greenhouse heating environment. Liquid Kelpak® and Kelpak® Plantit® disks had significantly increased the wet and dry shoot weights, dry root weights and post-harvest wet and dry total plant weights of L. cordifolium grown in 15 cm pots over the growth period. The Kelpak® Plantit® disks indicated higher growth rates in the dry shoot weights of L. cordifolium but both the liquid and the disk had a significant effect on the wet shoot weight. The liquid and the disks were also responsible for the improved dry root weight. The liquid application indicated the best post-harvest wet weight but the disks improved the post-harvest dry weights. It can therefore be confirmed that organic seaweed concentrates such as Kelpak® is effective on the growth development of L. cordifolium...|$|E
