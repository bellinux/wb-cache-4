40|$|A {{survey of}} ware {{potatoes}} (a total of 1127 samples) from localities in Serbia during two consecutive years resulted in detection and identification of R. solanacearum in 17 tuber samples. The monitoring detected the causal agent of bacterial wilt and brown rot of potato in three districts of Vojvodina province. In 2011, the infection by R. solanacearum was confirmed in 7 samples of ware potato tubers (varieties – Saturna, Pirol, Hermes, Panda) in West Bačka and South Bačka Districts. In 2012, the infection by R. solanacearum was confirmed in 10 potato tuber samples (Lady Claire, Desiree, Panda, Red Fantasy and Vineta varieties) from two districts: South Bačka and Central Banat. Bacterial strains obtained from positive samples {{were identified as}} R. solanacearum biovar 2 using PCR/RFLP analysis, pathogenicity test on tomato transplants, and nutritional, enzymatic and biovar determination tests. To our best knowledge, these are the only findings of R. solanacearum infection in ware potatoes in Serbia. R. <b>solanacearum</b> was <b>not</b> <b>detected</b> in tomato or any other host plant tested in this study. Furthermore, the bacterium was not found {{in any of the}} water samples tested, including those originating from areas in which the bacterium was found in ware potato samples...|$|R
40|$|Extracellular {{polysaccharide}} (EPS) {{has long}} been {{regarded as one of}} the most important factors involved in wilting of plants by Pseudomonas solanacearum. By means of transposon Tn 5 mutagenesis, we have isolated a class of mutants that have an afluidal colony morphology but retain the ability to cause severe wilting and death of tobacco plants. One such mutant, KD 700, was studied in detail. By marker exchange mutagenesis, the altered colony morphology was shown to be the result of a single Tn 5 insertion in a 14. 3 -kilobase EcoRI fragment. This defect could be corrected by introducing a homologous clone from a cosmid library of the wild-type, parental strain K 60. The Tn 5 -containing fragment was introduced into other P. solanacearum wild-type strains by marker exchange, and these altered strains had the same afluidal phenotype as KD 700. N-Acetylgalactosamine (GalNac), the major constituent of EPS of all wild-type strains of P. <b>solanacearum,</b> was <b>not</b> <b>detected</b> by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of vascular fluids from wilting plants infected by KD 700. In contrast, GalNac was readily detected in similar fluids of plants infected by K 60. Polysaccharides extracted from culture filtrates of KD 700 contained approximately one-fifth of the GalNac present in polysaccharides from K 60. No differences in growth rates in culture or in planta between the mutant and the parental strains were observed. Since strains that are deficient in EPS production can remain highly virulent to tobacco, we conclude that EPS, or at least its GalNac-containing component, may not be required for disease development by P. solanacearum...|$|R

40|$|Fatty acid {{synthesis}} (FAS), {{a primary}} metabolic pathway, {{is essential for}} survival of bacteria. Ralstonia solanacearum, a β-proteobacteria member, causes a bacterial wilt affecting more than 200 plant species, including many economically important plants. However, thus far, the fatty acid biosynthesis pathway of R. <b>solanacearum</b> has <b>not</b> been well studied. In this study, we characterized two forms of 3 -keto-ACP synthase III, RsFabH and RsFabW, in R. solanacearum. RsFabH, the homologue of Escherichia coli FabH, encoded by the chromosomal RSc 1050 gene, catalyzes the condensation of acetyl-CoA with malonyl-ACP in the initiation steps of fatty acid biosynthesis in vitro. The RsfabH mutant lost de novo fatty acid synthetic ability, and grows in medium containing free fatty acids. RsFabW, a homologue of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA 3286, encoded by a megaplasmid gene, RSp 0194, condenses acyl-CoA (C 2 -CoA to C 10 -CoA) with malonyl-ACP to produce 3 -keto-acyl-ACP in vitro. Although the RsfabW mutant was viable, RsfabW was responsible for RsfabH mutant growth on medium containing free fatty acids. Our results also showed that RsFabW could condense acyl-ACP (C 4 -ACP to C 8 -ACP) with malonyl-ACP, to produce 3 -keto-acyl-ACP in vitro, which implies that RsFabW plays a special role in fatty acid synthesis of R. solanacearum. All of these data confirm that R. <b>solanacearum</b> <b>not</b> only utilizes acetyl-CoA, but also, utilizes medium-chain acyl-CoAs or acyl-ACPs as primers to initiate fatty acid synthesis...|$|R
