25|$|Gabriel Harvey {{was also}} {{critical}} of Kranich. In a marginal note in his copy of Georg Meier's In Iudaeorum Medicastrorum Calumnias (1570), he compared Kranich to the Queen's physician, Doctor Lopez, whom he termed 'none of the learnedest or expertest physicians in the court, {{but one that}} maketh as great account of himself as the best'. Harvey added: 'Doctor Burcot was in a manner such another; who <b>so</b> <b>bold</b> as blind Bayard?'.|$|E
25|$|For {{the most}} part the Chileans ignored these restrictions, preferring their {{domestic}} production to the oxidized and vinegary wines that didn't fare well during the long voyages from Spain. They were even <b>so</b> <b>bold</b> as to start exporting some of their wines to neighboring Peru with one such export shipment being captured at sea by the English privateer Francis Drake. When Spain heard of the event rather than being outraged at Drake, an indictment was sent back to Chile with the order to uproot most of their vineyards. This order, too, was mostly ignored.|$|E

25|$|With {{the close}} of Aurangzeb's (1707) reign began a period of disorder. The Marathas, who had incursions in south Gujarat for about half a century sent an {{expedition}} against Ahmedabad upon hearing death of Mughal emperor. Under the command of Balaji Vishwanath, the Marathas won over Mughal army in the Panch Mahals, plundered as far as Vatva within five miles of the city, and were only bought off by the payment of £21,000 (Rs. 2,10,000). In the city the next years were marked by riots and disturbance. In 1709 an order came from the new Mughal emperor Bahadur Shah I (1707-1712), that in the public prayers, among the attributes of the Khalif Ali, the Shia epithet wasi or heir should be introduced. This order caused great discontent among the Ahmedabad Sunnis. They warned the reader {{not to use the}} word wasi again, and, as he persisted in obeying orders, on the next occasion they dragged him from the pulpit and stabbed him to death. Three or four years later (1713-1714) another disturbance broke out, this time between the Hindus and Muslims. A Hindu insisting on burning the Holi near some Muslim houses, the Muslims retaliated by killing a cow. On this the Hindus seized a lad the son of a butcher and killed him. Then the Muslims especially the Afghans rose, sacked, and burned shops. They attacked a rich jeweller, Kapurchand, who defended his ward, pol, with matchlock men and killed several of the rioters. For three or four days work was at a standstill. Next year (1715) in the city the riots were renewed, shops were plundered and much mischief done, and outside (1716), the Kolis and Kathis grew <b>so</b> <b>bold</b> and presumptuous as {{to put a stop to}} trade.|$|E
500|$|Virtually {{from the}} beginning, McCay innovated with {{the forms of}} his chosen media. [...] He varied {{the size and shape}} of comic strip panels for {{dramatic}} effect, as in the second instalment of Little Nemo (October 22, 1905), where the panels grow to adapt to a growing forest of mushrooms. [...] Few of McCay's contemporaries were <b>so</b> <b>bold</b> with their page layouts. [...] Near-contemporary George Herriman with Krazy Kat was the most notable example, but it was not until a generation later that cartoonists such as Frank King with Gasoline Alley, Hal Foster [...] with Prince Valiant, and Roy Crane with Captain Easy attempted such daring designs on their Sunday pages.|$|E
500|$|He {{started the}} 1961–62 season behind Hill in the pecking order, only getting his place {{back in time}} for a 4–0 win over Chelsea after Hill picked up an injury. He made his 440th and final {{appearance}} in a Blackpool shirt in a 3–0 defeat at Arsenal on 7 October 1961. It was a fitting final bow as he always enjoyed playing against Arsenal, and he had [...] "so many wonderful memories" [...] at Highbury. With former teammate and close friend Jackie Mudie at Stoke City, and with Tony Waddington keen to welcome Matthews back to the Victoria Ground, his return to his home-town club was sealed. However Matthews was not impressed when the Blackpool board demanded a £3,500 transfer fee, with one director being <b>so</b> <b>bold</b> as to tell him [...] "You forget. As a player, we made you." [...] Having kept secret from Stoke a niggling knee injury Matthews had been carrying, Blackpool got their £3,500 for the player.|$|E

He won three races including the Great St. Wilfrid Stakes over six furlongs at Ripon and the Pearce Duff Stakes over seven furlongs at Ascot. He ended the year with a Timeform rating of 100.|$|R

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Pretty Girl Rock" [...] was {{directed}} by Joseph Kahn. Hilson told Kahn {{that she did not}} want the video to be about her, since she felt that the song was already very much about herself. During an interview with MTV News while on the set of the video, Hilson explained that in the video she does nine outfit changes because it will show [...] "10 different eras", starting from 1920 and up until 2010, in which she portrays herself. She also said, [...] " [...] way of paying homage to groundbreaking women, strong women who were fearless and <b>so</b> <b>bold</b> and so confident that they made women feel that way...And I hope to do the same." [...] Kahn wanted Hilson to pay homage to some female singers in the video. He discussed about it with Hilson, who chose the singers she loved and was inspired by as a youth to appear in the video. The completed video premiered on 106 & Park on November 11, 2010.|$|E
500|$|McClellan's first {{military}} operations were {{to occupy the}} area of western Virginia that wanted {{to remain in the}} Union and subsequently became the state of West Virginia. He had received intelligence reports on May 26 that the critical Baltimore and Ohio Railroad bridges in that portion of the state were being burned. As he quickly implemented plans to invade the region, he triggered his first serious political controversy by proclaiming to the citizens there that his forces had no intentions of interfering with personal property—including slaves. [...] "Notwithstanding all that has been said by the traitors to induce you to believe that our advent among you will be signalized by interference with your slaves, understand one thing clearly—not only will we abstain from all such interference but we will on the contrary with an iron hand, crush any attempted insurrection on their part." [...] He quickly realized that he had overstepped his bounds and apologized by letter to President Lincoln. The controversy was not that his proclamation was diametrically opposed to the administration's policy at the time, but that he was <b>so</b> <b>bold</b> in stepping beyond his strictly military role.|$|E
500|$|Critics also approvingly {{compared}} it to Mariah Carey's modern Christmas classic [...] "All I Want for Christmas Is You" [...] (1994), a track that RCA chief executive Peter Edge described as the song's inspiration. Williot added that [...] "Underneath the Tree" [...] is strong enough that it could enter the pantheon of modern Christmas staples like Carey's [...] "All I Want For Christmas Is You" [...] and 'N Sync's [...] "Merry Christmas, Happy Holidays". Jenna Hally Rubenstein of MTV News remarked, [...] "if we may be <b>so</b> <b>bold,</b> it is definitely on par with other impeccable Christmas originals—namely Carey's [...] "All I Want For Christmas Is You"." [...] Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine noted the similar themes of two songs, and that [...] "Underneath the Tree" [...] {{is likely to become}} Clarkson's very own contemporary standard. Melinda Newman of HitFix wrote, [...] "It's a finger-popping, bell-ringing pleaser that could achieve that rare feat of becoming a new Christmas standard. That hasn't happened since Carey's [...] "All I Want For Christmas" [...] in 1994;" [...] while The Independents Hugh Montgomery applauded it as having a sass, jingle and a sax solo, saying that it is [...] "a winner on all fronts." ...|$|E

500|$|Roberts {{described}} Joseph as an [...] "awkward {{and very}} bookish" [...] character, one who struggled {{to relate to}} his patients, {{in contrast to the}} [...] "happy-go-lucky Sam", which resulted in comedy as [...] "Sam is the antithesis of Joe." [...] He also deemed his character [...] "incredibly honest and morally upright", [...] "a total oddball with all sorts of hang-ups", and as being [...] "very stuck in his ways." [...] During his tenure, these aspects of his characterisation have each been explored. It was revealed in Joseph's first appearance that both his father and grandfather had been pioneering cardiothoracic Consultants, and that it had always been expected of him to follow the same path. [...] His residual guilt over his brother's attempted suicide was developed throughout his first few months at Holby City Hospital. Roberts commented on the event that: [...] "It underpins much of his behaviour. He is a man burdened by guilt and loss. I think I can be <b>so</b> <b>bold</b> as to say he transfers many of his feelings about his brother onto patients and staff alike, without ever betraying the source of his pain." [...] Joseph's resultant fastidiousness developed into OCD, something he attempted to control and hide by use of relaxant medication.|$|E
2500|$|In a later {{letter to}} the Byzantine emperor, Henry {{probably}} recalled these experiences when he wrote, [...] "A people called Welsh, <b>so</b> <b>bold</b> and ferocious that, when unarmed, they do not fear to encounter an armed force, being ready to shed their blood in defence of their country, and to sacrifice their lives for renown." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{contrast}} to {{the overwhelming majority of}} the Norwegian-American press, Gaa Paa maintained an anti-war orientation even after American entry into World War I in April 1917.

2500|$|The {{contents}} of the First Folio were compiled by Heminges and Condell; {{the members of the}} Stationers Company who published the book were the booksellers Edward Blount and the father/son team of William and Isaac Jaggard. William Jaggard has seemed an odd choice by the King's Men because he had published the questionable collection The Passionate Pilgrim as Shakespeare's, and in 1619 had printed new editions of 10 Shakespearean quartos to which he did not have clear rights, some with false dates and title pages (the False Folio affair). Indeed, his contemporary Thomas Heywood, whose poetry Jaggard had pirated and misattributed to Shakespeare, specifically reports that Shakespeare was [...] "much offended with M.

2500|$|The {{research}} paper [...] "Gentileschi, padre e figlia" [...] (1916) by Roberto Longhi, an important Italian critic, described Artemisia as [...] "the {{only woman in}} Italy who ever knew about painting, coloring, doughing, and other fundamentals". Longhi also wrote of Judith Slaying Holofernes: [...] "There are about fifty-seven works by Artemisia Gentileschi and 94% (forty-nine works) feature women as protagonists or equal to men". These include her works of Jael and Sisera, Judith and her Maidservant, and Esther. These characters intentionally lacked the stereotypical 'feminine' traits—sensitivity, timidness, and weakness—and were courageous, rebellious, and powerful personalities. A nineteenth-century personality commented on Artemisia's Magdalene stating, [...] "no one would have imagined {{that it was the}} work of a woman. The brush work was bold and certain, and {{there was no sign of}} timidness". In Ward Bissell's view, she was well aware of how women and female artists were viewed by men, therefore explaining why her works in the beginning of her career were <b>so</b> <b>bold</b> and defiant.|$|E
