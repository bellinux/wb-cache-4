50|$|There are {{different}} types of form tools. Insert form tools {{are the most common}} for short- to medium-range jobs (50 to 20,000 pcs). Circular form tools are usually for longer jobs, since the tool wear can be ground off the tool tip many times as the tool is rotated in its holder. There is also a <b>skiving</b> <b>tool</b> {{that can be used for}} light finishing cuts. Form tools can be made of cobalt steel, carbide, or high-speed steel. Carbide requires additional care because it is very brittle and will chip if chatter occurs.|$|E
50|$|For lines {{which use}} low speed welding processes, such as laser welding, the <b>skiving</b> <b>tools</b> cannot {{normally}} cut - for example at speeds below metal planing speeds or about 10 meters/minute (33 feet/minute). In these cases the tools can be vibrated at high frequency to artificially increase the relative speed between {{the tools and}} strip.|$|R
