50|$|Insert {{nuts are}} {{advantageous}} over <b>barrel</b> <b>nuts</b> and T-nuts, {{because they can}} be installed {{from one side of the}} workpiece.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>barrel</b> <b>nut</b> (also {{known as}} steel cross dowel or dowel nut) is a {{specialized}} nut, and {{is commonly used}} in aerospace and ready-to-assemble furniture applications.|$|R
50|$|Additional {{innovations}} {{developed by}} POF-USA include the integral bolt-carrier key with the interface behind the cam pin, oversized heat-sink <b>barrel</b> <b>nut,</b> roller cam pin, and regulating gas plug.|$|R
50|$|It {{is used to}} bolt {{thin sheet}} metal parts to larger, often billet or forged, parts. The <b>barrel</b> <b>nut</b> is a round slug, or formed sheet metal part with threads {{perpendicular}} {{to the length of}} the nut. The nut sits in a hole inside the forging and a standard bolt is threaded into the <b>barrel</b> <b>nut</b> from outside the sheet metal. They are preferred over a standard nut and bolt, because they do not require a flange to be machined or forged onto the receiving part, thus reducing weight.|$|R

5000|$|The Model 64 Savage {{has a full}} <b>floating</b> <b>barrel,</b> standard. It is {{considered}} by many users to be more accurate [...] "out of the box" [...] than some more expensive rifles.|$|R
25|$|The new barrier {{was formed}} by strong ropes {{supported}} by <b>floating</b> <b>barrels,</b> maintained in position by ship masts weighted at one end with millstones {{and with the other}} end protruding several meters from the sea surface.|$|R
50|$|The AS50 is {{designed}} for the British Armed Forces and United States Navy SEALs, the rifle is employed due to its high rate of fire (five rounds in 1.6 seconds). This high rate of fire is due mostly to the <b>floating</b> <b>barrel</b> and the lightweight titanium frame.|$|R
50|$|A sex bolt is a mating {{fastener}} combining {{a fastener}} (nut) with a fastener (screw). The sex bolt {{consists of a}} female (internally) threaded <b>barrel</b> (<b>nut)</b> and a male (externally) threaded screw. Both the barrel and screw have heads designed to clamp (bind) material between {{the head of the}} barrel {{and the head of the}} screw, or to bridge the gap between two parts.|$|R
50|$|There are {{intentional}} slamfire designs, mainly shotguns, {{that involve}} a free <b>floating</b> <b>barrel,</b> {{with a round}} inserted in the breech, and a tubular receiver with a fixed firing pin in the back. The barrel is inserted into the receiver and slammed backward, firing the round. There is no trigger or clockwork.|$|R
50|$|The <b>barrel</b> {{takedown}} <b>nut</b> {{tends to}} loosen during firing and may need hand-tightening to maintain both accuracy and reliability.|$|R
50|$|The CZ 2075 RAMI is a {{semi-automatic}} pistol made by Česká zbrojovka Uherský Brod (CZUB) in the Czech Republic. It {{features a}} staggered-column magazine, all-metal construction or optional Polyframe, and a hammer-forged <b>floating</b> <b>barrel.</b> The gun's name, RAMI, {{is derived from}} combining the first two letters of the designers' given names, Radek Hauerland and Milan Trkulja.|$|R

50|$|In 2010 the Danish Defence Materiel Service {{ordered an}} {{improved}} {{version of the}} M/96 and M/95 from Colt Canada under the Danish designation M/10, which Colt Canada designated the C8 IUR. It features a 401 mm <b>floating</b> <b>barrel,</b> fully ambidextrous controls, flip up iron sights, a collapsible buttstock with more positions, and the Integrated Upper Receiver (IUR).|$|R
50|$|The initial ACR {{design was}} {{offered in the}} Army's Individual Carbine competition. In late 2011, Remington {{unveiled}} an improved version specifically for the competition. Improvements included a magnesium lower receiver, A2-style pistol grip, collapsible but non-foldable stock, carbine length gas system, a new <b>barrel</b> <b>nut</b> (which eliminates the quick change barrel), and a folding charging handle. These changes made the weapon 1.8 lbs lighter. The Individual Carbine competition was cancelled before a winning weapon was chosen.|$|R
5000|$|Norinco of China {{manufactures}} an unlicensed {{copy of the}} Uzi Model B that is sold as the M320. Early versions {{were marked}} [...] "POLICE Model" [...] in English. Modifications were made to avoid the US Assault Weapon Import Ban: the folding stock was replaced with a wooden thumbhole stock, the <b>barrel</b> <b>nut</b> was welded in place, and the bayonet lug was removed. The gun had a gray parkerized finish, a 410-mm (16-inch) carbine-length barrel and is 800 mm (31.49 inches) overall.|$|R
50|$|The C11 rifle is a 5.56-millimetre calibre, heavy fully <b>floating</b> <b>barrel,</b> {{manually}} operated, bolt action, hand-fed, single-shot, competition {{weapon that}} fires 5.56 mm x 45 mm NATO ammunition. The round {{is identical to}} that which {{is used in the}} C7, C8 and the C9 and as such will have similar ballistics. It has no applied safety and is fitted with RPA Vernier scaled aperture sights.|$|R
5000|$|The rifle has an open rear {{sight and}} ramp front sight with high {{visibility}} orange post {{surrounded by a}} cutaway hood. The receiver has an integral [...]22 tip-off scope mounting rail. Swivel studs for a carrying strap are embedded in the synthetic stock.

Optional accessories from Marlin include 7 and 10-round nickel plated metal magazines. 25-round magazines are available.|$|R
50|$|The MAG's {{receiver}} {{is constructed}} from sheet metal stampings reinforced by steel plates and rivets. The front is reinforced {{to accept the}} <b>barrel</b> <b>nut</b> and gas cylinder which are permanently mounted. Guide rails that support the bolt assembly and piston extension during their reciprocating movement are riveted to the side plates. The bolt's guide rails are shaped downward to drive the locking lever into engagement with the locking shoulder, which is also riveted to the side plates. The rear of the receiver has been reinforced and slotted to accept the butt-stock.|$|R
50|$|Mating {{fasteners}} {{are known}} by many different names: sex bolt, binding posts, Chicago screws, interscrews, <b>barrel</b> bolts, <b>barrel</b> <b>nut,</b> partition screws, door closure bolts, furniture screws, panel fasteners, architectural sex bolts, arch series screws, hinge screws, display fasteners, screw nuts, connector bolts, threaded rivets, grommet nuts, post and screw sets, book screws, and stationary screws. Applications vary widely from book binding to installing bathroom partitions. This group of fasteners {{are used to}} assemble fitness apparatus, solar panels, playground equipment, railing systems, furniture, athletic helmets, knives, store fixtures, signs, panic bars, and many other products.|$|R
5000|$|In 2014, IWI {{launched}} the IWI DAN [...]338 sniper rifle. The rifle {{is designed for}} light weight and compact carry. The chassis is made of aluminum alloy, the heavy fluted free <b>floating</b> <b>barrel</b> is 737 mm (29″) long. The new rifle weighs 6.9 Kg (15.2 pounds) without magazine, ammo, telescope and mount. The IWI DAN is a bolt action sniper rifle chambered in the 0.338 Lapua Magnum, with effective range of 1200 meters and sub-MOA accuracy.|$|R
50|$|Porky {{puts out}} duck decoys. Daffy arrives and blends among them. Porky wears a decoy on his head, walks {{underwater}} {{and tries to}} shoot Daffy, but the gun shoots out water instead of bullets. Daffy then flies onto a <b>floating</b> <b>barrel</b> (labeled 'XXX' - a period designation for whiskey). Porky shoots the whiskey-filled barrel but Daffy escapes. Some fish are attracted to the leaking barrel and get drunk. The fish come onshore, commandeer a boat and drunkenly sing 'On Moonlight Bay'.|$|R
50|$|A sex bolt, (also {{known as}} a <b>barrel</b> <b>nut,</b> <b>barrel</b> bolt, Chicago screw, post and screw or {{connector}} bolt), {{is a type of}} fastener (nut) which has a barrel-shaped flange and protruding boss that is internally threaded. The boss sits within the components being fastened, the flange provides the bearing surface. The sex bolt and accompanying machine screw sit flush {{on either side of the}} surfaces being fastened. It is normally chosen because of its low profile compared to other nuts. The sex bolt often has a built-in feature, such as a slot, to aid in tightening the fastener. Some sex bolts, more commonly known as 'architectural bolts', have knurled barrels to allow one-sided assembly. 'Binding posts' are similar to architectural bolts in that they are designed to be assembled from one side, but they have teeth on the flanged surface to keep them fixed.|$|R
5|$|Broke drilled {{his crew}} to an {{extremely}} {{high standard of}} naval gunnery; he regularly had them fire at targets, such as <b>floating</b> <b>barrels.</b> Often these drills would be made into competitions to see which gun crew could hit the target and how fast they could do so. He even had his gun crews fire at targets 'blindfold' to good effect; they were only given the bearing to lay their gun on without being allowed to sight the gun on the target themselves. This constituted a very early example of 'director firing'.|$|R
50|$|The barrel for the Canadian C3A1 is a heavy, fully free <b>floating</b> <b>barrel</b> {{chambered}} for the 7.62×51mm NATO round. It has {{a weight}} of 2.04 kg/4.5 lbs and {{a length of}} 60 cm. Rifling follows a 1:12 turn ratio with 4 right hand twists. The action is a Mauser-style rotating bolt type. It has 3 stainless steel locking lugs at {{the front and rear}} of the bolt. The C3 safety is a thumb activated lever above the magazine which locks the trigger, bolt and sear giving ultimate protection against an accidental discharge.|$|R
2500|$|The {{slide of}} the [...]22 LR has an {{opening at the}} front that allows the buffer to be unused when firing the gun. Heckler & Koch {{provides}} a special scraper tool for the [...]22 LR-barrel. The tool is needed to clean {{the inside of the}} floating chamber for save operation. An additional exchange tool is provided for all calibers to screw and unscrew the <b>barrel</b> <b>nut</b> that attaches the barrel to the frame. Both tools can be seen in one of the pictures of the P7K3 on this page. P7K3's are more rare in the U.S. than in Europe and are valued at higher prices especially when they are in good condition.|$|R
2500|$|On {{her next}} {{transport}} voyage, Rijndam left New York on 15 June with , , , , , Italian steamer , and British steamer Vauban and {{met up with}} the Newport News portion of the convoy—which included , , , , and British troopship —the next morning and set out for France. The convoy was escorted by cruisers [...] and , and destroyers [...] and battleship [...] and several other destroyers joined in escort duties for the group for a time. The convoy had a false alarm when a <b>floating</b> <b>barrel</b> was mistaken for submarine, but otherwise uneventfully arrived at Brest {{on the afternoon of}} 27 June.|$|R
50|$|Although it cannot {{match the}} {{sustained}} {{rate of fire}} of an electric Gatling gun like the M61 Vulcan GAU, because it doesn't need to spool up, its initial rate of fire is higher. It requires no external power source to operate, but is instead powered by the recoiling of the <b>floating</b> <b>barrels,</b> somewhat like {{the action of the}} German MG-42. The Gast principle has been little used in the West, but was popular in the former Soviet Union on a variety of weapons. It is reported to be a very reliable, robust weapon easily maintained in the field.|$|R

At right, there are two large ships, one with two masts and one with three, and a dinghy is in the water nearby. Another ship {{with at least two}} masts is in the {{foreground}} at left, and there is also a dinghy near it. Two sailboats can be seen across the water, and yet another large ship is roundng the point. The image also depicts Yerba Buena, as that was then name of the city until 1847. There are ducks on the water, swimming near a <b>floating</b> <b>barrel...</b>|$|R
50|$|In 2008 or 2009, Colt Canada {{introduced}} {{a completely new}} designed upper receiver with integrated rail attachment system. The front handguard is in this system permanently attached to the upper receiver. The whole system is forged from one piece, and is sometimes called a monolithic rail. This system allows for a completely free <b>floating</b> <b>barrel.</b> Another unique feature is that the system can be adapted for different barrel lengths by screwing on an extension. The system was {{introduced a}}s an upgrade in the Dutch army with the C7 and C8 in 2009 and currently is introduced with the Danish Army.|$|R
