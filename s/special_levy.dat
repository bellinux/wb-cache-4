However, they were not as prosperous nor as educated as the Jews, since the Muslim elites had fled to North Africa, while the Jews, [...] who were literate speakers of Portuguese, had no other homeland. Most Muslims were workers in low-skilled, low-wage jobs and many were slaves of Christians. They had to display identifying symbols on their robes and pay extra taxes, and suffered {{the violence of the}} crowds. The deprecatory term saloio (countryman) came from a <b>special</b> <b>levy,</b> the salaio, [...] that the Muslims who cultivated gardens within the city limits had to pay. Likewise, the term alfacinha (little head of lettuce) came from the cultivation by the Moors of lettuce plants, then little consumed in the north.|$|E

50|$|The Australian Labor Party is {{the main}} {{beneficiary}} of trade union affiliation fees, <b>special</b> <b>levies</b> and donations. The Labor Party received $49.68 million from trade unions in 2004/05. Critics have accused the unions of buying seats at ALP state conferences. In 2001/02, money from trade unions amounted to 11.85% of the Labor Party's income.|$|R
50|$|It was at Shoreham {{where an}} {{approved}} Shoreham Nuclear Power Plant was later disapproved {{as the result}} of public protest. The builder, Long Island Lighting Company (LILCO), was partially reimbursed for money spent on construction. The municipal bonds that were floated to reimburse the builder are being paid off by a <b>special</b> <b>levy</b> on the electric bills of residents of Long Island. This was the last attempt to construct a nuclear power plant in the US.|$|E

In the <b>special</b> <b>levy</b> of 1552-3 made on all lay persons having an annual income of at least £40 from land or personal estate, Dame Anne St Leger of Annery was assessed at £402, the fourth greatest assessment in Devon behind only three branches of the great Courtenay family.|$|E

Occupiers of agricultural property receive a rate demand direct from the Commissioners. The [...] "rates" [...] on non-agricultural properties, such as houses and factories, are paid through a <b>special</b> <b>levy</b> issued to the district councils within the Commissioners' area. These councils, Fenland District Council http://www.fenland.gov.uk/, Huntingdonshire District Council http://www.huntsdc.gov.uk and the Borough Council of King's Lynn & West Norfolk http://www.west-norfolk.gov.uk are therefore, able to appoint representatives as Commissioners in respect of the payment made in relation to these properties.|$|E
50|$|Florentius {{is first}} heard of {{when he arrives}} in Gaul as a praetorian prefect of Constantius II in 357. He spoke in support of {{engaging}} the enemy as the battle of Strasbourg loomed. Later that year when revenue from Gaul did not reach desired levels from the poll-tax and the land-tax, he took measures to raise <b>special</b> <b>levies</b> {{to make up for}} the shortfall. However, Julian opposed the imposition of the extra burden on the people of Gaul and Constantius decided against the policy of his own prefect.|$|R

50|$|The {{primitive}} {{financial institutions}} of early England centred round the king's household. In other words, the royal preceded {{the national economy}} in importance. Revenue dues collected by the king's agents, rents, or rather returns of produce from land, and <b>special</b> <b>levies</b> for emergencies formed the main elements of the royal income which gradually acquired greater regularity and consistency. There is, however, little or no evidence of what modern governments recognise as financial organisation until the 11th century. The influence exercised from Normandy, which so powerfully affected the English rulers at this time, tended towards the creation of records of revenue claims {{as well as a}} central treasury.|$|R
50|$|The {{proposed}} legal code revision {{authorized by}} the previous session was accepted and enacted into law with only minor modifications. The pension for Charles Debrille Poston was also increased from the US$25/month {{authorized by the}} previous session to US$35/month. No action was taken upon the governor's recommendation to modify the territorial property tax. A twelve-year tax exemption for factories that processed sugar beets and a ten-year tax exemption to railroads that constructed at least 10 mi of new track annually were however granted. Preferring to update to replacement of the territorial prison, the session passed a <b>special</b> <b>levy</b> of 3.5¢ per $100 value over the governor's veto to fund prison renovations.|$|E
50|$|Hitler {{talked to}} Stennes and {{to groups of}} SA the next day, urging them to follow his leadership. He redefined the issue in {{different}} and simpler terms: Was the SA entirely loyal to Hitler under the Führerprinzip, or not? Then on the following day, he convened a meeting of some 2000 SA and announced he was personally taking over as Supreme Leader of the SA and SS (thus becoming Partei- und Oberster SA-Führer). The SA cheered and were delighted that their Leader was finally giving them the recognition they felt they deserved. Hitler also had Stennes read a declaration increasing SA funding. A <b>special</b> <b>levy</b> (20 pfennig) would be made on party dues to pay for it.|$|E
5000|$|... 1) Andrew Buchanan of Drumpellier, Tobacco Lord and Lord Provost of Glasgow (1740-42). After the Jacobite {{victory at}} the battle of Prestonpans (21 Sep 1745), John Hay, quarter-master of Prince Charles’ Jacobite Army, arrived at Glasgow 25 Sep 1745 with a letter {{demanding}} a loan of £15,000. Buchanan and five others were chosen to negotiate with Hay, and succeeded in obtaining a reduction to £5,500. On account of Buchanan’s zeal in raising new levies on behalf of the government, the Jacobites demanded in December 1745 a <b>special</b> <b>levy</b> of £500 from him. Despite threats of military execution, he replied [...] "they might plunder his house if they pleased, for he would not pay one farthing." ...|$|E
5000|$|Among {{the unique}} {{characteristics}} of the special assessment is one that makes a special assessment particularly onerous for ordinary citizens. A <b>special</b> assessment <b>levy</b> enjoys a legal benefit known as a [...] "presumption of validity." [...] This means that it is much harder and usually, much more expensive to appeal than the ad valorem property tax most citizens are familiar with. This happens because {{it is difficult for}} the ordinary citizen to recognize that an error in the special assessment procedure or methodology has occurred and the resources a taxpayer must use to fight a <b>special</b> assessment <b>levy</b> are more expansive and costly than resources to fight an improper ad valorem tax on their real estate.|$|R
50|$|For {{the monthly}} quotisation, a <b>special</b> tax <b>levied</b> {{to pay for}} defence against the Spaniards, Gillis Coignet's family was taxed at 2 guilders 10 stivers {{indicating}} that Gillis enjoyed affluent circumstances.

25|$|The {{sponsors}} of Greek temples usually belonged {{to one of}} two groups: on the one hand public sponsors, including the bodies and institutions that administrated important sanctuaries; on the other hand influential and affluent private sponsors, especially Hellenistic kings. The financial needs were covered by income from taxes or <b>special</b> <b>levies,</b> or by the sale of raw materials like silver. The collection of donations also occurred, especially for supra-regional sanctuaries like Delphi or Olympia. Hellenistic monarchs could appear as private donors in cities outside their immediate sphere of influence and sponsor public buildings, as exemplified by Antiochos IV, who ordered the rebuilding of the Olympieion at Athens. In such cases, the money came from the private treasury of the donor.|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} raise the money needed to pay the ransom, Grand Master Heinrich von Plauen needed to raise taxes. He called a council of representatives from Prussian cities to approve a <b>special</b> <b>levy.</b> Danzig (Gdańsk) and Thorn (Toruń) revolted against the new tax, but were subdued. The Knights also confiscated church silver and gold and {{borrowed}} heavily abroad. The first two installments were paid in full and on time. However, further payments were difficult to collect as the Knights emptied their treasury trying to rebuild their castles and army, which heavily relied on paid mercenaries. They also sent expensive gifts to the Pope and Sigismund of Hungary to ensure their continued support to the Teutonic cause. Tax records indicated that harvest was modest in those years and that many communities fell three years behind their taxes.|$|E

50|$|Subscribers paid {{an annual}} rental, which covered {{switching}} fees and operator costs. Landowners paid a tax levy on phone lines running through their property, which covered repairing and building lines. The levy {{was based on}} the quarters of land through which telephone lines ran. There were two rates. A quarter of land which had a line passing through it paid a 'straight' rate, and a quarter of land in which someone lived and had a phone paid a higher 'take-off' rate. Since the 'straight' rate levy was charged regardless of whether the owner had phone service, land owners without phones could be paying as much or more as land owners with phone service. In spite of attempts to reform this system, it remained in place until the government took over the service. In addition to the annual rental and line levy, there was a <b>special</b> <b>levy</b> to pay back the debenture.|$|E

40|$|World {{deepwater}} {{is famous}} for its rich oil and gas reserves, and has become an important source of global oil and gas supply, with a rising investment which will be over the shallow water counterparts in the next few years, as well as an expansion of oil and gas output. The ‘Deepwater Golden Triangle’ of the North American Gulf of Mexico, Brazil and West Africa has been leading the most exploration, development and investment activities in the world, and their experience on fiscal system during different development stages has great reference value other than advanced technologies. Under the assumptions of uncertain oil price and producing cost, this paper analyzed China fiscal system for deepwater oil and gas development, modeled the free natural resource tax, uplifting the threshold of <b>special</b> oil <b>levy,</b> and other scenarios, and compared their results on contractor’s net presented value, internal return rate and present index. Based on net present value, internal return rate, profitability index, as well as the domestic fiscal policies, this paper found that <b>Special</b> Oil <b>Levy</b> levied only on profit oil and the cancel of government share oil would have the most significant incentives, while lower the income tax rate to 15 %, raising the threshold price at which the <b>Special</b> Oil <b>Levy</b> payable by 15 $/bbl and zero Value-added tax have much higher feasibility...|$|R
50|$|A {{requirement}} that the American flag be raised over schools was implemented. Any school district containing at least 100 residents were granted authority to hire music and art teachers. A <b>special</b> <b>levy</b> was passed to provide funds to expand the Tempe Normal School. A territorial board of health was created. Licensing requirements for dentists and physicians were enacted. A bill repealing the {{requirement that}} outstanding tax assessments be paid before a court appeal could be filed suffered a pocket veto. A 50-year, $100,000 loan to the territorial insane asylum was authorized to allow the facility to make needed improvements. Improvements were intended to allow the facility to have enough space to separate patients suffering from different types of problems into different areas. The session also transferred handling of incorporation filing fees from the Territorial Secretary {{to the office of}} the territorial auditor. The change resulted in the filing fees going directly into the territorial treasury.|$|E
5000|$|To {{save the}} steel industry, the State had to {{strengthen}} its intervention. Through tax reductions and investment aids, it supported the restructuring and modernisation effort. However, the State's financial aid increasingly took {{on the characteristics of}} direct subsidies. This attracted the attention of the European Commission, which claimed that the state aid to the steel industry was incompatible with the competition rules of the Common Market. The Luxembourgish government defended itself by stating that the national aid was less than that in neighbouring countries. The government was also aware that in order to reduce production costs, they had to try to slow the evolution of the [...] "sliding-scale" [...] of salaries. However, every attempt to limit the extent of the index provoked outrage amongst the trade unions within the Tripartite. Nevertheless, the law of 8 April 1982 restricted the automatic indexation of salaries and limited the impact and frequency of index adjustments. In addition, it introduced a <b>special</b> <b>levy,</b> named the national investment contribution, of 5%.|$|E
50|$|From {{the early}} 20th century on, {{particularly}} in the 1970s, numerous schemes were proposed for development of Albany Hill, from dynamiting it for bay fill to building high-rise hotels or blasting out the top as a reservoir. Protest by local residents defeated most of these. Eventually the city retained an environmental consultant to prepare an Environmental Impact Report on alternative development schemes and development densities. After a series of public hearings the consultant's recommendation design was chosen leading to the present development pattern of clustered high-rise residential use and preservation {{of the majority of}} the hill. In 1996, citizens voted in an advisory measure to buy the open land, and in 1998 they passed Measure R. a <b>special</b> <b>levy</b> including $3 million to buy land on the hill. In 2008, the remaining open space hill was declared a Priority Conservation Area by Bay Area and state agencies. However, as of 2011 the money remained largely unspent, and the city has never rezoned the land, which remains designated for high-rise apartments in its plans.|$|E

25|$|Iowa imposes {{taxes on}} net state income of individuals, estates, and trusts. There are nine income tax brackets, ranging from 0.36% to 8.98%, {{as well as}} four {{corporate}} income tax brackets ranging from 6-12%, giving Iowa the country's highest marginal corporate tax rate. The state sales tax rate is 6%, with non-prepared food having no tax. Iowa has one local option sales tax that may be imposed by counties after an election. Property tax is levied on the taxable value of real property. Iowa has more than 2,000 taxing authorities. Most property is taxed {{by more than one}} taxing authority.

5000|$|Some argue {{this tax}} has aided the ever-widening {{gap between the}} living {{standards}} {{of the rich and}} poor. Such arguments tell only part of the story. The argument may be appropriate for improperly levied special assessments, but appropriately levied special assessments require that the property owner benefit by a measurable increase in the property's market value. (See reference 1). The amount of tax is limited by that [...] "measurable" [...] increase in value. Also, as a general principle, most taxing legislation recognize the limited financial resources of the elderly, the handicapped and the disabled. Exemptions and deferments from the <b>special</b> <b>levy</b> have been created within some legislation. Arguments against the tax based upon living standards may not recognize the importance of providing clean drinking water or sewer services to land owners. Finally, such arguments may not fully consider the benefit to people, animals and plants in the ecosystem protected by a public improvement such as sewage treatment infrastructure. Poorly drafted tax legislation may very well create inappropriate burdens on a taxpayer and be viewed with disdain.|$|E
40|$|Several two-boundary {{problems}} are solved for a <b>special</b> <b>Lévy</b> process: the Poisson process with an exponential component. The jumps {{of this process}} are controlled by a homogeneous Poisson process, the positive jump size distribution is arbitrary, while {{the distribution of the}} negative jumps is exponential. Closed form expressions are obtained for the integral transforms of the joint distribution of the first exit time from an interval and the value of the overshoot through boundaries at the first exit time. Also the joint distribution of the first entry time into the interval and the value of the process at this time instant are determined in terms of integral transforms. Comment: 10 page...|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} a reflected Lévy process without negative jumps, {{starting at the}} origin. When the reflected process first upcrosses level K, a timer is activated. After D time units, the timer expires and the Lévy exponent of the Lévy process is changed. As soon as the process hits zero again, the Lévy exponent reverses to the original function. If the process has reached the origin before the timer expires then the Lévy exponent does not change. Using martingale techniques, we analyze the steady-state distribution of the resulting process, reflected at the origin. We {{pay special attention to}} the cases of deterministic and exponential timers, and to the following three <b>special</b> <b>Lévy</b> processes: (i) a compound Poisson process plus negative drift (corresponding to an M/G/ 1 queue), (ii) Brownian motion, and (iii) a Lévy process that is a subordinator until the timer expires. © Applied Probability Trust 2008...|$|E
