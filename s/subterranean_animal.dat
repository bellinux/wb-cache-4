40|$|We {{demonstrated}} that a subterranean, visually blind mammal has a functional {{set of three}} Per genes that are important components of the circadian clockwork in mammals. The mole rat superspecies Spalax ehrenbergi is a blind <b>subterranean</b> <b>animal</b> that lives its entire life underground in darkness. It has degenerated eyes, but the retina and highly hypertrophic harderian gland are involved in photoperiodic perception. All three Per genes oscillate with a periodicity of 24 h in the suprachiasmatic nuclei, eye, and harderian gland and are expressed in peripheral organs. This oscillation is maintained under constant conditions. The light inducibility of sPer 1 and sPer 2, which are similar in structure {{to those of other}} mammals, indicates the role of these genes in clock resetting. However, sPer 3 is unique in mammals and has two truncated isoforms, and its expressional analysis leaves its function unresolved. Per's expression analysis in the harderian gland suggests an important participation of this organ in the stabilization and resetting mechanism of the central pacemaker in the suprachiasmatic nuclei and in unique adaptation to life underground...|$|E
40|$|From the biogeographic and biospeleological {{points of}} view, the {{subterranean}} fauna of Sardinia {{is one of}} the most interesting in the Mediterranean area: very rich in taxa, mostly endemic and highly specialised, it is apparently well known and currently investigated. Nevertheless, the amount of unexpected discoveries is still increasing every year. In the present thesis, at first, owing to the general low interest of the public for the protection of invertebrate endemic, troglobitic organisms, we have selected among the endemic vertebrate species protected by European, national and regional laws, those that should be helpful - as “Umbrella Species” – for the conservation of this very important natural heritage. The choice of the genus Speleomantes (Amphibia, Plethodontidae) showed how many endemic organisms could be protected with the conservation of the karst areas where these Amphibians are present (in particular, in Sulcis-Iglesiente and Nuorese areas). The second phase consisted in the study of larval morphology and natural history of some species of troglobitic beetles. Their larvae, in fact, seem to be much more vulnerable than adults to the anthropogenic impact in caves. Finally, the yearly temperature variations in Bue Marino cave (Dorgali, Eastern Sardinia), the most visited show cave in Sardinia, have been monitored with the aim of increasing our knowledge of the touristic impact on <b>subterranean</b> <b>animal</b> species.

They then underwent another major diversification into North American and European forms 40-56 million years ago. Finally the African and South American forms split around 40 million years ago. This suggests that worm-lizards crossed the Atlantic Ocean (which had fully formed by 100 million years ago) twice, once just after the K-Pg extinction, and then again, later in the Palaeogene.

40|$|International audienceThe {{principal}} {{aim of this}} work was to explore {{the responses of the}} groundwater crustacean Niphargus rhenorhodanensis to oxidative stress caused by short- and long-term drastic variations in oxygen level. To this end, we investigated thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) levels and anti-oxidative enzyme (SOD and GPx) activities during 24 h anoxia and post-anoxia recovery, and during 10 days of severe hypoxia and post-hypoxia recovery. We observed a decrease in TBARS amounts during recovery from severe hypoxia. Parallel to these results, we observed an overactivation of SOD activity after a 24 h anoxic stress. GPx activity measured at the end of anoxia or severe hypoxia and {{in the early hours of}} post-stress recovery also showed an overactivation compared to the control group. We can hypothesize that this overproduction of GPx corresponded to an anticipatory mechanism coping with the overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) during the recovery phase in <b>subterranean</b> <b>animals.</b> This response could be considered as a major asset for life in alternately normoxic and hypoxic conditions, and therefore in extreme biotopes such as groundwaters...|$|R
40|$|<b>Subterranean</b> <b>animals</b> have {{commonly}} evolved hypoactivity, hypometabolism {{and/or the}} sequential use of energetic reserves to tolerate long fasting periods {{imposed by the}} low food levels found in subterranean environments. However, some tropical caves are characterized by a potential high level of nutriments. By using the tropical fish Astyanax fasciatus that presents both populations subterranean (Astyanax fasciatus mexicanus) and epigean (Astyanax fasciatus fasciatus) populations, we described behavioral, metabolic and biochemical responses during a long-term fasting period followed by a refeeding period. The results demonstrated that fed hypogean fishes exhibited different energy stores together with a hypometabolism. But, despite drastic decreases in locomotory activity and oxygen consumption during fasting, hypogean fishes consumed significantly more glycogen, triglycerides and proteins during the starvation period than epigean fishes. This lower fasting capacity showed by hypogean fishes is confirmed by the higher activation of the compensatory metabolic pathways (ketogenesis and gluconeogenesis). After the refeeding period, cave fishes did not recover from the “food deprivation” stress, and resume fed levels in glycogen, triglyceride reserves and proteins, in contrast to epigean ones. This study thus demonstrates that starvation adaptations are not necessary for cave life, but are rather correlated to the “energetic state” of each ecosystem, and that troglomorphism is not linked to starvation capacities and thus not to the impoverished food availability...|$|R
40|$|A {{recent study}} in BMC Evolutionary Biology has reconstructed the {{molecular}} phylogeny {{of a large}} Mediterranean cave-dwelling beetle clade, revealing an ancient origin and strong geographic structuring. It seems likely that diversification of this clade in the Oligocene was seeded by an ancestor already adapted to subterranean life. Cave organisms have long been considered a model system for testing evolutionary and biogeographic hypotheses because of their isolation, simplicity of community structure and specialization. Adaptation to cave environments promotes the regression of functionless (unused) characters across a broad taxonomic range, in concert with evolutionary change in other morphological traits. Change typically involves the degeneration of eyes and loss of pigments, {{while at the same}} time appendices become elongated, intensification of sensory organs occurs, and life cycles become modified-a syndrome known as troglomorphy [1]. Modes of speciation and explanations for the geographic distributions of <b>subterranean</b> <b>animals</b> have both been debated (see for example [2, 3]). Extrinsic environmental factors causing extinction of surface ancestors pre-adapted to the subterranean (such as glaciations or aridification) are suggested to be a mechanism forcing populations underground. This model is usually invoked in limestone cave systems of continental temperate regions. However, among tropical faunas, in which surface (epigean) taxa are often found co-occurring with subterranean sister taxa, active colonization of the subterranean habitat is suggested as a more plausibl...|$|R
40|$|The {{evolution}} of <b>subterranean</b> <b>animals</b> following multiple colonisation events {{from the surface}} has been well documented, but few studies have investigated the potential for species diversification within cavernicolous habitats. Isolated calcrete(carbonate) aquifers in central Western Australia {{have been shown to}} contain diverse assemblages of aquatic subterranean invertebrate species (stygofauna) and to offer a unique model system for exploring the mechanisms of speciation in subterranean ecosystems. In this paper, we investigated the hypothesis that microallopatric speciation processes (fragmentation and isolation by distance (IBD)) occur within calcretes using a comparative phylogeographic study of three stygobiontic diving beetle species, one amphipod species and a lineage of isopods. Specimens were sequenced for the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase 1 gene from three main sites: Quandong Well, Shady Well (SW) and Mt. Windarra (MW), spanning a 15 km region of the Laverton Downs Calcrete. Phylogenetic and haplotype network analyses revealed that each species possessed a single divergent clade of haplotypes that were present only at the southern MW site, despite the existence of other haplotypes at MWthat were shared with SW. IBD between MW and SW was evident, but the common phylogeographic pattern most likely resulted from fragmentation, possibly by a salt lake adjacent to MW. These findings suggest that microallopatric speciation within calcretes may be a significant diversifying force, although the proportion of stygofauna species that may have resulted from in situ speciation in this system remains to be determined.

40|$|Circadian rhythms are {{biological}} rhythms {{that are}} evident in virtually all eukaryotic organisms. Mammals synchronize their behavioral and physiological circadian rhythms to environmental cues such as the light:dark (L:D) cycle. This allows mammals to anticipate and prepare for predictable environmental events such as night, winter, or reproductive function in potential mates. There have been few studies of circadian rhythms in <b>subterranean</b> <b>animals,</b> which are infrequently exposed to light and experience minimal day:night differences. Naked mole-rats are a fossorial and eusocial species that live in hot and arid parts of Africa. They live in colonies averaging 70 animals and maintain integrity of the colony {{with the presence of}} a social caste system, which includes few reproductive individuals, defenders, workers, and foragers. This animal would be a model for the study of circadian rhythms in a subterranean species as well as a highly social animal. This thesis presents a group of experiments that demonstrate the existence of a functional circadian system in the naked mole-rat. We demonstrated that approximately 66 % of the mole-rats studied exhibit robust circadian rhythms of locomotor activity, metabolic rate, and body temperature, all of which are highly correlated. These behavioral and physiological rhythms have the ability to entrain to varying L:D cycles and freerun in constant darkness (DD). We also demonstrated the presence of the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus (SCN), the nucleus found to be the location of the endogenous rhythm generator. This was demonstrated using a retina neuronal tracing method. We observed direct innervation of retinal fibers in the SCN. Therefore, in its entirety, this study has made a critical contribution to the biological rhythm literature with information on the functional capacity of the circadian system in a subterranean species that is rarely exposed to light and that is highly social. It also provides a thorough investigation of the circadian system of a fossorial mammal {{that can be used for}} comparative studies with other fossorial and above ground rodents. ...|$|R

40|$|After the {{disastrous}} floods in 1953 in the Netherlands, measures {{are taken to}} improve the safety in the Netherlands. In the Southwest of the Netherlands a couple of tidal basins are closed by the construction of dams and storm surge barriers. The closure of tidal basins shortens the coastal length and {{can result in a}} cost reduction comparing with heightening of dikes. The Eastern Scheldt storm surge barrier {{is one of the most}} well-known storm surge barriers. In view of the expected sea level rise the Deltacommission 2008 stated that the barrier cannot operate safely at a sea level rise of more than 1, 0 m and preferably, therefore, has to be removed. Furthermore the barrier causes sand hunger whereby large parts of the sandbars will ultimately disappear under water. This will affect <b>subterranean</b> <b>animals</b> and birds which are dependent on the sandbars. When the barrier will be removed these consequences can (largely) be prevented. In this study the best decision alternative for the safety of the Eastern Scheldt is investigated in view of costs and flood risk. This is done by defining two alternatives: (1) maintaining the Eastern Scheldt storm surge barrier and (2) removing the Eastern Scheldt storm surge barrier. In the analysis 3 scenarios of sea level rise are regarded: the current sea level, a sea level rise of 0, 5 m and a sea level rise of 1, 0 m. The consequences of the alternatives, such as the required dike reinforcement (heightening and widening) and reinforcements on the barrier, are determined and a cost-benefit analysis is made. It turns out that, if the current safety standard is satisfied, maintaining the barrier is a lot cheaper than removing the barrier. This is partly due to the magnitude of the costs for the removal of the barrier. When the safety is based on the values to be protected around the Eastern Scheldt, it turns out that the optimum flooding probability is 1 / 500 per year. The required dike height can be lower in that case, but still maintaining the barrier is cheaper. Coastal EngineeringHydraulic EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R

40|$|International audienceAbstractEnergized {{electron}} {{flows through}} biological systems sustain nature’s complexity. They drive bacterial, archaeal, and fungal oxidation–reduction processes and enable to introduce CO 2 and N 2 from the atmospheric pool. Electron flux-based food webs convert {{soil organic matter}} (SOM) in virgin forest and permafrost soils, over-fertilized agricultural land, grassland systems, compost/wastewater treatment plants, oceans, rain forests, savannahs, and forests of the temperate climate zones, and have their strategy adapted on the system {{in which they are}} active. Thus, the electron driving power is responsible in our industrializing world that carbon and nitrogen returns to the atmosphere presently with an annual N 2 O-N proportion of 0. 5 to 4. 2 terragrams (Tg) or an annual atmospheric N 2 O-N increase of 0. 25  %. N 2 O is a 300 -times more potent greenhouse gas than CO 2. Nature’s water-soluble soil carbon (CH 2 O) /NO 3 − ratio balancing is seen as a model of how N 2 O emissions could be kept in a tolerable range. Sub strategies beyond are (a) an annual 400 – 800  terragrams (Tg) photosynthate-C (90 – 95  % sugars) release into plant rhizospheres, (b) spot-wise N enriching animal excrement and wide C/N ratio litter fall distributions, (c) viral shunts or life shortcuts to supporting O 2 consuming, N supplying, and denitrifying recycler communities, (d) subterranean organic–inorganic soil components mixing and O 2 diffusion promoting NO 3 − formation, and (e) the release of nitrification inhibiting compounds as neem, karanjin, or specific humic acids which help in controlling nitrate formation and denitrification. Soil microbial transport vehicles are fungal hyphae, plant roots, and <b>subterranean</b> <b>animals.</b> Through their activities, aerobic–anaerobic gradients in the soil crumb mosaics emerge. Plant root intertissue spaces, animal guts, and co-transported soil crumbs where under carbon-dominated CH 2 O/NO 3 − ratios preferred microbes reside are mobile locations in well-aerated soils. In such reduction-equivalent surplus environments, denitrifying communities are forced to use during anaerobic respiration available nitrate-, nitrite ions, NO, and N 2 O economically. Though at carbon-dominated CH 2 O/NO 3 − ratios more N 2 O is reduced to N 2 than in nitrate surplus environments, a complete prevention of N 2 O emissions is not a reality and even not desirable from the climate point of view. After describing N 2 O formation and emissions from a compost pile, a municipal wastewater treatment plant, a constructed wetland, and mineral N-fertilizer, sewage sludge or nitrification inhibitor-stabilized N-fertilizer amended soils with their aerobic-anaerobic mosaics, this review tries to deduce exercisable CN (CH 2 O/NO 3) ratio shaping and N 2 O emission lowering strategies for ecologists, agriculturists, and waste managers in our industrializing world...|$|R
40|$|Distinctive Mima mound topography, {{found on}} all continents except Antarctica, has long {{inspired}} intense interest, {{both because of}} the uncertainty surrounding its origin, {{as well as the}} rich biodiversity often found in the adjacent depressional vernal pool wetlands. Emerging from the array of explanations proposed, a biological mechanism for mound formation has steadily gained strength. According to this model, <b>subterranean</b> <b>animals</b> such as pocket gophers build the small hillocks as a response to changes in soil thickness and permeability caused by pedogenesis (soil formation). However, the precise mechanics of the hypothesis [...] how soil weathering leads to changes in gopher soil movement and how the modified soil movement leads to the widespread Mima mound features [...] are not understood. To address this issue, this thesis presents three related efforts to document and explain Mima mound morphology and to elucidate the linkages between soil formation processes, mound form and distribution, and biotic sediment transport. The research targets the effects of pedogenesis by focusing on a set of alluvial terraces in the San Joaquin Valley of California, a chronosequence which ranges in age from a few thousand to a few million years old. In the first portion of the study, I designed a custom algorithm which automatically identifies Mima mounds from LIDAR (light detection and ranging) data in order to analyze the morphology and spatial patterns of the microtopography across the soil age gradient. I demonstrate that mound size changes systematically with soil age and with depth to a restrictive layer, consistent with the predictions of the biologic model. Further, I show that the nearly quarter-million mounds in the study are distributed in a highly regular pattern, on scales consistent with the home range of pocket gophers, adding further support to the proposal that gophers created the topography. In the second part of this dissertation, I developed a method to use radio frequency identification tags (as a proxy for soil particles) and periodic aboveground mapping of gopher soil movement to quantify gopher sediment transport vectors on each chronosequence surface. I found that gophers on Mima mounds move soil uphill and towards the center of mounds, and I show that this moundward tendency increases with soil age and the environmental pressure caused by soil formation over long time periods. Third, I combined the morphometric measurements with the the sediment transport data from the first two parts of the study and developed a sediment transport model which estimates mound erosion and swale deposition rates. If the Mima mounds are steady-state landscape features, erosion must be balanced by a restorative upslope transport. I show that the erosion rates estimated for this study are largely counteracted by the observed rates of sediment mounding via pocket gopher burrowing, supporting the notion that bioturbation plays a dominant role in maintaining Mima mound terrain. Finally, I use LIDAR measurements and results from published gopher physiology research to develop a model that approximates the energy required for the formation of Mima mounds (shearing, pushing, and uplifting soil) and their maintenance (counteractions to erosion). This energy estimate was compared to estimates of energy available to gopher populations in the region. The results indicate that gophers have ample energy to build typical Mima mounds in as little as 100 years, thus strongly supporting a biotic mechanism of Mima mound development and maintenance...|$|R
40|$|<b>Subterranean</b> living <b>animals</b> must handle {{orientation}} in their habitat with limited cues, among which is light scarcity. Zambian mole-rats {{belong to the}} rodent genus Fukomys and spend {{the majority of their}} lifetime underground in extensive burrow systems. These mole-rats have generally been considered as functionally blind, but recent morphological findings have suggested that their visual capabilities must have been underestimated. The odds of cue scarcity underground have also apparently led to the use of a sensory system for orientation quite uncommon in mammals: magnetoreception. This thesis deals with new findings on both the visual and the magnetic sense in small Zambian mole-rat species of the Genus Fukomys – two senses coupled to the minuscule, inconspicuous eye. While the retina provides the basis for light perception, the cornea is probably the site where magnetic perception takes place. Firstly, I show in part A that the formerly thought ‘blind’ Fukomys mole-rats can distinguish between light and dark even until at least a light intensity of 0. 6 -mol photons m− 2 s − 1 × × (approximately 33 lux). This thesis has also undergone the first approach to measure wavelength propagation in a tunnel, showing that long wavelengths (600 - 700 nm) travel, as expected, furthest in a horizontal tunnel, and that photons in this spectral range can still be detected, though at a very low (scotopic) level, at 70 cm apart from a tunnel opening illuminated with a light intensity resembling that on a clear day. Secondly, in part B, I also show that the hitherto poorly understood transduction mechanism of the magnetic sense in mole-rats is based on magnetite rather than on biochemical processes. The site of the respective magnetite-harbouring receptors can be confined to the ocular region, more specifically the cornea, where ferrous inclusions with magnetic properties might be coupled with the receptors for mediating magnetic information. The magnetic sense is not lateralised. This thesis also contributes to a further understanding of the neuronal processing of magnetic information in mammals, finding that hippocampal structures, e. g. structures coordinating spatial memories, are also involved in magnetic orientation. Magnetic cues might supply the animal with both directional compass and map information...|$|R

Results: Our study used previously sequenced genome or transcriptome data of two subterranean rodents, the blind mole rat and naked mole rat, and their terrestrial relatives, the mouse and guinea pig, to investigate the genetic basis of rodent subterranean adaptation. An analysis of 4996 orthologous genes revealed that the substitution pace of coding sequences was significantly slower in the blind mole rat than in the mouse, and slower in the naked mole rat than in the guinea pig. The dN/dS ratio was significantly higher in the blind mole rat than in the mouse and in the naked mole rat than in the guinea pig. These patterns are most likely related to the longer generation time and lower effective population size of subterranean rodents caused by subterranean ecological constraints. We also identified some genes and gene ontology (GO) categories that might be candidates for adaptation to subterranean life. Conclusions: Our study reveals a case of subterranean convergent evolution in rodents that is correlated with change in the pace and mode of molecular evolution observed at the genome scale. We believe that this genomic signature could have also evolved in other cases of subterranean convergence. Additionally, the genes that displayed the most radical changes in their patterns of evolution and their associated GO categories provide a strong basis for further comparative and functional studies, and potentially reveal molecular signatures of adaptation to subterranean life...|$|R
