So, the relative positions of {{points in a}} hs-periodic orbit become completely known {{as well as in}} which order those points are visited. No matter how a hs-periodic orbit emerges, be it through a period doubling cascade (s= 2 ^n) of the h-periodic orbit, or as a primary window (like the saddle-node bifurcation cascade with h= 2 ^n), or as a <b>secondary</b> <b>window</b> (the birth of a $s-$periodic window inside the h-periodic one). Certainly, period doubling cascade orbits are particular cases with h= 2 and s= 2 ^n. Both composition laws are also shown in algorithmic way for their easy use...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{adaptive}} Huffman coding with {{a window}} of limited distinct symbols is proposed. The window buffer is used to store a specified number of distinct symbols most recently processed. The total number of symbols within the window may vary, but number of distinct symbols does not exceed a specified value. The adaptive Huffman tree is constructed based on the probability distribution of symbols within the window. Then, {{a variant of the}} proposed method is introduced. The proposed variant uses two windows. A small primary window buffer is used to store the most recently processed symbols. A comparatively large <b>secondary</b> <b>window</b> buffer is used to store more past processed symbols. The two separate Huffman tree are constructed based on the probabilities of symbols within the two windows. A symbol is encoded using first Huffman tree if it is found in the first window. Otherwise, the symbol is encoded using second Huffman tree if it is found in the second window. The first proposed technique comparatively offers better results than its counterpart for most of the file type. The performance of the second proposed technique is also close to the other techniques...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: We {{have been}} {{examining}} a new sketching paradigm that allows direct free-hand creation of immersive graphics. Based on Apples QuickTime VR Technology it enables one to paint in a cylindrical panoramic space. To increase drawing speed we make extended {{use of the}} cylindrical geometry of the panoramic space, particularly {{the fact that a}} straight line on screen is a sinusoid on the flattened cylinder. We have added a <b>secondary</b> <b>window</b> to the QuickTime viewer to indicate the view angle and orientation, and various grids to help structure the space. Standard drawing functions such as colour pickers, shaped, straight and curved line drawing tools, flood fills, and cloning tools have all been implemented. In addition to these, brush controls have been added with parameterised opacity, hardness, size and spacing. The software handles a background read-only image plus an overlay (with alpha channel) containing new marks. There is also an undo buffer. To aid with the initial creation of an image, VRML models can be directly imported as wireframes. Many possible extensions of this application are discussed with the aim of opening up the digital panorama as a fully interactive VR experience...|$|E

40|$|Correction for downscatter in I- 123 SPECT can be {{performed}} by the subtraction of a secondary energy window from the main window, as in the triple-energy window method. This is potentially noise sensitive. For studies with limited amount of counts (e. g. dynamic studies), a broad subtraction window with identical width is preferred. This <b>secondary</b> <b>window</b> needs to be weighted with a factor higher than one, due to a broad backscatter peak from high-energy photons appearing at 172 keV. Spatial dependency and the numerical value of this weighting factor and the image contrast improvement of this correction were investigated in this study. Energy windows with a width of 32 keV were centered at 159 keV and 200 keV. The weighting factor was measured both with an I- 123 point source and in a dopamine transporter brain SPECT study in 10 human subjects (5 healthy subjects and 5 patients) by minimizing the background outside the head. Weighting factors ranged from 1. 11 to 1. 13 for the point source and from 1. 16 to 1. 18 for human subjects. Point source measurements revealed no position dependence. After correction, the measured specific binding ratio (image contrast) increased significantly for healthy subjects, typically by more than 20 %, while the background counts outside of all subjects were effectively removed. A weighting factor of 1. 1 – 1. 2 can be applied in clinical practice. This correction effectively removes downscatter and significantly improves image contrast inside the brain...|$|E
40|$|An {{interactive}} visualization tool, Visualizing Metra, {{was developed}} for Metra, Chicago’s regional commuter rail system, to support decision-makers in different departments requiring information about Metra’s stations, lines, ridership, land use, surrounding stations and connections to other transportation facilities. The application was developed as an intranet application in Macromedia Dreamweaver with a scalable base map with embedded links. The application allows the user to navigate visual, quantitative and text data. The strength of the application lies in its design. The design developed a template for each level in a spatial hierarchy providing a consistent approach to accessing information based on scale. Each level provides access to many different functions with common headers for navigation. The main frame has a GIS map of the station and surrounding suburbs. A zoom tools allows the user to see more or less detail. The secondary frames include track video and a slide show of the station area. The track video is accessible by clicking on the <b>secondary</b> <b>window</b> or on the video icon in the main window.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the shape of}} the windows through which stars may escape from a galaxy modeled by a bi–symmetrical potential made up of a two–dimensional harmonic oscillator with quartic perturbing terms.

Our main objective is to compute accurately these manifolds to analyze the shapes and sizes of the windows of escape, founding that they consist of a “main window” and of a hierarchy of <b>secondary</b> spiral <b>windows.</b> We have also found that the shape and the way this hierarchy is constructed depend on the energy of the system.

We then determine the conformal window with asymptotic safety from the complete next-to-next-to-leading order in perturbation theory. Limits for the conformal window arise due to fixed point mergers, the onset of strong coupling, or vacuum instability. A consistent picture is uncovered by comparing various levels of approximation. The theory remains perturbative in the entire conformal window, with vacuum stability dictating the tightest constraints.

40|$|In this paper, we {{analyze the}} {{coexistence}} {{of a primary}} and a secondary (cognitive) network when both networks use the IEEE 802. 11 based distributed coordination function for medium access control. Specifically, we consider the problem of channel capture by a secondary network that uses spectrum sensing to determine {{the availability of the}} channel, {{and its impact on the}} primary throughput. We integrate the notion of transmission slots in Bianchi's Markov model with the physical time slots, to derive the transmission probability of the secondary network as a function of its scan duration. This is used to obtain analytical expressions for the throughput achievable by the primary and secondary networks. Our analysis considers both saturated and unsaturated networks. By performing a numerical search, the secondary network parameters are selected to maximize its throughput for a given level of protection of the primary network throughput. The theoretical expressions are validated using extensive simulations carried out in the Network Simulator 2. Our results provide critical insights into the performance and robustness of different schemes for medium access by the secondary network. In particular, we find that the channel captures by the secondary network does not significantly impact the primary throughput, and that simply increasing the <b>secondary</b> contention <b>window</b> size is only marginally inferior to silent-period based methods in terms of its throughput performance.
