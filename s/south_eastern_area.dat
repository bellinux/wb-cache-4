25|$|The {{railways}} {{would not}} build across the western frontier without settlement {{as it would}} be too costly to provide train service across a barren wilderness. The Clifford Sifton immigration policy encourages settlers to arrive. Western settlement began and immigration encroached across the Manitoba and United States borders into the North West Territories which later became Saskatchewan. Immigration settlement to the last best west and the early highways began in the south east. The Federal Government survey crew reached this <b>south</b> <b>eastern</b> <b>area</b> of the District of Assiniboia, North West Territories in 1880. In 1881, the province of Manitoba expanded to its present boundaries and land could be purchased for $10.00 an acre. President Lincoln's U.S. Homestead Act was passed in 1862 and lands there were taken. In 1872, Canada passed the Dominion Lands Act attracting homesteaders to the West.|$|E

50|$|Hot desert climates (BWh) are {{typically}} found under the subtropical ridge {{where there is}} largely unbroken sunshine for the whole year due to the stable descending air and high pressure aloft. These areas are located between 30 degrees south and 30 degrees north latitude, under the subtropical latitudes called the horse latitudes. Hot desert climates are generally hot, sunny and dry year-round. They rise at a higher latitude in south-western United States in the sheltered regions warmed up in winters by the Pacific Ocean, enabling searing summer temperatures in the Death Valley basin at 36 degrees latitude. Hot desert climates also reach similar latitudes in the Middle East, North Africa and coastal <b>south</b> <b>eastern</b> <b>areas</b> of Spain.

40|$|From Preface: In 1966, the Karroo Development Association {{approached}} Rhodes University {{to undertake}} a socio-economic survey of their region.

Similar requests were also received from the Midlands Planning Association and the <b>South</b> <b>Eastern</b> <b>Areas</b> Development Association. When Rhodes University consulted the Department of Planning, which strongly supported the principle of a regional survey, it was decided that, although Port Elizabeth and its hinterland comprised a logical economic unit, the area should be sub-divided. The University of Port Elizabeth was entrusted with the responsibility for an analysis of the metropolitan area, while the Institute of Social and Economic Research of Rhodes University was commissioned {{to undertake a}} socio-economic survey of the inland areas. This thesis on the transport infrastructure of the Cape Midlands and Karroo Regions represents one aspect of the survey...|$|R

40|$|Since the 1960 s Irish {{fertility}} {{has undergone}} dramatic change. While the broad outlines {{of both the}} nature and the origins of such change are, by now, well enough known and understood, {{little attention has been}} paid to the way in which changes in age specific fertility have been manifested regionally. This paper uses cluster analysis to group counties and county boroughs/cities according to their age-specific profiles of fertility at each full census year between 1961 and 2002 and then ANOVA to identify meaningful statistical relationships between cluster membership in each year and variables descriptive of the demographic and socio-economic context. By 1981 younger fertility profiles had spread from <b>south</b> <b>eastern</b> <b>areas</b> to almost all regions, but during the 1980 s older fertility profiles became increasingly characteristic throughout western and northern districts. Despite the on-going, nation-wide ageing of fertility profiles since 1991, this basic regional distinction has remained largely intact. Prior to 1981 changing marriage patterns and family planning among older women seem to have underpinned profile change. Thereafter, however, profile change. patterns seem to have socio-economic and perhaps cultural contextual origins...|$|R
