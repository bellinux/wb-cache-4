5|$|On 4 September, Mary Kom had {{its world}} premiere at the 2014 Toronto International Film Festival, where {{it became the}} first Hindi film to be {{screened}} on the opening night of the film festival. It was initially released to 1500 screens worldwide. The film was released in overseas markets by Eros International {{as part of a}} four-film deal between Eros and Viacom 18 studios. The rights to television broadcasting belonged to Viacom18's flagship general entertainment channel Colors. The film was not released in Kom's home state of Manipur because of the ban on Bollywood films by the Imphal-based separatist militant group, Revolutionary Peoples Front (RPF) since 2000. In an interview with Press Trust of India, Kom expressed her <b>sadness</b> <b>that</b> people from her own state {{would not be able to}} see her biopic. However, unauthorised DVDs and VCDs flooded the state, with the DVD format in great demand as the only option for native people to watch the film.|$|E

500|$|Lyrically, Yamaguchi worked {{around a}} [...] "night" [...] theme, and was {{inspired}} by creating film-like imagery for each song. Yamaguchi wanted to compile lyrics featuring introspective feelings of worry and <b>sadness</b> <b>that</b> people primarily felt at night. Yamaguchi was further inspired to write more autobiographically, creating a documentary-like non-fiction work. He wanted to create lyrics closer to the style of haiku than standard pop lyricisim, in order to express many things with as few phrases as possible.|$|E

Where previously she had been cooperative and friendly with the detectives interviewing her, she now began to attack them verbally, calling investigators and their methods [...] "pathetic", alleging that they had withheld from her knowledge of the children's deaths, and demanding to be allowed to see Farrar and the remains of the family's house.

[...] A fellow columnist from Inside Soap later named Frank's proposal of marriage to Bobby as [...] "golden moment in soap".

Like that film, Money for Nothing exudes {{compassion}} for the underdog dreamer but could use more personality and punch in putting over its dynamite story. Even so, it's a winner because of the inherent strength of its material and its cast. For all its humor Money for Nothing (rated R for language and for a scene of sexuality) is marked by an ever-growing undertow of <b>sadness</b> <b>that's</b> all but palpable." ...|$|R

About Lane's forced retirement, Harris stated: [...] "In the beginning, he doesn't know that's the reason he's being called into the office. Once it comes up, {{he thinks he can}} bluff his way out of it. And then he goes through all of these emotions, from anger to denial to depression to acceptance. It was all written in there. The [...] was very specific about the different turns he would take." [...] Harris continued about his character's subsequent suicide: [...] "When Matt told me [...] idea, I laughed my ass off. When he said the car doesn't start, I just laughed for about five minutes. Nothing goes right for ...The <b>sadness</b> <b>that</b> I feel is that it's been such an amazing experience."

500|$|Mwng {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics, {{with a score}} of 84 on Metacritic denoting [...] "universal acclaim". Allmusic called the album [...] "terrific", and stated that the band's decision to release an all-Welsh record was courageous and proof that they are [...] "the great eccentric band of [...] time". Drowned in Sound called the album [...] "a poignant, dark, curling, bundle of songs", but expressed <b>sadness</b> <b>that</b> the band's usual [...] "skewed play on words" [...] are missed by all but Welsh speakers. In contrast, Rolling Stone said that the album's [...] "tight arrangements of melodic bliss" [...] manage to cross the [...] "Welsh-language barrier." [...] Yahoo! Music stated that Mwng cemented the Super Furry Animals' position as [...] "figureheads of futuristic rock." [...] The review went on to state that Mwng is [...] "a theoretically disorientating and complex, but triumphantly audacious, experience", and said that initial reservations {{about not being able}} to understand the lyrics were lost when it became clear that Rhys was always [...] "unintelligible [...] on record anyway".|$|E
500|$|While Deangelo gets {{annoyed with}} Jim and Pam, {{he loves the}} antics of Andy, who has resorted to {{physical}} comedy when his jokes fall flat, {{getting to the point}} where he pours hot coffee on his pants and (at Deangelo's urging) eats soap; Andy tells the camera with dazed <b>sadness</b> <b>that</b> [...] "this is my life now". Deangelo's popularity with the employees causes Michael to get jealous to the point where he passes out peanut butter sandwiches, despite Deangelo's peanut allergy. Deangelo then assembles the staff in the [...] "multipurpose room", including Dwight, who learned from Gabe Lewis (Zach Woods) that Michael did not put in a recommendation and thus snubs Michael. Jim quietly tells Michael that he chose to resign his job and needs to come to terms with both that choice and the fact that life is going to go on at the office. Deangelo then steps out of his meeting and asks Michael for advice for how to run the meeting, saying that he is a good manager and Dunder Mifflin will not be the same without him. The two make up with a reverse hug, Deangelo telling him that he should start enjoying his retirement. Michael returns to his office while Deangelo conducts his meeting in the conference room.|$|E

500|$|Dónde Están los Ladrones? {{comprises}} Latin pop {{and rock}} en Español styles. The album opens with [...] "Ciega, Sordomuda", which is musically filled by typical Mexican trumpets over a disco dance loop and an electric guitar. Second track [...] "Si Te Vas" [...] lyrically depicts an angry Shakira who tells her lover [...] "Si me cambias por esa bruja, pedazo de cuero, no vuelvas nunca más, que no estaré aquí". The next song, [...] "Moscas en la Casa", {{was inspired by}} the singer's troubled relationship with Puerto Rican actor Osvaldo Ríos. Shakira lyrically expresses the <b>sadness</b> <b>that</b> she feels after a broken relationship. [...] "Mis días sin ti son tan oscuros, tan largos, tan grises, mis días sin ti", she sings. In the next track [...] "No Creo", the singer expresses how she believes in nothing and nobody except her lover. The song references popular socially accepted or non-accepted norms such as herself, luck, Karl Marx, Jean-Paul Sartre, Venus and Mars, and Brian Weiss. The fifth song on Dónde Están los Ladrones? is [...] "Inevitable". Lyrically, in the hard rock ballad, Shakira confesses that she does not know how to prepare coffee, does not understand soccer, that she must have been unfaithful at some point and that she never wears watch. The next track [...] "Octavo Día" [...] is a rock-oriented song that refers to God coming to Earth after finishing his work and discovering everything to be in ruins, and decides to quit his job and become a normal man. She also namechecks Bill Clinton and Michael Jackson.|$|E
500|$|George's {{incarnation}} as Lieutenant The Honourable George Colthurst St. Barleigh MC, in Blackadder Goes Forth, is a frontline officer [...] strongly reminiscent in both {{manner and}} personality of Bertie Wooster (as whom Laurie would later {{go on to}} appear). General Melchett (played by Stephen Fry, also later of Jeeves & Wooster), intimates to Captain Darling that he and George's [...] "Great Uncle Bertie" [...] used to [...] "break wind" [...] for their college. George joined the army {{on the first day}} of World War I, along with nine other students at Cambridge University. The ten men named themselves the Trinity College tiddlywinks, or the [...] "Trinity Tiddlers". It is revealed later, in the fourth series' finale, that George is the only surviving member of the group. Although he lacks any kind of skill, competence, or authority as an officer, his upper-class status and educational background meant he went straight into the commissioned ranks upon enlisting. George is shown to have a special friendship with General Melchett (Fry), an old family friend with whom he shares his public school [...] "tally-ho" [...] attitude towards the war. Melchett even offers George a way out of the trenches for the [...] "final push", which he refuses, much to Blackadder's incredulity. Although George is shown to have benefited from his background of privilege he still remains a generally kind and hopeful individual, and shortly before the big push at the end of the final episode George finally expresses some genuine fear and <b>sadness</b> <b>that</b> he may indeed die.|$|E

We find <b>that</b> <b>sadness</b> induces choices <b>that</b> are closer to ambiguity-neutral attitudes compared with the joy, fear, and control groups, where decision makers deviate more from payoff-maximizing behavior. ...|$|R
