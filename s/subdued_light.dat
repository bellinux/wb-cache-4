500|$|While most jumping spiders focus {{accurately}} up {{to about}} 75cm away, P. schultzi responds {{to a maximum of}} about 10cm in good light, and ignores everything in very <b>subdued</b> <b>light.</b> For prey, P. schultzi prefers web-based spiders, then jumping spiders, and finally insects. The females of P. schultzi and other Portia species build [...] "capture webs" [...] to catch prey, and often join their own webs on to web-based spiders to catch the other spiders or their prey.|$|E
60|$|The {{necklace}} lay {{exposed to}} view, the wonderful stones flashing in the <b>subdued</b> <b>light.</b> Ella gazed at it, speechless.|$|E
60|$|He did {{not answer}} her. The <b>subdued</b> <b>light</b> which crept under the porch and came in through the fan shaped window over the door fell on his face.|$|E
50|$|H. erythrozonus {{is readily}} {{available}} and usually inexpensive. Golden and albino varieties are also sold. It is best seen in the freshwater aquarium when kept in <b>subdued</b> <b>lighting</b> with a dark substrate.|$|R
50|$|Piet Bekaert (8 May 1939, in Vichte - 7 July 2000, in Deurle) was a Belgian painter. Influenced by the Impressionists, he {{is known}} for his unique <b>subdued</b> <b>lighting</b> style, and enchanting garden and indoor scenes.|$|R
25|$|The library's six-story {{above-ground}} {{tower of}} book stacks {{is surrounded by}} a windowless rectangular building with walls made of translucent Vermont marble, which transmit <b>subdued</b> <b>lighting</b> to the interior and provide protection from direct light, while glowing from within after dark.|$|R
60|$|Nelly Bryant {{looked about}} the room wistfully. This {{was the sort of}} room she {{sometimes}} dreamed about. She loved its <b>subdued</b> <b>light</b> and the pulpy cushions on the sofa.|$|E
60|$|She {{could see}} the shadows of stately trees and the {{outlines}} of rolling hills; beneath her feet was soft turf, but otherwise the <b>subdued</b> <b>light</b> of the moon disclosed nothing clearly.|$|E
60|$|I did {{not speak}} at first for fear of {{frightening}} the little one away. But when I was satisfied that her eyes had become sufficiently accustomed to the <b>subdued</b> <b>light</b> of the interior, I smiled.|$|E
50|$|An {{aquarium}} {{intended to}} house harlequin rasboras should be planted with live plants, with some open areas for swimming provided between stands of {{plants such as}} Cryptocoryne species, these being among the plants that inhabit the harlequin rasbora's native waters. Likewise, some Asiatic species of Aponogeton may be utilised. Bushy plants such as Cabomba may also {{be used in the}} aquarium, but this genus of plants requires intense lighting, while the Cryptocoryne and Aponogeton species prefer more <b>subdued</b> <b>lighting,</b> as does the harlequin rasbora, so if the aquarist wishes to have a variety of plants in the aquarium, other species that prefer <b>subdued</b> <b>lighting</b> are better choices. Filtration should provide modest currents (most of the home watercourses inhabited by the fish are relatively slow moving) but still provide sufficient filtration turnover to maintain aquarium cleanliness.|$|R
50|$|Anubias, {{most notably}} the varying forms of A. barteri, are {{commonly}} used in aquariums, usually attached to rocks or bogwood. In contrast to most plants, Anubias generally prefer <b>subdued</b> <b>lighting</b> and can also produce flowers underwater. In the aquarium they should be placed in shaded areas, otherwise algae will develop on the leaves.|$|R
50|$|The {{parents should}} be {{introduced}} to the breeding aquarium up to 7 days before spawning, fed heavily with live foods, and kept under <b>subdued</b> <b>lighting.</b> In addition, the parents tend to prefer to spawn under quiet conditions, and thus the aquarium should be sited away from areas of busy human traffic. The temperature should be slowly raised to 32 °C, and sometimes 33 °C may be needed depending upon the individual specimens. Spawning is difficult to observe, taking place as it does under <b>subdued</b> <b>lighting,</b> and while chase sequences followed by {{the adoption of a}} side-by-side position by the parents amid the provided spawning media may be taken as indication that spawning is indeed taking place, this is by no means certain. The judicious use of a low-power flashlight to observe spawning may be helpful in determining if eggs are actually being produced.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Ravenor softly {{pulled down}} the green {{lampshade}} on the side nearest to him, and in the <b>subdued</b> <b>light</b> I could scarcely see his face, but I felt that his interest in my story was growing.|$|E
60|$|She sat {{staring at}} the great piece of glowing mineral which lay in her hand. Its surface was irregular; it had many faces; the <b>subdued</b> <b>light</b> from the window gave it the {{appearance}} of animated water. He {{felt it necessary to}} speak.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, sir," [...] {{observed}} Kinney, {{when they}} had got back into Bartley's parlor, and he was again drinking in its prettiness in the <b>subdued</b> <b>light</b> of the shaded argand burner, [...] "I hain't seen anything yet that suits me much better than this." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{interior}} is more neutral, with mostly white surfaces and <b>subdued</b> <b>lighting.</b> The architect {{describes it as}} [...] "a frame for the display of art, an empty canvass {{to be filled with}} paintings, a beautiful but blank container to be completed by its contents." [...] It includes a gift shop and an indoor/outdoor cafe.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{only very}} tired," [...] she {{repeated}} wearily, as she allowed Lord Fancourt to lead her, where <b>subdued</b> <b>lights</b> and green plants lent coolness to the air. He got her a chair, into which she sank. This long interval of waiting was intolerable. Why did not Chauvelin come {{and tell her}} {{the result of his}} watch? ...|$|R
5000|$|Carniolan {{honey bees}} {{are about the}} same size as the Italian honey bee, but they are {{physically}} distinguished by their generally dusky brown-grey color that is relieved by stripes of a <b>subdued</b> <b>lighter</b> brown color. Their chitin is dark, but it is possible to find lighter colored or brown colored rings and dots on their bodies. They are also known as the [...] "grey bee".|$|R
60|$|Mary {{looked almost}} charming in the <b>subdued</b> <b>light</b> {{of the sun}} as it broke through the leaves, giving a {{softness}} of expression and a richness of colour that James had never seen in her before. And the summer frock she wore made her more girlish and irresponsible than usual.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is not silly if we {{take the}} right view. We must sit {{together}} {{in order to get}} into harmony. We further these conditions by sitting in <b>subdued</b> <b>light</b> with fingers touching. Song adds still more to this concert of thought. Nothing is really silly or prosaic--all depends upon the minds of those--" ...|$|E
60|$|There was {{an opening}} above. If we could but reach it we might still {{hope to make}} {{the shelter of the}} cliff caves. My eyes had now become quite used to the <b>subdued</b> <b>light</b> of the interior, and as I pursued my {{investigation}} I presently came upon a rough ladder at {{the far side of the}} cave.|$|E
50|$|Once {{spawning}} is completed, it is {{advisable to}} keep the aquarium under dim lighting conditions until the eggs have hatched and the fry are free-swimming. While rummy-nose tetras do not need their eggs {{to be kept in}} total darkness as is the case for neon and cardinal tetras, the eggs are known to exhibit some degree of photosensitivity, and <b>subdued</b> <b>lighting</b> is highly advisable during egg development in the breeding aquarium.|$|R
50|$|The Azadi Museum {{is located}} on the {{basement}} floor. Inside the floor, there are black austere walls and proportions, and a concrete mesh forms the ceiling. Heavy doors open onto a crypt with <b>subdued</b> <b>lighting</b> issuing from showcases, each containing an object. The museum houses a number of gold and enamel pieces, painted pottery, marble and paintings. Approximately fifty pieces have been selected, each representing a particular period in Iran's history.|$|R
40|$|New pyrethrin-like {{compounds}} {{are compared}} with earlier synthetic pyrethroids and natural pyrethrins for intrinsic toxicity to adult mosquitos and for residual contact activity. Two of the compounds {{are at least}} as toxic as pyrethrin I to female Anopheles stephensi and Aedes aegypti. Residues of these compounds are very persistent in the dark or in very <b>subdued</b> <b>lighting</b> but they decompose on exposure to normal intensities of daylight and rapidly lose their insecticidal activity...|$|R
60|$|They {{all three}} went in; and Mr. Gradgrind sat down forlorn, on the Clown's {{performing}} {{chair in the}} middle of the ring. On one of the back benches, remote in the <b>subdued</b> <b>light</b> and the strangeness of the place, sat the villainous whelp, sulky to the last, whom he had the misery to call his son.|$|E
6000|$|They did not all use the napkins, {{but they}} enjoyed having them there beside their plates, and the <b>subdued</b> <b>light,</b> the freedom from insects {{impressed}} them almost to decorum. They entered with awe, avid for {{a word with}} [...] "Lize Wetherford's girl." [...] Generally they failed of {{so much as a}} glance at her, for she kept away from the dining-room at meal-time.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is--it is--love!" [...] and he sank {{upon his}} knees before her, where, {{she could not}} but notice, he looked very {{handsome}} in the <b>subdued</b> <b>light</b> of the room, with his upturned face blanched by sickness, and his southern glowing eyes. [...] "Elsa, I love you and no other, and unless you return that love my heart will break and I shall die." ...|$|E
50|$|The blind cave tetra is a hardy species. Their lack {{of sight}} does not hinder {{their ability to}} get food. They prefer <b>subdued</b> <b>lighting</b> with a rocky substrate, like gravel, {{mimicking}} their natural environment. They become semi-aggressive as they age, and are by nature schooling fish. Experiments have shown that keeping these fish in bright aquarium set-ups {{has no effect on}} the development of the skin flap that forms over their eyes as they grow.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} years of The Matrix, there was a huge mural of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse on the left wall near the rear; rumor was that the members of Jefferson Airplane painted it before the club first opened (appropriate, since these four {{horsemen}} all carried musical instruments). The mood the mural conveyed was sort of in keeping with the very <b>subdued</b> <b>lighting</b> everywhere in the club other than the small stage.|$|R
5000|$|According to The Times, the museum, whose [...] "narrow {{tunnel and}} <b>subdued</b> <b>lighting</b> impose an {{atmosphere}} of oppression,""clearly uses the idiom of displacement, loss and incomprehension." [...] Jonathan Glancey, in The Guardian, calls it [...] "a masterpiece...in architectural dialogue with the paintings hung on its walls." [...] Detractors, however, have said that Nussbaum's work is powerful enough on its own {{that it would have}} benefitted from being exhibited in a more neutral space.|$|R
60|$|He looked {{sick and}} wan, but strangely tall and splendid in the barbaric pomp of the {{gorgeous}} robe {{which he had}} worn yesterday. Dion had cleaned it of blood and dust, and it still looked crumpled and stained, but as he came forward the purple and gold gleamed against the stuccoed walls of the studio, and his tawny hair and sun-tanned face looked dark in the <b>subdued</b> <b>light.</b>|$|E
60|$|Slowly we rode {{back down}} the valley, entranced, almost oppressed, by the incommunicable splendor of forested hills and sunset sky. It was {{with a sense of}} actual relief that we reëntered our apartment. Our eyes ached with the effort to seize and retain the {{radiance}} without, and our minds, gorged with magnificence, were grateful for the <b>subdued</b> <b>light,</b> the ugly furniture, the dingy walls of our commonplace little hotel.|$|E
60|$|As far aloft as I {{could see}} the stems and {{branches}} and twigs were as smooth and as highly polished as the newest of American-made pianos. The wood {{of some of the}} trees was as black as ebony, while their nearest neighbours might perhaps gleam in the <b>subdued</b> <b>light</b> of the forest as clear and white as the finest china, or, again, they were azure, scarlet, yellow, or deepest purple.|$|E
50|$|The horseface loach's native {{substrate}} {{is one of}} sand or gravel, wherein it will characteristically burrow itself. These loaches {{spend much}} of their time buried in the substrate, leaving only their eyes uncovered. Due to this incessant burrowing, any live plants should be potted to avoid uprooting. The use of floating plants is recommended, as these loaches prefer <b>subdued</b> <b>lighting.</b> Horseface loaches are not picky eaters, but live food (such as tubifex) is relished.|$|R
50|$|The cave {{is open to}} {{the public}} every day year-round, and gets the most {{visitors}} on hot summer days; the interior of the cave is cool, being a steady 15 °C/59 °F year-round, and in winter gloves are recommended for holding the cool metal railings. A 1.7 km/5577 ft length of twisting, turning limestone caverns have been outfitted with metal walkways, becoming quite narrow at some points,and <b>subdued</b> <b>lighting.</b> The vertical height of the walkways is 50m/164 ft.|$|R
50|$|Nudity between sexual {{partners}} is widely accepted, and bathing with the partner, {{sleeping in the}} nude and dressing in front of partners are common. However, even in private, some partners feel uncomfortable being nude in front of another, or exposing their sexual arousal; and insist on some restrictions on their nudity. For example, a person may feel comfortable being nude only during a sexual activity, and then only with <b>subdued</b> <b>lighting,</b> or covered by a sheet or blanket.|$|R
