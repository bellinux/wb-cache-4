The {{effects on the}} production of biomass, toxin production, and spore formation capability of mosquito toxic strain were determined. Toxicity differs within the same strain depending on the growth medium. Bt sv 2 produced with pigeon pea and <b>soya</b> <b>bean</b> <b>flour</b> were found highly effective with LC 50 < 4 [*]ppm against larvae of Aedes aegypti. These results were comparable with bacteria produced from Luria broth as a reference medium. Cost-effective analyses have revealed that production of biopesticide from test media is highly economical. The cost of production of Bt sv 2 with <b>soya</b> <b>bean</b> <b>flour</b> was significantly reduced by 23 -fold. The use of nonconventional sources has yielded a new knowledge in this area as the process development aspects of biomass production have been neglected as an area of research.

40|$|Marama bean (Tylosema esculentum (Burch) A. Schreib) is an underutilised, drought-tolerant legume {{native to}} the drier parts of Botswana, Namibia and South Africa. The bean is {{comparable}} to <b>soya</b> <b>beans</b> in protein content and quality whereas its oil content is {{comparable to that of}} peanuts. By adding value to the marama bean through processing into protein-rich flours, its utilisation may be increased. Therefore, one of the objectives {{of this study was to}} adopt suitable low-cost processing technologies used for soya processing to produce protein-rich marama <b>bean</b> <b>flours.</b> The effect of dry heating of whole marama beans on lipoxygenase enzymes of its defatted flour was determined since oxidative rancidity catalysed mainly by lipoxygenase enzymes can reduce the shelf-life of the flour. The presence of trypsin inhibitors can affect the protein digestibility of the marama <b>bean</b> <b>flour</b> adversely. The effect of dry heating of whole marama beans on in-vitro protein digestibility and amino acid content of its defatted flour was determined. Lastly, the effect of dry heating of whole marama beans on the protein-related functional properties of the resultant defatted flour was determined. The presence of lipoxygenase iso-enzymes (L- 1 and L- 2) activity in marama beans was determined by a visual and spectrophotometeric method using unheated <b>soya</b> <b>beans</b> as reference. Lipoxygenase iso-enzymes (L- 1 and L- 2) activity was not detected in marama beans. This may possibly suggest that these lipoxygenase iso-enzymes are absent or possibly inhibited in marama beans. In an attempt to optimise dry heating to inactivate trypsin inhibitors in marama beans, whole marama beans were dry heated at 100 °C, 120 °C and 150 °C, respectively for 20 min. Defatted flours prepared from the heated marama beans (HMF’s) were analysed for their trypsin inhibitor activity using defatted flours from unheated marama <b>beans</b> (UMF) and <b>soya</b> <b>beans</b> (USF) as control and reference samples, respectively. Trypsin inhibitor activity in UMF was almost four and half times higher than in USF. Dry heating of whole marama beans at 150 °C/ 20 min significantly reduced the trypsin inhibitor activity in its defatted flour to almost zero probably due to inactivation of the trypsin inhibitor. The effect of dry heating of whole marama beans at 150 °C/ 20 min on the physico-chemical, nutritional and protein-related functional properties of defatted marama <b>bean</b> <b>flour</b> was determined. UMF was used as a control while USF and HSF were used as reference samples. HMF had higher protein content but lower fat content than UMF. It is suggested that dry heating disrupted the lipid bodies of the marama beans allowing more oil to be expelled during coarse milling of the flour. Heating significantly reduced the L* values of marama and <b>soya</b> <b>bean</b> <b>flours</b> possibly due to Maillard browning reactions. Heating significantly increased in-vitro protein digestibility of marama and <b>soya</b> <b>bean</b> <b>flours</b> probably due to protein denaturation and inactivation of trypsin inhibitors. Heating generally decreased the amino acid contents of marama and <b>soya</b> <b>bean</b> <b>flours</b> possibly due to chemical modification of the amino acids. UMF and HMF can potentially be used to improve protein quality in marama-cereal composite flours, porridges and breads. Heating significantly decreased the nitrogen solubility index (NSI) and emulsifying capacity (EC) of marama and <b>soya</b> <b>bean</b> <b>flours</b> possibly due to protein denaturation and/or cross-linking. This may make HMF and HSF not suitable for applications in emulsion type meat products such as sausages because emulsion formation is critical during processing of sausages. Heating significantly decreased the foaming capacity of soya flour but did not have an effect on that of marama <b>bean</b> <b>flour</b> probably due to their high residual fat content which may have disrupted protein films during foam formation. UMF has a potential to be used in comminuted meat products because of its relatively high NSI, EC and OAC. The laboratory process used in this study can be modified and adopted by SME’s to produce defatted marama <b>bean</b> <b>flours</b> with potential applications in bakery and meat products and as a protein supplement in composite marama-cereal products.

40|$|As {{eucalypt}} pollens contain low {{concentrations of}} lipid, enhancing pollen diets with fatty acids was hypothesised to improve honey bee longevity. Different concentrations of linoleic and oleic acid added to eucalypt pollen were trialled in small cages containing approximately 1400 bees each. Bees fed diets of redgum (Corymbia calophylla (Lindl.) Hill & Johnson, formerly Eucalyptus calophylla) pollen {{had the lowest}} mortality of 22 diets tested for 6 weeks and had life spans (50 %) greater than 42 days. Linoleic acid mixed with a redgum diet in concentrations > 6 % corresponded to life spans of 24 - 25 days. Bee longevity appeared {{to be more sensitive}} to oleic acid as life spans decreased to 15 - 21 days when diets had concentrations > 2 %. The life spans of bees fed <b>soya</b> <b>bean</b> <b>flour</b> were 26 days on low (0. 6 % lipid) fat, 19 days on defatted and 20 days on full-fat diets. Bees fed lupin flour had a life span of 23 days. Adding redgum pollen to lupin flour caused increased mortality, but addition of pollen to <b>soya</b> <b>bean</b> <b>flour</b> was beneficial. Thus, beekeepers who choose to utilise soya bean or lupin flours as protein substitutes to pollen will have bees with reduced longevity.

40|$|Abstract: The need {{to process}} grains into {{finished}} and packaged by-product {{is a method}} of food storage and a means of enhancing shelf life of biomaterials. The coatings of grains need to be removed most times {{in order to facilitate}} processing. Some grains require cold de-coating while some require heat application in order to facilitate the de-coating process.

40|$|Sweet potato {{cultivation}} provides both {{employment and}} food for Nigeria {{and many other}} countries where the crop is grown. It is the sixth most important food crop {{in the world and}} has several advantages over other staples. It has, for instance, a tremendous capacity for producino drv matter per unit area of land in a short time and it requires fewer production inputs than yam, cassava or other staple crops. It is also less vulnerable to drought and heavy storms. S C O Narinyi of Nigeria's National Root Crops Research Institute highlights sweetness, strong taste and aroma, and the colour of the cooked product, as the most important areas requiring attention if the acceptability of sweet potatoes is to be enhanced. Deep orange and violet (or purple) flesh colours are disliked and white or yellow fleshed cultivars are generally preferred. Also, while other staple crops such as rice, cassava, potato, yam and cocoyam have little taste and need flavouring to increase palatability, many consumers object to the taste and smell of sweet potato. Nevertheless, others consume sweet potato because of its sweetness and flavour so there is opportunity for selection to modify these characteristics to suit a greater proportion of the population. Industrial processing is another option for modifying appearance and taste: tubers are now peeled, sliced, dried and milled into flour, which can be used in various food preparations. With maize and <b>soya</b> <b>bean</b> <b>flours,</b> good infant foods have been produced and sweet potato flour blends well with wheat flour for making bread, biscuits and cakes. High yielding cultivars from the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) in Ibadan, Nigeria are in demand From farmers and further cultivars are on trial. With yields of 25 - 40 t per hectare, a growing period of three to four months, wide ecological adaptation, easy preparation and low input requirements, the sweet potato obviously has considerably unexploited potential as a major crop.

The permeability of the intestinal mucosa of calves undergoing hypersensitivity reactions to ingested HSF has been assessed by feeding them milk and quantitating the leakage of beta-lactoglobulin into the blood. Maternal beta-lactoglobulin did not evoke an antibody response in calves. Therefore its detection in the serum was not influenced by immunological mechanisms that normally remove or exclude antigens from the circulation. In sensitized calves ingestion of HSF caused {{a dramatic increase in}} the permeability of the intestine to beta-lactoglobulin. The change was transitory and after 24 hr permeability had almost returned to normal. The mucosal barrier was not permanently damaged regardless of the number or the severity of the reactions experienced. Indomethacin was ineffective in counteracting permeability changes. A progressive increase in the sensitivity of the gut to soya bean antigens was accompanied by a rise in the titre of serum antibodies to soya bean proteins. Absorbed beta-lactoglobulin was present in the serum in its monomeric form only, and quickly disappeared from the circulation. In an enzyme immunoassay used to measure its concentration absorbed beta-lactoglobulin was indistinguishable from the native protein.

Twenty protein sources were studied: five <b>soya</b> <b>bean</b> <b>flour</b> samples, one pea flour and fourteen newly developed blends of soya bean and maize germ (fi ve concentrates and nine hydrolysates). The physicochemical characterization included pH (5. 63 to 7. 57), electrical conductivity (1. 32 to 4. 32 mS/cm), protein content (20. 78 to 94. 24 % on dry mass basis), free amino nitrogen (0. 54 to 2. 87 mg/g) and urease activity (0. 08 to 2. 20). The functional properties showed interesting differences among proteins: water absorption index ranged from 0. 41 to 18. 52, the highest being of soya and maize concentrates. Nitrogen and water solubility ranged from 10. 14 to 74. 89 % and from 20. 42 to 95. 65 %, respectively.

Therefore the difference of the temperature between the outer layer and the inner layer of board decrease after passing the minimum value of inner layer temperature of the board. (Fig. 3) 2) The longer the hot press cycle, the higher the value of modulus of elasticity, modulus of rupture and Brinell hardness, but the lower the impact bending absorbed energy of the particles, and the feeding quantity of heat. There is not significant relation between the specific bending strength and the hot press cycle. (Fig 2 ̆ 7 s. 4 and 5) 3) The water absorptivity of board is remarkably high at 27 min. hot press cycle, but its value is low at longer than 32 min. cycle and it varys a little as shown in Fig. 6.

Although the ADIN concentration of the <b>soya</b> <b>beans</b> increased with increasing heat treatments, more heat damage could have been inflicted on it to differentiate the different <b>soya</b> <b>bean</b> fractions in comparison to each other. On average, the in sacco disappearance of the dry matter (DM), crude protein (CP) and Se was higher for the unprocessed <b>soya</b> <b>beans</b> compared to the two processed <b>soya</b> <b>beans</b> fractions. As a result, the lambs receiving the unprocessed <b>soya</b> <b>beans</b> (control group- C-group) had a significant higher rumen bacterial Se concentration than the lambs receiving the heat¬treated <b>soya</b> <b>beans.</b> Despite this higher concentration, the liver Se concentration of this group was statistically significantly lower compared to the two heat-treated groups. This can be interpreted that the heat processing of the <b>soya</b> <b>beans</b> enhanced its Se fraction to be taken up by the liver. However, those differences were biologically not significant. The average liver Se concentration between the lambs receiving the over- ¬processed- (a-group) and those receiving the ideal treated <b>soya</b> <b>beans</b> (I-group), did not differ, indicating that the excessive heat treatment did not influence the amount of Se reaching the lower digestive tract of the a-group. Although the Se concentration of the heart muscle of the a-group was statistically significantly lower than for the I-and C-groups, those differences biologically were not significant. Despite an increase in the erythrocyte GSH-Px activity over the duration of the trial in all three the treatment groups, no significant differences between the three treatment groups were observed at any stage. It is concluded from this study that the heat treatment of <b>soya</b> <b>beans</b> has not influenced the incorporation and the bioavailability of its Se fraction to any significant degree.

40|$|<b>Soya</b> <b>bean</b> is {{also known}} as green manure because it can {{increase}} soil fertility level. Nowadays, agricultural fields in Indonesia has drastically lowered in number to become housing and accomodate industrial purposes. <b>Soya</b> <b>bean</b> planting using agroforestry system is considered to overcome such problems in Indonesia as well as an effort to optimize under-tree spaces (forest vegetations). <b>Soya</b> <b>bean</b> rooting system is capable of forming nodulation in which Rhizobium japonicum bacteria colonize. Rhizobium bacteria establish such beneficial symbiosis with <b>soya</b> <b>bean</b> roots to fixate free nitrogen (N 2) from air (Rahmat, 1995). Rhizobium japonicum is employed as an effort {{to increase the number of}} soil-living rhizobium bacteria which in turn provide the plant with Nitrogen and thus increase the <b>soya</b> <b>bean</b> production (Freire, et. al. 1977). Bradyrhizobium japonicum inoculum on <b>soya</b> <b>bean</b> is necessarily needed if soil nitrogen is the limiting factor of plant growth (Idiyah, 1997). Rhizobium infection and colonization into plant roots and initial root nodules are fully influenced by Ca. Ca is needed in rhizobium infection on interface level with medium of soil (Yutono, 1985). This research is conducted to isolate, select, and describe Bradyrhizobium japonicum in <b>soya</b> <b>bean</b> grown under sengon tree. The research was conducted in trial field of Muhammadiyah University of Malang in Tegalgondo and Biotechnology laboratory of Muhammadiyah University of Malang starting from April up to October 2007. Stages of operation include field preparation, <b>soya</b> <b>bean</b> seed planting, nodules picking up, nodules sterilization, Bradyrhizobium japonicum isolation, keeping of isolated strains, Gram Test, and bacteria portrayal. The research resulted in that by isolating, selecting, and describing 7 bacteria strains were found on the basis of its growth speed and share same characters including varyingly colony colors, from yellow to brownish white with colony tip is branched round to fully round and share the same thickness (Thick) ...|$|R

40|$|The nutritive {{quality of}} <b>soya</b> <b>bean</b> grain depends on many {{nutritional}} and anti-nutritional factors, such as proteins, trypsin inhibitors, phytate, phenolics, sulfhydril groups of proteins, malondialdehide. The {{aim of this}} study was to investigate content of noted nutritive and anti-nutritive factors in seven ZP <b>soya</b> <b>bean</b> varieties: ZPS 015, Bosa, Nena, Lidija, Olga, Lana and Laura. Experimental data could point out different properties and usage of ZP <b>soya</b> <b>bean</b> varieties. Regardless of insignificant differences in content of proteins and phytate, special attention is given to Lana and Laura, varieties lacking in Kunitz-trypsin inhibitor. It is also important to emphasise high content of phenolics in Nena variety as well as high sulfhydril groups and glutathione level in Nena and Olga.

On the Polish market, soybeans come mostly from traditional crops, {{for this reason}} its cultivation is much more expensive than soybeans derived from GM crops. Refuse soybean contains {{a large amount of}} fat that can be used as an additive enriching animal feed fat. It is however essential first soybeans processing. The extrusion process is one of the processing method refused soybean or whole soybeans as a component in extruded blends. The study used with isolated hulled and unhulled soybeans. From the analysis of the results obtained for the extrudates of mixtures with wheat and corn with addition of <b>soya</b> <b>bean</b> grains, it can be concluded that both the cutting strength and the hardness of the extrudates was higher in the case of corn compound. The greatest ratio of expansion was achieved for the extrudates of wheat and unhulled <b>soya</b> <b>bean</b> compound. The highest hardness was obtained by subjecting to extrusion a mixture of unhulled <b>soya</b> <b>bean</b> meal with corn, while introducing meal of hulled <b>soya</b> <b>bean</b> resulted in extrudates with about 70 % lower hardness...|$|R
