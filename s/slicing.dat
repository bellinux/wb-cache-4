5|$|Simple {{versions}} are prepared by <b>slicing</b> vegetables and drying them, without any cooking involved. Sometimes a mandoline {{is used to}} slice vegetables for vegetable chips, which can accommodate thin <b>slicing</b> and enhance size consistency. Vegetable chips may be flavored with spices such as salt, sea salt, pepper, cajun spice, curry, allspice, chipotle powder, sweet or smoked paprika, adobo seasoning, dried chives and many others. Mass-produced varieties may contain food preservatives or monosodium glutamate. Vegetable chips can be homemade using various recipes and preparation processes.|$|E
5|$|The high-crowned sudamericids were {{probably}} herbivores, but the lower-crowned Ferugliotherium was more probably an insectivore or omnivore, like similar multituberculates such as Mesodma, which {{is thought to}} have eaten insects, other arthropods, seeds, and/or nuts. It may have used its incisors for gnawing or <b>slicing,</b> and the blade-like p4 may also have been used for <b>slicing</b> hard plant parts, such as seeds. The wear patterns on Ferugliotherium teeth independently suggest that the animal may have eaten some plant material.|$|E
5|$|Because {{scratches}} {{dominate the}} microwear {{texture of the}} teeth, Williams et al. suggested Edmontosaurus was a grazer instead of a browser, which would be predicted to have fewer scratches due to eating less abrasive materials. Candidates for ingested abrasives include silica-rich plants like horsetails and soil that was accidentally ingested due to feeding at ground level. The tooth structure indicates combined <b>slicing</b> and grinding capabilities.|$|E
50|$|This type of {{algorithm}} is included as tool in baseline profile the H.264/MPEG-4 AVC encoder with I <b>Slices,</b> P <b>Slices,</b> Context Adaptative Variable Length Coding (CAVLC), grouping of <b>slices</b> (<b>Slice</b> Group), arbitrary <b>slice</b> order (ASO) and Redundancy <b>slices.</b>|$|R
30|$|All these {{functionalities}} {{are assigned}} to links of <b>slices.</b> The <b>slice</b> switch and the <b>slice</b> gateway transport data from a source link to a target link (the relationship is 1 to 1). The <b>slice</b> multiplexer and demultiplexer works on multiple links on one side (the Nto 1 or 1 toN relationship). It is not assumed here that source or target link(s) are from a single <b>slice</b> (the <b>slice</b> chaining concept is allowed described in [72], based on [73]). The <b>slice’s</b> switch can combine two <b>slice’s</b> links from the same layer in the common protocol stack. The <b>slice</b> gateway is slices’ switch that can combine two <b>slice’s</b> links from different layers or of different protocol stacks (or both). The <b>slice</b> multiplexer can merge multiple <b>slices</b> into a single <b>slice,</b> which could be later split up by a <b>slice</b> demultiplexer.|$|R
50|$|For each <b>slice,</b> the <b>slice</b> {{length and}} the {{macroblock}} address (i.e. index {{with respect to}} the raster scan order) of the first macroblock (MB) of the <b>slice</b> are extracted by the <b>slice</b> parser (Figure 2). This information, together with the <b>slice</b> itself, is stored in memory (shown as DRAM). In addition, a list of pointers (Figure 2, a pointer for each <b>slice,</b> and each pointing to the memory location where a <b>slice</b> is stored), should be generated. The list of pointers, together with the address of the first macroblock of the <b>slice,</b> will be used to navigate through the out of order <b>slices.</b> The <b>slice</b> length will be used to transfer the <b>slice</b> data from the DRAM to the decoder’s internal memory.|$|R
5|$|Fanny {{opened the}} door again and Powell shoved past her to Seward's bed. He stabbed at Seward's face and neck, <b>slicing</b> open his cheek, but the splint doctors had fitted to Seward's broken jaw (often mistakenly {{described}} as a neck brace) prevented the blade from penetrating his jugular vein. He eventually recovered, though with serious scars on his face.|$|E
5|$|Cassava {{chips are}} a common food in much of Africa, {{including}} the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ghana and Malawi. In Ghana, cassava chips are called konkonte. Dried cassava chips are also used to supplement the carbohydrate content of livestock feed in Ghana. In Malawi, cassava chips are prepared by soaking cassava, <b>slicing</b> it, and then letting it dry. This is the primary means by which cassava is transported to markets from production areas.|$|E
5|$|It is also {{reported}} that the soil of the park formed by the phumdis is highly acidic, with unsuitable pH conditions for many species of plants to grow and flourish. Further, the acidity of the soil has also adversely affected the fish breeding farms.s|accessdate=2009-04-04|author =Shaji K.A.|publisher= Udhakamandalam, Countercurrents.org}} Recent reports indicate that locals are <b>slicing</b> the phumdis into sizeable pieces and towing them with canoes to sell to fish culture owners.|$|E
50|$|An {{example of}} how <b>slices</b> can be {{associated}} to different <b>slice</b> group is shown in Figure 3. When ASO and FMO are supported, the four <b>slices</b> of this example can be received by the decoder in a random order. Figure 2 shown the following order: <b>slice</b> #4, <b>slice</b> #2, <b>slice</b> #1, and <b>slice</b> #3. The same figure presents the AVC decoder blocks required to support ASO and FMO decoding.|$|R
30|$|The {{isolation}} {{problem can}} be considered over E 2 E approach (whole <b>slice</b> chain) or only over a single <b>slice</b> from <b>slice</b> chaining. Isolation in <b>slice</b> chaining should satisfy the rule that the isolation level of whole <b>slice</b> chain is not greater than the isolation level of any of <b>slices</b> inside the chain. The consequence of this rule is that network should first guarantee proper creation of <b>slices</b> inside each <b>slice</b> domain (RAN, CN, and other) and in next step an attempt to look after E 2 E slices’ isolation. The <b>slices</b> in each domain can be created independently, but simultaneous creation could cause additional problems with isolation. The E 2 E <b>slice</b> could use <b>slices</b> created earlier if the slices’ parameters are compatible (i.e., provided isolation level, throughput, availability).|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to the <b>slice</b> length and the macroblock address of the 1st macroblock (MB) of the <b>slice,</b> the <b>slice</b> parser (Figure 4) need to extract the <b>Slice</b> Group (SG) of each <b>slice.</b> These informations, together with the <b>slice</b> itself, are stored in DRAM. As in the ASO case, the list of pointers (Figure 4) should be generated.|$|R
5|$|Psittacosaurs had {{self-sharpening}} {{teeth that}} would have been useful for cropping and <b>slicing</b> tough plant material. Unlike later ceratopsians, they did not have teeth suitable for grinding or chewing their food. Instead, they used gastroliths—stones swallowed to wear down food as it passed through the digestive system. Sometimes numbering more than fifty, these stones are occasionally found in the abdominal cavities of psittacosaurs, and may have been stored in a gizzard, as in modern birds.|$|E
5|$|Python has array {{index and}} array <b>slicing</b> {{expressions}} on lists, denoted as a, a or a. Indexes are zero-based, and negative indexes are {{relative to the}} end. Slices take elements from the start index up to, but not including, the stop index. The third slice parameter, called step or stride, allows elements to be skipped and reversed. Slice indexes may be omitted, for example a returns {{a copy of the}} entire list. Each element of a slice is a shallow copy.|$|E
5|$|Sliced apples turn {{brown with}} {{exposure}} to air {{due to the}} conversion of natural phenolic substances into melanin upon exposure to oxygen. Different cultivars vary in their propensity to brown after <b>slicing</b> and the genetically engineered Arctic Apples do not brown. Sliced fruit can be treated with acidulated water to prevent this effect. Sliced apple consumption tripled in the US from 2004 to 2014 to 500 million apples annually due to its convenience.|$|E
30|$|Multiplexing and {{demultiplexing}} do {{not require}} deep inspection on different layers of a <b>slice.</b> Data from different <b>slices</b> is marked; <b>slices</b> are grouped and sent through a common link. A switch and a gateway are more complicated according to <b>slices</b> analysis. In some cases, they would require accessing data sent through a <b>slice</b> to transfer {{it to the other}} <b>slice.</b> This means that such devices require special protection according to access to raw slices’ data as well as a proper assurance for interconnecting <b>slices,</b> including preventing wrong interconnection of <b>slices</b> and potential data leakage.|$|R

5|$|The {{locality}} where Batrachotomus lived was a swampy {{region and}} the name comes from the Greek batrachos/βάτραχος (frog) and tome/τομή (cutting, <b>slicing),</b> which refers to its preying on the large amphibian Mastodonsaurus. In contrast with sprawling reptiles, like crocodiles, this large carnivore was very agile with locomotor superiority due to its erect stance. A remarkable feature seen on its back was a row of paired, flattened bony plates. Batrachotomus was possibly an early relative of Postosuchus, which lived during {{the dawn of the}} dinosaurs.|$|E
5|$|Tiger {{shark teeth}} are unique with very sharp, {{pronounced}} serrations and an unmistakable sideways pointing tip. Such dentition has developed to slice through flesh, bone, and other tough substances such as turtle shells. Like most sharks, its teeth are continually replaced by rows of new teeth throughout the sharks life. Relative to the shark's size, tiger shark teeth are considerably shorter {{than those of}} a great white shark, however they are nearly as broad as the root as the great whites teeth and are arguably better suited to <b>slicing</b> through hard-surfaced prey.|$|E
5|$|Agitated by this reversal, {{the eldest}} Kaurava, Duryodhana, orders the rakshasa (giant) Alamvusha (or Alambusha), son of Rishyasringa, to kill Iravan. This time Alambusha, {{as well as}} Iravan, uses {{illusion}} in combat. Alambusha attacks Iravan with a bow, but Iravan counters, breaking Alambusha's bow and <b>slicing</b> the giant into several pieces. Alambusha's body, however, reconstitutes itself. Then Iravan assumes {{the form of the}} serpent Shesha (Ananta), and his serpent army surrounds him to protect him. Alambusha counters this by assuming the form of Garuda (the eagle-man), the eternal foe of the serpents, and devours the serpent army. Ultimately, Alambusha kills Iravan by cutting off his head, though Iravan is later avenged when Ghatotkacha, his cousin, finally kills Alambusha.|$|E
30|$|The {{specimens}} {{were then}} {{stored in a}} − 20 °C freezer until completely frozen. When frozen, they were sawn into four equally thick primary <b>slices</b> in the coronal plane using a band saw. The <b>slices</b> were numbered from one to four, with <b>slice</b> number one as the most anterior and <b>slice</b> 4 the most posterior. The <b>slices</b> were decalcified, dehydrated, fixed in paraffin and cut in 4  μm <b>slices</b> using a microtome. Four <b>slices</b> from each specimen were then stained with hematoxylin-eosin and alcian blue solution and the histological <b>slices</b> were examined microscopically for injuries {{by one of the}} co-authors, an experienced histologist.|$|R
50|$|In {{the method}} of <b>slices,</b> also called OMS or the Fellenius method, the sliding mass above the failure surface is divided {{into a number of}} <b>slices.</b> The forces acting on each <b>slice</b> are {{obtained}} by considering the mechanical (force and moment) equilibrium for the <b>slices.</b> Each <b>slice</b> is considered on its own and interactions between <b>slices</b> are neglected because the resultant forces are parallel to the base of each <b>slice.</b> However, Newton's third law is not satisfied by this method because, in general, the resultants on the left and right of a <b>slice</b> {{do not have the same}} magnitude and are not collinear.|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} linear <b>slices</b> of {{the space}} of Kleinian once-punctured torus groups; a linear <b>slice</b> is obtained by fixing {{the value of the}} trace of one of the generators. The linear <b>slice</b> for trace 2 is called the Maskit <b>slice.</b> We will show that if traces converge `horocyclically' to 2 then associated linear <b>slices</b> converge to the Maskit <b>slice,</b> whereas if the traces converge `tangentially' to 2 the linear <b>slices</b> converge to a proper subset of the Maskit <b>slice.</b> This result will be also rephrased in terms of complex Fenchel-Nielsen coordinates. In addition, we will show that there is a linear <b>slice</b> which is not locally connected. Comment: 35 pages, 6 figure...|$|R
5|$|Canids {{are found}} on all continents except Antarctica, having arrived {{independently}} or accompanied human beings over {{extended periods of}} time. Canids vary in size from the 2-m-long (6ft 7 in) gray wolf to the 24-cm-long (9.4in) fennec fox. The body forms of canids are similar, typically having long muzzles, upright ears, teeth adapted for cracking bones and <b>slicing</b> flesh, long legs, and bushy tails. They are mostly social animals, living together in family units or small groups and behaving cooperatively. Typically, only the dominant pair in a group breeds, and a litter of young is reared annually in an underground den. Canids communicate by scent signals and by vocalizations. They are very intelligent. One canid, the domestic dog, long ago entered into a partnership with humans and today {{remains one of the}} most widely kept domestic animals.|$|E
5|$|T'Pol, {{working out}} in the gym, also keeps urging Archer to {{apologize}} to the Kreetassans for Porthos' behavior, but Archer resists because he blames them for Porthos' illness. In the end, Porthos recovers following a pituitary transplant from an alien chameleon. Finally swallowing his pride, Archer then goes down to the Kreetassan capital and delivers an intricate ritual apology which involves <b>slicing</b> a tree trunk with a chainsaw, arranging the pieces of wood in a complex pattern on the ground, and chanting phrases in the Kreetassan language. Having successfully apologised to the Kreetassans, the crew finally manage to procure three plasma injectors prior to their departure.|$|E

More {{experienced}} actors, including Atiqah Hasiholan and Reza Rahadian (who had received two Citra Awards), were also cast. Hasiholan later stated that it had been her most challenging role yet, citing the cultural differences between the Bajau and what she was familiar with as well as her unprecedented need to act as a mother. In preparing for their roles, Hasiholan exercised <b>slicing</b> and dicing fish, while Rahadian went to Ancol in North Jakarta to learn about dolphins.|$|E
30|$|The {{resources}} layer contains {{both physical}} and logical resources. The network <b>slice</b> instance can consist of sub-network instances, which can be shared with multiple network <b>slice</b> instances. The network <b>slice</b> instance is defined by a Network <b>Slice</b> Blueprint. For creating every network <b>slice</b> instance are required dedicated polices and configurations.|$|R
30|$|A network <b>slice</b> {{instance}} {{is a set}} of (virtualized) network functions implemented at resources which enable running these network functions. It forms complete instantiated logical {{networks that}} meet certain network characteristics (e.g., ultra-low-latency, ultra-reliability, etc.) required by the Service Instance. A network <b>slice</b> instance could be isolated from another network <b>slice</b> instance in several ways, e.g., full or partial isolation and logical or physical isolation. To create a network <b>slice</b> instance, a network operator uses a Network <b>Slice</b> Blueprint (description of the structure, configuration, and the flows and ways to control the network <b>slice</b> instance during its life cycle). A network <b>slice</b> instance ensures the network characteristics which are needed by a service instance. Therefore, a network <b>slice</b> instance can be shared with multiple service instances provided by the network operator.

5|$|By {{the early}} Cretaceous {{and the ongoing}} breakup of Pangaea, dinosaurs were {{becoming}} strongly differentiated by landmass. The earliest part of this time saw the spread of ankylosaurians, iguanodontians, and brachiosaurids through Europe, North America, and northern Africa. These were later supplemented or replaced in Africa by large spinosaurid and carcharodontosaurid theropods, and rebbachisaurid and titanosaurian sauropods, also found in South America. In Asia, maniraptoran coelurosaurians like dromaeosaurids, troodontids, and oviraptorosaurians became the common theropods, and ankylosaurids and early ceratopsians like Psittacosaurus became important herbivores. Meanwhile, Australia was home to a fauna of basal ankylosaurians, hypsilophodonts, and iguanodontians. The stegosaurians appear to have gone extinct {{at some point in}} the late early Cretaceous or early late Cretaceous. A major change in the early Cretaceous, which would be amplified in the late Cretaceous, was the evolution of flowering plants. At the same time, several groups of dinosaurian herbivores evolved more sophisticated ways to orally process food. Ceratopsians developed a method of <b>slicing</b> with teeth stacked on each other in batteries, and iguanodontians refined a method of grinding with tooth batteries, taken to its extreme in hadrosaurids. Some sauropods also evolved tooth batteries, best exemplified by the rebbachisaurid Nigersaurus.|$|E
5|$|In the Pokémon Adventures manga, Blue {{receives}} a Charmander from his grandfather Professor Oak. It evolves into a Charmeleon, and when Blue is possessed by a Gastly in the Lavender Tower, so is Charmeleon. Blue's Charmeleon is eventually released from its possession {{only to be}} faced down by an Arbok, owned by Koga. Charmeleon tricked Koga by using a zombie Psyduck to deflect Arbok's acid attack before literally <b>slicing</b> the Arbok in half with his tail. Blue later appears with an evolved Charizard and gains access to Saffron City by helping to disable a barrier created by a Mr. Mime. Later, Red and Blue face off against Koga's Articuno and are frozen by its Ice Beam, but they ultimately defeat the Team Rocket Executive with Charizard's Flamethrower. It then teams up with Red's newly evolved Venusaur, Saur, and Green's Blastoise, Blasty, to defeat Sabrina's monster Pokémon. They end Team Rocket's control of Saffron City, splitting apart the three birds in the process.|$|E

Mulder receives another phone call from the mysterious caller telling him that success on his current work is imperative so that the X-Files be reinstated undeniably. When he questions Scully about it, she denies any involvement. The flukeman is brought back to the processing plant. Scully believes that the flukeworm she found in the body is a larva, attempting to reproduce. One of the men at the processing plant is pulled underwater by the flukeman while investigating a storm drain overflow. Mulder heads in and saves him, apparently killing the flukeman by closing a sewer grate on it, <b>slicing</b> it in half.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{investigate}} the role of ethylene action, via use of the ethylene antagonist 1 -methylcyclopropene (1 -MCP), on the senescence and quality of fresh-cut ripe papaya (Carica papaya L. `Sunrise Solo') fruit. Ripe papaya fruit were treated with 2. 5 μL·L- 1 1 -MCP and immediately processed into fresh-cut <b>slices</b> or left intact. At 2 -day intervals over 10 days at 5 °C, continuously stored <b>slices</b> were monitored for ethylene production, firmness, electrolyte leakage, color, sensory changes, and pathogen incidence. <b>Slices</b> freshly prepared from intact fruit stored under identical conditions were measured similarly. Ethylene production did not differ significantly between the treatments, although production rates were slightly but consistently higher in <b>slices</b> from intact control compared with intact 1 -MCP-treated fruit. Mesocarp firmness of continuously stored <b>slices</b> and <b>slices</b> from fruit stored intact was significantly retained by 1 -MCP. Firmness of continuously stored <b>slices</b> from 1 -MCP-treated fruit declined 50 % compared with 75 % for control <b>slices.</b> Firmness of fresh-cut <b>slices</b> prepared from intact control and 1 -MCP-treated fruit at each sampling interval declined 26 % and 15 %, respectively. Electrolyte leakage remained low and changed little in <b>slices</b> freshly prepared from fruit stored intact. Leakage from continuously stored papaya <b>slices</b> increased after 4 days, and after 6 days controls increased significantly compared with stored <b>slices</b> derived from papaya fruit initially treated with the ethylene antagonist. The flesh color of continuously stored <b>slices</b> or <b>slices</b> prepared from fruit stored intact was influenced by 1 -MCP only during the later periods of storage. Microbial counts in stored <b>slices</b> or <b>slices</b> prepared at each sampling were generally unaffected by 1 -MCP.
