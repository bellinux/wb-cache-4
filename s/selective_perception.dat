The reaction time of pressing buttons to the target letter was measured as a function of spatial arrangement of letters, where the effects of the total number of letters and the spatial separation were controlled appropriately and the line indicator was strictly the only cue for target selection. It was suggested that the <b>selective</b> letter <b>perception</b> is influenced by the special spatial arrangement of letters which is produced by both the total number of letters and the heterogeneity of letter-to-letter separations...|$|R

Cognitive psychology provides several theories and insights concerning the accuracy of human judgment. <b>Selective</b> <b>perceptions</b> refers to the fact that <b>perceptions</b> are <b>selective,</b> reconstructive, and subject to memory biases. The context in which one encounters a situation affects the way it is perceived, and therefore will affect judgments and decisions. There are three such context effects: the primacy effect, the recency effect, and the halo effect. General rules to help find solutions are known as "heuristics.

The most important reason for expression of these tentative and diffuse ideas is to provoke responses about their relevance, fruitfulness, and omissions; most of all a push in a fruitful direction would be appreciated. The baselines for our current thinking derive from DRC’s and personal experiences in various crisis-relevant organizations (police, fire, hospitals, etc. which have been observed to change plans, policies, organizational structure, etc. because of anticipation of possible crisis response; and the literature on organizations. DRC’s research experience, through our <b>selective</b> <b>perceptions,</b> indicated low levels of change in disaster-relevant organizations even after experience of disaster has clearly demonstrated the shortcomings of current organizational plans and preparations. It has also indicated relatively high levels of innovation in anticipation of possible civil disturbances, even in some cases where community factors make them seem unlikely. Presently, important research goals would seem to be development of more extensive and systematic data on the empirical distributions and patterns of organizational innovation in anticipation of crisis and attempts at ordering possible factors which may account for the empirical similarities and differences in organizational innovation...|$|R
40|$|Increasing {{international}} and, often, cross-cultural {{contacts and}} exchanges in all spheres {{of human activity}} have created {{a world in which}} the access to other, alternative knowledge pools seems to be easier than ever before. Science in particular, or, more generally, fields of knowledge creation, are considered to have greatly benefited from this global inter-connectedness. At the same time, we can witness processes of nationalisation within the science discourses of non-'Western' countries as well as (often officially supported) revivals of indigenous, non-'Western' forms of knowledge. Occasionally, these trends are framed in a strongly anti-'Western' outlook. The paper aims at shedding some light on the current discourse on 'Eastern' and 'Western' knowledge production and knowledge exchange within the humanities, investigating the arguments which are employed when one system of science is being scrutinised and evaluated by the other. It will be shown that in the course of these reception and evaluation processes, the arguments often rely heavily on the a priori construction of 'East' and 'West', thus leading to very specific and <b>selective</b> <b>perceptions</b> of the respective science systems and paradigms. In spite or, maybe, because of many scholars' international engagement, it is, above all, the episteme of 'difference' (between 'East' and 'West') that pervades cross-cultural dialogue on knowledge...|$|R
40|$|The use of {{environmental}} management systems, and objectives-led corporate management {{have become a}} widespread phenomenon today. Identification and assessment of an organisation’s significant (environmental) aspects is crucial within this work. Identification and especially assessment of significant aspects is often considered as a problematic step in many organisations. There are no generally accepted methods how to undertake this crucial step. Corporate management towards sustainable development needs to concern {{all members of the}} organisation to be successful. This study presents a management information system (MIS) for this purpose. The specific purpose is to develop a method for assessment of significant aspects that account for different viewpoints and values within the organisation. Methods used for this assessment has been tested through different procedures. The result of this study shows that a crossfunctional group should use the MIS, when the variables in the MIS are not merged together, and the result presented not aggregated. The tool could be used for both strategic and operative decisions. The MIS contributes with a new way of thinking, and opens a way for a holistic view within the company. The MIS may help to remove some of people’s <b>selective</b> <b>perceptions</b> and increase the problemsolving capacities within the company...|$|R
5000|$|In the {{political}} realm, <b>selective</b> <b>perception</b> often {{occurs when a}} voter is presented with a candidate position {{that he or she}} does not agree with but supports the candidate otherwise. Sherrod (1971) found that [...] "voters preferring a particular candidate do selectively perceive that candidate's position on an issue {{in such a way as}} to make it consistent with their own" [...] (p. 554). He pinpointed three primary reasons why the initial disagreement happens. First, the candidate and voter may share political party affiliation, but may not agree on all of the issues. Second, the voter may simply be unaware of the candidate's actual position. Third, social pressure to take a particular stand on an issue may exist that causes the voter to be incongruent with his or her preferred candidate (Sherrod, 1971). <b>Selective</b> <b>Perception</b> is not only associated with the voter and the candidate they affiliate with. <b>Selective</b> <b>perception</b> is also seen when someone attacks a political opponent by focusing on a particular issue they disagree with. Voters will ignore any common stances on issues with the opposition, and thus scorch the opponent on one main idea (Falcon, 2012). An example of political <b>selective</b> <b>perception</b> can be seen in Barry Ritholtz's Politics and <b>Selective</b> <b>Perception</b> chart. In this chart, we are given the unemployment numbers at specific points in time under different House Majorities. <b>Selective</b> <b>perception</b> allows the user to view this chart in any way they feel is deemed correct, though the chart doesn't reveal really anything about politics or unemployment (Ritholtz, 2010).|$|E

It is the <b>selective</b> attention, <b>perception,</b> and higher order cognitive processing that limits these inputs and it is precisely these processes that make up our conscious awareness. Thus, in order to formulate some explanations for Plato's Problem, our conscious awareness limits our experience; nevertheless, it seems as though some stimuli that are sensed by our sensory registers, although seemingly rejected by conscious awareness, are actually retained and abstracted into our memories for further processing. All of our fully functioning perceptual faculties enhance, supplement, and optimize our experiences.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Technologically {{advanced}} {{nations have}} moved far enough into the post-industrial era {{so that they}} are now experiencing- strong so-cial pressures for greater flexibility in the formal education and career planning of both youth and adults. Such flexibility must take into account the life-long nature of educational processes and the changing nature of work. Accordingly, the vocational psychologist will need to re-examine his past pre-occupations in order to ascertain whether or not his models and empirical data are any longer relevant to the solution of problems which are now arising in these rapidly changing societies. Are social changes affecting the psychological milieu within which educational and vocational counseling have traditionally taken place? This paper takes the position that they are and that technologically advanced nations are currently experiencing strong pressures for new orientations in the guidance of both youth and adults. Accordingly, the counselor may need to re-examine some of his assumptions in order to assess {{whether or not they are}} any longer relevant to educational/ vocational decision-making in the 1970 's and 1980 's. Blocher (1973) has noted that: Human behavior is very much a social product. People exercise <b>selective</b> <b>perceptions,</b> organize their experiences, attach meaning to events, and build expectations about the future on the basis of social learning (p. 44). What changes are occurring today which may be producing new per-ceptions of how career planning should be carried out (and, hence, how the career counselor should function in his role) ? The discussion which follows attempts to delineate two broad areas of change and to identify, briefly, the accommodations which will probably need to be made in our counseling perspectives if relevant guidance is to be main-tained in the so-called "transition period " between industrial and post-industrial societies...|$|R

40|$|AbstractA <b>selective</b> motion <b>perception</b> {{deficit is}} seen in {{patients}} with acute midline cerebellar lesions. Patients with more lateralized acute cerebellar damage do not demonstrate such a deficit (Nawrot M, Rizzo M. Vis Res 1995; 35 : 723 – 731). However, as these patients were tested only between 10 and 14 days post-ictus, the stability of this perceptual deficit into the chronic phase remained undetermined. The current study extends the previous findings by showing that the motion perception deficit caused by mid-line cerebellar lesions remains permanent at least 2 years into the chronic phase. The extent and longevity of this deficit resembles that of the well known motion-blind patient LM who has a large cerebellar lesion {{in addition to her}} extensive cortical damage. Again, we propose that the mid-line cerebellar damage may produce a severe motion perception deficit by disrupting the visual-motor integration mechanisms involved in perceptual stabilization, even though cortical motion processing mechanisms are unaffected...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: This review {{considers}} {{deficits in}} the <b>selective</b> aspects of <b>perception</b> (i. e. attention) underlying symptoms of impaired attention and impulsivity {{in children with}} attention-deficit hyperactivity syndrome (ADHD) in terms of frontal and temporal lobe function and cerebral asymmetry. Review: Tomographic studies suggest a disturbance of fronto-striatal function, but have neglected limbic contributions under activating conditions and are contradictory or equivocal {{on the nature of}} apparent lateralised differences of structure. Functional neuropsychological (e. g. go/no-go and covert orienting of attention tasks) and psychophysiological studies (e. g. event-related potentials and mismatch negativity [1]) suggest that early and late stages of information processing are affected in both the frontal and temporal lobes. Performance differences in young ADHD patients imply an impairment in the inter-cortical dialogue. Given the evidence for a normal specialisation in global processing in the right and the processing of details in the left hemisphere, the lateralised impairment may progress from situational ADHD (resulting in impaired <b>selective</b> aspects of <b>perception</b> on the right) to pervasive ADHD (inducing an additional impairment in decision making on the left: compare risk taking). Conclusions: Accordingly a proportion of ADHD children may experience an early negative neurodevelopmental influence that only appears as the brain region matures (especially around 8 - 12 years of age) while others show an independent, longer term, delayed development of CNS function...|$|R
5000|$|Opie's work is {{characterized}} by a combination of formal concerns, a variety of printing technologies, references to art history, and social/political commentary. An example of formal concerns include addressing issues of the horizon line in the [...] "ice house" [...] and [...] "surfer" [...] series. She has printed photographs using chromochrome, iris prints, Polaroids, and silver photogravure. Examples of art history references include the use of bright color backgrounds in portraits which reference the work of Hans Holbein and the full body frontal portraits that reference August Sander. Opie's older work from the 1990s could be related to the traditions of Renaissance and Baroque art: placing her subjects central to the composition, utilizing stark, dramatic light source, allowing her subjects to fall in front of rich backgrounds; Opie's images relay a more aggressive undertone. Certain art historical attributes throughout her images, themes and/or icon's that have been referenced throughout art history. Use of certain symbols in her works have allowed these portraits to sit separately from any of her previous works. The portraits, for instance, from Opie's more recent work in the 2012, the image David, utilizes blood. The symbolism used in this work is recognized as a reoccurring statement for Opie, personally and allegorically. These images convey symbolic references to the celebration, embracing and remembrance of the shift and personal relationship with one's body. Unlike other artists, Opie grounds her work in personal relationships, meanings and histories; however, this unfortunately precedent's the ability for one to read these images outside of the intimate content. Most of Opie's work sits in this very personal community, allowing for <b>selective</b> <b>perceptions.</b> Where some viewers may not understand certain allegories and symbols within her work, individuals who know Catherine's work well can very identify specific conceptual or metaphorical statements within the images themselves. Where these images demand to be read as allegories, the performative aspect of this work differs from previous work Catherine has produced. Opie's earlier work relays more heavily on documentary photography as opposed to allegorical, yet still provide a stark relationship to her investigation and use of powerful iconography throughout the years.|$|R

40|$|Why do {{some people}} have {{problems}} "feeling the beat"? Here we investigate participants with congenital impairments in musical rhythm perception and production. A web-based version of the Montreal Battery of Evaluation of Amusia was used to screen for difficulties with rhythmic processing in a large sample and we identified three "dysrhythmic" individuals who scored below cut-off for the rhythm subtest, but not the pitch-based subtests. Follow-up testing in the laboratory was conducted to characterize the nature of both rhythm perception and production deficits in these dysrhythmic individuals. We found that they differed from control participants when required to synchronize their tapping to an external stimulus with a metrical pulse, but not when required to tap spontaneously (with no external stimulus) or to tap in time to an isochronous stimulus. Dysrhythmics exhibited a general tendency to tap at half the expected tempo when asked to synchronize {{to the beat of}} strongly metrical rhythms. These results suggest that the individuals studied here did not have motor production problems, but suffer from a <b>selective</b> rhythm <b>perception</b> deficit that influences the ability to entrain to metrical rhythms...|$|R

40|$|Relative {{to other}} areas of psychology, {{cognitive}} psychology is a relatively young sub-discipline that emerged in the late 1950 ’s in response to various problems associated with the behaviorist paradigm. In the research which has followed, a primary goal has been to discover the basic underlying mechanisms mediating the processes of <b>selective</b> attention, <b>perception,</b> learning, remembering, forgetting, and both the representation and use of various types of knowledge systems. More recently, however, the trend has been to investigate various ways in which cognitive behavior manifests itself within everyday life. As illustrated in the syllabus below, this covers a broad range of topics that includes the memory for faces and geographical locations, eyewitness testimony, advertising, decision-making, the use of language, and modifying the environment to make it optimally compatible with cognitive resources. In addition, we will also consider some recent developments in the areas of autobiographical memory, meta-cognition, the biological bases of memory, mood and emotion, and cognitive diversity.

50|$|It is not {{possible}} to completely avoid all discrepant messages. When exposure to a dissonant message has occurred, the phenomenon of <b>selective</b> <b>perception</b> often follows. This process simply means that people skew their perceptions to coincide with what they desire (Johnson-Cartee & Copeland, 1997). Perception is subjective and dependent on several factors; one factor, for example, is media type. Prior research indicates that people who actively process television news tend to engage in more individualized explanations of an event as opposed to those active processors of newspapers (McLeod, Kosicki, & McLeod, 2002). The <b>selective</b> <b>perception</b> discussed here, however, is done in order to reduce dissonance with previously held beliefs (Wheeless, 1974). Several communication theories use this assumption of skewed perception as their basis (i.e., hostile media phenomenon, third-person effect).|$|E
5000|$|Seymour Smith, a {{prominent}} advertising researcher, found evidence for <b>selective</b> <b>perception</b> in advertising {{research in the}} early 1960s, and he defined it to be [...] "a procedure by which people let in, or screen out, advertising material they {{have an opportunity to}} see or hear. They do so because of their attitudes, beliefs, usage preferences and habits, conditioning, etc." [...] People who like, buy, or are considering buying a brand are more likely to notice advertising than are those who are neutral toward the brand. This fact has repercussions within the field of advertising research because any post-advertising analysis that examines the differences in attitudes or buying behavior among those aware versus those unaware of advertising is flawed unless pre-existing differences are controlled for. Advertising research methods that utilize a longitudinal design are arguably better equipped to control for <b>selective</b> <b>perception.</b>|$|E
40|$|In {{times of}} dynamic markets, radical {{technological}} breakthroughs and rapidly changing customer demands, strategic flexibility and quick adaptations to market conditions are {{crucial for the}} economic success of an organization. However, due to inertial forces, some firms do not succeed in renewing their strategies, even if business charts expose urgent need for action. To date, these phenomena of organizational inertia {{have been the subject}} of much research. In the tradition of evolutionary economics, the concept of structural inertia exposes various internal (e. g. sunk costs) and external (e. g. social legitimacy) factors that might be causal for organizational rigidity. Further, the popular notion of capabilities analyzes how organizational routines and core competences inhibit an organization from deviating from its established trajectory of assets. On a cognitive level, managerial cognitions in terms of shared mental models and <b>selective</b> <b>perceptions</b> are seen as causal for one-sided decision making leading to organizational rigidity. Without doubt, all these concepts contribute to explain widespread inertia within organizations and reveal which factors may increase the likelihood of an organization to become inert. However, research to date has not fully revealed how the process leading to inertia emerges. It is about this gap that the theory of path dependence comes to the fore. By conducting a dynamic perspective, path dependence theory explains by what intermediate steps and due to which mechanisms inertia emerges. Since the theory of path dependence originally bases on technological innovations and standard settings, little research has yet been done in applying path dependent processes to an organizational context. Hence, the goal of this dissertation thesis is to explain strategic rigidity in an organization from a path dependence perspective. As the central research question it is analyzed why an organization holds on to its strategies despite declining businesses and dynamic market conditions. This question is answered by conducting a critical in-depth case study of an organization whose strategic development is constrained by strong inertial forces. Specifically, the strategic alignment of the German Bertelsmann book club, which is presumed to be path dependent, is analyzed retrospectively from 1950 to 2007. Results reveal that despite of market dynamics and declining businesses the basic strategic columns of the book club have not been changed within the stream of time. However, many attempts to correspond to changing customer demands and market conditions have been accomplished but none of them resulted in sustainable strategic deviations. The empirical findings of a detailed path-analysis shed light on the reasons for the strategic rigidity of the book club. Historical strategic decisions triggered self-reinforcing mechanisms (economies of scale, complementary, and learning effects), finally leading to a strategic lock-in due to path dependency...|$|R
