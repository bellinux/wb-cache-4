40|$|Purpose: Greece is a net {{importer}} {{of oil and}} gas and is among the most vulnerable countries of the European Union (EU) on energy supply disruptions. Furthermore, is considered a ""crossroad"" of existing and forthcoming infrastructure for importing energy to the EU. The {{purpose of this paper is}} the presentation of the web tool that implements the developed methodology for the quantification of socio-economic risks of oil and <b>gas</b> <b>corridors.</b> The tool is applied to the main present and future oil and <b>gas</b> <b>corridors</b> to Greece, and the related outcomes are discussed. Design/methodology/approach: A structured and coherent review on the future and present oil and natural <b>gas</b> (NG) <b>corridors</b> to Greece was elaborated, based on desk analysis and collection of the related data from national and international sources. Factor analysis was employed for the quantification of socio-economic risks of each energy corridor. Particular emphasis was laid on the tool's design, so as to be user-friendly, combining intuitive menus and navigation throughout the steps of the system. Findings: The calculation of socio-economic risks of the main oil and <b>gas</b> <b>corridors</b> to Greece provides operative and measurable concepts for supporting energy-modelling processes. Indeed, this paper provides useful insights on the factors affecting the smooth energy supply and the reliability {{of oil and gas}} supply options to the Greek energy system. Moreover, the presented web tool can be used as a reference point for the researcher working on energy supply risks quantification. Originality/value: The introduction of the energy corridors perspective in the valuation of supply security is of significant importance, taking into account the constantly increasing energy dependence of EU countries. To the best of the authors' knowledge, a structured and coherent review of the future and present oil and NG corridors to Greece is not present in the international literature. In addition to this, the development of the web tool is a clear contribution towards the quantification of the economic and socio-political risk analysis and a step forward of the existing studies. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited...|$|R

40|$|Growth in gas demand poses a {{challenge}} for European energy consumers and other gas-importing countries {{in terms of an}} increasing dependency on gas imports and consequently also supply security. This paper focuses on interactions among demand, supply, and investments in natural <b>gas</b> <b>corridors,</b> namely pipeline transport, LNG, and storage facilities, affecting the European natural gas market over the period 2005 - 2030. A number of policy scenarios, including a business-as-usual (BAU) scenario, are formulated to study the impact of demand uncertainty and delays in investment on the gas transport infrastructure required in the long run in Europe. The analyses indicate that substantial investments in <b>gas</b> transport <b>corridors</b> are needed to accommodate imports and seasonal demand variations. Analysis of scenarios of supply interruption, in the form of suddenly reduced import capacity for particular pipeline routes, indicates that portions of Europe could experience price increases of up to 100 % {{in the case of a}} year-long interruption. To accommodate import needs and to mitigate possible disruptions, pipeline connections running from East to West need to be given special priority. ...|$|R

40|$|Security {{of energy}} supply {{is crucial to}} energy {{dependent}} economies toensure stable supplies and not to impede their economic development andsocial well-being. The rising concern in the European Union (EU) about energysupply security has led to various different risk and vulnerability reductionstrategies being put in place. One of the options considered is to improveEurope’s interconnection with neighbouring countries by promoting trans-European networks. Diversifying sources of supply and transport routes is one ofthe fundamental intermediate objectives {{in the process of}} promoting energysupply security. Turkey has been considered as a key country in the hydrocarbon supplydiversification strategy. However, a rigorous quantitative analysis was neededto assess the actual significance of Turkish corridors for the EU's energy security. The aim of this doctoral thesis has been to analyse the development of theTurkish corridors’ contribution to the EU's energy security from 2000 to 2020. The approach taken here uses factor analysis to measure geopoliticalenergy risks of countries and chokepoints along oil and natural <b>gas</b> <b>corridors.</b> The estimation of the Energy Supply Geopolitical Risk Index allowed the level ofsecurity in energy corridors to be pinned down. The aggregation of thecountries and chokepoints’ security indicators in every corridor constitutes theEnergy Supply Geopolitical Security Index by corridor. Finally, the developmentover time of Turkish corridors’ contribution to the EU’s energy security has beenanalysed, having been measured as the level of security of every corridorweighted for its relative physical capacity. The findings of this research are that, inter alia, a change is taking placein the relative importance of Turkey in the EU’s energy supply, but that this ishappening in different ways and over different timescales in the case of oil andnatural gas. The contribution of Turkey’s oil corridors to the EU’s security of supply rosefastest between 2000 and 2010 (60 %), while the increase in its role over theperiod 2010 - 2020 is set to be smaller (23 %). By 2020 the contribution of Turkey’soil corridors will be approximately 5 %, so it is expected to more than double itscontribution to EU’s security between 2000 and 2020. 3 Turkey’s <b>gas</b> <b>corridors</b> would go from 0 % contribution to the EU's securityof supply in 2000 to account for almost 9 % in 2020. The greater change will takeplace in the time-frame 2010 - 2020, by multiplying by five. Thus, whereas the contribution of Turkey's oil corridors to the security ofthe EU’s energy system saw a rapid rise between 2000 and 2010, the growth inthe role of its natural <b>gas</b> <b>corridors</b> is expected to take place during the presentdecade. Both cases entail an improvement in the relative position of Turkishcorridors in the EU, from which it may be deduced that the EU’s policy ofdiversification has led to Turkey’s gaining in geostrategic importance for theEU’s security of supply...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The European Union (EU) {{energy supply}} {{environment}} is changing significantly {{and in a}} dynamic way, establishing the issue of safe energy imports as main priority. Greece relies heavily on energy imports. Furthermore, Greece aims to be elevated into an energy cross road for the energy supply to the EU. In this respect, {{the aim of this}} paper is the investigation of the suitability of graph theory concepts on energy supply networks and its application to represent energy corridors to Greece. Design/methodology/approach: Supporting frameworks to represent and assess the vulnerability of the corridors satisfying the Greek demand in oil and gas are considered a crucial issue and are presented in this paper, based on the graph theory approach. In addition, a pilot application of the shortest path algorithm and the maximum flow at minimum risk algorithm for the oil and <b>gas</b> <b>corridors</b> to Greece is presented and discussed. Findings: This paper introduces the application of graph theory to energy policy analysis. Indeed, the pilot application in oil and <b>gas</b> supply <b>corridors</b> to Greece, although quite simplified, has indicated the applicability of graph theory concepts in such problems and is considered a step forward of the existing studies, supporting the design efforts towards the development of a more reliable energy supply system. Originality/value: To the best of the authors' knowledge, graph theory's application to energy corridors is not available in the international literature. In this respect, the added value of the paper is the provision of a sufficient decision support framework for the representation and assessment of the energy corridors' risk of energy availability, through the application of graph theory. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited...|$|R
40|$|The Russian-Ukrainian gas {{crisis of}} January 2009, {{occurring}} {{three years after}} a similar dispute between Moscow and Kyiv had disrupted Russian natural gas supplies to Europe, led many European commentators to question the continued reliability of Russia as a supplier of natural gas. The role of Ukraine as an energy transit state was also put under the spotlight. The January 2009 crisis followed the conflict between Russia and Georgia in August 2008. This brief war had compelled governments in member states of the European Union (EU) to reconsider the wisdom of being dependent for over 40 percent of their gas imports from an increasingly emboldened and aggressive Russia. Attention has focussed more on developing projects which would supply natural gas to Europe from sources other than Russia along routes which would bypass Russian territory.
