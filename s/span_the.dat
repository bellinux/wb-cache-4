Between 1930 and 1940, he served on the State Highway Commission, eventually being elevated to Chairman of the Commission from 1938-1939. While he was Chairman, work was started on a new bridge to <b>span</b> <b>the</b> Indian River Inlet. In recognition for his service on the Commission, the bridge was dedicated on May 28, 1940, in his name for his advocacy for the proper opening of the inlet and the internal development of the Indian River. Two additional bridges bearing his name have spanned the inlet since that time. This, the fifth bridge to <b>span</b> <b>the</b> inlet waterway, is also being dedicated in his name. As this bridge serves the public, let us not forget the lifetime of service that he gave.|$|E

After his death, parts of the bridge were redesigned and became the current State Street Bridge, which was completed in 1930. The Education Building, or Forum Building, was completed in 1931.|$|E

The new bridge was constructed on the same site as the old bridge's predecessor which was constructed just south of the East River Bridge in 1907.|$|E
