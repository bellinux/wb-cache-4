They used a two-stage cluster sample design to produce a nationally representative sample of undergraduate college students aged {{greater than or equal to}} 18 years. The first-stage sampling frame contained 2,919 primary sampling units (PSUs), consisting of 2- and 4-year colleges and universities. The second <b>sampling</b> <b>stage</b> consisted of a random sample drawn from the primary sample unit frame enrolled in the 136 participating colleges and universities to increase the sample size to 4,609 undergraduate college students aged greater than or equal to 18 years old with a representative sample demographic matching the national demographic. Differential sampling rates of the PSU were used to ensure sufficient numbers of male and female, black and Hispanic students in the total sample population. After differential sample weighting, female students represented 55.5% of the sample; white students represented 72.8% of the sample, black students 10.3%, Hispanic students 7.1%, and 9.9% were other. It was determined that nationwide, 13.1% of college students reported that they had been forced to have sexual intercourse against their will during their lifetime. Female students were significantly more likely than male students to report they had ever been forced to have sexual intercourse; 20% of approximately 2500 females (55% of 4,609 samples) and 3.9% of males reported experiencing rape thus far in the course of their lifetime.|$|E

40|$|The present {{disclosure}} describes micromechanical {{devices and}} methods for using such devices for characterizing a material's strength. The micromechanical devices include an anchor pad, a top shuttle platform, a nanoindenter in movable {{contact with the}} top shuttle platform {{and at least two}} <b>sample</b> <b>stage</b> shuttles. The nanoindenter applies a compression force to the top shuttle platform, and the at least two <b>sample</b> <b>stage</b> shuttles move apart in response to the compression force. Each of the at least two <b>sample</b> <b>stage</b> shuttles is connected to the top shuttle platform and to the anchor pad by at least one inclined beam. Methods for using the devices include connecting a sample between the at least two <b>sample</b> <b>stage</b> shuttles and applying a compression force to the top shuttle platform. Application of the compression force to the top shuttle platform results in a tensile force being applied to the sample. Measuring a tip displacement of the nanoindenter is correlated with the sample's strength.

40|$|Abstract Background Mortality {{estimates}} {{can measure}} and monitor {{the impacts of}} conflict on a population, guide humanitarian efforts, and help {{to better understand the}} public health impacts of conflict. Vital statistics registration and surveillance systems are rarely functional in conflict settings, posing a challenge of estimating mortality using retrospective population-based surveys. Results We present a two-stage cluster sampling method for application in population-based mortality surveys. The sampling method utilizes gridded population data and a geographic information system (GIS) to select clusters in the first <b>sampling</b> <b>stage</b> and Google Earth TM imagery and sampling grids to select households in the second <b>sampling</b> <b>stage.</b> The sampling method is implemented in a household mortality study in Iraq in 2011. Factors affecting feasibility and methodological quality are described. Conclusion Sampling is a challenge in retrospective population-based mortality studies and alternatives that improve on the conventional approaches are needed. The sampling strategy presented here was designed to generate a representative sample of the Iraqi population while reducing the potential for bias and considering the context specific challenges of the study setting. This sampling strategy, or variations on it, are adaptable and should be considered and tested in other conflict settings. </p...|$|E
30|$|In {{the present}} study, we {{demonstrated}} that the predicted data were significantly correlated with the plasma concentration of fentanyl (r[*]=[*] 0.734). However, a different pattern of a fixed bias appeared between mastectomy and laparoscopic prostatectomy. In mastectomy, ≈ 0.3  ng/mL of a fixed bias was shown in all sampling stages. However, in laparoscopic prostatectomy, a fixed bias became increasingly negative from ≈ 0.3 to − 0.3  ng/mL as the <b>sampling</b> <b>stage</b> proceeded.
