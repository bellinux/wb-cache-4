For movie-after-movie, Leslie Nielsen has milked this same personality, and it's starting to wear very thin. As affable as the actor is, there's just nothing {{left in this}} caricature. However, while Spy Hard might have worked better with, <b>say,</b> <b>Roger</b> Moore {{in the title role}} (his 007 was a parody towards the end, anyway), Nielsen's performance is {{only a small part of}} a massively-flawed production.

Danny Glover's cameo appearance references Donner's Lethal Weapon film series starring Glover and Gibson as cop partners.

In fact, three of Peat's sons, Sir Harry, Roderick and Charles all later became partners in the firm. The Peat name lives on today in the world of accounting. His son Charles Urie Peat was MP for Darlington and served as Principal Private Secretary to Winston Churchill during the Second World War.|$|E
50|$|The {{club was}} the {{headquarters}} of the Whig opposition to the court, and its members were active promoters of conspiracy and sedition. The president was either Lord Shaftesbury or Sir Robert Peyton, MP for Middlesex, who later turned informer. The Green Ribbon Club served both as a debating society and an intelligence department for the Whig faction. Questions under discussion in parliament were here threshed out by the members over their tobacco and ale; the latest news from Westminster or the city was retailed in the tavern, for some or others were continually coming and going, <b>says</b> <b>Roger</b> North, to import or export news and stories.|$|E
5000|$|To {{prevent this}} bill from passing into law, Charles had {{dissolved}} parliament in July 1679, {{and in the}} following October had prorogued its successor, which {{became known as the}} Exclusion Bill Parliament, without allowing it to meet. He was then deluged with petitions urging him to call it together, and this agitation was opposed by Sir George Jeffreys and Francis Wythens, who presented addresses expressing abhorrence of the Petitioners, and thus initiated the movement of the abhorrers, who supported the action of the king. [...] "The frolic went all over England," [...] <b>says</b> <b>Roger</b> North; and the addresses of the Abhorrers which reached the king {{from all parts of the}} country formed a counterblast to those of the Petitioners. It is said that the terms Whig and Tory were first applied to English political parties in consequence of this dispute.|$|E

50|$|Elisabeth's {{daughter}} Marjorie was {{to receive}} $8 {{million at the}} time of her mother's death. Three days before Elisabeth's death, Marjorie had authorized a paper <b>saying</b> <b>Roger</b> was to receive about $2.5 million of her share. Based on evidence found at the scene and later in Roger and Marjorie's possession, they were arrested. Roger Caldwell was tried first and convicted in 1978. Marjorie was acquitted in 1979. The Minnesota Supreme Court overturned Caldwell's conviction in 1983. Rather than risk an acquittal at retrial, the prosecution offered him a plea deal, a confession, guilty plea to second-degree murder and time served (he had served five years of a twenty-year sentence). He confessed to both murders on July 5, 1983 and was released. He committed suicide on May 18, 1988. In his suicide note he claimed he was innocent of killing Elisabeth Congdon. He never got any of the promised money from Marjorie.|$|R

5000|$|As a {{consequence}} of the English Civil War, the monarchy was overthrown in 1649 and the Crown lands were put up for sale. The manor passed to the Cromwellian General John Lambert. [...] "Lambert," [...] <b>says</b> <b>Roger</b> Coke, in A Detection of the Court and State of England during the four last reigns and the interregnum (1719), [...] "after he had been discarded by Cromwell, betook himself to Wimbledon-house, where he turned florist, and had the finest tulips and gilliflowers that could be got for love or money; yet in these outward pleasures he nourished the ambition which he entertained before he was cashiered by Cromwell." [...] The reputation of Wimbledon manor house in the history of flower gardening thus begins with General Lambert, who painted some of the flowers he was cultivating. Though the Queen's flower gardens may have fallen to ruin in the decade of the Civil War, the glory of Wimbledon aside from the straight avenue of elms and other trees centred on the house, that stretched forth as far as Putney was chiefly its fruit. Among a thousand fruit trees of every kind, the Parliament-men who inventoried the house and gardens in 1649 noted the [...] "three great and fayer" [...] fig trees that covered a very [...] "greate part of the walls of {{the south side of the}} manor-house" [...] "by the spreading and dilating of themselves in a very large proporcion, but yet in a most decent manner"; to have grown so extensive in 1649 the figs must have been planted in the time of Lord Exeter or his son Lord Wimbledon. The orangery in 1649 held 42 orange trees planted in boxes, valued at £10 each, and 18 young ones, a lemon tree [...] "bearing greate and very large lemmons" [...] (£20) a [...] "pomecitron" [...] tree" [...] (Citrus medica, valued at £10), and six pomegranate trees. Doubtless the inventoried bay tree (Laurus nobilis) and the equally tender [...] "Irish arbutis, very lovely to looke upon," [...] were being taken into the orangery for winter protection, as England was then in the frigid grip of the Little Ice Age.|$|E
5000|$|The Undead was {{inspired}} by an interest in reincarnation during the 1950s (as was the film The She-Creature). Notably the book The Search for Bridey Murphy by Morey Bernstein {{was made into a}} film in 1956. Charles Griffith recalls:It was originally called “The Trance of Diana Love”. Roger said to me, “Do me a Bridey Murphy picture.” And I told him that by the time Paramount finishes theirs, ours will fail. At the time, everybody was saying that they were making a bad picture. He just said that we’d get ours done ahead of theirs and clean up. So I did “The Trance of Diana Love” and it got shot funny, especially at the end, where you see the empty clothes before the revelation. It was in iambic pentameter and I had to rewrite it after it was ready to shoot because somebody told Roger that they didn’t understand it. Roger would give it to anybody to read or anybody out on the street. He’d send girls out with scripts.Griffth later elaborated:I separated all the different things with sequences with the devil, which were really elaborate, and the dialogue in the past was all in iambic pentameter. Roger got very excited by that. He handed the script around for everybody to read, but nobody understood the dialogue, so he told me to translate it into English. The script was ruined, but The Undead final title was a fun picture to shoot, because it was done in ten days at the Sunset Stage, which was a supermarket on Sunset Boulevard. We filled it with palm trees and fog, {{and it was the first}} time Roger had used any of that stuff. He didn't like to rent anything. You could see the zipper on the witch's dress and all the gimmicks were very obvious and phony—Roger deliberately played to skid row, a degenerate audience.Pamela Duncan <b>says</b> <b>Roger</b> Corman called her up [...]"out of the blue" [...] and offered her the lead.
