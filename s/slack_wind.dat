5|$|The monsoon trough {{spawned a}} {{tropical}} low on November24 in the Australian basin. It {{moved to the}} southwest, strengthening into Tropical Cyclone Bessi on November27. Two days later, it moved into the South-West Indian Ocean, and was renamed Bako on December1. Located in a similar position to the previous storm, Bako strengthened into a severe tropical storm on December1, aided by warm waters and <b>slack</b> <b>wind</b> shear. The storm turned to the southeast on December2, despite predictions to the contrary, and later that day it intensified further into a tropical cyclone, {{the first of the}} season. However, on December3, Bako weakened back into a severe tropical storm due to much cooler sea surface temperatures and increasing northwesterly wind shear. It weakened into a tropical depression on December5, before transitioning into an extratropical cyclone the same day. RSMC La Reunion continued to track the remnants of Bako until December9.|$|E

5|$|In 1904 the Wrights {{built the}} Flyer II. They decided {{to avoid the}} expense of travel and {{bringing}} supplies to the Outer Banks and set up an airfield at Huffman Prairie, a cow pasture eight miles (13km) northeast of Dayton. They received {{permission to use the}} field rent-free from owner and bank president Torrance Huffman. They invited reporters to their first flight attempt of the year on May 23, on the condition that no photographs be taken. Engine troubles and <b>slack</b> <b>winds</b> prevented any flying, and they could manage only a very short hop a few days later with fewer reporters present. Library of Congress historian Fred Howard noted some speculation that the brothers may have intentionally failed to fly in order to cause reporters to lose interest in their experiments. Whether that is true is not known, but after their poor showing local newspapers virtually ignored them for the next year and a half.|$|R
6000|$|... "At {{least she}} is coming {{straight}} to the quay," [...] exclaimed a fifth, [...] "though what sends her Satan alone knows, for the tide is <b>slack</b> and this <b>wind</b> would scarce move a sponge boat. Stand by with the hawser, or she'll swing round and stave herself against the pier." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{could not}} tell you the twentieth part of the {{difficulties}} we encountered 'on the grounds'--it is a bad spot to be in, even in good weather--but we made shift always to run the gauntlet of the Moskoe-str√∂m itself without accident; although at times my heart has been in my mouth when we {{happened to be a}} minute or so behind or before the <b>slack.</b> The <b>wind</b> sometimes was not as strong as we thought it at starting, and then we made rather less way than we could wish, while the current rendered the smack unmanageable. My eldest brother had a son eighteen years old, and I had two stout boys of my own. These would have been of great assistance at such times, in using the sweeps, as well as afterward in fishing--but, somehow, although we ran the risk ourselves, we had not the heart to let the young ones get into the danger--for, after all is said and done, it was a horrible danger, and that is the truth.|$|R
50|$|CSS Alabama then {{proceeded}} toward the China Sea, passing Sumatra and Java, and arrived in Gasper Strait. Around daylight, new sail was sighted, and a Yankee clipper {{headed toward the}} Alabama {{only to find the}} Confederate flag unfurled when Captain Semmes hoisted a change of colors. The clipper added topsails, and opened chase. Unfortunately for the clipper Contest, a <b>slack</b> in the <b>wind</b> during the midday qualms allowed the Alabama to bring her within gun range. To the regret of Captain Semmes, he could not capture the new prize and outfit her for service in the Confederate Navy, and so he reluctantly burnt her.|$|R
