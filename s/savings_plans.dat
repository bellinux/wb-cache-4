It became the largest bankruptcy in U.S. history, surpassing the 1970 bankruptcy of the Penn Central (WorldCom's bankruptcy the next year surpassed Enron's bankruptcy so the title was short held), and resulted in 4,000 lost jobs. The day that Enron {{filed for bankruptcy}}, the employees were told to pack their belongings and were given 30 minutes to vacate the building.

40|$|This paper {{uses the}} data from INSEE’s  2004  household assets survey (Enquête Patrimoine) to {{highlight}} the determinants of holding a contractual financial <b>saving</b> <b>plan</b> to provide supplementary income, distinguishing between working and retired households. Our {{results suggest that the}} profiles of individuals holding certain types of contractual <b>saving</b> <b>plans</b> (retirement <b>saving</b> and life insurance) are determined by factors common to workers and retirees, and tend to confirm behaviour of saving for retirement. Factoring in occupational status reveals specific profiles that suggest that private-sector workers are disadvantaged, particularly with regard to retirement saving. The discrepancy between the public and the private sector in terms of the supplementary retirement <b>saving</b> <b>plans</b> available is a potential source of inequality in terms of household participation in these schemes. The overlap between holding retirement savings and holding alternative savings (life insurance, employee <b>saving</b> <b>plans)</b> in preparation for old age indicates that altruism and a wish to make inter-generational transfers are among the motivations of holders of annuity products, since a significant proportion hold supplementary death insurance. The need to save for retirement via a non-occupational plan is lessened by the availability of a company retirement <b>saving</b> <b>plan,</b> which households with high incomes and financial assets are the most likely to hold. Employee <b>saving</b> <b>plans,</b> which are the only type of <b>saving</b> <b>plan</b> open to younger cohorts of households, are complementary to company retirement <b>saving</b> <b>plans...</b>|$|R

2500|$|For this reason, {{financial}} advisers often encourage {{those who have}} the option to do so to supplement their Social Security contributions with private retirement plans. One [...] "good" [...] supplemental retirement plan option is an employer-sponsored 401(K) (or 403(B)) plan when they are offered by an employer. 58% of American workers have access to such plans. Many of these employers will match a portion of an employee's savings dollar-for-dollar up to a certain percentage of the employee's salary. Even without employer matches, individual retirement accounts (IRAs) are portable, self-directed, tax-deferred retirement accounts that offer the potential to substantially increase retirement savings. Their limitations include: the financial literacy to tell a [...] "good" [...] investment account from a less advantageous one; the savings barrier faced by those who are in low-wage employment or burdened by debt; the requirement of self-discipline to allot from an early age the required percentage of salary into [...] "good" [...] investment account(s); and the self–discipline needed to leave it there to earn compound interest until needed after retirement. Financial advisers often suggest that long-term investment horizons should be used, as historically short-term investment losses [...] "self correct", and most investments continue to deliver good average investment returns. The IRS has tax penalties for withdrawals from IRAs, 401(K)s, etc. before the age of 59½, and requires mandatory withdrawals once the retiree reaches 70; other restrictions may also apply on the amount of tax-deferred income one can put in the account(s). For people who have access to them, self-directed retirement <b>savings</b> <b>plans</b> have the potential to match or even exceed the benefits earned by federal, state and local government retirement plans.|$|E
