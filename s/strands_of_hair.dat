The defense denied that the murder occurred on the second floor. Both sides contested the significance of physical evidence that suggested {{the place of the}} murder. Material found around Phagan's neck was shown to be present throughout the factory. The prosecution interpreted the scene in the basement to support Conley's storythat the body was carried there by elevatorwhile the defense suggested that the drag marks on the floor indicated that Conley carried the body down a ladder and then dragged it across the floor. The defense argued that Conley was the murderer and that Newt Lee helped Conley write the two murder notes. The defense brought many witnesses to support Frank's account of his movements, which indicated he did not have enough time to commit the crime.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{most other}} marine mammals, the sea otter has no blubber and relies on its {{exceptionally}} thick fur to keep warm. With up to 150,000 <b>strands</b> <b>of</b> <b>hair</b> per square centimeter (nearly one million per sqin), its fur is the densest of any animal. The fur consists of long, waterproof guard hairs and short underfur; the guard hairs keep the dense underfur layer dry. Cold water is kept completely {{away from the}} skin and heat loss is limited. The fur is thick year-round, as it is shed and replaced gradually {{rather than in a}} distinct molting season. As the ability of the guard hairs to repel water depends on utmost cleanliness, the sea otter has the ability to reach and groom the fur on any part of its body, taking advantage of its loose skin and an unusually supple skeleton. The coloration of the pelage is usually deep brown with silver-gray speckles, but it can range from yellowish or grayish brown to almost black. In adults, the head, throat, and chest are lighter in color {{than the rest of the}} body.|$|E

40|$|Animations <b>of</b> <b>hair</b> {{dynamics}} greatly {{enrich the}} visual attractiveness of human characters. Traditional simulation techniques handle hair as clumps or continuum for efficiency; however, the visual quality is limited because they cannot represent the fine-scale motion <b>of</b> individual <b>hair</b> <b>strands.</b> Although a recent mass-spring approach tackled {{the problem of}} simulating the dynamics <b>of</b> every <b>strand</b> <b>of</b> <b>hair,</b> it required a complicated setting of springs and suffered from high computational cost. In this paper, we base the animation <b>of</b> <b>hair</b> on such a fine-scale on Lattice Shape Matching (LSM), which has been successfully used for simulating deformable objects. Our method regards each <b>strand</b> <b>of</b> <b>hair</b> as a chain of particles, and computes geometrically derived forces for the chain based on shape matching. Each chain of particles is simulated as an individual <b>strand</b> <b>of</b> <b>hair.</b> Our method can easily handle complex hairstyles such as curly or afro styles in a numerically stable way. While our method is not physically based, our GPU-based simulator achieves visually plausible animations consisting of several tens <b>of</b> thousands <b>of</b> <b>hair</b> <b>strands</b> at interactive rates...|$|R

25|$|Many {{similarities}} {{exist between}} the burial of the mummies and some present-day Lebanese burials. For example, one of the infants had long <b>strands</b> <b>of</b> <b>hair</b> between its toes. According to local tradition {{in some areas of}} Lebanon today, a mother whose child dies will pull out her hair in lamentation while kissing the feet of her deceased child. Similarly, today in Lebanon, when the last member of a family dies, the key to the family house is thrown over the roof, indicating that no one will live in the house again. The presence of a key in the 'Asi-al Hadath cave may also indicate that the last member of a family had died there as well.|$|E

50|$|Hair {{follows a}} {{specific}} growth cycle with three distinct and concurrent phases: anagen, catagen, and telogen phases.

25|$|Artistically, Bradshaws are unusually {{advanced}} both in {{technique and}} style. Image processing {{has revealed that}} {{the outline of the}} Bradshaw figures are often painted first, then filled in. Engraving in the rock often follows the outlines of figures and may have served as a preliminary sketch which implies planning. Some faces of the figures are painted with anatomically correct features with enough detail to be considered portraits. Due to the fine detail and control found in the images, such as <b>strands</b> <b>of</b> <b>hair</b> painted in 1-2mm thicknesses, {{it has been suggested that}} feather quills may have been used as a technique to apply the paint to the rock walls; an imprint of a feather found at one site may support this possibility. No evidence has yet been found of any corrections or changes in composition during or after painting, while evidence of restoration have been found. In a detailed study of 66 Bradshaw panels, approximately 9% of the Bradshaw images have clearly been vandalized. Some were scratched with stones, some damaged by thrown stones, and some have been broken by hammering with large rocks.|$|E

500|$|According to {{at least}} one account, Caion first {{encountered}} Caragiale's irony when he sent him a couple of Symbolist poems. The senior writer picked up on their involuntary humor, and proceeded to ridicule Caion. Literary historian Tudor Vianu believes that Caion was especially infuriated when Caragiale's magazine, Moftul Român, made a public mockery of his Secessionist prose poem. In his gibe, Caragiale feigned enthusiasm about the young writer's debut. Parodying Caion, he suggested that the young poet carry on writing a [...] "lyrical-decadent-symbolist-mystical-capillary-secessionist" [...] novel about a hairdressers' art society, whose members glue <b>strands</b> <b>of</b> <b>hair</b> onto canvasses or carve soap into human figures.|$|E

500|$|Senior Software Engineer Dr. Kelly Ward, a hair {{simulation}} {{major and}} {{graduate from the}} University of North Carolina, was placed in charge of developing special software meant to assist the animators in animating 70 to 75feet of hair. Ward revealed that, in real life, the character's hair would weigh roughly 60 pounds, [...] "more weight than a real person {{would be able to}} move around as effortlessly as we allow Rapunzel to do in the movie". For simplicity sake, the animators reduced the realistic total of 100,000 individual <b>strands</b> <b>of</b> <b>hair</b> found on a typical human head to a more manageable 100 for Rapunzel. Acquiring the unique but realistic shade of golden blonde for Rapunzel's hair also proved challenging animators.|$|E

It {{features}} Robin {{and his friend}} Benjamin venturing into the world, running into miserable EU representatives, bullying pub patrons, a prostitute, two kissing leathermen, a drug addict, deranged businessmen, mermaids and an angel who plays table tennis with Robin. The band appears in cameo at a bar, where they are shown drinking while watching {{a man with a}} head coming out of his belly dancing on their table. However, in this cameo only the versions of Yorke and Jonny Greenwood resemble themselves; O'Brien said [...] "If you freeze-frame it on the video, the guy with the five <b>strands</b> <b>of</b> <b>hair</b> slicked back, that's Colin. It looks nothing like him." [...] Colin Greenwood said [...] "there was no way that we could appear in it to perform in it because that would be so Spinal Tap" [...] and that having animations that did not resemble the band members allowed the video to be [...] "twisted and colorful which is how the song is anyway". Yorke was ultimately pleased with the video, saying that it [...] "is really about the violence around , which is exactly like the song. Not the same specific violence as in the lyrics, but everything going on around him is deeply troubling and violent, but he's just drinking himself into oblivion. He's there, but he's not there. That's why it works. And that's why it does my head in every time I see it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Disney's {{most recent}} work on animating fur {{was for the}} titular {{character}} of the 2008 film Bolt, but the software they had used {{at the time was}} not ready for creating the realistic fur of the animals of Zootopia. Therefore, the studio's IT engineers developed the fur-controlling software iGroom, which gave character designers precise control over the brushing, shaping and shading of fur and made it possible to create a variety of eccentric character styles for each animal. The software was also able to control an unseen [...] "imaginary" [...] underlayer that gave fur a degree of plushness not seen before. This feature was used to create characters like Officer Clawhauser, who has a big head that is entirely made of spotted fur. Characters with noteworthy numbers of <b>strands</b> <b>of</b> <b>hair</b> or fur included both of the two lead characters, Judy Hopps and Nick Wilde, who each had around 2.5 million hairs; a giraffe with nine million strands of fur; a gerbil with 480,000 strands; and a rodent with more <b>strands</b> <b>of</b> <b>hair</b> than the 400,000 that were on Elsa's head in Frozen.|$|E

2500|$|Traditionally, it was {{believed}} that in order to create dreadlocks, an individual had to refrain from brushing, combing or cutting. This lack of hair grooming results in what is called [...] "free form" [...] or [...] "neglect" [...] dreads, where the hair matts together slowly of its own accord. Such dreads tend to vary greatly in size, width, shape, length, and texture. If the wearer is interested in any uniformity of their dreads, they must pull the matted <b>strands</b> <b>of</b> <b>hair</b> apart to ensure large clumps don't form. In addition, if the wearer wishes for their dreads to be neat and tight, they must continue to separate the matted sections of hair and palm roll them regularly for a period of between [...] 6 to 12 months before their hair is well locked. Generally with this free form dread style, the dreads will remain loose and fluffy until the process of long term rolling has tightened them and they have reached a mature status. Until they reach this mature status, they are at risk of coming open especially with lots of water immersion (showers, swimming or washing). [...] Many people use products or wax to assist in the locking process. More over to help with the locking process people turn to using sea salt spray or natural sea salt to dry the hair and accelerate the matting process.|$|E
2500|$|In 2001, convicted serial rapist and murderer Matias Reyes {{was already}} {{serving a life}} {{sentence}} for other crimes, but he was not at that point a suspect in the Central Park attack on Meili.

[...] In 2002, Reyes declared that he was 17 years old on the night of April 19, 1989 when he assaulted and raped the jogger. [...] He said that he had acted alone. At the time of the attack, he was working at an East Harlem bodega on Third Avenue and 102nd Street, and living in a van on the street. He provided a detailed account of the attack, details of which were corroborated by other evidence. The DNA evidence confirmed his participation in the rape, identifying him as the sole contributor of the semen found in and on the victim [...] "to a factor of one in 6,000,000,000 people". DNA analysis of the <b>strands</b> <b>of</b> <b>hair</b> found in Richardson's underpants established that the hair did not belong to the victim. The victim had been tied up with her T-shirt in a distinctive fashion that Reyes used again on later victims. Reyes was not prosecuted because the statute of limitations had passed, and thus his admissions did not place him at further risk. Reyes had been convicted of raping four other women and killing one of them, and a defense psychiatrist in his trial had concluded that Reyes was not capable of telling the truth.|$|E
