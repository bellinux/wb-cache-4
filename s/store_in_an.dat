25|$|Deciding {{to retail}} the Lorna Jane label themselves, in 1990, Smith and Clarkson opened their first <b>store,</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> upper floor of Brisbane's Broadway on the Mall {{shopping}} centre. Early successes confirmed for Smith {{the viability of}} her dream. The business covered its first week of rent with its first day of sales, and in 1991, a customer bought the entire stock of the second Lorna Jane store in a single purchase of $25,000 {{with the intention of}} reselling it. Smith and Clarkson were ecstatic at the windfall, until they realised that this meant they had no stock left. The story of Clarkson riding back to Smith's workshop on a bicycle with $25,000 cash in a bag has become a famous anecdote about the early successes of the business.|$|E

500|$|In 1994, Brunner also {{represented}} neighbors {{of an adult}} video store that was being razed {{to make way for}} a McDonald's <b>store</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> affluent neighborhood. [...] She obtained a 14-day restraining order to halt issuance of a zoning certificate and demolition and building permits. [...] The Bexley, OH neighborhood hosts the Ohio Governor's Mansion and mansions once owned by Hustler publisher Larry Flynt and The Limited chairman Les Wexner. [...] She got citizens to appear before the zoning appeals board to attempt to stop the construction. The Citizens were unsuccessful in convincing the Board of Zoning Appeals to change their earlier decisions. [...] After the citizens were unsuccessful with the zoning board, they pursued remedy in the Franklin County Common Pleas Court. [...] In addition to the court proceedings, the citizens sought the attention of the City Council in attempt to preserve the neighborhood by keeping the video store from being converted into a McDonald's. [...] On April 7, 1995, Brunner gained a verdict for her clients that in the interest of avoiding traffic congestion and pedestrian dangers, the McDonald's would not be allowed to build. [...] The developer attempted to appeal the decision by obtaining friend-of-the-court briefs from surrounding municipalities. The Franklin County Appeals Court overturned the lower court ruling making way for the construction of the McDonald's. [...] Brunner's clients appealed to the Ohio Supreme Court. However, the Supreme Court declined to hear the case. [...] A few other cases against the developers remained in some lower courts. [...] However, these were unsuccessful. [...] After the lower court zoning victory, in May 1995, she was hired to oppose a [...] project.|$|E
