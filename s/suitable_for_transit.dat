5000|$|By 1942, Hitler's empire {{encompassed}} much of Europe, but {{the territories}} annexed lacked population desired by the Nazis. After Germany had acquired her Lebensraum, she now needed to populate these lands according to Nazi ideology and racial principles. This {{was to be}} accomplished {{before the end of}} the war by a [...] "reordering of ethnographical relations". The initial step of this project had already been taken by Hitler on 7 October 1939, when Himmler was named the Reich Commissar for the Consolidation of Germandom (Reichskommissar für die Festigung deutschen Volkstums) (RKFDV) (see also Hauptamt Volksdeutsche Mittelstelle, VoMi) This position authorized Himmler to repatriate ethnic Germans (Volksdeutsche) living abroad to occupied Poland. Himmler's jurisdiction as the guardian of the Volksdeutsche re-settlement efforts was increased to other occupied territories to be Germanized as the war continued. To make room for the German settlers, hundreds of thousands of Poles and French living in these lands were transferred across borders. The great majority of Himmler's Volksdeutsche were acquired from the Soviet sphere of interest under the German-Soviet [...] "population exchange" [...] treaty.At the end of 1942 a total of 629,000 Volksdeutsche had been re-settled, and preparations for the transfer of 393,000 others were underway. The long-term goal of the VoMi was the resettlement of a further 5.4 million Volksdeutsche, mainly from Transylvania, Banat, France, Hungary and Romania. The immigrants were classified either as racially or politically unreliable (settled in Altreich), of high quality (settled in the annexed eastern territories) or <b>suitable</b> <b>for</b> <b>transit</b> camps. Himmler encountered considerable difficulties with the Volksdeutsche of France and Luxembourg, who often wished retain their former status as citizens of their respective countries.|$|E
40|$|This work {{describes}} the observations and results found from a photometric survey of a 0. 5 ° by 0. 5 ° {{area of the}} Galactic Plane performed using the 2. 2 metre ESO telescope at La Silla, Chile. The dataset comprises a total of 267 images with 204 from a 16 day observation run in 2005 and 63 from a six week observation run in 2002. The new image subtraction reduction algorithm implemented on this data resulted in more than 500, 000 lightcurves with a magnitude limit of R ~ 24. 5. The precision of the data following reduction is <b>suitable</b> <b>for</b> <b>transit</b> searches as well as identification of variable stars. Resulting from the transit search was an initial list of 31 candidates, reducing to 23 on further examination. Nine candidates were eliminated by examination of the images and the remaining list re-reduced. After this reduction three good candidates remain. These candidates have periods from 1. 2840 to 2. 6269 days and depths of around 75 mmags. These three candidates require followup of either multi-colour photometry or spectroscopy to determine their nature. The variable star search resulted in detections of 1475 variable stars of different types. The largest portion were eclipsing binary stars. A number of the contact binaries have possible low mass-ratios {{and there are also}} a number of contact and detached binaries which may contain low-mass components. Three of the contact binaries were found to have periods at the known period cut off including two with periods lower than any previously published. Also identified were two possible pre-main sequence detached eclipsing binaries. The binary fraction of the field was calculated from the observed contact binaries to be 46 % ± 4 %. There are a number of possibilities for further data mining of the survey...|$|E

40|$|This papers {{illustrates}} a feasibility study aimed at: analysing the actual city logistics in the Limited Traffic Area of Florence; evaluating {{to what extent}} the Transit Point solution could optimize parcel delivery and its repercussions on traffic flow in the historic centre of Florence; identifying a <b>suitable</b> location <b>for</b> <b>Transit</b> Point infrastructures, and examining economic and normative aspects of the proposal. Particular attention has been given to assessing the economic sustainability of the Transit Point, under the hypothesis that areas, infrastructures and vehicles will be publicly financed, and that the Transit Point will have to find the resources to remunerate the new company through the reduction of vehicles and workers. A model for corporate governance <b>for</b> the <b>Transit</b> Point has also been proposed, in addition to a model of planning and control for proper accountability. The study demonstrates that the realization of the Transit Point would allow for: a reduction in traffic congestion in the historic centre; attainment of a positive EBIT through public financing of the structures; a continuance of the service without changing transport or remuneration costs; an improvement of the working conditions...|$|R
25|$|In 1976 Vought {{was awarded}} a $7 million {{contract}} by the Urban Mass Transit Administration to study modifications needed to produce a version of Airtrans <b>suitable</b> <b>for</b> mass <b>transit</b> applications. Changes were aimed primarily at increasing the speed from 17 to 30mph, along with changes to reduce capital costs of implementing systems. Vought used one of the production cargo vehicles as an instrumented testbed, running it on the existing DFW guideways at increased speeds, and used the information collected to determine what changes {{would need to be}} made to provide this performance in an operational setting. Several changes were needed; the power collection arms that pressed against the wires on the track side had to be modified to a design originally considered for the DFW system, the steering had to be upgraded in order to switch quickly enough, and to improve energy use, the new vehicles also featured regenerative braking. A non-mechanical steering system reading a ferrous stripe {{in the center of the}} guideway was also tried, but abandoned as not necessary for speeds up to 30mph.|$|R
40|$|The study {{aimed to}} {{demonstrate}} satisfactory inter-UK transit of cold storage clinical trial material. The product environment {{had to be}} maintained between 0 and 8 degrees C throughout transit until delivery. Straightforward, low cost and simplified shipping arrangements were sought that would be appropriate for small-scale Phase I clinical trial activities. A laboratory test defined an optimal three frozen gel pack configuration to maintain refrigerated environmental conditions for dummy product packs in a single type and size of insulated shipper. The internal environment was temperature monitored at 30 -min intervals in all tests. Twelve Glasgow to London transits were then studied over 2 years to include all seasonal temperature variations. A configuration using three frozen gel packs and 4 h pre-chill of the transit container maintained the internal environment at 0 - 8 degrees C for up to 48 h during autumn, winter and spring. A modified four frozen gel pack configuration was <b>suitable</b> <b>for</b> summer <b>transit.</b> Thus cold shipment verification was successfully carried out for a small-scale distribution operation. It was proven that refrigerated shipping conditions could be maintained using a straightforward and cost effective 'passive' type system consisting of frozen gel packs and insulated transit containers.

40|$|Transit {{agencies}} {{seeking to}} improve transit service delivery are increasingly considering {{the deployment of}} transit signal priority (TSP). However, the impact of TSP on transit service and on the general traffic stream {{is a function of}} many factors, including intersection geometry, signal timings, traffic demands, TSP strategies and parameters, transit vehicle headways, timing when transit vehicles arrive at the intersection, etc. Previous studies have shown that depending on these factors, the net impact of TSP in terms of vehicle or person delay can be positive or negative. Furthermore, due to financial constraints, transit agencies are often able to deploy TSP at only a portion of all of the candidate intersections. Consequently, {{there is a need to}} estimate the impact of TSP prior to implementation in order to assist in determining at which intersections TSP should be deployed. Currently, the impacts of TSP are often estimated using microscopic simulation models. However, the application of these models is resource intensive and requires specialized expertise that is often not available in-house to transit agencies. In this thesis, an analytical model was proposed for estimating the delay impacts of green extension and early green (red truncation) TSP strategies. The proposed model is validated with analytical model reported in the literature and microscopic simulation model. This is followed by model sensitivity analysis. A software module is developed using the proposed model. The usefulness of the model is illustrated through its application to estimate the TSP performance. Finally, a prioritization is conducted on sixteen intersections with different geometric and operational traffic strategies. The overall results indicate that the proposed model is <b>suitable</b> <b>for</b> both estimating the pre-deployment and post-deployment TSP performance. The proposed model is <b>suitable</b> <b>for</b> implementation within a spreadsheet and requires considerably less effort, and less technical expertise, to apply than a typical micro-simulation model and therefore is a more <b>suitable</b> tool <b>for</b> <b>transit</b> agencies to use for prioritising TSP deployment...|$|R

40|$|The Characterizing Exoplanets Satellite (CHEOPS) {{mission is}} planned for launch next year with a major {{objective}} being to search <b>for</b> <b>transits</b> of known RV planets, particularly those orbiting bright stars. Since the radial velocity method is only sensitive to planetary mass, the radii, transit depths and transit signal-to-noise values of each RV planet are, a-priori, unknown. Using an empirically calibrated probabilistic mass-radius relation, forecaster (Chen & Kipping 2017 a), we address this by predicting a catalog of homogeneous credible intervals for these three keys terms for 468 planets discovered via radial velocities. Of these, {{we find that the}} vast majority should be detectable with CHEOPS, including terrestrial bodies, if they have the correct geometric alignment.
