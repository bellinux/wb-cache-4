5000|$|Early sewing {{machines}} of the 19th century oscillate their shuttles {{back and forth}} on horizontal tracks—an arrangement called a [...] "transverse shuttle". A vibrating <b>shuttle</b> <b>machine,</b> by contrast, 'vibrates' its shuttle in a circular arc. This movement represents less total mechanical motion, which means less friction, less wear, higher maximum speed, and higher reliability than in a transverse shuttle system.|$|E
5000|$|The first {{versions}} of the White Sewing Machine [...] used a [...] "boat" [...] shuttle that was comparable to those used in contemporary transverse shuttle machines. In 1886 the shuttle was changed to a bullet shape, with a thin rod in the interior upon which the bobbin rotates. The change was probably prompted by the bullet shuttle used in the new Singer Vibrating <b>Shuttle</b> <b>machine,</b> invented the year before, itself a derivative of the White machine. Still later, the shuttle was refined again for the Peerless machines.|$|E
50|$|Rotary and hook-based {{designs are}} {{superior}} {{because they do}} not cause their sewing machine to shake and 'walk' the way that vibrating and transverse shuttles do. Vibrating <b>shuttle</b> <b>machines</b> nevertheless remained in production until the 1960s.|$|R
50|$|In 1885 Singer {{patented}} the Singer Vibrating <b>Shuttle</b> sewing <b>machine,</b> {{which used}} Allen B. Wilson's {{idea for a}} vibrating shuttle and was a better lockstitcher than the oscillating shuttles of the time. Millions of the machines, perhaps the world's first really practical sewing machine for domestic use, were produced until finally superseded by rotary <b>shuttle</b> <b>machines</b> in the 20th century. Sewing machines continued being made to roughly the same design, with more lavish decoration appearing {{until well into the}} 1900s.|$|R

50|$|Most shuttle {{machines}} {{have two}} arms that move the molds {{back and forth}} between the heating chamber and cooling station. The arms are independent of each other and they turn the molds bi-axially. In some cases, the <b>shuttle</b> <b>machine</b> has only one arm. This machine moves the mold in a linear direction in and out of heating and cooling chambers. It is low in cost for the size of product produced and the footprint is kept to a minimum compared to other types of machines. It is also available in smaller scale for schools and prototyping.|$|E
5000|$|On {{the same}} day, August 12, Isaac M. Singer {{received}} his first patent on a transverse <b>shuttle</b> <b>machine</b> {{that became a}} formidable competitor. A new partnership was now formed, {{under the name of}} Wheeler, Wilson & Co., and in 1853 the Wheeler & Wilson Manufacturing Co. was organized. On Dec. 19, 1854, Mr. Wilson received US patent 12116 for his [...] "four-motion feed", which the machines of other inventors were forced to adopt. The advantage of his improvements was that the stitching made the strongest possible seam, being exactly even on both sides, with no threads showing above the surface that would be liable to wear oft and cause ripping. The first completed machine—that finished in 1851—sold for $125.|$|E
50|$|The {{technology}} {{was invented by}} Allen B. Wilson in 1851, in steps. Wilson had just left an unsatisfactory business relationship in order to partner with Nathaniel Wheeler, who was impressed by a model of Wilson's vibrating <b>shuttle</b> <b>machine.</b> Ever since developing the aforementioned, Wilson had been ruminating on {{a plan for a}} machine that used a rotating hook combined with a traditional reciprocating bobbin. For this hybrid machine he received patent , (reissued as RE914 on 28 February 1860).Knowing that such a machine would surely lead to patent litigation with his former partners who had bought out the patent for the vibrating shuttle, Wilson kept working, and developed a refined design which kept the bobbin stationary. He filed for patent, and the partners built their first production rotary hook machine the same year, selling it for USD35 (USD891 adjusted). The next year patent , was awarded.|$|E
50|$|Rapier {{machines}} weave {{more rapidly}} than most <b>shuttle</b> <b>machines</b> but more slowly than most other projectile machines. An important advantage of rapier machines is their flexibility, which permits the laying of picks of different colours. They also weave yarns of any type of fibre and can weave fabrics up to 110 inches in width without modification.|$|R

50|$|In 1966 {{the company}} was listed on the Brussels Stock Exchange. At the ITMA {{exhibition}} in Paris in 1971, Picañol exhibited the MDC, the world’s first electronically controlled flying <b>shuttle</b> <b>machine.</b> In 1989 the foundry division was split off from the other activities and made into a separate company, Proferro NV. Also in 1989 Picanol became part owner {{in what was then}} Protronic (now PsiControl Mechatronics). In 1993 Picanol achieved ISO 9001 certification, as a guarantee of the quality of its products and services. Verbrugge NV in Belgium and Steel Heddle Inc. in the USA were acquired in 2001. They were followed in 2002 by Te Strake Textile in the Netherlands and Lhenry in France. In 2003 among others Burcklé in France joined the group, while GTP Bandung was set up in Indonesia, GTP São Paulo in Brazil and GTP in Mexico. In 2004 a controversy arose concerning the remuneration of the former President & CEO, Jan Coene, whose greed had a very negative influence on the health of the company. After a turbulent period (the Picanol Scandal), Chris Dewulf was chosen as the new President & CEO of the Picanol Group in 2005, and a new Board of Directors was appointed. In 2007, the company launched the new OptiMax and GT-Max rapier weaving machines.|$|E
50|$|There was a {{particular}} goal in cross-training civil specialists. In the classless society of the Soviet Union every individual was guaranteed a job. In so doing, those individuals that have a job, have a dual function. Truck drivers for example, worked for whatever organization their job is associated with; they could be drivers who <b>shuttle</b> <b>machine</b> parts from their factory in Kiev to outlying areas, {{but they were also}} registered with the local civilian transport enterprise (Avtokolonna) who receive requirements from the local Military commissariat (Voenkomat) for a designated number of trucks for mobilization or {{a particular}} military exercise. As these drivers are well trained and are driving a truck that they have driven many times before (civilian trucks are identical to the military version - one could do a one-for-one exchange and not suffer any decrement of the mission) the system works out very well. The commanders who are receiving these drivers with their trucks, know exactly how many vehicles they will receive, where they're coming from, their license numbers, and the driver's name. The same is applicable {{for the rest of the}} civil specialties, such as medics, mechanics, radio operators, telegraph operators or even jewelers, as well as many others.|$|E
5000|$|Within {{a couple}} of years Scientific American took notice, and printed the {{following}} praise for Whitehill's design, especially for its powertrain: Of Vibrating ShuttlesThese are shuttles of the long description, moving in a segment of a circle. There are several varieties. The most novel machine of this kind is the vibrating <b>shuttle</b> <b>machine</b> just produced by the Singer Manufacturing Company. In this case the shuttle itself consists of a steel tube, into the open end of which the wound reel is dropped, and is free to revolve quite loosely. Variation of tension is thus obviated in a very simple manner. The chief point of interest in the machine is undoubtedly the means employed in transferring the motion from the main shaft to the underneath parts, an arrangement as ingenious and effective as any device ever introduced into stitching mechanism. It is the invention of Mr. Robert Whitehall sic, and consists of a vertical rocking shaft situated in the arm of the machine. Motion is imparted to it by means of an elbow formed upon the main shaft acting upon two arms, called wipers, projecting from the rocking shaft, the angle formed by the arms exactly coinciding with that of the elbow in its revolution.This admirable motion will no doubt attract much attention from mechanists and engineers.|$|E
5000|$|The Singer 'New Family' Sewing Machine was a {{transverse}} <b>shuttle</b> sewing <b>machine</b> {{produced by}} the Singer Manufacturing Company {{during the middle of}} the 19th century. It established Singer's reputation as a manufacturer of reliable [...] "low arm" [...] sewing machines.|$|R
50|$|Its {{machines}} {{are used for}} many applications in the wood, furniture, and cabinet industries, but are also used for other well-known products. Its products are also used to create the interior of commercial airliners, helicopter blades, parts for military aircraft, and underlayment for space <b>shuttles.</b> Its <b>machines</b> create parts for bowling alleys, bicycle helmets, spas, motorcycle parts, and truck bodies. They are also used on Broadway sets, including Batman, Jurassic Park 3, and Star Wars.|$|R

50|$|In {{addition}} to the original machines, Lancashire Museums also display other textile machines they own or are restoring, and weave some specialist commissions.One of the commissions is a blue and white shirting that is sold exclusively to 'Old Town' of Holt, Norfolk, who produce Victorian workware. Another is weaving woollen Jewish prayer shawls. There is a large Hattersley Standard Loom, and a treadle operated Hattersley Domestic Loom. There is a Sulzer, and a Saurer telescopic rapier loom that operates at 180 picks per minute. There {{is a collection of}} <b>shuttles</b> and <b>machines</b> used to make and maintain them. Also, there are machines for making reeds and healds.|$|R
50|$|Since {{dovetail}} slides {{have such}} a large surface contact area, a greater force is required to move the saddle than other linear slides, which results in slower acceleration rates. Additionally, dovetail slides have difficulties with high-friction but are advantageous {{when it comes to}} load capacity, affordability and durability. Capable of long travel, dovetail slides are more resistant to shock than other bearings, and they are mostly immune to chemical, dust and dirt contamination. Dovetail slides can be motorized, mechanical or electromechanical. Electric dovetail slides are driven by a number of different devices, such as ball screws, belts and cables, which are powered by functional motors such as stepper motors, linear motors and handwheels. Dovetail slides are direct contact systems, making them fitting for heavy load applications including CNC <b>machines,</b> <b>shuttle</b> devices, special <b>machines</b> and work holding devices. Mainly used in the manufacturing and laboratory science industries, dovetail slides are ideal for high-precision applications.|$|R
50|$|In 1889 the {{embroidery}} entrepreneur, Max Vollstädt, built a {{house in}} an underdeveloped district of Plauen called Reusa. Until {{the turn of the}} century, it was used as a contract machine embroidery business. In 1902 during the boom in the Plauen embroidery industry, Vollstädt expanded his embroidery business. He ordered the construction of a one-story courtyard building to accommodate 10 <b>shuttle</b> embroidery <b>machines.</b> In keeping with the embroidery manufacturing methods developed during this time, he constructed his new building with windows, up-to-date layout, and transport lanes for the embroidery goods he produced. Over the following decades the ownership of this business changed hands several times, but the original intent of this business to produce embroidery remained the same, including the original home and work areas.|$|R

We call it a MSWS-system, which is made up of a series of <b>machines,</b> <b>shuttles,</b> a warehouse and again shuttles. We applied a hybrid approach, i. e. which is a combination of a completely centralized and a totally decentralized approach. A controller supervises two MSWS-Systems and intervenes only in exceptional cases. On account of an increasing significance of the human factor in manufacturing systems, each machine operator is endowed with a user profile. ...|$|R
50|$|As {{a result}} of his work as a design {{engineer}} at the Kappel embroidery machine factory, Zahn was familiar with the technology of a <b>shuttle</b> embroidery <b>machine</b> operating according to the system introduced by Isaac Gröbli. During his time in Switzerland, he had got to know the further development work to produce automatic embroidery machines with a jacquard loom mechanism, which were controlled using a punched tape. At that time, the automatic machines were made in line with the patents of J. Arnold Gröbli, a son of Isaak Gröbli, by Kursheedt Manufacturing Co. in the USA for the automated embroidery factory in Rorschach. As Zahn had successfully worked on optimising the Gröbli automatic embroidery machines in Switzerland, an exclusive licensing deal was signed between Feldmühle AG in Rorschach and VOMAG in Plauen in 1900 to manufacture automatic embroidery machines. This marked the start of the Plauen engineering company’s rise to become the world’s largest producer of embroidery machines.|$|R
2500|$|Rotaxane-based {{molecular}} machines {{have been}} of initial interest for their potential use in molecular electronics as logic molecular switching elements and as molecular <b>shuttles.</b> These molecular <b>machines</b> are usually based on {{the movement of the}} macrocycle on the dumbbell. The macrocycle can rotate around the axis of the dumbbell like a wheel and axle or it can slide along its axis from one site to another. Controlling the position of the macrocycle allows the rotaxane to function as a molecular switch, with each possible location of the macrocycle corresponding to a different state. These rotaxane machines can be manipulated both by chemical [...] and photochemical inputs. Rotaxane based systems have also been shown to function as molecular muscles. In 2009, there was a report of a [...] "domino effect" [...] from one extremity to the other in a Glycorotaxane Molecular Machine. In this case, the 4C1 or 1C4 chair-like conformation of the mannopyranoside stopper can be controlled, depending on the localization of the macrocycle. In 2012, unique pseudo-macrocycles consisting of double-lasso molecular machines (also called rotamacrocycles) were reported in Chem. Sci. These structures can be tightened or loosened depending on pH. A controllable jump rope movement was also observed in these new molecular machines.|$|R
40|$|Raising of problem. A {{bulldozer}} work at trench refilings {{is conducted}} by cyclic, <b>machine</b> <b>shuttle</b> motions that increases a right-of-way; increasing of time charges, fuel and labour {{by the side}} of the continuous refilling method. Besides the indicated defects gets worse also the quality of the trench refilling: the uneven soil output into a trench with large portions results the damages of pipes isolation and emptinesses formation, in consequence  settling and washing of soil. A bulldozer with the screw intensifier (SI), is deprived lacks of an odinary bulldozer  moving along a trench, it moves the loose soil that does not fall on a pipeline, but rolles on it. Thus the circuitous speed of a cutting edge of SI exceeds the speed of the base machine moving that provides the strong soil treatment (before dispersion) before output into a trench. Purpose. The algorithm development of the rotational moment determination on the SI driveshaft, the consumable energy, the energy intensity and the working process productivity of the reverse trench refillings depending on physical and mechanical properties of soil, geometrical parameters of SI and bulldozer optimal speed. Conclusion. The developed algorithm allows to define that at the fixed value of the rotational speed the rotational moment and indicated efficiency of SI at the optimum speed increasing of the base machine change on a linear law; the optimum speed change of the base machine practically does not influence on the energy intensity at the considered change of the rotational speed...|$|R
