50|$|<b>Salt</b> <b>baths</b> utilize {{a variety}} of salts for heat treatment, with cyanide salts being the most {{extensively}} used. Concerns about associated occupation health and safety, and expensive waste management and disposal due to their environmental effects has made the use of <b>salt</b> <b>baths</b> less attractive in recent years.

50|$|Molten <b>salt</b> <b>baths</b> {{belong to}} the oldest thermal {{cleaning}} systems. Cleaning with molten salt is fast: 15 to 30 minutes process time. The process has the risk of dangerous splatters due to chemical reactivity, or other potential hazards, like explosions or toxic hydrogen cyanide gas. Another disadvantage is that parts can be warped or altered in design tolerances. Molten <b>salt</b> <b>baths</b> can be environmentally unfriendly. Due to their disadvantages, they are rarely used today.|$|R

25|$|Gaseous {{ferritic}} nitrocarburizing is {{also known}} as controlled nitrocarburizing, soft nitriding, and vacuum nitrocarburizing or by the tradenames Nitrotec, Nitemper, Deganit, Triniding, Corr-I-Dur, Nitroc, NITREG-C and Nitrowear, Nitroneg.

25|$|The process uses a <b>salt</b> <b>bath</b> of alkali cyanate. This is {{contained}} in a steel pot that has an aeration system. The cyanate thermally reacts with {{the surface of the}} workpiece to form alkali carbonate. The bath is then treated to convert the carbonate back to a cyanate. The surface formed from the reaction has a compound layer and a diffusion layer. The compound layer consists of iron, nitrogen, and oxygen, is abrasion resistant, and stable at elevated temperatures. The diffusion layer contains nitrides and carbides. The surface hardness ranges from 800 to 1500 HV depending on the steel grade. This also inversely affects the depth of the case; i.e. a high carbon steel will form a hard, but shallow case.|$|E
25|$|The Tenifer process {{produces}} a matte gray-colored, nonglare {{surface with a}} 64 Rockwell C hardness rating and a 99% resistance to salt water corrosion (which meets or exceeds stainless steel specifications), making the Glock particularly suitable for individuals carrying the pistol concealed as the highly chloride-resistant finish allows the pistol to better endure the effects of perspiration. Glock steel parts using the Tenifer treatment are more corrosion resistant than analogous gun parts having other finishes or treatments, including Teflon, bluing, hard chrome plating, or phosphates. During 2010 Glock switched from the <b>salt</b> <b>bath</b> nitriding Tenifer process to a not exactly disclosed gas nitriding process. After applying the nitriding process, a black Parkerized decorative surface finish is applied. The underlying nitriding treatment will remain, protecting these parts even if the decorative surface finish were to wear off.|$|E

2500|$|Plasma-assisted {{ferritic}} nitrocarburizing is {{also known}} as ion nitriding, plasma ion nitriding or glow-discharge nitriding. The process works to achieve the same result as the <b>salt</b> <b>bath</b> and gaseous process, except the reactivity of the media is not due to the temperature but to the gas ionized state. In this technique intense electric fields are used to generate ionized molecules of the gas around the surface to diffuse the nitrogen and carbon into the workpiece. Such highly active gas with ionized molecules is called plasma, naming the technique. The gas used for plasma nitriding is usually pure nitrogen, since no spontaneous decomposition is needed (as is the case of gaseous ferritic nitrocarburizing with ammonia). Due to the relatively low temperature range ( [...] to [...] ) generally applied during plasma-assisted ferritic nitrocarburizing and gentle cooling in the furnace, the distortion of workpieces can be minimized. Stainless steel workpieces can be processed at moderate temperatures (like [...] ) without the formation of chromium nitride precipitates and hence maintaining their corrosion resistance properties.|$|E
