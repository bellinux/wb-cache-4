40|$|A novel {{switched}} excitation {{method for}} linear frequency modulated excitation of ultrasonic transducers in pulse compression systems is presented that is simple to realise, yet provides reduced signal sidelobes at {{the output of}} the matched filter compared to bipolar pseudo-chirp excitation. Pulse compression signal sidelobes are reduced through the use of simple amplitude tapering {{at the beginning and end}} of the excitation duration. Amplitude tapering using switched excitation is realised through the use of intermediate voltage switching levels, half that of the main excitation voltages. In total five excitation voltages are used creating a quinary excitation system. The absence of analogue signal generation and power amplifiers renders the excitation method attractive for applications with requirements such as a high channel count or low cost per channel. A systematic study of switched linear frequency modulated excitation methods with simulated and laboratory based experimental verification is presented for 2. 25 MHz non-destructive testing immersion transducers. The signal to sidelobe noise level of compressed waveforms generated using quinary and bipolar pseudo-chirp excitation are investigated for transmission through a 0. 5 m water and kaolin <b>slurry</b> <b>channel.</b> Quinary linear frequency modulated excitation consistently reduces signal sidelobe power compared to bipolar excitation methods. Experimental results for transmission between two 2. 25 MHz transducers separated by a 0. 5 m channel of water and 5 % kaolin suspension shows improvements in signal to sidelobe noise power in the order of 7 - 8 dB. The reported quinary switched method for linear frequency modulated excitation provides improved performance compared to pseudo-chirp excitation without the need for high performance excitation amplifiers...|$|E
40|$|Ammonia is a {{nuisance}} gas in many swine barns. The overall {{objective of this}} research project was to model ammonia formation and transmission processes in a grower-finisher swine barn, by first modelling the ammonia production and emission from urine puddles on the floor surface and the ammonia emission from the slurry pit, and then incorporating these emission rates in a dynamic model that separates the room and slurry pit headspace as two separate, but linked, control volumes. A series of studies were conducted to gather {{more information about the}} processes affecting the ammonia emission rate from the floor surface and the slurry that were later included in the overall room model developed. The model was then used to investigate ammonia reducing techniques and technologies based on the understanding of ammonia production and transmission incorporated in the model. The first step in modelling the ammonia emission rate from the floor surface was to determine the frequency of urinations by grower-finisher pigs. Male and female pigs were observed three times during their finishing phase to determine their urination frequency {{over the course of a}} day. The average measured urination frequency was 0. 62 ± 0. 11 urinations pig- 1 h- 1. A sinusoidal dromedary model was developed to describe the daily variation in urination frequency for male and female pigs between 51 and 78 kg. In order for the deposited urinations on the floor surface to emit ammonia, the urea in the urine must first be converted to ammonia and the urease enzyme catalyzes this reaction. Two methods, a fixed-time-point method using the indophenol assay for ammonium-nitrogen analysis and a continuous method using the coupled enzyme assay, were used to measure enzyme activity at the floor surface of a swine barn and were compared to reported urease activity levels in the literature. Using both methods, there appeared to be an ammonia-producing site on the floor surface or within the collected samples that made accurate measurements of urease activity impossible. A review of urease activity levels in the literature from dairy-cow houses suggest that urease activity will be lowest following floor-cleaning and increase quickly following fouling of the floor surface. Based on the literature review, a urease activity value of 5 g NH¬ 3 m- 2 h- 1 was suggested for use in ammonia emission modelling of fouled floor surfaces in swine barns until better measurements become available. The ammonia emissions from 36 simulated urine puddles under a variety of temperature, air velocity and initial urea concentration conditions were measured in a bench-scale experimental set-up. The measurements were used to calibrate and validate a dynamic, mechanistic, urine puddle emission model that considered the processes of evaporation, urea conversion, change in liquid concentration and puddle pH in order to simulate the amount of ammonia emitted from a puddle. Based on the correlation coefficients (R) between measured and simulated values for water volume (R= 0. 99), total ammoniacal nitrogen concentration (R= 0. 90), and total emission (R= 1. 00), along with five other statistical tests for each simulated variable, the model was deemed accurate. The measurements and simulations in this experiment showed the impact of puddle pH, urease activity and changing environmental conditions on the average puddle emission rate. Puddle emission continued to occur as long as there was still water. The impact of different slurry compositions on the ammonia emission rate from slurry pits was tested in another bench-scale experimental set-up with emission chambers. The emission chamber concentration data collected was used to calibrate and validate a developed slurry emission model. The collected slurry samples were concentrated mixtures of urine and feces from individually-housed animals fed different diets. An empirical equation was developed to express the amount of total ammoniacal nitrogen in the slurry that was in the form of ammonia (f) and thus volatile to the surroundings. Based on the empirical equation, the simulated value of f was between 0. 03 and 0. 08 and did not show the sensitivity to slurry pH that has been reported by other authors. The slurry emission model with the empirical equation for f was validated with ammonia emission measurements from eight different slurry samples and simulated hourly concentration measurements within 17 % and five-day average concentration measurements within 3 %. Further testing was recommended to ensure the model developed for concentrated manure in this study was applicable to the more dilute slurry found in swine barns. Using the information gained in the previous experiments, a mechanistic model describing the dynamic ammonia concentration in the room and in the <b>slurry</b> <b>channel</b> headspace of grower-finisher swine barns, as well as the ammonia emitted to the surrounding environment was developed. Data was collected from two grower-finisher rooms to use as input data to the model and for calibration and validation purposes. The model calibration procedure determined that the amount of emissions originating from the slurry for the simulated room conditions was generally less than 5 % of the total room emissions, the air exchange rate through the slatted floor was approximately 4 % of the room ventilation rate, and that in the first two weeks of animal activity in a room the urease activity at the floor surface will increase. The model was validated using separate data from that used in the calibration process. The model simulated hourly room concentration levels within 2. 2 ppm and 3 -day average concentration levels within 1. 6 ppm. The model simulations were more accurate for one room that was fed a typical grower-finisher diet compared to another room fed an experimental diet with lower protein content and sugar-beet pulp inclusion. The dynamic model was tested for its sensitivity to various input factors in terms of the floor emission rate, slurry emission rate and total emission rate. An interesting aspect of the simulations was that increases in either floor or surface emission rate were compensated to a small extent by decreases in the other emission rate as a result of a reduced concentration gradient for mass transfer. The ammonia emission rate from the floor was most sensitive to changes in urease activity, fouled floor area and puddle area. The ammonia emission rate from slurry was most sensitive to changes in slurry pH. The impact of input variables on the total emission rate was dependant on the simulated proportion of the total ammonia emission coming from either the floor surface or <b>slurry</b> <b>channel.</b> Three ammonia reduction techniques were tested and evaluated on their impact to the total ammonia emission rate from a room compared to a given set of control conditions. The work in this thesis highlighted the importance of ammonia emission from the floor surface. The proportion of ammonia originating from the slurry and from the floor surface respectively will vary on the specific conditions within the barn, and will impact the effect of any ammonia mitigation technique that is investigated or used...|$|E

40|$|RAMIRAN International ConferenceAnimal manures {{are rich}} in organic matter and nutrients, namely {{nitrogen}} (N) and, consequently, widely applied to soil as organic fertilizers. However, {{a large part of}} the nitrogen contained in animal manures is in the organic form and so not directly available for plants. Indeed, organic N has to be mineralized prior to plant uptake (Rees and Castle, 2002). Several manure characteristics as the C:N ratio (Chadwick et al., 2000), the lignin content (Kristensen, 1996) and the NH 4 +/organic N ratio (Beauchamp and Paul, 1989) have been suggested as indicators of the plant-available N. More recently, Fangueiro et al. (2008) showed that the potential of N mineralization (PNM) of cattle slurry is inversely correlated with slurry particle size: finest fractions are the particle-size fractions from which N mineralization occurs in slurries whereas coarser fractions are associated with immobilization. Furthermore, Moller et al. (2002) reported that animal diet and anaerobic decomposition during storage in <b>slurry</b> <b>channels</b> and stores affect the slurry particle size distribution. Such information is of great interest since the finest slurry particle size should infiltrate the soil more easily and quickly relative to the coarser slurry particle size that should remain close to soil surface. Furthermore, mechanical slurry separation is now performed in many pig and dairy farms in order to improve slurry management in terms of nutrients utilization and reducing costs related to slurry storage. Slurry separation by screw press leads to a nutrient rich organic solid fraction (0. 7 – 3. 2 mm particles) that may be composted and a liquid fraction that can be used for fertigation. In the present study, three types of slurry (pig, duck and cattle) were separated into 4 slurry particle size fractions (> 2000 um, 2000 - 500 um, 500 - 100 um, < 100 um) in order to assess the influence of the type of slurry and slurry particle size on the PNM after soil incorporation...|$|R

40|$|The {{hydraulic}} transport of suspensions is frequently encountered in industry. A typical example is mine tailings which is transported from the dewatering plant to the tailings disposal area {{through an open}} channel. In recent years, because of water shortages and environmental and economic issues, tailings system facilities are changing, and thickening of mineral processing plant tailings slurry to achieve high solids content at discharge is becoming common. As a consequence, with increasing concentration, tailings material becomes more viscous and non-Newtonian in nature, and its flow behaviour becomes complex {{and more difficult to}} predict. Thickened tailings transport is of significant importance in the design of tailings disposal management. Having been dewatered, tailings often travel a long distance to the disposal site. As long as the terrain allows gravity flow, one economical alternative to a pipeline is to utilize an open-top flume to convey the tailings material. The flume can be either artificial channel with commonly used cross sections (e. g. trapezoidal, rectangular, and semi-circular) or natural valley. The design of such a flume depends on the rheological characteristics and flow mechanism of thickened slurry. Therefore, understanding of free surface flow behaviour and characterisation of thickened tailings material is highly important to design the tailings management facilities appropriately. This knowledge is currently lacking and doesn&rsquo;t lead to generally accepted design procedure. This study focuses on the analysis of non-settling thickened tailings free surface flow. It was aimed at developing new approaches in artificial channels flow. The study covers laminar, transitional and turbulent regimes of fluid flow. Since the fluid mechanics, in general, is a fundamentally analytical-experimental engineering science, model development is based on the analytical analysis and the observation of non-Newtonian fluid flow through the semi-pilot constructed flume at RMIT University (4. 8 meters long 100 mm width). In the laminar regime, a new Reynolds number has been developed to predict the flow of non-Newtonian mining thickened tailings <b>slurries</b> in open <b>channels.</b> This model targets to appropriately evaluate the frictions forces caused by material viscosity in the laminar regime. For transitional and turbulent flows, two new analytical models have been developed. Unlike the existing models (Haldenwang and Slatter, 2006, Haldenwang et al., 2010, Burger et al., 2010 a, Burger et al., 2015), the new models have been analytically derived using the open channel velocity profile measured by Laser Doppler Anemometer (LDA) for a Newtonian fluid. It is believed that, in addition to the viscous sublayer existing in both pipe flow and open channel flows, two distinctive flow regions (1) inner (log law) and (2) outer are observed in an open channel flow, while on the other hand in the pipe flow only the inner region with logarithmic velocity profile is formed. Flow transitional from laminar to transition regimes are also studied. A new model is presented {{based on the assumption that}} at the limit of the transitional flow, the laminar shear velocity (approaches the turbulent regime shear velocity (. However, the transitions from the transition to the turbulent flow was not studied in this thesis. A new experimental data set has been compiled for this thesis. The experimental results along with 2 other independently collected sets, of relevant experimental data, i. e Haldenwang (2003) and Burger et. al. (2010), are used to validate the new models and the existing models reported in the literature. It was found that the new models, except the transitional loci determination model, provide a considerably better prediction over the existing models. In the laminar regime, it is shown that the newly defined Reynolds number achieves better estimation of the friction at the boundary and average velocity when compared with the experimental data. In the transitional and turbulent regimes, the new models give better flow behaviour prediction when compared to that of Haldenwang-Slatter (2010) model - even for the dataset from which the Haldenwang-Slatter model was developed. The same was observed for the Burger et al. (2015) model using the Burger et al. (2014) dataset.
