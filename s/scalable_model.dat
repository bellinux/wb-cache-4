40|$|In this thesis, a {{referenced}} based scaling {{approach and}} its parameter extraction for the bipolar transistor model Mextram is proposed. It is mainly {{based on the}} physical properties of the Mextram parameters, which scale with the junction temperature and geometry of the bipolar transistor. The scalable electrical parameter in the scaling rules is normalized to a reference parameter at reference temperature and geometry. The <b>scalable</b> <b>model</b> is implemented in AHDL Verilog-A language, {{which can be used}} in many commercial simulators. Along with the <b>scalable</b> <b>model,</b> a unified extraction procedure for temperature and geometry parameters of the <b>scalable</b> <b>model</b> has been implemented in an IC-CAP model file using an example of high-speed SiGe HBT technology as a case study. The essential feature of the extraction methodology is a direct extraction of the temperature and geometry parameters from the measured electrical characteristics. The electrical model parameters as the reference parameters are extracted only once for a single reference temperature and geometry. No additional tool for temperature and geometry parameter extraction is needed. As a result, the accuracy is improved and the <b>scalable</b> <b>model</b> library generation time is greatly reduced.
