25|$|Ironically, {{the album}} that was {{recorded}} when the Thompsons' career <b>seemed</b> <b>all</b> but over and {{which turned out}} to be their last album together was their best selling album and acclaimed as one of their greatest artistic achievements. Shoot Out the Lights and the May 1982 tour were crucial in re-launching Richard Thompson's career and in restoring his reputation as a songwriter and guitar player.|$|E
25|$|Without {{enough cash}} {{to pay out}} its Lehman-related debts, AIG went under and was nationalized. Credit markets locked up and {{catastrophe}} <b>seemed</b> <b>all</b> too likely. Paulson proposed providing liquidity to financial markets by having the government buy up debt related to bad mortgages with a $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program. Congressional Democrats advocated an alternative policy of investing in financial companies directly. Congress passed the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, which authorized both policies.|$|E
25|$|Another factor {{contributing}} to the executions policy was the escalating level of violence. In {{the first two months}} of the Civil War (July–August 1922), Free State forces had successfully taken all the territory held by Republicans and the war <b>seemed</b> <b>all</b> but over. After the Anti-Treaty side resorted to guerrilla tactics in August–September, National Army casualties mounted and they even lost control over some of the territory taken in the Irish Free State offensive. The town of Kenmare, for example, was re-taken by Anti-Treaty fighters on 9 September and held by them until early December.|$|E

Nowadays, teams in this situation let the play clock run {{down to the last}} possible second and have the quarterback take a knee. On the sidelines, a disgusted Eagles coach Dick Vermeil was turning his attention away from the field and toward the postgame press conference, where he would have to explain to reporters why his team had fallen to an inferior opponent.|$|E
25|$|After contesting {{two seats}} unsuccessfully as an independent, {{he was elected}} to Epping in 1924 with the backing of local Conservatives, officially rejoining the Conservative Party the {{following}} year. He immediately became Chancellor of the Exchequer, retaining the post until the fall of the Conservative government in 1929, and presided over the return of the United Kingdom to the Gold Standard exchange rate system. In opposition after 1929, Churchill became isolated, opposing Indian independence, advocating the unpopular policy of rearmament {{in the face of a}} resurgent Germany, and supporting King Edward VIII in the abdication crisis. By 1939, he had been out of Cabinet for ten years, and his career <b>seemed</b> <b>all</b> but over.|$|E
25|$|In the mid-1990s, popular hosts Ed Coleman and Dave Sims {{had their}} show cancelled. WFAN then {{announced}} that New York Daily News columnist Mike Lupica and WNBC-TV sports anchor Len Berman would co-host the new midday program. The show <b>seemed</b> <b>all</b> {{set to go}} when, at the last minute, Berman decided {{to back out of}} the show. He cited {{that he would have to}} work a near 14-hour day, combining his 10 a.m. start on radio with his WNBC-TV duties, which consisted of him appearing on all three of the station's evening newscasts. WFAN would not let Berman out of his contract, and as a result, the slot was split into two shows: Lupica hosted from 10 a.m. to noon, while Berman hosted from noon to 2 p.m. The split format did not work, and eventually Berman's show would be cancelled and Lupica's show soon followed.|$|E

25|$|In 1685, Charles II was {{succeeded by}} his Roman Catholic brother, James II and VII. James saw Covenanters as troublemakers and {{initially}} tried {{to end their}} influence in Scotland. The new king also tried to impose religious tolerance of Roman Catholics and Protestant Dissenters, but antagonized many of the Anglican establishment with this action, as they were suspicious of Catholic power. James's half-hearted attempts to woo the Presbyterians seemingly did not win him much popularity among that section of society either. They remembered his earlier suppression of them and did not believe him to be sincere in his recognition of Presbyterianism. Although these actions were widely unpopular, at first {{the majority of his}} subjects tolerated these acts because James was in his 50s and both of his daughters were committed Protestants. It seemed that James's reign would be short and the throne would soon return to Protestant hands. In 1688, however, James's young second wife, Mary of Modena, gave birth to a boy, Prince James, who was promptly baptized a Roman Catholic. Due to English and Scottish succession laws, Prince James immediately supplanted his older half sisters as heir to the throne. Now the prospect of a Catholic dynasty on the English, Scottish and Irish thrones <b>seemed</b> <b>all</b> but certain.|$|E
500|$|Speculation that Morton {{would seek}} {{election}} to Tydings' seat increased after {{an editorial in}} the Baltimore Sun encouraged him to challenge Tydings.

[...] When Morton stated he would be making an important announcement with President Nixon in December 1969, it <b>seemed</b> <b>all</b> but certain at the time that it would be to declare his candidacy.|$|E
500|$|One of Texas A's newer traditions is Maroon Out, {{which began}} in 1998. [...] The {{football}} team had ended their 1997 season with a lopsided defeat to Nebraska in the Big 12 Championship Game. [...] Amy Berger, Class of '99 Treasurer, and Kyle Valentine, Class of 2000 Junior President, noticed how united the Nebraska fans <b>seemed,</b> <b>all</b> dressed in red. [...] She proposed to Class Councils the idea to [...] "Maroon Out" [...] Kyle Field for the October 10, 1998 rematch against Nebraska by selling a low-cost, high-quality maroon t-shirt. This resulted {{in the sale of}} 31,000 Maroon Out shirts, leading to a temporary national shortage of maroon colored t-shirts.|$|E

500|$|Kim Manners {{said that}} it <b>seemed</b> <b>all</b> the {{prominent}} pieces created for The X-Files were created by [...] "accident". According to Manners, Davis {{was nothing more than}} an extra leaning on a shelf. At the start, the producers of the show were not sure about making the Smoking Man the main antagonist. Paul Rabwin commented once {{that he did not know}} if Davis could handle the role, because he was not sure if he was a [...] "good enough" [...] actor for the role. Manners later commented that Davis knew that the Smoking Man had two different characters, the first being the one played by Davis and the second was the cigarettes. He further stated that the cigarette smoke could tell a [...] "whole story" [...] by itself, thanks to Davis' talent.|$|E
500|$|Stage 18 was {{undoubtedly}} {{the most difficult}} in the Tour, incorporating three hors catégorie climbs, including the Col du Galibier at the finish; as such, race organisers defined the stage as the race's queen stage. When Andy Schleck, who began the day two minutes and 36 seconds behind Voeckler, surged away from the race's top riders [...] from the finish and quickly {{made it to the}} morning breakaway, it <b>seemed</b> <b>all</b> but certain that he would become the new race leader. While Schleck easily won the stage, Voeckler followed Evans as the Australian made a strenuous pull {{at the end of the}} stage to limit his time losses. At the very end, Voeckler lost Evans' wheel and fell to fifth on the day, two minutes and 21 seconds behind Schleck. Visibly so spent that he could not sit upright on his bicycle after crossing the finish line, Voeckler had retained the yellow jersey by a margin of 15 seconds. He said afterwards that while he had expected to lose the jersey earlier in the Tour, on this day all the team's efforts were put into retaining it. Post-race analyses called Voeckler a [...] "survivor" [...] and [...] "astonishing." ...|$|E

On 6 December 2008, Harrison's career <b>seemed</b> <b>all</b> but over as he was defeated by {{the winner of the}} first Prizefighter tournament and Belfast taxi driver, Martin Rogan. The referee scored the contest 96–95 in favour of the Irishman.|$|E

2500|$|Following [...] "the {{cinematic}} rumination {{on modern}} marriage begun by Cecil B.

Too Wise Wives, and What Do Men Want? However, as the United States entered the Jazz Age in the 1920s, Weber, {{came to be seen}} as passé, in part because of her [...] "propensity for didacticism", but also because her [...] "values became increasingly archaic; her moralising, propagandistic tone was unsuited to the era of the 'flapper' girl and a hedonism that <b>seemed</b> <b>all</b> the more urgent".|$|E
2500|$|Three days earlier, on 28 February, the Chinese {{had made}} a seventh and final assault on the Tuyen Quang perimeter. [...] Knowing that the relief column was close {{and that it would}} be their last chance to capture the post, the Chinese {{attacked}} with fanatical courage but once again failed to force the breach. [...] On 2 March the men of the Tuyen Quang garrison listened anxiously to the sounds of rifle and cannon fire from the Yu Oc gorge, where the 1st Brigade was fighting to break through to the beleaguered post.

2500|$|As {{early as}} June 1940, while Britain was embroiled {{the early days}} of World War II, The Times, {{confident}} of future victory, advised its readers that [...] "a new order cannot be based on the preservation of privilege, whether the privilege be that of a county, a class, or an individual." [...] Thus it was {{after the end of the}} war, as the government handed back the requisitioned, war-torn and frequently dilapidated mansions to their often demoralised and impoverished owners; it was during a period of not just mounting taxation, to pay for a costly war, but also a time when it <b>seemed</b> <b>all</b> too clear that the old order had passed. In this political climate, many felt it the only option to abandon their ancestral piles. Thus, following the cessation of hostilities, the trickle of demolitions which had begun in the earlier part of the century, now became a torrent of destruction.|$|E
2500|$|Sauron arose {{again and}} {{challenged}} them. The Elves allied with Men {{to form the}} Last Alliance. For seven years, the Alliance laid siege to Barad-dûr, until at last Sauron himself joined the battle field. And there he slew Elendil, High King of Gondor and Arnor, as well as Gil-galad, King of the Elves of Middle-earth. But when it <b>seemed</b> <b>all</b> was lost, Isildur took up the hilt of Narsil, his father's now shattered [...] sword, and cut the One Ring from Sauron's hand. And Sauron was defeated, but not utterly destroyed. For Isildur ignored the counsel of Elrond, and rather than destroy the Ring in the fires of Mount Doom, he kept it for himself. But the Ring betrayed him, as it slipped from his finger as he was escaping from an Orc ambush at the Gladden Fields. Isildur was slain, and the Ring fell into the Anduin River, where it was lost for a time.|$|E
2500|$|After {{finishing}} 3rd in the Conference Premier, Torquay had to {{play their}} fiercest rivals Exeter City to determine who would reach the play-off final to play either Cambridge United or Burton Albion. Torquay {{had to play}} Exeter City away first with the return leg at Plainmoor. Torquay started the 1st leg poorly and were fortunate when Tim Sills scored just before half-time but Exeter City leveled when Wayne Carlisle equalised. [...] Just when the game looked like a draw Chris Zebroski pounced on a poor clearance by Paul Jones to make the final score 2–1 to United. Torquay knew going into the 2nd leg that if they scored one goal Exeter City would need two goals to force extra time and when Kevin Hill scored {{in the second half}} in his record equaling appearance the match <b>seemed</b> <b>all</b> over, however Exeter City went on to score four goals in the space of 18 minutes, dumping Torquay out of the play-offs and ensuring they would have to spend another season in non-league football.|$|E
