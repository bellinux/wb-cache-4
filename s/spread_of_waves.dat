40|$|A {{comprehensive}} {{theoretical model}} of radar backscatter {{from the ocean}} surface is discussed. It combines alternative models {{of the interaction between}} the wind and the sea surface, and different descriptions of the ocean waveheight spectrum of wind seas, with two alternative scattering theories, namely the composite-surface model and the integral equation method. The effects of swell, limited fetch, and perturbations due to rain, surface slicks and currents may be included. The model is able to show the expected sensitivity of radar backscatter to all these factors, and some results for the dependence on swell are shown. Hence it indicates possible improvements to current empirical models as well as implications for future missions such as Envisat. The model predictions are also compared against Topex altimeter data which are collocated with buoy measurements, and against an empirical scatterometer model function. The results at nadir agree well with the empirically observed dependence on wind speed, while the dependence on swell is consistent with recent studies of the influence of swell on the relation between wind stress and wind speed. Results at off-nadir incidence angles are more sensitive to the choice of ocean waveheight spectrum. In particular, the directional <b>spread</b> <b>of</b> <b>waves</b> is not well understood; this leads to a systematic discrepancy between dependences of backscatter on wind direction predicted by the empirical and theoretical models...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to {{evaluate}} data from the offshore wind farm Bockstigen in order to study the effect <b>of</b> directional <b>spreading</b> <b>of</b> <b>waves</b> and wind wave misalignment on {{the response of the}} structure. The development of offshore wind energy has led to wind farms at sites with water depths ranging from approximately 6 to 30 m. The change of location from land to sea changes the design requirements of wind energy converters. In addition to wind loads, the wave load on the structure has to be taken into account. Since a wind turbine is highly damped in the inline direction as compared to the cross-wise direction, the effect <b>of</b> directional <b>spreading</b> <b>of</b> <b>waves</b> on the response is studied. Depending on the dynamics of the structure the crosswise force could give a larger response than the corresponding inline force. In this study the influence <b>of</b> the directional <b>spreading</b> <b>of</b> the <b>waves</b> on the response is not clear, however the effect <b>of</b> wind and <b>wave</b> misalignment is clear...|$|R

40|$|The {{computer}} model SWAN (Simulating Waves Nearshore) {{is used to}} investigate the energy <b>spreading</b> <b>of</b> <b>waves</b> traveling on a slope. From SWAN data, the relationship between directional spreading variance and distance traveled along the slope is determined {{as well as the}} relationship between directional spreading variance and initial directional spreading coefficient m. This is done in order to determine at what coefficient the directional <b>spreading</b> <b>of</b> <b>waves</b> should no longer be considered. Four different cases were used {{in order to determine the}} necessary relationships. It was found that as the coefficient m increases, directional spreading variance decreases. Directional spreading also decreases as waves travel over a slope. The coefficient <b>of</b> directional <b>spreading</b> value at which the variance ratio remains constant over the slope is m = 375. Once the coefficient <b>of</b> directional <b>spreading</b> value is determined using SWAN data, it is compared to a value found using a different method. These two values were compared and found to produce different directional spreading functions. The relationship between the two coefficients is also determined. The second method was calculated in a previous paper. The effects of friction and triad interactions were also investigated as waves travel over the slope.
