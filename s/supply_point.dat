5|$|The {{entirety}} of Pacific City may be explored {{from the start}} of the game, allowing the player to locate the hideouts of each General and Kingpin, which can be made easier by accessing supply points scattered around the city. Once a <b>supply</b> <b>point</b> is unlocked, the player has the option of returning there to travel to any other <b>supply</b> <b>point,</b> restock on weapons and ammunition, or drop off newly acquired weapons, to permanently add them to their weapon selection. Should the player die, they can respawn at any open <b>supply</b> <b>point.</b> While exploring, the player is likely to come across enemy resistance, with their aggressiveness based on how badly the player has damaged that particular gang recently. If the player is too aggressive against the non-gang residents of Pacific City, including the Peacekeepers, they are flagged as rogue, and Agency hit squads are dispatched to take them down.|$|E
5|$|In 1964, Lieutenant Commander Benjamin F. Montoya was {{deployed}} to Guam with the Naval Mobile Construction Battalion Three. He led an advance party in Vietnam {{to supervise the}} construction of the first base camp built by SeaBees in Da Nang. He returned in 1966 to Chu Lai, and was responsible {{for the construction of a}} base camp, <b>supply</b> <b>point,</b> hospital and a Marine Corps helicopter base.|$|E
5|$|In {{the autumn}} of 1633, Commonwealth forces retook Dorogobuzh, an {{important}} Russian <b>supply</b> <b>point</b> after its capture the year before. This setback wrecked Russian plans to send reinforcements to Shein's army, although in any event the Russians did not begin to gather a 5,000-strong army for that purpose until January 1634. Also that autumn, Grand Crown Hetman Stanisław Koniecpolski defeated an Ottoman incursion {{in the south of}} the Commonwealth, freeing his force to lay siege to the Russian town of Sevsk; although Koniecpolski failed to take the fortress, he tied down large Russian forces, preventing them from moving north towards Smolensk.|$|E
50|$|Certain more {{intangible}} resources include <b>Supply</b> <b>Points</b> and Capital Ship Crews. <b>Supply</b> <b>Points</b> {{are used}} up when ships are purchased, and cannot be accumulated, {{acting as a}} population cap for the player's fleet. Capital Ship Crews and <b>Supply</b> <b>Points</b> are both required {{for the construction of}} powerful capital ships; regular capital ships require one crew, while the giant titans in the Rebellion expansion require two. A player's maximum <b>Supply</b> <b>Points</b> and Capital Ship Crews can be upgraded, but increased <b>Supply</b> <b>Points</b> require more logistical support, imposing a permanent reduction on the player's income.|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1977 The {{determination}} of the number and locations of optimal <b>supply</b> <b>points</b> in centralized distribution systems is considered from both theoretical and institutional aspects. The Euclidean distance problems that typify the theoretical school of location search are discussed and seven different solution techniques are investigated: the Torricelli, linear programming, exhaustive search, branch-and-bound, fixed increment steepest descent, Hyperboloid approximation procedure (HAP), and self-optimization methods. The last technique is a new modified gradient method, and is demonstrated to be also applicable to squared, cubic, and exponential Euclidean distance models. Applying the branch-and-bound algorithm to the self-optimization method, a combinatorial approach to problems that entail multiple <b>supply</b> <b>points</b> and forbidden regions is developed and demonstrated with three institutional examples. The first example is the {{determination of}} the number and locations of <b>supply</b> <b>points</b> in a simple four-point distribution system. The second example is the determination of <b>supply</b> <b>points</b> considering a small forbidden area. The last numerical example uses data from the Nissan Motor Co. 's American distribution system, and determines the number and locations of car repair parts manufacturing and <b>supply</b> <b>points.</b> Numerical evaluations of the self-optimization method, including such considerations as the precision, computer execution time, and other advantages and disadvantages of both the self-optimization method and the combinatorial method are followed by recommendations for future research efforts...|$|R
5|$|PFC Fernando Luis Garcia (1929–1952), was {{assigned}} to Company I, 3rd Battalion, 5th Marines, of the 1st Marine division. On the night of his death, September 5, 1952, he was posted about one mile from the enemy lines. The Korean enemies were attacking with grenades, bombs {{and other types of}} artillery. Garcia was critically wounded, but he led his team to a <b>supply</b> <b>point</b> to get hand-grenades. An enemy grenade landed nearby, and Garcia covered with his body, sacrificing himself to save the lives of his fellow Marines. Garcia died instantly. Garcia, whose remains were never recovered, became the first Puerto Rican Medal of Honor recipient.|$|E
5|$|In 1968, {{the vast}} Prudhoe Bay Oil Field was {{discovered}} in Alaska's North Slope. Fairbanks became a <b>supply</b> <b>point</b> for exploitation of the oil field and for construction of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System, which caused a boom unseen since {{the first years of}} Fairbanks' founding and helped the town recover from the devastating 1967 Fairbanks Flood. Fairbanks became a government center in the late 1960s with the establishment of the Fairbanks North Star Borough, which took Fairbanks as its borough seat. A drop in oil prices during the 1980s caused a recession in the Fairbanks area, but the city gradually recovered as oil prices climbed during the 1990s. Tourism also became an important factor in Fairbanks' economy, and the growth of the tourism industry and the city continues even as oil production declines.|$|E

Ainsworth was never exceed the fame of the nearby Slocan district, particularly, Sandon.|$|E
25|$|Kariakoo is the {{shopping}} district of the city, perhaps the busiest and largest in East Africa. Shops, bazaars and merchants dot the streets, selling products from foodstuffs to hardware materials. The Kariakoo Market, {{which is the}} largest, contains the only underground section of the city. It is the major <b>supply</b> <b>point</b> of the food consumed by all the residents of Dar es Salaam.|$|E
25|$|In February 1945, Scott was {{transferred}} to Dum Dum Airfield on the northeastern edge of Calcutta, India {{and away from the}} front lines.

25|$|The Royalist {{response}} was to helicopter in Groupement Mobile 43 (GM 43) to capture the Tha Theng <b>supply</b> <b>point</b> supporting the 9th Regiment. GM 43 took the town without fighting. However, the Royalist move failed to starve the Communist offensives of supplies; they continued to assault Paksong and Salavan. In fact, 3,200 Communist artillery rounds impacted Salavan {{on the evening of}} 15 December 1972, followed by assaults on the town from all directions. Several Communist antiaircraft guns were moved in to close the Salavan airstrip on 15 December.|$|E
25|$|During the American Civil War, Jacksonville {{was a key}} <b>supply</b> <b>point</b> for hogs {{and cattle}} leaving Florida and aiding the Confederate cause. Throughout most of the war, the US Navy {{maintained}} a blockade around Florida's ports, including Jacksonville. In October 1862 Union forces captured a Confederate battery in the Battle of St. Johns Bluff and occupied Jacksonville. Throughout the war Jacksonville would change hands several times, though never with a battle. On February 20, 1864, Union soldiers from Jacksonville marched inland and confronted the Confederate Army at the Battle of Olustee.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of the landing at Nassau Bay, the Allied forces gained a vital <b>supply</b> <b>point</b> for the attack against Salamaua. Throughout early and mid-July, two more battalions of the 162nd Infantry Regiment were landed at Nassau Bay, and several Australian and US {{artillery}} batteries were also brought ashore. The larger of these pieces were used to shell Japanese positions on the reverse slopes of the ridges in the surrounding areas, as well as Salamaua itself. Meanwhile, the Allied forces began a flanking drive on Salamaua, in conjunction with further actions to the west.|$|E

25|$|The Landing at Nassau Bay was an amphibious landing by Allied {{forces at}} Nassau Bay during the New Guinea {{campaign}} of World War II {{that took place}} between 30 June and 6 July 1943. The operation was undertaken so that Allies could secure a beachhead to establish a <b>supply</b> <b>point</b> to shorten their supply lines for the proposed attack on Salamaua {{as part of the}} Salamaua–Lae campaign and resulted in a battalion-sized force of US infantry and supporting elements being landed largely unopposed on the south-eastern flank of the battle zone.|$|E
25|$|Part of the 1803 Louisiana Purchase by the United States, Missouri {{earned the}} {{nickname}} Gateway to the West because {{it served as}} a major departure point for expeditions and settlers heading to the West during the 19th century. St. Charles, just west of St. Louis, was the starting point and the return destination of the Lewis and Clark Expedition, which ascended the Missouri River in 1804, in order to explore the western lands to the Pacific Ocean. St. Louis was a major <b>supply</b> <b>point</b> for decades, for parties of settlers heading west.|$|E
25|$|The {{difficult}} terrain {{enabled the}} German army {{to create a}} defensive frontier {{along the line of}} Windhuk and Keetmanshoop, and troops were also stationed adjacent to the two regional railroads. Having a limited number of troops in his possession, the German commander, Joachim von Heydebreck, ordered his troops to assume defensive positions and observe predefined routes. The area of Sandfontein held a high strategic importance due to the presence of the only high quality water wells in a 75-kilometer radius, thus being a crucial <b>supply</b> <b>point</b> for any large scale operation. The South African military was well aware of the complicated geographic conditions, possessing a variety of prewar journals and reports concerning German South West Africa's topology.|$|E

25|$|Campbell River prospered after 1912 and {{it became}} a <b>supply</b> <b>point</b> for {{northern}} Vancouver Island, Quadra Island and Cortes Island. The E and N Railway was surveyed to Campbell River, yet it only reached Courtenay, forty miles south; in its original conception {{it would have been the}} last leg of the transcontinental railway, which had been proposed to run down Bute Inlet after cross the British Columbia Interior, connecting to Vancouver Island just north of Campbell River at Seymour Narrows. After the Second World War, Campbell River became a boom town and industrial centre with the building of the John Hart Dam, Elk River pulp mill, and nearby mills in Tahsis and Gold River. Logging and mining in the area prospered. There is a lead zinc mine nearby, and coal mines, while a large copper mine operated to the north.|$|E
25|$|The {{interior}} minister of Romania, Vasile Blaga, has assured the EU that the Mihail Kogălniceanu Airport was used {{only as a}} <b>supply</b> <b>point</b> for equipment, and never for detention, though {{there have been reports}} to the contrary. A fax intercepted by the Onyx Swiss interception system, from the Egyptian Foreign Ministry to its London embassy, stated that 23 prisoners were clandestinely interrogated by the U.S. at the base. In 2007, it was disclosed by Dick Marty (investigator) that the CIA allegedly had secret prisons in Poland and Romania. On April 22, 2015, Ion Iliescu, former President of Romania, confirmed that he had granted a CIA request for a site in Romania, but was not aware {{of the nature of the}} site, describing it as a small gesture of goodwill to an ally in advance of Romania's eventual accession to NATO. Iliescu further stated that had he known of the intended use of the site, he would certainly not have approved the request.|$|E
25|$|During World War II, San Francisco was {{the major}} {{mainland}} <b>supply</b> <b>point</b> and port of embarkation {{for the war in}} the Pacific. It also saw the largest and oldest enclave of Japanese outside of Japan, Japantown, completely empty out many of its residents as a result of Executive Order 9066 that forced all Japanese of birth or descent in the United States to be interned. By 1943 many large sections of the neighborhood remained vacant due to the forced internment. The void was quickly filled by thousands of African Americans who had left the South to find wartime industrial jobs in California as part of the Great Migration. Many African Americans also settled in the Fillmore District and most notably near the Bayview-Hunters Point shipyards, working in the dry-docks there. The same docks at Hunters Point would be used for loading the key fissile components of the first atomic bomb onto the USS Indianapolis in July 1945 for transfer to Tinian.|$|E
50|$|Between September 1943 and July 1945, the {{battalion}} established {{a number of}} ammunition <b>supply</b> <b>points</b> throughout Italy, ranging from Prestum to Monecatini.

50|$|Each Unit and Special Card {{is labeled}} with numbers between 1 and 5 {{detailing}} their attack strength against certain enemies {{as well as}} their protective strength against an opponent’s attack. Players take turns executing the 5-Phase Turn Sequence: Reinforcement, Air Action, Recon, Bombardment, and Fire & Maneuver. The first player to initiate their sequence must complete it before the opposition can begin theirs. The <b>Supply</b> Cost <b>Points</b> from each of the units that each that a player decides to deploy are deducted from their total. Once a player uses all of their points, they can no longer bring any new cards into play, thus, the game begins to require more strategy as to which cards should be used when. Destroying attacks from the opponent {{is the only way to}} gain back <b>Supply</b> <b>Points</b> which can then be used to deploy additional Unit and Special cards. As numbers dwindle, the opposing HQ becomes far less protected and more vulnerable to attacks. The game ends when the HQ is finally captured at which <b>point</b> the <b>Supply</b> <b>Points</b> are added up to determine the winner.|$|R
