2500|$|A seventh aircraft, the Vickers Type 177 [...] {{was built}} as a private venture to meet the {{requirements}} of Air Ministry Specification N.21/26 for a naval fighter, being fitted with a Jupiter XF engine and <b>steerable</b> <b>wheel</b> braking to aid on-deck manoeuvering. The Type 177 first flew on 26 November 1929, and while it was shown to have a maximum speed of 190mph (310km/h), [...] the Hawker Nimrod, not designed against this specification, was chosen instead to meet the Fleet Air Arm's requirement for a fighter.|$|E
2500|$|Before {{aircraft}} {{commonly used}} tailwheels, many aircraft (like {{a number of}} First World War Sopwith aircraft, such as the Camel fighter) were equipped with steerable tailskids, which operate similar to a tailwheel. When the pilot pressed the right rudder pedal — or the right footrest of a [...] "rudder bar" [...] in World War I — the skid pivoted to the right, creating more drag {{on that side of}} the plane and causing it to turn to the right. While less effective than a <b>steerable</b> <b>wheel,</b> it gave the pilot some control of the direction the craft was moving while taxiing or beginning the takeoff run, before there was enough airflow over the rudder for it to become effective.|$|E

5000|$|Having {{solved the}} {{propulsion}} issue, Aveling next turned to steering. His first engines had required a horse in shafts {{attached to the}} front wheels for steerage. In 1860 he replaced the horse with a <b>steerable</b> <b>wheel</b> in between the horse shafts. [...] The steersman sat {{on the back of}} the shafts and operated a tiller to turn the wheel.|$|E

40|$|Describes a {{steering}} system for a wheeled vehicle, particularly one with independent suspension of the <b>steerable</b> <b>wheels.</b> This {{is characterized by the}} lack of any necessity for a direct physical linkage between steering control arms of the left and right wheels and by the use of separate, independent fluid pressure cylinder pairs connected by fluid pressure conduit for imparting motion to the respective <b>steerable</b> <b>wheels.</b> Coordination between the angular motion of the left and right <b>steerable</b> <b>wheels</b> is attained by a direct mechanical linkage between actuator members of the hydraulic cylinders remote from the wheel suspension which linkage can be arranged for non-linear relative motion that will result in desired coordinated but unequal motion of left and right <b>steerable</b> <b>wheels.</b> Such linkage between actuator members is operated directly or indirectly by the steering wheel, steering levers, or other device. Preferably the fluid pressure cylinders connected to steering control arms of the wheels extend substantially parallel to suspension arms of the wheel suspension, and fluid pressure lines to such cylinders are flexible hoses which permit wide angle motion of the independent wheel suspension. Each fluid pressure cylinder may include between its ports a by-pass conduit and a valve releases the constraint between the interconnected fluid pressure cylinders. This facilitates alignment of the vehicle wheels or other adjustments. Preferably the fluid pressure system is pressurized at over 100 psi...|$|R

25|$|Tank {{steering}} systems allow a tank, {{or other}} continuous track vehicle, to turn. Because the tracks cannot be angled {{relative to the}} hull (in any operational design), steering must be accomplished by speeding one track up, slowing the other down (or reversing it), {{or a combination of}} both. The half-track avoids this by combining <b>steerable</b> <b>wheels</b> and fixed-speed tracks.|$|R

40|$|A "cobot" is {{a robotic}} device which manipulates objects i n {{collaboration}} {{with a human}} operator. A cobot provides assistance to the human operator by setting up virtual surfaces {{which can be used}} to constrain and guide motion. While conventional servoactuated haptic displays may be used in this way also, an important distinction is that, while haptic displays are active devices which can supply energy to the human operator, cobots are intrinsically passive. This is because cobots do not use servos to implement constraint, but instead employ "steerable" nonholonomic joints. As a consequence of their passivity, cobots are potentially wellsuited to safety-critical tasks (e. g. surgery) or those which involve large interaction forces (e. g. automobile assembly). This paper focuses on the simplest possible cobot, which has only a single joint (a <b>steerable</b> <b>wheel).</b> Two control modes of this "unicycle cobot", termed "virtual caster" and "virtual wall" control, are developed in detail.

2500|$|When he {{was working}} for T.I Group, Dolphin {{patented}} a hinged frame and <b>steerable</b> <b>wheeled</b> vehicle which was a battery-powered tricycle.

Dolphin's design had <b>steerable</b> front <b>wheel</b> with stability provided by two rear wheels. His aim was to 'provide a simple, yet effective, form of personalised transport which will possess the stability of a conventional tricycle yet will be steered by balance as with a conventional bicycle.'

50|$|Steering is {{achieved}} by turning a nose wheel or tail wheel/rudder; the pilot controls the direction travelled with their feet. Larger jet aircraft have a tiller wheel {{on the left side}} of the cockpit that acts as a steering wheel allowing the nosewheel to be turned hydraulically. Braking is controlled by differential toe or heel brakes. Not all aircraft have <b>steerable</b> <b>wheels,</b> and in some cases steering is solely by means of differential braking (all Van's aircraft for instance) or solely by means of the rudder (including all floatplanes).|$|R
