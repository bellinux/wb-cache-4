500|$|Coolidge {{addressed}} Congress when it reconvened on December 6, 1923, {{giving a}} speech that supported many of Harding's policies, including Harding's formal budgeting process, the enforcement of immigration restrictions and arbitration of coal strikes ongoing in Pennsylvania. Coolidge's speech was the first presidential speech to be broadcast over the radio. The Washington Naval Treaty was proclaimed just one month into Coolidge's term, and was generally well received in the country. In May 1924, the World War I veterans' World War Adjusted Compensation Act or [...] "Bonus Bill" [...] was passed over his veto. Coolidge signed the Immigration Act later that year, which was aimed at restricting southern and eastern European immigration, but appended a signing statement expressing his unhappiness with the bill's <b>specific</b> <b>exclusion</b> of Japanese immigrants. Just before the Republican Convention began, Coolidge signed into law the Revenue Act of 1924, which reduced the top marginal tax rate from 58% to 46%, as well as personal income tax rates across the board, increased the estate tax and bolstered it with a new gift tax.|$|E
60|$|At last {{he faced}} the {{unpalatable}} problem of Denton. It needed all his newborn magnanimity before he could swallow the thought of Denton; but at last this greatly misunderstood man, assisted by his sedative and the near approach of death, effected even that. If he was at all exclusive about Denton, if he should display the slightest distrust, if he attempted any <b>specific</b> <b>exclusion</b> of that young man, she might--misunderstand. Yes--she should have her Denton still. His magnanimity must go even to that. He tried to think only of Elizabeth in the matter.|$|E
60|$|Two {{secretarial}} posts {{did indeed}} seem to offer themselves in which, at least, {{there was no}} <b>specific</b> <b>exclusion</b> of womanhood; one was under a Radical Member of Parliament, and the other under a Harley Street doctor, and both men declined her proffered services with the utmost civility and admiration and terror. There was also a curious interview at a big hotel with a middle-aged, white-powdered woman, all covered with jewels and reeking of scent, who wanted a Companion. She did not think Ann Veronica would do as her companion.|$|E
50|$|There are {{numerous}} other <b>specific</b> <b>exclusions.</b> Restrictions and <b>specific</b> definitions apply.|$|R
25|$|Accordingly, the Irish {{government}} renegotiated {{the terms}} of the Treaty, adding areas where Ireland would have <b>specific</b> <b>exclusions,</b> which could be presented in a second referendum.|$|R
50|$|Life {{policies}} are legal contracts and {{the terms of}} the contract describe the limitations of the insured events. <b>Specific</b> <b>exclusions</b> are often written into the contract to limit the liability of the insurer; common examples are claims relating to suicide, fraud, war, riot, and civil commotion.|$|R
5000|$|Section 6 {{establishes}} the [...] "Native Hawaiian Interagency Coordinating Group" [...] for coordination of various {{federal agencies and}} policies, with the <b>specific</b> <b>exclusion</b> of the Department of Defense.|$|E
50|$|Matriarchal {{cultures}} {{are run by}} women. Women hold primary power, predominate in roles of political leadership, moral authority, social privilege and control of property at the <b>specific</b> <b>exclusion</b> of men, at least to a large degree.|$|E
5000|$|Pukui {{states that}} the {{original}} {{meaning of the word}} haole was [...] "foreigner". Therefore, all non-Hawaiians can be called haole. In practical terms, however, the term is used as a racial description for Caucasians (whites), with the <b>specific</b> <b>exclusion</b> of Portuguese. Portuguese were traditionally considered to be a separate race in Hawaii.|$|E
5000|$|Exceptions were made, {{including}} {{non-manual workers}} employed on annual pay over £250, casual workers employed [...] "otherwise {{than for the}} purposes of their employer's trade or business", outworkers and family workers. Hence <b>specific</b> <b>exclusions</b> were made at both the top and bottom end of the labour market.|$|R
50|$|Leadville Historic District was {{designated}} a National Historic Landmark District in 1961. The district encompasses 67 mines {{east of the}} city up to the 12,000 foot (3658 m) elevation level, and a defined portion of the village area, with <b>specific</b> <b>exclusions</b> for various buildings. The principal historic buildings are: Tabor Grand Hotel, St George's Church, Temple Israel, the Annunciation Church, Tabor Opera House, City Hall, Healy House, Dexter Cabin, Engelbach House, and Tabor House, as well as mining structures and small homes.|$|R
50|$|For {{the greater}} part, the pre-Athenian ancient sources are {{selective}} in {{which of these}} narrative elements they chose by their own preferences to honor and support, and which ones they chose to exclude. The specific combinations of these relatively independent narrative elements by individual ancient authors (Hesiod, Homer, Pindar, Pythagoras), and <b>specific</b> <b>exclusions</b> among them, are often influenced by the particular needs and purposes of the larger myths and legends which they are depicting. Each individual ancient author selectively preferred certain crucial stories depicting Prometheus over others.|$|R
50|$|Angarrack {{was one of}} {{the founder}} members of Cornwall 2000, an {{organisation}} based in Bodmin, Cornwall. The group lobbied the UK government over the <b>specific</b> <b>exclusion</b> of the Cornish from the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities.They were, however, unsuccessful in raising sufficient funds to take matters to court, and the campaign was dropped.|$|E
5000|$|The {{courts have}} given very broad {{meaning to the}} phrase [...] "all income from {{whatever}} source derived," [...] interpreting it to include all income unless a <b>specific</b> <b>exclusion</b> applies. Certain types of income are specifically excluded from gross income. These may {{be referred to as}} exempt income, exclusions, or tax exemptions. Among the more common excluded items are the following: ...|$|E
50|$|Dabbing on the haters is {{a social}} system in which females hold NO power (exclusive for kings ands queens,), predominate in roles of {{political}} leadership, moral authority, social privilege and control of property at the <b>specific</b> <b>exclusion</b> of men, at least to a large degree. While those definitions apply in general English, definitions specific to the disciplines of anthropology and feminism differ in some respects.|$|E
50|$|In an open perils policy, <b>specific</b> <b>exclusions</b> will {{be stated}} in this section. These {{generally}} include earth movement, water damage, power failure, neglect, war, nuclear hazard, septic tank back-up expenses, intentional loss, and concurrent causation (for HO3). The concurrent causation exclusion excludes losses where both a covered and an excluded loss occur. In addition, the exclusion for building ordinance can mean that increased expenses due to local ordinances {{may not be}} covered. A 2013 survey of Americans found that 41% believed mold was covered, although it is typically not covered if the water damage occurs {{over a period of}} time, such as through a leaky pipe.|$|R
5000|$|Many {{policies}} {{will have their}} own <b>specific</b> <b>exclusions.</b> These can be extremely broad or narrow {{depending on the type}} of policy or the company that has issued the insurance. It is common to find exclusions listed on a policy that have been worded [...] "Directly Or Indirectly as a result". This means that even if the loss has occurred as an indirect case of an excluded item, the loss will not be covered in any way. It is for this reason that the insurance idea of proximate cause becomes so important. Underwriters will include exclusions to limit their risk to a specific type of loss.|$|R
40|$|President Clinton's Health Security Act entitles {{individuals}} not to unlimited health care, but to {{a package}} of defined insurance benefits with <b>specific</b> <b>exclusions</b> and limitations. Like virtually all reform proposals, it would limit covered benefits to services that are medically necessary. If health reform is to control costs, not all medically necessary care can be covered. In {{the absence of a}} generally accepted definition of medical necessity, many services will not be guaranteed to all patients unless they are explicitly covered in the federal legislation or regulations. Without a federal definition of medical necessity or regulations listing covered services, health insurance plans will retain the primary authority to decide what is medically necessary for their patient subscribers...|$|R
50|$|The Heritage Overlay is used {{to protect}} sites that have {{heritage}} value, meaning that individual buildings or whole urban precincts may be covered. The protection afforded by a Heritage Overlay varies in each instance, though the controls apply to built structures and their associated land. The minimum level of protection is afforded by the mere existence of the overlay and means that any work {{at all to the}} building or site will require a planning permit, ensuring that a higher level of scrutiny automatically occurs, regardless of any specific control measures cited. Exemptions from permits can be achieved via a site <b>specific</b> <b>exclusion</b> or an incorporated plan listed in the schedule to the overlay.|$|E
5000|$|Lobbying {{by former}} Union Presidents Lord Deben and Lord Lamont {{resulted}} in the <b>specific</b> <b>exclusion</b> of the Cambridge and Oxford Unions from the Government's counter-terrorism bill, amid fears it could restrict free debate. Deben argued that the provisions within the bill would have prevented the hosting of British Union of Fascists' leader Oswald Mosley in the 1950s, concluding that the bill threatened [...] "an essential British value". The National Union of Students used the exclusion {{to argue that the}} passage of the Bill was too rapid and ill-thought out, whilst both the Oxford and Cambridge Union reaffirmed that they were not legally part of their respective Universities and thus were never subject to the bill in the first place.|$|E
5000|$|Unlike in the United States, {{and in the}} United Kingdom, {{there is}} no {{doctrine}} forbidding the courts from reviewing [...] "political questions". While no <b>specific</b> <b>exclusion</b> exists {{it is likely that}} the courts would be reluctant to intervene in certain matters. Historically, the courts have generally not inquired into certain classes of administrative actions, such as decisions exercising the vice-regal [...] "prerogative powers" [...] or that involve foreign policy, a declaration of war, national security or the award of official honours. However, there is no general rule preventing this, and the courts sought to focus more on the individual circumstances of application and the nature of the power being used rather than categorical dismissal based on government powers.|$|E
40|$|The {{subject of}} “health benefit basket” has been hotly debated for years among the Polish public, but until {{recently}} {{the debate has}} tended to be largely theoretical and abstract and therefore has lacked an effect on public policy. The situation changed in 2004, for two reasons: first the verdict of the Constitutional Tribunal invalidating the existing health insurance law and, second, Poland’s accession to the European Union. The first problem was solved in part by defining a list of <b>specific</b> <b>exclusions</b> in the law and a promise to establish an institution for health technology assessment. The second issue remains open, although to some extend it is being dealt with legally by regulations issued from the Ministry of Health on acceptable waiting times for health services...|$|R
40|$|This chapter explores {{some of the}} {{tensions}} and possibilities that arise from historical and context-bound relationships between gendered politics and the state. Contradictions between different spheres of action and value are understood to produce and reproduce different forms of freedom and non-freedom, exclusion and inclusion, drawing on {{the example of the}} formation of the Argentine nation-state in the context of 19 th century global capitalism, whereby increasingly circumscribed notions of appropriate kinship were associated with emergent parameters of legitimate nationhood, citizenship and belonging. The process of nation-building generated historically <b>specific</b> <b>exclusions</b> and invisibilities as effects of power relations and produced differentiated subjects, spanning subjects who will be eligible for recognition and those who will not, and producing particular forms of silence and invisibility...|$|R
5000|$|Many systems {{provide for}} <b>specific</b> <b>exclusions</b> from taxable (chargeable) income. For example, several countries, notably Cyprus, Luxembourg, Netherlands and Spain, have enacted holding company regimes that exclude from income {{dividends}} from certain foreign subsidiaries of corporations. These systems generally impose tax on {{other sorts of}} income, such as interest or royalties, from the same subsidiaries. They also typically have requirements for portion and time of ownership {{in order to qualify}} for exclusion. The Netherlands offers a [...] "participation exemption" [...] for dividends from subsidiaries of Netherlands companies. Dividends from all Dutch subsidiaries automatically qualify. For other dividends to qualify, the Dutch shareholder or affiliates must own at least 5% and the subsidiary must be subject to a certain level of income tax locally.|$|R
50|$|The most {{important}} question in the case was whether the Racial Discrimination Act was valid. Section 51(xxvi) of the Australian Constitution, which allows the Commonwealth to make laws {{for the people of}} any race, originally made a <b>specific</b> <b>exclusion</b> for Aboriginal people. However, this exception was removed in the 1967 referendum on Aboriginal people, and since then, the Commonwealth had power to make laws for Aboriginal people. However, the wording did not mean that only laws benefiting people of any race could be passed; in fact, the section was originally designed to allow the Commonwealth to discriminate against the people of any race. Nevertheless, the court agreed that the Commonwealth could make laws prohibiting discrimination against the people of any race.|$|E
50|$|The 2011 bill {{provided}} an exclusion for businesses with {{annual sales of}} $500,000 or less. This was {{much smaller than the}} threshold used by the Small Business Administration for defining a small business: $30 million in most cases. There was also no <b>specific</b> <b>exclusion</b> in the legislation to exempt resellers from the tax, so the Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement would have applied to those sales: A retail shop owner who makes interstate purchases of applicable merchandise for resale in their store would be required to pay sales tax on those purchases or apply to their state for a reseller permit, resale license, or wholesale exemption certificate, any of which would exempt retailers from paying sales tax on purchases made for resale.|$|E
50|$|As Coubertin {{prepared}} for his Congress, {{he continued to}} develop a philosophy of the Olympic Games. While he certainly intended the Games to be a forum for competition between amateur athletes, his conception of amateurism was complex. By 1894, the year the Congress was held, he publicly criticised the type of amateur competition embodied in English rowing contests, arguing that its <b>specific</b> <b>exclusion</b> of working-class athletes was wrong. While he believed that athletes should not be paid to be such, he did think that compensation was {{in order for the}} time when athletes were competing and would otherwise have been earning money. Following the establishment of a definition for an amateur athlete at the 1894 Congress, he would continue to argue that this definition should be amended as necessary, and as late as 1909 would argue that the Olympic movement should develop its definition of amateurism gradually.|$|E
50|$|There {{are legal}} definitions. For example, The United States Consumer Product Safety Act has an {{extensive}} definition of consumer product, which begins:CONSUMER PRODUCT.--The term ‘‘consumer product’’ means any article, or component part thereof, produced or distributed (i) {{for sale to}} a consumer for use in or around a permanent or temporary household or residence, a school, in recreation, or otherwise, or (ii) for the personal use, consumption or enjoyment of a consumer in or around a permanent or temporary household or residence, a school, in recreation, or otherwise; but such term does not include—(A) any article which is not customarily produced or distributed for sale to, or use or consumption by, or enjoyment of, a consumer,It {{then goes on to}} list eight additional <b>specific</b> <b>exclusions</b> and further details.|$|R
5000|$|As {{transgender}} elders retire, {{they are}} often disadvantaged {{in the health care}} system. Medicare and many private health insurance coverages [...] "carry <b>specific</b> <b>exclusions</b> for transition-related care, which are sometimes interpreted in practice to deny coverage to transgender people for even basic medical care". The Federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has reiterated the provision of [...] "hormone replacement therapy and routine preventive care such as prostate screenings, mammograms, and pelvic exams, regardless of the gender marker in the individual’s Social Security record". These providers and the transgender patients are often unaware of such rules or of condition code 45, created by CMS in order to avoid automatic coverage denials in cases of gender discrepancies. Medicare also excludes sex reassignment surgery from its coverage, basing it as solely cosmetic. The policy [...] "also encourages private insurers, state Medicaid plans, and the veterans’ health care system to continue to allow similar exclusions that target care for transgender people".|$|R

5000|$|Section 216, {{which deals}} with the {{authority}} to issue pen registers and trace devices and contend that [...] "the statutory definitions are vague {{with respect to the}} types of information that can be captured and are subject to broad interpretations". They are not impressed with the section's <b>specific</b> <b>exclusion</b> of the contents of such communications, because this is defined in [...] as [...] "including any information concerning the substance, purport, or meaning of that communication". They say that it [...] "does not adequately take into account the unique nature of information captured electronically, which contains data far more revealing than phone numbers, such as URLs generated while using the Web (which often contain {{a great deal of information}} that cannot in any way be analogized to a telephone number)". They also say that [...] "availability of nationwide orders for the interception and collection of electronic evidence would remove an important legal safeguard by making it more difficult for a distant service provider to appear before the issuing court and object to legal or procedural defects". Section 220, {{which deals with}} nationwide service of search warrants for electronic evidence, is similarly criticized.|$|E
5000|$|HS enzymatic {{specificity}} of QSulf1 was first analyzed. QSulf1 enzymatic specificity on 6-O sulfates {{was linked to}} the trisulfated disaccharides (HexA,2SGlcNS,6S) in S domains of HS (HS regions where most of the GlcNS residues are in contiguous sequences) and not NA/NS domains (regions of alternating N-acetylated and N-sulfated units; transition zones). Sulf1 and 2 null murine embryonic fibroblasts were generated to test the HS {{specificity of}} mammalian Sulf as opposed to avian Sulf (QSulf). Investigators found mSulf1−/−;mSulf2−/− HS showed overall large increases in all 6S disaccharides. Cooperativity between mSulf1/2 was found because a 2-fold increase in S-domain-associated disaccharides (UA-GlcNS(6S) and UA(2S)-GlcNS(6S)) was observed in double knock-out HS as compared with either single knock-out HS alone. [...] However, one difference from mSulf1 is that mSulf2−/− HS shows an increase in 6S almost exclusively within the non-sulfated and transition zones. [...] This sulfation effect on non-sulfated and transition zones is also different from QSulfs, which catalyze desulfation exclusively in S-domains. Although 6S changes were dominant, other small changes in NS and 2S sulfation do occur in the Sulf knock out MEFs, which may be a compensatory mechanism. Further biochemical studies elucidated specificity and localization of human Sulfs 1 and 2. Sulf1 and 2 hydrophilic domains associate with the cell membrane components through electrostatic interactions and not by integration with into the lipid bilayer. In addition to cell membrane association, Sulfs also secreted freely into the media, which contrasts the findings with QSulf1 and 2. Biochemical analysis of HSPGs in Sulf 1 and 2 knockout MEFS reveal enzyme specificities to disulfated and, primarily, trisulfated 6S disaccharide units UA-GlcNS(6S) and UA(2S)-GlcNS(6S) within the HS chain, with <b>specific</b> <b>exclusion</b> of monosulfated disaccharide units. [...] In vivo studies, however, demonstrate that loss of Sulf1 and Sulf2 result in sulfation changes of nonsubstrates (UA-GlcNAc(6S), N and 2-O Sulfate), indicating Sulf modulates HS biosynthetic machinery. This was further demonstrated by PCR analysis, showing dynamic changes in HS biosynthesis enzymes after Sulf1 and 2 loss. [...] Also, the authors showed in an MEF model system, that Sulf1 and Sulf2 definitively and differentially modify HS proteoglycan fractions including cell surface, GPI-anchored (glypican), shed, and ECM-associated proteoglycans.|$|E
