40|$|The paper {{attempts}} {{to review the}} main models used in systems ecology, and applied to urban and territorial development, in tight connection with the developing understanding of equilibrium and stability. Initially, resilience was perceived {{as a component of}} stability (along with resistance, persistence, and variability), and later as a <b>self-standing</b> <b>concept.</b> As the understanding of equilibrium moves from homeostasis to homeoerhesis and practically to the carrying capacity, and stability finds different interpretations, ranging from constancy to dynamic equilibrium, the dynamics of ecological systems is modeled using adaptive instead of succession cycles. The new model is currently applied to other sciences, and also adapted to the man-dominated systems, including the urban ones. In this case, the understanding of resilience is even more divided among specialists, with particular interpretations resulting from partial or sectoral viewpoints. The analysis shows that more research is not a promising solution, but conceptual refinement is required instead...|$|E

Transformation requires a shift in people's values, referred to as the inner dimension of sustainability, or change from the inside-out. However not clear is what values are and how they differ from beliefs, attitudes and worldviews. The central question addressed in this article is what the role of values is in transformational change towards sustainability. Values have been operationalized in various ways, varying from economic value, motivational values, symbolic values, processes of e-‘value’-ation, mediating values, to value systems. Values are not <b>self-standing</b> <b>concepts</b> which can be mapped our analyzed as atomized issues. They are intertwined, context determined, culturally varied and connected to how we see our self and perceive our environment. This paper provides an overview of recent advances in the literature on values, making a distinction between personal values and collective cultural values...|$|R
40|$|Our {{starting}} {{point in this}} conceptual paper {{is the assumption that}} place-based approaches can contribute to the sustainable development of communities and regions. In order to enhance sustainable development, adaptations to vulnerabilities and unsustainability require a more place-based approach, using local resources, people’s capacities and the distinctiveness of places for sustainable development. Our aim is to understand how processes of sustainable place-shaping are influenced by human values, rooted in culture. Culture is constructed and plays a mediating role between people and their environment, influencing people’s intentions, way of life, sense of place, practices, norms and rules. In its variety, culture is one of the sources as well as an outcome of distinctiveness between places. Transformation to sustainability is not only driven by practices and political structures, but also by beliefs, values, worldviews and paradigms that influence attitudes and actions. The paper shows how values have been interpreted in different ways in various bodies of literature, as abstract principles and in an instrumental way. Values are not <b>self-standing</b> <b>concepts</b> but are intertwined, context-determined, culturally varied and connected to how we see our self and how we perceive our environment. It is argued that development and engagement of participants’ values can build co-creative capacity in place-based development aimed at sustainability. A distinction is made between an economic, intentional and symbolic approach. A value-oriented approach can provide a more in-depth insight into what people appreciate, feel responsible for and are willing to commit to {{in the context of their}} place...|$|R
