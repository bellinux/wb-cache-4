40|$|The Src-Like Adaptor Protein (<b>SLAP)</b> is an adaptor protein sharing {{considerable}} structural homology with Src. <b>SLAP</b> {{is expressed}} in variety of cells regulating receptor tyrosine kinase signaling by direct association. In this report, we show that <b>SLAP</b> associates with both wild-type and oncogenic c-Kit (c-Kit-D 816 V). The association involves <b>SLAP</b> SH 2 domain and receptor phosphotyrosine residues different from those mediating Src interaction. Association of <b>SLAP</b> triggers c-Kit ubiquitination which, in turn, is followed by receptor degradation. Although <b>SLAP</b> depletion potentiates c-Kit downstream signaling by stabilizing the receptor, it remains non-functional in c-Kit-D 816 V signaling. Ligand-stimulated c-Kit or c-Kit-D 816 V did not alter membrane localization of <b>SLAP.</b> Interestingly oncogenic c-Kit-D 816 V, but not wild-type c-Kit, phosphorylates <b>SLAP</b> on Y 120, Y 258 and Y 273 residues. Physical interaction between c-Kit-D 816 V and <b>SLAP</b> is mandatory for the phosphorylation to take place. Although tyrosine phosphorylated <b>SLAP</b> does not affect c-Kit-D 816 V signaling, mutation of these tyrosine sites to phenylalanine can restore <b>SLAP</b> activity. Taken together the data demonstrate that <b>SLAP</b> negatively regulates wild-type c-Kit signaling, but not its oncogenic counterpart, indicating a possible mechanism by which the oncogenic c-Kit bypasses the normal cellular negative feedback control...|$|R

5|$|Patton did not {{command a}} force in combat for 11 months. In September, Bradley, who was Patton's junior in both rank and experience, was {{selected}} to command the First United States Army forming in England to prepare for Operation Overlord. This decision had been made before the <b>slapping</b> incidents were made public, but Patton blamed them for his being denied the command. Eisenhower felt the invasion of Europe was too important to risk any uncertainty, and that the <b>slapping</b> incidents had been an example of Patton's inability to exercise discipline and self-control. While Eisenhower and Marshall both considered Patton to be a skilled combat commander, they felt Bradley was less impulsive or prone to making mistakes. On January 26, 1944 Patton was formally given command of the Third United States Army in England, a newly arrived unit, and assigned to prepare its inexperienced soldiers for combat in Europe. This duty kept Patton busy in early 1944 preparing for the pending invasion.|$|E
5|$|Seizing the {{opportunity}} the predicament presented, Eisenhower used Patton as a decoy in Operation Fortitude, sending faulty intelligence to German agents that Patton {{was leading the}} Invasion of Europe. While Patton eventually returned to combat command in the European Theater in mid-1944, the <b>slapping</b> incidents were seen by Eisenhower, Marshall, and other leaders to be examples of Patton's brashness and impulsiveness. Patton's career was halted as former subordinates such as Omar Bradley became his superiors.|$|E
5|$|So-called lobtail feeding was {{observed}} in the North Atlantic.

40|$|Regulation of the {{activity}} ofN-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) at glutamatergic synapses is essential for certain forms of synaptic plasticity underlying learning andmemory and is also associated with neurotoxicity and neurodegenerative diseases. In this report, we investigate the role of Src-like adaptor protein (<b>Slap)</b> in NMDA receptor signaling. We present data showing that in dissociated neuronal cultures, activation of ephrin (Eph) receptors by chimeric preclustered eph-Fc ligands leads to re-cruitment of <b>Slap</b> and NMDA receptors at the sites of Eph receptor activation. Interestingly, our data suggest that prolonged ac-tivation of EphA receptors is as efficient in recruiting <b>Slap</b> and NMDA receptors as prolonged activation of EphB receptors. Us-ing established heterologous systems, we examined whether <b>Slap</b> {{is an integral part}} of NMDA receptor signaling. Our results showed that <b>Slap</b> does not alter baseline activity of NMDA receptors and does not affect Src-dependent potentiation of NMDA receptor currents in Xenopus oocytes. We also demonstrate that <b>Slap</b> reduces excitotoxic cell death triggered by activation of NMDARs in HEK 293 cells. Finally, we present evidence showing reduced levels of NMDA receptors in the presence of <b>Slap</b> oc-curring in an activity-dependent manner, suggesting that <b>Slap</b> is part of a mechanism that homeostatically modulates the levels of NMDA receptors. In an effort to identify genes involved in cortical development, wehave previously cloned <b>slap,</b> which encodes a Src-like adaptor protein (<b>Slap)</b> (1). <b>slap</b> is expressed strongly in the forebrain, but its function there remains unknown. <b>slap</b> encodes a 34 -kDa pro...|$|R

5|$|Bottlenose {{dolphins}} live {{in groups}} typically of 10–30 members, called pods, but group size varies from single {{individuals up to}} more than 1,000. Their diets consist mainly of forage fish. Dolphins often work as a team to harvest fish schools, but they also hunt individually. Dolphins search for prey primarily using echolocation, which is similar to sonar. They emit clicking sounds and listen for the return echos to determine the location and shape of nearby items, including potential prey. Bottlenose dolphins also use sound for communication, including squeaks and whistles, as well as sounds emitted through body movements, such as leaping from the water and <b>slapping</b> their tails on the water surface.|$|E

She becomes romantically involved with her colleague, Connor O'Neill (Patrick Harvey), to the disapproval {{of her father}} Rocco (Robert Forza). A feud with Connor's ex-girlfriend, Michelle Scully (Kate Keltie), results in Carmella <b>slapping</b> her and leaving the area. She later returns in 2004, reconciles with Connor and helps him to maintain access to his daughter Madeleine (Madison Lu). To prove that she is business-minded, Carmella becomes a magazine editor. She departs from Erinsborough suddenly after she becomes {{the victim of a}} stalker, Frank Romano (Lliam Amor). Before she leaves, she drives around with a shotgun in an attempt to kill Frank. Upon her return, Carmella loses Connor's affection to Serena Bishop (Lara Sacher). She attempts to ruin their relationship, which results in Serena's mother Liljana (Marcella Russo) <b>slapping</b> her to warn her off. Carmella then tries a different approach; she borrows money from her mother Lucia (Maria Mercedes) to pay for an operation Madeleine needs, then blackmails Connor into spending time with her. She claims to have borrowed the money from a crime mob who are harassing her for repayment, which prompts Connor to steal money to try to pay it back. When Carmella realises the trouble she has caused, she tells Connor the truth and leaves.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe Src-like adaptor protein (<b>Slap)</b> is a {{recently}} identified adaptor protein containing Src homology 3 (SH 3) and SH 2 domains. <b>Slap</b> {{is found in}} a wide range of cell types and was shown to interact with the Eck receptor tyrosine kinase in a yeast two-hybrid interaction screen [1]. Here, we found that <b>Slap</b> is expressed in NIH 3 T 3 cells and could associate with the activated platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor. Using mutated versions of the PDGF receptor and phosphopeptide competition experiments, we determined that <b>Slap</b> has the highest affinity for the Src-binding site of the PDGF receptor. Our inability to produce cell lines that stably expressed <b>Slap</b> suggested that <b>Slap</b> inhibited cell growth. We further investigated this issue by transiently expressing <b>Slap</b> by microinjection. Overexpression of <b>Slap</b> by this method inhibited DNA synthesis induced by PDGF and serum, whereas overexpression of the adaptor proteins Grb 2 and Shc did not. Finally, microinjection of a <b>Slap</b> antibody into NIH 3 T 3 cells that had been stimulated with suboptimal doses of growth factors potentiated the effects of the growth factors. These data suggest that, unlike other adaptor proteins, <b>Slap</b> is a negative regulator of signalling initiated by growth factors...|$|R

40|$|Src-like adaptor protein (<b>SLAP)</b> and c-Cbl {{recently}} {{have been shown}} to cooperate in regulating T cell receptor (TCR) levels in developing T cells. <b>SLAP</b> also is expressed in developing B cells, and its deficiency leads to alterations in B cell receptor (BCR) levels and B cell development. Hence, we hypothesized that <b>SLAP</b> and c-Cbl may cooperate during B cell development to regulate BCR levels. In mice deficient in both <b>SLAP</b> and c-Cbl, we found that B cell development is altered, suggesting that they function through intersecting pathways. To study the mechanism by which <b>SLAP</b> and c-Cbl alter BCR levels, we coexpressed them in a mature mouse B cell line (Bal- 17). First we determined that <b>SLAP</b> associates with proximal components of the BCR complex after stimulation and internalization. Coexpression of <b>SLAP</b> and c-Cbl in Bal- 17 led to decreased surface and total BCR levels. This decrease in BCR levels depended on intact Src homology 2 (SH 2) and C-terminal domains of <b>SLAP.</b> In addition, a mutation in the SH 2 domain of <b>SLAP</b> blocked its colocalization with c-Cbl and the BCR complex, whereas deletion of the C terminus did not affect its localization. Last, coexpression of <b>SLAP</b> and c-Cbl altered BCR complex recycling. This alteration in BCR complex recycling depended on enzymatically active c-Cbl and Src family kinases, as well as the intact SH 2 and C-terminal domains of <b>SLAP.</b> These data suggest that <b>SLAP</b> has a conserved function in B and T cells by adapting c-Cbl to the antigen-receptor complex and targeting it for degradation...|$|R

5|$|Another form of {{acoustic}} communication is the headslap. This typically starts with an {{animal in the}} water elevating its snout and remaining stationary. After some time, the jaws are opened sharply then clamped shut with a biting motion that makes a loud <b>slapping</b> sound, and this is immediately followed by a loud splash, after which the head may be submerged and copious bubbles produced. Some species then roar, while others slap the water with their tails. Episodes of headslapping spread through the group. The purpose varies, {{but it seems to}} be associated with maintaining social relationships, and is also used in courtship. Dominant individuals may also display their body size while swimming at the water surface, and a subordinate will submit by holding its head at an acute angle with the jaws open before retreating underwater.|$|E

40|$|Engagement of the T cell antigen {{receptor}} (TCR) leads to rapid activation of protein tyrosine kinases, {{which in turn}} phosphorylate downstream enzymes and adapter proteins. Some adapter proteins, such as SLP- 76, Vav, and LAT, positively regulate TCR-mediated signal transduction, whereas others, such as Cbl, play an inhibitory role. <b>SLAP</b> (Src-like adapter protein), an adapter protein containing a Src homology 3 and a Src homology 2 domain, was isolated from a yeast interacting screen by using N-terminal Cbl as bait. N-terminal Cbl interacts with <b>SLAP</b> in vivo and in vitro in a tyrosine phosphorylation-independent manner. We observed that <b>SLAP</b> is expressed in T cells, and upon TCR activation, <b>SLAP</b> interacts with ZAP- 70, Syk, LAT, and TCRζ chain in Jurkat T cells.
