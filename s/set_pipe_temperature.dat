The heat leak from the cryogenic pipe and the eect of reducing the outer <b>pipe</b> <b>temperature</b> were tested. The heat leak from the cryogenic pipe was improved relative to that recorded during the second cooling test performedintheprevious summer,a season similartothatin whichthe fourth cooling testwas conducted.

50|$|It is also {{possible}} to control Legionella risks by chemical treatment of the water. This technique allows lower water temperatures to be maintained in the pipework without the associated Legionella risk.

40|$|A {{heat pipe}} {{radiator}} consisting of 100 sodium-filled, 1. 91 -cm OD, stainless steel heat pipes {{has been tested}} at temperatures up to 760 C. This radiator was initially designed to have a heat <b>pipe</b> <b>temperature</b> of 740 C with a central coolant channel temperature of 771 C. The as-fabricated radiator heat <b>pipe</b> <b>temperatures</b> varied from 605 C to 700 C when the central coolant channel average temperature was 740 C. The heat pipes operated at 25 C to 110 C lower-than-expected temperatures, resulting in a 43 kW heat rejection capability vs the 50 kW design goal and the 65 kW ultimate capability of the radiator. The 43 kW heat rejection yields a mass/heat rejection ratio of 0. 182 kg/kWt which is good for this early state-of-the-art heat pipe radiator. An end-of-mission life specific weight of 0. 154 kg/kW is apparently achievable with improvements in radiator fabrication and brazing techniques...|$|R

50|$|The maximum {{take-off}} thrust {{available from the}} Pegasus engine is limited, particularly at the higher ambient temperatures, by the turbine blade temperature.

40|$|Energy use can {{be reduced}} by highly {{insulating}} screens. The problem with screens is that less condensation occurs at the cold glass in the greenhouse roof. The two common methods of moisture control, screen gaps and use of minimum <b>pipe</b> <b>temperature,</b> require both a lot of energy. Therefore this research looked for another method to prevent the moisture problem. In this trial is that in principle forced ventilation with preheated air from outside. Also, the heating regime changed, that no minimum <b>pipe</b> <b>temperature</b> is <b>set.</b> This test showed that significant energy savings through a double screen are possible and through additional measures such as no minimum <b>pipe</b> to <b>set</b> and screens only open when the sun has more power. The extra screen can longer remain closed due to good humidity control (for heating dry air requires relatively little energy). Vertical gradients were low, {{partly due to the}} almost constant flow of Aircobreeze. The lower production observed may partly be due to lower CO 2 and higher night temperatures...|$|R

40|$|The {{vertical}} {{temperature profile}} in a rose flower production operation {{is a problem}} when artificial light is used. Without additional measures the lamps increase {{the temperature in the}} upper layer of the canopy. That is why usually a heating <b>pipe</b> <b>temperature</b> between 40 - 50 0 C under the canopy is maintained, even in summer. Also, horizontal temperature differences are caused by internal air circulation that have a relation with the vertical temperature differences. That circulation is the result of warm air rising and cold air dropping through pores or small openings in a screen. An increase in light intensity or in the size of a greenhouse compartment will make the temperature differences bigger. The best solution to these problems is to keep an airtight screen fully closed, mix the air in the greenhouse vertically with a fan and to introduce cold and dry air from above the screen with a second fan. The vertical fan will push the heat produced by the lamps down. This solution reduces vertical and horizontal temperature differences and makes it possible to lower the <b>pipe</b> <b>temperature.</b> The result is an effective reduction of light emission without negative climate effects and a 30 % reduction of heat to be ventilated...|$|R
