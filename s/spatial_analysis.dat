25|$|In the 20th century, aerial photography, {{satellite}} imagery, {{and remote}} sensing provided efficient, precise methods for mapping physical features, such as coastlines, roads, buildings, watersheds, and topography. Advancements in electronic technology ushered in another revolution in cartography. Ready availability {{of computers and}} peripherals such as monitors, plotters, printers, scanners (remote and document) and analytic stereo plotters, along with computer programs for visualization, image processing, <b>spatial</b> <b>analysis,</b> and database management, democratized and greatly expanded the making of maps. The ability to superimpose spatially located variables onto existing maps created new uses for maps and new industries to explore and exploit these potentials. See also digital raster graphic.|$|E

These tools can be even more powerful when they are integrated with methods for <b>spatial</b> data <b>analysis.</b> In this context, we provide several examples that show the power of exploratory <b>spatial</b> data <b>analysis</b> (ESDA) within a GIS and how this can provide the foundation for more sophisticated probabilistic modeling. While the ESRI’s ArcGIS software now facilitates the integration of <b>spatial</b> data <b>analysis</b> and GIS functionality, more tools are needed for comprehensive <b>spatial</b> data <b>analysis.</b> We suggest how to implement additional spatial statistical methods within a GIS, including methods for using non-Euclidean distances {{in the analysis of}} geostatistical, lattice, and point pattern data...|$|R
25|$|The {{question}} of neighbourhood security {{has been a}} constant focus of research since Oscar Newman's work. New research has expanded the discussion on this disputed issue. A recent study did extensive <b>spatial</b> <b>analysis</b> and correlated several building, site plan and social factors with crime frequencies and identified subtle nuances to the contrasting positions. The study looked at, among others, dwelling types, unit density (site density) movement on the street, culs–de-sac or grids and the permeability of a residential area. Among its conclusions are, respectively, that flats are always safer than houses and the wealth of inhabitants matters, density is generally beneficial but more so at ground level, local movement is beneficial, but not larger scale movement, relative affluence and the number of neighbours have a greater effect than either being on a cul-de-sac or being on a through street. It also re-established that simple, linear culs-de-sac with good numbers of dwellings that are joined to through streets tend to be safe. As for permeability, it suggests that residential areas should be permeable enough to allow movement in all directions but no more. The overprovision of poorly used permeability is a crime hazard. The open, uniform grid could be seen as an example of undifferentiated permeability.|$|E

[...] As a basis for this plot twist, Crichton cited the peer reviewed scientific article by Doran, et al. Peter Doran, the lead author of the paper cited by Crichton, stated [...] "...our results have been misused as 'evidence' against global warming by Crichton in his novel 'State of Fear'...'Our study did find that 58 percent of Antarctica cooled from 1966 to 2000.
