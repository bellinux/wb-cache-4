5|$|Near the Canadian {{side of the}} {{restored}} trenches is a small memorial plaque dedicated to Lieutenant-Colonel Mike Watkins MBE. Watkins was head of Explosive Ordnance Disposal at the Directorate of Land <b>Service</b> <b>Ammunition,</b> Royal Logistic Corps, and a leading British explosive ordnance disposal expert. In August 1998, he died in a roof collapse near a tunnel entrance while undertaking a detailed investigative survey of the British tunnel system {{on the grounds of}} the Canadian National Vimy Memorial site. Watkins was no stranger to the tunnel system at Vimy Ridge. Earlier the same year, he participated in the successful disarming of 3 tonnes of deteriorated ammonal explosives located under a road intersection on the site.|$|E
5|$|The upper {{handling}} {{room was}} {{just below the}} visible part of the mount. It was armored and reinforced to support {{the weight of the}} mount. A person standing in the upper handling room could look up and see the bottom of the gun mount inside the training circle on which the mount rotated. Hanging from the mount, and rotating with it, was the equipment used to pass ammunition up to the mount. This included the lower ends of the projectile and powder case hoists. In {{the center of the room}} there was a vertical tube that also turned with the mount. This tube enclosed the electrical power and control cables going up to the mount. Around the perimeter of the upper handling room were the ready <b>service</b> <b>ammunition</b> racks welded to the bulkheads. Close by, either in a corner of the handling room or in an adjoining compartment was the upper end of an ammunition hoist from the magazine. The responsibility of the men stationed in the upper handling room was to shuttle 30 to 40 projectiles and 30 to 40 powder cases per minute from the ready service racks to the hoists while avoiding the equipment rotating with the mount. During quiet spells, they would replenish the ready service racks with ammunition from the magazines.|$|E
25|$|The Japanese {{captured}} enough Thompson M1928 SMGs {{and ammunition}} when they captured Hong Kong and Malaysia {{that it became}} a limited standard weapon.

25|$|Helena {{began to}} flood {{and a slight}} list {{of no more than}} five degrees was {{maintained}} by counter-flooding. Only one of the two engine rooms and one boiler room were flooded. Wiring to the main and secondary gun batteries was severed, but prompt action by damage control brought the forward diesel generator up within minutes, making power available to all gun mounts, for fire fighting and counter-flooding. With attacking planes flying overhead, the crew began to break out the <b>service</b> <b>ammunition,</b> and by 0801 hours the ship began to fight back by sending up anti-aircraft fire.|$|E

[...] Some MP 34 submachine guns were also issued in this caliber in addition to 9mm Mauser. When the Austrian Army was incorporated in the Wehrmacht in 1938 following the Anschluss, many M1912 pistols and MP 34 submachine guns were rebarrelled to 9×19mm Parabellum for standardization purposes.|$|E

50|$|Ready <b>service</b> <b>{{ammunition}}</b> is that ammunition {{located in}} close proximity to a military or naval gun and is stored in such a manner that it is ready for quick use. Boxes located near a gun are sometimes termed ready boxes. They are designed to keep a small amount of ammunition dry and free of contaminants while affording ready access by gun crews.|$|E
50|$|Camp Caves was {{the camp}} for the 24th Infantry Division, which was also called the Hawaiian Division. It was called Camp Caves after the small town, The Caves, which {{was close to the}} campsite. The site was {{along the side of the}} Bruce Highway. It {{included}} medical <b>services,</b> warehouses, <b>ammunition</b> dumps, landing strips, and a small arms firing range. Work on building the camp began in November 1942 but was soon stopped. It started again in July 1943. The camp was no longer used after March 1944.|$|R

25|$|Wartime {{temporarily}} interrupted {{production of}} civilian specification propellants, as major quantities of new specifications were manufactured. Number 4831 {{was used to}} load navy anti-aircraft machine gun ammunition, and number 4895 was used to load United States <b>service</b> rifle <b>ammunition.</b> As these propellants became military surplus after the war, large quantities of different batches were blended together to make products with uniform average performance for sale to civilians. Manufacture of these specifications for civilian use resumed after military surplus had been exhausted; but reaction characteristics were slightly different from the products distributed from military surplus supplies.|$|R

50|$|Governmental organizations, like {{military}} and police forces and other firearms bearing public power agencies, from the C.I.P. member states are legally exempted from having to comply with C.I.P. rulings. This does not automatically imply that all firearms and ammunitions used by governmental organizations in C.I.P. member states are not C.I.P. compliant, since those organizations often choose to self-impose the relevant C.I.P. standards for their <b>service</b> firearms and <b>ammunition.</b>|$|R

As the guns are listed for which the ammunition can be used, the Treatise also constitutes a list of guns in service at the publication date.|$|E
50|$|In 1932 Sweden {{introduced}} the 8×63mm patron m/32 loaded with 14.2 g spitzer bullets with a boat tail fired at a muzzle velocity of 760 m/s bullets. The 8×63mm patron m/32 ammunition was not developed as general <b>service</b> <b>ammunition</b> but for anti-aircraft and indirect fire {{and had an}} effective range of approximately 3600 m on which the impact energy was , and a maximum range of approximately 5500 m when fired from a kulspruta m/36 machine gun.|$|E
25|$|Arriving at Plymouth on 12 March, the 11th BAC {{establishment}} was {{to include}} dedicated General <b>Service</b> (GS) <b>ammunition</b> wagons (with limber), one wagon per howitzer, and one GS wagon for stores, {{with at least}} 132 horses (both riding and draft, using six per wagon). The Column’s 'operational' task was to have available (carry) a constant supply, and bring forward (on-call), forty-eight rounds per howitzer, to a Firing Battery’s entrenched position, or to supply it to the Battery’s own ammunition wagon lines. Working mostly at night, moving forward, the BAC ammunition wagons were interchangeable with a Firing Batteries own ammunition wagons (one per gun), so full wagons could be easily 'dropped-off', being unhooked and taken away for reloading, a howitzer battery looking to 'always have' available 108 rounds.|$|R
50|$|The field {{carriage}} {{was made}} of wrought iron. No limber was used in naval <b>service,</b> but two <b>ammunition</b> boxes (each containing nine rounds) could be lashed to the axle of the field carriage. Members of the gun crew also carried a single round in an ammunition pouch. The smoothbore boat howitzers fired shell, shrapnel, and canister. The rifled 12-pounder fired shot and shell. Percussion primers were used in naval service, but the howitzers could also use friction primers obtained from the army.|$|R
5|$|The game {{takes place}} across {{a variety of}} levels, many of which require certain {{objectives}} to be performed to progress. Sir Daniel Fortesque can use a variety of weapons, consisting of close range weapons such as swords and clubs to long range weapons such as crossbows. Many can be charged for a powerful attack and some, such as the club, can be used to access areas that are otherwise inaccessible. When not possessing any items, Dan is able to rip his arm off and use it for both melee and ranged attacks. Dan can equip a shield alongside weapons for defence; though they have limited strength before breaking. Throughout the game, Dan can visit gargoyle heads of two varieties: green ones offer Dan information while blue ones allow Dan to buy <b>services</b> or <b>ammunition</b> by using the treasures he finds.|$|R
