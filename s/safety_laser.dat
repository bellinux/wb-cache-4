40|$|Fire {{is one of}} {{the serious}} {{potential}} hazards to most structures and damage assessment is the first and the most important job for structural safety evaluation of a structure subjected to fire. The extensive use of concrete as a structural material has neccessitated an investigation into more robust and cost-effective techniques for the assessment of fire-damaged concrete using terrestrial laser scanning. Although concrete is known to be a fire resistant structural material, it undergoes severe changes when exposed to elevated temperatures and this can affect the load bearing capacity of structural bearing elements in several ways. Apart from spalling, there can be a permanent loss of strength in the remaining material. In the aftermath of a fire on a structure, various workers get involved in a variety of response and recovery from disaster operations. Furthermore, following a catastrophic failure of a structure after a fire, rescue workers and emergency responders may be required to enter the fire-damaged structure which can be risky and so an assessment method which has the potential to improve safety was investigated. Within the field of structural and civil engineering, the methods employed in assessing fire-damaged concrete involve both field and laboratory investigations {{to determine the extent of}} fire damage in order to design appropriate and cost effective repairs or to decide whether to demolition the structure. Concrete structures show significant loss of strength when heated above 300 ºC. This study aimed at investigating whether terrestrial laser scanning can be used to detect fire-damaged concrete using specimens heated up to 1000 ºC as it is important to estimate the maximum temperature attained in a fire. The results obtained from the study clearly demonstrated the feasibility of using terrestrial laser scanning to detect fire-damaged concrete via modelling and analysis of laser returned intensity. Laser scanning has emerged as a complementary assessment method of fire-damaged concrete with a couple of advantages in that the whole concrete element can be scanned and an average intensity value over the area concerned can be determined which would represent the whole element overcoming the challenge of some traditional methods where cores are drilled in limited areas. Scanning is rapid with millions of points measured in a few seconds. Laser scanning of the fire-damaged structure can be done from a distance without having to enter the structure and this improves <b>safety.</b> <b>Laser</b> scanning is a non-destructive technique for detecting fire-damaged concrete...|$|E
40|$|A robot is {{a machine}} that embodies decades of {{research}} and development. Born as a simple mechanical devices, these machines evolved together with our technology and knowledge, reaching levels of automation never imagined before. The modern dream {{is represented by the}} cooperative robotics, where the robots do not just work for the people, but together with the people. Such result can be achieved only if these machines are able to acquire knowledge through perception, in other words they need to collect sensor measurements from which they extract meaningful information of the environment in order to adapt their behavior. This thesis speaks about the topic of the autonomous object recognition and picking for Automated Guided Vehicles, AGVs, robots employed nowadays in the automatic logistic plants. The development of a technology capable of achieving such task would be a significant technological improvement compared to the structure currently used in this field: rigid, strongly constrained and with a very limited human machine interaction. Automating the process of picking by making such vehicles more smart would open to many possibilities, both in terms of organization of the plants, both for the remarkable economic implications deriving from the abatement of many of the associated fixed costs. The logistics field is indeed a niche, in which the costs of the technology represent the true limit to its spread, costs due mainly to the limitations of the current technology. The work is therefore aimed at creating a stand-alone technology, usable directly on board of the modern AGVs, with minimal modifications in terms of hardware and software. The elements that made possible such development are the multi-sensor approach and data-fusion. The thesis starts with the analysis {{of the state of the}} art related of the field of the automated logistic, focusing mostly on the most innovative applications and researches on the automatization of the load/unload of the goods in the modern logistic plants. What emerges form the analysis it is that there is a technological gap between the world of the research and the industrial reality: the results and solutions proposed by the first seem not match the requirements and specification of the second. The second part of the thesis is dedicated to the sensors used: industrial cameras, planar 2 D <b>safety</b> <b>laser</b> scanners and 3 D time of flight cameras (TOF). For every device a specific (and independent) process is developed in order to recognize and localize Euro pallets: the information that AGVs require in order to perform the picking of an object are the three coordinates that define its pose in the 2 D space, [x,y,θ], position and attitude. The focus is addressed both on the maximization of the reliability of the algorithms and both on the capability in providing a correct estimation of uncertainty of the results. The information content that comes from the uncertainty represents a key aspect for this work, in which the probabilistic characterization of the results and the adoption of the guidelines of the measurement field are the basis for a new approach to the problem. That allowed both the modification of state of the art algorithms both the development of new ones, developing a system that in the final implementation and tests has shown a reliability in the identification process sufficiently high to fulfill the industrial standards, 99 % of positive identifications. The third part is devoted to the calibration of system. In order to ensure a reliable process of identification and picking it is indeed fundamental to evaluate the relations between the sensing devices, sensor-sensor calibration, but also to relate the results obtained with the machine, sensor-robot calibration. These calibrations are critical steps that characterize the measurement chain between the target object and the robot controller. From that chain depends the overall accuracy in performing the forking procedure and, more important, the safety of such operation. The fourth part represents the core element of the thesis, the fusion of the identifications obtained from the different sensors. The multi-sensor approach is a strategy that allows the overcome of possible operational limits due to the measurement capabilities of the individual sensors, taking the best from the different devices and thus improving the performance of the entire system. This is particularly true in the case in which there are independent information sources, these, once fused, provide results way more reliable than the simple comparison of the data. Because of the different typology of the sensors involved, Cartesian ones like the laser and the TOF, and perspective ones like the camera, a specific fusion strategy is developed. The main benefit that the fusion provides is a reliable rejection of the possible false positives, which could cause very dangerous situations like the impact with objects or worst. A further contribution of this thesis is the risk prediction for the maneuver of picking. Knowing the uncertainty in the identification process, in calibration and in the motion of the vehicle it is possible to evaluate the confidence interval associated to a safe forking, the one that occurs without impact between the tines and the pallet. That is critical for the decision making logic of the AGV in order to ensure a safe functionality of the machine during all daily operations. Last part of the thesis presents the experimental results. The aforementioned topics have been implemented on a real robot, testing the behavior of the developed algorithms in various operative conditions. ...|$|E
