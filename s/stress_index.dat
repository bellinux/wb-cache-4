40|$|Abstract. The ASME B&PV Code {{requires}} {{non-destructive examination}} (NDE) {{to ensure that}} the welds has high quality against flaws because the welds are suspect as having a lower fatigue life than base metal. If a full NDE is applied, the welds will have the fatigue life equivalent to that evaluated by S-N curve of base metal in the ASME B&PV Code. With change of NDE implementation, the fatigue-strength-reduction factors (FSRFs) or local <b>stress</b> <b>indices</b> should or can be changed in order to ensure the integrity or to reduce the conservatism. In this paper, the local <b>stress</b> <b>indices</b> of two welds on reactor coolant system (RCS) branch lines are determined according to seven quality levels for NDE application and weld types. The fatigue lifetimes of two welds are evaluated by using the local <b>stress</b> <b>indices</b> based on NDE.

40|$|It is {{expected}} that the biomass productivity of forest stands will be influenced by global climate change. In order to adapt forest management to this fact a model based approach was developed in cooperation with forestry experts. The concept aims at detecting the link between climate, terrain and soil parameters with the biomass productivity of some tree species. This article gives an insight into the first two steps of this approach. At first the WaSiM-ETH 8. 2 model was parameterised to simulate various forest sites. Furthermore, different drought <b>stress</b> <b>indices</b> were applied to the simulated water balance time series. The impact of variations of climate, topography and soil characteristics on water balance was plausibly simulated. All drought <b>stress</b> <b>indices</b> detected years which were dominated by dry conditions. However, the indices related to soil water content were more selective than those related to evapotranspiration.

Research indicates that narrow band <b>stress</b> <b>indices</b> derived from hyperspectral imagery should have improved sensitivity to provide more specific information on the type and cause of crop stress, Under funding from the NASA Earth Observation Commercial Applications Program (EOCAP) we are identifying and evaluating scientific and commercial applications of hyperspectral imagery for the remote characterization of agricultural crop stress. During the summer of 1999 a field experiment was conducted with varying nitrogen treatments on a production corn-field in eastern Nebraska. The AVIRIS (Airborne Visible-Infrared Imaging Spectrometer) hyperspectral imager was flown at two critical dates during crop development, at two different altitudes, providing images with approximately 18 m pixels and 3 m pixels. Simultaneous supporting soil and crop characterization included spectral reflectance measurements above the canopy, biomass characterization, soil sampling, and aerial photography. In this paper we describe the experiment and results, and examine the following three issues relative to the utility of hyperspectral imagery for scientific study and commercial crop stress products: (1) Accuracy of reflectance derived <b>stress</b> <b>indices</b> relative to conventional measures of stress. We compare reflectance-derived indices (both field radiometer and AVIRIS) with applied nitrogen and with leaf level measurement of nitrogen availability and chlorophyll concentrations over the experimental plots (4 replications of 5 different nitrogen levels); (2) Ability of the hyperspectral sensors to detect sub-pixel areas under crop stress. We applied the <b>stress</b> <b>indices</b> to both the 3 m and 18 m AVIRIS imagery for the entire production corn field using several sub-pixel areas within the field to compare the relative sensitivity of each stress index; and (3) Comparative sensitivity of <b>stress</b> <b>indices</b> to realistic measurement uncertainties.

40|$|AbstractDrought is a {{major cause}} of yield loss for many {{important}} crops including maize. Therefore, the development and release of drought tolerant varieties that will yield well under a broad range of environmental conditions is an important breeding goal. Several <b>stress</b> <b>indices</b> have been developed, aiming to assist identification and selection of stable, high-yielding, drought tolerant genotypes. A novel equation (B value) that predicts crop yield potential of a genotype at normal farming densities has been also suggested 1. The estimation of B value relies on plant yield potential at ultra-low densities and on the coefficient of variation (CV) of individual plants. The present study aimed to investigate the tolerance of inbred lines and their correspondent hybrids using <b>stress</b> tolerant <b>indices</b> and compare them with the B values. Therefore, we used thirty one maize inbred lines and their correspondent hybrids under ultra-spaced and highly dense and under two different water regimes (normal and drought conditions) in three different areas in Greece during the 2012 and 2013 growing season, respectively. The inbred lines and the hybrids were evaluated using grain yield and for each genotype, B value and nine other <b>stress</b> <b>indices</b> based on their yield under normal and water stress conditions were calculated, including <b>stress</b> susceptibility <b>index</b> (SSI), mean relative performance (MRP), stress tolerance (TOL), mean productivity 2 (MP), relative efficiency <b>index</b> (REI), <b>stress</b> tolerant <b>index</b> 3 (STI), geometric mean of productivity (GMP), yield index (YI) and harmonic mean 4 (HM). It was found a strong and positive correlation (P< 0. 001) of B values with all indices, except SSI, for all experimental locations. These results suggest that B value matches the ability of the other <b>stress</b> <b>indices</b> to identify drought sensitive and tolerant genotypes and is an effective selection criterion for high yielding genotypes with stable performance under variable environmental conditions...|$|R

Compared to the reference site, significant elevations in J. maritimus shoot mercury and the oxidative <b>stress</b> <b>indices</b> such as H 2 O 2, lipid peroxidation, electrolyte leakage and reactive carbonyls were maximum at the site with highest followed by moderate and the lowest mercury contamination. Significantly elevated activity of non-glutathione-based H 2 O 2 -metabolizing enzymes such as ascorbate peroxidase and catalase accompanied the studied damage-endpoint responses, whereas the activity of glutathione-based H 2 O 2 -scavenging enzymes glutathione peroxidase and glutathione sulfo-transferase was inhibited. Concomitantly, significantly enhanced glutathione reductase activity and the contents of both reduced and oxidized glutathione were perceptible in high mercury-exhibiting shoots.

50|$|The Weather <b>Stress</b> <b>Index,</b> or WSI, is a {{relative}} measure of the weather conditions, often used as a comfort indicator. The index, a number between 0 and 100, represents the percentage {{of time in the}} past with temperatures below the current temperature, for a given location, day and time. This makes the index a local measure based in past weather conditions. For example, if for a given location, on the 25th of July at 13:00 UTC the WSI is 85 for a temperature of 42 C, this means that the temperature was inferior to 42 °C in 85% of the time in the past, on the same place, on the 25th of July at 13:00 UTC (and superior to 42 °C in 15% of the time on the same place, day and hour). In other words, the WSI gives the probability of finding a smaller temperature in the local weather history, at a given day and time, than that of the present measurement. Therefore, high values of WSI predict {{a relative}} discomfort from excessive heat for local inhabitants.|$|E

Due to {{its ability to}} provide insight into human behavior, emotions, and development, {{it has been used}} to investigate psychological phenomenon such as anxiety, depression, PTSD, and other behavioral disorders. Its primary purpose is to test cortisol and alpha amylase levels, which are indicative of stress levels. Salivary cortisol is a good <b>stress</b> <b>index,</b> with increased levels of cortisol correlating positively with increased levels of stress. Cortisol levels rise slowly over time and take a while to return to base level, indicating that cortisol is more associated with chronic stress levels. Alpha amylase, on the other hand, spikes quickly when confronted with a stressor and returns to baseline soon after the stress has passed, making salivary amylase measurement a powerful tool for psychological research studying acute stress responses. Samples are usually collected from participants by having them drool through a straw into a collection tube while experiencing a stimulus, with samples taken every few minutes to record the gradual change in stress hormone levels. Because the collection of saliva samples is non-invasive, it has the advantage of not introducing further stress on the participant that may otherwise distort results. [...] In more specific studies looking at the link between cortisol levels and psychological phenomena, it has been found that chronic stressors such as life-threatening situations (example: diseases), depression, and social or economic hardship correlate with significantly higher cortisol levels. In situations where a subject undergoes induced anxiety, high cortisol levels correspond with experiencing more physiological symptoms of nervousness, such as increased heart rate, sweating, and skin conductance. Additionally, a negative correlation was discovered between baseline levels of cortisol and aggression. Salivary cortisol levels can thus provide insight into a number of other psychological processes.|$|E
