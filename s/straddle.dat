5|$|The {{match that}} {{followed}} was between Shawn Michaels and Intercontinental Champion Chris Jericho. The {{start of the}} match saw Michaels and Jericho exchange several near-falls attempts before Michaels applied a modified figure four leglock, which Jericho broke free. Jericho applied the Walls of Jericho but Michaels grabbed the bottom rope, causing Jericho to break the hold. Jericho attempted the Walls of Jericho again, but Michaels countered into a <b>straddle</b> pin to take the win. After the match, both men shook hands.|$|E

5|$|The {{state of}} Oregon in the United States has {{established}} an international reputation for its production of wine, ranking {{fourth in the}} country behind California, Washington, and New York. Oregon has several different growing regions within the state's borders that are well-suited to the cultivation of grapes; additional regions <b>straddle</b> the border between Oregon and the states of Washington and Idaho. Wine making dates back to pioneer times in the 1840s, with commercial production beginning in the 1960s.|$|E
5|$|The urban environs of {{the city}} of Canberra <b>straddle</b> the Ginninderra plain, Molonglo plain, the Limestone plain, and the Tuggeranong plain (Isabella's Plain). The Molonglo River which flows across the Molonglo plain has been dammed to form the {{national}} capital's iconic feature Lake Burley Griffin. The Molonglo then flows into the Murrumbidgee north-west of Canberra, which in turn flows north-west toward the New South Wales town of Yass. The Queanbeyan River joins the Molonglo River at Oaks Estate just within the ACT.|$|E
5|$|Jumping {{technique}} {{has played a}} significant part {{in the history of}} the event. High jumpers typically cleared the bar feet first in the late 19th century, using either the Scissors, Eastern cut-off or Western roll technique. The <b>straddle</b> technique became prominent in the mid-20th century, but Dick Fosbury overturned tradition by pioneering a backwards and head-first technique in the late 1960s – the Fosbury Flop – which won him the gold at the 1968 Olympics. This {{technique has}} become the overwhelming standard for the sport from the 1980s onwards. The standing high jump was contested at the Olympics from 1900 to 1912, but is now relatively uncommon outside of its use as an exercise drill.|$|E

5|$|NY32B, as routed at {{the time}} of its removal, began at the {{intersection}} of Boulevard (then-NY32), Warren Street (NY32 west of Boulevard), and Highland Avenue east of Glens Falls in the Warren County town of Queensbury. The route headed east along Warren Street (here named Lower Warren Street), paralleling the eastern bank of the Hudson River. It crossed over the Glens Falls Feeder Canal prior to reaching the Warren–Washington county line. Here, Warren Street turns north to <b>straddle</b> the county line; however, NY32B continued southeastward into Hudson Falls on River Street. NY32B ended five blocks later at a junction with US4 in downtown Hudson Falls.|$|E
5|$|On {{a garden}} scale, the berries should be picked when dry and ripe. Commercially, most {{harvesting}} is done mechanically by <b>straddle</b> harvesters. These move continually down the rows, straddling {{a row of}} bushes, shaking the branches and stripping off the fruit. The blackcurrants are placed into half tonne bins and to minimise stoppage time, some machines have cross conveyors which direct the fruit into continuously moving trailers in the adjoining row. A modern machine can pick up to fifty tonnes of blackcurrants in a day using only one operator and two tractor drivers. The bins should be stored in a cool place. Some fruit is still picked by hand {{for use in the}} fresh fruit market.|$|E

5|$|The first {{large-scale}} {{testing of}} the rocket launchers {{took place at the}} end of 1938, when 233 rounds of various types were used. A salvo of rockets could completely <b>straddle</b> a target at a range of 5,500 metres (3.4mi). But the artillery branch was not fond of the Katyusha, because it took up to 50 minutes to load and fire 24 rounds, while a conventional howitzer could fire 95 to 150 rounds in the same time. Testing with various rockets was conducted through 1940, and the BM-13-16 with launch rails for sixteen rockets was authorized for production. Only forty launchers were built before Germany invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941.|$|E
5|$|US-60 next {{comes to}} a {{junction}} with SH-123 as it enters Bartlesville. The SH-123 junction lies a few feet into Washington County; south of the junction, US-60 and SH-123 form a concurrency, and the two routes curve slightly {{to the west and}} <b>straddle</b> the Washington–Osage county line. After only , US-60 turns to the east along Adams Boulevard, splitting away from SH-123, and fully enters Washington County. US-60 runs through downtown Bartlesville on Adams, then bridges the Caney River. The highway continues to an interchange with US-75. At this interchange, US-60 turns south and overlaps US-75 before splitting off to the east once again, leaving Bartlesville and, soon, Washington County behind.|$|E
5|$|Gamma delta T cells (γδ T cells) {{possess an}} {{alternative}} T-cell receptor (TCR) {{as opposed to}} CD4+ and CD8+ (αβ) T cells and share the characteristics of helper T cells, cytotoxic T cells and NK cells. The conditions that produce responses from γδ T cells are not fully understood. Like other 'unconventional' T cell subsets bearing invariant TCRs, such as CD1d-restricted Natural Killer T cells, γδ T cells <b>straddle</b> the border between innate and adaptive immunity. On one hand, γδ T cells are a component of adaptive immunity as they rearrange TCR genes to produce receptor diversity and can also develop a memory phenotype. On the other hand, the various subsets {{are also part of}} the innate immune system, as restricted TCR or NK receptors may be used as pattern recognition receptors. For example, large numbers of human Vγ9/Vδ2 T cells respond within hours to common molecules produced by microbes, and highly restricted Vδ1+ T cells in epithelia respond to stressed epithelial cells.|$|E

5|$|NY5 {{enters the}} city of Utica on a {{concurrency}} with NY12 heading in a northeast direction. It shortly picks up NY8, and all three cross the city together. NY5 also intersects with the terminus of NY840 at this point. Just south of the New York State Thruway, I-790 begins as a short expressway, also including NY5, NY8, and NY12. After crossing out of the city, they meet the Thruway, with NY8 and12 continuing northeast, while I-790 and NY5 turn to the east-south-east, picking up the tail-end of NY49. These three, still as an expressway, <b>straddle</b> {{each side of the}} Thruway for a short way, with I-790 technically ending at the ramps for I-90. NY5 continues {{to the end of the}} expressway, only a few hundred feet later, dropping to Leland Avenue. A few hundred feet to the north of the Thruway, NY5 turns eastward again to continue down Herkimer Road. It closely parallels the Thruway all the way to Herkimer, where NY5 moves slightly northward through the center of the village, becoming State Street, while I-90 crosses the Erie Canal and goes south for a short distance. There is a short concurrency with NY28 in the village.|$|E
5|$|The 2000s saw {{formation}} of several pioneering Oriental metal bands from the Arab world, the best-known {{of which is}} Myrath from Tunisia. They have released four albums (three internationally) and have toured in Europe with Orphaned Land. Their sound combined progressive metal (in the vein of Dream Theater, et al.) with specifically Arab & North African melodies and themes. The Kordz from Lebanon <b>straddle</b> the line between hard rock and progressive metal, and again draw on local folk melodies (produced mainly via keyboards) to broaden the sonic palette. Hard rock band Lazywall from Morocco frequently makes use of oud and djembe in their music, producing something analogous to Oriental metal (though generally no heavier than Alice in Chains). North Africa has had a growing metal scene for some time, {{and a few of}} those bands have ventured into folk-metal, notably Andaz Azzul from Algeria, which blends Berber melodies & themes with violin and metal. And Egypt's truly path-breaking female-fronted Oriental metal band Massive Scar Era has recently broken through and has posted official videos on YouTube, though they continue to face considerable discrimination at home, with frontwoman Sherine reporting harassment on account of her participation. Their sound has broadened to include the heavy use of violin (in effect making them a folk-metal band, rather than simply another of the growing profusion of heavy metal bands in the Middle East).|$|E
