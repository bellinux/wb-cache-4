40|$|Abstract The {{revitalization}} {{of the role}} of <b>social</b> studies <b>learning</b> is important to be done as soon as possible because so far the implementation of <b>social</b> studies <b>learning</b> is not relevant to the goals and purposes of <b>social</b> studies <b>learning.</b> Actually, <b>social</b> studies <b>learning</b> {{play an important role in}} character education. Therefore it is necessary to make improvement upgrading steps. The curriculum design and competence standard of graduates should be based on student reality and humanity values, and is not only emphasized on material mastery. The approach of essentialism has to be changed by the social reconstruction theory. The learning process is developed as a cultural transaction process which becomes a united part of student character development. The learning model is more emphasized on active and participative learning. Besides, in order to strengthen the role of <b>social</b> studies <b>learning</b> in developing character education, a good environment condition including the political will from the government, is badly needed...|$|R

Joint attention is also important for <b>social</b> <b>learning.</b> Gaze following reflects an expectation-based type of orienting in which an individual's attention is cued by another's head turn or eye turn. Individuals are motivated to follow another's gaze and engage in joint attention because gaze is a cue for which rewarding events occur.|$|E
5|$|The jurist Richard Posner saw Tripp as {{reviving}} psychiatrist Richard von Krafft-Ebing's {{theory that}} masturbation helps to cause homosexuality by fixating a {{boy on the}} male genitals, based on evidence that homosexuals begin masturbating earlier than heterosexuals. Posner criticized the theory {{on the grounds that}} homosexuality and early masturbation could both be effects of whatever factor might be responsible for causing homosexuality. The geneticist Dean Hamer wrote that The Homosexual Matrix was influential and that Tripp provided the clearest articulation of the <b>social</b> <b>learning</b> theory of sexual orientation. However, Hamer found the theory itself implausible, and rejected it on numerous grounds, arguing that it is inconsistent with anthropological evidence and human evolutionary history, and fails to explain the existence of homosexuality.|$|E
5|$|Mu {{waves are}} thought to be {{indicative}} of an infant’s developing ability to imitate. This is important because the ability to imitate plays a vital {{role in the development of}} motor skills, tool use, and understanding causal information through social interaction. Mimicking is integral in the development of social skills and understanding nonverbal cues. Causal relationships can be made through <b>social</b> <b>learning</b> without requiring experience firsthand. In action execution, mu waves are present in both infants and adults before and after the execution of a motor task and its accompanying desynchronization. While executing a goal-oriented action, however, infants exhibit a higher degree of desynchronization than do adults. Just as with an action execution, during action observation infants’ mu waves not only show a desynchronization, but show a desynchronization greater in degree than the one evidenced in adults. This tendency for changes in degree of desynchronization, rather than actual changes in frequency, becomes the measure for mu wave development throughout adulthood, although the most changes take place during the first year of life. Understanding the mechanisms that are shared between action perception and execution in the earliest years of life has implications for language development. Learning and understanding through social interaction comes from imitating movements as well as vowel sounds. Sharing the experience of attending to an object or event with another person can be a powerful force in the development of language.|$|E
