In this work, a novel analysis methodology able to provide quantitative information on soot/carbon particle species and concentrations was tested under heavy sooting conditions. The particle composition and concentrations were retrieved by fitting theoretical calculations of structural components from major molecular and nanometric species to the experimental WAXS data. The results show that argon dilution yields predominantly graphene-like components that are less stacked and amorphous carbon that is less structured than under nitrogen dilution. This finding was later confirmed by electron microscopy analysis on samples extracted from similar flames.

40|$|Purpose The general aim of {{the present}} thesis was to {{investigate}} early bone response to titanium implants modified with nano size structures. Therefore, 1. a model to evaluate titanium implants modified with nano size structures was validated; 2. a suitable detection method of nano size structures was implemented. Materials and Methods A rabbit model was selected and healing time was 4 weeks in all experiments. A smooth cylindrical implant design was selected {{in order to control}} the macrothreads and micro-structures. Thus, early bone response could be related to added nano size structures alone. A <b>stabilization</b> <b>plate</b> was utilized to ensure adequate fixation of the attached implant. Smooth implants were obtained through polishing techniques (electrical and mechanical) and were used as control surfaces and, after relevant modifications, as experimental surfaces. Six surface modifications were investigated: 1. mechanically polished, 2. electropolished, 3. nano hydroxyapatite (HA), 4. nano titania, 5. blasted (TiO 2) and 6. fluoride-modified. The implant surface topography was measured with an interferometer and an atomic force microscope. Surface roughness parameters were calculated and nano size structures dimension and distribution were characterized. Surface morphology was evaluated by scanning electron microscopy. Surface chemical composition was monitored with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The bone response was measured with removal torque tests and histological and histomorphometrical analyses. Results The model tested to evaluate smooth implants was found adequate. Atomic force measurements combined with image processor analyses software was suitable to characterize nano size structures at the implant surface. Nano HA modified implants enhanced bone formation at 4 weeks of healing compared to electropolished implants. However, placed in a gap healing model the nano HA modified implants showed similar bone formation compared to electropolished implants. If both test and control implants were modified with nano structures, so-called bioactive nano HA and bioinert nano titania, respectively; enhanced bone response of 24 % was found to the “bioinert” nano titania implants, although not statistically significant. The beneficial effect of nano size structures on the experimental model was tested on screw shaped moderately rough implants. The oral implants that exhibited particular nano structures (fluoride and nano HA) showed a tendency of higher removal torque values compared to control (blasted) implants, that lacked such structures. Conclusions Based on in vivo animal experiments, enhanced bone formation was demonstrated to smooth and moderately rough titanium implants modified with nano size structures with different chemical composition...|$|E

Polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) bonecement has been used in cervical disc disease as a spacer, with good longterm outcomes, but the method does not result in solid bone fusion in allcases. Methods: A prospective study was performed with 92 consecutive patients who underwent single-level anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) with ahollow PMMA spacer, cancellous allograft and titanium cervical <b>plate</b> <b>stabilization</b> between January 2002 and December 2003. Patients were followedfor a minimum of 2 years. Results: The surgical procedures used were technically successful for all patients, andthere were no major complications related to anesthesia or the overall surgical procedure. The fusion rate was 89. 8 % at the 12 -month follow-up, and 100 % at the 24 -month follow-up. The mean intervertebral disc height was 6. 5 1. 5 mm and regained height was 3. 4 1. 3 mm at the 24 -month follow-up. The mean segmental lordotic angle was 3. 7 2. 0 ° with an increaseof 6. 1 2. 3 ° at the 24 -month follow-up. There was no hollow PMMA spacer dislodgment or failure.

Overview of Literature: The tear drop fracture of the lower cervical spine is generally associated with {{a high incidence of}} neurological deficits and surgery is needed to treat this injury. Tear drop fracture of C 2 is usually a stable fracture that is amendable to conservative treatment. Methods: We reviewed the outcomes of 25 patients. Cervical tear drop fracture was classified as the extension and flexion types according to the mechanism of injury. The neurologic symptoms were evaluated by the Frankel classification system, and the loss of lordosis and disc height, and the duration of bony union were analyzed. Results: Twenty one patients had the flexion type injury and 4 patients had the extension type injury. All the patients with the flexion type were treated by anterior decompression and <b>plate</b> <b>stabilization.</b> All the patients with the extension type were treated conservatively. Ten patients with the flexion type had neurologic deficits. The nerve root injuries recovered fully and the incomplete injuries had an average 1. 5 grade recovery. Radiologically, the extension type fracture showed bony union at an average of 12. 8 weeks. For the patients with the flexion type fracture, the loss of lordosis was 2. 6 �and the loss of disc height was 2. 1 mm. The period of bony union in 20 cases was 13. 0 weeks.

Le fratture diagnosticate sono state classificate in relazione alle loro caratteristiche; la nostra casistica è stata, poi, suddivisa in base al trattamento (chirurgico o conservativo), al tempo intercorso tra questo ed il trauma, ed ai mezzi d’osteosintesi impiegati.

A retrospective study (January 2000 to October 2002) of 106 patients with appendicular fractures, 76 dogs and 30 cats respectively, was performed. These 106 fractures are classified by their characteristics; 65 of the 106 patients had a surgical <b>stabilization</b> with <b>plates,</b> external fixators, pins, ecc.

40|$|Isolated non-skeletal {{injuries}} of the cervical spine {{are rare}} and frequently missed. Different evaluation algorithms for C-spine injuries, {{such as the}} Canadian C-spine Rule have been proposed, however with strong emphasis on excluding osseous lesions.

No neck pain could be elicited and the patient was not intoxicated and did not have distracting injuries. Since the patient described a fall prevention attempt with both arms, a peripheral nerve contusion was considered as a differential diagnosis. However, a high level of suspicion and the use of sophisticated imaging (MRI and CT) of the cervical spine, ultimately led to the diagnosis of a traumatic disc rupture at the C 5 / 6 level.

40|$|The {{effects of}} muscle {{activity}} on the growth of synaptic acetylcholine receptor (AChR) accumulations and on the metabolic AChR stability were investigated in rat skeletal muscle. Ectopic end plates induced surgically in adult soleus muscle were denervated early during development when junctional AChR number and stability were still low and, subsequently, muscles were either left inactive or they were kept active by chronic exogenous stimulation. AChR numbers per ectopic AChR cluster and AChR stabilities were estimated from the radioactivity and its decay with time, respectively, of end plate sites whose AChRs had been labeled with 125 I-alpha-bungarotoxin (alpha-butx). The {{results show that the}} metabolic stability of the AChRs in ectopic clusters is reversibly increased by muscle activity even when innervation is eliminated very early in development. 1 d of stimulation is sufficient to stabilize the AChRs in ectopic AChR clusters. Muscle stimulation also produced {{an increase in the number}} of AChRs at early denervated end plates. Activity-induced cluster growth occurs mainly by an increase in area rather than in AChR density, and for at least 10 d after denervation is comparable to that in normally developing ectopic end plates. The possible involvement of AChR <b>stabilization</b> in end <b>plate</b> growth is discussed...|$|R
40|$|With many {{important}} developments {{over the last}} century, nowadays orthopedic bone plate now excels over other types of internal fixators in bone fracture fixation. The developments involve the design, material and implementation techniques of the plates. This paper aims to review the evolution in implementation technique and biomaterial of the orthopedic bone plates. Plates were initially used to fix the underlying bones firmly. Accordingly, Compression plate (CP), Dynamic compression plate (DCP), Limited contact dynamic compression plate (LC-DCP) and Point contact fixator (PC-Fix) were developed. Later, the implementation approach was changed to locking, and the Less Invasive <b>Stabilization</b> System (LISS) <b>plate</b> was introduced as a result. Finally, {{a combination of both}} of these approaches has been used by introducing the Locking Compression Plate (LCP). Currently, precontoured LCPs are mainly used for bone fracture fixation. In parallel with structure and implementation techniques, numerous advances have occurred in biomaterials of the plates. Titanium and stainless steel alloys are now the most common biomaterials in production of orthopedic bone plates. However, regarding the biocompatibility, bioactivity and biodegradability characteristics of Mg alloys, Ta alloys, SMAs, carbon fiber composites and bioceramics, these materials are considered as potentially suitable for plates. However, due to poor mechanical properties, they have very limited applications. Therefore, further studies are required in future to solve these problems and make them feasible for heavy-duty bone plates...|$|R

Caused by hypertrophy of {{the yellow}} ligament, osteophytes in the medullary canal and disc herniation. It affects {{the upper and lower}} motor neurons. The treatment of myelopathy diagnosed by magnetic resonance and electromyography consists of decompression by corpectomy. Methods: Autologous graft integration with cervical plate placement was evaluated in 31 patients, from January 1, 2013 to December 31, 2015. The procedure consisted of a Smith Robinson approach, anterior corpectomy, iliac crest autograft, anterior <b>stabilization</b> with cervical <b>plate</b> (Vectra, Synthes). Statistical analysis was performed with EPIINFO 3. 5. 1. Results: Age 64. 6 % (45 - 65 years), Sex: 41. 9 % (women), 58. 1 % (men). Segments treated: 38. 7 % (C 5 -C 6), 35. 5 % (C 4 -C 5), graft separation in sections 249 min), 32. 3 % (121 - 180 min), 32. 3 % (181 - 240 min), 3. 2 % (91 - 120 min). Discussion: In this series, Querétaro is similar to other cities in the world with respect to sex, age, levels affected, number of complications, surgical time and bleeding, as well as graft integration in the evaluation at 12 months. Conclusions: Increased frequency in adult men, C 4 -C 6 affected levels; Complications: recurrent laryngeal nerve injury, bleeding greater than 500 ml...|$|R
40|$|Small {{thermoelectric}} refrigeration {{systems can}} reach temperatures under 0 &deg;C in short time periods {{and keep them}} with 0. 1 &deg;C precision, so they are indicated to freezing studies. In this work a thermoelectric prototype was used to gelatin gel fast freezing. To evaluate the effect of plate inertia on the ice crystal structure were compared the results of two test series: plate-sample set stabilization at 3. 0 &plusmn; 0. 1 &deg;C to application of 24. 5 W of electric power; <b>plate</b> <b>stabilization</b> at 24. 5 W of electric power (- 20 &plusmn; 2 &deg;C) to sample insertion. Thermograms were recorded simultaneously to temperature sensors located at four upper edges of the plate-sample interface, characterizing the freezing curves. After freezing the samples were lyophilized allowing the visualization of the ice crystals formed by optical microscopy under ambient temperature. The differences obtained between the plate extremity temperatures of the horizontal plain resulted in the ice structure, emphasizing {{the importance of the}} monitoring position specification and the sample lamination to evaluate qualitatively the ice crystals. The obtained images to five cut plains related to the sample center proved that the system inertia to reach the minimum temperature leads to an increase in the size of ice crystals when compared to the procedure started with the frozen plate. The results proved the effectiveness and precision of the device to different studies of freezing curves and subsequent effects on the ice crystals formation. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{traditional}} {{surgical treatment}} of proximal tibial me-taphyseal fracture includes internal fixation {{with a plate}} or intramedullary nailing. Open reduction and internal fixation with a plate often requires extensive soft-tissue Background: The locking plates are often used for internal fixation of closed tibial fractures. The use of a locking plate as an ex-ternal fixator is still controversial, particularly for closed fractures. The {{purpose of this study}} is to evaluate the results of external fixation using the femoral less invasive <b>stabilization</b> system (LISS) <b>plate</b> in proximal metaphyseal fractures of the tibia. Methods: We prospectively evaluated 35 patients (26 males and 9 females) with a mean age of 42 years (range, 21 to 62 years) who presented with fresh tibial proximal metaphyseal fractures. According to the AO Foundation and Orthopaedic Trauma Asso-ciation (AO/OTA) classification, the fractures were identified as type 41 -A 2 in 18 cases and type 41 -A 3 in 17 cases, including 25 closed fractures and 10 open fractures. The femoral LISS plate was used to fix these fractures, which was placed on the anterome-dial aspect of the tibia as an external fixator. The mean follow-up period was 18 months (range, 13 to 22 months). Results: All fractures healed in a mean time of 14 weeks (range, 10 to 20 weeks). There was no case of nonunion, deep infection, and loosening of screws and plates. One month after the appearance of cortical bridging on biplanar radiographs, the locking plat...|$|R
40|$|Background: Anterior {{cervical}} corpectomy and fusion with instrumentation is {{a common}} procedure for the surgical treatment of cervical spinal cord and/or nerve root decompression or for deformity correction. However, various postoperative complications {{have been associated with}} such a surgical intervention. Postoperative spondylolisthesis after an anterior cervical corpectomy with instrumentation is a serious complication that has rarely been addressed in the literature, and may potentially be underreported. Case Description: A 44 -year-old woman with degenerative disk disease, loss of cervical lordosis, congenital cervical stenosis at C 5 -C 6, and a left-sided herniated disk at C 6 -C 7 underwent an anterior cervical corpectomy of C 6 with fusion and anterior <b>plate</b> <b>stabilization</b> of C 5 -C 7. Early postoperative evaluation noted complete resolution of the patient's symptoms. At 6 months after surgery, the patient complained of neck pain and intermittent headaches. Radiographic evaluation noted fusion of the corpectomy strut graft with retrolisthesis of C 5 on C 6 and early myelomalacia at C 5 -C 6. A cervical laminectomy with posterior instrumentation from C 5 to C 7 was performed and the patient's symptoms resolved. Conclusions: Postoperatively, a high index of suspicion should be present for the development of spondylolisthesis in patients undergoing an anterior cervical corpectomy and fusion procedure with or without instrumentation, particularly in individuals with persistent or new symptoms even after a "successful" operative procedure. The spine surgeon should address appropriate operative techniques and postoperative management to decrease the risk of spondylolisthesis after such a procedure. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.
