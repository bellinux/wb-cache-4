6000|$|And Julia? And the housekeeping?--the rent, food, and clothing, which {{controversy}} {{can hardly}} supply unless it {{be of the}} kind that serves as a recommendation to certain posts. Controversial pamphlets have been known to earn large plums; but nothing of the sort could be expected from unpractical heresies about the Magicodumbras and Zuzumotzis. Painfully the contrary. Merman's reputation as a sober thinker, a safe writer, a sound lawyer, was irretrievably injured: the distractions of controversy had caused him to neglect useful editorial connections, and indeed his dwindling care for miscellaneous subjects made his contributions too dull to be desirable. Even if he could now have given a new turn to his concentration, and applied his talents so as to be ready to show himself an exceptionally qualified lawyer, he would only have been like an architect in competition, too late with his superior plans; he would not have had an opportunity of showing his qualification. He was thrown out of the course. The small capital which had filled up deficiencies of income was almost exhausted, and Julia, in the effort to make supplies equal to wants, had to use much ingenuity in diminishing the wants. The brave and affectionate woman whose <b>small</b> <b>outline,</b> so unimpressive against an illuminated background, held within it a good share of feminine heroism, did her best to keep up the charm of home and soothe her husband's excitement; parting with the best jewel among her wedding presents in order to pay rent, without ever hinting to her husband that this sad result had come of his undertaking to convince people who only laughed at him. She was a resigned little creature, and reflected that some husbands took to drinking and others to forgery: hers had only taken to the Magicodumbras and Zuzumotzis, and was not unkind--only a little more indifferent to her and the two children than she had ever expected he would be, his mind being eaten up with [...] "subjects," [...] and constantly a little angry, not with her, but with everybody else, especially those who were celebrated.|$|E
50|$|Quadracs are {{available}} {{in a variety of}} integrated circuit (IC) package types with different numbers of pins. Basic IC packages types for quadracs include discrete packaging (DPAK), power packaging (PPAK), and in-line packaging (IPAK). Other IC package types include diode outline (DO), transistor outline (TO), and <b>small</b> <b>outline</b> transistor (SOT). Quadracs that use metal electrode leadless face (MELF) packaging have metallized terminals at each end of a cylindrical body. Other available package types for quadracs include thin <b>small</b> <b>outline</b> package (TSOP), thin shrink <b>small</b> <b>outline</b> L-leaded package (TSSOP), and thin <b>small</b> <b>outline</b> J-lead (TSOJ) package.|$|E

30|$|There are {{two lines}} of {{reasoning}} on this issue.

50|$|In 1941, Brother Roger had {{published}} a few <b>small</b> brochures <b>outlining</b> several facets of a Christ-centred communal life together.

5000|$|The SOIC (<b>Small</b> <b>Outline</b> IC), a surface-mount package {{which is}} {{currently}} very popular, particularly in consumer electronics and personal computers, is essentially a shrunk version of the standard IC PDIP, the fundamental difference which makes it an SMT device being a second bend in the leads to flatten them parallel to the bottom plane of the plastic housing. The SOJ (<b>Small</b> <b>Outline</b> J-lead) and other SMT packages with [...] "SOP" [...] (for [...] "Small Outline Package") in their names can be considered further relatives of the DIP, their original ancestor.

5000|$|Some {{countries}} have exempted medical and telecommunication infrastructure {{products from the}} legislation. [...] However, {{this may be a}} moot point, since as electronic component manufacturers convert their production lines to producing only lead-free parts, conventional parts with eutectic tin-lead solder will simply not be available, even for military, aerospace and industrial users. To the extent that only solder is involved, this is at least partially mitigated by many lead-free components' compatibility with lead-containing solder processes. Leadframe-based components, such as Quad Flat Packages (QFP), <b>Small</b> <b>Outline</b> Integrated Circuits (SOIC), and <b>Small</b> <b>outline</b> packages (SOP) with gull wing leads, are generally compatible since the finish on the part leads contributes a small amount of material to the finished joint. However, components such as Ball grid arrays (BGA) which come with lead-free solder balls and leadless parts are often not compatible with lead-containing processes.|$|E

40|$|The {{fundamental}} {{objectives of}} the Jessi project AE 89 are grouped into two segments similar as in the preceding project. Based on the AE 14 results a second IC generation with advanced performance for the exploitation of integrated services has to be designed. This task is also the framework where advanced IC design tools and semiconductor technologies shall be tested for future improvements. The main topics of the project - planned for a 2 1 / 2 years duration are as follows: - architecture studies for additional data services -advanced chip-set for receivers of future DAB/DDB integrated services -integrated services transmitters. Basic requirements included in the project tasks are {{a higher degree of}} integration, the reduction of power consumption, a <b>smaller</b> <b>outline</b> and a more reasonable price. These demands require a IC design for a 0, 5 #mu#-technology or even below. Grundig contributed to all the topics as listed below: - architecture, specification and interfaces of a decoder for data services - design of high integrated concepts for DAB receivers, fixing of architecture and specification - verification by simulation and by developing and testing DAB receiver hardware - evaluation of provisions relieving the linearity requirements of transmitter amplifiers.
