50|$|Such a {{compromise}} has two implications. First, messages encrypted with the matching public key (now {{or in the}} past) {{can no longer be}} assumed to be secret. One solution to avoid this problem is to use a protocol that has perfect forward secrecy. <b>Second,</b> <b>signatures</b> made with the no-longer-trusted-to-be-actually-private key after time T can no longer be assumed to be authentic without additional information (i.e., who, where, when, etc.) about the events leading up to the digital signature. These will not always be available, and so all such digital signatures will be less than credible. A solution to reduce the impact of leaking a private key of a signature scheme is to use timestamps.|$|R

5000|$|The {{painting}} {{may have}} two signatures. The more obvious {{of the two}} reads [...] "Meer 1655", while the second appears as [...] "Meer N R o o". It is possible that this <b>second</b> <b>signature</b> originally read [...] "Meer naar Riposo", or [...] "Vermeer after Riposo": Riposo was Ficherelli's nickname. The Doerner Institute's examination of the signatures concluded that both signatures were original and composed of pigments typical of the painting. Wheelock's examination also led him to conclude that both signatures were original, and recent technical examination has demonstrated that the clearer signature {{is likely to have}} been added at, or close to, the date the painting was created. However these new investigations agreed with the earlier opinion of the conservator Jørgen Wadum that the possible <b>second</b> <b>signature</b> is too indistinct to be deciphered.|$|E
40|$|In this work, {{the fully}} cavitated or bubble regime of Laser Wakefield Acceleration was exper-imentally studied. It {{provides}} acceleration fields {{in excess of}} 100 GeV/m while also generating uniform electric field gradients. This allows {{for the production of}} high-energy electron beams with moderate energy spread and femtosecond bunch lengths. Although quasi-monoenergetic beams have been observed in experiments, it remains unproven that these beams were generated in this fully cavitated acceleration structure. In addition, these high-energy electron beams should have temporal structures on the order of tens of femtoseconds. However, current detection techniques are still limited to the measurement of features no less than ∼ 100 fs. A unique <b>second</b> harmonic radiation <b>signature</b> was first observed in this investigation, confirming the existence of the bubble regime. This second harmonic was generated by the interaction of the bubble’s high-density electron sheath with a strong laser field. The bubble size, propagation distance, and the existence of multiple bubbles was obtained through careful characterization of this <b>second</b> harmonic <b>signature.</b> The observed strong correlation between the features of the <b>second</b> harmonic <b>signature</b> and the accelerated electrons provides a guidance to optimize the performanc...|$|R
