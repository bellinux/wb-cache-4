40|$|As Public-Private Partnership (PPP) {{activity}} has increased {{as a means}} of organizing the production of major infrastructure assets and services in the economy globally, it has attracted increasing attention among scholars. However, given the relatively recent introduction <b>of</b> <b>PPP</b> schemes, there is not as yet a substantial body of academic literature on such projects. Nevertheless, a number of key questions have emerged, namely: The differences in private and public sector cost of capital, the relative efficiency of public and private sectors, and the proper distribution of risk and rewards between the two.

40|$|A {{number of}} European {{countries}} {{are turning to}} private finance for public hospitals and other healthcare infrastructure. Public-private partnerships (PPP) are intended to bind private sector efficiencies, secure appropriate risk transfer between hospital operators, infrastructure owners and other partners, and ensure optimum whole-life asset management. This paper discusses the different factors that influence significantly the outcomes <b>of</b> European <b>PPP</b> ventures, the <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> different <b>PPP</b> models, and experience so far in delivering new infrastructure and stimulating innovation and quality improvements. Finally, it draws conclusions, through recent case studies, on the factors that have a significant influence in shaping PPP models and policies. The methods used were extensive literature research and analysis, further supported by case study analysis of the Pembury Hospital, Braga Hospital, Berlin Buch Hospital and De La Ribera Hospital. The outcome of this paper draws upon the concept of "bundling" of services and concludes {{that this may be}} seen as a way of providing more appropriate risk allocation that creates incentives for efficient and effective behavior of the private sector...|$|R

Of this, $3.6 trillion is projected to be spent on health infrastructure and $68.1 trillion will be spent on non-infrastructure health spending cumulatively over the next decade. Annually, spending on health infrastructure among the OECD and BRIC nations is projected to increase to $397 billion by 2020, up from $263 billion in 2010. The larger market for health PPPs is projected to be in non-infrastructure spending, estimated to be more than $7.5 trillion annually, up from $5 trillion in 2010.|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} reasons for selecting public private partnerships (PPP) as a procurement method for infrastructure projects, is the ability to deliver the best value for money (VFM) under certain conditions. Several studies have identified and analysed the factors that contribute the value for money creation, and others have identified the most viable project success evaluation criteria. This paper aims to empirically examine the relationship between the PPP project ex-post performance and the value for money creation factors. 92 PPP experts from the UK and the UAE participated in this research via an online questionnaire. The questionnaire consisted <b>of</b> VFM factors, <b>PPP</b> performance indicators and several demographic questions. It was found, through the Pearson Correlation Coefficient and Regression analyses, that there was a significant and positive relationship between improved facilities factor to the users and time, quality, economic benefits and <b>scope</b> variation performance <b>of</b> <b>PPP</b> projects. The results of the analysis also showed clear output specification and early service delivery factors contribute only to the performance in terms of service and cost. Interestingly, the results of the analysis showed that optimisation of assets efficiency factor contributed negatively to the <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> variation of projects. The research also, through the regression analysis, showed that sector, experience and job position have no mediating role between PPP ex-post performance and VFM factors. This study confirmed the need for strict criteria in order to describe the achievement <b>of</b> success in <b>PPP</b> projects. These criteria ensure that the actual practice can be measured against the criteria which are set {{at the start of the}} project.

Thus {{in the case of}} a correctly designed PPP contract, the higher cost of capital may be the price to pay for the efficiency advantages <b>of</b> <b>PPPs.</b> We also examine the role of government activities in PPP financing (e. g. revenue guarantees, renegotiations) and their consequences.

Additionally, PPP 1 CC 2 is the sole isoform found in mammalian spermatozoa. Although PPP 1 CC 1, the other Ppp 1 cc product, is expressed in many tissues including testis, the only phenotype resulting from deletion <b>of</b> <b>Ppp</b> 1 cc gene is male infertility. To determine which of the products <b>of</b> <b>Ppp</b> 1 cc is essential for male fertility, we created two PPP 1 CC 2 transgenes, eTg-G 2 and pTg-G 2, where Ppp 1 cc 2 expression was driven by the putative endogenous promoter <b>of</b> <b>Ppp</b> 1 cc or by the testis specific human Pgk 2 promoter, respectively. Our results demonstrate that the 2. 6 -kb genomic region directly upstream <b>of</b> the <b>Ppp</b> 1 cc structural gene can drive expression <b>of</b> <b>Ppp</b> 1 cc 2, and recapitulate the wild-type tissue specificity <b>of</b> <b>PPP</b> 1 CC 2 in transgenic mice.

40|$|Purpose – This paper {{reviews the}} {{normative}} literature of performance measurement {{within the context}} <b>of</b> Public-Private Partnerships (<b>PPPs).</b> The purpose <b>of</b> {{this paper is to}} examine the effectiveness of current ex post evaluations <b>of</b> <b>PPPs</b> and identify a feasible direction to comprehensively and effectively measure the performance <b>of</b> <b>PPP</b> infrastructure projects. Design/methodology/approach – An in-depth literature review is conducted in this paper. The focus of the review is associated with the general performance measurement and performance measurements <b>of</b> <b>PPPs.</b> Findings – This paper identifies that conventional ex post evaluation is not robust enough to measure the performance <b>of</b> <b>PPP</b> projects. Based on the characteristics <b>of</b> <b>PPPs,</b> the life-cycle (process-based) evaluation under performance measurement system is a promising approach to comprehensive and effective PPP performance measurement. Practical implications – The outcomes of this paper {{can be used as a}} theoretical base for the development <b>of</b> <b>PPP</b> performance measurement framework. Originality/value – Performance measurement is essential to business success, whether it is at the organisation or project level. Limitations on public funds have encouraged more and more governments across the world to use PPPs to procure economic and social infrastructure projects. Similar to traditional procurement, ex post evaluation is being widely used in PPP projects. However, PPPs are more complicated than other traditional procurement approaches. Exploration of literature suggests that limited research has been undertaken to examine if conventional ex post evaluation is sufficient to measure the performance <b>of</b> <b>PPPs.</b> This paper will bridge this significant knowledge gap...|$|R
