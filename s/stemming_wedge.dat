Implants were removed from the eight paired cadaver specimens from our previous experiment, and oblique defects created that were restored with 15 ° metallic wedges cemented in place. We applied a varus moment and an axial load and monitored relative motion between implant and bone. Specimen-specific 3 -D finite element models were constructed from CT scans and radiographs to examine bone stress in the proximal tibia. Implants with a <b>wedge</b> but no <b>stem</b> had greater motion than the previous control with no <b>stem</b> or <b>wedge.</b> Use of a modular <b>stem</b> with a <b>wedge</b> maintained the same level of motion as the primary case, suggesting that a stem is preferable when a wedge is utilized. The computational models confirmed this conclusion with a 30 % reduction in bone stress compared to 17 % in the primary case without a wedge. The wedge carried more axial load compared to the primary implant due to its support on stiff metaphyseal bone...|$|R

40|$|We {{report the}} results of a new {{technique}} of proximal cement fixation in 41 patients having revision hip arthroplasty using the Oxford modular femoral component. This consists of two parts, a metaphised <b>wedge</b> and a <b>stem.</b> The metaphyseal <b>wedge</b> is cemented and applies the load proximally to encourage bone healing. The wedge is free to slide on an uncemented stem that gains fixation distal to areas of bone loss, with the intention of reducing the risk of fracture. The clinical and radiographic follow-up ranged from a minimum of 3 years to 7 years. There have been no re-revisions. Ninety percent of the patients had pain or slight pain. Despite a relatively high rate of early subsidence, we feel that our results are encouraging, and justify the continued use of this component in hip revision surgery...|$|R
40|$|Non-cemented femoral {{fixation}} in hip arthroplasty {{has become}} the standard of practice in the USA.

This study examines reasons for early periprosthetic femur fractures in patients with a hip arthroplasty performed using a non-cemented tapered <b>wedge</b> <b>stem</b> design. A multivariate analysis using a matched-cohort design was performed to assess any potential risk factors that may predispose to such fractures. Six of 2, 220 hips (0. 3 %) suffered a periprosthetic femur fracture within {{the first year after}} surgery; five of six were Vancouver Type B 2. The average time to fracture was 9  weeks. This group of patients had a significantly higher canal–flare index and lower canal–calcar ratio.

40|$|This {{prospective}} study describes {{the outcome of}} the first 1000 phase 3 Oxford medial unicompartmental knee replacements (UKRs) implanted using a minimally invasive surgical approach for the recommended indications by two surgeons and followed up independently. The mean follow-up was 5. 6 years (1 to 11) with 547 knees having a minimum follow-up of five years. At five years their mean Oxford knee score was 41. 3 (sd 7. 2), the mean American Knee Society Objective Score 86. 4 (sd 13. 4), mean American Knee Society Functional Score 86. 1 (sd 16. 6), mean Tegner activity score 2. 8 (sd 1. 1). For the entire cohort, the mean maximum flexion was 130 ° at the time of final review. The incidence of implant-related re-operations was 2. 9 %; of these 29 re-operations two were revisions requiring revision knee replacement components with <b>stems</b> and <b>wedges,</b> 17 were conversions to a primary total knee replacement, six were open reductions for dislocation of the bearing, three were secondary lateral UKRs and one was revision of a tibial component. The most common reason for further surgical intervention was progression of arthritis in the lateral compartment (0. 9 %), followed by dislocation of the bearing (0. 6 %) and revision for unexplained pain (0. 6 %). If all implant-related re-operations are considered failures, the ten-year survival rate was 96 % (95 % confidence interval, 92. 5 to 99. 5). If only revisions requiring revision components are considered failures the ten-year survival rate is 99. 8 % (confidence interval 99 to 100). This is the largest published series of UKRs implanted through a minimally invasive surgical approach and with ten-year survival data. The survival rates are similar to those obtained with a standard open approach whereas the function is better. This demonstrates the effectiveness and safety of a minimally invasive surgical approach for implanting the Oxford UKR...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE OF THE STUDY In the {{development}} of cementless total hip arthroplasty wear, loosening as well as stress shielding are considered as major issues. New results in literature specify survivorship of THA over 97 %. Consequently the implant loosening and wear especially {{can be considered as}} almost solved. Therefore, it is essential to use bone preserving primary implants that allow for a physiological load transfer and cause no or only slight stress shielding at the proximal femur. The MAYO conservati-ve hip <b>stem</b> with a <b>wedge</b> design ensuring immediate primary fixation of the stem with metaphyseal load transfer. MATERIAL AND METHODS A retrospective study was performed to review the first consecutive 316 MAYO ® conservative hip stems implanted at the Martin-Luther-University of Halle-Wittenberg (Germany). 85. 4 % (270 MAYO stems) were radiographic analysed and clas-sified according to the HHS. RESULTS The mean HHS improved from 44. 79 preoperatively to 93. 58 postoperatively. 1. 85 % (5 MAYO stems) had to be repla-ced because of aseptic loosening. Furthermore the DEXA scans revealed the metaphyseal load transfer with increased bone density in the calcar region. CONCLUSION As especially younger patients will require one or more hip revision procedures during the course of their life due to the-ir life due to their age and activity level. These patients should receive a primary implant with proximal load transfer. Only these implants can avoid stress shielding of the proximal femur. The minimally invasive implantation of these implants can also ensure an enhanced periprosthetic bone density an optimized postoperative rehabilitation phase.

40|$|Teak (Tectona grandis) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{valuable}} timbers in international trade and an important species for tropical forestry. Teak is found on the island of East Timor but no information is available on teak growth from this region. A pure stand planted in 1940 - 50 in the North of East Timor and left unmanaged was studied. Fifteen trees were sampled in October-November 2003 and stem discs taken at three height levels of its height (1. 7 m, 9. 5 m and 18. 7 m), and cores were collected at DBH. Transverse surfaces of the discs and cores were polished for ring identification. Core cross sections were first digitized and disc cross sections were observed under the microscope. Three randomly selected radii were analyzed in each disc. Ring width measurement and ring counting were done using image analysis software. The distinction between heartwood and sapwood was performed macroscopically by colour difference, and heartwood radius and sapwood width were measured. The relationship between stem and heartwood radius was studied for each disc and heartwood percentage by radius was determined. Radial ring width curves are presented for the different axial positions within the stem, and ring width variability was analyzed. Growth rates were calculated and age-radius relationships were estimated using cumulative growth curves. Growth rings were large and well defined in the juvenile phase, reflecting the specie’s fast-growing character. The year-to-year variation of ring width showed a similar pattern among trees.

La madera de teca (Tectona grandis L. f.) es una de las más valiosas en el comercio internacional y una especie importante para la silvicultura tropical. La teca se encuentra en la isla de Timor Leste, pero no existe información disponible sobre su crecimiento en esta región. Se estudió una plantación pura no manejada que fue establecida entre 1940 y 1950 en el Norte de Timor Leste. Entre Octubre- Noviembre 2003 se cosecharon 15 árboles y al tronco se les extrajeron discos a tres niveles de altura (1. 7 m, 9. 5 m y 18. 7 m), y se recolectaron núcleos a la altura del pecho (DAP). El conteo y la medición de los anillos se realizaron mediante el software de análisis de imagen. La distinción entre el duramen y la albura se realizó macroscópicamente por la diferencia de color, y se midieron el radio del duramen y el ancho de la albura. Para cada disco se estudió la relación entre el tallo y radio del duramen y el porcentaje del duramen. Las curvas de variación del ancho de los anillos se presentan para las diferentes posiciones axiales dentro del tronco y se analizó la variabilidad del ancho de los anillos. Las tasas de crecimiento fueron calculadas y las relaciones de radio con la edad se calcularon usando las curvas de crecimiento acumulado. Los anillos de crecimiento eran grandes y bien definidos en la fase juvenil, lo que refleja el carácter de crecimiento rápido de esta especie. La variación en la anchura de los anillos año a año mostró un patrón similar entre los árboles. La anchura media del anillo osciló entre 4. 3 - 7. 3 mm para los primeros 20 años y 3. 3 - 5. 1 mm para los de 30 a 45 años. La excentricidad de la médula fue evidente en la parte inferior del tallo y se observó la formación de anillos sobrepuestos. En promedio, el duramen representó el 84 % del radio y la albura mostró entre 6 y 11 anillos. La variación del ancho de los anillos con la edad, la presencia de excentricidad en la parte inferior del árbol y los anillos sobrepuestos pone de relieve la importancia del manejo forestal con particular atención a la distribución de densidad basal en el tiempo, cuando se pretende la producción optimizada de la madera...|$|R
40|$|Student Number: 0008522 F Master of Science Faculty of Engineering & The Built Environment School of Mechanical, Industrial & Aeronautical EngineeringAn {{aircraft}} travelling at supersonic speeds {{close to}} the ground generates a bow wave, which is reflected off the ground surface. When the aircraft enters a valley, the three-dimensional bow wave is reflected off the valley walls, such that it could focus behind the aircraft. Complex threedimensional wave surfaces will result. The real situation of an aircraft entering a valley can be modelled and tested experimentally in a shock tube. To simulate the process a planar shock wave, generated in a shock tube, is moved over several notched wedge configurations. Schlieren photographs were produced to identify the resulting complex three-dimensional wave structures and then verified by three-dimensional CFD. The valley geometries investigated are rectangular, triangular, parabolic and conical. Three hill geometries were also investigated. The three-dimensional reflected surfaces from the rectangular valleys were found to vary only slightly as the valley floor inclination is increased. As the incident wave interacts with both the wedge and valley floor surfaces two prominent reflections occur. A primary reflected wave surface is generated from regular reflection off the wedge. This surface flows over into the valley contacting the incident wave at a second contact point. A secondary reflected wave is found underneath the primary reflected wave, generated due to Mach reflection occurring over the full width off the valley floor. The area of the incident wave between the second contact point and the triple point is seen to bow out into the downstream flow. The Mach stem of the reflection off the valley floor tends to become less pronounced for the larger valley floor inclination angles. In all the rectangular valleys, a shear layer is present, cascading down the valley wall and then along the valley entrance. The shear layer tends to decrease in size as the valley floor inclination increases. Both prominent reflected shock surfaces are almost conical in nature at close proximity to the valley wall. The triangular valleys show similar reflection patterns as the rectangular valleys. As the incident shock wave initially interacts with the wedge surface only regular reflection occurs. The resulting reflected wave forms the primary reflected surface which flows over into the valley. The reflection changes to Mach reflection as the incident wave interacts with the valley floor. The Mach stem of the reflection off the valley floor increases in characteristic height as one moves from the valley entrance wall to the plane of symmetry. The Mach stem is much smaller for the higher valley floor inclinations. A secondary reflected wave is found underneath the primary reflected surface. The secondary wave is Mach reflection near the plane of symmetry which turns iii to regular reflection closer to the valley wall. The primary and secondary reflected surfaces merge near the plane of symmetry and again along the wedge surface. A shear layer is found to cascade down the valley entrance wall for all geometries, decreasing in strength as the valley inclination angle increases. The parabolic valleys show similar reflection patterns as the triangular valleys. As the incident wave interacts with both the wedge and valley surfaces two reflections occur. The reflection off the wedge surface is regular. As the incident wave flows over into the valley the initial reflection off the valley floor is regular. This regular reflection then turns into Mach reflection the closer one moves to the symmetry plane. The Mach reflection off the valley floor forms a secondary reflected wave underneath the primary reflected wave that is found to flow over into the valley. The primary reflected wave contacts the incident wave at a second contract point found above the triple point. This contact point moves closer to the triple point and eventually along the secondary reflected wave as the incident wave advances downstream. The second contact point at a single time instant is also seen to move closer to the triple point as one moves closer to the plane of symmetry. A shear layer is found cascading down the valley entrance wall. The secondary reflected wave of the Mach reflection off valley floor forms a semi-circular surface which contacts the floor just after the shear layer. The Mach reflection off the valley floor changes to regular reflection as the surface begins to climb up along the valley entrance wall. The conical valleys once again show similar reflection patterns as those found in the other valley geometries. As the incident wave interacts with both the wedge and valley surfaces two reflections occur. Regular reflection occurs off the wedge surface with the resulting primary reflected wave flowing over into the valley. This primary reflected wave contacts the incident shock at a second contact point in the valley. The reflection off the valley floor is regular {{close to the}} valley entrance wall changing to Mach reflection nearer the symmetry plane. The reflected wave from the Mach reflection forms the secondary reflected surface found beneath the primary reflected wave. The secondary reflected Mach wave changes to regular reflection as the surface nears the valley wall, with the reflection point travelling along the valley floor until coincident with the valley entrance wall, where it then travels along the entrance wall. The second contact point found on the incident wave is found above the triple point and moves down the incident shock to eventually coincide with the triple point. A weak shear layer is found to cascade down the valley entrance wall. A weak separation also occurs at the entry point of the valley. iv The three hill geometries, triangular, parabolic and conical, all display similar reflection patterns. As the incident wave advances downstream regular reflection occurs off both the wedge and hill surfaces. The reflected waves come together at a point off the surface. At this point a double triple point occurs with two resulting Mach stems. One Mach <b>stem</b> contacts the <b>wedge</b> surface while the other contacts the hill surface. The resulting double Mach stem surface wraps {{around the base of the}} hill getting progressively tighter the closer it gets to the incident wave. The only major differences between all three geometries is the shape of the resulting reflected wave off the hill surface (which tends to follow the same geometric shape as the hill) and the distance between the two triple points for the conical and parabolic hills tends to be larger than that found for the triangular hill...|$|R
