40|$|ABSTRACT - From December 2003 to November 2004 a {{research}} project on the larval settlement of bivalves {{was carried out in}} the “Campo Sperimentale”. Each sample consisted of two sets of artificial collectors, consisting each of ten “chinese caps”, ten “pegs” and four “bags”, were tied to a suitable surface long-line system and suspended at - 2 and - 10 m depth. So each sample consisted of 48 collectors. From December 2003 to November 2004 ten samples were plunged and recovered after about a month, and four after three months. The peak of settlement was in spring-summer period, mostly in August for families Mytilidae, Pectinidae and Veneridae, although some families, as Anomidae and Hiatellidae, settled mainly during the winter season. In August some species of worthless Mytilidae, as Modiolarca subpicta (Contraine, 1835) and Modiolula phaseolina (Philippi, 1844), were rather abundant (188 ind/m 2 /day on “caps” at 10 m), whereas Mytilus galloprovincialis (Lamarck, 1819) settled between April and July with lower abundance values, mainly on “pegs” and “bags” at 2 m depth. Pectinidae species, Chlamys varia (Linnaeus, 1758), Proteopecten glabra (Linnaeus, 1758) and Aequipecten opercularis (Linnaeus, 1758), present during the whole study period, were mostly abundant in summer (up to 267 ind m- 2 day- 1) and showed a higher settlement on “bags” and “chinese caps” at 10 m depth. Veneridae, mostly Paphia spp., were rather low (max 36 ind/m 2 /day on “caps” at 2 m). M. galloprovincialis and Veneridae clearly preferred the most surface collectors, whereas Pectinidae preferred the deepest ones. Moreover, in order to define a suitable <b>spat</b> <b>harvesting</b> strategy throughout the different year periods, a calendar of the settlement, which may be useful for the shellfish producers, was assessed...|$|E
40|$|This study {{identifies}} a way {{to develop}} more efficient spat collecting techniques that may compensate for the lower survival rate of the oysters caused by the B. ostreae parasite. It {{is part of the}} EU project Oysterecover aimed at investigating the causes and possible solutions to the decline in the European flat oyster (Ostrea edulis) due to the Bonamia ostreae parasite. <b>Spat</b> can be <b>harvested</b> directly from the field, or obtained by introducing substrate, also called collectors, in the water during the period that freeswimming larvae are present...|$|R
500|$|Oysters, mussels, clams, {{scallops}} {{and other}} bivalve species are grown with food materials that occur naturally in their culture {{environment in the}} sea and lagoons. One-third of the world’s farmed food fish harvested in 2010 was achieved {{without the use of}} feed, through the production of bivalves and filter-feeding carps. European flat oysters (Ostrea edulis) were first farmed by the Romans in shallow ponds and similar techniques are still in use. [...] Seed oysters are either raised in a hatchery or harvested from the wild. Hatchery production provides some control of the broodstock but remains problematic because disease-resistant strains of this oyster have not yet been developed. Wild <b>spats</b> are <b>harvested</b> either by broadcasting empty mussel shells on the seabed or by the use of long, small-mesh nets filled with mussel shells supported on steel frames. The oyster larvae preferentially settle out on the mussel shells. Juvenile oysters are then grown on in nursery trays and are transferred to open waters when they reach [...] in length.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} {{successful}} hatchery {{production of the}} winged pearl oyster, Pteria penguin, {{without the use of}} live micro-algae. Larval nutrition was provided by commercially available micro-algae concentrates, Instant Algae® (“Isochrysis 1800 ®” and “Pavlova 1800 ®”, Reed Mariculture Inc., San Jose, CA, USA). Larvae were first transferred to settlement tanks on day 17 when their mean antero-posterior measurement (APM) was 240. 2 ± 8. 6 μm. Approximately 6. 4 % of larvae survived to day 17 and more than 700, 000 eyed pediveligers were transferred to settlement tanks between day 17 and day 25. Approximately 33, 000 <b>spat</b> were <b>harvested</b> from <b>spat</b> collectors on day 105, representing a survival rate of 4. 7 % from the eyed pediveliger stage. Growth and development of larvae in this study were superior to those reported in a prior study that used a ternary live micro-algae diet to feed P. penguin larvae. Our results indicate that the products used in this study proved nutritious for P. penguin larvae and supported normal growth and development through settlement. The use of commercially available micro-algae concentrates as a replacement for live micro-algae in pearl oyster hatcheries supports development of simplified larval rearing protocols, without live micro-algae culture, that are more appropriate to Pacific island nations...|$|R
40|$|All {{previous}} {{attempts to}} produce viable tetraploid pearl oyster (Pinctada martensii Dunker) by inhibiting the first polar {{body and the}} first mitosis have failed. This study aims to test the possibility of producing viable tetraploids by the intentional process of crossing triploid females and diploid males following the inhibition of the first polar body. When 0. 5 mg/L CB was applied to inhibit {{the release of the}} first polar body, about 16. 69 % of embryos developed as tetraploids, the majority of embryos were aneuploids (65. 48 %); about 82 % embryos developed as aneuploids in the control group (TD 1), but no tetraploid embryos were found. Ploidy of embryos in the TD 1 group mainly fell between 2 n and 3 n, bur ranged from 2 n to 5 n in the TDCB group. During rearing period, larvae died heavily. At Day 51 post-fertilization, 2125 <b>spat</b> were <b>harvested,</b> averaging 0. 033 % of D-larvae cultured. Chromosome analysis revealed that 115 one-year-old pearl oysters consisted of 28. 70 % diploids (n = 33), 40. 87 % triploids (n = 47), 1. 74 % tetraploids (n = 2) and 28. 70 % aneuploids (n = 33) with 29, 30, 40, 41, and 43 chromosomes. Comparison of growth showed that aneuploids was not significantly different from diploids in both shell length and body weight (P > 0. 1), but significantly smaller than triploids (P < 0. 05). This study demonstrated that the production of viable tetraploid pearl oysters with eggs from triploids is possible, and certain levels of aneuploidy can be tolerated in this species...|$|R
40|$|In the 1998 / 99 {{season the}} scallop dredge fishery was worth an {{estimated}} $ 30. 2 million. The success of this industry relies heavily on a scallop spat enhancement programme run by the Challenger Scallop Enhancement Company. Spat collectors consisting of mesh bags, suitable for larvae settlement, are set during November or December and are harvested in March (primary <b>spat).</b> The <b>harvested</b> <b>spat</b> are dispersed into new areas where they are left to grow to a commercially harvestable size. Fall off from the primary harvesting process results in high densities of juvenile scallops on the primary harvest site, which need to be cleared. The clearing of these juvenile scallops {{is referred to as}} the secondary harvest. It is not known which length spat is the most robust and therefore most likely to survival through the primary and secondary harvesting processes or under what transport conditions during the secondary harvest survival is highest. Behavioural experiments were conducted on 9 length groups of spat collected during the 2002 primary harvest. When presented with a starfish predator, 10 mm spat had a significantly slower reaction time (8. 30 ± 0. 16 seconds) than other length groups and 17 mm length group had the fastest reaction time (2. 55 ± 0. 32 seconds). Small spat had significantly fewer adductions in their first swimming bout than large spat, (12 mm = 8. 44 ± 0. 61, 27 mm = 10. 90 ± 0. 49). Also, for the total number of adductions this pattern was repeated with small spat exhibiting fewer adductions than large spat, (10 mm = 22. 24 ± 1. 58, 27 mm = 40. 52 ± 1. 20). These results indicate that larger spat are more robust after the primary harvest process. Glycogen analysis of primary and secondary scallops showed very low quantities of glycogen « 0. 3 %) in whole scallops (wet weight). In the primary <b>harvest</b> the smaller <b>spat</b> « 17 mm) had significantly higher glycogen levels than larger spat. The secondary juvenile scallops showed no variation in the glycogen content between length groups. Two methods were used to assess stress in primary and secondary scallops (stress on stress (SOS) test and recovery test). The SOS test had no variation in survival between length classes from the primary harvest. The recovery test suggested that larger spat (> 20 mm) had a higher survival rate than small spat. The two experimental methods (SOS test and recovery test) showed opposite trends in survival with regard to length classes when used to test the same sample group of scallops during the secondary harvest, however, when all length classes were grouped together the assessment methods reported similar findings. The SOS test suggested that larger scallops are more stressed after the secondary harvest process, whereas the recovery test suggested that the smaller scallop were more stressed. Aerial exposure experiments suggested that transport of up to 8 hours was possible at temperatures 20 mm in order to seed the most robust scallop. The secondary harvest should also target larger juvenile scallops (> 30 mm) when transporting long distance (> 8 hours). Transport up to 8 hours could result in minimal mortalities when the air temperature is near current acclimation levels...|$|R
40|$|Temporal {{variation}} in abundance of larvae and spat of the pearl oyster Pinctada imbricata was studied from May 1997 to June 1998 by sampling with bongo nets and <b>harvesting</b> <b>spat</b> from collectors at monthly intervals. Abundances of predators (Cymatium Gastropoda and portunid, xanthid and majiid crabs) were also recorded. A relationship between salinity, {{particulate organic matter}} and larvae abundance was observed leading to peaks in abundance of spat on collectors some weeks later. Average catch rates of 10 spat month- 1 collector- 1, using collectors made of cheap easy accessible materials, indicate that availability of P. imbricata is sufficient to initiate and support aquaculture of this species. Growth and mortality rates of juveniles in three different culture systems at two densities (i. e. 20 % and 30 %) showed that density within the same culture system {{had no effect on}} growth, but that growth differed significantly among the three culture systems. Growth in bag systems was lower than in boxes whereas growth in suspended and bottom boxes was similar and comparable to the growth of a natural population. The suspended boxes were the easiest to handle because they do not require SCUBA diving and so these systems are recommended...|$|R
50|$|New Zealand greenshell mussel {{cultivation}} {{began in}} the 1970s and has since undergone massive expansion, with production growth of 708% from 1988 to 2000 (an average annual growth of 18%). Initial farms {{were based on the}} 700-year-old European floating raft method of mussel cultivation which was suitable at small scales; however, methods to support larger scale production were soon needed. An adaption of the Japanese longline shellfish aquaculture system led to the methods used today for commercial greenshell aquaculture and facilitated the transition to large-scale production by incorporating mechanized harvesting. This adaptation of the Japanese longline method consists of a series of large plastic buoys connected by two ropes forming a backbone which is held in place by concrete anchor blocks or steel anchors screwed into the seabed. Once the spat have been transported from the beach to mussel farms around the country, they are transferred into a stocking that holds the spat-covered seaweed material around a “dropper rope” which is suspended in the water column hanging at regular intervals off the backbone ropes. Soon after, the stocking and seaweed rots away, leaving only the rope for the mussels to attach. Subsequent loss of spat from the dropper ropes is typically high, generally over 50% and as high as 95%. This loss is partly due to the secondary settlement behaviour of mussels, whereby the spat can release their point of attachment to the growing rope and exude a mucous “parachute” to help move to an alternative settlement site using water currents. This loss of spat from mussel farms is a significant problem for the industry. A 2007 study identified two stressors that reduce the retention of mussels on the rope; desiccation and starvation (both of which are experienced on the journey from where the <b>spat</b> are <b>harvested</b> to where they are farmed). Steps to reduce these stressors on the spat during transport could potentially improve retention rates.|$|R
