5|$|Dromaeosauroides {{has been}} {{considered}} an indeterminate dromaeosaur by some scientists. Bonde responded that since the teeth {{differ from those of}} other dromaeosaurs from the Early Cretaceous (and later members of the group, including Dromaeosaurus), it should be considered valid. He also <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>these</b> scientists had provided incorrect information about the location, strata and age of the specimen, and that the circumstances of its naming were no different from those of other tooth-based taxa.|$|E
5|$|Gaudí's {{position}} {{in the history of}} architecture is that of a creative genius who, inspired by nature, developed a style of his own that attained technical perfection as well as aesthetic value, and bore the mark of his character. Gaudí's structural innovations were to an extent the result of his journey through various styles, from Doric to Baroque via Gothic, his main inspiration. It could be <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>these</b> styles culminated in his work, which reinterpreted and perfected them. Gaudí passed through the historicism and eclecticism of his generation without connecting with other architectural movements of the 20th century that, with their rationalist postulates, derived from the Bauhaus school, and represented an antithetical evolution to that initiated by Gaudí, given that it later reflected the disdain and the initial lack of comprehension of the work of the modernista architect.|$|E

Her body was cremated at Lodhi Crematorium in South Delhi.|$|E

Others reported loud engine noises described as a squeal, whine, or an overspeeding or accelerating engine during the last moments of the flight, although they <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>these</b> noises seemed to have stopped, or at least faded before the aircraft impacted with flat ground two miles short of the runway.|$|E

25|$|Author {{and pilot}} William Langewiesche {{asserted}} that insufficient credit {{was given to}} the A320's fly-by-wire design, by which the pilot uses a side-stick to make control inputs to the flight control computers. The computers then impose adjustments and limits of their own to keep the plane stable, which the pilot cannot override even in an emergency. This design allowed the pilots of Flight 1549 to concentrate on engine restart and deciding the course, without the burden of manually adjusting the glidepath to reduce the plane's rate of descent. Sullenberger <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>these</b> computer-imposed limits also prevented him from achieving the optimum landing flare for the ditching, which would have softened the impact.|$|E

25|$|Soon Luria had {{two classes}} of disciples: novices, to whom he expounded the {{elementary}} Kabbalah, and initiates, who became the repositories of his secret teachings and his formulas of invocation and conjuration.
