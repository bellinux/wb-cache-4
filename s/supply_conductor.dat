To {{increase}} the distance between electricity supply Grid feeder points they can be arranged to supply a 25-0-25 kV supply with the third wire (opposite phase) out of reach of the train's overhead collector pantograph. The 0 V point of the supply is connected to the rail while one 25 kV point is connected to the overhead contact wire. At frequent (about 10 km) intervals, an autotransformer links the contact wire to rail and to the second (antiphase) <b>supply</b> <b>conductor.</b> This system increases usable transmission distance, reduces induced interference into external equipment and reduces cost. A variant is occasionally seen where the <b>supply</b> <b>conductor</b> is at a different voltage to the contact wire with the autotransformer ratio modified to suit.|$|E

According to capacitor equation, i(t) = CdV(t)/dt, voltage drop between power line and ground results in current draw out from the capacitor to the circuit and when capacitance C is large enough, sufficient current is supplied with acceptable range of voltage drop. To reduce the effective series inductance, small and large capacitors are usually placed in parallel; many small capacitors may be adjacent to individual integrated circuits.

Because these listed appliances often have components that use either 120, or both 120 and 240 volts, there is often some current on the neutral wire. This differs from the protective grounding wire, which only carries current under fault conditions. Using the neutral conductor for grounding the equipment enclosure was considered safe since the devices were permanently wired to the supply and so the neutral was unlikely to be broken without also breaking both <b>supply</b> <b>conductors.</b> Also, the unbalanced current due to lamps and small motors in the appliances was small compared to the rating of the conductors and therefore unlikely to cause a large voltage drop in the neutral conductor.|$|R

Any exposed metal on the device connected to the circuit common was also connected to the power supply. For safety, no exposed metal could be connected to the circuit common. Service personnel working on energized equipment had to use an isolation transformer for safety, or be mindful that the chassis could be live.

Neutral is usually very near to earth potential, usually being earthed either at the distribution board or at the substation. Line (also known as phase or hot, and commonly, but technically incorrectly, as live) carries the full supply voltage relative to the neutral (and to earth). Three-pin sockets provide, in addition, a protective earth connection for exposed metal parts of an appliance. If internal insulation should fail, a short-circuit to the earthed exposed metal parts will hold them at a low potential, and should operate fuses or circuit breakers to isolate the faulty appliance from the supply. Depending on the supply system, some sockets may have two line connections, each at significant voltage to earth and without a neutral pin; for example, a split phase system may have 240V between line connections each at 120V with respect to earth ground; but a single-phase receptacle connected to a three-phase system may have, for example, 208V between contacts and only 120V between each contact and earth ground.|$|R

40|$|Objectives To commemorate {{victims of}} {{electrical}} accidents {{that occurred in}} the first decades of radiology and relate these accidents to the evolution of the X-ray apparatus. Methods Digitised newspapers, scientific journals, books and reports of legal procedures were searched for electrical accidents involving X-ray systems. Information on the his-torical systems was retrieved from the scientific literature and brochures from manufacturers. Results We found 51 fatal and 62 non-fatal but serious elec-trical accidents. Most of them occurred between 1920 and 1940 and involved transformers that provided output currents well above the threshold for the induction of ventricular fibrillation. The accidents led to recommendations and regu-lations to improve safety for operators and patients, and spurred manufacturers to technical developments that culmi-nated in fully electrically shockproof systems by 1935. Conclusions Although largely forgotten, the development of the shockproof X-ray systems we take for granted today lasted about 4 decades and was associated with considerable human suffering. The complete solution of the problem is a success story of engineering realised by contributions from all parties involved. Main messages â€¢ The development of electrically shockproof X-ray systems took about 4 decades (1895 â€“ 1935). â€¢ Between 1896 and 1920 electrical shocks from X-ray systems were common, but their consequences limited. â€¢ After 1920, transformers killed by delivering currents above the ventricular fibrillation threshold. â€¢ Inductors, static generators and high-frequency coils were generally low-current systems and safe. â€¢ We found 51 fatal and 62 serious non-fatal electrical accidents, most occurring from 1920 to 1940.

40|$|Among native Korean choral composers, Hyowon Woo {{has emerged}} as one of the most {{significant}} representatives of choral genre, both in Korea and internationally. She has created a new style of choral music that combines traditional Korean musical elements with contemporary Western compositional techniques, in a synthesis that generates new sonorities and effects. Her choral music falls into three basic categories: music employing direct quotation of Korean folk tunes or other elements, which produce typical Korean sonorities; music using Western practices, which produce modern and Western flavors; and music combining Korean traditional methods with modern Western concepts. Hyowon Wooâ€™s unique contribution to contemporary Korean choral music is ideally represented by her Gloria, which will form the basis for this study. Because traditional Korean music culture has such a strong presence and influence on her choral compositions, detailed knowledge of these elements are essential for the study and performance of her work. The combination of traditional Korean music and Western contemporary techniques lies at the core of her compositional style, and is the principal focus of this study. A detailed understanding of these stylistic elements, both Korean and Western, and how they work together to achieve the composerâ€™s purpose and vision, is vital to achieving an informed performance of this work.

40|$|A {{fusion reactor}} is {{described}} in which a moving string of mutually repelling compact toruses (alternating helicity, unidirectional Btheta) is generated by repetitive injection using a magnetized coaxial gun driven by continuous gun current with alternating poloidal field. An injected CT relaxes to a minimum magnetic energy equilibrium, moves into a compression cone, and enters a conducting cylinder where the plasma is heated to fusion-producing temperature. The CT then passes into a blanketed region where fusion energy is produced and, on emergence from the fusion region, the CT undergoes controlled expansion in an exit cone where an alternating poloidal field opens the flux surfaces to directly recover the CT magnetic energy as current which is returned to the formation gun.

The Wang NMR design is in turn different from the magnet design proposed in the original MICE tracker magnet specification [5]. The two tracker solenoids where fabricated with niobium titanium <b>conductor</b> <b>supplied</b> to LBNL by Luvata under a specification written by LBNL [6]. This report compares the as-built tracker solenoids to the original Wang NMR design [4]. The as-built solenoid coils are thicker by 5 to 8 percent than called for the original design. This means that the current center is moved outward from 0. 2 to 0. 5 percent. In both tracker magnets, the thickness of end coil 2 was increased by 2 -layers over the original design [5]. Thus, the current center for end coil 2 was moved outward by 0. 7 percent. The number of turns per layer was underestimated in the original design from 2 to 4 percent. As a result, the current in each of the five tracker solenoid coils must be increased. In turn, the two as built tracker solenoids are compared to each other. In the ways that matter, the two tracker solenoids are nearly identical to each other. The largest difference between the two magnets that matters is a 0. 05 percent change in the current in the center coil of the three coil set that forms the spectrometer solenoid. Since this is the largest variation that matters, it can be concluded that coils M 1, coils M 2, and the spectrometer solenoid can be connected in series without affecting the beam dynamics of MICE.

40|$|Ever {{since the}} {{discovery}} of DNA, there has been many pathologies identified effecting mankind. With the development in technology, there are many methods to alleviate these pathologies. One such is gene therapy or gene delivery. It {{is a process of}} introducing some foreign material into the body to correct the effected cells. In principle, it is a modern method to cure cells or a method to transfer nucleic acid into a cell to treat specific cells in the body. The process of delivering a genetic material is carried out using vectors, namely, viral vectors and non-viral vectors. In viral vectors, viruses are modified to make it efficient for delivery into the host cells. This method has high transduction rate as compared to non-viral method. Non-viral methods include chemical and physical transfection methods, which are used to deliver the gene of interest into the host cell unlike viral methods. In this study, a physical method using high voltage is used to deliver a genetic material into cells. High voltages are used to permeabilize the cell to allow the foreign material into it and to express it in the host cell. This process is termed as Electroporation. In specific, in this research, studying a process of charging a region that mimics skin and trying to localize the presence of electric fields on the surface where the strongest uptake of genetic material is found. In other words, region where the gene expression is strongest at a specific region if performed on skin is studied by localizing electric fields on the surfaces. My work is to characterize and develop where this effect takes place on the surface based on both positive and negative electric fields. A physical method is useful as it is a non-toxic way to get a DNA/protein into someoneâ€™s body without making them sick, unless if not using a virus to deliver. This is all done using high voltages up to 8 kV and the electric fields produced due to high voltages are localized, visualized and characterized with both positive and negative polarities of voltages. In this study, experiments with high voltages are performed and the spread of charges at specific regions are collected using a needle. This needle goes into corona, which may be called as a secondary corona. It might be called a secondary corona because the flat conductor is being charged by a metal finger but not directly by the power <b>supply.</b> Here, the <b>conductor</b> is charged by a metal finger of high input voltage, which ionizes the air molecules above the flat conductor to form a conductive region. As the input voltage is increased further, electrons escape from the needle to air or from molecules to needle forming negative or positive ions respectively. The outputs at needle were measured on the oscilloscope. In this study, repeated sets of experiments are carried out to collect consistent and reliable data. Visualizing/characterizing these fields are important as maximum delivery takes place at high voltage regions, with a condition that permeability of the cells should be known for proper transfection to occur, otherwise cells would die due to high voltages or no transfection takes place due to poor permeability of cell membrane...|$|R
40|$|The {{modern society}} uses {{more and more}} {{electronic}} devices needed {{to being able to}} function together. This put higher demands on the electrical grid together with that the typical load have changed from the past. Therefore utility companies are obliged to keep the voltage within certain limits for this to function. What exact these limits have been have not always been clear since they have not been gathered in one single document. Â  This thesis is a cooperation with Kraftringen who also has been the initiator. Kraftringen would like to become more proactive in their work regarding electric power quality. For becoming more proactive continuously measurements have to be done but the locations have to be carefully selected in the beginning to get a wider perspective of the grid. Energy markets inspectorate (EI) is supervisory of the electric power quality in Sweden and since 2011 they have published a code of statutes (EIFS 2011 : 2 later 2013 : 1) intended to summarize limits on voltage. Some of the electrical power quality aspects are not mentioned in EIFS 2013 : 1 and standards have to be used to find limited values. Flicker and interharmonics are not mentioned in EIFS 2013 : 1 and for values on flicker the standard SS-EN 50160 has to be used and for interharmonics the standard SS-EN 61000 - 2 - 2 state limit values. Besides all this there are standards with stricter limits than EIFS 2013 : 1 e. g. for total harmonic distortion on voltage were SS-EN 61000 - 2 - 2 suggest 6 % instead of 8 %. Three different field studies have been conducted in order to get some perception of the present situation regarding electric power quality. Two measurements were conducted on a typical office building because they represents {{a large part of the}} typical load in Lund. The third measurement was conducted on a substation in a rural area to get a perception of the situation outside urban areas. Â  These measurements shown that the overall electric power quality was within given limits according to EIFS 2013 : 1 and different standards. However, conducted measurements shown some interesting results. Both the typical office buildings have a slightly capacitive power factor which results in that the voltage inside the building is going to be slightly higher than at the substation. Since the voltage level at the measured urban substation was above nominal voltage level with about 2 - 5 % this could be problematic. Another eventual problem with a load with a capacitive power factor is resonance with the inductive parts of the grid like transformers leading to magnified harmonic levels. It is suggested that Kraftringen expand their number of permanent electric power quality measurement locations to get a better overview of the present situation. The best suited locations to start with are such that have received complaints earlier, preferably measured on the low voltage side of the transformer for also register the amount of zero sequence harmonics. Next step in the measurement expansion would be substations known to be under higher load than others or substations with a PEN-conductor in a smaller area than the phase <b>conductors,</b> <b>supplying</b> a typical office load with high amounts of third harmonics and unbalance. From this it would be appropriate to spread out the measurement locations geographically to better get to know the grids behaviour. ...|$|R
