50|$|The rank {{insignia}} {{was rather}} different from modern Finnish insignia. In principle, the enlisted {{did not have}} a rank system, and there was only one officer rank (suojeluskuntaupseeri), marked by a <b>single</b> metal <b>spruce</b> branch worn on the collar. However, task-specific insignia was used instead. Underofficers wore a chevron pointed downwards, and chiefs of local chapters wore 1-4 horizontal bars, the number {{depending on the size of}} the chapter. It must be kept in mind that Suojeluskunnat were a civilian organization and many members did not have formal military training. Those members who had served in the military held a separate rank in reserve.|$|R
50|$|Evidence of a budworm {{attack in}} the Lake Nipigon region of Ontario contemporaneously with the 1704 {{outbreak}} in Quebec’s Laurentide Park was adduced by Turner (1952), based on the pattern of radial growth in a <b>single</b> 300-year-old white <b>spruce</b> that showed a characteristic budworm suppression pattern beginning in 1702 and lasting for 10 years (Blais 1962).

50|$|A kronkåsa is a {{drinking}} vessel where the handles are exaggeratedly long and elaborate, thus forming {{a kind of}} crown above the cup, hence the name. The crown cups made during the Renaissance were carved from a <b>single</b> root of <b>spruce</b> trees. Later copies from the 19th century were made using other types of wood. The decoration of the crown is likely derived from forms found in the woodwork details of imported late Gothic altarpieces. Many of the cups were painted brightly red.|$|R

The wing was built around a <b>single</b> <b>spruce</b> and plywood spar and entirely ply skinned. High aspect ratio ailerons filled over half the trailing edges, with ground-adjustable trimming flaps near the roots.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Oxidation of cellulose, {{caused by}} metal-catalyzed {{hydrogen}} peroxide decomposi-tion, {{is one of}} the main potential reactions that can occur during the alkaline peroxide bleach-ing of pulp. This oxidation decreases the individual fiber strength and thus the sheet strength. The bleaching reaction should be controlled to limit cellulose degradation. The goal of this project was to characterize the fiber surface metal distribution using time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) on laboratory-generated hydrogen peroxide-bleached pulps. For this study, a <b>single</b> black <b>spruce</b> was chosen and kraft pulped. Peroxide bleaching was conducted via benchtop polyethylene bag bleaching in a temperature-controlled water-bath. The overall metals content was determined using inductively coupled plasma (ICP), whereas the surface metals were determined with TOF-SIMS. Many fundamental approach-es to study metal identity and content in fibers have been undertaken, including ICP, electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis (ESCA), X-ray fluorescence, and UV–vis. None of these methods can provide the localized density distribution and metal-mapping ability that is available through TOF-SIMS. It has spectacular imaging capabilities that were exploited for evaluating metals on the fiber sheets used in this work. The samples were subjected to other sheet and fiber testing. Tests conducted on select samples included brightness and viscosity. Factors in this experiment included metal addi-tion, chelation, and peroxide charge...|$|R
5000|$|The first ad hoc symbols were a white armband and a small, three-branched {{shoot from}} a spruce branch, placed into the hat. The basic {{insignia}} was an embroidered badge {{with a white}} [...] "S" [...] topped by three <b>single</b> shoots of <b>spruce</b> branches. The badge and the [...] "S" [...] were embroidered with a gold-colored border. The symbol worn by General C.G.E. Mannerheim had a blue field, but in the provinces, the field was divided (party per sinister), {{with two or three}} colors representing each province. The white armband also bore the name of the municipality. Each chapter had its own flag, but generally it was a symmetric variant of the modern State Flag of Finland where the cross was extended with small swastika arms, the [...] "S" [...] symbol in the canton and local symbols instead of the coat of arms.|$|R
40|$|An {{aim of this}} {{bachelor}} thesis was {{a setting}} of part earlywood and latewood, a width of tree-ring and a basic density of a norway spruce wood depending on a trunk height. For those purposes were on Drahany highlands <b>singled</b> out four-levels <b>spruces,</b> that grew in an altitude from 600 to 660 m. a. s. From these spruces was cut out ten wheels along the trunk height. Dendrochronological analyse was performed according to a standard dendrochronological methodology. Measurement of tree-rings width and earlywood and latewood was made in a programm Past 4 and WinDendro. A calculation of a maximum amount for the basic density calculation was made according to Olsen's methodology. It was found out that with increasing age of a tree comes slightly reduction of the tree-ring width. Furthermore it was found out that with increasing trunk height rises the tree-ring width and with increasing tree-ring width rises part of earlywood and latewood, while the earlywood width stays the same. Percentage latewood agency in the tree-ring was at about 7, 4 to 96, 2 %...|$|R

25|$|Fraser {{recorded}} {{the development of}} a <b>single</b> white <b>spruce</b> tree from 1926 to 1961. Apical growth of the stem was slow from 1926 through 1936 when the tree was competing with herbs and shrubs and probably shaded by larger trees. Lateral branches began to show reduced growth and some were no longer in evidence on the 36-year-old tree. Apical growth totalling about 340 m, 370 m, 420 m, 450 m, 500 m, 600 m, and 600 m was made by the tree in the years 1955 through 1961, respectively. The total number of needles of all ages present on the 36-year-old tree in 1961 was 5.25 million weighing 14.25kg. In 1961, needles as old as 13 years remained on the tree.The ash weight of needles increased progressively with age from about 4% in first-year needles in 1961 to about 8% in needles 10 years old. In discussing the data obtained from the one 11 m tall white spruce, Fraser et al. (1964) speculated that if the photosynthate used in making apical growth in 1961 was manufactured the previous year, then the 4 million needles that were produced up to 1960 manufactured food for about 600,000mm of apical growth or 730 g dry weight, over 12 million mm3 of wood for the 1961 annual ring, plus 1 million new needles, in addition to new tissue in branches, bark, and roots in 1960. Added to this would be the photosynthate to produce energy to sustain respiration over this period, an mount estimated to be about 10% of the total annual photosynthate production of a young healthy tree. On this basis, one needle produced food for about 0.19mg dry weight of apical growth, 3mm3 wood, one-quarter of a new needle, plus an unknown amount of branch wood, bark and roots.|$|R
40|$|<b>Single</b> fibres of <b>spruce</b> (Picea abies [L. ] Karst.) were {{isolated}} both chemically and mechanically from a solid wood sample. Mechanical isolation {{was carried out}} using very fine tweezers to peel out fibres, thereby {{taking advantage of the}} low shear strength between them. Chemical isolation was achieved using hydrogen peroxide and glacial acetic acid. Fibres were examined with Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) microscopy, and field-emission environmental scanning electron microscopy (FE-ESEM) in low-Vacuum mode to compare the isolation techniques with respect to their influence on cell wall structure and polymer assembly. The chemical treatment led to degradation of lignin and hemicelluloses, significantly influencing the cell wall assembly and structure. The cell wall polymers of mechanically isolated fibres remained in their natural constitution. As expected, the peeling process caused separation of cell wall layers. Our examinations indicate that delamination predominately took place at the interface between the secondary cell wall and the compound middle lamella. However, fracture between the S 1 and S 2 layers was examined as well. With respect to fibre quality, it was of particular importance that transverse crack propagation in the secondary cell walls (S 2) was not observe...|$|R
40|$|Radioactively {{labelled}} glutathione (35 S-GSH) was fed to a <b>single</b> 1 -year-old <b>spruce</b> needle on a twig girdled apical to {{the application}} site. Uptake and translocation of the radiotracer were investigated after 3 h incubation in the light. Experiments were performed with 4 - 5 -year-old trees in July and October. In both sets of experiments 3 - 16 per cent of the applied radioactivity was {{taken up by the}} needle and resulted in 54 - 77 per cent export to the preferential sinks, i. e. the current year's sprouts. Apparently, the girdle imposed apical {{to the application}} site did not hinder long distance transport. A radial transfer of 35 S from the bark to the xylem tissue basal to the girdle and a redistribution from the xylem to the bark apical to the girdle was observed. This observation indicates that GSH can readily be exchanged between phloem and xylem in both directions. Basipetal transport of 35 S towards the stem was higher in October, but never exceeded 7 per cent of total uptake (13 per cent of total export) of 35 S-GSH. Preferential incorporation of the 35 S into protein was observed in July, whereas the main portion of the radiolabel remained in the acid soluble fractions of needles, bark and wood in October...|$|R
40|$|The rising {{price of}} {{petroleum}} and environmental concerns regarding CO 2 emissions has {{increased interest in}} alternative renewable resources. Biomass {{can be considered as}} an excellent alternative raw material. A biorefinery uses biomass and produces fuel, energy and value-added chemicals. The biorefinery is an emerging field and requires much development to compete with already established petroleum-based industries. One of the greatest challenges to the biorefinery is that the raw material; biomass, has a complex chemical composition and physical structure. A pretreatment process is necessary to induce physico-chemical changes in the biomass and transform it into easily digestible material. The main factor limiting enzymatic digestion of biomass is accessibility to chemical constituents. Steam Explosion (SE) pretreatment is a promising process that has many potential benefits compared to the alternatives, e. g. it has less hazardous process chemicals and conditions, less environmental impact, fewer energy requirements and lower capital investment. Existing literature on the SE process mainly concerns products obtained after the process. Knowledge about the physical processes that take place during the SE pretreatment is limited. This licentiate thesis is based on experimental and modelling studies performed with the aim of gaining knowledge of the basic mechanisms of this process. The SE is a three-step process that involves; (i) treatment of wood with pressurized steam for a specific period of time, (ii) explosion of wood chips through the rapid release of pressure, and (iii) impact of softened wood chips with other chips and vessel walls. In the experimental part these steps have been carefully isolated and the effects of these steps on internal and external structures of <b>single</b> <b>spruce</b> wood pieces have been studied. The effect of vapour expansion and the creation of stresses during the explosion step on a single cell of spruce wood (with four layers; P, S 1, S 2 and S 3) at high temperature and moisture content have been modelled using the Finite Element Method. The study reveals that all the steps of the SE process contribute to structural changes in the wood material and increase pore size which increases the accessibility of chemical reagents and enzymes. A wood piece disintegrates into smaller pieces during the impact step. The vapour expansion inside cells during the explosion step causes each cell to expand in all directions and creates high stress and strain fields perpendicular to the cell direction. In general, cell wall damage is more likely to occur in cells with thin walls, i. e. earlywood; damaged P, S 1 and S 3 layers; low MFAs; irregular cross-sections and sharp corners...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Members of {{the pine}} family (Pinaceae), {{especially}} species of spruce (Picea spp.) and pine (Pinus spp.), dominate many of the world's temperate and boreal forests. These conifer forests are of critical importance for global ecosystem stability and biodiversity. They also provide {{the majority of the}} world's wood and fiber supply and serve as a renewable resource for other industrial biomaterials. In contrast to angiosperms, functional and comparative genomics research on conifers, or other gymnosperms, is limited by the lack of a relevant reference genome sequence. Sequence-finished full-length (FL) cDNAs and large collections of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) are essential for gene discovery, functional genomics, and for future efforts of conifer genome annotation. Results As part of a conifer genomics program to characterize defense against insects and adaptation to local environments, and to discover genes for the production of biomaterials, we developed 20 standard, normalized or full-length enriched cDNA libraries from Sitka spruce (P. sitchensis), white spruce (P. glauca), and interior spruce (P. glauca-engelmannii complex). We sequenced and analyzed 206, 875 3 '- or 5 '-end ESTs from these libraries, and developed a resource of 6, 464 high-quality sequence-finished FLcDNAs from Sitka spruce. Clustering and assembly of 147, 146 3 '-end ESTs resulted in 19, 941 contigs and 26, 804 singletons, representing 46, 745 putative unique transcripts (PUTs). The 6, 464 FLcDNAs were all obtained from a <b>single</b> Sitka <b>spruce</b> genotype and represent 5, 718 PUTs. Conclusion This paper provides detailed annotation and quality assessment of a large EST and FLcDNA resource for spruce. The 6, 464 Sitka spruce FLcDNAs represent the third largest sequence-verified FLcDNA resource for any plant species, behind only rice (Oryza sativa) and Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), and the only substantial FLcDNA resource for a gymnosperm. Our emphasis on capturing FLcDNAs and ESTs from cDNA libraries representing herbivore-, wound- or elicitor-treated induced spruce tissues, along with incorporating normalization to capture rare transcripts, resulted in a rich resource for functional genomics and proteomics studies. Sequence comparisons against five plant genomes and the non-redundant GenBank protein database revealed that a substantial number of spruce transcripts have no obvious similarity to known angiosperm gene sequences. Opportunities for future applications of the sequence and clone resources for comparative and functional genomics are discussed. </p...|$|R
40|$|Studies of spatial-temporal {{variability}} {{of the upper}} boundary of the forest on the north-western coast of Lake Baikal (Baikal and Upper Angara Ridges) are performed {{on the base of}} the analysis of forests renewal processes and of the dynamics of larch radial increment in the ecotone of the forest upper boundary and out of it. The presence of a large amount of well-developed uplands and circuses with considerable heights drops in the structure of mountain system favours formation of interrupted boundary between forest and subgoltsy belt. The timber stand of the upper forest boundary in the studied area is represented by Daurian larch. Three tree-ring chronologies of larch are obtained. The longest chronology is obtained for mountain taiga belt of Baikal Ridge and is as long as 460 years. Since 1980 ies, a sustainable trend of increase of radial trees growth is observed. It is observed the most distinctly in trees of the upper forest boundary on the Baikal Ridge. There is advancing of trees species into subgoltsy belt and into mountain tundra, which depends, respectively, on slopes heights, exposition and tilting, on sites of growth of concrete cenoses. Modern peculiarity of the vegetation of the studied area is presence of abundant viable larch undergrowth (from 2 – 3 to 25 y. o.) and fir in the ecotone of upper forest boundary and in subgoltsy belt, as well as appearing of <b>single</b> specimens of <b>spruce.</b> Main undergrowth mass (2 / 3) is presented by trees aged in average 15 – 25 y. o., i. e., they appeared in late 1980 ies.
