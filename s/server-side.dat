5|$|Originally {{designed}} to create dynamic web pages, PHP now focuses mainly on <b>server-side</b> scripting, and it is similar to other <b>server-side</b> scripting languages that provide dynamic content from a web server to a client, such as Microsoft's Classic ASP, Sun Microsystems' JavaServer Pages, and mod_perl. PHP has also attracted the development of many software frameworks that provide building blocks and a design structure to promote rapid application development (RAD). Some of these include PRADO, CakePHP, Symfony, CodeIgniter, Laravel, Yii Framework, Phalcon and Zend Framework, offering features similar to other web frameworks.|$|E
5|$|SQL defines {{aggregate}} {{functions to}} simplify <b>server-side</b> aggregate calculations on data. Except for the COUNT(*) function, all aggregate functions perform a Null-elimination step, so that Nulls {{are not included}} in the final result of the calculation.|$|E
5|$|Professional {{software}} developers {{are responsible for}} most of Folding@home's code, both for the client and <b>server-side.</b> The development team includes programmers from Nvidia, ATI, Sony, and Cauldron Development. Clients can be downloaded only from the official Folding@home website or its commercial partners, and will only interact with Folding@home computer files. They will upload and download data with Stanford's Folding@home data servers (over port8080, with 80 as an alternate), and the communication is verified using 2048-bit digital signatures. While the client's graphical user interface (GUI) is open-source, the client is proprietary software citing security and scientific integrity as the reasons.|$|E
5|$|In the United Kingdom, {{access to}} illegal content (such as child pornography) was {{strictly}} self-regulated by individual internet service providers. This began when BT Group introduced Cleanfeed, a <b>server-side</b> filtering system which uses {{data obtained from}} the Internet Watch Foundation. The IWF is a Quango organisation that operates a website where users can report web pages containing illegal or dubious content {{to be added to}} their blacklists. This was implemented in order to prevent users from accessing this material, since it is illegal to possess an indecent image of a child under the age of 18 per the Protection of Children Act. British ISPs were later obligated by the government to implement filters for illegal content by the beginning of 2007.|$|E
5|$|PHP is a {{general-purpose}} {{scripting language}} that is especially suited to <b>server-side</b> web development, in which case PHP generally runs on a web server. Any PHP code in a requested file is executed by the PHP runtime, usually to create dynamic web page content or dynamic images used on websites or elsewhere. It {{can also be used}} for command-line scripting and client-side graphical user interface (GUI) applications. PHP can be deployed on most web servers, many operating systems and platforms, and can be used with many relational database management systems (RDBMS). Most web hosting providers support PHP for use by their clients. It is available free of charge, and the PHP Group provides the complete source code for users to build, customize and extend for their own use.|$|E
5|$|Xbox One {{games are}} {{distributed}} at retail on Blu-ray Disc, and digitally as downloads through Xbox Games Store. All Xbox One games must be installed to the console's storage: users {{can begin to}} play portions of a game (such as opening levels) once the installation or download reaches a specific point, while {{the remainder of the}} game is downloaded or installed in the background. Updates to games and system software are also downloaded in the background and while in standby. If the game is installed from physical media, the disc is still required for validation purposes. If the game is installed on another console, and that console owner no longer has access to the disc, the owner has the option of unlocking the install on their hard drive by purchasing it through Xbox Live; the installed game then acts as a game installed on the hard drive. An active internet connection may be required for some games, particularly those that rely on <b>server-side</b> processing..|$|E
25|$|Since the mid-2000s, {{additional}} <b>server-side</b> JavaScript implementations {{have been}} introduced, such as Node.js in 2009.|$|E
25|$|Underscore.js is {{a utility}} JavaScript library for data {{manipulation}} {{that is used}} in both client-side and <b>server-side</b> network applications.|$|E
25|$|Auto-redirects via markup (versus <b>server-side</b> redirects) {{are not in}} {{compliance}} with the W3C's - Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 1.0 (guideline 7.5).|$|E
25|$|In December 1995, {{soon after}} {{releasing}} JavaScript for browsers, Netscape introduced an {{implementation of the}} language for <b>server-side</b> scripting with Netscape Enterprise Server.|$|E
25|$|Forms {{are usually}} {{combined}} with programs written in various programming language to allow developers to create dynamic web sites. The most popular languages include both client-side and/or <b>server-side</b> languages.|$|E
25|$|ASP.NET is an {{open-source}} <b>server-side</b> {{web application}} framework designed for web development to produce dynamic web pages. It {{was developed by}} Microsoft to allow programmers to build dynamic web sites, web applications and web services.|$|E
25|$|XSLT is {{designed}} for declarative description of XML document transformations, and has been widely implemented both in <b>server-side</b> packages and Web browsers. XQuery overlaps XSLT in its functionality, but {{is designed}} more for searching of large XML databases.|$|E
25|$|The {{most popular}} and {{effective}} strategy to counter piracy {{is to change the}} business model to Freemium, where gamers pay for their in-game needs or service. Strong <b>server-side</b> security is required for this, to properly distinguish authentic transactions from hacked (faked) transactions.|$|E
25|$|There is no single, {{standardized}} {{classification of}} cross-site scripting flaws, but most experts distinguish between {{at least two}} primary flavors of XSS flaws: non-persistent and persistent. Some sources further divide these two groups into traditional (caused by <b>server-side</b> code flaws) and DOM-based (in client-side code).|$|E
25|$|As Google Maps is coded {{almost entirely}} in JavaScript and XML, some end users have reverse-engineered the tool and {{produced}} client-side scripts and <b>server-side</b> hooks which allowed a user or website to introduce expanded or customized features into the Google Maps interface.|$|E
25|$|Many <b>server-side</b> {{template}} {{systems have}} the option to publish the output pages on the server, where the published pages will be static. It is a common feature on content management systems, like Vignette. But this {{does not have to be}} considered an out-server generation.|$|E
25|$|While {{client-side}} languages used {{in conjunction}} with forms are limited, they often can serve to do pre-validation of the form data and/or to prepare the form data to send to a <b>server-side</b> program. This usage is being replaced, however, by HTML5's new input field types and required attribute.|$|E
25|$|Team Foundation Server: Team Foundation Server is {{intended}} for collaborative software development projects and acts as the <b>server-side</b> backend providing source control, data collection, reporting, and project-tracking functionality. It also includes the Team Explorer, the client tool for TFS services, which is integrated inside Visual Studio Team System.|$|E
25|$|Web-based file {{managers}} are typically scripts written in either PHP, Ajax, Perl, ASP or another <b>server-side</b> language. When installed {{on a local}} server or on a remote server, they allow files and directories located there to be managed and edited, using a web browser, {{without the need for}} FTP Access.|$|E
25|$|Initially only {{implemented}} client-side in web browsers, JavaScript {{engines are}} now embedded {{in many other}} types of host software, including <b>server-side</b> in web servers and databases, and in non-web programs such as word processors and PDF software, and in runtime environments that make JavaScript available for writing mobile and desktop applications, including desktop widgets.|$|E
25|$|The non-persistent (or reflected) cross-site {{scripting}} vulnerability {{is by far}} {{the most}} basic type of web vulnerability. These holes show up when the data provided by a web client, most commonly in HTTP query parameters (e.g. HTML form submission), is used immediately by <b>server-side</b> scripts to parse and display a page of results for and to that user, without properly sanitizing the request.|$|E
25|$|Websites {{often include}} code to detect browser version {{to adjust the}} page design sent {{according}} to the user agent string received. This may mean that less-popular browsers are not sent complex content (even though {{they might be able}} to deal with it correctly) or, in extreme cases, refused all content. Thus, various browsers have a feature to cloak or spoof their identification to force certain <b>server-side</b> content.|$|E
25|$|A grid view, however, can be mimicked {{by using}} a {{standard}} HTML table with each cell containing a text input element. A tree view could also be mimicked through nested tables or, more semantically appropriately, nested lists. In both cases, a <b>server-side</b> process is responsible for processing the information, while JavaScript handles the user-interaction. Implementations of these interface elements are available through JavaScript libraries such as jQuery.|$|E
25|$|Office 2007 {{includes}} {{new applications}} and <b>server-side</b> tools, including Microsoft Office Groove, a collaboration and communication suite for smaller businesses, which was originally developed by Groove Networks before being acquired by Microsoft in 2005. Also included is Office SharePoint Server 2007, a major revision to the server platform for Office applications, which supports Excel Services, a client-server architecture for supporting Excel workbooks that are shared {{in real time}} between multiple machines, and are also viewable and editable through a web page.|$|E
25|$|A unique {{feature of}} the library is its {{abstraction}} layer of the browser rendering model. The library uses Ajax for communicating with Ajax-capable browsers, while using plain HTML form post-backs for other user agents (for accessibility and search engines). Using a progressive bootstrap method, the user interface is initially rendered as plain HTML, and for Ajax-capable browsers, it is automatically upgraded to use Ajax for increased interactivity. In this way, {{it is the only}} <b>server-side</b> framework that implements progressive enhancement automatically, and the only Ajax framework with search engine optimization (SEO) qualities.|$|E
25|$|The {{number of}} {{possible}} URLs crawled being generated by <b>server-side</b> software has also {{made it difficult for}} web crawlers to avoid retrieving duplicate content. Endless combinations of HTTP GET (URL-based) parameters exist, of which only a small selection will actually return unique content. For example, a simple online photo gallery may offer three options to users, as specified through HTTP GET parameters in the URL. If there exist four ways to sort images, three choices of thumbnail size, two file formats, and an option to disable user-provided content, then the same set of content can be accessed with 48 different URLs, all of which may be linked on the site. This mathematical combination creates a problem for crawlers, as they must sort through endless combinations of relatively minor scripted changes in order to retrieve unique content.|$|E
25|$|The most {{significant}} problem with blocking all scripts on all websites by default is substantial reduction in functionality and responsiveness (client-side scripting {{can be much}} faster than <b>server-side</b> scripting {{because it does not}} need to connect to a remote server and the page or frame {{does not need to be}} reloaded). Another problem with script blocking is that many users do not understand it, and do not know how to properly secure their browsers. Yet another drawback is that many sites do not work without client-side scripting, forcing users to disable protection for that site and opening their systems to vulnerabilities. The Firefox NoScript extension enables users to allow scripts selectively from a given page while disallowing others on the same page. For example, scripts from example.com could be allowed, while scripts from advertisingagency.com that are attempting to run on the same page could be disallowed.|$|E
25|$|The BlackBerry PIN (Personal Identification Number) is an eight-character {{hexadecimal}} {{identification number}} {{assigned to each}} BlackBerry device. PINs cannot be changed manually on the device (though BlackBerry technicians are able to reset or update a PIN <b>server-side),</b> and are locked to each specific BlackBerry. BlackBerry devices can message each other using the PIN directly or by using the BlackBerry Messenger application. BlackBerry PINs are tracked by BlackBerry Enterprise Servers and the BlackBerry Internet Service and are used to direct messages to a BlackBerry device. Emails and any other messages, such as those from the BlackBerry Push Service, are typically directed to a BlackBerry device's PIN. The message can then be routed by a RIM Network Operations Center, and sent to a carrier, which will deliver the message the last mile to the device. In September 2012 RIM announced that the BlackBerry PIN would be replaced by users' BlackBerry ID starting in 2013 with {{the launch of the}} BlackBerry 10 platform.|$|E
25|$|A {{controller}} is a <b>server-side</b> {{component of}} Rails that responds to external requests from the web server to the application, by determining which view file to render. The controller {{may also have}} to query one or more models for information and pass these on to the view. For example, in an airline reservation system, a controller implementing a flight-search function would need to query a model representing individual flights to find flights matching the search, and might also need to query models representing airports and airlines to find related secondary data. The controller might then pass some subset of the flight data to the corresponding view, which would contain a mixture of static HTML and logic that use the flight data to create an HTML document containing a table with one row per flight. A controller may provide one or more actions. In Ruby on Rails, an action is typically a basic unit that describes {{how to respond to}} a specific external web-browser request. Also, note that the controller/action will be accessible for external web requests only if a corresponding route is mapped to it. Rails encourages developers to use RESTful routes, which include actions such as create, new, edit, update, destroy, show, and index. These mappings of incoming requests/routes to controller actions can be easily set up in the routes.rb configuration file.|$|E
25|$|As {{a widely}} {{available}} plugin independent of W3C standards (the World Wide Web Consortium is the governing body of Web standards and protocols), Adobe Flash {{is capable of}} doing many things that were not possible pre-HTML5. Of Flash's many capabilities, {{the most commonly used}} is its ability to integrate streaming multimedia into HTML pages. With the introduction of HTML5 in 2010 and growing concerns with Flash's security, the role of Flash is decreasing. In addition to Flash and Ajax, JavaScript/Ajax frameworks have recently become a very popular means of creating Web 2.0 sites. At their core, these frameworks use the same technology as JavaScript, Ajax, and the DOM. However, frameworks smooth over inconsistencies between Web browsers and extend the functionality available to developers. Many of them also come with customizable, prefabricated 'widgets' that accomplish such common tasks as picking a date from a calendar, displaying a data chart, or making a tabbed panel. On the <b>server-side,</b> Web 2.0 uses many of the same technologies as Web 1.0. Languages such as Perl, PHP, Python, Ruby, as well as Enterprise Java (J2EE) and Microsoft.NET Framework, are used by developers to output data dynamically using information from files and databases. This allows websites and web services to share machine readable formats such as XML (Atom, RSS, etc.) and JSON. When data is available in one of these formats, another website can use it to integrate a portion of that site's functionality.|$|E
500|$|TLS {{support is}} {{extended}} to support , [...] "Transport Layer Security (TLS) Session Resumption without <b>Server-Side</b> State", which improves performance of long-running TLS-secured connections {{that need to}} reconnect due to session expiration.|$|E
500|$|... {{to close}} PHP sections. The {{shortened}} form ', in XHTML and other XML documents, creates correctly formed XML processing instructions. This {{means that the}} resulting mixture of PHP code and other markup in the <b>server-side</b> file is itself well-formed XML.|$|E
500|$|PHP is a <b>server-side</b> {{scripting}} language designed primarily for web development but also {{used as a}} general-purpose programming language. Originally created by Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994, the PHP reference implementation is now produced by The PHP Development Team. PHP originally stood for Personal Home Page, but it now stands for the [...] recursive acronym PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor.|$|E
500|$|... over 20 million Internet domains had web {{services}} hosted on servers with PHP installed and mod_php was recorded {{as the most}} popular Apache HTTP Server module. , PHP {{was used as the}} <b>server-side</b> programming language on 83% of 10 million most popular websites. Web content management systems written in PHP include MediaWiki, Joomla, eZ Publish, eZ Platform, SilverStripe, WordPress, Drupal, and Moodle. Websites written in PHP, in back-end and/or user-facing portion, include Facebook, Digg, Tumblr, Dailymotion, and Slack.|$|E
500|$|Following {{the games}} release, many issues with {{networking}} and player statistics were reported, such as delays in receiving points and awards, {{failure to receive}} the points or awards, and [...] "connection failed" [...] and [...] "connection lost" [...] errors. To address these issues, Incognito released several <b>server-side</b> patches before releasing the games first update, Version 1.1. This update addressed the majority of issues users experienced with the game, with others being addressed in the Version 1.2 update. A demo was released on the PlayStation Store on October 9, 2008.|$|E
