40|$|A sound {{understanding}} of the socio-economic characteristics of smallholder farmers and how they influence their crop diversification decisions would help policy makers in crafting appropriate measures for <b>promoting</b> <b>crop</b> diversification. The objectives {{of this study is}} to assess the degree of crop diversification and the factors influencing crop diversification among the farm households at Dundwa Agricultural Camp of Zambia. The study uses primary data collected from 60 farm households using structured questionnaire during the period October to November 2014. The degree of crop diversification among farm households was measured using the Entropy index. Further, the censored Tobit model was used to examine how the farmers’ socioeconomic characteristics influences crop diversification. The mean entropy index is 0. 88 and this showsa very high degree of crop diversification among the farmers. The Tobit regression model showed that crop diversification is positively influenced by the gender of head of household, the production of cash crops by the household and household investment in basic farming equipment. On contrary, the age of head of household, total farm size, access to agricultural markets and total area cultivated negatively influenced crop diversification. The study recommends for increased capacity building of female headed households in farm decision-making and promoting household investment in basic farming implements as measures to <b>promoting</b> <b>crop</b> diversification...|$|R

40|$|The {{availability}} of nitrogen {{is one of}} the major limiting factors to crop growth. In the developed world, farmers use unsustainable levels of inorganic fertilisers to <b>promote</b> <b>crop</b> production. In contrast, in the developing world inorganic fertilisers are often not available and small-holder farmers suffer the resultant poor yields. Finding alternatives to inorganic fertilisers is critical for sustainable and secure food production. Bacteria and Archaea have evolved the capability to fix atmospheric nitrogen to ammonia, a form readily usable in biological processes. This capability presents an opportunity to improve the nutrition of crop plants, through the introduction into cereal crops of either the nitrogen fixing bacteria or the nitrogenase enzyme responsible for nitrogen fixation. While both approaches are challenging, recent advances have laid the groundwork to initiate these biotechnological solutions to the nitrogen problem...|$|R

Zero tillage is a fundamental management practice that <b>promotes</b> <b>crop</b> stubble retention under longer unplanned fallows when crops cannot be planted. Such management practices that succeed in retaining suitable soil cover in areas under fallow will ultimately reduce soil loss.
