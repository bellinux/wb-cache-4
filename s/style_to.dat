5|$|It is {{believed}} by historians that 168, 170 and 172 Denmark Hill {{were designed by}} noted architect and prison designer William Blackburn due their similarity in architectural <b>style</b> <b>to</b> his other buildings.

40|$|FOA [Formatting Object Authoring] is an {{open-source}} {{authoring tool}} that applies rich <b>styling</b> <b>to</b> XML content. It allows the <b>styling</b> <b>to</b> be re-used across multiple documents. It also allows the author to build or import {{a library of}} style components. It is based on XSL-FO, the W 3 C-defined markup language, whose aim is <b>to</b> add rich <b>styling</b> <b>to</b> XML content, especially for paginated documents. The architecture of FOA permits the author to create and modify style sets, and also allows these <b>styles</b> <b>to</b> be re-applied to different XML content. The tool generates an XSL stylesheet, based on the style information It takes the XML content and produces an XSL-FO document, which can then be rendered into different output formats. An extension to an XSL-FO renderer allows the author to preview the output within the authoring tool...|$|R

Bahá'u'lláh, however, states himself that {{the essence of}} God will never descend into the human world. Statements where Bahá'u'lláh speaks with the voice of God are meant {{that he is not}} actually God, but that he is speaking with the attributes of God.|$|E

5|$|All that {{is known}} of the {{appearance}} of the castle is from contemporary drawings. Although these may seem fanciful to modern eyes, there are better preserved sites which share some features. Tutbury and Pontefract Castles both have similar gatehouses and chapels, and Tutbury's motte and Pontefract's curtain wall are also close in <b>style</b> <b>to</b> those in the illustrations. Sandal Castle has a multi-angular tower like those depicted, and this feature is confirmed at Melbourne by foundations which still remain.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the writing}} {{received}} mixed reviews, {{the reception of}} the artwork was almost entirely positive. Higgins, recalling the heavy blacks and bold outlines of the original strip, found Critchlow's new <b>style</b> <b>to</b> be much more open and expressive. Maxwell also praised Critchlow's development as an artist, judging the comic to be beautifully drawn and coloured with a clear line style. Carter thought that the art was a little flat in places, but nevertheless praised it for being unique {{with a lot of}} character.|$|E

Her later work marked an evolution in her sound with rare instruments, electronics and unusual sound samples. Critics have acclaimed a distinctive <b>style</b> <b>to</b> her music. Lyrically incorporating a range of political, social, philosophical and cultural references that have defied existing pop music conventions, Arulpragasam {{was one of the}} first acts to come to public attention through the internet. She posted many of her songs and videos from 2002 onwards on platforms such as MySpace.|$|E
5|$|As {{mentioned}} above, Schubert's last sonatas {{have long}} been historically neglected, dismissed as inferior in <b>style</b> <b>to</b> Beethoven's piano sonatas. However, the negative view has changed during the late twentieth century, and today these works are usually praised for their conveying of an idiosyncratic, personal Schubertian style, indeed quite different from Beethoven's, but holding its own virtues. In this mature style, the Classical perception of harmony and tonality, and the treatment of musical structure, are radically altered, generating a new, distinct type of sonata form.|$|E
5|$|At this time, one of De Morgan's 1902 tablets was removed. Commemorating four {{workers who}} had died in an {{accident}} at the East Ham Sewage Works in 1895, Watts had mistakenly listed the incident as having taken place at the West Ham Sewage Works in 1885. The DeMorgan tablet was removed and replaced with a Royal Doulton tablet giving the correct location and date. As the Doulton tablets were in such a different <b>style</b> <b>to</b> DeMorgan's, the replacement tablet was installed in the second row next to the three new tablets to police officers, rather than in the space left by the original.|$|E
