The authors conclude that the dynamic interaction between the NPS market and policy change initially characterised as ‘cat and mouse’ might now be conceived of as ‘hare and hounds’ in that legislative control has been a <b>significant</b> <b>driving</b> force in manufacturing and retail innovation...|$|R

While {{for an extended period}} of time the island was considered devoid of plants, the greatest amount of plant diversity later on was found where erosion had removed new material and allowed old soil to come to the surface. In these rare places where soil was exposed, it allowed for the new growth of plants and vegetation.
