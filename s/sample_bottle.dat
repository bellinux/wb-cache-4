5000|$|The first {{source of}} error is the {{sampling}} error. Pipelines operate at high pressure. To do an analysis using a field GC, the pressure has to be regulated down to close to atmospheric pressure. In the process of reducing pressure, some of the heavier components may drop out, particularly if the pressure reduction {{is done in the}} retrograde region. Therefore, the gas reaching the GC is fundamentally different (usually leaner in the heavy components) than the actual gas in the pipeline. Alternatively, if a <b>sample</b> <b>bottle</b> is collected for delivery to a laboratory for analysis, significant care must be taken not to introduce any contaminants to the sample, {{to make sure that the}} <b>sample</b> <b>bottle</b> represents the actual gas in the pipeline, and to extract the complete sample correctly in to the laboratory GC.|$|E

50|$|One common {{method for}} {{collecting}} a plankton sample is to tow the net horizontally using a low-speed boat. Before collecting the plankton, the net should be rinsed with the sample water. The user should {{ensure that the}} cod end is completely closed by turning the valve into a vertical position. Then the plankton net is then lowered horizontal to the water surface {{at the side of}} the slowly moving boat. Sampling is done for 1.5 minutes. After this time, the plankton sample is collected in a <b>sample</b> <b>bottle</b> by opening the cod end above it by turning the valve horizontally.|$|E
50|$|The minimum aliquot volume {{transferred}} to a 300 mL CBOD bottle will be 3 mL as set by Standard Methods. If a smaller volume is needed to meet the DO depletion requirements, then you must make dilutions to the sample. Add approximately 0.1 g of Nitrification Inhibitor (2-chloro-6-(trichloro-methyl) pyridine) to each 300mL CBOD bottle before adding CBOD dilution water. If the sample is being prepared as a seeded sample, add enough prepared seed to the sample to achieve acceptable dissolved oxygen depletion. Add CBOD Dilution water to each CBOD <b>sample</b> <b>bottle</b> so as to completely fill the bottle with no air spaces or bubbles when the stopper {{is placed in the}} bottle.|$|E

5000|$|One of the wittier raids from Balliol, in 1962 or 1963, {{involved}} the turfing {{of the whole}} of Trinity JCR (complete with daffodils). One {{of the most famous}} incidents was practised by three Trinity students (Richard Todd, Richard Cohen and Deidrie Small) on the new intake of freshers to Balliol in October 1985. They sent personally addressed letters to each of Balliol's new freshers on Balliol headed notepaper. It enclosed a narrow neck 100ml screw-top receptacle. The attached letter read, [...] "Dear X, Welcome to Balliol. As you are aware the university requires a short medical check-up as part of your Coming-Up. Could you therefore please provide a urine sample in the attached <b>sample</b> <b>bottle</b> and return it to your college tutor's office by no later than 5.00 PM on Wednesday." [...] The letters were sent out on that Wednesday evening. Balliol admitted to some 57 being returned. The incident was subsequently reported in the Daily Express under the headline, [...] "students play wee joke on neighbours". The incident concluded with Todd and Cohen unfurling a banner over Balliol reading, [...] "We are Balliol. Please Don't Take The Piss!". The last incident suspected to relate to the feud was the vandalism of Trinity's SCR pond in 2010, which led to the death of {{all but one of the}} fish.|$|E
5000|$|The {{second source}} is the error on the {{analysis}} of the gas mix components. A typical field GC will have at best (under ideal conditions and frequent calibration) ~2% (of range) error in the quantity of each gas analyzed. Since the range for most field-GCs for C6 components is 0-1 mol%, there will be about 0.02 mol% uncertainty in the quantity of C6+ components. While this error does not change the heating value by much, it will introduce a significant error in the HCDP determination. Furthermore, since the exact distribution of C6+ components is an unknown (the amount of C6, C7, C8, ...), this further introduces additional errors in any HCDP calculations. When using a C6+ GC these errors can be as high as 100 °F or more, depending on the gas mixture and the assumptions made regarding the composition of the C6+ fraction. For [...] "pipeline quality" [...] natural gas, a C9+ GC analysis may reduce the uncertainty, because it eliminates the C6-C8 distribution error. However, independent {{studies have shown that the}} cumulative error can still be very significant, in some cases in excess of 30 C. A laboratory C12+ GC analysis using an Flame Ionization Detector (FID) can reduce the error further. However, using a C12 laboratory system can introduce additional errors, namely sampling error. If the gas has to be collected in a <b>sample</b> <b>bottle</b> and shipped to a laboratory for C12 analysis, sampling errors can be significant. Obviously there is also a lag time error between the time the sample was collected and the time it was analyzed.|$|E
5000|$|Arbuckle plays a {{drug store}} clerk, soda jerk, and gas station attendant, {{who can be}} both lazy and dishonest. After he mixes a soda for one {{customer}} with elaborate gestures and juggling of utensils, he attends the perfume counter, where another customer has been indulging herself with a free sample. After he confronts her, he is distracted while an African American customer {{steps up to the}} counter. When the clerk hugs her and then realizes it is a different customer, he almost faints. Later one, while still on the job, he proposes to his boss's daughter Alice (Alice Mann), and she gleefully accepts. The scene then switches to the gas pump, where Arbuckle's character switches the sign to a higher price when a person with an expensive car drives up. After the car drives away, he drinks from the pump. Meanwhile inside, Al (Al St. John), another admirer of Alice, also proposes to her while they are eating watermelon. When she is tells him she is already engaged to the soda clerk, Al becomes outraged and begins causing a commotion in the store. After a food fight that involves several customers, the owner of the store throws Al out. Later in the day a delivery boy (Buster Keaton), after a prat fall over a bicycle rack, delivers Alice's wedding dress to her room above the store. He agrees to model it for her when she expresses worry that it will not fit her. When a male customer enters and annoys the clerk, he puts chloroform in the <b>sample</b> <b>bottle</b> to knock him out if he comes in again. The male customer never returns, but several female customers end up knocking themselves out. When a pretty woman arrives, Fatty deliberately knocks her unconscious so he can kiss her. He knocks out his boss, who could be a witness, as well. After he sees another customer sampling the perfume, he is shocked when it has no effect on her, even when she drinks it. He investigates by spraying himself with the [...] "perfume" [...] but is himself knocked out. With Arbuckle's character unconscious, Al, the rejected lover, sneaks into the store with his gang and kidnaps the delivery boy, thinking it is Alice, since his face was covered by a wedding veil. They tie him up and put a sack over his head and, escaping out of the second story window, take the delivery boy by to the justice of the peace's office. There they attempt to force the justice of peace to marry them at gunpoint. However, the soda clerk regains consciousness and, thinking the group has actually kidnapped Alice, pursues the group, but only after he comically struggles with a mule that he wants to hook to a wagon. He thwarts the gang just in time. He then convinces the justice of the peace to marry him to the delivery boy, whom, since his head is still covered in the sack, he thinks is Alice. Alice, discovering what has happened, gets on a bicycle and heads to the justice of the peace's office as well. She arrives in time to stop the clerk from marrying the delivery boy. Arbuckle's character then throws Keaton's character into the room with Al and his henchmen. While that scene of slapstick fighting goes on in that room, the soda clerk and Alice must have been married, for in the final scene the clerk pays the justice of the peace but then sprays him with the chloroform in the perfume bottle and takes his money back. The film ends long before the newly wed couple reach their wedding night, as the title might have suggested would be forthcoming.|$|E

40|$|A {{research}} project was recently initiated which requires that water quality samples {{be taken from}} small ponds and lagoons in west-central Illinois. A method for obtaining these pond water samples was desired that could be handled conveniently by one person and would not require a small boat. The pond water sampler described here was developed to satisfy this need. The sampler developed allows one person to obtain a water sample at any desired depth while remaining on the shore. After assembling the device it may be floated to any position on the pond surface, lowered to the desired depth, and a sample taken. It is then retrieved by following the previous steps in reverse order as illustrated in Fig. 1. Water samples have been obtained {{at a distance of}} 40 ft from the pond shore and at a depth of 16 ft below the pond surface. The pond water sampler consists of a telescoping rod, manufactured for window washing units, with a T-handle and fishing rod reels on one end (Fig. 2); and the sampler head (Fig. 3) and float on the other end. Cords run from the operator end of the sampler to the sampler head and float to allow the operator to control the float and sampler head. The sampler head holds the <b>sample</b> <b>bottle</b> and may be triggered to allow sampling to occur when the operator desires. The sampler (Fig. 3) consists of three separate components: the sampler head base, the bottle plate, and the stopper plate. The sampler head base is attached to the telescoping rod and contains the water port through which water enters the <b>sample</b> <b>bottle.</b> An extension to the water port which extends into the <b>sample</b> <b>bottle</b> is attached to the sampler head base. Additionally, the base contains an air escape port. The bottle plate is attached to the sampler head base and is fabricated with threads for the <b>sample</b> <b>bottle.</b> The bottle plate may be easily removed from the sampler head base so that other bottle plates fitting different sample bottles may be used with the same sampler head. The stopper plate with stopper is spring loaded to seal the water port while it is being positioned for sampling and after the sample has been taken. To obtain a sample the rod is extended to the desired length and the bottle is attached to the sampler head on the pond shore (Fig. la). The bottle and sampler head is floated to the desired position on the pond surface with the float held tightly to the sampler end of the rod (Fig. lb). The cord to the float is then released to allow the sampler head and bottle to sink to the desired sampling depth (Fig. lc). When the desired depth is reached, the sampler head cord is pulled and water is allowed to fill the <b>sample</b> <b>bottle</b> (Fig. ld). Pulling the sampler head cord removes the stopper from the water port thus allowing the bottle to fill with water through the water port and extension. The air is allowed to escape through the small air escape port in the sampler head base and is conducted {{a few feet from the}} sampler head through a flexible tube. This reduces the possibility of escaping air changing the oxygen content of the water which is being sampled. The sampler head and bottle are returned to the surface using the float and float cord (Fig. le), and the apparatus is floated back to the shore (Fig. lf) ...|$|E
50|$|Most other {{water samples}} are {{taken by the}} water supplier's {{personnel}}. Trained personnel using consistent procedures generally yield more reliable data.

30|$|Five {{models of}} {{drinking}} bottles from different manufacturers were tested. Three models {{were lined with}} a clear plastic coating and two were not. Three units of each model were tested. The following tests were performed with tap water (pH 7.58) to replicate typical use by consumers. The water was stored at 8  °C in a cold room for 1  week in a 100 -L polyethylene (PE) canister with an outlet tap. The canister was rinsed 3 times with 5  L of tap water before use. This water was used to wash and fill the drinking bottles {{as well as for}} preparation of tea from tea bags and to dissolve the granulated tea. Three samples of the tap water were stored in 250 -mL PE 1 <b>sample</b> <b>bottles</b> (Heinz Gero Duhme GMBH, Frankfurt, Germany) for blank value testing. <b>Sample</b> <b>bottles</b> were rinsed three times with 100  mL tap water before filling.|$|R
40|$|Water {{sampling}} is {{an important}} item of observation in Oceanography. In general, as in Nansen system, <b>sampling</b> <b>bottle</b> is inverted by sending a messenger weight to strike bottle holder, {{and the depth of}} water sampling is determined from the pay-out length and the inclination angle of wire rope while the calculation is troublesome and unreliable. A new sampling system proposed in this report is composed of a sensor tube and a <b>sampling</b> <b>bottle.</b> The sensor tube reads the water pressure corresponding to the water depth, and at the appointed depth, the sensor release the bottle suspension to be inverted. Therefore, it needs neither sending messenger nor correcting water depth. Many kind of improvement in devices were repeated by the trial and error method, and finally the deviation was settled within five percent in water depth. 潮流や風に左右されずに設定水深で自動的に転倒する採水器を,操作の簡易性に重点を置いて試作した。試行錯誤と改良作業の連続の結果,Acryl No. 2 に至ってほぼ満足すべき性能を得た。以下にその特徴について述べる。(1) 原理的にケーブルの傾斜補正とメッセンジャーの投下が不要になる。(2) 透明プラスチックの採用によって,軽量で断熱性にすぐれ内部の観察に便利である。(3) 総べて市販材料を用いるので手軽に作れる。(4) 特別に動力を必要としないが,バッテリ駆動の魚釣り用線長計付き電動リールを使用すれば,スピードアップと労力節約がはかれる。なお,釣竿を使用すれば転倒時の手応えを増巾することができる。前述のように,採水深度を増すに従って種々の問題点の表面化が予想されるが, 200 m以浅では非常に良好な作動を示した。従って例えば赤潮の鉛直分布のような沿岸域の環境調査に利用すれば,有力な武器となり得るであろう...|$|R
