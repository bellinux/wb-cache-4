5000|$|In 1941 Hans Jenny's (1899-1992) Factors of Soil Formation, {{a system}} of {{quantitative}} pedology, concisely summarized and illustrated many of {{the basic principles of}} modern soil science to that date. Since 1940, time has assumed much greater significance among the factors of soil formation, and geomorphological studies have become important in determining the time that soil material at any place has been subjected to soil-forming processes. Meanwhile, advances in soil chemistry, soil physics, <b>soil</b> <b>mineralogy,</b> and soil biology, {{as well as in the}} basic sciences that underlie them, have added new tools and new dimensions to the study of soil formation. As a consequence, the formation of soil has come to be treated as the aggregate of many interrelated physical, chemical, and biological processes. These processes are subject to quantitative study in soil physics, soil chemistry, <b>soil</b> <b>mineralogy,</b> and soil biology. The focus of attention also has shifted from the study of gross attributes of the whole soil to the co-varying detail of individual parts, including grain-to-grain relationships.|$|E
50|$|Soil {{color is}} {{primarily}} influenced by <b>soil</b> <b>mineralogy.</b> Many soil colours {{are due to}} various iron minerals. The development and distribution of colour in a soil profile result from chemical and biological weathering, especially redox reactions. As the primary minerals in soil parent material weather, the elements combine into new and colourful compounds. Iron forms secondary minerals of a yellow or red colour, organic matter decomposes into black and brown compounds, and manganese, sulfur and nitrogen can form black mineral deposits. These pigments can produce various colour patterns within a soil. Aerobic conditions produce uniform or gradual colour changes, while reducing environments (anaerobic) result in rapid colour flow with complex, mottled patterns and points of colour concentration.|$|E

To investigate the effects of polymer and bentonite fluids on the behaviour of bored piles, a field trial comprising three full-scale instrumented test piles has been conducted at a site in East London. It was found that the two piles constructed using polymer fluids showed much stiffer load-settlement response than the one constructed using bentonite slurry. Surprisingly, an extended pile bore open time of up to 26 h was found to have no adverse effect on the piles if supported by polymer fluids. Based on the results of back-analyses using the load-transfer approach, polymer fluids were found to have little effect on the Woolwich and Reading Formations but a noticeable effect on the Upnor Formation – the mixed results are believed be due to the different <b>soil</b> <b>mineralogies.</b> It has also been shown that the common problem of ‘soft toes’ can be eliminated by adopting good construction practice including proper base checking and fluid cleaning or exchange procedures on site...|$|R

40|$|A large {{source of}} {{uncertainty}} in present {{understanding of the}} global carbon cycle is the distribution and dynamics of the soil organic carbon reservoir, Most of the organic carbon in soils is; degraded to inorganic forms slowly, on timescales from centuries to millennia(1). Soil minerals are known to play a stabilizing role, but how spatial and temporal variation in <b>soil</b> <b>mineralogy</b> controls the quantity and turnover of long-residence-time organic carbon is not well known(2). Here we use radiocarbon analyses to explore interactions between <b>soil</b> <b>mineralogy</b> and soil organic carbon along two natural gradients-of soil-age and of climate-in volcanic soil environments, During the first similar to 150, 000 years of soil development, the volcanic parent material weathered to metastable, non-crystalline minerals, Thereafter, the amount of non-crystalline minerals declined, and more stable crystalline minerals accumulated. Soil organic carbon content followed a similar trend, accumulating to a maximum after 150, 000 years, and then decreasing by 50 % {{over the next four}} million years. A positive relationship between non-crystalline minerals and organic carbon was also observed in soils through the climate gradient, indicating that the accumulation and subsequent loss of organic matter were largely driven by changes in the millennial scale cycling of mineral-stabilized carbon, rather than by changes in the amount of fast-cycling organic matter or in net primary productivity. <b>Soil</b> <b>mineralogy</b> is therefore important in determining the quantity of organic carbon stored in soil, its turnover time, and atmosphere-ecosystem carbon fluxes during long-term soil development; this conclusion should be generalizable at least to other humid environments...|$|E

40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. Clay soils shrink and swell {{with changes in}} {{moisture}} content. This can be exacerbated {{in the presence of}} trees, and in the vicinity of buildings, the resultant effects can cause structural damage. For foundation design in such circumstances in the UK, reference is often made to guidelines published by the National House Building Council (NHBC), which were primarily written for low-rise residential structures. These guidelines are based on a clay shrink / swell potential assessed using Atterberg Limits and a 'water demand' classification for trees. Atterberg limits are semi-empirical tests that assess a fraction of a soil sample which passes an arbitrary sieve size. The structural features of clay <b>soils,</b> <b>mineralogy,</b> chemistry, prior stress history and cyclic effects all influence the magnitude of volumetric change. Atterberg limits do not directly measure any of these features but have been related to some of them empirically. This paper reviews the processes of clay shrinkage and swelling and the applicability of the Atterberg limits in the assessment of volume change potential. It concludes that modifications to the NHBC guidelines can make designs more site specific. However, because the guidelines are based on a cost - benefit analysis, they will over-design foundations for structures other than low rise residential houses and will not be relevant for others. It is concluded that a more appropriate analysis should be based on a wider overall assessment of all the available soil/site information, in conjunction with a simple assessment of plasticity...|$|R
40|$|Soil {{texture and}} the soil water {{characteristic}} are key properties {{used to estimate}} flow and transport parameters. Determination of clay content is therefore critical for understanding of plot-scale soil heterogeneity. With increasing interest in proximal soil sensing, there {{is the need to}} relate obtained signals to soil properties of interest. Inference of soil texture, especially clay mineral content, from instrument response from electromagnetic induction and radiometric methods is of substantial interest. However, the cost of soil sampling and analysis required to link proximal measurements and soil properties, for example, clay mineral content, can sometimes outweigh the benefits of using a fast proximal technique. In this paper, we propose that determination of a soil's hygroscopic water content at 50 % atmospheric relative humidity (RH 50), which is time and cost efficient, and particularly suitable for developing countries, can act as a useful surrogate for clay content in interpreting soil spatial patterns based on proximal signals. We used standard clays such as kaolinite, illite, and montmorillonite to determine the water release characteristic as a function of hygroscopic water content. We also determined clay content of soils from temperate (Arizona, United States) and tropical (Trinidad) regions using the hydrometer method and hygroscopic water content for soils equilibrated at RH 50.

40|$|Abstract – Soil {{productivity}} is generally associated with poor nutrient {{status and the}} physical condition of the soil, but the effect of <b>soil</b> <b>mineralogy</b> on soil productivity has received little attention. In this qualitative study, interactions between mineralogy and physico-chemistry and their role on the productivity of two luvisols, an arenosol and a vertisol are investigated. Minerals identified in the soils included smectites in the vertisol, kaolinite, quartz, hydromica, albite and biotite in the luvisols and arenosol. The presence of smectite in the vertisol has resulted in it having a higher organic matter content, higher cation exchange capacity, higher water holding capacity, and low bulk density than both luvisols and the arenosol. Both luvisols and the arenosol were dominated by quartz, feldspars and kaolinite, which are chemically inert compared to smectite and have fewer effects on soil cation exchange capacity, water holding capacity, and bulk density.

The electro conductivity (EC) measurement is a simple method to monitor any variation in the pore fluid of soils. EC is the ability of a material to transmit (conduct) an electrical current. This paper focuses attention on the effect of soil-pore fluid interaction on the EC of clayey soils. A set of physico-chemical experiments are performed and the role of different factors including soil pH, <b>soil</b> <b>mineralogy,</b> soil: water ratio, cation and anion effects are investigated. The results {{of this study indicate that}} for soil that has a relatively low CEC, the anion type is an important factor, while the cation type does not noticeably affect the EC of the soil-solution. However, for such soil, an electrolyte property, i. e. its solubility, is much more effective than the CEC of the soil.

Determination of suitable topsoil replacements is based on chemical analysis, including neutralization potential (NP), a component of acid-base accounting (ABA).

Samples were obtained from the Northwestern Resources (NWR) mine in Jewett, Texas Utilities (TXU) mines at Oak Hill and Big Brown, and Intermountain Laboratories (IML) in College Station. The IML samples all contained FeCO? and had high ABA values. The FeCO? rock obtained from the NWR mine has cation substitution for Fe in the lattice. The conducted research examined reactions of FeCO? under various testing conditions as related to NP determination as well as accuracy of the NP method. The effects of hydrogen peroxide (H?O?), potassium persulfate (K?S?O?), and potassium permanganate (KMnO?) on the NP of mixed overburden containing FeCO? were studied. Hydrogen peroxide produced variable results depending upon complete removal of excess oxidant. Oxidation with K?S?O? produced lower NP values that the standard method.
