25|$|After the loyalists {{were taken}} away, Minh read the coup {{proclamation}} and his objectives and taped it {{and asked the}} other officers to sign the papers. They then <b>spoke</b> <b>into</b> the recorder, identifying themselves as supporters of the coup. Minh told his subordinates to have copies made of the original, and hid the copies in several places so that his accomplices could not claim {{that they were not}} involved if the putsch failed. Minh was to play them over the radio later that day.|$|E

2500|$|After the Seahawks won the {{overtime}} coin flip, Hasselbeck inadvertently <b>spoke</b> <b>into</b> the referee's microphone, [...] "We {{want the}} ball and we're gonna score!" [...] After both teams went three-and-out on their first drives of the extra period, Seattle drove to their own 45-yard line before Harris intercepted Hasselbeck's pass and returned it 52 yards for the winning touchdown.|$|E

2500|$|The first {{successful}} bi-directional transmission of clear speech by Bell and Watson {{was made on}} March 10, 1876, when Bell <b>spoke</b> <b>into</b> the device, [...] "Mr. Watson, come here, I want to see you." [...] and Watson answered. Bell tested Gray's liquid transmitter design in this experiment, but only after Bell's patent was granted and only as a proof of concept scientific experiment to prove to his own satisfaction that intelligible [...] "articulate speech" [...] (Bell's words) could be electrically transmitted. Because a liquid transmitter was not practical for commercial products, Bell focused on improving the electromagnetic telephone after March 1876 and never used Gray's liquid transmitter in public demonstrations or commercial use.|$|E
2500|$|Linda and Noor {{were sitting}} on a {{two-seater}} couch with Charlotte sitting on the arm, when Noor started touching Linda in a sexual way. He <b>spoke</b> <b>into</b> her ear, {{put his arms around}} her waist and refused to let her go. Kathleen then started screaming at him and a verbal altercation took place where Kathleen Mulhall was alleged to have instructed them to ”just kill him for me" [...] Charlotte picked up a Stanley knife and struck Noor across the throat, inflicting a wound that sent him to the ground. Linda then picked up a hammer and hit him on the head a number of times. Their mother looked on but didn't participate. Noor was stabbed at least 27 times. It may have been more, but pathologists had no opportunity to examine the full body.|$|E
2500|$|On 15 April 1972, {{brothers}} Gerry and John Conway—both Catholic civilians—were {{walking along}} Whiterock Road {{to catch a}} bus. As they passed St Thomas's School, a car stopped, and three men leapt out and began shooting at them with pistols. The brothers ran, but both were shot and wounded. Witnesses {{said one of the}} gunmen returned to the car and <b>spoke</b> <b>into</b> a handset radio. Shortly afterward two armoured personnel carriers arrived, and there was a conversation between the uniformed and the plainclothes soldiers. The three vehicles then left, and the brothers were taken by ambulance to the Royal Victoria Hospital. The British Army told journalists that a patrol had encountered two wanted men, that one had fired at the patrol, and that the patrol returned fire. In a 1978 interview, a former MRF member claimed he {{had been one of the}} gunmen. He confirmed that the brothers were unarmed but claimed his patrol had mistaken the brothers for two IRA men whom the MRF were ordered to [...] "shoot on sight".|$|E

2500|$|After Bell and Watson {{discovered}} on June 2, 1875, that {{movements of the}} reed alone in a magnetic field could reproduce the frequencies and timbre of spoken sound waves, Bell reasoned by analogy with the mechanical phonautograph that a skin diaphragm would reproduce sounds like the human ear when connected to a steel or iron reed or hinged armature. On July 1, 1875, he instructed Watson to build a receiver consisting of a stretched diaphragm or drum of goldbeater's skin with an armature of magnetized iron attached to its middle, and free to vibrate {{in front of the}} pole of an electromagnet in circuit with the line. A second membrane-device was built for use as a transmitter. This was the [...] "gallows" [...] phone. A few days later they were tried together, one {{at each end of the}} line, which ran from a room in the inventor's house, located at 5 Exeter Place in Boston, to the cellar underneath. Bell, in the work room, held one instrument in his hands, while Watson in the cellar listened at the other. Bell <b>spoke</b> <b>into</b> his instrument, [...] "Do you understand what I say?" [...] and Mr. Watson answered [...] "Yes". However, the voice sounds were not distinct and the armature tended to stick to the electromagnet pole and tear the membrane.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: To {{develop a}} fast and {{flexible}} free-breathing dynamic volumetric MRI technique, iterative Golden-angle RAdial Sparse Parallel MRI (iGRASP), that combines compressed sensing, parallel imaging, and golden-angle radial sampling. Methods: Radial k-space data are acquired continuously using the golden-angle scheme and sorted into time series by grouping an arbitrary number of consecutive <b>spokes</b> <b>into</b> temporal frames. An iterative reconstruction procedure is then {{performed on the}} undersampled time series where joint multicoil sparsity is enforced by applying a total-variation constraint along the temporal dimension. Required coil-sensitivity profiles are obtained from the time-averaged data. Results: iGRASP achieved higher acceleration capability than either parallel imaging or coil-by-coil compressed sensing alone. It enabled dynamic volumetric imaging with high spatial and temporal resolution for various clinical applications, including free-breathing dynamic contrast-enhanced imaging in the abdomen o...|$|R
