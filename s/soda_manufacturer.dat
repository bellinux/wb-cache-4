500|$|The Seven Up Bar was a {{candy bar}} {{comprising}} seven different chocolate [...] "pillows", each filled with a different flavor. [...] Flavors changed with the availability and popularity of ingredients, which included, among others, brazil nut, buttercream, butterscotch, caramel, cherry, coconut, fudge, mint, nougat and orange. [...] The high manufacturing costs and trademark issues with a <b>soda</b> <b>manufacturer</b> (The American Bottling Company, today Cadbury Schweppes), caused the bar to be retired in 1979.|$|E

50|$|The Henry DeLand House {{also known}} as the Green Lantern Inn was built from 1874 to 1876 in the village of Fairport, New York as a home for Henry Addison DeLand. DeLand was a member of an {{influential}} local family and was a baking <b>soda</b> <b>manufacturer.</b> It is located at 1 East Church street, at the intersection of South Main street.|$|E
50|$|Cherry cola is a {{soft drink}} made by mixing cherry-flavored syrup into cola. It {{is a popular}} mixture that has been {{available}} at old-fashioned soda fountains for years. Several major <b>soda</b> <b>manufacturers</b> market {{their own version of}} the beverage, including Coca-Cola Cherry, Pepsi Wild Cherry and Cherry RC.There are also alcoholic drinks called cherry cola, containing Coca-Cola often with vodka and grenadine.|$|R
50|$|West Jefferson is {{the home}} of <b>soda</b> <b>manufacturers</b> West Jefferson Dr Pepper (WJDP). The company is known for {{producing}} all their non-diet products with cane sugar, most of which are Dr Pepper Snapple Group (formerly Dr Pepper/Seven Up) products but also include Mountain Dew.

5000|$|Therefore, in the 1990s, {{the company}} {{initiated}} {{the process of}} building a capital group, concentrating major national manufacturing sites around itself. These transformations were crowned by the company's entry to the Warsaw Stock Exchange in 2005, which proved a great success. It provided the company with access to capital and means of implementing bold activation measures. As a result of the company's listing on the stock exchange, its prestige increased, along with credibility and brand recognition. One year later, CIECH confirmed its position as {{one of the leaders of}} the European chemical industry by completing the purchase of the first foreign manufacturing subsidiary of the Group, a Romanian soda factory, [...] "US Govora" [...] (now: [...] "CIECH Soda Romania"). In the same year, [...] "ZCh Organika-Sarzyna" [...] (now: [...] "CIECH Sarzyna") was also purchased. In 2007, the company acquired a German <b>soda</b> <b>manufacturer,</b> [...] "Sodawerk Stassfurt" [...] (now: [...] "CIECH Soda Deutschland"), and fortified its position as the second largest <b>soda</b> <b>manufacturer</b> in Europe.|$|E
50|$|On 21 November 1879, Lancashire chemist John Hargreaves canvassed {{a meeting}} of chemists and {{managers}} in Widnes, St Helens and Runcorn to consider {{the formation of a}} chemical society. Modelled on the successful Tyne Chemical Society already operating in Newcastle, the newly proposed South Lancashire Chemical Society held its first meeting on 29 January 1880 in Liverpool, with the eminent industrial chemist and <b>soda</b> <b>manufacturer</b> Ludwig Mond presiding.|$|E
50|$|The area borders Branford and North Branford on the east, New Haven on {{the west}} to about Grannis Pond in the south, and {{surrounds}} State Route 80. This is the hilliest section of town. It counts among its landmarks the town high school, Foxon Park Beverage (a locally famous <b>soda</b> <b>manufacturer),</b> and Camp Murray, a Girl Scouts day camp. Grannis Pond used to host a YMCA camp until the land was sold and developed.|$|E

5000|$|After the tax took effect, Kenney {{said it was}} [...] "wrong" [...] and [...] "misleading" [...] for {{businesses}} to pass the tax on to their customers {{in the form of}} higher soda prices. In February 2017, <b>soda</b> <b>manufacturers</b> and retailers announced sales declines of 30-50% in Philadelphia and announced job cuts and layoffs, while the tax was projected to raise about $2.7 million per month, far below the estimate of $7.6 million per month. Kenny characterized the layoffs as evidence of greed among manufacturers.|$|R
50|$|Davis {{worked as}} a chemist at Brearley and Sons for three years. He also {{worked as a}}n {{inspector}} for the Alkali Act of 1863, a very early piece of environmental legislation that required <b>soda</b> <b>manufacturers</b> {{to reduce the amount}} of gaseous hydrochloric acid released to the atmosphere from their factories. In 1872 he was engaged as manager at the Lichfield Chemical Company in Staffordshire. In this job his capacity for innovation flourished. His works included what was at the time the tallest chimney in the UK, with a height of more than 200 ft.|$|R

50|$|Henry Addison Deland (October 25, 1834 — March 13, 1908) was {{a baking}} <b>soda</b> <b>manufacturer</b> from Fairport, New York. The Henry DeLand House he built there is {{listed on the}} National Register of Historic Places. Later, he founded DeLand, Florida (which had been {{formerly}} called Persimmon Hollow for the Persimmon trees that were abundant in the area) and the DeLand academy which became Stetson University. He suffered a severe financial loss due to guaranteeing Orange crops for farmers who rented his land.|$|E
5000|$|He joined Pepsi Cola Company as a sales {{representative}} and {{rose through the}} sales ranks becoming a marketing vice president in 1956. He headed up Pepsi's international operation in 1957 and became president in 1963. In 1963, he {{made the decision to}} change the name of Pepsi's diet soda from Patio Diet Cola to Diet Pepsi. In the early years of diet soft drinks, Pepsi became the first major <b>soda</b> <b>manufacturer</b> to give its diet product the same name as its flagship product.|$|E

Kenny characterized the layoffs as evidence of greed among manufacturers. In the first four months of the soda tax $25.6 million was collected, which is lower than predicted. The revenue is intended to pay for a pre-K program (49% of tax revenue), government employee benefits and city programs (20%), and rebuilding city parks and recreation centers.|$|R

50|$|Proponents {{of search}} {{neutrality}} desire transparency {{in a search}} engine's ranking algorithm. Requiring transparent algorithms leads to two concerns. These algorithms are the companies private intellectual property {{and should not be}} forced into the open. This would be similar to forcing a <b>soda</b> <b>manufacturer</b> to publish their recipes. The second concern is that opening the algorithm would allow spammers to exploit and target how the algorithm functions directly. This would permit spammers to circumvent the metrics in place that prevent spammed websites from being {{at the top of a}} SERP.|$|E
50|$|Asia Pulp & Paper (APP) has {{its roots}} in 1972, when Eka Tjipta Widjaja founded a small caustic <b>soda</b> <b>manufacturer</b> called Tjiwi Kimia. In 1978, Tjiwi Kimia {{commenced}} paper production of 12,000 tons/year. In December 1976, Indah Kiat was formed as a joint venture between CV Berkat (an Indonesian company), Chung Hwa Pulp Corporation and Yuen Foong Yu Paper Manufacturing Company Ltd. from Taiwan. In April 1979, Indah Kiat Tangerang mill's Paper Machine 1 and 2 started with a production of 100 tons/day of wood free paper. By March 1984, Indah Kiat Perawang mill's Pulp Machine 1 started producing bleached hardwood kraft pulp with an initial capacity of 250 tons/day.|$|E
50|$|Mineral water <b>soda</b> <b>manufacturers</b> {{who wanted}} to use Codd's Globe Stopper bottles had to pay a yearly fee for a licence to use his patent bottle. By mid-1873 he had granted 20 {{licences}} and received a further 50 applications. This was boosted further by a Trade Show held in London in the same year. By 1874 the licence was free to bottle manufacturers {{as long as they}} purchased the marbles, sealing rings and used his groove tool, and the mineral water firms they traded with had already bought a licence to use his bottle. Codd had two factories in London solely producing marbles, one in Kennington and the other in Camberwell, which was run by F. Barrett, the son of his financial backer.|$|R
50|$|To {{understand}} the mineral water trade better {{and to prove}} the worth of his invention he experimented at a small mineral water works in the Caledonian Road, Islington, in London. A letters patent issued to him in November 1870 stated he was a <b>soda</b> water <b>manufacturer</b> living at 6 Park Place, Islington.|$|R
5000|$|Urban legends that diet <b>soda</b> <b>manufacturers</b> bribed the American FDA {{to defraud}} the public {{have not been}} proven, but the FDA does permit any food or drink with fewer than 5 {{calories}} per serving to be labelled as containing 0 calories. Replacement of standard sodas with diet ones {{has been linked to}} [...] "significant weight loss" [...] by some studies but others have found no benefit at all, as participants simply consumed more calories from other sources. Claims by Coca Cola and Nestlé that their Enviga line of soft drinks had [...] "negative calories" [...] occasioned a false advertising suit against them by the Center for Science in the Public Interest in 2007. The companies settled with the Connecticut Attorney General in 2009, paying {{hundreds of thousands of dollars}} and agreeing that any weight-loss-related marketing of the product must be accompanied by disclaimers that weight is reduced only by diet and exercise.|$|R
50|$|The {{conversion}} of glucose to fructose {{is a key}} component of high-fructose corn syrup production. Isomerization is more specific than older chemical methods of fructose production, resulting in a higher yield of fructose and no side products. The fructose produced from this isomerization reaction is purer with no residual flavors from contaminants. High-fructose corn syrup is preferred by many confectionery and <b>soda</b> <b>manufacturers</b> because of the high sweetening power of fructose (twice that of sucrose), its relatively low cost and its inability to crystallize. Fructose is also used as a sweetener for use by diabetics. Major issues of the use of glucose isomerase involve its inactivation at higher temperatures and the requirement for a high pH (between 7.0 and 9.0) in the reaction environment. Moderately high temperatures, above 70 °C, increase the yield of fructose by at least half in the isomerization step. The enzyme requires a divalent cation such as Co2+ and Mg2+ for peak activity, an additional cost to manufacturers. Glucose isomerase also has a much higher affinity for xylose than for glucose, necessitating a carefully controlled environment.|$|R
40|$|Globally, soda {{taxes are}} gaining {{momentum}} as powerful interventions to discourage sugar consumption and thereby reduce the growing burden of obesity and non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Evidence from early adopters including Mexico and Berkeley, California, confirms that soda taxes can disincentivize consumption through price increases and raise revenue to support government programs. The United Kingdom’s new graduated levy on sweetened beverages is yielding yet another powerful impact: <b>soda</b> <b>manufacturers</b> are reformulating their beverages to {{significantly reduce the}} sugar content. Product reformulation – whether incentivized or mandatory – helps reduce overconsumption of sugars at the societal level, {{moving away from the}} long-standing notion of individual responsibility in favor of collective strategies to promote health. But as a matter of health equity, soda product reformulation should occur globally, especially in low- and middleincome countries (LMICs), which are increasingly targeted as emerging markets for soda and junk food and are disproportionately impacted by NCDs. As global momentum for sugar reduction increases, governments and public health advocates should harness the power of soda taxes to tackle the economic, social, and informational drivers of soda consumption, driving improvements in food environments and the public’s health. ...|$|R
5000|$|Liquid Carbonic spawned another leading <b>soda</b> {{fountain}} <b>manufacturer,</b> the Bastian-Blessing Company. Two Liquid Carbonic employees, Charles Bastian and Lewis Blessing, {{started their}} company in 1908. The newer manufacturers competed with the American Soda Fountain Company {{and took a}} large share of the market. The trust was broken up, and its member companies struggled to stay in business. During World War I, some manufacturers marketed [...] "50% fountains," [...] which used a combination of ice and mechanical refrigeration. In the early 1920s, many retail outlets purchased soda fountains using ammonia refrigeration.|$|R
50|$|As of 2015, {{advertisers}} and marketers look {{to involve}} their brands {{directly into the}} entertainment with native advertising and product placement (also known as brand integration or embedded marketing). An example of product placement would be for a <b>soda</b> pop <b>manufacturer</b> to pay a reality TV show producer to have the show's cast and host appear onscreen holding cans of the soft drink. Another common product placement is for an automotive manufacturer to give free cars to the producers of a TV show, {{in return for the}} show's producer depicting characters using these vehicles during the show.|$|R
50|$|The Second World War {{ended in}} 1945 {{and the company}} began its post war reconstruction. The Centralite plant (building 300) was {{acquired}} from the Government and re-equipped as an intermediates plant and plans were drawn up for a new intermediates plant (building 151) which was completed in 1951. Other projects undertaken in the early 1950s included a new PAK-ice plant, a new power plant and a new waste gas tunnel and chimney. The company also began the removal of a chemical spoil heap nicknamed the “mucky mountain”, which was left behind by a <b>soda</b> ash <b>manufacturer</b> that previously occupied the site.|$|R
5000|$|Prohibition was an {{important}} force {{in state and local}} politics from the 1840s through the 1930s. Numerous historical studies demonstrated that the political forces involved were ethnoreligious. Prohibition was supported by the dries, primarily pietistic Protestant denominations that included Methodists, Northern Baptists, Southern Baptists, New School Presbyterians, Disciples of Christ, Congregationalists, Quakers, and Scandinavian Lutherans, but also included the Catholic Total Abstinence Union of America and, to a certain extent, the Latter-day Saints. These religious groups identified saloons as politically corrupt and drinking as a personal sin. Other active organizations included the Women's Church Federation, the Women's Temperance Crusade, and the Department of Scientific Temperance Instruction. They were opposed by the wets, primarily liturgical Protestants (Episcopalians and German Lutherans) and Roman Catholics, who denounced the idea that the government should define morality. Even in the wet stronghold of New York City there was an active prohibition movement, led by Norwegian church groups and African-American labor activists who believed that prohibition would benefit workers, especially African Americans. Tea merchants and <b>soda</b> fountain <b>manufacturers</b> generally supported prohibition, believing a ban on alcohol would increase sales of their products. A particularly effective operator on the political front was Wayne Wheeler of the Anti-Saloon League, who made Prohibition a wedge issue and succeeded in getting many pro-prohibition candidates elected. Coming from Ohio, his deep resentment for alcohol started at a young age. He was injured on a farm by a worker who had been drunk. This event transformed Wheeler. Starting low in the ranks, he quickly moved up due to his deep rooted hatred of alcohol. He later realized to further the movement he would need more public approval, and fast. This was the start of his policy called 'wheelerism' where he used the media to make it seem like the general public was [...] "on in" [...] on a specific issue. Wheeler became known as the [...] "dry boss" [...] because of his influence and power.|$|R
