40|$|A primary {{tool that}} {{consumers}} have for comparative shopping is the shopbot, which {{is short for}} <b>shopping</b> <b>robot.</b> These shopbots automatically search {{a large number of}} vendors for price and availability. Typically a shopbot searches a predefined set of vendors and reports all results, which can result in time-consuming searches that provide redundant or dominated alternatives. Our research demonstrates analytically how shopbot designs can be improved by developing a utility model of consumer purchasing behavior. This utility model considers the intrinsic value of the product and its attributes, the disutility from waiting, and the cognitive costs associated with evaluating the offers retrieved. We focus on the operational decisions made by the shopbot: which stores to search, how long to wait, and which offers to present to the user. To illustrate our model we calibrate the model to price and response time data collected at online bookstores over a six-month period. Using prior expectations about price and response time, we show how shopbots can substantially increase consumer utility by searching more intelligently and then selectively presenting offers. intelligent agents, utility theory, information retrieval, stochastic modeling...|$|E
40|$|Zusammenfassung (dt.) Abstract: Interactive {{service robots}} {{have already been}} {{developed}} and operate as example installations taking over guidance tasks or serving as home assistants. However, none of these systems have become an off-the-shelf product or have achieved the predicted breakthrough so far. The challenges of the design of such systems are, on the one hand, the combination of cutting edge technologies to a complex product; on the other hand, the consideration of requirements important for the later marketing during the design process. In the framework of this dissertation, two interactive service robot systems are developed that {{have the potential to}} overcome current market entry barriers. These robots are designed to operate in two different environments: one robot guides walked-in users in large home improvement stores to requested product locations and interacts with the customer to provide product information; the other robot assists elderly people to stay longer in their homes and takes over home-care tasks. This work describes the realization of the embedded systems of both robots. In particular, the design of low-level system architectures, energy management systems, communication systems, sensor systems, and selected aspects of mechanical implementations are carried out in this work. Multiple embedded system modules are developed for the control of the robots' functionalities; the development processes as well as the composition and evaluation of these modules are presented in this work. To cope with the complexity and the various factors that are important for the design of the robots, this thesis applies and further develops system engineering methods. The development process is based on the V-Model system design method. The V-Model helps to structure the design process under consideration of all system requirements. It involves evaluation procedures at all design levels, and thus increases the quality and reliability of the development outputs. To support design decisions, this thesis proposes to combine the V-Model with the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method. The AHP helps to evaluate technical alternatives for design decisions according to overall criteria, a system has to fulfill. This thesis defines seven criteria that characterize a service robot: Adaptability, Operation Time, Usability, Robustness, Safeness, Features, and Costs. These criteria are weighted for each individual robot application. The AHP evaluates technical design alternatives based on the weighted criteria to reveal the best technical solution. The integration of the AHP into the V-Model development is tested and improved during the design process of the <b>shopping</b> <b>robot</b> system. The generality of this combined systematic design approach is validated during the design of the home-care robot system...|$|E

40|$|Buyers' search {{behaviors}} {{on electronic}} markets {{are characterized by}} two distinctive features: i) diminishing search costs and ii) the use of informational intermediaries such as price comparison agents (shopbots). We build a simple agent-based model that captures these two features, and we use this agent-based modeling to explore how the co-evolution of buyers and sellers (i. e. the joint dynamics of learning) may affect market's efficiency. First, we show the ambiguous role of shopbots on the efficiency of such markets: although the use of shopbots is frequently assumed to induce positive effects ­- by enlarging buyers' information space and so enhance price comparisons - they have a destabilizing role on buyers' and sellers' learning co-evolution. This may result either {{in the emergence of}} a dispersed distribution of prices (commonly noticed by empirical studies) or in some market' crashes. Second, we study the impact of a decrease in search costs. We also point to the existence of a non deterministic relationship between market's efficiency and search costs. This suggests that the use of a priori more efficient matching technologies do not necessarily lead to more efficient outcomes.

However, helping elderly people outside their usual environment is also necessary, to help them to carry out daily tasks like shopping. In this paper we present a person-following <b>shopping</b> cart assistance <b>robot,</b> capable of helping elderly people to carry products in a supermarket.

40|$|In {{the past}} decade the Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) {{has taken on a}} {{significant}} role in the micro-nano imaging field. A number of researchers have been developing computational techniques for determining depth from SEM images. Depth from Automatic Focusing (DFAF) is one of the most popular depth computation techniques used for SEM. However, images captured with SEM may be distorted and suffer from problems of misalignment due to internal and external factors such as interaction between electron beam and surface of sample, lens aberrations, environmental noise and artefacts on the sample. Distortion and misalignment cause computational errors in the depth determination process. Image correction is required to reduce those errors. In this study the proposed image correction procedure is based on Phase Correlation and Log-Polar Transformation (PCLPT), which has been extensively used as a preprocessing stage for many image processing operations. The computation process of PCLPT covers the pixel level interpolation process but it cannot deal with sub-pixel level interpolation errors. Hence, an image filtering stage is necessary to reduce the error. This enhanced PCLPT was also utilised as a pre-processing step for DFAF which is the first contribution of this research. Although DFAF is a simple technique, it was found that the computation involved becomes more complex with image correction. Thus, the priority to develop a less complicated and more robust depth computation technique for SEM is needed. This study proposes an optimised Blind Image Deconvolution BID) technique using the Bees Algorithm for determining depth. The Bees Algorithm (BA) is a swarm-based optimisation technique which mimics the foraging behaviour of honey bees. The algorithm combines exploitative neighbourhood search with explorative global search to enable effective location of the globally optimal solution to a problem. The BA has been applied to several optimisation problems including mechanical design, job <b>shop</b> scheduling and <b>robot</b> path planning. Due to its promise as an effective global optimisation tool,the BA has been chosen for this work. The second contribution of the research consists of two improvements which have been implemented to enhance the BA. The first improvement focuses on an adaptive approach to neighbourhood size changes. The second consists of two main steps. The first step is to define a measurement technique to determine the direction along which promising solutions can be found. This is based on the steepness angle mimicking the direction along which a scout bee performs its figure-of-eight waggle dance during the recruitment of forager bees. The second step is to develop a hybrid algorithm combining BA and a Hill Climbing Algorithm (HCA) based on the threshold value of the steepness angle. The final contribution of this study is to develop a novel technique based on the BA for optimising the blurriness parameter with BID for determining depth. The techniques proposed in this study have enabled depth information in SEM images to be determined with 68. 23...|$|R
