50|$|Iron-deficiency anemia {{is mainly}} caused by blood loss, such as may occur during menses or {{gastrointestinal}} hemorrhage. This often results in a depapilled, atrophic glossitis, giving the tongue a bald and shiny appearance, along with pallor (paleness) of the lips and other mucous membranes a tendency towards recurrent oral ulceration, and cheilosis (swelling of the lips). The appearance of the tongue in iron deficiency anemia {{has been described as}} diffuse or patchy atrophy with tenderness or burning.

5000|$|Some {{systemic}} {{disorders are}} involved in angular cheilitis {{by virtue of their}} association with malabsorption and the creation of nutritional deficiencies described above. Such examples include people with anorexia nervosa. [...] Other disorders may cause lip enlargement (e.g. orofacial granulomatosis), which alters the local anatomy and extenuates the skin folds at the corners of the mouth. More still may be involved because they affect the immune system, allowing normally harmless organisms like Candida to become pathogenic and cause an infection. Xerostomia (dry mouth) is thought to account for about 5% of cases of AC. Xerostomia itself has many possible causes, but commonly the cause may be side effects of medications, or conditions such as Sjögren's syndrome. Conversely, conditions which cause drooling or sialorrhoea (excessive salivation) can cause angular cheilitis by creating a constant wet environment in the corners of the mouth. About 25% of people with Down syndrome appear to have AC. This is due to relative macroglossia, an apparently large tongue in a small mouth, which may constantly stick out of the mouth causing maceration of the corners of the mouth with saliva. Inflammatory bowel diseases (such as Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis) can be associated with angular cheilitis. In Crohn's, it is likely the result of malabsorption and immunosuppressive therapy which gives rise to the sores {{at the corner of the}} mouth. Glucagonomas are rare pancreatic endocrine tumors which secrete glucagon, and cause a syndrome of dermatitis, glucose intolerance, weight loss and anemia. AC is a common feature of glucagonoma syndrome. Infrequently, angular cheilitis may be one of the manifestations of chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis, and sometimes cases of oropharyngeal or esophageal candidiasis may accompany angular cheilitis. Angular cheilitis may be present in human immunodeficiency virus infection, neutropenia, or diabetes. Angular cheilitis is more common in people with eczema because their skin is more sensitive to irritants. Other conditions possibly associated include plasma cell gingivitis, Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome, or <b>sideropenic</b> dysphagia (also called Plummer-Vinson syndrome or Paterson-Brown-Kelly syndrome).|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: <b>Sideropenic</b> anemia {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{nutritional}} disorders in the world. The children are at higher risk of iron deficiency than adults due to their rapid growth during infancy and relatively higher requirements of iron. OBJECTIVE: The objective of our study was to investigate the prevalence of <b>sideropenic</b> anemia in pre-school children and relevant risk factors. METHOD: Study on <b>sideropenic</b> anemia of preschool children was performed in Zaječar Municipality in 2003. Subjects: all children, age 6 - 7 years, who lived in the Zaječar Municipality (554 children). The investigation included: interview of children's parents and laboratory analysis of blood. RESULTS: The frequency of <b>sideropenic</b> anemia was 5. 23 % in tested children (hemoglobin level less than 11 g/dl). Sex and place of residence had no significant impact on hemoglobin concentration in blood of children. Likewise, social status and education of parents had no significant impact on iron deficiency anemia. Higher incidence of infections was found in children with lower hemoglobin concentration in blood (p< 0. 05). It made no difference if children attended the kindergarten or not. Nutrition of children in kindergarten does not correct domestic nutrition, which should be one of its basic roles. CONCLUSION: Since <b>sideropenic</b> anemia gives rise to serious health problems, such as poor cognitive and motor development and behavioral problems, it is important to take corrective measures regarding domestic and social nutrition of children. Therefore, it is necessary to take action in preventing the <b>sideropenic</b> anemia and provide normal growth and development...|$|E

40|$|Introduction. Coeliac disease (CD) is a {{permanent}} intolerance of gluten, i. e. of gliadin and related proteins found in the endosperm of wheat, rye and barley. It is characterized by polygenic predisposition, autoimmune nature, predominantly asymptomatic or atypical clinical course, {{as well as by}} high prevalence in patients with Down's syndrome (DS) and some other diseases. Outline of Cases. We are presenting a girl and two boys, aged 6 - 7 (X= 6. 33) years with DS and CD recognized under the feature of <b>sideropenic</b> anaemia resistant to oral therapy with iron. Beside mental retardation, low stature and the morphological features characteristic of DS, two patients had a congenital heart disease; one ventricular septal defect and the other atrioventricular canal. In two patients, trisomy on the 21 st chromosome pair (trisomy 21) was disclosed in all cells, while one had a mosaic karyotype. All three patients had classical laboratory parameters of <b>sideropenic</b> anaemia: blood Hb 77 - 89 g/l (X= 81. 67), HCT 0. 26 - 0. 29 % (X= 0. 28), MCV 69 - 80 fl (X= 73), MCH 24. 3 - 30 pg (X= 26. 77) and serum iron 2 - 5 μmol/L (X= 4. 0). Beside anaemia and in one patient a mild isolated hypertransaminasemia (AST 67 U/l, ALT 62 U/l), other indicators of CD were not registered in any of the children. In addition, in all three patients, we also detected an increased level of antibodies to tissue transglutaminase (atTG) of IgA class (45 - 88 U/l) so that we performed endoscopic enterobiopsy in order to reliably confirm the diagnosis of CD. In all three patients, the pathohistological finding of the duodenal mucosa specimen showed mild to moderate destructive enteropathy associated with high intraepithelial lymphocyte infiltration, cryptic hyperplasia and lympho-plasmocytic infiltration of the stroma. In all three patients, the treatment with a strict gluten-free diet and iron therapy applied orally for 3 - 4 months resulted in blood count normalization and the correction of sideropenia. Serum level of the atTG-IgA, repeated after a 12 -month diet, was also normal. Conclusion. CD should be taken into consideration in all cases of <b>sideropenic</b> anaemia resistant to iron oral therapy in children with DS. The diagnosis of CD implicates corresponding pathohistological confirmation, while the treatment of <b>sideropenic</b> anaemia and its complications, beside iron preparations, also requires compliance with a gluten-free diet...|$|E

We performed this case-control study to evaluate ROTEM profiles in <b>sideropenic</b> anaemia patients with different degrees of reduction of HCT levels. Forty consecutively referred patients with <b>sideropenic</b> anaemia were enrolled. A group of 40 healthy age and gender matched subjects acted as a control. The influence of HCT on ROTEM was assessed in the study population and in a model of artificially reconstituted blood with modified HCT values. Cases presented significantly increased levels of maximum clot firmness (MCF) as compared to controls (p < 0. 001) mimicking a sort of "hypercoagulable profile". However, thrombin generation tests failed to detect an increase in thrombin generation in cases as compared to controls. A statistically significant inverse linear correlation between HCT and MCF (p < 0. 0001) was found. In addition, ROTEM profiles following "in vitro" manipulation of HCT confirmed the inverse linear correlation between HCT and MCF found in the study population. In conclusion, the increased clot firmness found by ROTEM in anaemic patients is likely {{to be related to the}} method in itself rather than representing a marker of hypercoagulability "in vivo".
