The demo featured the entire first level, Contact, {{as well as the}} <b>sand</b> <b>box</b> editor. On October 26, Crytek announced that the demo would be postponed for at least one more day and was released to the public on October 27. However, on many sites it was provided a day early, and an oversight allowed people to grab the file directly off an EA server earlier than intended.|$|E
50|$|A <b>sand</b> <b>box</b> or sand jack is {{a device}} used for {{removing}} the centering of an arch. Each prop {{is mounted on}} a <b>sand</b> <b>box.</b> After the plug is removed, the sand pours from the box, causing the centering to move downwards, diminishing the pressure from the arch, and enabling to ultimately remove it.|$|E

50|$|The {{boiler barrel}} {{comprised}} 2 shells with {{a diameter of}} 1,450 mm. On the top were two steam domes which were connected by a pipe inside the boiler.

50|$|The {{most obvious}} visual {{differences}} from the Hawthorn Leslie locomotives were the higher side tanks, the less ornate <b>sand</b> <b>boxes</b> {{on top of}} the boiler and the Belpaire firebox hump.

50|$|In {{keeping with}} SAR {{practice}} at the time, they had vacuum train brakes instead of the air brakes which the Class Hd was equipped with.

40|$|We {{describe}} active routing as {{a mechanism}} {{that can be used}} by individual network users, network managers, or network owners. Active routing is related to, and compared with, the current work on label switching. We address several implementation issues including the evolution from our current network structure and the distributed <b>sand</b> <b>boxes.</b> <b>Sand</b> <b>boxes</b> are used to control the resources that the participants acquire and to limit the harm that they can inflict on others. We show how active routing can reduce the need for new standards, such as IPv 6, how it can extend the capabilities of label switching, and how it can be used for restoration, quality of service routing, policy routing, mobility, and receiver controlled routing. Active routing creates a free market system where network providers compete to sell their resources and implementors compete to sell their active routing programs. We establish a framework to quantitatively compare networks and service providers. 1. Introduction [...] ...|$|R

50|$|As built, the <b>sand</b> <b>boxes</b> were {{mounted on}} top of the boiler aft of the dome. Their tenders, also built by Henschel, rode on two four-wheeled bogies and had a coal {{capacity}} of 2 lt 17 lcwt t and a water capacity of 2860 imp gal. The engines were equipped for trains with air brakes, which was not yet in use in South Africa at the time.|$|R
50|$|The engines were {{fitted with}} the Flaman speed recorder, {{of which the}} driving gear was {{connected}} to the right trailing crank pin. The records obtained from these indicators were of considerable value when operating fast passenger services. The <b>sand</b> <b>boxes</b> were arranged in front of the leading coupled wheels and fitted with steam sanding gear, which was later found to be an unnecessary refinement for South African conditions.|$|R
50|$|The park {{saw another}} {{transformation}} in the 1930s {{with the addition of}} new sliding boards, <b>sand</b> <b>boxes,</b> and swing sets installed in the playground. A new softball field with bleachers was constructed. Five years after the park was renamed for Maria Hernandez, it underwent an intensive five-day clean-up and repair campaign. Park workers removed broken glass, debris, and graffiti; repaired and painted benches and fencing; restored the ball field; and cleaned the sewer line.|$|R

50|$|In {{construction}} and civil engineering, a borrow pit, {{also known as}} a <b>sand</b> <b>box,</b> is an area where material (usually soil, gravel or sand) has been dug for use at another location. Borrow pits can be found close to many major construction projects. For example, soil might be excavated to fill an embankment for a highway, clay might be excavated for use in brick-making, gravel to be used for making concrete, etc.|$|E
50|$|Created by the Irving Park District, Avondale Park {{takes its}} name from the {{surrounding}} neighborhood of Avondale. In 1929, the Irving Park District board drew up plans for a 5 acre park. That year an attractive brick fieldhouse designed by Clarence Hatzfeld was built, and lawn, shrubbery, trees, and flowers soon graced Avondale Park's landscape. By the early 1930s, the park included a playfield, separate boys' and girls' playgrounds, a wading pool, a <b>sand</b> <b>box,</b> and tennis courts.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the late}} 1920s/1930s 1500V DC {{began to be}} used on the PO rail system; the {{locomotives}} were converted for 1500V operation at workshops at Vitry-sur-Seine using a Metadyne for traction control. A new pantograph as well as <b>sand</b> <b>boxes</b> were added. After conversion the class were renumbered E.281 to E.293. During {{the second half of}} the units operational life they were used for shunting at depots to the southwest of Paris.|$|R
5000|$|Rolling Green {{has also}} {{always been a}} welcome place for children.

50|$|Magnuson Park {{is home to}} Seattle's biggest playground, the Junior League of Seattle Children's Playground {{which was}} designed, {{developed}} and funded {{through the efforts of}} the Junior League of Seattle, a women's leadership and volunteer organization.

5000|$|Avondale {{was cited}} by the Chicago Tribune as being in the top tier of Chicago's [...] "park poor" [...] neighborhoods. This {{situation}} was further aggravated when Avondale Park was reduced to just over one acre in size during {{the building of the}} Kennedy Expressway, taking over most of its green space, including the park's playfield, separate boys' and girls' playgrounds, a wading pool, a <b>sand</b> <b>box</b> and tennis courts while leaving the fieldhouse designed by Clarence Hatzfeld intact.|$|E
50|$|Some {{modifications}} to the original design were suggested by Vulcan Foundry and subsequently adopted. A number of features, including the mounting of Westinghouse pump on the fireman’s side, stainless steel rather than brass boiler bands, SCOA-P coupled wheels (rather than having traditional solid spokes the SCOA-P spoke is hollow, with a 'U' shaped cross section and are considerably lighter than a conventional spoked wheel) pressed steel <b>sand</b> <b>box</b> and a larger tender giving an increased coal and water capacity.|$|E
40|$|Abstract:- One of the impediments in {{deploying}} active networks is {{its lack}} of support for security. In overlay type of active networks, required security is provided by <b>sand</b> <b>boxing</b> in Java. However, in the active networking approach where packets are processed in the network layer, there is only little support for security. This paper presents a new method of providing security using Public Key Infrastructure (PKI). It can be also used with the Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) of the IP Security (IPSec) protocol...|$|R

50|$|In 1911, {{shortly before}} being amalgamated into the SAR, the NGR placed {{the first two}} of seven 4-6-2T narrow gauge {{locomotives}} in service, built by Kerr, Stuart and Company using the Hawthorn Leslie drawings for the Class NG3. Two more followed in 1913 and another three in 1914, also from Kerr, Stuart. While virtually identical to the Hawthorn Leslie Side Tanks, their boiler pitch had been raised 3 in to make a larger firebox possible. They also had higher side tanks and less ornate <b>sand</b> <b>boxes</b> {{on top of the}} boiler. Between 1928 and 1930 they were all classified as Class NG4.|$|R
