5|$|In November 1940 Stalin sent Molotov to Berlin to meet Ribbentrop and Adolf Hitler. In January 1941, the British Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden visited Turkey in {{an attempt}} to get the Turks to enter the war on the Allies' side. Though the purpose of Eden's visit was anti-German rather than anti-Soviet, Molotov assumed otherwise, and in a <b>series</b> <b>of</b> <b>conversations</b> with the Italian Ambassador Augusto Rosso, Molotov claimed that the Soviet Union would soon be faced with an Anglo-Turkish {{invasion}} of the Crimea. The British historian D.C. Watt argued that on the basis of Molotov's statements to Rosso, it would appear that in early 1941, Stalin and Molotov viewed Britain rather than Germany as the principal threat.|$|E

25|$|Elizabeth Montagu {{published}} {{two works}} in her lifetime. George Lyttleton in 1760 encouraged Elizabeth to write Dialogues of the Dead, and she contributed three sections {{to the work}} anonymously. (Her authorship is testified elsewhere.) It consists of a <b>series</b> <b>of</b> <b>conversations</b> between {{the living and the}} illustrious dead, and works as a satire of 18th century vanity and manners. In 1769, she published An Essay on the Writings and Genius of Shakespear. In it, she proclaims Shakespeare to be the greatest English poet, and in fact the greatest poet of any nation. She also attacks Samuel Johnson's Preface to Shakespeare from 1765 for not having gone on to praise Shakespeare's plays enough. While Johnson had dealt with text, history, and the circumstances of editing, Montagu wrote instead about the characters, plots, and beauties of the verse in Shakespeare and saw in him a championing of all things inherently English. When the book was initially published anonymously, it was thought to be by Joseph Warton, but by 1777 her name appeared on the title page. Johnson, for his part, was estranged from Montagu at this point.|$|E

2500|$|During the 1970s, a Coptic papyrus codex (book) was {{discovered}} near Beni Masah, Egypt {{which appeared to}} be a 3rd- or 4th-century-AD copy of a 2nd-century original, relating a <b>series</b> <b>of</b> <b>conversations</b> in which Jesus and Judas interact and discuss the nature of the universe from a Gnostic viewpoint. The discovery was given dramatic international exposure in April 2006 when the US National Geographic magazine published a feature article entitled [...] "The Gospel of Judas" [...] with images of the fragile codex and analytical commentary by relevant experts and interested observers (but not a comprehensive translation). The article's introduction stated: [...] "An ancient text lost for 1,700 years says Christ's betrayer was his truest disciple." [...] The article points to some evidence that the original document was extant in the 2nd century: [...] "Around A.D. 180, Irenaeus, Bishop of Lyon in what was then Roman Gaul, wrote a massive treatise called Against Heresies [...] a 'fictitious history,' which 'they style the Gospel of Judas.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|After this development, Fernós and Muñoz held a <b>series</b> <b>of</b> <b>conversations</b> at Trujillo Alto, {{where their}} {{conflicting}} ideologies began to clash. These combined with strategic differences between both leaders, which {{only served to}} hindrance the [...] "perfection of the association" [...] as originally conceived. Matters were further complicated by the growing involvement of Muñoz's legal aides, José Trias Monge and Abe Fortas, who began taking over the legal aspect of the ideological definition. Fernós was affected by these developments, but nonetheless continued his pursuit to reach the full constitutional development of Puerto Rico's status through its sovereignty. Between 1954 and 1960, Fernós and several other figures realized a series if studies that intended {{to create a new}} project that would allow the Commonwealth to reach the development that he believed in. However, his involvement was often limited to his visits to Puerto Rico. In 1956, the PPD vowed to retake the status debate in order to [...] "perfect" [...] the Commonwealth. On March 23, 1959, H.R. 5926, colloquially known as the Fernós Project, was presented before the US House of Representatives as requested. After a sister project was [...] presented in the US Senate by James E. Murray, the collective bills became known as the Fernós-Murray Project. This initiative intended to replace the Federal Relation Statute of Public Law 600 with a series of [...] "association articles" [...] and requested Congress {{to make it clear that}} Puerto Rico was no longer a territory or possession of the United States. The Fernós-Murray Project also included the multilateral economy, as stated in the original concept of the Estado Libre Asociado. Another straggled proposal that it intended to revive was the exclusion of Puerto Rico from the Cabotage laws.|$|E

2500|$|Like Cushing, Lee also {{appeared}} in horror films for other companies during the 20-year period from 1957 to 1977. Other films in which Lee performed include the series of Fu Manchu films made between 1965 and 1969, in which he starred as the villain in heavy oriental make-up; I, Monster (1971), in which he played Jekyll and Hyde; The Creeping Flesh (1972); and his personal favourite, The Wicker Man (1973), in which he played Lord Summerisle. Lee wanted to break free of his image as Dracula and take on more interesting acting roles. He met with screenwriter Anthony Shaffer, and they agreed to work together. Film director Robin Hardy and British Lion head Peter Snell {{became involved in the}} project. Shaffer had a <b>series</b> <b>of</b> <b>conversations</b> with Hardy, and the two decided that {{it would be fun to}} make a horror film centering on [...] "old religion", in sharp contrast to the popular Hammer films of the day. Shaffer read the David Pinner novel Ritual, in which a devout Christian policeman is called to investigate what appears to be the ritual murder of a young girl in a rural village, and decided that it would serve well as the source material for the project. Shaffer and Lee paid Pinner £15,000 for the rights to the novel, and Schaffer set to work on the screenplay. However, he soon decided that a direct adaptation would not work well, and began to craft a new story, using only the basic outline of the novel. Lee was so keen to get the film made, he gave his services for free, as the budget was so small. He would later refer to the film as the best he had ever made.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{we present}} a {{computational}} approach to understanding and augmenting the conversational knowledge process that is a collective activity for knowledge creation, management, and application, where conversational communications are used as a primary means of interaction among participating agents. The key idea is conversation quantization, a technique of approximating a continuous flow <b>of</b> <b>conversation</b> by a <b>series</b> <b>of</b> <b>conversation</b> quanta that represent points <b>of</b> the discourse. <b>Conversation</b> quantization enables to implement a rather robust conversation system by basing it on a large amount <b>of</b> <b>conversation</b> quanta collected from the real world. We make clear the nature <b>of</b> <b>conversation</b> quanta by extracting them from practical situations by hand. Based on the preliminary experiments, {{we present a}} method for automatic extraction of the first approximation <b>of</b> <b>conversation</b> quanta. To support the conversational knowledge process, we have developed the Sustainable Knowledge Globe (SKG) that can manage conversation quanta by switching an overlooking sphere view and a conversational agent in an immersive view. We discuss effectiveness of SKG based on an experiment...|$|R
