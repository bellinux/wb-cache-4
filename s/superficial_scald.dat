50|$|Granny Smith is {{much more}} easily {{preserved}} in storage than other apples, a factor which has greatly contributed to its success in export markets. Its long storage life {{has been attributed to}} its fairly low levels of ethylene production, and in the right conditions Granny Smiths can be stored without loss of quality for as long as a year. This cultivar needs fewer winter chill hours and a longer season to mature the fruit, so it is favoured for the milder areas of the apple growing regions. However, they are susceptible to <b>superficial</b> <b>scald</b> and bitter pit. <b>Superficial</b> <b>scald</b> may be controlled by treatment with diphenylamine before storage. It can also be controlled with low-oxygen storage. Pit can be controlled with calcium sprays during the growing season and with postharvest calcium dips.|$|E
40|$|<b>Superficial</b> <b>scald</b> is a postharvest {{physiological}} disorder of apples characterized by browning of apple skin during prolonged storage. It has been hypothesized that conjugated triene hydroperoxides (CTH) attack cell membranes causing membrane perturbation and {{the manifestation of}} the disorder. The {{purpose of this study}} was to compare the common synthetic antioxidant diphenylamine (DPA) treatment with postharvest vapour treatments for <b>superficial</b> <b>scald</b> prevention. Apples cv. ‚Granny Smith™ were treated with ethanol, methanol and »apple aroma« vapours. The influence of these treatments on scald susceptibility and sensorial quality of apples was examined. The ethanol treatments were effective in <b>superficial</b> <b>scald</b> prevention but they caused a high incidence of internal browning after two months of storage. The 10 day treatments at 20 °C developed very pronounced internal browning after storage. The aroma treatment was the least effective in apple scald prevention but no internal disorders appeared after storage. Apples treated with methanol at 20 °C retain a great deal of their initial green colour. Vapour treatments demonstrated to be potential methods for scald prevention. Additional research is needed to minimise the internal disorders of treated fruit. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{adenoviral}} {{transfer of}} therapeutic genes into epidermal and dermal cells {{is an interesting}} approach to treat skin diseases and to promote wound healing. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the in vitro and in vivo transfection efficacy in skin and burn wounds after adenoviral gene delivery. Primary keratinocytes (HKC), fibroblasts (HFB), and HaCaT cells were transfected using different concentrations of an adenoviral construct (eGFP). Transfection efficiency and cytotoxicity was determined up to 30 days. Expression was quantified by FACS analysis and fluorimeter. Cytotoxicity was measured using the trypan blue exclusion method. 45 male Sprague Dawley rats received 2 × 108 pfu of Ad 5 -CMV-LacZ or carrier control intradermally into either <b>superficial</b> partial thickness <b>scald</b> burn or unburned skin. Animals were euthanized after 48 h, 7 or 14 days posttreatment. Transgene expression was assessed using immunohistochemistry and bioluminescent assays. The highest transfection rate was observed 48 h posttransfection: 79 % for HKC, 70 % for HFB, and 48 % for HaCaT. The eGFP expression was detectable in all groups over 30 days (P > 0. 05). Cytotoxic effects of the adenoviral vector were observed for HFB after 10 days and HaCaT after 30 days. Reporter gene expression in vivo was significantly higher in burned skin compared with unburned skin (P = 0, 004). Gene expression decreases from 2 to 7 days with no significant expression after 14 days. This study demonstrates that effective adenoviral-mediated gene transfer of epidermal primary cells and cell-lines is feasible. Ex vivo gene transfer in epithelial cells might have promise for the use in severely burned patients who receive autologous keratinocyte sheets. Transient cutaneous gene delivery in burn wounds using adenoviral vectors causes significant concentrations in the wound tissue for at least 1 week.

Fruit were harvested before the optimal maturation stage and cold stored under normal atmosphere for 7 months (NA: 0 degrees C, 90 - 95 % RH) and 2 in controlled atmosphere (CA: 0 degrees C, 90 - 95 % RH, 1. 5 kPaO(2) + 0. 5 kPa CO 2) (T), or harvested at the optimal maturation stage and cold stored for 9 months under CA (C). Then, they were transferred to shelf-life conditions (22 +/- 2 degrees C, 70 % RH) and followed for 7 d. Chla fluorescence, scald index (SI), ripening attributes, alpha-farnesene, conjugated trienols, and photosynthetic pigments were determined for each pear in both groups. Conditions chosen before shelf-life did not prevent the subsequent ripening of any fruit, but changed dramatically the <b>superficial</b> <b>scald</b> development pattern: in C fruit, the disorder developed progressively during shelf-life, whereas in T fruit, it peaked during storage. C fruit exhibited a significant negative correlation (R=- 0. 65; p< 0. 05) between Fv/Fm and scald development, but not with ripening (R=- 0. 15; p< 0. 05). As expected, the opposite was observed in T fruit, in which only a low, positive, yet significant correlation was found between Fv/Fm and ripening (R= 0. 44; p< 0. 05). The multiple regression approach using Fv/Fm and other Chla fluorescence parameters produced an equation from which we calculated the 'predicted' scald index in C fruit. This correlated clearly (R= 0. 73; p< 0. 05) with the real values visually assessed.

After 4 and 6 months storage, fruit were {{held up to}} 7 d at 20 °C. Skin colour, firmness and EP were measured during shelf life and the incidence of disorders after 7 d. 1 -MCP treatment drastically reduced EP, which began to recover after 7 d at 20 °C, except for DCA stored pears. In control fruit, NA stored pears showed the highest EP. 1 -MCP treated fruit were the greenest {{at the end of}} shelf-life, especially after CA and DCA.

40|$|The {{ripening}} {{stage of}} apple fruits at harvest {{is the main}} factor influencing fruit quality during the cold storage period that lasts several months and give rise to physiological disorders in fruits of susceptible cultivars. In particular, <b>superficial</b> <b>scald</b> is connected to α-farnesene oxidation, leading to fruit browning. Therefore, {{the assessment of the}} optimal ripening stage at harvest is considered to be crucial to control the overall quality, the length of storage life and the scald incidence. However, the maturity indexes traditionally used in the horticultural practice do not strictly correlate with fruit maturity, and do not account for the variability occurring in the field. Hence, the present work focused on the determination of apple fruit ripening with the use of an innovative, non-destructive device, the DA-meter. The study was conducted on ‘Granny Smith’ and ‘Pink Lady’ cultivars, which differ in scald susceptibility. Pre- and post- harvest ripening behavior of the fruits was studied, and the influence of ripening stage and treatments with 1 -MCP were evaluated in relation to scald development and related metabolites. IAD was shown to be a reliable indicator of apple ripening, allowing cultivar-specific predictions of the optimal harvest time in different growing seasons. IAD may also be employed to segregate apple fruits in maturity classes, requiring different storage conditions to control flesh firmness reduction and scald incidence. Moreover, 1 -MCP application is extremely effective in reducing <b>superficial</b> <b>scald,</b> and its effect is influenced by fruit ripening stage reached at harvest. However, the relation between ethylene and α-farnesene was not entirely elucidated. Thus, ethylene can be involved in other oxidative processes associated with scald besides α-farnesene regulation...|$|E

Levels of conjugated trienols and -farnesene increased during the first 26 weeks in storage, remaining constant thereafter. During shelf-life, conjugated trienols were higher in fruits stored in air at 2. 5 ?. Internal browning developed in shelf-life after 26 weeks at 2. 5 ?.

The retention of firmness during shelf-life of 1 -methylcyclopropene-treated Rocha' pear can be overcome by elevating the storage temperature from 0 ? to 2. 5 ?, but CA is a required complement to avoid excessive softening after long-term storage. The ratio carotenoid/chlorophyll increased during storage and shelf-life, as plastids senesced. CA reduced the rate of chlorophyll loss during the first 14 weeks in storage, but its effect was reduced afterwards.

However, they cannot be stored for long term in normal atmosphere (NA), because after 3 - 4 months they loose the ripening ability, while in controlled atmosphere (CA) they can be subject to senescent (soft) scald. ‘Abbé Fétel’ pears picked at two times were cooled to - 0. 5 °C at different speeds (normal: immediately put at - 0. 5 °C; slow: from 8 °C decreasing 1 °C d- 1), while monitored with fluorescence sensors (HarvestWatch™). Cooled fruit were treated with 300 ppb 1 -MCP and stored in normal air or in controlled atmosphere (2 % O 2 + 0. 7 % CO 2) at - 0. 5 °C. After 4 and 6 months storage, fruit were analyzed immediately after storage and after 9 d of shelf life at 20 °C for mass, skin colour and firmness. Fruit skin was extracted with hexane for analysis of a-farnesene and conjugated trienes (CTs) by spectrophotometric method. Cooling speed affected fruit fluorescence (Fa) and the effect was maintained throughout the storage. Fa rapidly increased both due to the fast decrease of temperature and to the decrease of oxygen partial pressure. During storage in CA and NA, Fa decreased more and earlier in fruit cooled slowly than in fruit exposed to normal cooling. In NA the decrease was gradual and steady, while in CA a quick decrease of Fa occurred after 4 (slow cooling) or 5 months storage (normal cooling). Among storage disorders, <b>superficial</b> <b>scald</b> was remarkably influenced by storage atmosphere, being almost fully controlled in CA.

"Golab Kohanz" apples treated with 1 -MCP showed improved fruit firmness, titratable acidity (TA), and total soluble solid after 147 days at 2 ºC, compared to the control non-treated fruits. Also, treatment with 1 -MCP significantly reduced the incidence of <b>superficial</b> <b>scald</b> in "Golab Kohanze". In general, 1 -MCP-treated apples delay ripening during storing in cold room and increased shelf life. Overall, the results indicate that 1 -MCP has tremendous potential for maintaining apple quality during storage and post storage...|$|E
40|$|Ethylene is a {{plant hormone}} that regulates {{climacteric}} fruit ripening. Ethylene gas diffuses from fruit cells and tissues and can affect other fruit. Low temperature and controlled atmospheres (CA) with low oxygen and high carbon dioxide reduce ethylene production and action, {{as well as}} slowing ripening and loss of optimum fruit quality. MCP (1 -methylcyclopropene) is a new tool {{for the management of}} ethylene action/production by climacteric fruit including apple. This compound is an ethylene action inhibitor that prevents plant tissues from responding to ethylene by combining with ethylene receptors (Sisler and Blankenship, 1996; Sisler and Serek, 1997). MCP gas applied at harvest delays ripening, improves storage life and prevents <b>superficial</b> <b>scald</b> and other physiological disorders in many apple cultivars including Delicious, Granny Smith, Fuji and Gala (Fan et al., 1999 a, Fan et al., 1999 b). For many cultivars, treatment with MCP is most effective when fruit are harvested at CA maturity and MCP is applied soon after harvest. Fuji and Braeburn apples fruit are susceptible to internal browning caused by exposure to high CO 2 during storage (Elgar, et al., 1998, Argenta et al., 2000). Factors contributing to development of CO 2 injury in these cultivars include maturity at harvest, watercore, CO 2 concentration in storage, and the duration between harvest and imposition of CA conditions...|$|E
40|$|Apple {{storage in}} {{controlled}} atmosphere (CA) {{can increase the}} marketing window of apples {{but at the same time}} it is an expensive practice and on the basis of cultivar, season, harvest time and storage condition (low O 2, low/high CO 2, low temperature) apples can develop different physiological disorders. It appears as a darkened area due to necrosis of hypodermal cells especially in Granny Smith and Red Delicious cultivars. <b>Superficial</b> <b>scald</b> annually causes the major economic loss to apple growers worldwide. It can arise after a relative long period (2 - 4 months) of cold storage with an increase in severity when apples are removed from storage and are leaved at room temperature (ca 7 dd). It is also influenced by different preharvest factors including fruit ripening at harvest, environmental conditions during growth, ethylene action or fruit mineral content. <b>Superficial</b> <b>scald</b> is associated with the accumulation of volatiles, in particular of α-farnesene, the biosynthesis of which is influenced by ethylene. This compound can be oxidized along with the storage period to a group of molecules called conjugated trienols. The accumulation of these oxidative products can induce metabolic dysfunction and cell death. Different strategies are provided to successfully inhibit scald development. The most common techniques in use combine storage in control atmosphere (CA) with treatments with the antioxidant diphenylamine (DPA), or with 1 -methylcyclopropene (1 -MCP), an inhibitor of ethylene perception and the most effective molecule to control scald, or application of an initial low oxygen stress (ILOS), followed by CA storage. In 2011 the use of DPA has been banned in Europe for health concerns, 1 -MCP is effective but has high costs, while ILOS is difficult to apply requiring more research for its optimization and apples cannot be stored for long periods. The identification of the molecular mechanism involved in the regulation of <b>superficial</b> <b>scald</b> development may allow the possibility to predict at harvest, before CA storage, which apple batches may probably develop the disorder allowing rational storage strategies with significant economic gains. The aim of this work was to provide a preliminary characterization of the molecular factors putatively involved in scald development associated with ethylene action and ROS metabolism, two actors that seem to have a role in scald occurrence, in peels of apples, cv Granny Smith, treated or not with 1 -MCP or DPA and stored in controlled atmosphere for 1, 3 or 6 months. For this purpose gene families involved in the maintenance of ROS homeostasis were identified in the apple genome. In particular ROPs and ancillary proteins ROP-GEFs, -GAPs and -GDIs, RBOHs (NADPH oxidases involved in the generation of ROS at the apoplastic levels) and PLsDα (involved togheter with ROPs in the regulation of RBOHs activity) were identified. It is known in fact that Arabidopsis cells during oxygen deprivation activate a mechanism controlled by negative feedback regulation which involves ROPs, ROP-GAPs, RBOH and H 2 O 2, and it is termed the ROP-GAP rheostat. Expression analyses on the identified genes evaluated by real-time PCR allowed the identification of 2 ROPs, 7 ROP-GEFs, 8 ROP-GAPs, 2 RBOHs and 2 PLsDα de-repressed in samples treated with 1 -MCP and in most cases with a minor extent, by DPA treatment. The expression of the same genes was evaluated by qPCR on peels of apples subjected to short-time treatments with a saturating concentration (100 ppm) of ethylene for 4 and 24 hours showing that ethylene negatively regulates many of the apple ROP-GAP rheostat genes including RBOHs and PLsDα. Then analyses of content of malonyldialdehyde, a marker of lipid peroxidation, H 2 O 2, ascorbate and glutathione, suggested that cells of untreated apples, which showed scald symptoms in the 97 % of cases after 6 months of storage, perceived the oxidative stress associated with the loss of H 2 O 2 homeostasis. On the contrary samples treated with 1 -MCP showed higher levels of H 2 O 2 thus maintaining the H 2 O 2 homeostasis. This finding was further confirmed by the up-regulation of transcription of alcohol dehydrogenase, a marker of H 2 O 2 response. The subcellular localization of H 2 O 2, obtained by means of cerium chloride reaction through transmission electron microscopy, revealed higher levels of H 2 O 2 in the apoplast of apple peels treated with 1 -MCP compared to control ones, confirming a role of RBOHs and their regulative system on control of apoplastic H 2 O 2 homeostasis. Finally RNA-seq analyses on the same samples, allowed to construct an heatmap that highlighted in samples treated with 1 -MCP a co-regulation between genes of the ROP-GAP rheostat and of the ROP system, and genes belonging to the ascorbate, dehydroascorbate reductase and thioredoxin families, involved respectively in the detoxification or protection of thiol groups by ROS action. These results demonstrate for the first time that during cold stress ethylene induces in apples that develop scald a disruption of ROS homeostasis caused by the loss of ROP-GAP rheostat and RBOHs regulation, thus provoking a different transcriptional response of genes involved in ROS detoxification...|$|E

Fruit was harvested from a commercial orchard in Chile, 182 and 189 days after full bloom and received the following treatments: DPA (2, 000 ppm); 1 -MCP (1. 2 ppm) and control (no treatment). All fruit was stored for 4 or 6 months at 0 °C. A completely randomized factorial design was used (2 harvest dates by 3 postharvest treatments). Monthly measurements were made on maturity indices, ethylene production rate (EPR), scald related compounds [α-farnesene (AF), conjugated trienes (CT), total anti-oxidants (AO) ], and cell membrane stability. Following 4 and 6 months of storage, plus 7 days at 20 °C, scald was evaluated. After 6 months, DPA-treated fruit, from both harvests, showed similar firmness, EPR and AO, compared to the control. However, AF and CT were lower, and cell membrane stability higher. Conversely, 1 -MCP-treated fruit showed a noticeable EPR suppression and AF inhibition, along with higher firmness, lower CT and AO, compared to the control and DPA. Furthermore, cell membrane stability was superior {{to that of the}} control and {{similar to that of the}} DPA. Treated fruit (DPA and 1 -MCP) showed an important reduction in scald compared to the control.

40|$|A novel type {{of dynamic}} {{controlled}} atmosphere storage (RQ-DCA) was developed to control O 2 and CO 2 partial pressures in storage containers for apple fruit automatically, based on measurements of the stored fruit respiratory quotient (RQ). ‘Granny Smith’ apples were stored under RQ-DCA and the effect on fruit quality immediately after storage as well as during subsequent shelf life was investigated and compared {{to the effect of}} regular CA and regular CA storage with 1 -MCP (SmartFreshSM) treatment. The RQ-DCA system managed to control O 2 and CO 2 partial pressures in the storage container in an autonomous way. During RQ-DCA storage, the RQ breakpoint was found to vary between 0. 25 kPa and 0. 4 kPa O 2. However, difficulties to obtain a reliable RQ measurement were observed at very low oxygen levels due to reduced fruit respiration and when the pressure of the storage container increases due to increased atmosphere pressure due to leakiness of the storage container. <b>Superficial</b> <b>scald</b> was found to be controlled almost completely during storage with RQ-DCA and the effect remained visible during up to 14 days of shelf life. Magness-Taylor firmness and skin color (hue[*]angle) were found to be significantly higher after RQ-DCA storage compared to conventional CA storage and were comparable to these of fruit stored with regular CA after 1 -MCP treatment up to 7 days of shelf life at 18 °C.

40|$|The {{effects of}} postharvest {{application}} of 1 -MCP and air storage {{in the presence}} of low O 3 concentration on 'Red Chief' apple fruit quality were studied during prolonged storage. Apple fruit were harvested from two commercial orchards from 300 and 700 m elevation in the Zagora region, central Greece, during September 2012. The next day, the fruit were treated or not with 600 nl L- 1 1 -MCP and stored at two commercial rooms at 0 °C (90 - 95 % RH) with or without 50 - 60 nl L- 1 O 3. Apple quality was evaluated at harvest and after 2. 5, 5 and 7. 5 months immediately after storage and after 7 days shelf-life (20 - 22 °C, 50 - 60 % RH). Quality evaluation included skin color, flesh firmness, juice soluble solids content (SSC) and titratable acidity, and <b>superficial</b> <b>scald</b> incidence. Apples from the orchard at high elevation had darker redder skin color were firmer, and had lower SSC, acidity and scald incidence at harvest and during storage, than the apples from the orchard at low elevation. Fruit treated with 1 -MCP kept their high quality with minor scald incidence and firmness loss even after 7. 5 months cold storage in the presence or not of O 3. Fruit stored with low O 3 without 1 -MCP treatment at harvest were of similar quality to control fruit, but had higher scald incidence. It is concluded that 1 -MCP treatment at harvest, satisfactorily maintained apple fruit quality without the addition of O 3 in air cold storage, while fruit not treated with 1 -MCP should not be stored {{in the presence of}} low O 3 concentration...|$|E

Control fruit stored at - 1. 1 °C ripened and developed significant scald within 7 d at 20 °C following 3 - 5 months of storage. While 1 -MCP@- 1. 1 °C fruit did not develop ripening capacity due to extremely low internal ethylene concentration (IEC) and ethylene production rate for 8 months, 1 -MCP@ 1. 1 °C fruit produced significant amounts of IEC during storage and developed ripening capacity with relatively low levels of scald within 7 d at 20 °C following 6 - 8 months of storage. 1 -MCP@ 2. 2 °C fruit lost quality quickly during storage. Compared to the control, the expression of ethylene synthesis (PcACS 1, PcACO 1) and signal (PcETR 1, PcETR 2) genes was stable at extremely low levels in 1 -MCP@- 1. 1 °C fruit. In contrast, they increased expression after 4 or 5 months of storage in 1 -MCP@ 1. 1 °C fruit.

40|$|The {{discovery}} of 1 -methylcyclopropene (1 -MCP) as an inhibitor of ethylene action has provided {{an important tool}} in understanding fruit ripening physiology {{as shown by the}} huge amount of 1 -MCPtargeted research carried out particularly, although not exclusively, in postharvest science. It has been clearly demonstrated that 1 -MCP is able to improve the handling procedures and storage life of a number of commodities. In fact, 1 -MCP can reduce ethylene biosynthesis, respiration, softening color changes, aroma production, and the occurrence of physiological disorders and stress responses. These effects are related to the interference of 1 -MCP on the ethylene receptor functioning (1 -MCP-receptor binding is irreversible) and for some of them in their transcription rate and protein stability. However, the efficacy of this olefin strongly depends upon the concentration used, the species and variety, storage condition and duration, and maturity of the fruit before the 1 -MCP application. A marked effect of 1 -MCP occurs in climacteric fruit, although studies carried out in nonclimacteric fruit demonstrates that this olefin can also alter specific ripening processes in these fruit types. The research results obtained by applying 1 -MCP confirms the very well-known ethylene-dependent ripening processes as well as allowed tthe identification of previously unrecognized responses to ethylene. Molecular studies performed on 1 -MCP-treated fruit have provided new insights into the role of ethylene in the regulation (mainly at the transcriptional and, to a lesser extent, at the translational level) of genes involved in ripening processes such as cell wall metabolism, and pigment and aromatic compound biosynthesis, as well as the signal transduction pathway of the gaseous hormone. Postharvest use of 1 -MCP has improved our understanding of ethylene effects on the development of physiological disorders (e. g. <b>superficial</b> <b>scald,</b> internal breakdown) and stress responses (e. g. chilling injury and pathogen attack). This extensive information base will be extremely useful in the future development of innovative and more efficient postharvest strategies where the effect of 1 -MCP could be enhanced by the concomitant applications of other storage technologies...|$|E

Fruit firmness and polygalacturonase inhibitor activity correlated significantly with percent decay. The relationship between phenolics and fruit decay was not significant. The location of fruits on the trees had no effect on decay, firmness, fungal radial growth, fungal spore germination, polygalacturonase inhibitor activity and amount of phenolics. Late maturing 'd' Anjou' pear fruits were more susceptible to storage decay than the pre- and optimum mature fruits.
