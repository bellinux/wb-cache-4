Thus, the ellipsoid changes similarly to the way it does with age; however, with decreasing metallicity, the rotational velocity about the Galactic center monotonically increases, rather than decreases(!). Moreover, the power-law indices for the age dependences of the axes depend on the metallicity, and display a maximum near [Fe/H]=- 0. 1. The age dependences of all the velocity-ellipsoid parameters for stars with equal metallicity are roughly the same. It is proposed that the appearance of a metallicity dependence of the velocity ellipsoids for thin-disk stars is most likely due to the radial migration of stars.

The ice target composition ranged from pure water ice, to solutions containing 50 % ammonia and 50 % water by weight. Results for crater depth, diameter, volume and depth/diameter ratio are given. The results showed that the presence of ammonia in the ice had a very strong influence on crater diameter and morphology. It was found that with only a 10 % concentration of ammonia, crater diameter significantly decreased, and then at greater concentrations became independent of ammonia content. Crater depth was independent of the presence of ammonia in the ice, and the crater volume appeared to decrease as ammonia concentration increased. Between ammonia concentrations of 10 and 20 % crater morphology visibly changed from wide shallow craters with a deeper central pit to craters with a smoothly increasing depth from the crater rim to centre. Thus, a small amount of ammonia within a water ice surface may have a major effect on crater morphology...|$|R

40|$|Lemaitre-Tolman-Bondi {{models as}} {{specific}} spherically symmetric solutions {{of general relativity}} simplify in their reduced form some of the mathematical ingredients of black hole or cosmological applications. The conditions imposed in addition to <b>spherical</b> symmetry <b>turn</b> out to take a simple form at the kinematical level of loop quantum gravity, which allows a discussion of their implications at the quantum level. Moreover, the spherically symmetric setting of inhomogeneity illustrates several non-trivial properties of lattice refinements of discrete quantum gravity. Nevertheless, the situation at the dynamical level is quite non-trivial and thus provides insights to the anomaly problem. At an effective level, consistent versions of the dynamics are presented which implement the conditions together with the dynamical constraints of gravity in an anomaly-free manner. These are then used for analytical as well as numerical investigations of the fate of classical singularities, including non-spacelike ones, as they generically develop in these models. None of the corrections used here resolve those singularities by regular effective geometries. However, there are numerical indications that the collapse ends in a tamer shell-crossing singularity prior {{to the formation of}} central singularities for mass functions giving a regular conserved mass density. Moreover, we find quantum gravitational obstructions to the existence of exactly homogeneous solutions within this class of models.

40|$|The spatial {{dependence}} of total column ozone varies strongly with latitude, so that homogeneous models (invariant to all rotations) are clearly unsuitable.

Using TOMS (Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer) measurements of total column ozone over a six-day period, this work investigates the modeling of axially symmetric processes on the sphere using expansions in <b>spherical</b> harmonics.

40|$|The {{severe and}} {{continuous}} contamination of coastal sea waters by organotin compounds (OTC) used as biocides in antifouling paints has led {{in the last}} decade to the worldwide rising of several studies about the effects induced by TBT and its degradation products on various marine organisms. As a part of an environmental biomonitoring program our studies on tunicates aim to evaluate the real impact of OTC on the benthonic fauna in the Venice Lagoon ecosystem. Previously, we demonstrated the in vitro immunotoxicity of OTC at low concentrations in the blood cells of the colonial ascidian Botryllus schlosseri. In this species, this effect of OTC does not cause any cytolysis and/or mortality of the hemocytes, although irreversible and significant decreases in yeast-phagocytosis, respiratory burst, and calmodulin-Ca 2 +-ATPase activity occur. However, this enzyme activity is recoverable {{in the presence of a}} calmodulin excess in the medium. In those experiments we always observed a considerable change in the shape of the hemocytes, which <b>turned</b> <b>spherical,</b> amoebocytes withdrawing their long pseudopodia. The number of cultured hemocytes never decreased showing that probable alteration of cell components by OTC did not interfere with the ability of the cells to attach to substrate through the adhesion plaques. In this research the toxic effects on cytoskeleton were evaluated immunocytochemically using anti-actin and anti-tubulin monoclonal antibodies on cultured hemocytes previously treated with 10 µM TBT for 60 min at 25 °C. The samples were specifically prepared for observations under light, confocal fluorescence, and electron transmission microscopes, according to the standard protocols. Results obtained give for the first time demonstration that TBT is able to strongly interact with the polymerization and the organization of microfilaments and microtubules. The decrease in yeast-phagocytosis may be related to a direct mechanism of action of TBT on cytoskeleton through an alteration of calcium homeostasis. This effect would induce an excess of intracellular Ca 2 + accumulation which may cause an internal disorganization of the cytoskeleton proteins, externally appearing as a shape change of the hemocytes. Calmodulin can partially restore the cytoskeleton architecture. Indeed, these severe alterations inhibit phagocytosis at a very early stage, i. e., from the stage of particle adhesion, whereas the toxic effects on the oxidative phosphorylation of mitochondria, i. e., on the respiratory burst of phagocytes, take place later...|$|R
40|$|For {{computational}} reasons, the {{spline interpolation}} of the Earth's gravitational potential is usually {{done in a}} spherical framework. In this work, however, we investigate a spline method {{with respect to the}} real Earth. We are concerned with developing the real Earth oriented strategies and methods for the Earth's gravitational potential determination. For this purpose we introduce the reproducing kernel Hilbert space of Newton potentials on and outside given regular surface with reproducing kernel defined as a Newton integral over it's interior. We first give an overview of thus far achieved results considering approximations on regular surfaces using surface potentials (Chapter 3). The main results are contained in the fourth chapter where we give a closer look to the Earth's gravitational potential, the Newton potentials and their characterization in the interior and the exterior space of the Earth. We also present the L 2 -decomposition for regions in R 3 in terms of distributions, as a main strategy to impose the Hilbert space structure on the space of potentials on and outside a given regular surface. The properties of the Newton potential operator are investigated in relation to the closed subspace of harmonic density functions. After these preparations, in the fifth chapter we are able to construct the reproducing kernel Hilbert space of Newton potentials on and outside a regular surface. The spline formulation for the solution to interpolation problems, corresponding to a set of bounded linear functionals is given, and corresponding convergence theorems are proven. The spline formulation reflects the specifics of the Earth's surface, due to the representation of the reproducing kernel (of the solution space) as a Newton integral over the inner space of the Earth. Moreover, the approximating potential functions have the same domain of harmonicity as the actual Earth's gravitational potential, i. e., they are harmonic outside and continuous on the Earth's surface. This is a step forward in comparison to the spherical harmonic spline formulation involving functions harmonic down to the Runge sphere. The sixth chapter deals with the representation of the used kernel in the <b>spherical</b> case. It <b>turns</b> out {{that in the case of}} the spherical Earth, this kernel can be considered a kind of generalization to spherically oriented kernels, such as Abel-Poisson or the singularity kernel. We also investigate the existence of the closed expression of the kernel. However, at this point it remains to be unknown to us. So, in Chapter 7, we are led to consider certain discretization methods for integrals over regions in R 3, in connection to theory of the multidimensional Euler summation formula for the Laplace operator. We discretize the Newton integral over the real Earth (representing the spline function) and give a priori estimates for approximate integration when using this discretization method. The last chapter summarizes our results and gives some directions for the future research...|$|R
40|$|Since the {{development}} of the exponential sinusoid for low-thrust trajectory design by Petropoulos and Longuski [2004], more shape-based methods have emerged that ease up the work of a mission analyst. These methods are the ideal tool to generate a quick and almost complete overview of a large search space and are useful for producing first estimate trajectories. The spherical shaping method by Novak [2012] {{is one of the more}} recently developed methods capable of shaping a transfer in three dimensions, satisfying constraints on initial and final position and velocity, and capable of satisfying a time of flight constraint; all at the same time. This makes it a particularly interesting method for application to rendezvous missions. In this thesis, the spherical shaping method will be used to generate first estimate trajectories for the GTOC 2 -mission (a multiple asteroid rendezvous mission). The goal is to find out whether or not the spherical shaping method is capable of producing sub-optimal trajectories. Implementing the <b>spherical</b> shaping method <b>turned</b> out to be a more massive job than anticipated. The documentation in the PhD thesis by Novak [2012] appeared not to be fully sufficient to use the method. Additional derivations were necessary to grasp the meaning of some functions. In this thesis, this process is explained and corrections of some typos found in Novak’s PhD thesis, are given. The spherical shaping function relations are re-ordered in a step-wise implementation scheme. This helps to get an overview of the implementation and will make future applications of this method easier. The implemented method is fully validated, both with respect to general two- and three-dimensional trajectories and with respect to the same test cases as used by Novak [2012]. The applicability of any method is dependent on its limits. For the spherical shaping method, these limits were not given unambiguously. Novak [2012] speaks of low and high inclinations but does not specify what is meant by "low" and "high". To find out what the limits for the inclination of the orbit are, several trajectories were computed for a range of inclination angles, for both trajectories at a constant inclination and trajectories with inclination changes. It was found that up until an inclination of 15 degrees, the relative difference between the deltav for a transfer at this constant inclination and the deltav for a same transfer at a zero inclination remains below 1 percent. For higher inclinations the difference rises quickly. At high inclinations of about 50 degrees the method breaks down. Also the Keplerian arc can not be reconstructed at inclined orbits. A way to solve this problem is to perform a reference frame transformation. A transformation involving a rotation over the line of nodes to remove the initial inclination was developed. This transformation works perfectly when the right ascension of both the initial and final orbit is equal and removes the effects caused by the high inclination. Also for high inclinations of above 50 degrees the spherical shaping method with reference frame transformation keeps producing feasible trajectories. The Keplerian arc can now be reconstructed at any inclination. When the right ascension of both orbits differs, the rotation is performed over the initial line of nodes, which makes it a less interesting rotation for the final orbit. To find out up to which right ascension difference the transformation can be used, several trajectories were computed for a range of right ascension differences (keeping other characteristics equal). It was found that up to 10 degrees the reference frame transformation can be useful. For higher differences in the initial and final right ascension of ascending node, the reference frame transformation could do more harm than good. To solve for high inclination changes, a solution was proposed to solve for multiple smaller inclination changes and sum the results. A promising result is obtained when combining this summation with the reference frame transformation. A last verification is performed by applying the implemented spherical shaping method to multiple test cases. Good results are obtained and therefore the implementation is considered fully validated. Finally the spherical shaping method is applied to the GTOC 2 problem, using the top 3 asteroid combinations found by GTOC 2, Heiligers [2013] and Secretin [2012]. Monte Carlo simulations with 100, 000 samples were run and for each asteroid combination feasible trajectories are obtained, within the constraints set by GTOC 2. The initial search space was set too broad which resulted in less feasible trajectories for GTOC 2. Additional runs for a smaller search space are needed. There is however no time left to do this as well. It is recommended that the search is continued and a more thorough optimisation is performed. For the objective function of the GTOC 2 problem a best value of 71. 12 kg/yr was obtained for the asteroid combination equal to GTOC 2 rank 2. Also a minimum value of deltav was obtained, equal to 20. 04 km/s, for the asteroid combination of Secretin [2012] rank 3. Better results for both the objective function values or deltav for all asteroid combinations are expected when a more extensive optimisation is performed for the implementation of the spherical shaping method.

40|$|Introdução: A atividade exploratória para o desenvolvimento do alcance pode ser visual e/ou manual. A prática de atividade exploratória proporciona ganhos de capacidades motoras e perceptuais, que possibilitarão ao bebê a descoberta de affordances. Ao interagir com o ambiente e descobrir affordances, o bebê revela um comportamento adaptativo que evidenciará o seu desenvolvimento. O objetivo deste estudo foi {{investigar}} a relação entre atividades exploratórias e a descoberta das affordances tocável e batível, e posterior desenvolvimento do comportamento adaptativo da batida no alvo, durante o desenvolvimento do alcance em bebês de 4 a 8 meses de vida. Materiais e Método: Trata-se de um estudo longitudinal, no qual treze bebês foram recrutados de forma não aleatória. Foram coletados dados de cada bebê quinzenalmente, de 4 a 8 meses de vida, totalizando nove coletas. Os bebês interagiam espontaneamente com um alvo esférico que gira em torno do próprio eixo, oferecendo as possibilidades de toque e batida, por 90 segundos, enquanto foram filmados por duas câmeras digitais. Atividades exploratórias visuais e manuais do alvo, assim como as tentativas de alcances e de alcances tipos toque e batida foram extraídos, das nove coletas longitudinais, através de vídeo-análise por cinco pesquisadoras (ICC= 0, 8). Análise de sobrevivência investigou o tempo até a primeira ocorrência dos eventos de interesse (toque e batida) e o método Kaplan-Meier foi utilizado para comparar a influência das atividades exploratórias (preditores) na descoberta das affordances tocável e batível. Modelos multinível testaram a influência das atividades exploratórias na ocorrência de batidas ao longo do tempo. Resultados e Discussão: A atividade exploratória se tornou gradualmente multimodal: enquanto a exploração visual pura diminuiu, ela foi incorporada à exploração manual. Os bebês descobriram as affordances tocável e batível até 5, 5 meses de vida; aqueles que descobriram as affordances mais cedo exploraram menos o alvo. Toque e batida são padrões de alcances distintos e o primeiro não influencia o aprimoramento do segundo. A redução de 1 % na exploração visual aumentou em 2, 2 % {{a chance}} de realizarem batidas. O aumento de 1 tentativa de batida aumentou 3, 6 % a chance de ocorrência de batidas, enquanto o aumento de 1 tentativa de toque afastou em 0, 9 % a chance de ocorrência de batidas. Conclusão: A descoberta das affordances tocável e batível pareceu acontecer pela confluência das propriedades físicas do objeto com as capacidades do bebê de extrair rapidamente as informações relevantes através de atividade exploratória multimodal, sem necessidade de prática prévia. No entanto, a relação entre atividade exploratória e descoberta das affordances foi distinta da relação entre atividade exploratória e o desenvolvimento da batida. Para o desenvolvimento da batida, práticas de atividades exploratórias multimodais e cada vez mais específicas parecem ser fundamentais. Introduction: The exploratory activity {{for the development}} of the reach can be visual and/or manual. The practical of exploratory activity provides profits of motor and perceptual capacities that will make possible to the baby the discovery of affordances. When interacting with the environment and discovering affordances, the baby discloses an adaptive behavior that will evidence its development. The objective of this study was to investigate the relation between exploratory activities and the discovery of affordances touchable and hittable and posterior development of the adaptive behavior of the hit in the target, during the development of the reach in babies of 4 to 8 months of life. Materials and Method: This is a longitudinal study, in which thirteen babies had been enlisted by convenience. They had data collected of each baby biweekly, of 4 to 8 months of life, totalizing nine collections. The babies interacted spontaneously with a <b>spherical</b> target that <b>turns</b> around the proper axle, offering the possibilities of touch and hit, per 90 seconds, while they were filmed by two digital cameras. Visual and manual exploratory activities of the target, as well as the attempts of reach and of reach types as touch and hit had been extracted, of the nine longitudinal collections, through video-analysis by five researchers (ICC= 0, 8). Survival analysis investigated the time until the first occurrence of the interest events (touch and hit) and the Kaplan-Meier method was used to compare the influence of the exploratory activities (predictors) in the discovery of affordances touchable and hittable. Multilevel models had tested the influence of the exploratory activities in the occurrence of hits throughout the time. Results and Discussion: The exploratory activity became gradually multimodal: while the pure visual exploration diminished, it was incorporated the manual exploration. The babies discovered affordances touchable and hittable up to 5, 5 months of age; those that had discovered affordances earlier, explored less the target. Touch and hit are distinct forms of reach and the first one does not influence the improvement of the second. The reduction of 1 % in the visual exploration increased in 2, 2 % the possibility to carry through hit. The increase of 1 attempt of hit increased 3, 6 % the possibility of occurrence of hits, while the increase of 1 attempt of touch moved away in 0, 9 % the possibility from occurrence from hits. Conclusion: The discovery of affordances touchable and hittable seemed to happen for the confluence of the physical properties of the object with the capacities of the baby to quickly extract the relevant information through multimodal exploratory activity, without necessity of previous practice. However, the relation between exploratory activity and discovery of affordances were distinct of the relation between exploratory activity and the development of the hit. For the development of the hit, practical of more multimodal and specific exploratory activities seem to be important...|$|R
