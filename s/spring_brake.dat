50|$|The {{control system}} is further {{divided into two}} service brake {{circuits}}, the parking brake circuit, and the trailer brake circuit. The dual service brake circuits are further split into front and rear wheel circuits which receive compressed air from their individual reservoirs for added safety {{in case of an}} air leak. The service brakes are applied by means of a brake pedal air valve which regulates both circuits. The parking brake is the air operated <b>spring</b> <b>brake</b> type where its applied by spring force in the <b>spring</b> <b>brake</b> cylinder and released by compressed air via hand control valve. The trailer brake consists of a direct two line system: the supply line (marked red) and the separate control or service line (marked blue). The supply line receives air from the prime mover park brake air tank via a park brake relay valve and the control line is regulated via the trailer brake relay valve. The operating signals for the relay are provided by the prime mover brake pedal air valve, trailer service brake hand control (subject to local heavy vehicle legislation) and the prime mover park brake hand control.|$|E

50|$|A <b>spring</b> <b>brake</b> {{relay valve}} {{works on the}} same {{principle}} as the service brake relay valve, although it has the opposite effect. This type of relay valve responds to a major drop in pressure at its control-port by opening its exhaust port, which causes the air from each <b>spring</b> <b>brake</b> chamber under its control to remotely exhaust, thus applying the spring brakes much-more-quickly than would otherwise be possible if the air were required to discharge via the yellow parking-control valve on the dashboard. In a dual-circuit air brake system, air from both the primary and secondary reservoirs is fed into the supply-port of the parking-control valve, {{as well as the}} supply-port of this relay valve; it is merged via yet another two-way check valve. The delivery-port output of the parking-control valve connects to the control-port of this relay valve; this enables the spring brakes to be controlled via this valve. The merged air from the parking-control valve prevents air-loss from only one braking circuit from causing the spring brakes to automatically apply. This gives the driver more control, and prevents the vehicle from grinding to a halt in an unsafe location. However, with this increased control, comes increased responsibility {{on the part of the}} driver: If air is lost from the primary circuit alone, the spring brakes must be manually applied by the driver via the parking-control valve; otherwise, the front service brakes may not be enough to stop the vehicle safely in an emergencyâ€”especially if the vehicle is heavily loaded, and/or traveling at a high-speed. In fact, the driver's failure to manually apply the spring brakes in this situation could lead to catastrophic failure of the front brakes due to overheating, since it could cause the front service brakes to exceed their design-limit for energy absorption.QR1C air valve speeds up the process, with anti compounding, meaning trailer and service brakes will function 1 second between each other.The relay valve's function is analogous to the transistor used in electronic circuits.|$|E
50|$|As {{a result}} of the {{modernisation}} the Soviet production internal combustion engine was replaced, with a US drive unit that meets the emissions standards for UIC three. In the modernisation the rate of power has been raised from 0.88 MW (1200 hp) to 1.55 MW (2100 hp), which makes the new version of the Tamara as a locomotive. The height of the driver cabin of the Newag 6DG has been raised, to improve visibility while driving. Air conditioning was installed in the driver's cab (KL20 with a power of 4.3 kW), a GPS and microprocessor control system NES. The components undergone major repairs and the brake lever system had been fitted with four cylinders, a <b>spring</b> <b>brake</b> system and traction motors, which are subjected to pressure-vacuum impregnation. The power generator consists of an internal CAT 3512C combustion engine, with a main generator and auxiliary generator.

50|$|In trailers, {{this remote}} air-supply {{is in the}} form of a tank, which is charged {{whenever}} the emergency brakes are released via the red trailer-supply valve on the dashboard. In a dual-circuit air brake system, this tank actually receives its air from both the primary and secondary reservoirs of the tractor; the air from both of these reservoirs is merged via a two-way check valve. The two-way check valve is a pneumatic device that has two inputs and one output; each input is connected to one these reservoirs. Only the air that is at the higher pressure is allowed to pass through to the check valve's output, which then passes through the tractor-protection valve, and then travels onward towards the trailer's air-tank and <b>spring</b> <b>brake</b> valve via the red trailer-supply line (a.k.a., the emergency line); this releases the trailer's emergency brakes (a.k.a. spring brakes). The tractor-protection valve is a device that prevents air from being lost from the tractor's braking system in the event of the air-lines becoming separated or broken. The tractor's air-lines connect to the trailer's air-lines via metal connectors known as gladhands. The merged air from both reservoirs of the tractor prevents air-loss from only one tractor braking circuit from causing the trailer's spring brakes to automatically apply. This gives the driver more control, and prevents the vehicle from grinding to a halt in an unsafe location, such as in the middle of an intersection.|$|E

5000|$|Air {{brake systems}} are {{typically}} used on heavy trucks and buses. The system consists of service brakes, parking brakes, a control pedal, and an air storage tank. For the parking brake, there's a disc or drum brake arrangement {{which is designed}} to be held in the 'applied' position by spring pressure. Air pressure must be produced to release these [...] "spring brake" [...] parking brakes. For the service brakes (the ones used while driving for slowing or stopping) to be applied, the brake pedal is pushed, routing the air under pressure (approx [...] or 6.89-8.27 bar) to the brake chamber, causing the brake to be engaged. Most types of truck air brakes are drum brakes, though there is an increasing trend towards the use of disc brakes in this application. The air compressor draws filtered air from the atmosphere and forces it into high-pressure reservoirs at around [...] Most heavy vehicles have a gauge within the driver's view, indicating the availability of air pressure for safe vehicle operation, often including warning tones or lights. A mechanical [...] "wig wag" [...] that automatically drops down into the driver's field of vision when the pressure drops below a certain point is also common. Setting of the parking/emergency brake releases the pressurized air in the lines between the compressed air storage tank and the brakes, thus allowing the spring actuated parking brake to engage. A sudden loss of air pressure would result in full <b>spring</b> <b>brake</b> pressure immediately.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a simulation of bipedal locomotion to generate stimulation pulses for activating muscles for paraplegic walking with wheel walker using functional electrical stimulation (FES) with <b>spring</b> <b>brake</b> orthosis (SBO). A new methodology for paraplegic gait, based on exploiting natural dynamics of human gait, is introduced. The {{work is a}} first effort towards restoring natural like swing phase in paraplegic gait through a new hybrid orthosis, referred to as <b>spring</b> <b>brake</b> orthosis (SBO). This mechanism simplifies the control task and results in smooth motion and more-natural like trajectory produced by the flexion reflex for gait in spinal cord injured subjects. SBO can eliminate reliance on the withdrawal reflex and foot-ground clearance without extra upper body effort. The stored energy {{in the spring of}} SBO is used to replace stimulation pulses in knee flexion and reduce total required torque for the paraplegic walking with wheel walker. The study is carried out with a model of humanoid with wheel walker using the Visual Nastran (Vn 4 D) dynamic simulation software. Stimulated muscle model of quadriceps is developed for knee extension. Fuzzy logic control (FLC) is developed in Matlab/Simulink to regulate the muscle stimulation pulse-width required to drive FES-assisted walking gait and the computed motion is visualised in graphic animation from Vn 4 D. The simulation results show that SBO can be successfully used with FES for paraplegic walking with wheel walker with all the advantages discussed over the current hybrid orthoses available...|$|E
40|$|<b>Spring</b> <b>brake</b> {{orthotic}} {{swing phase}} for paraplegic gait is initiated through releasing the brake {{on the knee}} mounted with a torsion spring. The stored potential energy in the spring, gained from the previous swing phase, is solely responsible for swing phase knee flexion. Hence the later part of the SBO operation, functional electrical stimulation (FES) assisted extension movement of the knee has to serve an additional purpose of restoring the spring potential energy on the fly. While control of FES induced movement as such is often a challenging task, a torsion spring, being antagonistically paired up with the muscle actuator, as in <b>spring</b> <b>brake</b> orthosis (SBO), only adds to the challenge. Two new schemes are proposed for the control of FES induced knee extension movement in SBO assisted swing phase. Even though the control schemes are closed-loop in nature, special {{attention is paid to}} accommodate the natural dynamics of the mechanical combination being controlled (the leg segment) as a major role playing feature. The schemes are thus found to be immune from some drawbacks associated with both closed-loop tracking as well as open-loop control of FES induced movement. A leg model including the FES knee joint model of the knee extensor muscle vasti along with the passive properties is used in the simulation. The optimized parameters for the SBO spring are obtained from the earlier part of this work. Genetic algorithm (GA) and multi-objective GA (MOGA) are used to optimize the parameters associated with the control schemes with minimum fatigue as one of the control objectives. The control schemes are evaluated in terms of three criteria based on their ability to cope with muscle fatigue...|$|E

The report concludes with recommendations for legal requirements concerning lateral stability both on dry and on wet road surfaces. It is concluded that: lateral stability must be obtained on both a dry and a wet road surface; tractors for semi-trailers should have a split braking system; and service brakes for motor vehicles and trailers (semi-trailers) should have a certain braking capacity in case a failure occurs (emergency braking capacity). As a solution it is proposed that the emergency braking capacity of the service brake shall be at least 50 % of the normal required capacity...|$|E
40|$|<b>Spring</b> <b>brake</b> {{orthosis}} (SBO) concentrates purely on {{the knee}} to generate the swing phase of the paraplegic gait with the required hip flexion occurring passively {{as a consequence of}} the ipsilateral knee flexion, generated by releasing the torsion spring mounted at the knee joint. Electrical stimulation then drives the knee back to full extension, as well as restores the spring potential energy. In this paper, genetic algorithm (GA) and its variant multi-objective GA (MOGA) is used to perform the search operation for the â€˜bestâ€™ spring parameters for the SBO spring mounted on an average sized subject simulated in the sagittal plane. Conventional torsion spring is tested against constant torque type spring in terms of swing duration as, based on first principles, it is hypothesized that constant torque spring would be able to produce slower SBO swing phase as might be preferred in assisted paraplegic gait. In line with the hypothesis, it is found that it is not possible to delay the occurrence of the flexion peak of the SBO swing phase further than its occurrence in the natural gait. The use of conventional torsion spring causes the swing knee flexion peak to appear rather faster than that of the natural gait, resulting in a potentially faster swing phase and hence gait cycle. The constant torque type spring on the other hand is able to stretch duration of the swing phase to some extent, rendering it the preferable spring type in SBO...|$|E

40|$|The {{number of}} people with spinal cord injury (SCI) is {{increasing}} every year and walking {{has been found to be}} the most exciting and important prospect to these patients to improve their quality of life. Many individuals with incomplete SCI have the potential to walk and everyone of them wants to try. Unfortunately up to now, there is less than one third of patients could walk again after SCI. Residual function, the orthotic support, energy expenditure, patient motivation and control technique are some of the factors that influence the walking outcome of spinal cord injured people. In this thesis, a series of studies are carried out to investigate the possibility of enhancing the performance of the functional electrical stimulation (PES) assisted paraplegic walking with wheel walker through the development and implementation of intelligent control technique and <b>spring</b> <b>brake</b> orthosis (SBO) with full utilization of the voluntary upper body effort. The main aim of this thesis is to enable individuals with complete paraplegia to walk again with maximum performance and the simplest approach as possible. Firstly, before simulation of the system can be made, it is important to select the right model to represent the actual plant. In this thesis, the development of a humanoid and wheel walker models are carried out using MSC. visualNastran 4 D (vN 4 D) software and this is integrated with Matlab SimulinkÂ® for simulation. The newly developed quadriceps and hamstrings muscle models from the series of experiments are used to represent subject muscles after comparison and validation with other two well-known muscle models are performed. Several experiments are conducted to investigate the effect of stimulation frequency and pulse-width in intermittent stimulation with isometric measurement from paraplegic subjects. The results from this work can serve as a guidance to determine the optimum stimulation parameters such as frequency and pulse-width to reduce muscle fatigue during PES application. The ability test is introduced to determine the maximum leg force that can be applied to the specific paraplegic subject during FES functional task with minimum chance of spasm and leg injury. Investigations are carried out on the control techniques implemented for FES walking with wheel walker. PID control and fuzzy logic control (FLC) are used to regulate the electrical stimulation required by the quadriceps and hamstrings muscles in order to perform the FES walking manoeuvre according to predefined walking trajectory. The body weight transfer is introduced to increase the efficiency of FES walking performance. The effectiveness of body weight transfer and control strategy to enhance the performance of FES walking and reduce stimulation pulses required is examined. Investigations are carried out on the effectiveness of <b>spring</b> <b>brake</b> orthosis (SBO) for FES assisted paraplegic walking with wheel walker. A new concept in hybrid orthotics provides solutions to the problems that affect current 'hybrid orthosis, including knee and hip flexion without relying on the withdrawal reflex or a powered actuator and foot-ground clearance without extra upper body effort. The use of SBO can also eliminate electrical stimulation pulses required by the hamstrings muscle for the same FES walking system. Further improvement of the FES walking system is achieved by introducing finite state control (FSC) to control the switching time between springs, brakes and electrical stimulation during FES assisted walking with wheel walker with the combInation of FLC to regulate the electrical stimulation required for the knee extension. The results show that FSC can be used to accurately control the switching time and improve the system robustness and stability...|$|E
