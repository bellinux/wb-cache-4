50|$|Des Grieux's father, the Comte, greets de Brétigny and Manon overhears {{that her}} former lover is Chevalier no longer, but Abbé, having entered the seminary of Saint-Sulpice. Approaching the Comte, Manon tries to {{discover}} whether his son still loves her. Guillot then attempts to win Manon over by bringing the ballet dancers of the Académie Royale de Musique, {{which she had}} {{expressed a desire to}} see. However Manon is <b>seized</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>desire</b> to see des Grieux once more, and admits, to Guillot's annoyance when asked, that she paid no attention to the dancers. She hurries off to Saint-Sulpice.|$|E
5000|$|At the beginning, many {{scholars}} propose the restitution [...] "I am...". The {{second and third}} lines form a hexameter verse each, with a perfect regular scansion. Modern scholars agree that the text is meant as a humorous contrast between {{the richness of the}} legendary Cup of Nestor and the simplicity of the clay drinking cup. There are several interpretations, some of which make use of textual emendations, to explain the humorous effect of the perceived incoherence between the first line and the others. One emendation is that the beginning should read: [...] "" [...] ('Nestor's cup may be good, but...'), or [...] "" [...] ('Nestor's cup, begone!'). A third hypothesis is that the text {{was the result of a}} [...] "drinking-party game": One player wrote the first line, then a second player was challenged to complement the poem with a second line, and so on. This is reinforced by the phrasing of the last verse, which says, albeit very elegantly, that the drinker will become sexually aroused. The most recent hypothesis is the one proposed by Yves Gerhard (Zeitschrift für Papyrologie und Epigraphik, 176, 2011, pp. 7-9), with Νέστορος ἔασον εὔποτον ποτήριον at the first verse : [...] "Leave aside Nestor's cup, as excellent as it may be to drink from; but whoever drinks of this very cup shall immediately be <b>seized</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>desire</b> of well-crowned Aphrodite." ...|$|E
