40|$|Surface air {{pressure}} differentials that occur over reservoirs, canals, and water-catchment aprons in high-wind conditions {{were determined by}} the use of models in a wind tunnel. Such information was needed concerning the magnitude and location of destructive wind forces on water barriers constructed of exposed flexible membrane liners. Rigid models, without a membrane, were used to measure airpressure differentials. Air-pressure differentials were dependent on geometric configuration and were independent of viccous forces above the critical Reynolds number which was determined experimentally. The geometric factors studied with respect to reservoirs and canals included approach slope, approach slope length, leeward slope, and breadth-depth ratio. Those pertaining to water-catchment aprons included breadth-berm height ratio and berm shape. On the leeward slope of reservoirs, favorable (positive) differential pressures were more apt to occur as the approach and leeward slopes decreased (became less steep), but extreme adverse (negative) pressures occurred under the same conditions near the top edge of the slope. As the leeward slope increased the pressure coefficient values were essentially constant over the entire surface. On the reservoir bottom, adverse pressures did not exist when approach and leeward slopes were at the minimum evaluated (1 : 4). When the leeward and approach slopes increased the average pressure on the bottom became less favorable. The most adverse pressure coefficients generally occurred at the toe of the leeward slope, while maximum favorable pressures on the reservoir bottom generally occurred at the toe of the downwind slope. In most instances, the pressure on the downwind slope was favorable; however, adverse pressures were recorded near the top edge of the slope. These adverse or negative pressure conditions were more apt to occur as the breadth-depth ratio increased and the leeward slope decreased. Average pressure values on the interior surface of canals were generally less adverse than for reservoirs. Similar to the reservoirs, the most adverse pressures on the leeward slope of the canals were found immediately over the upper edge of the slope. Extreme adverse pressures on the canal bottom were associated with long and steep approach slope conditions. One exception was the occurrence of the most favorable pressure over the canal bottom when the approach slope was short but still steep. In addition to measurement of adverse pressures near the top edge of the downwind <b>slope,</b> <b>adverse</b> pressures were found near the toe of the slope in some instances. The portion of the downwind slope under an adverse pressure influence decreased as the breadth-depth ratio increased. Generally, pressures over a canal were more responsive to the approach slope and approach slope height than to leeward slope arid breadth-depth ratio. For a reservoir, however, pressures were responsive to all geometric factors, depending on which section of the reservoir was being considered. Pressure distributions over water-catchment aprons were independent of breadth-berm height ratios of 50 or greater. Negative pressures were lower over gradual sloped catchment berms by a factor of three than over sine-shaped berms. Each berm shape, on the leeward side of the upwind berm, had a pressure distribution associated with it that was the same as far as shape but was different in magnitude depending on the shape of the windward side of the berm. Pressures were less adverse on the leeward side of the berm, if the windward side were gradually sloped. Pressures were near zero to slightly favorable over {{a large portion of the}} water-catchment apron between the berm toes. This near stable favorable condition might change significantly, if site conditions were to change...|$|E

The objective {{of this study is}} to perform on-site investigation and <b>adverse</b> calculation of <b>slope</b> damage at a specified road section along Tai- 27 highway in Taiwan. By analysing a total of 38 on-site survey results, it is found that the types of slope damage may include debris flow (26 %), shallow soil layer sliding (26 %), nearly circular sliding (8 %), slope oriented sliding (3 %), falling rock (11 %), river erosion (13 %), and others (13 %). Based on available geological information at three locations with nearly circular <b>slope</b> failure, the <b>adverse</b> calculations using computer software show that these slopes all failed at a shallow soil layer. Some of the important soil strength parameters such as cohesion force and friction angle are estimated, and a critical sliding surface is predicted for a minimum safety factor.

40|$|Overdeepenings, i. e. closed {{topographic}} depressions with <b>adverse</b> <b>slopes</b> in {{the direction}} of flow, are characteristic for glacier beds and glacially sculpted landscapes. Quantitative information about their morphological characteristics, however, has so far hardly been available. The present study provides such information by combining the analysis of (a) numerous bed overdeepenings below still existing glaciers of the Swiss Alps and the Himalaya-Karakoram region modelled with a robust shear stress approximation and (b) detailed bathymetries from recently exposed lakes in the Peruvian Andes. The investigated overdeepenings exist where glacier surface slopes are low (< 5 °– 10 °), occur in bedrock or morainic material and are most commonly a fraction of a kilometre squared in surface area, hundreds of metres long, about half the length in width and tens of meters deep. They form under conditions of low to high basal shear stresses, at cirque, confluence, trunk valley and terminus positions. The most striking phenomenon, however, is the high variability of their geometries: Depths, surface areas, lengths and widths of the overdeepenings vary over orders of magnitude and are only weakly – if at all – interrelated. Inclinations of <b>adverse</b> <b>slopes</b> do not differ significantly from those of forward slopes and are in many cases higher than so far assumed theoretical limits for supercooling of ascending water and corresponding closure of sub-glacial channels. Such steep <b>adverse</b> <b>slopes</b> are a robust observation and in support of recently developed new concepts concerning the question about where supercooling of sub-glacial water and closure of ice channels can or must occur. However, the question of when and under what climatic, topographic and ice conditions the overdeepenings had formed remains unanswered. This open question constitutes a key problem concerning the interpretation of observed overdeepenings, the understanding of the involved glacio-hydraulic processes and the possibility of realistic predictive modelling of overdeepening formation...|$|R

Comparison of flow energy dissipation over end sills stepped spillway and inclined type show that the inclined type has been dissipated more energy than the equivalent end sill type.

However, the longitude evolution of scour profiles and the volume of eroded materials were increasing in accordance with slope of basin.

40|$|Closed {{topographic}} basins {{are found}} beneath contemporary ice masses {{and within the}} footprint of former ice masses in all glaciated regions. We present the first integrated review of subglacial basin occurrence and formation {{and the implications of}} such basins for glaciological processes and the evolution of landscape. Our purpose is to motivate research in areas where understanding of basin origin and process significance is weak. Basins on the order of 10 – 102 m deep and 102 – 103 m long are produced by glacial erosion of subglacial rock and/or sediment and are known as ‘overdeepenings’. Outlet and valley glaciers can ‘overdeepen’ their beds far below sea level or local fluviatile base level. Larger basins, typically in ice sheet contexts, may have a pre-glacial (usually tectonic) origin. Subglacial basins are important glaciologically because they require ice, water and sediment to ascend an <b>adverse</b> subglacial <b>slope</b> in order to exit the glacial system, the efficiency of which is dependent upon the gradient of the <b>adverse</b> <b>slope</b> and that of the ice surface. Basins thus influence subglacial drainage system morphology and transmissivity, the thickness and distribution of basal ice and sediment layers, and the mechanisms and dynamics of ice flow. Adverse gradients that exceed 11 times that of the ice surface may even permit the formation of subglacial lakes. We speculate that, in comparison to ice masses with few or no subglacial basins, those with numerous or very large basins may respond to climatic changes with unexpected vigour. In addition, erosion rates and transport pathways of water and sediment through the glacial system, and the expression of these processes in the sediment and landform record, may be unexpectedly complex. Further, our review shows that, in a warming climate, ice masses resting on <b>adverse</b> <b>slopes</b> will be vulnerable to rapid and potentially catastrophic retreat; new lakes in subglacial basins exposed by mountain glacier retreat will present an increasing hazard; and subglacial lakes may drain catastrophically. On even longer time scales, we speculate that the glacial excavation and post-glacial filling of basins in mountainous regions should contribute importantly to climate-related changes in isostasy and relief. Although the controls on overdeepening and their influence on other glacial and landscape processes remain uncertain, we hypothesise that overdeepened glacial systems reflect an equilibrium ice–bed geometry that maximises the efficiency of ice discharge. Improved understanding of overdeepening processes, especially overdeepened-bed hydrology, is therefore necessary to understand fully the dynamic behaviour of valley and outlet glaciers, and thus the fate of Earth's largest ice masses...|$|R

BackgroundIn CHF, endothelial dysfunction is involved in muscle underperfusion, ergoreflex oversignaling, and exercise ventilation inefficiency. Inhibition of PDE 5 by improving endothelial dysfunction might be beneficial. MethodsStable CHF patients {{were randomly assigned to}} placebo (23 patients) or sildenafil at the dose of 50 mg twice per day (23 patients) in addition to their current drug treatment for 6 months, with assessments (at 3 and 6 months) of endothelial function by brachial artery flow-mediated dilatation (FMD), cardiopulmonary exercise testing, and ergoreflex response. ResultsIn the sildenafil group only, at 3 and 6 months we observed reduction of systolic pulmonary artery pressure (from 33. 7 to 25. 2 mm Hg and 23. 9 mm Hg), ergoreflex effect on ventilation (from 6. 9 to 2. 3 l·min− 1 and 1. 9 l·min− 1), ventilation to CO 2 production slope (VE/Vco 2, from 35. 5 to 32. 1 and 29. 8), and breathlessness (score) (from 23. 6 to 16. 6 and 17. 2), and an increase of FMD (from 8. 5 % to 13. 4 % and 14. 2 %), peak Vo 2 (from 14. 8 to 18. 5 ml·min− 1 ·kg− 1 and 18. 7 ml·min− 1 ·kg− 1), and ratio of Vo 2 to work rate changes (from 7. 7 to 9. 3 and 10. 1). All changes were significant at p < 0. 01. In the sildenafil group, a significant correlation was found at 3 and 6 months between changes in FMD and those in ergoreflex. Changes in ergoreflex correlated with those in peak Vo 2 and VE/Vco 2 <b>slope.</b> No <b>adverse</b> effects were noted except for flushing in 3 patients. ConclusionsIn CHF, improvement in exercise ventilation and aerobic efficiency with sildenafil is sustained and is significantly related with an endothelium-mediated attenuation of exercising muscle oversignaling.

40|$|In an open channel, {{a sudden}} rise in water level induces a {{positive}} surge, or bore, that may develop as a hydraulic jump in translation. When the surge propagates against an <b>adverse</b> <b>slope,</b> it decelerates {{until it becomes}} a stationary hydraulic jump. Both hydraulic jumps and decelerating surges induce some intense turbulent mixing and have some major impact on the sediment transport in natural systems. Herein, a physical investigation was conducted in a relatively large rectangular channel. Hydraulic jumps and surges were generated by the rapid closure of a gate at the channel downstream end. The turbulent shear stresses were measured with high temporal and spatial resolution (200 Hz sampling rate) in the jump flow. A comparison between the stationary hydraulic jump, hydraulic jump in translation and decelerating surge measurements showed some marked differences in terms of turbulent mixing. The results highlighted some intense mixing beneath the jump front and roller for all configurations. The levels of turbulent stresses were one to two orders of magnitude larger than a critical threshold for sediment motion. The findings provide some insights into the hydraulic jump migration processes in mobile bed channels, and the complex transformation from a moving jump into a stationary jump.

40|$|The {{reactivation}} {{mechanism and}} stability of ancient landslides are the major concerns in the tectonically active zone. A detailed case study has been conducted to examine the reactivation mechanism of ancient landslides in Southwest China by investigating the reactivation process, shear strength and stability. Field investigation suggests that the reactivation of ancient giant slides, such as the Luosiwan slide, is attributed to {{the cumulative effect of}} adverse geological, structural condition and intensive artificial processes. However, long-term observation has shown that the ancient giant landslides usually remain stable in the remote area in spite of such adverse conditions. Ring shear tests also indicate high peak shear strength of the sliding zone soils. However, the shear strength decreases significantly once displacement occurs at the toe of giant landslide due to engineering construction. The construction process could be considered as the critical triggering factor for the reactivation of ancient giant landslide, which exerts sudden changes in the forces acting on the <b>slope.</b> Both long-term <b>adverse</b> geological evolution and sudden change in the strength lead to the reactivation of giant landslide. This study also suggests that liquefaction {{plays an important role in}} the failure behavior of reactivated ancient landslide.

40|$|Most bedrock river {{channels}} have {{a relatively}} thin, discontinuous cover of alluvium and are thus termed mixed bedrock-alluvial channels. Such channels often show {{a series of steps}} formed at relatively regular intervals. This bed form is the bedrock equivalent of cyclic steps formed on beds composed of cohesive soil in gullies. In this paper, we perform a full nonlinear analysis for the case of cyclic steps in mixed bedrock-alluvial channels to explain the formation of these steps. We employ the shallow water equations in conjunction with equations describing the process of bedrock incision. As a model of bedrock incision, we employ the recently introduced Macro-Roughness Saltation Abrasion Alluviation model, which allows direct interaction between alluvial and bedrock morphodynamics. The analysis is greatly simplified by making the quasi-steady assumption that alluvial processes occur much faster than bedrock erosional processes. From our analysis, we obtain the conditions for the formation of cyclic steps in bedrock, as well as the longitudinal profiles of bed elevation, water surface elevation, and areal fraction of alluvial cover. It is found from the analysis that when the sediment supply is small relative to the transport capacity, cyclic steps form only on slopes with very high gradients. The analysis indicates that the shape of a step formed on bedrock is characterized by a relatively short upstream portion with an <b>adverse</b> <b>slope</b> and a long, almost planar downstream portion with a constant slope...|$|R

The definitions used and physical principles underlying mass movements are explained and keys and diagnostic parameters are given to explain how to recognize certain types of mass movements in the field. The causes of mass movement are described, amongst which deforestation, adverse hydrological conditions or slope undercutting, are summarized. The main types of mass movements i. e. falls, slides and flows are then separately discussed, giving full details {{with regard to their}} causes, processes and consequences, as well as a first glimpse to the solutions to slope failure problems, which will be addressed in more detail elsewhere in the book. The second part addresses erosion processes. Accelerated erosion is considered {{as one of the greatest}} problems of land degradation as it removes the fertile topsoil at high rates. Mankind, who is removing the original vegetation for agricultural purposes, is causing this problem. Again the general principles behind soil erosion are illustrated, giving attention to the causes and the different soil erosion processes such as sheet erosion, rill and gully erosion, piping and tunnel erosion as well as tillage erosion...|$|R
40|$|Much of the Middle Rio Grande has {{severely}} degraded since 1930 when flood control institution began (Scurlock 1998). Since that time, additional anthropogenic stressors {{have continued to}} cause the river to incise and narrow and have harmed the ecological health of the system. As a result, many different entities have developed restoration projects along the Middle Rio Grande. These projects are often localized, small scale features that promote native vegetation establishment and improve habitat for endangered species without removing flood protection measures. One such feature is the Rio Grande Nature Center (RGNC) Habitat Restoration project. The project consists of removing non-native plants and constructing an ephemeral, high-flow, side channel connected to the Rio Grande in Albuquerque, New Mexico. The channel provides habitat for the Rio Grande Silvery Minnow and helps connect the river to its floodplain, promoting establishment of native vegetation. Since its completion in February 2008, the RGNC side channel has provided improved conditions for native vegetation and silvery minnow but has undergone significant aggradation. This deposition brings into question the sustainability of this project. One- and two-dimensional numerical models are developed to model the RGNC channel, determine project life-cycle, examine modeling approaches, and alternative designs. One-dimensional modeling efforts were determined to be insufficient for capturing the sediment transport measured in the RGNC channel. Two-dimensional modeling results proved to be sufficient, indicating that this level of modeling can be applied as a useful design tool. Two-dimensional modeling suggests a project life of up to 50 years with the channel reaching a dynamic equilibrium after 15 to 20 years. Though the channel should last for 50 years, the duration and magnitudes of flows will likely be reduced. Alternative designs were modeled. These models suggest that embayments (described herein) are an effective, sustainable feature in high-flow, side channel restoration projects. However, the alternative designs suggest {{that the use of}} <b>adverse</b> <b>slopes</b> at the upstream of side channel restoration designs will contribute to a reduced project life.

40|$|To {{assess the}} {{performance}} of a stilling basin under the probable maximum flood, standard probable flood, and the reservoir draw down discharge conditions and different tailwater levels, and to determine the velocity magnitudes downstream of the stilling basin to design the necessary protection measures, a hydraulic model study was conducted at the St. Anthony Falls Laboratory. The physical model included the spillway, the chute, the stilling basin and about 220 ft of the channel downstream. The model was built at a scale of 1 : 16. Three series of tests were conducted in this model study. The first test series were conducted under the probable maximum flood condition with two tailwater levels, and under the standard probable flood condition with one tailwater level. The test results showed that the maximum velocity is about 10 fps and occurs downstream of the stilling basin on the flat section and the section with an <b>adverse</b> <b>slope</b> of 20 %. The maximum average velocity {{at the beginning of the}} channel with a bed slope of 0. 182 % was about 8 fps, which would drop to approximately 6 fps 60 ft downstream of the beginning of the channel. The second test series were to examine the possibility of washing the existing backfill out of the stilling basin under the above flow conditions. A sand with the d 50 of 110 microns was used in this experiment. The results showed that the backfill sand in the mid-section of the channel will be washed out but a significant amount of the backfill sand near the banks will not, and a portion of the eroded sand will be deposited near the banks of the channel downstream. The third test series showed that the stilling basin does not perform well under the lowest future tailwater conditions, but it does perform well at a tailwater level of 13 ft above the datum under the PMF, 12. 2 ft under the SPF and 11. 4 ft under the reservoir draw down discharge...|$|R
40|$|In {{a natural}} tidal channel, Tule Slough, in Petaluma Marsh {{bordering}} the Petaluma River north of San Pablo Bay, synoptic measurements of stage and velocity {{were made at}} seven locations along the 3 mile length of the channel. Stage at each location was tied to a common datum and thus slope of the water surface could be computed. Values of slope were predominantly of the order of. 0001 or less but under some tides and in one reach attained a value of. 0006. As maximum or minimum tide height approached slope became zero but often hovered near zero {{for long periods of}} time. With few exceptions slope became zero hours or minutes before velocity reversed direction indicating that an <b>adverse</b> <b>slope</b> is necessary to reduce the water momentum to zero. Contrary to previously published accounts, none of which had synoptic measurements at several stations, the graph of slope vs time is not sinusoidal but much more closely resembles a flat and long cycloid curve. The longitudinal profile of the water surface is practically horizontal at maximum tide for the full three miles of channel length. Due to shallowing of the channel upstream at lowest tide the upper reach becomes essentially dry while in the downstream reach the profile is nearly flat. At mid tide the water surface slopes in opposite directions at the two ends of the channel length. The data suggest that {{there are at least two}} and possibly more types of tidal channels with respect to the change of width, depth, velocity And discharge along the channel. Tule Slough has few tributaries, has a nearly constant width for most of its length, shallows but little except at its far upstream reach. Therefore the hydraulic geometry relations found in the one channel for which data are available, Wrecked Recorder Slough in Virginia, do not apply. It is here suggested that such a difference would result from the character of the sediment making up the marsh and thus the type of vegetation growing on it. This pickleweed marsh is underlain by very fine clay containing much peat. The clay is derived from San Pablo Bay which is a shallow, large reentrant fed by only two minor rivers and which recieves [sic] little or no water or sediment from the Sacramento River...|$|R
