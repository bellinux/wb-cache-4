5000|$|Attention to Devon hedges as {{a feature}} worth {{investigating}} {{was raised by}} Clement Pike in the 1925 volume of the Transactions of the Devonshire Association. Writing about the patchwork of fields visible from Whitchurch Down, near Tavistock on the western fringe of Dartmoor, he noted: ... if you cross the Down and enter one of those fields ... and look about you, {{you find yourself in}} a kind of fortress. You are hemmed in by no <b>simple</b> <b>hedge</b> which you could creep through, no mere stone wall which you could vault over, nor by a low earthwork; but you find yourself confronted by a combination of them all. There is the earthwork, but it is faced and built up with solid masonry: granite blocks of all sizes, some huge, some quite small, and topping this construction is the hedge, which in some cases has grown into big trees. Now this suggests questions: What does it mean? Why should the fields in this part of Devon be thus enclosed? Questions easily put; and yet, as far as I am aware, never put before...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to assess the use of a group based project for an {{empirical}} finance type of course. It examines the outline of the project, the methodology the students are encouraged to follow and how the course is assessed. This approach enables the students to apply many of the techniques learnt on this course and other courses such as econometrics, to determine an optimal portfolio of assets given their view on the risks in the economy. The emphasis is on risk management through portfolio diversification and the use of a <b>simple</b> <b>hedge</b> strategy. The overall aim is to introduce the students to the basics of portfolio management, as many work in this industry for their industrial placements and when they graduate. The main contribution to the literature is through the analysis of an empirically based portfolio management project.

40|$|Abstract—A risk {{management}} system for foreign exchange (FX) brokers is described. Stochastic model predictive control (SMPC) is used to reduce positions in foreign holdings over a receding horizon, while minimising a mean-variance cost func-tion. Computation of the broker’s position incorporates elements which model client flow, transaction costs, market impact, and exchange rate. Using both synthetic and historical data, the technique is shown to outperform two <b>simple</b> <b>hedging</b> strategies on a risk-cost Pareto frontier. Prediction of client and market behaviour are shown to further enhance the hedging outcome. I...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{an empirical}} proxy {{to capture the}} markets 2 ̆ 7 expectations of growth and the propensity of investors to extrapolate recent extreme growth too far into the future. The construction of the empirical proxy is predicated on the extant literature that shows that recent sales growth and yield surrogates reflect markets 2 ̆ 7 expectations of growth, which {{have been found to}} be too extreme. The paper also re-examines two recent asset pricing anomalies published in the accounting literature—the asset scaled accruals and forecast to price anomalies—in light of the likely connection of accruals to realized growth and the forecast to price ratio acting as a yield surrogate and impounding expectations of growth. I find that the empirical proxy, constructed from recent sales growth and the cash flow to price ratio, produces large abnormal returns to <b>simple</b> <b>hedge</b> strategies. Moreover, the proxy subsumes other expected growth proxies such as the earnings yield, the cash flow to price ratio, weighted average sales growth, and the IBES long-term growth forecast in its ability to explain future returns. Lastly, I find that employing the expected-growth proxy in multivariate returns regressions suggests that overly extreme expectations of growth may be a partial explanation for the abnormal returns generated to hedge portfolios based on the magnitudes of asset-scaled accruals and the forecast to price ratio. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{dramatic}} {{increase in the number of}} hedge funds and the "institutionalization" of the industry over the past decade have spurred rigorous research into hedge fund performance. This research has tended to uncover more questions than answers about the dynamic and multifaceted hedge fund industry.; This article presents a <b>simple</b> <b>hedge</b> fund business model in which fund returns are a function of three key elements [...] how the funds trade, where they trade, and how the positions are financed. The article also provides methods to help investors, intermediaries, and regulators identify systemic risk factors inherent in hedge fund strategies.; Estimating these risk factors requires having an accurate history of hedge fund performance. The authors examine recent statistics from three commercial hedge fund databases and discuss the problems with database biases that must be recognized to obtain accurate measures of returns.; While the data show that today's hedge funds use myriad strategies that have no uniform definition, the proposed business model implies that hedge fund managers are diversifying in order to maximize the enterprise value of their firms. But this diversification does not preclude the risk of leveraged opinions converging onto the same set of bets. Preventing convergence risk will require action by investors, intermediaries, regulators, and fund managers to improve industry-level disclosure and transparency while preserving the privacy of individual hedge funds' positions.

This chapter aims at describing, in a pedagogical fashion, how to estimate a univariate switching model for daily foreign exchange returns which {{are assumed to be}} drawn in a Markovian way from alternative Gaussian distributions with different means and variances.

We extend existing results by allowing the correlation between the hedging instrument and the underlying of the contingent claim to be random itself. We assume that the correlation process ρ evolves according to a stochastic differential equation with values between the boundaries − 1 and 1. We keep the correlation dynamics general and derive an integrability condition on the correlation process that allows to describe and compute the quadratic hedge by means of a <b>simple</b> <b>hedging</b> formula that can be directly implemented. Furthermore, we show that the conditions on ρ are fulfilled by a large class of dynamics. The theory is exemplified by various explicitly given correlation dynamics...|$|R
40|$|We {{discuss the}} pricing and risk {{management}} problems of standard European-style options in a Markovian regime-switching binomial model. Due {{to the presence}} of an additional source of uncertainty described by a Markov chain, the market is incomplete, so the no-arbitrage condition is not sufficient to fix a unique pricing kernel, hence, a unique option price. Using the minimal entropy martingale measure, we determine a pricing kernel.

40|$|We study own and rival risk in {{a dynamic}} duopoly with a {{homogeneous}} output good, stochastic industry demand, real options to expand or contract capacity, and potentially different adjustment costs across firms. In general, a competitor’s options to adjust capacity reduce own-firm risk through a <b>simple</b> <b>hedging</b> channel. Intuitively, product market improvements increase {{the probability of}} near-term rival expansion, and negative demand shocks induce competitor contraction. As the rival moves closer to its expansion or contraction boundaries, these hedging effects become more important, and generally differ from the own-firm effects of real options. As a consequence, when a leader and a follower emerge in equilibrium, risk dynamics differ substantially from the simultaneous move benchmark. In leader-follower equilibria ownfirm and competitor required returns tend to move together throug...|$|R

In this method reservoir storage is divided into several zones, wherein the rationing factors are changed immediately when water storage level moves from one zone to another. In the present study, a hedging rule with fuzzy rationing factors was applied for creating a transition zone in up and down each rule curve, and then the rationing factor will be changed in this zone gradually. For this propose, a monthly simulation model was developed and linked to the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm for calculation of the modified shortage index of two objective functions involving water supply of minimum flow and agriculture demands in a long-term simulation period.

40|$|Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) and {{has been}} widely used in the Black Scholes option-pricing {{framework}} to model the return of assets. However, many empirical investigations show that market returns have higher peaks and fatter tails than GBM. Contrary to the Black Scholes model, an option-pricing model which contains jumps reflects the evolution of stock prices more accurately. Therefore, hedging a model under jump diffusion would be desirable. This thesis develops a simplified method for hedging jump diffusions. In order to hedge the jump risk, other instruments besides the underlying asset must {{be used in the}} hedging procedure. We start with a the Partial Integro Differential Equation (PIDE) that models contingent claims with jumps and consider a dynamic hedging strategy that uses a hedging portfolio with the underlying asset and liquidly traded options.

40|$|Descriptive {{statistics}} and time-series econometric models {{are used to}} characterize the behavior of monthly fluid milk prices. Prices in April, May and June {{appear to be more}} variable than those in subsequent months, and the spring-time prices are perhaps skewed. Econometric models can capture the historical behavior of spot prices, but forecasts converge to the marginal distribution of the sample prices in about six months. Futures prices for Class III milk have the expected time-to-maturity effect and converge to the respective monthly distributions of the cash prices at contract maturity (as they must, since the contracts are cash settled). Thus, econometric models and futures quotes provide similar information about price behavior at contract maturity. Routine hedges in futures, especially those made four or more months prior to maturity, reduce the variance of returns, but over a period of years, lock-in an "average" return. While econometric models and futures quotes provide imprecise forecasts, they can be used in conjunction with historical data to determine whether expected prices are high relative to past experience. This may assist with making decisions about selective hedging. Likewise, historical evidence may be useful in evaluating expected returns from the use of put options.
