500|$|According to Diefenbaker biographer Smith, the Conservative MP quietly admired Mackenzie King for his {{political}} skills. However, Diefenbaker proved a gadfly and an annoyance to Mackenzie King. Angered by the words of Diefenbaker and fellow Conservative MP Howard Green in seeking to censure the government, the Prime Minister referred to Conservative MPs as [...] "a mob". When Diefenbaker accompanied two other Conservative leaders to a briefing by Mackenzie King on the war, the Prime Minister exploded at Diefenbaker (a constituent of his), [...] "What business {{do you have to}} be here? You <b>strike</b> <b>me</b> to the heart every time you speak." ...|$|E
500|$|Den of Geek {{selected}} the episode's special effects {{as a positive}} element, but was more critical of the episode as a whole. [...] "As Fringe goes," [...] the website explained, [...] "this ended up a rather lightweight narrative, which was more about getting Lincoln established with Fringe, and providing a few new plotlines that the subsequent stories can expand on." [...] IGN's Ramsey Isler was equally ambivalent, and gave the episode a score of 7.5 out of 10. He observed, [...] "It isn't a bad episode. It's a good addition to the Fringe lore. It's well-written, has plenty of action, and the actors are great as usual. But it just doesn't feel like a fulfilling continuation of last season's cliffhanger, nor does it <b>strike</b> <b>me</b> as a fantastic new direction for the season." ...|$|E
500|$|During {{recording}} {{there was}} pressure from I.R.S. Records {{to try to}} make the album more commercial. The label sent messages to Dixon and Easter, which the producers told the band that they would ignore. While the producers respected I.R.S. president Jay Boberg, they expressed dismay at the comments he made when he visited during the last day of sessions. Dixon called Boberg [...] "record company clueless", while Easter said [...] "I got along with Jay Boberg OK [...] but now and again he would express an opinion that would make me think, 'holy shit', because it would <b>strike</b> <b>me</b> as really teenage." [...] Buck said he was grateful that Dixon and Easter acted as a buffer between the band and its label. He said that [...] "it got to the point where as much as I respected the guys at I.R.S., we basically tried to record the records so they wouldn't know we were recording them!", and explained that part of the reason why R.E.M. recorded the album so quickly was that the group wanted to finish before representatives from I.R.S. showed up to listen to it.|$|E

And that was an intensely moving experience. We really feel, my husband and I, that we are really equal because we are married." ...|$|E

[...] Byrd later recalled, [...] "Suddenly lights flashed in my mind! Someone important had recognized my abilities! I was only 23 or 24 years old, and the thought of a political career had never really hit me. But <b>strike</b> <b>me</b> that night, it did." [...] Byrd became a recruiter and leader of his chapter. When it came time to elect the top officer (Exalted Cyclops) in the local Klan unit, Byrd won unanimously.|$|E
2500|$|Steve Englehart, {{who wrote}} issues #5–16, said Graham [...] "helped me plot, {{so that by}} the end it was pretty much a co-production." [...] Graham is {{formally}} credited as co-writer of issues #14-15, though as Englehart's writing collaborator for those issues, Tony Isabella recalled, [...] "Billy Graham is credited as the co-scripter of my first issue [...] and, try as I might, I simply do not recall getting anything other than the usual penciled pages to script. I skimmed a little of that issue and, making no judgment as to whether this is a good or bad thing, the writing does <b>strike</b> <b>me</b> as all mine." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1933, Valez {{appeared}} in the films The Half-Naked Truth with Lee Tracy and Hot Pepper, with Victor McLaglen and Edmund Lowe. Later that year, she returned to Broadway where she starred opposite Jimmy Durante in the musical revue <b>Strike</b> <b>Me</b> Pink. In 1934, she filmed Palooka and Strictly Dynamite (both also with Durante). That same year, Vélez was cast as [...] "Slim Girl" [...] in Laughing Boy with Ramón Novarro. The film was quietly released and largely ignored. The few reviews it received panned the film but praised Vélez's performance. She got much more success with her brief appearance in the multi-feature film Hollywood Party, which she makes a magnificent comic routine with Laurel and Hardy.|$|E

Atia takes revenge on Servilia by having Timon and her slaves publicly humiliate her: they pull Servilia from her litter, strip and beat her in the forum and cut her hair.|$|E
2500|$|Anything Goes {{proved to}} be the first of five Cole Porter musicals in which Merman starred. In {{addition}} to the title song, the score included [...] "I Get a Kick Out of You", [...] "You're the Top", and [...] "Blow Gabriel Blow". It opened on November 21, 1934, at the Alvin Theatre, and the New York Post called Merman [...] "vivacious and ingratiating in her comedy moments, and the embodiment of poise and technical adroitness" [...] when singing [...] "as only she knows how to do." [...] Although Merman always had remained with a show until the end of its run, she left Anything Goes after eight months to appear with Eddie Cantor in the film <b>Strike</b> <b>Me</b> Pink. She was replaced by Benay Venuta, with whom she enjoyed a long but frequently tempestuous friendship.|$|E
2500|$|By 1934, Durante {{had a major}} record {{hit with}} his own novelty composition, [...] "Inka Dinka Doo", with lyrics by Ben Ryan. It became his theme song {{for the rest of}} his life. A year later, Durante starred on Broadway in the Billy Rose stage musical Jumbo. [...] A scene in which a police officer stopped Durante's character—who was leading a live {{elephant}} across the stage—to ask, [...] "What are you doing with that elephant?", followed by Durante's reply, [...] "What elephant?", was a regular show-stopper. This comedy bit, also reprised in his role in Billy Rose's Jumbo, likely contributed to the popularity of the idiom the elephant in the room. Durante also appeared on Broadway in Show Girl (1929), <b>Strike</b> <b>Me</b> Pink (1934) and Red, Hot and Blue (1936).|$|E

2500|$|Ibrahim Hooper, Communications Director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), {{charged that}} the {{controversy}} was [...] "manufactured" [...] by [...] "bigots". He also asserted that only a vocal minority was complaining. And Nihad Awad, CAIR's Executive Director, said that the opinion of Republican Congressman Peter King [...] "should not be considered, because his ideas are extreme". Fareed Zakaria, Newsweek journalist and CNN host, also strongly supported the project, and returned a prestigious award he received in 2005 from the Anti-Defamation League, saying he was [...] "personally and deeply saddened" [...] by their opposition towards the project. He wrote: [...] "...Rauf, is a moderate Muslim clergyman. He has said one or two things about American foreign policy that <b>strike</b> <b>me</b> as overly critical – but it's stuff you could read on The Huffington Post any day.
