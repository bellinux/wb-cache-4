NCOs are often {{used in conjunction with}} a digital-to-analog converter (DAC) at the output to create a direct digital synthesizer (DDS).|$|E

25|$|Knowing {{the quality}} of the signal channel is also critical. A channel {{emulator}} can simulate how a device performs at the cell edge, can add noise or can simulate what the channel looks like at speed. To fully qualify the performance of a receiver, a calibrated transmitter, such as a vector <b>signal</b> <b>generator</b> (VSG), and channel emulator can be used to test the receiver under a variety of different conditions. Conversely, the transmitter's performance under a number of different conditions can be verified using a channel emulator and a calibrated receiver, such as a vector signal analyzer (VSA).|$|E
50|$|RF (radio frequency) and {{microwave}} <b>signal</b> <b>generators</b> {{are used for}} testing components, receivers and test systems {{in a wide variety}} of applications including cellular communications, WiFi, WiMAX, GPS, audio and video broadcasting, satellite communications, radar and electronic warfare. RF {{and microwave}} <b>signal</b> <b>generators</b> normally have similar features and capabilities, but are differentiated by frequency range. RF <b>signal</b> <b>generators</b> typically range from a few kHz to 6 GHz, while microwave <b>signal</b> <b>generators</b> cover a much wider frequency range, from less than 1 MHz to at least 20 GHz. Some models go as high as 70 GHz with a direct coaxial output, and up to hundreds of GHz when used with external waveguide source modules. RF and microwave <b>signal</b> <b>generators</b> can be classified further as analog or vector <b>signal</b> <b>generators.</b>|$|R
50|$|Analog <b>signal</b> <b>generators</b> {{based on}} a sine-wave {{oscillator}} were common before the inception of digital electronics, and are still used. There was a sharp distinction in purpose and design of radio-frequency and audio-frequency <b>signal</b> <b>generators.</b>|$|R
50|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} types of <b>signal</b> <b>generators</b> with different purposes and applications and at varying levels of expense. These types include function generators, RF and microwave <b>signal</b> <b>generators,</b> pitch generators, arbitrary waveform generators, digital pattern generators and frequency generators. In general, no device is suitable for all possible applications.|$|R
25|$|Neurons of the {{arcuate nucleus}} secrete gonadotropin {{releasing}} hormone (GnRH) {{into the blood}} of the pituitary portal system. An American physiologist, Ernst Knobil, found that the GnRH signals from the hypothalamus induce pulsed secretion of LH (and to a lesser degree, FSH) at roughly 1-2 hour intervals. The LH pulses are the consequence of pulsatile GnRH secretion by the arcuate nucleus that, in turn, is the result of an oscillator or <b>signal</b> <b>generator</b> in the central nervous system ("GnRH pulse generator"). In the years preceding physical puberty, Robert M. Boyar discovered that the gonadotropin pulses occur only during sleep, but as puberty progresses they can be detected during the day. By the end of puberty, there is little day-night difference in the amplitude and frequency of gonadotropin pulses.|$|E
500|$|If {{isolation}} is high, directional couplers {{are good for}} combining signals to feed a single line to a receiver for two-tone receiver tests. [...] In figure 20, one signal enters port P3 and one enters port P2, while both exit port P1. [...] The signal from port P3 to port P1 will experience [...] of loss, and the signal from port P2 to port P1 will have [...] loss. [...] The internal load on the isolated port will dissipate the signal losses from port P3 and port P2. [...] If the isolators in figure 20 are neglected, the isolation measurement (port P2 to port P3) determines the amount of power from the <b>signal</b> <b>generator</b> F2 that will be injected into the <b>signal</b> <b>generator</b> F1. [...] As the injection level increases, it may cause modulation of <b>signal</b> <b>generator</b> F1, or even injection phase locking. [...] Because of the symmetry of the directional coupler, the reverse injection will happen with the same possible modulation problems of <b>signal</b> <b>generator</b> F2 by F1. [...] Therefore, the isolators are used in figure 20 to effectively increase the isolation (or directivity) of the directional coupler. [...] Consequently, the injection loss will be {{the isolation of the}} directional coupler plus the reverse isolation of the isolator.|$|E
500|$|Sound editor Bruce Tanis {{explained}} {{the production of}} sound {{that went into the}} episode in an interview with Designing Sound: [...] "In 'Fracture', the villain has created a serum which several characters inject because of a type of post-hypnotic suggestion. He has invented a frequency generator which causes these people to crystallize and then explode. In one of the best scenes all season, Walter and Astrid are in the lab and, using a watermelon for their experiments, are able to determine the exact frequency that the villain’s generator operates on. It was something like 68.7 megacycles (I don’t recall exactly), so I used the <b>signal</b> <b>generator</b> plugin and created some tones that started out as 68.7 megacycles. They were simply low-frequency tones on their own so I processed them so that they warbled and chorused and were a bit more mysterious than the straight tone. It ended up being pretty subtle for television, but when Walter identifies the tone as a certain frequency, that’s what’s actually playing." ...|$|E

[...] Subtractive synthesizers approximate instrumental sounds by a <b>signal</b> <b>generator</b> (producing sawtooth waves, square waves, etc.) followed by a filter. [...] The combination of simple modulation routings (such as pulse width modulation and oscillator sync), along with the lowpass filter, {{is responsible for the}} [...] "classic synthesizer" [...] sound commonly associated with [...] "analog synthesis." ...|$|E
2500|$|Active sonar {{creates a}} pulse of sound, often called a [...] "ping", and then listens for {{reflections}} (echo) of the pulse. This pulse of sound is generally created electronically using a sonar projector {{consisting of a}} <b>signal</b> <b>generator,</b> power amplifier and electro-acoustic transducer/array. A beamformer is usually employed to concentrate the acoustic power into a beam, which may be swept to cover the required search angles. Generally, the electro-acoustic transducers are of the Tonpilz type and their design may be optimised to achieve maximum efficiency over the widest bandwidth, in order to optimise performance of the overall system. Occasionally, the acoustic pulse may be created by other means, e.g. (1) chemically using explosives, or (2) airguns or (3) plasma sound sources.|$|E
2500|$|A {{wide range}} of {{instrumentation}} is used by electrical engineers. [...] For simple control circuits and alarms, a basic multimeter measuring voltage, current, and resistance may suffice. [...] Where time-varying signals need to be studied, the oscilloscope is also an ubiquitous instrument. [...] In RF engineering and high frequency telecommunications, spectrum analyzers and network analyzers are used. [...] In some disciplines, safety can be a particular concern with instrumentation. [...] For instance, medical electronics designers {{must take into account}} that much lower voltages than normal can be dangerous when electrodes are directly in contact with internal body fluids. Power transmission engineering also has great safety concerns due to the high voltages used; although voltmeters may in principle be similar to their low voltage equivalents, safety and calibration issues make them very different. [...] Many disciplines of electrical engineering use tests specific to their discipline. [...] Audio electronics engineers use audio test sets consisting of a <b>signal</b> <b>generator</b> and a meter, principally to measure level but also other parameters such as harmonic distortion and noise. [...] Likewise, information technology have their own test sets, often specific to a particular data format, and {{the same is true of}} television broadcasting.|$|E

2500|$|Each Galileo {{satellite}} has two master passive {{hydrogen maser}} atomic clocks and two secondary rubidium atomic clocks which {{are independent of}} one other. As precise and stable space-qualified atomic clocks are critical components to any satellite-navigation system, the employed quadruple redundancy keeps Galileo functioning when onboard atomic clocks fail in space. The onboard passive hydrogen maser clocks' precision is four times better than the onboard rubidium atomic clocks and estimated at 1 second per 3 million years (a timing error of a nanosecond or 1 billionth of a second (10−9 or 1/1,000,000,000 s) translates into a [...] positional error on Earth's surface), and will provide an accurate timing signal to allow a receiver to calculate {{the time that it}} takes the signal to reach it. The Galileo satellites are configured to run one hydrogen maser clock in primary mode and a rubidium clock as hot backup. Under normal conditions, the operating hydrogen maser clock produces the reference frequency from which the navigation signal is generated. Should the hydrogen maser encounter any problem, an instantaneous switchover to the rubidium clock would be performed. In case of a failure of the primary hydrogen maser the secondary hydrogen maser could be activated by the ground segment to take over within a period of days as part of the redundant system. A clock monitoring and control unit provides the interface between the four clocks and the navigation <b>signal</b> <b>generator</b> unit (NSU). It passes the signal from the active hydrogen master clock to the NSU and also ensures that the frequencies produced by the master clock and the active spare are in phase, so that the spare can take over instantly should the master clock fail. The NSU information is used to calculate the position of the receiver by trilaterating the difference in received signals from multiple satellites.|$|E
