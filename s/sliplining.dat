5000|$|<b>Sliplining</b> {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} methods for trenchless {{rehabilitation}} of existing pipelines. <b>Sliplining</b> is used to repair leaks or restore structural stability to an existing pipeline. <b>Sliplining</b> is completed by installing a smaller, [...] "carrier pipe" [...] into a larger [...] "host pipe", grouting the annular space between the two pipes, and sealing the ends. <b>Sliplining</b> has been used since the 1940s. [...] The most common material used to slipline an existing pipe is high-density polyethylene (HDPE), but fiberglass-reinforced pipe (FRP) and PVC are also common. [...] <b>Sliplining</b> can be used to stop infiltration and restore structural integrity to an existing pipe. The most common size is 0.20m - 1.5m (8"-60"), but <b>sliplining</b> can occur in any size given appropriate access and a new pipe small or large enough to install.|$|E
50|$|<b>Sliplining</b> is {{generally}} a very cost-effective rehabilitation method. It {{is also very}} easy to install and requires tools and equipment widely available to any pipeline contractor. Segmental <b>sliplining</b> may not require bypassing of the existing flow.|$|E
50|$|Segmental <b>sliplining</b> is {{very similar}} to {{continuous}} <b>sliplining.</b> The difference is primarily based on the pipe material used as the new carrier pipe. When using any bell and spigot pipe such as FRP, PVC, HDPE or Spirally Welded Steel Pipe, the individual pieces of pipe are lowered into place, pushed together, and pushed along the existing pipe corridor.|$|E
40|$|The wake {{behind a}} {{circular}} cylinder in Mach 4 flow is examined experimentally in the Reynolds number range 2 × 10 ^ 4 to 5 × 10 ^ 5. Periodic oscillations of the <b>sliplines</b> {{in the wake}} are observed. The Strouhal number of the oscillations based on {{the diameter of the}} cylinder is found to increase monotonically from 0. 30 to 0. 50 with increasing Reynolds number. If the Strouhal number is formed using the length of the <b>sliplines,</b> however, it has a constant value of approximately 0. 48 for all Reynolds numbers studied. This scaling indicates that the oscillations in supersonic flow are likely driven by acoustic signals propagating back and forth through the subsonic region between the separation points on the cylinder and the neck where the <b>sliplines</b> converge, unlike in subsonic flow where oscillations are caused by vortices shed from the cylinder surface...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the measured mechanical and thermal performances of an HDPE <b>sliplined</b> cast iron watermain, {{based on two}} and a half years of monitoring data. The 915 mm inside diameter watermain, constructed in 1916, was <b>sliplined</b> with a grouted annulus after 83 years of service. During its rehabilitation in 1999, strain gauges were installed on the inside surface of the existing cast iron pipe and on the outside surface of the inserted HDPE pipe. These sensors and a data acquisition system were used to collect field performance data. The measured data show that the HDPE pipe was subjected to only a small portion of the internal load and external loads in the grouted <b>sliplined</b> watermain. Thermal stress was the main stress component in the longitudinal direction. In addition, the measured soil temperature data indicate that frost penetrated faster in the granular backfill in the trench reinstatement than in the undisturbed silty sand fill and Stefan's formula gave a good prediction of the frost depth. The use of polystyrene insulation boards did not add any thermal protection in the trench reinstatement...|$|R
40|$|Plane stress <b>slipline</b> field solutions, {{which provide}} {{the modes of}} {{yielding}} and the corresponding yield loads, are presented for the plastic bending of end-loaded thin cantilevers of rectangular cross-section containing rectang-ular holes. The theoretical results obtained from these solutions are compared with some experimental results and those obtained from plane strain <b>slipline</b> fields and lower bound estimates, all presented previously by the authors (l) $ It is observed that the correlation of the experimental results was much better with the plane stress solutions than with either the plane strain or lower bound results. The effect of adjacent holes and possible lateral or local buckling on the ultimate strength of the cantilevers is also examined. ...|$|R
5000|$|Trenchless {{rehabilitation}} {{includes such}} construction methods as <b>sliplining,</b> thermoformed pipe, pipe bursting, shotcrete, gunite, cured-in-place pipe (CIPP), grout-in-place pipe, mechanical spot repair, and other methods for the repair, rehabilitation, or replacement of existing buried pipes and structures without excavation, {{or at least}} with minimal excavation. Mechanical spot repair is applied where damaged pipelines require the re-instatement of structural integrity. <b>Sliplining,</b> CIPP, and thermoformed pipe lining involve pulling or inverting a new liner into an existing pipe, then applying heat and/or pressure to force the liner to expand to fill the pipe. CIPP technologies combine a carrier (felt or fibreglass) impregnated with heat, ultraviolet light, or ambient curable resin to form a [...] "pipe within a pipe". Pipe bursting fractures a pipe from the inside and forces the fragments outwards while a new pipe is drawn in to replace the old. [...] The other methods are primarily for fixing spot leaks.Trenchless rehabilitation methods are generally more cost-effective than traditional exhume (dig) and replace methods.|$|E
50|$|Continuous <b>sliplining</b> uses a long {{continuous}} pipe, such as HDPE, Fusible PVC, or Welded Steel Pipe, {{that are}} connected into continuous pieces of any length prior to installation. The continuous carrier pipe is pulled through the existing host pipe starting at an insertion pit {{and continuing to}} a receiving pit. Either the insertion pit, the receiving pit, or both can be manholes or other existing access points if the size and material of the new carrier pipe can maneuver the existing facilities.|$|E
50|$|The new pipe will {{generally}} have a significantly reduced {{cross sectional area}} {{because of the size}} difference between the inside diameter of the existing pipe and the outside diameter of the new pipe, as well as the wall thickness of the new pipe. Sewer laterals must be reconnected via excavation. Note: laterals can be welded to liner w/o excavation if man entry size pipe. Installation usually requires excavation at the insertion and receiving pits. Continuous <b>sliplining</b> generally requires bypassing the existing flow. Note: Storm culverts are often installed without by pass pumping.|$|E

Similar to the both New Lagrangian formulation and Generalized Lagrangian formulation, the Orthogonal Lagrangian formulation employs the streamlines as coordinate lines that can inherits all advantages in the two former Lagrangian formulations; the crisp resolution of the <b>slipline,</b> shock resolution increasing by increasing mach number and no grid generation. Besides, the λ-coordinate is chosen to be orthogonal to the streamline axis which can minimize the well-posedness condition; M > 1. Together with the application of Shock-Adaptive scheme and the condition of conservation of entropy in smooth flow, the shock can be solved in infinite order of accuracy and the overshoot near the isolat, ed <b>slipline</b> is successfully eliminated.

40|$|As {{unfavorable}} {{economic conditions}} continue to linger, Maine DOT continues to explore means to improve fish and aquatic organism passage utilizing cost-effective structures {{while continuing to}} maintain its infrastructure {{for the safety of}} the travelling public. While Maine DOT concedes that these will not provide the greatest benefits to overall stream health, they are vast improvements to improving habitat connectivity for many resident fish species, providing successful upstream passage that allows upstream habitat to be once again accessible for a variety of life stages throughout Maine. Several structure types are discussed here, including a <b>sliplined</b> culvert with weirs in Belfast and composite-invertlined multi-plate structures with weirs in Amherst and Ebeemee Township. As with all success stories, there have been failures along the way, but Maine DOT continues to improve on its passage techniques by learning from its mistakes. Passage strategies that did not go quite as planned will be discussed, including an early invertline attempt incorporating fish passage in Blue Hill, a <b>slipline</b> project with weirs in Johnson Mountain Township, and an invertlined multi-plate culvert with weirs in Canton...|$|R

It represents an accurate and fast alternative to the existing Eulerian methods. Many computed examples are given...|$|R
5000|$|Except {{for very}} common sizes, liners {{are not usually}} stocked and must be made {{specifically}} for each project. CIPP requires bypass of the flow in the existing pipeline while the liner is being installed. The curing may take from one hour to 30 hours depending on pipe diameter and curing system (steam / water / uv) and must be carefully monitored, inspected, and tested. Obstructions in the existing pipeline, such as protruding laterals, must be removed prior to installation. Cost should be compared with similar methods such as Shotcrete, thermoformed pipe, close-fit pipe, spiral wound pipe and <b>sliplining</b> as these other methods can provide a similar design solution for similar or less cost in certain situations. CIPP must also be carefully monitored for release of chemical agents utilized in the reaction process for contamination downstream of rehabilitated pipes. The liner material used for common sizes is normally a felted fabric (non-woven) and does not go around bends well without wrinkling and going out of round on corners. Liners used for pipes with bends (particularly 100 mm pipes) are made from a woven fabric allowing it to go around bends with minimal wrinkling. The more flexible the liner, the more care {{needs to be taken}} during inversion to ensure the liner remains on the correct alignment. Once a line is repaired with the CIPP method, that line can no longer be cabled or snaked with a machine, it must be cleaned by method of Hydro jetting ( [...] AKA. high pressure water blasting) ...|$|E

The increased usage {{is due to}} higher traffic density, social and environmental impacts and high construction costs associated with open-cut techniques. This paper will explain the benefits of <b>sliplining</b> an existing culvert {{as well as the}} features the designer/installer should look for in a liner. Culvert sites that are suitable for this type of Trenchless technology will also be explored.

40|$|Annulus grouting, or non-grouting, {{is often}} the {{question}} {{in the minds of}} municipal engineers when considering trenchless <b>sliplining</b> technique for pipe rehabilitation. For ease of installation in <b>sliplining</b> rehabilitation, the outside diameter of the liner pipe is usually at least 10 % smaller than the inside diameter of the host pipe, resulting in an annular space (or annulus) between the two pipes. Currently the decision on annulus grouting is mainly based on its impact on construction and cost. Based on a three-year study on the performance of a sliplined water main in the City of Ottawa, the effect of the grout on the performance of slipline pipe is presented in this paper. The pros and cons are explained in terms of buckling resistance, potential shear failure at lateral connections, protection of liner pipe when the host pipe fails, load-carrying capacity and control of load-sharing. Furthermore, how grouting can be used to maximise the desired performance of slipline pipe, or to strengthen an existing culvert is suggested in the paper. This paper fits well with the theme of INFRA 2003 as it shares proven solutions to <b>sliplining</b> rehabilitation and promotes innovation in construction to maximize pipe performance...|$|E
40|$|The {{aerodynamic}} problems, {{involving the}} solution of the Euler equations of motion, are presently almost exclusively solved using an Euler formulation. This requires the generation of a spatial grid over which the problem is discretized. The grid generation process adds to the complexity to the problem being solved, {{especially in the case of}} complex body-shapes with flow discontinuities, such as shock waves and <b>sliplines.</b> ALso, the Euler formulation is difficult to use for the aerodynamic problems of unspecified geometry. A Lagrangian formulation permits to avoid the complexity of a grid generation while making it possible to obtain very accurate results. This Lagrangian formulation use the stream function and Lagrangian distance to represent the flow instead of the Cartesian coordinates. Thus, the streamlines become coordinate lines in the Lagrangian formulation, which can easily represent complex body-shapes and <b>sliplines,</b> and is also more suitable to solve complex problems involving bodies of unspecified geometry. This method was tested and validated against several test problems of specified geometry, including the supersonic flows with shock waves in a duct with a circular arc bump and past airfoils, as well as the flow in a nozzle. The solutions obtained with this Lagrangian method were found to be very accurate, displaying a high at a computational efficiency (actually providing second-order accuracy at a computational load of a first order solution). Then, this Lagrangian method has been used to solve several aerodynamic problems with geometrically-unspecified body-shape, such as (i) the determination of the geometry of a bump corresponding to a specified pressure distribution in supersonic flow, and (ii) the design of the geometry of a supersonic nozzle, based on the reflection-suppression condition, for a specified uniform flow at exit...|$|R
40|$|Application of the Godunov {{scheme to}} the Euler {{equations}} of gas dynamics {{based on the}} Eulerian formulation of flow smears discontinuities, <b>sliplines</b> especially, over several computational cells, while the accuracy in the smooth flow region is of the order (h), where h is the cell width. Based on the generalised Lagrangian formulation (GLF) of Hui at al., the Godunov scheme yields superior accuracy. By the use of coordinate streamlines in the GLF, the slip-line - itself a streamline - is resolved crisply. Infinite shock resolution is achieved through the splitting of shock-cells. An improved entropy-conservation formulation of the governing equations is also proposed for computations in smooth flow regions. Finally, {{the use of the}} GLF substantially simplifies the programming logic resulting in a very robust, accurate, and efficient scheme. (C) 1995 Academic Press, Inc...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a numerical simulation of a planar shock reflecting from a dusty wedge. For the problem considered (M = 10, Ow = 30 deg), a double-Mach reflection (DMR) with an embedded wall jet is formed. The dust/air mixture {{on the wall}} was modeled as a dense gas, thereby focusing on how the dust mass influences {{the dynamics of the}} flow. The flow field was calculated by means of a high-order Godunov scheme that solves the nonsteady equations of gasdynamics. An adaptive mesh technique was used to follow the details of the Mach stem region. Flow visualization showed that the <b>slipline</b> from the main triple point became unstable and rolled up into positive rotational structures, which were entrained in the outer region of the wall jet. In addition, the velocity field induced by these structures caused the wall shear layer to become unstable and roll up into negative rotational structures that entrained dust from the fluidized bed. Vortex structures from the two shear layers paired, thus forming a chaotic flo...|$|R

40|$|Although the {{majority}} {{length of a}} liner pipe in <b>sliplining</b> rehabilitation is installed without excavation, some portions of the pipe are installed by the open-cut method at locations where connections cannot be made otherwise. The pipe undergoes a sudden change in loading condition, bedding condition and pipe ring composition when it passes through installation pits. A thorough understanding of these changes and how they affect the behaviour and performance of the installed pipe is necessary for effective designs that lead to satisfactory long-term performance. This paper presents an analysis of trenched and trenchless portions of grouted and ungrouted sliplined pipes. Liner pipe materials investigated include HDPE, PVC and reinforced fibreglass. Comparison are made between the trenchless and the trenched portions of the liner pipe in terms of loading, responses to load, effect of bedding and service life. A critical length is defined for the trenched portion in which joints should be avoided, and a practical formula is proposed for determining the critical length.

40|$|A major {{challenge}} for {{society in the}} 21 st century will be replacement, design, and optimal management of urban infrastructure. It is estimated that the current worldwide demand for infrastructure investment is approximately three trillion dollars annually. A Drinking Water Infrastructure Needs Survey conducted by the U. S.

40|$|A field {{instrumentation}} system was successfully installed {{to monitor the}} performance of a HDPE <b>sliplined</b> 83 -year old 910 -mm diameter cast iron watermain in Ottawa. This monitoring system included various sensors to measure strains in both pipe walls, the internal hydrostatic pressure, the in-situ soil moisture contents and the temperature profiles in the soil backfill. The work included the insertion of sections of the HDPE pipe with sensors and cables attached during the rehabilitation of the entire 1. 5 -km water line. The installation therefore required the collaborative effort of the research team, the owner, the consultant and the general contractor for the rehabilitation project. About 50 % of the installed strain gauges and about 95 % of the installed thermocouples survived the installation process. The preliminary results based on the first four-month data show that the measured strain ranges in the HDPE pipe were within the ranges predicted using the short- and long-term modulus of elasticity of the HDPE material. The results have confirmed the assumption that bonding at the interfaces between the HDPE and the grout and between the grout and the cast iron pipe was negligible. The results also show that the granular "C" backfill material above the pipe had little insulation capacity and that the soil around the watermain is likely to freeze over the winter...|$|R
40|$|We {{present an}} {{experimental}} and numerical {{study of the}} flow fields in slow deformation of a granular ensemble, composed of hard spherical, monodisperse particles. The model system is that of indentation by a flat punch under approximately plane-strain conditions. In the experiments, the region around the punch is imaged in-situ using a high speed imaging system. Flow parameters such as spatial velocity and strain are characterized using a hybrid image analysis technique. The deformation field shows various interesting features that resemble the deformation fields in the indentation of both metals and fluids. The formation of a stagnant zone right under the punch is strikingly similar to the <b>slipline</b> field solution for plane-strain punch indentation in plastically deforming metals. Also, regions of highly rotational flow are observed {{in the vicinity of}} the punch, resembling vortices and recirculation zones past sharp corners in fluid flow. These features illustrate the complex microscopic mechanisms underlying the deformation of granular materials, which precludes precise analysis using simple continuum constitutive laws. To better understand the microscopic mechanisms, we present numerical simulations of punch indentation using the discrete particle non-smooth contact dynamics method. By modelling the particles as perfect rigid bodies with simple Coulomb friction, it is seen that the experimental flow patterns are reproduced semi-quantitatively. The full 3 D displacement field confirms the existence of local regions of non-zero vorticity and the formation of a stagnation zone under the punch. This simple model problem perhaps illustrates the difficulty involved in formulating a micromechanical description of the deformation, based on the connectivity of the grain network...|$|R
40|$|The work {{presented}} in this thesis is part of and continuation of the work {{carried out by the}} author on the Mechanics of Power Hacksawing, on behalf of a hacksaw blade manufacturer. Process parameters which influence the metal. removal rate during power hacksawing have been identified and thus a detailed explanation of the basic sawing mechanism-suggested. Power hacksaw machine characteristics have also been investigated. The problem of blade testing is discussed. A method for assessing the blade performance is proposed which is based on metal removal rate but is independent of the machine characteristics. This could be 'used as a quality index for power hacksaw blades. This performance index is found to vary with workpiece breadth and tooth pitch. A theoretical model is used to give some explanation of this variation. iiowever, there is evidence that the gullet size and goemetry arc, more significant factors influencing the variation in blade performance with changes in the breadth of the workpiece and pitch of the blade teeth. Examinations of saw blade teeth have revealed that they have large cutting edge radii compared to the layer of metal removed, indicating that saw blades are basically blunt tools. The cutting action of tools with large cutting edge radii has been investigated and extensive simulation tests have been undertaken. From the observations of the chip formation mechanism and measurements of the relative position of the tool and machined surface during cutting, some new light is thrown upon the ploughing process. A slip-line field is proposed which qualitatively represents the assumed chip formation mechanism under steady state cutting conditions. The application of an empirical relationship between the chip tool contact length and the undeformed chip thickness in conjunction with the <b>slipline</b> field, provides quantitative correlation with the test results of a single point tool and qualitative correlation with a hacksaw blade. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{urgent need}} to {{rehabilitate}} or replace ageing deteriorated buried potable water pipeline networks {{is one of the}} many critical service utility provision challenges faced within the municipalities in South Africa. The majority of these unreliable deteriorated pipeline networks consist of un-dipped (not coated with bitumen) AC piping which have long passed their planned economic and technical lifespan. Traditionally, the open trenching method has been utilised for the replacement of aged and deteriorated piping. However, this traditional open trenching method has shown to be expensive and difficult to implement, particularly in congested high traffic use urban areas. The need to rehabilitate or replace the ageing deteriorated buried potable water pipelines in South Africa, taking into account the above mentioned expensive factors has a solution. This solution is termed ‘trenchless technology ’ and sometimes also termed ‘no dig’.

40|$|The Region of Ottawa-Carleton {{chose the}} trenchless <b>sliplining</b> method to {{renovate}} its 915 -mm (36 ") diameter cast iron watermain under Gloucester Street, {{one of the}} busiest streets in downtown Ottawa. This paper describes the research aspect of this project, which comprises a performance assessment and implementation of performance monitoring instrumentation in the field. The performance assessment was carried out to obtain stresses under different loading and thermal conditions and service life expectancy. Both grouted and ungrouted options were evaluated and compared. Laboratory testing of specimens taken from an old cast iron pipe, a high density polyethylene (HDPE) pipe segment and grouted sliplined pipe sections were conducted. The assessment showed that a grouted pipe should perform better.

40|$|Rehabilitation of a watermain by grouted <b>sliplining</b> {{is usually}} carried {{out when the}} {{existing}} pipe is only partially deteriorated. Although designs that neglect the structural contributions from the existing pipe and the grout are generally conservative, {{the performance of the}} rehabilitated pipe needs to be better understood for effective design and management of buried water pipes. Presented in this paper is a practical method for the determination of load sharing and circumferential stresses in a sliplined pressure pipe. The laboratory tests show that the load carrying capacity of a cast iron pipe increases substantially after it is sliplined and grouted. Results also indicate that the eccentricity between the host pipe and the inserted pipe and the direction of eccentricity {{have an impact on the}} rupture load of the sliplined pipe. The effects of the host pipe wall thickness and the grout strength are also discussed.

40|$|Detonation {{waves are}} {{supersonic}} combustion waves {{that have a}} multi-shock front structure followed by a spatially non-uniform reaction zone. During propagation, a de-coupled shock-flame complex is periodically re-initiated into an overdriven detonation following a transient Mach reflection process. Past researchers have identified mechanisms that can increase combustion rates and cause localized hot spot re-ignition behind the Mach shock. But due to the small length scales and stochastic behaviour of detonation waves, the important mechanisms {{that can lead to}} re-initiation into a detonation requires further clarification. If a detonation is allowed to diffract behind an obstacle, it can quench to form a de-coupled shock-flame complex and if allowed to form a Mach reflection, re-initiation of a detonation can occur. The use of this approach permits the study of re-initiation mechanisms reproducibly with relatively large length scales. The objective {{of this study is to}} experimentally elucidate the key mechanisms that can increase chemical reaction rates and sequentially lead to re-initiation of a de-coupled shock-flame complex into an overdriven detonation wave following a Mach reflection. All experiments were carried out in a thin rectangular channel using a stoichiometric mixture of oxy-methane. Three different types of obstacles were used - a half-cylinder, a roughness plate along with the half-cylinder and a full-cylinder. Schlieren visualization was achieved by using a Z-configuration setup, a high speed camera and a high intensity light source. Results indicate that forward jetting of the slip line behind the Mach stem can potentially increase combustion rates by entraining hot burned gas into unburned gas. Following ignition and jet entrainment, a detonation wave first appears along the Mach stem. The transverse wave can form a detonation wave due to rapid combustion of unburned gas which may be attributed to shock interaction with the unburned gas. Alternatively, the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability can produce vortices along the <b>slipline</b> that may lead to mixing between burned-unburned gases and potentially increase combustion rates near the transverse wave. However, the mechanism(s) that causes the transverse wave to re-initiate into a detonation wave remains to be satisfactorily resolved...|$|R
40|$|A {{theoretical}} and experimental examination into {{the dynamics of}} granular solids has been completed which covers aspects of flow and failure within this material. The investigation {{is divided into three}} natural sections; each section being devoted to a different type of failure. As indicated by the title, the subject of the study was cohesionless soil, and thus the basic tenets of soil mechanics and the failure of granular media are applicable. The first section deals with gravity flow of non-cohesive granular material in both axial and rectangular geometry. Traditional plasticity theory is used to establish characteristics of stress and strain, also stress <b>sliplines</b> within a wedge. From these, two relationships between the angle of internal friction and the bound to a radial flow field are established. A minimum energy theory of flow is discussed and then used to determine mass flow rates. From this theory a velocity profile is deduced an by use of either the entire profile or the vertical ray or the extreme angular ray three relationships between the bound tot he radial flow field and the mass flow rate are established. The limits to piping in axial symmetry are defined. It is shown that gravity flow in rectangular geometry must always result in pipes. Experiments were devised to substantiate these findings and they show that, dependent upon the assumptions that were made, the devised relationships bracket, within reasonable limits, the radial bound and the mass flow rate. Work of two other investigators is compared wit the presented experimental results. The definitions of pipe are shown to have validity. Section Two was the result of an attempt to measure a parameter that was relevant to the investigation in Section Three. The possibility of the passive rather than the active lateral earth pressure acting upon a shifting retaining wall was discovered while attempting the measurement of the coefficient of friction of sand on mild steel. The third section is concerned with an investigation into the factors that affect the forces on a horizontally propelled model that is immersed in sand. The parameters of depth, speed, projected model area, and other model characteristics were varied, and experimental relationships between the force and these parameters determined. Also, pressure measurements were made within the sand as the model passed {{to determine the extent of}} the failure region. Several other experiments, such as the effect of false walls on the force level, were made in order to determine the limits of validity of the main experiment. It was found that the force on the model varied as the 2. 3 power of the depth, linearly with the projected model area, and not at all with model surface, model length, or speed in the range 0 - 15 feet per minute. The pressure measurements and false-walls studies showed that failure occurred within the sand and not at the walls of the tank; also that failure took the form of successive shear dislocation of pyramidally shaped wedges of sand...|$|R
