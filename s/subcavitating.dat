40|$|WOSInternational audienceAtranspirationvelocitybased partial sheet cavitationmodel has {{previously}} been successfully validated when implemented within potential flow codes. The model is independent from any solver and permits to estimate the cavity length based on the <b>subcavitating</b> pressure distribution. This paper presents its implementation within a Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes Equations solver. In order to compare {{the results of the}} implementation, experimental measurements on a 2 D hydrofoil and potential flow code results are used. Several stages are covered. First the geometries of the cavitation sheets computed with the potential flow code are imposed with a slippery boundary condition on its surface into the RANSE simulation. The results obtained are in very good agreement with the previous validated results. In the second stage, the Volume of Fluid module is activated and water vapour is ejected from the foil surface and the transpirationvelocities are computed with the potential flow code. The results are similar but the length of the cavitation closure is much shorter. Finally, the model is fully implemented within the RANSEsolver. The transpirationvelocities are computed using the model from the <b>subcavitating</b> pressure distribution. They are then applied on the foil surface as water vapour. The results are quasi-identical to the results obtained when the transpirationvelocities are taken from the potential flow code. The paper proves the feasibility of modelling the cavitation sheet using transpirationvelocities and VOF within aRANSEsolver...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to investigate cavitating flows around a pitching hydrofoil via combined physical and numerical studies. The aims are to (1) improve the understanding of the interplay between unsteady cavitating flow, hydrofoil motion, and hydrodynamic performance, (2) quantify the influence of pitching rate on <b>subcavitating</b> and cavitating responses, and (3) quantify the influence of cavitation on the hydrodynamic load coefficients and surrounding flow structures. Results are presented for a NACA 66 hydrofoil undergoing controlled, slow (α̇ = 6 ∘/s) and fast (α̇ = 63 ∘/s) pitching motions from α = 0 ° to α = 15 ° and back to α = 0 ° for both <b>subcavitating</b> and cavitating conditions at a moderate Reynolds number of Re = 750 [*] 000. The experimental studies were conducted in a cavitation tunnel at the French Naval Academy, France. The numerical simulations are performed by solving the incompressible, multiphase Unsteady Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes Equations via the commercial code CFX using a transport equation-based cavitation model; a modified k-ω SST turbulence model is used to account for the effect of local compressibility on the turbulent eddy viscosity. The results showed that increases in the pitching rate suppressed laminar to turbulent transition, delayed stall, and significantly modified post-stall behavior. Cavitation inception at the leading edge modified the pressure distribution, which in turn significantly changed the interaction between leading edge and trailing edge vortices, and hence the magnitude as well as the frequency of the load fluctuations. For a fixed cavitation number, increases in pitching rate lead to increase in cavitation volume, which in turn changed the cavity shedding frequencies and significantly modified the hydrodynamic loads. Inversely, the leading edge cavitation observed for the low pitching velocity case tends to stabilize the stall because of the decrease of the pressure gradient due to the formation of the cavity. The results showed strong correlation between the cavity and vorticity structures, which suggest that the inception, growth, collapse and shedding of sheet/cloud cavities are important mechanisms for vorticity production and modification...|$|E
40|$|A {{partially}} submerged propeller {{theory was}} developed by employing a singularity distribution method. Unsteady pressure doublets and pressure sources represented the blade camber and blade-and-cavity thickness respectively. The induced velocities were derived by reducing the formula to a lifting-line configuration. The free-surface effect was considered by use of the image method. The induced velocities contained the singular integrals of 5 th order, which are usually numerical unstable. An {{effort was made to}} derive numerically stable formulae from these singular equations by applying a method similar to the induction-factor method of Morgan & Wrench (1965) and Lerbs (1952) used for steady-state fully wetted propeller problems. These new formulae are not only applicable to the present partially submerged ventilated propeller problem, but also to general unsteady <b>subcavitating</b> and cavitating propeller problems such as propeller starting-up and non-periodic loading problems. By combining the two-dimensional water entry-and-exit theory of Wang (1979), the thrust and torque coefficients were calculated for representative partially submerged propellers and favourably compared with the experimental data...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to apply combined experimental and computational modeling to investigate unsteady sheet/cloud cavitating flows. In the numerical simulations, a filter-based density corrected model (FBDCM) is introduced to regulate the turbulent eddy viscosity in both the cavitation regions on the foil and in the wake, which is shown to be critical in accurately capturing the unsteady cavity shedding process, and the corresponding velocity and vorticity dynamics. In the experiments, high-speed video and particle image velocimetry (PIV) technique are used to measure the flow velocity and vorticity fields, as well as cavitation patterns. Results are presented for a Clark-Y hydrofoil fixed at an angle of attack of α = 8 deg at a moderate Reynolds number, Re = 7 × 105, for both <b>subcavitating</b> and sheet/cloud cavitating conditions. The results show that for the unsteady sheet/cloud cavitating case, the formation, breakup, shedding, and collapse of the sheet/cloud cavity lead to substantial increase in turbulent velocity fluctuations in the cavitating region around the foil and in the wake, and significantly modified the wake patterns. The turbulent boundary layer thickness is found to be much thicker, and the turbulent intensities are much higher in the sheet/cloud cavitating case. Compared to the wetted case, the wake region becomes much broader and is directed toward the suction side instead of the pressure side for the sheet/cloud cavitation case. The periodic formation, breakup, shedding, and collapse of the sheet/cloud cavities, and the associated baroclinic and viscoclinic torques, are shown to be important mechanisms for vorticity production and modification.

40|$|Traditional {{propellers}} operate fully submerged, with cavitation limited as much {{as possible}} in order to minimize its disruptive and damaging consequences. Conversely, supercavitating propellers operate in an encompassing vapor cavity, thereby averting these negative effects while substantially reducing drag on the blades. Surface-piercing propellers, operating under a similar concept as supercavitation, often achieve even greater efficiency by drawing in an air cavity from the free surface. Existing small craft have demonstrated the ability of such propellers to yield extremely high speeds (110 + knots); nevertheless, the full potential of these propellers has yet to be explored. In particular, designs often neglect low-speed performance, focusing solely on high-speed operation. This research therefore developed a new surface-piercing propeller concept designed instead to maximize performance across the spectrum of operating speeds. Applying established theory for supercavitating hydrofoils, the new blades were shaped based on theoretical maximally-efficient two-dimensional profile sections. Furthermore, in order to affect the low-speed performance enhancement, the trailing edge of each profile was appended with a unique "tail" form that allows the blade to resemble a traditional propeller when operating at <b>subcavitating</b> speeds without sacrificing supercavitating performance. The design used an existing racing propeller as a baseline for comparison, matching certain characteristics (rotational speed, advance speed, number of blades, hub size) in order to ensure equivalent operating conditions. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) of the 2 D profiles informed changes to the profile shapes until lift-to-drag (L/D) was maximized while ensuring a fully-encompassing vapor cavity. The complete propeller was drafted from these optimized radial sections for full 3 D CFD analysis. Results from both the 2 D and 3 D CFD simulations revealed promising benefits to propulsive efficiency. High-speed performance met or exceeded that of the baseline propeller, and low-speed performance showed significant improvement. This surface-piercing propeller concept offers an unconventional design with convincing results for balanced low- and high-speed operation. by Justin Richard Parker. Thesis: Nav.
