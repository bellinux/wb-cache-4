40|$|Stable {{nitrogen}} isotope ratios (δ 15 N) {{of freshwater}} mussels {{from a series}} of lakes and ponds were related to watershed land use characteristics to assess their utility in determining the source of nitrogen inputs to inland water bodies. Nitrogen isotope ratios measured in freshwater mussels from 19 lakes and ponds in Rhode Island, U. S. A., ranged from 4. 9 – 12. 6 % and were found to significantly correlate with the fraction of residential development in 100 and 200 m buffer zones around the ponds. Mussel δ 15 N values in 12 of the 19 ponds also showed significant correlation with average dissolved nitrate concentrations, which ranged from 23 – 327 μg L- 1. These observations, in light of previous studies which link elevated δ 15 N values of nitrogen derived from <b>septic</b> <b>wastewater</b> with those seen in biota, suggest that mussel isotope ratios may reflect nitrogen source in freshwater ecosystems. We followed an iterative approach using multiple regression analysis to assess the relationship between mussel δ 15 N and the land use categories fraction residential development, fraction feedlot agriculture, fraction row-crop agriculture, and fraction natural vegetation in 100 and 200 m buffer zones and pond watersheds. From this we developed a simple regression model to predict mussel δ 15 N from the fraction of residential development in the 200 m buffer zone around the pond. Subsequent testing with data from 16 additional sites in the same ecoregion led us to refine the model by incorporating the fraction of natural vegetation. The overall average absolute difference between measured and predicted δ 15 N values using the two-parameter model was 1. 6 %. Potential sources of error in the model include differences in the scale and categorization of land-use data used to generate and test the model, differences in physical characteristics, such as retention time and range of residential development, and exclusion of sources of enriched nitrogen such as runoff from feedlot operations or increased nitrogen loading from inefficient or failed septic systems...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages [211]- 214) Campton Township is {{a rapidly}} growing rural community located in the central portion of Kane County in northeast Illinois. The township consists of large residential areas, small businesses, and farmland which border the western suburbs of Chicago. Since most of the area is {{beyond the reach of}} municipal sewer networks, individual septic systems are used extensively throughout the township to dispose of sewage produced by each household. The majority of residential water wells in Campton Township are located in close proximity to the septic absorption fields and obtain water from the Prairie Aquigroup or the Alexandrian-Maquoketa aquifer. The Alexandrian-Maquoketa aquifer is composed predominantly of the Maquoketa Shale Group, which includes relatively impermeable Ordovician age shales, permeable argillaceous dolomites, and minor limestones. Thin, laterally discontinuous Alexandrian units overlie the Maquoketa Shale Group and are made up almost entirely of fine-grained dolomites. Overlying the irregular bedrock surface, the Prairie Aquigroup includes all of the unconsolidated glacial drift, sand and gravel, alluvium, and other Holocene sediments. These locally confined units are recharged by precipitation and are in close hydraulic connection with the bedrock. A basic geochemical and hydrogeologic analysis was focused on these aquifers and used to gain information about the effects of septic systems on groundwater quality. Water samples were taken during two sampling periods, including a short reconnaissance sampling of groundwater and surface water and a second larger sampling of groundwater. ABSTRACT These samples were field screened for pH, Eh, temperature, conductivity, and dissolved oxygen and analyzed in the laboratory for nitrate-nitrogen, nitrite-nitrogen, ammonianitrogen, alkalinity, sulfate, chloride, calcium, magnesium, iron, manganese, strontium, potassium, and sodium. Concentrations of these constituents, along with X-Y plots, geochemical concentration maps, and existing well information were used to make interpretations about the geochemical system. The analysis indicated that the general groundwater flow direction in the township is from west to east and water level elevations display local recharge and dewatering patterns. The Prairie Aquigroup and Alexandrian- Maquoketa aquifer are hydraulically connected through recharge and the groundwater in both aquifer zones is very similar in general composition. Several ion sources, along with localized groundwater flow and preferential flow paths, create differences in chemical concentration patterns between the two aquifer zones. Although plumes of high chemical concentrations in the direction of groundwater flow such as those found in related studies are not strongly defined in spatial plots of the analytes, relatively high concentrations of ammonia-nitrogen in the deeper groundwater indicate that septic systems are a likely contributor to the geochemical system. A limited supply of available oxygen most likely contributes to incomplete aerobic treatment of <b>septic</b> <b>wastewater</b> and agriculturally impacted soil water as it travels into the deeper groundwater system. A limited amount of nitrification occurs to produce relatively high concentrations of nitrate and nitrite in areas of the shallow aquifer zone. Denitrification transforms almost all of the nitrate to ammonium and ammonia under the anoxic conditions found in the deeper groundwater. If inadequate aerobic conditions persist in the shallow groundwater zones, they have the potential to cause severe clogging in septic absorption fields in the area and increasingly poor wastewater treatment over time.

40|$|The Nottawasaga River Watershed is {{host to the}} Lake Algonquin Sand Aquifer (LASA), an {{unconfined}} aquifer {{that consists}} of glaciolacustrine sands and provides water supply to rural residents, for household use, and for applications in agriculture. Previous studies, conducted between 1979 and 1983, measured nitrate in the LASA, and found concentrations that greatly exceeded the drinking water limit (10 mgN/L) and were measured as high as 103 mgN/L (Hill, 1982; Starr, et al., 1987). In these studies, groundwater was tested in domestic wells, groundwater seeps, and multi-level wells situated among agricultural fields. The historically high nitrate in the LASA was linked to agricultural activities, specifically those most focused on potato farming (Hill, 1982). Further to this, a lack of labile organic carbon (LOC) in the aquifer sediments, which acts as an electron donor for denitrification, the natural N cycling process responsible for converting nitrate to harmless N 2 gas (Starr & Gillham, 1993). As part of the current study, nitrate was measured in domestic wells, groundwater seeps, and multi-level wells in 2010 and 2011, to compare the relative change in nitrate in the LASA over that past ~ 30 years. Statistical differences between the historical and current sample groups were evaluated using a Mann-Whitney rank-sum test for the domestic wells and groundwater seeps. Both of the groups were statistically different between the two dates, however, domestic wells were lower and groundwater seeps were higher, in nitrate. Multi-level wells showed varied results for comparing nitrate with those sampled in 1982 and 1983. Samples within a few meters of the water table had the most distinct changes in nitrate, whereas samples at depth were relatively similar. Increases in nitrate in MC 2 {{could be attributed to}} the removal of a woodlot and subsequent cultivation which occurred in 2005. The depression of the water table also resulted in a change in the source for set sample points in MC 4 and resulted in lower groundwater nitrate than historically measured. The depression of the water table also introduced oxygen and nitrate rich waters to greater depths below the ground surface than what was previously measured. Overall, the mean concentration of nitrate in the multi-level wells was less than the historical data. The decrease in nitrate for the domestic wells and multi-level wells might be related to changes in land management practices over the past three decades. Source identification for nitrate was constrained with the use of nitrate isotope ratios and artificial sweeteners. Domestic wells, groundwater seeps, and multi-level wells were all dominantly identified as nitrified chemical fertilizer, according to the dual isotope plot of nitrate. Artificial sweeteners were detected in 31 % and 35 % of the domestic wells and groundwater seeps, respectively, and were excellent tracers for <b>septic</b> <b>wastewater.</b> Further investigation into the proportion of nitrate derived from wastewater showed that septic systems contributed poorly to the nitrate pool in the LASA. Oxic conditions extended several meters below the water table in the LASA and provided conditions where nitrate could exist at high concentrations. Nitrate removal via denitrification was evident in all datasets, however it was often incomplete and did not remove nitrate entirely. The production of N 2 O in domestic wells and multi-level wells was generally attributed to denitrification in oxygenated groundwaters. In domestic wells, where nitrate was not present, and at the deepest sample points in the multi-level wells, redox conditions were classified having undergone nitrate, sulfate, and iron reduction. However, multi-level well data outlines that this occurs at depths of at least 15 m below the water table. Groundwater seeps were less reduced and did not show evidence for sulfate or iron reduction. Therefore, the capacity of the aquifer to remove nitrate is not sufficient to cope with the amount of nitrate leached from agricultural practices...|$|E

30|$|Many {{studies have}} {{attempted}} to identify the sources and the land use practices that cause nutrient overload in Florida’s springs and lakes. In general, most of them state that common sources of nitrate include fertilizers and organic waste that originate from areas of livestock, <b>septic</b> tanks, and <b>wastewater</b> treatment plants. For example, in their study on the nonpoint source pollution in Lower St. Marks–Wakulla River Watershed in Florida, Chelette et al. (2002) cite on-site disposal systems such as septic tanks and cesspits, livestock and commercial fertilizers to explain a threefold increase in total nitrate discharged from the Wakulla springs in the last 25  years. In a later study of the Wakulla Springs area, Eller and Katz (2014) report that septic tanks contribute more nitrogen to groundwater, comprising 51 % of the total nitrogen loads. They cite farm fertilizer as the leading source of nitrogen {{in areas where the}} Floridan aquifer is confined. Similarly, in their study on the nitrate concentration within the Suwannee River Water Management District, Upchurch et al. (2007) cite two major sources of nitrogen: (1) application of fertilizers to cropland, i.e., land use practices such as row crops, pastures, and groves, and turf such as lawns and golf courses, and (2) animal wastes, including wastes from feedlots, <b>septic</b> tanks, <b>wastewater</b> treatment, and other sources.|$|R

Prior to urbanization groundwater is recharged by rainfall-runoff and snowmelt infiltrating through pervious surfaces including grasslands and woods. This infiltrating water is relatively uncontaminated. Urbanization, however, reduces the permeable soil surface area through which recharge by infiltration occurs. This results in much less groundwater recharge and greatly increased surface runoff. In addition the waters available for recharge carry increased quantities of pollutants.

40|$|Onsite {{wastewater}} treatment systems {{are common in}} rural and semi-rural areas around the world; in the US, about 25 – 30 % of households are served by a <b>septic</b> (onsite) <b>wastewater</b> treatment system, and many property owners also operate their own domestic well nearby. Site-specific conditions and local groundwater flow are often ignored when installing septic systems and wells. In areas with small lots (thus high spatial septic system densities), shallow domestic wells are prone to contamination by septic system leachate. Mass balance approaches {{have been used to}} determine a maximum septic system density that would prevent contamination of groundwater resources. In this study, a source area model based on detailed groundwater flow and transport modeling is applied for a stochastic analysis of domestic well contamination by septic leachate. Specifically, we determine the probability that a source area overlaps with a septic system drainfield as a function of aquifer properties, septic system density and drainfield size. We show that high spatial septic system density poses a high probability of pumping septic system leachate. The hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer has a strong influence on the intersection probability. We find that mass balance calculations applied on a regional scale underestimate the contamination risk of individual drinking water wells by septic systems. This is particularly relevant for contaminants released at high concentrations, for substances that experience limited attenuation, and those that are harmful even at low concentrations (e. g., pathogens) ...|$|R

30|$|Groundwater {{quality is}} {{important}} for determining its use for domestic, irrigation and industrial purposes. It is however, degraded by several factors related to human activities and geochemical changes. In floodplain areas degradation generally occurs owing to hydrogeochemical processes, arsenic contamination, aerosols deposited on the top soil and interaction of groundwater with brines and sedimentary formation (Sanford et al. 2007). Hydrogeochemical processes {{that are responsible for}} changing the chemical composition of groundwater differ due to variation of time and space. In fact, interaction of groundwater with aquifer minerals significantly influences the groundwater chemistry. However, the study of hydrogeochemical processes of the groundwater system helps to obtain the contributions of rock/soil–water interaction in aquifer. The geochemical processes are responsible for the spatio-temporal variations in groundwater chemistry (Kelly 1940; Wilcox 1948; Matthess 1982; Kumar et al. 2006). Apart from the natural process, anthropogenic contaminations such as industrial effluents, agrochemicals, municipal <b>wastewater,</b> <b>septic</b> tank effluent and landfills are other major sources of water quality deterioration (Mondal et al. 2008, 2011; Selvam et al. 2013).|$|R

In order to achieve the objective, a detailed description of past and current building control systems operating in Ireland is presented. Phenomenal growth was recorded in the construction industry between 2000 and 2007. This period saw the construction of new housing units peak at 93, 000 in 2006. Unfortunately, this increase in output was associated with a decrease in the standard of building work being carried out. Many attribute this fall in standards to the inadequate building control system in place. This system did little by way of protecting the Irish consumer. This sub-standard method of building control led to the reputation of the construction industry being irreparably damaged as builders and other professionals failed to work in a manner of compliance and accountability. This culture of non-compliance resulted in many publicised cases involving defective materials and unsatisfactory workmanship.

This suggests that fluoride in the groundwater come from fluoride-bearing minerals such as CaF 2 (fluorite). Maps were drawn to show the geographical distribution of EC, Ca 2 +, Mg 2 +and F-. Factor analysis and cluster analysis were applied to the dataset. Factor analysis resulted in four factors explained 76. 90 % of the total groundwater quality variance. Factor 1 (hardness of the groundwater) includes total hardness, the concentration of K+, Ca 2 + and pH. Factor 2 (low mineralization of the groundwater) includes concentrations of TDS, Cl [...] , SO 42 + and EC. Factor 3 (anthropogenic activities {{with the impact of}} agricultural fertilizers, farming activities, domestic <b>wastewater,</b> <b>septic</b> tanks) includes concentrations of Na+ and NO 3 -. Factor 4 (weathering of calcium minerals) includes concentrations of F-. For cluster analysis, Ward’s method and the Euclidean distance were used. The findings of the cluster analysis are presented in the form of dendrogram of the well water sites (cases). The discriminating parameters between clusters have been highlighted from the Student test. In majority, they are in accordance with those highlighted by factor analysis...|$|R
40|$|One-quarter of U. S. {{households}} use a <b>septic</b> {{system for}} <b>wastewater</b> disposal. In {{this study we}} investigated whether septic system density was associated with endemic diarrheal illness in children. Cases [...] children 1 to < 19 years old seeking medical care for acute diarrhea [...] and controls resided in the Marshfield Epidemiologic Study Area, a population-based cohort in central Wisconsin. Enrollment was from February 1997 through September 1998. Study participants completed a structured interview, and septic system density was determined from county sanitary permits. Household wells were sampled for bacterial pathogens and indicators of water sanitary quality. Risk factors were assessed for cases grouped by diarrhea etiology. In multivariate analyses, viral diarrhea {{was associated with the}} number of holding tank septic systems in the 640 -acre section surrounding the case residence [adjusted odds ratio (AOR), 1. 08; 95 % confidence interval (CI), 1. 02 - 1. 15; p = 0. 008], and bacterial diarrhea was associated with the number of holding tanks per 40 -acre quarter-quarter section (AOR, 1. 22; 95 % CI, 1. 02 - 1. 46; p = 0. 026). Diarrhea of unknown etiology was independently associated with drinking from a household well contaminated with fecal enterococci (AOR, 6. 18; 95 % CI, 1. 22 - 31. 46; p = 0. 028). Septic system densities were associated with endemic diarrheal illness in central Wisconsin. The association should be investigated in other regions, and standards for septic systems should be evaluated to ensure that the public health is protected...|$|R
40|$|Background & Objectives: Nitrate and nitrite {{compounds}} {{pollution of}} groundwater resources {{in recent years}} which recently their mean concentration due to enhancement of different kind of municipal, industrial and agriculture waste water, were increased. The most common source of nitrates entering the water include chemical fertilizers and animal manure in agriculture, <b>septic</b> tank effluent, <b>wastewater,</b> wastewater treatment plants, animal and plant residue analysis on the ground of non-sanitary disposal of solid waste {{and the use of}} absorbing wells for sewage disposal. Materials and methods: This experimental study is applied to the nitrate removal using chitosan in laboratory scale at ambient temperature and the design of the system was Batch. Effects of parameters such as pH, contact time, initial concentration and adsorbent concentration of nitrate on nitrate removal from aqueous solution was studied. Results: Function of chitosan in synthetic aqueous solution and drinking water according to the slurry system results, the optimum condition was obtained at pH= 4, 20 min contact time and increasing the initial concentration of nitrate enhance the adsorption capacity of chitosan. Also optimum dosage of adsorbent was obtained at 0. 5 g/l. The data obtained from the experiments of adsorbent isotherm were analyzed using Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm models. The Langmuir equation was found to be the best fitness with the experimental data (R 2 > 0. 93). Conclusion: Although efficiency of Nitrate removal in synthetic aqueous solution was better than drinking water, adsorption process using chitosan as an option for the design and selection nitrate removal should be considered in order to achieve environmental standards...|$|R
40|$|Many small {{communities}} depend on groundwater sources for {{drinking water and}} they often use <b>septic</b> tanks for <b>wastewater</b> treatment and disposal. Nitrate and other pollutants leaking from poorly designed septic tank systems can percolate to the aquifers and alter quality of the groundwater. This study describes a groundwater model developed using Visual MODFLOW for an aquifer that {{is used as a}} water supply source for the communities of Beaumont and Cherry Valley, CA. The aquifer has been contaminated by nitrates leaking from septic tank systems. The model will assist in clarifying the extent of interactions between nitrate pollutants, percolation from a recently established series of artificial recharge ponds, natural groundwater recharge, and production wells. The primary objective of the study is to evaluate alternative hydraulic solutions that would limit the movement of contaminants and minimize the risk of polluting production wells. The study will identify artificial recharge scenarios that would limit movement of the nitrates so that polluted waters may be remediated in the future, rather than allowed to encroach on critical production wells or forced away from production wells to become a problem for future generations or neighboring areas. The data needed to build the model including geological logs, aquifer properties, hydrologic data, well locations, pumping schedules, water levels and septic tank density have been collected from various sources. The groundwater model is calibrated to accurately simulate observed groundwater levels and the extent of pollution corresponding to historical pumping rates, recharge rates and climate. The calibrated model is used to evaluate alternative hydraulic solutions that would localize the nitrate pollutions thus limiting impact on public welfare...|$|R
40|$|For over 20 years, peat {{has been}} {{recognized}} as a potential biosorbent {{for the treatment of}} wastewaters. Several studies {{have been reported in the}} literature including its use in cleaning oil spills(1) the removal of heavy metals from wastewaters(2) the removal of herbicides(3), the treatment of slaughterhouse <b>wastewaters,</b> <b>septic</b> tank effluents and dairy wastes(4) The ability of peat to remove several dyes from aqueous effluent was reported some time ago(5). Further studies on single component adsorption of basic and acid dyes were carried out to study equilibrium isotherms(6) diffusion based mass transport processes for batch and fixed bed systems(7). Carbon has been used for acid dyes in fixed beds(8). However, in these previous studies, conventional simplified design methods-namely, bed depth service time (BDST) and empty bed residence time (EBRT) models-were applied to the experimental breakthrough curve data but failed to correlate these data due to the non-linearity of the BDST versus bed height data obtained. In the present paper new modifications have been developed based on an expression, N-t/N- 0 = 1 - exp(-a{*}sqrt(t)), where N-t, N- 0, a, t represent the bed capacity at service time t, the saturated bed capacity found in isotherm experiments, a rate constant and the service time of the bed respectively. The expression correlates the residence time in the adsorption bed with the time dependent fraction degree of saturation of the bed. It enables modified BDST and EBRT models to be applied and correlate the experimental data very accurately. This model is particularly suited to predicting the performance of fixed bed adsorbers, when the system requires a long time to reach equilibrium or when several fixed bed adsorbers are used in series...|$|R
40|$|Across the U. S., {{engineers}} {{call for}} the use of aggregate (usually rock chips called gravel, most often crushed limestone) in association with onsite wastewater systems in many capacities. Gravel is the most common media used in soil absorption trenches. Gravel and sand are the main elements in subsurface-flow constructed wet-lands. There are many advan-tages to using rock chips in these situations; it is generally avail-able and reasonably priced. But there are regions of the country where gravel is scarce, therefore expensive, and existing supplies are being used up by the con-struction industry, thus the hunt for alternative materials for use with onsite systems. ore than one-fourth of all American homes use some type of onsite wastewater treatment system, and thousands of new onsite permits are issued each year. The most common sys-tem involves a watertight septic tank followed by a conventional subsurface soil absorption system. Soil has a considerable capacity to transform and recycle waste-water. Subsurface soil absorption systems are reliable and the least expensive disposal option. <b>Septic</b> systems are <b>wastewater</b> treatment systems that collect, treat, and dispose of wastewater generated by homes or business-es. Inadequate treatment of sewage allows bacteria, viruses, and other disease-causing pathogens to enter surface and groundwater. The conventional septic system consists of two main parts: a sep-tic tank and a soil absorption sys-tem, also known as the drainfield. The drainfield pro-vides the final step in the waste-water treatment process. A standard field is a series of trenches or a bed lined with crushed stone or gravel and buried one to three feet below the ground surface. Perforated pipes or drain tiles run through the trenches to distribute the waste-water onto the aggregate. See the diagram at right...|$|R
