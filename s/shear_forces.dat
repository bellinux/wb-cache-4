The instrumentation of the imaging {{system and the}} key techniques such as the bimorph-based non-optical <b>shear</b> <b>force</b> sensor design and the fabrication of optical fiber probes used in this SNOM are described in details. Then the good performance of the system is demonstrated by various experiments such as <b>shear</b> <b>force</b> imaging, near-field optical imaging, surface plasmon resonance detection, and near-field spectroscopy. The imaging and spectroscopic experimental results suggest that this home-made SNOM and bimorph-based <b>shear</b> <b>force</b> detection method would be promising techniques to be used in a variety of nanomaterials research and their optical applications.

That is, the moment is the integral of the <b>shear</b> <b>force.</b> If the <b>shear</b> <b>force</b> is constant over an interval, the moment equation will be in terms of x (linear).

40|$|We used an {{electric}} belt grill, a forced-air convection oven, and {{an electric}} broiler to cook 170 bottom round, 142 brisket, 177 top sirloin, 176 strip loin, and 136 eye of round steaks from USDA Select carcasses {{to determine the}} effects of cooking method and muscle on <b>shear</b> <b>force</b> values, cooking traits, and repeatability of duplicate measurements. All cooking treatments allowed differences to be detected (P< 0. 05) in Warner-Bratzler <b>shear</b> <b>force,</b> although the differences were inconsistent. <b>Shear</b> <b>force</b> values of strip steaks and eye of round steaks were similar across cooking treatments; however, <b>shear</b> <b>force</b> values of bottom round, brisket, and top sirloin steaks were different (P< 0. 05) among cooking treatments. Based on poor repeatability, <b>shear</b> <b>force</b> values for top sirloin steaks appear unreliable. Poor repeatability for <b>shear</b> <b>force</b> values from steaks cooked by the forced-air convection oven are a result of drastic temperature changes that occur when the doors are opened to remove steaks. We do not recommend using a forced-air convection oven to test treatment effects on <b>shear</b> <b>force</b> values when cooking multiple steaks simultaneously. Belt grill cooking resulted in the highest <b>shear</b> <b>force</b> repeatability R = 0. 07 to 0. 89) of strip steaks.

25|$|The nanocellulose fibrils may be {{isolated}} from the wood-based fibers using mechanical methods which expose the pulp to high <b>shear</b> <b>forces,</b> ripping the larger wood-fibres apart into nanofibers. For this purpose, high-pressure homogenizers, ultrasonic homogenizers, grinders or microfluidizers can be used. The homogenizers are used to delaminate the cell walls of the fibers and liberate the nanosized fibrils. This process consumes very large amounts of energy and values over 30 MWh/tonne are not uncommon.|$|E
25|$|The gel is thus {{interpreted}} as an elastic continuum, which deforms when subjected to externally applied <b>shear</b> <b>forces,</b> but is incompressible upon application of hydrostatic pressure. This combination of fluidity and rigidity is {{explained in terms of}} the gel structure: that of a liquid contained within a fibrous polymer network or matrix by the extremely large friction between the liquid and the fiber or polymer network. Thermal fluctuations may produce infinitesimal expansion or contraction within the network, and the evolution of such fluctuations will ultimately determine the molecular morphology and the degree of hydration of the body.|$|E

The breasts lie {{upon the}} pectoralis major muscle, the pectoralis minor muscle, and the {{intercostal}} muscles (between the ribs), and can extend to and cover {{a portion of}} the (front) anterior serratus muscle (attached to the ribs, the rib muscles, and the shoulder blade), and to the rectus abdominis muscle (a long, ﬂat muscle extending up the torso, from pubic bone to rib cage). The body posture of the woman exerts physical stresses upon the pectoralis major muscles and the pectoralis minor muscles, which cause the weight of the breasts to induce static and dynamic <b>shear</b> <b>forces</b> (when standing and when walking), compression forces (when lying supine), and tension forces (when kneeling on four limbs).|$|E
30|$|The peak {{pressure}} {{is the highest}} value in the pressure distribution {{at a point in}} stance phase. A positive measured value of the <b>shear</b> <b>force</b> indicates a forward force whereas a negative value indicates a backward force. The large {{peak pressure}} occurred in the heel strike and push off phase. The peak value of the <b>shear</b> <b>force</b> also occurred in the push off phase. High <b>shear</b> <b>force</b> and pressure are risk factors of foot problems such as ulcer. Hence, we attempted to reduce the maximum value of peak pressure or peak <b>shear</b> <b>force</b> by changing the footwear to reduce the in-shoe pressure or <b>shear</b> <b>force</b> acting directly on the plantar.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, the <b>shear</b> <b>force</b> in the <b>shearing</b> {{process of}} the drum type linear blade flying shear is done. Two {{different}} approaches were taken to establish the <b>shear</b> <b>force</b> formula, and then the finite element simulation.

25|$|Although many {{structures}} {{have undergone}} seismic retrofitting {{there are a}} large number of dangerous unreinforced masonry (mostly brick) structures and chimneys, which can be extremely hazardous to occupants in a large earthquake, and {{a large number of}} buildings which are either not bolted to their foundations or which are elevated upon partial stories that are insufficiently resistant to <b>shear</b> <b>forces.</b> Foundation and partial story weaknesses are easily remediated in most cases, but this is only effective if the work is competently done, with proper attention to minor details such as nailing patterns and proper connections. Local surveys of recently completed work have exposed deficient workmanship in a number of cases involving household retrofits.|$|E
25|$|Sonication is an {{efficient}} {{tool for the}} synthesis of polymers. The cavitational <b>shear</b> <b>forces,</b> which stretch out and break the chain in a non-random process, result in a lowering of the molecular weight and poly-dispersity. Furthermore, multi-phase systems are very efficient dispersed and emulsified, so that very fine mixtures are provided. This means that ultrasound increases the rate of polymerisation over conventional stirring and results in higher molecular weights with lower polydispersities. Ormosils (organically modified silicate) are obtained when silane is added to gel-derived silica during sol-gel process. The product is a molecular-scale composite with improved mechanical properties. Sono-Ormosils are characterized by a higher density than classic gels {{as well as an}} improved thermal stability. An explanation therefore might be the increased degree of polymerization.|$|E
25|$|Rotating {{biological}} contactors (RBCs) are robust mechanical fixed-film {{secondary treatment}} systems capable of withstanding surges in organic load. RBCs were first installed in Germany in 1960 and {{have since been}} developed and refined into a reliable operating unit. The rotating disks support the growth of bacteria and micro-organisms present in the sewage, which break down and stabilize organic pollutants. To be successful, micro-organisms need both oxygen to live and food to grow. Oxygen is obtained from the atmosphere as the disks rotate. As the micro-organisms grow, they build up on the media until they are sloughed off due to <b>shear</b> <b>forces</b> provided by the rotating discs in the sewage. Effluent from the RBC is then passed through a secondary clarifier where the sloughed biological solids in suspension settle as a sludge.|$|E
40|$|Objective The study {{explored}} {{the dynamics of}} <b>shearing</b> <b>force</b> and its correlation with chemical compositions and in vitro dry matter digestibility (IVDMD) of stylo. Methods The <b>shearing</b> <b>force,</b> diameter, linear density, chemical composition, and IVDMD of different height stylo stem were investigated. Linear regression analysis was done to determine {{the relationships between the}} <b>shearing</b> <b>force</b> and cut height, diameter, chemical composition, or IVDMD. Results The results showed that <b>shearing</b> <b>force</b> of stylo stem increased with plant height increasing and the crude protein (CP) content and IVDMD decreased but fiber content increased over time, resulting in decreased forage value. In addition, tall stem had greater <b>shearing</b> <b>force</b> than short stem. Moreover, <b>shearing</b> <b>force</b> is positively correlated with stem diameter, linear density and fiber fraction, but negatively correlated with CP content and IVDMD. Conclusion Overall, <b>shearing</b> <b>force</b> is an indicator more direct, easier and faster to measure than chemical composition and digestibility for evaluation of forage nutritive value related to animal performance. Therefore, {{it can be used to}} evaluate the nutritive value of stylo...|$|R

50|$|Let V1 and M1 be the <b>shear</b> <b>force</b> and {{bending moment}} {{respectively}} in {{a cross-section of}} the first beam segment. As {{the section of the}} beam moves towards the point of application of the external force the magnitudes of the <b>shear</b> <b>force</b> and moment may change.

25|$|These {{mutations}} have {{a common}} end result; they destabilise the cytoskeletal scaffold of cells. This stability is especially important in erythrocytes as they are constantly {{under the influence of}} deforming <b>shear</b> <b>forces.</b> As disc-shaped erythrocytes pass through capillaries, which can be 2-3 micrometres wide, they are forced to assume an elliptical shape in order to fit through. Normally, this deformation lasts only as long as a cell is present in a capillary, but in hereditary elliptocytosis the instability of the cytoskeleton means that erythrocytes deformed by passing through a capillary are forever rendered elliptical. These elliptical cells are taken up by the spleen and removed from circulation when they are younger than they would normally be, meaning that the erythrocytes of people with hereditary elliptocytosis have a shorter than average life-span (a normal person's erythrocytes average 120 days or more).|$|E
25|$|If the {{blocking}} or nailing is inadequate, each beam can be laid flat by the <b>shear</b> <b>forces</b> {{applied to}} the building. In this position they lack most of their original strength and the structure may further collapse. As part of a retrofit the blocking may be doubled, especially at the outer edges of the building. It may be appropriate to add additional nails between the sill plate of the perimeter wall erected upon the floor diaphragm, although this will require exposing the sill plate by removing interior plaster or exterior siding. As the sill plate may be quite old and dry and substantial nails must be used, {{it may be necessary}} to pre-drill a hole for the nail in the old wood to avoid splitting. When the wall is opened for this purpose it may also be appropriate to tie vertical wall elements into the foundation using specialty connectors and bolts glued with epoxy cement into holes drilled in the foundation.|$|E
25|$|Stone, {{brick and}} other such {{materials}} are strong in compression and somewhat so in shear, but cannot resist much force in tension. As a result, masonry arch bridges {{are designed to be}} constantly under compression, so far as is possible. Each arch is constructed over a temporary falsework frame, known as a centring. In the first compression arch bridges, a keystone {{in the middle of the}} bridge bore the weight of the rest of the bridge. The more weight that was put onto the bridge, the stronger its structure became. Masonry arch bridges use a quantity of fill material (typically compacted rubble) above the arch in order to increase this dead-weight on the bridge and prevent tension from occurring in the arch ring as loads move across the bridge. Other materials that were used to build this type of bridge were brick and unreinforced concrete. When masonry (cut stone) is used the angles of the faces are cut to minimize <b>shear</b> <b>forces.</b> Where random masonry (uncut and unprepared stones) is used they are mortared together and the mortar is allowed to set before the falsework is removed.|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: The {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{investigate}} the validity of a model for estimating <b>shear</b> <b>force</b> on the buttocks of elderly people with kyphosis. METHOD: The subjects with kyphosis were 10 elderly people in a facility providing health care services for the elderly. The <b>shear</b> <b>force</b> was measured using a force plate and, simultaneously, the position of the resultant centre of mass of the upper body and the inclination angle of the trunk were measured. The estimated <b>shear</b> <b>force</b> was calculated by substituting these values in the model. RESULTS: The average value of the measured <b>shear</b> <b>force</b> was 8. 4 SD 1. 4 [%BW], and the average value of the estimated <b>shear</b> <b>force</b> was 5. 8 SD 1. 0 [%BW]. Although there was a significant difference between these two values (p <  0. 01), there was a strong positive correlation between them (r =  0. 786, p <  0. 01). The regression line between the two values was y =  1. 097 x + 1. 96, where x = estimated value, y = measured value. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the estimated <b>shear</b> <b>force</b> was close to the measured <b>shear</b> <b>force</b> and thus is approximately known by substituting the calculated values for the linear regression...|$|R
40|$|The {{spandrel}} and {{wing walls}} in the reinforced concrete structure are of important structural elements in that they bear the <b>shearing</b> <b>force.</b> Since how to design these walls greatly affect {{the safety of the}} structure, it is necessary to estimate correctly the <b>shearing</b> <b>force</b> ratios of the walls before we design the structure. However, we haven't so far had a standardized method of determining the <b>shearing</b> <b>force</b> ratios for the spandrel and wing walls.

25|$|People with OI {{are born}} with {{defective}} connective tissue, or without {{the ability to make}} it, usually because of a deficiency of Type-I collagen. This deficiency arises from an amino acid substitution of glycine to bulkier amino acids in the collagen triple helix structure. The larger amino acid side-chains create steric hindrance that creates a bulge in the collagen complex, which in turn influences both the molecular nanomechanics and the interaction between molecules, which are both compromised. As a result, the body may respond by hydrolyzing the improper collagen structure. If the body does not destroy the improper collagen, the relationship between the collagen fibrils and hydroxyapatite crystals to form bone is altered, causing brittleness. Another suggested disease mechanism is that the stress state within collagen fibrils is altered at the locations of mutations, where locally larger <b>shear</b> <b>forces</b> lead to rapid failure of fibrils even at moderate loads as the homogeneous stress state found in healthy collagen fibrils is lost. These recent works suggest that OI must be understood as a multi-scale phenomenon, which involves mechanisms at the genetic, nano-, micro- and macro-level of tissues.|$|E

40|$|Approximately 280 Simmental- and Hereford- sired feedlot steers were {{ultrasonically}} {{evaluated for}} intramuscular fat deposition using CPEC and Critical Vision, Inc. (CVI) ultrasound systems. Warner-Bratzler <b>shear</b> <b>force</b> measurements were taken on steaks from the 13 th rib region.

Correlation coefficients of CPEC deviation and CVI deviation with <b>shear</b> <b>force</b> were 0. 18 and 0. 15, respectively.

However, when the data were evaluated with linear models, which take many variables into account, we found that animals with ultrasound marbling predictions higher than the actual carcass marbling score were not associated with higher <b>shear</b> <b>force</b> values.
