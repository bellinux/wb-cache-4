5|$|The menu at the White House Passover Seder {{featured}} traditional American Jewish Passover cuisine such as gefilte fish, charoset, {{chicken soup}} with matzah balls, brisket, potato kugel, and macaroons.

Family recipes were emphasized: in 2015, these recipes included matzo ball soup from Ziskend's grandmother, carrot <b>soufflé</b> from Lesser's mother, and Raspberry Ganache Marjolaine from Chaudhary's mother. Recipes covered foods {{from both the}} Ashkenazic and Sephardic traditions. The food was not strictly kosher, but kosher style. In 2014, the White House Passover Seder began inviting a guest chef to coordinate the menu with the White House executive chef.|$|E

40|$|The 1960 s {{phenomenon}} of tricontinentalism, originating in Havana in 1966, had its strongest politico-artistic {{impact on the}} African side of the Atlantic in Morocco. We can trace this through the avant-garde journal <b>Souffles,</b> published in Rabat between 1966 and 1972. The intellectual space that <b>Souffles</b> came to dominate lay {{at the crossroads of}} different anti-colonial ideologies: both Arabist and keen to promote Berber culture; both Moroccan and Maghrebi as it called for a new culture in North Africa; both pan-Africanist and pan-Arabist; and exhibiting signs of ‘Maoisant’ Marxism to boot. It is thanks largely to the ideological scope of <b>Souffles</b> that Morocco became a pivot for the Tricontinental Movement worldwide...|$|R

25|$|English {{is one of}} the few European {{languages}} {{that does}} not have many words that contain diacritical marks. Exceptions are unassimilated foreign loanwords, including borrowings from French and, increasingly, Spanish; however, the diacritic is also sometimes omitted from such words. Loanwords that frequently appear with the diacritic in English include café, résumé or resumé (a usage that helps distinguish it from the verb resume), <b>soufflé,</b> and naïveté (see English terms with diacritical marks). In older practice (and even among some orthographically conservative modern writers) one may see examples such as élite, mêlée and rôle.|$|E

He praised the Cerwyn cheese <b>soufflé</b> and the pheasant pithiviers starters, as well as three of the mains; a roast duck dish, the pork belly dish, and a venison dish. Around the same time, Sally Williams reviewed the restaurant for the Western Mail, who also praised the <b>soufflé.</b> She called the atmosphere [...] "comfortable" [...] and stated {{that it had a}} home-like quality to it. In 2013, the restaurant was ranked as the second best in Wales, behind The Walnut Tree in Abergavenny, in the Sunday Times list of the 100 best restaurants in the UK.|$|E

Norman concluded that the restaurant was a [...] "slick operation", but the [...] "character, vibrancy and fun had been slaughtered on the altar of satisfying the inspectorate".|$|E

500|$|In {{the opinion}} of Douglas Brode, there has only been one screen [...] "performance" [...] of The Tempest since the silent era, he {{describes}} all other versions as [...] "variations". That one performance is the Hallmark Hall of Fame version from 1960, directed by George Schaefer, and starring Maurice Evans as Prospero, Richard Burton as Caliban, Lee Remick as Miranda and Roddy McDowall as Ariel. It cut the play to slightly less than ninety minutes. Critic Virginia Vaughan praised it as [...] "light as a <b>soufflé,</b> but... substantial enough for the main course." ...|$|E
500|$|During {{the classic}} period, {{there were many}} films {{produced}} in Europe, particularly in France, that share elements of style, theme, and sensibility with American film noirs and may themselves {{be included in the}} genre's canon. In certain cases, the interrelationship with Hollywood noir is obvious: American-born director Jules Dassin moved to France in the early 1950s {{as a result of the}} Hollywood blacklist, and made one of the most famous French film noirs, Rififi (1955). Other well-known French films often classified as noir include Quai des Orfèvres (1947) [...] and Les Diaboliques (1955), both directed by Henri-Georges Clouzot; Casque d'Or (1952) and Touchez pas au grisbi (1954), both directed by Jacques Becker; and Ascenseur pour l'échafaud (1958), directed by Louis Malle. French director Jean-Pierre Melville is widely recognized for his tragic, minimalist film noirs—Bob le flambeur (1955), from the classic period, was followed by Le Doulos (1962), Le deuxième <b>souffle</b> (1966), Le Samouraï (1967), and Le Cercle rouge (1970).|$|E
500|$|However, Ben Sisario of Blender wrote, [...] "For every killer raise-your-hands hook {{there is}} a snoozer of an SWV-esque torch ballad, and she can't seem to tell the difference." [...] He went on to say, [...] "Almost half the songs are treacly Kleenex soul ballads; even the titles...bring a cringe." [...] Los Angeles Times writer Natalie Nichols found that [...] "her <b>souffle</b> of hip-hop, soul, R, funk and dance music falls a bit flat". Rolling Stones Brian Hiatt called The Cookbook Elliott's [...] "least cohesive, most {{conventional}} album yet." [...] Entertainment Weeklys Margeaux Watson viewed that [...] "she's clearly lost without Timbaland", calling him [...] "the main ingredient of her original flavor". Steve Horowitz of PopMatters noted that it [...] "does have a few duds" [...] and found some of the [...] "offensive lyrics" [...] as flaws, but wrote that [...] "While not every cut is a winner, Elliott does a fairly consistent job of gaining the listener's attention through her outrageous lyrics and performance style".|$|E

500|$|In a {{different}} vein, films {{began to appear}} that self-consciously acknowledged the conventions of classic film noir as historical archetypes to be revived, rejected, or reimagined. These efforts typify {{what came to be}} known as neo-noir. Though several late classic noirs, Kiss Me Deadly in particular, were deeply self-knowing and post-traditional in conception, none tipped its hand so evidently as to be remarked on by American critics at the time. The first major film to overtly work this angle was French director Jean-Luc Godard's À bout de <b>souffle</b> (Breathless; 1960), which pays its literal respects to Bogart and his crime films while brandishing a bold new style for a new day. In the United States, Arthur Penn (Mickey One , drawing inspiration from Truffaut's Tirez sur le pianiste and other French New Wave films), John Boorman (Point Blank , similarly caught up, though in the Nouvelle vague's deeper waters), and Alan J. Pakula (Klute [...] ) directed films that knowingly related themselves to the original film noirs, inviting audiences in on the game.|$|E

The author notes that bacon is not as bad nutritionally as had previously been thought. He compares the nutritional characteristics of two slices of cooked bacon to one pork hot dog, noting that the bacon contains approximately [...] "73 calories, 202 milligrams of sodium, 6 grams of fat and 11 milligrams of cholesterol", while the hot dog has [...] "182 calories, 638 milligrams of sodium, 17 grams of fat and 29 milligrams of cholesterol". [...] "If health concerns sometimes make you feel guilty about loving bacon ... relax ...yes, it’s high in sodium and fat, but if eaten in moderation or used as a flavoring agent ... it is a guilt free indulgence," [...] writes Villas. Breakfast dishes include French Cheese and Bacon <b>souffle,</b> and Bacon Scrapple. A recipe for BLT sandwich is included in the section on sandwiches, but the majority of Villas's other sandwich recipes are more extreme, and include ingredients such as Jamaican smoked fish. Dishes that contain vegetables include Lima Bean and Bacon Casserole; and Spanish Chicken, Bacon, Meatball and Chickpea Stew. For dessert, Villas includes six recipes such as bacon-wrapped figs, and Bacon and Peanut Butter Chocolate Truffles, and Portuguese Egg and Bacon Pudding.|$|E
