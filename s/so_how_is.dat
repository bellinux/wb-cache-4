A gene never has a fixed effect, <b>so</b> <b>how</b> <b>is</b> it possible {{to speak of a}} gene for long legs? It is because of the phenotypic differences between alleles. One may say that one allele, all other things being equal or varying within certain limits, causes greater legs than its alternative. This difference enables the scrutiny of natural selection.|$|E
2500|$|At the 83rd minute, {{with the}} score at 1–1, referee Roberto Rosetti called a foul against Spain's Carles Puyol.

[...] "For me it wasn't a foul, if anything it was a foul by (Henry) because he came from behind and collided with me," [...] Puyol said, [...] "but referees can get things wrong."

6000|$|When in {{the daily}} service of our Church we repeat these words of the sublime hymn ("The noble army of martyrs praise Thee!"), I wonder {{sometimes}} whether it be with a full appreciation of their meaning? whether we do really reflect on all that this noble army of martyrs has conquered for us?

6000|$|Strangely enough, this snake, so {{fatal to}} man, has no power against another West Indian snake, almost equally common, namely, the Cribo. {40} This brave animal, closely {{connected}} with our common water- snake, is perfectly harmless, and a welcome guest in West Indian houses, because he clears them of rats. He is some {{six or eight}} feet long, black, with more or less bright yellow about the tail and under the stomach. He not only faces the Fer-de-lance, who is often as big as he, but kills and eats him. It was but last year, I think, that the population of Carenage turned out to see a fight in a tree between a Cribo and a Fer-de-lance, of about equal size, which, after a two hours' struggle, ended in the Cribo swallowing the Fer-de-lance, head foremost. But when he had got his adversary about one-third down, the Creoles--just as so many Englishmen would have done--seeing that all the sport was over, rewarded the brave Cribo by killing both, and preserving them as a curiosity in spirits. How the Fer-de-lance came into the Antilles is a puzzle. [...] The black American scorpion--whose bite is more dreaded by the Negroes than even the snake's--may have been easily brought by ship in luggage or in cargo. But the Fer-de-lance, whose nearest home is in Guiana, {{is not likely to}} have come on board ship. It is difficult to believe that he travelled northward by land at the epoch--if such a one there ever was--when these islands were joined to South America: for if so, he would surely be found in St. Vincent, in Grenada, and most surely of all in Trinidad. So far from that being the case, he will not live, it is said, in St. Vincent. For (so goes the story) during the Carib war of 1795-96, the savages imported Fer-de-lances from St. Lucia or Martinique, and turned them loose, in hopes of their destroying the white men: but they did not breed, dwindled away, and were soon extinct. It is possible that they, or their eggs, came in floating timber from the Orinoco: but if <b>so,</b> <b>how</b> <b>is</b> it that they have never been stranded on the east coast of Trinidad, whither timber without end drifts from that river? In a word, I have no explanation whatsoever to give; as I am not minded to fall back on the medieval one, that the devil must have brought them thither, to plague the inhabitants for their sins.|$|E
