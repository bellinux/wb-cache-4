40|$|Recently {{discovered}} {{effect of}} spin-filtering and spin amplification in GaNAs {{enables us to}} reliably obtain detailed information {{on the degree of}} <b>spin</b> <b>loss</b> during optical <b>spin</b> injection across a semiconductor heterointerface at room temperature. Spin polarization of electrons injected from GaAs into GaNAs is found to be less than half of what is generated in GaNAs by optical orientation. We show that the observed reduced spin injection efficiency is not only due to spin relaxation in GaAs, but more importantly due to <b>spin</b> <b>loss</b> across the interface due to structural inversion asymmetry and probably also interfacial point defects.

40|$|A {{model of}} a spin valve in which {{electron}} transport between the magnetized electrodes is due to multistep tunneling is analyzed. Motivated by recent experiments on organic spin valves, we assume that <b>spin</b> memory <b>loss</b> {{in the course of}} transport is due to random hyperfine fields acting on electron while it waits for the next tunneling step. Amazingly, we identify the three-step configurations of sites, for which the tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR) is negative, suggesting that the resistance for antiparallel magnetizations of the electrodes is smaller than for parallel magnetizations. We analyze the phase volume of these configurations with respect to magnitudes and relative orientations of the on-site hyperfine fields. The effect of sign reversal of TMR is exclusively due to interference of the spin-flip amplitudes on each site, it does not emerge within commonly accepted probabilistic description of spin transport. Another feature specific to multistep inelastic tunneling is bouncing of electron between nearest neighbors while awaiting a "hard" hop. We demonstrate that this bouncing, being absolutely insignificant for conduction of current, can strongly affect the <b>spin</b> memory <b>loss.</b> This effect is also of interference origin.

40|$|A {{convenient}} formalism for averaging {{the losses}} produced by gravitational radiation backreaction over one orbital period {{was developed in}} an earlier paper. In the present paper we generalize this formalism to include {{the case of a}} closed system composed from two bodies of comparable masses, one of them having the spin S. We employ the equations of motion given by Barker and O'Connell, where terms up to linear order in the spin (the spin-orbit interaction terms) are kept. To obtain the radiative losses up to terms linear in the spin, the equations of motion are taken to the same order. Then the magnitude L of the angular momentum L, the angle kappa subtended by S and L and the energy E are conserved. The analysis of the radial motion leads to a new parametrization of the orbit. From the instantaneous gravitational radiation losses computed by Kidder the leading terms and the spin-orbit terms are taken. Following Apostolatos, Cutler, Sussman and Thorne, the evolution of the vectors S and L in the momentary plane spanned by these vectors is separated from the evolution of the plane in space. The radiation-induced change in the spin is smaller than the leading-order spin terms in the momentary angular momentum loss. This enables us to compute the averaged losses in the constants of motion E, L and L_S=L cos kappa. In the latter, the radiative <b>spin</b> <b>loss</b> terms average to zero. An alternative description using the orbital elements a,e and kappa is given. The finite mass effects contribute terms, comparable in magnitude, to the basic, test-particle spin terms in the averaged losses. Comment: 12 pages, 1 figure, Phys. Rev. D 15, March, 199...|$|R
