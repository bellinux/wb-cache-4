25|$|The French gun-vessel Eclair {{was one of}} 20 chasse-marées {{built in}} 1785 in {{southern}} Brittany for use as <b>service</b> <b>craft</b> in harbour construction at Cherbourg. In 1793 Martin or Jacques Fabien converted ten of them into chaloupes-canonnières (gun-vessels). One of these received the name Eclair. Sir Richard Strachan's squadron captured her in 1795 in Cartaret Bay, and the Royal Navy took her into service as HMS Eclair. She then sailed to the West Indies where she was probably out of service by 1801. In 1802 she was hulked under the name HMS Safety. Shen then served as a prison ship at Jamaica around 1808 to 1810. {{she may have been}} sold at Tortola in 1817/18, but in 1841 or so was brought back into service there as a receiving hulk. She was broken up in 1879.|$|E
