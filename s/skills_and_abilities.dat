Washburn writes that mastering the game comes with the mastering of the cultural knowledge of Spira to unlock <b>skills</b> <b>and</b> <b>abilities.</b> O'Hagan writes on the localization of the games that impact the game experience, detailing alterations to the script and dialogue with modifications, additions and omissions. Another aspect was that the presentation of Spira without an overworld view {{can be considered a}} pioneer in 3D role-playing game maps.|$|E
5|$|Evolve {{features}} {{a total of}} 20 different human characters split into four classes, each class containing 5 characters. Each class has different <b>skills</b> <b>and</b> <b>abilities,</b> and players are required to cooperate {{with each other in}} a match. Players unlock new characters as they progress through the game, e.g. the fourth Assault character will be unlocked if the player has upgraded the previous three Assault characters. The Hunters class features first-person gameplay. The ammunition of their weapons is automatically refilled when not in use, and iron sights are used in- game. Evolve does not allow multiple players to play as the same class in a match. Gameplay variations are also present within the characters in the same class.|$|E
5|$|Morrowind {{begins with}} the player's character, having been imprisoned, {{arriving}} in Morrowind by boat {{in order to be}} pardoned. This is a common introductory segment throughout the main installments of the series. A tutorial depicting the prisoner's release moves the player through the process of character creation. The player is successively asked questions by a fellow prisoner, an officer, and a bureaucrat as the player is registered as a free citizen; choosing, in the process, the player character's name, race, gender, class, and birthsign. These affect the player's starting attributes, <b>skills,</b> <b>and</b> <b>abilities.</b> The player then determines their class in one of three ways; Picking from a class list, randomly generating a class via questions, or creating a custom class themselves.|$|E

5|$|The {{specific}} {{access method}} {{will depend on}} the <b>skills</b> <b>and</b> <b>abilities</b> of the user. With direct selection a body part, pointer, adapted mouse, joystick, or eye tracking could be used, whereas switch access scanning is often used for indirect selection. Unlike direct selection (e.g., typing on a keyboard, touching a screen), users of Target Scanning can only make selections when the scanning indicator (or cursor) of the electronic device is on the desired choice. Those who are unable to point typically calibrate their eyes to use eye gaze as a way to point and blocking as a way to select desired words and phrases. The speed and pattern of scanning, as well as the way items are selected, are individualized to the physical, visual and cognitive capabilities of the user.|$|E
5|$|The combat of {{the game}} borrows {{multiple}} elements from Naughty Dog's Uncharted series, with players having the ability to free-aim Lara's bow and the guns she salvages, engage in close-quarter combat and perform stealth kills. Players can also use Survival Instinct, an ability in which enemies, collectables and objects pivotal to environmental puzzles will be highlighted for players. The game also incorporates RPG elements: as players progress through the game, they earn experience points from performing certain actions and completing in-game challenges linked with hunting, exploring and combat: this enables players' <b>skills</b> <b>and</b> <b>abilities</b> to be upgraded in specific ways, such as giving her more storage capacity for arrows and ammunition. Players can also upgrade and customize weapons using salvage collected across the island. There is also a character progression mechanic in the game: better items, weapons and equipment are gained as players progress, though the appearance of most of these items is closely linked to events in the story. In addition to the main story, players can complete multiple side quests, explore the island, revisit locations, and search for challenge tombs.|$|E

50|$|Interventions {{based on}} the 3C-check can best be {{illustrated}} with an example. Let us assume a sales manager has performed a 3C-check with her sales representative {{with respect to a}} guided sales pitch.If the 3C-check shows that the sales pitch in use is supported by the components head and heart, but not the component hand (this combination is represented by Section A in Fig. 3), it should first be discussed whether the lack of <b>skill</b> <b>and</b> <b>ability</b> is only subjective (i.e., felt by the sales representative) or also objective. In case of an objective <b>skill</b> <b>and</b> <b>ability</b> deficit, (e.g., when the co-worker is not yet familiar with the guidelines or the calculation methods used), measures like training, coaching, or collegial advice may be appropriate. Moreover, other colleagues may be asked to assist the sales representative and help overcome the hand-related obstacle. In case of a subjective <b>skill</b> <b>and</b> <b>ability</b> deficit, the manager could try to increase the sales representative’s self-efficacy by providing positive feedback about her employee’s prior performance.|$|R
