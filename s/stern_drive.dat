25|$|In 1957 Kiekhaefer {{introduced}} the Mark 75 motor, the industry's first 6-cylinder 60hp (horsepower) outboard motor. Two Mark 75 motors set an endurance record by running for 34 days, 11 hours, 47 minutes, and 5.4 seconds nonstop and over 25,000 miles. The motors were refueled on the run, and averaged 30.3mph (miles per hour). In 1961 Kiekhaefer Marine {{merged with the}} Brunswick Corporation. Later that year Kiekhaefer would use his NASCAR and boat engineering skills to develop the 100hp <b>stern</b> <b>drive</b> engine now known as MerCruiser. Kiekhaefer resigned {{as president of the}} company in 1969, and the company name changed to Mercury Marine.|$|E
2500|$|In 1999 the company's SOMAR {{division}} {{built its}} first tug, Tira Lani, [...] "from the stern up" [...] with azimuth <b>stern</b> <b>drive</b> and a structural steel frame that {{would support the}} exhaust pipes and protect the pilot house. The vessel's propulsion system has a service speed of 13knots (24kilometers per hour), a bollard pull astern of more than 50US tons (45.4T), and a bollard pull ahead of 60US tons (54.4T).|$|E
50|$|Internal drive {{propulsion}} {{is a form}} {{of marine}} propulsion commonly used in recreational boating. Like other forms of motorized boating, internal drive propulsion employs a motor that turns a propeller to move the boat forward. The primary difference between internal drive boats and <b>stern</b> <b>drive</b> boats is that the propeller is enclosed inside the hull of an internal drive boat whereas the propeller is exposed outside the hull of a <b>stern</b> <b>drive</b> boat.|$|E

50|$|Three early titles went to boats using {{conventional}} {{propeller shafts}} {{but the more}} efficient, fully trimable Mercruiser <b>stern</b> <b>drives</b> have accounted for twenty titles while the more recently introduced surface drives make up the remainder.|$|R
50|$|Corsair Category (closed bow):Different Corsair models come in {{a variety}} of lengths ranging from 22’ to 36’, {{including}} a 36’ model with a hard top. All feature inboard engines with <b>stern</b> <b>drives.</b> Series includes the Capri 21 and Capri 25.|$|R
50|$|The {{history of}} <b>stern</b> <b>drive</b> power {{begins in the}} First World War with the {{production}} of the MAS of Isotta-Fraschini, with two counter-rotating propellers.|$|E
50|$|As far as marine {{technician}} {{programs are}} concerned, students learn hands-on to trouble shoot, service and repair four- and two-stroke outboards, <b>stern</b> <b>drive,</b> rigging, fuel & lube systems, electrical including diesel engines.|$|E
50|$|Inboard jet drives {{remained}} a power choice for Wacanda {{through the end}} of production in 1988, frequently with drives built by Berkley Pump Co. (California) or Eliminator Jet (Idaho). However, Wacanda boats were most commonly powered with outboard motors or inboard-outboard (<b>stern</b> <b>drive)</b> power plants.|$|E
5000|$|The X10 is a 10.5 m RHIB {{model with}} a Deep [...] "Vee" [...] hull design. It is {{designed}} for patrol or commercial duty and can be fitted with either inboard diesel engines and waterjets, conventional <b>stern</b> <b>drives,</b> or outboard motors.|$|R
50|$|With both inboards and <b>stern</b> <b>drives</b> {{there is}} a fire and {{explosion}} hazard from gasoline fuel vapors within the engine compartment. Typically these boats must run a blower for several minutes prior to starting the engine, and when idling or moving below cruise speed. The blower exchanges the air within the engine compartment with fresh outside air.|$|R
2500|$|In {{addition}} to the [...] "jaws" [...] of the cone being controlled the direction of thrust is also controlled by rudder direction. In this way, it is unlike the azimuth thrusters used on many medium and large vessels, or the outboard motors or <b>stern</b> <b>drives</b> used by some small boats, since these all use the directed thrust to avoid the need of a rudder altogether.|$|R
50|$|For {{pleasure}} craft, such as sailboats and speedboats, diesel, {{gasoline and}} electric engines are used. Many inboard motors are derivatives of automobile engines, known as marine automobile engines. The {{advent of the}} <b>stern</b> <b>drive</b> propulsion leg improved design so that auto engines could easily power boats.|$|E
50|$|Clymer {{currently}} has over three hundred repair manuals that cover thousands of models. Some {{of the most}} popular models are the Honda TRX ATVs, International Harvester Farm Tractors, BMW K1200 Series, Harley-Davidson FLH & FLT Twin Cam 88 & 103 models and the MerCruiser <b>Stern</b> <b>Drive</b> Marine Engines.|$|E
50|$|BMW Marine, in {{conjunction}} with ZF, designed and manufactured a new <b>stern</b> <b>drive</b> unit. These stern drives were marketed as the BMW Z-Drive. Uniquely, these stern drives utilized a multiple wet clutch system. These drives competed with Sweden's Volvo Penta and Mercury Marine's Mercruiser Division of Stillwater, Oklahoma.|$|E
50|$|In {{the marine}} area, Ricardo {{expertise}} {{has been applied}} to everything from small outboard motors and <b>stern</b> <b>drives,</b> to large 8 MW 16-cylinder diesels; novel engine concepts promise efficiency levels close to 60 percent, and computer modelling of complete ship propulsion systems is able to calculate the likely benefits of competing energy storage technologies and give return-on-investment predictions. One programme identified, and rectified, the deck vibration issues affecting a 55-ft luxury motor cruiser.|$|R
50|$|The stern-drive, or inboard-outboard motors, were {{available}} both as separate units for boat-builders, or as components of boats produced by OMC. Built {{to give the}} fuel economy and dependability of inboard engines, they were nevertheless as versatile as outboards. By 1965 the company was selling only about 20,000 <b>stern</b> <b>drives</b> a year, however, and sales of the outboards were still outpacing them tenfold. The problem stemmed from the engine's state-of-the-art technology; many dealers {{did not know how}} to repair these motors, and owners were often ignorant of maintenance needs. OMC met this challenge by developing computerized week-long repair and maintenance classes for dealer training. Four schools, two permanently stationed in San Francisco, California, and Waukegan, Illinois, and two mobile units familiarized customers with the new engines.|$|R
50|$|Ward {{designed}} and built many steam and diesel powered vessels, both paddlewheel and propeller driven. Customers include the Army, Navy and Coast Guard. Ward manufactured water-tube boilers in many sizes. The firm also pioneered {{the development of the}} tunnel <b>stern</b> propeller <b>driven</b> towboats and were among the first companies to install diesel power in river towboats.|$|R
50|$|Shannon is a harbour {{and coastal}} tug, {{originally}} built in 1981 as the Eldergarth. The tug is noteworthy {{as the first}} British-built Azimuthing <b>Stern</b> <b>Drive</b> tug. Shannon has been acquired by Emu Limited and re-equipped in Southampton with a suite of specialist winches and a stern mounted ‘A’ frame.|$|E
50|$|Electronic Fuel Injection (EFI) was {{introduced}} on select OMC drive systems in 1993, representing {{the first time}} that EFI was available to recreational <b>stern</b> <b>drive</b> customers. With the previous carbureted systems, boaters had to endure a nine-step starting sequence. With the EFI, boaters had only to turn the key and shift into gear.|$|E
50|$|Other {{brands of}} sterndrive include MerCruiser (produced by Brunswick Corporation's Mercury Marine, which also {{manufactures}} outboard motors). Mercruiser {{have a slightly}} larger market share in the USA, while in Europe Volvo Penta has an approximate 80% market share. In 1999 Brunswick was sued by Volvo Penta for monopolizing the <b>stern</b> <b>drive</b> business in the USA.|$|E
50|$|Christian Laettner {{was born}} and raised in Angola, New York (near Buffalo and Niagara Falls) to a blue-collar Roman Catholic family. His father George was of Polish descent and his {{grandparents}} spoke Polish as their first language. Christian's older brother Christopher was a strong influence, often bullying young Christian, which helped instill a <b>stern</b> competitive <b>drive.</b> Both boys also frequently worked as farm laborers to supplement their allowance.|$|R

50|$|In early 2006, {{with the}} Howard <b>Stern</b> morning <b>drive</b> time show gone due to Stern moving to Sirius Satellite Radio, WBCN {{experienced}} a plummet in Arbitron ratings that the station had not observed {{since the late}} 1970s and early 1980s, when it fell behind then rock format competitor WCOZ. The station started to air the syndicated Opie & Anthony during morning drive. WBCN also launched The Toucher and Rich Show, a new locally produced comedy-based afternoon drive time show starring Fred Toettcher and Rich Shertenlieb. The duo formerly worked together at Atlanta alternative station WNNX.|$|R

5000|$|Boats, boat lifts, PWCs, {{and other}} watercrafts {{needs to be}} {{properly}} winterized. This includes draining water from the hull, and the cooling system, inspect <b>stern</b> <b>drive</b> to remove plant life, add fuel, add oil to the engine, and clean the bilges. Thoroughly cleaning the interiors, draining any refrigerators, lock all drawers, and remove valuables. It's also important to properly shrink wrap a boat to protect from moisture, snow, ice, and debris.|$|E
50|$|The paddle is {{held with}} two hands, some {{distance}} apart from each other. For normal use, it is drawn {{through the water}} from front (bow) to back (<b>stern)</b> to <b>drive</b> the boat forwards. The two blades of a kayak paddle are dipped alternately {{on either side of}} the kayak. A paddle is distinguished from an oar in that the paddle is held in the user's hands and completely supported by the paddler, whereas an oar is primarily supported by the boat, through the use of oarlocks. Gloves may be worn to prevent blistering for long periods of paddling.|$|R
50|$|Much of the station's {{programming}} {{focused on}} syndicated talk shows (former WAAF personalities Opie & Anthony replacing David Lee Roth, {{who had previously}} replaced Howard <b>Stern</b> in morning <b>Drive</b> Time). During the autumn months, WBCN became more focused on sports as the station broadcast the games of the NFL's New England Patriots beginning in 1995.|$|R
40|$|Marinediesel Sweden AB i Ängelholm tillverkar och utvecklar båtmotorer och motorbåtsdrev. Jaggjorde mitt exobb på avdelningen MD Engineering som huvudsakligen utvecklar marina drivlinor. Marinediesel Sweden AB var i behov av ett styrprogram till den testbänk de byggt för att kunna testasina motorbåtsdrev. Denna rapport beskriver arbetet jag utfört för att färdigställa och optimera ettstyrprogram till en testrigg för marina drivlinor. I rapporten tar jag upp drevbänkens uppbyggnad, dessfunktion samt de problem jag stött på på vägen. Bland annat beskrivs hur effektförlusten beräknasmed energidifferensen i tillförd och bortförd olja i drevet, samt hur det pålagda vridmomentet, somsimulerar belastningen vid verkliga driftsförhållanden, styrs och beräknas med endast trycket ihydraulcylindrarna.

In this report I discuss how the test rig is constructed, it's operation and theissues I encountered along the way. Among other things, I describe how the power loss is calculatedby the energy difference of the supplied and abducted oil in the gear, and how the applied torque,which simulates the load at actual operating conditions, are controlled and calculated using only thepressure in the hydraulic cylinders...|$|R
50|$|A bow rider {{is a kind}} of runabout boat {{typically}} between 17' and 35', use <b>stern</b> <b>drive</b> or outboard engines, {{and hold}} between six and ten people. To distinguish it from a cuddy boat, it has an open bow area where there are extra seats in front of the helm station. This term can be confused with bow riding, a dangerous and often illegal activity involving sitting or standing on the bow while the boat is making way.|$|E

50|$|In 1948, Mercury Marine {{engineer}} Charlie Strang mated {{an aluminum}} car racing engine {{to the lower}} unit of an outboard motor, creating a marine propulsion system {{more powerful than the}} outboard motors available at the time. During the 1950s, he and fellow engineer Jim Wynne worked at under Mercury founder Carl Kiekhaefer, who was initially dismissive of and opposed to a technology that would later capture 80% of the market. In 1959 Wynne left Kiekhaefer and in less than 90 days developed his own <b>stern</b> <b>drive,</b> which he subsequently patented.|$|E
5000|$|The station {{continued}} with the “Hot Talk” format until August 2002. One of the nationally syndicated programs, the New York-based “Opie and Anthony Show” was cancelled from syndication (as {{well as on}} their home station of WNEW in New York City), when an on-air stunt involving sex in a Catholic church offended some listeners and station management. At that point, the station continued to air Howard <b>Stern</b> in morning <b>drive,</b> and dropped all remaining talk shows from the schedule. KXOA continued to air classic hard rock {{the rest of the}} day. KXOA now had the slogan “Sacramento’s Hard Rock.” ...|$|R
50|$|In June 2001, {{the owners}} (Infinity Broadcasting) decided to flip the format to “Hot Talk.” The KXOA call letters {{remained}} in place, but the station’s slogan became “The Talk that Rocks.” The station featured Howard <b>Stern</b> during morning <b>drive</b> and {{a mix of}} local and nationally syndicated talk show hosts {{the rest of the}} day. On weekends and breaks, the station programmed classic hard rock, primarily released during the 1970s and 1980s. The music was highly familiar. The station struggled in the ratings, earning less than a 1.0 in the 12+ demographic. The only national show with a substantial audience was Stern's. However, the KiddChris Show, airing locally in the evenings, was the station's highest-rated program consistently.|$|R
60|$|It was a {{magnificent}} sight. Tremendous waves were following the ship, each as it approached lifting her stern {{high in the}} air and driving her along at a speed that seemed terrific, then passing on and leaving her to sink down into the valley behind it. The air was thick with flying spray torn from the crest of the waves. At first it seemed as if each sea that came up behind the vessel would break over her <b>stern</b> and <b>drive</b> her head-foremost down; but as wave passed after wave without damage the sense of anxiety passed off, and Marion was able to enjoy the grandeur of the sea. Wilfrid, Mr. Atherton, and the Allens often came in to sit with her, and to take shelter for a time from the fury of the wind. But talking was almost impossible; the roar of the wind in the rigging, the noise of the waves as they struck the ship, and the confused sound of the battle of the elements being too great to allow a voice to be heard, except when raised almost to shouting point.|$|R
