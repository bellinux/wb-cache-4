40|$|Mercury strain-gauge {{plethysmography}} venous mode is a {{non-invasive technique}} for {{exploration of the}} haemodynamics of the extremities. The plethysmographic parameters used are: (1) the venous inflow (in ml/ 100 ml/min); (2) the venous outflow (in ml/ 100 ml/min); (3) the venous capacity in ml/ 100 ml; (4) the venous distensibility index in ml/ 100 ml/ mmHg; and (5) the venous pressure measured by ‘hysteresis curve’. This method permits us to analyse the venous haemodynamics of both extremities simultaneously (the normal limb serving as the control), to obtain a precise diagnosis and to appreciate the efficacy of treatment at follow-up. The aetiology of the swollen limb can be precisely identified in 95 % of the studied cases: <b>oedema</b> <b>in</b> superficial venous insufficiency, <b>oedema</b> <b>in</b> the deep venous insufficiency, oedema of inflammatory origin, <b>oedema</b> <b>in</b> the arterial insufficiency, oedema of cardiac origin, lymphoedema.

We analysed the brainstem, heart and lungs of 15 fatal cases of confirmed EV-A 71 infection {{in order to understand}} the pathophysiological mechanism of death and pulmonary <b>oedema.</b> <b>In</b> keeping with other case studies, the main cause of death was neurogenic pulmonary <b>oedema.</b> <b>In</b> the brainstem, 11 cases showed inflammation and all cases showed parenchymal inflammation with seven cases showing moderate or severe clasmatodendrosis.

All fatal cases showed evidence of pulmonary oedema; however, there was absence of direct pulmonary viral damage or myocarditis-induced damage and EV-A 71 viral antigen staining was negative.

40|$|Leakage {{of fluid}} from blood vessels, leading to oedema, {{is a key}} feature of many {{diseases}} including hyperoxic acute lung injury (HALI), which can occur when patients are ventilated with high concentrations of oxygen (hyperoxia). The molecular mechanisms driving vascular leak and <b>oedema</b> <b>in</b> HALI are poorly understood. VEGF-D is a protein that promotes blood vessel leak and <b>oedema</b> when overexpressed <b>in</b> tissues, but the role of endogenous VEGF-D <b>in</b> pathological <b>oedema</b> was unknown. To address these issues, we exposed Vegfd-deficient mice to hyperoxia. The resulting pulmonary <b>oedema</b> <b>in</b> Vegfd-deficient mice was substantially reduced compared to wild-type, as was the protein content of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, consistent with reduced vascular leak. Vegf-d and its receptor Vegfr- 3 were more highly expressed in lungs of hyperoxic, versus normoxic, wild-type mice, indicating that components of the Vegf-d signalling pathway are up-regulated in hyperoxia. Importantly, VEGF-D and its receptors were co-localized on blood vessels in clinical samples of human lungs exposed to hyperoxia; hence, VEGF-D may act directly on blood vessels to promote fluid leak. Our studies show that Vegf-d promotes <b>oedema</b> <b>in</b> response to hyperoxia in mice and {{support the hypothesis that}} VEGF-D signalling promotes vascular leak in human HALI...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE. To {{evaluate}} {{the hypothesis that}} pulmonary venous congestion and <b>oedema</b> manifested predominantly <b>in</b> the right upper lobe in children with mitral regurgitation occur more frequently than previously thought. MATERIALS AND METHODS. Three radiologists retrospectively and independently reviewed the plain chest radiographs of 54 children (26 girls, 28 boys, age range 2 days- 18 years, median 9. 5 years) with mitral regurgitation admitted to our institution during a 5 -year period. Radiographs showing pulmonary venous congestion and <b>oedema</b> manifested predominantly <b>in</b> the right upper lobe were identified. Clinical records of these patients were studied to exclude other causes of pulmonary disease. RESULTS. Radiographic signs of pulmonary venous congestion and <b>oedema</b> were present <b>in</b> all patients, with redistribution of flow and interstitial <b>oedema</b> <b>in</b> 39 patients (72 %) and alveolar <b>oedema</b> <b>in</b> 15 children (28 %).

Pulmonary venous congestion and oedema involving predominantly the upper lobe of the right lung in children with mitral regurgitation occur more frequently than previously thought.
