50|$|Some ichthyofauna species, such as anchovy, garfish, Black Sea whiting and pickerel, {{visit the}} Sea of Azov from the Black Sea for spawning.

Unlike the Black Sea plankton which does not adapt well to the low salinity of the Sea of Azov and concentrates near the Kerch Strait, fishes and invertebrates of the Black Sea adjust well. They are often stronger than the native species, are used to the relatively low temperatures of the Black Sea and survive winter in the Sea of Azov well.|$|E

40|$|Indigenous {{people live}} in places that {{non-indigenous}} people generally consider nature. As these peoples’ livelihoods often are in this nature, their lives are frequently bureaucratised in ways {{that most of us}} would never encounter. This article describes my long-term effort to find ways to explore such bureaucratic processes in practice as part of my contribution to an environmental anthropology. I describe how I methodologically and theoretically explore such processes by using two examples of my writing, the articles “Blåfjella-Skjækerfjella nasjonalpark: Naturforvaltning som produksjon av natur/sted” and “Enacting Human and Non-Human Indigenous Salmon, Sami and Norwegian Natural Resource Management”. The first text describes Sami reindeer herders fighting the establishment of a national park. The other concerns an attempt of the Directorate of Nature Management to reregulate <b>sea</b> <b>salmon</b> fishing. Comparing these two articles, I show the variety of bits of nature that are materialised in bureaucratic process. Agency within such bureaucratic processes is explored with references to the materialities of the coined terms, texts bits, conventions and other legal references, as well as the numbers produced in the documents. Circulated, these bits of nature certainly influence the outcome of environmental controversies – they can contribute to naturalising particular narratives or foreseen outcomes...|$|E
40|$|The trade {{kinds of}} fish such as salmon trout, the Baltic <b>Sea</b> <b>salmon,</b> hoopid salmon, trout, carp and thylapia have been investigated. The {{purpose of the}} work: to reveal the {{functioning}} properties of the fish organism under the effect of dalargin at {{the early stages of}} the ontogenesis, to estimate the physiological state of the fry and adult fish on a complex of the morpho-physiological indicators, and to study the remote sequences of application of this substance. For the first time, the influence of the synthetic opioid peptide - dalargin on the morpho-physiological indicators of fishes. The method of the fish vitality has been developed. A positive influence of the dalargin on the growth and absence of the negative influence on the reproduction system of fishes has been shown. It has been suggested to use the investigation results when growing the fry on the fish-breeding enterprises, trade enterprises which will allow to increase the effectiveness of the work of the fishery enterprises. It is a perspective in the increase of fish production of the internal reservoirs. The dalargin has been introduced in the trout fishery "Skhodnya" and Novooskolsky Zonal Fish-Breeding Enterprise. Use of dalargin increases the vitality of hard-roe and larvas, increases the fishes growth which results in the effectiveness of the fishery farms work as a wholeAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|E
40|$|The Major Histocompatibility Complex (Mhc) {{genes are}} {{crucial for the}} {{recognition}} of self and non-self peptides by the immune defence system. They are extremely variable in most studied vertebrate species. I have studied the extent {{and the importance of}} Mhc variation in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), mainly from the Baltic Sea. Levels of Mhc heterozygosity in hatchery populations of salmon were between 0. 5 and 0. 8, the lowest values in a hatchery where a lower annual number of breeders were used. In a wild, naturally spawning population, heterozygosity was 0. 7, which is in between the levels observed in the hatcheries. The origin and maintenance of the high level of Mhc variation is a contentious issue. My results show {{that there is only one}} single Mhc class II B gene in Atlantic salmon, and indicate that point mutations are not the sole origin of variation in this single gene. New alleles appear to result from recombination. Mhc variation is assumed to be maintained by some kind of balancing selection, which is supported by my results. Balancing selection may be in terms of over-dominance selection (heterozygote advantage) or frequency dependent selection. I have not found any support for over-dominance selection. I found that certain Mhc alleles were associated with furunculosis, a bacterial infection as well as the syndrome M 74, which has caused high mortality in Baltic <b>Sea</b> <b>salmon.</b> There was however, no association between heterozygosity and either furunculosis or M 74. These results, together with the lack of an excess of heterozygous individuals in the natural population, support that frequency dependent selection rather than over-dominant selection, is the main mechanism for maintaining Mhc variation...|$|E
