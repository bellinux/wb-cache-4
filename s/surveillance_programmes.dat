Data were analysed using a mixed logit model to evaluate preferences and identify the relative importance of each attribute. Results: A total of 122 participants completed the survey (response rate 66 %) over a 5 -week period. Excluding 22 who mismatched a duplicate choice scenario, analysis was conducted on 100 responses. The key findings included: 72 % of stakeholders exhibited a preference for a <b>surveillance</b> <b>programme</b> with continuous mandatory core components (mean coefficient 0. 640 (p< 0. 01)), 65 % for a standard surveillance protocol where patient-level data are collected on infected and non-infected patients (mean coefficient 0. 641 (p< 0. 01)), and 92 % for hospital-level data that are publicly reported on a website and not associated with financial penalties (mean coefficient 1. 663 (p< 0. 01)). Conclusions: The use of the DCE has provided a unique insight to key stakeholder priorities when considering a national HAI <b>surveillance</b> <b>programme.</b> The application of a DCE offers a meaningful method to explore and quantify preferences in this setting.

40|$|Consequences of {{classical}} swine fever (CSF) epidemics depend on the control measures, {{but also on the}} number of infected herds {{at the end of the}} high-risk period (HRP). <b>Surveillance</b> <b>programmes</b> aim to keep this number as low as possible, so the effectiveness of <b>surveillance</b> <b>programmes</b> can be measured by the number of infected herds at the end of the HRP. In this paper, an evaluation of the effectiveness of the following five Dutch CSF <b>surveillance</b> <b>programmes</b> is presented: (1) routine gross pathology of severely diseased pigs; (2) routine virological tests of tonsils of all pigs, submitted under 1; (3) daily clinical observation by the farmer; (4) periodic clinical inspection by a veterinarian; (5) leucocyte counts in blood samples from diseased animals on a herd where antimicrobial 'group therapy' is started. The evaluation was done by a modelling study, in which virus transmission, disease development, and actions and diagnostic tests in <b>surveillance</b> <b>programmes</b> were simulated. Also, the yearly costs of the programmes were calculated, and direct costs of CSF epidemics were related to the number of infected herds at the end of the HRP. It appeared that the current Dutch <b>surveillance</b> <b>programmes,</b> without the leucocyte counts, keep the number of infected herds at the end of the HRP below 20 with 95 % probability. Leaving out the most-expensive programme of periodic inspection (12. 5 M¿ per year) does not change this result - indicating that (for CSF surveillance) the programme could well be stopped. If the leucocyte programme, which is currently not effective due to the low sample submission rate, optimally were applied, the 95 th percentile could be reduced to 10 infected herds. However, whether application is beneficial is unclear, because of uncertainty of the economic benefits due to the many expected false-positive herds each year...|$|E
