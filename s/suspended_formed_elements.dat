40|$|Major {{influence}} on the form of migration of trace elements in the North Caspian has Volga runoff. The bulk of the elements in the Volga waters carried in the suspended solids. The exception is zinc, transports mainly in dissolved form. In article {{presents the results of}} a study of dissolved and <b>suspended</b> <b>forms</b> of zinc, copper, lead, and manganese in the surface water of the North Caspian Sea from 2002 to 2009. On the basis of the received data the ratio of dissolved and <b>suspended</b> <b>forms</b> of trace <b>elements</b> studied. According to calculations, the bulk of the copper, lead and manganese is carried in the suspended solids. Zinc migrates mainly in dissolved form. The dominant form of migration of the metal increases, depending on the season. For zinc, the migrant in the ionic state, and for copper, lead, manganese, transferring primarily in suspension, in the autumn period the increase in the proportion of dissolved (Zn) and <b>suspended</b> <b>forms</b> (Cu, Pb, Mn), respectively. Increase in the proportion of ionic forms of metals in the North Caspian occurred episodically in local areas.

40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{research}} was to investigate the dynamics of trace metals (Cu, Zn, Mn, Co, Ni, Mo, V, Pb, Cd etc) in water, sediments, and the accumulation in the plants, invertebrates and organs and tissue of Cyprinidae and Percidae fish from Dniester river ecosystems. The interrelationships of abiotic and biotic factors and the effects of impaired water quality on biota were studied. The use of fertilizers and pesticides for agricultural purposes affects directly the dynamics of Cu, Zn, Mn in aquatic systems (r= 0. 70 - 0. 92), and the pollution is intensified by the dismembered relief, the peculiarities of rainfall and intensive erosion processes. All these led to a continuing increase in trace element content downstream the rivers. The discharged wastewaters from industry contribute to freshwater pollution with Ni, Zn, Cu, Ag and Cd (r= 0. 73) and change the ratio of dissolved and <b>suspended</b> <b>forms</b> of trace <b>elements,</b> this being characteristic especially for Chisinau, Bender, Tiraspol, Soroca, during low water period. The zone of confluence of Dniester river with its tributaries – Raut Bic were observed increase the concentration of trace metals (Ni, Pb, Zn, Cd, Cu, Ag, Sn). The building of hydrotechnical constructions on the Dniester river led to changes in the ratio of dissolved and <b>suspended</b> <b>forms</b> of trace <b>elements</b> and migration of trace elements in the systems: water- suspended matter-sediments-hydrobionts. The aquatic plants and the species of aquatic invertebrates are metal macro-concentrators, and can be used as effective biomonitor organisms in monitoring programs, water filtrators, but also can be secondary sources in water pollution. The maximum concentrations were observed in the aquatic plants, the species of aquatic invertebrates and fish from Cuciurgan reservoir, the minimum were observed in Dubasari reservoir. Water sediments are the most stable compounds of freshwater ecosystems. The concentration of Zn, Cu, Pb, Ni, Mo and V in water sediments was 2 - 7 times higher than in the soil. The maximum concentration of trace elements in water sediments were found in Cuciurgan reservoir, while the minimal - in Dniester River. A direct dependence of the content of trace elements in silt on clay particles with a diameter smaller than 0. 01 mm was found (r= 0. 86 - 0. 97) ...|$|R

DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The device comprises a device for holding the cylindrical workpieces in an operating point, a laser beam source for sending a laser beam, and beam <b>forming</b> <b>elements</b> for guiding the laser beam to the operating point. A first beam <b>forming</b> <b>element</b> is inserted for producing an annular beam in a beam path and a second beam <b>forming</b> <b>element</b> is provided for specifying an incident angle of the annular beam on the cylindrical workpieces in the operating point. The first beam <b>forming</b> <b>element</b> is <b>formed</b> as a double-axicon (4) with parts (5, 6) that are spaced apart from each other, and as diffractive optical element for producing the annular beam. The distance of {{the parts of the}} double-axicon specifies the annular diameter of the beam, and is infinitely adjustable for obtaining different annular diameters of the beam. The second beam <b>forming</b> <b>element</b> is a further axicon, which guides the annular beam to the operating point and is formed as a phase axicon (14) and a parabolic mirror, and is a focus optic. A plane mirror (11) is arranged between the beam <b>forming</b> <b>elements</b> for deflecting the annular beam. The plane mirror is downstream to the focus optic, and is slitted or splitted. A structure is incorporated as an additional sphere, aspherical or diffractive structure for the production of a divergent or convergent reflected ray in the phase axicon or the parabolic mirror for the reduction of the power density of the beam at the operating point. The laser beam source is subordinated to a telescope for the adjustment of the laser beam diameter and optionally power density at the operating point. The plane mirror is processible for equipping the holding device. The laser beam source is a carbon dioxide laser (1). USE - Device for processing cylindrical workpieces such as optical elements.

40|$|The {{geometry}} of convex-concave landslopes {{is described by}} empirical equations, so that shape, scale, and <b>form</b> <b>elements</b> may be compared numerically. Gradient-length relations determine intervals over which particular <b>form</b> <b>elements</b> exist, and over which particular equations apply. Three segments of slopes are defined, an upper convex ele-ment, a middle straight element, and a lower concave element, where the change in gradient with length is respectively positive, zero, and negative. The use of gradient data allows accurate definition of <b>form</b> <b>elements</b> and the intervals over which they exist. Use of pro-file data alone results in incorrect determination of <b>form</b> <b>elements</b> and inaccurate numerical description. The slopes studied occur in southwestern Ohio, have straight contours, and are de-veloped on kames, end moraines, and shale hills. Numerical constants obtained from profile and gradient relations accurately describe each slope element. A middle straight element is demonstrated to exist, but is absent in 30 per cent of the slopes studied. Re-lationships among numerical constants and parent materials indicate highly similar geo-metric forms, apparently different only in scale. Persistence of equivalent <b>form</b> <b>elements</b> from long to short slopes implies that length of runoff is not the determining factor in shaping convex-concave profiles, and {{that the presence of}} the convex element does not depend on dominance of processes of creep over those of runoff...|$|R

The enzyme xanthine oxidase, combined with its substrate purine and an iron source, was used to generate free radicals in the venous circulation. The <b>suspended</b> <b>form</b> of xanthine oxidase, with substrate, produced a transient, significant depression in the contractile indices dP dt− 1 max and dP dt− 1 P− 1 and arterial blood pressure, 1146 ± 87 mm Hg s− 1, 9 ± 1 s− 1, and 18 ± 1 mm Hg, respectively. This could not be attenuated by the enzymatic free radical scavengers superoxide dismutase and catalase.

The maximum soluble dose of the crystalline form of the enzyme when employed in the generating system had no effect upon administration despite its production of superoxide radicals in vitro.
