40|$|French il y a & c’est clefts: a corpus-based {{analysis}} of their Information Structure Lena Karssenberg & Karen Lahousse, KU Leuven Whereas the well-studied c’est-cleft (1) is prototypically associated with a focus-background (value-variable, ‘specificational’) interpretation, il y a-clefts (2) are usually said to have an all-focus (‘presentational’) interpretation (Lambrecht 2000). (1) Q: Who’s singing? A: C’est Louis qui chante. (2) Q: What’s happening? A: Il y a mon chef qui arrive. Il y a-clefts are relatively under-researched and {{have not yet been}} described on the basis of corpus research. 2. GOAL In this talk we will challenge two hypotheses in previous literature concerning clefts: (i) we will show that il y a-clefts do not only have an all-focus interpretation, but, just as c’est-clefts, instantiate three possible Information Structure (IS) - articulations and (ii) that the specific IS-articulation of a cleft correlates with the presence/absence of an existential presupposition. 3. INFORMATION STRUCTURE 3. 1. Il y a-clefts. Our extensive corpus research in formal and informal written (Le Monde, YCCQA online forum) and informal spoken (CFFP) French shows (i) that, besides an all-focus articulation, il y a-clefts also (i) frequently express focus-background (3) (see also Davidse 1999 / 2014 on there-clefts) and (ii) that they can even have a (contrastive) topic- comment articulation (4) : (3) Q: Quelle est votre meilleure série du moment? A: "How I Met Your Mother" c'est génial, y'a aussi "Lost" qui est bien (YCCQA) (4) Ya les gens normaux qui doivent se lever a 10 h ou midi et aller au lycée pour la rentrée. Et ya moi qui doit se lever à 4 h du matin pour aller a mon lycée sport étude ! (www) 3. 2 C’est-clefts. Besides focus-background (1), c’est-clefts can also express all-focus (Doetjes et al. 2004) (5). Moreover, we show that informative-presupposition clefts (Prince 1978, Dufter 2008) (6) have a topic-comment articulation. (5) Sous le sommet en surplomb d'une falaise ( [...] .), un peintre amateur attend, rêvant de pouvoir dessiner un corbeau d'une espèce rare. Mais soudain c'est une jeune femme qui tombe dans le <b>vide</b> <b>sous</b> ses yeux.

De plus, c’est là que vous décèlerez les principaux clubs, bars et discothèques. (www) Thus, surprisingly, both c’est-clefts and il y a-clefts can express all three possible IS-articulations defined in Lambrecht (1994) : all-focus, topic-comment, focus-background. 4. EXISTENTIAL PRESUPPOSITION (EP) According to Reeve (2012) a. o., focus-background it-clefts presuppose the existence of a value that holds for the variable in the cleft relative clause. We show that, in French, this indeed holds for focus-background c’est-clefts (8) and focus-background il y a clefts, but not for all-focus (9) and topic-comment c’est and il y a clefts. (8) a. In (3) : at least one TV show is good = presupposed b. In (1) : someone is singing = presupposed (9) a. In (2) : at least one person is coming ≠ presupposed b. In (5) : someone falls into the depths ≠ presupposed We conclude that the presence/absence of an EP correlates with the IS-articulation of the cleft. REFERENCES Davidse, K. (1999).

40|$|C’est-clefts versus il y a-clefts in French Lena Karssenberg & Karen Lahousse (KU Leuven) 1. INTRO. We {{contrast}} c’est-clefts (1), {{which are}} prototypically {{associated with a}} specificational (focus-background, value-variable) interpretation, and il y a-clefts (2), which prototypically introduce a new event or entity and have a presentational (all- focus) interpretation (see Lambrecht 1988 / 2001 / 2004). (1) Focus-background c’est-cleft Qui t’a donné ce cadeau? – C’est Jean qui me l’a donné. (2) All-focus il y a-cleft Il y a le facteur qui arrive. (based on Lambrecht 2002 : 63) Whereas c’est-clefts have been well studied (see Doetjes et al. 2004), also {{on the basis of}} corpus research (Dufter 2008), il y a-clefts are relatively under-researched (but see Willems & Meulleman 2010, Choi-Jonin & Lagae 1997, Léard 1992, Giry-Schneider 1988) and have not often been described on the basis of corpus research. 2. GOAL. We will first show that, contrary to what has often been assumed before, both il y a- clefts and c’est-clefts instantiate all three possible Information Structure (IS) - articulations (all-focus, topic-comment, focus-background; see Lambrecht 1994) (section 3). We will then examine the presuppositional nature of the clefted element (CE) (section 4) and the coda (section 5), showing that, contrary to what has been claimed before, (i) as for the CE, it is not the distinction between c’est and il y a that accounts for the different presuppositional nature of different types of clefts, but rather their specific IS-articulation, and (ii) concerning the coda, il y a-clefts behave differently from c’est-clefts, which could be explained from the semantics of c’est and il y a. Hence, the different properties of the different types of clefts stem from the interaction between their information-structural and semantic properties. 3. IS. 3. 1. Il y a-clefts. We will first present the results of corpus research (in formal and informal written and spoken French: Le Monde, Yahoo Q&A, CFFP) showing (i) that, as has been argued for by Davidse (1999 / 2000) for English there-clefts, il y a- clefts frequently have a specificational (focus-background) articulation (3), in which the CE enumerates the values which satisfy the variable given in the coda, and (ii) that they can even have a topic-comment articulation (4), with a contrastive topic in Büring’s (1997 / 2003) sense. To our knowledge, this has not been observed before. (3) Focus-background il y a-cleft Quelle est votre meilleure série du moment? - "How I Met Your Mother" c'est génial, y'a aussi "Lost" qui est bien (Yahoo) (4) (Contrastive) topic – comment il y a-cleft Ya les gens normaux qui doivent se levé a 10 h ou midi et aller au lycée pour la rentré.

(www) ~ Je dis à propos des gens normaux qu’ils doivent se lever à 10 h, et je dis à propos de moi que je dois me lever à 4 h du matin. 3. 2 C’est-clefts. Apart from focus-background c’est-clefts (1), c’est-clefts have also been said to express all-focus (Doetjes et al. 2004) (5). Moreover, as for “informative- presupposition clefts” (Prince 1981) (i. e. “non-contrastive anaphoric clefts”, Blanche- Benveniste 2006) (6), we will argue that they have a topic-comment articulation, as Reinhart’s (1981) tests (7) show: (5) All-focus c’est-cleft Sous le sommet en surplomb d'une falaise de la côte sud de l'Angleterre, ( [...] .), un peintre amateur attend, rêvant de pouvoir dessiner un corbeau d'une espèce rare. Mais soudain c'est une jeune femme qui tombe dans le <b>vide</b> <b>sous</b> ses yeux (www) (6) Topic-comment c’est-cleft ￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼ [texte touristique sur Berlin] C’est dans la section est, autrefois la partie soviétique, que j’ai été le plus charmé ( [...] .). De plus, c’est là que vous décèlerez les principaux clubs, bars et discothèques. (www) (7) a. - Que sais-tu à propos de la section est de Berlin? - C’est là que vous décèlerez les principaux clubs, bars et discothèques. b. J’ajoute à propos de la section est de Berlin que c’est là que vous trouverez les principaux clubs, bars et discothèques. The existence of these clefts, in which all the new information is in the coda, contradicts Doetjes et al’s hypothesis that “we do not expect there to be a third type of cleft, in which all focused material would be located inside the coda”. 3. 3. Consequence. From 3. 1. and 3. 2. it follows that, surprisingly, both c’est-clefts and il y a-clefts can express all three possible IS-articulations defined by Lambrecht. 4. EXISTENTIAL PRESUPPOSITION OF THE CE. Whereas {{it has been argued that}} specificational it-clefts in English imply the existence of the CE (Reeve 2012), as far as we can tell, this has not been studied for French c’est/il y a clefts. 4. 1. Il y a-clefts. We will first show that in focus-background il y a-clefts (8), the existence of the CE is presupposed, but not in all-focus il y a-clefts (9) and topic-comment il y a-clefts (10), i. e. the paraphrases (9 - 10) are infelicitous in the same context as the cleft. (8) Focus-background il y a-cleft: existence of CE is presupposed (3) = Au moins une série est bien (variable), à savoir LOST (value). (9) All-focus il y a-cleft: existence of CE is NOT presupposed (2) ≠ Au moins une personne arrive, à savoir le facteur. (10) Topic-comment il y a-cleft: existence of CE is NOT presupposed (4) ≠ Au moins une personne doit se lever à 4 h, à savoir moi. 4. 2. C’est-clefts. In contrast with focus-background c’est-clefts (11), all-focus (12) and topic-comment c’est-clefts (13) do not presuppose the existence of the CE. (11) Focus-background c’est-cleft: existence of CE is presupposed (1) = Quelqu’un m’a donné un cadeau, à savoir Jean. (12) All-focus c’est-cleft: existence of CE is NOT presupposed (5) ≠ Au moins une personne tombe dans le vide, à savoir une jeune femme. (13) Topic-comment c’est-cleft: existence of CE is NOT presupposed (6) ≠ Vous décèlerez les principaux clubs quelque part, à savoir à Berlin est. 4. 3. We conclude that it is not the opposition between ce and il that determines the presence/absence of the existential presupposition in both types of clefts, but the opposition +/– specificational (focus-background >< all-focus and topic-comment). 5. PRESUPPOSITIONAL NATURE OF CODA. Considering only focus-background and all-focus c’est-clefts, Doetjes et al. argue that the material in the coda is semantically presupposed, because of the embedded nature of the coda. This predicts the material in the coda of il y a-clefts to be presupposed as well, contrary to fact: (14) Focus-background il y a-clefts [Context: Q: Quelles séries sont bien?] A: – Il y a Lost qui est bien. a. – Ce n’est pas vrai: Lost n’est pas bien, tous les critiques sont d’accord sur ça. b. – Il y a Lost qui est probablement bien. The application of the negation test (14 a), as well as the presence or absence of epistemic modal markers in the coda (Haegeman 2006, Verstraete 2007, Lahousse 2010) (14 b), shows that the coda is not semantically presupposed in all six types of clefts. In contrast, we will show that the presuppositional nature of the coda depends on the specific discourse semantics of c’est [which has been argued to have an exhaustive or contrastive interpretation, except in topic-comment c’est-clefts] and il y a [which can have an ‘enumerative’ or a contrastive interpretation]. status: accepte...|$|R

Consequence. From 3. 1. and 3. 2. it follows that, surprisingly, both c’est-clefts and il y a-clefts can express all three possible IS-articulations. 4. EXISTENTIAL PRESUPPOSITION (EP). According to Reeve (2012), focus- background it-clefts in English presuppose the existence of a value that holds for the variable in the cleft relative clause. As far as we can tell, this has not been studied for French clefts. We will show that focus-background il y a / c’est-clefts (8) carry an EP, in contrast with all-focus clefts (9) and topic-comment clefts (10), which do not. (8) Focus-background il y a / c’est-cleft: existence of CE is presupposed a. In (3) : at least one TV show is good = presupposed b. In (1) : someone gave me a present = presupposed (9) All-focus il y a / c’est-cleft: existence of CE is NOT presupposed a. In (2) : at least one person is coming ≠ presupposed b. In (5) : someone falls into the depths ≠ presupposed (10) Topic-comment il y a / c’est-cleft: existence of CE is NOT presupposed a. In (4) : at least one person has to get up early ≠ presupposed b. In (6) : you will find the main bars somewhere ≠ presupposed We will conclude that the EP is not present in all types of clefts, but rather, that its presence/absence correlates with the specific IS-articulation of the cleft. 5. SYNTAX OF IL Y A CLEFTS. 5. 1. We will first argue against a ‘high’ analysis for clefts (Meinunger 1997 / 1998; Frascarelli & Ramaglia 2009 / 2013; Sleeman 2011; Kiss 1998), in which both il y a and the clefted element (CE) are in Rizzi’s (1997) left periphery: (i) the CE does not necessarily have the typical interpretation associated with left-peripheral foci; (ii) the CE can undergo WH-movement (11), and, hence, does not occupy the single FocP position in the left periphery (see Haegeman, Meinunger & Vercauteren (2009) ’s argument against a high analysis for it-clefts). (iii) Because of its formal variation in tense and mood, as well as its non-referential character, il y a cannot be argued to be a pure focus marker (Klein 2012) or a left- peripheral topic. (iv) In contrast with other constructions involving a moved left- peripheral focus (Haegeman & Ürögdi 2010), il y a clefts occur in temperal clauses (12), which shows that there is no intervention effect between the movement of the temporal operator and the movement of the CE to the left periphery. (11) Qui y a-t-il tqui qui joue du piano? = Il y a qui qui joue du piano? (Fuchs 2009) (12) Quand il y a une personnalité importante qui meurt (CFPP 2000) 5. 2. We will then argue in favor of an analysis for il y a clefts in which (i) the expletive il is in SpecIP, where it satisfies EPP; (ii) the verb a (and the clitic y) is in I°, the regular position for inflected verbs in French, where it also precedes Cinque’s (1999) high (13) and low (14) adverbs; (iii) the CE is in its base-generation position and (iv) the cleft relative clause is extraposed, as (15) shows (see Hedberg 2000 for an overview of extraposition of the cleft relative clause in it-clefts, see also Rizzi 2010) : (13) Il y a probablement un psychopathe qui sommeille en vous [...] .
