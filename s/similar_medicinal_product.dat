40|$|An {{orphan drug}} is a {{medicinal}} product {{intended for the}} treatment of a rare disease that affects {{only a small number of}} patients, e. g., five in ten thousand. According to the current European orphan drug legislation, the European Union shall not, for a period of ten years, accept another orphan medicinal product for the same therapeutic indication, in respect of a <b>similar</b> <b>medicinal</b> <b>product.</b> Thus far, the European Medicines Agency has used human judgments of similarity when assessing new medicines for rare diseases. The project reported here seeks to develop quantitative methods for this purpose. The project began with an analysis of the correlation between human and computed judgments of similarity for 100 pairs of molecules chosen from the Drug Bank 3. 0 database. The human similarity assessments for these pairs of molecules were obtained from a total of 143 experts from Europe, Asia and the US, with the experts being asked to state whether each pair was, or was not, similar. The percentage of the experts judging a pair to be similar was then compared to the Tanimoto coefficient computed using a range of different types of descriptors (1 D, 2 D and 3 D), with the aim of identifying those descriptors that correlated most closely with the human judgments. The following types of fingerprint were studied: ECFP 4, ECFC 4, Daylight, Unity, BCI, MDL as implemented in the Pipeline Pilot system; and CDK Extended, CDK Standard, Estate, PubChem, MACCS, Morgan, Feat Morgan, Atom Pair, Torsion, RDKit, Avalon, Layers, FP:TGD and FP:TGT as implemented in the KNIME system. The 3 D fingerprints studied were the following: FP:TAD and FP:TAT as implemented in the KNIME protocol. 1 D molecular property descriptors were also studied but these proved to be of only limited effectiveness for this application. Logistic regression models were developed for each type of descriptor, relating the Tanimoto similarity for a pair of molecules computed with the probability of the human experts regarding that pair as being similar. The resulting regression models were then validated using a separate test-set containing 100 pairs of molecules that had previously been evaluated by the European Medicines Agency in the context of the authorisation of medicines for rare diseases. The best models were able to reproduce over 95...|$|E

40|$|AbstractAfter the {{expiration}} of patents on originator biological products, Jordanian local manufacturers and {{the agents of}} international pharmaceutical companies in Jordan started to submit registration dossiers for biosimilar products. The Jordan Food and Drug Administration (JFDA) is the national regulatory authority responsible for the registration of biosimilar products. Biosimilars are registered under the same regulations used for drugs until specific guidelines for registration of biological and biosimilar products are released. Those regulations are called Criteria of Registration of Drugs, Vaccines, Sera and Biological Products, the Renewal of its Registration and the Cancellation of Any of them {{which was published in}} the official gazette in 2004 under the Provisional Law Number 80 of the year 2001, Drug and Pharmacy Law and its amendments of the year 2003.

Within the United States, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products shown to be biosimilar to, or interchangeable with, an FDA-licensed reference biological product.

40|$|Biosimilar <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> (biosimilars) {{have become}} a reality in the European Union and will soon be {{available}} in the United States. Despite an established legal pathway for biosimilars in the European Union since 2005 and increasing and detailed regulatory guidance on data requirements for their development and licensing, many clinicians, particularly oncologists, are reluctant to consider biosimilars as a treatment option for their patients. Major concerns voiced about biosimilars relate to their pharmaceutical quality, safety (especially immunogenicity), efficacy (particularly in extrapolated indications), and interchangeability with the originator product. In this article, the members and experts of the Working Party on <b>Similar</b> Biologic <b>Medicinal</b> <b>Products</b> of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) address these issues. A clear understanding of the scientific principles of the biosimilar concept and access to unbiased information on licensed biosimilars are important for physicians to make informed and appropriate treatment choices for their patients. This will become even more important with the advent of biosimilar monoclonal antibodies. The issues also highlight the need for improved communication between physicians, learned societies, and regulators...|$|R
40|$|The {{advent of}} <b>similar</b> {{biological}} <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> or ‘biosimilars’ in Europe in the 2000 s {{has led to}} development of a global biosimilars market and regulatory frameworks designed specifically for approval of biosimilars. Like originator biologicals, biosimilars exhibit greater molecular complexity than small-molecule drugs, including generics. Current estimates suggest that biosimilars are more expensive and require longer development times than generics. Regulatory and industry conferences have addressed how to achieve the appropriate level of regulation for biosimilars. Many originator biologicals feature support programmes or additional services {{that are designed to}} improve usage by patients, prescribers, and payers; these are not a mandatory part of the regulatory approval process. We refer to these features collectively as the ‘biologicals experience’ as described and discussed in this paper, and suggest that this experience should be an important element of consideration for the development of public policies on biosimilars...|$|R
40|$|Many of {{the best-selling}} ‘blockbuster’ {{biological}} <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> are, or will soon be, facing competition from <b>similar</b> biological <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> (biosimilars) in the EU. Biosimilarity {{is based on the}} comparability concept, which has been used successfully for several decades to ensure close similarity of a biological product before and after a manufacturing change. Over the last 10 years, experience with biosimilars has shown that even complex biotechnology-derived proteins can be copied successfully. Most best-selling biologicals are used for chronic treatment. This has triggered intensive discussion on the interchangeability of a biosimilar with its reference product, with the main concern being immunogenicity. We explore the theoretical basis of the presumed risks of switching between a biosimilar and its reference product and the available data on switches. Our conclusion is that a switch between comparable versions of the same active substance approved in accordance with EU legislation is not expected to trigger or enhance immunogenicity. On the basis of current knowledge, it is unlikely and very difficult to substantiate that two products, comparable on a population level, would have different safety or efficacy in individual patients upon a switch. Our conclusion is that biosimilars licensed in the EU are interchangeable...|$|R
40|$|A new {{cell-based}} <b>medicinal</b> <b>product</b> containing human regulatory macrophages, {{known as}} Mreg_UKR, {{has been developed}} and conforms to expectations of a therapeutic drug. Here, Mreg_UKR was subjected to pharmacokinetic, safety pharmacology, and toxicological testing, which identified no adverse reactions. These results would normally be interpreted {{as evidence of the}} probable clinical safety of Mreg_UKR; however, we contend that, owing to their uncertain biological relevance, our data do not fully support this conclusion. This leads us to question whether there is adequate scientific justification for preclinical safety testing of <b>similar</b> novel cell-based <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> using animal models. In earlier work, two patients were treated with regulatory macrophages prior to kidney transplantation. In our opinion, the absence of acute or chronic adverse effects in these cases is the most convincing available evidence of the likely safety of Mreg_UKR in future recipients. On this basis, we consider that safety information from previous clinical investigations of related cell products should carry greater weight than preclinical data when evaluating the safety profile of novel cell-based <b>medicinal</b> <b>products.</b> By extension, we argue that omitting extensive preclinical safety studies before conducting small-scale exploratory clinical investigations of novel cell-based <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> data may be justifiable in some instances...|$|R

40|$|Background: Slovenia aims to {{regulate}} and reimburse prices of <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> {{in order to}} manage and reduce public expenditure for <b>medicinal</b> <b>products.</b> Two levels of reference prices (R) are used: external R with a regulated maximum price and internal R with a maximum attributed value, defined by reference pricing for interchangeable <b>medicinal</b> <b>products.</b> The Health Insurance Institute of Slovenia covers expenses for their prescribed use and negotiates prices. The objective of our article was to confirm the basic thesis that the price regulation system and reimbursement have caused {{the decline in the}} regulated and reimbursed wholesale prices for <b>medicinal</b> <b>products.</b> Consequently, the decline in prices might contribute to a reduction of public expenditures for <b>medicinal</b> <b>products.</b> Methods: The research covered 760 regulated and reimbursed wholesale prices for both groups of <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> prescribed on an outpatient prescription and financed by public expenditures. The Laspeyres index and Wilcoxon signed ranks test are used to estimate the impact of wholesale price regulation system and reimbursement on the trends in nominal and real wholesale prices of <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> in the period 2003 – 2010. Results: The main thesis that the nominal and real wholesale prices of <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> declined during the years 2003 – 2010, was confirmed by the Laspeyres index. The Wilcoxon signed ranks test further confirmed the existence of statistically significant differences in the wholesale prices of <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> (p < 0. 05). With 5 % significance level, we can conclude that the regulated and reimbursed nominal and real wholesale prices of <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> have declined during the analysed years.

40|$|Abstract Background In {{order to}} {{facilitate}} multinational clinical research, regulatory requirements need to become international and harmonised. The EU introduced the Directive 2001 / 20 /EC in 2004, regulating investigational <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> in Europe. Methods We conducted a survey {{in order to identify}} the national regulatory requirements for major categories of clinical research in ten European Clinical Research Infrastructures Network (ECRIN) countries-Austria, Denmark, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Spain, Sweden, and United Kingdom-covering approximately 70 % of the EU population. Here we describe the results for regulatory requirements for typical investigational <b>medicinal</b> <b>products,</b> in the ten countries. Results Our results show that the ten countries have fairly harmonised definitions of typical investigational <b>medicinal</b> <b>products.</b> Clinical trials assessing typical investigational <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> require authorisation from a national competent authority in each of the countries surveyed. The opinion of the competent authorities is communicated to the trial sponsor within the same timelines, i. e., no more than 60 days, in all ten countries. The authority to which the application has to be sent to in the different countries is not fully harmonised. Conclusion The Directive 2001 / 20 /EC defined the term 'investigational medicinal product' and all regulatory requirements described therein are applicable to investigational <b>medicinal</b> <b>products.</b> Our survey showed, however, that those requirements had been adopted in ten European countries, not for investigational <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> overall, but rather a narrower category which we term 'typical' investigational <b>medicinal</b> <b>products.</b> The result is partial EU harmonisation of requirements and a relatively navigable landscape for the sponsor regarding typical investigational <b>medicinal</b> <b>products.</b> </p...|$|R
40|$|Summary: The main {{consequences}} for the veterinary <b>medicinal</b> <b>product</b> sector of the recent wave of liberalisation in Africa’s livestock sector have been a proliferation of operators, a diversification of product origin and a general decline in product quality. In this context, all the stakeholders involved agree that legislation on veterinary <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> needs to be harmonised among the African countries.
