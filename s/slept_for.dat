5|$|Shazly {{visited the}} {{front in the}} early morning before the Israeli attack to form an {{assessment}} of the situation. He arrived at Second Army Headquarters where he was briefed on the situation, then went to 2nd Division's advanced headquarters, where he met Brigadier General Hasan Abu Sa'ada and visited the frontline troops. Many of the soldiers had not <b>slept</b> <b>for</b> two nights, but the successful crossing was a morale booster, a tonic as he described it.|$|E
5|$|This {{refers to}} the Seven Sleepers, the Catholic legend of seven Christian {{children}}, persecuted for their faith {{during the reign of}} the Roman emperor Decius, who fled to the shelter of a cave where they <b>slept</b> <b>for</b> more than 200 years. Donne, one of six or seven children and a baptised Catholic during a time of strong anti-Catholic sentiment from both the populace and the government, would certainly have been familiar with the story.|$|E
5|$|On April 30, 1968, Captain Jay R. Vargas, {{who was the}} {{commander}} of Company G, 2nd Battalion, 4th Marines, 9th Marine Amphibious Brigade, was sent with his men to an area around the village of Dai Do where two other Marine companies were in a battle with a North Vietnamese Army regiment. Even though Company G hadn’t <b>slept</b> <b>for</b> thirty-six hours, they went ashore at about one in the afternoon. The enemy attacked his men and had one of his platoons pinned down. Vargas went to rescue his platoon with a reserve platoon and was wounded by a grenade. He {{was able to take}} out three machine guns nests by himself before leading his men in hand-to-hand combat with the enemy soldiers in the nearby village.|$|E

5|$|According to Ibn Kathir, Uzair lived {{between the}} times of King Solomon {{and the time of}} Zachariah, father of John the Baptist. Some Quranic {{commentators}} viewed Uzayr as a learned scholar who sought to teach the people the forgotten laws of God. He is sometimes identified as the protagonist in the Quranic story of the man who <b>slept</b> <b>for</b> a hundred years (2:259). Some Islamic scholars held Uzayr {{to be one of the}} prophets. However, Islamic tradition also reports that God expunged Uzayr from the list of prophets because he refused to believe in qadar (predestination). Ibn Hazm, al-Samaw'al and other scholars put forth the view that Uzair (or one of his disciples) falsified the Torah, and this claim became a common theme in Islamic polemics against the Bible. Many aspects of later Islamic narratives show similarity to Vision of Ezra, an apocryphal text which seems to have been partially known to Muslim readers.|$|E
25|$|The {{captain of}} Flight 407 had <b>slept</b> <b>for</b> only six hours during the twenty-four {{hours before the}} accident, while the first officer had had eight hours sleep in the same period. The captain had flown a total 99 hours during the prior month, one hour short of the maximum 100 flying hours allowed by Emirates, while the first officer had flown 90 hours in the same period.|$|E
25|$|In 1964, Israeli {{physician}} Jacob Sheskin administered thalidomide to {{a patient}} critically ill with leprosy. The patient exhibited erythema nodosum leprosum(ENL), a painful skin condition, one of the complications of leprosy. This was attempted despite the ban on thalidomide's use, but results were favourable: the patient <b>slept</b> <b>for</b> hours {{and was able to}} get out of bed without aid upon awakening. A clinical trial studying the use of thalidomide in leprosy soon followed.|$|E

25|$|A {{survey of}} 1.1 million {{residents}} in the United States found that those that reported sleeping about 7 hours per night had the lowest rates of mortality, whereas those that <b>slept</b> <b>for</b> fewer than 6 hours or more than 8 hours had higher mortality rates. Getting 8.5 or more hours of sleep per night {{was associated with a}} 15% higher mortality rate. Severe insomnia– sleeping less than 3.5 hours in women and 4.5 hours in men– is associated with a 15% increase in mortality.|$|E
25|$|After {{receiving}} {{the last ice}} block, the crew put the ship in autopilot and went to hibernate with the passengers, leaving the ship's maintenance to robots. Except {{for a brief period}} of activity to start deceleration, the crew <b>slept</b> <b>for</b> most of the trip, awaking one year before reaching Eden. The plan was to continue deceleration while consuming the last of the ice shell, and then put the ship in orbit around the planet, delivering the passengers down by gliders that would be retrieved by hooks to be reused.|$|E
25|$|Case 2. This case {{illustrates}} autonomic status epilepticus {{with behavioral}} disturbances {{that would be}} difficult to attribute to seizure activity before the motor focal ictal events. A 6-year-old normal boy had a seizure at 4 years of age while traveling on a train with his parents who vividly described the event: “He was happily playing and asking questions when he started complaining that he was feeling sick, became very pale, and quiet. He did not want to drink or eat. Gradually, he was getting more and more pale, kept complaining that he felt sick, and became restless and frightened. Ten minutes from the onset, his head and eyes slowly turned to the left. The eyes were opened but fixed to the left upper corner. We called his name but he was unresponsive. He had completely gone. We tried to move his head but this was fixed to the left. There were no convulsions. This lasted for another 15 minutes, when his head and eyes returned to normal and he looked better, although he was droopy and really not there. At this stage he vomited once. In the ambulance, approximately 35 minutes from the onset, he was still not aware of what was going on, although he was able to answer simple questions with yes or no. In the hospital he <b>slept</b> <b>for</b> three quarters of an hour and gradually came around, but it took him another half to an hour before he became normal again”. EEG showed occipital paroxysms and MRI was normal. A similar prolonged episode, preceded by behavioral changes, occurred 8 months later at school. He received no medication. Since then he has been well.|$|E
6000|$|He had <b>slept</b> quietly <b>for</b> some time, {{when she}} roused {{him to give}} him some wine, as she was desired to do constantly. He smiled, and said, 'Is no one here but you?' ...|$|R

60|$|Despite Whopper's {{nightmare}} {{and what}} had followed, the boy hunters <b>slept</b> soundly <b>for</b> {{the rest of the}} night. All arose at daybreak and procured what was destined to be their last meal in the camp for that season.|$|R
500|$|In March 2016, Bhatt said to India.com {{that she}} was very excited about sharing screenspace with Shah Rukh Khan in the film. She had not <b>slept</b> <b>for</b> several nights during the shoot of the film.

500|$|The party <b>slept</b> <b>for</b> a {{few hours}} in rooms {{provided}} by one of the temples, during which Harrison heard [...] "huge heavenly choirs" [...] in his dreams and experienced [...] "the deepest sleep I had ever had in my life". After they had attended morning puja at this temple, at 4 am, Maharaj began singing a bhajan, a Hindu musical prayer. In the tradition of communal chanting, or kirtana, Harrison and the others there sang in response, repeating Maharaj's lines, for a period lasting up to five hours.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to the tired former prisoners and civilians, {{the majority of the}} Rangers had only <b>slept</b> <b>for</b> five to six hours over the past three days. The soldiers frequently had hallucinations or fell asleep as they marched. Benzedrine was distributed by the medics to keep the Rangers active during the long march. One Ranger commented on the effect of the drug: [...] "It felt like your eyes were popped open. You couldn't have closed them if you wanted to. One pill was all I ever took—it was all I ever needed." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{have just}} had a narrow escape of my life,' gasped the jackal, 'and I need some sleep. After that we must think of {{something}} to do to amuse ourselves.' And he lay down again and <b>slept</b> soundly <b>for</b> a couple of hours.|$|R
60|$|For {{many hours}} the sisters <b>slept</b> on, <b>for</b> {{they had come}} a long way, from a town where there was {{scarcely}} anything to eat, and felt weak and tired. But by-and-by they opened their eyes and saw the two birds watching them.|$|R
6000|$|It was {{the copy}} of our conference. [...] In bed she <b>slept</b> not, <b>for</b> my urging it; [...] At board she fed not, for my urging it; [...] Alone, it {{was the subject of}} my theme; [...] In company I often glanced at it.|$|R
500|$|Early in the evening, the {{disguised}} Loki and Thor {{meet with}} Þrymr and the assembled jötnar. Thor eats and drinks ferociously, consuming entire animals and three casks of mead. Þrymr finds the behaviour {{at odds with}} his impression of Freyja, and Loki, sitting before Þrymr and appearing as a [...] "very shrewd maid", makes the excuse that [...] "Freyja's" [...] behaviour is due to her having not consumed anything for eight entire days before arriving due to her eagerness to arrive. Þrymr then lifts [...] "Freyja's" [...] veil and wants to kiss [...] "her". Terrifying eyes stare back at him, seemingly burning with fire. Loki says that this is because [...] "Freyja" [...] has not <b>slept</b> <b>for</b> eight nights in her eagerness.|$|E
500|$|He {{took off}} again at about 8:25am, {{but was unable}} to reach his next {{scheduled}} stop at Crewe. [...] About 30miles outside Rugby a problem with the engine's inlet valves forced him to land in a field at Hademore, fourmiles outside of Lichfield—about 115miles into the 185-mile journey. [...] On landing, he damaged a skid, and his mechanics were telegraphed for. [...] While the necessary repairs were being made, Grahame-White ate lunch and then <b>slept</b> <b>for</b> a few hours, looked after by his mother, who had arrived by car. [...] Meanwhile, a large crowd of interested spectators gathered, and the farmer who owned the field charged them for admission. [...] Soldiers from a nearby barracks kept the public from getting too close to the biplane.|$|E
500|$|As Lennon {{was either}} touring or recording, {{supposed}} family holidays in 1966 were skiing in St. Moritz, with producer George Martin and his girlfriend, or {{staying at a}} castle in Ireland, with George Harrison and Pattie Boyd (Harrison's wife). Even these were subject to being discovered by fans, and Cynthia and Pattie had to escape the Irish location dressed as maids. [...] As {{a result of the}} long recording sessions and tours, Lennon usually <b>slept</b> <b>for</b> days afterwards. When Lennon started filming How I Won the War in Almeria, Spain, he promised his wife and son they could join him there after two weeks of filming. The small apartment they were allocated was swiftly replaced by a villa when Starr and his wife joined them.|$|E
60|$|Worn out {{completely}} {{by what they}} had passed through, the boys <b>slept</b> heavily <b>for</b> {{the rest of the}} night, not caring what ship they were on or where they were going. Everybody was busy with the wreckage, so they were left almost entirely to themselves.|$|R
60|$|Perhaps she <b>slept</b> peacefully <b>for</b> {{a little}} while after that, for though her head was still very painful, her mouth and throat felt less parched and dry. Through this sleep or semblance of sleep, she was {{conscious}} of the same pleasant voice softly droning Paters and Aves close to her ear.|$|R
60|$|The {{wind had}} been {{gradually}} rising and by midnight it was blowing half a gale, whistling shrilly around {{the cabin and}} through the heavy boughs of the neighboring trees.

500|$|The enquiry report {{submitted}} by the Civil Aviation Ministry said that Glušica <b>slept</b> <b>for</b> over 90 minutes during the flight. The Air India Express IX 812 [...] carrying 166 people from Dubai including the crew, crashed while negotiating a tricky landing at Mangalore city's [...] "table-top" [...] airport overlooking a ravine. The American National Transportation Safety Board says {{it was the first}} instance of snoring recorded on a Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR). Analysis of the accident revealed that had the pilot [...] "deployed détente reverse thrust and applied maximum manual braking at touchdown", the aircraft could have been stopped within the paved overrun area of the runway. The captain had exacerbated the long landing by attempting a go-around following deployment of the thrust reversers.|$|E
500|$|The Luftwaffe {{launched}} a major attack against key Maltese airfields at dawn on 20 March. Leggo, {{who had not}} <b>slept</b> <b>for</b> over 24hours, returned to the airfield {{in the early hours}} having spent the night with a girlfriend. As the German planes approached he was ordered to prepare to fly. Plagis attempted to stop his friend from going, but Leggo insisted on flying, and took off at 08:05 as {{part of a group of}} four Spitfires and 12 Hurricanes aiming to intercept a squadron of Messerschmitt Bf 109s. He was soon seen to be flying poorly. A German pilot noticed this and attacked Leggo from close range, seriously damaging his aircraft and forcing him to bale out. Another Bf 109 then swooped and either fired at Leggo or collapsed his parachute with its slipstream, causing him to fall to his death. When Plagis learned what had happened, he was inconsolable, holding himself responsible. In his journal, he vowed to [...] "shoot down ten for Doug—I will too, if it takes me a lifetime".|$|E
500|$|For Santopietro, Sinatra was the {{personification}} of America in the 1950s: [...] "cocky, eye on the main chance, optimistic, and full {{of the sense of}} possibility". Barbara Sinatra wrote that [...] "A big part of Frank's thrill was the sense of danger that he exuded, an underlying, ever-present tension only those closest to him knew could be defused with humor". [...] Cary Grant, a good friend of Sinatra's, stated that Sinatra was the [...] "most honest person he'd ever met", who spoke [...] "a simple truth, without artifice which scared people", and was often moved to tears by his performances. [...] Jo-Caroll Dennison commented that he possessed [...] "great inner strength", and that his energy and drive was [...] "enormous". A workaholic, he reportedly only <b>slept</b> <b>for</b> four hours a night on average. Throughout his life, Sinatra had mood swings and bouts of mild to severe depression, admitting to an interviewer in the 1950s that [...] "I have an over-acute capacity for sadness as well as elation". Barbara Sinatra stated that he would [...] "snap at anyone for the slightest misdemeanor", while Van Heusen said that when Sinatra got drunk it was [...] "best to disappear".|$|E

60|$|TENCH. [In a low voice, almost supplicating.] If {{you could}} see your way, sir, {{it would be a}} great relief to my mind, it would indeed.
