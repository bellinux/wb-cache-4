We combine field relations, <b>structural</b> geology, <b>petrology,</b> thermobarometry and geochronology to interpret the tectonic evolution of the Everest Himalaya. Lithospheric convergence of India and Asia since collision at c. 50 Ma. resulted in horizontal shortening, crustal thickening and regional metamorphism in the Himalaya and beneath southern Tibet. High temperatures (. 620 8 C) during sillimanite grade metamorphism were maintained for 15 million years from 32 to 16. 9 0. 5 Ma {{along the top of}} the Greater Himalayan slab. This implies that crustal thickening must also have been active during this time, which in turn suggests high topography during the Oligocene–early Miocene. Two low-angle normal faults cut the Everest massif at the top of the Greater Himalayan slab. The earlier, lower Lhotse detachment bounds the upper limit of massive leucogranite sills and sillimanite–cordierite gneisses, and has been locally folded.

Recent advances in the metamorphic <b>petrology,</b> <b>structural</b> geology, and geochronology of the upper allochthon in the Órdenes complex are integrated into a synthesis of its tectonic evolution, constraining the main tectonothermal events. Important aspects of this synthesis are (1) the interpretation of Cambro-Ordovician magmatism and earliest metamorphic event, as the result of drifting of a peri-Gondwanan terrane; (2) the subsequent shortening and crustal thickening of the terrane related to its subduction and accretion to Laurussia; (3) a younger cycle of shortening and extension resulting from convergence between Lau- russia and Gondwana; and (4) the emplacement of this exotic terrane as the upper allochthon, together with underlying ophiolitic and basal allochthons, during the Laurussia-Gondwana collision. Implications derived from the well-established tectonothermal sequence are discussed in the context of Paleozoic paleogeography and geodynamics.

40|$|International audienceDeciphering Variscan versus Alpine {{history in}} the {{internal}} Rif system {{is a key to}} constraining the tectonic evolution of the Alboran domain and hence the geodynamics of the western Mediterranean system during the Cenozoic. This study focuses on the evolution of the metamorphic envelope of the Beni Bousera massif and its relation to the underlying peridotites. Combining <b>structural</b> geology, metamorphic <b>petrology,</b> and LA-ICP-MS U-Th-Pb dating of monazite, this study contributes {{to the understanding of the}} tectonic history of the western internal Rif. The regional foliation (S 2) is characterized by LP/HT mineral assemblages and obliterates a former foliation (S 1) developed along a barrovian (MP/MT) metamorphic gradient. The dating of some metamorphic monazite grains from a micaschist and a migmatitic gneiss demonstrates that the crustal envelope of the peridotite recorded two distinct tectonometamorphic episodes. Data from monazite inclusions in S 1 garnet suggest that the first event, D 1, is older than 250 - 170 Ma and likely related to the Variscan collision, in agreement with the barrovian type of the metamorphic gradient. The second event, D 2, is Alpine in age (at circa 21 Ma) and corresponds to a strong lithosphere thinning allowing subsequent subcontinental mantle exhumation. Such a tectonic context provides an explanation for the LP/HT metamorphic gradient that is recorded in the regional foliation of the western Betic-Rif system. This extension is probably related to a subduction slab roll-back in the western end of the Mediterranean realm during the Oligo-Miocene times.

40|$|The {{incomplete}} Evros ophiolites in NE Greece form a NE-SW-oriented discontinuous belt in the Alpine orogen of {{the north}} Aegean. Field data, petrology and geochemistry are presented here for the intrusive section and associated mafic dykes of these ophiolites. Bodies of high-level isotropic gabbro and plagiogranite in the ophiolite suite are cross-cut by NE-SW-trending boninitic and tholeiitic-boninitic affinity dykes, respectively. The dykes fill tensile fractures or faults, which implies dyke emplacement in an extensional tectonic regime. The tholeiitic-transitional boninitic gabbro is REE- and HFS-depleted relative to N-MORB, indicating derivation from melting of a refractory mantle peridotite source. Associated boninitic dykes are slightly LREE-enriched, showing mineral and whole-rock geochemistry similar to the gabbro. The plagiogranite is a strongly REE-enriched high-silica trondhjemite, with textures and composition typical for an oceanic crust differentiate. Plagiogranite-hosted tholeiitic and transitional boninitic dykes are variably REE-enriched. Geochemical modelling indicates origin of the plagiogranite by up to 75 % fractional crystallization of basaltic magma similar to that producing the associated tholeiitic dykes. All mafic rocks have high LILE/HFSE ratios and negative Ta-Nb-Ti and Ce anomalies, typical for subduction zone-related settings. The mafic rocks show a similar trace-element character to the mafic lavas of an extrusive section in Bulgaria, suggesting they both form genetically related intrusive and extrusive suites of the Evros ophiolites.

Footwall sillimanite gneisses and leucogranites are exposed along the Kharta valley up to 57 km north of the Qomolangma detachment exposure near the summit of Everest. The amount of extrusion of footwall gneisses and leucogranites must have been around 200 km southwards, from an origin at shallow levels (12 - 18 km depth) beneath Tibet, supporting models of ductile extrusion of the Greater Himalayan slab. The Everest-Lhotse- Nuptse massif contains a massive ballooning sill of garnet muscovite tourmaline leucogranite up to 3000 m thick, which reaches 7800 m on the Kangshung face of Everest and on the south face of Nuptse, and is mainly responsible for the extreme altitude of both mountains. The middle crust beneath southern Tibet is inferred to be a weak, ductile-deforming zone of high heat and low friction separating a brittle deforming upper crust above from a strong (?granulite facies) lower crust with a rheologically strong upper mantle. Field evidence, thermobarometry and U-Pb geochronological data from the Everest Himalaya support the general shear extrusive flow of a mid-crustal channel from beneath the Tibetan plateau.

This work has provided {{a great deal of}} information on the mechanisms by which lenses collected light, drawing attention to the importance of the crystallographic orientation of lens calcite for focusing, and leading to sophisticated models of trilobite vision (Clarkson and Levi-Setti, 1975; Gál et al., 2000). The morphology and mode of life of phacopids, in particular Geesops, are well understood (Bruton and Haas, 2003 a; 2003 b) but observations on the internal structure of their lenses contradict the generally accepted models for image formation by schizochroal eyes. Recent technological advances have given new impetus to the analysis of crystalline materials and especially important has been electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD). This is a SEM-based technique that can be used to accurately ‘map’ variations in the crystallographic orientation of a sample down to the sub-micrometre scale by recording on a sensitive camera Kikuchi patterns that are formed by diffraction of an electron beam when focused on a polished sample tilted at 70 °.

Cornell University One of {{the major}} goals of the geoscience {{community}} is to develop an accurate tectonic history of North America. Understanding how our continent evolved through time has numerous implications for our ability to develop accurate models of the tectonic evolution of continents - how they form, deform, and break. The interactions of deformation, metamorphism, and plutonism, three fundamental geological processes at work throughout the evolution of continents, record {{information that can be}} used to better understand the mechanisms and events that have shaped our continent. This dissertation employs metamorphic <b>petrology,</b> <b>structural</b> geology, geochemistry and geothermobarometry to interrogate the interactions of deformation, metamorphism and plutonism on multiple scales across the southwest United States. On a microscope scale, this dissertation shows that deformation and metamorphism can work in a positive feedback loop, facilitated by solution mass transfer, to localize both deformation and metamorphism, producing areas of high strain that have more closely approached metamorphic equilibrium. This result informs our understanding of crustal behavior at mid-crustal depths during orogenesis. On the mountain range scale, this dissertation combines petrographic analysis, structural geology, geochemistry and geothermobarometry to show that metamorphism in the Tusas and Picuris Mountains of northern New Mexico is consistent with one metamorphic event following a pressure-temperature-time trajectory consistent with progressive loading during the formation of a fold and thrust belt. This result informs our understanding of the tectonic history of North America, and has implications for the petrogenesis of aluminosilicate triple-point rocks in the region. Finally, on a continental scale, this dissertation uses previously published geochronologic data to identify spatial patterns in the age of igneous bodies across the southwest United States. These results were used to characterize mesoproterozoic tectonism and develop a model for melt production of these plutons.

40|$|The linking of {{geophysical}} {{information to}} tectonometamorphic processes holds {{great potential for}} the surveying of vast remote areas of the planet and may allow for the transcendence of observational scales. Investigations concerning magnetic properties of the lower continental crust can reveal an incredible wealth of information concerning the conditions of metamorphism, regional extent of deformation, and controls on the magnetic architecture of the lithosphere. This dissertation presents three contributions aimed at the integration of <b>petrology,</b> <b>structural</b> geology, and rock magnetism in order to investigate the magnetic nature of the lower continental crust, constrain tectonometamorphic processes at the regional scale in a remote portion of the Canadian Shield, and develop a new instrument and procedure for magnetic imaging at the hand sample scale. The results of these contributions indicate that the lower continental crust is not particularly magnetic and {{does not support the}} hypothesis that the lower continental crust is sufficiently magnetic to account for satellite based long-wavelength anomalies. However, retrograde reactions may produce substantial quantities of magnetite within the middle crust, which may account for these anomalies. Aeromagnetic anomalies across the east Athabasca mylonite triangle are controlled by the mode of magnetite, which in the western Chipman domain was produced upon exhumation through middle crustal conditions. Syn-tectonic retrograde metamorphic reactions in this region produced magnetite in association with the influx of fluids, which was facilitated by a releasing bend geometry of the Cora Lake shear zone. Thermodynamic modeling of retrograde metamorphism suggests magnetite was produced at temperatures of 524 [...] 617 C and pressures of 599 [...] 740 MPa during an interval of time spanning from 1, 882 Ma to 1, 870 Ma. These data suggest an increase of oxygen fugacity relative to the magnetite-hematite buffer during exhumation into the middle crust aided in the production of magnetite. The ability to image the heterogeneous distribution of magnetite in samples with the new magnetic imaging device has provided much detail on the textural context of magnetite growth. Ultimately, the scale invariance of magnetism is a powerful tool for the transcendence of observational scale applied to geologic investigations...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Boston UniversityThe Anson {{quadrangle}} {{is located}} in west-central Maine in a region which offers complex problems in <b>structural</b> geology, <b>petrology,</b> and stratigraphy. The geomorphology is also considered in this study. The formations which make up the stratigraphy of the quadrangle include the following (from oldest to youngest) : The Perry Mountain, Parmachenee, Madrid, Kennebec, and Anson formations. The Perry Mountain formation, which outcrops only in the extreme northwest corner of the quadrangle, is composed of well bedded quartzites intercalated with sandy biotite-muscovite schists and staurolite schists. The Parmachenee formation consists of thinly bedded gray phyllites, impure biotite quartzites and black limestones. The formation contains notable amounts of pyrite and pyrrhotite. The Madrid formation is composed predominantly of calcareous quartzite with lime-silicate minerals in the middle grade metamorphic zones. The formation contains only minor amounts of argillaceous rocks, and calcareous beds, and sulfides are absent or inconspicuous. The quartzites grade upward into the Dyer Hill member which is composed of chloritoid-bearing black slates. The Kennebec formation is composed of thinly bedded black sulfide-rich limestones, phyllites, and quartzites. The Anson formation consists of brown-mottled grits and arenaceous phyllites. The brown spots are caused by the oxidation of siderite. The position and formational status of the Kennebec and Anson formations are still in doubt. The Anson formation correlates {{on the basis of}} similar lithology with the Vassalboro formation in the Vassalboro quadrangle, which is Clinton in age. The edge of two intrusive bodies project into the quadrangle the Black Hill pluton and the Sandy River pluton. Only one phase is present, quartz monzonite, which varies in texture from medium to coarse grain. The rocks near the Black Hill pluton show distinct contact metamorphic affects, including the presence of andalusite. The low-grade regionally metamorphosed rocks are restricted to the south and southeast portions of the quadrangle, while the mille-grade metamorphic zone is found in the north and northwest area. There is no well-defined garnet isograd. The relationship of the siderite to the sulfides is decreased in detail. Siderite formed at an oxidation potential higher than that needed for pyrite. The sideritic rocks formed near the shore of the marine basin where more oxygen was available. The pyrrhotite in this region was considered to have been formed from pyrite under metamorphic conditions. An alternate explanation is suggested: namely that initial sulfide from which the pyrrhotite formed may have been FeS rather than FeS 2. This would involve a subtraction of iron from the primitive FeS to form the pyrrhotite. The rocks containing the sulfides were formed in a strongly reducing environment, probably a barred basin with restricted circulation. The major fold structures trend northeast-southwest. The axial planes of the isoclinal folds are slightly overturned and dip to the northwest. The absence of noses of folds and the consistently steep dip of the beds may also be explained in terms of pleated folding. No large scale faulting has been observed in the quadrangle, although minor longitudinal faulting is not uncommon. Glaciation modified the pre-existing topography slightly by deposition and erosion. Glacial striations trend between S 20 °E and S 30 °E. Post-glacial geomorphic features, which include alluvial terraces, falls, ice push, discordant junctions, and sand dunes, are all described and their origins are discussed. The marine limit in the quadrangle is considered to be at least at the 400 foot elevation as evidenced by marine fossils found just south of the Anson quadrangle...|$|R

In this dissertation, I use metamorphic <b>petrology,</b> <b>structural</b> geology, and geochronology, in the context of field relationships, to study several of the nappe units. The result is a new age and tectonic framework for the Calabrian orogen. The Zangarona Schist, often the structurally highest unit in the accretionary wedge, records the early history of subduction in Calabria. I show that the high-pressure/high-temperature event recorded in these rocks did not occur at the beginning of Alpine-age subduction; instead, it was formed during an earlier event which took places in the Hercynian Orogen. The lack of a high-temperature metamorphic event, along with the considerable age of units {{at the time of their}} subduction, suggests that subduction started off in a cold thermal environment. The Diamante-Terranova ophiolite unit is a metabasalt and associated sedimentary cover which was metamorphosed in the lawsonite-blueschist facies. It is generally considered to have a greenschist-facies overprint [...] one which is common in circum-Mediterranean orogens. I show that this greenschist-facies overprint does not exist and that the rocks followed a counterclockwise pressure-temperature-time history. The lack of a warm-overprint allows for Ar/Ar geochronology to be used on high-pressure phengites, indicating a crystallization age of about 48 Myr. This age links the rocks to a west-dipping subduction zone that led to volcanism in Sardinia. The Frido Unit is a dominantly phyllite and quartzite unit which records changes in sedimentation during the approach of a unit of thinned continental crust to the Calabrian subduction zone. Although much of it appears to be a coherent unit, I show that the upper levels of the unit include chaotic blocks of metabasalt and serpentinite, deposited as a sedimentary mélange. Many of the Calabrian ophiolite units, previously considered to be distinct nappe units, have similar block-in-matrix relationships and also may be sedimentary mélanges consisting of previously-subducted material which has been re-deposited into the trench by underwater slides. Together, this re-evaluation of the Calabrian nappe stack indicates that subduction likely began in the Eocene in a cold thermal environment. Early-formed blueschist units were exhumed and re-deposited in the trench, eventually undergoing a second high-pressure metamorphic event. This same subduction zone exists today, to the southeast, as Ionian oceanic crust continues to subduct beneath Calabria...|$|R

Such important outcrops require appropriate management to safeguard them from potentially damaging and destructive activities. Damage done to such rock exposures can include drill sampling by geologist undertaken {{in the name of}} scientific advancement. In order to illustrate the serious damage scientific sampling can do, we give some examples of outcrops from Western Europe, North America and South Africa, important to <b>structural</b> geology and <b>petrology,</b> where sampling was undertaken by means of drilling methods without any protective measures. After the rock coring, the aesthetic and photographic value of these delicate outcrops has decreased considerably. Unfortunately, regulation and protection mechanisms and codes of conduct can be ineffective. The many resources of geological information available to the geoscientist community (e. g. via Internet, such as outcrops stored in websites like “Outcropedia”) promote access to sites of geological interest, but can also {{have a negative effect on}} their conservation. Geoethical education on rock sampling is therefore critical for conservation of the geological heritage. Geoethical principles and educational actions are aimed to be promoted at different levels to improve geological sciences development and to enhance conservation of important geological sites. Ethical protocols and codes of conduct should include geoconservation issues, being explicit about responsible sampling. Guided and inspired by the UK Geologists’s Association “Code of Conduct for Rock Coring” (MacFadyen, 2010), we present a tentative outline requesting responsible behaviour: » Drill sampling is particularly threatening because it has a negative visual impact, whilst it is often unnecessary. Before sampling, geologists should think about the question “is drill sampling necessary for the study being carried on?” » Do not take samples from the centre of a geological type locality or a site of especial scientific, didactic interest or aesthetical/photographic value. If an outcrop is spectacular enough to be photographed, then you should not core or sample the rock face that has been recorded. The same applies to outstanding outcrops stored in websites. » Sample other parts of the same or a neighbouring outcrop where there is less impact. Core samples must be discrete in location; take cores from the least exposed, least spectacular part of an outcrop and try to plug the holes using the outer end of the core, if possible. » Before sampling ask experts and authorities (e. g. Natural Reserve or National Park managers if the area is protected) for advise and permission. References: MacFadyen, C. C. J., 2010.

40|$|The strain-stress state {{generated}} by faulting or cracking and {{influenced by the}} strong heterogeneity of the internal earth structure precedes and accompanies volcanic and seismic activity. Particularly, volcanic eruptions are the culmination of long and complex geophysical processes and physical processes which involve the generation of magmas in the mantle or in the lower crust, its ascent to shallower levels, its storage and differentiation in shallow crustal chambers, and, finally, its eruption at the Earth’s surface. Instead, earthquakes are a frictional stick-slip instability arising along pre-existing faults within the brittle crust of the Earth. Long-term tectonic plate motion causes stress to accumulate around faults until the frictional strength of the fault is exceeded. The study of these processes has been traditionally carried out through different geological disciplines, such as <b>petrology,</b> <b>structural</b> geology, geochemistry or sedimentology. Nevertheless, {{during the last two}} decades, the development of physical of earth as well as the introduction of new powerful numerical techniques has progressively converted geophysics into a multidisciplinary science. Nowadays, scientists with very different background and expertises such as geologist, physicists, chemists, mathematicians and engineers work on geophysics. As any multidisciplinary field, it has been largely benefited from these collaborations. The different ways and procedures to face the study of volcanic and seismic phenomena do not exclude each other and should be regarded as complementary. Nowadays, numerical modeling in volcanology covers different pre-eruptive, eruptive and post-eruptive aspects of the general volcanic phenomena. Among these aspects, the pre-eruptive process, linked to the continuous monitoring, is of special interest because it contributes to evaluate the volcanic risk and it is crucial for hazard assessment, eruption prediction and risk mitigation at volcanic unrest. large faults. The knowledge of the actual activity state of these sites is not only an academic topic but it has crucial importance in terms of public security and eruption and earthquake forecast. However, numerical simulation of volcanic and seismic processes have been traditionally developed introducing several simplifications: homogeneous half-space, flat topography and elastic rheology. These simplified assumptions disregards effects caused by topography, presence of medium heterogeneity and anelastic rheology, while they could {{play an important role in}} Moreover, frictional sliding of a earthquake generates seismic waves that travel through the earth, causing major damage in places nearby to the modeling procedure This thesis presents mathematical modeling and numerical simulations of volcanic and seismic processes. The subject of major interest has been concerned on the developing of mathematical formulations to describe seismic and volcanic process. The interpretation of geophysical parameters requires numerical models and algorithms to define the optimal source parameters which justify observed variations. In this work we use the finite element method that allows the definition of real topography into the computational domain, medium heterogeneity inferred from seismic tomography study and the use of complex rheologies. Numerical forward method have been applied to obtain solutions of ground deformation expected during volcanic unrest and post-seismic phases, and an automated procedure for geodetic data inversion was proposed for evaluating slip distribution along surface rupture...|$|R
40|$|This project {{examines}} the composition, structure, and geophysical properties of rocks sampled within the San Andreas Fault Observatory at Depth (SAFOD) borehole drilling experiment near Parkfield, California. Cuttings, sidewall cores, spot-core, and whole-rock core are examined from the meso- to micro-scale {{to characterize the}} nearfault environment at shallow crustal levels (0 - 4 km) along the central segment of the San Andreas fault. The central segment deforms by contiuous aseismic creep and microseismicity. An integrated approach utilizing core-logging, detailed <b>structural</b> core mapping, <b>petrology,</b> microstructural analyses, whole-rock geochemistry, borehole geophysics, and analog field studies is followed. At SAFOD, fractured granitic rocks and arkosic sediments are identified west of the San Andreas fault zone on the Pacific Plate; whereas sheared fine-grained sediments, ultrafine black fault-related rocks, and serpentinite-bearing fault gouge are present within and northeast of the fault zone on the North American Plate. Here, the fault consists of a broad zone of variably damaged rock containing localized zones of highly concentrated shear that often juxtapose distinct rock-types. Two zones of serpentinite-bearing clay gouge, each meters-thick are found in two locations where active aseismic creep was identified in the borehole. The gouge is composed of Mg-rich clays, serpentinite (lizardite ± chrysotile) with notable increases in magnetite, and Fe-, Ni-, and Cr-oxides/hydroxides and Fe-sulfides relative to the surrounding host rock. Organic carbon is locally high within fractures and bounding slip surfaces. The rocks adjacent to and within the two gouge zones display a range of deformation including intensely fractured regions, blockin- matrix fabrics, and foliated cataclasite structure. The blocks and clasts predominately consist of competent sandstone and siltstone embedded in a clay-rich matrix that displays a penetrative scaly fabric. Mineral alteration, veins, fracture-surface coatings, and slickelined surfaces are present throughout the core, and reflect {{a long history of}} syndeformation and fluid-rock reaction that contributes to the low-strength and creep in the meters-thick gouge zones. Evaluation of borehole geophysical data and elastic modulii for the lithologic and structural units identified in the SAFOD Phase 3 core reveal a correlation between composition and textures and the structural and/or permeability architecture of the SAF at SAFOD. Highly reduced velocity and elastic modulii surround the two serpentinitev bearing gouge zones, the Buzzard Canyon fault to the southwest, and another bounding fault to the northeast. Velocity and elastic moduli values on the Pacific Plate or southeast of the active fault trace intersected by SAFOD are much higher relative to the values measured on the North American Plate, or northeast of the fault trace. Within and adjacent to the two active gouge zones, the rock properties are highly variable over short distances, however, they are significantly lower relative to material outside of the fault zones. This research contributes critical evidence for rock properties and slip behavior within an active plate boundary fault. Results from this research and the SAFOD experiment help to constrain numerous hypotheses related to fault zone behavior and earthquake generation within central California...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with understanding the engineering geologic factors influencing the stability of slopes along a coastal escarpment in the northern Illawarra region. The particular area covered by this study lies between Coalcliff and Clifton where a number of known or visible areas of slope instability are present. Slope instability {{in the study area}} {{is a function of the}} stratigraphy, <b>structural</b> geology, <b>petrology,</b> geomorphology, climate and mechanical properties of the rock and soil. In the northern Illawarra region the essentially flat-lying lower Narrabeen Group conformably overlies the upper Illawarra Coal Measures and the strata consist of repeated beds of sandstone, shale, claystone and coal seams. The lower Narrabeen Group consists of thick sequences of weak fine-grained rocks which are rather more easily eroded than the associated sandstone strata and hence relatively rapid rates of recession occur. Undermining along this the contacts between claystone and sandstone reduces the support for the overlying vertically-jointed sandstone and eventually leads to stabs falling off along the vertical joint faces. Thin marker beds (coal seams) in the Illawarra Coal Measures and sandstone beds in the Narrabeen Group commonly act as aquifers, with claystone beds acting as aquitards. Slope instability is usually related to the presence of the aquifers which are the source of high pore water pressures:- Perched water tables have been found to be quite common in the study area. The topography along the escarpment is mainly steep and highly irregular because of past and present marine and fluvial erosion:- Large colluvial deposits have accumulated at the base of the steeper slopes. Generally, colluvial deposits are clay-rich containing abundant mixed-layer clay and smectite (montmorillonite). Based on the petrological study, the Narrabeen group was derived from the New England Fold Belt to the north and consists predominantly of volcanic detritus. The volcanic detritus is present in both the sandstone and shale units either in form of detrital grains of volcanic rock or as fine volcanic ash- During post-depositional alteration and diagenesis the original volcanic glass in the ash and matrix of larger grains has devitrified to produce smectite clays. These clays not only cause swelling and shrinkage near the surface as a response to wetting and drying, but also reduce the permeability of the near the surface rock mass. This latter factor increases the aqueous pore pressures and hence increases the likelihood of surficial mass movement of both the rock mass and the adjacent talus deposits. Based on X-ray diffraction, carbonates are mostly rare in the talus deposits. The natural reduction in carbonate cement due to weathering is one a cause for talus slope instability in the Illawarra area. The high horizontal stress environment known to exist in the Illawarra area is an important factor which also influences slope failure. The resulting joint strike maxima for the lower Narrabeen Group show that the most prominent joint set exposed at the surface, with a direction between 005 ° and 025 °, has a significant effect on slope stability in the study area. Fracture permeability is also the most important feature of groundwater movements with it most of the fractures occurring in areas of stress relief near the face of the escarpment. It is quite obvious from studying the rainfall figures and periods of prevalence of landslides that the most unstable periods are those when the rainfall is above 400 mm per month. A significant decrease in durability was found to accompany changes in mineralogy and an increase in weathering from fresh to weathered rocks. Moderately and highly weathered claystone and shale in the Narrabeen Group rocks have low to very low durability; it is dependent on their mineralogy, and especially on the type and quantity of clay minerals present. Claystone samples interbedded in the Bulgo Sandstone also show very low durability. In contrast, claystone interbedded in the Scarborough Sandstone shows a medium durability whereas claystone in the Coal Cliff Sandstone has a high durability. The differences in the behaviour of samples is that slake durability is sensitive to the abundance of clay minerals as opposed to carbonate in these samples. Claystone interbeds in the Bulgo Sandstone and the highly weathered Stanwell Park Claystone both have very low durability. This has a significant effect on slope stability in the Bulgo Sandstone especially where the Stanwell Park Claystone acts as the bedrock for the talus mantle between Clifton and Stanwell Park. The Wombarra Shale and Stanwell Park Claystone, two units of the Narrabeen Group, appear to dominate the study area as being the units most prone to instability problems. Failure surfaces of landslides are located at or near the base of highly weathered shale or claystone sequences. A significant decrease in strength was also found to occur with an increase in weathering from fresh to weathered rocks. The geotechnical properties of the talus most related to its stability, are clay content, plasticity index and residual friction angle. These parameters and the angle of natural slopes show the talus is unstable in the longterm at slopes above 10 - 12 °. Man 2 ̆ 7 s construction activities have also caused some landslides in the northern Illawarra, especially along the excavations for the railway and road. Two main transport routes, the Illawarra Railway and Lawrence Hargrave Drive, pass through the study area. Along Lawrence Hargrave Drive major movement in gently sloping land has been triggered by high pore-water pressures in highly weathered Wombarra Shale covered by a talus mantle. Increased urban development has and will continue to complicate the issue in the future. Seven landslides have been detailed in this thesis. The majority of these have or are presently undergoing block type movements at creep rate. Detailed geotechnical investigations with survey monitoring is often necessary to identify these failures. The area has also been extensively mined for coal, resulting in minor subsidence. This has usually caused fracturing of the rock strata and opening of the joint system which have increased water ingress, resulting in higher subsurface flows and altered groundwater regimes. Based on observations, mine subsidence has been one contributory factor to slope instability in the northern Illawarr...|$|R
