5000|$|Reverse Figure-Eight: In another {{frequent}} challenge, {{the drivers}} are each {{placed at the}} wheel of a second-generation Dodge Ram Campervan covered with a huge number of <b>signalling</b> <b>lights,</b> and tasked with reversing around a course shaped like a figure-eight, with the other drivers as their passengers. Mariah quickly sets off without bothering to adjust her mirrors (and doesn't even use them anyway), and ends up hitting 13 objects, with her run doubly deemed a failure because she again didn't make a serious effort. Chanie ends up hitting 32 objects due to her inability to understand front-end swing. Tyler puts the other drivers at ease with a mock preflight announcement, but like Chanie he doesn't understand how to counteract the front-end swing, leading to a similarly poor run in which he hits 25 objects. George hits an object early on (earning himself another punch from Patrik, and one from Andrew for good measure), but quickly gets it together and doesn't hit another thing during his run, which he finishes even faster than Andrew did in his demonstration. Santana fails to adjust or use her mirrors early on, but picks up the technique and doesn't hit anything after the first corner. Before Jason's run, it's revealed that he was sent for an eye examination the previous day, which found that his bad eyesight is caused by a combination of early-stage glaucoma and some nerve damage caused by excess pressure on his eyeballs. In fact, his eyesight is so bad that the attending optometrist says he is obligated to contact the Ministry of Transportation with this information, which may lead to Jason's driving licence being put up for review. In the meantime, Jason takes the challenge, but even with his new glasses he hits 17 things; a poor performance, but one he admits would have been far worse without the glasses. Siham has the final run, and her extreme anxiety causes her to give up after the first corner. Andrew therefore takes her for a private lesson elsewhere in the rehab centre, teaching her proper mirror usage.|$|E
40|$|Roads in the {{conventional}} residential areas serve the purpose of leading {{to and from the}} houses in them. Thus, they are essentially traffic routes which may carry all road traffic modes, viz: pedestrians, pedal and motor bicycles, motor cars and trucks, and public service vehicles (buses or trams). Furthermore, it should be realised that in many cases the residential area either contains or at least borders on areas with social functions, areas that often create or attract much traffic (hospitals, shopping centres, sport facilities, offices and even factories). Thus, roads in residential areas always have a traffic function, and often an important one. The requirements for this traffic function must be met both at day and at night. As a consequence, residential areas have nearly always a "public" lighting installation which may have further functions for public safety. Additionally, all vehicles carry lights that illuminate their way apart from <b>signalling</b> <b>lights.</b> This paper deals with aspects of public and vehicle lighting and their interactions. The paper was presented to the Chartered Institution of Building Services CIBS annual conference 1979, Harrogate, 19 - 23 May 1979...|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} {{theoretical}} model of light controlling {{light in a}} multi-atom cavity QED system consisting of three-level atoms confined in a cavity and interacting with a control laser from free space. A signal laser is coupled into the cavity and provides two output light channels: the transmitted <b>signal</b> <b>light</b> through the cavity and the reflected <b>signal</b> <b>light</b> from the cavity. We show that with the cavity electromagnetically induced transparency manifested by the free-space control light, the amplitude and the phase of the intra-cavity <b>signal</b> <b>light</b> can be manipulated by the free-space control laser. We analyze the cavity transmitted <b>signal</b> <b>light</b> and the cavity reflected <b>signal</b> <b>light,</b> and show that the two output channels of the <b>signal</b> <b>light</b> are complementary and the cavity-atom system is a versatile system for studies of alloptical switching and cross-phase modulation at low control intensities...|$|R

30|$|The global {{architecture}} of the system shows three main modules. The first one is the « Train sensing system » which serves to detect train arrivals and departures respectively toward/from the LX. This module is responsible for triggering the local protection system composed of automatic half barriers and <b>signalling</b> <b>lights.</b> The second module is also linked to a monitoring system (third module) composed of cameras, a processing unit responsible {{for the analysis of}} image sequences sent by the cameras—and possibly for storing them in a dedicated database—. The unit also recognises potentially dangerous situations and alerts the Local Control Centre (LCC) of the LX zone. The LCC is able to communicate with the approaching train in order for example to issue a braking order. The LCC is also linked to a Main remote Control Centre (MCC) which manages the traffic on a larger scale. Following a disruption occurring on at a LX, a MCC may decide to divert some trains to other routes. Note that train detection devices have to be situated far enough away from the LX crossing zone, so that when obstacles are detected within this zone, there still is enough time for the monitoring module to take anticipatory measures.|$|E

40|$|Traffic {{congestion}} {{is one of}} {{the worst}} problems in many countries. Traffic congestion wastes a huge portion of the national income for fuel and traffic-related environmental and socioeconomic problems. Computer simulation is a powerful tool for analyzing complex and dynamic scenarios. It provides an appealing approach to analyze repetitive processes. Simulation helps decision makers identify different possible options by analyzing enormous amounts of data. Hence, computer simulation can be used effectively to analyze traffic flow patterns and <b>signal</b> <b>light</b> timing. This paper discusses a special-purpose simulation (SPS) tool for optimize traffic <b>signal</b> <b>light</b> timing. The simulation model is capable of optimizing <b>signal</b> <b>light</b> timing at a single junction as well as an actual road network with multiple junctions. It also provides <b>signal</b> <b>light</b> timing for certain time periods according to traffic demand.

40|$|A {{method for}} {{recognizing}} <b>signal</b> <b>lights</b> in traeic scenes {{in real time}} has been developed.

This multifilter approach is model-based, and it comprises much of the available knowledge about <b>signaling</b> <b>lights.</b> In addition to color, this includes characteristics like the locations of the lights relative to the vehicle, their size, symmetry, and blinking frequencies. The individual filters, and the way how they cooperate, have been designed {{in such a way that}} the system recognizes active <b>signaling</b> <b>lights</b> reliably, while false alarms are largely avoided.

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, we {{demonstrate}} a novel receiver {{in visible light}} communication system based on RGB LEDs. It contains three major parts the collimating lens, the spectro-device and the photodetector. The mixed RGB <b>signal</b> <b>lights</b> are captured, separated and received by the collimating lens the spectro-device and the photodetector respectively. Through the adjustment of the collimating lens, the receiver can receive enough light even if {{the distance between the}} <b>signal</b> <b>light</b> source and the receiver is changed. The receiver has the advantages of strong mobility and strong ability of receiving <b>signal</b> <b>light.</b> Based on the designed receiver the high-speed visible light communication system using RGB wavelength division multiplexing technology can have better performance...|$|R

5|$|The primary {{types of}} visual {{signalling}} were Semaphore flags, lamps and flags, lamps and lights, and the heliograph. In open warfare, visual signalling (employing signal flags and the heliograph) was the norm. A competent signaller could transmit 12 {{words a minute}} with signal flags (during daylight) and <b>signal</b> <b>lights</b> (at night). <b>Signal</b> <b>lights,</b> which were secured in a wooden case, employed a battery-operated Morse code key. These signalling techniques had certain disadvantages, however. In trench warfare, operators using these methods were forced to expose themselves to enemy fire; while messages sent to the rear by <b>signal</b> <b>lights</b> could not be seen by enemy forces, replies to such messages were readily spotted, and operators were, once again, exposed to enemy fire.|$|R

In experiments at the University of Karlsruhe we studied the dependency between reaction time and overlap of <b>signal</b> <b>lights.</b> We can see, that the total overlap from a yellow turn signal and a red brake signal will increase the reaction time. The increase depends of the ratio between the luminance of the turn indicator signal and the luminance of the brake signal.
