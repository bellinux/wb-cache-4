50|$|Slacker is {{a uniquely}} {{structured}} and seemingly plotless film, following {{a single day}} in the life of an ensemble of mostly under-30 bohemians and misfits in Austin, Texas. The film follows various characters and scenes, never staying with one character or conversation for more than a few minutes before picking up someone else in the scene and following them. The characters include Linklater as a talkative taxi passenger, a UFO buff who insists the U.S. has been on the moon since the 1950s, a JFK conspiracy theorist, an elderly anarchist who befriends a man trying to rob his house, a serial television set collector, and a hipster woman trying to sell a Madonna pap smear. The woman selling the pap <b>smear</b> <b>appears</b> on the film poster, and was played by Butthole Surfers drummer Teresa Taylor. Most of the characters grapple with feelings of social exclusion or political marginalization, which are recurring themes in their conversations. They discuss social class, terrorism, joblessness, and government control of the media.|$|E
40|$|Background: HIV-infected {{women have}} been shown to have an {{increased}} incidence of cervical dysplasia/cancer. This increased risk is associated with concurrent HPV infection. With marriage being an important risk factor for HIV infection in Cambodian women, STDs may not be as prevalent as in other HIV positive populations. To date no data on HPV prevalence or abnormal Pap smear rates in Cambodia has been published. This study sought to evaluate the prevalence of abnormal pap smears in correlation with immunosuppression. Methods: During 2005, 268 HIV-infected women in a Women´s HIV clinic in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, were screened for cervical dysplasia/cancer by Pap smear and had their CD 4 count measured. Pap smears were then read via telepathology at the University of Basel, Switzerland, Pathology Department based on the Bethesda classification. CD 4 counts were done locally. For statistical analysis Fisher’s exact test was used to compare the two groups. Results: Demographics of the women: mean age = 32 yrs (18 - 53), mean CD 4 count = 284 /mm 3 (2 - 1221), 112 / 268 (42 %) had CD 4 counts below 200 /mm 3, 117 / 268 (44 %) received HAART, including 67 / 112 (60 %) of patients with CD 4 200 / mm 3. 7 patients had incomplete data. Out of the 261 women, 8 (3 %) women had HGSIL, 7 with CD 4 below 200 / mm 3, 1 with CD 4 over 200 / mm 3 (p-value 0. 008), 13 (5. 0 %) women had LGSIL, 8 with CD 4 below 200 / mm 3 and 5 with CD 4 over 200 / mm 3 (p-value 0. 014). Conclusions: HGSIL on Pap <b>smear</b> <b>appears</b> to be strongly correlated with immune-suppression in this cohort. The results show the importance of screening for cervical cancer all HIV positive women, even when in resource-poor settings. Further studies are needed to correlate the findings with HPV prevalence and to confirm these diagnoses by colposcopy or biopsy. status: publishe...|$|E

Peripheral blood <b>smears</b> <b>appear</b> less sensitive than Plasmodium falciparum histidine-rich protein 2 -based rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for placental malaria infections in studies conducted at delivery. In this study, 81 women in Uganda in {{the second or third}} trimester of pregnancy were followed-up until delivery. At each visit, peripheral blood was tested by blood smear, RDT, and nested species-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Sensitivity and specificity of the tests was calculated with PCR, which detected 22 infections of P. falciparum, as the gold standard. The sensitivity and specificity of blood smears were 36. 4 % (95 % confidence interval [CI] = 18. 0 - 59. 2 %) and 99. 6 % (95 % CI = 97. 7 - 100 %), respectively. The corresponding values for RDT were 31. 8 % (95 % CI = 14. 7 - 54. 9 %) and 100 % (95 % CI = 98. 3 - 100 %). The RDTs could replace blood smears for diagnosis of malaria in pregnancy by virtue of their relative ease of use. Field-based sensitive tests for malaria in pregnancy are urgently needed...|$|R

40|$|We {{propose a}} {{classification}} of defects in large-area Cu(In,Ga) Se 2 (CIGS) modules using electroluminescence (EL) and lock-in thermography (LIT) imaging techniques. We observe {{three types of}} defects, which we name according to their respective appearance in EL images as “Smears”, “Freckles”, and “Doughnuts”. “Smears” consist of a small dark spot and a tail (length: 2 to 12 mm), which smears out over several cells. In both EL and LIT images, <b>Smears</b> <b>appear</b> as shunts with {{negative impact on the}} cell performance. “Freckles” appear in EL images as dark spots with sharp contours (diameter: 10 to 200 μm). Doughnuts are visible in EL images as dark spots (diameter: 10 to 50 μm), surrounded by bright edge (diameter: 20 to 150 μm). Freckles and Doughnuts may originate from impurities in the CIGS absorber layer, and ZnO layer, respectively. Their appearances in EL and LIT images show that these two defect types have minor electrical impact and may result from difference in emissivity of materials. However, both of them cause a reduction of active area, and thus the short circuit current.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to assess the {{relation}} between the direct smear observations and bacteriological results carried out on equine tracheal secretions. A total of 304 cases comprising both the direct smear (Gram stain) and the bacteriological culture, over a period of 8 years, were submitted to this retrospective study. Most of the specimens (78 %) were obtained using tracheal washings while the rest (22 %) originated from tracheal brushings. A total of 96 specimens (32 %) were negative for both direct smear and culture. The positive predictive value of direct <b>smears</b> <b>appeared</b> high (81 - 96 %) while the negative predictive value was lower (48 - 79 %). Sensitivity of direct smear was considered as low and varied from 24 to 46 % for tracheal brushings and from 41 to 46 % for tracheal washings. Specificity of direct smear was high for both types of specimens. Results of this study indicate that the use of Gram-stained smear examination, carried out on tracheal secretions, is a technique which is specific but not very sensitive for the prediction of bacteriological culture results. Moreover, the use of tracheal washing, more than tracheal brushing, seems to increase the sensitivity of the test...|$|R
40|$|We {{assessed}} {{the association between}} different HPV genotypes, HIV infection, and cervical squamous intra-epithelial lesions (SIL) in 236 women with known HIV serostatus enrolled in a longitudinal multicentric study in Italy. Of these women, 135 were HIV-infected, and were not markedly different from HIV-negative women with regard to demographic characteristics, sexual practices, smoking, or intravenous drug use. We obtained 232 cervical smears suitable for cytological examination and HPV-genotype analysis (134 from HIV-positive women and 98 from HIV-negative women), For 86 HIV-positive and 89 HIV-negative women, the <b>smears</b> <b>appeared</b> normal at cytomorphological analysis. Cytological dysplasia of varying degrees was detected in 48 smears from HIV-positive women and in 9 from HIV-negative women. HPV prevalence, assessed using polymerase-chain-reaction analysis, did not significantly differ between HIV-positive and HIV-negative women. The prevalence of HPV-associated SIL was much greater among HIV-infected women. The most frequently detected genotypes in both groups were HPV 16 and HPV 18. The prevalence of HPV 16 among HIV-positive women {{was similar to that}} for HIV-negative women; this was also true for HPV 18. However, in the HIV-positive group, most of these genotypes were associated with SIL. HIV-positive women showed a wider spectrum of genotypes, including non-oncogenic and rare types.

40|$|The {{signal peptide}} (sp) in Streptomyces lividans {{xylanase}} A 2 (XlnA 2) {{was replaced by}} sps containing, in frame in their sequences, one, two, three or four initiation codons, each preceded by a Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence. Precursors of the corresponding proteins should thus have sps of, respectively, 27, 46, 82 and 91 amino acids (aa) long. By radiolabelling of S. lividans harboring the different constructs inserted in a multicopy plasmid and by immunoprecipitation with anti-xylanase antibodies followed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) separation, precursors of the expected sizes were obtained in each clone. This indicates that ribosomes can synthesize different XlnA 2 precursors from initiation codons inserted in the sp sequence, independently of their number. The amount of these synthesized precursors was also shown to be inversely proportional to their length when comparing the specific activity of labelling versus sp length. In clones producing more than one precursor, a <b>smear</b> <b>appeared</b> on the autoradiograms, suggesting some degree of precursor degradation.

T cell function was studied by direct phytohemagglutinin (PHA) microtest (from the same sample of whole blood), mixed lymphocyte culture (MLC), and by delayed hypersensitivity to various antigens. In the 13 patients with Hodgkin's disease the histologic subtype was nodular sclerosis in nine, lymphocyte predominant in two, mixed cellularity in two. Only one of these patients had disseminated disease (stage IV); he showed impaired cellular immunity, a very low percentage of B cells and low levels of serum immunoglobulins. Of the remaining patients with Hodgkin's disease, with one exception, normal percentages but rather low absolute numbers of B lymphocytes per mm 3 of blood were found. One patient with a low percent and low absolute number of B lymphocytes showed very high serum IgG. Of 24 patients with non-Hodgkin's malignant lymphoma, seven (29 %) showed monoclonal B cell proliferation in the peripheral blood (five μκ, two γκ). By morphologic criteria, 14 patients had involvement of bone marrow, five of these had involvement of peripheral blood.

40|$|The aims of {{this study}} were to {{investigate}} aspects of the aural microenvironment in dogs. The aural microflora, histological features of the aural integument, and biochemical components of cerumen from healthy canine ears and those with otitis externa were studied. Interactions between canine cerumen and one member of the resident aural flora, Malassezia pachydermatis were also investigated. Gram-positive, coagulase-negative cocci, and M. pachydermatis were the most common resident flora found in 52 healthy canine external ears. Microscopic examination of cytological smears from cerumen and microbiological culture indicated that these organisms were present in low numbers. Gram-positive coagulase positive staphylococci, Gram-negative rods, and M. pachydermatis were isolated most frequently from 27 canine ears affected by otitis externa. Eighty percent of these inflamed ears were associated with microbial overgrowth. The numbers of microorganisms found in cerumen cytological <b>smears</b> <b>appear</b> to be correlated to the growth density of microbial colonies on culture plates.

Our lattice theory uses a reduced staggered fermion formalism to generate two Dirac flavors in the continuum limit. In the current study {{we have tried to}} reduce lattice spacing and taste breaking effects by using an improved fermion action incorporating stout smeared links. As in our earlier study we observe two regimes; for weak gauge coupling the chiral condensate behaves as an order parameter differentiating a phase at small four fermi coupling where the condensate vanishes from a phase at strong four fermi coupling in which chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken. This picture changes qualitatively when the gauge coupling is strong enough to cause confinement; in this case we observe a first order phase transition for some critical value of the four fermi coupling associated with a strong enhancement of the chiral condensate. We observe that this critical four fermi coupling varies monotonically with bare gauge coupling - decreasing, as expected, as the gauge coupling is increased. We have checked that these results remain stable under differing levels of <b>smearing.</b> They <b>appear</b> to rule out the appearance of new fixed points associated with chirally invariant four fermion interactions in confining non abelian gauge theories.
