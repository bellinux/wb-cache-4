40|$|A {{study of}} the effects of <b>secondary</b> <b>air</b> {{addition}} on the stability and emissions of a gas turbine combustor has been performed. Tests were conducted with two types of flameholders and varying amounts of dilution air addition. Results indicate that NO(x) decreases with increasing dilution <b>air</b> <b>injection,</b> whereas CO is independent of the amount of dilution air and is related to the gas temperature near the walls. The axial location of the dilution air addition has no effect on the performance or stability. Results also indicate that the amount of <b>secondary</b> <b>air</b> entrained by the flameholder recirculation zone is dependent on the amount of dilution air and flameholder geometry...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{work has}} been done with the goal of {{establishing}} ultralow emission aircraft gas turbine combustors. A significant portion of the effort is the development of three dimensional computational combustor models. The KIVA-II computer code which is based on the Implicit Continuous Eulerian Difference mesh Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian (ICED-ALE) numerical scheme is one of the codes selected by NASA to achieve these goals. This report involves a simulation of jet injection through slanted slots within the Rich burn/Quick quench/Lean burn (RQL) baseline experimental rig. The RQL combustor distinguishes three regions of combustion. This work specifically focuses on modeling the quick quench mixer region in which <b>secondary</b> <b>injection</b> <b>air</b> is introduced radially through 12 equally spaced slots around the mixer circumference. Steady state solutions are achieved with modifications to the KIVA-II program. Work currently underway will evaluate thermal mixing as a function of <b>injection</b> <b>air</b> velocity and angle of inclination of the slots...|$|R
40|$|In axial fan, {{the static}} {{pressure}} {{difference between the}} suction and the pressure side of the impeller produces a leakage flow through the blade and the casing. This secondary flow occurs {{in the opposite direction}} of the working flow and has a negative impact on the overall performances. It tends to reduce the pressure coefficient, the efficiency and the fan operating range while increasing the noise level. That is why many studies dealt with ways to reduce this leakage flow. In this paper, the study focusses on the control of the <b>secondary</b> flow by <b>air</b> <b>injection.</b> Two ways to control this flow are compared. In a first case, the air is ejected from the fixed casing and in a second case the air exit from the rotating shrouds. In both configurations, the ejected air has a direction to counter the leakage flow. To realize the second configuration, a new method to build fan with hollow blades was developed. This new kind of fan allows having internal flows which could exit by any area of the fan. The results obtained by the active controls on the fan characteristic and the efficiency are presented in this article...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Secondary</b> <b>air</b> <b>injection</b> (commonly {{known as}} air injection) is a vehicle {{emissions}} control strategy introduced in 1966, wherein fresh air is {{injected into the}} exhaust stream {{to allow for a}} fuller combustion of exhaust gases.|$|E
50|$|As {{emission}} control strategies grew {{more sophisticated and}} effective, the amount of unburned and partially burned fuel in the exhaust stream shrank, and particularly when the catalytic converter was introduced, the function of <b>secondary</b> <b>air</b> <b>injection</b> shifted. Rather than being a primary {{emission control}} device, the <b>secondary</b> <b>air</b> <b>injection</b> system was adapted to support the efficient function of the catalytic converter. The original air injection point {{became known as the}} upstream injection point. When the engine is cold, air injected at this point cleans up the extra-rich exhaust and raises the temperature of the exhaust so as to bring the catalytic converter to operating temperature quickly. Once the engine is warm, air is injected to the downstream location — the catalytic converter itself — to assist with catalysis of unburned hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide.|$|E
50|$|Vane {{pumps are}} {{commonly}} used as high-pressure hydraulic pumps and in automobiles, including supercharging, power-steering and automatic-transmission pumps. Pumps for mid-range pressures include applications such as carbonators for fountain soft-drink dispensers and espresso coffee machines. Furthermore, vane pumps {{can be used in}} low-pressure gas applications such as <b>secondary</b> <b>air</b> <b>injection</b> for auto exhaust emission control, or in low-pressure chemical vapor deposition systems.|$|E
30|$|When using a frame without <b>air</b> <b>injection,</b> no board {{could be}} {{manufactured}} {{by using a}} radio-frequency hot press owing to blowout. However, <b>air</b> <b>injection</b> prevented blowout. The effect of <b>air</b> <b>injection</b> on preventing blowout was thus demonstrated.|$|R
30|$|The <b>air</b> <b>injection</b> {{decreased}} the {{modulus of rupture}} but increased the internal bond strength. The increase in internal bond strength was {{much larger than the}} drop in modulus of rupture, showing the effectiveness of the <b>air</b> <b>injection.</b> The <b>air</b> <b>injection</b> also reduced the necessary pressing time. The <b>air</b> <b>injection</b> was shown to be effective because the advantages outweighed the disadvantage.|$|R
30|$|Particleboards with {{thickness}} of 10  mm and densities of 0.6, 0.7 and 0.8  g/cm 3 were manufactured from high-moisture particles using urea–formaldehyde resin {{and the effectiveness}} of <b>air</b> <b>injection</b> was examined. The temperature in the 0.6 and 0.7  g/cm 3 boards was lower with <b>air</b> <b>injection</b> than without during the initial to middle stages of pressing, while the temperature in the 0.8  g/cm 3 board remained lower with <b>air</b> <b>injection</b> than without throughout the entire pressing process. <b>Air</b> <b>injection</b> reduced the pressing time required to manufacture the 0.6 and 0.7  g/cm 3 boards and also increased the internal bond strength of boards of all densities. In the 0.6 and 0.7  g/cm 3 boards, <b>air</b> <b>injection</b> reduced the modulus of rupture (MOR), while in the 0.8  g/cm 3 boards, the MOR was similar between those manufactured by injecting and not injecting <b>air.</b> <b>Air</b> <b>injection</b> was also found to be effective for boards of high densities. The effectiveness of the <b>air</b> <b>injection</b> on thick boards was investigated by manufacturing 20 -mm-thick boards of 0.7  g/cm 3. Without <b>air</b> <b>injection,</b> {{it was not possible to}} manufacture the 20 -mm-thick boards, even by extended hot pressing, but <b>air</b> <b>injection</b> allowed the boards to be manufactured by pressing for 16  min. <b>Air</b> <b>injection</b> was also shown to be effective for manufacturing thick boards.|$|R
50|$|When {{catalytic}} converters were first introduced, most vehicles used carburetors {{that provided a}} relatively rich air-fuel ratio. Oxygen (O2) levels in the exhaust stream were therefore generally insufficient for the catalytic reaction to occur efficiently. Most designs of the time therefore included <b>secondary</b> <b>air</b> <b>injection,</b> which injected air into the exhaust stream. This increased the available oxygen, allowing the catalyst to function as intended.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} experiments {{investigating the}} effects of <b>air</b> <b>injection</b> on the cloud cavitation of an oscillating hydrofoil. The effects of continuous <b>air</b> <b>injection</b> were investigated using two different hydrofoils. Measurements of the acoustic pressure were made on the downstream test section floor and {{on the surface of}} one of hydrofoils, and the extent of noise reduction provided by <b>air</b> <b>injection</b> at various volume flow rates was determined. The acoustic surface pressure measurements were also correlated with visual observations made using high speed motion pictures of the cloud cavitation. Thus {{the effects of}} continuous <b>air</b> <b>injection</b> on specific cavitation structures could be identified. In addition, the effectiveness of pulsed <b>air</b> <b>injection</b> in achieving greater reductions in cavitation noise at volume flow rates equal to those used in continuous <b>air</b> <b>injection</b> experiments was investigated...|$|R
40|$|<b>Air</b> <b>injection</b> {{in light}} oil {{reservoirs}} has received considerable attention as an effective, {{improved oil recovery}} process, based primarily {{on the success of}} several projects within the Williston Basin in the United States. The main mechanism of <b>air</b> <b>injection</b> is the oxidation behavior between oxygen and crude oil in the reservoir. <b>Air</b> <b>injection</b> is a good option because of its wide availability and low cost. Whether <b>air</b> <b>injection</b> can be applied to shale is an interesting topic from both economic and technical perspectives. This paper initiates a comprehensive discussion on the feasibility and potential of <b>air</b> <b>injection</b> in shale oil reservoirs based on state-of-the-art literature review. Favorable and unfavorable effects of using <b>air</b> <b>injection</b> are discussed in an analogy analysis on geology, reservoir features, temperature, pressure, and petrophysical, mineral and crude oil properties of shale oil reservoirs. The available data comparison of the historically successful <b>air</b> <b>injection</b> projects with typical shale oil reservoirs in the U. S. is summarized in this paper. Some operation methods to improve <b>air</b> <b>injection</b> performance are recommended. This paper provides an avenue for us to make use of many of the favorable conditions of shale oil reservoirs for implementing <b>air</b> <b>injection,</b> or <b>air</b> huff ‘n’ puff injection, and the low cost of air has the potential to improve oil recovery in shale oil reservoirs.

50|$|The {{engine was}} {{reworked}} substantially in 2000 {{in order to}} meet increasing emission requirements; with the 2.5 and 3.0 being replaced by lower compression 2.6 and 3.2 units. While displacement was changed the bore centers and deck height were retained. These later power plants had a revised engine management system setup, which utilised quad lambda sensor control, coil per plug ignition system and drive by wire throttles. The 3.2 also received a stronger steel crankshaft. As a result of these changes the EGR and <b>secondary</b> <b>air</b> <b>injection</b> system were removed.|$|E
5000|$|The Fury used {{an updated}} version of the VTX1300 {{powertrain}} and brakes, replacing the 38 mm CV carburetor of the VTX1300 engine with fuel injection (PGM-FI) using a single 38 mm throttle body. The Fury's undersquare engine also received modified cams and cylinder heads as well as a redesigned exhaust system. The fuel injection system was part of the engine's exhaust emission controls, in addition to a <b>secondary</b> <b>air</b> <b>injection</b> system and two catalytic converters; Honda also produced a state-specific version of the Fury to meet the California Air Resources Board emissions standards.|$|E
5000|$|The 1975 {{models were}} mostly {{unchanged}} {{from the previous}} two years, with some exceptions: a new grille with a return of the Plymouth 3-pointed-'spear' affixed to the grille's center; catalytic converters were added to 225 Slant Six and 318 V8 models (the 360 was not equipped with a converter and its power was now , due to {{the addition of a}} <b>secondary</b> <b>air</b> <b>injection</b> system, commonly referred to as a [...] "smog pump".

5000|$|The {{groundwater}} pumpout {{system was}} constructed in 1985 and pumped contaminated groundwater from three wells to a storm sewer.

40|$|Numerical {{simulation}} on {{the flow}} patterns/the velocity profiles was conducted and predicted. The test conditions and input boundary conditions are summarized. The flow {{patterns of the}} side view/top view are predicted along with stream lines. When the flow reached to the <b>secondary</b> <b>air</b> input of the lower <b>air</b> <b>injection</b> nozzles, the flow pattern was changed from a laminar flow to a turbulent flow. The velocity profiles at various locations of the combustor chamber was predicted. The velocity {{at the center of}} the combustor is greater than that of the wall region. The velocity of the top section is also greater than that of the lower section. The swirling velocity is reduced in both directions of the wall and the center of the combustor chamber. The velocity increased from the wall region to the center region at the top section of the <b>secondary</b> <b>air</b> injectors. Numerical modeling/simulation will be continued to determine the species profiles, temperature profiles, mass fraction profiles, and heat flux and heat transfer coefficient profiles.

Although it displaces 134 cu. in, the 2.2 L OHV is still commonly referred to as the GM 122 today, and has been reputed for its simplicity, reliability and ease of maintenance in the J-body cars and S-Series trucks, and a few L-Body cars.

In addition to dropping the 'E' designation for the GS500, all Suzuki motorcycles went from using a single letter code for the model year (e.g., 'X' for 1999) to a letter-and-number code: K1 for 2001, K2 for 2002, L0 for 2010 and so on.

30|$|The {{temperature}} of the 0.6 -g/cm 3 boards was lower with <b>air</b> <b>injection</b> than without until 3  min. In the 0.7 -g/cm 3 boards, the temperature was lower with <b>air</b> <b>injection</b> than without until 6  min. In the 0.8 -g/cm 3 boards, the temperature was always lower with <b>air</b> <b>injection</b> than without. Although the temperature was lower with <b>air</b> <b>injection</b> than without, IB was higher in the boards manufactured by injecting air than by not injecting air (Fig.  2). The urea–formaldehyde resin did not act sufficiently as a binder under high moisture conditions, even at high temperatures, possibly because high moisture inhibits curing, and causes excessive penetration of resin into the wood particles [15]. <b>Air</b> <b>injection</b> {{was found to be}} effective for accelerating the curing of urea–formaldehyde resin by discharging vapor.|$|R
30|$|Previous paper {{reported}} {{the effects of}} <b>air</b> <b>injection</b> {{on the performance of}} boards manufactured from high-moisture (25  %) particles (high-moisture board), which were used to skip the drying process and reduce energy consumption [1 – 3]. <b>Air</b> <b>injection</b> was successfully used to manufacture high-moisture boards without blowout. On the other hand, it was shown that the <b>air</b> <b>injection</b> also caused the discharge of binder from the boards [2].|$|R
30|$|The {{performance}} of the board manufactured from low-moisture particles was superior to that of high-moisture particles [1, 5]. Conditions for blowout of the boards {{as well as the}} {{performance of}} the boards manufactured varied according to whether high- or low-moisture particles were used. Another of our previous paper investigated the effects of <b>air</b> <b>injection</b> on boards manufactured from low-moisture (15  %) particles (low-moisture board) [6]. It was necessary to confirm the effects of <b>air</b> <b>injection</b> on preventing blowout of the low-moisture boards since blowout still occurs in factory production as described above. <b>Air</b> <b>injection</b> was also shown to be effective in preventing blowout of low-moisture boards. The <b>air</b> <b>injection</b> inevitably discharges binder from low-moisture boards as well as for high-moisture boards [6]. Although the <b>air</b> <b>injection</b> was expected to impair the board performance due to discharge of the binder, the board performance was unimpaired [6], suggesting that <b>air</b> <b>injection</b> can also prevent accidental blowout in factory production without impairing the {{performance of the}} boards and thus improve productivity.|$|R
50|$|The first systems {{injected}} air {{very close}} to the engine, either in the cylinder head's exhaust ports or in the exhaust manifold. These systems provided oxygen to oxidize (burn) unburned and partially burned fuel in the exhaust before its ejection from the tailpipe. There was significant unburned and partially burned fuel in the exhaust of 1960s and early 1970s vehicles, and so <b>secondary</b> <b>air</b> <b>injection</b> significantly reduced tailpipe emissions. However, the extra heat of recombustion, particularly with an excessively rich exhaust caused by misfiring or a maladjusted carburetor, tended to damage exhaust valves and could even be seen to cause the exhaust manifold to incandesce.|$|E
5000|$|The LG8 ("J-code") was {{an updated}} version of the 3.1 L engine that {{displaced}} [...] It was utilized starting model year 2000. It still had an iron block and 2-valve pushrod aluminum heads and full sequential port fuel injection. The LG8 also featured a new intake manifold and numerous changes to improve parts sharing with the larger displacement LA1 3400. Emissions were improved with <b>secondary</b> <b>air</b> <b>injection</b> and it earned LEV status. The engine featured a 89.00 mm bore and a 84.00 mm stroke and a 9.6:1 compression ratio. It produced [...] and 190 - 195 lbft Nm. The LG8 was built in Ramos Arizpe, Coahuila, Mexico and Tonawanda, New York.|$|E
50|$|One of the first-developed exhaust {{emission}} control systems is <b>secondary</b> <b>air</b> <b>injection.</b> Originally, this system was used to inject air into the engine's exhaust ports to provide oxygen so unburned and partially burned hydrocarbons in the exhaust would finish burning. Air injection is now used to support the catalytic converter's oxidation reaction, and to reduce emissions when an engine is started from cold. After a cold start, an engine needs an air-fuel mixture richer than what it needs at operating temperature, and the catalytic converter does not function efficiently until it has reached its own operating temperature. The air injected upstream of the converter supports combustion in the exhaust headpipe, which speeds catalyst warmup and reduces the amount of unburned hydrocarbon emitted from the tailpipe.|$|E
30|$|<b>Air</b> <b>injection</b> {{reduced the}} {{pressing}} {{time of the}} 0.6 and 0.7 -g/cm 3 boards and increased the IB. <b>Air</b> <b>injection</b> did not reduce the pressing time of the 0.8 -g/cm 3 board, but did increase the IB.|$|R
30|$|The {{modulus of rupture}} was 18.4  MPa in {{the board}} {{manufactured}} by not injecting air and was 15.0  MPa in the board manufactured by injecting air (Fig.  4, pressing time 8  min, pressing at 210 °C). The <b>air</b> <b>injection</b> reduced the modulus of rupture by 21 %. On the other hand, the internal bond strengths of the boards were 0.27 and 0.60  MPa, respectively. The <b>air</b> <b>injection</b> increased the internal bond strengths by 2.2 times. The <b>air</b> <b>injection</b> reduced the modulus of rupture and increased the internal bond strength. The effect of increasing the internal bond strength was larger than the reduction of modulus of rupture. The <b>air</b> <b>injection</b> also reduced the pressing time. Thus, the advantages of <b>air</b> <b>injection,</b> which include a remarkable increase of internal bond strength, and shortened pressing time, outweigh the disadvantage of {{a drop in the}} modulus of rupture.|$|R
