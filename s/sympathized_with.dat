Personally, Magoffin adhered to a states' rights position, {{including}} the right of a state to secede from the Union, and he <b>sympathized</b> <b>with</b> the Confederate cause. Nevertheless, when the Kentucky General Assembly adopted a position of neutrality in the war, Magoffin ardently held to it, refusing calls for aid from both the Union and Confederate governments.|$|E
5|$|Grant and Hayes {{had both}} {{advocated}} civil service reform, and by 1881, civil service reform associations had organized with renewed energy across the nation. Garfield <b>sympathized</b> <b>with</b> them, {{believing that the}} spoils system damaged the presidency and distracted from more important concerns. Some reformers were disappointed that Garfield had advocated limited tenure only to minor office seekers and had given appointments to his old friends, but many remained loyal and supported Garfield.|$|E
5|$|Near {{the end of}} his life, Justinian became {{ever more}} {{inclined}} towards the Monophysite doctrine, especially in the form of Aphthartodocetism, but he died before being able to issue any legislation. The empress Theodora <b>sympathized</b> <b>with</b> the Monophysites and {{is said to have been}} a constant source of pro-Monophysite intrigues at the court in Constantinople in the earlier years. In the course of his reign, Justinian, who had a genuine interest in matters of theology, authored a small number of theological treatises.|$|E

5|$|Noted for {{publishing}} the biting satirical pieces and art chronicles of Tudor Arghezi, Seara was {{closely associated with}} the Romanian Symbolist movement. Through Arghezi, Bogdan-Pitești and other contributors, it campaigned in favor Symbolism and, after 1913, popularized modern art. Although paying tribute to political conservatism throughout its existence, Seara was also home to anti-establishment contributors, allies in the anti-Entente cause. The newspaper <b>sympathized</b> <b>with</b> the Social Democratic Party, regularly hosting opinion pieces by socialists and anarchists.|$|E
5|$|By the 19th century, Victorian {{scholars}} such as William Stubbs, James Ramsay, and William Hunt {{sought to}} understand how the English political system had evolved under Henry. They explored the emergence of Parliamentary institutions during his reign, and <b>sympathized</b> <b>with</b> the concerns of the chroniclers over the role of the Poitevins in England. This focus carried on into early 20th-century research into Henry, such as Kate Norgate's 1913 volume, which continued to make heavy use of the chronicler accounts and focused primarily on constitutional issues, with a distinctive nationalistic bias.|$|E
5|$|Coffin {{grew up on}} {{the family}} farm in North Carolina. He was educated at home and {{received}} little, if any, formal education. Exposed to slaves throughout his childhood, he <b>sympathized</b> <b>with</b> their condition. According to his own account, Coffin became an abolitionist at the age of seven when he asked a slave who was in a chain gang why he was bound. The man replied that it was to prevent him from escaping and returning to his wife and children. The event disturbed Coffin, who considered the impact of a father being taken away from his family.|$|E

5|$|McGovern {{endorsed}} Humphrey at the convention, to {{the dismay}} of some anti-war figures who considered it a betrayal. Humphrey went on to lose the general election to Richard Nixon. McGovern returned to his Senate reelection race, facing Republican former Governor Archie M. Gubbrud. While South Dakota voters <b>sympathized</b> <b>with</b> McGovern over his daughter's arrest, he initially suffered a substantial drop in popularity over the events in Chicago. However, McGovern conducted an energetic campaign that focused on his service to the state, while Gubbrud ran a lackluster effort. In November, McGovern won 57percent of the vote in what he would consider the easiest and most decisive victory of his career.|$|E
5|$|Morehead was a {{delegate}} to the Peace Conference of 1861 and the Border States Convention that attempted {{to stave off the}} Civil War. Although he favored Kentucky's neutrality, Morehead <b>sympathized</b> <b>with</b> the South and was an open critic of the Lincoln administration. He was imprisoned for disloyalty in September 1861, although no formal charges were ever brought against him. He was released from prison in January 1862, and afterward fled to Canada, Europe, and Mexico. After the war, he returned to the United States and settled on his plantation in Greenville, Mississippi, where he died on December 21, 1868.|$|E
5|$|On August 12, 1867, {{during a}} Senate recess, President Johnson {{suspended}} Secretary of War Edwin Stanton, a Lincoln appointee who <b>sympathized</b> <b>with</b> Congressional Reconstruction. To keep Grant under control {{as a potential}} political rival, Johnson asked {{him to take the}} post. Grant recommended against the move, in light of the Tenure of Office Act, which required Senate approval for cabinet removals. Johnson believed the Act did not apply to officers appointed by the previous president and forced the issue by making Grant an interim appointee on the same day. Grant agreed to accept the post temporarily, and Stanton vacated the office until the Senate reconvened.|$|E

5|$|After the {{outbreak}} of the American Civil War, the Kingdom of Hawaiʻi under King Kamehameha IV declared its neutrality on August 26, 1861. Many Native Hawaiians and Hawaiʻi-born Americans (mainly descendants of American missionaries) abroad and in the islands volunteered and enlisted in the military regiments of various states in the Union and the Confederacy. Native Hawaiians participating in the American wars during its period of independence was not unheard of. Individual Native Hawaiians had served in the United States Navy and Army since the War of 1812, and even more served during the American Civil War. Many Hawaiians <b>sympathized</b> <b>with</b> the Union because of Hawaiʻi's ties to New England through its missionaries and the whaling industries, and the ideological opposition of many to the institution of slavery.|$|E

5|$|Betances openly hated Estrada when {{he first}} met him in the late 1870s, but grew more {{tolerant}} of him with time, and even defended Estrada's actions as leader when he assumed control of the Cuban Revolutionary Party. The Puerto Rican affiliates to the Party viewed Estrada's leadership with great skepticism, since Estrada <b>sympathized</b> <b>with</b> {{the idea of having}} the United States intervene in the Cuban independence war to have the Spanish evicted from Cuba. They suspected that his weak leadership allowed opportunists to profit from an invasion and even suggest that the United States keep Puerto Rico in exchange for independence for Cuba. Some written evidence points to the truth of their affirmations, at least to the extent of wanting to have the Puerto Rican section of the Cuban Revolutionary Party shut down, which eventually did happen.|$|E

5|$|Estimates of Mexican {{casualties}} {{range from}} one to three soldiers killed and from three to seven wounded. Approximately 20soldiers escaped. They warned the garrisons at Copano and Refugio of the advancing Texians; those garrisons abandoned their posts and joined the soldiers at Fort Lipantitlán. Milam escorted the remaining Mexican soldiers to Gonzales, where the newly formed Texian Army was located. The Texian Army commander, Stephen F. Austin, later released all of the men, {{on the condition that}} they leave Texas and vow to stop fighting Texas residents. One wounded Mexican soldier was allowed to remain in Goliad, as was Captain Manuel Sabriego, who was married to a local woman. In secret, Sabriego began organizing a group of settlers in the Goliad area who <b>sympathized</b> <b>with</b> Mexico.|$|E
5|$|In {{the general}} election, Bradley carried {{the vote of}} many Gold Democrats. He also drew a number of votes from those who <b>sympathized</b> <b>with</b> {{the views of the}} American Protective Association, an anti-immigrant, anti-Catholic organization. Some {{estimates}} placed the organization's membership at 14,000 in Louisville alone; it also had strength in the urban centers of Paducah, Lexington, Ashland, Covington, and Frankfort. Democrats were also hurt by economic factors, including the national economic problems and a severe drought in the state. Bradley was elected the first Republican governor of Kentucky, defeating Hardin by a vote of 172,436 to 163,524. Pettit, the Populist candidate, drew 16,911 votes, most of them from Democrats in western Kentucky. Turnout in the election was 85%. More votes than potential voters were registered in 18 counties, nine of which went for Bradley and nine for Hardin.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1998, a number of senior U.S. {{intelligence}} officials met {{with the leaders of}} the KLA, and Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) agents arrived in northern Albania to monitor the fighting in Kosovo and assist in training rebel fighters. In exchange for American military, financial and intelligence support, KLA leaders promised not to carry out any actions outside Kosovo, not to continue participating in the drug trade, and not to accept help from Islamic radicals. Thus, the KLA ordered the 36 foreign Islamist fighters (or mujahideen) fighting in their ranks to leave Kosovo. Though few Kosovo Albanians <b>sympathized</b> <b>with</b> the Islamists, some argued that the KLA should have accepted assistance from any source, fundamentalist or otherwise. When KLA commanders ordered the mujahideen to leave, they refused, and disagreements arose within the KLA ranks as what was to be done with them.|$|E
