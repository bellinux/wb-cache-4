25|$|Terminal Server {{is managed}} by the Terminal Server Manager Microsoft Management Console <b>snap-in.</b> It {{can be used to}} {{configure}} the sign in requirements, as well as to enforce a single instance of remote session. It can also be configured by using Group Policy or Windows Management Instrumentation. It is, however, not available in client versions of Windows OS, where the server is pre-configured to allow only one session and enforce the rights of the user account on the remote session, without any customization.|$|E
50|$|The {{management}} console can host Component Object Model components called <b>snap-ins.</b> Most of Microsoft's administration {{tools are}} implemented as MMC <b>snap-ins.</b> Third parties can also implement their own <b>snap-ins</b> using the MMC's application programming interfaces {{published on the}} Microsoft Developer Network's web site.|$|R

25|$|The sealing {{materials}} of aluminum electrolytic capacitors {{depend on the}} different styles. For larger screw-terminal and <b>snap-in</b> capacitors the sealing washer is made of a plastic material. Axial electrolytic capacitors usually have a sealing washer made of phenolic resin laminated {{with a layer of}} rubber. Radial electrolytic capacitors use a rubber plug with a very dense structure. All sealing materials must be inert to the chemical parts of the electrolyte and may not contain soluble compounds that could lead to contamination of the electrolyte. To avoid leakage, the electrolyte must not be aggressive to the sealing material.|$|E
2500|$|RCA Victor 45s {{were also}} {{adapted to the}} smaller spindle of an LP player with a plastic <b>snap-in</b> insert known as a [...] "spider". These inserts, {{commissioned}} by RCA president David Sarnoff and invented by Thomas Hutchison, were prevalent starting in the 1960s, selling {{in the tens of}} millions per year during the 45rpm heyday. In countries outside the U.S., 45s often had the smaller album-sized holes, e.g., Australia and New Zealand, or as in the United Kingdom, especially before the 1970s, the disc had a small hole within a circular central section held only by three or four lands so that it could be easily punched out if desired (typically for use in jukeboxes).|$|E

5000|$|The most {{prolific}} MMC component, Computer Management, {{appears in the}} [...] "Administrative Tools" [...] folder in the Control Panel, under [...] "System and Security" [...] in Category View. Computer Management actually consists {{of a collection of}} MMC <b>snap-ins,</b> including the Device Manager, Disk Defragmenter, Internet Information Services (if installed), Disk Management, Event Viewer, Local Users and Groups (except in the home editions of Windows), Shared Folders, and other tools. Computer Management can also be pointed at another Windows machine altogether, allowing for monitoring and configuration of other computers on the local network that the user has access to.|$|R

50|$|When a FSMO role is {{transferred}} to a different DC, the original FSMO holder and the new FSMO holder communicate to ensure no data is lost during the transfer. If the original FSMO holder experienced an unrecoverable failure, you can force another DC to seize the lost roles; however, {{there is a risk}} of data loss {{because of the lack of}} communications. If you seize a FSMO role instead of transferring the role, that domain controller can never be allowed to host that FSMO role again, except for the PDC emulator Master operation and the Infrastructure Master Operation. Corruption can occur within Active Directory. FSMO roles can be easily moved between DCs using the AD <b>snap-ins</b> to the MMC or using , which is a command line-based tool.|$|R
50|$|The main {{tools that}} come with Windows 2000 {{can be found in}} the Computer Management console (in Administrative Tools in the Control Panel). This {{contains}} the Event Viewer—a means of seeing events and the Windows equivalent of a log file, a system information utility, a backup utility, Task Scheduler and management consoles to view open shared folders and shared folder sessions, configure and manage COM+ applications, configure Group Policy, manage all the local users and user groups, and a device manager. It contains Disk Management and Removable Storage <b>snap-ins,</b> a disk defragmenter as well as a performance diagnostic console, which displays graphs of system performance and configures data logs and alerts. It also contains a service configuration console, which allows users to view all installed services and to stop and start them, as well as configure what those services should do when the computer starts. CHKDSK has significant performance improvements.|$|R
