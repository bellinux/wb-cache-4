To hedge commodities that exhibit stochastic convenience yield, {{adjustments to the}} naive <b>stacked</b> <b>hedge</b> are necessary. Simulated and empirical tests of the hedging model using oil, copper, soybeans, gold and yen show that a <b>stacked</b> <b>hedge</b> reduces the volatility of terminal wealth. For commercial commodities, adjusting the hedge for stochastic convenience yield further reduces volatility. Kalman filter methods are used to estimate the parameters in the underlying.

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{degradation of}} nesting and feeding habitats for farmland birds, {{is one of}} the main causes of their steady decline. With the increasing formation of large-scale fields with uniform crops, the food conditions deteriorate for the birds on the field. After the political turn in the beginning of the 90 ies, there was also a need for the restructuring of cleared agricultural landscape in East Germany. In 1993, the so-called ‚Brandenburg stackedwood hedge‘ was created on a field south to Berlin as a model to show an ecological and economic way for the replanting of hedges and field margins. These small structures providing in their combination of both breeding and foraging habitat throughout the year. Under the current condition they are showing a way to improve the living conditions for birds on farmland. The ‚Brandenburg stacked-wood hedge‘ consists of two brush barriers of dead wood arranged in parallel. Between them, there is one row of native-species trees and shrubs planted. The 575 m long <b>stacked</b> <b>hedge</b> is adjoined by a five-metre-wide herbaceous strip established by sowing a suitable mixture of seed in 1994. Regular recording of birds from 1995 to 1998 and in 2004 shows the continuous use of the hedge as a habitat for birds. Already in 1994, the first red-backed shrikes were observed in the dead wood. In 1995, the dead wood provided a breeding ground for yellow-hammer, red-backed shrike, northern wheatear und yellow wagtail. In 1998, the shrubs had grown to a suitable size to shelter for the fi rst time white throat. In 2004, ten years after establishment of the hedgerow, 13 bird pairs of 7 species nested in the hedgerow - yellowhammer, red-backed shrike, northern wheatear, yellow wagtail, whitethroat, eurasian goldfinch, european robin. The yellow-hammer occurred most frequently with five pairs. Density of breeding birds totalled 2. 3 pairs per 100 m hedgerow. Investigations on the occurrence of hoverflies in the edge biotop and the adjacent field have shown, that there activity on the wild herb strips were five times higher in 1995 and seven times higher in 2004 than in the 5 m region of the adjacent arable crop. Since hoverflies representing the main part of the nestling food (yellowhammer), these figures demonstrate the importance of the edge biotop as foraging habitat...|$|E
