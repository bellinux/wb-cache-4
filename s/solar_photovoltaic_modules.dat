A total of 16 models have been reviewed by employing monthly mean daily meteorological data of Kuching, Sarawak. The most models showed similar trend of increase or decrease of <b>solar</b> <b>photovoltaic</b> <b>module</b> temperature due variation of solar radiation intensity. However, the results of reviewed models were quite different under constant solar radiation and ambient temperature conditions.

25|$|Multiple {{solar cells}} in an {{integrated}} group, all oriented in one plane, constitute a <b>solar</b> <b>photovoltaic</b> panel or <b>solar</b> <b>photovoltaic</b> <b>module.</b> <b>Photovoltaic</b> <b>modules</b> often have a sheet of glass on the sun-facing side, allowing light to pass while protecting the semiconductor wafers. Solar cells are usually connected in series and parallel circuits or series in modules, creating an additive voltage. Connecting cells in parallel yields a higher current; however, problems such as shadow effects can shut down the weaker (less illuminated) parallel string (a number of series connected cells) causing substantial power loss and possible damage because of the reverse bias applied to the shadowed cells by their illuminated partners. Strings of series cells are usually handled independently and not connected in parallel, though as of 2014, individual power boxes are often supplied for each module, and are connected in parallel. Although modules can be interconnected to create an array with the desired peak DC voltage and loading current capacity, using independent MPPTs (maximum power point trackers) is preferable. Otherwise, shunt diodes can reduce shadowing power loss in arrays with series/parallel connected cells.|$|R
