2500|$|In 2013, Chris Christie, the Governor of New Jersey, stated {{his support}} of the Mets and {{confusion}} over why Yankee fans jeer Met fans: [...] "OK, here's what I don't understand about Yankees fans: The Mets stink. We're awful. And the Yankees are usually really good. <b>So</b> <b>why</b> <b>do</b> you boo us? You should feel badly for us. We root for this awful team that never wins and yet the Yankees fans boo us. I don't understand that." ...|$|E
2500|$|Kant also {{credited}} David Hume with awakening {{him from}} dogmatic slumber (circa 1771). Hume had stated that experience consists only of sequences of feelings, images or sounds. Ideas such as [...] "cause", goodness, or objects were not evident in experience, <b>so</b> <b>why</b> <b>do</b> {{we believe in}} the reality of these? Kant felt that reason could remove this skepticism, and he set himself to solving these problems. He did not publish any work in philosophy for the next 11 years.|$|E

2500|$|The notion {{implicit}} in questions like this attributed by the rabbis to Koraḥ {{is the same}} as that expressed in Koraḥ's challenge to Moses and Aaron (Numbers 16:3), [...] "The entire congregation is holy, and God is in their midst, <b>so</b> <b>why</b> <b>do</b> you exalt yourselves above God's congregation?" [...] Koraḥ ostensibly subscribed to the laws that were the subject of his questions to Moses, but was really using them to mock and discredit Moses. Therefore, Koraḥ's question about a tallit made entirely of blue yarn, which is ostensibly [...] "more kosher than tzitzit" [...] but is really not, since it still requires tzitzit, became, in Hebrew idiom, an epithet used sarcastically against hypocritical displays of false piety.|$|E
6000|$|... "Is it <b>so?</b> <b>Why</b> <b>do</b> we hear then 'of {{the poor}} sequestered stag, left and {{abandoned}} of his velvet friend?' No, Mr. Bertram, grief, I fear, {{must still be}} solitary." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Like {{most other}} men, I suppose,' {{returned}} Mr Garland, smiling. 'I can be, if I am interested; {{and if not}} interested, I should still try to appear <b>so.</b> <b>Why</b> <b>do</b> you ask?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do {{you mean}} {{that you are the}} goddess Isis?" [...] I asked, bewildered. [...] "Because if <b>so</b> <b>why</b> <b>did</b> you tell me that you were but her priestess?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But I don't understand," [...] {{said the}} Angel. [...] "Why does he sway about <b>so?</b> <b>Why</b> <b>does</b> he keep {{on trying to}} pick up his hat like that--and missing it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Lucy, dearest," [...] she said, [...] "what {{has become}} of Rupert? Does he know I am dying? If <b>so,</b> <b>why</b> <b>does</b> he not {{come and see}} me, for the last time?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why <b>so?</b> <b>Why</b> <b>do</b> you say it? Why do you torment me? Why do you banish me at once, {{and tell}} me that I must go home a wretched, miserable man? Why?--why?--why? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, do {{not look}} so! You appal me! Oh, what can the matter be? What is it you see? Why do you stare <b>so?</b> <b>Why</b> <b>do</b> you work your fingers like that?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'And am I then,' I exclaimed, 'descended {{from this}} unhappy race? Do {{you belong to}} it? And if <b>so,</b> <b>why</b> <b>do</b> I sustain {{restraint}} and hard usage {{at the hands of}} a relation?' ...|$|E
60|$|Why {{could not}} he himself desire a woman <b>so?</b> <b>Why</b> <b>did</b> {{he never really}} want a woman, not with the whole of him: never loved, never worshipped, only just {{physically}} wanted her.|$|R
6000|$|... 'No,' said Gethryn wearily, 'it isn't a puncture. I always let the air {{out when}} I'm riding. It looks so much better, don't you think <b>so?</b> <b>Why</b> <b>did</b> they let you out? Good-bye.' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I can't understand," [...] said Hank, [...] "why dogs bark at the moon. They can't {{scare the}} moon, {{and the moon}} doesn't pay any {{attention}} to the bark. <b>So</b> <b>why</b> <b>do</b> dogs do it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{as that is}} <b>so,</b> <b>why</b> <b>do</b> you not go and see her? I am {{sure you}} are {{not one of those}} who would play such a trick as that upon such a girl with the mere purpose of amusing yourself." ...|$|E

5000|$|Discussing {{whether the}} biographical {{basis of this}} song is important, {{literary}} critic Christopher Ricks has argued, [...] "Everyone can understand the feelings and the relationship described in the song, <b>so</b> <b>why</b> <b>does</b> it matter if Dylan wrote it with one woman in mind?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, John,--why did {{you ever}} come here? <b>Why?</b> <b>Why</b> <b>did</b> we meet at that fatal woman's house? Or, meeting <b>so,</b> <b>why</b> <b>did</b> we not part as strangers?

6000|$|... "Cospetto! am I a fool? a blunderer? if <b>so,</b> <b>why</b> <b>does</b> the Senate employ me? {{the girl}} is out of hearing, and there let her stay. As long as the noble dames are willing to breathe the night air, they shall have none of her company." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thus you may {{say again}} before {{everything}} is done, husband; {{but if it}} be <b>so,</b> <b>why</b> <b>do</b> you love me and tie me to you with your wizardry? Cut the knot, and let me go my way while you go yours." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If this be <b>so,</b> <b>why</b> <b>do</b> not the pale-faces let us {{keep out}} hunting- grounds to ourselves? We are content. We {{do not wish}} to be Jews. Our canoes are too small to cross the great salt lake. They are hardly large enough to cross the great lakes of sweet water. We should be tired of {{paddling}} so far. My brother says there is a rich land under the rising sun, which the Manitou gave to the red men. Is this so?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Are {{you only}} a servant, perhaps, that rather {{sinister}} old servant who was butler to Hawker and Verner? If so, you are certainly the only {{link between the}} two periods.

5000|$|Rabbi Dov Lior {{said the}} {{abduction}} was God's punishment for anti-religious {{legislation in the}} Knesset and Israel's readiness to abandon parts of the Land of Israel.

60|$|While I am {{mentioning}} these things, methinks it is {{very hard}} that we should obey the whispers of evil spirits, and not much rather receive the notices which good ones are pleased to give. We never perceive the misfortune of this, but when in real danger; and then we cry, My mind misgave me when I was going about it; but if <b>so,</b> <b>why</b> <b>do</b> you fight the caution? Why not listen to it as to a voice? and then there had been no reason to make this complaint.|$|E

5000|$|The [...] "rock objection" [...] {{notes that}} {{thinking}} about a rock doesn't cause the rock to [...] "light up" [...] with consciousness, <b>so</b> <b>why</b> <b>does</b> {{thinking about a}} first-order percept cause it to light up?
