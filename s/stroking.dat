5|$|Touching is an {{important}} form of communication among elephants. Individuals greet each other by <b>stroking</b> or wrapping their trunks; the latter also occurs during mild competition. Older elephants use trunk-slaps, kicks, and shoves to discipline younger ones. Individuals of any age and sex will touch each other's mouths, temporal glands, and genitals, particularly during meetings or when excited. This allows individuals to pick up chemical cues. Touching {{is especially important for}} mother–calf communication. When moving, elephant mothers will touch their calves with their trunks or feet when side-by-side or with their tails if the calf is behind them. If a calf wants to rest, it will press against its mother's front legs and when it wants to suckle, it will touch her breast or leg.|$|E

40|$|Background: <b>Stroke</b> unit care offers {{significant}} {{benefits in}} survival and dependency {{when compared to}} general medical ward. Most <b>stroke</b> units are either acute or rehabilitation, but comprehensive (combined acute and rehabilitation) model (comprehensive <b>stroke</b> unit) is less common. Aim: To examine different levels of evidence of comprehensive <b>stroke</b> unit compared to other organized inpatient <b>stroke</b> care and share local experience of comprehensive <b>stroke</b> units. Methods: Cochrane Library and Medline (1980 to December 2010) review of English language articles comparing <b>stroke</b> units to alternative forms of <b>stroke</b> care delivery, different types of <b>stroke</b> unit models, and differences in processes of care within different <b>stroke</b> unit models. Different levels of comparative evidence of comprehensive <b>stroke</b> units to other models of <b>stroke</b> units are collected. Results: There are no randomized controlled trials directly comparing comprehensive <b>stroke</b> units to other <b>stroke</b> unit models (either acute or rehabilitation). Comprehensive <b>stroke</b> units are associated with reduced length of stay and greatest reduction in combined death and dependency in a meta-analysis study {{when compared to other}} <b>stroke</b> unit models. Comprehensive <b>stroke</b> units also have better length of stay and functional outcome when compared to acute or rehabilitation <b>stroke</b> unit models in a cross-sectional study, and better length of stay in a ‘before-and-after’ comparative study. Components of <b>stroke</b> unit care that improve outcome are multifactorial and most probably include early mobilization. A comprehensive <b>stroke</b> unit model has been successfully implemented in metropolitan and rural hospital settings. Conclusions: Comprehensive <b>stroke</b> units are associated with reductions in length of stay and combined death and dependency and improved functional outcomes compared to other <b>stroke</b> unit models.

5|$|The {{kings and}} queens regnant of England and the kings of France were the only Christian rulers who claimed the divine gift (divinitus) to cure by {{touching}} or <b>stroking</b> the diseased.

In England, Saint Edward the Confessor (r. 1042–1066) was said to be the first monarch to possess the healing power of the royal touch. The French, who normally traced the origins of their monarchs' divine gift back to Philip I (r. 1059–1108) or even Robert II (r. 987–1031), denied that Saint Edward used the royal touch.

Methods—We did an observational register–linkage study of all patients with ischemic <b>stroke</b> treated in Finland between 1999 and 2006. After exclusion of recurrent <b>strokes</b> and nonanalyzable patients, we included 61 685 consecutive patients treated in 333 hospitals classified in national audits either as Comprehensive <b>Stroke</b> Centers, Primary <b>Stroke</b> Centers, or General Hospitals according to Brain Attack Coalition criteria. Primary outcome measures were case-fatality and being in institutional care 1 year after <b>stroke.</b> Results—Care in <b>stroke</b> centers was associated with lower 1 -year case-fatality and reduced institutional care compared with General Hospitals. The number-needed-to-treat to prevent 1 death or institutional care at 1 year was 29 for Comprehensive <b>Stroke</b> Centers and 40 for Primary <b>Stroke</b> Centers versus General Hospitals.

40|$|Introduction: Analysis of {{reliable}} registry data can direct future research to influence clinical care. Data from the Virtual International <b>Stroke</b> Trials Archive {{have been used}} to test hypotheses and inform trial design. We sought to expand Virtual International <b>Stroke</b> Trials Archive into a broader <b>stroke</b> resource with new opportunities for research and international collaboration. Methods: Using procedures initially developed for an acute <b>stroke</b> trial archive, we invited trialists to lodge data on rehabilitation, secondary prevention, intracerebral haemorrhage, imaging, and observational <b>stroke</b> studies. Results: We have extended Virtual International <b>Stroke</b> Trials Archive into six subsections: Virtual International <b>Stroke</b> Trials Archive-Acute (n[*]=[*] 28 [*] 190 patients’ data), Virtual International <b>Stroke</b> Trials Archive-Rehab (n[*]=[*] 10 [*] 194), Virtual International <b>Stroke</b> Trials Archive-intracerebral haemorrhage (n[*]=[*] 1829), Virtual International <b>Stroke</b> Trials Archive-Prevention, Virtual International <b>Stroke</b> Trials Archive-Imaging (n[*]=[*] 1300), and Virtual International <b>Stroke</b> Trials Archive-Plus (n[*]=[*] 6573). Enrollment continues, with commitments for the contribution of six further trials to Virtual International <b>Stroke</b> Trials Archive-Prevention, 13 trials to Virtual International <b>Stroke</b> Trials Archive-Rehab, and one registry to Virtual International <b>Stroke</b> Trials Archive-Plus. Data on age, type of <b>stroke,</b> medical history, outcomes by modified Rankin scale and Barthel Index (BI), mortality, and adverse events are available for analyses. The Virtual International <b>Stroke</b> Trials Archive network encourages the development of young investigators and provides opportunities for international peer review and collaboration. Conclusions: Application of the original Virtual International <b>Stroke</b> Trials Archive concepts beyond acute <b>stroke</b> trials can extend the value of clinical research at low cost, without threatening commercial or intellectual property interests. This delivers valuable research output to inform the efficiency of future <b>stroke</b> research.
