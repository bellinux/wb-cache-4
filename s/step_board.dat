The passenger stations did not have raised platforms, and the passenger carriages had three levels of <b>step</b> <b>board</b> which folded down to enable passengers to board. The Caledonian Railway worked the line, and no 172, an 0-4-4T {{was used in the}} early years. The trains were mixed (passenger and goods) and the maximum speed was 20 mph (32 km/h).|$|E

40|$|Abstract 1. The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the effects whole body vibrations on maximal strength, power output and neuromuscular activity in m. pectoralis major during bench press. Participants consisted of 35 male and 9 female military high school students (m= 23, 1 years). On the basis of initial maximal performances in bench press the participants was divided into two experiments groups and one control group. Intervention groups performed a specifically designed push up program on a vibrating plate respectively a <b>step</b> <b>board</b> during 12 weeks Initial load at 60 % of 1 RM showed an average of 46, 5 kg. All groups showed an average increase of 13 kg for each person after 12 weeks. Initial value for power output showed a mean of 265 watt, which also showed an increase with an average of 7 watt (with a load equivalent of 60 % of 1 RM at the current test occasion), respectively an increase of 41 watt (with the load performed during the first test occasion). A positive correlation existed between the load at 60 % of 1 RM and achieved power output. No significant differences between groups were exposed concerning estimated maximum strength or power output in bench press. All participants showed an increase in strength development, indicating that vibration stimuli could be compared to traditional push ups training without vibrations. Vibrations seem to have more effects on the magnitude of recruited motor units, why vibrations training could be a good complement to established strength training. Abstract 2. The {{purpose of this}} study was to investigate the effects whole body vibrations on strength development, power output and neuromuscular activity in m. pectoralis major during bench press. The purpose was also to examine what roll self-efficacy plays in strength tasks. Participants consisted of 35 male and 9 female military high school students (m= 23, 1 years). On the basis of initial maximal performances in bench press the participants was divided into two experiments groups and one control group. Intervention groups performed a specifically designed push up program on a vibrating plate respectively a <b>step</b> <b>board</b> during 12 weeks. All participants answered a battery of questionnaires concerning backgrounds, motives for sport participation, self-efficacy and efficacy sources. Initial load at 60 % of 1 RM showed an average of 46, 5 kg (sd = 13, 8). All groups showed an average increase of 13 kg for each person after 12 weeks. Initial value for power output showed a mean of 265 watt, which also showed an increase with an average of 7 watt (with a load equivalent of 60 % of 1 RM at the current test occasion), respectively an increase of 41 watt (with the load performed during the first test occasion). A positive correlation existed between the load at 60 % of 1 RM and achieved power output. No significant differences between groups were exposed concerning estimated maximum strength or power output in bench press. Gender differences showed that men lifted significantly heavier loads at 60 % of 1 RM compared to women. No significant differences could be seen between the groups concerning self efficacy. Gender differences were exposed concerning self-efficacy to push ups with a pat. The efficacy sources “performance accomplishments” was valuated to be the most influential to form self-efficacy expectations. A strong positive relationship between “performance accomplishments” and achieved self-efficacy to push ups with pats were shown. Self-efficacy to push ups with a pat also correlated positively with power output and performed 60 % of 1 RM in bench press. All participants showed an increase in strength development, indicating that vibration stimuli could be compared to traditional push ups training without vibrations. Vibrations seem to have more effects on the magnitude of recruited motor units, why vibrations training could be a good complement to established strength training. Participants relatively high self-efficacy to strength tasks is probably a result of performance accomplishments in there own strength straining rather than the intervention training. Positive relationships between self-efficacy and power output as well as performed 60 % of 1 RM in bench press, indicating that high self-efficacy have a positive influence on strength performance.
