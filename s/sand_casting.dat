25|$|Full-mold casting is an evaporative-pattern {{casting process}} {{which is a}} {{combination}} of <b>sand</b> <b>casting</b> and lost-foam casting. It uses an expanded polystyrene foam pattern which is then surrounded by sand, much like <b>sand</b> <b>casting.</b> The metal is then poured directly into the mold, which vaporizes the foam upon contact.|$|E
25|$|<b>Sand</b> <b>casting</b> {{has many}} defects {{that can occur}} due to the mold failing. The mold usually fails because of one of two reasons: the wrong {{material}} is used or it is improperly rammed.|$|E

50|$|The {{inside of}} each <b>sand</b> <b>cast</b> mold was layered with {{plasticine}} (¼ inch thick). The application of graphite to the <b>sand</b> <b>cast</b> and the plasticine prevented the materials from bonding. A second <b>sand</b> <b>cast</b> was {{made over the}} plasticine. This process created a void, which would be filled with melted bronze. To avoid the formation of air pockets air vents were installed before pouring the bronze. The bronze sections were welded together and sandblasted (using a wire brush) to clean the sculpture and produce a uniform texture. Lastly, the bronze was coated with a patina {{to protect it from}} the elements of the outdoors.|$|R

25|$|Shell moulding, {{also known}} as shell-mould casting, is an {{expendable}} mold casting process that uses a resin covered sand to form the mold.

It is used for small to medium parts that require high precision.|$|E
25|$|Between the wars, many {{aerospace}} innovations were in {{the field}} of manufacturing processes, rather than just an inherently stronger material, although these too benefited from improved materials. One of the R.R. alloys, R.R.53B, had added silicon which improved its fluidity when molten. This allowed its use for die casting as well as the previous <b>sand</b> <b>casting,</b> a means of making parts that were both far cheaper and also more accurate in shape and finish. Better control of their shape allowed designers to shape them more precisely to their tasks, leading to parts that were also thinner and lighter.|$|E

40|$|To produce prototypes with {{mechanical}} properties expectable from EN AC 46000 HPDC components, prototyping related {{processes such as}} sand and plaster gravity casting as well as proper alloying and post solidification processes need to be understood and adjusted. Therefore, the influence of process, composition and heat treatment on tensile and fatigue behaviour has been investigated for an EN AC 42100 alloy. <b>Sand</b> <b>cast</b> test samples comprised the base alloy in as-cast condition and T 5 treated {{as well as a}} 2 wt. % Cu addition in as-cast condition. Plaster cast test samples consisted of the base alloy in ascast condition and T 6 treated as well as a 1. 7 wt. % Cu addition in as-cast condition. Tensile and fully reversed bending fatigue tests (R=- 1) have been performed and the results have been compared to EN AC 46000 HPDC values. Samples in heat treated conditions and with Cu addition exhibited superior tensile properties than the base alloy in as-cast state for both casting processes. Yield strength and elongation values for the <b>sand</b> <b>cast</b> T 5 treated and with Cu addition samples were similar to the HPDC ones. In terms of fatigue behaviour, T 6 treated and with Cu addition samples exhibited strength improvements for plaster cast samples, while no changes were observed for <b>sand</b> <b>cast</b> samples. Only <b>sand</b> <b>cast</b> samples exhibited similar fatigue behaviour to the HPDC samples. The <b>sand</b> <b>cast</b> T 5 treated samples were found to produce the most similar overall mechanical behaviour to EN AC 46000 HPDC...|$|R

25|$|Shell mold casting is a {{metal casting}} process similar to <b>sand</b> <b>casting,</b> in that molten metal is poured into an {{expendable}} mold. However, in shell mold casting, the mold is a thin-walled shell created from applying a sand-resin mixture around a pattern. The pattern, a metal {{piece in the}} shape of the desired part, is reused to form multiple shell molds. A reusable pattern allows for higher production rates, while the disposable molds enable complex geometries to be cast. Shell mold casting requires the use of a metal pattern, oven, sand-resin mixture, dump box, and molten metal.|$|E
25|$|Towards {{the end of}} 1968, Kaplan enlisted {{help from}} Dan Byer, a retired {{engineer}} from AMC, {{for the development of}} a new block casting. Using the basic AMC 390 drawings, they added more mass for four-bolt mains and improved the oiling system. A run of 50 blocks was contracted to Central Foundries in Windsor, Ontario. Because this was a small run, and there was little factory support, it fell to Kaplan and his staff to clean up the blocks from the <b>sand</b> <b>casting,</b> hone the various passages and, finally, send them to AMC’s “Parts Central” in Kenosha. From there, they could draw on the inventory, as required.|$|E
25|$|Cast threads {{in metal}} parts may be {{finished}} by machining, {{or may be}} left in the as-cast state. (The same can be said of cast gear teeth.) Whether or not to bother with the additional expense of a machining operation depends on the application. For parts where the extra precision and surface finish is not strictly necessary, the machining is forgone in order to achieve a lower cost. With <b>sand</b> <b>casting</b> parts this means a rather rough finish; but with molded plastic or die-cast metal, the threads can be very nice indeed straight from the mold or die. A common example of molded plastic threads is on soda (pop) bottles. A common example of die-cast threads is on cable glands (connectors/fittings).|$|E
40|$|Studies {{the fatigue}} {{behaviour}} of Al- 7 Si- 0. 3 Mg <b>sand</b> <b>cast</b> alloys at varying iron levels and with beryllium and manganese trace additions {{and when the}} alloy is stircast and extruded. From the stress (S) -number of cycles to failure (N) -(S-N) curves {{it is observed that}} the presence of higher amount of iron (0. 76 %) in <b>sand</b> <b>cast</b> alloys leads to a shorter fatigue life. Beryllium and manganese additions to a higher iron containing alloy (0. 76 %) show better fatigue properties than low (0. 29 %) and high (0. 76 %) iron containing <b>sand</b> <b>cast</b> alloys, thus countering the detrimental effect of iron. The better fatigue life of beryllium and manganese added high iron alloy is due to the presence of (Be,Mn) -Fe phases only inside α-Al dendrites. The fatigue life of stircast and extruded low iron (0. 44 %) alloy is superior to <b>sand</b> <b>cast</b> low (0. 29 %) iron alloys. Observation of fractured surfaces reveals that porosity/inclusions is the high stress concentrating point where the crack originates (stage-I) and then propagates (stage-II) depending on the presence of the second phases. In the case of low iron alloys (sand and extruded stircast) a crack propagates along eutectic silicon, while in the high iron alloys a crack propagates through the brittle β-phase. In beryllium and manganese added alloys, even though a crack nucleates on the (Be,Mn) -Fe phase, it will be arrested as it approaches α-Al dendrites and hence, the crack has to propagate along silicon particles. The fractured surface of the stircast and extruded alloys has revealed fine fatigue fracture with striation as compared to <b>sand</b> <b>cast</b> alloys. This aspect of crack nucleation and propagation is explained schematically...|$|R

The {{results show that the}} corrosion resistance of the four alloys can be ranked in decreasing order as AZ 91 > AZ 91 ≈ MEZ > MEZ and that the intergranular phases and chemical composition of the matrix phase have a significant influence on the corrosion performance.

40|$|The work {{presented}} aims to find {{alternatives for}} the prototyping of components by sand and plaster mold manufacturing processes that deliver properties similar to high pressure die <b>casting</b> (HPDC). <b>Sand</b> and plaster test samples have been casted. The Al- 7 Si- 0. 35 Mg alloy {{has been tested}} in as cast condition and in a heat treated condition; T 5 for <b>sand</b> <b>cast</b> samples and T 6 for those plaster cast. The Al- 7 Si- 2 Cu- 0. 35 Mg alloy was also tested in as cast condition. Tensile, fatigue and hardness tests have been performed. Microstructural investigation comprising secondary dendrite arm spacing, defects, Fe-rich β-phases and Si size measurements has been performed on the different conditions. The results have been compared to available data for Al- 9 Si- 3 Cu-(Fe) alloy used in HPDC. The T 5 heat treated <b>sand</b> <b>cast</b> condition has shown to have properties similar to HPDC. All other <b>sand</b> <b>cast</b> conditions, including the previously tested Al- 9 Si- 3 Cu-(Fe) alloy, {{have been shown to}} be reasonable alternatives...|$|R
25|$|In {{a similar}} vein, the cold-box process uses a binder that is {{hardened}} {{through the use}} of special gases. The binder coated sand is packed into a core box and then sealed so that a curing gas can be introduced. These gases are often toxic (i.e. amine gas) or odorous (i.e. SO2), so special handling systems must be used. However, because high temperatures are not required the core box can be made from metal, wood, or plastic. An added benefit is that hollow core can be formed if the gas is introduced via holes in the core surface which cause only the surface of the core to harden; the remaining sand is then just dumped out to be used again. For example, a cold-box <b>sand</b> <b>casting</b> core binder is sodium silicate which hardens on exposure to carbon dioxide.|$|E

2500|$|Casting is a {{group of}} {{manufacturing}} processes by which a liquid material (bronze, copper, glass, aluminum, iron) is (usually) poured into a mold, which contains a hollow cavity of the desired shape, and then allowed to solidify.

Casting may be used to form hot liquid metals or various materials that cold set after mixing of components (such as epoxies, concrete, plaster and clay). Casting is most often used for making complex shapes that would be otherwise difficult or uneconomical to make by other methods.
