Twenty-nine in-depth {{interviews were conducted with}} older people who receive long-term community care. The interviews were subjected to a thematic content analysis. The findings suggest that the main <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>strength</b> identified among older people were constituted on three domains of analysis; the individual-, interactional and contextual domain.

Within these subdomains a variety <b>of</b> <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>strength</b> were found like pride about ones personality, acceptance and openness about ones vulnerability, the anticipation on future losses, mastery by practising skills, the acceptance of help and support, having a balanced vision on life, not adapting the role of a victim and carpe-diem. The interactional domain is defined as the way older people cooperate and interact with others to achieve their personal goals. <b>Sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>strength</b> on this domain were empowering (in) formal relationships and the power of giving. Lastly, the contextual domain refers to a broader political-societal level and includes <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>strength</b> like the accessibility of care, the availability of material resources and social policy. The three domains were found to be inherently linked to each other. The results can be used for the development of positive, proactive interventions aimed at helping older people build on the positive aspects of their lives...|$|R

25|$|The start zone of an {{avalanche}} must be steep {{enough to allow}} snow to accelerate once set in motion, additionally convex slopes are less stable than concave slopes, because of the disparity between the tensile strength of snow layers and their compressive strength. The composition {{and structure of the}} ground surface beneath the snowpack influences the stability of the snowpack, either being a <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>strength</b> or weakness. Avalanches are unlikely to form in very thick forests, but boulders and sparsely distributed vegetation can create weak areas deep within the snowpack through the formation of strong temperature gradients. Full-depth avalanches (avalanches that sweep a slope virtually clean of snow cover) are more common on slopes with smooth ground, such as grass or rock slabs.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} {{explored}} {{the school and}} life experiences of four individuals, {{between the ages of}} 19 - 30, who were diagnosed with a Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD). Semi-structured interviews provided insight into the lives of these adults. Their experiences with this disorder as it relates to their social interactions and peer relationships in the community, elementary, and high school, were explored. Merriam’s (2002) basic qualitative approach was utilized to explore the experiences of these individuals. A definitional focus on resiliency remained present when analyzing data generated through the interviews. Their educational and life experiences were examined with the goal of understanding how success is achieved among these individuals. Three major themes emerged from participant interviews: (1) “I don’t fit in”: negative school experiences lead to anger and frustration toward diagnosis; (2) intergenerational alcoholism, child abuse, and drug addiction; and (3) healing the wounds: <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>strength,</b> success and helping others. Despite the hardships these participants faced, they each found <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>strength</b> and success that have allowed them to be resilient in the face <b>of</b> adversity. These <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>strength</b> and success are considered in connection with existing research literature.

500|$|Shortly {{after the}} 1977 Aldeburgh Festival, Imogen became seriously ill {{with what she}} {{described}} as [...] "a coronary angina". Thereafter, angina was a recurrent problem, although she continued to work and fulfil engagements. By early 1984 the deterioration in her health was noticeable to her friends. She died at home of heart failure on 9 March 1984 and was buried in Aldeburgh churchyard five days later in a plot next to Britten's. An obituary tribute in the magazine Early Music emphasised her long association with music in the Aldeburgh church, where she [...] " [...] iridescently to life facets of that tradition to which her own life had been dedicated and which she presented as a continuing <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>strength</b> and wonder". [...] Ursula Vaughan Williams wrote: [...] "Imogen had something of the medieval scholar about her... content with few creature comforts if there was enough music, enough work, enough books to fill her days.

500|$|Despite {{intending}} to accord the other [...] "Germanics" [...] of Europe a racially superior status alongside the Germans {{themselves in an}} anticipated post-war racio-political order, the Nazis did not however consider granting the subject populations of these countries any national rights of their own. The other Germanic countries were seen as mere extensions of Germany rather than individual units in any way, and the Germans were unequivocally intended to remain the empire's [...] "most powerful <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>strength,</b> from both an ideological as well as military standpoint". Even Heinrich Himmler, who among the senior Nazis most staunchly supported the concept, could not shake off {{the idea of a}} hierarchical distinction between German Volk and Germanic Völker. The SS's official newspaper, Das Schwarze Korps, never succeeded in reconciling the contradiction between Germanic 'brotherhood' and German superiority. Members of Nazi-type parties in Germanic countries were also forbidden to attend public meetings of the Nazi Party when they visited Germany. After the Battle of Stalingrad this ban was lifted, but only if the attendees made prior notice of their arrival so that the events' speakers could be warned in advance not to make disparaging remarks about their country of origin.|$|E

500|$|Several co-stars found Steiger difficult; Warren Oates, {{according}} to director Norman Jewison, viewed Steiger as [...] "somebody {{who had a}} tendency to go over the top" [...] during the making of In The Heat of the Night. Writer Richard Dyer highlights the contrast in the film between the acting styles of Steiger and Poitier, with [...] "Poitier's stillness and implied intensity" [...] and [...] "Steiger's busy, exteriorised method acting". Humphrey Bogart, Steiger's co-star of The Harder They Fall, referred to Steiger's method acting as the [...] "scratch-your-ass-and-mumble school of acting". Director Robert Aldrich notes that Steiger had a habit of changing his lines, which often confused his co-stars. Aldrich stated: [...] "Usually I lie awake at nights trying to think of ways to improve an actor's performance. With Steiger, the problem is to try and contain him". Steiger was particularly aggressive towards director Kenneth Annakin during the making of Across the Bridge, insisting on rewriting most of the script and changing many of the lines to better fit Steiger's idea of the character. Annakin stated that he had [...] "never known an actor to put so much thought and preparation into a performance" [...] as Steiger. Hutchinson revealed that Steiger often suffered from panic during filming and that fear of failure haunted him throughout his life, but fear also provided him with a <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>strength</b> in his acting.|$|E
500|$|As {{neither side}} had {{established}} a winning lead in the series, the final match at The Oval was to be played to a finish, {{no matter how long}} it took. England scored a record team total of 903runs and Australia were heavily defeated. Verity, one of five Yorkshire players in the team, bowled 12overs in the game and took two wickets. He also played a part in the achievement of Len Hutton, who scored 364runs, breaking the record for the highest individual innings in a Test match. As Hutton's innings began to assume epic proportions, Verity stayed with him throughout the intervals, helping him to maintain concentration. On the Sunday of the match, when there was no play, Verity arranged for Hutton to have a break by the sea to relax away from cricket. Hutton commented: [...] "I owe [...] the kind of debt that one can never fully repay... His quiet, natural dignity was an immense <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>strength</b> to me throughout those long hours". The series was drawn; Verity took 14wickets at an average of 25.28, finishing second in the England bowling averages, behind Bowes. However, Charlie Barnett, who played in the series but disliked Hammond, believed that Hammond's poor tactical use of Verity cost England potential victories in the second and fourth Tests. Verity played no other representative cricket that season, but appeared once more against the Australians for H. D. G. Leveson-Gower's team which defeated the tourists by 10 wickets.|$|E
500|$|The {{tour was}} also notable for {{giving rise to}} the term [...] "new Madonna", a {{stronger}} and more intelligent sexual image of her former self which had given rise to the term Madonna wannabe. Considine felt that [...] "the important thing Madonna did on the tour was to demonstrate how female sexuality can be a <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>strength.</b> Traditionally in pop culture, there are two roles that a woman can play—the good girl and the bad girl, and the bad girl is never taken seriously. But Madonna shows up {{the trappings of a}} bad girl, and demanded to be taken up seriously because she just doesn't roll over. I got more sense of the strength and power that was under her image all along." [...] Another important fact noted in the tour by scholars is the extensive use of multimedia technique to its maximum potential. Says Mark Bego, author of Madonna: Blonde Ambition, that [...] "Madonna transformed the concept of a concert tour being focused on the songs. She turned her Who's That Girl? tour into a ubiquitous multimedia blitz technique by including songs, dancing, choreography, videos, big screens, backdrops—not to mention the subtle preaching and messages—that made singing a secondary quality for concert goers. Evident from the people that thronged to see the tour, they were there for the spectacle—and not see Madonna {{standing in front of the}} microphone and singing.|$|E
