This is likely to continue in the era of digital technologies. So the investigation of metric features of a digital <b>stereoscopic</b> <b>model</b> is valuable for the modern photogrammetry. We should also note that the widely used automatic stereoscopic measurements will be always rationally integrated with visual human-assisted measurements. Investigations in this area are conducted at the Laboratory of Aerospace Methods of Lomonosov Moscow State University in two directions: study of the influence of discretization on the formation of stereoscopic model; and study of influence of different factors on the accuracy of <b>stereoscopic</b> <b>model</b> measurements. The first direction implies research of discrete stereomodel formation at micro-level, namely the investigation of the influence of images pixel structure on geometric properties of the stereomodel. The main method used here is the construction of graphic stereogramms for different positions of an image in relation to the pixel matrix and their stereoscopic observations for control. Experiments have shown that pixel discretization of images may lead to horizontal and vertical distortion of stereomodel’s points for up to 1 - 2 pixels. The second direction includes experimental investigations of digital stereomodel metric properties by computer measurements of a real pair of stereo pictures (photo-theodolite images), digitized with different pixel sizes.

Six datasets and photogrammetric flights corresponding to the years 1956, 1984, 1992, 2001, 2008, and 2010 were surveyed. The more recent flight of 2010 combined an aerial digital camera and a LiDAR sensor and was oriented by means of in-flight data and tie points. This 2010 flight allowed for the generation of a reliable and high-precision Digital Terrain Model (DTM).

At present, a number of commercially available software provides algorithms allowing for almost automatic generation of DSM and Digital Elevation Model (DEM). Since the development of specialist satellite systems designed mainly for supplying this type of products and provided with a double optical system (e. g., Cartostat), interest in their capabilities is continuously growing.

In order to answer this question, we have performed a structure-activity relationship study by using both in vitro and in vivo preparations. MicroM amounts of taurine or each of 20 analogues were injected intracerebroventricularly in conscious, restrained rabbits while rectal temperature was recorded. Receptor-binding studies, with synaptic membrane preparations from rabbit brain were used to determine the affinities of these compounds for GABA(A) and GABA(B) receptors.

40|$|The {{recording}} {{of a large}} amount of data required for high resolution digital images is a common problem in digital photogrammetric applications, where several digital images occur for each block. One solution could be, that of using compression algorithms (JPEG, ECW and now JPEG 2000) that allow an extremely large amount of image data to be compressed into a relatively small amount of data. Even the most recent compressor algorithms declare a lossless compression ratio, the most efficient are lossy (the compression of the image data decreases the geometric and radiometric quality information). The effects of the JPEG 2000 compression algorithm on the geometric quality of compressed images is studied in this analisis. This evaluation has been made for the case of automatic and manual stereo plotting. In the first, an automatic Least Square Matching (LSM) collimation procedure was applied to the image of a calibrated grid (acquired with a DTP scanner at 700 dpi) at different compression ratios, and to the uncompressed grid image.

As the result the brain creates a comfortable visual model of the scene and alarms, in case some distinct disparity in visual perception is found. While observing a scene, the optical axes of both eyes are naturally directed to the same area of the object, which is particularly true for visual perception of stereoscopic images on a computer screen.

After all, a modern reconfiguration of the Pergamon Museum today requires a complete photogrammetric documentation {{as a basis for}} restoration of the Market Gate of Miletus. Due to the complexity of damage, mapping a digital 3 D model of the market gate, generated from high accurate photogrammetric 3 D data (+/- 5 mm), was necessary to understand the relations between damage and stress analysis more exactly. To obtain this high accuracy with sufficient economy, data acquisition had to be made with two different camera systems.

Here, we utilized a very high density airborne laser scanning (ALS) data, with a point density of 140 points m−² for generating a high quality DTM for mapping landslides in forested terrain in the Barcelonnette region, the Southern French Alps. We quantitatively evaluated the preservation of morphological features and qualitatively assessed the visualization of ALS-derived DTMs. We presented a filter parameterization method suitable for landslide mapping and compared it with two default filters from the hierarchical robust interpolation (HRI) and one default filter from the progressive TIN densification (PTD) method.

Dynamic and hyper-medial representations have burst on {{the scene of the}} architectural representation methods - traditionally static -, thanks to the most recent technological developments of computer graphics. Advanced digital media techniques and dynamic representations are establishing as primary emerging modes of architectural representation, using different techniques such as 3 D modelling, animation, compositing, virtual and augmented realities and other digitally based techniques. In Architectural Competitions - {{one of the most significant}} ways to obtain a professional charge - the new trends of digital representation play a central role as method and tool of communication. The need of synthesizing and demonstrating the design thinking in a fixed and limited number of entry specifications is one of the communication peculiarities in Architectural Competitions. Most announcements of International Architectural Ideas Competitions require today, beside written statements and various presentation materials, - like boards, architectural models, photographs -, the production of a fixed length movie for illustrating the design ideas. In this case 3 D digital modelling and animation may represent a powerful tool for increasing evaluation capability by jury members. Architectural movies today are affirming themselves as new method for representing design ideas, offering the chances of exploring the space in continuum, telling a story about the life inside the future buildings and underlining the perceptive effects produced by simulated architectures. The high complexity, not only in creating and animating three-dimensional digital models, but also in compositing and post-producing videos, has to face a separation of jobs and responsibilities between the activities of architectural atelier and the works of rendering and compositing studios. Previous researches, developed by the authors of this abstract, analyzed the meanings of fourth dimension for representing architectural designs (Congress Id&cT 09, Milan 2009) and went deep to the history of digital movies for transmitting design ideas in Architectural Competitions (Congress ARCC 2009, San Antonio - TX 2009).

The slope {{is characterized by a}} remnant marble buttress from previous excavations, approximately 150 m high and varying from 30 to 50 m in width. As quarry slope stability analyses require a detailed knowledge of the rock mass and discontinuity proprieties a terrestrial photogrammetric survey, using an unmanned aerial vehicle, UAV, was carried out in order {{to increase the amount of}} data obtained through engineering-geological mapping. UAV mapping was chosen to overcome problems related to the elevation and steepness of the open pit walls and the limitations that are commonly encountered with traditional aerial and terrestrial photogrammetric techniques. The images were acquired with the UAV in vertical strips and oriented by the use of ground control points in order to derive three different photogrammetric models, one for each side of the buttress. The <b>stereoscopic</b> <b>models</b> were coupled with a high resolution point cloud acquired by ground-based LiDAR scans. Using this methodology also allowed the production of digital high-resolution orthophotos of all sides of the marble buttress. Remote sensing data allowed for characterizing both intact and brittle fractures in terms of attitude, persistence and spacing. This information was used to perform a kinematic stability analysis in order to identify the most probable failure mechanisms. The analysis was combined with GIS spatial processing with to the objective of highlighting the failure zones in relation to the actual morphology. In addition, finite element and distinct element models of the slope were constructed. The 3 D finite element code, RocscienceTM RS 3, was used to investigate the stress distribution in the slope and indicate areas of potential stress-induced damage due to the quarrying activities. The 3 D distinct element code, ItascaTM 3 DEC, was then used to build a discontinuum geomechanical model of the quarry slope. Three different discontinuum approaches were used.

General geomechanical properties of the deforming rock mass has been then evaluated for using in numerical models of the failure mechanism at Blais Creek and to define a broad geomechanical characterization of different portions of the DsGSD. The combination between the aerial and terrestrial photogrammetry was appropriate {{in terms of the}} quality of the information obtained more than the quantitative information. Several Ground Control Points (GCPs) and Tie Points (TPs) were selected from the original DEM received by the BC Government. The use of a multitemporal aerial triangulation gave the possibility to minimize the error relative to every single block of images. Couples of oriented photos were used to create <b>stereoscopic</b> <b>models.</b> Multitemporal variations of the Blais Creek slope were observed and compared to the actual situation of the slope. The use of terrestrial photogrammetry through Adamtech software confirmed some of the qualitative data obtained from aerial interpretation and from field survey. The limited use of terrestrial photogrammetry was due to the impossibility of orienting the 3 D terrestrial models. Anyway these models were also useful to confirm one of the possible mechanisms used to describe the evolution of Blais Creek. Geomechanical analysis was performed through field work and laboratory tests to characterize the entire slope and to produce some of the values useful for a possible numerical analysis of Blais Creek. It showed interesting differences in geomechanical properties between the calc-silicate and quartzite/gneiss. The kinematic analysis showed very the different instability areas along the slope, even if variations in landforms and rock masses volume weren’t widespread along Blais Creek slope during the time span covered by aerial photographs (1973 - 2007). Indeed, the multitemporal analysis outlined very active instability along the large upper trench and the lateral active slopes of Blais Creek. Even without significant level of risks in the area, considering the remote area involved in this instability, some relevant hazards could occur, related to the possible collapse of SE side of Blais Creek DsGSD. Regarding the long term evolution of the DsGSD, the extensive network of linear features at Blais Creek is of a large deforming rock mass. Movement probably began with the retreat of valley glaciers during deglaciation when the oversteepened valley sides were debuttressed. By these evidences it is possible to theorize that the post-glacial retreat of the rock face and removal of the ice buttress from both the Seymour and the Blais Creeek Valleys lowered the factor of stability of the mass as a whole, allowing a deep-seated shear surface to develop gradually over time by progressive creep...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — We {{develop a}} no-reference {{binocular}} image quality assessment model that operates on static <b>stereoscopic</b> images. The <b>model</b> deploys 2 D and 3 D features extracted from stereopairs {{to assess the}} perceptual quality they present when viewed stereo-scopically. Both symmetric- and asymmetric-distorted stereopairs are handled by accounting for binocular rivalry using a classic linear rivalry model. The NSS features are used to train a support vector machine model to predict {{the quality of a}} tested stereopair. The model is tested on the LIVE 3 D Image Quality Data-base, which includes both symmetric- and asymmetric-distorted stereoscopic 3 D images. The experimental results show that our proposed model significantly outperforms the conventional 2 D full-reference QA algorithms applied to stereopairs, as well as the 3 D full-reference IQA algorithms on asymmetrically distorted stereopairs.

40|$|We present ErgoDesk, a {{software}} and hardware framework for interacting at an ActiveDesk, a rear-projected drafting table-sized display. ErgoDesk represents a new interaction paradigm, based on physical props, multimodal input and a stereo-on-demand display surface, that seamlessly supports transitions between a variety 2 D and 3 D interaction techniques. We provide a detailed discussion of the ErgoDesk framework's major features including: the layout of physical props; the transitions between 2 D and 3 D interactions; the use of gestural and spoken input; and the transformation model for converting between real-world and virtual environment coordinates. We also discuss the design of ErgoSketch, a conceptual 3 D modeling application built on the ErgoDesk framework, and our usability experiences with both over the past year.

40|$|Abstract. Hand gesture-based Human Computer Interaction (HCI) {{is one of}} {{the most}} natural and {{intuitive}} methods of communication between humans and machines because it closely mimics how humans interact with each other. Its intuitiveness and naturalness are needed to explore extensive and complex data or virtual realities. We developed a 3 D gesture interface to manipulate the display of a 3 D entity model. For gesture recognition, we use the Kinect as a depth sensor to acquire depth image frames. We track the position of the user’s skeleton in each frame and detect preset gestures. By simple gestures, the user can pan, zoom, rotate, and reset the view and freely navigate inside the 3 D entity model in the virtual space. The proposed gesture interface is integrated with the <b>stereoscopic</b> 3 D <b>model</b> viewer that we have previously developed for 3 D model review...|$|R
40|$|We {{present an}} {{application}} of the <b>stereoscopic</b> self-similar-expansion <b>model</b> (SSSEM) to Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO) /Sun-Earth Connection Coronal and Heliospheric Investigation (SECCHI) observations of the 03 April 2010 CME and its associated shock. The aim is to verify whether CME-driven shock parameters can be inferred from the analysis of j-maps. For this purpose we use the SSSEM to derive the CME and the shock kinematics. Arrival times and speeds, inferred assuming either propagation at constant speed or with uniform deceleration, show good agreement with Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) measurements. The shock standoff distance [Δ], the density compression [ρ_d/ρ_u] and the Mach number [M] are calculated combining the results obtained for the CME and shock kinematics with models for the shock location. Their values are extrapolated to L_ 1 and compared to in-situ data. The in-situ standoff distance is obtained from ACE solar-wind measurements, and the Mach number and compression ratio are provided by the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics interplanetary shock database. They are ρ_d/ρ_u = 2. 84 and M = 2. 2. The best fit to observations is obtained when the SSSEM half width λ = 40 and the CME and shock propagate with uniform deceleration. In this case we find Δ = 23 R_, ρ_d/ρ_u = 2. 61, and M = 2. 93. The study shows that CME-driven shock parameters can be estimated from the analysis of time-elongation plots {{and can be used}} to predict their in-situ values...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: <b>Stereoscopic</b> surface <b>models</b> {{of human}} organs can be {{manipulated}} in real time. Th is is a signifi cant feature of an interactive simulation system used for clinical practice. Objective surface models are obtainable from the accumulation of each structure’s serial outlines, followed by surface reconstruction. The segmented images including the outlines {{can be divided into}} outlined images, white-fi lled images, and color-fi lled images. Th e {{purpose of this study was}} to report the benefi ts of the three types of segmented images for surface reconstruction. For the raw data, sectioned images of a male cadaver head were used. In the sectioned images, 91 structures were delineated for the preparation of 234 serial outlined images. Th e outlined images were converted into white-fi lled and color-fi lled images; the reverse conversion was also possible. Th e outlined images, including the original sectioned images, could be the source not only of surface models but also of volume models. Th e white-fi lled images, with a minimal fi le size, were preferred for separate surface reconstruction of the individual structures. Th e color-fi lled images, which allowed for recognition of the entire outlined structures simultaneously, were regarded as a good choice for the construction of several surface models. For the process, we employed a variety of soft ware packages including those for animation, where the images were compatible. Th is information can be used by other investigators to build their own three...|$|R
