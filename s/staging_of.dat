30|$|<b>Stage</b> <b>of</b> {{lactation}} The {{results revealed}} that <b>stages</b> <b>of</b> lactation {{was found to have}} a significant (p <  0.01) effect on DMY. The significant (P <  0.01) effect <b>of</b> <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> lactation on DMY has also been reported by other studies (Belay et al. 2012). However, Gadmade (1999) have reported non-significant effect <b>of</b> <b>stages</b> <b>of</b> lactation on DMY. It was observed that DMY significantly (p <  0.01) decreased as <b>stages</b> <b>of</b> lactation increased from early to late lactation. The highest milk yield was recorded in 1 st <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> lactation and lowest was in 3 rd <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> lactation. For example, there was a decrease of 2.08 litre/day of DMY from first stage to the third <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> lactation (Table  3). An early on-farm work reports on the same breed observed that daily milk yield significantly (P <  0.01) decreased with <b>stages</b> <b>of</b> lactation (Takele 2005) but the values reported were lower than {{the results of the present}} monitoring study. The comparatively higher values <b>of</b> <b>stages</b> <b>of</b> lactation for first, second and third recorded in the current study than previous reports of 3.3, 2.3 and 1.3 litres for the corresponding <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> lactation, with an overall average of 2.3  L per day might be attributed to the difference in the level of management. This is so because monitoring studies required to capture the full picture of the actual performance under the existing management system and resulted in higher <b>stages</b> <b>of</b> lactation. The difference might also be related to inter-annual natural effect. The result of present study agrees with different workers (Belay et al. 2012) who reported highest DMY in 1 st <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> lactation and lowest DMY in 3 rd <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> lactation.|$|R

30|$|After {{eruption}} in the Carboniferous, the Batamayineishan Formation volcanic reservoir in the Junggar Basin {{formed through}} dissolution, cooling, crystallization, welding {{and some other}} consolidation (approximately 359 – 320  Ma). After {{a short period of}} corrosion by hydrothermal fluids and filling of pores, volcanic rocks in this area had been uplifted and exposed till the Early Triassic (approximately 246  Ma), subject to prolonged weathering and leaching in hypergene environments, which resulted in fragmentation of rocks and secondary dissolution of minerals, and large numbers of weathering fractures and secondary pores formed (Mo and Lian 2010). After that, these formations were covered and buried by sediments. In later <b>stages</b> <b>of</b> burial, the entire region experienced several major tectonic movements, which played constructive roles in volcanic reservoir development. Generally speaking, Carboniferous volcanic rocks in the Junggar Basin experienced no less than two <b>stages</b> <b>of</b> large-scale secondary dissolution, 2 – 3 <b>stages</b> <b>of</b> hydrocarbon-filling events, three <b>stages</b> <b>of</b> fracture formation, one <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> siliceous cementation, two <b>stages</b> <b>of</b> carbonate cementation, two <b>stages</b> <b>of</b> chlorite cementation and three <b>stages</b> <b>of</b> anhydrite/gypsum cementation (Fig.  5 b).|$|R
