40|$|The {{behavior}} of an industrial sludge, arising from fertilizer and feed phosphate production, {{has been found}} to be similar to that of clayey soil. Prior to its use as a construction material for an embankment, the soft sludge has been improved by means of a filter press chamber to reduce the water content and, thereby, to obtain a stiffer material. Filter pressing has yielded relatively stiffer <b>sludge</b> <b>filter</b> cakes with a water content of less than 90 %. Extensive laboratory tests have been conducted in order to characterize the uncertain {{behavior of}} the original sludge and the filter cakes. Under drying and re-wetting cycles, the filter cakes loose their strength after 4 days of rewetting due to the structure damage. Variation of compression state as well as uncertain behavior of the sludge has necessitated greater attention to the deformation of the foundation. Finite element simulations have been performed giving quite reasonable predictions. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} {{the effect of}} {{development}} of sludge bed on the efficiency of Upflow Anaerobic Sludge Blanket (UASB) and Upflow Anaerobic <b>Sludge</b> <b>Filter</b> (UASF) reactors, operating at HRTs 3 to 12 h and sludge age of 30, 60, 90, 0 and 150 days was investigated. The effect of temperature on the granulation of UASB sludge was more pronounced {{as compared to the}} attached microbial growth in the UASF. For UASB reactor, average concentrations of VSS and TS increased steadily up to sludge age of 120 days, beyond which VSS and TS contents decreased significantly due to sludge liquidation. For UASF reactor, average concentration of VSS increased steadily even beyond day 120, whereas average TS content increased from day 30 to day 60 and it decreased after 60 to day 90, mainly attributed to the expansion in the sludge height due to fluidization of the bed. XRD analysis of the UASF sludge showed the presence of expanding clays revealing its additional absorption capability. Fuoraphyllite and Albite precipitation in reaction with Calcium and Phosphate related to excellular polymers of the microbial shell structure, showed the extended growth of microorganisms during sludge granulation in the UASB reactor...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents the}} results of detailed investigation of the possible use of stabilised sludge and brown coal fly ash as raw material ingredients for road construction and manufacture of building bricks. The thesis is organised into seven chapters including a general introduction chapter. A literature review of solid waste management practices employed in Australia and some selected countries are discussed (chapter 1) together with waste generation from power stations. Particular attention is given to industrial waste disposal into Victorian landfills and the current waste management system in the state is compared with international best practices. The sampling program and sample collection methods used in this study are described in chapter 2. The results of the preliminary waste characterisation of treated solid industrial wastes from waste treatment plant, mainly slurry (liquid <b>sludge),</b> <b>filter</b> cake and stabilised sludge are presented in this chapter to provide a "snapshot" of the organic and inorganic composition of the waste materials. It also enabled the identification of key target analytes of concern for further study. The methodologies and analytical instruments employed in the sampling plan and analyses used are also discussed in this chapter. Chapter 3 focuses on elemental, organic and ionic chemical analysis of filter cake and stabilised sludge from industrial waste treatment plant using different analytical techniques. This chapter also contains elemental characterisation of brown coal fly ash from power stations in the Latrobe Valley, Victoria, Australia. The leachability of heavy metals from filter cake and stabilised sludge samples are also presented in this chapter and the identified components that can impact on the potential reuse/recycle of the solids were examined by using different analytical techniques to improve the treatment performance in terms of transfer of contaminants from liquid to solid phases. The principles and applications of XRD, TGA and SEM techniques to the analysis of environmental samples are discussed in chapter 4. XRD and TGA analyses were conducted on filter cake and stabilised sludge from industrial waste treatment plant,whereas SEM analysis were performed on fly ash, mixture of fly ash and stabilised sludge, bricks produced from sludge/fly ash and clay fired at 1000 °C. Characterisation of the waste materials with these techniques revealed that phase, thermal and morphological properties are useful to understand the complex mineral composition and the performance of waste materials for certain end use applications. The suitability of stabilised sludge and brown coal fly ash mixtures as road base and sub-base material (chapter 5) was investigated by measuring index properties, pH and electrical conductivity, compaction, unconfined compression strength, California bearing ratio, triaxial shear stress and permeability tests. This chapter also discussed the physical and mechanical properties of the individual waste streams (sludge and fly ash) as a first step in identifying its potential application for reuse/recycle as raw material ingredient in road construction. The results obtained in this chapter indicate that the addition of fly ash to the stabilised sludge and curing time were the most important factors to improve the physical/mechanical properties of the waste materials. The combination of stabilised sludge and fly ash as raw material ingredients for making building bricks was considered in chapter 6. The characteristics of bricks made from these waste materials in different mixtures were investigated. The successful development of a new process for making bricks is detailed in this chapter and the product is referred to as "Enviro-brick". This process provides an opportunity for reducing the environmental impact of solid industrial wastes from waste treatment plants and power stations. The conclusions and implication for further research are presented in chapter 7...|$|E

To quantify the effects of biosolid aging on Cd and Zn bioavailability, two sewage sludges (Lagoon <b>sludge</b> and <b>Filtered</b> <b>sludge)</b> and a garden compost were incubated at 25 °C and 35 °C for 100 days. Changes in availability of Cd and Zn were determined using isotope dilution principles, with the materials being labelled with carrier-free 109 Cd and 65 Zn. We determined isotopically exchangeable metal pools (E values) and plant available metal pools (L values) by measuring specific activities of Cd and Zn in soil extracts and in wheat plants, respectively. Changes in carbon content over time were determined using 13 C-NMR spectroscopy and chemical extraction methods, and related to changes in availability of metal pools as determined by isotopic procedures. Hot-water-extractable carbon content, assumed to represent easily decomposable organic matter, decreased during the 100 days by 80 – 190 mg kg− 1. The Compost and Lagoon sludge showed no change in L values for Cd or Zn with time, but in the <b>Filtered</b> <b>sludge</b> the L values for Cd and Zn increased significantly, by 43 % and 56 %, respectively.

It was observed that aluminum and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) were operational critical parameters, whose recycling created concentrations above law limits for treated water.

These processes present the very important positive aspect to lead to a correct management for the disposal problem; {{at the same time they}} can represent an useful energy source. From this point of view it is important to consider that, in opposition to the continuously increasing difficulty to generate energy from traditional fossil sources, the possibility to obtain energy from biomass (as for example from the sewage sludge), represents an interesting tool both for the reason that this source is certainly renewable and corresponding to the directives of the Kyoto protocol, and also for economical aspects (in fact the energy that is derived from traditional sources presents an always increasing cost). On the basis of these considerations the aim of the present work is the individuation of the optimal solution (in particular with a thermal treatment approach), for the correct disposal of the sewage sludge deriving from wastewater treatment, with particular reference to a specific large-scale example.

Although many alternate binders have been tested, including organic materials, bentonite still remains the preferred binder. Bentonite has the unique qualities that promote stable green balling conditions and provides acceptable strengths during drying, preheating, and contributes to the fired pellet strength at an acceptable cost. The incentive to consider other binders is based on such factors as improving the metallurgical properties of the pellets, decreasing their silica content, and lower overall costs. The USBM conducted a number of small scale tests using papermill sludge and other additives in place of bentonite as a binder for taconite pellets. Their balling tests indicated that acceptable green-ball strength could be achieved with papermill sludge. The fired pellet evaluations, however, were based on muffle furnace tests which do not accurately predict the fired pellet quality. Although the fired pellet data were also encouraging it was recognized that pot-grate tests were needed to obtain more definitive test data that could be directly related to commercial practice. Subsequently, the USBM recommended that the IRRRB fund an extension of the program to include pot-grate tests to verify the fired pellet quality obtained in the muffle furnace work. A test program was prepared by the Coleraine Research Laboratory of the Natural Resources Research Institute (NRRI) in cooperation with Dr. J. Nigro and Dr. L. Haas, USBM, and Mr. S.

40|$|Formation of {{excessive}} <b>sludge</b> and fuel <b>filter</b> clogging were experienced in using biodiesel blends under marine environment. In this study, a field test {{was conducted in}} a marine ferry boat fueled by canola-based biodiesel blends. The sludge materials collected in the fuel purifier were characterized using inductively coupled plasma (ICP), pyrolysis-GC/MS (Py-GC/MS), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and Karl-Fischer titration. It {{was found that the}} sludge materials consisted of four distinctive fractions: organic materials derived from diesel and canola biodiesel (major fraction), ash (11 - 14 % w/w), water (~ 17 % w/w), and bacteria. The active bacteria were present in the sludge samples. It was suggested that bacterial contamination was one of the major factors in contribution to the sludge formation...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} study, we {{investigate}} the biodegradability of oleic acid by <b>sludge</b> from anaerobic <b>filter</b> reactor fed with olive mill wastewater (sludge T). A comparative {{study was conducted}} using a second sludge from an expanded granular bed reactor exposed to oleic acid (sludge P). The performance of treating oleic acid {{and the influence of}} the composition of the culture media were investigated and compared. Methane production by sludge T started after a lag phase of 150 hours. However no lag phase was observed with sludge P. In contrast a higher methane production was obtained with the sludge T. The addition of nutrients (minerals and yeast extract) to culture medium reduced the lag phase of methane production by 40 hours...|$|R
40|$|The {{treatment}} of the wastewater can be processed by either physical-chemical and or biological methods. Biological methods in turn {{can be divided into}} aerobic and anaerobic. The utilization anything process usually have for objective to remove the organ matter and, the performance is variable depending on the device utilized. The purpose of the present work is to evaluate the treatment wastewater system with primary, secondary and auxiliary treatments. The primary treatment consists of a dispositive that blockade bulky materials and the sand excluder for removing the inert materials. The secondary, responsible for the organic charge elimination is realized by up flow of an anaerobic <b>sludge</b> mantle <b>filter.</b> The auxiliary treatment is a polishing pond. The evaluation was made through the determination of pH, Consumed Oxygen (CO/COD), Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD), COD/BOD relation, alkalinity, volatile fatty acids (VFA), total nitrogen, ammonium, nitrate, total phosphorus, turbidity and settable solids determination. The results showed that the biological process used is appropriate given that the ratio COD / BOD is less than 2. 5, the system was capable of removing organic matter in terms of OC and BOD at the rates of 43. 1 % and 44. 8 % respectively when the concentration of total phosphorus in polishing pond is high, which can cause eutrophication...|$|R
