30|$|Our {{computational}} experiments provide {{insights into}} the effects of AM on supply networks. Increasing the resource efficiency through AM can {{have a significant impact}} on the structure of supply networks. Our experiments confirm in general that production sites will be located closer to the customers. Therefore, the total tonne-kilometres as well as the required tonne-kilometres per customer decrease, which decreases the overall transportation costs. This study supports the findings suggested by Barz et al. [3]. However, Barz et al. [3] used a tiny test data set only, i.e. six handmade test instances. The experiments presented provide a broader foundation which improves the validity and the insights of the results significantly. For this reason, however, we also observed that not all supply networks change in the same way; the intensity of the effects can vary strongly. In order that a supply network benefits from AM it is important that switching production sites is easy, that is, there has to be a high number of possible production sites selectable and the switching costs have to be low enough. The observed effects result from a comparison of production processes with a high resource efficiency versus processes with a low resource efficiency. The next stage would be to also model transition effects which arise from switching from <b>subtractive</b> to additive <b>manufacturing,</b> e.g. higher costs for machinery or slower time of production or maybe even changes in the production programme or the customer demand. Of course, supply networks with a more generalized network structure than our used two-stage network should also be investigated in the future.|$|R

40|$|Additive manufacturing, {{commonly}} known as 3 D Printing, is a production method of rising popularity. The method works by adding layers of material, in contrast to subtracting, which is the dominating method today. The objective of this thesis has been to evaluate the cost-efficiency of producing relatively complex parts through additive <b>manufacturing,</b> compared to <b>subtractive</b> methods with production volumes less than 20 units. Initial findings narrow the additive methods down from seven, to two methods (Selective Laser Sintering/Melting and Fused Filament Fabrication) which are found best fit for end use parts. Data is gathered by acquiring price quotes from manufacturing companies for two plastic and two aluminium parts, through subtractive and additive methods. In order to look for intersections found at intermediate production volumes, the companies were asked to give price for 1, 5 and 20 units of the same item. Compared to <b>subtractive</b> methods, additive <b>manufacturing</b> processes are found to exhibit less cost-decrease per additional unit produced. The cost of producing a 150 gram plastic part through the additive process {{was found to be}} between a quarter, and half the cost of the subtractive machining processes. In comparison, for a 15 gram part, additive manufacturing was found to be even more cost-efficient, with prices ranging between 10 % and 20 % of the alternative. The metal additive manufacturing process was found to be 15 % cheaper than the subtractive at producing one single small part (100 gram), whereas in contrast, it was 50 % more expensive when producing 20 units. For manufacturing larger parts (500 gram), it was found to be between 75 and 150 % more expensive than the subtractive machining.

40|$|This {{research}} {{presents a}} <b>subtractive</b> rapid <b>manufacturing</b> process for heterogeneous materials, in particular for custom shaped bone implants. Natural bone implants {{are widely used}} {{in the treatment of}} severe fractures or in tumor removal. In order for the human body to accept the bone implant material and heal properly, it is essential that the bone implant should be both mechanically and biologically compatible. Currently, the challenge of having correctly shaped natural bone implants created from an appropriate material is met through hand-shaping done by a surgeon. CNC-RP is a rapid machining method and software that can realize a fully automated Subtractive Rapid Prototyping (RP) process, using a 3 -axis milling machine with a 4 th axis indexer for multiple setup orientations. It is capable of creating accurate bone implants from different clinically relevant material including natural bone. However, there are major challenges that need to be overcome in order to implement automated shape machining of natural bones. They are summarized as follows: (1) Unlike homogeneous source materials for which a part can be machined from any arbitrary location within the original stock, for the case of donor bones, the site and orientation of implant harvest need to consider the nature of the heterogeneous internal bony architecture. (2) For the engineered materials, the source machining stock is in the convenient form of geometrically regular shapes such as cylinders or rectangular blocks and the entities of sacrificial supports can connect the part to the remaining stock material. However, irregularly-shaped bones and the heterogeneity of bone make the design of a fixture system for machining much more complicated. In this dissertation, two major areas of research are presented to overcome these challenges and enable automated process planning for a new rapid manufacturing technique for natural bone implants. Firstly, a new method for representing heterogeneous materials using nested STL shells is proposed. The nested shells model is called the Matryoshka mode, based in particular on the density distribution of human bone. The Matryoshka model is generated via an iterative process of thresholding the Hounsfield Unit (HU) data from a computed tomography (CT) scan, thereby delineating regions of progressively increasing bone density. Then a harvesting algorithm is developed to determine a suitable location to generate the bone implant from within the donor bone is presented. In this harvesting algorithm, a density score and similarity score are calculated to evaluate the overall effectiveness of that harvest site. In the second research area, an automated fixturing system is proposed for securing the bone implant during the machining process. The proposed method uses a variant of sacrificial supports (stainless surgical screws) to drill into appropriate locations and orientations through the free-form shaped donor bone, terminating at proper locations inside the solid part model of the implant. This automated fixturing system has been applied to machine several bone implants from surrogate bones to 3 D printed Matryoshka models. Finally, the algorithms that are developed for setup planning are implemented in a CAD/CAM software add-on called 2 ̆ 2 CNC-RPbio 2 ̆ 2. The results of this research could lead to a clinically relevant rapid machining process for custom shaped bone implants, which could create unique implants {{at the touch of a}} button. The implication of such high accuracy implants is that patients could benefit from more accurate reconstructions of trauma sites, with better fixation stability; leading to potentially shorter surgeries, less revisions, shorter recovery times and less likelihood of post-traumatic osteoarthritis, to name a few...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} deal with global competition, {{industries}} have undertaken many efforts directed to improve manufacturing efficiency. From a broad perspective, the adopted approaches could be classified in two categories: 1. the simplification of manufacturing processes and relative control systems, leading to lean manufacturing methododologies and techniques; 2. the massive deployment of information tools and computational algorithms, aiming to plan and control all the activities in detail, in spite of system complexity. For several years, these two approaches have been assumed to be mutually exclusive; nevertheless, information collection and analysis are mandatory to define improvement strategies and assess their impact; therefore, the deployment of lean manufacturing methodologies cannot exclude the integration of Information Technology (IT) tools. The aim of this work is to investigate on methodologies and techniques adoptable to improve the efficacy of Manufacturing Execution Systems (MES), a class of software that allows data exchange between the shop-floor and the organizational levels, enabling the implementation of the lean manufacturing approach. Today, the feedback information in the available MES mainly consists in key performance indicators, such as cycle time, work in process and resources utilization. Beside this, MES requires the integration of functionalities for process monitoring and control, aiming at the reduction of wastes and supporting continuous improvement. Hence, mathematical techniques able to analyze data in real-time and provide useful information to adaptively control the process are studied in this work. To provide the evidence of the feasibility and effectiveness of the approach, as well as the independence from any specific manufacturing technology, different case studies, both in the fields of <b>subtractive</b> and additive <b>manufacturing,</b> have been developed. In the former, a technique for the automatic alignment of a spur gear has been studied: geometrical measurements are acquired and analyzed in real-time to provide the values for two feasible part rotations resulting in the gear configuration with minimum positioning error. Such gears are manufactured for applications in aeronautics, and the deployment of this automation system is particularly significant because of the tight tolerances to be satisfied. The latter case study deals with a Fused Deposition Modeling process: an algorithm able to monitor part surface accuracy and identify defects has been developed. This methodology allows to evaluate in real-time whether the quality of the part is satisfactory or not; in case of negative response, the process can be stopped avoiding material loss. The implemented techniques enable product quality improvement, as well as the reduction of wasted material and time. Nevertheless, the deployment of such information only for process control purposes is restrictive; a framework to use this knowledge for supporting the design and the continuous improvement of a product or a process is presented. Furthermore, two case studies have been dealt to extend the application of MES tools from manufacturing operations to ancillary services. The first one is in the field of automated warehouses: a combined approach made of mathematical models and simulations has been developed. Analytical tools have been defined to evaluate the average performance of a system in simple, pre-determined situations; conversely, the simulation tool aims at a higher detail level of assessment, since in the real shop-floor deployment, different, composite storage and retrieval activities can take place.

AM offers advantages of more freedom in design, lower buy-to-fly ratio and shorter lead times. Selective electron beam melting (SEBM) is a powder-bed-fusion-based AM process, developed by Arcam AB in Sweden in 2002, which offers high energy efficiency and power density, rapid scan speed and unique capability of manufacturing high reactive metals such as titanium (Ti) due to the vacuum build chamber involved. Although much research has been devoted to the SEBM of Ti alloys, particularly Ti- 6 Al- 4 V, current understanding of the mechanical performance of SEBM-fabricated Ti components is still limited in a number of aspects. This thesis aims at enhancing the current understanding of the AM process of Ti and Ti alloys by SEBM in the following four aspects. 1. Manipulation and characterization of a novel Ti powder precursor for SEBM applications A low-cost novel Ti powder precursor (sponge Ti particles) has been manipulated using a proprietary powder manipulation technology (PMT) in order to produce a low-cost, nearly spherical Ti powder for SEBM applications. Research has shown that the PMT is capable of producing more than 50 wt. % of nearly spherical Ti powder in the size range of 45 &ndash; 106 &mu;m (usable for SEBM) and about 30 wt. % of less than 45 &mu;m of nearly spherical powder (usable for AM by cold spray processes). PMT-processed Ti powder with a size range of 75 &ndash; 106 &mu;m exhibited similar flowability and spreadability to those of recycled Arcam Ti- 6 Al- 4 V powder when assessed in an external Arcam powder bed evaluation system. Cubic samples were built with the PMT-processed Ti powder using an Arcam A 1 SEBM system under different SEBM parameters. The resulting density, surface conditions and microstructures of the as-built samples were investigated. It was concluded that through appropriate modification of the SEBM parameters in conjunction with the use of suitable melt strategies, it is feasible to produce quality samples with the newly developed low-cost nearly spherical Ti powder. This research demonstrates the potential of developing low-cost feedstock powder for AM by SEBM. 2. Positional dependence of microstructure and tensile properties of a thick Ti- 6 Al- 4 V block additively manufactured by SEBM Limited information exists in the open literature about the microstructure and mechanical properties of SEBM-fabricated thick-section (&ge; 25. 4 mm) Ti- 6 Al- 4 V samples or parts, while thick sections are involved in many components for structural applications. A systematic study has been made of the positional dependence of the microstructure and tensile properties of a 34 mm-thick Ti- 6 Al- 4 V block additively manufactured by SEBM. Marginally graded microstructures were observed along the build direction and from the side surface to the centre. Abnormally coarse &alpha; laths, thick and tortuous grain boundary &alpha; phase, and massive &alpha; phase transformation products were observed. To assess the tensile properties, a total of 27 tensile samples were prepared from nine different heights of the block sample, and all samples satisfied the minimum requirements for mill-annealed Ti- 6 Al- 4 V, irrespective of their positions in the thick block. This conclusion demonstrates the capabilities of SEBM in producing quality thick-section Ti- 6 Al- 4 V components. A range of other revealing observations were documented and discussed. 3. The influence of as-built surface conditions and hot isostatic pressing (HIP) on tensile and fatigue properties of SEBM Ti- 6 Al- 4 V Achieving a high surface finish is a major challenge for most current metal AM processes. A quantitative study has been made of the influence of as-built surface conditions on the tensile and fatigue properties of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V produced by SEBM as compared to acid-etched and machined conditions. The experimental results indicate that chemical etching can double tensile elongation and noticeably improve tensile strengths due to improved surface finish. However, the fatigue strength remained to be much inferior to that of mill-annealed Ti- 6 Al- 4 V due to residual surface defects. Consequently, it remains challenging to modify the as-built surfaces of SEBM-fabricated components for fatigue-critical structural applications, particularly for those components which contain deep and narrow internal channels and complex concave and convex surfaces. HIP was employed to enhance the fatigue properties of SEBM-fabricated Ti- 6 Al- 4 V. Samples with different surface conditions (as-built, etched, machined and insufficiently machined) were subjected to HIP and their fatigue properties were evaluated under uniaxial tensile loading conditions. Although HIP can effectively improve the fatigue performance by healing most internal defects (i. e. pores and lack-of-fusion defects), it was found that surface defects played a more decisive role than internal defects in determining the fatigue properties of HIP-processed SEBM Ti- 6 Al- 4 V samples. It is expected that the fatigue properties of additively manufactured Ti- 6 Al- 4 V {{will continue to be a}} subject of considerable research in the near future. 4. The electrochemical responses of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V alloy manufactured by seven different processes including SEBM in Hank&rsquo;s solution at 37 oC Considering the increasing applications of additively manufactured Ti- 6 Al- 4 V implants, an in-depth understanding of the bio-corrosion performance of additively manufactured Ti- 6 Al- 4 V is necessary. For this reasons, samples of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V were manufactured by seven different processes, including SEBM, SEBM + HIP, selective laser beam melting (SLM), SLM + HIP, casting, mill-annealing, and spark plasma sintering (SPS). A comparative study was then made of the corrosion characteristics of these samples via the potentiodynamic polarization tests in Hank&rsquo;s solution at 37 oC. The microstructural features of each group of samples were characterized prior to corrosion. The corroded surfaces including the corrosion products were analysed. Owing to different microstructures, Ti- 6 Al- 4 V samples manufactured by different processes showed distinctly different polarization responses. The order of corrosion resistance was found to be: SLM &gt; mill-annealed &gt; SLM + HIP &gt; SEBM &gt; SEBM + HIP Cast SPS. The point defect model was used to interpret the different corrosion responses. The findings of this research provide a different perspective for the selection of manufacturing process for Ti- 6 Al- 4 V for bone implant applications...|$|R
40|$|Bicycle helmets {{can provide}} {{valuable}} protective effects to the wearer&rsquo;s {{head in the}} event of a crash. However, the level of protection that helmets offer varies greatly between the users for similar impacts. Although these discrepancies can be due to many causes, several researchers highlighted the poor fit of helmets experienced by some users as a possible explanation. Poor helmet fit may be attributed to two main causes. First, the helmet could be worn incorrectly, with the helmet either worn back to front, or tilted forward or backward. The chin strap could also be unfastened. Second, helmet sizes and shapes available to the public might not be suitable for the full range of head morphologies observed in the population. Indeed, for some users, there could either be a large gap and/or pressure points between the inner surfaces of the helmet and the head, or a low coverage of the skull area with significant unprotected regions of the head. While the poorly informed usage of bicycle helmets is partly rectifiable through education programs, the mismatch between the head and the helmet&rsquo;s inside surfaces primarily relates to the conventional design method and manufacturing techniques used in the industry today. In addition to the safety concerns described above, poorly fitted helmets can cause significant discomfort and may lead people to cycle infrequently or even not cycle altogether. Such a reaction could be somewhat detrimental to the user since the health benefits of regular cycling are significant. Some organisations and institutions even believe that the risks involved in cycling without a helmet (in not-extreme practices such as mountain biking) might be outweighed by the health benefits of consistent physical workout that the activity procures. However, this is impractical in countries such as Australia where mandatory helmet laws (MHL) are in place. Improper helmet fit coupled with MHL might be the reason why Australians cycle less than formerly, despite many initiatives undertaken by the government to grow the activity. In summary, current commercially available bicycle helmets suffer from the lack of fit accuracy, are uncomfortable, and consequently can discourage riding activities in the community, especially in populations like Australia where MHL exist. Therefore, the main purpose of this research has been to develop an innovative method to produce bicycle helmet models that provide a highly accurate fit to the wearer&rsquo;s head. To achieve this goal, a mass customisation (MC) framework was initiated. MC systems enable the association of the small unit costs of mass production with the compliance of individual customisation. Although MC is defined as the use of both computer-aided design and manufacturing systems to produce custom output, it was decided to focus exclusively, in this study, on the design part of the MC framework of bicycle helmets. More specifically, I tried to answer the following central research question: How can one automatically create commercially ready, custom-fit digital 3 D models of bicycle helmets based on 3 D anthropometric data? One objective was to create certified design models, since helmets must comply with relevant safety regulations to be sold in a country. Safety standards generally determine the amount of energy a helmet must absorb during a crash, which mostly affects the thickness of its foam liner. Since customisation plays a major role in the helmet liner&rsquo;s thickness, special considerations on how the automatic process should affect the helmet&rsquo;s shape were provided. Contrary to conventional helmet production techniques, this method was based on state of the art technologies and techniques, such as three-dimensional (3 D) anthropometry, supervised and unsupervised machine-learning methods, and fully parametric design models. Indeed, until today, traditional 1 D anthropometric data (e. g., head circumference, head length, and head breath) have been the primary sources of information used by ergonomists for the design of user-centred products such as helmets. Although these data are simple to use and understand, they only provide univariate measures of key dimensions, and these tend to only partially represent the actual shape characteristics of the head. However, 3 D anthropometric data can capture the full shape of a scanned surface, thereby providing meaningful information for the design of properly fitted headgear. However, the interpretation of these data can be complicated due to the abundance of information they contain (i. e., a 3 D head scan can contain up to several million data points). In recent years, the use of 3 D measurements for product design has become more appealing thanks to the advances in mesh parameterization, multivariate analyses, and clustering algorithms. Such analyses and algorithms have been adopted in this project. To the author&rsquo;s knowledge, this is the first time that these methods have been applied to the design of helmets within a mass customisation framework. As a result, a novel method has been developed to automatically create a complete, certified custom-fit 3 D model of a bicycle helmet based on the 3 D head scan of a specific individual. Even though the manufacturing of the generated customised helmets is not discussed in detail in this research, it is envisaged that the models could be fabricated using either advanced <b>subtractive</b> and additive <b>manufacturing</b> technologies (e. g., numerical control machining and 3 D printing.), standard moulding techniques, or a combination of both. The proposed design framework was demonstrated using a case study where customised helmet models were created for Australian cyclists. The computed models were evaluated and validated using objective (digital models) fit assessments. Thus, a significant improvement in terms of fit accuracy was observed compared to commercially available helmet models. More specifically, a set of new techniques and algorithms were developed, which successively: (i) clean, repair, and transform a digitized head scan to a registered state; (ii) compare it to the population of interest and categorize it into a predefined group; and (iii) modify the group&rsquo;s generic helmet 3 D model to precisely follow the head shape considered. To successfully implement the described steps, a 3 D anthropometric database comprising 222 Australian cyclists was first established using a cutting edge handheld white light 3 D scanner. Subsequently, a clustering algorithm, called 3 D-HEAD-CLUSTERING, was introduced to categorize individuals with similar head shapes into groups. The algorithm successfully classified 95 % of the sample into four groups. A new supervised learning method was then developed to classify new customers into one of the four computed groups. It was named the 3 D-HEAD-CLASSIFIER. Generic 3 D helmet models were then generated for each of the computed groups using the minimum, maximum, and mean shapes of all the participants classified inside a group. The generic models were designed specifically to comply with the relevant safety standard when accounting for all the possible head shape variations within a group. Furthermore, a novel quantitative method that investigates the fit accuracy of helmets was presented. The creation of the new method was deemed necessary, since the scarce computational methods available in the literature for fit assessment of user-centred products were inadequate for the complex shapes of today&rsquo;s modern bicycle helmets. The HELMET-FIT-INDEX (HFI) was thus introduced, providing a fit score ranging on a scale from 0 (excessively poor fit) to 100 (perfect fit) for a specific helmet and a specific individual. In-depth analysis of three commercially available helmets and 125 participants demonstrated a consistent correlation between subjective assessment of helmet fit and the index. The HFI provided a detailed understanding of helmet efficiency regarding fit. For example, it was shown that females and Asians experience lower helmet fit accuracy than males and Caucasians, respectively. The index was used during the MC design process to validate the high fit accuracy of the generated customised helmet models. As far as the author is aware, HFI is the first method to successfully demonstrate an ability to evaluate users&rsquo; feelings regarding fit using computational analysis. The user-centred framework presented in this work for the customisation of bicycle helmet models is proved to be a valuable alternative to the current standard design processes. With the new approach presented in this research study, the fit accuracy of bicycle helmets is optimised, improving both the comfort and the safety characteristics of the headgear. Notwithstanding the fact that the method is easily adjustable to other helmet types (e. g., motorcycle, rock climbing, football, military, and construction), the author believes that the development of similar MC frameworks for user-centred products such as shoes, glasses and gloves could be adapted effortlessly. Future work should first emphasise the fabrication side of the proposed MC system and describe how customised helmet models can be accommodated in a global supply chain model. Other research projects could focus on adjusting the proposed customisation framework to other user-centred products...|$|R
40|$|International audienceRecently, the {{combination}} of additive and <b>subtractive</b> <b>manufacturing</b> technologies is gaining significant attention from both the industrial and academic sectors. Due to consolidated advantages of individual techniques, this combination provides the capability of producing innovative products, and opens new perspectives for developing new remanufacturing/manufacturing strategies. In this paper, an innovative strategy is proposed. The strategy aims to manufacture a new part directly from an EoL part (or existing part), using a sequence of additive and <b>subtractive</b> <b>manufacturing</b> processes. The existing part is transformed into the new part without involving the material recycling phase. This paper particularly focuses on the environmental assessment of the proposed strategy. For this purpose, a methodology based on the life cycle assessment method is developed. The environmental trade-offs between the proposed strategy and the conventional strategy are also discussed through the case study. The conventional strategy uses conventional processes (such as material recycling, casting and machining) to manufacture the new part, whereas the proposed strategy is based on combining electron beam melting (EBM) and CNC machining processes. The {{results show that the}} proposed strategy becomes more environmentally friendly when the material volume of existing part reused increases more than 60 %. The proposed methodology can help designers and manufacturers to select the most suitable strategy to manufacture new parts from existing parts with minimum environmental impacts...|$|E
