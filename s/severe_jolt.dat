25|$|By midnight all was quiet, but {{the ship}} was still labouring to rejoin {{the main part of}} the convoy. Steaming on slowly, Saturday turned into Sunday. Sunday 26 October would be a day that the crew of the English Trader would never forget. Between 1 am and 1.30 am, {{the ship was}} {{struggling}} against a strong ebbing tide, which in turn forced her dangerously close to the sandbanks of Hammond Knoll. At around 1.45 am the crew felt a slight jolt followed by a more <b>severe</b> <b>jolt.</b> This flung the ship forward followed by loud grinding, crunching and scraping of metal. Then there was silence. The ship had run aground on Hammond Knoll.|$|E
60|$|More barren country, {{more bad}} weather, and {{especially}} an exceedingly rough road reduced Carley to her former state of dejection. The jolting over roots and rocks and ruts {{was worse than}} uncomfortable. She had {{to hold on to}} the seat to keep from being thrown out. The horses did not appreciably change their gait for rough sections of the road. Then a more <b>severe</b> <b>jolt</b> brought Carley's knee in violent contact with an iron bolt on the forward seat, and it hurt her so acutely that she had to bite her lips to keep from screaming. A smoother stretch of road did not come any too soon for her.|$|E

50|$|The same decade, Romas {{conducted}} the kite experiment that Benjamin Franklin proposed in 1750 {{in a letter}} to Peter Collinson, but that had not yet reached France. Raising a wire-wrapped kite in a thunderstorm, Romas proved the electrical nature of lightning. During his experiment, he noticed ten feet long sparks and explosions. He also reported that during a repeat performance in front of a larger audience, he received <b>severe</b> <b>jolts</b> that were more intense than all he received before during experiments with Leyden jars. For this reason, he performed later experiments only with separately grounded conductors and kites that he handled via glass rods.|$|R

50|$|The spare {{driving trailer}} second open (DTSO) number 76331 was {{equipped}} with an 'updated' interior - the seats were replaced with Inter-City style individual bucket seats (as used in the contemporary Mk2A/B/C carriages) and fluorescent lighting to match. This modified car was then placed into unit 417 from the early 1970s, and the displaced 76302 was kept spare at Bournemouth Traction Maintenance Depot.No general refurbishment was ever undertaken on the units (see below regarding the work undertaken on 76327) {{and most of them}} ran with their original incandescent lighting until withdrawal. A feature of a journey in a 2x4TC/4REP train with the 4REP pushing, was <b>severe</b> <b>jolting</b> at station restarts; this upset many a hot drink over the years. This was particularly prevalent at stations on a descending gradient such as New Milton in the down direction. There would be sometimes several jolts of varying intensity until the couplings were fully compressed.The Units were fitted with a motor-generator set for lighting supply and a single compressor; these drew power from the REP or loco through the ETH jumpers.|$|R
50|$|In 1921 the Galeries Lafayette in Regent Street {{was thought}} a {{spectacular}} triumph for the firm, and other {{work was done}} {{in connection with the}} controversial rebuilding of that prestigious shopping street. In 1926 the Peterborough temporary building was rebuilt and branches were opened in Leeds and Glasgow. Belfast eventually had a branch too. But the Great Depression of 1929 onwards, which spread rapidly around the world, caused a <b>severe</b> <b>jolt</b> to the firm. The Argentina operation, already suffering from a strike in which the local director was stabbed in the back, was particularly badly hit. Sage's were so affected by the depression that they made losses for four years running and did not pay a dividend again until 1936.|$|E
50|$|No {{definite}} {{information is}} available on the precise geographical area of the Kamboja-Pala kingdom of Bengal. According to Irda Copper plate evidence, the Kamboja-Pala kingdom definitely comprised Varadhmana-Bhukti Mandala (modern Burdman division) and Dandabhukti Mandala within the Kamboja empire. The Dandabhukti division is believed to have comprised southern and south-western parts of district Midnapore as well as the lower parts of river Suvaranrekha in district Balasore. Evidence from Dinajpore Pillar Inscription attests that the Gauda country also formed parts of Kamboja-Pala kingdom. But as long as we do not include northern Ladha (Radha or W. Bengal) in Kamboja-Pala empire, the region does not constitute one viable political entity. Hence it appears likely that northern parts of Radha may also formed parts of Kamboja-Pala kingdom. Dr R. C. Majumdar says that Gauda and Radha both formed parts of Kamboja-Pala empire During second half of the 10th century, the Chandela ruler Yashovarman invaded the Pala kingdom. Vakpati, a courtier-poet, claims that he conquered Gauda and Mithila. It is also stated that Chandela chief Dhanga of Jejabhukti, the successor of Yashovarman, had invaded Radha {{towards the end of the}} 10th century. As a consequence, the Kamboja power in the north Bengal received a <b>severe</b> <b>jolt.</b> This political scenario enabled the Pala king Mahipala I to re-conquer Gauda from the Kambojas. The last king of the Kambojas was Dharamapala who continued to rule Dandabhukti in the first quarter of the 11th century. The Kamboja ruler Dharamapala of Dandabhukti was defeated by the south Indian Emperor Rajendra Chola I who invaded Bengal and Bihar in the 11th century. The Capital of the Kamboja Pala kingdom is stated to be Pryangu which has not been identified yet, though some scholars tend to identify the same with an old village known as Pingvani located in Garvet Thana.|$|E
50|$|Agni (Saikumar) and Vijay (Rockline Venkatesh) are {{the loyal}} cops. They face stiff {{opposition}} from Godmother Kempamma (Sana) in their objective {{of a crime}} free city. Kempamma who {{can make or break}} (in Judiciary and Politics) faces <b>severe</b> <b>jolt</b> when her son is gunned down by Agni and Vijay for rape and murder of call center girl. To bring in bad name to police power Kempamma unite the two underworld dons on a promise that they get prime positions. Agni does not lose his courage even though his colleagues in the department turn in favor of Kempamma. He has the support of sincere chief minister (played by Saikumar's father). In his killing spree of anti social elements that is also reply to Kempamma, Agni becomes a nightmare. At this time the political moves changes the seat of power. A criminal who is a right hand of Kempamma becomes the chief minister. Agni is at the receiving end. In the blood boiling situation, Agni uses his intelligence and kills one of the two dons in the residence of Chief Minister in the pretext of security reasons. The CM who is also a don is confused about Agni's moves. To finish off the power of Agni another old rival Black Tiger (played by Shobaraj) arrives. The emergence of Black Tiger is shocking not only for Agni but for the entire Police Department. This black tiger was sentenced for capital punishment in the last scene of part one of the 'Police Story'. He has escaped the gallows corrupting the government officials what leads to dangerous situation. Agni is on a hunt again. In the case of Black Tiger slipping away from gallows he finds three government officials interlinked in this case. When he finds all the three and brings them to a safe place to produce to the court all of them are killed by Black Tiger in an encounter. In the custody of Agni three government officials gunned down is the black spot in his life. Agni loses his trusted colleague Vijay at this stage and he becomes alone. Now he has very tough opponents for him. Like a wounded tiger Agni wages a lone battle. Black Tiger setting bombs in various places escapes to Hongkong. In one of the bomb blasts Agni loses his mother too. He chases Black Tiger in Hongkong and it is as expected.|$|E
50|$|On June 29, 1925, a <b>severe</b> {{earthquake}} <b>jolted</b> {{the area}} and the aging lighthouse was unable to stand against it. It was 6:45 a.m. and keeper Weeks was asleep at the time. Suddenly and rudely awakened, he rushed from the dwelling, then hurried back inside to rescue his mother, sister, and brother. When the cloud of dust had settled, little {{was left of the}} old structure. A temporary frame tower was erected until a new lighthouse could be built.|$|R
30|$|During the mid- 18 th century, {{the area}} as a {{waterfowl}} and duck shooting reserve for the then rulers of Bharatpur and their regal guests, was also meeting two direct resource requirements of the local villages: i) fodder and grazing ground for livestock, and ii) fuel wood. Albeit the rulers of Bharatpur assigned the ownership of the area to the government in 1971, {{the rights of the}} locals for grazing livestock and collection of fodder and fuel wood was retained until 1982. The abrupt ban on grazing and collection of fuel wood, upon upgrading the area from a wildlife sanctuary (Bharatpur Bird Sanctuary) to a national park (KNP), where no human activity including removal of forest produce or grazing is allowed as per the Wildlife Protection Act – 1972, gave a <b>severe</b> <b>jolt</b> to the villagers mostly engaged in livestock rearing and agriculture, and evoked intense protests and distress. The immediate result was some clashes between the local community, farmers and the Government. Habituated to sourcing fuel wood, thatch grasses, and fodder free of cost for generations, the ban forced the villagers to procure these from markets at a price, a mechanism they were not extensively accustomed to earlier. Most of the villages, essentially agrarian, agriculture and livestock being their prime source of livelihood (Azeez et al. 1992), had intricate linkages of traditions, castes and Societal segments. The ban on the direct use of the KNP by the villagers was imposed under the then prevailing view on wetland ecosystem dynamics (Vijayan, 1991). It resulted in an immediate impact on the local economy in terms of direct usage of natural resources, occupations and income, and in subsequent years its ecology. The ban on direct usage of the natural resources and souring raw materials inevitable for their traditional livelihood from the park led to vehement protest from the locals. Its ecological setting visibly changed with formation of a thick mat of wetland grass mainly Paspalam distichum (Shukla, 1998) and other hydrophytes, enormous accumulation of detritus, invasion by terrestrial weeds and consequent decline in water birds coming to the park for wintering. The expansive growth of emergent macrophytes created a situation where open-water area with submerged hydrophytes essential for many the migratory waterfowl are evidently reduced.|$|E
