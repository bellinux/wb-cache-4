50|$|Foam {{products}} and rubber products, including rubber <b>slab</b> <b>stock,</b> are manufactured in Clarksville, Tennessee at the Rubber Division's 272,000 square foot (25,000 m²) plant. This facility was built and formerly operated by B. F. Goodrich Corporation. Vulcan corporation makes products for suppliers to shoe companies, aeronautical industries, the automotive industry, {{and various other}} companies.|$|E
50|$|Due to {{the variety}} in {{polyurethane}} chemistries, {{it is difficult}} to recycle foam materials using a single method. Reusing <b>slab</b> <b>stock</b> foams for carpet backing is how the majority of recycling is done. This method involves shredding the scrap and bonding the small flakes together to form sheets. Other methods involve breaking the foam down into granules and dispersing them into a polyol blend to be molded into the same part as the original. The recycling process is still ever developing for foam rubber and the future will hopefully unveil new and easier ways for recycling.|$|E
5000|$|Design {{and build}} a {{complete}} rifle, shotgun, or combination gun from start to finish. (Combination guns, usually {{referred to as a}} [...] "Drilling", is a highly complex hand-made long gun with several joined barrels combining both rifle and shotgun calibers and gauges sharing a common breech and buttstock.) The highest level examples of custom-made firearms usually start out as several pieces of blank steel stock or rough forged parts, a <b>slab</b> (<b>stock</b> blank) of walnut; steel tubes with rifled or smooth holes ("bores") drilled their length, and are usually hand made by highly skilled gunsmiths using nothing more than an occasional lathe, milling machine, heat treating furnace (for making springs, hardening parts to the proper hardness, and color case hardening) with the majority of roughing, fitting, and finishing done completely by hand using files, scrapers, abrasive paper and cloth, chisels and rasps.|$|E
40|$|Stricter {{legislation}} forces growers {{to decrease}} discharge {{of water with}} nitrogen, phosphate and plant protection products. A demonstration was set-up to compare emission free cultivation with a traditional growing method. Goal was to achieve a comparable yield and quality. Essential differences were disinfection of rainwater, ring pipes for drip irrigation, no discharge of first drain in cultivation, a filter without rinsing and weekly analysis of the nutrient solution. It appeared that production and quality were similar as were other climate parameters. Water use was higher in emission free crop, discharge was 4 % in traditional crop realizing 152 kg N discharge per ha per year, which {{was more than the}} allowed 133 kg. Specific end cultivation strategy is useful to decrease nitrogen and phosphate stored in <b>slabs</b> and <b>stock</b> containers...|$|R
40|$|Many {{mechanical}} designs demand components produced to a near {{net shape}} condition to minimize subsequent process steps. Rough machining from <b>slab</b> or bar <b>stock</b> can quickly and economically produce simple prismatic or cylindrical shapes. More complex shapes {{can be produced}} by laser engineered net shaping (LENS), casting, or forging. But for components that require great strength in mission critical applications, forging {{may be the best}} or even the only option. However, designers of these parts may and often do lack the detailed forging process knowledge necessary to understand the impact of process details such as grain flow or parting line placement on both the forging process and the characteristics of the forged part. Economics and scheduling requirements must also be considered. Sometimes the only viable answer to a difficult problem is to re-design the assembly to reduce loading and enable use of other alternatives...|$|R
6000|$|The artistic cowardice of the English {{is perhaps}} the clue to the mystery. Your Englishman is always afraid to commit himself to {{criticism}} without the refuge of a tu quoque. He is covered dead, just as he is covered living, with the [...] "correct thing." [...] A respectable stock-in-trade is proffered him by the insinuating shopman, to whom it is our custom to go. He is told this is selling well, or that is much admired. Heaven defend that he should admire on his own account! He orders the stock urn or the <b>stock</b> <b>slab</b> because it is large and sufficiently expensive for his means and sorrow, and because he knows of nothing better. So we mourn as the stonemason decrees, or after the example and pattern of the Smiths next door. But some day it will dawn upon us that a little thought and a search after beauty are far more becoming than an order and a cheque to the nearest advertising tradesman. Or it may be we shall conclude that the anonymous peace of a grassy mould is better than his commercial brutalities, and {{so there will be}} an end of him.|$|R
40|$|Trace boron {{additions}} to titanium alloys produce {{an order of}} magnitude reduction in as-cast grain size, leading to the possibility of significant simplification of ingot breakdown and thermomechanical processing procedures. In this study, the boron modified titanium alloy Ti– 6 Al– 4 V + 0. 1 B (wt. %) was hot rolled from the cast + HIP condition to thickness reductions of 50 % and 75 % in multi-step rolling sequences. Baseline alloys (without boron) in the cast and wrought (mill product) states were also processed under identical conditions for comparison. After 50 % reduction in thickness at 750 – 950 °C (1382 – 1742 °F), the deformation behavior of cast Ti– 6 Al– 4 V + 0. 1 B is not noticeably different from that of standard Ti– 6 Al– 4 V mill product, whereas cast Ti– 6 Al– 4 V without boron exhibited extensive cracking. The boron-containing alloy could be deformed further to 75 % reduction in thickness at 950 °C (1742 °F) without producing any macroscopic defects. The alpha phase shows a tendency to globularize during heat treatment after a 50 % reduction in thickness to produce an equiaxed microstructure. The potential, therefore, exists for the production of <b>slab</b> and sheet <b>stock</b> with an equiaxed microstructure by directly rolling the as-cast titanium alloys modified with trace boron additions...|$|R
