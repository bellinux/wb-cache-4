25|$|In {{the first}} and second tests of the Pakistan series, he got starts with the bat but didn't get past 50. He was lbw {{offering}} no shot in the first innings at Lords for 21. In the second innings, when England were pushing on, he played <b>some</b> <b>nice</b> strokes in his 41 before being stumped of the bowling of Shahid Afridi. In the second test, he made 38 when he hit a half-volley loosely to point. In the third Test at Headingley, he hit 135 runs from England's total of 515. In the final controversial test at The Oval, on a horribly wet pitch, he got the second golden duck of his Test career when he edged behind. In the second innings, he made 96 before edging behind again before the test came to an unexpected early end.|$|E
500|$|HOURDOSE {{reviewed}} it {{by stating}} [...] "‘Bommarillu’ {{is a pure}} example of a director’s faith in his script and his screenplay.

This film is surely {{one of the most}} well-written and innovative films that Tollywood has produced in recent years." ...|$|E

She was really trusting of me and my vision, and I was trusting of who she was.|$|E
500|$|Former show runner of The Simpsons David Mirkin {{thought the}} episode was [...] "really fun" [...] {{because there were}} [...] "lots of characters" [...] in it and it {{featured}} [...] "lots of terrific animation". Mirkin liked that viewers could see the different characters [...] "team up" [...] and how they pair off. [...] "It's kind of cool to see them hang around like this. Particularly Homer's group which has <b>some</b> <b>nice</b> emotion and they really comes together as a group", Mirkin commented.|$|E

On her nomination, Francis {{felt that she}} had [...] "tremendous good fortune" [...] and was extremely thrilled {{to be a part}} of the show. She said: [...] "I've only been with this show for a year, so I'm thrilled that we managed to put together <b>some</b> <b>nice</b> work that people are enjoying." [...] However, she lost her bid for the award to former General Hospital co-star Nancy Lee Grahn for her portrayal of Alexis Davis.|$|E
500|$|Halperin {{concludes that}} the Scientology {{organization}} is more focused on money than on other issues: [...] "I pretty much found that everything about the church is about making {{as much money as}} possible, which doesn't really make them much different from most other religions. I have to be honest and admit I also met <b>some</b> <b>nice</b> people in the church. It's just that I have a huge problem with their discriminatory attitude toward gays." [...] Halperin disputes Andrew Morton's claim in his book [...] that actor Tom Cruise is second in command of the organization, instead asserting Cruise is actually in the top position of leadership.|$|E
500|$|Film {{historian}} Steven H. Scheuer graded {{the film}} {{one and a}} half stars, writing [...] "Wife is terrorized by unexplainable happenings. Or is it inexplicable? Both describe the film". VideoHound's Golden Movie Retriever by Jim Craddock also gave the film {{one and a half}} stars, and TV Guide gave it two. Webber herself did not like the film, stating that [...] "it didn't impress me" [...] and she [...] "wanted to throw up" [...] after watching it. However, Nicol took a more positive stance, saying: [...] "I liked it; it had <b>some</b> <b>nice</b> dolly shots, a good atmosphere. So I was happy with that; it was a nice change from the films I'd been doing".|$|E

In a review of Into the Blue for the San Francisco Chronicle, Peter Hartlaub noted [...] "director of photography Shane Hurlbut does <b>some</b> <b>nice</b> work in tight places". Lou Lumenick wrote in the New York Post that the [...] "watery interludes" [...] in Into the Blue were [...] "gorgeously photographed by Shane Hurlbut". Though Associated Press writer David Germain gave a negative review overall of Into the Blue, he wrote positively of Hurlbut's cinematography work, commenting: [...] "Shane Hurlbut's cinematography buoys the movie, but his lovely pictures of the actors swimming among jellyfish and shimmery aquatic vegetation cannot compensate for everything else." ...|$|E
500|$|A New Musical Express {{piece on}} 20 November 1993 was also highly {{supportive}} of the K Foundation. [...] "The nearest parallel to the K Foundation donation would be The Beatles' grandiose plans for Apple Corps", they said. [...] "But where Apple handed out money willy-nilly to little end and failed to achieve anything more than get some hippies stoned and put up <b>some</b> <b>nice</b> posters about war being over if you want it, Drummond and Cauty have found a specific target - the relationship between art, money and the critical establishment- and attacked it. By actually offering £40,000 to the artist who produces the duffest piece of work, they've simultaneously sent up {{the whole thing and}} proved their integrity the hard way." ...|$|E
500|$|AOL TV's Jay Black {{called the}} episode [...] "amazing", {{partly because he}} {{believed}} the out-of-office setting made Michael's [...] "social awkwardness and emotional neediness a lot more enjoyable." [...] Black observed that the [...] "main romantic plotline had <b>some</b> <b>nice</b> movement tonight as well," [...] and praised the Pam-Roy and Jim-Karen storylines in particular for their realism. Writing for IGN, Brian Zoromski rated [...] "Phyllis' Wedding" [...] with 7 out of 10, an indication of a [...] "good" [...] episode. He asserted that the episode contained some [...] "great moments" [...] such as Jim's altoid prank on Dwight and Michael's conversation with Phyllis' amnesiac uncle. In contrast to Black however, Zoromski believed Michael's [...] "over-the-top cartoonishness" [...] actions stretched [...] "the believability of the show's" [...] illusion as reality, especially because they occurred outside of the office.|$|E

500|$|Woodburne {{has said}} she never gets bored of playing Susan as she changes all the time. She added [...] "One of the upsides of this job {{is that in a}} week you might be doing {{absolute}} slapstick comedy, you might be doing high drama/tragedy and in between maybe <b>some</b> <b>nice</b> subtle interesting stuff as well, the character keeps changing and evolving depending on who she is interacting with". Woodburne has said that her favourite storyline has been the Susan, Karl and Izzy love triangle. As Susan is normally a good person, it gave her a chance to have a character (Izzy) that she could hate. Woodburne added [...] "It was good to play those much meaner, darker, angrier, cruel moments than always to be the kind character. It was good to see those dents in her armour I think".|$|E
500|$|Julia Ward of TV Squad exclaimed {{that the}} episode's three storylines were [...] "all brilliant". She praised Alec Baldwin, saying that [...] "his {{negotiation}} scenes were gold {{as was his}} line delivery". She felt that Baldwin's great acting was [...] "not unique to this episode", and was what earned him the Golden Globe. Ward finished her review by {{saying that it was}} [...] "satisfying to see a show come together as 30 Rock [...] past few weeks- settling into its rhythm [...] finding its feet". Eric Goldman of IGN felt that this episode [...] "did a very skillful job of juggling three different storylines, all of which delivered solid laughs". He thought that the crew of 30 Rock had figured out [...] "better uses for Jenna, and this episode offered <b>some</b> <b>nice</b> moments for her". He also enjoyed Tracy and Kenneth's subplot, saying it [...] "was a decent one".|$|E
500|$|Rene Rodriguez of The Miami Herald {{revealed}} that the film was from [...] "the John Hughes playbook of high-school comedies but lack the heart and insight Hughes invested in his pictures.", but still praised the teenage cast saying [...] "The performances in Bandslam are uniformly strong – {{good enough to make}} you wish this bunch of charismatic, talented kids had been given better material." [...] Time Out reviewer Derek Adams said that Bandslam is far from exceptional, but is saved by decent character development, a cluster of engaging performances and several amusing deadpan moments. Canada's The Globe and Mail reviewer's conclusion follows: [...] "Bandslam offers <b>some</b> <b>nice</b> observational and comedy moments, and director and co-writer Todd Graff deftly deliver the coming-of-age goods for the three main characters." [...] The Daily Telegraphs reviewer Leight Paastch says that the film gives the genre a right old spin thanks to some lively performances and sharp pacing.|$|E

500|$|When Gareth David-Lloyd {{was cast}} in the role, the {{character}} was renamed Ianto Jones. This {{was inspired by the}} character of Yanto Jones, also played by David-Lloyd, in Russell T Davies's 2004 comedy-drama Mine All Mine. Ianto shares the surname [...] "Jones" [...] with Doctor Who characters Martha Jones and family as well as Harriet Jones, Torchwood character Eugene Jones ("Random Shoes"), and Stuart Allen Jones in Davies's earlier Queer as Folk; Davies states that reusing names (such as Tyler, Smith, Harper, Harkness and Jones) allows him to get a grip of the character on the blank page. In developing the character's attire, costume designer Ray Holman comments: [...] "Ianto has a very distinct look but his suits actually vary quite a lot. He started off with <b>some</b> <b>nice</b> but boring Marks and Spencers suits in series one, which were top-end fitted ones but always very sober. Towards the end of series one, I also got him into a waistcoat, and everyone thought that looked really good.|$|E
500|$|Writing for Entertainment Weekly, Abby West {{focused on}} Carell's acting, {{explaining}} that [...] "the way that Michael's desire to boast and his healthy fear of offending Jan {{played out on}} Steve Carell's face was fantastic. From his braggadocio {{on the phone with}} Todd Packer (Packer!) to his death march up the stairs to face Jan, it was a thing of beauty." [...] BuddyTV's Oscar Dahl believed that [...] "Back from Vacation" [...] was [...] "one of the two or three best of the season", opining that [...] "simplicity" [...] was the key to the series' success. Dahl continued, [...] "Each episode's premise can be entirely mundane and inconsequential. It will still mine laughs from the situation at hand. We also had <b>some</b> <b>nice</b> development in the Jim-Pam-Karen triangle, with Pam giving Jim relationship advice, then bawling her eyes out afterwards. Maybe the best scene in the episode saw Dwight comfort her." [...] Television Without Pity graded the episode with an A.|$|E
500|$|... "What Lies Below" [...] {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from television critics. The A.V. Club contributor Todd VanDerWerff graded the episode with a B-, explaining that despite <b>some</b> <b>nice</b> moments, it was [...] "an {{episode of the}} show that started out utterly predictably, continued along an utterly predictable path and yet somehow got fairly enjoyable by the end just through sheer force of will {{on the part of}} the cast." [...] IGN's Ramsey Isler also found the episode average and predictable, as it lacked [...] "much of the quintessential storytelling elements that, once upon a time, made this one of the best shows on TV." [...] Like many other critics, Isler thought the episode was too similar to The X-Files, and gave it 7.0/10. TV Squad columnist Jane Boursaw thought Walter discovering a cure was a little far-fetched, and wished Broyles was a greater part of the show. Television Without Pity gave the episode a B+.|$|E
