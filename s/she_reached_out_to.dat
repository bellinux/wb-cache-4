Imelda learned how to get people's {{attention}} and to focus it on both her and her husband. <b>She</b> <b>reached</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> every single person who was seen as essential in Marcos's campaign. Her efforts were not original, but extraordinary. No other politicians' wives shook hands with all the delegates, visited their homes, genuinely understood the concerns they had, aside from Imelda. She bombarded them with gifts when necessary.|$|E
25|$|Robinson {{was inaugurated}} as the seventh President of Ireland on 3 December 1990. She proved a remarkably popular {{president}}, earning the praise of Brian Lenihan himself who, {{before his death}} five years later, {{said that she was}} a better president than he ever could have been. She took an office that had a reputation as being little more than a retirement position for prominent politicians and breathed new life into the role. Robinson brought to the presidency legal knowledge, deep intellect, and political experience. <b>She</b> <b>reached</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> the Irish diaspora (the large number of Irish emigrants and people of Irish descent). She also changed the face of Anglo-Irish relations, when she was the first serving Irish president to visit the United Kingdom and meet Queen Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace. She welcomed visits by senior members of the British royal family, most notably the Prince of Wales, to her official residence, Áras an Uachtaráin.|$|E

Prior to Carey signing a record contract, she and producer Ben Margulies had written and produced a four-track demo which included [...] "Someday". After signing a contract with Columbia Records, Carey began work on her debut album and <b>she</b> <b>reached</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> Ric Wake {{to ask if he}} would produce the song, to which he agreed. The composition of the demo recording was changed during the recording process, most notably replacing the horns with a guitar, which Carey disapproved of.|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Naughty Girl" [...] was {{directed}} by Jake Nava, who directed Beyoncé's videos, [...] "Crazy in Love" [...] and [...] "Baby Boy". The video is inspired by the dancing of Cyd Charisse and Fred Astaire in the 1953 musical comedy film, The Band Wagon and has a Studio 54 style. Paired with Usher, Beyoncé dances seductively and flirts with him to portray a naughty girl. She {{felt that they were}} a [...] "perfect match" [...] for the dancing scenes in the video. According to Usher, the video is a homage to classic [...] "ultimate entertainers"; including dancers, singers and actors. He further talked about the collaboration on the video, saying, [...] "Beyoncé and me have been talking about doing a record together. <b>She</b> <b>reached</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> me and said she had an idea and really wanted me to be the lead in her video... I was like, 'Well let me hear the idea.' It sounded like something totally different than what had been on TV." ...|$|E
500|$|Following the events, {{as well as}} {{the release}} of Carey's {{succeeding}} album, Charmbracelet (2002), she began working on new material for The Emancipation of Mimi (2005). Aside from the dance-influenced tracks and the ballads, Carey created a concept, in which a song's lyrics would reach out to God. She created the song's choral lyrics, melody and main instrumentation, before calling James [...] "Big Jim" [...] Wright for a collaboration. During their meeting, Wright helped Carey arrange the song's chord structure, as well as produce the introduction, while Carey finished the rest of the lyrics. Once completing [...] "Fly Like a Bird", Carey had her pastor, Clarence Keaton, read two verses from the Bible on the song, [...] "Weeping may endure for the night, but joy comes in the morning" [...] during the introduction, and [...] "He said 'He'll never forsake you, or leave you alone' Trust him". According to Carey, the song, {{as well as the}} Biblical verses, were included on her [...] "comeback album" [...] because they helped her get through many difficult situations in the past. She described moments that were difficult growing up, during which <b>she</b> <b>reached</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> God, as well as during her breakdown, when she used such verses to give her faith. Carey explained how although the verses helped her greatly, no one had ever said them to her. For this reason, she wanted {{to make sure they were}} there for fans and listeners to hear, in order to give them faith and assurance lest they be in a grave situation.|$|E
500|$|At {{an early}} age, she was {{introduced}} by her parents to blues music, jazz and art rock, which, she told Rolling Stone in 1995, would later influence her: [...] "I was brought up listening to John Lee Hooker, to Howlin' Wolf, to Robert Johnson, {{and a lot of}} Jimi Hendrix and Captain Beefheart. So I was exposed to all these very compassionate musicians at a very young age, and that's always remained in me and seems to surface more as I get older. I think the way we are as we get older is a result of what we knew when we were children." [...] During her teenage years, she began listening to new wave and synthpop bands such as Soft Cell, Duran Duran and Spandau Ballet, although later stated that it was a phase when she was [...] "having a bit of a rebellion against my parents' record collection." [...] In her later teenage years, she became a fan of American indie rock bands including Pixies, Television and Slint (whom <b>she</b> <b>reached</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> when the band included a message in the inside sleeve of Spiderland saying [...] "interested female vocalists write 1864 Douglas Blvd., Louisville, KY 40205"). [...] Though not as many critics have suspected, Patti Smith; a frequent comparison that Harvey dismisses as [...] "lazy journalism." [...] However, recently Harvey has said that Smith is [...] "so energising to see and so passionate with what she's doing". Harvey has also cited Siouxsie Sioux in terms of live performance, stating : [...] "She is so exciting to watch, so full of energy and human raw quality". She has also drawn inspiration from Russian folk music, Italian soundtrack composer Ennio Morricone, classical composers like Arvo Pärt, Samuel Barber and Henryk Górecki; and Neil Young. As a lyricist, Harvey has cited numerous poets, authors and lyricists as influences on her work including Harold Pinter, T. S. Eliot, William Butler Yeats, James Joyce, Ted Hughes and contemporaries such as Shane MacGowan and Jez Butterworth.|$|E

2500|$|The {{reasons for}} Kelly's {{behavior}} first started to reveal themselves in episode 7, [...] "Perfect Mom", when Kelly {{was forced to}} confront her mother's drug addiction and alcoholism. Several of her friends, particularly the Walsh family and Andrea Zuckerman, first came to appreciate Kelly's difficulties in life when they saw her handle this problem. During episode 13, [...] "Slumber Party," [...] Kelly revealed that she was taken advantage of by a senior during her freshmen year in high school, which had led to a promiscuous lifestyle and reputation which deeply hurt her self-esteem.

[...] However, instead of restricting her social and civic activities {{to the wealthy}} or to members of her husband’s political party (the Republican Party), <b>she</b> <b>reached</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> others. For example, in 1908, she led efforts by the New York chapter of the National Women's Committee to expose harsh working conditions in New York City's factories, foundries and hotels. She explained, [...] "Should not the woman who spends the money which the employees help to provide take {{a special interest in}} their welfare, especially in that of the women wage earners?" [...] In 1909, she created waves when, as the “wife of a banker,” she “entertained one hundred members of the International Brotherhood of Stationary Firemen at her summer home.” In 1906, Republican Governor Charles Evans Hughes appointed her {{as a member of the}} Board of Managers of New York State Reformatory for Women at Bedford, New York.|$|E

5000|$|For {{all intents}} and purposes, the Lady of the Lake is not malicious.

6000|$|And {{when that}} spell slackened its hold there wedged {{into her mind}} a {{consciousness}} of the man she loved--Jean Isbel. Then emotion and thought strove for mastery over her. It was not herself or love that she loved, but a living man. Suddenly he existed so clearly for her {{that she could see}} him, hear him, almost feel him. Her whole soul, her very life cried out to him for protection, for salvation, for love, for fulfillment. No denial, no doubt marred the white blaze of her realization. From the instant that she had looked up into Jean Isbel's dark face she had loved him. Only she had not known. She bowed now, and bent, and humbly quivered under the mastery of something beyond her ken. Thought clung to the beginnings of her romance--to the three times she had seen him. Every look, every word, every act of his returned to her now {{in the light of the}} truth. Love at first sight! He had sworn it, bitterly, eloquently, scornful of her doubts. And now a blind, sweet, shuddering ecstasy swayed her. How weak and frail seemed her body--too small, too slight for this monstrous and terrible engine of fire and lightning and fury and glory--her heart! It must burst or break. Relentlessly memory pursued Ellen, and her thoughts whirled and emotion conquered her. At last she quivered up to her knees as if lashed to action. It seemed that first kiss of Isbel's, cool and gentle and timid, was on her lips. And her eyes closed and hot tears welled from under her lids. Her groping hands found only the dead twigs and the pine boughs of the trees. Had <b>she</b> <b>reached</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> clasp him? Then hard and violent on her mouth and cheek and neck burned those other kisses of Isbel's, and with the flashing, stinging memory came the truth that now she would have bartered her soul for them. Utterly she surrendered to the resistlessness of this love. Her loss of mother and friends, her wandering from one wild place to another, her lonely life among bold and rough men, had developed her for violent love. It overthrew all pride, it engendered humility, it killed hate. Ellen wiped the tears from her eyes, and as she knelt there she swept to her breast a fragrant spreading bough of pine needles. [...] "I'll go to him," [...] she whispered. [...] "I'll tell him of--of my--my love. I'll tell him to take me away--away to the end of the world--away from heah--before it's too late!" ...|$|E
