40|$|This study {{discusses}} {{the influence of}} the spark plu electrode gap distance on power, torque, and fuel consumption (sfc) of Honda GX- 160 engine at 3600 rpm rotation with load variations. The aim of this study to determine the maximum performance of the distance to the <b>spark</b> <b>plug</b> loose power and torque with fuel gas. Testing is done by using a brake dynamometer in a laboratory type of energy conversion engineering faculty at the Bengkulu University. Variations <b>spark</b> <b>plug</b> electrode <b>gap</b> distance of 0. 5 mm was started, 0. 6 mm, 0. 7 mm, 0. 8 um; 0. 9 mm, and 1 mm. The results showed the highest torque value indicated by the <b>spark</b> <b>plug</b> electrode <b>gap</b> of 0. 8 mm round 10. 58 N-m at 1600 rpm for given load and the lowest torque value indicated by the <b>spark</b> <b>plug</b> electrode <b>gap</b> of 1 mm is equal to 7. 27 N-m at 1600 rpm. The highest power shown by the <b>spark</b> <b>plug</b> electrode <b>gap</b> of 0. 8 mm by 2. 63 hp at the given load round 1900 rpm, and the lowest value seen in the variation of the <b>spark</b> <b>plug</b> electrode <b>gap</b> of 1 mm is equal to 1. 78 hp. The best value of specific fuel consumption (sfc) is generated by the <b>spark</b> <b>plug</b> electrode distance of 0. 7 mm for 0. 304 l/hp-h, and the least in the sequence is generated by the <b>spark</b> <b>plug</b> electrode distance of 1 mm for 0. 345 l/hp-h. In this case due to the characteristics of the fuel will be good if the value of fuel consumption (sfc) of the fuel is getting low.

2500|$|The spark {{generation}} {{story is a}} little more complicated. The purpose of the ignition coil is to make a spark that jumps the <b>spark</b> <b>plug's</b> <b>gap,</b> which might be [...] (it also has to jump the rotor-to-distributor-post gap). At the moment the points open, there is a much smaller gap, say about , across the points. Something must be done to prevent the points from arcing as they separate; if the points arc, then they will drain the magnetic energy that was intended for the <b>spark</b> <b>plug.</b> The capacitor (condenser) performs that task. The capacitor temporarily keeps the primary current flowing so the voltage across the points is below the point's arcing voltage. There is a race: the voltage across the points is increasing as the primary current charges the capacitor, {{but at the same time}} the points' separation (and consequent arcing voltage) is increasing. Ultimately, the point separation will increase to something such as , the maximum separation of the points.|$|R
25|$|As {{the engine}} {{crankshaft}} turns, it also turns the distributor shaft at half the speed. In a four-stroke engine, the crankshaft turns twice for the ignition cycle. A multi-lobed cam {{is attached to}} the distributor shaft; there is one lobe for each engine cylinder. A spring-loaded rubbing block follows the lobed portions of the cam contour and controls the opening and closing of points. During most of the cycle, the rubbing block keeps the points closed to allow a current to build in the ignition coil's primary winding. As a piston reaches the top of the engine's compression cycle, the cam's lobe is high enough to cause the breaker points to open. Opening the points causes the current through the primary coil to stop. Without the steady current through the primary, the magnetic field generated in the coil immediately collapses. This high rate of change of magnetic flux induces a high voltage in the coil's secondary windings that ultimately causes the <b>spark</b> <b>plug's</b> <b>gap</b> to arc and ignite the fuel.|$|R

5000|$|A <b>spark</b> <b>plug</b> <b>gap</b> gauge is a disc with {{a sloping}} edge, or with round wires of precise diameters, {{and is used}} to measure the gap. Use of a feeler gauge with flat blades instead of round wires, as is used on {{distributor}} points or valve lash, will give erroneous results, due to the shape of spark plug electrodes. The simplest gauges are a collection of keys of various thicknesses which match the desired gaps and the gap is adjusted until the key fits snugly. With current engine technology, universally incorporating solid state ignition systems and computerized fuel injection, the gaps used are larger on average than in the era of carburetors and breaker point distributors, to the extent that spark plug gauges from that era cannot always measure the required gaps of current cars. [...] Vehicles using compressed natural gas generally require narrower gaps than vehicles using gasoline.|$|E
50|$|The spark {{across the}} spark plug's {{electrodes}} forms a small kernel of flame approximately {{the size of}} the <b>spark</b> <b>plug</b> <b>gap.</b> As it grows in size, its heat output increases, which allows it to grow at an accelerating rate, expanding rapidly through the combustion chamber. This growth is due to the travel of the flame front through the combustible fuel air mix itself, and due to turbulence which rapidly stretches the burning zone into a complex of fingers of burning gas that have a much greater surface area than a simple spherical ball of flame would have. In normal combustion, this flame front moves throughout the fuel/air mixture at a rate characteristic for the particular mixture. Pressure rises smoothly to a peak, as nearly all the available fuel is consumed, then pressure falls as the piston descends. Maximum cylinder pressure is achieved a few crankshaft degrees after the piston passes TDC, so that the force applied on the piston (from the increasing pressure applied to the top surface of the piston) can give its hardest push precisely when the piston's speed and mechanical advantage on the crank shaft gives the best recovery of force from the expanding gases, thus maximizing torque transferred to the crank shaft.|$|E
40|$|Interest in {{ion current}} sensing for HCCI {{combustion}} arises when a feedback signal from {{some sort of}} combustion sensor is {{needed in order to}} determine the state of the combustion process. A previous study has revealed that ion current sensors in the form of <b>spark</b> <b>plugs</b> can be used instead of expensive piezoelectric transducers for HCCI combustion sensing. Sufficiently high ion current levels were achieved when using relatively rich mixtures diluted with EGR. The study also shows that it is not the actual dilution per se but the actual air/fuel equivalence ratio which is important for the signal level. Conclusions were made that it is possible to obtain information on combustion timing and oscillating wave phenomena from the measurements. However, the study showed that the ion current is local compared to the pressure which is global in the combustion chamber. This observation triggered the present study where the aim is to investigate the ion current at different locations in the combustion chamber. The ion current was measured simultaneously at seven locations in the combustion chamber. In order to achieve this, 6 <b>spark</b> <b>plugs</b> were fitted circumferentially in a spacer placed between the cylinder block and the head. The seventh <b>spark</b> <b>plug</b> was placed in the cylinder head. Individual DC sources of 85 volts were applied across the <b>spark</b> <b>plug</b> <b>gaps.</b> The present study indicates that the combustion timing seems to be dependent on the wall temperature at the different <b>spark</b> <b>plug</b> locations.

50|$|The Trionic system lacks a {{camshaft}} position sensor. This sensor {{is normally}} {{a prerequisite for}} a sequential pre ignition/pinging regulation and fuel injection. Saab Trionic must decide whether cylinder one or cylinder four ignites when the crank shaft position sensor indicates that cylinder one and four is at TDC. This is done by help of ionization current. One of the poles of the secondary coil of the spark coils {{is connected to the}} spark plugs in an ordinary manner. The other pole isn’t grounded directly but connected to an 80 V voltage. This means that an 80 V voltage is applied across the spark gap of the spark plugs, except when the spark is fired. When combustion has occurred the temperature in the combustion chamber is very high. The gases are formed as ions and start to conduct electric current. This results in a current flowing in the <b>spark</b> <b>plug</b> <b>gap</b> (without resulting in a spark). The ionisation current is measured in pairs, cylinder one and two is one pair and cylinder three and four in the other pair. If combustion occurs in cylinder one or two the ignition cassette sends battery voltage (B+) pulse to the ECU, pin 17. If the combustion takes place in cylinder three or four the B+ pulse is fed to pin 18 in ECU. If the crankshaft position sensor indicates that cylinders one and four are at TDC and a B+ pulse enters the ECU via pin 17 simultaneously, then the ECU know that it is cylinder one that has ignited. Upon starting, the ECU doesn’t know which cylinder is in compression phase, hence ignition is initiated in both cylinders one and four and 180 crank shaft degrees later sparks in cylinder two and three are fired. As soon as the combustion signals enters the ECU via pin 17 and pin 18 the ignition and fuel injection is synchronised to the engines firing order. The combustion signals are also used to detect misfires.|$|E

In the knock experiments, two detecting methods are used. One is the ionic current method.

With {{the improvement of}} internal combustion engines the turbulence intensity and internal pressure have risen, demanding more efficient and powerful ignition systems.

Cylinder pressure data were collected on a dedicated HP 1000 computer for every degree of crank angle rotation for up to 300 successive cycles. A phenomenological model was developed for turbulent combustion that split the combustion process into three phases: early laminar burn, turbulent combustion, and final burn. The model allowed {{the study of the}} physical phenomena occurring within the combustion chamber and enabled insights to be gained into their effects on combustion and cyclic variations. The study showed: The variation in mixture strength has a far greater effect on the average and Coefficient of Variation (COV) values of all the combustion performance parameters, than does changing the fuel type. Cycle by cycle variations in combustion are best characterized by COV of imep. The onset of knock has no discernible effect on the COVs of the measured parameters. The part throttle results show higher COVs than at Wide Open Throttle (WOT) due to slower burn, supporting the theory that faster initial flame speeds reduce cyclic variations. The combustion model was used to support the hypothesis that cycle by cycle variations are caused by movement of the flame kernel by turbulence within the combustion chamber. SER...|$|E

As the <b>spark</b> <b>plug</b> can be removed for inspection, the effects of combustion on the plug can be examined. An examination, or [...] "reading" [...] of the characteristic markings on the firing end of the <b>spark</b> <b>plug</b> can indicate conditions within the running engine. The <b>spark</b> <b>plug</b> tip will bear the marks as evidence of what is happening inside the engine. Usually {{there is no other way}} to know what is going on inside an engine running at peak power. Engine and <b>spark</b> <b>plug</b> manufacturers will publish information about the characteristic markings in <b>spark</b> <b>plug</b> reading charts.Such charts are useful for general use but are of almost no use in reading racing engine <b>spark</b> <b>plugs,</b> which is an entirely different matter.|$|R

(Illustrated at http://www.marxwildwest.com/cartoons%20-%20non-disney.html). In 1960, King Features made plans to have Snuffy Smith serving hot dogs and chili at Snuffy's Shantys across the country, the grandiose plan of a Columbus, Georgia franchiser who had hoped to have 700 Shantys operating by 1970.|$|R
