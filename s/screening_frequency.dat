40|$|PURPOSE: To {{determine}} {{the effect of}} cataract on frequency doubling perimetry in the screening mode. METHODS: Frequency doubling technology perimetry in the C- 20 - 5 screening mode was performed prospectively on 34 patients with otherwise healthy eyes before and after phacoemulsification. Cataracts were scored using the LOCS III classification, and the number of missed points (at any level of severity) on the screening field was compared before and after surgery. RESULTS: Nine patients missed at least one point pre-operatively and had no misses post-operatively. Those patients with posterior subcapsular (PSC) cataract {{were significantly more likely to}} miss points on the <b>screening</b> <b>frequency</b> doubling technology perimetry than those without posterior subcapsular cataracts (P < 0. 001; Fisher exact test). In addition, the degree of posterior subcapsular cataract strongly correlated with the number of missed points pre-operatively (r = 0. 97). The degree of nuclear sclerotic cataract did not correlate strongly with the number of missed points (r = 0. 26), but the correlation was slightly stronger in the presence of cortical cataract (r = 0. 36). CONCLUSION: Advanced age-related cataracts may cause false positive results on the <b>screening</b> <b>frequency</b> doubling technology, and the presence of even mild posterior subcapsular cataract may be a cause of false positive results and should be taken into consideration when interpreting the <b>screening</b> <b>frequency</b> doubling technology perimetry results.

40|$|AbstractPurposeTo explore {{public attitudes}} towards modifying {{frequency}} of mammography screening based on genetic risk. MethodsHome-based interviews {{were carried out}} with a population-based sample of 942 women aged 18 – 74 years in the UK. Demographic characteristics and perceived breast cancer (BC) risk were examined as predictors of support for risk-stratified BC screening and of the acceptability of raised or lowered <b>screening</b> <b>frequency</b> based on genetic risk, using multivariate logistic regression. ResultsOver two-thirds of respondents (65. 8 %) supported the idea of varying <b>screening</b> <b>frequency</b> {{on the basis of}} genetic risk. The majority (85. 4 %) were willing to have more frequent breast screening if they were found to be at higher risk, but fewer (58. 8 %) were willing to have less frequent screening if at lower risk (t (956)  =  15. 6, p <  0. 001). Ethnic minority status was associated with less acceptability of more frequent screening (OR =  0. 40, 95 % CI =  0. 21 – 0. 74), but there were no other significant demographic correlates. Higher perceived risk of BC was associated with greater acceptability of more frequent screening (OR =  1. 71, 95 %CI =  1. 27 – 2. 30). ConclusionWomen were positive about adjusting the frequency of mammography screening in line with personal genetic risk, but it will be important to develop effective communication materials to minimise resistance to reducing <b>screening</b> <b>frequency</b> for those at lower genetic risk...|$|E

50|$|<b>Screen</b> <b>frequency</b> is {{determined}} by the type of paper the image is printed on. An absorbent paper surface, uncoated recycled paper for instance, lets ink droplets spread (dot gain)—so requires a more open printing screen. Input resolution can therefore be reduced to minimize file size without loss in quality, as long as the quality factor of 2 is maintained. This is easily determined by doubling the line frequency. For example, printing on an uncoated paper stock often limits printing <b>screen</b> <b>frequency</b> to no more than 120 lpi, therefore, a quality factor of 2 is achieved with images of 240 ppi.|$|R

Data were collated for each national jurisdiction on seven key programme characteristics: <b>screening</b> <b>frequency,</b> population coverage, quality of test, programme model, quality of follow-up, quality of colonoscopy and quality of data collection. A list of optimal features for each of the seven characteristics was compiled, based on the FOBT screening literature and our detailed examination of each programme. Results Each country made different implementation choices or trade-offs intended to conserve costs and/or manage limited and expensive resources. The overall outcome of these trade-offs was probable lower programme effectiveness as a result of compromises such as reduced <b>screening</b> <b>frequency,</b> restricted target age range, the use of less accurate tests, the deliberate setting of low programme positivity rates or increased inconvenience to participants from re-testing.

It unknown whether the health benefits and costs of routine nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) are justified, given the availability of newer fourth-generation immunoassay tests. METHODS: Using a dynamic HIV transmission model instantiated with U. S. epidemiologic, demographic, and behavioral data, I estimated the number of acute infections identified, HIV infections prevented, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained, and the cost-effectiveness of alternative screening strategies. I varied the target population (everyone aged 15 - 64, injection drug users [IDUs] and {{men who have sex}} with men [MSM], or MSM only), <b>screening</b> <b>frequency</b> (annually, or every six months), and test(s) utilized (fourth-generation immunoassay only, or immunoassay followed by pooled NAAT). RESULTS: Annual immunoassay testing of MSM reduces incidence by 9. 5 % and costs <$ 10, 000 per QALY gained. Adding pooled NAAT identifies 410 AHI per year, prevents 9. 6 % of new cases, costs $ 92, 000 per QALY gained, and remains <$ 100, 000 per QALY gained in settings where undiagnosed HIV prevalence exceeds 4 %. Screening IDUs and MSM annually with fourth-generation immunoassay reduces incidence by 13 % with cost-effectiveness <$ 10, 000 per QALY gained. Increasing the <b>screening</b> <b>frequency</b> to every six months reduces incidence by 11 % (MSM only) or 16 % (MSM and IDUs) and costs <$ 20, 000 per QALY gained. CONCLUSIONS: Pooled NAAT testing every 12 months of MSM and IDUs in the United States prevents a modest number of infections, but may be cost-effective given sufficiently high HIV prevalence levels. However, testing via fourth-generation immunoassay every six months prevents a greater number of infections, is more economically efficient, and may obviate the benefits of acute HIV screening via NAAT...|$|E

40|$|Aims/hypothesis: Our study {{aimed to}} {{validate}} {{a model to}} determine a personalised <b>screening</b> <b>frequency</b> for diabetic retinopathy. Methods: A model calculating a personalised screening interval for monitoring retinopathy based on patients' risk profile was validated using the data of 3, 319 type 2 diabetic patients in the Diabetes Care System West-Friesland, the Netherlands. Two-field fundus photographs were graded according to the EURODIAB coding system. Sight-threatening retinopathy (STR) {{was considered to be}} grades 3 - 5. Validity of the model was assessed using calibration and discrimination measures. We compared model-based time of screening with time of STR diagnosis and calculated the differences in the number of fundus photographs using the model compared with those in annual or biennial screening. Results: During a mean of 53 months of follow-up, 76 patients (2. 3 %) developed STR. Using the model, the mean screening interval was 31 months, leading to a reduced <b>screening</b> <b>frequency</b> of 61 % compared with annual screening and 23 % compared with biennial screening. STR incidence occurred after a mean of 26 months after the model-based time of screening in 67 patients (88. 2 %). In nine patients (11. 8 %), STR had developed before the model-based time of screening. The discriminatory ability of the model was good (C-statistic 0. 83; 95 % CI 0. 74, 0. 92). Calibration showed that the model overestimated STR risk. Conclusions/interpretation: A large reduction in retinopathy screening was achieved using the model in this population of patients with a very low incidence of retinopathy. Considering the number of potentially missed cases of STR, there is room for improvement in the model. Use of the model for personalised screening may eventually help to reduce healthcare use and costs of diabetes care. © 2014 Springer-Verlag...|$|E

Documented migrants (DM) {{have access to}} this screening but undocumented migrants (UM) do not, instead relying on ad-hoc care from clinics run by non-governmental organisations. We aimed to assess <b>screening</b> <b>frequency</b> in UM and to compare prevalence of infection in UM with DM.

We compared prevalence of current infections in UM and DM by calculating standardised prevalence ratios (SPR). Results The three UM clinics registered 219 pregnancies qualifying for screening. Overall 43, 58 and 60  % of pregnant UM had a test result recorded for HBV, Syphilis and HIV respectively, compared to > 99  % in the general Danish population including DM. The prevalence of HBV was higher in UM than in DM (SPR: 2. 4; 95  % CI: 1. 1 – 5. 3).

40|$|A {{simplified}} {{model of}} the halftone contact screening system was devised and tested to determine {{the applicability of the}} model for predicting frequency transfer characteristics of the system. The model was tested using illuminance sinusoids of varying frequency as input to the halftone system. The output was obtained by optically correlating the exposing sine wave with its halftone image. It was found that the halftone system is capable of transfering information at frequencies greater than the <b>screen</b> <b>frequency,</b> and that the model generally underestimates the ability of the system to reproduce high frequency information, although the basic shape of the function could be predicted. The descrepancies were attributed to the inability of the frequency domain model to deal with phase and partial dots...|$|R
5000|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{vibrating}} screen is that particles are introduced to the gaps in the <b>screens</b> repeatedly. The <b>frequency</b> of the <b>screen</b> must be high enough so that it prevents the particles from blocking the apertures and the maximum height of the particle trajectory should occur when the screen surface is at its lowest point. Based on the principle, there is an optimum frequency and amplitude of vibration [...] Transmission refers to the fraction of desired particle that passes through the apertures in the <b>screen.</b> At low <b>frequency,</b> <b>screening</b> efficiency is high but blinding is severe. Blinding will decrease as frequency increases but the particles will have difficulty going through the apertures. When designing a high <b>frequency</b> vibrating <b>screen,</b> an optimum point of frequency and amplitude must be chosen, depending on the specific applications.|$|R
