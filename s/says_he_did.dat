5|$|Tom Mankiewicz, {{who worked}} on the three {{preceding}} Bond films, claims he was called in to do an extensive rewrite of the script. Mankiewicz <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not receive credit, because Broccoli was limited to the number of non-English in key positions he could employ on the films to obtain Eady Levy assistance.|$|E

During interrogation, Reggie <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not know Todd was really dead; he insists he fired a prop gun with blanks to scare Holden into {{splitting}} {{the money from}} the videos with them. Police soon learn the wadding from a blank was accidentally fired into Todd, and a horrified Reggie faces manslaughter charges. Willow, claiming to have simply been seeking fame as an actress, is released without criminal charges. The episode ends with Logan and Wheeler watching a video of Larry King interviewing Willow on a giant screen in Times Square.|$|E
5|$|During his vice-presidency, Kagame {{controlled}} the national army and maintained law and order, while other officials began rebuilding the country. Many RPF soldiers carried out retribution killings; it is disputed whether Kagame organised these, or was powerless to stop them. It {{is important to}} note that Kagame <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not support these killings and failed to stop them. These soldiers however, were later put on trial. Hutu refugee camps formed in Zaire and other countries, which were controlled by the genocidaires (participants in the genocide) and threatened Rwanda's security. These camps were given food and medical aid by several western governments and aid agencies. The RPF attacked the camps in 1996, forcing many refugees to return home, but insurgents continued to attack Rwanda. The attack on the refugee camps killed an estimated 200,000 people. As part of the invasion, Kagame sponsored two controversial rebel wars in Zaire. The Rwandan- and Ugandan-backed rebels won the first war (1996–97), installing Laurent-Désiré Kabila as president in place of dictator Mobutu and renaming the country as the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). The second war was launched in 1998 against Kabila, and later his son Joseph, following the DRC government's expulsion of Rwandan and Ugandan military forces from the country. The war escalated into a continent-wide conflict which lasted until a 2003 peace deal and ceasefire.|$|E

25|$|Townshend <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> {{not have}} many friends growing up, so {{he spent much of}} his boyhood reading {{adventure}} novels like Gulliver's Travels and Treasure Island. He enjoyed his family's frequent excursions to the seaside and the Isle of Man. It was on one of these trips in the summer of 1956 that he repeatedly watched the 1956 film Rock Around the Clock, sparking his fascination with American rock and roll. Not long thereafter, he went to see Bill Haley perform in London, Townshend's first concert. At the time, he did not see himself pursuing a career as a professional musician; instead, he wanted to become a journalist.|$|E
25|$|The year 383 denotes a {{significant}} point in Welsh history, remembered {{in literature and}} {{considered to be the}} foundation point of several medieval royal dynasties. In that year the Roman general Magnus Maximus would strip all of western and northern Britain of troops and senior administrators and launch a successful bid for imperial power, continuing to rule Britain from Gaul as emperor. Having left with the troops and Roman administrators, and planning to continue as the ruler of Britain in the future, his practical course was to transfer local authority to local rulers. Welsh legend provides a mythic story that <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> exactly that.|$|E

25|$|Around dawn, Tarleton {{reached the}} {{plantations}} of Castle Hill, Doctor Thomas Walker's home, and a splinter group of British arrived at Belvoir, {{the home of}} his son, Continental Congress member John Walker. Tarleton captured or paroled various important figures at the two plantations. Various legends have sprung up about the stop at Castle Hill. Supposedly, Dr. Walker prepared an elaborate breakfast (including alcohol), for Tarleton in order to allow more time for Jefferson and the legislature to get warning of the cavalry. Tarleton's account <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> pause at Castle Hill for a half-hour rest, but the story of Walker's ploy is probably apocryphal.|$|E
25|$|Robert Neville is the {{apparent}} sole survivor of a pandemic whose symptoms resemble vampirism. It {{is said that}} the pandemic {{was caused by a}} war, and that it was spread by dust storms in the cities and an explosion in the mosquito population. The narrative details Neville's daily life in Los Angeles as he attempts to comprehend, research, and possibly cure the disease, to which he is immune. Neville's past is revealed through flashbacks; the disease claimed his wife and daughter, and he was forced to kill his wife after she seemingly rose from the dead as a vampire and attacked him. Before he killed her, Neville <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> try to keep her with him but gives no details about this.|$|E

The party turns to chaos and Lucy and Leon get {{everyone}} out by saying the police are outside. Leon offers to help Lucy clean up and asks her to join {{in a game of}} Twister with him. As they are playing, a condom falls out Lucy's pocket. Leon sees it and <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not {{want to take advantage of}} her. However, she kisses him passionately, which leads to sex. After they have sex, Leon receives a text message and gets dressed but asks if Lucy wants to do it again.

500|$|While he {{occasionally}} scripted certain pages or scenes, more frequently he did not, and often wrote dialogue only after having drawn the artwork. [...] Brown did not plan out the stories, {{though he might}} have certain ideas prepared. [...] Some ideas he found carried him {{for up to two}} to three issues of Yummy Fur. [...] Brown used of flashback scenes different perspectives to alter the story to his needs—for example, when Brown revisited the scene of Josie's murder, he placed Ed behind a bush, linking the two characters' fates. [...] When he had originally done the murder scene, he <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not [...] "know that Ed was over in the bushes a couple feet away".|$|E
500|$|During editing, Tarantino and Rodriguez came up {{with the}} idea of {{inserting}} [...] "missing reels" [...] into the film. [...] " [...] was about to show an Italian crime movie with Oliver Reed," [...] Rodriguez recalls, [...] "and he was saying, 'Oh, it's got a missing reel in it. But it's really interesting because after the missing reel, you don't know if he slept with a girl or he didn't because she <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> and he says that he didn't. It leaves you guessing, and the movie still works with 20 minutes gone out of it.' I thought, 'Oh, my God, that's what we’ve got to do. We've got to have a missing reel!' I'm going to use it in a way where it actually says 'missing reel' for 10 seconds, and then when we come back, you're arriving in the third act. [...] The late second acts in movies are usually the most predictable and the most boring, that's where the good guy really turns out to be the bad guy, and the bad guy is really good, and the couple becomes friends. Suddenly, though, in the third act, all bets are off and it's a whole new story anyway." ...|$|E
500|$|In early 1975, Brando {{signed on}} as Jor-El with a salary of $3.7million and 11.75% of the box office gross profits, totaling $19million. He horrified Salkind by proposing in their first meeting that Jor-El appear as a green {{suitcase}} or a bagel with Brando's voice, but Donner used flattery to persuade the actor to portray Jor-El himself. Brando hoped {{to use some of}} his salary for a proposed 13-part Roots-style miniseries on Native Americans in the United States. Brando had it in his contract to complete all of his scenes in 12 days. He also refused to memorize his dialogue, so cue cards were compiled across the set. Fellow Oscar winner Hackman was cast as Lex Luthor days later. The filmmakers made it a priority to shoot all of Brando's and Hackman's footage [...] "because they would be committed to other films immediately." [...] Though the Salkinds felt that Puzo had written a solid story for the two-part film, they deemed his scripts too long and so hired Robert Benton and David Newman for rewrite work. Benton became too busy directing The Late Show, so David's wife Leslie was brought in to help her husband finish writing duties. George MacDonald Fraser was later hired to do some work on the script, but he <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> little.|$|E

500|$|Biographers {{describe}} Rutherford as {{tall and}} solidly built with a senatorial demeanor, {{and a strong}} booming voice that helped make him a powerful orator. In 1917, The New York Times stated that Rutherford [...] "has a reputation as an eloquent, forceful speaker". Watch Tower Society literature states that his personality contrasted strongly with that of his predecessor. One Witness history book says that while Russell was kind, warm and tactful, Rutherford [...] "was warm and generous toward his associates {{but he was also}} a brusque and direct type of person, and his legal background and experiences in early life gave him a directness in his approach to problems in dealing with his brothers that caused some to take offense." [...] Another Watch Tower Society account <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not hide his feelings, adding, [...] "His bluntness, even when spoken in kindness, was sometimes misunderstood." [...] Fellow Watch Tower Society director A. H. Macmillan says Rutherford [...] "spoke as simply and directly to the people as he knew how, and he was an extremely forthright man. He was thoroughly convinced that {{what he had to say}} was the truth and that it was a matter of life and death." [...] Macmillan added, [...] "He would never tolerate anything that would be contrary to what he clearly understood the Bible to teach. He was so strict about that, he would permit nothing that would seem to show a compromise when it came to an issue of the truth." [...] Author Tony Wills describes him as charitable and generous, and says his sympathy for the poor and oppressed was exceeded only by his hatred for the rich, the oppressors. Wills also notes that he was a dynamic, impatient extrovert. Other authors also address Rutherford's abrasiveness: James Penton describes him as blunt and moody with an explosive temper, with [...] "a streak of self-righteousness which caused him to regard anyone who opposed him as of the Devil", while Alan Rogerson notes that he was a [...] "dogmatic and insensitive person, obsessed with his own self-importance." ...|$|E
