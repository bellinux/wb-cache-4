5|$|Acton's severe {{judgement}} did {{not deter}} Waugh from {{his intention to}} be a writer, but it affected his belief that he could <b>succeed</b> <b>as</b> a novelist. For a time {{he turned his attention}} away from fiction, but with the gradual recovery of his self-confidence he was able to complete his first novel, Decline and Fall, which was published with great success in 1928.|$|E
5|$|For two years, Hand {{tried to}} <b>succeed</b> <b>as</b> a lawyer {{by force of}} will, giving all his time to the practice. By 1900, he was deeply {{dissatisfied}} with his progress. For intellectual stimulation, he increasingly looked outside his daily work. He wrote scholarly articles, taught part-time at Albany Law School, and joined a lawyers' discussion group in New York City. He also developed an interest in politics.|$|E
5|$|Grissom may not ask {{to take on}} {{the role}} of mentor, but it seems to happen naturally, going {{all the way back to}} Sara Sidle when they first met in San Francisco, then Nick Stokes and Greg Sanders in Vegas. Although he can be annoyed with his protégés at times, he is visibly proud when they <b>succeed,</b> <b>as</b> Greg did by passing his field test and {{becoming}} a CSI. He is also protective of his staff and defends them as much as he can, as seen in episode 521 ("Rashomama") for example.|$|E

5|$|A new, {{permanent}} job with Trinidad Leaseholds allowed Constantine {{to devote more}} time to cricket. Constantine realised that to <b>succeed</b> <b>as</b> a professional cricketer, he needed to improve; his bowling lacked true speed and, when batting, he was often dismissed playing shots that were too adventurous. After his relative failure in 1926, he increased his level of practice, improved his fitness and trained to become a slip fielder to conserve his energies for genuine fast bowling. In the trial matches before the 1928 tour of England, Constantine secured his place on the tour by taking five for 32 and scoring 63. He left behind his wife Norma, whom he had married in 1927, and his newly-born daughter.|$|E
5|$|Educator Daniel Challener, in his 1997 book Stories of Resilience in Childhood, {{analyzed}} {{the events in}} Caged Bird to illustrate resiliency in children. Challener states that Angelou's book provides a useful framework for exploring the obstacles many children like Maya face and how a community helps these children <b>succeed</b> <b>as</b> Angelou did. Psychologist Chris Boyatzis has used Caged Bird to supplement scientific theory and research in the instruction of child development topics such as the development of self-concept and self-esteem, ego resilience, industry versus inferiority, effects of abuse, parenting styles, sibling and friendship relations, gender issues, cognitive development, puberty, and identity formation in adolescence. He has called the book a highly effective tool for providing real-life examples of these psychological concepts.|$|E
5|$|Edward I of England had a {{great number}} of {{children}} with his first wife, Eleanor of Castile, but only one son who survived into adulthood – the future Edward II (b. 1284). After Eleanor died, the king married Margaret of France, with whom he had two children: Thomas (b. 1300) and, when the king was sixty-two, Edmund. Edmund was born at Woodstock in Oxfordshire on 5 August 1301, and was therefore referred to as Edmund of Woodstock. Son of the English king, he was also, through his mother, grandson of Philip III of France. On 7 July 1307, before Edmund had turned six, King Edward I died, leaving Edmund's half-brother Edward to <b>succeed</b> <b>as</b> King Edward II.|$|E

5|$|Georgi Kinkladze {{was born}} on 6 July 1973 in Tbilisi, Georgia, which was then part of the Soviet Union. As a child, {{he lived in the}} Didube {{district}} of the city with his father, Robinzon (an engineer), his mother Khatuna (a teacher) and his elder sister. Robinzon was keen to see his son <b>succeed</b> <b>as</b> a footballer, sometimes making him walk around the family home on his knees to strengthen his legs, and enrolled him for Dinamo Tbilisi's junior side when he was six years old. Khatuna disapproved of some of her husband's methods, instead taking Georgi to lessons in mtiuluri, a traditional Georgian ballet. Over the next few years, Kinkladze played in Dinamo Tbilisi's youth teams, progressing as far as the reserve team, where he played alongside Shota Arveladze, who would later become his teammate at both senior and international level.|$|E
5|$|He won a {{government}} {{scholarship to the}} University of Melbourne and Queen's College, a university residential college. Woodruff studied electrical engineering and mathematics, receiving some instruction from the influential physicist Harrie Massey, then a tutor. Despite success in engineering, Woodruff {{decided that he would}} have weak prospects as an engineer in Australia because of the Great Depression. He decided to take up medical studies {{at the end of his}} third year of undergraduate study, but his parents wanted him to finish his degree first. Despite his fears regarding his ability to <b>succeed</b> <b>as</b> an engineer, Woodruff placed first in his graduating class with first-class honours. He also completed two years of the maths program with first-class honours.|$|E
5|$|Barton pursued {{his dreams}} of {{becoming}} a professional footballer by joining Everton's youth system, but played for Liverpool when he was 14. He underwent trials at Nottingham Forest, but was rejected when it was decided he {{was too small to}} become a footballer. Barton said his rejection by clubs only made him more determined to <b>succeed</b> <b>as</b> a footballer and prove his detractors wrong. He made his first appearance for Manchester City's under-17s team in 1999 and played regularly at Academy level for three years. His first reserve team appearance came {{at the end of the}} 2000–01 season, in his final year as a trainee. Uncertain about Barton's future prospects, the club planned to release him, but reconsidered and gave him his first professional contract in the close season. Over the next two years, he successfully made the transition from the under-19s to regular reserve football. He was promoted to the first-team squad in the 2002–03 season.|$|E

5|$|By {{the early}} 1750s, even {{the roof of}} Ardincaple Castle, seat of the clan chief, had fallen in. The overall {{condition}} of the castle had deteriorated {{to such an extent}} that the next laird was forced to abandon it and live in nearby Laggarie. The bulk of the Ardincaple estate ultimately passed into the hands of John Campbell, 4th Duke of Argyll. The last chief of the MacAulays, Aulay MacAulay, died at High Laggarie (now encompassed by the tiny village of Rhu) landless and without an heir to <b>succeed</b> <b>as</b> chief in about 1767. In 1794, Lord Frederick Campbell (brother of John, 5th Duke of Argyll) supervised the draining of the marsh and bog-ridden former lands of the Lairds of Ardincaple. The poor state of the lands of Ardincaple before that year is illustrated in the statement by George Campbell, 8th Duke of Argyll: that much of the land could not bear the weight of a cow, and local men of the time remembered when horses would be lost in the bogholes prevalent in the area.|$|E
5|$|On 23 October 1862, Otto of Bavaria, King of Greece was deposed in a bloodless coup. The Greeks {{were eager}} to have someone close to Britain and Queen Victoria replace Otto; some desired to allow Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh (her second son) <b>succeed</b> <b>as</b> King of Greece. He was elected with 95% {{of the vote in}} the Greek head of state {{referendum}} of 1862. After his ineligibility was confirmed however, the Greeks began looking for other possible candidates, which included Duke Ernest at the British government's suggestion. To their and Victoria's reasoning, if Ernest were to take the Greek throne, Alfred could immediately take up his inheritance and succeed Ernest as duke (the Prince of Wales having passed his claim to the duchy of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha onto his younger brother). Many were in favor of his nomination, including Prime Minister Lord Palmerston and Ernest's sister-in-law. In a letter written to her uncle Leopold I of Belgium, Victoria stated her support for a new royal branch of the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha (as Leopold had been chosen as King of the Belgians in 1831) as well as her desire for her second son Alfred to succeed his uncle in the duchy. As negotiations continued however, she began to lose enthusiasm for the idea.|$|E
5|$|Speedie {{grew up in}} Utah, {{where he}} overcame Perthes Disease to become a {{standout}} as a hurdler on his high school track team and a halfback on the football team. He attended the University of Utah, where he continued to excel at track and football before entering the military in 1942 during World War II. He spent {{four years in the}} service before joining the Browns in 1946, where he played as an end opposite quarterback Otto Graham, fullback Marion Motley and fellow receiver Dante Lavelli. The Browns, a new team in the AAFC, won the league championship every year between 1946 and 1949. The Browns merged into the NFL in 1950 after the AAFC disbanded, and Speedie continued to <b>succeed</b> <b>as</b> the team won another league championship. After two more years with the Browns, however, Speedie left the team for the Western Interprovincial Football Union (WIFU) amid a conflict with Paul Brown, Cleveland's head coach. He played two full seasons in the WIFU and one game in a third season before leaving professional football.|$|E

5|$|The Ottoman-Albanian war {{continued}} through 1465 with Ballaban Badera meeting Skanderbeg at Vaikal, Meçad, Vaikal again, and Kashari. In the meantime, Mehmed continued to negotiate peace with Hungary and Venice. Skanderbeg found himself isolated during these negotiations, {{even if they}} did not <b>succeed,</b> <b>as</b> the conflicting powers temporarily ceased conflict. Furthermore, Ferdinand I of Naples did not send his promised forces and the Venetian forces under Cimarosto left Albania. During the autumn of 1465, Ottoman forces moved from the Morea and Bosnia in order to speed up the peace negotiations. Venice, however, refused peace and Skanderbeg believed that a new Albanian-Venetian campaign would begin. He kept Pal Engjëlli, his ambassador, in constant correspondence with the Signoria (Venetian Senate), which sent him to Albania to inform Skanderbeg that troops were being raised, although only 300 had been recruited at the time, with Cimarosto as the commander. Venice was also in the process of sending its provveditores in Albania Veneta 3,000 ducats to recruit men. They would also send four cannons, ten springalds, and ten barrels of gunpowder. Throughout April, rumors spread that the Ottomans were preparing to march into Albania. By 18 April 1466, Venice received knowledge that the Ottomans were heading towards Albania.|$|E
5|$|The forward {{troops of}} the German and Ottoman rearguard, which held a front of about , were driven back to Bir el Abd by the New Zealanders. At this time, the attackers {{appeared}} likely to <b>succeed,</b> <b>as</b> they had firmly established themselves across the telegraph line and the old caravan road, supported by the Somerset and Leicester batteries. But the German, Austrian and Ottoman rearguard quickly realised how thin the attacking line was, and at 09:00 advanced out of their trenches to counterattack. This aggressive move was only checked by artillery fire from the Somerset Battery effectively combined with fire from machine guns. The subsequent fire fight made it extremely difficult for the mounted riflemen to maintain their position, and on the flanks the light horse were also held up. The German and Ottoman infantry renewed their attack towards {{a gap between the}} New Zealanders and the 2nd Light Horse Brigade, but the 5th Light Horse Regiment covered the gap, and the German and Ottoman advance was halted.|$|E
