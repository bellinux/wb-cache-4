25|$|One Heaver-bodied {{coach for}} City Coach Company, Romford and two deck {{and a half}} airport coaches bodied by the Northern Ireland Road Transport Board for their own use were built to a twin-steering three-axle {{specification}} with the second <b>steering</b> <b>axle,</b> which had 17-inch rather than 21-inch wheels, designed to be readily removed once 30ft length on two axles was legal. City had pre-war operated the largest fleet of the Leyland Gnu twin-steering single decker, switching to them from conventional six-wheeled Tigers.|$|E
500|$|The federal {{gross weight}} limit for a Class 8 truck is [...] (combined weight of truck, trailer, and cargo) with axle weights limited to [...] (<b>steering</b> <b>axle)</b> and [...] (tandem axles). Truck drivers are {{responsible}} for checking their own vehicle's weight, usually by paying to be weighed at a truck stop scale. CMVs are subject to various state and federal laws regarding limitations on truck length (measured from bumper to bumper), and truck axle length (measured from axle to axle, or fifth wheel kingpin to axle for trailers). The relationship between axle weight and spacing, known as the Federal Bridge Gross Weight Formula, is designed to protect bridges. Truck weights and sizes are checked by state authorities at a weigh station or port-of-entry.|$|E

50|$|The {{driven axles}} for the {{container}} handling equipment are with planetary reduction. The single non-steering axle capacity is 30-32 tonnes; the tandem applications are rated to 26-41 tonnes. The driven <b>steering</b> <b>axles</b> are with 12-18 tonnes capacity and the non-driven option is only available with 10 tonnes capacity. S-cam and disc brakes are applied on both <b>steering</b> and non-steering <b>axles,</b> the heavier <b>steering</b> driven option being fitted with wedge brakes.|$|R

50|$|The {{models with}} driven tandem axle are {{equipped}} with a power disengagement possibility of the posterior axle and the Vanaja lifting tandem system. The previously used mechanical steering of the second <b>steering</b> <b>axle</b> is replaced by an electro-hydraulic steering system.|$|E
50|$|Sisu Axles' core {{business}} are planetary reduction axles but also non-driven <b>steering</b> <b>axles</b> are produced. Both {{the front and}} rear axles are for single and multi axle applications. The main segments are heavy-duty trucks for on- and off-road use and also industrial and military applications.|$|R
50|$|Road {{damage and}} wear {{increase}} very rapidly with the axle weight. The number of <b>steering</b> <b>axles</b> and the suspension type also influence {{the amount of}} the road wear. In many countries with good roads a six-axle truck may have a maximum weight of 44 t or more.|$|R
5000|$|The Bedford VAL {{is a type}} {{of coach}} chassis that was built by Bedford in the United Kingdom from the mid-1960s to the early 1970s. It was unusual at the time for its multi-axle design, in a [...] "chinese six" [...] wheelplan, i.e. with two front <b>steering</b> <b>axles.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{most common}} tractor-cab layout has a forward engine, one <b>steering</b> <b>axle,</b> and two drive axles. The fifth-wheel trailer {{coupling}} on most tractor trucks is movable fore and aft, to allow adjustment {{in the weight}} distribution over its rear axle(s).|$|E
50|$|In 1898 La société Korn et Latil {{was founded}} by the {{engineer}} Georges Latil and the mechanic Alois Korn in Marseille. They invented a system that could easily replace the <b>steering</b> <b>axle</b> part of horse towed wagons by a fully motorised part.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{analyses}} {{the operating}} principle of Steady-state Cornering of semitrailer with trailer <b>axle</b> <b>steering</b> mechanism。Analytical method was used for kinematics analysis on trailer <b>axle</b> <b>steering</b> mechanism based on the preceding analysis result. trailer <b>axle</b> <b>steering</b> mechanism was simplified into a five-bar linkage mechanism. Constraint conditions of the five-bar linkage mechanism were discussed based on its actual installing space. Accordingly, size ranges of the critical components of trailer <b>axle</b> <b>steering</b> mechanism were obtained, providing conditions for further study on semitrailer dynamics. ...|$|R
50|$|The {{coach at}} the end of the film was a 1964 Bedford VAL with Harrington Legionnaire Body, {{distinctive}} for its twin front <b>steering</b> <b>axles.</b> Following the filming, the coach had its improvised rear doors welded and was used on a Scottish school bus route until the mid-1980s when, according to the Legionnaire register, it was scrapped.|$|R
50|$|In 1956, the International Harvester company {{introduced}} the Payhauler line of heavy duty off-highway rear-dump trucks, initially {{available as a}} 25-ton (23t) capacity rear-wheel-drive model. Unlike other haul trucks it had dual tires on the front (<b>steering)</b> <b>axle</b> and carried the load with the same weight on both axles. Early models had a Detroit Diesel 16V71 engine, later Cummins engines were used.|$|E
50|$|Although capable for its day, the Hathi was {{a complex}} and {{expensive}} vehicle that required regular maintenance if the front axle was to remain reliable. For most purposes it was soon replaced by 6×4 lorries with just as many driven wheels, but {{without the need for}} the complex combined driving and <b>steering</b> <b>axle.</b> Even half-tracks, particularly the Kégresse system, were more popular in this period.|$|E
50|$|Already {{since the}} 1950s SAT had {{negotiated}} with the authorities for allowing four-axle lorries with two steering axles in road transportation. Such layout had already been used in mobile cranes since the late 1960s. At the end of 1978 the Ministry of Transport finally allowed also such lorries. The first homologated four-axle lorry in Finland was Sisu M-168 of which second <b>steering</b> <b>axle</b> {{was the same as}} used in Sisu T-108 mobile crane.|$|E
50|$|BeiBen Axle factory {{produces}} Mercedes-Benz licensed axles for {{the heavy}} duty trucks. Axle models include the planetary hub-reduction axles HL-7/HD-7, and the <b>steering</b> <b>axles</b> VL-4. These axles are well reputed throughout China, Malaysia, Indonesia, South America, South Africa for its robustness and high loading capacity and durability. These axles are in turn used by other truck manufacturers in China as well.|$|R
40|$|In {{the field}} of vehicle dynamics, {{commercial}} software can aid the designer during the conceptual and detailed design phases. Simulations using these tools can quickly provide specific design metrics, such as yaw and lateral velocity, for standard maneuvers. However, it remains challenging to correlate these metrics with empirical quantities that depend on many external parameters and design specifications. This scenario {{is the case with}} tire wear, which depends on the frictional work developed by the tire-road contact. In this study, an approach is proposed to estimate the tire-road friction during steady-state longitudinal and cornering maneuvers. Using this approach, a qualitative formula for tire wear evaluation is developed, and conceptual design analyses of cornering maneuvers are performed using simplified vehicle models. The influence of some design parameters such as cornering stiffness, the distance between the axles, and the steer angle ratio between the <b>steering</b> <b>axles</b> for vehicles with two <b>steering</b> <b>axles</b> is evaluated. The proposed methodology allows the designer to predict tire wear using simplified vehicle models during the conceptual design phase...|$|R
25|$|For {{the first}} time the Panorama was offered on all chassis types, {{including}} Ford R226 and Bedford VAL, looking particularly well-suited to the latter, where the chrome trim on the first window bay harmonised with the twin <b>steering</b> <b>axles</b> below. There was even a Panorama for the Bedford SB and Ford Thames 570E, although here the thickened window pillar was absent, and the chrome trim did not extend across the front of the vehicle.|$|R
50|$|AutoTURN 5.0’s {{release in}} 2004, {{among many other}} functions, {{introduced}} Heuristic algorithms for tracking, creation of simulations on spline elements, and improved layer management for simulations. The standard vehicle library file was changed to a searchable database of vehicles based on international or custom standards. Adding to those features AutoTURN 5.1 introduces the ability to set Steering Linkage ratios between {{the front and rear}} <b>steering</b> <b>axle</b> groups. Additionally, in the 5.1 version could continuously loop simulations.|$|E
50|$|In both {{road and}} rail vehicles, the {{wheelbase}} is {{the distance between}} the centers of the front and rear wheels. For road vehicles with more than two axles (e.g. some trucks), the wheelbase is defined as {{the distance between the}} steering (front) axle and the centerpoint of the driving axle group. In the case of a tri-axle truck, the wheelbase would be the distance between the <b>steering</b> <b>axle</b> and a point midway between the two rear axles.|$|E
50|$|Load {{capacity}} {{is the amount}} of weight a wheel will carry. This number will vary depending on the number of lugs, the PCD, the material used and the type of axle the wheel is used on. A wheel used on a free rolling trailer axle will carry more weight than that same wheel used on the drive or <b>steering</b> <b>axle</b> of a vehicle. All wheels will have the load capacity stamped {{on the back of the}} wheel.|$|E
50|$|The axles are {{produced}} by Sisu <b>Axles.</b> The <b>steering</b> front <b>axles</b> are type FSND-10-P with maximum ten tonnes capacity and disc brakes.|$|R

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} features of motor vehicles is their steering maneuverability. Ways of determining single <b>axle</b> <b>steering</b> are well known. This paper presents an idea of how to determine maneuverability of motor vehicles with two <b>steering</b> <b>axles.</b> The concept makes use of elements of kinematic analysis as well as of a 3 D model of the steering system. It is based on the theoretical analysis {{of the most}} unfavorable situations, such as parallel and perpendicular parking techniques, on the basis of which wheel-steering angles are specified. As a result, it was possible to create a 3 D model to simulate the actual operation of the steering system. This made it possible to compare the theoretical approach with the actual system design. ...|$|R
50|$|In the United States most {{standard}} dump trucks have one front <b>steering</b> <b>axle</b> and one (4x2 4-wheeler)) or two (6x4 6-wheeler) rear axles which typically have dual wheels on each side. Tandem rear axles {{are almost always}} powered, front steering axles are also sometimes powered (4x4, 6x6). Unpowered axles are sometimes used to support extra weight. Most unpowered rear axles can be raised off the ground to minimize wear when the truck is empty or lightly loaded, and are commonly called “lift axles”.|$|E

5000|$|European Union heavy trucks {{often have}} two {{steering}} axles. Dump truck configurations are 2, 3 and 4 axles. The 4-axle eight wheeler has two steering axles {{at the front}} and two powered axles at the rear and is limited to 32 t gross weight in most EU countries. The largest of the standard European dump trucks is commonly called a [...] "centipede" [...] and has seven axles. The front axle is the <b>steering</b> <b>axle,</b> the rear two axles are powered, and the remaining four are lift axles.|$|E
50|$|For {{military}} applications {{the selection}} includes both conventional rigid axles {{as well as}} independent suspension systems, all of them being driven with planetary reduction. Both the steering and non-steering rigid axles are with 10-14 tonnes capacities and the tandem applications with double capacity, 20-28 tonnes. The brakes used on rigid axles are predominantly S-cam type; the heavier <b>steering</b> <b>axles</b> are equipped with wedge brakes. The independent suspension systems are for 6×6, 8×8 and 10×10 layouts with 6 to 8 tonnes capacity per axle. The brakes are either disc or wedge type.|$|R
50|$|Allvelo (Allmänna Velocipedförsäljnings AB) was {{a company}} founded by Fritiof Karlström in Landskrona, Sweden. The company began by {{importing}} bicycles, but soon decided to purchase unassembled Waltham Orient buckboards from the United States. These they assembled and sold as All-Velos under the names Allvelo Orient and Allvelo Pansarmobil Sport. All told, probably around 50 were assembled. Most parts {{other than the}} <b>steering,</b> <b>axles,</b> and engines were of wood. Each car had a single-cylinder air-cooled engine mounted at the rear, with friction drive. Brakes were fitted on the right rear wheel only, and the cars had tiller steering.|$|R
