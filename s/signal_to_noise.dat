Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) {{is a popular}} method for high data rate wireless transmission. OFDM may be combined with antenna arrays at the transmitter and receiver to increase the diversity gain and enhance the system capacity on time variant and frequency selective channels, resulting in Multi-Input Multi-Output (MIMO) configuration. This paper explores varies physical layer research challenges in MIMO-OFDM system design including channel modeling, space time block code techniques, channel estimation and signal processing algorithms used for performing time and frequency synchronization in MIMO-OFDM system.

25|$|Also in 1991, Georges Cornuéjols {{introduced}} the HDR+ image principle by non-linear accumulation of images {{to increase the}} sensitivity of the camera: for low-light environments, several successive images are accumulated, thus increasing the <b>signal</b> <b>to</b> <b>noise</b> ratio.|$|E
25|$|Spatially encoded {{frequency}} domain OCT (SEFD-OCT, spectral domain or Fourier domain OCT) extracts spectral information by distributing different optical frequencies onto a detector stripe (line-array CCD or CMOS) via a dispersive element (see Fig. 4). Thereby the information {{of the full}} depth scan can be acquired within a single exposure. However, the large <b>signal</b> <b>to</b> <b>noise</b> advantage of FD-OCT is reduced due to the lower dynamic range of stripe detectors with respect to single photosensitive diodes, resulting in an SNR (<b>signal</b> <b>to</b> <b>noise</b> ratio) advantage of ~10 dB at much higher speeds.

25|$|The {{governor}} received {{relatively little}} scientific attention until James Clerk Maxwell published a paper that established {{the beginning of}} a theoretical basis for understanding control theory. Development of the electronic amplifier during the 1920s, which was important for long distance telephony, required a higher <b>signal</b> <b>to</b> <b>noise</b> ratio, which was solved by negative feedback noise cancellation. This and other telephony applications contributed to control theory. In the 1940s and 1950s, German mathematician Irmgard Flugge-Lotz developed the theory of discontinuous automatic controls, which found military applications during the Second World War to fire control systems and aircraft navigation systems.|$|E

25|$|As {{previously}} mentioned an EPR spectra is usually directly measured {{as the first}} derivative of the absorption. This is accomplished by using field modulation. A small additional oscillating magnetic field {{is applied to the}} external magnetic field at a typical frequency of 100kHz. By detecting the peak to peak amplitude the first derivative of the absorption is measured. By using phase sensitive detection only signals with the same modulation (100kHz) are detected. This results in higher <b>signal</b> <b>to</b> <b>noise</b> ratios. Note field modulation is unique to continuous wave EPR measurements and spectra resulting from pulsed experiments are presented as absorption profiles.|$|E
25|$|In {{frequency}} domain OCT (FD-OCT) the broadband interference is acquired with spectrally separated detectors (either by encoding the optical frequency {{in time with}} a spectrally scanning source or with a dispersive detector, like a grating and a linear detector array). Due to the Fourier relation (Wiener-Khintchine theorem between the auto correlation and the spectral power density) the depth scan can be immediately calculated by a Fourier-transform from the acquired spectra, without movement of the reference arm. This feature improves imaging speed dramatically, while the reduced losses during a single scan improve the <b>signal</b> <b>to</b> <b>noise</b> ratio proportional {{to the number of}} detection elements. The parallel detection at multiple wavelength ranges limits the scanning range, while the full spectral bandwidth sets the axial resolution.|$|E
25|$|The HDD's {{electronics}} {{control the}} movement of the actuator and the rotation of the disk, and perform reads and writes on demand from the disk controller.

The servo feedback optimizes the <b>signal</b> <b>to</b> <b>noise</b> ratio of the GMR sensors by adjusting the voice-coil of the actuated arm. The spinning of the disk also uses a servo motor.

25|$|Most older {{hearing aids}} have only an {{omnidirectional}} microphone. An omnidirectional microphone amplifies sounds equally from all directions. In contrast, a directional microphone amplifies sounds from one direction more than sounds from other directions. This means that sounds originating {{from the direction}} the system is steered toward are amplified more than sounds coming from other directions. If the desired speech arrives {{from the direction of}} steering and the noise is from a different direction, then compared to an omnidirectional microphone, a directional microphone provides a better <b>signal</b> <b>to</b> <b>noise</b> ratio. Improving the signal-to-noise ratio improves speech understanding in noise. Directional microphones {{have been found to be}} the second best method to improve the signal-to-noise ratio (the best method was an FM system, which locates the microphone near the mouth of the desired talker).|$|E
25|$|As {{bit cell}} size decreases, more {{data can be}} put onto a single drive platter. In 2013, a {{production}} desktop 3TB HDD (with four platters) would have had an areal density of about 500Gbit/in2 which would have amounted to a bit cell comprising about 18 magnetic grains (11 by 1.6 grains). Since the mid-2000s areal density progress has increasingly been challenged by a superparamagnetic trilemma involving grain size, grain magnetic strength and ability of the head to write. In order to maintain acceptable <b>signal</b> <b>to</b> <b>noise</b> smaller grains are required; smaller grains may self-reverse (electrothermal instability) unless their magnetic strength is increased, but known write head materials are unable to generate a magnetic field sufficient to write the medium. Several new magnetic storage technologies are being developed to overcome or at least abate this trilemma and thereby maintain the competitiveness of HDDs with respect to products such as flash memory-based solid-state drives (SSDs).|$|E
500|$|Particular {{attention}} has been paid to the function of dopamine in the mesolimbic pathway of the brain. This focus largely resulted from the accidental finding that phenothiazine drugs, which block dopamine function, could reduce psychotic symptoms. It is also supported by the fact that amphetamines, which trigger the release of dopamine, may exacerbate the psychotic symptoms in schizophrenia. The influential dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia proposed that excessive activation of D2 receptors was the cause of (the positive symptoms of) schizophrenia. Although postulated for about 20years based on the D2 blockade effect common to all antipsychotics, it was not until the mid-1990s that PET and SPET imaging studies provided supporting evidence. While dopamine D2/D3 receptors are elevated in schizophrenia, the effect size is small, and only evident in medication naive schizophrenics. On the other hand, presynaptic dopamine metabolism and released is elevated despite no difference in dopamine transporter. The altered synthesis of dopamine in the nigrostriatal system have been confirmed in several human studies. Hypoactivity of dopamine D1 receptor activation in the prefrontal cortex has also been observed. [...] The hyperactivity of D2 receptor stimulation and relative hypoactivity of D1 receptor stimulation is thought to contribute to cognitive dysfunction by disrupting <b>signal</b> <b>to</b> <b>noise</b> ratio in cortical microcircuits. [...] The dopamine hypothesis is now thought to be simplistic, partly because newer antipsychotic medication (atypical antipsychotic medication) can be just as effective as older medication (typical antipsychotic medication), but also affects serotonin function and may have slightly less of a dopamine blocking effect.|$|E
