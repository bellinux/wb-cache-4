40|$|Abstract Low-amplitude “soft song ” {{is used by}} {{a variety}} of songbirds; in some species during {{aggressive}} encounters, in others during courtship, and yet others in both these contexts. In <b>song</b> <b>sparrows</b> (Melospiza melodia), soft song has thus far been observed only in aggressive encounters, where its production is a more reliable predictor of attack than any other signaling behavior. We used song playback to test the response of both male and female <b>song</b> <b>sparrows</b> to soft <b>song.</b> The design of the playback experiments took into account the existence of two classes of soft song: crystallized soft song, which consists of song types also found in the broadcast repertoire, and warbled soft song, which consists of less-structured song types not found in the broadcast repertoire. Female <b>song</b> <b>sparrows</b> responded with significantly less courtship display to the playback of crystallized soft song than to that of normal broadcast song, and response to warbled soft song was if anything lower than to that of crystallized soft <b>song.</b> Male <b>song</b> <b>sparrows</b> responded equally aggressively to normal broadcast song as to crystallized soft song, and equally aggressively to warbled soft song as to crystallized soft song. The female results support the conclusion that neither form of soft song functions in courtship. The male results suggest that the reliability of soft song as a signal of aggressive intent is not maintained by a receiver retaliation rule...|$|R
40|$|Male <b>song</b> <b>sparrows</b> sing {{repertoires}} of 4 – 13 distinct song {{types and}} have proved a valuable model for testing hypotheses concerning the function {{and evolution of}} song complexity. Captive female <b>song</b> <b>sparrows</b> solicit more copulations in response to playback of larger repertoires, yet it remains unclear whether male repertoire size influences female mate choice in natural situations. We used long-term data from free-living <b>song</b> <b>sparrows</b> inhabiting Mandarte Island, British Columbia, Canada, to investigate whether male song repertoire size predicted three components of reproductive performance during the first year: territory acquisition, mating success and laying date. Across males whose song was recorded, males with larger repertoires were not more likely to acquire a territory, to acquire a larger territory or to settle sooner. However, after we controlled for territory size and between-year variation in the population sex ratio, first-year males with larger repertoires {{were more likely to}} mate. This was because {{they were more likely to}} pair with newly settled females, not because they were more likely to acquire territories where older females were already resident. After we controlled for territory size and between-year variation in breeding date, newly settled females laid earlier when mated with males with larger repertoires. Together with the results of previous mate choice experiments, these patterns are consistent with the hypothesis that male song repertoire size is a sexually selected trait that influences female mate choice in <b>song</b> <b>sparrows...</b>|$|R
2500|$|The {{challenge}} hypothesis {{outlines the}} dynamic relationship between plasma testosterone levels and aggression in mating contexts in many species. It proposes that testosterone {{is linked to}} aggression when it is beneficial for reproduction, such as in mate guarding and preventing the encroachment of intrasexual rivals. The challenge hypothesis predicts that seasonal patterns in testosterone levels in a species are a function of mating system (monogamy versus polygyny), paternal care, and male-male aggression in seasonal breeders. This pattern between testosterone and aggression was first observed in seasonally breeding birds, such as the <b>song</b> <b>sparrow,</b> where testosterone levels rise modestly {{with the onset of}} the breeding season to support basic reproductive functions. The hypothesis has been subsequently expanded and modified to predict relationships between testosterone and aggression in other species. For example, chimpanzees, which are continuous breeders, show significantly raised testosterone levels and aggressive male-male interactions when receptive and fertile females are present. [...] Currently, no research has specified a relationship between the modified challenge hypothesis and human behavior, or the human nature of concealed ovulation, although some suggest it may apply.|$|E

40|$|Upon {{hearing a}} conspecific signal, animals must assess their {{relationship}} with the signaller and respond appropriately. Territorial animals usually respond more aggressively to strangers than neighbors in a phenomenon known as the “dear enemy effect”. This phenomenon likely evolved because strangers represent a threat to an animal 2 ̆ 7 s territory tenure and parentage, whereas neighbors only represent a threat to an animal 2 ̆ 7 s parentage because they already possess a territory (providing territory boundaries are established and stable). Although the dear enemy effect has been widely documented using behavioral response variables, little research has been conducted on the physiological responses of animals to neighbors versus strangers. We sought to investigate whether the dear enemy effect is observed physiologically by exposing territorial male <b>song</b> <b>sparrows</b> (Melospiza melodia) to playback simulating a neighbor or a stranger, and then collecting blood samples to measure plasma testosterone levels. We predicted that <b>song</b> <b>sparrows</b> would exhibit increased testosterone levels after exposure to stranger playback compared to neighbor playback, due to the role testosterone plays in regulating aggression. Contrary to our prediction, we found that <b>song</b> <b>sparrows</b> had higher testosterone levels after exposure to neighbor playback compared to stranger playback. We discuss several explanations for our result, notably that corticosterone may regulate the dear enemy effect in male <b>song</b> <b>sparrows</b> and this may inhibit plasma testosterone. Future studies will benefit from examining corticosterone in addition to testosterone, to better understand the hormonal underpinnings of the dear enemy effect. © 2017 Elsevier Inc...|$|R
5000|$|Large song {{repertoires}} are {{preferred by}} females of many avian species. [...] One hypothesis {{for this is}} that song repertoire is positively correlated with the size of the brain’s song control nucleus (HVC). A large HVC would indicate developmental success.

This supports the idea that <b>song</b> <b>sparrows</b> with large <b>song</b> repertoires have better lifetime fitness and that song repertoires are honest indicators of the males [...] "quality."

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 1999 During song learning, songbirds {{are exposed}} to many more songs then they keep for their final song {{repertoire}} and {{little is known about}} how or why a bird selects the particular songs he sings as an adult. These studies examine the social and ecological factors that influence song learning and repertoire development in a sedentary Washington population of <b>song</b> <b>sparrows</b> (Melospiza melodia). In the first study, I examined the song repertoires of an entire cohort of males and compared them to those of potential song tutors. I found that a young male (1) learns whole song types, (2) learns songs from multiple tutors who were neighbors in his first year, (3) establishes a territory among or near these tutors, and (4) learns more songs from tutors who survive the winter. In the second study, I attempted to replicate in the laboratory the key variables of the natural song learning environment by exposing hand-reared male <b>song</b> <b>sparrows</b> to live adult tutors. Results from this experiment confirmed findings from the field study. In addition, this experiment showed that (1) interactions with a close neighbor after the natal summer affect song learning and (2) males preferentially learn songs that are shared among their tutors and other males in their same age cohort. In the third study, I examined whether <b>song</b> <b>sparrows</b> were capable of acquiring new songs after their presumed sensitive period for song memorization (30 [...] 90 days of age) by exposing them to new tutors after their natal summer. Eight of 12 subjects learned songs from tutors they only heard after 140 days of age, and six subjects learned most of their songs from a late tutor. Thus, <b>song</b> <b>sparrows</b> are capable of acquiring many songs de novo in late fall, and may be capable of acquiring songs even later. Taken together, these studies demonstrate that young male <b>song</b> <b>sparrows</b> have a <b>song</b> learning strategy that provides them with a repertoire of song types they will share with their neighbors in their first-breeding season and that social interactions after the natal summer are crucial to song repertoire development...|$|R

We used radio telemetry to observe social associations of young male <b>song</b> <b>sparrows</b> (Melospiza melodia) from May to November. Juvenile <b>song</b> <b>sparrows</b> were frequently observed in social flocks and generally associated with more birds in the summer than in the autumn months.
