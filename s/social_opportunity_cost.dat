Socially optimal policy choices require an appropriate choice of discount rate. This paper assesses the applicability of the two key theoretical approaches to selecting discount rates in the public sector. The two key theoretical approaches considered are the social rate of time preference and the <b>social</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>cost.</b> Estimation issues in determining the rate using these two approaches are reviewed. The social rate of time preference is considered to be the appropriate approach. When estimates of the social rate of time preference are unavailable or clearly unreliable and the Government is considering financing a project, the <b>social</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>cost</b> should be used.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} a {{collection}} of three essays on entry regulation, institutions, and development. Chapter 1 examines the effect of a business registration reform in Mexico on economic activity. This reform made registration procedures less complex and was implemented in different municipalities at different points in time, allowing for identification. I find that the reform increased the number of registered businesses in eligible industries. This increase was due to former wage earners opening businesses. Former unregistered business owners were not more likely to register their business after the reform. The results also show an increase in employment in eligible industries. Moreover, they indicate that the competition from new entrants lowered prices and decreased the income of incumbent businesses. Chapter 2, coauthored with Francisco Gallego, argues that within country variation in economic development across the Americas can be explained by differences in institutions that have their roots in the colonial era. Colonizers engaged in different economic activities in different regions of a country, depending on the local conditions and the supply of native labor. Some activities where "bad" since they created extractive institutions, while "good" activities created inclusive institutions. We show that areas with bad colonial activities have lower GDP per capita today than other areas. Areas with high pre-colonial population density also have lower GDP per capita today. The intermediating factor between history and current development appears to be institutions and not income inequality or the share of ethnic minorities. (cont.) Chapter 3 uses the example of Mexico's Progresa and Microrregion programs to illustrate that one can arrive at very different conclusions about the relative cost-effectiveness of public development programs, depending on the assumptions made about <b>social</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>costs.</b> For Progresa, I estimate the amount of US$ required to save one life per 1000 live births to be 14. 1. For the Microrregion Program, this number could fall anywhere between 7. 6 and 29.

Other consumers may discover that their initial proposals were too modest, and can revise their consumption upwards, if they choose, or they can revise their projected effort rating downwards by proposing to work fewer hours and increasing leisure time.|$|R
40|$|When a new {{facility}} like a grocery store, a school, or a fire station is planned, its location should ideally {{be determined by the}} necessities of people who live nearby. Empirically, it has been found that there exists a positive correlation between facility and population densities. In the present work, we investigate the ideal relation between the population and the facility densities within the framework of an economic mechanism governing microdynamics. In previous studies based on the global optimization of facility positions in minimizing the overall travel distance between people and facilities, it was shown that the density of facility D and that of population ρ should follow a simple power law D ∼ ρ 2 / 3. In our empirical analysis, on the other hand, the power-law exponent α in D ∼ ρα is not a fixed value but spreads in a broad range depending on facility types. To explain this discrepancy in α, we propose a model based on economic mechanisms that mimic the competitive balance between the profit of the facilities and the <b>social</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>cost</b> for populations. Through our simple, microscopically driven model, we show that commercial facilities driven by the profit of the facilities have α = 1, whereas public facilities driven by the <b>social</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>cost</b> have α = 2 / 3.

40|$|When {{conducting}} {{valuation of}} investment in the public sphere, we must {{pay attention to the}} whole spectrum of economic disciplines. In our business practice we may in this area encounter many irrational opinions, out of line with the contemporary economy theory. To increase the effectiveness of public investment decision-making, we must qualify many business and public sphere organizations, and provide them with quality, conflict-free framework for evaluation of public projects. The point of this project is not the maximizing of shareholder value, but rather growth of the society welfare via the most advantageous allocation of rare resources among competing uses. One such method is the Cost-Benefit Analysis, which in monetary units quantifies the value of all impacts of an investment project on the society. Among the main conceptual presumptions we consider the relation between allocation effectiveness and value of project, definition of the main principle of valuation of inputs on the basis of Willingness-to-Pay (WTP) and evaluation pf project inputs on the basis of <b>opportunity</b> <b>costs,</b> dependency of WTP on the definition of society, and the anthropocentric nature of CBA. Microeconomic result of net benefits resulting from project impacts is the change of social welfare. Evaluation of project impacts is practicably dependent on whether the market for them is effective, ineffective or does not exist at all.

This is seen as a necessary first step in any planning process. From a survey of elderly persons in Britain, the levels of domiciliary services provided to those in their own homes was ascertained, and unit costs of each service was applied.

Recognising the fact that the costs of care in the community were likely to vary with the level of health of the elderly person, an attempt was made to categorise elderly persons into various levels of dependency. Secondly, regression techniques were used to ascertain whether the level of dependency did significantly affect the costs of care. It was found that variations in the average costs of care were significantly explained by both physical and mental characteristics of the elderly person. In addition, sex was important, as well as the elderly person's area of residence. This has important implications by itself for planning care services. It was also found that very few persons who were sampled in the community had a total cost of care greater than the average cost found in residential homes. ...|$|R

Lost opportunities to perform activities that may increase fitness are major escape costs. Paramount among these are chances to increase fitness by courting and mating and by driving away sexual rivals. Because sexual selection imposes different social demands on the sexes, <b>social</b> <b>opportunities</b> can have different consequences for males and females, but effects of sex differences in <b>social</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>costs</b> on escape behavior are unknown. We conducted a field experiment showing that male striped plateau lizards (Sceloporus virgatus) {{given the opportunity to}} court or perform aggressive behavior permit closer approach before fleeing, but females do not. Males allowed a simulated predator to approach closer before initiating escape if a tethered male or female rather than a control stimulus was introduced to them, but females initiated escape at similar distances in all conditions. For males, a trade-off between the greater predation risk accepted before fleeing due to the likelihood of enhancing fitness by sexual or aggressive behavior accounts for closer approach allowed in the presence of conspecifics. Mating opportunities are not limiting for females in most species and females often have little to gain by interacting aggressively with other females. Therefore, presence of a conspecific male or female may not justify taking greater risk. Results confirm the prediction of optimal escape theory that flight initiation decreases as cost of escaping increases. The sex difference in effect of presence of conspecifics on flight initiation distance is a consequence of the sex difference in costs of escaping. Copyright 2007, Oxford University Press. ...|$|R

In general, and when market distortions prevail, the use of shadow prices intends to take an economy towards an optimal allocation of resources by valuing goods and factors at their <b>social</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>costs.</b> The methodology adopted for the estimation of shadow prices and social parameters is that of the "World Bank" developed by Squire and van der Tak. The World Bank approach is selected to guide the empirical work after a study of three main approaches of project evaluation, which includes in addition to the World Bank's that of Little and Mirrlees (1974) and the UNIDO Guidelines. The shadow prices estimated are those for traded goods and labour as well as some social parameters. Shadow wage rates at social prices are estimated for Bahraini and migrant labour. Social parameters are estimated for Bahraini households only and include the consumption distribution weights, the value of public income, the summary distribution measure, the critical consumption level and the accounting rate of interest. The major findings derived from our empirical work are that shadow prices of traded goods are relatively high and are thus close to their market prices, shadow wage rates for Bahraini labour are mostly close to their market values, and that shadow wage rates generated by employment of migrant labour are relatively high and are clearly higher than those of Bahraini labour...|$|R
