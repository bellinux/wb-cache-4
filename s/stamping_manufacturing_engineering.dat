40|$|<b>Manufacturing</b> <b>Engineering</b> is {{concerned}} with converting a product specification into the most appropriate method of manufacture to produce the product to the correct cost and quality. Lack of integration and 'over the wall' engineering between design and <b>manufacturing</b> <b>engineering</b> adds to the time and cost of product development, and has significant effects on the subsequent cost {{and quality of the}} product. Because of the size and complexity of <b>manufacturing</b> <b>engineering</b> within the motor industry, the task is often divided between disparate, isolated, departments that traditionally have their own goals and objectives, supported by different business processes and systems. The adverse effects of the lack of integration between design and <b>manufacturing</b> <b>engineering</b> re-emerge within <b>manufacturing</b> <b>engineering</b> itself. As a part of this research, the author analysed the existing information flows through <b>manufacturing</b> <b>engineering</b> within Rover Group, and showed that the business processes and systems generated a high duplication of effort and data, and reinforced functional demarcation between the departments. The new Rover Integrated <b>Manufacturing</b> <b>Engineering</b> System (RIMES) has been developed to address these issues. RIMES has been developed using TQM techniques and evolutionary delivery, new to Rover, to involve the <b>manufacturing</b> <b>engineering</b> customer in all aspects of business analysis and system development. The resultant system deliverables have therefore more closely met the customer requirements and have consequently been implemented with greater customer support. The subsequent changes to <b>manufacturing</b> <b>engineering</b> culture have been promoted from within <b>manufacturing</b> <b>engineering,</b> with the RIMES system acting as a lever for the change. The research has been primarily concerned with the analysis and development of appropriate solutions in three main areas: integration of design and <b>manufacturing</b> <b>engineering,</b> change control procedures to maintain data integrity, and business processes to improve efficiency of <b>manufacturing</b> <b>engineering</b> and the quality of its output. These are all issues that are important for supporting concurrent engineering but were found not to have been adequately addressed, either in the research literature or in commercial systems, for applications involving large, complex products. The new system provides support for the electronic integration of design and <b>manufacturing</b> <b>engineering</b> information, which is based on a technique developed that combines data 'push' and 'pull' principles, and enables the efficient communication of product specification to <b>manufacturing</b> <b>engineering.</b> It provides a single system and repository of <b>manufacturing</b> <b>engineering</b> knowledge, a common fundamental business process, and a common and consistent way of presenting <b>manufacturing</b> <b>engineering</b> information and reports. Concurrent engineering is promoted through early availability of information for downstream processes and strict change control procedures have been developed to maintain data integrity. The previously disparate departments of process engineering and industrial engineering are now working concurrently from the same data which has improved the accuracy, consistency and understanding of information both internally and in external reporting. The time to market has been reduced because product specification information is provided earlier and simultaneously to all <b>manufacturing</b> <b>engineering</b> functions. The <b>manufacturing</b> <b>engineering</b> process and its output have been redesigned. New working methods introduced through the RIMES system have promoted reorganisation and the elimination of demarcation within <b>manufacturing</b> <b>engineering</b> to further facilitate concurrent engineering. Newly designed multi media forms for communication of process information to manufacturing, developed in consultation with the RIMES user community, has promoted team working on the shop-floor...|$|R
40|$|<b>Manufacturing</b> <b>engineering</b> {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the Canadian economy. However, progress made in improving the <b>manufacturing</b> <b>engineering</b> programs at the university level in Canada has fallen behind compared to what in other developed countries such as Germany, United States and Japan. In order to improve the competitiveness of the Canadian manufacturing industry, it is necessary to reinforce the <b>manufacturing</b> <b>engineering</b> education programs, especially the undergraduate programs. The objectives of this thesis are to find the limitations of the Canadian <b>manufacturing</b> <b>engineering</b> education programs and accordingly, to propose improvement. The thesis begins with a general review of some <b>manufacturing</b> <b>engineering</b> programs in other countries around the world. Then a study of the current status of <b>manufacturing</b> <b>engineering</b> education in Canada, with a focus on the undergraduate <b>manufacturing</b> <b>engineering</b> education in Ontario, is reported. The needs of current and future Canadian manufacturing industry and the functions of manufacturing engineers in the future are discussed. Finally, in order to solve the problem of the lack of hands-on experience in the existing programs, a proposal of a <b>Manufacturing</b> <b>Engineering</b> program with a Computer Integrated Manufacturing (CIM) Laboratory is presented.
