He scored his first Premier League goal for Sunderland on 22 September 2007 against North-East rivals Middlesbrough in the 89th minute with a 20-yard left-footed shot.

Sunderland went on to lose the game 2–0.|$|E
5|$|Protests {{over the}} {{impending}} takeover of Manchester United by American businessman Malcolm Glazer {{had threatened to}} overshadow the final, though demonstrations in Cardiff required little intervention from the police. Both managers for the final made surprising changes to their team; Arsène Wenger unconventionally deployed a defensive formation, while Sir Alex Ferguson left midfielder Ryan Giggs on the bench. Manchester United dominated the match, creating {{four times as many}} shots as their opponents, but struggled to find the breakthrough. In extra time, Arsenal's José Antonio Reyes was <b>sent</b> <b>off</b> for a second bookable offence, becoming only the second player to be <b>sent</b> <b>off</b> in an FA Cup final.|$|E

5|$|A {{first team}} regular {{alongside}} defensive partners Neil Aspin and Dean Glover, in summer 1992 {{he helped the}} club to win the pre-season TNT Tournament. His performances in the 1992–93 season saw him awarded {{a place on the}} PFA Second Division team. He was man of the match in the League Trophy final victory over Stockport County – despite suffering from a double hernia and being hungover from a secret boozing session the night before. The season finished on a negative note though, {{in the second half of}} the 1993 Second Division play-off final against West Bromwich Albion, with the game still goalless, Swan was <b>sent</b> <b>off</b> after bringing down Bob Taylor – who was through on goal. This proved to the turning point in the game as West Brom went on to win 3–0 to secure promotion at Vale's expense. It also meant that he went down in history as only the third Englishman to be <b>sent</b> <b>off</b> at Wembley, after Kevin Keegan and Lee Dixon.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal only {{earned a}} point at Southampton, where Van Persie was <b>sent</b> <b>off</b> for a late {{challenge}} on Graeme Le Saux. The team remained in third {{at the end of}} February, four points behind Manchester United and 10 behind leaders Chelsea, who played a game less than both challengers.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal {{travelled}} to Goodison Park in {{the fourth}} round of the competition to play Everton. They won the match 1–0 courtesy of a late Emmanuel Adebayor goal, which came from a corner. For much of the game Everton played with a man disadvantage as striker James McFadden was <b>sent</b> <b>off</b> in the 19th minute for dissent.|$|E

5|$|Canavan {{was used}} mostly as an 'impact substitute' {{throughout}} the 2005 Championship—brought on to either unsettle the opposition, or rally his teammates. This backfired {{when he was}} controversially <b>sent</b> <b>off</b> within a minute of coming on as a substitute in the Ulster Final replay replay.|$|E
5|$|Cole {{scored the}} winner against Fulham on Valentine's Day {{to set up}} a quarter-final clash at home to Chelsea. Although there were no goals, Paul Scholes and Roberto Di Matteo were both <b>sent</b> <b>off</b> and missed the replay, three days later at Stamford Bridge. Yorke kept up his ever-improving goalscoring record, scoring two goals against the Blues on 10 March.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{setting up}} Vieri's goal in Italy's second round defeat to co-hosts South Korea from a corner, his {{performance}} {{was once again}} criticised, in particular as he was <b>sent</b> <b>off</b> in extra time after being handed a controversial second yellow card by referee Byron Moreno for simulation.|$|E

5|$|During the season, he {{received}} two red cards, the first against Exeter City on 19 November 2005 following {{a fight in}} the tunnel at half time with Exeter's Lee Phillips. The second red card came against Canvey Island on 2 January 2006, when Stuart was <b>sent</b> <b>off</b> in the 60th minute for punching teammate John Nutter.|$|E
5|$|However, {{just four}} days later, he was <b>sent</b> <b>off</b> for a lunge at Stiliyan Petrov against Aston Villa, which {{resulted}} in a three-match ban and ruled him out of the League Cup final. On 10 March, Nani set up Rooney's second in a 4–0 win over Milan, before providing another assist for Rooney four days later, in the 3–0 league victory over Fulham.|$|E
5|$|Later that month, Costa and Mario Suárez were loaned to Segunda División side Celta de Vigo for the season, and Costa {{became a}} regular in the team, managed by former Ballon d'Or winner Hristo Stoichkov. In his seventh league match, he scored his first goal in Spanish {{football}} in a dominant home victory over Xerez; after scoring, he showboated, causing a brawl {{which resulted in}} him being <b>sent</b> <b>off.</b> Costa was subsequently rested from Celta's away game at the same opposition. The event drew the wrath of Stoichkov, who unexpectedly left his position. Towards {{the middle of the}} season, he was involved in two further controversies: he struck Málaga defender Weligton in the head, causing an injury which required medical stitches, and was <b>sent</b> <b>off</b> against Sevilla Atlético for diving and dissent, leaving his team to fight for a draw without him. The loyal strike partner of Quincy Owusu-Abeyie despite the pair not sharing a common language, he was dropped for Cypriot Ioannis Okkas. On 23 March 2008, Costa scored both Celta goals in a 2–1 win at Numancia, the latter after a long dribble; but later on in the campaign, he was <b>sent</b> <b>off</b> against Tenerife at Balaídos, after which Celta went from winning 2–0 to drawing 2–2. The team barely avoided relegation, and Costa earned a reputation for being a disruptive influence.|$|E
