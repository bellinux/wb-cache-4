25|$|Western riders wear a long-sleeved shirt, denim jeans, boots, and a wide-brimmed cowboy hat.

A rider may wear protective leather leggings called chaps. Clean, well-fitting work clothing is the usual outfit seen in rodeo, cutting and reining competitions, especially for men, though sometimes {{both men and women}} wear brighter colors or finer fabrics for competition than for work.|$|R

5000|$|The M1936 (Mle1936) is a French light {{anti-tank}} mine {{used during the}} Second World War. The mine was captured in large numbers by the German army after the Fall of France, and was later used in North Africa and Italy. The mine consists of a base plate on top {{of which is a}} rectangular steel box containing an explosive charge. On top of the container are two M1935 or M1936 pressure fuzes. A pressure cover is fixed on top of the container by wires attached {{at either end of the}} container. Two pressure bars are welded to the inside of the pressure cover, each one is directly over a fuze - however, each bar has a recess preventing it from pressing on the pressure fuze, until a <b>safety</b> <b>bar</b> is inserted. The <b>safety</b> <b>bar</b> covers the recesses allowing the pressure cover to bear down directly on the pressure fuzes.|$|E
50|$|Waltzers {{originally}} had 10 cars. However, several Ark rides have {{been converted into}} a waltzer, therefore 9 and 11 car variations can be found. Some Waltzer cars had brakes that activate automatically when the <b>safety</b> <b>bar</b> is open. Newer models usually have a complex braking system that stops each car, making them face outwards automatically once the car is stationary.|$|E

5000|$|Although it was rumoured by the {{automotive}} press since {{the announcement of}} the production R8 in 2006, it was only in August 2008 that spy shots of a convertible R8 [...] "Spider" [...] from filming scenes of the movie Iron Man 2 were published online. The photos showed a clearly visible [...] "soft-top" [...] roof, and the distinctive [...] "sideblade" [...] had been removed. The vehicle was formally unveiled at the 2009 Frankfurt Motor Show. Compared with the coupé model, the convertible had extra chassis support, a pair of roll-over <b>safety</b> <b>bars,</b> as well as minor changes such as the location of the fuel filler. It was powered by the uneven firing 5.2 FSI V10 engine.|$|R

Both cars inevitably could not compete {{in the next two}} races held on the weekend. James suffered a tear in his right quad muscle and a fractured tibia. HRT endurance co-driver Nick Percat replaced him for the final two races of the season at the Sydney 500.|$|R
