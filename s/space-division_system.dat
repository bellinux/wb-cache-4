Our new approach is based on diagonalizing the multiuser channel matrices and we use a variation of successive Jacobi rotations. In addition to the diagonalization, our approach attempts to optimize the resultant channel gains for performance enhancement.

40|$|An {{optical fiber}} with weak mode {{coupling}} is desirable for future ultrahigh capacity <b>space-division</b> multiplexing (SDM) <b>systems</b> because mode coupling in an optical fiber results in extrinsic {{loss of the}} fiber and crosstalk between guided optical modes. To study the feasibility of a ring-core fiber (RCF) for SDM systems, in this paper, we investigate the mode coupling in the RCF supporting five or seven guided mode groups (MGs) at a wavelength of 1550 nm. For this purpose, the coupled mode/power theory with identified spatial power spectrum of random perturbations of fiber axis is used to estimate the bend loss/crosstalk of the RCF due to microbending. It is shown that based on the identified parameters for the spatial power spectrum in the 5 / 7 -MG RCF, the estimated bend loss/crosstalk of the RCF agrees well with experimental results. In addition, {{the impact of the}} gradient parameter (alpha) and refractive index contrast (Delta) of the fiber refractive index profile on bend loss and crosstalk of the RCF is explored.

40|$|This paper starts by an {{investigation}} of nonlinear transmission in <b>space-division</b> multiplexed (SDM) <b>systems</b> using multimode fibers exhibiting a rapidly varying birefringence. A primary objective is to generalize the Manakov equations, {{well known in the}} case of single-mode fibers. We first investigate a reference case where linear coupling among the spatial modes of the fiber is weak and after averaging over birefringence fluctuations, we obtain new Manakov equations for multimode fibers. Such an averaging reduces the number of intermodal nonlinear terms drastically since all four-wave-mixing terms average out. Cross-phase modulation terms still affect multimode transmission but their effectiveness is reduced. We then verify the accuracy of our new Manakov equations by transmitting multiple PDM-QPSK signals over different modes of a multimode fiber and comparing the numerical results with those obtained by solving the full stochastic equation. The agreement is excellent in all cases studied. A great benefit of the new equations is to reduce the computation time by a factor of 10 or more. Another important feature observed is that birefringence fluctuations improve system performance by reducing the impact of fiber nonlinearities. Finally multimode fibers with strong random coupling among all spatial modes are considered. Linear coupling is modeled using the random matrix theory approach. We derive new Manakov equations for multimode fibers in that regime and show that such fibers can perform better than single-modes fiber for large number of propagating spatial modes.
