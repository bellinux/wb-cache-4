One of the first basins to be treated with works for the protection against erosion and torrent control is the Gradasnica River basin. The basic parameters to display the changes of the hydrological status of the land are the state of erosion, the change of erosion-coefficient, annual <b>sediment</b> yield, <b>specific</b> annual <b>sediment</b> <b>discharge</b> through the hydrographic network, the value of the runoff curve number and value of the maximal discharge. Works on protection from erosion and regulations of torrents have influenced the decrease in erosion coefficient values from strong erosion (Z= 0. 99) to the value of weak erosion (Z= 0. 40), as well as the reduction of the maximum discharge value from Qmax(1956) = 108, 12 m 3 /s to the value of Qmax(2014) = 87. 2 m 3 /s...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} {{determine}} how the subaqueous delta evolution depends on the water and sediment processes in the Yangtze Estuary, the amounts of water and <b>sediment</b> <b>discharged</b> into the estuary were studied. The results show that, during the period from 1950 to 2010, there was no significant change in the annual water discharge, and the multi-annual mean water discharge increased in dry seasons and decreased in flood seasons. However, the annual <b>sediment</b> <b>discharge</b> and the multi-annual mean <b>sediment</b> <b>discharge</b> in flood and dry seasons took on a decreasing trend, and the intra-annual distribution of water and <b>sediment</b> <b>discharges</b> tended to be uniform. The evolution process from deposition to erosion occurred at the − 10 m and − 20 m isobaths of the subaqueous delta. The enhanced annual water and <b>sediment</b> <b>discharges</b> had a silting-up effect on the delta, and the effect of sediment was greater than that of water. Based on data analysis, empirical curves were built to present the relationships between the water and <b>sediment</b> <b>discharges</b> over a year or in dry and flood seasons and the erosion/deposition rates in typical regions of the subaqueous delta, whose evolution followed the pattern of silting in flood seasons and scouring in dry seasons. Notably, the Three Gorges Dam has changed the distribution processes of water and <b>sediment</b> <b>discharges,</b> and the dam's regulating and reserving functions can benefit the subaqueous delta deposition when the annual water and <b>sediment</b> <b>discharges</b> are not affected...|$|R

Surface suspended sediment concentration has been sampled every 10 days since 1995 (390 samples available) by the international HYBAM program at the Óbidos station {{which happens to be}} the last gauged station of the Amazon River before the Atlantic Ocean. Remote sensing reflectance is derived from continuous time series of 554 MODIS images available since 2000 and calibrated with the HYBAM field measurements. Discharge shows a weak correlation with the suspended sediment concentration during the annual hydrological cycle, preventing us from computing <b>sediment</b> <b>discharge</b> directly from the water <b>discharge.</b> Accordingly, river <b>sediment</b> <b>discharge</b> is assessed by multiplying daily water discharge measurements by the suspended sediment concentration averaged on a monthly basis.

40|$|Changes in {{external}} forcing {{have traditionally been}} the main areas of interest in understanding sedimentary records, while in most stratigraphic interpretation, autogenic behavior has been {{thought of as a}} "noise" generator. This study aims to investigate autogenic processes in a fluvio-deltaic system under a range of discharge conditions and to show that autogenic processes generate distinct signatures rather than random noise. A matrix of nine different experiments is presented here to systematically evaluate the effects of <b>sediment</b> and water <b>discharge</b> variations on the timescale of fluvial autogenic processes. Temporary sediment storage regularly occurs by backfilling of sediment in the fluvio-deltaic channels, followed by a period of strong channelization that releases the stored sediment. These storage and release processes cycle along with changes in the fluvial slope and planform pattern of the flow. Here we propose that the autogenic behavior of deltaic progradation has a distinct timescale that is controlled by <b>sediment</b> and water <b>discharges.</b> An increase in <b>sediment</b> <b>discharge</b> primarily reduces the autogenic timescale as higher sediment supply fills the channels faster. In contrast, the high <b>sediment</b> <b>discharge</b> causes a morphologic feedback by increasing the magnitude of fluvial slope change between the storage and release events and increasing the size of the temporary sediment storage (termed "the fluvial envelope"). This works against the <b>sediment</b> <b>discharge</b> control as the autogenic timescale is increased. Increasing the water discharge increases the autogenic timescale by improving the fluvial organization toward a strongly channelized system. Changes in autogenic timescale due to variations in the <b>sediment</b> and water <b>discharges</b> are nonlinear for different <b>sediment</b> to water <b>discharge</b> ratios. As the ratio decreases, the fluvial system is better organized and the timescale is more linearly related to the change in <b>sediment</b> <b>discharge.</b> As the ratio increases, deltas develop poorly organized fluvial systems and the associated timescales converge even with different <b>sediment</b> <b>discharges.</b> The results presented here provide enhanced interpretation of sedimentary records by better decoupling of autogenic signatures from allogenic products developed across a wide range of discharge conditions...|$|R

The experiments were made in pairs. In each pair the velocity and depth were the same or nearly the same, but in one experiment the water temperature was from 15 °C to 20 °C higher than in the other. It was found that in low-transport, flat-bed flows where particle transport is by rolling and sliding along the bed, a 15 °C to 20 °C increase in water temperature can produce a relatively large change in <b>sediment</b> <b>discharge.</b> The nature of this change depends on the flow condition at the bed. With hydrodynamically smooth flow there is an increase in <b>sediment</b> <b>discharge</b> with increase in water temperature; whereas in transition from smooth to rough an increase in water temperature effects a reduction in <b>sediment</b> <b>discharge.</b> With fully-rough flow which obtains at boundary Reynolds numbers larger than approximately 200, <b>sediment</b> <b>discharge</b> does not depend on water temperature. A phenomenological explanation has been presented for these observed temperature effects on <b>sediment</b> <b>discharge.</b> In high-transport, flat-bed flows with suspended sediment transport, it was observed that the temperature effects on bed-load discharge are qualitatively the same as those which obtain in low-transport, flat-bed flows of approximately the same boundary Reynolds numbers. It was also found that under certain flow conditions a change in water temperature alone can cause a change in bed form. The nature of this change in bed form seems to be related to the boundary Reynolds numbers R' *b of the flows. For R' *b less than a value near 8 bed form transitions were accomplished at lower velocities in a warm water flow than in a cold water flow at the same discharge; whereas for larger values of R' *b contrary temperature effects on bed form transitions have been observed. ...|$|R

The sediment deposits in the reservoir were measured {{during the year}} 1998 and the mean annual <b>sediment</b> <b>discharge</b> was calculated equal to 68 kg/s. The Avlaki gauging station, run by the Public Power Corporation (PPC) of Greece, is located a few kilometers upstream of the reservoir's entrance (catchment 1358 km 2). <b>Sediment</b> <b>discharge</b> measurements were taken during 1966 - 1970 whereas daily river stages were recorded with frequent intervals without measurements. A distributed hydrologic model (the MIKE SHE model) was applied {{to fill in the}} periods with missing mean daily discharges from 1966 to 1998. Two alternative rating curves were deduced from the <b>sediment</b> <b>discharge</b> measurements, the first one with a unique power law expression for the whole set of discharges and the second with different power relations for two discharge classes above and below a threshold roughly corresponding to the bankfull discharge. It is assumed that the rating relationships are valid for the whole time span of the simulation since the catchment has undergone insignificant land use changes. The application of the first rating curve to the mean daily discharge yields mean annual <b>sediment</b> <b>discharge</b> equal to 13. 5 kg/s, whereas the application of the different power relations for two discharge classes yields a corresponding value of 73. 3 kg/s. The first equation seriously underestimates the <b>sediment</b> <b>discharge</b> whereas the second one results in an estimate close to that of hydrographic survey.

The devastation {{is closely related to}} human activities, such as the harvesting of ferns and litter for fuel. However, few quantitative data exist on effects of human activities on sediment yields. Data on sediment yields, and percentages of peak storm runoff in the two basins, one a control form which people have been excluded since 1997, and the other where normal harvesting practices are permitted were used to evaluate how human activity affects <b>sediment</b> <b>discharge.</b> The annual <b>sediment</b> <b>discharge</b> decreased immediately after implementing control practices, despite no marked changes in the percentages of peak storm runoff in the four years after 1997. The four-year period of control practices was too short to affect the relationship between peak rainfall and peak storm runoff, but long enough to contribute to the reductions in <b>sediment</b> <b>discharge</b> in the control basin...|$|R

This <b>sediment</b> <b>discharge</b> testifies of the intensity of continental erosionand records changes in climate, tectonics and human activity. However, natural and instrumental uncertaintiesinherent to the in-situ measurements of <b>sediment</b> <b>discharge</b> prevent from conclusive estimates to better understandthese linkages. Here we develop a new method, using the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite data, to infer mass-integrative estimates of <b>sediment</b> <b>discharge</b> of large rivers {{to the ocean}}. GRACE satelliteprovides global gravity time series that have proven useful for quantifying mass transport, including continentalwater redistribution at the Earth surface (ice sheets and glaciers melting, groundwater storage variations) but hasbeen seldom used for monitoring sediment mass transfers so far. Here we pair the analysis of regularized GRACEsolutions at high spatial resolution corrected from all known contributions (hydrology, ocean, atmosphere) to aparticle tracking model that predicts {{the location of the}} sediment sinks for 13 rivers with the highest sedimentsloads in the world. We find that the resulting GRACE-derived <b>sediment</b> <b>discharges</b> off the mouth of the Amazon,Ganges-Brahmaputra, Changjiang (Yangtze), Indus, Magdalena, Godavari and Mekong rivers are consistent within-situ measurements. Our results suggest that the lack of time continuity and of global coverage in terrestrialsediment discharge measurements could be reduced by using GRACE, which provides global and continuous datasince 2002. GRACE solutions are regularly improved and new satellite gravity missions are being prepared hencemaking our approach even more relevant in a near future.

40|$|In hydraulics, {{velocity}} {{distribution is}} needed to determine flow characteristics, like <b>discharge,</b> <b>sediment</b> <b>discharge,</b> head loss, energy coefficient, moment coefficient, and scour. However, the complicated interaction between water and sediment causes great difficulties in the measurement of flow and <b>sediment</b> <b>discharge.</b> Thus, the development of a method which can simulate the velocity distribution and <b>sediment</b> <b>discharge</b> in open channels is designable. Traditional methods for the estimation of velocity distribution, such as the Prandtl-von Karman logarithmic velocity and of sediment concentration distribution, such as the Rouse equation, are generally invalid at or near the channel bed and are inaccurate at the water surface. Considering the limitations of traditional methods, entropy based models have been applied, yet the assumption on the cumulative distribution function made in these methods limits their application. The objective of this research is to develop an efficient method to estimate velocity distribution and suspended <b>sediment</b> <b>discharge</b> in open channels using the Tsallis entropy. This research focuses on a better-organized hypothesis on the cumulative probability distribution function under more applicable coordinates, which should be transformable in different dimensions. Velocity distribution and sediment distribution are derived using the Tsallis entropy under the hypothesis that the cumulative probability distribution follows a non-linear function, in which the value of the exponent is shown {{to be related to the}} width-depth ratio of channel cross-section. Three different combinations of entropy and empirical methods for velocity and sediment concentration distribution are applied to compute suspended <b>sediment</b> <b>discharge.</b> Then advantages and disadvantages of each method are discussed. The velocity distribution derived using the Tsallis entropy is expected to be easy to apply and valid throughout the whole cross-section of the open channel.
