500|$|... "Our Father" [...] {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics; some {{thought that it}} was dull, though Smits' performance received widespread critical acclaim. Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger said that he was [...] "frustrated" [...] by the episode despite not finding any faults with it, writing, [...] "I can't help thinking that I've seen as much of Dexter Morgan's world as I need to." [...] Matt Fowler, writing for IGN, thought that the revelation of Rita's pregnancy was [...] "an interesting development, but not necessarily something that instantly catapults me to the edge of my seat" [...] but that Smits as Miguel could improve [...] "even [...] great [...] like Dexter". The Australians Stephen Romei felt that, with the beginning of the third season, [...] "Dexter has gone from an eight to a six" [...] {{on a scale of one}} to ten, saying that the show [...] "has lost its edge" [...] with the hypocrisy of Dexter being a supposed sociopath despite holding several relationships. Los Angeles Times critic Claire Zulkey was [...] "not <b>sure</b> <b>yet</b> whether [...] good". Ray Ellis of Blogcritics felt that [...] "the series has settled into a state of complacency" [...] and could not [...] "escape the feeling I've seen this before". On the other hand, the San Francisco Chronicles Tim Goodman wrote that [...] "the whiff of normalcy for Dexter" [...] gives viewers [...] "a magnificent tease" [...] and likened the fast-moving plot to [...] "the urgency of brilliance". TV Squad critic Debra McDuffee was [...] "pleasantly surprised by Smits" [...] and said that, thus far, [...] "season three is a good one". TV Guides Paula Paige, who was [...] "thrilled" [...] to see Smits join the cast, said, [...] "What the Dexter season three opener lacked in explosive excitement, it certainly made up for in Jimmy Smits." [...] Daniel Fienberg, writing for Zap2it, said that the combination of Hall and Smits was [...] "as good as TV acting gets" [...] and that, in comparison to the second season's opening, [...] "the show's creative team appears to have done it again".|$|E

2500|$|In the meantime, {{the band}} {{continued}} {{work on their}} new studio album. In an interview with Metal Ways at Appelpop 2008, guitarist Robert Westerholt stated that the new album was [...] "probably going {{to be kind of}} a concept, but it’s so early still that nothing is really <b>sure</b> <b>yet.</b> But we’re trying to look in that direction." ...|$|E
2500|$|Leaving Ireland to find employment, Ruddock went to London {{but soon}} {{realised}} {{that he was}} on a [...] "different path to others who followed the 'official' Aikido line". Having spent three years at the source he [...] "knew where he wanted to be, even if he was not quite <b>sure</b> <b>yet</b> how to get there". He taught a small Aikido group at the college where he studied to become a schoolteacher.|$|E
2500|$|The Lab and its {{partners}} concluded the 2006–07 field season in Arkansas {{at the end of}} April with no additional definitive evidence of ivory-bills to complement the data gathered in 2004 and 2005. But [...] Rohrbaugh and others are convinced the research should continue, not only in Arkansas, but in other states {{that are part of the}} bird’s historic range. “We’ll return to Arkansas for at least another field season,” says Rohrbaugh. “Searches there and searches conducted by other agencies throughout the Southeast are still turning up reports of sounds that cannot be explained away. However, there’s no way to know for <b>sure</b> <b>yet</b> if reported double knocks and kent-like sounds were made by an ivory-bill or something else.” ...|$|E
60|$|Meanwhile Charlie Christian and Otaheitan Sally and the staggerer wended {{their way}} {{overland}} {{to the same}} rendezvous slowly--remarkably slowly.

2500|$|While {{waiting for}} equipment, the divers began {{knocking}} {{the bottom of}} the pusher to find out if there was anyone trapped inside the capsized vessel and shortly afterwards established contact with the chief engineer and the chief officer. Shouting through the bottom, the divers told the trapped crew members that they were attempting to dive into the engine room from outside, after which those inside asked if it was possible to cut a hole to the bottom. When they were told that the rescuers were not <b>sure</b> <b>yet</b> if it was safe, the crewmen informed the divers that they were not in immediate danger although the air was becoming hard to breadth due to oil fumes. After diving inside the vessel was deemed to be impossible due to the heavy seas and the slight movement between the pusher and the barge indicated that the vessel was grounded and thus not in danger of sinking, it was decided to make a hole to the bottom to rescue the trapped crew members.|$|E
2500|$|On January 10, 2006, it {{was said}} that T.I. teamed up with the Underground Kingz for a Mannie Fresh-produced remake of UGK's 1994 classic [...] "Front, Back and Side to Side". That {{was one of the first}} two singles from the album. The other record would be a song with the working title [...] "Chirp Back" [...] (however T.I.'s camp said that the title in all {{likelihood}} would be changed), which is produced by DJ Toomp, best known for collaborating on T.I.'s biggest record [...] "U Don't Know Me". An earlier version of the new [...] "Front, Back and Side to Side" [...] — minus Pimp C — appeared on the new T.I. mixtape with DJ Drama, Gangsta Grillz: The Leak, which came about after several songs from the King recording sessions leaked onto the Internet. T.I. decided to take all the bootlegged material and feed the streets; he's insisted that none of the songs on the mixtape would appear on King. In late 2005, T.I. told MTV News that he's recorded more than 70 songs for the album, and his rep said the MC recently went back into the lab and now had more than 100 songs to choose from. It was also said that one person who was excited about his work with T.I. was Swizz Beatz, who produced Bring Em Out for T.I.'s 2004 Urban Legend. Swizz Beatz confirmed he did four songs for the album. Particularly a song called [...] "I Got That, Get It When You Need", which was later changed to Get It. T.I. later confirmed he was still in the process of finding the right mix of songs for the album and, apart from the two aforementioned singles, he was not <b>sure</b> <b>yet</b> which songs would make the cut.|$|E

5000|$|Reynolds and the Royal Academy {{received}} a mixed reception. Critics included William Blake who published the vitriolic Annotations to Sir Joshua Reynolds' Discourses in 1808. J. M. W.
