40|$|We used pitfall {{trapping}} {{to measure}} the species richness and relative abundance of <b>ground</b> <b>beetles</b> (Coleoptera: Carabidae) in four forest habitats on Kent Island, a 80 -ha island in the Bay of Fundy, New Brunswick, ~anada. Sixteen species of <b>ground</b> <b>beetles</b> representing 11 genera were identified in the forested habitats on Kent Is-land; the relative paucity of <b>ground</b> <b>beetle</b> species may {{be a result of}} the island's harsh climate, dense colonies of breeding seabirds, and isolation from the mainland. Estimates of <b>ground</b> <b>beetle</b> population densities on Kent Island ranged from 50 000 to 250 OOO/ha. Most <b>ground</b> <b>beetle</b> species were trapped in all habitats and appeared to be habitat generalists. In a series of experiments in which we removed all <b>ground</b> <b>beetles</b> trapped daily over a 3 -week period in two experimental plots, <b>ground</b> <b>beetle</b> densities remained as high as in a control plot; other <b>ground</b> <b>beetles</b> quickly moved into the experimental plots to replace beetles that had been removed. The density'of <b>ground</b> <b>beetles</b> was highest in intact forest and large forest patches; in contrast, the density of invertebrates other than <b>ground</b> <b>beetles</b> (i. e., possible prey or competitors of <b>ground</b> <b>beetles)</b> was highest in open habitats and isolated forest patches, where <b>ground</b> <b>beetles</b> were less common. Removing <b>ground</b> <b>beetles</b> from experimental plots did not result in an increase in the density of other invertebrates...|$|R

40|$|Semi-natural {{habitats}} are {{key components}} of rural landscapes because they shelter {{a significant number of}} overwintering arthropods that are beneficial to agriculture. However, woodlots are semi-natural habitats with high patch-level heterogeneity and this aspect has been poorly studied. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the influence of woodlot heterogeneity on overwintering <b>ground</b> <b>beetles.</b> Woodlot heterogeneity was characterized in terms of distance from the woodlot boundary and date of the most recent logging operation. We used emergence traps to quantify the population density of <b>ground</b> <b>beetles</b> that overwintered in the different parts of the woodlot. In woodlot edges the densities and species richness of <b>ground</b> <b>beetles</b> were significantly higher than in the rest of the woodlot. <b>Ground</b> <b>beetles</b> that are active in crop fields overwintered in the edges but not in the inner zone of the woodlot. Species assemblages of <b>ground</b> <b>beetles</b> overwintering in the edges were highly diverse. The date of the most recent logging operation did not explain the distribution of <b>ground</b> <b>beetles</b> that overwintered in the woodlot. Our results show that woodlots, and in particular their edges, are used as a winter shelter by <b>ground</b> <b>beetles</b> that spend part of their life in crops, which potentially favours biological control in adjacent crop fields...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} improve {{biological}} control of agricultural pests, it is fundamental to understand which factors influence the composition of natural enemies in agricultural landscapes. In this study, we aimed to understand how agricultural land use affects {{a number of different}} traits in <b>ground</b> <b>beetle</b> communities to better predict potential consequences of land-use change for ecosystem functioning. We studied <b>ground</b> <b>beetles</b> in fields with different agricultural land use ranging from frequently managed sugar beet fields, winter wheat fields to less intensively managed grasslands. The <b>ground</b> <b>beetles</b> were collected in emergence tents that catch individuals overwintering locally in different life stages and with pitfall traps that catch individuals that could have a local origin or may have dispersed into the field. Community weighted mean values for <b>ground</b> <b>beetle</b> traits such as body size, flight ability and feeding preference were estimated for each land-use type and sampling method. In fields with high land-use intensity the average body length of emerging <b>ground</b> <b>beetle</b> communities was lower than in the grasslands while the average body length of actively moving communities did not differ between the land-use types. The proportion of <b>ground</b> <b>beetles</b> with good flight ability or a carnivorous diet was higher in the crop fields as compared to the grasslands. Our study highlights that increasing management intensity reduces the average body size of emerging <b>ground</b> <b>beetles</b> and the proportion of mixed feeders. Our results also suggest that the dispersal ability of <b>ground</b> <b>beetles</b> enables them to compensate for local management intensities...|$|R

40|$|The {{abundance}} of <b>ground</b> <b>beetles</b> (Coleoptera, Carabidae) in oilseed rape field {{can be an}} important indicator of different agricultural measures in arable land fauna. Surveys about <b>ground</b> <b>beetle</b> fauna in Croatia are generally very scarce and only few research on oilseed rape were conducted. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the endogaeic <b>ground</b> <b>beetle</b> fauna in oilseed rape field and to determine species abundance and frequency. The study was carried out in Podravina region of Croatia, from the end of May till the mid-September in 2015. <b>Ground</b> <b>beetles</b> were collected using endogaeic traps incorporated in the soil. Altogether, 487 individuals classified into 8 species were collected. Species with the highest abundance and frequency was Brachinus (Brachinus) psophia Audinet-Serville, 1821, which was classified as eudominant and constant species. The highest <b>ground</b> <b>beetle</b> abundance was observed in summer period. All of the species found were spring breeders, except for species Trechus (Trechus) quadristriatus (Schrank, 1781) which breeds in autumn...|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} I {{have focused on}} {{studying}} dynamics of <b>ground</b> <b>beetle</b> assemblages in intensively managed agricultural landscapes. By definition, the land cover of these landscapes is dominated by annually tilled farmland, comprising a range of different crop types, {{in the context of}} the southern Swedish province of Scania mostly winter wheat, spring barley, winter rapeseed, and sugar beets. This background begs the question: can the presence of <b>ground</b> <b>beetles</b> in intensively managed agricultural landscapes be facilitated without sacrificing land dedicated to crop production? Crop diversification has been mentioned as a possible greening measure to mitigate agricultural intensity. Our results show that semi-natural grasslands and leys may not function as source habitats at a landscape-scale if they comprise a low proportion of the total land-use, while increasing crop diversity is correlated to <b>ground</b> <b>beetle</b> richness and diversity in agricultural landscapes dominated by arable land. Autumn breeding <b>ground</b> <b>beetles</b> were indicative of low crop diversity landscape. This is likely a result of high proportions of winter sown cereals that increase dominance of the species Pterostichus melanarius Illiger. Larger species were absent from assemblages emerging <b>ground</b> <b>beetle</b> assemblages in intensively managed crops such as sugar beet. Further, our results suggest that winter wheat fields are less adverse habitats for overwintering larger <b>ground</b> <b>beetles</b> as compared to sugar beet fields. Sugar beet management reduces emergence of larger <b>ground</b> <b>beetle</b> species that dominate actively moving assemblages, indicating that especially larger species are drivers of local <b>ground</b> <b>beetle</b> dynamics. Differences in isotopic composition between emerging and colonizing individuals of Trechus quadristriatus Schrank suggests that a significant proportion of individuals of this species came from remote locations, perhaps crossing the Baltic Sea with easterly winds...|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigated}} how local habitat type and landscape structure affects the biomass, species richness and functional diversity of <b>ground</b> <b>beetles</b> sampled from a 1000 ha UK arable farm. At a local scale habitat type was either crop (winter wheat and oilseed rape) {{or one of}} five field margin habitats. Surrounding each of these sampling areas, landscape structure was defined using remote sensed data from Specim AISA Eagle (400 – 970 nm) and Hawk (970 – 2450 nm) hyperspectral sensors. <b>Ground</b> <b>beetles</b> were divided into predatory and phytophagous trophic levels. Local habitat type only affected phytophagous <b>ground</b> <b>beetle</b> biomass, which was lowest within crops. Total biomass of predatory beetles was negatively correlated, and species richness positively correlated, with landscape habitat diversity. Only the functional diversity of predatory <b>ground</b> <b>beetles</b> responded to landscape structure, showing positive correlations with the proportion of Tussock Grass field margins. Predatory <b>ground</b> <b>beetles</b> show a greater dependence on landscape structure than phytophagous species, a response that is attributed to their high mobility needed for movement between dynamically variable food resources...|$|R
40|$|Physical {{exclusion}} {{shows some}} {{potential as a}} novel root weevil control strategy, but barriers to root weevil immigration may also exclude beneficial insects, such as <b>ground</b> <b>beetles.</b> A field study was undertaken in 1997 {{to assess the impact}} of two physical barriers—portable plastic trenches and aluminum fences with Teflon tape—on root weevil and <b>ground</b> <b>beetle</b> immigration into plots of strawberry, Fragaria x ananassa (Duchesne). Barypeithes pellucidus (Boheman) and Nemocestes incomptus (Horn), each comprised 43 % of the root weevils caught at the site. Most (86 %) of the <b>ground</b> <b>beetles</b> caught in control plots were longer than 1 cm, the width of the gap in the portable trench top. Trenches excluded 75 and 63 % of B. pellucidus and N. incomptus, respectively, without significantly reducing immigration of large (< 1 cm) <b>ground</b> <b>beetles.</b> Fences excluded 65, 84, and 99 % of B. pellucidus, N. incomptus, and large <b>ground</b> <b>beetles,</b> respectively. Adding diatomaceous earth to trenches did not increase their efficacy, and fences without Teflon tape excluded <b>ground</b> <b>beetles</b> but not root weevils. The reduction in the population of root weevils and other strawberry pests caused by the use of barriers reduced damage to strawberry plant leaves and increased strawberry plant survival relative to unprotected control plots. Advantages and disadvantages of these physical control tools are discussed with a view to creating superior tools for root weevil exclusion, compatible with an integrated pest management approach. Portable trenches may offer a means of selectively excluding root weevils but not <b>ground</b> <b>beetles...</b>|$|R
