5|$|Helium {{produced}} between 1930 and 1945 {{was about}} 98.3% pure (2% nitrogen), which was adequate for airships. In 1945, a <b>small</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> 99.9% helium was produced for welding use. By 1949, commercial quantities of Grade A 99.95% helium were available.|$|E

5|$|At {{standard}} temperature and pressure, thorium is slowly attacked by water, {{but does not}} readily dissolve in most common acids, {{with the exception of}} hydrochloric acid, where it dissolves leaving a black insoluble residue of ThO(OH,Cl)H. It dissolves in concentrated nitric acid containing a <b>small</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> catalytic fluoride or fluorosilicate ions; if these are not present, passivation can occur, as with uranium and plutonium.|$|E
5|$|Chemists {{who studied}} {{platinum}} dissolved it in aqua regia (a mixture of hydrochloric and nitric acids) to create soluble salts. They always observed a <b>small</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> a dark, insoluble residue. Joseph Louis Proust {{thought that the}} residue was graphite. The French chemists Victor Collet-Descotils, Antoine François, comte de Fourcroy, and Louis Nicolas Vauquelin also observed the black residue in 1803, but did not obtain enough for further experiments.|$|E

5|$|Finally, in {{sympatric}} speciation species diverge without geographic isolation or changes in habitat. This form is rare since even a <b>small</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> gene flow may remove genetic differences between {{parts of a}} population. Generally, {{sympatric speciation}} in animals requires the evolution of both genetic differences and non-random mating, to allow reproductive isolation to evolve.|$|E
5|$|First {{recorded}} and surveyed in 1840, North Island {{has been a}} seasonal camp for western rock lobster fishermen {{since the beginning of}} the 20th century, and this remains the principal focus of human activity on the island.

5|$|For {{several years}} in the 1950s and 1960s, a {{by-product}} of potassium production called Alkarb was a main source for rubidium. Alkarb contained 21% rubidium, with the rest being potassium and a <b>small</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> caesium.
