We find that, for such buoy systems, viscous friction is the dominant damping mechanism near resonance and, hence, the buoy’s wet extremities must also be properly streamlined, and rolling must be minimized as it may significantly increase such damping.

40|$|Abstract— This study {{describes}} the sound {{produced by a}} hydrokinetic turbine operating in a riverine environment near Iguigig, AK (USA). Drifting <b>spar</b> <b>buoys</b> equipped with hydrophones and GPS loggers were used to characterize temporal and spatial variability in turbine sound over a range of turbine operating conditions. Because of the quasi-stationary nature of river flows, multiple replicates could be obtained under steady-state operation. The sound from this turbine consists primarily of tones (ascribed to the generator) and broadband emissions (ascribed to blade vibration). The frequency of the tones varies {{in proportion to the}} turbine rotation rate. At the closest point of approach, for an optimally operating turbine, one-third octave levels are elevated by up to 40 dB relative to braked conditions. Broadband spatial patterns suggest relatively limited sound directivity. This study highlights the benefits of using Lagrangian drifters to characterize turbine sound (e. g., flow noise mitigation, spatially-resolved acoustic fields) and challenges (e. g., positional accuracy, self-noise contamination). Further analysis is required to interpret spatial variability in the context of acoustic propagation in riverine environments...|$|R

40|$|CIVINSApproved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} unlimitedIn {{the wake of}} the KURSK tragedy, world navies have brought their full attention to the submarine rescue problem. While many rescue systems exist, none have been able to sufficiently address the gamut of scenarios that place submariners in peril. One rescue strategy utilizes a submarine escape capsule commonly referred to as a Surfacing Rescue Container (SRC). Although SRCs have been employed in several submarine designs over the last four decades, the United States has never adopted the underlying strategy. This paper recognizes the SRC concept as the most reliable means of rescue, and proposes a modular SRC concept design (LSRC) which utilizes a modified Trident II D- 5 missile tube as its host. The design is intended for use on the U. S. Navy's next generation ballistic missile submarine (SSBN) but may be back-fitted on current U. S. Navy Ohio class and U. K. Royal Navy Vanguard Class submarines with significant alteration.

40|$|Two steel <b>spar</b> <b>buoys</b> were {{constructed}} and moored in 50 and 100 m deep {{of water in}} the Aegean Sea to support recreational fisheries. The first FAD was deployed at coordinates 38 ° 01 ´ 48 ´´N 26 ° 58 ´ 02 ´´E and at a distance of 3 nautical miles from the shoreline. The other FAD was moored at 1. 1 nautical miles from the shoreline at coordinates 38 ° 03 ´ 11 ´´N; 26 ° 59 ´ 01 ´´E. An anchor (1. 2 x 1. 2 x 0. 8 m 3) weighing approximate 2. 76 metric ton, made of reinforced concrete, was used to hold a FAD weighing approximate 1. 5 metric ton. Hardware and connections of FADs, ropes, mooring calculation and anchor design were made. The interaction between the forces of wave and current and FADs in those waters was investigated. In the experiment, all forces (drag force, buoyancy force etc.) acting on FADs were calculated. It is proposed that the construction of the FADs should take the following design criteria into consideration: wave and current, forces related to the FADs, deployment depth, mooring hardware and ropes.

50|$|A <b>spar</b> <b>buoy</b> is a tall, thin buoy that floats {{upright in}} the water and is {{characterized}} by a small water plane area and a large mass. Because they tend to be stable ocean platforms, spar buoys are popular for making oceanographic measurements. Adjustment of the water plane area and the mass allows spar buoys to be tuned so they tend to not respond to wave forcing. This characteristic differentiates them from large water plane area buoys such as discus buoys that tend to be wave followers. Spar buoys are often used as stable platforms for wave measurement devices and air-sea interaction measurements. Spar buoys range in length from a few feet to the 354-foot (108 meter) RV FLIP. To avoid the difficulties inherent with shipboard launch and recovery, helicopter deployment of large spar buoys has been studied.|$|E
