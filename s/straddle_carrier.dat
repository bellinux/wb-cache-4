5000|$|A <b>{{straddle}}</b> <b>carrier</b> or {{straddle truck}} is a freight carrying vehicle that carries its load underneath by [...] "straddling" [...] it, rather than carrying {{it on top}} like a conventional truck. The advantage of the <b>straddle</b> <b>carrier</b> {{is its ability to}} load and unload without the assistance of cranes or forklifts. The lifting apparatus under the carrier is operated by the driver without any outside assistance and without leaving the driver's seat.|$|E

50|$|The <b>straddle</b> <b>carrier</b> {{was invented}} by H. B. Ross in 1913 as a road-going vehicle that could easily {{transport}} lumber around mills and yards. Lumber was stacked on special pallets known as carrier blocks; the carrier would then straddle the stack, grasp and lift the carrier block, and drive off with the load. Because a <b>straddle</b> <b>carrier</b> is open at both front and rear, it can transport lumber much longer than the carrier itself, over 30 m in length.|$|E

50|$|As the Sidelifter is {{suitable}} for travelling on general roads for large distances and able to quickly load and unload without additional equipment, it is often used for delivering and picking up shipping containers from within a commercial district. Although these can self load, they are more often loaded or unloaded at the port with a <b>straddle</b> <b>carrier</b> or reach stacker.|$|E
50|$|Similar {{industrial}} <b>straddle</b> <b>carriers</b> {{are used}} in manufacturing and construction, both for handling oversized loads such as steel and pre-cast concrete and where transportation of special loads such as nitrogen tanks is required in restricted spaces not suitable for trucks. A key advantage of industrial <b>straddle</b> <b>carriers</b> over forklifts {{is the ability to}} load or unload a semi-trailer in a single operation, which can improve efficiency.|$|R
40|$|In {{designing}} {{container terminals}} one {{have to consider}} the choice for a certain type of storage and retrieval equipment by performing a feasibility and economic analysis. In this paper, we compare, by means of a simulation study, the performance of manned <b>straddle</b> <b>carriers</b> and automated stacking cranes. As main performance measure, we use the total travel time required to handle storage and retrieval requests from both the sea- and landside of the terminal. It can be concluded that automated stacking cranes outperform <b>straddle</b> <b>carriers</b> in a stack with a span width smaller than nine containers. From that point on <b>straddle</b> <b>carriers</b> reach a comparable performance. © 2006 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

50|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1951, the Valtion Metallitehtaat group was renamed Valmet Oy. The various factories, which had previously manufactured warships, aircraft and artillery pieces, spent years finding their new purposes. The conversion of an artillery works into a paper machine manufacturer was a success, but import restrictions created serious obstacles in its route to Western markets. The company's shipyard operations were often -and unfavorably - compared to those of Wärtsilä. The airplane industry was maintained to strengthen national security, {{but it was not}} profitable. The branch did, however, make a solid contribution to Valmet's product development and designed, among other things, the <b>straddle</b> <b>carrier</b> used in harbors and manufactured as part of Finland’s war reparations. For decades, the entire conglomerate searched for new fields, such as the manufacture of cars or instrumentation. Modern quality control of production operations entered the Finnish manufacturing industry via Valmet's operations, for example in its car factories. National politics strongly influenced the management and decision-making in the company.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{motivation}} {{of this study}} is the recent advancement of the <b>Straddle</b> <b>Carrier</b> (S/C). Previously <b>Straddle</b> <b>Carrier</b> (S/C) system was used focusing on container lift on/off due to its lower driving speed than that of (Y/T). Shuttle Carrier is evaluated as an upgraded <b>Straddle</b> <b>Carrier.</b> Recently, however, the driving speed of (S/C) has been improved to the level of Yard Tractor and Trailer systems (Y/T), which is 30 Km per hour which makes (S/C) qualified as terminal in-yard transportation equipment. This paper, therefore, aims to evaluate three types of terminal in-yard transportation equipments such as (Y/T), (AGV) and the advanced (S/C) from economic perspective. The results revealed that by observing the total costs of equipment, (S/C) is a cheaper option than (Y/T) over 20 years, and than (AGV) over 6 years...|$|E

50|$|The {{most common}} modern {{application}} for <b>straddle</b> <b>carriers</b> is in port terminals and intermodal yards {{where they are}} used for stacking and moving ISO standard containers.

These machines {{have the ability to}} stack containers up to 4 high. These are capable of relatively low speeds (up to 30 km/h) with a laden container. The workers that use this machinery sit at the very top seated facing the middle as they can see behind them and in front of them. <b>Straddle</b> <b>carriers</b> can lift up to 60 t which equals up to 2 full containers.|$|R
