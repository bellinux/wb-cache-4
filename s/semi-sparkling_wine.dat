50|$|Located in {{the northeastern}} corner of Portugal, the Trás-os-Montes region has {{vineyards}} across {{a wide range of}} altitudes that produces a vast spectrum of wine. The vineyards in the cooler high altitude produces wines that are light bodied while the lower altitude region produces full bodied, highly alcoholic wines. One of the first wines to gain international attention was the semi-sweet, <b>semi-sparkling</b> <b>wine</b> known as rosado.|$|E
25|$|<b>Semi-sparkling</b> is a <b>wine</b> with 1 to 2.5 {{additional}} bars of pressure. <b>Semi-sparkling</b> <b>wines</b> include wines {{labelled as}} Frizzante, Spritzig, Pétillant and Pearl.|$|R
5000|$|Other {{international}} denominations of {{sparkling wine}} include Sekt or Schaumwein (Germany), Cava (Spain), Spumante (Italy) and Espumante (Portugal). <b>Semi-sparkling</b> <b>wines</b> are sparkling wines that contain less than 2.5 atmospheres {{of carbon dioxide}} at sea level and 20 °C. Some countries such as the UK impose a higher tax on fully sparkling <b>wines.</b> Examples of <b>semi-sparkling</b> synonym terms are Frizzante in Italy, Vino de Aguja in Spain and Petillant in France. In most countries except the United States, champagne is legally defined as sparkling wine originating from a region (Champagne, Towns [...] "Reims, Épernay") in France. Still wines are wines that have not gone through the sparkling wine methods and have no effervescence.|$|R
25|$|Fully {{sparkling}} wines, such as Champagne, {{are generally}} sold with 5 to 6 atmospheres of {{pressure in the}} bottle. This is nearly twice the pressure found in an automobile tire. European Union regulations define a sparkling wine as any wine with an excess of 3 atmospheres in pressure. These include German Sekt, Spanish Espumoso, Italian Spumante and French Crémant or Mousseux <b>wines.</b> <b>Semi-sparkling</b> <b>wines</b> are defined as those with between 1 and 2.5 atmospheres of pressures and include German spritzig, Italian frizzante and French pétillant wines. The amount of pressure in the wine {{is determined by the}} amount of sugar added during the tirage stage {{at the beginning of the}} secondary fermentation with more sugar producing increased amount of carbon dioxide gas and thus pressure in the wine.|$|R

40|$|Malvasia di Candia {{aromatic}}a is an aromatic white grape (Vitis vinifera L.) cultivar {{that grows}} in the Emilia-Romagna and Lombardy regions and is used for manufacturing sweet and dry white wines. A study of the gas chromatography analysis of the aromatic profile was carried out during the winemaking process {{for the production of}} a sweet <b>semi-sparkling</b> <b>wine.</b> At the end of the monitoring period, free monoterpenic and fermentative compounds characterised the aromatic profile of the wine. Linalool and nerol had a similar concentration, while the main fermentative compounds were the isoamyl alcohols, 2 -phenylethanol, medium-chain fatty acids and their corresponding ethyl esters, and isoamyl acetate. All these compounds showed increasing trends during the fermentation process. The amount of linalool {{at the end of the}} monitoring period exceeded the threshold of perception, hence contributing to the floral scent of the wine. The higher alcohols (concentration up to 200 mg/L) and their esters also made a pleasant contribution to the aroma definition. Finally, the low temperature of fermentation helped to preserve the varietal aroma and enhanced the production of fermentative compounds, with a corresponding restraint of higher alcohols. This work is a first approach to a study of the sweet <b>semi-sparkling</b> <b>wine</b> (vino frizzante) obtained from Malvasia di Candia aromatica grapes. A more detailed investigation is required to understand how to improve the varietal and fermentative aromas of the wine...|$|E
50|$|The Vinhos Verdes {{are light}} and fresh. At {{less than one}} bar of CO2 pressure, they do not quite qualify as <b>semi-sparkling</b> <b>wines</b> but do have a {{definite}} pétillance, the quality in wine of being only slightly sparkling. The white Vinho Verde is very fresh, due to its natural acidity, with fruity and floral aromas that depend on the grape variety. The white wines are lemon- or straw-coloured, around 8.5 to 11% alcohol, and are made from local grape varieties Loureiro, Arinto, Trajadura, Avesso, and Azal. Vinho Alvarinho is made from Alvarinho grapes, from a small designated subregion of Monção and Melgaço. It has more alcohol (11.5 to 14%) and ripe tropical aromas. The reds are deep red and tannic, and are mostly made from Vinhão, Borraçal and Amaral grapes. The rosés are very fresh and fruity, usually made from Espadeiro and Padeiro grapes.|$|R
50|$|The Basque Country's cuisine {{is one of}} its highest-rated and best-known strengths. Eating well is part of Basque culture, {{hence the}} reverence given to natural {{seasonal}} produce and simple ingredients. We can see the best example of this in Donostia-San Sebastián, the city with the second largest concentration of Michelin stars per square metre in the world. To complement the quality of the food there are the wines from La Rioja Alavesa, which are produced within the control framework of the Qualified Denomination of Origin of Rioja. It also has other wine-growing denominations of origin such as chacolí (from Biscay, Álava and Getaria), a <b>semi-sparkling</b> white <b>wine.</b>|$|R
40|$|Polyurethane based {{polymers}} {{are used}} as adhesives in agglomerated cork stoppers. These cork stoppers improve wine quality when comparing to screw caps or foam. Agglomerated cork stoppers are currently used for still <b>wines,</b> <b>semi-sparkle</b> and gaseous <b>wines,</b> beer and cider. Methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (MDI) is presently the isocyanate used {{in the production of}} polyurethane based adhesive due to its lowest toxicity comparing with toluene diisocyanate (TDI) previously employed. However, free monomeric MDI (fm-MDI) can migrate from agglomerated cork stoppers to beverages. Therefore it needs to be under control. The presence of these compounds are usually investigated by HPLC with Fluorescence or UV-Vis detector depending on the derivatising agent. Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography with Diode Array Detector (UPLC-DAD) method is replacing HPLC with the advantage of decreasing time and solvent consumption. Although optimization is necessary because column and solvent conditions are not the same in both systems. Agglomerated cork stoppers glued with MDI based polyurethane were produced and put in contact with food simulant, ethanol:water 50 : 50, with different times after production. Samples were taken, from each contact time after production, after 15, 60, 120, 360 min, 1 day and 1 month contact period. The same proceeding was also performed using dichloromethane as extraction solvent with agglomerated cork stoppers with two days after production. The samples in contact with food simulant (EtOH:H 2 O) was dried with rotary evaporator, dissolved in the appropriated solvent and fm-MDI determined with the analytical method that was optimized. Secondly key parameters of the migration process are expected to be calculated according to a mathematical model based on the second Fick’s equation. Regarding that MDI reacts rapidly very low concentrations of fm-MDI are expected...|$|R
30|$|Prosecco is an Italian {{sparkling}} or semi-sparklinga white wine, made {{mainly from}} “Glera” grapes, {{and is currently}} the wine with the fastest growing demand worldwideb. Although the name is derived {{from that of the}} Italian village of Prosecco near Trieste, where the grape may have originated, Prosecco is mostly produced in the Veneto region, mainly in Treviso province. Although Glera has been cultivated around the Conegliano and Valdobbiadene hills since the 18 th century, Prosecco’s success has only begun in the last decades, since its mass production as sparkling and <b>semi-sparkling</b> <b>wine.</b> There are now more than 25, 000  ha of Glera vineyards, and more than 350 million bottles are produced annuallyc. Prosecco is now universally recognized as a high quality sparkling wined, and exported all over the world, especially to the USA, Germany and the United Kingdome. This sparkling white wine, rich in freshness, flavors, and with a low alcohol content, is strongly liked by consumers and sales are continuously increasing both in Italy and worldwide. In addition, the Prosecco production method is relatively inexpensivef if compared to those products that are “perceived” as substitutes by consumers of sparkling white wines, spanning from Franciacorta to Cava, to Trento, and even, for particular demand segments, Champagne.|$|E
40|$|Isocyanates are {{included}} into a class with an extreme commercial importance because {{their use in}} the manufacture of polyurethanes. Polyurethanes are used in several applications such as adhesives, coatings, foams, thermoplastics resins, printing inks, foundry moulds and rubbers. Agglomerated cork stoppers are currently used for still <b>wines,</b> <b>semi-sparkle</b> and gaseous <b>wines,</b> beer and cider. Methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (MDI) is presently the isocyanate used in the production of polyurethane based adhesive in use due to its lowest toxicity comparing with toluene diisocyanate (TDI) previously employed. However, free monomeric TDI or MDI, depending on the based polyurethane, can migrate from agglomerated cork stoppers to beverages therefore it needs to be under control. The presence of these compounds are usually investigated by HPLC with Fluorescence or UV-Vis detector depending on the derivatising agent. Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography with Diode Array Detector (UPLC-DAD) method is replacing HPLC. The objective {{of this study is to}} determine which method is better to analyze isocyanates from agglomerated cork stoppers, essentially TDI to quantify its monomer. A Design of Experiments (DOE) with three factors, column temperature, flow and solvent, at two levels was done. Eight experiments with three replications and two repetitions were developed. Through an ANOVA the significance of the factors was evaluated and the best level’s factors were selected. As the TDI has two isomers and in this method these two isomers were not always separated an ANOVA with results of resolution between peaks was performed. The Design of Experiments reveals to be a suitable statistical tool to determine the best conditions to quantified free isocyanates from agglomerated cork stoppers to real foodstuff. The best level’s factors to maximize area was column temperature at 30 ºC, flow to 0, 3 mL/min and solvent 0, 1 % Ammonium Acetate, to maximize resolution was the same except the solvent that was 0, 01 % Ammonium Acetate.

The objective {{of this study is}} to determine which solvent is better to extract isocyanates from agglomerated cork stoppers, essentially MDI to quantify its free monomer. A long term migration study was performed in order to compare with soxhlet extraction. Firstly a global migration test was performed in order to select the best solvents for soxhlet extraction. A Design of Experiments (DOE) with two factors, solvent and wax (to spike adhesive film), at six and two levels, respectively, was done. Six different solvents were put in contact with adhesive film during ten days at a temperature of forty degrees. Experiments were replicated and repeated three times. Through a TWO-WAY ANOVA the significance of solvents was evaluated and the three better solvents selected. Afterwards, soxhlet extraction was performed with the three better solvents, ethanol, acetonitrile and n-heptane, regarding ANOVA results. The other control factors were cycles’ number (20, 55 and 90) and sample type (natural, agglomerated cork stopper and adhesive film). In a fractional factorial DOE, with three factors at three levels, nine experiments with three replicates were performed. The significance of the factors/interactions was evaluated and the best level’s factors were selected. The Design of Experiments reveals to be a suitable statistical tool to determine the best conditions to measure the migration of free isocyanates from agglomerated cork stoppers to real foodstuff. The best solvent to monitor the migration from cork to wine by soxhlet extraction was ethanol although in long term migration the best solvent was acetonitrile.

40|$|Prosecco is a {{sparkling}} or <b>semi-sparkling</b> white <b>wine</b> {{produced in the}} north east of Italy. Due to the great success this wine has had in the last years, in 2009 the production technical policy was reformed to allow an increase of supply. As {{a consequence of the}} reform, the production area was expanded and a double categorization of Prosecco was introduced. The traditional production area gained the DOCG classification (previously it was DOC), which corresponds to the highest quality level for an Italian wine, while the DOC classification was designated to the new production area. At this stage two considerations have to be made: firstly, DOC Prosecco bought by consumers after 2009 was not the same product they had been used to buy before. Secondly, outside Italy, both DOCG and DOC wines are categorized as PDO wine. The question that naturally arises is if consumers (both Italians and non) are now able to recognize the difference between these two apparently identical wines. We addressed this issue through an empirical analysis of Homescan Panel data in the Italian and German markets, using a Heckman probit model. Our results suggest that Prosecco sparkling wine is perceived as a product of medium-high level, and is preferably purchased by households that tend to buy wines with a higher unit price. On the other hand, consumers that more appreciate sparkling wine did not show any preference towards one type or the other, suggesting that they still do not completely understand the difference between these two wines...|$|R
40|$|The rosé {{wine market}} has {{increased}} {{in the last decade}} at both domestic and international level. Following this trend, Italy has strongly increased its production which is mainly exported on international markets, i. e., the growth of international demand is greater than domestic one. Notwithstanding, rosé wines have attracted the attention of retailers while the supply has improved (Ismea, 2008). The success of rosé wines has been accomplished by a greater space devoted to rosé wines in supermarkets since retailers are looking for high turnover products such as rosé wines which may improve the profitability of sales. This paper presents preliminary results of a hedonic price analysis aimed to analyze factors affecting the mechanism of price fixing for rosé wines in Italian supermarkets. An hedonic price analysis (using the natural log of price as dependent variable) has been carried out on 929 records by assessing four different models (all, still, <b>semi-sparkling</b> and sparkling <b>wines).</b> Results confirm the significant effect of intrinsic and extrinsic cues. Retail prices are affected by the point of sale (big supermarkets vs. discount or small ones), certification of origin (denomination of origin vs. table wines), type of wine (still vs. sparkling), sugar content (brut vs. extra dry), alcohol content (with a maximum for medium level) packaging (bottle vs. bag in box; dark glass vs. light one), blend (blend wines vs. no blend ones), price promotion, shelf strategies (position on the shelf, stock facings). However, the price effect is small since most of rosé are basic and popular premium wines. A deeper investigation on still vs. sparkling rosé wines has shown a better price performance of sparkling ones...|$|R
40|$|Rosé wine {{represents}} about 8, 5 % of world wine production (Fregoni, 2010). Europe produces about 3 / 4 of world production, mostly concentrated in France (30 %), (21 %) and Spain (18 %); the Americas produces about the 23 % of world production, especially in United States (18 %). The rosé wine production {{has been driven}} by a strong increase in consumption in the last decade. Actually, the overall consumption of rosé wine is much lower than other wines; notwithstanding, this market segment has reported the strongest consumption increase rate at both Italian and international level. At the end of 2000 s, Italian sales of rosé wines grew by 6 % in value and 5 % in volume. An increase in quality of rosé wines has also been reported (Ismea, 2008) because denomination of origins have been also extended to rosè wines. A survey carried out on Veneto Region (Boatto and Galletto, 2011) has depicted the shape of rosé wine consumer showing that the knowledge is fairly good (about 50 % of people) often linked to some local or traditional sparkling rosé wines (eg. Rabosello, Lambrusco), the image of this wine is being young and appreciated by young people, the consumption is seasonal or occasional and mostly people drink rosé wine at home. The increasing in knowledge and, consequently, in consumption has been accomplished by a greater self space devoted to rosè wines by retailers. Actually, the consumption growth of rosè wines attracts retailers which are looking for products ensuring a better turnover, i. e., rosé wines are replacing matured red or white wines. Accordingly, strategies for rosè wines have been extended to a wide variety on intrinsic and extrinsic cues (quality, origin, bottle, label, etc.) producing a large price range. This paper presents results from a hedonic price analysis aimed to analyze factors affecting the mechanism of price fixing for rosé wines in Italian large retailers. A large literature using hedonic price functions to estimate the relationship between price and wine attributes generally supports the idea that the price is affected by characteristics that are available to consumers before purchasing (Nerlove 1995; Landon and Smith 1997; Combris et al. 2000; Oczkowski, 2001; Schamel and Anderson 2003; Lecocq and Visser, 2006; Couto and Rodrigues, 2007; Almenberg J. and Dreber A., 2011). So far, few studies have been focused on specific market segments such as rosé wines. Methodologically, a survey has been carried out on retailers by collecting data about point of sale features, wine quality (grape variety, blend, vintage, regional origin, types, sugar content, alcohol content) packaging (bottle, tap, glass, label and back label), price, brand, price promotion strategies and visual merchandising (display, facing). An hedonic price analysis (using the natural log of price as dependent variable) has been carried out on 935 records by assessing four different models (all, still, <b>semi-sparkling</b> and sparkling <b>wines).</b> A preliminary analysis on data has shown a wide variability of prices going from over 50 Euros of rosé Champagne, sold in wine shops, to 2 - 3 euros of table rosé, sold in discount, while correlation has allowed to focus attention on discriminating variables and to exclude not significant variables and outliers. Results shows that retail prices are affected by the point of sale (big supermarkets vs. discount or small ones), certification of origin (denomination of origin vs. table wines), type of wine (still vs. sparkling), sugar content (brut vs. extra dry), alcohol content (with a maximum for medium level) packaging (bottle vs. bag in box; dark glass vs. light one), blend (blend wines vs. no blend ones), price promotion, shelf strategies (position on the shelf, facing). However, the analysis do not show significant price effects between domestic and international wines while the brand effect cannot be recognize because of scarce observations, i. e., dispersion among many brands. Most of the previous variables show significant effects also in the sub-models. However, in the still rosé model we have found a relevant role also for the international origin...|$|R
