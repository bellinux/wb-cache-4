40|$|Over {{the last}} forty years much {{progress}} has been made in the investigation <b>of</b> the <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> uniform space. In particular, Bushaw, Kent, Ramsey and Richardson published several articles concerning the <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> uniform space. The aim of this dissertation is to begin a similar investigation into the <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> quasi-uniform space. It starts off with <b>a</b> summary <b>of</b> results obtained for the <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> uniform space, which, has been investigated in the past. We conclude by commencing an investigation into the <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> quasi-uniform space. Here several results obtained for the <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> uniform space are generalized, and some original results for the <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> quasi-uniform space are presented.

40|$|Exercise offers {{significant}} {{health benefits}} to older people, {{but may also}} carry risks of injury and cardiovascular events. These can be minimized with appropriate screening, prescription, and monitoring <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>exercise</b> program.

Exercise professionals can provide valuable assistance with screening, prescription, and supervision <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>exercise</b> program, but limited access to experienced staff and supervised programs remains a significant barrier to exercise participation.

40|$|The {{problem of}} normal values of blood {{pressure}} after exercise {{taking into account}} the blood pressure {{at the end of the}} exercise test is discussed. Hypertensives showed a lower working capacity than normotensives. In normotensives, however, systolic blood pressure at the end <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>exercise</b> correlated well with the working capacity. After the endurance cure submaximal blood pressure was markedly lower in hypertensives with a striking dependence on the level of initial values. Systolic blood pressure at the end <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>exercise</b> test was not changed significantly. Most probably it is not possible to overcome this malregulation in hypertensives by endurance training alone...|$|R
40|$|With {{advances}} in ICT around the world, digital tutors are an increasingly attractive option to provide education {{to a large}} audience inexpensively. Important components <b>of</b> <b>a</b> digital tutor include the <b>exercises</b> or <b>a</b> method to generate <b>exercises,</b> <b>an</b> algorithm for finding and verifying solutions to <b>exercises</b> and <b>a</b> method <b>of</b> providing hints to a student while the student is working on <b>an</b> <b>exercise.</b> The domain reasoner models all paths from the proposition(s) <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>exercise</b> to the solution(s). This enables the digital tutor to provide hints from any situation the student might encounter. This thesis contributes a method to generate a domain reasoner from <b>an</b> <b>exercise</b> solution {{in the domain of}} high school level geometry exercises. The program representing a solution to <b>an</b> <b>exercise</b> is first represented as a directed acyclic graph of which the edges represent steps in the solution. Each edge uses a formal rule to execute a step and human-readable hints are attached to these rules. Since an algorithm for generating solutions from the formal description <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>exercises</b> currently exists, this domain reasoner enables the generation of hints from just that formal description <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>exercise.</b> The exercise-specific domain reasoner enables feedforward, feedback and worked-out examples as well as <b>a</b> degree <b>of</b> adaptivity to <b>a</b> student's knowledge by providing hints for steps composed of smaller steps...|$|R

40|$|We {{argue that}} {{military}} exercises can create {{four types of}} risk?accidents, hostility, reciprocity, and crises. The level <b>of</b> risk <b>an</b> <b>exercise</b> creates is determined by two factors.

The second factor is the perceived level <b>of</b> threat <b>an</b> <b>exercise</b> creates for <b>an</b> adversary. <b>Exercises</b> that have {{close proximity to the}} adversary, have high magnitude, and have low transparency all increase the threat level <b>of</b> <b>a</b> military <b>exercise.</b> This creates incentives for an adversary to respond in a way that creates risks for all parties...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this pilot}} trial was to study the {{effectiveness}} <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>exercise</b> programme {{in the treatment of}} chronic rotator cuff tendinopathy.

The exercise programme was given daily (apart from weekends) for 4 weeks. The patients in the group B (placebo group, n= 10) received placebo tablets (unmarked vitamin C) twice daily for four weeks. Patients’ pain was evaluated using a visual analogue scale (VaS) {{at the end of the}} four-week course of treatment (week 4) and three months after the end of treatment (week 16). Differences between groups were determined using the independent t test. The difference within groups between baseline and end of treatment was analysed with a paired t test. At the end of treatment there was a decline in visual analogue <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> about 7 units in the exercise programme group compared with baseline (p 0. 0005, independent t test) in favour of the exercise programme group.
