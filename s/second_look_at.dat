40|$|This study {{examined}} how searchers interacted with a web-based, faceted library catalog when conducting exploratory searches. It applied eye tracking, stimulated recall interviews, and direct observation to investigate {{important aspects of}} gaze behavior in a faceted search interface: what components of the interface searchers <b>looked</b> <b>at,</b> for how long, and in what order. It yielded empirical data that will be useful for both practitioners (e. g., for improving search interface designs), and researchers (e. g., to inform models of search behavior). Results of the study show that participants spent about 50 <b>seconds</b> per task <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> (fixating on) the results, about 25 <b>seconds</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> the facets, and only about 6 <b>seconds</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> the query itself.

25|$|The {{son of the}} rector of Dallinghoo, Walford {{was educated}} at Harrow School and at Trinity College, Cambridge. As a cricketer, he was a middle- or lower-order batsman, {{though it is not}} known whether he batted right- or left-handed. His two {{first-class}} matches came within a fortnight of each other in May 1860. In the first, scores of 7 and 25 for the Cambridge University team against the Cambridge Town Club were enough for the university team to want to take a <b>second</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> him, and he was duly picked for the MCC team to play against the university, a frequent ploy in university cricket at the time, but then failed to score in his only innings. Although he played in minor matches for the Cambridge team across the rest of the 1860 season, he was not picked for the University Match against Oxford University and played no further first-class games.|$|E

500|$|Billboard {{magazine}} called the song [...] "a Pussycat Dolls-inspired contempo jam, high on hooks and of-the-moment production. Well done, {{if in the}} most generic sense." [...] About.com's Bill Lamb gave the song 4/5 stars, saying that with [...] "Say It Right", [...] "many pop music fans are likely to take a <b>second</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> purchasing [...] ". He described the song as [...] "the foundation of Loose" [...] and [...] "a welcomed presence in the pop top 40". IGN Music calls the song [...] "...one of the brightest moments on the album" [...] and [...] "another throwback to the '80s" [...] which [...] "...lets loose with the most hypnotic chorus". Allmusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine considered the song [...] "a dark meditative piece that would have fit on [...] previous records". The New York Times described the song as [...] "building a groove from hard drums and ghostly, multitracked voices, and Ms. Furtado sings a melancholy chorus she doesn't quite believe", comparing the coda, with music getting louder and then slowly fading, [...] "the way the best — and worst — nights out often do". Also, DJ Z's reviewed the song as [...] "the only single {{in the world to}} work at both a club in Manhattan, and on a safari through the natives land of (fill in the blank)."

500|$|Munsey's {{plan for}} the {{magazines}} was {{laid out in a}} note that appeared in the first four issues: [...] "This magazine is the answer to thousands of requests we have received over a period of years, demanding a <b>second</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> famous fantasies which, since their original publication, have become accepted classics. [...] Our choice has been dictated by your requests and our firm belief that these are the aces of imaginative fiction." [...] The first issue included Ray Cummings' [...] "The Girl in the Golden Atom" [...] and A. Merritt's [...] "The Moon Pool", both popular stories by well-known authors. [...] Merritt's sequel, [...] "The Conquest of the Moon Pool", began serialization in the next issue, with illustrations by Virgil Finlay. [...] Finlay did many illustrations for Famous Fantastic Mysteries over its lifetime, and became one of its most popular artists. [...] Frank R. Paul began illustrating for the magazine with the third issue; he was not as capable an artist as Finlay but was very popular with the readers. [...] The first five covers were simply tables of contents, but with the sixth issue, dated March 1940, pictorial covers began, with Finlay the artist for that first cover. [...] Three early covers in 1940 were painted by Paul, but thereafter almost every cover was painted by either Finlay, Lawrence Stevens, or his son, Peter Stevens, including every single issue from February 1941 through April 1950. [...] The high quality of the artwork helped make the magazine {{one of the most popular}} of its day, and sf historian Thomas Clareson has suggested that it was Finlay's work in Famous Fantastic Mysteries and Fantastic Novels that made his reputation.|$|E

[...] He states that Gannon has failed to provide any factual evidence {{that a group of}} killers exists, and that others, like reporter Kristi Piehl (the original reporter of Gannon and Duarte's theory), and some of the parents of the young men, who were at first encouraged by Gannon, now wonder if he isn't actually hurting the families who are trying to get over the loss of a child. [...] One of the parents, Bill Szostak, and Rosario even speculate that Gannon is out for either money or the notoriety and press attention.

2500|$|Clifford Odets {{had been}} {{a close friend of}} Garfield from the early days in the Bronx. After Odets' one-act play Waiting for Lefty became a {{surprise}} hit, the Group announced it would mount a production of his full-length drama Awake and Sing. At the playwright's insistence, Garfield was cast as Ralph, the sensitive young son who pleads for [...] "a chance to get to first base." [...] The play opened in February 1935, and Garfield was singled out by critic Brooks Atkinson for having a [...] "splendid sense of character development." [...] Garfield's apprenticeship was officially over; he was voted full membership by the company. Odets was the man of the moment, and he claimed to the press that Garfield was his [...] "find" [...] and that he would soon write a play just for him. That play {{would turn out to be}} Golden Boy, but when Luther Adler was cast in the lead role instead, a disillusioned Garfield began to take a <b>second</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the overtures being made by Hollywood.|$|E

2500|$|Rains filed a {{supplemental}} motion arguing that Judge Clay {{should take a}} <b>second</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> a ruling that barred the defense attorney from presenting evidence about Grant's criminal background, {{as well as a}} ruling that barred him from presenting evidence that Mehserle told a fellow officer just before the shooting incident that he planned to use his Taser on Grant. He protested that [...] "Both rulings amount to grave errors under longstanding and never-questioned California authorities" [...] and alleged that they [...] "substantially interfere with Mehserle's federal due process right to defend against the murder charge." [...] Rains ailed to convince Judge Clay to remove District Attorney Tom Orloff's office from the case. Rains claimed Orloff violated his client's rights because he ordered two Oakland police officers to try to interview Mehserle after he was arrested, even though Orloff knew Mehserle had an attorney. Judge Clay said Orloff's actions did not prove a bias nor did it meet the requirements necessary for him to be removed from the case.|$|E
2500|$|Jane Austen famously {{wrote to}} her nephew James Edward Austen that his [...] "strong, manly, {{spirited}} Sketches, full of Variety and Glow" [...] would not fit on [...] "the little bit (two Inches wide) of Ivory on which I work with so fine a Brush, as produces little effect after much labour." [...] Austen novels have often been characterized as [...] "country house novels" [...] or as [...] "comedies of manners". Comedies of manners are concerned [...] "with the relations and intrigues of gentlemen and ladies living in a polished and sophisticated society" [...] and the comedy {{is the result of}} [...] "violations of social conventions and decorum, and relies for its effect in great part on the wit and sparkle of the dialogue." [...] However, Austen's novels also have important fairy tale elements to them. Pride and Prejudice follows the traditional Cinderella plot while [...] "Persuasion rewrites the Cinderella narrative, as it shifts the fairy tale's emphasis from the heroine's transformation into a beauty to the prince's <b>second</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> her face." [...] However, Fanny, in Mansfield Park, rejects the Prince Charming character and at least one scholar has suggested that in this Austen is signalling [...] "a general attack on the dangers of 'fiction'".|$|E
2500|$|There {{was some}} {{disagreement}} over Wilfork's role in causing the fumble. In the Patriots' postgame press conference, Wilfork recalled: [...] "I was just fighting pressure with pressure—knowing, seeing the ball went that way. I'm just taught to fight pressure with pressure, so I just started fighting back and knocked him into Sanchez and {{it created a}} fumble." [...] In NBC's television broadcast, immediately following the play, color commentator Cris Collinsworth said that [...] "Vince Wilfork just threw Brandon Moore into Mark Sanchez," [...] a view simultaneously echoed on the Patriots radio call by color analyst Scott Zolak. Moore disagreed with Collinsworth: [...] "when somebody slides {{into the back of}} you, you're going to fall. That happens a lot in general. You don't know what's going on (behind you)." [...] Responding to Moore, Collinsworth qualified his description in a phone interview with ESPN, saying that Wilfork could see the play develop, so [...] "instead of trying to go around Moore, he pushed him back into the play and made the whole thing happen." [...] A New York Daily News columnist sided with Moore, stating that [...] "A <b>second</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the play shows Moore holding his own against Wilfork and moving, if anything, mostly forward." ...|$|E
