25|$|Feminism in Poland {{started in}} the 1800s {{in the age of}} the foreign Partitions. Poland's {{precursor}} of feminism, Narcyza Å»michowska, founded a group of Suffragettes in 1842. Prior to the last Partition in 1795, tax-paying females were allowed to take part in political life. Since 1918, following the return to independence, all women could vote. Poland was the 15th (12th <b>sovereign)</b> <b>country</b> to introduce universal women's suffrage. Currently, in Poland abortion is allowed only in special circumstances, such as when the woman's life or health is endangered by the continuation of pregnancy, when the pregnancy is a result of a criminal act, or when the fetus is seriously malformed. Homosexuality in Poland was confirmed as legal in 1932. Also, Poland recognises gender change. Trafficking women is 'illegal and rare' (top results worldwide).|$|E

The first country to recognize the independence of Latvia de jure was Soviet Russia on 11 August 1920, when the Soviet-Latvian Peace treaty was signed (it is generally considered that the independence of Latvia de jure was internationally recognized on 26 January 1921, when it was recognized by the Allies of World War I). The declaration notes that in April 1920 the Latvian nation followed the principle of self-determination by electing a Constitutional Assembly of Latvia, which adopted the Constitution of Latvia on 15 February 1922, in general, equal and direct elections, based on proportional representation.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the major}} {{developments}} in Southeast Asia during Gandhi's premiership was {{the formation of the}} Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in 1967. Relations between ASEAN and India was mutually antagonistic. ASEAN in the Indian perception was linked to the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO), and it was therefore, seen as a pro-American organisation. On their part, the ASEAN nations were unhappy with Gandhi's sympathy for the Viet Cong and India's strong links with the USSR. Furthermore, they were also apprehensions in the region about Gandhi's future plans, particularly after India played a big role in breaking up Pakistan and facilitating in the emergence of Bangladesh as a <b>sovereign</b> <b>country</b> in 1971. India's entry into the nuclear weapons club in 1974 contributed to tensions in Southeast Asia. Relations only began to improve following Gandhi's endorsement of the ZOPFAN declaration and the disintegration of the SEATO alliance in the aftermath of Pakistani and American defeats in the region. Nevertheless, Gandhi's close relations with reunified Vietnam and her decision to recognize the Vietnam installed Government of Cambodia in 1980 meant that India and ASEAN were not able to develop a viable partnership.|$|E

25|$|Kennedy's {{majority}} opinion {{begins with an}} over-twenty page review {{of the history of}} habeas corpus in England from its roots in the due process clause of Magna Carta of 1215 to the 19th century. Next, the opinion surveys American historical jurisprudence on the writ from 1789 until shortly after World War II, concentrating on the application of habeas corpus to aliens and territories outside the borders of the United States that still fall under United States control, comparing these areas to the Channel Islands, where the writ did apply. While noting that habeas corpus did not apply in Scotland, a country {{under the control of the}} English crown (as the same monarch held the crown of Scotland), the Court distinguished that fact by stating that Scotland kept its unique system of laws even after union with England in 1707. The Court turned to Ireland for a more amenable historical example, pointing out that while it was nominally a <b>sovereign</b> <b>country</b> in the 18th century, English habeas corpus review did apply there since Ireland was under de facto English control and shared the English legal system.|$|E
25|$|A {{majority}} of sovereign states recognise Abkhazia {{as an integral}} part of Georgia and support its territorial integrity according to the principles of international law, although Belarus has expressed sympathy toward the recognition of Abkhazia. Some have officially noted Abkhazia as under occupation by the Russian military. The United Nations has been urging both sides to settle the dispute through diplomatic dialogue and ratifying the final status of Abkhazia in the Georgian constitution. However, the Abkhaz de facto government considers Abkhazia a <b>sovereign</b> <b>country</b> even if it is recognised by few other countries. In early 2000, then-UN Special Representative of the Secretary General Dieter Boden and the Group of Friends of Georgia, consisting of the representatives of Russia, the United States, Britain, France, and Germany, drafted and informally presented a document to the parties outlining a possible distribution of competencies between the Abkhaz and Georgian authorities, based on core respect for Georgian territorial integrity. The Abkhaz side, however, has never accepted the paper as a basis for negotiations. Eventually, Russia also withdrew its approval of the document. In 2005 and 2008, the Georgian government offered Abkhazia a high degree of autonomy and possible federal structure within the borders and jurisdiction of Georgia.|$|E
25|$|The document, {{published}} in December 2016, seeks for Scotland {{to remain a}} member of the European Single Market to allow the Economy of Scotland to benefit from free trade deals across the remaining 27 European Union nations. Furthermore, it seeks that remaining within the European Single Market would be beneficial for trade across the entire United Kingdom, whereby it benefits the economies of both Scotland and the United Kingdom as well as benefiting the wider economy and trade of the European Union. Within Scotland's Place in Europe, the Scottish Government highlights that there are several ways that Scotland could retain its membership of the European Single Market, but most notably by becoming an independent <b>sovereign</b> <b>country</b> within the EU which is the preferred option of Sturgeon and the wider SNP led-Scottish Government. Other than trade and single market membership, Sturgeon advocates the importance of the rights of EU nationals currently working and residing within Scotland and that there rights and liberties are protected post-Brexit. As immigration and border controls remain a reserved matter, Sturgeon has called on strong working with Prime Minister Theresa May and the UK Government to ensure this is achieved. Other issues set in the document include protection over laws and legislation which affects Scotland, protection of worker's rights and entitlements, a review of the devolution settlement in Scotland that will be affected by Brexit such as farming and fishery industries and additional powers granted to Scotland to protect and promote Scottish interests.|$|E

As far as their partners in Israel are concerned, I myself don't understand the idea of continuing to develop the settlements.

After all, the National Front has always been Zionistic and always defended Israel's right to exist". She has opposed the immigration of French Jews to Israel in response to radical Islam, explaining: [...] "The Jews of France are Frenchmen, they're at home here, and they must stay here and not emigrate. The country is obligated to provide solutions to the development of radical Islam in the problematic regions".|$|E

This state was to be created through the establishment of paramilitary forces and the provocation of incidents {{in order to create}} a situation where the JNA could intervene.

500|$|Proto-globalization {{differed}} from modern globalization in {{the practices of}} expansionism, methods of managing global trade, finances, as well as commercial innovation. With the shift of expansionism by large nations to Western Europe, nations began competing {{in an effort to}} achieve world domination. The rise of larger-scale conflicts between these powerful nations over expanding their wealth led to nations taking control over one anotherâs territory and then moving products and the accumulated wealth of these conquered regions back to the <b>sovereign</b> <b>country.</b> [...] Although conflicts occurred throughout the world between 1600 and 1800, European powers found themselves far more equipped to handle the pressures of war. A quote by Christopher Alan Bayly gives a better interpretation of these advantages by stating, [...] "Europeans became much better at killing people. The European ideological wars of the 17th century had created links between war, finance, and commercial innovation which extended all these gains. It gave the Continent a brute advantage in world conflicts which broke out in the 18th century. Western European warfare was peculiarly complicated and expensive, partly because it was amphibious." [...] These battle-tested nations fought for their own needs, but in reality their success increased European advancement in the global market. Each of the following sections will shed light on the history of several key engagements. Whether a war was religious or commercial, its impact was greatly felt throughout the world. British victories during the Anglo-Dutch Wars led to their dominance in commercial shipping and naval power. The stage was set for future conflicts between Britain and foreign nations, as well as domestic frustration with âthe motherlandâ on the North American continent. The French and Indian War, fought between the European powers of France and England, led to a British victory and resulted in continued dominance in maritime enterprise. The American Revolutionary War {{marked the beginning of the}} power shift for control over foreign markets.|$|E

Second, when allowance is made for economic determinants, industrialization in dependent countries in 1960 is found to be significantly lower than in <b>sovereign</b> <b>countries.</b> This result is shown to be quite robust to changes in data, sample size, functional forms, and specifications of the estimating equations.
