5|$|The {{body of a}} teleost is denser than water, so fish must {{compensate}} for the difference or they will sink. Many teleosts have a <b>swim</b> <b>bladder</b> that adjusts their buoyancy through manipulation of gases {{to allow them to}} stay at the current water depth, or ascend or descend without having to waste energy in swimming. In the more primitive groups like some minnows, the <b>swim</b> <b>bladder</b> is open to the esophagus and doubles as a lung. It is often absent in fast-swimming fishes such as the tuna and mackerel. In fish where the <b>swim</b> <b>bladder</b> is closed, the gas content is controlled through the rete mirabilis, a network of blood vessels serving as a countercurrent gas exchanger between the <b>swim</b> <b>bladder</b> and the blood. The Chondrostei such as sturgeons also have a <b>swim</b> <b>bladder,</b> but this appears to have evolved separately: other Actinopterygii such as the bowfin and the bichir do not have one, so swim bladders appear to have arisen twice, and the teleost <b>swim</b> <b>bladder</b> is not homologous with the chondrostean one.|$|E
5|$|To attract mates, some teleosts produce sounds, {{either by}} stridulation or by {{vibrating}} the <b>swim</b> <b>bladder.</b> In the Sciaenidae, the muscles that {{attached to the}} swim blabber cause it to oscillate rapidly, creating drumming sounds. Marine catfishes, sea horses and grunts stridulate by rubbing together skeletal parts, teeth or spines. In these fish, the <b>swim</b> <b>bladder</b> may act as a resonator. Stridulation sounds are predominantly from 1000–4000 Hz, though sounds modified by the <b>swim</b> <b>bladder</b> have frequencies lower than 1000Hz.|$|E
5|$|It is {{now clear}} that the common {{ancestor}} of the bony fishes (Osteichthyes) had a primitive air-breathing lung—later evolved into a <b>swim</b> <b>bladder</b> in most actinopterygians (ray-finned fishes). This suggests that crossopterygians evolved in warm shallow waters, using their simple lung when the oxygen level in the water became too low.|$|E
50|$|The {{cartilaginous}} fish (e.g., {{sharks and}} rays) split {{from the other}} fishes about 420 million years ago, and lack both lungs and <b>swim</b> <b>bladders,</b> suggesting that these structures evolved after that split. Correspondingly, these fish also have both heterocercal and pectoral fins which provide the necessary lift needed {{due to the lack}} of <b>swim</b> <b>bladders.</b> Teleost fish with <b>swim</b> <b>bladders</b> have neutral buoyancy, and have no need for this lift.|$|R
50|$|While {{reviewing}} the species, McKay only {{was able to}} examine the <b>swim</b> <b>bladders</b> of juveniles. He found the juveniles to have well-developed <b>swim</b> <b>bladders</b> with no posterior or anterior extensions, but the duct like process well developed.|$|R
50|$|Lungs {{originated}} as {{an extra}} pair of pouches in the throat, behind the gill pouches. They were probably present in the last common ancestor of bony fishes. In some fishes they evolved into <b>swim</b> <b>bladders</b> for maintaining buoyancy. Lungs and <b>swim</b> <b>bladders</b> are homologous (descended from a common ancestral form) {{as is the case}} for the pulmonary artery (which delivers de-oxygenated blood from the heart to the lungs) and the arteries that supply <b>swim</b> <b>bladders.</b> Air was introduced into the lungs by a process known as buccal pumping.|$|R
5|$|To {{function}} in gas exchange, lungs required a blood supply. In cartilaginous fishes and teleosts, the heart lies {{low in the}} body and pumps blood forward through the ventral aorta, which splits up in a series of paired aortic arches, each corresponding to a gill arch. The aortic arches then merge above the gills to form a dorsal aorta supplying the body with oxygenated blood. In lungfishes, bowfin and bichirs, the <b>swim</b> <b>bladder</b> is supplied with blood by paired pulmonary arteries branching off from the hindmost (6th) aortic arch. The same basic pattern is found in the lungfish Protopterus and in terrestrial salamanders, and was probably the pattern found in the tetrapods' immediate ancestors as well as the first tetrapods. In most other bony fishes the <b>swim</b> <b>bladder</b> is supplied with blood by the dorsal aorta.|$|E
5|$|The bony fish lineage shows more derived {{anatomical}} traits, {{often with}} major evolutionary changes from {{the features of}} ancient fish. They have a bony skeleton, are generally laterally flattened, have five pairs of gills protected by an operculum, and a mouth {{at or near the}} tip of the snout. The dermis is covered with overlapping scales. Bony fish have a <b>swim</b> <b>bladder</b> which helps them maintain a constant depth in the water column, but not a cloaca. They mostly spawn a large number of small eggs with little yolk which they broadcast into the water column.|$|E
5|$|The major {{means of}} {{respiration}} in teleosts, {{as in most}} other fish, is the transfer of gases {{over the surface of}} the gills as water is drawn in through the mouth and pumped out through the gills. Apart from the <b>swim</b> <b>bladder,</b> which contains a small amount of air, the body does not have oxygen reserves, and respiration needs to be continuous over the fish's life. Some teleosts exploit habitats where the oxygen availability is low, such as stagnant water or wet mud; they have developed accessory tissues and organs to support gas exchange in these habitats.|$|E

50|$|Many fish {{maintain}} buoyancy with <b>swim</b> <b>bladders.</b> However elasmobranchs lack <b>swim</b> <b>bladders,</b> {{and maintain}} buoyancy instead with large livers that {{are full of}} oil. This stored oil may also function as a nutrient when food is scarce. Deep sea sharks are usually targeted for their oil, because the livers of these species can weigh up to 20% of their total weight.|$|R
40|$|Online enhancement: color figure. Several times {{throughout}} their radiation fish have evolved either lungs or <b>swim</b> <b>bladders</b> as gas-holding structures. Lungs and <b>swim</b> <b>bladders</b> have different ontogenetic origins {{and can be}} used either for buoyancy or as an accessory respiratory organ. Therefore, the presence of air-filled bladders or lungs in different groups of fishes is an example of convergent evolution. We propose that air breathing could not occur without th...|$|R
5|$|The most basal of {{the living}} teleosts are the Elopomorpha (eels and allies) and the Osteoglossomorpha (elephantfishes and allies). There are 800 species of elopomorphs. They have thin leaf-shaped larvae known as leptocephali, {{specialised}} for a marine environment. Among the elopomorphs, eels have elongated bodies with lost pelvic girdles and ribs and fused elements in the upper jaw. The 200 species of osteoglossomorphs are defined by a bony element in the tongue. This element has a basibranchial behind it, and both structures have large teeth which are paired with the teeth on the parasphenoid in {{the roof of the}} mouth. The clade Otocephala includes the Clupeiformes (herrings) and Ostariophysi (carps, catfishes and allies). Clupeiformes consist of 350 living species of herring and herring-like fishes. This group is characterised by an unusual abdominal scute and a different arrangement of the hypurals. In most species, the <b>swim</b> <b>bladder</b> extends to the braincase and plays a role in hearing. Ostariophysi, which includes most freshwater fishes, have developed some unique adaptations. One is the Weberian apparatus, an arrangement of bones (Weberian ossicles) connecting the <b>swim</b> <b>bladder</b> to the inner ear. This enhances their hearing, as sound waves make the bladder vibrate, and the bones transport the vibrations to the inner ear. They also have a chemical alarm system; when a fish is injured, the warning substance gets in the water, alarming nearby fish.|$|E
5|$|Most fish move by {{alternately}} contracting paired sets {{of muscles}} {{on either side}} of the backbone. These contractions form S-shaped curves that move down the body. As each curve reaches the back fin, backward force is applied to the water, and in conjunction with the fins, moves the fish forward. The fish's fins function like an airplane's flaps. Fins also increase the tail's surface area, increasing speed. The streamlined body of the fish decreases the amount of friction from the water. Since body tissue is denser than water, fish must compensate for the difference or they will sink. Many bony fish have an internal organ called a <b>swim</b> <b>bladder</b> that adjusts their buoyancy through manipulation of gases.|$|E
5|$|Sharks and {{rays are}} basal fish with {{numerous}} primitive anatomical features {{similar to those}} of ancient fish, including skeletons composed of cartilage. Their bodies tend to be dorso-ventrally flattened, they usually have five pairs of gill slits and a large mouth set {{on the underside of the}} head. The dermis is covered with separate dermal placoid scales. They have a cloaca into which the urinary and genital passages open, but not a <b>swim</b> <b>bladder.</b> Cartilaginous fish produce a small number of large, yolky eggs. Some species are ovoviviparous and the young develop internally but others are oviparous and the larvae develop externally in egg cases.|$|E

50|$|Marine organisms like dinoflagellates, pelagic {{invertebrates}} and fishes store low-density wax esters {{in their}} <b>swim</b> <b>bladders</b> or other tissues to provide buoyancy.|$|R
50|$|The sounds {{they make}} when {{grinding}} their teeth earned them their common name. They use their <b>swim</b> <b>bladders</b> to amplify this sound.|$|R
5|$|Teleosts possess highly {{developed}} sensory organs. Nearly all daylight fish have colour vision {{at least as}} good as a normal human's. Many fish also have chemoreceptors responsible for acute senses of taste and smell. Most fish have sensitive receptors that form the lateral line system, which detects gentle currents and vibrations, and senses the motion of nearby fish and prey. Fish sense sounds in a variety of ways, using the lateral line, the <b>swim</b> <b>bladder,</b> and in some species the Weberian apparatus. Fish orient themselves using landmarks, and may use mental maps based on multiple landmarks or symbols. Experiments with mazes show that fish possess the spatial memory needed to make such a mental map.|$|E
5|$|The Pacific blue-eye {{is found}} in loose schools of tens to {{thousands}} of fish. They are generally found in the mid- to upper water column within 1 metre (3 ft) of the riverbank and often close to underwater cover. The Pacific blue-eye is euryhaline—it can survive {{in a wide range}} of water salinities from fresh-water to marine environments. It responds to changes in salinity (and resulting change in buoyancy) by changing the volume of its <b>swim</b> <b>bladder,</b> which takes up to 6 hours and 40 minutes when salinity is reduced and around 5 hours when it is increased. In the meantime, the fish can swim with a head-up or head-down posture, which either increases or decreases buoyancy respectively. This adaptation helps the fish in the range of salinities it encounters in its estuarine environment.|$|E
5|$|Fish from {{multiple}} groups can live {{out of the}} water for extended periods. Amphibious fish such as the mudskipper can live and move about on land for up to several days, or live in stagnant or otherwise oxygen depleted water. Many such fish can breathe air via a variety of mechanisms. The skin of anguillid eels may absorb oxygen directly. The buccal cavity of the electric eel may breathe air. Catfish of the families Loricariidae, Callichthyidae, and Scoloplacidae absorb air through their digestive tracts. Lungfish, {{with the exception of the}} Australian lungfish, and bichirs have paired lungs similar to those of tetrapods and must surface to gulp fresh air through the mouth and pass spent air out through the gills. Gar and bowfin have a vascularized <b>swim</b> <b>bladder</b> that functions in the same way. Loaches, trahiras, and many catfish breathe by passing air through the gut. Mudskippers breathe by absorbing oxygen across the skin (similar to frogs). A number of fish have evolved so-called accessory breathing organs that extract oxygen from the air. Labyrinth fish (such as gouramis and bettas) have a labyrinth organ above the gills that performs this function. A few other fish have structures resembling labyrinth organs in form and function, most notably snakeheads, pikeheads, and the Clariidae catfish family.|$|E

5|$|The lung/swim bladder {{originated}} as {{an outgrowth}} of the gut, forming a gas-filled bladder above the digestive system. In its primitive form, the air bladder was open to the alimentary canal, a condition called physostome and still found in many fish. The primary function is not entirely certain. One consideration is buoyancy. The heavy scale armour of the early bony fishes would certainly weigh the animals down. In cartilaginous fishes, lacking a <b>swim</b> <b>bladder,</b> the open sea sharks need to swim constantly to avoid sinking into the depths, the pectoral fins providing lift. Another factor is oxygen consumption. Ambient oxygen was relatively low in the early Devonian, possibly about half of modern values. Per unit volume, there is much more oxygen in air than in water, and vertebrates are active animals with a high energy requirement compared to invertebrates of similar sizes. The Devonian saw increasing oxygen levels which opened up new ecological niches by allowing groups able to exploit the additional oxygen to develop into active, large-bodied animals. Particularly in tropical swampland habitats, atmospheric oxygen is much more stable, and may have prompted a reliance of lungs rather than gills for primary oxygen uptake. In the end, both buoyancy and breathing may have been important, and some modern physostome fishes do indeed use their bladders for both.|$|E
25|$|Like {{all species}} of sillaginid, the <b>swim</b> <b>bladder</b> {{is the most}} {{dependable}} diagnostic feature. Japanese whiting have a <b>swim</b> <b>bladder</b> characterised by a single, long posterior extension which tapers to a slender point. The anterior end of the organ has three long median projections, with the central extension the longest.|$|E
25|$|The King George whiting is {{the only}} member of the genus Sillaginodes and is further {{distinguished}} from any other possible taxa assigned to that genus by a number of distinct anatomical features. It is the largest of the Sillaginid fishes with 129 to 147 lateral line scales, and like all fishes in the family is best distinguished by the shape of its <b>swim</b> <b>bladder.</b> In plan view, the <b>swim</b> <b>bladder</b> has a land slug-like appearance, with a posteriorly tapering extension and two anterolateral extensions or ‘horns’. There are no duct-like processes on the ventral surface unlike taxa in the genus Sillago.|$|E
5000|$|Physoclist <b>swim</b> <b>bladders</b> {{have one}} {{important}} disadvantage: they prohibit fast rising, as the bladder would burst. Physostomes can [...] "burp" [...] out gas, though this complicates {{the process of}} re-submergence.|$|R
50|$|In some Asian cultures, the <b>swim</b> <b>bladders</b> {{of certain}} large fishes are {{considered}} a food delicacy. In China they are known as fish maw, 花膠/鱼鳔, and are served in soups or stews.|$|R
50|$|Fish {{can sense}} sound through their lateral lines and their {{otoliths}} (ears). Some fishes, such as some species of carp and herring, hear through their <b>swim</b> <b>bladders,</b> which function {{rather like a}} hearing aid.|$|R
25|$|The <b>swim</b> <b>bladder</b> has a short {{anterior}} extension, {{which is}} significantly longer in older individuals, {{while there are}} also 5 short, pointed anterolateral projections. There is a single, poorly developed posterior projection and a poorly developed duct like process on the ventral surface.|$|E
25|$|Pressure {{detection}} {{uses the}} organ of Weber, a system consisting of three appendages of vertebrae transferring changes in {{shape of the}} gas bladder to the middle ear. It {{can be used to}} regulate the buoyancy of the fish. Fish like the weather fish and other loaches are also known to respond to low pressure areas but they lack a <b>swim</b> <b>bladder.</b>|$|E
25|$|Characins {{possess a}} Weberian apparatus, {{a series of}} bony parts {{connecting}} the <b>swim</b> <b>bladder</b> and inner ear. Superficially, the Characiformes somewhat resemble their relatives of the order Cypriniformes, but have a small fleshy adipose fin between the dorsal fin and tail. Most species have teeth within the mouth, since they are often carnivorous. The body is almost always covered in well-defined scales. The mouth is also usually not truly protractile.|$|E
5000|$|The genus {{belongs to}} the {{subfamily}} Stelliferinae, whose members have double-chambered <b>swim</b> <b>bladders</b> (the smaller front chamber is [...] "yoke-shaped" [...] and the main chamber is [...] "carrot-shaped") and two pairs of large otoliths.|$|R
