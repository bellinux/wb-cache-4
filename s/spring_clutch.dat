5000|$|Laycock's {{principal}} product became <b>spring</b> diaphragm <b>clutches.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Two [...] Lycoming T53 shaft-turbines {{were used}} to drive the two 14 ft {{four-bladed}} propellers. The engines were interconnected by cross shafts, {{so that in the}} event of the failure of one engine, it would automatically disconnect (through torque <b>spring</b> <b>clutches)</b> and both propellers would be driven by the remaining engine.|$|R
50|$|After mating {{has taken}} place in <b>spring,</b> <b>clutches</b> of 3-24 eggs are laid in June-August. The eggs are {{deposited}} in sandy burrows or under large rocks or logs and hatch after 64-79 days of incubation. The eggs are adherent and quite large, up to 66 mm long by 45 mm wide. Hatchlings measure 33 - 45 cm.|$|R
50|$|September 1964: Revisions: {{all models}} have {{diaphragm}} <b>spring</b> <b>clutch,</b> improved heater, crush-style sun visors and plastic-framed rear-view mirror.|$|E
50|$|The gate gear {{manual gearbox}} {{featured}} four speeds and reverse, controlling a coil <b>spring</b> <b>clutch</b> {{acting on the}} flywheel system. A lever produced both declutching and deceleration together.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to its aluminium engine, {{it was the first}} mass-produced British car to have an engine in the back and the first car to use a diaphragm <b>spring</b> <b>clutch.</b> The baulk-ring synchromesh unit for the transaxle compensated for the speeds of gear and shaft before engagement, which the Mini had suffered from during its early production years.|$|E
60|$|Lawyer Gooch paused, for client {{number three}} had leaped {{from his chair}} as if {{propelled}} by steel <b>springs,</b> and <b>clutched</b> his satchel.|$|R
50|$|The motor at {{the back}} of the machine drives a belt {{connected}} to a two-part shaft located roughly halfway through the machine. The cycle shaft on the left side powers the tilt and rotate mechanism. The operational shaft on the right side powers functions such as spacing, backspacing, and case shifting, as well as serving as a governor, limiting the left-to-right speed with which the carrier moves. A series of <b>spring</b> <b>clutches</b> power the cams which provide the motion needed to perform functions such as backspacing.|$|R
50|$|Breeding {{occurs in}} the <b>spring,</b> and <b>clutches</b> of 6-8 eggs are laid in the early summer. The eggs hatch in {{approximately}} two months. Hatchlings are 15 - 18 cm in total length.|$|R
5000|$|In 1928, Frederick G. Creed {{developed}} a single-turn <b>spring</b> <b>clutch</b> (see above) that was particularly {{well suited to}} the repetitive start-stop action required in teleprinters. [...] In 1942, two employees of Pitney Bowes Postage Meter Company {{developed a}}n improved single turn <b>spring</b> <b>clutch.</b> [...] In these clutches, a coil spring is wrapped around the driven shaft and held in an expanded configuration by the trip lever. When tripped, the spring rapidly contracts around the power shaft engaging the clutch. At {{the end of one}} revolution, if the trip lever has been reset, it catches the end of the spring (or a pawl attached to it) and the angular momentum of the driven member releases the tension on the spring. These clutches have long operating lives, many have cycled for tens and perhaps hundreds of millions of cycles without need of maintenance other than occasional lubrication.|$|E
50|$|A two plate dry disk {{diaphragm}} <b>spring</b> <b>clutch</b> drove Fuller four-speed {{main and}} three-speed auxiliary transmissions. The main transmission had a “low” first gear and three road gears, 4th being direct. The auxiliary had low, direct, and overdrive gears. The low gear allowed several very low gears for extreme off-road use. The direct and overdrive allowed the three road gears to be split, making 6 road gears.|$|E
50|$|They are {{completely}} terrestrial but require high soil moisture and cool temperatures. They are most {{active in the}} spring after snow-melt and in the fall after {{the onset of the}} rainy season. They avoid the summer heat and the freezing temperatures of winter, seeking shelter beneath stones or within rotting logs. Courtship and egg laying occurs in the <b>spring.</b> <b>Clutch</b> size ranges from 7-14 eggs which measure about 4-5 mm in diameter. Females attend the eggs until hatching in the fall. There is no larval stage; hatchlings emerge as juvenile salamanders.|$|E
40|$|As a {{mechanical}} system, the kinetochore {{can be viewed}} as a set of interacting <b>springs,</b> <b>clutches</b> and motors; the problem of kinetochore mechanism is now one of understanding how these functional modules assemble, disassemble and interact with one another to give rise to the emergent properties of the system. The sheer complexity of the kinetochore system points to a future requirement for data-driven mathematical modelling and statistical analysis based on quantitative empirical measurement of sister kinetochore trajectories. Here, we review existing models of chromosome motion in the context of recent advances in our understanding of kinetochore molecular biology...|$|R
50|$|The spectacled {{salamander}} {{is most often}} found near streams, in dense vegetation, under leaf litter, dead wood, or stones. It is nocturnal and terrestrial. When threatened, it raises its tail and legs (unkenreflex), displaying its red underside as a deterrent. Similar warning displays (aposematism) are shown by newts, the Apennine yellow-bellied toad and the spotted salamander. Mating takes place on land in <b>spring.</b> <b>Clutches</b> contain about 30-50 eggs and the larvae take 2-3 mo to develop. The {{spectacled salamander}} female enters water only to lay eggs, while the male, once metamorphosis has taken place, avoids water altogether.|$|R
50|$|Plestiodon are all oviparous. The female lays eggs once a {{year after}} the {{breeding}} season in <b>spring.</b> The <b>clutch</b> size varies and is typically around 5 to 10 eggs. The hatchlings appear in late summer.|$|R
50|$|Wrap-spring clutches: These have a helical spring, {{typically}} wound with square-cross-section wire. These {{were developed}} in the late 19th and early 20th century. In simple form the spring is fastened at {{one end to the}} driven member; its other end is unattached. The spring fits closely around a cylindrical driving member. If the driving member rotates in the direction that would unwind the spring the spring expands minutely and slips although with some drag. Because of this, spring clutches must typically be lubricated with light oil. Rotating the driving member the other way makes the spring wrap itself tightly around the driving surface and the clutch locks up very quickly. The torque required to make a <b>spring</b> <b>clutch</b> slip grows exponentially with the number of turns in the spring, obeying the capstan equation.|$|E
50|$|First major revision. New chassis design, engine {{revisions}} {{and body}} work. Introduction {{of a new}} short-stroke version of the oil-cooled engine, now displacing 748 cc. Engine had 73 mm bore and 44.7 mm stoke and could achieve higher engine speeds (13,000 rpm redline indicated, but rev limiter engaged at 13,500 according to the Suzuki shop manual). Internal engine dimensions changed to accommodate the new bore and stroke. This engine used larger valves and carburetors than previous years. Mikuni model BST36SS 'Slingshot' carbs were 36 mm diameter and featured vacuum operated slides; the slide cross section resembled {{the shape of a}} slingshot. A four <b>spring</b> <b>clutch</b> was used on the short stroke motor. New styling, and twin black silencers. Wheels were now a 17 in diameter, three spoke design and used a 160/60VR17 in the rear and 120/70VR17 in the front. Slingshot graphic first appeared on the bodywork. Forks now used a cartridge design and were 43 mm in diameter. The second generation model was heavier than the first but had a stiffer frame and more power.|$|E
5000|$|The 2008 KTM 300 EXC is {{the first}} {{electric}} start two-stroke enduro bike to be released by a major manufacturer. For 2010, Husaberg the other KTM owned bike company, offered the TE300, an XC-W with minor modifications to the body and suspension settings. From 2011 on the 300s got 6-speed gearboxes, a new exhaust pipe and silencer, and translucent fuel tanks. The 2012s got improvements to the starter, more frame changes resulting in more wheel travel, and a new air box with a filter that can be replaced {{without the use of}} tools. The 2013s got a diaphragm <b>spring</b> <b>clutch,</b> a stronger starter and lighter battery. In 2013, the Husaberg became the Husqvarna TE300 and was given the linkage rear suspension. The 2014 had a new CDI ignition system. The 2015 model chromoly steel frame is painted orange like the motocross models. All the 2015 models have the new White Power 4CS forks with revised damping, the ability to make adjustments on the fly and a smaller front axle. The triple clamps have 2 mm less offset resulting in more trail and different steering characteristics. The rear shock is longer but the travel is unchanged. The electric starter has different gearing to provide higher initial torque from the electric motor, and the battery is lighter and stronger.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} the work accomplished {{to date on}} the NASA/Army Advanced Rotorcraft Transmission (ART) program. A 23 -percent weight reduction has been demonstrated for a high output reduction ratio split path transmission compared to an aggressive program goal of 25 -percent. Greater than 10 dB noise reduction in the cabin is achieved by the use of high contact ratio spur and double helical gears. In addition, mean times between transmission removals have been increased by almost four fold. These performance gains have been achieved by application of advanced transmission technology concepts. Technology areas are being explored which offer high gain but at relatively high risk in such areas as composites, split power gear concepts, double helical gears, new gear materials, high speed <b>spring</b> <b>clutches,</b> and ceramic rolling element bearings...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} a nonlinear servomechanism,, The nonlinear control device is an electromechanical <b>spring</b> <b>clutch</b> designed by the Propeller Division of the Curtis s-Wright Corporation for use in both missiles and manned aircraft. A mathematical representation {{of the system is}} first derived. Then an analytic technique is presented which may be employed to predict such closed-loop response characteristics as gain, phase shift, and bandwidth. Investigations are made regarding both the absolute stability and the relative stability of the system, however, only limited conclusions are reached {{due to the lack of}} established stability criteria for a system of this type. Recommendations are made for further study of the stability of this system for the purpose of establishing such criteria. The ground work for this thesis, including the preliminary analysis and all of the equipment tests, was accomplished by the authors during the summer of I 960 while on an industrial experience tour at the Missiles and Space Division of the Lockheed Aircraft Corporation, Sunnyvale, California. The authors are extremely grateful for having had the opportunity to do this work at Lockheed Missiles and Space Division, Particularly, appreciation is expressed to Mr. Fred A.
