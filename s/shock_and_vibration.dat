25|$|As power {{dissipation}} of components increases and component package size decreases, thermal engineers must innovate to ensure components won't overheat. Devices that run cooler last longer. A heat sink design must fulfill both its thermal {{as well as}} its mechanical requirements. Concerning the latter, the component must remain in thermal contact with its heat sink with reasonable <b>shock</b> <b>and</b> <b>vibration.</b> The heat sink could be the copper foil of a circuit board, or a separate heat sink mounted onto the component or circuit board. Attachment methods include thermally conductive tape or epoxy, wire-form z clips, flat spring clips, standoff spacers, and push pins with ends that expand after installing.|$|E
25|$|Production forging {{involves}} significant {{capital expenditure}} for machinery, tooling, facilities and personnel. In {{the case of}} hot forging, a high-temperature furnace (sometimes {{referred to as the}} forge) is required to heat ingots or billets. Owing {{to the size of the}} massive forging hammers and presses and the parts they can produce, as well as the dangers inherent in working with hot metal, a special building is frequently required to house the operation. In the case of drop forging operations, provisions must be made to absorb the <b>shock</b> <b>and</b> <b>vibration</b> generated by the hammer. Most forging operations use metal-forming dies, which must be precisely machined and carefully heat-treated to correctly shape the workpiece, as well as to withstand the tremendous forces involved.|$|E

By using correlation based techniques and by correcting the optical flows for <b>shocks</b> <b>and</b> <b>vibrations,</b> it is possible to obtain useful sequences of optical flows. From these optical flows it is possible to estimate the egomotion and to obtain information on the absolute velocity, angular velocity and radius of curvature of the moving vehicle.
