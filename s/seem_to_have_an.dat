500|$|Genuine high-pass {{filters are}} difficult, if not impossible, to {{implement}} with distributed elements. The usual design {{approach is to}} start with a band-pass design, but make the upper stopband occur at a frequency that is so high as to be of no interest. Such filters are described as pseudo-high-pass and the upper stopband is described as a vestigial stopband. Even structures that <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> [...] "obvious" [...] high-pass topology, such as the capacitive gap filter of figure 8, turn out to be band-pass when their behaviour for very short wavelengths is considered.|$|E

500|$|Another {{explanation}} {{for the purpose of}} the toxins is to mitigate the effects of parasites. In experimental conditions chewing lice were shown to avoid toxic feathers of hooded pitohui in favour of feathers with lower concentrations of toxin or no toxins at all. Additionally lice that did live in the toxic feathers did not live as long as control lice, suggesting that the toxins could lessen both the incidence of infestation and the severity. A comparative study of the tick loads of wild birds in New Guinea would seem to support the idea, as hooded pitohuis had considerably fewer ticks than almost all the 30 genera examined. The [...] batrachotoxins do not <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> effect on internal parasites such as Haemoproteus or the malaria-causing Plasmodium.|$|E
500|$|In {{the first}} decade of the 21st century WNO gave more than 120 {{performances}} a year, with a repertoire, generally, of eight full-scale operas. Its regular audience figures totalled over 150,000 annually, in ten principal venues, three of them in Wales and seven in England. During this period the company was criticised for being insufficiently Welsh. A local politician, Adam Price, said that WNO ought to have a Welsh musical director; Alun Hoddinott said in 2004, [...] "WNO has put on perhaps four or five Welsh operas over 20 years. ... They just <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> anti-Welsh music bias. I am sad that they do not do something for Welsh composers, especially young ones." [...] A more positive view of WNO came from Scotland, where the two main newspapers, The Scotsman and The Herald, greeted a visit from the company in 2005 with enthusiastic praise, contrasting the flourishing of opera in Wales with its neglect by politicians in Scotland and the consequent decline of Scottish Opera. In 2010 WNO commissioned Gair ar Gnawd ("Word on Flesh"), by Pwyll ap Siôn and Menna Elfyn, with words in Welsh, described as [...] "a contemporary story about Wales today ... inspired by the translation of the Bible".|$|E

Michael Pawson and David Busseret wrote “...one way or the other nearly all the propertied {{inhabitants}} of Port Royal <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> interest in privateering.” Forced trade was rapidly making Port Royal one of the wealthiest communities in the English territories of North America, far surpassing any profit made from the production of sugar cane. Zahedieh wrote, “The Portobello raid [...] alone produced plunder worth £75,000, more than seven times the annual value of the island’s sugar exports, which at Port Royal prices did not exceed £10,000 at this time.” ...|$|E

The work was repugnant to me, chiefly from my not being able to see any meaning in the early steps in algebra. This impatience was very foolish, and in after years I have deeply regretted that I did not proceed far enough at least to understand something of the great leading principles of mathematics, for men thus endowed <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> extra sense".|$|E

2500|$|According to Evans' {{report to}} the British School at Athens for that year, on April 5, the {{excavators}} discovered the first large cache ever of Linear B tablets among {{the remains of a}} wooden box in a disused terracotta bathtub. Subsequently, caches turned up at multiple locations, including the Room of the Chariot Tablets, where over 350 pieces from four boxes were found. The tablets were [...] to [...] long by [...] to [...] wide and were scored with horizontal lines over which text was written in about 70 characters.

2500|$|The {{effect of}} sleep {{duration}} on somatic growth {{is not completely}} known. One study recorded growth, height, and weight, as correlated to parent-reported time in bed in 305 children {{over a period of}} nine years (age 1–10). It was found that [...] "the variation of sleep duration among children does not <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> effect on growth." [...] It is well established that slow-wave sleep affects growth hormone levels in adult men. During eight hours' sleep, Van Cauter, Leproult, and Plat found that the men with a high percentage of SWS (average 24%) also had high growth hormone secretion, while subjects with a low percentage of SWS (average 9%) had low growth hormone secretion.|$|E

In her later years, Evi Ellis, who had shared her bedroom when a child refugee and who was then married to Ernst Wohlgemuth and had moved to Notting Hill from Chicago, tried matchmaking her with Ralph Miliband but failed. Franklin once told Evi that her flatmate asked her for a drink, {{but she did not}} get the intention. She was quite infatuated by her French mentor Mering, who had a wife and a mistress. Mering also admitted that he was captivated by her [...] "intelligence and beauty". According to Sayre, she did confess her feeling for Mering when she was undergoing surgery, but her family denied this. But Mering wept when he visited her later, and destroyed all her letters.|$|E

He wondered [...] "How much tolerance would [...] have for a Christian Heritage month?" [...] She replied that the situation is different, that [...] "Judaism is unique, because it is both a culture and a religion," [...] and that she was not in favor of [...] "teaching any religion in public schools." [...] The congresswoman's father, Larry Wasserman, said that while his daughter had not been particularly active in the Jewish community before entering politics, she has [...] "forged ties with Jewish groups as a lawmaker. She helped to form the National Jewish Democratic Council and served on the regional board of the American Jewish Congress." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{contrast}} to the chronic otitis externa, acute otitis externa (AOE) is predominantly a bacterial infection, occurs suddenly, rapidly worsens, and becomes painful. [...] The ear canal has an abundant nerve supply, so the pain is often severe enough to interfere with sleep. [...] Wax in the ear can combine with the swelling of the canal skin and the associated pus to block the canal and dampen hearing, creating a temporary conductive hearing loss. In more severe or untreated cases, the infection can spread to the soft tissues of the face that surround the adjacent parotid gland and the jaw joint, making chewing painful. In its mildest forms, otitis externa is so common that some {{ear nose and throat}} physicians have suggested that most people will have at least a brief episode at some point in life. While a small percentage of people <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> innate tendency toward chronic otitis externa, most people can avoid otitis externa altogether once they understand the intricate mechanisms of the disease.|$|E
