40|$|Abstract. In the <b>structural</b> {{design of}} <b>ceramics</b> {{components}} especially for graphite materials, {{it is important}} to apply the realistic fracture model in the design method so as to reduce the large safety margin.

The advantage of the model is a treatment of the microstructural information such as grain size, pore size and pore size distribution. The proposed model was applied to biaxial strength prediction of near isotropic nuclear graphite using grain/pore related microstructure parameters.

50|$|This {{principle}} generalizes {{to other}} classes of material. Naturally brittle materials, such as glass, are {{not difficult to}} toughen effectively. Most such techniques involve one of two mechanisms: to deflect or absorb {{the tip of a}} propagating crack, or to create carefully controlled residual stresses so that cracks from certain predictable sources will be forced closed. The first principle is used in laminated glass where two sheets of glass are separated by an interlayer of polyvinyl butyral, which as a viscoelastic polymer absorbs the growing crack. The second method is used in toughened glass and pre-stressed concrete. A demonstration of glass toughening is provided by Prince Rupert's Drop. Brittle polymers can be toughened by using metal particles to initiate crazes when a sample is stressed, a good example being high-impact polystyrene or HIPS. The least brittle <b>structural</b> <b>ceramics</b> are silicon carbide (mainly by virtue of its high strength) and transformation-toughened zirconia.|$|E

40|$|Contact {{damage is}} a key aspect in the <b>structural</b> {{integrity}} of <b>ceramics,</b> particularly ceramic coatings and multilayers that may have an elastic mismatch. An understanding of the critical load and trajectories of the crack produced by contact loads in such materials is valuable to characterize the damage tolerance and improve their reliability. In this work, the Hertzian cone crack initiation and propagation in brittle bilayers has been studied by FEM and verified by experimental observations. It was concluded that the elastic mismatch affects the crack initiation position and critical load for cone cracking. Critical loads are lower in bilayers than in monolithic materials. Cone crack trajectory and the corresponding fracture energy release rate are also affected by the elastic mismatch, which thus influences the damage tolerance of the system.

40|$|Nanolayered <b>structural</b> {{metallic}} <b>ceramics,</b> MAX phases, possess {{unique and}} highly attractive properties, including excellent radiation tolerance {{for some of}} them, whereas {{little is known about}} the detailed process of irradiation-induced structural transitions. In this study, the microstructural transformations and the stabilities of V 2 AlC and Cr 2 AlC induced by 1 MeV Au+ ions irradiation over a wide range of fluences were investigated by grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). GIXRD analyses show different processes of phase transitions and amorphization tolerance under irradiation between these two MAX phases, which are consistent with the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) results and the high-resolution observations. TEM observations reveal that the nanolamellar structures are disturbed and respective phase transitions occur at relatively low fluences, with the formation of stacking faults. As the fluence increases, Cr 2 AlC becomes completely amorphous, while V 2 AlC are gradually transformed into face-centered cubic (fcc) structure from the original hexagonal close-packed (hcp) structure without amorphization, indicating that V 2 AlC is more tolerant of irradiation than Cr 2 AlC. Based on the phase contrast images and the electron-diffraction pattern (EDP) simulation of the microstructures, mechanisms of the phase transitions of V 2 AlC and Cr 2 AlC are proposed and the difference of the irradiation tolerance between them is discussed...|$|R
