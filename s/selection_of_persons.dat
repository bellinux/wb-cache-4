40|$|Abstract—This paper {{proposes a}} video-based {{framework}} for face recognition {{to identify which}} faces appear in a video sequence. Our basic idea is like a tracking task- to track a <b>selection</b> <b>of</b> <b>person</b> candidates over time according to the observing visual features of face images in video frames. Hence, we employ the state-space model to formulate video-based face recognition by dividing this problem into two parts: the likelihood and the transition measures. The likelihood measure is to recognize whose face is currently being observed in video frames, for which two-dimensional linear discriminant analysis is employed. The transition measure estimates the probability of changing from an incorrect recognition at the previous stage to the correct person at the current stage. Moreover, extra nodes associated with head nodes are incorporated into our proposed state-space model. The experimental results are also provided to demonstrate the robustness and efficiency of our proposed approach.

5000|$|As {{early as}} 1941, Creutz was {{involved}} in the deportation and resettlement of German families from Lorraine and Luxembourg to Germany, in order to protect them from [...] "undesirable influences" [...] in those areas. He issued detailed instructions on the procedures to be followed and provided progress reports directly to Heinrich Himmler. In 1942, Creutz issued these orders to Reich Governors: [...] "There are a great number of children in former Polish orphanages who, on account of their racial characteristics, must be considered to be children of Nordic parents. These children must be subjected to a racial and psychological selection procedure. Children found to be biologically valuable for the German Reich are to be Germanized." [...] By 1943 these programs had expanded to include the outright abduction of both children and adults. In an eight-page report to Himmler, dated 25 March 1943, Creutz outlined the operations and gave details as to the measures he had ordered: [...] "The <b>selection</b> <b>of</b> <b>persons</b> is to be made by the branch office of the SS Race and Settlement Main Office (RuSHA) in Litzmannstadt (Łódź).

50|$|On various {{occasions}} Eskil {{was involved}} in the internal political disputes of rival kings, even to the extent of being temporarily held captive in his own cathedral, for which he was later indemnified by various land-grants. During the Crusades, Eskil, animated by the example of St. Bernard, also preached a crusade against the pagan Wends, which, unfortunately, proved unsuccessful. He, nevertheless, continued his campaign with youthful ardour, even in his old age, till, after the conquest of Rügen, the Wends accepted Christianity. In 1152 Cardinal Nicholas Breakspear was sent as papal legate to Scandinavia to settle ecclesiastical affairs. Norway was constituted a separate ecclesiastical province, with its metropolitan see of Trondhjem (Nidaros). Eskil remained Archbishop of Lund. He was also nominated Primate of Sweden and papal legate for the North. By a proper <b>selection</b> <b>of</b> <b>persons</b> for the higher ecclesiastical offices he effected an immense improvement in the standard of religious life. In 1161 he drew up a code of canon law for Skåne, which, ten years later, was introduced into Seeland (Denmark). The monastic orders are especially indebted to Eskil. As Bishop of Roskilde he called the Benedictines to Næstved; and the monastery of the Regular Augustinians at Eskilsø near Roskilde most probably traces its origin to him. Later he established the Premonstratensian monastery in Tommerup, Skåne; the Knights of St. John also settled in Lund during his time. There was also, in Seeland, an establishment of Carthusian monks, but only for a short time. The Cistercian monks were especial favourites of Eskil, who founded their first monastery in 1144 at Herrevad (Herivadum) near Helsingborg, which was soon followed by one at Esrom in Sjælland (1154). From both of these various branches were established. Eskil corresponded with St. Bernard, whom he admired and revered. With a view to being admitted to the Cistercian Order he visited St. Bernard at Clairvaux in 1152. Bernard refused him admission, pointing out that his services as bishop would be more beneficial to the Church at large.|$|E
