5|$|At Frankfurt Airport, Nebiu Demeke took {{advantage}} of the airport security by stuffing a pistol deep into his hat and then placing his hat on a table adjacent to the scanner.

5|$|Blake {{tries to}} shoot West with a shotgun, but the blasts {{do not stop}} West, who throws the sheriff over the railing into power lines, killing him. West hits Nelson and knocks him over the railing, leaving the doctor hanging on the side. Nelson appeals to West, {{reminding}} him that they were friends, and West decides to pull Nelson to safety. Two armed <b>security</b> <b>guards</b> then arrive and, in a panic, fatally shoot Nelson in the face {{as he tries to}} protect West. An infuriated West kills the <b>security</b> <b>guards</b> and stumbles away. After collapsing against the side of a building, he slowly melts completely away. The next morning, a janitor finds his gory remains and casually mops them into a garbage can. The film ends with a radio news report about another astronaut team being sent to Saturn.|$|E
5|$|For {{the most}} part the player battles through the single-player game alone, but is {{occasionally}} assisted by friendly non-player characters. <b>Security</b> <b>guards</b> and scientists will occasionally help the player in reaching new areas and convey relevant plot information. However, Opposing Force also features fellow U.S. Marines who will assist the player in combat to a far greater degree than <b>security</b> <b>guards.</b> Three types of Marines are featured in the game: the soldier will simply provide fire support for the player with a submachine gun, shotgun or machine gun, the combat medic is capable of healing the player and other non-player characters, while the engineer can cut through doors and remove obstacles, allowing the player and their squad to proceed unhindered. A selection of enemies from Half-Life populate the game, including alien creatures such as headcrabs and Vortigaunts.|$|E

5|$|Access to the Bull Run Watershed Management Unit is {{generally}} limited to government employees and guests on official business, and <b>security</b> <b>guards</b> keep watch on its three gated entrances. However, the water bureau offers public tours {{in the summer}} and fall, and hikers may use the Pacific Crest Trail, which runs along {{the eastern edge of the}} watershed near Mount Hood. The bureau has been averaging about 85 group tours a year.|$|E
5|$|At a hotel, Borat, {{just out}} of the bath, sees Azamat masturbating over a picture of Pamela Anderson in the Baywatch booklet. An angry Borat accidentally reveals his real motive for {{traveling}} to California.

The two are finally separated by <b>security</b> <b>guards.</b>|$|E
5|$|Blue Shift {{returns the}} player to Half-Lifes Black Mesa {{timeline}} once more, {{this time as}} Barney Calhoun, one of the facility's <b>security</b> <b>guards.</b> The expansion was originally developed as a bonus mission for the canceled Dreamcast version. Blue Shift came with the High Definition Pack, that gave the player the option to update the look of Half-Life, Opposing Force, and the new Blue Shift content. Blue Shift had relatively little new content compared to Opposing Force: aside from a few variations on existing models, all content was already present in the original Half-Life.|$|E

5|$|Official sources {{state that}} the rioting began at around 2 a.m., and {{there were reports that}} they lasted until at least 4.30 a.m., when police arrived. An initial {{disturbance}} was reported at around 11 p.m. when <b>security</b> <b>guards</b> responded to a call for help by a female worker who felt intimidated by several chanting male Uyghurs. Two dozen Han workers armed with batons and metal rods then responded; they called for backup using their phones.|$|E
5|$|Staff {{available}} for employment include entertainers, <b>security</b> <b>guards,</b> mechanics, and handymen. Lack of staff can cause problems, including messy footpaths, rides breaking down, crime, and unhappy visitors. If visitors become unhappy, thugs {{may come to}} vandalise the park by committing offences such as popping balloons, stealing food, and beating up entertainers. Occasionally, wages {{and the price of}} goods must be negotiated; failure to reach an agreement results in staff strikes or loss of shipment.|$|E
5|$|The biggest festival yet {{was held}} in 1990; however, {{the day after the}} festival ended, {{violence}} – between the <b>security</b> <b>guards</b> and new age travellers (the so-called Battle of Yeoman's Bridge) – led to the organisers taking 1991 and 1996 off to rethink the festival. An expanded festival returned in 1992, and this proved a great success. 1992 was the first year that the new age travellers were not initially allowed onto the site free, and a sturdier fence was designed. This success was carried through to 1993 which, like 1992, was hot and dry.|$|E
50|$|While {{playing around}} on the bleachers, they are found by the <b>security</b> <b>guard,</b> Ben (David Lovgren).

5|$|The hill {{also has}} two disused quarries, one quarry {{listed on the}} North West side on an 1911 map, and another one listed as an old quarry on the West side in 1885–1900. It was {{acquired}} by the National Trust in 1930. People protesting against the building of an A46 bypass road cut a small turf maze into the hill, during {{the construction of the}} bypass in the mid-1990s. In one day of protests, 11 people, including George Monbiot, were hospitalised as a result of beatings by the <b>security</b> <b>guards.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{tower was}} {{built out of}} {{the remains of the}} roof, similar to one that had existed at Claremont Road, and a system of defences and {{blockades}} were built. A core of around 30 protesters ensured that there were always people staying there (a legal requirement for a squatted home, as well as a defence against eviction). They were finally evicted on 21 June 1995, whereupon, as at Claremont Road, the building was immediately demolished. The total cost of removing the protesters from Munstonia was given to be £239,349.52, not including additional costs of <b>security</b> <b>guards.</b>|$|E
5|$|According to {{an early}} {{estimate}} by The Globe and Mail, 25,000 uniformed police officers, 1,000 <b>security</b> <b>guards</b> from Commissionaires Great Lakes, and several Canadian military forces were to be deployed during the summit. The North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) conducted Amalgam Virgo exercises on May 6 and 7 across the Greater Toronto Area using CF-18 Hornet jets, CH-124 Sea Kings, and CH-146 Griffon helicopters at low altitudes. The total cost for security at both the G8 and the G20 summits {{was determined to be}} , paid entirely by the federal Crown-in-Council, excluding the costs of any possible damage to local business.|$|E
