Five treatments (no grazing, dry season moderate, dry season heavy, wet season moderate, and wet season heavy) were applied on three different streams. Change in channel cross-sectional area, following one season of treatments, was determined and evaluated. There {{was no significant difference}} (P = 0. 236) between treatments. Erosion and deposition resulting from heavy rainfall and streamflow may have masked treatment effects. Treatments will continue to be applied annually for an additional 4 years. Grazing-derived sediment impacts on the beneficial uses of water are a continual concern among conservation groups and regulatory agencies, such as the Regional Water Quality Control Board (George 1992, 1993). While crucial <b>salmonid</b> <b>water</b> bodies receive a great deal of attention, little attention is given to sediment delivery from low-elevation intermittent streams in California’s Central Sierra Nevada foothills.

40|$|Biological {{surveys are}} {{routinely}} {{used throughout the}} United States to identify localized impairments in aquatic ecosystems. This approach however, has had limited acceptance for in situ assessment situations in determining specific sources or causes of observed impairments as required under Section 303 (d) of the Clean Water Act. While the best approach for determining the effect of urban impacts on streams is to directly compare biological data before and after urban impacts this approach is rarely used {{because of the lack}} of historical or pre-disturbance data. Traditionally, the source-cause investigation focused on using aquatic life chemical criteria as benchmarks, resulting in a "violation perspective" methodology that emphasizes specific water quality criteria being exceeded. Relying solely on this approach can be problematic since not all environmental stressors will have established criteria (e. g., sediment criteria are lacking) and those having criteria may not be sufficiently protective of portions of the aquatic resource (e. g., ammonia). This violation perspective assumes that intermittent chemical sampling and analysis will eventually discover the variables (contaminants) causing the impairment and emphasizes a select few water quality criteria exemplifying the “pollutant” focused approach as opposed to a broader and more comprehensive pollution focused approach. Furthermore, chemical water quality criteria are further removed from the designated use, which is more directly measured by the biota and minimizes type I and II assessment errors that would otherwise be more frequent. Evaluating aquatic systems using the violation perspective becomes increasingly more problematic due to increasing water samples collection costs, increased analysis costs for possible chemical stressors, and determining the identity among the thousands of possible stressors. Imperative to this discussion is that slightly elevated contaminant concentrations, synergistic effects, or sporadic spikes could adversely affect fish assemblage structure. As a result, these factors can potentially result in a biological impairment without the occurrence of specific chemical criteria violations. Nationally, the perception of causality for biologically impaired systems has shifted from point-source influences to more diffuse non-point source influences. Difficulty in tracking these pervasive non point-source impacts, combined with the lack of pre-determined signatory relationships with biological assemblage patterns creates a more complex problem. One way of increasing our knowledge of signatory relationships is through multivariate analysis utilizing the definable relationships between aquatic assemblage structure and quantifiable environmental stressors. The purpose of this research was multifaceted. We investigated the relationship between stressor response models associated with an urban landscape, multiple assemblage response, and fish assemblage nutrient response. Essentially the study area for this research encompassed data collected from across the State of Indiana. The nature of the analysis performed resulted in this volume of data being compartmentalized into discreet spatially driven subsets that were analyzed independently. To determine the responsiveness of fish assemblages to stressors associated with an urban landscape we targeted the Salt Creek Watershed. Salt Creek is a Lake Michigan tributary in Northwest Indiana, USA, which drains a watershed experiencing rapid urbanization as part of the expansion of the Greater Chicago metropolitan area. The watershed supports a managed coldwater fishery comprised principally of the introduced Skamania strain of the steelhead (Oncorhynchus mykiss). The sustainability of this watershed depends on the proper management of warm water tributaries and <b>salmonid</b> <b>water</b> in the Salt Creek mainstem. Twenty-three fish species were collected in the Salt Creek watershed and were numerically dominated by creek chub (Semotilus atromaculatus) and green sunfish (Lepomis cyanellus) both of which are tolerant to a wide range of environmental conditions. Habitat quality, measured using the Qualitative Habitat Evaluation Index (QHEI), showed that the watershed was generally degraded and scores ranged from 12 - 69. Fourteen parameters were significantly correlated with reach scale ecological health and biological integrity. Factor analysis found three factors explained 69 % of the contributed variance in the watershed fish assemblage. The first factor included habitat measures comprised of the QHEI score and three of its metrics (i. e., channel, riparian and instream cover scores) and explained 36 percent of data variability. The second factor was comprised of two contaminants (i. e., TDS and Chloride) and one local-scale land-use variable (Agriculture) that explained an additional 20 percent of the variability. The third factor was comprised of two local scale land-use variables (i. e., riparian zone and water) explaining 13 percent of the variability. To evaluate the responsiveness of multiple aquatic assembles to watershed stress we target the Big Oaks National Wildlife Refuge. The Big Oaks National Wildlife Refuge encompasses the northern 51, 000 acres of the former Jefferson Proving Ground (JPG) which was used from 1940 - 1995 as a munitions testing facility. Since 2000 the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service has utilized the northern 51, 000 acres of JPG for ecosystem-based management in conjunction with continued use by the U. S. Department of Army and Indiana Air National Guard for air-to-ground training. An investigation of factors that explained the variance in fish, crayfish, and macroinvertebrate assemblage structure and function was based on catchment and reach-scale land use, habitat, contaminants, and water quality. Habitat quality, measured using the Qualitative Habitat Evaluation Index (QHEI), showed that scores ranged from 25 to 85 (average 61. 36 + 10. 08). The substrate score, instream cover, riffle-run score, and channel score were the primary factors contributing to declining QHEI scores. Factor analysis found four factors explained 69 percent of the contributed variance in the fish assemblage, two factors accounted for 56 percent of the total variance in macroinvertebrate assemblages, and two factors explained 49 percent of the cumulative variance in crayfish assemblages. Overall drivers of assemblage structure were associated with broad scale issues of wastewater treatment, ground water, and land-use. Our results show that fish, macroinvertebrate, and crayfish assemblages respond to similar broad scale stimulus; however, the specific physical/chemical constituent responsible for the stress may vary, and the realized magnitude of the overall stress on the system may be expressed by each organismal group differently. Our data suggest that varying organismal groups can respond independently and stress reflected in one assemblage may not necessarily be observed in another. Finally, we evaluated nutrient response in fish assemblages targeting a large data set collected from the Indiana portion of the Corn Belt Plain Ecoregion. Due to the complex interactions between the various forms of Nitrogen and Phosphorus within respective cycles, Total Nitrogen (TN) and Total Phosphorus (TP) cycling interactions can no longer be accepted as sole limiting factors in either marine or freshwaters. This study is conducted as part of the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) desire to development regional nutrient thresholds. The first objective of this study is to develop a biotic model capable of determining the contributions of various nutrients, including Nitrogen components and TP, in streams using fish assemblages. The second objective is to establish an approach for designating defensible nutrient biotic index (NBI) score thresholds and corresponding nutrient concentrations, above which fish assemblages show alterations due to increasing nutrient concentrations. Sampling within Indiana’s portion of the Corn Belt and Northern Great Plain Nutrient Ecoregion occurred from 1996 - 2007 at 1274 sites. Nutrient data were reviewed for outliers and then sorted into three groups relative to drainage class. Each group was arranged into 15 ranges or “bins” using the Jenks optimization method in Arc GIS 9. 3. Next, sites were assigned to each bin relative to observed concentrations. These bin assignments were used to populate the species occurrence model for nutrient optima calculation. Nutrient optima were calculated by dividing the sum of the weighted proportion of times a species occurred in each bin by the un-weighted proportion of times a species occurred in each bin. The derived nutrient optima were divided into eleven equal ranges, by nutrient, and tolerance scores (0 - 10) assigned with respect to each species derived optima. Nutrient tolerance scores were used to calculate Nutrient Biotic Index (NBI) scores for each sampling site by summing the number of individuals of a given species at the site and multiplying times that species tolerance value then dividing by the total number of individuals at the site. A single break point was observed for unionized ammonia, which showed an NBIUnionized Ammonia score shift between 0. 003 and 0. 03 (mg/L). The mean NBIUnionized Ammonia scores were 3. 09 and 3. 29, respectively. Nutrient Biotic IndexUnionized Ammonia scores were significantly correlated with IBI score and IBI integrity class. Three break points were observed for Nitrogen, Nitrate+Nitrite, demonstrating a significant NBINitrate+Nitrite score shift at mean concentrations of 0. 13 mg/L, 1. 09 mg/L, 3. 15 mg/L and 6. 87 mg/L respectively. The mean NBINitrate+Nitrite scores were 5. 58, 5. 37, 5. 82 and 6. 25, respectively. The observed relationship produced a convex curve suggesting an enrichment signature. Nutrient Biotic IndexNitrate+Nitrite scores were significantly correlated with IBI score and IBI integrity class. Two break points were observed for Total Kjeldahl Nitrogen (TKN), which were significant. The mean concentrations of TKN were 0. 4 mg/L, 0. 68 mg/L, and 1. 27 mg/L, respectively. The mean NBITKN scores were 2. 73, 3. 10, and 3. 37, respectively. Nutrient Biotic IndexTKN scores were significantly related to IBI score and IBI integrity class. Two break points observed for TN were significant at concentrations of 0. 56 mg/L and 3. 30 mg/L. The mean NBITN scores were 4. 60 and 4. 85, respectively. Nutrient Biotic IndexTN scores were not significantly related to IBI score or IBI integrity class. Two significant break points were observed for TP. The mean concentrations of TP were 0. 07 mg/L and 0. 32 mg/L, respectively and mean NBITP scores were 3. 43 and 3. 58, respectively. Nutrient Biotic IndexTP scores were significantly related to IBI score and IBI integrity class. Two break points were observed for Chlorophyll a (periphyton), which were significant. Mean concentrations were 10. 15 mg/m 2 and 134. 14 mg/m 2, respectively. Mean NBIPeriphyton scores were 3. 75 and 4. 20, respectively. Nutrient Biotic IndexPeriphyton scores were not significantly related to IBI score, but were significantly related to IBI integrity class. Four break points were observed for Chlorophyll a (phytoplankton), which occurred at Chlorophyll a (phytoplankton) concentrations of 2. 33 μg/L, 10. 98 μg/L and 49. 13 μg/L, respectively. The mean NBIPhytoplankton scores were 3. 43, 3. 85 and 5. 02, respectively. Nutrient Biotic IndexPhytoplankton scores were significantly related to IBI score and IBI integrity class. Nutrient criteria concentration was interpreted for NBI and IBI integrity class relationships to establish protective nutrient concentration benchmarks. Proposed mean protection values are 3. 0 μg/L for Unionized Ammonia, 130 μg/L for Nitrogen, Nitrate+Nitrite, 40 μg/L for TKN, 70 μg/L for TP, and 2. 33 μg/L for Chlorophyll a (phytoplankton). Criteria established at or below these benchmarks should protect for both biological integrity of fish assemblages in Indiana as well as nutrient loadings into the Gulf of Mexico. Charles C.

The lake attracts thousands of British, European and local anglers and has been the venue for the All Ireland Course Angling Competition. Lough Gowna is popular for swimming, water skiing and power boat racing. The lake is also used for abstraction of public water supplies by Longford and Cavan County Councils. Suitable water quality criteria to protect the above mentioned uses are; (i) EC (Quality of <b>Salmonid</b> <b>Waters)</b> Regulations, 1988.

High phosphorus and chlorophyll a concentrations and very low transparency levels together with the dominance of blue-green algae in the phytoplankton indicate the lake is eutrophic. Stratification of the lake in the summer months gives rise to severe deoxygenation in the hypolimnion. “Excessive” and “permissible” annual phosphorus loadings for Lough Gowna were calculated using Vollenweider’s equation (Vollenweider 1976).

The assessment considers the potential impacts of the proposed scheme in terms of surface water hydrology, flood risk, coastal and fluvial geomorphology and water quality. There are several environmentally sensitive waterbodies within the study area. These include the Firth of Forth which has two SPA designations (the Firth of Forth SPA and Forth Islands SPA), along with a Ramsar designation {{and a number of}} smaller SSSI designations. St. Margaret’s Marsh is designated as a SSSI due to saltmarsh wetland and reedbed habitat, which in turn provide important habitats for breeding and migratory wintering birds. The River Almond is designated as <b>salmonid</b> <b>waters</b> as is one of its tributaries within the study area, i. e. Niddry Burn.

40|$|Mining {{is a human}} {{activity}} with considerable environmental impact. To evaluate such impacts, international laws require undertaking local studies based on direct sampling to establish baseline conditions of parameters modified by human activities. Mining takes place near the Alto Tajo Natural Park, where a suspended sediment concentration (SSC) baseline is required to determine whether mining affects water quality. To this end, we have monitored the Tajo River and its tributary the Tajuelo following Before–After Control-Impact (BACI) techniques, recommended by Australian and New Zealand laws, requiring a specific method based on continuous monitoring and sampling to enable evaluation of SSCs. An SSC baseline has been defined at stations situated upstream of the mining area and compared with those downstream. The highest detected SSC upstream of the Tajuelo mines was 24 [*]g[*]l− 1 whereas the highest simultaneous downstream value was 391 [*]g[*]l− 1, more than one order of magnitude higher than the supposed baseline (24 [*]g[*]l− 1). Additionally, this value is 1000 {{times more than the}} average concentration of 25 [*]mg[*]l− 1, used by the European Union until 2015, to guarantee the quality of <b>salmonid</b> <b>waters.</b> Following a BACI approach, a statistically significant SSC impact has been identified. The mined areas are the only source that can explain this increase. This is the first instance that such an increase and baseline have been found using this method.

To evaluate the influence of these factors the indirect (Detrended Correspondence Analysis, DCA) and direct (Canonical Correspondence Analysis, CCA) multivariate cluster analysis were used. Analyses were performed with data on presence-absence and relative abundance of each species. DCA well reflects changes in assemblages in the longitudinal profile of streams. CCA refers to a significant influence of regional and temporal variability and influence of individual factors.

40|$|P. Quinn Abstract: Dolly Varden (Salvelinus malma) are a facultatively {{anadromous}} salmonid common around {{much of the}} North Pacific Rim, {{but little}} is known about the environmental factors affecting the timing and diversity of their migration. We combined telemetry of anadromous fish with long-term monitoring of Dolly Varden upstream migration timing and environmental data in the Chignik Lakes watershed in Alaska and then compared the timing data with that of other streams where only count data were available. Telemetry revealed two upstreammigration modes: midsummer and late fall at the Chignik Lakes. Weir counts indicated that timing fluctuated markedly over the monitoring period (1996 – 2011) and was negatively correlated with June sea surface temperature. The relationship between sea surface temperature and migration timing in other watersheds with long-term records was as follows: negative (Buskin River), positive (Auke Creek), or nonexistent (Goodnews and Kanektok rivers). Among 18 streams and rivers throughout the eastern Pacific range of Dolly Varden, median upstream migration date increased with latitude. Overall, Dolly Varden migration timing is more variable, protracted, and more strongly influenced by local sea surface temperatures than is typical of semelparous salmonids. These results are likely indicative of other iteroparous <b>salmonids</b> in Pacific <b>waters</b> that share similar environments and life-history characteristics.

40|$|Abstract. —The {{negative}} effect of turbidity on the reactive distance of salmonids {{has been well}} established. However, determining {{the consequences of this}} relationship for overall feeding success remains problematic, as successful foraging by salmonids across a broad range in turbidity has been observed under a variety of conditions. Previous laboratory and field observations suggest that benthic feeding by <b>salmonids</b> in flowing <b>water</b> affects the turbidity dependence of foraging success. Two experiments were conducted in a laboratory stream to quantify benthic feeding success of salmonids across turbidity treatments ranging from 0 to 400 nephelometric turbidity units (NTU). In one experiment, cutthroat trout Oncorhynchus clarkii and coho salmon O. kisutch were offered the same nonliving prey in the drift and on the stream bottom; in the second experiment, cutthroat trout were offered only live oligochaetes moving along the stream bottom. In the first experiment, benthic feeding success of both cutthroat trout and coho salmon at 100 NTU was at least 70 % of their feeding performance in clear water (i. e., 0 NTU), whereas neither species fed at 400 NTU. In the second experiment, benthic feeding success of cutthroat trout at 150 NTU was about 35 % of their performance in clear water but dropped to near 0 % at 200 NTU; no feeding was observed at 400 NTU. Passive integrated transponder tag detections suggested that cutthroat trout activity increased over the range of 0 – 150 NTU. Although drift and benthic foraging success decreased over the examined turbidity range, the results sugges...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. -Karst {{topography}} is {{a unique}} and distinct landscape and its geology may {{have important implications for}} salmon productivity in streams. The relationship between <b>salmonid</b> communities and <b>water</b> chemistry and the influence of habitat was examined in a set of streams on north Prince of Wales Island, southeast Alaska. Streams in karst landscapes showed higher alkalinities (1, 500 - 2, 300 µeq/L) than streams not influenced by karst landscapes (750 - 770 µeq/L). A significant, positive relationship was observed between alkalinity and density of coho salmon parr Oncorhynchus kitsutch. Backwater pools supported higher densities of coho salmon than did other habitat units. Both coho salmon fry and parr tended to be larger in most karst-influenced streams than in nonkarst streams. Although past timber harvest practices in the riparian areas of several of the streams appeared to influence stream habitat and water temperature, streams flowing through karst landscapes had a distinct water chemistry. Furthermore, these streams appeared to support more fish than nonkarst streams. Karst topography {{is a unique}} geological feature formed by the differential dissolution of limestone (Harding and Ford 1993). The landscape typically has an irregular surface topography with sinkholes, caves, underground streams, and upwelling water (Ford and Williams 1989). Karst topography occurs in several distinct areas of southeast Alaska (Soja 1990; Busch 1994) and is best represented on the northern end of Prince of Wales Island and islands along its west coast (Baichtel 1993). Dissolution of limestone increases the alkalinity of streams as they flow through karst terrain, and higher alkalinity has been associated with increased growth rates for brown trout Salmo trutt...|$|R

Fish farming {{has grown}} very rabidly {{during the past}} few decades. One {{component}} of this expansion is the introduction of new species, previously unknown to most consumers, to world markets. Arctic char, a cold <b>water</b> <b>salmonid,</b> is one of these species. In 1987, the total commercial supply only amounted to 31 tons but in 2013 the world production was approximately 8 thousand tons, with Iceland contributing to nearly half of this supply. This paper describes the evolution of the Icelandic Arctic char fish farming industry and attempts to assess its future prospects. Among the questions the paper attempts to answer are: Can the industry so far be characterized as being successful and in what sense? What is the environmental footprint of the Arctic char production compared to that of other farmed fish? Can Arctic char be supplied to global markets in large quantities at competitive prices? To answer these and other questions, an economic production model of this industry is developed based primarily on Icelandic empirical data. The resulting short and long run Arctic char supply functions are compared to the supply function for similar species such as salmon...|$|R
